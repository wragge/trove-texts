What everyone says is bound to be true, and young and
old, rich and poor, physicians who recommend, and
patients who try
THE KRUPP GALVANIC BELT,
All agree in praising that most scientific of Electro
Therapeutical Appliances. For Rheumatism it is un-
rivalled. Lumbago at once succumbs to its power. The
Nervous are strengthened and the Debilitated restored to
perfect health and vigour. In short, the appliance is an
unfailing cure for all Nervous, Sexual, or Chronic Diseases,
and is
Guaranteed to Absolutely Cure
completely and lastingly, the following complaints:—
Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, Pains in the Back and Chest,
Lumbago, Catarrh, Rheumatism, Dumb Ague,
Nervousness, Debility, Paralysis, Kidney Com-
plaint, Spinal Disease, Female Weakness, Diseases
of the Liver, Diabetes, Sciatica, Atrophy, Gout, In-
digestion, Asthma, Piles, Epilepsy Spermatorrhcea,
Specks before the Eyes, Excessive Heart Palpitation,
Defective Memory.
An Unfailing Cure for Varicocele.
It is a PORTABLE BODY BATTERY, and contains
special appliances for both sexes ; therefore, why waste
your money and health by procuring and taking USE-
LESS DRUGS? Electricity, when properly applied, is
acknowledged by all leading and unprejudiced physicians
to be the only safe and radical cure for Nervous and
Sexual Diseases, and the thousands of testimonials re-
ceived by the Krupp Belt Co. from leading personages
throughout Australasia prove the unquestionable curative
properties of Electricity as applied by the appliance above
referred to. Our confidence in this appliance is so
complete, that

(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Une Person, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Jnjducation.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin's conductors claim that every
progressive paper-on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to-profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-,
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.-
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride,
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade' against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other-paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
coum ry dis: riots where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.
POST FREE TO ANY PART OF AUSTRALIA.
No matter how tar in the interior you reside, ELLIS’S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY—they are a “going con-
cern ” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The follow'ing

A Baby’s natural food contains no

A Special Food
For Babies, prepared by our process to
suit the delicate infant stomach, sup-
plying muscle, flesh and bone to the
growing child. It is made of pure Cows’
Milk, combined with Wheat and Barley,
and is physiologically and practically a
Perfect Food for a growing Baby. Use
Horliek’s Malted Milk
For gabies
And you will have them healthy, happy
and strong. It contains no starch, re-
quires no cooking, merely mixing with

able and convenient.

There is to be another big bazaar boom in
Melbourne. Recently, St. Brigid’s R. C. Church
made .£6OO in three weeks in an old skating-rink.
St. Patrick’s Cathedral holds a three weeks fair in
the Exhibition in Nov., and there are rumours of
a huge bazaar and variety show to be held in the
Exhibition for a University club. The Chair of
Music bazaar in the Exhibition, seven years ago,
made a net profit of nearly <£3500, and if this
University one comes off now, it will, with good
management, beat that.
An instance of God-implanted thrift on the
part of a Yankee bookseller :—“ He takes a paper-
covered novel, published at 50 cents, but which he
has bought for 30, and sells it for 35 cents, with
the understanding that the buyer is to return it
when read. When the book comes back he pays
20 cents for it and puts it up for sale again at 30
cents. The second buyer returns the book and
receives 15 cents, and for a third time the book is
on the shelves, this time marked 20 cents, or so.
Again it comes back, the reader takes 10 cents,
and the book will change owners half-a-dozen
times. Books have often paid 2000 per cent, on the
original investment.”
Dear Bulletin, —Well do I mind the time
O’Mulligan was appointed J.P. When he started
from home to be sworn in at Bungletown Quarter
Sessions, his hair and beard were long and
straggled, and he wore a frowzy grey slop-suit
that might have been new ten years before.
While he was in Bungletown he visited a tailor
and a barber with results that will explain them-
selves hereafter. To commemorate the event, dur-
ing his absence Mrs. Mulligan killed a sucking-pig
and two “turkey-roosthers,” and invited half the
neighbourhood to a free-and-easy. She also
scrubbed and dressed all her children—there were
twelve of them—and made them feel straightlaced
and clean and miserable ; and on top of this she
ordered them, under pains and penalties, to fall
into line on the approach of their father and all,
in one voice, exclaim, “Welcome home again,
Your Worship ! ” At 4 o’clock on the fourth day
—the day of the expected return of O’Mul-
ligan— all the dogs rushed out of the
house and started barking. All the guests
rushed out also, though they didn’t bark.
Amid the uproar the voice of Mrs. O’Mulligan
could be heard commanding her terrified offspring
to “sthand in foine. ohildther,” and a strange,
clean-shaven man, dressed in a black swallow-
tailed coat and tall, black “ billy,” could be seen
riding up to the house on a grey mare which some-
how seemed familiar. “ Mebbe it’s the new
praist,” said Mrs. O’Mulligan. Nearer came the
“stranger,” and more intense grew the excite-
ment. Suddenly Mrs. O’Mulligan seemed to lose
her head, and, turning to her “ kids,” exclaimed
in awe-inspiring voice, “Give the salute, childther,
for its none else than his majesty ! ” Patrick
O’Mulligan, J. I’., had returned from Bungletown.
—Yours, &c., H. J. Mac., Burragorang, May 14.

THE GOLDEN AGE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Heu fugaces ! sings the Roman lyrist of the olden time,
Under tangled vines he sleeps to ripples of the river’s
rhyme,
Breathed upon the mossy walls that saw the singer in his
prime.
Eighteen centuries have flakM their grey ashes on the
earth,
Rich the harvest of the mind that hides the old, barbaric
dearth,
Till the ancient planet shudders at each new titanic
birth.
Gomes unbidden from the sunny lanes where lie the
sleeping years,
Hued by Memory’s white wake, a yearning for the joy and
tears-
Under Tempe’s groves where faun and nymph were man’s
heart-easing peers;
Rebecks, flutes and dulcimers, faint echoes of a musio
lorn
Circling in deep-bosomed forests from the hunters’ matin
horn,
Hvmnfed to the sun ere he has lit the bloom upon the
corn.

SATURDAY, JUNE 9, 1894.
Some Legal Anomalies.
The many anomalies—some of them comic,
most of them tragic—of New South Wales
law have been pointed out over and over
again with very little effect. A certain dull
and soulless indifference is one of the most
conspicuous features of the Australian
character, and the old laws of the Yande-
monian era linger year after year merely
because the mass of the people suffer from a
fixed conviction that nothing matters much
and very few things matter at all. The
recent case of Montgomery and Williams
drew attention for the moment to a few of
the more glaring vices of the criminal code,
and for the moment there was manifested, as
on many previous occasions, a faint interest
in the workings of the vicious old system.
But with the execution of those criminals
the interest, as on previous occasions, faded
away. The province was roused to a feeble
desire to do something towards repairing
this particular wrong ; the idea of demand-
ing a complete repair of the whole worn-out
and rotten system was entirely beyond it.
Therefore, the old, callous, brutal code, im-
ported from the gaols of Yandemonia, goes
on for ever, no one seriously interfering
with it. It is so brutal, so foolish, so cum-
bersome, murderous, lopsided and corrupt
that forty newspaper articles would not give
space enough to pass even its main features
in review, but a few of them, which have
a direct bearing on the recent trial, may
here be touched upon.
# # •
The case of Montgomery and Williams
turned entirely on the manner of the indict-
ment. Their crime, apart from the original
burglary, was distinctly that of assault with
intent to resist arrest, for which the law
awards life-long penal servitude ; the Attor-
ney-General and the Crown Law Depart-
ment chose, for some unfathomable reason,
to indict them instead for assault with intent
to commit murder—of which intent there
was clearly not sufficient evidence ; and they
were convicted and executed accordingly.
There was no second accusation laid, to
enable the jury, if it considered the intent
to murder not sufficiently proved, to return a
verdict upon the minor charge ; the twelve
men in the box were ordered either to find
the prisoners guilty of the capital charge—
which was utterly illogical—or to find them
altogether innocent— which was equally
absurd. Trial by jury has always been more
or less of a farce; the Crown Law Office this
time turned it into a burlesque. The com-
mon assumption is that the jury has
power to decide the guilt or innocence
of a prisoner according to the evidence ;
the reality is that the jury is not
allowed to take any notice whatever
of the crime which is proved by the evidence
U «: 6 - 8 S * 3 a^so cr i me which a certain
official has set down in the indict-
ment. In the present instance, the crime
proved by the evidence and the crime
mentioned in the indictment were about as
far apart as if the accused had been charged,
on the same evidence, with bigamy, forgery,
and horse-stealing. And if they had been
so charged the verdict would probably have
been just the same. Owing to the workings
of the good old Yandemonian system the
average jury has learned to take most of the
case for granted ; it simply decides that the
accused have done something, and seldom
inquires whether the thing they have done
and the thing they are charged with doing is
the same or not.
• * • *
Provided the prisoner is too poor to hire
an able advocate who can expose the dis-
crepancies of the case, it is only necessary
to be able to prove clearly that he has done
something, and the Crown can procure his
conviction upon almost any charge it pleases
to select. The average jury consists of
twelve sheep driven blindly over a precipice.
The consequence of the system is seen in
their frequent efforts to undo their work
when it is too late. In the Montgomery-
Williams case, as in many others, the jury-
men afterwards did their utmost to secure a
reprieve, and most of them expressed a
tardy regret at their own illogical verdict.
The apparent reason of their regret was that
the verdict didn’t express their convictions ;
only it expressed them as nearly as the
indictment would allow, and as it had to
be that or nothing they let it go on the
assumption that it didn’t make much differ-
ence. The difference, as they afterwards
discovered, consisted of two lives,
• » •
A partial, if not a complete, remedy con-
sists in dividing the crime of murder or
attempted murder into various degrees, ac-
cording to the surrounding circumstances,
with a sliding scale of punishrrtents attached,
so that the jury may not only decide that
the prisoner is guilty, but may also decide
how guilty he is, and fix his punishment
within certain limits. This is the system
adopted in the United States. The American
law recognises that homicide, like any other
crime, is an offence which varies according
to the attendant circumstances ; the law of
Australia regards it as a cast-iron fact which
knows no variation whatever, and prescribes
the same punishment for the man who, cold-
bloodedly and slowly, kills off a near relative
by poison for the sake of the insurance-
money and for the person who, in a sudden
access of passion, shoots a brutal enemy under
the most extreme provocation. Then, having
decided that the crime is the same in either
case, it decides further that it is not the
same by allowing the jury to tack on to the
verdict a recommendation to mercy, and
having done this it gets back again to the
old position by allowing a despotic Executive
to tyrannically disregard the recommendation
at its own sole will and pleasure.
* • •
Other anomalies turn up at every step of
the proceedings. The Crown professes to
have no craving after convictions ; it doesn’t
wish to win an unjust cause and is as
anxious to procure the acquittal of the inno-
cent as the punishment of the guilty. Its
practice, unfortunately, doesn’t square with
its theory. The penniless prisoner who is
tried for his life is allowed, in New South
Wales, the miserable sum of fifteen guineas
(until within the last six years it was jive
guineas) for the purposes of his defence.
This amount is barely sufficient to pay for
some cheap solicitor and some low-priced
barrister ; if any lawyer of eminence and
capacity takes the matter up on such terms,
it is only through the rare emotion of
charity. The case for the Crown, on the
other hand, is prepared (while accused is
locked up in gaol) by some of the ablest
lawyers in the land, backed up by the police,
the detective department, and the whole
resources of the Treasury. The odds are
the entire consolidated revenue against £l5
155.; an unlimited quantity of the best legal
talent in the country against one cheap
practitioner; all the facilities for collect-
ing evidence which the detective force, the
railway and telegraph service, and the whole
Government machinery can afford against—
nothing. A Maxim gun against a bow and
arrow is nothing by comparison with this
ghastly discrepancy. The miserable allow-
ance for defence purposes is rather a loss to
the prisoner than a gain ; he loses the
limited amount of sympathy usually extended
by the jury to an undefended man, and he
remains practically undefended (or even
doubly-prosecuted) all the same.
* • •
Had Montgomery and Williams been
more adroitly defended their lives would
have been saved—always assuming that
among the jury were some men possessing
faint flickers of reason; for a verdict of
acquittal on the capital count would not have
saved the criminals from re-arraignment
under the clause prescribing life-servitude
for the offence of wounding while resisting
legal arrest. What happened in the Wil-
liams Montgomery case has happened in
many others. If the chances are to be
equal, so that the innocent man who is
accused by mistake will have as good a show
to get off as to be hanged, the legal talent
must be something like on a level. There
must be a Public Defender as well as a
Public Prosecutor, with the same resources at
command; and the system whereby the State
cheerfully supplies £2OO or £3OO to pre-
pare the facts against the accused, and
grudgingly puts up £l5 15s. to pay for
the preparation of the case in his favour,
must be abolished as an insult to
justice. As matters stand at present the
arithmetic of the matter is this : Barristers,
like other men, are sportsmen, and a law-
yer s business is to win his case whether he
is in the right or in the wrong. When the
public gladly pays one barrister thirty guineas
tor a day’s work and will only pay another
eight guineas, it simply means that, so far as
the public can estimate, the former is four
times as likely to win as the latter, the cir-
cumstances being equal. Therefore, when
the State hires the expensive lawyer and
gives the prisoner the cheap one, it simply
means that, apart from the evident merits
the case, the State gambles for the
prisoner’s life with four chances to one in its
favour. Any pauper arraigned for his life
should, at State expense, have a Queen’s
Counsel to defend him.
* * *
The position of the Executive as a Court
of criminal appeal is another quaint feature
in the complicated anomaly of the criminal
law. The second and informal trial which
the Cabinet always holds in capital cases is
as essential a part of the proceedings as the
formal hearing before a Judge and jury, for
the Cabinet is the only Court which is
authorised to take extenuating circumstances
into consideration. In the second trial the
defendant is not represented, and the
prosecutor the Attorney-General acts
as one of the Judges. The tribunal
holds its sittings absolutely in secret,
and gives no reasons for its judgments.
Whether the evidence is considered in detail,
or how the decision is arrived at, the Court
itself only knows. In a case like that of
Montgomery and his companion, where life
or death depended entirely upon the tech-
nical question as to the fairness of the
Attorney-General's indictment, the Attorney-
General, as the legal adviser of the Cabinet,
sat, for all the world knows to the contrary,
as one of a Court to decide an appeal against
himself. The members of the Cabinet have
mostly no legal training ; and they are not
even supposed to sit as an unbiassed tribunal,
as attempts are openly made to influence
them by petitions, political deputations,
torchlight processions, and the like. And
until Australia establishes a court of criminal
appeal and transfers to it the prerogative of
mercy now held by the Cabinet, this hap-
hazard method of administering justice is
without remedy.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
State Interference.
The tendency of the Labour movement is
always to run to extremes. The friends of
democracy are for ever inclined to exaggerate
its benefits, to forget that it has defects only
less than those of the systems of government
which it aims to replace. They ascribe to “the
State” a magical power, a supernatural honesty;
forgetting that it is only the sum of the units
which compose it, and that the stream of
government cannot possibly rise higher than
its source. They are perpetually endeavouring
to drive the nail further than it will go, to
cleanse the outside of the platter before the
inside, to substitute public legislation for in-
dividual morality. Democracy is just as faulty
as despotism, and contains precisely the same
element of human nature ; but it is juster,
and hence we have a sounder, broader basis to
work upon in our efforts to improve human
nature. The worst foes of democracy are those
which lurk within its own household in the
shape of ignorance and prejudice. Universal
suffrage does not create a millennium at a blow.
Municipal government in England may be more
tyrannical; but in America it is mere corrupt.
And if Jack Cade came again to abolish poverty
by selling seven halfpenny loaves for a penny,
giving the three-hooped pot ten hoops, and
making it a felony to drink small beer, it is
certain that many would flock to his standard.
One of the candidates before the Willoughby
(N.S.W.) Labour Electoral League has issued
a leaflet announcing his “views.” Among
other things, he believes that people should
travel free on the State railways ; that free
meals, as well as free education, should bo
given to State school - children; and that
“ beyond a miner’s right mining on private
property Bill ” all mines should be nationalised
and worked for the benefit of all. It is
evidently believed that this is only a question
of passing so many Acts in so many chapters
and so many clauses. It does not strike this
democrat that, taking the whole field of mining,
a profit is only secured by unremitting toil
and watchfulness unknown in the civil service.
Many mines now do not pay the owners : how
then could they pay the State, “ the Govern-
ment stroke ” being notoriously ineffective ?
Most railways are run at a loss; free
traffic would increase the loss. Eree meals
to children are an additional loss, besides
taking away the parent’s incentive to work,
and thus demoralising industry. But who
will bear these losses ? Oh, the State—
i.e., the taxpayer. Thus, side by side with
continually increasing nationalisation of i n .
dustry we are to have continually - in.
creasing taxation. The issue must ho
national bankruptcy. Obviously, such
programme, however inviting, is practically
absurd. Yet there are doubtless many who
believe its realisation possible, in spite of tho
lessons of history. Certainly the State can do
much. It can make just laws and reform unjust
ones. It can open and keep open to all the
avenues of industry. It can protect the weak
against the strong. It cannot make all equal
but it can give to all equal opportunities, ft
can place the poor man’s child and the" rich
man s on the same footing of natural ability
It can tax the inheritances of the wealthy for
the benefit of the labourers by whose efforts
they are chiefly amassed. It can prevent by
legislation the evils arising from the monopoly
ofW it cannot ensure human happiness
while human egoism remains a constant factor
The world can only be bettered by better men!
The Imperial Destitute.
In the first half of the current century the
colonies were regarded in England as pro-
videntially-devised retreats for impoverished
aristocrats, or the mawvais sujets of genteel
families possessed of a little backstairs influ-
ence. Downing-street and its representatives
across the seas were kept busy looking after
the welfare of these interesting emigrants, and
seeing that they duly obtained the billets
suited to their station in life. When the
“dependencies” grew too big for this sort of
patronage, and insisted on stocking their own
civil service preserves, Mrs. Mother Country
found herself suddenly cut off from a profitable
assortment of colonial perquisites. For a time
she bore the hardship as philosophically as
possible until, in the year of Queen Victoria’s
jubilee, a hungry London club coterie con-
ceived the brilliant idea of establishing, in the
metropolis itself, a magnificent institution in
honour of Imperialism which, it was thought, the
colonies might be humbugged into supporting.
Having the private ear of the Prince of
Wales, they easily persuaded him to give then-
precious conception forth to the world, and,
with a lot of appeals to loyalty and patriotism
and profuse flattery of “Greater Britain,” the
ingenious scheme was launched. For a moment
it looked as if the notion would catch on, and
the colonies be gulled into providing the funds
for a superior order of British benevolent
asylum. Initiatory thousands of current coin
rolled in from Australia, the Cape, and Canada,
and a big building, filled with sinecure offices,
sprang into existence and was gorgeously
inaugurated by royalty. But the colonies soon
discovered what fools they were making of
themselves, and, spite of the exhortations of
insinuating travelling touts, and the frantic
protests of their own bebaubled General
Agents in London, buttoned up their breeches-
pockets. Now it is threatened by cable that,
unless our Pactolean stream : s set flowing again,
the imposing Imperial Institute shall be con-
verted into a head-quarters for Masonry or
something of that kind. Let it.
Are Australians Cruel ?
Francis Adams and other critics have charged
Australians with having on their underside the
taint of cruelty. We have some characteristics
which go to confirm this view, many which
oppose it. The bush lad who carelessly kills a
horse by hard usage becomes, perhaps, no rarer.
But the same lad, grown to a bushman, loves
his horse as his father, his dog as his brother.
Mature bush opinion is dead against the man
who is cruel to tame animals. Wild animals
are different; they bring into play the old
savage hunter s instinct, which is not special
but racial. And what wonders of suffering and
self-denial will not the men on the outskirts of
Australian civilisation, the pioneers, perform
for a mate in distress ! In our towns, the larri-
kin, the young man, is again the type of cruelty.
But cruelty is innate in youth. The youth of
man corresponds with the youth of the world.
I here was a time when every man was an
Ishmaelite, fighting for his own hand, hardly by
constant warfare keeping at bay the forces of
armed Nature around him. When we are
young the memory of that time still lingers
with us. The youth has not learnt the lesson
of civilisation. But what becomes of the
larrikins? Comparatively few go to gaol : our
crime-average is remarkably low. '’Ask the
police, and they will tell you that many, most,
become hard-working, respectable citizens. The
touch of a woman at the right moment and all
is changed. The man asserts himself, with—
Eyes full of fatherhood and tender care
For small young children,
putting behind him early frolics and follies.
And, against the charge of cruelty, note the
keen public sense of private wrong reached in
Australia partly, perhaps, through universal
education ; partly, perhaps, through our raised
status of comfort, making contrast with misery
more keen ; and a little, perhaps, through the
revulsion from the horrors of our early history.
Compare Australia with England. Reprobation
of the worst class of assaults—those against the
person is far stronger here than there ; and
sentences are much more adequate. The
constant crucifixion of the English poor by
English property-owners pilloried every week
in London Truth—a remnant of the time when
the poor were property, in life and limb
absolutely at the disposal of slave-holding,
slave-breeding masters—could not happen in
Australia. Or take this case, from a letter
recently written to an English paper by one of
a coroner’s jury who inquired into the death of
a Dartmoor convict:—•
The prisoner was here about nine months, and for
ciyht months out of th&t time, as far as my memory
serves me he had been complaining of illness, and had
been punished for complaining. In the month of Novem-
ber alone he was, I think, punished seven times for com-
plaining of being ill and for not doing his work, his
punishment being confinement in a separate cell, bread
and water, and loss of marks. Ilis last punishment was
on November 27th when be was again sentenced to three
days separate cells, eight ounces of bread and a pint of
Indian meal mixed, to drink morning and evening, and
a plank bed. About mid day on the 30th he finished this
sentence, and was again ordered for work (reclaiming
ia asserted that he could not
walk out to the works, and had to be assisted. lie then


told the warder he could not work, and was (as is usual)
handcuffed, with his hands behind his back, and had to
remain there until the afternoon work was over. Next
morning he was found dead in his cell 1
Here is a record of the official murder of a
sick man which shows only too well how close
the England of to-day is to the England which
established the convict system in Australia. It
passed over unnoticed. Everybody was afraid
to lift a protesting voice; even the juryman
who exposed the cruelty did not dare to sign
his name. But conceive the whirlwind of fury
which would sweep over Australia were such a
thing reported here. Parliament would demand
instant inquiry ; and press and public would
not rest till justice was done. Perhaps public
sympathy occasionally errs. But it is the
charge of cruelty we are concerned with ; and
' certainly that does not agree with the strong
feeling against punishing even the worst
criminals, unless the legality of their trial and
the justice of their sentence are absolutely clear.
Cruelty craves for blood ; the majority of Aus-
tralians have a horror of bloodshed. Can the
charge, then, be sustained ?
♦
The Origin of a Hanging Law.
Hansard, that grim record of the lies and
corruption and imbecility of the political past,
tells an instructive story about the origin of the
New South Wales written law which makes
hanging the penalty for “ attempted murder,”
ami consequently of the unwritten law which
makes it also the penalty for an unpremeditated
free-fight where murder might have ensued but
didn’t. The Act in question was passed by the
Stuart Government in which the dreary H. E.
Cohen was Minister of Justice, During the
debate it was moved that the death-penalty
should be changed to life-long penal servitude,
but the proposition was extinguished in the
course of a violent speech by Mr. Cohen on
behalf of the Ministry. The following is an
instructive extract as showing the methods of
Cohenian logic :
On reading the clause honourable members will find
that there is in the offence the important ingredient of
attempting to commit murder. So far as the offender is
concerned he may have done all things in his power to
kill and with a view to commit murder, and the offender
may administer poison assuming that what he does will
be fully effectual in accomplishing his diabolical intention,
but owing to some accident beyond his control death does
not ensue. Will honourable members say that in that
case so far as the Act is bound up with so wicked an in-
tention the moral character of the offence is less heinous
or atrocious than if the offence has resulted in death ?
. . . We are only perpetuating the law as it exists in the
colony, and so far as we can gather we have not found that
the public have ever evinced any sense of injustice which
has led them to call for a change in the law such as is
suggested by the honourable member. He says the only
crime punishable in England with death is murder, or
vr tere life is actually sacrificed, and I believe that to be
i.ue case ; but I saw in a late edition of the Times, I think
it was, a review of the recent work entitled, “The History
of Criminal Law,” by Sir Filzjames Stephen (a relative
of Sir Alfred Stephen), and if that review was correct this
eminent gentleman has given expression to the opinion
that for some of tfte crimes which were formerly punished
by death, but with respect to which that penalty has
been abolished, it ought to be re-imposed, and he refers
not only to murder but also to attempts to murder, and
goes so far as to say that where persons become incor-
rigibly dishonest, and even in cases where extreme
violence was habitually used, the death-penalty ought to
be imposed. If we take this view as a reflex of a growing
opinion on the part of the British public, it appears that
some change is coming over that opinion, and there are
facts which favour the presumption.
This shows, in the first place, that the clause
was specially devised with a view to attempted
deliberate murder by poison—and in the case of
wilful poisoning, the intent is almost beyond
question; not for damage done in a chance
affray. And it shows, in the second place, how
the Stephen influence has lain heavy upon all
re.ent New South Wales history. The English
law, to which Australia generally goes with
slavish reverence for its precedents, pre-
scribed and prescribes death for actual murder
on'y. But its authority was over-ruled by the
obliging Cohen because a baleful relative of
that old, grim Yandemonian, Alfred Stephen,
had expressed his own unsupported opinion
that men should be hanged, not only for mur-
der, but also for attempted murder, violent
assault, and incorrigible dishonesty ! If the
dictum of old Mr. Stephen’s relative was of
any value, then it should have been accepted
in its entirety, in which case at least six of the
membersofParliament(piofethedivision-list)who
voted with Cohen would since then have been
suspended by the neck till they were dead for a
large assortment of callous swindles. But as
the House unfortunately didn’t accept Stephen’s
relative’s views in their entirety, it thereby
tacitly acknowledged that Stephen’s relative
was no authority to go upon. Mr. Cohen,
Ijpwever, blandly assumed that because
/tephen’s relative announced this blood-stained
and ghoulish doctrine, it was probably “a
reflex of a growing opinion on the part of the
British public,” and the House took his word
for it !!! Attempted murder is a capital
crime to-day in N.S. Wales partly because
Cohen said that he thought he had read
somewhere that somebody related to Alfred
Stephen had said it should be so, and because
he considered, on his own responsibility, that
the statement of Stephen’s relative was possi-
bly a reflex of British sentiment. As it proved
to be otherwise, and as Stephen’s relative is
exploded now, and Cohen is politically extinct,
it is about time to consider the matter afresh
from an entirely new standpoint, in which
Cohen, and the bloodstained traditions of the
Stephen family, will be left entirely out of the
question.
Jhe S.M. Herald’s recent ably-written article
insisting that a community should be governed
by law as existing in cold type, instead of by
the excited sentiment of the day, goes to the
very point the consideration of which has made
some of the deepest thinkers recoil from written
law altogether. The question comes thus to a
vigorous intellect: “Am Ito do so-and-so,
because someone, or a number of people, said
so-and-so before I was born ?” But, apart from
this tenable philosophical objection to being the
slave of the dead, the Herald dogina is er-
roneous on other grounds. Take any Australian
1 arliament. As likely as not that body was
partially drunk (or absent) when it placed any
law on the statute-book ; if it wasn’t partially
tlrunk or mostly absent, it is ten to one it was
dragooned at the time by some Minister,
who would capsize the Government and drive
members to the country if he was not allowed
lus way with his little Bill. In such circum-
stances a law is passed. When, however, the
application of that law requires to be made—
on the gallows—manhood takes the place of
expediency and voices rise in protest. The
men who were drunk are sorry they put the
Act on the statute-book ; the men who were
absent are sorry they were not present; the men
who were dragooned are sorry they obeyed, and,
with the last vestige of soul they own, they yell
to have the law set aside. And the yell is the
only saving trait about them.
Laws dealing with life and liberty should be
reviewed in every Parliament and confirmed or
modified in the light of added experience.
1 hose acquainted with legislative procedure
know what chances govern many votes and
how the majority of one year may be the
minority of the year following. It is often
worse than futile to say that simply because a
law is on the Statute Book it should, apart
from the especial circumstances of the time
or event, be executed to the letter. There
are scores of unrepealed enactments on
every Statute Book which no Government
would attempt to put in force—which
proves the hollowness of the protestation that
until an Act is repealed Ministers are bound
under oath to put it in operation. The main
body of N.S. W. criminal law is now eleven
years old, and in the myriad changes of opinion
in all other directions it is talking blindly to say
that the public mind is in this matter as it was
then. Parkes and Melville have both repu-
diated the doctrine of capital punishment since
that time, though both voted for that doctrine—
yea, voted to make capital even attempts to
murder ! —when the measure was before the
House, How many other members have also
changed ?
At Maryborough (Yic.) Queen’s Birthday
carnival a banner was carried in the pro-
cession with the inscription “ Back to the
Land.” The day previous, by the local bench
(theP.M. presiding), seven lads, ages from 16
to 20, who had wandered from various towns
“ back to the land,” were sent to gaol (for the
first time) to do six months hard. Their offence
was going into an untenanted house and cooking
a feed of cabbages “supposed to have been
stolen.” This scandalous sentence is an apt
commentary on Premier Patterson’s boast at
opening of Parliament that he had drafted
many of the unemployed from Melbourne to
profitable industries in the interior.
♦
Considine, at Broken Hill, was one. Hali., at
Parkes, is two. Two deaths in three months,
besides a score of indiscriminate wounds and
misses, is the price New South Wales pays for
Premier Dibbs’ hasty blunder in arming the
police. But for that both would probably be
alive to-day. Considine owes his death directly
to the edict; Hall probably owes his to the
reflex action on the burglar who shot him.
Against the advice of the head of the police
force, against the wish of its coolest officers,
Dibbs yielded to a personal impulse ; and,
having been clearly put in the wrong, stays
there because he is too obstinate to acknow-
ledge error. The blood of Considine is hardly
cold before an armed burglar, disturbed in a
country store, wounds John William Hall,
who merely “lingered in great agony ” till he
expired on May 29. Probably there is another
hanging in prospect, with another stirring-up
of public excitement, a fresh creation of ten-
dencies to crime, and a new determination on
the part of every burglar, present and prospec-
tive, to shoot rather than be shot; with more
slaughter and more hangings in increasing ratio
until somebody with a little more brains and a
little less vanity steps into Dibbs’ shoes. The
gallows is the father and the mother of murder.
Says The Queenslander (cx-Courier) :
The Kanaka is finding out his real market value
and refuses to re-engage on the original terms'
Why should he? He should get all that he is
worth. The idea of obtaining labour from New
Guinea on the seasonal system is finding favour with
the cane-growers. Six months in Queensland and six
months in New Guinea. This system would get rid of all
or most of the objections to the existing supply. The
natives would be recruited under the British flag. From
first to last they would be under Governmental super-
vision and regulation. And we may be sure that they
would soon discover their real value and exact it.
In the foregoing effusion there are several
remarkable statements. Firstly, the Kanaka
is to be got rid of because he has found out his
“ real market value and refuses to engage on
the old terms ” (coarse, unsuitable food ; conse-
quent chronic dysentery and cdrner in plantation
cemetery). To remedy this the Papuan is to
be imported, inasmuch as he doesn’t know his
real value. Secondly (for the comfort of object-
ing humanitarians), he will soon find out his
real value and exact it. Thirdly, and lastly,
the traffic will be perfectly clean and respectable,
inasmuch as the Papuan will be recruited under
that glorious British flag, beneath whose shadow
the heathen waxeth fat, even from Vandemonia
unto Matabeleland.

A FEW years ago some admiring friends got
Parkes’s portrait painted, and Parkes’s col-
league, Carruthers, bought the garish pre-
sentment out of the public funds without
Parkes’ official knowledge, and sent it to the
trustees of the New South Wales National
Gallery, where it was duly hanged. Now
Dibbs’s portrait is going to be hanged there
also, to keep it company. Dibbs’s portrait
was painted by a Sydney artist and purchased
by some enthusiastic admirers, who pre-
sented it to Dibbs with a suggestion that
Dibbs should present it to the gallery,
and Dibbs presented it accordingly. The
gallery - trustees are supposed to reject
pictures of insufficient quality, but these two
got through all right. Very likely they got
through on their merits, but at the same
time it is difficult to judge the portrait of a
Premier on its merits seeing that the original
can, if he likes, eject any dissenting trustee, or
make himself beastly unpleasant in other ways.
Therefore, no Premier with any tact or any of
the decent self-consciousness which ordinarily
characterises men who are regarded as gentle-
men, should send his own portrait to the
Gallery or let any of his colleagues send it
without his knowledge. He should let it be
sent by an admiring nation after he is dead—a
considerable time after he is dead, if possible.
lo hang your own portrait in a public place of
memorial is as grossly egotistic as to carve with
your own hands a flattering inscription for your
own gravestone. Anyone who likes to draw a
fancy sketch of Dibbs tearing around and damn-
ing Shikargo when his picture came back with
aji intimation that the subject wasn’t of suffi-
cient public interest, or some other such message,
can understand how difficult it is to take an
unbiassed view of a Premier’s portrait when
it is forwarded by himself.

A Melbourne jury, the other day, found two
men guilty of a serious offence, but recom-
mended them to mercy. Thereupon Chief
Justice Madden explained to the accused that
he had intended to give them a long term in
gaol and a flogging apiece, but in view of the
jury’s recommendation he would leave out the
flogging and reduce the sentence to two years.
This common-sense procedure was evidently
based on the fact that Australian law
is built on a mechanical principle which
takes no account at all of extenuating cir-
cumstances, and the only way in which a
jury can take extenuating circumstances
into account is by the above form of “recom-
mendation.” In New South Wales, according
to the Montgomery-Williams precedent, the
convicts would have got the flogging and the
long sentence just the same. The principle of
Botany Bay law, as laid down by the latest
executions, is that extenuating circumstances
don’t count for anything, and that a jury’s
recommendation to mercy is so much wasted
sentiment. The Bulletin advises future
Botany Bay juries to dole out their own mercy,
and to trust neither Judge nor Executive.
A Victorian clergyman has touched a respon-
sive chord in the soul of the aggregate preacher
by denouncing the cheap advertising parson.
Many of the Melbourne shepherds now make a
speciality of cheap marriage to suit the times,
and announce in the lost-dog column of the
Age that they are prepared to fix up, for half-
a-sovereign, or even less, all young men who
desire to give away half their victuals in
order to get the other half cooked. The
parson aforesaid abuses these individuals
as “self-styled clergymen,” and declares
that the Government which allows them
to follow their holy calling is “ legitima-
tising immorality.” It is difficult to follow the
logic of this angry expounder from Kyneton,
but apparently he represents the large and
infuriated section of the church which charges
from £2 to £5 for the marriage-service, and
he utterly loathes the “ scab ” preacher who
threatens to cut down rates. Why a 10s.
marriage should be immoral when a 40s. one isn’t
is not apparent to the lay intelligence, nor does
it appear very distinctly why the cheap preacher
is any more “self-styled” than the expensive one.
It the margin between morality and immorality
is just 305., then the two are so very much
alike that the difference isn’t worth discussing.
The principal considerations in the conduct of a
marriage ceremony are that it shall be per-
formed by a clean clergyman, and that there
shall be someone at the door to keep out the
dogs and small boys who want to enter and
prowl around. These conditions being ful-
filled, the rest doesn’t matter much. The
10s. marriage and the 40s. marriage and
the £5 one are, in most cases, all
failures alike, and the boiling - over of the
Kyneton pastor seems to be a purely selfish
yearning after his vanished coin. It is the
unhappy peculiarity of the parson that he
always professes to regard his lost coin from a
high spiritual standpoint, but to the general
public the shepherd who denounces his cheap
rival on religious grounds is just as sordid and
as commonplace as the sixpenny barber who
swears at the threepenny barber next door.
Marriage is, in any case, a tolerably ridiculous-
looking function and a source of ribald mirth
to the crowd at the door, and even if the tariff
were put up to £lOO it wouldn’t be improved to
any great extent.

MTlwraith was much impressed with Canadian
railway management, which has brought the
system of political jobbery to perfection, put
hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets
of promoters, syndicators, and land-sharks, and
draws the whole wealth of the country into the
net of private monopoly. He thinks he under-
stands now how to develops Queensland re-
sources by building more railways, while
millions of acres of the best agricultural
land in the world lie barren on the Darling
Downs, Peak Downs, and elsewhere, with
a railway running through the middle of them,
locked against cultivation by grabbers holding
for a rise. Clap a land-tax on monopoly, and
force it to sell at a reasonable price to the
farmers, who are now breaking their hearts
over hard ground far from the arteries of traffic—
that is the way to develops Queensland re-
sources. As to the mineral lands, if they are
alienated the State must reserve the right of
royalty on products ; and if the line is built in
exchange for land-grants the State must own
and control it.

imprisonment? Because, it may be answered, they didn’t

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
June 5,1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
A small dispute cropped up in the papers the
other day over the tobacco question—why should
the smoking section “pollute” the atmosphere
that “ God has made pure for me and all ” ? That
was what “ Non-smoker ” wanted to know—
egged on by the letter of “ Young Englishwoman ”
who had to give up a good view of Colquhoun’s
calves at the Tennis Tourney because a nasty
brute was puffing smoke down her ears. “Is it
the custom,” she asked indignantly, “for Aus-
tralian gentlemen to smoke in the vicinity of
strange women ?”
If she had asked me that weird question I should
have distinctly answered, “ Yes, they do it in self-
defence.” Strange women frequently take about
with_ them an atmosphere of stale stephanotis
fighting with a liberal douche of fresh Frangipani.
And even if they are unperfumed they generally
manage to stifle you with various strange-smelling
moth-paralysers that hang to their furs and bring
a keenly-smelling man to his cigar-ease to drown
the overpowering bouquet of the ladies in front of
him. For man is a sharp-nosed animal—much
keener on the scent than his female half. I know
a Sydney man who sits in his upstairs office and
“smells ” you when you enter the main entrance,
at the foot of a reasonably long flight of stairs.
You needn’t be specially perfumed, or specially
anything—he simply knows the individual aroma
of a large circle of people, and knows before they
knock who is going to enter, and whether to go
under the table or not.
Ik seems to me that stale scent versus fresh
tobacco would make a very even squabble—if any-
body has any business to quarrel over the state of
the atmosphere. Bub I really don’t see why all
the violent adjectives should be heaped on to the
smokers. My little crusade is going to be against
the women who eat peppermint lozenges in any
compartment not specially set apart for the purpose
and the men who breathe whisky down my back
when the curtain goes up in the third act.
In court, ladies are privileged to write dubious
evidence in blushing pencil, but it’s not always
only their natural modesty that demands it—it is
sometimes the maiden shame of their legal adviser.
Only the other day an Australian Judge went out
of his way to congratulate a divorce-plaintiff on
the “'chaste and reserved way ” she submitted one
or two overproof details in faint pencil. “Any-
oody could see” (even a divorce-court Judge!)
“ that she was a chaste and respectable woman.”
And all the time it was her “ reserved ” solicitor
who had heard how freely her tale of woe out-
poured itself, and who had given her a strong tip to
olushingly write what she might otherwise have
reeled off orally in answer to questions. When
the cab is out of the bag men, to put it mildly, are
sven more bashful than women.
A really clever divorce-lawyer wants to be a
£ood stage-manager as well as a bond-breaker.
“You can’t appear in court in that dress,” lately
screamed a Sydney lawyer at a too stylishly-
ittired plaintiff who was got up more for the
Block than to tell a woeful story to his Honor.
And, what’s more, the lady went back post-haste
ind changed her garments ! And there is one
ocal shark with a good eye for effect who turned
i smart-looking, up-to-date divorcee into a meek,
lowdy victim simply by advising the lady to
out her hat on back-to-front!
Among the variegated crowd who worried “ The
Cabinet Minister,” at Sydney Lyceum, Emma
Temple wore the most up-to-date garment, to my
mind. A sort of Russian blouse gone to seed on
:he skirts, of pale grey stuff cleverly trimmed with
steel passementerie and silver fox, and toque hat
punctuated with violets, was very neat and dis-
tinctly the most fashionable rigging in a rather
garishly-apparelled play. For example, Mrs.
Brough in a parrot-pink and lettuce-green court
Jress (I don’t think Queen Victoria, who is fond
af seeing a lot of her lady subjects would have
been satisfied with the moderate display of collar-
bone at the Lyceum, by the way) looked like the
Queen of the May, Mother. Jenny Watt-Tanner
(who gabbled so that I couldn’t make out what she
was saying half the time) unconsciously sported
Carbine’scolours; Grace Noble’s white brocade was
insipidly debutanteish, and I thought the most
astonishing thing in the much-prattled-of Court-
scene was the way the he - actors steered their
course amidst yards and yards of stuff without
treading on any “cats’ tails.” Apropos, savants
say that everything has an equipoise, which
accounts for the fact that while all the women in
the “Minister” were positively gasping under
yards and yards of stuff, the clothes of the men
had rushed up above their knees. I think Frank-
lyne made the most symmetrical show when the
kilts came on, though none of the B. & B. he-
actors suggested potstick similes when they aban-
doned trousers for the nonce.
There was more or less pretty dressing in the
other acts, but I seemed to scent sartorial resur-
rections in more than one instance, and I only pin
my complete approval to a red geranium (the
fashionable flower of the moment) growing perkily
out of Mrs. Brough’s black-jet bonnet. By the
way, it was lovely to observe how society strained
its ears while Mrs. Brough catalogued the table
solecisms committed by Dot Boucicault, and
I was really sorry “ Lady Tworabley ”
didn’t add a genial tip about sucking up
soup like a human sponge. Because there
was a representative man who is built that
way hanging over the circle edge, and I did so
want him to have his guilt brought home to him,
so to speak. It wouldn’t be half a bad plan if the
B. and B, Co. laid itself out to give a little
sugar-coated lesson on manners and tone in every
comedy. Sydney society always listens so breath-
lessly when vulgarities are being catalogued (lest
it shouldn’t know when to laugh) that it wouldn’t
miss a pointer, I’m sure.
Renouf played the femininely-unattractive part
of a man wandering in thick-soled boots among
groves of patent-leather, and the only thing he
said that interested me was when he complained
of the floury flunkey who froze him on the mat.
A man who has been the guest of dukes in Lon-
don told me that he never felt nervous about any-
body in any great house, except the overpowering
servants. The duke or marquis, or whatever he
might happen to be foregathering with, was
always delightful, but the footman invariably
made him feel as if his neat pasteboard was a
begging letter. If dukes were in the habit of
answering their own street-doors society at ’Ome
would be ten times less exclusive.
“The Flying Scud,” at Her Majesty’s, isn’t a
vehicle for the display of much wardrobe—there
are nineteen men to five women in the bill. The
ineffable Mr. Westmacott’s soup-plate bouton-
niere of white ’mums rose up and obscured the
collar-plants of the other men in the 4th act, bub
why didn’t Mo Davis rush into a willie-wagtail
suit as the rest did, when the action of the play
demanded it? A Hebrew who lends to the aris-
tocracy generally gets into his shiny shirt and
diamond studs before the sun sets —and so does
one who doesn’t, for that matter. The Children
of Israel are given to generous displays of naked
neck and wide, deep visions of boiled shirt-fronts
with a red silk-handkerchief thrust in for effect
four inches lower than the big diamond stud, so
Mo quite failed to convince me when he attended
a swell card-party in an ostler checked suit that
didn’t even match itself.
Talking of the Chosen, Semitic circles in Bara-
taria have been stirred to their uttermost depths
by the wild conduct of two young ladies who both
fell in love with Gentile youths, contrary to the
by-laws and the meaning of the Act. The first
damsel (well-known in society) has eloped with
her Gentile, and her people have steeped them-
selves in deepest mourning to show what they
think of her goings-on, but I think the elopee is
the one to wear the weeds. By her rash act she
forfeits a substantial income left her by a near
relative.
The career of the second damsel is more compli-
cated. She also loved a Christian, but papa dis-
covered the amourette, showed Adolphus out, and
packed her off to a distant place for sober reflec-
tion. But he reckoned without the postman.
However, the lady is married now—bub nob to
Adolphus. The whole story is one of the funniest
I ever heard.
Tattersall’s races at Rand wick, on 2nd June,
appeared to be a hansom-cab function alleviated
by Gov. Duff in a carriage-full of top-hats only—
no ladies gracing the V.R. party. By the way.
His Ex. passing through the street is a singularly
chilly performance—nobody says, “ ’Ere’s the
Guv’nor!” and the vision of a silk hat flashing
official salutations to the multitude, whether the
crowd nods back or not, is a vanished spectacle at
present. The potentate who bowls smoothly at
an old-gentlemanly pace through the streets, look-
ing fixedly at his Jehu’s shoulder-blades, and
with his hat nailed on with tacks, apparently—
well, he may keep his head warm on a crisp day.
But he doesn’t dazzle the populace, nor does he
truly represent royalty—(which is always curving
its spine at its subjects)—by effacing himself into
the semblance of an ordinary citizen who has no
legal right to flourish his hat at persons to whom
he hasn’t been previously introduced.
Talking about vice-regality, I certainly find it
amusing to read in London society papers that at
a reception given by some ambassadress or other,
the list of “ fashionable beauties ” who were pre-
sent leads off with Lady Carington who, at recent
advices, was peroxided to the last curl of her
frizette and persistently pink-cheeked.
If “ Lily ” really is a beauty on her native
cobble-stones and no deception, ladies and gentle-
men, the secret of why she used to so amiably and
unerringly snub a certain genuinely good-looking
Sydney woman is fully explained—beauty doesn’t
like a successor near the throne, especially one who
doesn’t paint her ears pink. And all this tittle-
tattle about good looks reminds you that the hus-
band, perhaps, of the handsomest woman in
N.S. W. is a son of the plainest!
But being handsome isn’t everything nowadays.
For one thing, it doesn’t mean a rush of excited
jeunesse in the wake of the idoless, this
side of the line at any rate. The moon of Austra-
lian beauty has its male satellites certainly, but
they take all sorts of care that their adoration
doesn’t leave them out of pocket when it’s all
over. At a recent Southern charity-ball (to give
an example of what I mean), a very pretty matron
got up a fancy dance, in which a posse of youths
and maidens of her acquaintance took part. But
rounding up the men was the hardest part of the
drafting. The number of sprained ankles and
weak knees that suddenly broke out among her
worshippers must have suggested to the pretty
matron aforesaid that it wouldn’t be safe to trot
any of her slaves down-hill without consulting a
vet., and as for expecting them to dance without
crutches ! Nevertheless, a marvellous cure
took place when the lady gently insinuated that
the necessary pasteboard would be supplied gratis
by her to all taking part in the dawnce; and when
the ball came off, not one of the set of johnnies
was missing ! It strikes me that the youth who
joins in a dance on condition that the organizeress
pays his footing for him, is in a straight line with
Tommy Atkins, who charges the British slavey a
shilling an|hour for walking her out.
The Mayor of Auckland and the Mayor of
Onehunga (Mrs. Yates) danced together at St.
George’s Rowing Club ball, in Auckland last
week. The first partnership of the kind in
British dominions ! On the evening in question
the lady mayor was presented to the Governor,
who tendered his congratulations to Mrs. Yates —
who, when all is said and done, seems to have
filled with much success a position which the
Onehunga men have lost no opportunity of making
difficult.
A certain Arcadian retreat of vice-royalty pos-
sesses (or did until lately possess) a servants’ club —
a highly respectable institution, which occasion-
ally breaks (or broke) forth into festivities parody-
ing the doings of the Hite. When his Excellency’s
orderly appeared the music burst forth wildly into
“ God Save the Queen” to give tone to the pro-
oeedings, and I believe that her Excellency’s maid
is or was invariably received with a “bokay.”
They had a ball at the Servants’ Club nob an
age back, but it will be long before relations will
become unstrained in one or two drawing-rooms in
consequence. The story goes that certain
“masters,” in their capacity of guardians of the
household and encourager of innocent amusements
among their retainers, called at the hall to make,
sure that the pretty housemaid was provided with
a proper escort home. Mine, &c.
In point of feminine interest, the most thril-
ling divorce-case on record is Russell v. Russell,
which had been entered on at San Francisco just
before the departure of last mail. Plaintiff was
the husband, who, in no small degree, rested his
case on his wife’s alleged cruelty, which is
itemized, and in one particular specified thus (I
quote the Argonaut) :
Bleached or artificially-coloured hair is easily distin-
guished as such, and does not appear natural, nor does it
deceive any person, but it is perfectly patent and notice-
ably conspicuous. It is regarded by the majority of
right-thinking persons as an indication of a loose, disso-
lute, and wanton disposition, and is regarded as, and
commonly held to be, a practice never affected by modest,
pure, and respectable women.
After expressing this general view of the practice
of women who bleach their hair, Mr. Russell
takes up its particular application to him. In his
document he avers :
Mrs. Russell is a brunette naturally. Her hair is of a
chestnut-brown colour, which, in its normal state, is
modest and becoming, and harmonizes with the natural
colour of her skin and eyes. Since we married she has,
against my wishes and protests, and with intent to vex,
annoy, exasperate, and shame me, dyed her hair and
changed its shade toaconspicuousandshowy straw oroanary
colour. As a consequence of this artificial colouring, she
has been obliged to paint her face to secure an artificial
complexion in keeping with the artificial colour of her
hair. The combination has given her a giddy, fast, and
sporty appearance.
This, Mr. Russell deposes, constitutes cruelty,
inasmuch as the bleaching “ greatly mortified,
shamed, and humiliated him, and caused him
great and grievous mental suffering.” The de-
cision of this point, remarks the Argonaut,
will be a most interesting one. If the
court holds with Mr. Russell and decides that
bleached hair gives a “ giddy, fast and sporty
appearance,” and thereby constitutes cruelty,
will not the court find itself in an embarrassing
position? There are other devices besides the
bleaching of hair which women employ to add to
their attractiveness in the eyes of men. Paints,
powders and plumpers, false hips and false hair-
all of these and many other mysterious things
might be brought under judicial notice. If it is
“ cruel” to a husband for a wife to bleach her hair,
is it cruel for her to wear a false bang ? If she is
semi-bald, is it cruelty to him for her to wear a
wig? And if it is not “cruelty” for a woman to
bleach her hair, are not the terms “ bleached
blonde,” “soda-water hair,” and “chemical
blonde,” when applied to her, actionable as
libelous ? Also, is a woman’s hair her own pro-
perty or her husband’s ? And if she is unmarried,
does her hair belong to her guardian ?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, June 5, 1894.
Queen’s Birthday, though decidedly damp, saw
its usual programme pursued to the bitter end.
The review was to have been politely abandoned
if the weather had given any valid excuse, and I
believe the prayer that it would pour cats and
dogs was going up all morning from the Big House.
Nevertheless, the clouds rolled up.
His Excellency abhors dampness, and at the
first rain-drop upon his scarlet and gold he
wrapped a long, blue, martial cloak around him.
’Tis said, a local chemist has a substantial source
of revenue in vice-regal custom, apart from the
items of vaseline and cold cream. The chieftain,
in spite of a whole hour’s massage every morning,
frequently lies low with a stunning fit of indi-
gestion.
Which reminds me that some of the toniest
guests at a fashionable wedding on Queen’s Birth-
day eve, complained bitterly that, owing to exces-
sive overnight hilarity, the expensive marriage-
feast was as tasteless as bran-mash.
To return to the review, Lady Hopetoun, in a
tall hat and habit, much longer than has been
worn of late, a basque jacket and white vest, rode
ignominiously at the fag end of the military staff.
Some people thought she looked lonely with no
other skirts to keep her company, but I don’t
fancy the exclusive matron felt her solitude very
keenly. She would fain be alone in many things.
Once, at a vice-regal dinner-party, the woman
guests suffered a deal of torture through her in-
considerate behaviour. The “ both sexes ” part
of the feast was nearly over, but as the .hostess,
apparently, hadn’t begun putting on her gloves
preparatory to a drawing-room move, the unsus-
pecting sisterhood thought there was no hurry.
Suddenly the Countess rose, and they saw, to
their horror, that she had surreptitiously slipped
on a pair of silk gloves under the table. Though
secretly fuming they gathered up their paw-pro-
tectors, bangles, &c., as best they could and
followed her from the apartment looking, as they
said afterwards, like a lot of bare-handed washer-
women. It was no better in the drawing-room,
where they had to struggle into their raany-
buttoned kids, while their hostess, in her loose
silk gloves, gazed critically upon the scene. Ever
since, when any one of that batch of women dines
at Govt. House, she wears gloves a size too large
and sneaks them on ere the Countess has added
the final to her meal.
The arrangements for would-be spectators of the
review were on a strictly military system. To
each sentry-guarded acre (more or less) of barrier
was an admittance-wicket, so narrow as to recall a
certain Bananaland cave-entrance, known to the
vulgar as “ Fat Man’s Agony. ”
A visitor, chancing on one of these few and far
between posterns, was passed on to the next, until
late in the afternoon, if sufficiently persevering, he
arrived at a gate inscribed with the same letter as
his card. Some of the sentries, being good-
natured, winked hard if anyone tried to shorten
this procedure by a short out through the barrier.
But red-faced “superior officers” invariably
rode up on snorting steeds, and made such a war-
like to-do that one was glad to retire under mute
protest. In fact, “ the reserve” was a snare and a
delusion, and non-ticket-holders, who didn’t waste
time hunting a myth, came off best.
The Grammar School cadets led the show by
“ trooping the colours,” which solemn ceremony,
performed to the strains of their bands, looked
like a dancing-class practising the first step of the
minuet—“ Brandish the leg well from the hip,” as
Mons. Light-toe always says. The Oft. 4in.
drum-major, executing wild hkton antics, evidently
laid himself out for theatrical effect, and was
popularly hailed as the funny man of the circus.
Just such another is the black-gowned Cathedral
verger, whose duty it is to escort the preacher to
and from the pulpit, carrying for purposes of de-
fence en route a quaint trident, which looks as if
its proper place were a Xmas pantomime, where
made red-hot and applied to a policeman’s ana-
tomy by the clown, it might win a smile from the
Uas6 cherubs of the circle.
In the march-past the horses trotted well to a
lively Highland sohottisohe, though some of their
riders were too practical to make good soldiers.
Instead of sitting tight in the saddles, they rise in
the stirrups in purely civilian style, contrary to
all the rules of “military trot,” The culprits
were generally stout ancients, who perhaps begin
to weary of waiting for the foe, and have lost
their youthful ardour for soldierlike appearance.
Everyone still chants the praises of Belle Cole
and party, who were so delightfully American
don’t you know. This undying popularity may
be traced to their Salon visit, passed over at the
time as unimportant.
On that occasion, Belle and her companions
didn’t say much, but they beamed wholesale. A
doctor’s wife, the hostess for the day, had arranged
a throne of chairs for the distinguished visitors
only to find at the critical moment that the Holy
of Holies had been “ jumped ” by a posse of
maidens, who chattered away in possession as if
the whole shivoo were a private tongue-tourna-
ment. As soon as more seats arrived, the lum-
inaries were welcomed to the Salon, and presented
with its honorary membership on white satin.
The feature of the afternoon’s entertainment
was a young girl’s clever violin solo. Newbury,
conscious that everyone was thirsting for his
opinion, jerked out, at intervals, “Clever!”—
“ Clever!”—“ Clever!” His bump of self-esteem
seemed to trouble him rather that day.
Conspicuous among the throng wasj,the jimp
Melb. girl whose stage career promises so well.
It’s a mistake for an actress, especially a young
and pretty one, to go in for daylight “ make up ”
off the boards, though it may be all very well for
people like the Irish lady in the song, who “put
the pouther on, in case the bhoys should say that
she was schwarthy!”
Good folks differ so widely nowadays, that one
doesn’t know how to be orthodox, especially on
the Sunday question. I hear even of complaints
that the judges of our courts are not blameless.
One is led away by “pleasant Sunday ” pastimes;
a second, on his own showing, devotes the “ Day
of Rest ”to Speight v. Syme. Another, while on
circuit sometime back, spent a good deal of his
Sawbath in practising the Barn Dance on the
bridge of a Murray steamer, aided and abetted by
a young lady passenger. Talking of the Murray,
the Mildura Water Commission (rather a mis-
nomer, by the way) which travelled up the river
lately, had a particularly festive Sunday en route.
A Mildura news-organ remarks, that the week of
the Commissioners’ visit will be remembered as a
“ wet ” one for the settlers, “ most of whom (the
paragraph goes on to say) will drink with im-
punity, or any other man that asks them, as A,
Ward says.”
“ A Life of Pleasure” positively scorched some
Westralian friends of mine who ventured into the
Princess’ the other night. Among the party was
a tall and handsome engaged couple both belong-
ing to “old families ” of the West, and neither of
whom had ever left home before. The interesting
pair sat together in front, their married friends,
almost equally unsophisticated, chaperoning from
the rear. As the temperature of the play went
higher and higher, the women began to writhe
like so many Cranmers at the stake, and though
the men tried to look as if that sort of thing was
quite usual in Perth, the perspiration stood in
beads upon their brows. When the agony con-
cluded and these artless strangers were able to
cool their feelings in the outer darkness, the
betrothed damsel vowed in a stage whisper that
next time she went to a Melb. theatre she’d have
no male friends to witness her confusion. Modesty
is very much a matter of circumstances, after all.
The Westralian vice-regal couple still prefer to
hunt singly. When “His Ex.” is in London
getting a song published and so forth, especially
so forth, her Ladyship fills his shoes at Perth.
When the flag flies once more over Government
House, the devoted wife resigns her responsibili-
ties and seeks rest and change of air at “ Govern-
ment Cottage ” (Rottnest). Local gentility
complains now that a young person need only
warble “Remember me no more” tunefully,
within hearing of its volatile composer, to be at
once hoisted into the highest circles and put upon
the same footing as “ birth.” They are sticklers
for birth in that one-horse region.
I hear that one of the first women to appear in
the Far Western Golconda went there from Haw-
thorn (Melb.) as the bride of a pioneer store-
keeper. Her papa, formerly a policeman in
Westralia, became a martyr to the hope that his
gal would marry a real gentleman, with which end
in view he came to Victoria, and started afresh in
a suburban villa. After all, the young woman,
wiser in her generation than the paternal con-
stable, fell back on an old sweetheart, and now
she watches him rake in goldfield profits and
famine prices, with the cheering consciousness
that he is qualifying for the position of “gentle-
man ” at the rate of .£2OO weekly.
Young Groom, Queensland barrister, formerly
of Ormond College, Melb., and son of ex-Speaker
Groom, of Queensland, is engaged to a Miss Bell,
of South Melb.
Charity balls, plentiful as blackberries just
now, are sometimes engiheered so as to provide
cheap, and, at the same time, select, amusement for
“reconstructed ” notables. The promoters of a
recent dance of this kind blackballed all ticket-
applicants not known to the committee. “Really,
my deah fellah ! ” said one of the latter, “could
we admit Tom, Dick, and Harry to a superior ball
like this, for four shillings?” He evidently for-
got that a .£ls hall had been granted free, to raise
as much as possible for a charitable object; not
merely for the economic entertainment of himself
and cronies.
Nearly all the men wore uniform at the Birth-
day ball, and more than one girl left with the
scratched cheek that testifies to the epauletted
partner. An ingenuous generalisation, you will
say. There was grumbling, too, because swords
weren’t removed at the end of the first dance.
Professional militaires can, as a rule, manage
these murderous superfluities with safety, but the
amateurs, whose cold steel wobbles between their
knees at critical moments, are perils to be dis-
creetly avoided. Any woman who has been mixed
up in a ball-room accident of this kind trembles
in the custody of a whirling warrior for the rest
of her dancing days. A grass-widowed fire-eater
figured as one of the most “ dangerous ” creatures
in the whole display, and 1 heard him described as
“a sweet man” by several spinsters who
forgot that there was a wife in the case.
Lady Hopetoun looked handsome in yellow satin
and diamonds, and the Chief Justice-ess had the
felicity of sporting the same colour, trimmed with
black velvet, black roses and a large display of
diamonds also.
Out of compliment to Premier Patterson’s new-
made glory, perhaps, the sun was good enough to
shine upon the opening of Parliament, and the
Governor’s old-time chariot had a fine day out.

As future pro-consuls are to be “retrenched,”
State-coaches can’t be reckoned upon for the
future, hence we gloat over the Hopetoun specimen
while we may. It was trimmed with blue and
yellow ribbons as of yore. As for the fab coach-
man, footmen and postillions, in powdered hair
and flesh-coloured stockings, they had, seemingly,
all been invested with a touch of rouge to give an
effect of “old English” ruddiness. His Ex.’s
uniform appeared dazzling enough until compared
with the raiment of M. Poutiata, the Russian
Consul, when it degenerated into a mere carica-
ture of pomp and bewitched us no more. Lady H.,
who drove up to the function with Secretary
Ralston and little Lord Hope, was in black with
dashes of blue and a black hat and feathers.
Inside the House every nook was packed to
overflowing, so that if you weren’t on the spot
ever so early you got no farther than the steps.
The struggle was too much for yours truly, and I
ultimately retired with a wounded spirit. Con-
solation came afterwards in the form of Mr.
Zeal’s afternoon tea. This was also a mad rush,
but the average woman is a hero where tea is con-
cerned, and very few candidates went away with a
dry throat. One fair swiller followed up her
success by putting the spoon in her pocket.
Dame Madden’s violet velvet was one of the
handsomet gowns to be seen, and her daughter’s
fawn-corded silk, its velvet shoulder capes lined
with pink, was almost equally effective.

Pinero’s “ Cabinet Minister,” which put in
a somewhat confused appearance at Sydney
Lyceum on Saturday, is not an unmixed success
by a long, long way. There are too many charac-
ters in it, and an effort has been made to crowd
three distinct farces into one, with the result that
all three have been considerably squashed. Alto-
gether, it is a good comedy badly spoilt. It
wants sequence, and doesn’t hang together
artistically. Also, it is one long-continued insult
to Jews and Scotchmen, and at every interval
Celts and Hebrews held impromptu indignation
meetings on the pavement outside, and cursed it
by the bagpipes, and the Talmud, and the brose,
and the Urim and Thummim, and whatever else
came handy.
*• , •
The principal narrative concerns the em-
barrassed wife of a Cabinet Minister, who secretly
borrows money off a small Hebraic cad, and, being
thereafter haunted and.driven mad by him and his
dreadful sister, tries to repair her fallen fortunes
by marrying her daughter to a huge, red; freckled
and comatose Highlander whose hairy knees are a
blot on the 'smiling landscape. The rest is all
promiscuous confusion and kilts. Even the small
Hebrew gets into kilts, and tries to tell sporting
stories, in the midst of which his gun goes off and
shoots the morose Celt somewhere in the petticoat.
Another episode which stands out of the general
chaos is the enthusiastic shaking of the Jew, in
his brief skirt, by Mrs. Brough, but otherwise
there is little that can be got hold off. The
characters are mostly frantic caricatures, and at
least six of them are altogether superfluous; the
dialogue is ineffective in many places ; and the
action mostly resembles a skurry of wooden
ghosts through a high-class furniture emporium.
Most of the persons concerned are reasonably
suspected of lunacy, an exception being made in
favour of the Scotchman who seems only to have
anchylosis all over the body and to have been born
asleep.
• * *
The company tackles the comedy with an
evident appreciation of the difficulties of the
position. Titheradge’s minister is an ancient
and sketchy dodderer who is weighed down
by circumstances ; and Brough’s freckled
Highlander is damaged by the worst Scotch
accent on record. Mrs. Brough confesses her
sins to Titheradge in a prostrate attitude
while beating the palms of her hands on
the carpet, and otherwise conducts herself
wildly, though her performance in her calmer
moments is excellent. But her part is one which
can’t be played upon any recognised principles
any more than a earn'd can go down-hill with a
jug of water loose on its back and not spill the
contents. Among the leading characters, the
only one which runs on straight and intelligible
lines is Boueicault’s Jew in kilts, and Dion G.
evidently lays himself out to make of him the
most memorable little cad on record. He
succeeds so well that Israel gnashed its teeth
at him from the circle, and Israel’s pretty
daughters, with the unredeemed jewellery on
their heaving bosoms, viewed him with evi-
dent disfavour. Miss Romer, with another Scotch
accent in only moderate repair, appears to advan-
tage in a bony character which is a further insult
to the Caledonian contingent. There is only one
altogether bright and restful spot in the whole
uneasy production, and that is occupied by Miss
Noble, as daughter Imogen, This pretty little
lady forms a pleasant background to the heaving
chaos of the show, and when she is violently
shaken in the last act it creates a general senti-
ment of indignation. If all the rest of the comedy
were shaken instead it would be more in keeping
with poetic justice—if there is such a thing. A
baby which is dragged in for no good_ or coherent
reason is hereby dismissed as too insignificant for
execration.

“Flying Scud,” a drama which has at-
tained to a green and not much respected old age,
was put on last Saturday at Sydney Majesty’s,
under circumstances which showed it at its best.
On its own merits it is a sufficiently respectable
drama, but it has been a resource for so many
battered scratch companies, and has been played
in so many dingy barns with sackcloths and dish-
cloths for scenery, apd so many spavined and
fiddle-headed cab-horses have feebly professed to
be the famous racer, that it has fallen into un-
deserved disrepute. The present version at Her
Majesty’s does a lot to rehabilitate the misused
production. It is perfect in every mechanical
detail, and is run by a good company for all it is
worth. Therefore, the old piece looks as if it had
solemnly sworn off the husks and the swine and
started a reformed existence. Mo Davis, in the
person of Albert Marsh, is a reasonably clean and
persuasive Jew, and one who might possibly make
a living on the turf, whereas the usual Mo is an
unclean horror with a glazed earthenware head.
Miss Emma Chambers is a plump and pleasing
stable boy, and Scot Inglis turns out _ Captain
Goodge as an affable and polished villain whom
it is a pleasure to meet. The rest of the co. i s
satisfactory, and the general aspect of things i s
altogether magnificent. Even the race-scene has
a possible look about it, which isn’t the charac-
teristic of stage race-scenes in general.

Miss Jennie Maynard, an English lady of
considerable repute, opens at Sydney School of
Arts next Saturday with a humorous entertain-
ment built on the lines of Corney Grain and the
famous Geo. Grossmith. The company includes
Miss Naylor, pianiste; Harry Fitzmaurice, a
baritone gentleman ; and Miss Clare Navette, an
English dancing lady who is alleged to be built
somewhat on the plans and specifications of the
lost, but not forgotten, Bartho; and the co.’s
printed programme looks all that can be desired.
** * *
Sydney Town Hall will be occupied on
June 28th by Miss Ada Bell’s “Flowerland”
show, a medley of art, music, botany and fashion.
Miss Bell is a lady artist who has pluck and
energy enough to run a big art exhibition entirely
off her own bat, and for that reason alone she
deserves to succeed. The programme announces
that she is under the patronage of the Empress
Frederick of Germany, Governors Duff and
Hopetoun, Mayor Manning and other notabili-
ties. The Empress Frederick, under these
conditions, is rather a long range dignitary, but
her name, at all events, looks profoundly impres-
sive. The show will be opened by Mayor Manning,
and the musical entertainment includes the names
of Kowalski, Harry Leston, Albert Marsh, Franz
Mauer, Rivers Allpress, Harry Nathan, Misses
Charbonnet-Kellermann, Colborne Baber, Lottie
Hyam and many others. Also, there is a most
imposing committee, an art union, and a lot of
other attractions.

After a brief season, which at one time
promised very well, the new Federal Minstrels
petered out dismally and suddenly. Two very
small child • artists belonging to this transient
show, Nelly Finlay and Fred Saunders, ought to
be heard of again on some more favourable oppor-
tunity. The rest of the co, were old and
hardened minstrels of the kind who used to make
a furore seven or eight years ago, but for whom
the demand seems now to have altogether died
away.

Mr. A. J. Daplyn’s lecture on “An Artists
Wanderings in Samoa,” given in Y.M.C. A. hall
last week, was worthy of a much larger audience
than turned up to hear his chatty reminiscences
of that distressful country. Amongst other things
he told those present that there were no poor
there; no beggars. Other travellers say the
Samoans are all beggars - they are always begging
for something. He testified to the good work
done by the missionaries, also to the amiability of
the Samoan girls, and the nasty habit the natives
have of carrying severed human heads around
the town after a fight. The description of the
preparation of kava by mastication didn’t seem to
arouse much enthusiasm, although Mr. Daplyn
said it wasn’t as bad as it looked, and the girls
who “chawed” were of the first families. Some
allusion was, of course, made to R. L. Stevenson.
We are tired of Stevensonolatry.

If the new wine needs new bottles,
Let the singers young and gay
Pour fresh music from their throttles
Into ballads of to-day ;
But what time the glory lingers
In their strains that sweetly flow,
We wou'd fain hear old-time singers
Trill the lays of long ago.
This appears to be popular sentiment (neatly put)
concerning the Montague-Turner treatment of
certain perennial operas. There, was a large crowd
at Melb. Bijou, on Saturday, to hear “Maritana”
sung by artists who have breathed its airs for
many years past, and who drop into their
accustomed places with the confidence of ever-
welcome friends. The principals were mostly
voice-weary from hasty rehearsal, yet they
did so well that a large percentage of “Mari-
tana” had to be repeated, and although the
drinking festival in Don Caesar’s dungeon was
even a drier function than usual, and the
Kins of Spain wore cheap trimmings and a
close-cropped head, and the chorus might have
dissembled its antiquity with another pound or
two of pigments—although these and other details
admitted of improvement—there was a general
feeling among the audience that “ Maritana 5 had
little to com plain of. Miss Montague, Miss Cecily
Staunton, Turner, Farley, and Gordon form a
strong backbone to a promising musical season at
the Bijou. On Wednesday they were to deal with
“Faust.” Also, the “ Bohemian Girl” may be
confidently expected at an early date. One can
safely reckon on the Gyurl.

“A Life of Pleasure” is wending its
naughty way to a brilliant finish at the Princess’s,
for after Friday night that notable spectacle must
be piled upon several lorries and taken away with
the rest of Bland Holt’s stock-in-trade. It has
proved a solid success, as times go, and the
memory of its indifferent morals and Burmese
bloodshed will not soon fade from Smellbourne s
heart. On Saturday the Comic Opera Company
return to re-open proceedings in “ The Vicar of
Bray ” Bracketed with this frisky Christian
will be “Penelope,” a one-act operetta new to
Australia. Special and solemn interest is attracted
to “ Penelope” by the statement that it will in-
clude six farewell appearances of Ryley, whose last
solo should bring the tear of woe to many a wist-
ful eye.
“ The Shamrock and the Rose ” is extend-
ing over a fortnight at Melbourne Royal. On
Saturday last Charles Holloway began to alter-
nate characters with W. J. Sweeney, therefore
the man who pays his money takes his choice
between witnessing Charles as a virtuous young
hero, or a comic old sinner. Each part seems to
suit him a little less than the other. Holloway
made his one thoroughly satisfactory effort years
back, in the character of a surly tramp, the
play was “The Naked Truth,” and George Dar-
rell, so some rascally liar avers, had got
himself so entangled in his own plot, that
a desperate expedient was needed to get him
clear again. At this juncture C.H. strolled
irrelevantly across the stage and knocked George
senseless with a soft brick. He had no other kind
of connection with the story ; he merely came for-
ward, heaved the brick, and went away for ever.
He performed this duty in a prompt, decisive
manner, and gave satisfaction to all. We wander
from the point, however. The bill for Saturday
next is “True as Steel.”

The Circus at Melb. Alexandra has pub up
a new programme, replete with daring achieve-
ments in the somersault line and startling horse-
feats. The lions, too, are groaning in a different
key, as though they hungered for a change of diet,
and would prefer a sirloin of Dan Fitzgerald, or a
corner off Brother Tom’s brisket. There is some
absurd hesitation in the matter of letting anyone
enter the den. Several tamers are waiting for the
job, and John Burns frets for human companion-
ship ; yet the circus will probably resume its tra-
vels without supplying this long-felt want. The
show is advertised to close on Saturday.
A popular concert contains 35 per cent,
of music and singing, and 65 per cent, of coming
upon the platform, leaving the platform, coming
back again to bow, departing for a second time
and finally “yielding to the inevitable encore.”
It is little wonder that theatre-goers as a body
fight shy of these harmony meetings.

Prof. Marshall Hall had reason for his
latest wild gibberings at Melbourne musical
criticism which so overrated Belle Cole and Co.
that it could not do comparative justice to the
IJrso-Sapio concerts, coming immediately after-
wards. The “critics ” sounded the whole gamut
of praise for massive Belle Cole and a repetition
of the same old adjectives created very little advt.
effect. It doesn’t say much for the “music-
loving section of the public ” that a daily news-
paper notice should be taken seriously, nor for
Mr. Hall that he should eternally rave upon such
an absurd subject. Besides, Hall himself gets
more slushy comment than he deserves.
Pretty maiden, Ethel Haydon—
Did it please you,
We would kiss the boards you played on
At the Bijou :
Press our lips to all the places
That you stayed on,
Or, but brushed with fairy paces,
Ethel Haydon.
When you feigned to sigh and falter,
Sweetly, gently—
O ! we could have murdered Walter
“Phillip ” Bentley.
He, to win your stage affection !
Only death’ll
Dissipate that recollection,
Pretty Ethel.
At Poverty Point.
Roberts, the stage-manager and principal young man of
Maggie Moore’s co., was recently presented with a hand-
some gold watch by treasurer Jimmy Moore, in recogni-
tion of the very successful Melb. season. The ceremony
was performed in the privacy of Roberts’ dressing-room
at the Royal. On the same evening, it is said, a presenta-
tion of another sort was made to Johnny Forde, who has
travelled with the show this long time past, and always
played Stofel in “ Struck Oil.”
David L“e, the Melb. city organ-grinder, has long
nursed a grievance against Guenett, a music-teacher, who
writesnoticestor the Argus and revels in the verbiageof the
musical dictionary. Guenett passed unfavourable remarks
uoon David’s organ recitals, and then the mighty founder
of the Melb. Philharmonic Society took to “saying things”
about the other fellow when he passed him in the street,
At last David said something so extremely unpleasant
that Guenett, who is taller and younger and less fat,
knocked him prostrate in the gutter. Fined 10s.
T A■ . , fho rißnni-hivp of Charles Arnold
Immediately prior to the departure of Charles Arnold
for Maoriland he heard, as , , „ L. »
Hobart hotel, that acr w . .. . . of
his coming season. As he stood cursing his luck and
the “ iumpers ” the Hobart dog-catcher came along and,
esnvino' Arnold’s dog Lion lying across the busy footpath,
forthwith annexed it in the name of law’n’order. Charles
became speechless for a moment or two, during which the
official got a fair start for the “ lethal chamber," hut when
he recovered—well, he didn’t smile like a guileless young
boatman should. Then a policeman came along and
charged Charles with “langwidge,” and although the
steamer was even then waiting for Charles, he had to
apologise till his teeth nearly fell out.
Olga Brandon has been holding forth to a Sketch man.
She says that Leonard Boyne is the warmest and best

somewhat mixed origin. Her real name is Olga Lazza-

On dit that Clement Scott has recently become a con-
tributor to the columns of Truth, in order to be “ up-
sides ” with his friend William Archer, of the World.
J. C. Williamson has been interviewed by a representa-
tive of the British Australasian. He had a good deal to
say about himself and his past career, but by some lapse
of memory he omitted to mention anything about the
partner of his early triumphs, Maggie Moore. Time was
when J. O. would not have been so forgetful.
Probably no play ever experienced greater difficulties
than the “Life of Pleasure ” on its second night at Melb.
Princess. The boat containing Henrietta Watson and a
waiter turned turtle as soon as she entered it, leaving her
to walk away on the surface of the water while the
menial was dragged off sitting on the bottom of the boat.
In the next act Bland Holt rode off with despatches to
the main body of the army, but was caught by the neck
with a portion of the jungle and had to return to dis-
entangle himself, but the following scene was the chef
d’oeuvre. The Maxim guns having mown down theDacoits
satisfactorily, the curtain fell to about eight feet from the
boards and then stopped. A carpenter ran on from the
wings and tried to haul it down, but instead it began to
haul him up, he dropped off and retired amid the howls
of the house. Then the rag fell properly while the dead
Daooits scrambled to get within its line. In the final
scene the only mishap was when Harrie Ireland banged at
a “looked ” door which opened wide before her thumps.
The stranded Manning opera co. is trying to raise
cash enough to shake off the W.A. dust; but its a
struggle. Leumane and Manning have quarrelled in the
papers.
Jennie Lee had a crammed house tor “Jo’s ” first night
in Perth—May 23. Gov. Robinson, Premier Forrest, with
their wives, and all the other notables attended ; and the
West Australian concluded that Dickens was unutter-
ably wearisome and Jennie absolutely enthralling.
True lovers everywhere will rejoice with Arnold Mola,
basso of the Q. Gondolier Opera Co., who married ,Marie
Dunson, a leading warbler; and was prosecuted by her
indignant friends because she is under age. He was com-

Dear Bulletin, — 1 have seen in Victoria and Tasmania
experts at fancy work with the stock and bullock whips
who would go like hot cakes in the London music-halls,
where the man who can tickle an audience with some-
thing new for a ten-minutes’ “ turn ” can rake in thalers
hand-over-fist. Somebody ought to catch on to this idea.

prize at next N.S.W. Agricultural Show for stockwhip
artists ; perhaps also for bullockies—no swearing allowed.]
Walter Bentley’s wife, a finely-proportioned blonde,
who evidenced some dramatic ability, recently suicided
at ’Frisco, where, under the stage-name of May Brooklyn,
she was performing at the Baldwin Theatre. Her mar-

So long as a certain actor played the lead in his produc
tions down South he made money and plenty of it, but it
was, unluckily for him, banked in his wife’s name. This
awful woman, because she was about as thin as Sara Bern-
hardt, thought she must be about as good an actress ; so,
taking advantage of the cash being in her name, she in-
sisted on hubby putting up pieces in which she could play
Bernhardtish roles. Result: unanimous absence of audi-
ences, disaster, and bung.
Henrietta Watson has, according to rumour, refused
seven offers of marriage since she landed here with Mrs.

Spagnoletti: “On Sunday night I went to Melbourne
Alhambra and Gaiety. Large audiences. Frank Clark
ought to be a Presbyterian. He was round with a silvery
salver covered with a laced napkin and heaped up with
silver bits. ‘Don’t be cheeky,’ said Frank, when a
pittite touched this bland churchwarden on a tender
point. At the Gaiety the performance was just the same
as the first part on a week night, except jokes and danc-
ing. The ladies were similarly made-up, costumed,
wigged, and painted. If anything could make me a Sab-
batarian, this would.”
Dear Bulletin, —Talking about “ much-travelled ’’
people, there are plenty of them nowadays. I have done
a little in the line myself. I began 40 years ago and have
kept it up since. My first 20 years’ travel were as an
amateur Bohemian. My last as one. The
most part of the first was Heaven. A great part of the
last was hell—the law of compensation. I began by
walking, driving and railway through Great Britain-
then, time after time I crossed the Channel (from London)
till I had seen every capital in Europe. Then Asia
Minor, Egypt and along the North of Africa to Algiers.
Then the West Indies and North America. Then South
Africa, from Cape Town to the Limpopo, where I spent
three years “big game” hunting—Caffre trading and
gold digging ; then Madagascar, Mauritius, India, China,
Japan, and the “ Far East" generally another three years;
then Australia, every part of it except the “Never
Never”; Maoriland three times, New Caledonia, Fiji,
and “ the Islands." I don’t remember when I ate my
Xmas dinner in the same place two consecutive y ears. I
have made about 20 long sea-voyages, hundreds of short
ones, and innumerable journeys by road, river, and rail.
I have never been sea-sick, nor ever saw a rope blown
away, a skylight smashed in, or an accident of any kind.
How does that count ?— Duncan Macallum.
One of Dan Fitzgerald’s trick ponies at Melb. Alexandra

The N.S.W. revenue tariff party must
fail at the polls and elsewhere while it has two
leaders. Reid is only its leader in name. Parkes
would be its leader in reality but for the fact that
the party is divided in itself. Parkes sees that
the revenue-tariff game is up, and feels his way
per medium of Mr. Jackal Wise, who talked of
fourpenoe in the £ land-tax, which is, later on,
diplomatically whittled down to a half-penny or
twopence or something or,other; but Reid and
M'Millan still follow the old banner of the calico
drummers.


WHY?
“ IMITATION
is the
SINCEREST FLATTERY.”
The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently
svery dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian’people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the unserup-
ulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all they seem to thrive, and
the paper who hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks charn-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Jf letcher sPillshaveneveryetstooped to decep-
tion and misrepresentation. They are scientific
therapeutical agents, and evidence as to their
value can be found in every district, and such
being the case it is unnecessary to further extol
their virtues.

All old-time Syd-
neyites, who can look
1 ao’c 40 years or so,
will remember “Urn
brella” Lee. He used
to ride about town on
a bay horse with a
queer white patch on
its rump, and he al-
ways, when mounted,
shaded himself under
a white cotton um-
brella, lined inside
with green. Hence
In's nickname. Even
in those days Mr.
Lee was ever a con-
sistent advocate of
the entire abolition of
capital punishment,
and up to the present
time he has joined in
every agitation for
the repeal of those
blood - stained laws
which disgrace the
N.S.W. statute-book.
His unswerving belief
in the failure of the
gallows as a deter-
rent to crime, and his
persistent advocacy in
and out of season for
its abolition, earned
for him, subsequently,
another sobriquet—
“Abolition’’Lee, An
old man now, but ,
true to the doctrine
preached by him in
his younger days, Mr.
Lee was again to the
fore in the recent agi-
tation in Sydney for
the reprieve of the
burglars, Mont-
gomery and “Wil-
liams.” Comparing
the thousands of citi-
zens who were with
him in this latter-day
agitation with his
almost lone - handed
battles of a couple of
decades back, the old
man can exclaim, with
a certain amount of
satisfaction, “It moves ! It moves !” But, alas !
slowly.
A recently-decorated Australian, not long

The principal precedent cited in the battle

When Gov. Kintore arrived in Sydney
with a domesticated noble’s love of home com-
torts he telegraphed to Premier Kingston, enquir-

A Bulletin correspondent points out
that there are cases of Australian aborigines
living more than seven years in gaol. As an
instance, Jacky Whyman, who was to have been
imprisoned for life, but was released after serving
15 years. He afterwards died in Cobargo (N.S. W.)
district. His crime was the murder of Paddy
Haddigaddy, another blackfellow.
f( Somebody said to a Sheriff the other day :
Tell me, is it true that you give brandy to men
before they walk to the gallows?” “Well,”
replied the Sheriff, “I have seen it done in some
cases.” “How much do you give them?” “That
depends. Mostly a couple of ounces- just enough
to prevent fainting, and not enough to encourage
them to turn the drop into a hustings.”
Shiels is becoming an adept at double
entendre. Two neatly-turned phrases, one in re-
ference to Billies and the other to Princess May,
convulsed the Vie. Assembly, but they were not
reported. The Argus merely remarked that, “as
usual, Mr. Shiels availed himself of opportunities
to be coarse.” All the same, in one of the jeux
a esprit, the wit more than redeemed the lubricity.
. -Apropos Patterson. A Melb. paper says,
in other words, that the knightship came as a
thunderbolt out of the blue. Now, does anyone
suppose Queen Victoria is such a fool as to expose
herself to being snubbed by a Higinbotham or
Francis refusing a knighthood—plumped on him ?

Time after time comparative nonentities are

are solid in favour of
liquor prohibition is going
to join a lot of other ex-
ploded delusions. Most
of the recent Cold Tea
victories jin Maoriland
seem to have been set
down to the female vote
on no sufficient evidence.
At Timafu a poll was
taken, arrangements
being made to distinguish
between the votes of the
two sexes, and the result
was that 531 women
voted for prohibition and
562 for drink. There-
fore, it is beginning to
be suspected that it is
really the working-man
vote which is bursting up
the liquor business, or at
least that one sex has as
much to do with it as the
other.
The other night
Parkes got off his chest
one of these aged com-
monplaces which sound
almost like wisdom
because of his hair, and
which would sound like
abject foolishness if de-
livered by a clean-shaven
man with bristles half-
an-inch long : “ Before
you abolish party govern-
ment,” said the ancient
sage, “you must abolish
human nature.” It is a
good old wheeze which
covers a multitude of
sins. But party govern-
ment is practically only
a thing of yesterday,
and human nature got on
somehow or other with-
out it for an seon or two
before it was invented,
and it will probably pull
through without it after
it is gone.
When last heard from Forrest & Co. held
1,300,000 acres of Westralian land. Now Premier
Forrest proposes to float a £1,300,000 loan.
Exactly £1 an acre. Somehow, John “ doesn t
believe in a land-tax.”
During 1893, that year of bitter economy,
N.S.W. got over £2,000,000 further in debt. In
a year of ordinary administration, without exces-
sive economy, the province gets £4,000,000
further in debt. That is all the difference.
“ The establishment of a University does
hot mean, as is often supposed, the expenditure of
large sums of money in costly buildings. A Uni*
versity consists not of buildings, but of men.”—
B. W. Griffiths, M.A., Sydney University .
A POLITICAL QUERY.
Would it matter a rap to the martyrs of Fox
If Jawbone were beaten by Adrian Knox?
Young Australia’s decided that bigots must go—
Now will Knox’s knockout be the opening blow ?
The establishment of the N.S.W. Protec-
tionist-party was one nail in the political coffin of
Parkes; the establishment of the Labour-party
was a clincher. Parkes could drive a pair pretty
well, but he could never learn to drive “ unicorn.”
Labouchere, of London Truth, states that
in three recent libel-actions he has lost £l5O in
damages and £6OOO in costs. The people who
won these actions spent their verdicts in costs
also, and were probably many hundreds out of
pocket as well.
Cardinal Moran points out that only in
Turkey, among European countries, is feloniously
wounding a capital offence. As Premier Dibbs
upholds Turkish law, the Tamworth electors will
have their choice between Turkey Dibbs and
Turkey Piddington.
A Legislative councillor asserts that no
Premier dare form a Cabinet in N.S. Wales
without submitting the names of the members
beforehand to his party in the Council, and main-
tains that there has been no Cabinet for over s*
decade even substantially as the Premier drafted
it.
There are savage dissensions in the N.S.
Wales Foreign-trade Parliamentary-party re the
proposed picnic to Opposition leader Reid.
M‘Millan, who is now almost as powerful, Parlia-
mentarily, as Parkes, is going to stick to Reid,
whereas the Wise contingent wish that G. H.
Reid aforesaid would depart for Heaven in a fiery
chariot.
Graham Berry steps down though not out.
Born with a lust for notoriety in his bones, it has
been his ruin—from a worldly view-point. A
sensible man hates to see his name in a newspaper
—he knows it impairs his genuine power. Had
Berry started life with this idea and his ability,
he would doubtless be rich, instead of worried
as to how his family is to be left.
“ The Labour Platform,” by Arthur Grif-
fith, published in the Workman Social Reform
series, can be recommended to men who think as
a valuable and suggestive exposition of current
democratic tenets, though the paragraph on the
nationalisation of mines is an example of shallow
reasoning, and the reference to British and other
navies an instance of reckless assertion.
HadParkes taken N. S. W. Assembly in hand
on Haynes’s adjournment motion rethe condemned
burglars, and pressed his convictions to a vote, it
is about certain that the Ministry would have
been defeated. In that event, it is supposed that
the House would have been prorogued, the men
would have been hanged, and an appeal to the
country made on the hanging as a test-question.
A TECHNICAL LEGAL TERM.
(Overheard not 1000 miles from Manly.)
FRIEND: “Well, what luck?”
AMATEUR FISHERMAN: “Two schnapper and a gent one.”
It has been proposed, with more than an
ordinary measure of seriousness, that a member of
Sydney D.T. staff should oppose O’Sullivan for
the Queanbeyan electorate. The “keystone,”
who is himself a sort of newspaper man, harbours
a splendid scorn for mere writers.
Jt is related that the wife of an aged
S q ua tter-Assemblyman replied to a friend who
as k e d why her husband did not, in his declining
years, take rest from the turmoil of politics :
“Well, you see, we have too many interests at
stake to permit of dear George retiring just yet.
The Australian Sentinel and Herald
OF Liberty is the long name of a little paper
henceforth to be published quarterly in Melbourne
with the object of opposing attempts at uniting
Church and State—about as good a platform as
can be found nowadays for a newspaper to stand
on -
A pamphlet by “ A.J.C.,” printed a
Hobart Mercury Office, and entitled ‘‘The Caus e
of a Crisis,’’ gives a compact view of Elurscheim’s
theory of rent and interest, and is well worth
reading. The argument involves too many assump-
tious to have more than a theoretical value, but its
aim and ideal are high.
La. n g
OH, THOSE ACTORS!
BAGGS: “Good morning, Bords. Introduce me. Your wife?"
BORDS: “At present!”
If bookmaker Kinnane insists on contest-
ing Randwick, Toby Barton may be beaten by
Mr. Storey. Mr. Kinnane’s claims to a seat in
Parliament appear to consist chiefly in the fact
that he has made money at laying the odds that
he has been lucky enough to escape being “struck
for a lot of doubles.
“ The Use of Camels Regulation Bill,” a
fantastic measure which deals another underhand
slap at the ship of the desert, couldn’t find one
supporter in N.S.W. Council. One member
agreed to introduce it as a matter of courtesy ; but
he was so ashamed of himself that he failed to
turn up, and denunciation was adjourned.
“The will of the people is seen in the
statute-book, and not in the excited cries of a
sympathetic multitude or an unscrupulous faction
of opponents,” says Premier Dibbs. The will of
the people isn’t necessarily seen in a twelve-year-
old statute-book, any more than a man’s present
sentiments are seen in the love-letter he wrote
ten years ago.
* ‘ The activity of Governments, with their
antiquated and merciless methods of punishment,
their galleys, prisons, gallows and guillotines, so
far below "the general plane of morality, tends
rather to lower the standard of morals than to
elevate it, and, therefore, rather to increase than
to lessen the number of criminals.” —Tolstoi, in
his latest hook.
Victorian Knights in Olympus : Palmer,
Stawell, Murphy, M'Mahon, Molesworth, E. E.
Williams, Barry, M'Oulloch. In Inferno: Clarke,
Wilson, Patterson, Duffy, Berry, Madden,
O’Loghlen, Davies, Wrixon, Williams. In Pur-
gatory—i.e., getting through or in pickle : Gillies,
Bent," Deakin. Insolents who scouted the idea:
Francis, Lalor, Higinbotham.
Whatever technical interpretation may be
placed on the words defining the relation of
N.S.W. Governors towards prisoners capitally
sentenced, Gov. Duff is satisfied that no preroga-
tive rests with him, and a Minister lately said
that if a Governor attempted to arrogate the pre-
rogative of a few years ago the Government would
promptly cancel his instructions.
Alfred Deakin is said to have been angry
at the appointment of Gillies to the Agent-
Generalship in preference to the re-appointment of
Graham Berry. If this yarn contains a grain of
truth Deakin should at once quit politics for his
country’s good. The idea of sending Berry back
to London, where he is wrongfully supposed to be
implicated in the Mercantile Bank failure, was
always out of the question.
A Melb. newspaper correspondent suggests
that every church member be invited to subscribe
for the relief of distress, “ Is. per week or more,
according to the good fortune which God has
chosen to bestow on them.” The idea is good,
but the snuffle isn’t. The man who has a pile
seldom gets it from Above, but from Below. Good
fortune of the kind that is expressed in hard cash
mostly comes from the Other Fellow.
John Tighe Ryan obsequiously greasing
the axles of the Dibbs Ministry :
Instead, therefore, of wildly condemning the (N.S.W.)
Ministers, we should rather be thankful that we have a
strong Government which can be relied upon to put down
lawlessness and to discourage here such outbreaks of
scoundrelism as are possible under popular government
in America.
“ Popular government in America!” A sneer
truly worthy of a man whose name, if it means
anything, means that he comes front a country
which has for centuries been the spittoon of an
aristocratic caste. Mr. John Tighe Ryan is
apparently not at home among democratic institu-
tions, but he “ feels good ” amongst the Australian
ex-Republicans who have sold God for cocked-
hats.
The election for Northern District, S.A.
Legislative Council, on May 26, sounds the death-
kned of Wm< Copley, ex-Minister for Lands in
j) oW ner’s Cabinet. Copley headed the poll id
1885 afJ a Liberal, but he got into bad company
aud swa ]l oW ed his political views for office. Hid
defeat is a big blow for the National Ass, which
spent much money to get him in. O’Loghlin,
re-elected at the head of the poll, is a consistent
Democrat, as is Bice, the second man. Jhe elec-
tion gives Kingston a Council majority, as against
a minority of two last year ; the Baker party will
consequently be far less chirpy in the ensuing
session.
Of the three
N.S.W. co-opera-
tive settlements—
Bega, Pitt Town,
and Wilberforce—
that at Wilber-
force was the least
unpromising. The
men were not pau-
pers, and ex-
pended a large
sum in cash and
labour before the
Government ad-
vanced a penny.
Yet the
have now come to
the conclusion
that Dr. Rose-
by’s “ Christ-like
ideal ” (sustained
by a thumping real
State subsidy)
can’t be reached
by average human
nature. So they
are applying to
Government to
cancel their con-
stitution, and re-
start them on the
old individualistio
lines.
Six of the pre-
sent members of
the S.A. Legisla-
tive Council have
declared in favour of its abolition.
The Scotch bankers who back up Henniker
Heaton’s penny-postage fad, in recommending a
plenipotentiary to treat with the Australias, name
Marquis Dufferin, Baron Oarington, and the noble
Randolph Churchill. Possibly “ Randy ” would
be the most acceptable of the trinity; but does not
Scotch “ canniness ” stick out in the limitation of
acceptables to the British Peerage? ’Cute men
study, not the strength, but the weakness of those
they deal with.
After repeated denials, it turns out that
two of the precious South African “heroes ” who
slaughtered the Matabele did steal the ransom
sent by Lobengula, and did suppress his offer to
surrender —thereby driving him and his wretched
followers to death. This gives point to the shriek
of the Queensland poetess, who yearned for Aus-
tralians to take part with the band of robbers
and murderers whose names have been duly in-
scribed on the scroll of England’s greatness.
Six months ago, under the heading of
“ Why go to Paraguay,” Gilbert Casey thu aspos-
trophised in the Croydon (Q.) Mining News :
Great Soott! Universal Suffrage! Both Houses of
Parliament elective I Provision for Village communes!
An elective Magistracy! State-aid to Land Settlement!
Why do we go to Paraguay? Well! well 11 well Ml 1
should smile.”
Probably Gilbert is now smiling on the other side
of his face.
Q. Registrar of Trades Unions issues some
suggestive figures dealing with Q. labour unions,
whose membership for 1891 was 16,542; for 1892,
3413; capital—end of ’9l, .£9632; end of ’92,
<£5545; net local income—lB9l, <£20,247; 1892,
<£5092. Payments, 1892, were £3968 for manage-
ment, |£1752 strike expenses, £916 unemployed
relief, £296 sick and accident relief, £154 funeral
expenses, &c., £207 excess of outside contribu-
tions, £509 written off. Between “management”
and strikes, the money soon goes.
The old Pulsford crowd of N.S.W.
Ereetraders announce, as their programme, the
abolition of all customs duties save those on
alcohol and tobacco. This will mean a loss
of something over £1,000,000 per annum. Then
they announce that they only propose to tax
land to the extent of Jd. in the £, which
will bring in, according to their own esti-
mate, £150,000. The discrepancy of £850.000
per annum simply means that the old Parkesian
“Freetrade” tariff would have to remain very
much as it used to be, and that there is no more
Freetrade to be had from Pulsford than there is
from Dibbs.
Contempt
for your ailments is simply committing suicide.
Every man is the centre of the universe to himself,
yet how many do we daily meet who complain of
weakness, liver complaint, neuralgia, and so on ?
Hundreds of such sufferers are met with every
week who neglect their cases when there is a
reliable remedy in Clements Tonic at hand. This
preparation is distinct from the many disguised
purgatives called indigestion cures, the use of
which are most harmful to the patient. Clements
Tonic does not give relief by drastic catharsis, but
aims at curing the cause of the disorder and then
the unpleasant symptoms cease. If you suffer,
remember that without treatment the disease
must increase, and that it is criminal on your part
to neglect your ease, at any rate your life depends
on your getting proper treatment and maybe the
lives of a wife and family. Therefore do not delay,
get Clements Tonic and do not be put off with
vile purgatives or substitutes, and you will meet
with the same success as Mrs. Elizabeth Luther-
borrow, North Rocks, Oarlingford, Parramatta,
N.S.W., who writes on December 26th, 1892:
Having found such wonderful benefit as I have
from the use of Clements Tonic I think it my duty
to forward you this letter so that you may publish
it, as it may be the means of getting some poor
sufferer like I was to try Clements Tonic. I had
suffered fearful pain for seveu years, caused by
poverty of blood and indigestion. The pains all
over ray body, especially at my joints and under
my heart, were So severe that I could not rest
day or night; I became so weak and debilitated
that I could only with the greatest difficulty attend
to my home. I spent pounds with doctors, but
daily grew worse. The agony I suffered after
eating even the smallest quantity of food was more
than I could bear. I saw Clements Tonic adver-
tised and determined to give it a trial. I have
taken seven bottles, and am quite a new woman,
all pain has entirely left me. I sleep well at night,
and can eat any food without feeling the least
inconvenience, and do my work without any
trouble.—l remain, yours, &c., Elizabeth Luther-
borrow, Norlh Ricks, Oarlingford. Parramatta,
New South Wales.

Tli6 Soudan ass, which represents some-
thing like <£300,000 of legal cornstalk tender, is
now to be on the Colonial Sugar Co.’s
estate at Fiji, where he is having a lofty period of
it, eating, drinking, and being the father of mules.
If this story is true, then a <£300,000 asset has
been surreptitiously removed from N.S.W., and
entrusted to the care of a bloated corporation
and the security of the British bondholder has
been unlawfully reduced to that extent. The fact
that an asset of this size could be removed without
Parliamentary sanction is another evidence of the
horrible confusion of the public accounts; had the
donkey been properly audited at regular intervals
by the Government auditor this gigantic embezzle-
ment of mule would have been impossible. As it
is, the only thing remaining is to’ find out who
made away with the ass and sue that person for
the price of the lost animal. The N.S.W. State
ass was the most expensive, romantic and much-
travelled ass on earth, and its loss, in a national
sense, and altogether apart from the damage done
to the public credit, is irreparable. The money,
may, perhaps, be replaced, but the associations
which surrounded the lost animal can never be
restored.
* • ♦ *
Until the State pays as much for the
defence of a person accused of a capital crime as
it pays for his prosecution, it should be a point of
honour with the junior Bar to decline being
assigned to the job. Cases repeatedly come up in
which a Q.C. is fee’d at £3O or £5O, with an assistant
at half that, both of whom, with first-class solici-
tors’ aid, lay themselves out to convict and, con-
sequently, to hang an unfortunate suspect, while
the whole shield and buckler of that person’s
defence consist of, very often, the intellectual and
moral weakling of the court-table. Native modesty
should make these men decline; but the fact that
their opponents are paid thus handsomely while
they are offered next to nothing, should make
them on business grounds reject the appointment.

Dear Bulletin, — Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works is seriously asked by the finance
committee to charge the men in its employ at
Werribee 2s. each a week rent for the sites on
which their tents are pitched. The proposal is
influentially supported. You are holding a mean-
man competition just now.— C. M‘Gee.
Pastor Fitchett recently
counselled the good young men of
Adelaide never, on any account,
to read Voltaire’s “Candide”—
the book which a lady read over
Charles Lamb’s shoulder one day,
and presently went away in a
hurry, “but whether the blush
(there was one) was the property
of the swain or the nymph,”Lamb
declined to say. The result was
that every copy in Adelaide was
bought, begged, borrowed or stolen
within twenty-four hours.

“ The Governor went out
for a ride yesterday,” Vide Vice-
regal news in the S.M. Herald
any day. Great are wigs and
fustian, and greater still is solemn
humbug. When will the grand-
motherly and chapel-keeping press
shake itself free from the bewigged
and phantasmal spectre of the
days of “ Royal George, our
King?” “ His Grace has sneezed,
how well ’twas done,” cries every
little bootlicker, while that
patient ass, the public, really
takes credit to itself for paying a
man from “ ’Ome” ,£7OOO a year,
and pickings, to inculcate deport-
ment d la Turveydrop on the
gasping descendants of the broad-
arrow.

Premier Patterson expresses
a belief that “ the general effect
of civil marriages amongst a cer-
tain class of people has been to
lessen in their eyes the sacredness
of the marriage tie.” The sensible
view is that the less a man spends
on his wedding the less likely he
is to repent it.
One result—or, at any rate, an incident
of the Speight v. Syme battle seems to have been
the dissolution of the old firm of Melb. solicitors
who managed defendant’s case. The recon-
structed firm hangs on to Syme’s dreary cause,
whilst the seceding partner starts a new business,
with a fixed determination to avoid colossal libel-
actions. It is said that the profession doesn’t get
any “ fat ” out of a case of the Speight v. Syme
kind. The leading barristers must miss briefs
which, in the aggregate, would yield more money
than the one big job. The attorneys have to
upply about ten shillings’-worth of labour for
every guinea they charge, and that is unproduc-
tive business—-for an attorney. The plaintiff and
defendant are both of them bound to be ruined
more or less, whichever way the verdict goes.
The junior counsel at the best only jog along com-
fortably, from the expensive legal point of view;
the witnesses consider themselves badly treated,
and the Judge, although his salary progresses as
umal, would gladly give anybody £lOO to settle
the accursed matter out of Court. Legal costs are
so sinfully exorbitant in ordinary cases that they
can t be fully maintained in extraordinary cases.”
* # #
In Melb. Divorce Court, the other day, a
petitioning wife said that nothing would please
her husband—“he even grumbled at the way his
white shirts were got up.” Judge Madden grew
pensive. Since the lady was unable to produce
one of those shirts in court it was hard to say
whether the husband deserved a thousand lashes
or a lot of sympathy. They might have been got
up with the collar on the bias.

“ Sheriff Cowper considered that the
dying struggles of Williams did not last more
than four minutes .” “Your butcher, above all
other men, should be no bungler!” says Carlyle.
And why does not Botany Bay change her man-
butcher who gave the heavy man a long drop
and simply choked the lighter man with a short
°“°P? And, once again, tell us why the State
should be so brutal as to confront condamnes in
their dying hour with that most hideous of all
earthly spectacles, a noseless hangman ?

On the day of the Montgomery-Williams
hanging a Sydney evening paper sent this telegram
u ? ountr y a £f e nts, one of whom pasted the
ghoulish document on his window and thereby
gave the business away badly :
Montgomery and Williams executed this morning. Ter-
rible bungling. Horrible death of Williams. Shocking
scene. Full report to-morrow morning. Increasing
supply. Make this known.
The Press is indeed a noble institution. Just as
noble as the candle-shop.

Mr. Justice Stephen, who tried Mont-
gomery and Williams, executed last week at
Sydney, has some reason for not liking burglars.
It was in the grounds at his Honor’s residence
that the mysterious shooting of Constable Slater
took place a year or two ago. For this the police
had two men capitally arraigned, but the jury
didn t convict. The police were certain that they
had the right men, but all the same they hadn’t.
In this connection The Bulletin has a pretty
story to tell—some day.
* * *
Whether or not Australian women yearn
to wear trousers in public, there is no denying
that, in private, whenever opportunity affords,
they are eager to don them. At an occasional
dance amongst the female trainees of a certain
N.S. W. State institution, it is quite the recognised
thing for a number of them, in the absence of
proper partners, to disport themselves in the attire
forbidden by Scripture. The lament common in
“society,” anent the lack of dancing young men,
is unheard in the institution, as all the fair trainees
are only tod anxious to “ try ’em on ” and be. for
the nonce, the Man. A story current in the
institution concerns a trainee who had borrowed
a middy’s uniform for a special fancy-dress affair.
A MELBOURNE BELLE.
The clothes were uncomfortably tight-fitting, the
young lady was anything but slim, and, of course,
but one thing could happen. And, during some
violent calisthenics, 'it did happen ; and that girl
has never since been able to look that middy in
the face.

A sign of the times in Sydney is the num-

Those quaking bookmakers who hand over
their cash-bags to midniedit marauders are advised
to read the case of Catherine Hall, the dauntless
licensee of a Melbourne pub. Miss Hall (she is a
spinster) was lately disturbed in her bedroom by
three men, one of whom pointed a revolver at her
head, saying—“Do you see this?” Catherine
replied in the a,ffirmative, and the armed burglar
said—“ Well, it’s a revolver, and if you don’t
keep quiet I’ll shoot you.” Then the young lady
leaTcomid of .! bed and cried for help without the
ibt u u i at,on for her Promised doom. Also

choir are several most tuneful convicts.
One woman in particular is remarkable for a good voice.
She is very seldom out of gaol, and on festival occasions,
if she is at liberty, will convict herself to get back again
so as to sing her solos, “O, Salutaris," &c. The men in
the yard, of other denominations, waiting their turn for
church, get as near as they can to listen to this woman’s
singing, such power has she.

Most of the basis of a current divorce-

his hand on a very hot pipe which the affectionate
stranger was smoking when he found it was time

A shocking instance of banquet grovel
occurred some weeks ago at Castlemaine. The
local horticultural society was filling itself with
refreshments under the patronage of Lord Hope-

Oastlemaine Horticultural Society that “it was a
very young society, but it had already blossomed
out into something very large indeed. Their first
show was opened by the Mayor of Oastlemaine.

In Melbourne, recently, a deserted hus-

that a husband could only prosecute his wife for

was requested to “consent ” accordingly. Natur-

and six years on the second. Twice isn’t

it filled the meaning of the Act. If he had been
sentenced to ten years the first time, that one con-

would probably have thereupon decided that once

Breathe a whisper, Bishop Smith,
Breathe it o’er the waters blue;
Is she of your kin and kith,
Tres petite, or tall as you ?
Is she young or middle-aged,
Blonde or raven-tressed dame?
Bishop, if you be “engaged,”
Let us know the lady’s name.
May a bishop marry twice?
Doth he any rule offend
If he call a person nice
By a fonder name than “ friend ? ”
Lawful love is no disgrace,
Vide good apostle Paul.
Never heeding rank or place,
Cupid winks at one and all.
In a whisper, Bishop Smith,
Tell us—is the rumour right—
Is the lady but a myth
Or a living presence bright ?
Are you flitting like a moth
Round a pure and holy flame ?
May we bless your plighted troth ?
If so, whisper what’s her name.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHiVT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at

The last fortnightly series of Sydney wool sales opened
on Wednesday, 30th May. The usual number of buyers
for this time of year being present.
Opening prices were about equal to last auctions. On
Thursday the sales were continued, but if any alteration
it was in favour of buyers.
We hear from London that the May series of sales closed
on Ist inst. Superior greasy merino beinsr firm and
medium and faulty merino about 5 per cent, under late
rates. Lambs’ wool and crossbred may also be quoted
from id. to Id. per pound cheaper. The quantity with-
held from sale was about 115,000 bales. American buyers
secured 5000 bales.
On Thursday we brought forward a fair-sized catalogue
for the time of year, but withheld a number of lots
sooner than sell at prices which might be looked upon by
owners as unsatisfactory. We always make a point of
protecting wool up to our valuations. Among the brands
offered were the following:— AO/B from Bathurst, H'l
and C from Forbes, DE/Q from Gilmore RIVERSIDE

History Repeats Itself!
“I know of no way of judging the future but
by the past.”
This Remark was made by the greatest of
American orators. His words were ringing, andl
what he said is true. Let us see :
The history of the lives of most men and
women shows that they have some happiness,,
some misery, and much disappointment.
It shows that the majority of men and women
break down during their lives, and that few, very
few, die of old age.
It shows that carelessness and neglect have'
been the causes of this breaking down, and that
care, watchfulness, and intelligence prevent it.
It shows that the chief cause of breaking down
is due to some form of kidney, liver, or bladder
trouble, and to the innumerable complaints com-
mon to women.
The history of this country for the past ten
years, however, shows that these troubles can be
and are being decieased, and that they can at alii
times be controlled.
It shows that the means by which this may be
done is within the reach of all, and that it is a
purely scientific preparation endorsed by the
doctors and used universally. In fact, no other
than Warner’s Safe Cure.
If you wish to judge the future in your own
life,
If you desire to part the veil which may
separate you from the great unknown before you.
If you are interested to know what your future
life may be, whether health or happiness, sickness
or misery, look at the past. You will see that
care and the use of the right remedy has kept, has
preserved, has sustained people, and that the
neglect of these things has brought sickness and
untimely death.
If you are a wise man or woman, you will
ponder over these things and

for the woman to leave her husband. Then he

Under the terms of the original agreement it is
stipulated that the men shall be provided with a
warm bath each evening, wherefore a tank heated by
steam-pipes is supplied to the Japanese quarters.
Just fancy the imported British labourer, or even
the native-born worker, insisting on such a luxury
at the close of his day’s toil!

FROM SEA.
(For Tub Bulletin.)
As one come home from sea.
Where storms and stress prevail,
1 came to thee.
Through rims of raging foam,
By sea-lashed headlands grim,
Still, slowly home.
‘The livelong night afar,
Where sea and skies combine,
I saw thy star.
The sea-spume filled my hair,
The salt winds stung my eyes,
But thou wert there.
The gulfs beneath my feet
Had no affright for me,
My life, my sweet.
These arms in mine entwined
Were round me then as now,
So soft and kind.
These eyes that knew no sleep—
A light to guide me home—
So calm and deep.
Not all the wrath of sea
Could keep thy love from me—
This kiss from thee.

Two gentlemen are browsing upon the assets of that

The liquidation of “Sir Matthew’s” English
and Australian Mortgage Bank has condensed the whole
history of the land-boom into one brief narrative. Messrs.
Embling and Kay report that they lately inspected one of
the bank’s properties —“ a farm which was sold during
boom-time for the purpose of creating a suburb of Melb.,
some i 2 or Ik miles away. It was originally sold for £7
per acre, and was then rapidly transferred from syndicate
to syndicate at augmented prices until it came into the
hands of the E. and A.M. Bank at £7O. It was supposed
to be cut up into allotments, but this was never done, and
finally the liquidators sold it back at £7 per acre again to
the son, of the man who made the first profit upon it."
An enquiry into the constitution of these intermediate
syndicates, which made among them the bogus profit of
£63 per acre, would doubtless reveal the entire working
of what has been called “ land-boom madness.” ’Twas
madness with a delightfully simple method in it.

the English system, for example. A, who is 20, and
who is entitled to moneys on his coming of age, wishes to
borrow £lOO. He is introduced by a mutual (commission)
“ friend ”to financier B who says: “ You are, of course,
of age and wish an advance of £lOO for 12 months. My
terms are 7} per cent, and a bonus of £lOO. Sign this
declaration before a J.P. certifying that you are of age,
and that you owe me for value received, £207 10s., pay-

According to the mysterious workings of the
Queensland Bank Notes Act, any bank can deposit
£25,000 with the Treasury at Brisbane, and get in ex-
change £lOO,OOO worth of legal tender notes, the other

the bank goes bung, the Government deposit presumably
takes its chance with the rest. Just here a serious ques-

small percentage which the bank pays in gold. If it gets

£lOO,OOO in notes in exchange, and then deposits the
£25,000 in that bank in the usual course, it is obvious
that the bank can presently call round a second time with
exactly the same little pile of sovereigns and get another
£lOO,OOO worth of legal-tender paper on the strength of
them. Then it can come up a third time with the same
identical money, and so on ad infinitum. There is no
definite evidence on the subject, but this it apparently
one of the alarming possibilities of the situation.

The latest book-agent’s dodge. He calls at a
house and says that one of his canvassers—since dismissed
—had previously obtained an order for the book. “Not
from anyone in this house,” says the householder.
Agent’s face becomes solemn—“ But he was paid com-
mission on your order. I fear he must have forged it."
Then, in a pained voice, he tells the householder that it
will be necessary for him (the agent) to prosecute the
canvasser, and that the householder will have to attend
court as witness. In nine cases out of ten, if the house-
holder is a woman, she takes the book to save further
worry, and the agent promises not to have the canvasser
arrested. “It is his first fall from honesty," etc., etc.
Then he smiles softly as he goes off in quest of another
victim.

at the rate of 28}. Five-pound notes average even a
better exchange. Italian paper money is taken here

than this, and though you never hear any tall talk
about them the fact remains that they are really good
mines. If Mount Huxley, when it gets to work, returns
30 per cent, it wdl be a really good mine. In will even
be a good mine if it returns a steady 15 per cent. It
won t be a failure if it doesn’t return £lOO,OOO “ before

Block 10 directors, confronted with the practical

At Block 10 half-yearly meeting in Melb. re-

The chairman thought it inadvisable to spend money on
sulphide plants “until they had discovered some way of
successfully treating the ore.” Which was to say that
the methods of Warren’s proposed plant and successful
treatment did not coincide. Block 10 people have had

The latest, wildest whoop from Westralia comes
on the authority of a Tasmanian miner named Cunliff.
This person claims to have discovered a reef in which
there are “bands of solid gold, 4in, thick," said bands
being already proved to extend for a distance of 60ft.
The locality is kept strictly dark, but the proprietor has
refused £96.000 for the property, and sleeps on the claim
to prevent brigands coming round in the night and taking
out vast hunks of pure gold with a pick. Altogether the
tale sounds very much like Calvert’s romance concerning
that mountain of gold which he found, but was too tired
to peg out and secure.

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent, “Taipo ”
(April 28), argues from altogether false premises when he
refers to the rainfall at Coolgardie. Students of Austra-
lian meteorology know that the influence of the tropical
cyclonic belt ceases, as a rule, about the 26th parallel,
and that this belt reaches its most southerly extension
during Dec. and Jan. The cyclonic belt of the Southern
Ocean, which influences the rainfall of the Southern coast-
line, reaches its most northerly extension (the 30th
parallel) about June and July, and ic is to this belt, not
to the tropical one which affects Kimberley and the
Murchison, that the Coolgardie district owes its rainfall.
In July, ’93, heavy rain fell all over this field, filling the
big claypan at Hannan’s Find; this rain could not
have been less than 2jin., and had no connection what-
ever with the tropical storms to which “Taipo” refers.
When, as happened three times during April and
May, 92, the late southerly extension of the tropical
belt meets the premature extension ot the southern
belt, a general rainfall from the western coast to the
Q. border is the result. “Taipo’s” arguing about
Coolgardie rainfall on the strength of a Kimberley ex-
penence is as absurd as a Queenslander arguing Victoria
dry because the Queensland storms travel no further
south than Sydney. The fact of there being no large
watercourses in this district is used as an argument
against the existence of a rainy season here. But the
fu* eme ro ktenness of this forest country accounts, I
think, sufficiently for this. It would take more than two
inches of rain (and steady rains are characteristic of the
southern belt, as contrasted with the sharp, heavy,
tropical falls) to soak the country sufficiently to allow of
water running ; and it is noteworthy that wherever the
country is hardened by the existence of mineral belts,
watercourses ofjconsiderable size are found, in most cases
running towards lakes or claypans. And in what other
way could those claypans and salt lakes have been formed
than by the continual deposits of rain-water, evaporated
during the summer, and replenished during the winter
months? With regard to the chances of rain this year at
Coolgardie, the rains which fell here in Dec. and March,
which were doubtless the “tails” of some of “Taipo’s”
tropical storms, would point to the tropical belt being
lower than usual this year, and, in consequence, there is
a probability of the intervening anti-cyclonic “ mound ”
preventing the northerly extensions from the southern
belt until August or Sept.-Yours truly, D.L.D. Cool-
gardie, May 10,’94.

Editor Bulletin, —Sir.—Having read in various
papers strange and awful accounts about Coolgardie, I
now light my pipe and endeavour to give you some idea
of R, from a man to whom Coolgardie owes nothing, and
who owes what little he possesses to Coolgardie. This
place is mostly composed of galvanised iron and gimlet-
wood houses. The climate is splendid, and, taking all
things into consideration, it is not a bad place to live in
for a field a little over a year old and so far away from
civilisation. There are whips of reef gold here, and those
who have been lucky enough to drop on to it live like
fighting-cocks. Most of the gentlemen who lived upon
the princely salary of 40s. a week, and whodined surnptu-
ously upon raspberry-jam sandwiches “over the other
side,” have turned down the bottom-tuck of their pants
and returned home again to abuse one of the finest reefing
fields in all of great Australia. I will allow that many
good miners with small means have also been disappointed;
but at the same time I contend that it would be just as
reasonable for a man who had planked up his last sov. at
Kandwick and lost it to be for ever squealing about his
bad luck, as it would be for him to return from here and
do likewise. It is all a game of chance, and everyone
cannot draw a prize. Why, if every man came here and
got as much gold as he wanted gold would become as
cheap as pumpkins on the Hawkesbury. Scores of unlucky
men leave the field almost daily and scores come up
to take their places. But the man who comes here
armed to the teeth with a burning-glass, tack-hammer
ar >d a pair of sugar-tongs, Is not the man who will explore
and determine the extent and richness of our auriferous
deposits ;he had much better stay at home. Nearly all
the stores do good trade, buildings are going up when-
ever the materials come to hand to erect them, and you
couldn’t throw up a brick between here and Bayley’s with-
out it falling on an auctioneer. Our daily occupation is
abusing the W.A. Parliament; of course, making a crust
when we can, and spearing stray mice with carving-forks.
When rain falls and water is struck, as it will be, in the
shafts all round, and sufficient time has elapsed to prove
the field, then it will be time enough for people to abuse
the place, or come here, as the dictates of common sense
may indicate. At present no one ought to come, and it is
downright insanity of many who keep coming, to arrive
here without the price of a feed and no interest in Cool-
gardie whatever.—Yours, Harry W. Cheesbrouqh.

Editor Bulletin,—At Cue, capital of the Mur-
chison (W.A.) goldfields, a paternal Govt, allows the post-
master (not a regular official) ten pounds per annum or
some such liberal salary. The weekly mail now averages
one ton, and is constantly increasing. Consequence is (I
presume it is the consequence) that the mail takes two or
three days to sort, letters are often only delivered after
calling several times, and newspapers-well, the less said
about them the better. My experience is that out of six
Bulletins which ought to have reached me, only one has
come to hand. The other day a friend of mine posted a
letter addressed to himself, called several times, but has
not had it delivered yet. Complaints are general and
bitter. Again, all stamps have- to be paid for in advance
by the postmaster, the result being that the township is
often stampless. How different this from the early days

That very useful machine, known as the

Some of Minister Slattery’s satellites are
giving it to the world that that politician stood
out strongly in N.S.W. Executive against the
hanging of Montgomery and Williams—which
hanging, we read in a S.M. Herald telegram,
was “ strongly approved of ” in Mr. Slattery’s
constituency, Burrowa. This sort of balancing
must be resented. If Mr. Slattery—who, as a
member of the Executive, is sworn to secrecy, and
must therefore be presumed to have made no
statement on the matter—felt strongly on the sub-
ject he should have resigned. As he didn’t resign,
he is just as accountable for the hanging as
Parkea (who didn’t resign on account of the
Treason-Felony Bill being adopted by the Cabinet
of the day) was for that infamous measure.
A pleasing novelty in cigars has lately
been introduced to the Sydney market by Messrs.
Heyde, Todman & Co. The product is from the
celebrated factory of Messrs. Spencer & Co.,
Madras, who are reputed to be the largest manu-
facturers of cigars in India. This branch of the
firm’s business has developed rapidly during
recent years, so much so that the name of Spencer
& Co. is familiar to almost every traveller
throughout the Indian Empire. At the last
exhibition of the Agri-Hortioultural Society of
Madras, held on the 24th Feb., they succeeded in
securing the highest awards for cheroots and the
best Dindigul and Lunkah tobacco. The
Victorian commissioners, who were recently dis-
patched to India for the purpose of opening up a
trade between the two countries, visited the
premises of the Messrs. Spencer and were very
much interested in what they saw. It is merely
a matter of time for these cigars to become
thoroughly popular with Australian smokers.
N.S.W. Premier Dibbs’ effort to make the
British Lion roar in connection with the Costa
Rica Packet case didn’t work. The phlegmatic
mynheers of the Hague weren’t scared, and flatly
refuse to pay more than £2500, and this only on
the understanding that they recognise no claim
but that of the unfortunate captain of the blubber-
hunting ship. Possibly had the demand been
more moderate a better result would have been
attained. The original claim was, in all, £25,000-
ten thou, each for the captain and Burns, Philp,
and Co., and five for the crew. As the case stands
at present, Captain Carpenter can either take his
£2500 or leave it, and the crew—who, although not
knocked about and ill-treated by the Netherlands-
India Dutchmen as Carpenter was, lost heavily
by the delay of the vessel—get nothing.
The poor devils of sailor men, who came home

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Manton, North Melbourne footballer, walked a
distance ot 160 mile* in order to be down in time for the
first match of his club. Esprit de corps like this is un-
common among Melb. players, who generally howl bitterly
if their train fares everywhere are not paid.
* • • •
No one can tell what was the matter with Abe
Willis in his fight with Hegarty. The referee inferred
that he didn’t try, and the sporting papers endorsed that
opinion; nevertheless, Willis toiled in the stoke-hole of
the Arrawatta coming over, and a man doesn’t do that
without meaning business. Neither he nor Hegarty oared
to take up the challenge of Jack M'Qowan, the sturdy
little footballer, who wanted to meet the winner.
* * * •
The boss of one of the public department# of
Somewhereia is also president of a big football team there,
hence when it came to his ears that one ot his employe*
was a crack junior he called that young man aside and
suggested the desirability of his playing for his (the boss •)
club. “ I can’t do that," replied the footballer, “ because
I’ve promised to play for the —,” naming the suburb
he lived in. “ All risrht 1 all right 1 You can go,’ said
the boss, and a week later there came to the youth of
kicks a notice transferring him to Mulgatown, a God-for-
saken waste of sand, 1000 miles “back.” But happily
these orders are liable to countermand, and, on the trans-
feree telling the boss how sorry he was that he oouldn t
stay to play for his club, he was allowed to remain in the
capital. Thus is the country made the oatspaw of the big
football teams.
« • • •
Since the English courts, some years ago,
decided lhat welshing was “larceny by artifice,” prac-
titioners return the stake deposited and cannot be
prosecuted for refusing to part with the money won.
Hence the names “balancer” and “balancing.”

So far, the Maoriland champion pugs have been

The coming Vic. football season promises to be
interesting. Footsoray, formerly the most despised club,
is as yet unbeaten, and has just astounded the public by
making a draw with South Melb., which two days before
was only beaten by the last three-seasons premier
Essendon. Four out of five who saw the Essendon-South
match agree that next time South must win, while about
six out of seven spectators at Footscray agree that South
was lucky to escape from the city of smells with a draw.
Under the circumstances, the most exciting match of the
season —upon which the premiership will perhaps rest-
will be Footscray and Essendon, on the first Saturday in
July ’
They say that Tom Cannon will have a big look-
in for the next Derby with a despised outsider called
Reminder.

Mr. J. J. Corbett, pugilist and actor, writes
Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent, is one of those
who have suffered from the trumpeting of friends. We
were all prepared, after reading “Gentleman Jacks
newspaper sayines, to see a blustering, noisy bully, foul
of tongue ; instead of which, Mr. Corbett turns out to be
a somewhat modest young gentleman, of nice manner,
rather handsome, and, lastly, a better actor than a good
many who take high rank in the profession. It is thought
that after all, he will meet Peter Jackson at the National
Sporting Club, and as many good sports have taken a
fancy to him he will not lack staunch support when he
steps into the ring. Good judges think he will give Peter
a good deal of hard work to take down his number, if the
nig. does it at all. Corbett’s punching of the sack in the
scene at his training-quarters in the Drury Lane play is a
treat to witness. Certainly I have never seen a more
active big ’un, not even Black Perry. Of course, the
boxing is all “fake,” but, for all that, he shapes like a
man who knows his business.

Tattersall’s Birthday Cup sweep of was
won by a syndicate of eight clerks in Vic. Audit Office.
They subscribed 2s. fid. each and took one chance,
Fiorrie’s victory means £560 apiece to the speculators.
Eight civil servants, anyhow, can afford to be indifferent
to Patterson’s threatened further retrenchments.

Recent S.A. race-meetings establish the fact
that to spot winners the only method is to study, not the
condition of the horse, but of the owner. This applies
particularly to one notorious sport who ought to be aimed
out of respectable meetings.
The South Adelaides are far superior to any
other Adelaide football team this year, and public interest
went down to such an extent lately that people wondered
how footballers would tide over the winter without
working. Fortunately, at this stage, the Sowths lost,
and matters are again normal.

London Sketch : “What a pity we have never
seen Moses, the Australian batsman, in England. The
completion of the intercolonial matches shows him to be
far and away tbe best batsman in Australia. This latter
remark is based on the N.S.W. averages alone, which the
Sketch innocently publishes as representing the per-
formances of all the Australian willow-wielders.

Penance was recently sold for 321} guineas, after
costing 2500 guineas as a two-year-old. On the whole,
his was a worse .case than Titan’s. Even his third in

jame in second, was the stable choice.

Our cricketers, boxers, swimmers, footballers,

, It is related of a very small Maoriland jockey,
who had a very big wife, that she once, while he was
having a convivial time with boon companions, seized
him, and, lifting him into her apron, was leaving the

The choir-boys of a certain Adelaide church have
a grievance against their parson. On the Sunday before
Adelaide Cup was run he solemnly adjured them, in com-
mon with the rest of the congregation, to “ Hold Stead-
fast in their faith.” The boys, of course, accepted it as a
tip, and when the time came Steadfast ran fifth.

Griffin finished the eight rounds on sufferance only.

Mount Morganaire Hall will be getting himself

Wombat could never have lived in the bush, or

reason is that when he has taken his fill, he sits in

Joy among New Guinea Natives .
THEY GLADLY RECOGNISE AN OLD
FRIEND.
A leading journalist who has travelled exten-
sively and observed humanity closely, says that as
a conqueror of pain St. Jacobs oil has no equal in
the wide, wide world, and as a civilising agent it
is far superior to recently invented guns or tor-
pedoes. This journalist knows what lie talks
about. The accompanying illustration depicts a
scene at a wreck off the coast of New Guinea. A
box of St. Jacobs oil has been washed ashore, and
the natives gleefully welcome this marvellou-
household remedy as an old friend. Thanks to
the missionaries, the great and wonderful virtues
of bt. Jacobs oil are now known to the gentle
savage. The master of the missionary schooner
Ellangowan, and the captain of the Governor
Cairns have written of it in the most enthusiastic
terms ; and the genial Captain Liljablad supports
his testimony on the subject with a reference to
the popular Tamate (the Rev. James Chalmers) :
brom Greenland’s icy mountains to Afrie’s

SNAKE POISON AND HUMAN POISON.
Ihe bite of a rattlesnake is almost always fatal to
man. Yet this snake is never affected by the
injection of its own poison into its own blood,
neither when enraged it bites itself nor when its
venom is injected by artificial means to test the
w e?t ", S P eak,n £ on the latter point Dr, S.
, it l / Mitchell, an expert on snake poison, says,
i have oyer and over tried this experiment, but
this beT” laVe 1 SGen death reSulfc ‘ Wh y should
Dr. Mitchell further says : “The many noxious
compounds man carries in his liver and gastric
g ands (the stomach) are fatal if they enter the
blood in any large amount. There is scarcely an
organ. m man s body which is not a possible source
ot poison to him. Small doses are constantly
passing into and out of his blood. The question
is whether he can get rid of it as fast as it ac-
cumulates.”
Alluding to death by rheumatism, gout, and
™ney disease, an eminent London physician says ;

Now let us cite a passage from a man’s experience
as related by himself. The time extends over a
period from March, 1888, to May, 1889, more than
y?\\ He says: My head used to whirl around,
and 1 had frequent bouts of faintness and giddi-
ness; and at such times I used to fall down, no
matter where I was. This would occur two or three
times a day. For three weeks I was confined to
my , bed - / grew gradually weaker and weaker
and lost a deal of sleep. I felt more tired in the
morning than when I went to bed. After a while
1 became nervous, and my legs trembled and shook
under me to such a degree that I feared to walk
out. 1 had great pain in my kidneys, and the
secretion which I voided from them was thick and
yellow as the yolk of an egg. Month after month
passed and I failed more and more, and could
hardly crawl about.
I had a doctor attending me, but his medicines
did not benefit me. He said my liver and kidneys
were in a bad way, and that he never saw secretions
passer in such a state. After treating me six
months, he told me that medicine could do no
more for me and advised me to go to a hospital.
1 went to Peterborough hospital, but got worse
while there. Ihe hospital doctors refused to tell
me what ailed me. Having spent two months
there 1 got anxious and returned to my home,
utterly disheartened. I continued to send to the
hospital for medicines, which I took for three
months longer. I was now so emaciated that my

“In this condition I continued until May, 1889
when one day an umbrella vendor called at my
house, and, seeing how ill I was, said his wife had
been cured of a serious illness by Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. He spoke so earnestly of it that
f J e^ enn u ned b r fc l y , sfc .- After takin £ the Syrup
for ten days I felt in better spirits: my food
agreed with me, and from that time I gained
strength daily. Persevering with it, I was soon
able to return to my work as healthy and strong
as ever. Since then I have been in the best of

facts, and I will gladly reply to any enquiries.
Yours truly (Signed), Read Welfare, Ramsev,
tit. Mary s, Hunts, February 18th, 1892 ”
No brief comment can do justice to this remark-
able case. What the public needs to know amPto
remember is this : Mr. Welfare’s whole system
was poisoned by the products of a torpid and
inactive digestion. These had entered his blood,
as Dr. Mitchell describes. The nervous system
was disordered and half paralysed; hence the
faintness and falling fits. Rattlesnake poison
kills by paralysing the nerves which actuate the
lungs; it kills by suffocation. Human poison
arising from indigestion and dyspepsia, always
operates in the same direction, causing asthma
m its worst forms. It then attacks the
heart and kidneys, causing the state of things
Mr. Welfare mentions. Nothing more noxious
or in the end, surely fatal exists in any
reptile. And yet people trifle with the disease '
an « dootors seem not to understand it.
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup cures by stimu-
lating the kidneys, skin, and bowels, and toning
the gastric glands. h
Who, then, is man’s most deadly enemy? Care-
less and ignorant man himself. Use the remedy
then when the earliest symptoms appear.

A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as “The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. His parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
bad quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; but he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
mussen succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alealine Remedies, suffice it to say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in his celebrated work, “ Ihe
Natural Doctor.”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist —-his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies must have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not hold any consultation
similar to a doctor ; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
He simply prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves, and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
Ho prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, and advertises same, which
is the fairest way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one, containing all particulars
and many uselul and valuable hints on health.
Herr ilassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and tlrroughout the world. is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold medalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem. of the Academie Parisienne des
Inventeurs, France ; last year he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold medal by several of his cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893; and in 1891 he issued Ins
“ Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.

Governor MacGregor’s Sorcery Ordinance
for the New Guinea niggers :
1. White men know that sorcery is only deceit, but the
lies of the sorcerer frighten many people. The deceit of
the sorcerer should be stopped. 2. It is a forbidden act
for any person to practise or to pretend to practise sor-
cery. 3. It is a forbidden act for any person to threaten
any other person with sorcery, whether practised by him-
self or by anyone else. 4. Any person who practises
sorcery or who procures another person to do so, or who
threatens anyone with sorcery, may be tried by a Magis-
trate. Punishment: 5. If the person tried is found
guilty, he may be sentenced by a European Magistrate to
imprisonment not exceeding three months, or by a native
Magistrate to imprisonment not exceeding three days.
6. If the person is sent to prison he will be made to work
without payment.
The Bulletin has just received an ordinance
issued by the boss New Guinea nigger :
1. Your chief knows that the new religious sorcery of
the white men can knock spots off nigger sorcery any day.
The deceit of the missionary must therefore be stopped.
2. I forbid any white missionary to practise, or pretend
to practise his sorcery.
3. Any white man practising sorcery may therefore be
caught and killed by anyone who takes an interest in his
country’s welfare.
4. It is distinctly forbidden to any man who may kill a
missionary (sorcerer) to bruise him with a stone club or
any other blunt instrument that may spoil the meat for
cooking. He may be either speared or shot with an
arrow.
5. No man must cut any piece or pieces off a dead white
sorcerer and cook them on the quiet. In all cases the
body must be sent to me for division.

Mr. C. C. Kingston, Q.C.
Charles Cameron Kingston, Q. 0., whose portrait
appears in this issue, has been more or less of a
puzzle to people all his life. His exuberant Demo-
cracy or was it a touch of genuine Republican-
ism . moved Samuel Griffith, at the ’9l Conven-
tion, to plaintively inquire : “Does he or does he
not intend to make the Queen a permanent part of
the 1 arhament ? Does he intend that the Common-
wealth of Australia is to be presided over by the
Queen ?’’ Kingston passed these conundrums ;
and, indeed, the chances are that the Queen, with
the best intentions of being permanent in this
Vale of Tears, will have gone to reign some-
where else before she is called on to serve
the Australian Commonwealth in any capa-
c>ty save on the principle that they also serve
who only sit and wait. Mr. Kingston was
a puzzle to his friends when, in 1881, his 30th
year, he entered S.A. Parliament for West Adel-
aide, which constituency has ever since returned
}Y as h® to bring the traditions of the foot-
ball-field and the Police Court into Parliament?
Ur was he to be the worthy son of his judicious
and weighty father—first S.A, Speaker? Perhaps
he was puzzled himself, for he simply combined
thetwo. Then there was another puzzle when, in
a John Colton—Pasquin Mitford’s “Pious
Saddler ” —made this young blood his Attorney-
general. Ministries change in S.A. as fast as
Dibbs policy changes in N.S. W., so that one is not
surprised to find that Kingston has been a member
of four Ministries since June, 1884, He is now
Premier of a unique Cabinet—one which, until
Playford grabbed the Agency-General, consisted
of a Premier, three ex-Premiers and two other ex-
Ministers. It has lasted a year now, but June is
a dangerous month for Ministries in Adelaide.
® Irish-Australian is—well, be is not cold-
blooded, and Kingston has shaved pretty closely the
rock upon which more than one great leader split.
But he has no small vices ; and this, with his at-
tempt to give the parliamentary suffrage to women,
keeps him solid with the W.C.T.U. and other
pious organisations. He is undoubtedly a strong
man. What other public man in Australia could
have held his head up against the storm of laugh-
ter which shook the Continent when he wanted to
fight a duel with an opponent ? Dibbs is still
Premier of N.S. W., though he walks about with a
variety of small arms in his trousers pocket. But
how long would he be in public life if he were to
send a revolver across to Parkes, with the polite
request that he would stroll down before
lunch to the Post Office Place and get shot?
• efc a ,f® w months after Kingston had been
ignominiously bound over by a police magis-
trate to keep the peace he became Pre-
mier of his province. Perhaps the fact that
the other fellow was a O.M.G. was taken as an
extenuating circumstance. But that’s Kingston all
over—the football part of him. He is popular out
of doors; not popular, but feared in the Assembly.
Few members care to stand up against him when
he is in a nasty mood. The Bulletin knows
only of one in the S.A. Parliament who would bo
his match —and that is the silver-tongued Gordon,
who wiped the floor so beautifully with Parkes at
the Convention. “The most polished and bril-
liant satire I ever listened to,” said Hori
Grey. But Gordon is in the Upper House
and Kingston’s Chief Secretary. In a set
«peech, Kingston is wearisome, patchy, legal.
As a debater, he is ready, quick and tell-
ing. In private life his eloquence is what may
be called forcible —almost John Robertsonian.
His sentences are punctuated also with sharp
interrogatory grunts, and the mystery is how he
gets rid of all these eccentricities when he puts on
his wig and goes into Court. For—another
puzzling thing—this most democratic of Austra-
lian Premiers is a lawyer. A very good lawyer,
too, and a Q.O. Of course, his practice is not as
large as it would have been had he not gone
into politics and mines and other expensive
things. The working classes have a good
friend in Kingston, Q. 0., and—after their
manner—they are none too grateful. King-
ston is now only 44. His greatest work
hitherto has been helping to establish Protection
for protective purposes in S. A. What he will do
in the future, given the ordinary span of life, is to
be measured only by his will. A little less of the
lawyer-politician, a little less of the football-
barracker, a little less of the —ahem!—rock. Then,
he has but to help the progressive party, to guide
it along with his keen perception of danger, his
hearty contempt of “respectable” traitors, his
bluff geniality and good temper. There is no
public man in Australia who has it in his power
to do more good to the cause of democracy than
Charles Cameron Kingston.
The patch of bad weather which struck
Sydney about the last day of May was foretold
by N.S.W. Astronomer Russell three weeks in
advance. This breaks Damp Wrague’s record.
A funny story is current in Melbourne
concerning the deal made by Speaker Bent for the
gorgeous gold-braided official coat of ex-Speake?
Matthew Davies—which, they say, originally cost
45500.
The Australian Star’s foreign authority
makes a ghastly mess of the late Bulgarian insur-
rection, which disturbance it locates in Servia.
Also, it is under an impression that the famous
Stambouloff is a Servian statesman, and that Sofia
is somewhere about Belgrade. Yet when an Eng-
lish paper thinks that Bendigo is in Tasmania,
near Cooktown, the Stab’s lofty contempt for its
ignorance is a spectacle for the gods.
Most of the erudite and profoundly incom-
prehensible law-books in Sydney Public Library
are stored on the top shelf. Consequently John
Norton can now mostly be found on the extreme
top of a tall ladder, where he is busy getting up
his case against Crick for the Privy Council. The
ladder isn’t strong enough to bear two, so John’s
friends, when they want to communicate, have to
coo-ey to him from the floor below.
It is said that the first week the Linotype
was working at Sydney D.T. office with raw
hands, the setting cost lid. a thousand; next
week it was 7d., and the following week s|d.
About 40 cols, a day were being set per machine
up to the end of last week, and the proprietors
ultimately reckon that the setting of the paper
will be done for fid. a thousand, instead of, as by
hand, Is. Id. —a saving of over 45100 a week,
after labour, supervision and interest on cost of
machinery have been paid for.
Vincent Pyke, of Maoriland, is dead. He
was an aged and bitter politician who made
sundry respectable failures in literature and left
much eloquent vituperation in Hansard. He
died partly of old age and partly, in all pro-
bability, of the Otago Central railway, which un-
finished white elephant preyed on his mind for
many years. The Bulletin has told many
interesting anecdotes about him, but he always
wrote and contradicted them in vigorous language.
Taking him all round Pyke’s strongest feature
was that he was the most contradictory man in or
out of Maoriland.
At recent S.A. elections, because the
Labour-men would not pledge themselves against
option, the Bung interest went to the Ass
aide in every case. Likewise, the party lost the
Catholic vote,” owing to its adhesion to free,
secular, and compulsory education—Whelan, for
instance, robbing them of the second seat in the
Central District, although he didn’t get it him«
i j , Had we chosen to compromise,” said
leader M‘Pherson, “we could have swept the
polls.”
“Well, we die to-morrow,” said Mont-
gomery to Williams at an interview on the night
before the hanging. “Yes,” said Williams; “I
suppose we shall meet again?” “I think so,”
said Montgomery. “Oh,” replied Williams,
shouldn’t say *1 think;’ you should be
sure. When the bushrangers Scott and Rogan
were hanged at Darlinghurst, 14 years ago, for
the murder of Constable Bowen, Scott turned to
xCogan and held out his hand: “Goodbye, old
man . Good-bye! And yet they were going the
same way ? e
London Times has no sympathy with R.
. Stevenson’s Samoan grievances. There are
signsthat the cult of this much-beboomed author
is dying out. People are tired of waiting for the
great work which has been so long coming and
never comes. Stevenson’s fame was founded
mainly on the praise of a little knot of academic
critics like Andrew Lang who scratch one
another s backs in the London magazines, and
who have whittled away so long at the perfection
or form that they have lost the power to judge
matter. Stevenson’s best work is in his essays,
which give full play to his wonderful talent for
literary workmanship; his novels are childish, and
nis poems aren’t poetry.
Judge Tom Brown Hughes, who con-
sistently butters and is buttered by Parkes, writes
to London Times that “ the reforms in education,
the land laws, registration, and the suffrage, which
• na *u -o'**’'' mos * ! democratic community
in the Himpire, were more Parkes’s work than that
of any other man.” A little further down, it ap-
pears that this astounding news is derived from
Parkes s own book—“ Fifty Years in the Making
of Australian History.” Exactly; “ L’ttdt, c’est
Baid Louis XIV. “Haustralia, that’s
ME,” says Parkes,
The recently-deceased Marquis of Ailes-
bury, after “blowing” a million or so in a
very few years, died in humble lodgings in
xsnxton, where his board and his wash-bill were
defrayed by his sister and her husband, Sievier-
button, the bookmaker. He sold everything he
could sell save his liver, and had he known the
appallingly diseased state of that organ and its
value as a curiosity, as revealed by recent mail
advices, he would probably have raised money on
it also. Ailesbury’s liver, it now appears, is about
the most wonderful organ of its kind ever held
up on a fork for the observation of a medical class.

The drollest passage in the Vic. Governor’s
speech last week related to missionary Robert
Reid ; During the recess the Minister of Defence
has been entrusted with the negotiation in Eng-
land, the United States and Canada, of many im-
portant affairs connected with the commerce of
this country. Besides accomplishing other valu-
able work he has paved the way for important
undertakings connected with our surplus pro-
duce. The truth about Reid is that he was sent
forth on the pretence of doing things which he
never made the faintest show of meaning to do
when he arrived at his destination. All sorts of
strange suppositions are hazarded as to the real
why and wherefore of Reid’s palpable sham
mission.” Unless he went abroad to talk Free-
trade the reason of his pilgrimage is probably
known only to his gassy self.
Extract from the election address of King
O’Malley, a wild Irish candidate in S.A. :
I am for the total annihilation of rowdy hoodlum mules.
Theatres and public halls where citizens gather to discuss
political and other moral subjects should contain iron
cages for the incarceration of the arrogant, ring-tail
brainless mules who afflict and shock the audience by
their senseless vulgar braying at the speakers. These
lineal descendants of Balaam’s ass, devoid of all psycho-
logical attainments of their illustrious progenitor, must
be either reformed or muzzled. The political kicking
mule has assumed such stupendous proportions that it
behoves the citizens to array themselves on the side of
essential reforms and outraged privileges. These con-
tinually interrupting hybrids must be squelched, other-
wise the boasted expression, “Britons never will be
slaves," is a mockery, and free speech a thing of the past
in these colonies. An eminent anatomical analyst declares
that the brains of all the disturbing-public-meeting mules
on earth placed in the quill of an American humming-
bird and blown into the eye of a flea would not make it
wink. These self-opinionated selfish mules, with no pride
of ancestry or hope of posterity, boiling over with ..Ten-
sive disregard of other people’s rights, are an everlasting
pest upon mankind, a perpetual blot upon the bright
horizon of human existence.
Quite naturally, being mules, they have “no hop®
of posterity.” A mule never has any posterity.

M‘Millan, M.P., brought down N.S.W.
Assembly when, during the adjournment dis-
cussion on the Montgomery-Williams hanging
case he asserted that members who voted against
the Government would be false to their oaths.
But what is there in such a fulmination ? Mem-
bers taking their seats swear to maintain law as
expressed by the Executive, certainly, but that
oath is quite compatible with the endeavouring to
make the Executive go straight. M'Millan’s
bunday-school interpretation of members’ obliga-
tions makes them the dumbest driven cattle on
the most supreme of human questions. There is
no blood in softgoods.
A Queensland sugar expert recently told
the Courier that for a very long time to come the
Queensland output cannot affect the world’s
market appreciably. This year it will be about
100,000 tons, which is less than the annual varia-
tion of the Cuban crop, for example, which
averages from 700,000 to 900,000 tons 1 It will
take till 1897 before Australia can supply Austra-
lasian consumption. If the United States admit
sugar free it will give production a great impetus.

The daily press, in its report of Mont-
gomery’s execution at Darlinghurst, was tolerably
unanimous on one point—that he maintained a
“ cold and callous demeanour ”to the last. When
the Emperor Maximilian, and his accomplices,
Miramon and Mejia, went out laughing and chat-
ting, to be shot at Queretero, the public was filled
with admiration at their fortitude ; when a retail
murderer goes out to be hanged in the same cheer-
ful fashion, it is merely remarked that he died
impenitent and conducted himself indecently in
his last moments. When Nagy Sandor was hanged
by the Austrians in ’49 and said nothing, he was
described as dying like a Christian ; when Mont-
gomery is hanged by Nosey Bob and says nothing
he is cold and callous. It seems to be almost im-
possible for a poor man to be hanged in a manner
that will satisfy the daily papers. How does the
daily paper want a man to be hanged, anyhow ?
Rev, F, Hastings, formerly an Adelaide
parson, is doing Paraguay for S. A, Advertiser,

From a recent letter :
We sit up on a stool, and lean not against the cracked
wall for fear of crickets. Large and slimy they seem
everywhere. We are told at once to be careful, as the
destructive insects not only eat into clothes but eat the
hair from children’s heads and tips from the fingers
The very next morning Miss Sibbald showed me her
forefinger, from which the outer skin had been nibbled in
the night, leaving the red exposed tip very sore. “ Be-
ware, too, of the jiggers,” said young Sibbald ; “ I have
taken 40 out of my feet to-day.” This was not very
cheering the first night. We enquire what to do and
how to avoid them. “ They are smaller than fleas, bur-
row in the skin, lay eggs, create swellings.” All you can
do is pick them out when you find them. Don’t leave
your boots on the ground; they like to get in boots.
Sibbald who, by the way, is an Adelaidean and
one of the ablest men on the settlement, “didn’t
care about saying anything against Lane,” but
private letters to Adelaide to friends contain
warnings not to leave S. A. “just yet.”
Editor Bulletin.— Sir,—ln the interest-
of truth and justice let me protest against the state
ment in your issue of 26th ult. that the yacht
Wanderer was a piratical vessel on a blackbirding
cruise when Mr. Ben Boyd so mysteriously dis-
appeared in ’5l, as it has no foundation in fact.
The Wanderer (then on a voyage from Frisco to
Sydney) merely called in at San Christoval, and
Mr. Boyd went ashore with his gun and took a
kanaka boy with him; nothing was ever definitely
known as to his fate. The master (Ottwell)
then made for this coast and anchored off
Port Macquarie. There was no Government
pilot here then but the master of the Eliza-
beth Cohen (Mr. George Easton, now living
at Ballma), then lying in the port, was engaged
to bring her in, but as she drew much more water
than there was on the bar she hammered in
until she struck the rocks and became a total
wreck. The only other white men on board were
Messrs. Crawford, Baines, and Webster. She
had a splendid collection of valuables and curios
on board, over which many of the people here
exercised more than manorial rights, and several
mementoes of the affair still adorn the dwellings
of some present residents. The whole affair was a
most mysterious one, and one which will probably
never be solved.— Veritas, Port Macquarie, 29th
May, ’9l.
The discovery at Brunswick (Melb.) of the
remains of a child partially devoured by dogs
recalls a South Australian incident of long ago.
On the Robertsons’ station none but Scotchmen
were employed, and the pride of the clan was

One fell night M'Dougall took an overdose of

alone remained. The Robertsons have never kept
pigs since.

And when Toby Barton remarked that in his
opinion the Privy Council, if petitioned, would not
give leave to appeal, more than one listener re-
membered bow the arguments of layman Taylor

of the condemned men’s case, it was tyrannous

M ll wraith says there is solid comfort for
Australians in the thought that vid Canada they
can go all the way to England in a British ship or
on British soil. One feels at home in Canada,
mt on crossing the border one is immediately
oonsoious of a foreign atmosphere, so to speak.’’
Which of course, simply means that in Ibyal
stagnant, syndicate-ridden Canada MTI wraith
was bomebody, but as soon as he got into Yankee-
land he found the great American nation didn’t
care two cents about him. Nothing so much
astonishes and disgusts the little-great man with a
large British reputation as to find what an insignifi-
cant worm he is among 60 millions of Americans.
A globe-trotter who visited N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council lately squared out and put his
impressions thus; “There’s Jacob and Pilcher
and a fellow with a double chin and an old cove
without eyebrows, and I’m blessed but they are
equal to anything in the old land? They ate so
downright earnest! Why, they take legislation
as seriously as if it were religion. There’s no
nonsense, no persiflage, no tiddlywinking about
them, or, for the matter of that; about the whole
body of lawmakers. I know what the Senates of
half-a-dozen countries are; have listened to them •
have known the boys; but I never witnessed
solemnity, profound feeling, sacred obligation,
momentous responsibility, such as I observed in
your Council.” That globe-trotter was present
when the Mining on Private Lands Bill was under
discussion.
M Ilwraith (just back from England) prides
himself on being a crack sailor, and used to keep
a small launch on Moreton Bay, where it was one
of the standing amusements of the inhabitants to
watch him running aground on the various shoals,
irm boatmen, too, used to make a regular income
towing Mac. off when he stuck tight. On© day
Jack Hamilton was on board, and when the boat
grounded, as usual, he elected to soull ashore in a
dingy rather than wait for relief; but as the Fat
Man and his partner, Smythe, refused like true
salts to desert the disabled ship, Jack left them
his revolver and a box of cartridges to while away
the time. During the next hour MTlwraith and
bmythe fired 100 rounds at a swan that swam
around the boat, and at last succeeded in killing
it with an oar. It was afterwards found to be a
tamo bird, with its wings cut, the pet of an old
lady in the neighbourhood.
Interviewed by the Review of Reviews
“Rolf Boldrewood ” (T. A. Browne. P.M at
Albury, N.S.W.) appears to have done his best
to live up to such celebrity, and swelled out like
the frog who tried to be an ox. In a series of
snapshot judgments he knocked rival reputations
flying; and when he paused to breathe he stood
alone on the pinnacle of Australian literary fame
Marcus Clarke was hit off in three words—“ A
clever cockney.’’ Poor Marcus ! the only first-
class man of letters that Australia has produced—
“a clever cockney !” Truly, authors—the little
ones—hate other authors—the bigger ones as
women hate the woman who v outshines them.
Why, there was more literary merit in Marcus’s
little finger than there is in Boldrewood’s whole
body. Clarke was an artist; Brown is only a
diarist. Hissingle workof valueis “Robbery Under
Arms ’’—and everything good in that is history,
everything bad is fiction. It is less a story than
the materials of a story. Its interest comes nob
from Mr. Brown, but in spite of him. His awk-
ward, lumbering style has been unable to rob the
facts of their fascination. But in the hands of
Marcus Clarke, with his fund of pathos, his
instinct of the dramatic, what might not “Rob-
bery Under Arms ’’ have become? Perhaps the
superior of His Natural Life,” that hasty pot-
boiler, yet the one memorable prose achievement
in the first hundred years of Australian literature.

No1.-A RIDE IN BLACK MARIA.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I couldn’t pay the moderately large fine, any-
how. It might as well have been a million as far
as I was concerned.
“ This way,” said the policeman; and, very con-
siderately, they placed me in a yard at the rear of
the Police Court, instead of throwing me into the
large room in which were noisily congregated a
company of drunks, thieves and foul-mouthed
gentlemen. For which I was very thankful.
I had left a cab-fare in the “office,” hoping I
might pay my own freight up to Darlinghurst, and
this already isolating distinction somewhat com-
forted me—alas ! —though I confess I fancied I
could have “eaten without salt ” my persecutors,
and I would have been very “ willing ” in a round
or two with the arresting bobby, or even the beak
himself. ... mi m
“ However, I shan’t be here long. They 11 run
me down to my new retreat presently,” thought I.
But I didn’t know what care, attention, and
gratifying honors the officials pay to a Prisoner of
the Crown. And I was now. that personage.
Time : 11 a.m. About two hours later :
“ Want to send for your dinner ? ”
Sharp and harsh came the query through the
iron-gate.
“No.” . . .
Dinner? Would I ever feel like eating again?
The hours sped on in all the gloomy inaccessi-
bility of a jealously-guarded Czar. I could hear
the oaths of the gentlemen in the large room, and it
rather modified the mental satisfaction of my soli-
tary grandeur that they, too, were of exactly the
same official status as myself.
About 4 o’clock—“ This way ! ”
I walked out of that yard to find myself
“ mustered ” with a mixed lot of male and female
prisoners, perhaps two dozen in all. And incon-
tinently thrown—yes, thrown, for I moved slowly
and looked around for my cab !—into the Govern-
ment Coach—Black Maria.
Every city reader has probably seen the lady,
but, in compassion for the very probable ignorance
of country readers, I’ll try and describe the
points. Better still: You shall make one for
yourself.
Recipe : Two shallow railway-trucks ; end them
up and rivet them back-to-back ; put outsides on
them, with a fancy air-grating or two ; steps be-
hind ; high box-seat in front; four wheels, pole,
&c., and you’ll manage decently enough, if
you daub her all over as black as the character
of a politician. I had almost forgotten to tell you
to put in a little trap-door behind, so that the
bobby who rides on the step, even after he has
locked and bolted you in, can spit in at you if he
likes. Also, you can spit out at him, if you like.
Only he has the choice of keeping the trap shut.
You will thus see that Black Maria is a corn-
par tmented female. I believe the general rule is—
“ Ladies to the left and gents to the right.’ But
all the company must be got in somehow, and
well, we blended.
On one side were 15 men; on the other, three
men and five women. I was one of these fortu-
nate three.
One side of Black Maria is more accommodating
than the other —a way with many females who
have a blind side. The reason is that the coffin-
space under the box-seat helps out the accommoda-
tion of one side.
But the awfulness of that jam. It was the
Black Hole of Calcutta on wheels !
And I would here pause to ask—Where are the
Transit Commissioners? The jolting of that
caravan proved that it has very sensitive springs.
Jammed like pigs in a box, we bumped and
bumped and swayed and swayed till we really
longed for the end of the journey. At least I did.
Some day there’ll be an almighty smash, and
then, what an item for the papers ! But I hope
that only the policemen will he killed.
I got jolted fair on to the laps of two weather-
beaten ladies —their generic term, I understand, is
“ haybag ” —who conveyed large impressions of
rum, onions, tobacco, unwashiness, and that wild,
weird odour that, according to Zola, belongs to
the boudoirs of enterprising femininity.
I hadn’t room either to stand upright or sit
down modestly; had the space been there, the
jolts would have prevented the accomplishment of
either feat.
“ For the Lord’s sake, sit on me,” appealingly
shrieked one of the pungent ladies.
“Not even for His sake, madam,” said I
jerkily. I tried to say it politely and reverently,
but the hurricane motion wouldn’t permit it. I
suppose I hadn’t got my Black Maria-legs.
“ Here we are,” said a gentleman.
I heard a whistle sound, and in we lumbered
with a climb and a dive. The machine is backed
up, and the doors are flung open so suddenly that
we are literally shot out, rather mixed up as to
limbs. The police are sometimes zealously expe-
ditious, like schoolboys at the play-rush “ dis-
miss.”
They lined us up and counted us, so as to make
sure none had escaped en route. I wonder will
any marvellous magician of a criminal ever
achieve the ungallant feat of escaping from Black
Maria while in full tear?
“Down those steps”—but the officer needn’t
have said it, for the others all knew the way, and
I followed on, chiefly, I think, because I hadn’t
thanked the aromatic lady for her recent kind
offer. But I never got the chance' until now. If
she sees these lines, I hope she’ll accept my grati-
tude.
Women ahead, we were mustered again in a
dark passage, lest some balloon might have fished
us up and spirited us away ! .
Here we were sorted out: —(1) Committed ; (2)
Remanded ; (3) Sentenced.
I was a three-r.
There was an invisible clerk somewhere behind
a hole, who was the most inquisitive man I ever
knew, for a man who wouldn’t even introduce
himself! Asked me my name, age, country, reli-
gion, crime, everTbeen-in-before, diseases —well, I
forget now if he did ask me about my ailments.
Everyone displayed the greatest interest in me
—measured my height, weighed me, and I won’t
swear that they didn’t snap-camera me. _ And all
without even asking me to put a penny in the slot.
Here we bade the ladies adieu —“ so-long is the
correct expression. . , .
Away through an inner gate, into B wing.
“ Off with your coats and shirts and boots !”
Then they very kindly take charge—without
charge—of all your loose change, jewellery, knives,
pocketbooks, lead-pencils, pipes, keys, pawn-
tickets, papers—yes, and handkerchiefs ! A man
mustn’t get catarrh in Darlinghurst.
And after stripping you stark naked, and giving
you a prison'shirt, they have the gall to enquire
if you’re quite sure you haven't got any tobacco,
or pipes, or knives” about you! And the queer
marvel is that at least one of our squad had all ot
those articles, and matches into the bargain .
File up and march to the dispenser, who asks
how you feel very sympathetically, as the doctor
does afterwards, but all so swiftly as to take away
your breath and faculty for surprise, ihe two
operations were rushed through in less than 1U
minutes. ~
The boozey hands get pick-me-ups, and generally
“all hands ” are extemporaneously “ shaky.
Off to the bath-room, and here it is indeed
express—loo miles a minute, I should say.
I jump into the hot water and am just going to
dip, when —“Come out o’ that bath ; goin ter be
there all day ?” . , ,
“Time seems to be more valuable m here tnan
it is outside ?” I venture to observe to a gentleman
who is putting on the clothes that the Crown has
lent him. . ,
“ Gettin’ on ter five o’clock; screw wants ter
get’ome.” (“Screw” is the gaol vulgate for the
turnkey, or warder). . ,
They run us to the corridor of B wing, and
here again they count us ! Verily they are fond
of me at a moment’s notice, as it were. Lovei at
first sight cannot be nearly as speedy. Drafted
by threes, we are closed up in cells, inspected by
three warders —oh, they don’t neglect you ! and
locked in for the night.
I learn that our apartment —and any similar
one—is vernacularly known as “the peter.
Three long mats and three swags of blankets form
the chief appointments of “ the peter.”
My comrades discuss the qualities of the pick-
me-ups they got, and that adds to my sorrow, for
I hadn’t been “up to” that luxury. Next, they
produce short nose-warmers, weed, and matches,
and my cup of envious misery is full. .
Woe never had such leaden weight as during
that hour I sat on my bundle. At last, I unrolled
it, unbooted, and turned in “all standing. One
gentleman still “ ’ad a horful fit of the shakes,
and kept patronising the watercan.
“ Wos you on the boose when you nicked the
super?” (stole the watch).
“ Oh, no.” . .
The questioner was satisfied with that simple
reply and asked nothing more about the incident.
I wondered. The “nicker” seemed a decent
Scotchman, with an open, trustworthy counten-
ance. What did make him “nick the super ?
Hunger? Or did ho want rain-proof quarters for
awhile? ■ ,
I slept. “ Clang, clang, clang ! at quarter to
six, and I awoke, strangely refreshed. 1 had been
in the cell 12 hours and I had probably slept
I ”” 6 l’ve emptied the blooming water-can, and my
throat’s like a glue-pot,” said the Shaker.
He showed Scotty and me how to fold up out
blankets—“ make our beds 1’ I felt ravenously
hungry, and I said so.
“ You’ll be blooming lucky if you get yer ration
afore 12 to-day; they’ll split us all up into yards
directly, an’ we’re not on the ration-list yet, saia
Shaker. „ . , . , ' ,
The doors are unbolted, there s a rush into the
passage, where some 60 men are straggling along.
I am lined up in the corridor with 30 or so motleys,
and we stand at attention until arrive the
Deputy-Governor and Chief Warder. The muster-
roll is called, and each man files off as his name is
ticked off—except me. I stay where I am, not
knowing where to go. Nervously I ask the first
warder who passes.
“Stand over there !”—pointing to a doorway—
he thunders so fiercely that my blood leaps up to
my face, and then . ,
I understand it all. I am a Prisoner of the
Crown - 0000.
A Quick Calculating Table.
Mr. W, M. Pearson, who has been in the employ
of M‘Burney, Wallis & Co., the well-known byd-
ney wool and produce brokers, since they com-
menced business, has invented a quick way o
calculating the value of hides at the price per lb.
realised, with the trade allowance of six per cent,
tare. The plan has been printed and adopted by
the autioneering firms engaged in the trade, and
it is estimated that the time saved, under the new
method, is more than one half, as compared with
the old system of working out each item, the
invention, while proving a great boon to the pro-
duce trade in our city, will greatly facilitate the
early despatch of returns to owners.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “ Cannalin ” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest.
Parkes has been bombarded with con-
gratulations on the attainment of his 79th birth-
day last Sunday. A Sydney D.l. interviewer
went with a blithesome, springy step to dive into
the old man’s recollections of infancy, and ex-
tracted much information regarding his capacity
for goo-goo utterance and mud-pie manufac-
ture. Singularly enough, however, the veteran
omitted the one thing material, and did not say
that he owes his strength and health, under r rq-
vidence, to a judicious use of Marshall s ionic
Nervine, sold at corner of Regent and Wells
streets, Redfern, and Park and Pitt streets,
Sydney.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On Life’s diverging paths we stood,
We vowed eternal love ;
We swore our faith was limitless
As the wide skies above.
Our voices told in notes of gold
Of love that never could grow cold,
Of faith so pure and courage bold,
And wit to win and strength to hold
The hearts we loved of old.
Now, in the desolate to-day,
Our lonely paths are still
Divided by the iron sway
Of Destiny’s harsh will.
Eastward or west, to toil addressed
I strive and labour without rest,
To gain the prize I deem most blest.
To lay my head upon the breast
Of her I loved of old.
In the dim future’s avenue
I see her smiling there ;
I see the sunlight falling through
The leaves—upon her hair.
Oh, Destiny ! relax thy will—
Help me my promise to fulfil.
Oh, Qod ! turn back thy ceaseless mill,
I swear I will possess her still—
Her whom I loved of old.

Moderator Rentoul, on his last trip from
Europe by mail steamer, was asked to preach to
the second-class passengers, but languidly replied
that iti was “ too hot.” It is a comfort to think
that, if this is any guide, there are no sermons
down below. Hell is gradually being shorn of its
terrors.
-^ n . alleged bigamist, now awaiting trial in
Maoriland, differs a little from ordinary bigamists,
inasmuch as his first wife is said to be also his
half-sister. The lady, it is alleged, married him
under an assumed name, so as to avoid notice,
and then they lived unhappily for six months, at
the end of which period the husband fled and
married somebody else’s sister. Some more than
usually cheerful revelations are hoped for.
Yarra Bend Asylum (Melb.) is haunted by
a cured patient who fell in love with a stalwart
female warder during his term in the asylum, and
Insists ° n breakin K ’ n again to “see his girl.”
When he can’t get in to see his girl he sings love-
ballads in a minor key over the wall and heaves
tender communications across. There is difficulty I
in finding a law to meet his ease, so he has been i
arrested for vagrancy and remanded pending an
inquiry into his sanity.
Parson Isitt, the Maoriland teetotaller,
tells an interesting story to show how Heaven
protects the dry, serious apostle. During the last
electoral campaign some of the liquor-party, he I
asserts, laid for him on a lonesome road, with a
view to giving him a wholesome and vigorous
correction with sticks. But, unfortunately, they
didn t know Pastor Isitt by sight, and he tripped
past on his light clerical toe unmolested. Then
another preacher came along, and the party some-
how decided that he was Isitt, and gave him
beans; and when the victim had finished receiving
that vegetable, he was turned loose to go his
bruised and miserable way, while the aggressors
went home rejoicing. This is the sort of divine
interposition which we are always hearing about;
one man is providentially saved, and, as a conse-
quence, another man is providentially walloped.
Only it is never the man who was providentially
walloped who tells the story.
Colemane & Sons’ Vic. Ointment is marvellous.
The other day there landed in Melbourne,
along with a, consignment of other destitute
Asiatics, a dirty and unabashed nigger with
absolutely nothing on save a rag round his waist.
He had no luggage, no money, no hat, no boots,
no home, prospects, letters of introduction to the
Governor—nothing, in fact, save the aforesaid
rag. The authorities were horrified when they
saw this apparition stepping ashore, and sent him
on board again while they hunted up some statute
under which he could be arrested and sent back.
But there wasn’t any. Had he been insane he
might have been captured and detained, but being
in his right mind, what there was of it, and with
his cummerbund on, there was no Act to meet
the case. So the Pathan and his rag came ashore,
and vanished somewhere down Lily Boulke-stleet,
and hasn’t been heard of since. Why he wasn’t
arrested for “ disorderly conduct ” doesn’t appear.
Dear Bulletin, —It is not uncommon to
see in democratic papers denunciations of those
who “receiverents from immoral houses.” Some-
times these pars, originate with Mr. Editor or his
contributors, sometimes they simply report how
Miss W. C. T. U. Skarekro blasted Tottie’s land-
lord. But where is the “ sweet reasonableness ”
of these denunciations? It has long since, by
failures innumerable, been shown to be impossible
to reform Tottie under our present “civili-
sation ” (of which she is a natural product).
Is she, then, to be turned out of house and com-
pelled to sleep under the Market verandah, or in
the Domain? Or is she to be let occupy dwellings
rent-free ? It seems to me it is no worse for a
landlord to accept blackmail from a golden-haired
nymph than from the Chief Gimlet Bearer of the
Social Purity Brigade. When we abolish the
rent-robber, the interest-robber, and the profit-
robber, Tottie will have a fair chance to make a
comfortable living in a decent way, and, in the
meantime, men ought not to be abused for taking
rent from her any more than for taking it from
others.— E. W. Jonson. [The point of the accu-
sation against those who draw rents from
“ immoral ” houses is not the fact that they
provide shelter for social outcasts, but that
they advantage themselves of those outcasts’
necessities to screw from them bigger rents than
could be charged to persons not under asocial
ban. Also, that in many cases Tottie’s grinding
landlord is a “moral” citizen whose professed
horror of the “social evil ’is a most impressive
sentiment.—Ed. B.]

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Stewart, riding his grey stallion and lead-
ing the horse his wife had used the day before,
passed through Sturt’s Meadows and entered the
narrow track leading to Fowler’s Gap. He had
left Broken Hill at dawn on the previous day,
and had camped a few hours at Gardiner’s Creek.
The time was just 3 a.m. The moon had set an
hour before, and the only light was the phos-
phorescent gleam of the mineral salts in the drifts
which the horses frequently shattered in their
stride. Then the fragments of encrusted salts
flow into the air in pieces like dead white glass,
and fell again on the rocky pathway with a ring-
ing noise. The slipping of the horses’-hoofs on
the slugs of ironstone and boulders of rotten
granite, the clear, deep, breathing of the animals,
and the creaking of the rider’s saddletree were,
with this, the only sounds to rescue the Gap from
an unbearable silence. The dew fell so heavily
that it made little rivulets on the smooth rock
walls. The flashes rising from the sombre drifts
showed the frequent fissures in the track, which
looked blacker even than reality, by reason of the
ghostly and intermittent light.
There is something awful in the Barrier in the
hours just before the dawn. When the wonderful
white moon shines on the salt deposits, its re-
flected brilliance is the brilliance of millions of
electric-lamps. But when the moon has set, the
darkness is the darkness of the great depths of the
sea.
Occasionally Stewart’s horse stumbled into a
colony of kangaroos, and the silence was broken
by the numberless thuds of their leapings as they
made for the plain—the unnatural sound of flesh
striking rock—at his stirrup at first, and then
fainter, fainter, down the slope of the range. A
great bat dashes into the eyes of the rider and
moves the leaden air a little, and then the steady
“flap-flap” of an owl’s wing breaks the silence.
But there is no light given to distinguish shapes,
and the sounds are all mysterious and unaccount-
able.
At other times the horseman had felt somewhat
nervous when passing through the long corridor
of the Gap, whose walls were so delicately balanced
that it seemed a word would bring them about the
ears of the speaker; but this morning the sur-
roundings suited his mood, and he enjoyed the
dreadful silence and the inexpressible darkness.
At last they passed the Gap, and the horses,
with a snort of relief, plunged into the knee-deep
sand of the plain. By-and-by they came to a
small, rugged rise, and on the top of this a mys-
terious light seemed to play. Stewart knew the
spot well enough Some crank who believed he
could strike a silver lode in the hungry, baked-
clay country had shafted the rise to water level,
and a flock of thirst-maddened sheep had gone
down the shaft, enticed by the mineralised water
at the bottom. Sheep-like—and human-like, for
that malt had followed their leader, and
had filled the shaft to within three feet of the
Surface.
There they lay, 20 feet of rotting flesh and
fleece. The exhalations from this mass of cor-
ruption loaded the air so that a light seemed to
Play over the shaft. Stewart’s eyes were tired of
the darkness, and he pulled up his horse and gazed
at the spectral flame. The gloom had impressed
him that night with an enhanced awfulness. He
had seen the darkness, and the gleams of the salt
in the drifts, and the vague broken shapes of the
night-birds of the Gap, and had seen them all
through a veil of deadly rage. Now, as he gazed
at the luminous belt of air above the dead sheep,
he saw two scenes—and through the same veil.
He saw himself in all the glory of young blood
leading his wife from the church at Echuca on
their wedding-day. And he saw, further back
again, the same girl clasping her arms round his
old self s neck, and heard her say to his old self,
“I'll marry nobody but you, Jack. I wouldn’t
have the best man alive —if you weren’t the best.”
And he saw his old self and his old self’s wife
burying their child in the quiet necropolis of the
Campaspe, and heard words of that time : “This
will only bring us closer together, dear.”
. As the scene passed out of his memory he
sighed his relief as one redeemed from Hell’s
agonies, but inexorable memory showed him the
scene of yesterday—the scene he had thought over
till_ every thought became a pain. He saw the
claim on Mountain Boon which he and his mate,
Foster, had prospected so successfully, and the
windlass turning under his own skilled power,
and the mullock-tip, and the hut, and Foster’s
tent a hundred yards away, and the dogs looking
greedily at the kangaroo-meat suspended from the
ridge-pole, and Foster’s pet, the great Jew-lizard,
laughing horribly in the deep, red dust. And he
saw himself two days ago, saddling the horses;
for his wife was setting out for Adelaide that day,
and they were to start before the sun was well up.
And at dawn, as he was leading in the mare, he
saw his wife and Foster together.
They had not thought the mare was to be
caught so easily. They believed the man they
wronged would be absent a long time.
Stewart takes the bridle off the mare, and she
returns to her meal of salt-bush ; while her master
approaches the pair under cover of the hut, the
deep dust silencing his footfalls.
Foster is standing in front of the hut, and
Stewart, always an honest man, compares his
physical charms with those of the younger man—
very much to his own disadvantage. Foster is a
rather taller and fleshier man than Stewart, and is
by far the finer animal, but, like most fine-animal
humans, he has little or no intellectualism.
Stewart proves his possession of high, though un-
cultured, intellect by his neglect to act at
once on his discovery. If he did not have
brains he would rush to the front of the hut
and kill his wife and her paramour by knife
or revolver. But Stewart is a man who recognises
fully, though unconsciously, that the exquisite joy
of revenge is more in the planning of it than in its
actual execution. So he catches his breath
sharply, as if he would strangle it for fear it
should betray him.
His wife is speaking. “ Oh, Harry,” she says,
with an intonation which has a subtle mixture of
fear and love and remorse and worship, “isn’t my
caring for you wrong ? Isn’t it a sin to poor
Jack?”
At this Stewart feels that he could go to her
and take her in his arms, bub Foster answers
jeeringly—laughing with the unconscious brutality
of the animal.
“ It’s a bit too late to play that game,” he says ;
“ why the baby 1 - ”
She stops him with, “For God’s sake don’t,
He might hear.”
Stewart, hearing this, catches at his throat as if
he were choking. Foster goes on in his brutal
fashion, delighting to play with this silly woman
whose whole life is merged in his :
“Look here, Bella, if you are goin’ to cut up
like this I won’t be here when you come back,
I’ll sell my share of the claim to Stewart and’’
She stops him with a little gasping cry, and
Stewart feels that she has thrown her arms around
the Judas he had known and trusted as his mate,
Blindly and silently the wronged man gropes his
way back to where the mare is quietly feeding,
He feels only a great pity for the woman, but
he has noted every jeering word uttered by loster,
and has devised a new torture for every sneer.
He bridles the mare and leads her back, and
having saddled both horses goes into the hut, and
takes his breakfast, silently. 1 hey do not notice
him he is always slow of speech, and evidently
very stupid. He gives them an opportunity to
bid each other good-bye without the restraining
influence of his presence and at seven o clockdie
setoff with his wifeon the long drearyr.de to the
Sitting here on horseback in the gloom this
morning he sees all these events pass before him,
again experiences the temptation to kill the
woman in the Gap, and his faint-heartedness when
they had come to the place he had marked for her
grave. So he had let her live, and had put her on
the Adelaide-bound train at Broken Hill, and had
even kissed her on the cheek at parting. He did
not love her enough to kill her-she seemed to him
so weakly, passively criminal, so unutterably
despicable, that he merely pitied her.
„ • 7 1 “,
The picture seen through the veil of old scenes—
widely apart, one from the other, but seemingly
contemporaneous—passed away, but as he turned
his horse s head from the grave of the sheep .and
took up the track, the air trembled and the
ground seemed to shiver with anticipation.
In that solemn hour, just before the dawn, when
man and beast and leaf are at their weakest, it
seems as if the whole world lay anxious under
sentence of death awaiting the coming of the
executioner. And then, as horses and rider turned
a lack-lustre eye on the earth and forgot even
revenge and hunger in the awful tension of the
moment, aspire of chrome shot up from the horizon.
The daily resurrection had come once again—the
world was reprieved for sixteen hours. Then,
with the rapidity characteristic of the latitude,
beams stretched fanwise over range and gully,
the sun leaped from behind the hills, and it was
day.
The light brought Stewart back to the planning
of his vengeance. Sorrow had given him inspira-
tion, and the revenge he planned was terrible in
its ingenuity. The grey stepped out with a vigour
born of the sunrise, and at 10 o’clock Stewart left
the main track and twisted through the salt bush
to the summit of Mountain Boon.
Foster acknowledged his mate’s return with a
cheerful nod, and an intimation that breakfast
was spoiling for the eating. Stewart brewed a
fresh billy of tea, and ate with the appetite be-
fitting his long night ride. Foster filled his pipe
and sat in the door of the hub, smoking medita-
tively.
“ More you drive on that lode, better it shows,”
he said briefly at last.
Stewart looked up inquiringly, and the Hand-
some Animal continued : “Don’t know how all
those Jew-lizards and things come in the well of
that shaft. S’pose they go after the water. Look
here, George, soon as we raise a few tons more I’m
going to Adelaide for a spell.’’
Stewart said “ Yes ” as if he had no interest in
the matter, but all the while the fires of jealousy
were burning within him. Going to Adelaide,
was he? —to meet the woman, of course !
Foster rattled on about his plans while the
elder man gloated over his prospective revenge on
the fine young bodily personality that had come
between him and his wife. And as one chattered
carelessly of his intended spree, the other re-
arranged his place of vengeance again and yet
again, and at each re-arrangement that vengeance
took a shape more terrible than the last.
According to the sensible custom pursued by the
prospectors of Mountain Boon, Foster slept from
noon until four o’clock. Stewart, who was sup-
posed to be resting, did not stay in the hut. He
did a little work about the shaft, and packed a
few necessaries in a valise, which he strapped on
his saddle as it lay on his bed-place in the hut.
Extraordinary work this for early afternoon in
the Barrier summer, but that which followed it
was even more extraordinary.
The grey stallion had just finished a journey of
nearly a hundred miles, and yet Stewart had
turned him out belled. At four o’clock he called
Foster and told him it was time to go below,
Foster got up grumblingly and accompanied his
mate to the shaft.
The usual procedure was this. Stewart, being
an old sailor-man and as active as a monkey in
the matter of swarming up and down ropes,
lowered Foster to the drive and then climbed
down the rope himself. On this day, as Foster
stepped into the green-hide bucket and said
“Lower away,” a stone fell from the heap of
mullock about the shaft and plunged into the
gloom of the well. Then a faint hiss arose.
“By the old Harry,” said Foster, “there’s
some uncanny reptiles down there. It’s about
250 feet deep. I wouldn’t like to be among ’em.”
“ I don’t suppose you would,” returned Stewart,
quietly, as the. windlass revolved slowly, and
Foster dropped into the shaft.
The lowest drive had been put in at a depth of
210 feet. Then, finding they had followed a
stringer, and that the real ore body was above
them, they had driven again at 40 feet. When
about 30 feet of rope had run off the wind-
lass drum, Stewart placed the loop of the brake-
rope over the handle and looked down. Fosters
eyes were turned to the shaft’s mouth, and he was
about to ask angrily the reason of the stoppage,
when he saw the burning eyes of his mate looking
into his very soul, and without knowing why he
grew sick with fear.
“I’m not going to lower any further,” said the
voice of Stewart, quavering and breaking with,
every convulsion of his passion. “ An’you can’t,
climb up the rope. You’re a dead man, sure-
enough,”
The horror of the situation rendered Foster
almost speechless. He could only say, gaspingly :
“ What are you going to do ?”
“Oh, you know what you’ve done, do you.
You’re goin’ to have a nice little spree with Bella,
in Adelaide, aren’t you?” And then savagely :
“You dirty fraud. You think you can steal my
wife and go free. By the Lord God, you can’t
—you’re booked. Now, what will you give if I
haul you up again ?”
Foster found his voice again and Answered

eagerly, “ The claim’s a fortune. I’ll give you my
share.”
Stewart laughed raspingly. “You’re not bad,”
he said; “ the claim’s mine. I can kill you and
take your share without any trouble.”
Foster shrieked.
“D’ye know anything about the claim that I
don’t know, then? Let’s see if you can offer
enough for your life.”
The doomed man, sick and giddy with his
awful position and the swaying of the rope,
croaked rather than said: “Yes, weke on the
wrong track for the big lode. If we just put a
few big blasts in the top drive in this side we’d
open out on the heaviest stuff,”
“A good idea,” said Stewart approvingly;
“we’ll do that ”
m, . ‘ , .. , , L , .
The man m the shaft began to pour out his
thanks, but the Nemesis above stopped him.
“ You needn’t be so thankful,” he said ; “ you’ll
never leave that shaft again. I’ll find the lode
with the shots, but you’ll stay below when they’re
fired. An’ now you can say your pnyrers. I’ll
give you 10 minutes an’ I’ve said my last word to
you, ’cept to tell you the time.” _
So saying, he took out his great steel watch and
placed it before him on the platform. Then he
released the rope from its fastenings on the drum
of the windlass, and taking a single turn with it
round a projecting timber, uttered the words,
wo minutes.
The man below had been driven almost mad by
his terror and was only saved from falling out of
the bucket by his fingers convulsively and in-
stmctively clutching the rope. He threatened and
raved and entreated adopting a more piteous tone
as the watch ticked out its time and the time-
keeper of Death called out the minutes.
Then Foster tried to climb the rope, but the
late above let it slip a few inches and the doomed
man dug his nails into the soft mica formation of
the shaft and felt life crumbling in bis fingers.
And he looked at the top drive, and it was but
10 feet below him ; but as far away as Mercy and
the stars. _
‘ Nine minutes,” said the Fate. The victim
ha,d broken out into weeping and praying a few
minutes earlier, but now the fount of his tears
had dried up and he trembled at the end of the
rope, his handsome, stupid face working con-
yulsively, and his dry lips trying to form unavail-
ing words.
The rope dropped a few inches, and the new
terror unlocking his lips he gasped sobbing—
“ Not yet—my God—oh, my God ! ” _
“ Ten minutes, ’ said Stewart decisively, freeing
the rope from the timber.
A shriek, the quick rush of a falling body, the
Binging of a rope cutting the denser air of the
shaft, then the half-liquid crash of flesh striking
rock and _ water, half inarticulate moans, the
sound of sinuous bodies disturbed and attacking
the invader; then silence.
Stewart bent oyer the shaft feeling the fierce
exultation of the tiger which has killed the hunter
who robbed her of her whelps. Love is a great
educator, but revenge is a greater. This com-
monplace, stolid, almost stupid man, inspired
by his wrongs, had reached an extraordinary
height of intellectuality. The retributive jus-
tice of which he had been the instrument
raised him above the level of men. The pall
of the hereafter was for a moment lifted, and he
saw the light behind the light of the sun. He
saw that said “Vengeance is mine,”
because vengeance is the greatest pleasure, and he
knew that by working his own revenge he had
made himself a god.
Stewart returned from the hut with two new
ropes and a long fuse coiled around his shoulders,
and staggering under the burden of a green-hide
bucket full of cartridges,
“Raekarock’s a good sexton,” he said to him-
self, cheerfully, as he deposited his burden on the
mullock-tip.
Slinging his bucket on one of the ropes, he
lowered it down the shaft until it swayed gently
on a level with the entrance of the drive. Then
he fastened the other and stronger rope, which
was knotted at frequent intervals, to the frame of
the windlass, coiled the fuse around his shoulders
and dropped into the shaft. He quickly reached
the drive and swung himself into the entrance.
Then he drew the bucket towards him, and after
lighting a candle, carried it along the drive. The
face already showed the value of the lode the blast
was intended to discover. It was only a spur,
but bunches of chloride lay on the floor, and the
ore in front was rich and rotten, and of the con-
sistency of crumbling cheese. Quickly the pick
made a chamber for the explosive—then Stewart
carefully placed the,,cartridges with their right
ends touching the fuse.
Aslip-a stumble-and the slight resultant
concussion would have blown him to fragments;
but he did not think of the danger . one
thing, he was too busy, and, besides, when a man
has lived long enough to crush his enemy it seems
terribly difficult to die. A perfect revenge makes
a man seem immortal to himself,
Stewart finished his perilous task, and after
extinguishing the candle groped his way towards
the shaft) uncoi i ing the fuse as he proceeded. He
reached the shaft, secured the knotted ropp, and
then, laying the fuse on the ground, prepared to
light it. But some indefinable desire to make his
revenge still more complete prompted him to
speak again with his enemy. Ho he hailed him :
“ Hulloa, Harry !”
A faint voice, wrung with pain, came from the
well. “I thought you’d gone, Jack. You’ve
murdered me—my thigh’s broken.”
“1 won’t make your misery long,” said the
other voice, very calmly and evenly ; “I’ve got a
20-minute fuse. I’ll say you couldn’t get away
from the blast in time.”
And then he added, softly, as if he hated his
own revenge and loved his enemy, “Good-bye!”
Foster did not answer. Either he had fainted or,
proud animal that he was, he refused to plead
again for lus life. Stewart lit the fuse and, swing-
ing himself on the rope, climbed into the day now
nearly at an end.
A roar as of the loudest thunder, puffs of smoke
from where the shaft had been, the earth vomit-
ing stones and dust, and then the dyke of hard
country surrounding the new lode falls away and
leaves a great green and white glitteringness of
ore, standing in a sharp and defined ridge like the
back of a razor,
Stewart, watching half-way down the slope of
Mountain Boon, saw that the hut and the tent
near the shaft were untouched. He could say he
had fled to the sanctuary of the tent on the first
heave of the ground, and had so escaped destruc-
tion.
Returning to the top of the mountain and find-
ing that the new “blow” exceeded his expecta-
tions he methodically pegged out new application
areas. Then he caught his horse, saddled it, and
mounted. When the dusk closed in his tired
horse was striding through the sand again, and
looking back the new mining magnate saw the
halt-wrecked hut on Mountain Boon, dimly out-
lined against the sky.
Near the entrance to Fowler’s Gap he heard the
bleating of a lamb deserted or lost by its mother.
He looked around him and found the little
creature lying in the dust just off the track. He
dismounted to take it up, and rode on his way
with the lamb nestling behind the valise.
He was always kind to animals.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In Marion Crawford’s novel of this name the love of a
woman gave the object of it a soul, which he did not
before possess.
I have a shrine, the fire is dim,
The zealot’s heart is sad,
No deity appears to him,
No Vision makes him glad.
But aye in loyal hope content
Pie waits her pleasure still,
On true devotion lowly bent
And subject to her will.
And will the goddess turn and deign
To smile upon her slave,
Or shall the torment and the pain
For ever vex his grave ?
Some idol every man must hold
As radiant, all-divine,
And I the bold am over-bold
Since, lady, you are mine.
I have no lordly roll of fame
To sway thy woman-heart;
I have not might thy soul to claim
And crush the meaner part.
And great thoughts surging in the soul
But feeble utterance find ;
And wide the gulfs for ever roll
Between the speech and mind.
But still I feel, the while I scan
Those glorious orbs of light,
That for a moment I am Man
And champion of the right.
All evil phantoms swiftly flee
Thy radiant glance before,
Thy voice the music of a sea
That laps no mortal shore.
Words can but dimly utter thought
But kindred souls commune
Sweet variations nature-wrought
On one familiar tune.
And only by thy side, sweet friend.
And suppliant at thy feet
The airs divine in softness blend
In harmony complete.
I said I had no roll of fame—
If some bold charm for thee
The earth shall as one voice proclaim
The deeds that mine shall be ;
Or if the poet’s thought delight
Thy 6wn true poet-soul,
Great thoughts for thee I’ll sing aright
And epic strains control.
Or, if the wealth of ages hold
But value in thy eyes.
Thy riches shall be manifold
And precious gems thy prize,
And glorious stores of colour, caught
In costly diadem,
Shall be with finer lustre fraught
When you have gazed on them.
But if to passions that consume
But friendship you can dole,
My baser nature I assume
Since you possess my soul;
A woman gave, by fate decreed,
To Khaled soul and throne,
But you reverse the nobler deed,
And rob me of mine own.

Dear Bulletin,— The truth about the
first 'Woman : Adam was told to take Ids pick
from among the animals as they filed past. He
noticed one particularly, by the almost human
intelligence in its face, and at once roped it in,
tamed it, and called it Woman. It has stayed
with his descendants ever since.— Heki.
The law against vagrancy seems to be
morally invalidated—in metropolitan districts
anyway—by the hotel free-lunch system. A Mel-
bourne wharf-lodger was last week sentenced to
twelve months’ imprisonment as one having no
visible means of support, whereas the only evi-
dence against him showed that he did support him-
self efficiently by “scoffing” the free, easy, and
accessible victuals supplied by philanthropic
publicans. Meat, bread, cheese, and tempting
little slabs of mystery are placed on bars and
tables for the benefit of customers, and the gentle-
man aforesaid was the hungriest customer on
record. The fact that he dispensed with liquid
refreshment was scarcely to the point. Perhaps
his medical man had ordered him to drink nothing
but Yarra water. He saw means of support for
which there was no direct charge, and he took ’em.
He had committed no statute crime j he was
plump, cheerful, and contented—doing well, in
fact —yet the Law arrogantly ruled that his real
social condition was invisible, and dropped the
poor joker into durance vile.

“The Last of Six
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST PAVENC3.
With Prefatory Note hy Molf Boldrewood.
of tlie Press s
Opinions
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The
author who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts ’ A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has bv many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He too possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best’work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with forceand vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. The Last of Six l is a terrible
tkle of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr Favenc makes of
thrhlluff interest ‘The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. A Cup of Cold Water is, perhaps, the
best talc in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to .purely Australian literature. -Daily Telegraph,
July 15, 1893.
“ ‘ The Last of Six •’ and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
sketches bv Mr Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15,1893.
