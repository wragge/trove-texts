“the WONDERFUL VISIT.”
We talk glibly about “entertaining angels un-
awares ; ” but how would we entertain them ?
Suppose you were buttonholed at your suburban
gate by a Thing which called itself an angel,
which at any rate so far agreed with conventional
angelic improprieties that it had real wings and
very little drapery, what exactly would you do ?
Would you ask It in to tea and offer it chops?
What would your wife say to It ? What would
the neighbors think? How would It comport
Itself ?
That is what H. G. Wells (the clever author of
“ The Time Machine ”) sets himself to answer in
his new book, “The Wonderful Visit ” (6s. 6d.).
Mr. Wells is a young man of 28, and a very young
writer of 3. He was a tutor till lung-collapse
drove him into literature, to literature’s great
gain. For Mr. Wells has, of all the writers of the
day, the happiest, freshest imagination, and his
scientific training is enabling him to plough quite
untilled acres in the field of fiction. Two other of
his works —“ The Island of Dr. Moreau,” a vivi-
sectionist romance, and “The Stolen Bacillus,” a
volume of short stories —are nearly ready for pub-
lication.
The Angel drops inexplicably into a little
English village. There have been rumors of a
strange bird, and the ornithological vicar seizes
his gun, sallies out, and—puts a charge of swan-
shot into the Angel’s wing!
There was a scream of superhuman agony, the wings
beat the air twice, and the victim came slanting swiftly
downward and struck the ground—a struggling heap of
writhing body, broken wing, and flying blood-stained
plumes—upon the turfy slope behind.
The Vicar stood aghast, with his smoking gun in his
hand. It was no bird at all, but a youth with an ex-
tremely beautiful face, clad in a robe of saffron and with
iridescent wings, across whose pinions great waves of
colour, flushes of purple and crimson, golden green and
intense blue, pursued one another as he writhed in his
agony. Never had the Vicar seen such gorgeous floods of
colour. Not stained-glass windows, not the wings of
butterflies, not even the glories of crystals seen between
prisms, no colours on earth could compare with them.
Twice the Angel raised himself, only to fall over sideways
again. Then the beating of the wings diminished, the
terrified face grew pale, the floods of colour abated, and
suddenly with a sob he lay prone, and the changing hues
of the broken wings faded swiftly into one uniform dull
grey hue.
“Oh ! what has happened to me?” cried the Angel
(for such it was), shuddering violently, hands outstretched
and clutching the ground, and then lying still.
“ Dear me ! ” said the Vicar. “ I had no idea.” He
came forward cautiously. “ Excuse me,” he said, “I am
afraid I have shot you.”
It was the obvious remark.
The wound is bound up, and the Vicar takes the
Angel home. The curate’s wife and daughters are
playing tennis with a friend on the vicarage lawn.
You see, it came on the Curate’s wife suddenly. The
Angel’s face being towards her she saw nothing of the
wings. Only a face of unearthly beauty in a halo of
chestnut hair, and a graceful figure clothed in a saffron
garment that barely reached the knees. The thought of
those knees flashed upon the Vicar at once. He, too, was
horror-struck. So were the two girls and Mrs. Jehoram.
All horror-struck. The Angel stared in astonishment at
the horror-struck group. You see, he had never seen
anyone horror-struck before.
“ Mis-ter Hilly er! ” said the Curate’s wife. “This is
too much!” She stood speechless for a moment. "Oh!"
■ She swept round upon the rigid girls. “ Come ! ” The
Vicar opened and shut his voiceless mouth. The world
hummed and spun about him. There was a whirling of
zephyr skirts, four impassioned faces sweeping towards
the open door of the passage that ran through the
vicarage. He felt that his position went with them.
“Mrs. Mendham,” said the Vicar, stepping- forward,
“Mrs. Mendham, you don’t understand ”
“ Oh /” they all said again.
One, two, three, four skirts vanished in the doorway.
The Vicar staggered half-way across the lawn and
stopped, aghast. “ This comes,” he heard the Curate’s
wife say, out of the depths of the passage, “ of having an
unmanned Vicar -—.” The front door of the vicarage
slammed like a minute-gun. There was silence for a space.
“I might have thought,” he said. “She is always so
hasty.”
The slight misconception as to the Angel’s sex
is set right, and the Vicar’s character cleared to
some extent, but the curate, and the doctor, and
the village positively refuse to accept the Angel,
in spite of his wings. He is for them a lunatic or
an impostor. They dress him in the Vicar’s old
clothes, and day by day the mean and sordid life
of earth depraves his angelic nature. Only the
quaint old Vicar realises how beautiful is the soul-
life of which his awkward visitor gives him
glimpses. From the angelic point of view the
author launches shafts of vigorous satire. The
Angel meets a philosophical Tramp.
“See that chap ploughin’? ” said the Tramp. “Ain’t
it ridiculous ?—centuries and centuries of civilisation, and
look at that poor swine there ; sweatin’ ’isself empty and
trudgin’ up that ’ill-side. ’E’s English, ’e ’is. ’E belongs
to the top race in creation, ’e does. ’E’s one of the rulers
of Indjer. It’s enough io make a nigger laugh. The flag
that’s brayed a thousand years the battle and the breeze
—that’s ’is flag. There never was a country was as great
and glorious as this. Never. And that’s wot it makes of
us.
Day by day for a week the Angel grows sadder,
and wearier, and more out of tune with the ugly
life of earth. And then—and then the end comes.
Let the author tell it. ■
Mr. Wells has made in “ The Wonderful Visit ”
a singularly beautiful and original book. The
thought is strong; the play of wit and fancy
brilliant; the style not elaborate, but graceful and
natural. Nothing better in its way has ever been
accomplished.
Recent Publications.
J. A. Andrews, the mild-mannered anarchist
who was honored in Sydney by Govt, persecution,
is issuing some unsold copies of his “Temple
Mystic and Other Poems ” at the reduced price of
Is. 3d. posted. The verses (which were dedicated
to Victor Daley so far back as 1888) have not
much poetical value, but a good deal of personal
interest—dating, as they do, from a period before
anarchy possessed the. author’s soul.
Scribner’s Magazine for Nov. (Is. 2d.) is a
particularly good number. There is a splendid
poem by H. C. Bunner, editor of Puck, which has
the lilt of Whitman and Whitman’s warm soul.
Some exceptionally fine engravings illustrate the
American festiyal of Thanksgiving Day.
“The Science and Art of Training”(ls. 3d.), by
Henry Hoole, M.D., is one of the very best books
on the subject, and can be warmly recommended
to all classes of athletes. Tlie author (a first-class
authority) recommends in many cases the inges-
tion of a moderate amount of alcohol, which (he
says) “gives tone to the muscles and nerves, and
stimulates both digestion and assimilation, fre-
quently to a wonderful degree.”
Melville, Mullen, and Slade issue “The Mel-
bourne Guide-Book” (Is. 3d.). No better could
be wished for.
Lewis Findlay East is author of “ The Quest of
Love ” and other verses of little strength or
originality (with the exception of “ The Charge of
the Scots Greys ”). Melville, Mullen, and Slade
publish the volume, the printing and binding of
which deserve a special word of praise. It is, by
the way, extremely difficult to get books well
bound in Sydney; but Melb. craftsmen leave no-
thing to be desired.
“ The Boating Man’s Vade-Mecum ” (Is. fid.) is
exceedingly good value, telling everything that is
to be told about the pleasant pastime of yachting - .
NOTES.
The publishers of “The Banjo’s” verses are
sending the stereotype-plates to England for use
in the preparation of a special English edition.
For this and future reprints the following typo-
graphical errors in the first and second Australian
editions are worth noting Pages xv. and 136,
“ aringing ” should be “ a-ringing.” “ Were ”is
printed for “where,” p. xv.; “wont” for “ won’t,”
p. 33; “breach ” for “breech,” p. 131; “ Gentle-
men” for “Gentleman,” p. 180. There is also a
turned “s,” p. 62, 1. 18; and the “Prelude” is
described as “Introductory Verse” on the first
contents page. “The Banjo,” in "his way, is an
Australian classic, and one likes- to have his typo-
graphy brought to classical perfection.
Angus and Robertson’s forthcoming volumes
include Henry Lawson’s poems ; the same writer’s
prose sketches; “The Banjo’s” stories ; a novel by
Lawson, “ The Hero of Redd ay ; ” and poems by
Victor Daley and John Farrell. Lawson’s poems
(ss. 6d.) and “ The, Banjo’s ” stories (price not yet
fixed) are in the press, and subscribers will’be
supplied from this office immediately on issue.
Dent’s handsome series of translations of
Balzac’s novels (edited by Saintsbury) is coming
to hand in monthly volumes (4s. 6d. each). The
volumes already issued are “The Wild Ass’s
Skin ” (one wonders how Mr. Saintsbury came to
prefer this title to “The Piece of Shagreen”),
The Chouans,” “At the Sign of the Cat and
Racket,” and “The Country Doctor.” The
edition is one for which English readers may well
be grateful.
Good English critics are not uncomplimentary
to Francis Kenna. Says the Saturday Review :
“ There is a note of sincerity in those among the
‘Songs of the. Season” which are personal; the
poet has felt something at any rate, the melan-
choly is real; but he does not succeed when he
leaves himself and becomes universal, as in the
villanelle which sets forth what the world needs.”
And The Bookman thinks that “many of the
verses are pleasing in a melancholy fashion, and
all are above the average of minor verse in evi-
dence of culture.”
“Rolf Boldrewood ” has finished a new story,
“The Sealskin Cloak,” which is to be published
serially in one of the English magazines.
Mary Gaunt (Mrs. Miller), daughter of Vic.
County Court Judge Gaunt ; gets a flattering
notice and unflattering portrait in Oct. Bookman.
Her books, “Dave’s Sweetheart,” and “The
Moving Finger,’’are readable.
Gordon and Gotch have opened a branch at
Perth, Westralia, where The Bulletin may be
obtained immediately on arrival of the mail.
The Bulletin Christmas Number will contain
sketches by “Hop,” Percy Spence, Frank
Mahony, B. E. Minns, and other well-known
Bulletin artists. The literary contributors in-
clude, in prose, Louise Mack, Ethel Turner, Alex.
Montgomery, Henry Lawson, Louis Becke, J.
Evison, Ernest Fayenc, and others well-known in
literature; and specially good verse comes from
Arthur Adams, Victor Daley, “Glenrowan,” and
others. Altogether, the number promises to be
an exceedingly good one. By post, 7d.
Traveller: “Charles L. Webster and Co., the
N.Y. publishing house which played ducks and
drakes with Mark Twain’s money, drew probably
the largest single cheque ever paid for literary-
work. This cheque was for $200,000, approxi-
mately <£40,000, drawn to the order of the widow
of Gen. Grant, and was a first instalment only on
account of payment for Grant’s Memoirs, heroi-
cally written by him during his last illness
(cancer), and finished only a few days before
his agonising death. Grant, always taciturn and
reserved, disliked autobiography as much as he
disliked public speaking. The Republic had not
been ungrateful to him, but he had lost his for-
tune through the extraordinary stupidity of his
son and the rascality of that son’s partner, to
w'hom the elder Grant had furnished the capital
to engage in stock-broking.”
The serial rights alone of Hall Caine’s next book
will be worth nearly £3000 to him.
One of Anthony Hope’s new tales, “ Phrozo,”
will first appear in the Idler. It deals with the
lively adventures of an Englishman and a Greek
princess on a Mediterranean island. The other,
“ The Chronicles of Count Antonio,” is a romance
of mediaeval Italy.
“Q.’s ” new volume of short stories, “ Wander-
ing Heath, ” will soon be available. “ Q. ’s ” recent
work has lacked interest and value; and, indeed,
nothing that he has done comes up to the early
“Noughts and Crosses.”
Stanley Weyman’s “ Red Cockade ” will reach
Australia in volume-form about the middle of
January. It has materially brightened To-Day
during its serial run, and is well up to Mr. Wey-
man’s standard.
The first edition (5000) of Louis Becke’s “His
Native Wife ” is nearly exhausted, and a second
edition may be looked fox’. With the consent of
the publisher, Alex. Lindsay, Mr. Becke has sent
the yarn for English sexual publication—px-obably
in the Pall Mall Gazette.
Nov. Cosmos sold out in a few days—partly,
they say, owing to naughty Louise Mack’s roman
(i clef reproducing the chatter of some well-known
Sydney society ladies overheard on the Neutral
Bay ferry-boat.

To Correspondents.— “ Strange Dream ” :
Don’t think Twain’s remark about Harte was a
bad joke : it was merely bad criticism. In July
North American Review Mark similarly slanged
Fenimore Cooper, and he is charged by D. F. Han-
nigan in Oct. Free Review with “ bad temper and
want of the faculty of appreciativeness. ” The com;,
merit is just enough. Anybody, like Mark, can
see the holes in a ladder, but a critic ought to see
the ladder. Mark seems to fear lest other American
reputations may detract from his own V. :
Apropos of what? A.W. : We’ll post you “His
Natural Life ” for 3s., and you can look it up for
yourself...... Scissors : Don’t agree ; S.M. Herald
literary criticisms are generally capable and just.
Anybody can slobber praise ; very few can write
judicious appreciation Jap : Anarchist An-
drews was the writer of ‘ ‘ Invicta Spes a very
decent bit of philosophical verse. (See note re his
published poems On this page).

study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
lias, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep,, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,

Q L I N D S.
The word is suggestive. Many dealers keep their
customers very much in the dark as to the true
state of things. So to speak, they get behind their
own blinds because the circumstances won’t allow
them to emerge into the full light.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE IN CHINA
writes as follows :
I should like to mention certain matters in connection
with the blind trade. With every order I place I INSIST
ON INSPECTION before packing, with the result that
not less than 25 to 30 per cent, are rejected. But I find
this s-ason a firm has placed large oiders, but ABSO-
LUTELY NO INSPECTION takes place, consequently
makers are competing for the orders at lower rates on
these terms.
We take our friends behind the scenes so that
they may see WHAT A TRAGEDY the blind
trade is, and so that they may, when buying blinds,
discriminate between honest dealers and the other
sort. No doubt trie blinds WHICH ARE
SHIPPED WITHOUT INSPECTION are
offered at lower prices than SELECTED BLINDS,
but wise people will prefer giving a trifle more,
should it be necessary, with the certainty of get-
ting BLINDS which offer some show of protec-
tion, and that do not tumble in pieces after a
fortnight’s wear.
BAMBOO BLINDS
made of the outside of skin or the bamboo in
its natural color. SPECIALLY SELECTED.
Fitted with CORDS and pulleys ready to put up.
It may be added that the COKDS are strong and
suitable, and not liable to rot and break on the
least provocation. Sizes from 3ft. wide by 6ft.
deep to 12ft. wide by Bft. deep ; prices, Is. to
ss. 6d. each blind.
CHINESE BLINDS
made of fine split bamboo, painted green on both
sides, and fitted with CORDS and pulleys of
best quality. These blinds are SPECIALLY
SELECTED. Sizes from 3ft. wide by 6ft. deep
to 12ft. wide by 10ft. deep ; prices from Is. Bd. to
7s, 6d. each blind.
BEAD AND REED BLINDS
Charming assortment of colors and styles. These
blinds are available for balls, doorways and win-
dows. They say they frighten the flies away. If
so, they are worth a pound an inch. Prices from
2s. 9d. to 15s.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA,
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.
“All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustrations,

Prof. Baldwin Spencer, of Melb. Univer-

there is no proof of this trick.
Dear Bulletin, —The platypus certainly
lives a long way north of the Tropic of Capricorn.
Years ago they were plentiful in the Barron, just
above the falls, and I believe they can be found
right along the N.Q. coast range. I have seen
them both in the Herbert and Burdekin and their
tributaries, but mostly above the range. On one
occasion I saw one killed in Gowrie Creek, Lower
Herbert district, where alligators are quite plenti-
ful.—O.K., Ravenswood, Oct. 29, ’95.
The recent heartless decision of Melb. City
Court in the case of the Antiope seamen again
exhibits the Bench as a mere formula-driven
machine which only requires two knives and a fly-
wheel to be a chaff-cutter. It is interesting to
learn, by the way, that the Antiope seaman’s
wages were £2 15s. per month—or about Is.
per day, and the incomparable tucker served out
by British “limejuioers.” For Is. Id. per day, |
or about IJd. an hour, these men risk their lives. I
Can shore-sweating and the martyrdom of woman

Miss Balfour, the sister of the Tory-leader
lately made a speech, which had the misfortune to
get into print. Here’s a morsel from the reckless
spinster’s appeal to electioneering-agents: “It
had often been said that the Conservatives were
much less active, both in voting and in canvassing,
than the Radicals. She believed there was a good
deal of truth in that. A person who was already
in a comfortable armchair did not want to get out
of it, but a person who had no armchair was will-
ing to work, especially if he thought he could get
somebody else’s armchair by so doing.” Balfour’s
sister gives a simple definition of a Tory—a
person unwilling to work, because he can take his
ease in the cosy chair which other persons’ labor
provides for him.
Writes a Bulletin correspondent : “ Had
I been told this, instead of having seen it, I
should probably have called the teller a liar.
About half-past one on Thursday, 14th inst., a
carrier’s covered van, with a man and a boy on
the front seat, was being driven rapidly across
the intersection of Bourke and Swanston-streets,
Melbourne. A chestnut horse had bolted with
its rider along Bourke-street, and made straight
for the van. A collision seemed inevitable ; but
to the surprise of about 100 spectators the chest-
nut leaped clear over the hind-quarters of the
carrier’s horse, and arrived on the other side
riderless. Even more surprised were we to see
three people on the seat of the van. The rider
had been knocked off the horse by the van’s pro-
jecting roof on to the van-seat. That might not
occur again in a million tries.”
“ ’TIS ONLY NOBLE TO BE GOOD.”
— Tennyson.
But can we all “ be good ”?—that is the rub.
We look around, and noble him we dub
Who does no sin ; while he who oft-times errs
The “righteous wrath ” of sinless ones incurs.
But is this justice? Do we guilty hold
The penny-piece that is not made of gold ?
Do we chastise with stripes the sheep
That cannot like a racehorse leap?
Then why reproach the man
Who cannot do what others can ?
The strong man must be strong, the weak man
weak,
The haughty haughty, and the meek man meek.
Just as the potter moulds the plastic clay,
So we in shape our architect obey.
Hence, while it may be “ noble to be good,” ’tis
mad
To say ’tis wicked to be bad.

Adopted by DIXSON&SONS.for thelr
HighestGrade.Mild Plug Tobacco
YANKEE DOODLE .
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it lias been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker twin test the statement, foi
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its’sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DTXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford tc
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands:—“CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE'
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1895.
A Stupendous Grab.
A small, unostentatious bill turned up the
other day in New South Wales Assembly,
which purports to give to one John Sulman
(a Sydney architect), or his assigns, jpower
to construct and work a submarine railway
from Sydney to North Shore. It comes in
unobtrusively towards the end of the session,
when the Legislature is very tired and is
wont to rush things through with little con-
sideration, and it appeals strongly to the
Labor element of the Assembly on the ground
that it will furnish a certain amount of em-
ployment—not much, certainly, but a little.
The House has had much experience of
such things in the past, the general rule
being that some speculator got a concession
to build some urgent public work, and then
endeavored to sell it to some other specu-
lator, and, failing in that, simply hung on to
it, doing nothing himself and refusing to let
anyone else do anything unless he was paid
handsomely to stand out. To guard against
this and prove that he is absolutely genuine,
Mr. John Sulman agrees to deposit £3OOO
with the Treasury within six months after
the passing of the Act, and to expend at
least T 30,000 on the work within 18 months.
The goods and parcels rates are to be the
same as those on the New South Wales State
railways, which is sufficiently vague, and the
fares are not to exceed Id. for each section,
the length' of a section being undefined.
John Sulman is also to have the option of
constructing a second tunnel if he sees fit.
Altogether, the scheme is a gentlemanly and
polished grab with all the objectionable
features so carefully kept out of sight that
they may pass comparatively unnoticed.
* * *
Yet, despite the polish, the whole business
is a sinful snatch at one of the most valuable
concessions in New South Wales. The syn-
dicate is to get sole possession of by far the
best site —almost the only possible site, in
fact—for a submarine line across Sydney
Harbor. It will occupy Dawes Point on one
side and Milson’s Point on the other, and
have the shortest crossing and the one
nearest to the business part of the city. On
the North Shore side it will occupy whatever
space is available at Milson’s Point station ;
therefore it shuts down on any possibility of
extending the present Stale line under the
city and the harbor to connect with the
North Shore rail way at that con-
venient point. Some day or other, it
is admitted. by everyone, the State line
must be extended through the city. When
that is done the shortest, cheapest and best
route would be to connect from Redfern via
Dawes Point with North Shore, building
intermediate stations where required. The
new line, instead of the present awkward
and lengthy deviation by Strathfield, Byde
and Carlingford, would then be the great
national railway that connects S.A. with
Queensland. Even now this interprovincial
railroad forms a connection from Oodnadatta
to Charleville, a distance of nearly 3000 miles,
and before very many years have elapsed it
will probably form a direct track from Perth
to the Gulf of Carpentaria. All the syndi-
cate asks, therefore, is that it may own
about miles in the centre and busiest part
of this great railroad, and wait there to be
bought out when it becomes an absolutely
unendurable nuisance.
* * #
The syndicate also wants a monopoly of
the local traffic between Sydney and the now
city which is growing up on the northern side
of the harbor. The State is creating that
new city and making the traffic by the con-
struction of the costly and, so far, un-
profitable line to Hornsby. That State-
created traffic has made the pro-
posed tunnel possible and profitable, and
the syndicate asks that the State line shall
act as a feeder to its little private spec. If
the tunnel were a State undertaking the
trains would go right through to Sydney,
but the intervention of a private line will
perpetuate the present awkward and need-
less break in the journey. When the old
railroad is extended from Redfern into
Sydney proper, then the Government will be
confronted with the following alternatives.
(1) It may let the syndicate's tunnel form
the sole connection between the two cities, in
which case there will be a permanent and
cumbrous break in the direct transcon-
tinental line, and the two State arteries of
traffic will both exist largely to serve as
feeders for the private enterprise. (2) The
State may build its own connection with
North Shore, but in that case it will have to
take a longer and more expensive route, and
the fact that the syndicate has a lien on
the Milson s Point landing-place will pro-
bably make it necessary to shift that
station to some other site in order to
get room to make a connection ; and, in
any case, the private line will take much
of the local traffic to the serious detri-
ment of the public revenue. Or (3) the
State may buy up the private enterprise, to
the great profit of the syndicate ; in other
words, it may buy ba’ck for solid cash the
concession which it now gives for absolutely
nothing. And the State must face one of
these three alternatives in the near future.
* * #
New South Wales has absolutely nothing
to gain by han ing over the North Shore
submarine railway or tramway—whichever
it may be called - to Messrs. John Sulman
and Co. instead of making it a part of the
State railway and tramway system. The
money for the work will no doubt be raised in
England—as the money always is in such
cases—and it will form an addition to the
foreign debt of the province, just as much as
if it was borrowed by the Government. The
receipts will go to England as dividends,
whereas the other way they would go to
England and be called interest ; the name is
different, but the drain on the public
resources is just the same. As regards
cost, the difference is wholly in favor of
State ownership. The State has its twm
termini, at Redfern and MUson’s Point, and
has only to construct the line and the in-
termediate platforms. It has also its work-
ing staff and board of management. The
private co. has to build its termini at both
ends, to supply working staff, directorate,
and rolling-stock, and the interest on the
money thus needlessly expended and the
extra working charges have to be made out
of the country in some shape or other ; also,
the unnecessary capital outlay will have to
be repaid by the country when the line is
taken over, which must happen sooner or
later. The break in the journey at Milson’s
Point will still continue, the only difference
being that the railway passenger will trans-
fer himself to a private car instead of a
private steamer, so that there is very little
gain in convenience as a set-off' against the
loss incurred by handing over to a syndicate
the only good crossing-place on the harbor.
Moreover, even the stipulations about the
deposit and che expenditure of £30,000 in 18
months are no guarantees that Sydney will
get its Uv.m"’Hv after all. The value of the
concession is such that the syndicate may, if it
chooses, simply pay its £3OOO, and expend the
£30,000 on preliminary work, and then lie
low while it endeavors, by the aid of Parlia-
mentary influence, to force the State to buy
it out at a high figure in order to clear the
way for railway extension.
* * #
In such a matter State and private enter-
prise stand on an entirely different footing.
The State builds its railways and tramways
to work them straightforwardly for the
public convenience and the profit of the
Treasury. The private speculator gets his
concession generally that he may sell it at a
good price to a syndicate, and the syndicate
endeavors to transfer it, at a big advance, to
a limited liability co. after grabbing at the
promoters’ shares and judiciously letting a
number of “substantial” people have an
interest so that it may have a solid hold on
political influence for future emergencies.
The next business is generally to borrow
money on debentures for construction pur-
poses. The main object of everybody con-
cerned is to -boom the shares and sell at a
big advance, and to work Parliament for
new concessions, and to manipulate the
share-market, and to pass the thing on to
someone else at an increased price, and to
grab at directorships ; and the public con-
venience doesn’t come in at all except in so
far as it must be studied in order to help
along the interests of the promoters. In
short, the chief end and aim of almost every
big concession is to sell ouc, to the public if
need be ; to the State—which is regarded as
a foolish and gullible institution—-if possible.
* * •
To sum the matter up, Sydney wants to
carry its railway through the city and unite
it with the North Shore branch so as to
make one continuous connection. It wants
to run its passenger service right through
instead of having to transfer from the rail-
way to the bus or tramcar at one end and
to the steamboat at the other, so that the
journey from St. Leonards or Gordon to
stations on the Redfern line can be done in
one continuous act instead of by three in-
stalments. Also, it wants to save the expen-
sive cartage of goods into the city, or their
transference, so far as concerns the Northern
suburbs, by the slow and primitive horse-
punt. And if it gives the proposed con-
cession the passenger journey will still have
to be made by three awkward instalments as at
present, the only difference being that the
submarine tram will come in instead of the
steam ferry. Also, the goods traffic will not
be assisted in any material degree, as the trans-
fer from the private to the public vehicle will
have to be made just as at present. Further,
the business of the North Shore Ferry Co.,
which is at least a local enterprise, will be
ruined to help along a mainly foreign syndi-
cate that will offer very little more conveni-
ence than the Ferry Co. now does. The
extension of the railway system will be
blocked, or else it will be necessary to buy
out the new monopoly at great cost, or
to make an extensive and costly deviation
to avoid its ground, in which case the
private line will compete against it and
eat considerably into the profits, or the
State must let the syndicate own the
busiest section of the biggest State rail-
way in Australia. And further, a great
vested interest will be created which will in-
fluence and crooken the Legislature, as all
such big monopolies do. Moreover, it is
noteworthy that the syndicate scheme was
never heard of until the Railway Depart-
ment seriously recommended the execution
of a similar work by Government, which
lends still more color to the suspicion that it
exists, quite as much for speculative as for
construction purposes. Under all these
circumstances every politician should be
called upon by his constituents to vote
straight and consistently against this stu-
pendous grab.
A Severed Knot!
“ Oxx, the agony ! ” ejaculated unhappy Arthur
Dacre, as he stood bleeding to death by the
corpse of the wife he had sent before him. In
which terribly pregnant laconicism no record of
any anguish but physical appears hitherto to
have been discovered by the general public—-
that smugly insensate public which, having
practically done to death these “ star-crossed
lovers,” has since been solacing itself with the
gory incidentals to its own deed, and has
hustled away—in its vulgar hunger after cheap
sensation—the very mourners from the grave-
side. And to the abject squalidity of soul of
which such things are symbols are unquestion-
ably due the violent and untimely deaths of
the Dacres.

With the genuine artist, his work—graphic,
literary, musical, or histrionic—constitutes,
for him, a second and a major individuality,
to which, in his own eyes, his mere
personality is but a more or less in-
significant adjunct. And the Dacres were
genuine artists to the tips of their fingers. The
virtual professional status of either husband or
wife is beside the question, although in the
former case it was more than respectable, and,
in the latter, little, if at all, below the top of
the tree in the lady’s special line. Amy
Roselle—despite the inevitable physical deca-
dence to which she would never confess, and of
which she was, no doubt, entirely unconscious—
was still a vivid, convincing, and accomplished
actress, to whom, with marvellous effect, would
come at times electrifying flashes of her former
power, and Arthur Dacre—all untouched, per-
haps, of the celestial fire of genius—was never-
theless far enough removed from mediocrity to
be capable of sincere, original, and highly-
finished dramatic work. And the fact that his
histrionic possibilities were not of a higher
order was in no way incompatible with such an
enthusiastic devotion to, and respect for, his
art as would not let him long survive the cir-
cumstance that his wife and himself—a charm-
ing, refined, and intellectual woman, and a
high-bred, chivalrous, and keenly-sensitive man
—had been compelled, as a pis alter, to assist
in providing for the play-going swine the
lamentable hog-wash without which it refuseth
to be comforted.
* * #
It may be that Dacre gave circumstance too
easy a victory, and—if it were not the most
miserable fatuity for anybody, under one set of
psychological conditions, to presume to say
what another person’s conduct should be under
an entirely different set—it might be asserted
that a man with any grit in him would have
“ seen it out ” for the sake, at any rate, of the
“poor little woman” whom he so tenderly
loved, and who, according to his own inex-
pressibly pathetic statement to a friend, had
fought on his behalf such a desperate battle
with disappointment and misfortune. All such
speculation, however, is as hopelessly futile as
is the discussion of the degree to which Dacre
was responsible for his actions at the time of
the double immolation. There is much in the
piercing simplicity of his last epistles to point to
that pseudo-hysterical condition which—simu-
lating in the one sex an affection specially
characteristic of the other—means practically
temporary insanity j and the fact, also, that
Dacre—a man of normally generous and con-
fiding disposition—had latterly become liable,
under pressure of anxiety, to a condition com-
bining suspiciousness with irritability, goes far
to make out a primd facie case for the incipience
in his self-tortured mind of that variety of
mania characterised by what is called persecu-
tory or conspiratory delusion. But the point
as to whether the unfortunate fellow was or
was not specifically insane loses all practical
significance in view of the simple fact that, since
he did what he did, his mental balance must
have been at the time sufficiently disturbed to
allow of his doing it. Agendum est ! is the
most unanswerable of all arguments.
*# • *
Sheer waste of time, also, is it to endeavor to
determine whether or not the devoted wife was
a consenting party to her swift and painless
taking-off. It is hardly less certain that she
was than it is that she would not, in any case,
have long survived the man to whom she was
attached by the very strongest link affection
can forge—the recollection of a long co-partner-
ship in the struggle with evil fortune. “ Love,”
as a generic term, is made to comprehend a
large variety of emotional conditions which
differ, not only in degree, but in kind. Be-
tween such a perfect and beautiful mutual
attachment as that of the Dacres and the
“ love ” which could endure, after the lapse of
a miserable month or two, the substitution of
another partner for the ostentatiously-lamented
dead, there is absolutely nothing in common
but the label.
* *
If some men like Shakespeare’s Third
Richard—are “ born to bite the world,” there
are others who are born to be bitten by it—and
of these was Arthur Dacre. “He killed him-
self,” said a friend of his, “ with imaginary
troubles,” and—setting aside the fact that,
although an apprehension may be ill-founded,
it cannot possibly be in itself “ imaginary ”
the utterance furnishes the key-note to the
hopeless inability of a mutton-headed public to
comprehend that what doesn’t wring its withers,
or disturb its liver, or cost it a night’s sleep—-
to say nothing of driving it to apply a razor to
its fat, complacent throat—may inflict any or
all of these undesirable exercitations upon the
more highly-strung organism which serves, here
and there, to lighten up somewhat the leaden
density of the prevailing human dough. “An
additional source of annoyance” to the Dacres,
serenely observes a well-known entrepreneur,
“ would be the necessity of appearing in new
pieces which they could not care about.” Not
care about ! The heart-sick loathing with
which a delicately-apprehensive pair like the
Dacres would find themselves mouthing the
ignominious fustian of the “ piece ” which prac-
tically finished them, can, perhaps, best be
estimated by those whose evil hap it is to be
professionally constrained to sit out the long
farrago of turgid balderdash—artistically con-
temptible, and intellectually not even worth con-
tempt —which, too often, nowadays, superscribes
itself a “drama,” and which, miserabile dicta,
is tolerably certain to replenish that managerial
cash-box which has returned but empty echoes
to the lofty voices of the immortals.
• • *
But, what is, is ! —and a state of things for
which there is at present no perceivable remedy
is only worth referring to because, but for its
existence, the gifted and kindly Dacres would
probably not be to-day “twin-tombed beside
an alien sea.” Disgust with a degraded public
taste—a weariness of the artistic spirit, more or
less chronic with every discriminative intel-
ligence—appears to have reached, in this
instance, a violently acute development, and to
have focussed itself with overpowering and
disastrous effect upon the mind of a man who—
though, perhaps, personally and artistically
super-sensitive—lacked, nevertheless, that use-
ful husk of mechanical conceit which has pre-
served, under much more desperate conditions,
the hopefulness—and, by consequence, the life—
of many an inferior man to Arthur Dacre.
* * *
The segregatory element which lies at the
root of the domestic sentiment has many a time,
ere now, found its extreme development in the
compact by which husband and wife have
“doomed their own hearts to undivided dust,”
but never before, perhaps, has the soul of any
community been stirred by such a singular
and harrowing combination of the idyllic with
the tragic as appears in the beautiful and terri-
ble story of the Dacres. The callow theological
prig may glibly relegate them to the “zealots’
ready hell,” and the helots of a hide-bound
ecclesiasticism may parade, once more, the
grotesque imbecility about “consecrated
ground,” but only a sordid soul or a purblind
intelligence will have room for any feeling but
a profound and enduring pity for the pair who
have elected thus, hand in hand, to cross
——the mystic line
That parts a life whose joys and wosa
Themselves are Heavens and Hells
From what, beyond—no mortal knows—
And no immortal tells!

PLAIN ENGLTSH.
Fat Man in Racing Clubs.
Now that Arthur Anderson, the V.A.T.C.
steward, has remembered the truth about an
episode in his turf career, and apologised to
“J. B. Clark,” it is interesting to .look back
and observe the good old Tory method of deal-
ing with truth-tellers at public meetings, when
they happen to reflect upon any influential
person s character. This is what happened at


the V.A.T.C. meeting two months ago. In the
course of a warm discussion, “J. B. Clark”
accused the chairman of having sat, as a judge,
upon a racing appeal case in which he was
financially interested. Arthur Anderson was
that chairman. In the natural course of such
things he arose, with indignation in his eye, and
called “ J. B. Clark ” a liar. Also, the more
highly-respectable section of the meeting cried
“Shame!” upon the wicked imputator, in
exactly the same tone of voice as was adopted
by the friends of Smellbourne’s busted bank
directors in the early days of “ revelations,”
when facts were only beginning to assert them-
selves, and the bluffers had not yet thrown up
the sponge. “ J. B. Clark’s ” allegation was
scandalous, outrageous, disgraceful, infamous —
anything that these highly-respectable gentle-
men liked to call it. Frank Madden moved a
characteristic resolution to the effect that the
club didn’t believe “ J. B. Clark’s ” monstrous
statement, and James Grice (part-owner of
Hova) seconded it, and the brazen bit of
stupidity was declared carried by a respectable
law’norder majority. “ J. B. Clark ” had said
something nasty concerning a director of the
company, so to speak, therefore he was howled
to scorn, and recorded as a libellous liar upon
the minutes of the meeting. Had it been
possible for the great Spirit of Respectability
to strike the offender dead before he could
prove his charge, he would have given the
Spirit no further trouble. The “Lardy-Dardy
scandal ” would have been buried with his dis-
credited corpse. But “ Clark ’’-Bowden lived
to gather corroborative evidence, and enjoy the
graceful backing-down of Mr. Anderson. Here
is Mr. Anderson’s recantation: “I sat at
Moonee Valley, on the 23rd Nov., ’9l, as chair-
man of stewards when the Lord John and
Lardy-Dardy case was dealt with. Four other
stewards were present, and, as all were
unanimous in allowing the protest, no necessity
for my vote arose, and I did not vote. I appeared
shortly afterwards in my representative capacity
with another Moonee Valley steward, by in-
vitation, before the V.R.C. committee on appeal,
and stated that I had backed Lord John and
had not voted on the protest. The appeal was
dismissed. I had forsotten the circumstances
of this case when Mr. Bowden suddenly brought
the matter up in a manner that seemed to im-
pute dishonest motives to me. I am exceedingly
sorry that in the heat of the moment I made an
accusation of falsehood against Mr. Bowden,
and will do all that lies in my power to have
the motion that the meeting disbelieved his
statement expunged.” Fortunately Mr. Ander-
son can’t expunge the moral lesson of this
Lardy-Dardy rumpus, which was not, as now
appears, so much an ‘sporting scandal as
a modern official outrage. Anderson’s share
in the business is less worth bearing in mind
than the precious resolution fathered by Frank
Madden and seconded by James Grice. Some-
body “ seems to impute dishonest motives ” to
the chairman of a public meeting, who gives
his accuser the lie direct. Whereupon Fat
Man expresses his solemn, dunder-headed dis-
approval of all aspersions on the powers that
be by deciding, off-hand, without enquiry, that
the other fellow’s statement is necessarily
false and malicious.
The Gunuedah Romance.
The recent developments in the Gunnedah
(N.S.W.) alleged poisoning-case are a whole
essay on the unreliability of the female witness.
The heroine of the romance, Ethel Wright, a
guileless child of nature, aged 17, swore that
one morning at 4 o’clock she saw' a neighbor
named Roberts putting strychnine in the
family flour-bin. Finding himself discovered,
he pointed a gun at her, threatened to blind
her with vitriol, and poured a quantity of it over
her, thereby burning large holes in her night-
dress and slightly injuring her shoulder, and
otherwise conducted himself like the villain of
the six-act melodrama. The story came to
grief chiefly through want of attention to
detail. The strychnine was identified as some
that had been sold, not to Roberts, but to the
girl’s aged and pious uncle. There were no
tracks to show where Roberts had invaded the
premises. The night-dress had apparently been
just taken out of a drawer and not worn,
whereas the gentle Ethel swore she had it on
at the time of the trouble. Also, the small
burn on her shoulder was not at all com-
mensurate with the large amount of • vitriol
which had been poured over the garment.
Owing to this want of finish Roberts wasn’t
hanged amid the execrations of an infuriated
populace, and when the story showed definite
signs of breaking down Miss Wright confessed
that it was all pure invention, and had been
made up by the pious uncle aforesaid, and re-
peated by her under that relative’s compulsion.
Thereupon she and the uncle were both
arrested. A little later, she further confessed
that the uncle hadn’t invented the story, nor
incited her to tell it, nor been in any way con-
nected with it; the whole affair was her
own romance from first to last. Then the
dazed old man was turned loose, and the girl
remains in gaol awaiting further developments
and revelations. So far as appears, up to date,
she had no personal grudge against the man
whom she accused, nor against her uncle ; the
narrative seems to have been got up in a per-
fectly casual fashion, possibly through
hysteria, or a cracked brain, or much read-
ing about the duke in the London Journal,
or a desire to brighten up her dreary
life on a backblocks selection with a little
romance, or something of the sort. Even
her recantations don’t count for any more
than her original statements, except where
they are supported by independent evidence.
A wildly irresponsible female may swear to
anything, or confess anything. The hysterical
girl is an imitative person, and if one of the
tribe takes it into her head some day to give
herself into custody for an imaginary and pic-
turesque crime, others will almost certainly
follow suit, and then a new trouble will be
added to those that already harass policeman
O’Hara, of the backblocks. If some one would
tour the country districts—especially the more
lonesome agricultural regions—with a drama in
which the beautiful heroine, for some roman tic-
reason or other, gives herself in custody on a
false charge of the most gory character, he
might produce highly interesting results. Bub
this motive hasn’t been used yet —at least, not
much used. In the average drama and tale the
heroine is always falsely accused, or otherwise
harassed by the machinations of some pic-
turesque ruffian or other, and the local girl,
who wants some more romance in her life than
is afforded by a heavy Wesleyan uncle and a
cow, goes and does likewise. If the picturesque
ruffian isn’t at hand she constructs him, in her
own crude fashion, out of some dull, common-
place selector or swagman, who is generally
utterly unfitted for the part, and might as well
be asked to play Macbeth at a minute’s notice.
Then the romance naturally goes wrong, but it
is a relief from the monotony of the pious uncle
and the cow while it lasts. The grievous, dull-
brown, arid sameness of the old man and the
cow have probably more to do with such out-
breaks as "that of Miss Wright than is com-
monly imagined.
Melb. University.—A Justification.
Dear Bulletin, —In your issue of Nov. 16,
your correspondent “ Fluffy ” makes an attack
on Melbourne University, with small founda-
tion in fact, and with many absolute mis-state-
ments. (1) “ What does the University do for
its Government-grant of £12,250 ? ” It sup-
plies teaching, examinations, and degrees to
over 600 students per annum, whose fees and
living expenses would otherwise go out of the
province ; it examines annually at the matricu-
lation examinations 1400 boys and girls; it
provides Victoria with its solicitors, barristers,
doctors, civil engineers, and is beginning to
supply it with first-class musicians, assayers,
metallurgists, geologists, and commercial
chemists ; by its teaching, examinations, and
guidance it “ promotes sound learning” through-
out the province, and sets and maintains the
standard of general education. (2) “It imports
a large and expensive staff.” (a) Of the teach-
ing staff of 37, only 10 were specially imported;
applications are always advertised for through-
out the provinces as well as in London, and the
best-qualified candidates are appointed. None
of the skilled assistants or clerical staff were
imported, (b) The staff is large, because 123
subjects are taught and 150 subjects examined
in. (cj The staff' is expensive because, to get
the best men and enable them to do their best
work, the salaries must be such as to make
them practically independent. The salaries!
are lower than those of the best full-time
professors in the United Kingdom; lower
than those of Supreme Court Judges,
heads of civil departments, cabinet ministers,
heads of big public schools, government
experts, and the like ; much less than the in-
comes of solicitors, barristers, bankers, brokers,
doctors, &c., in the first flight. The salaries of
the part-time teachers are lower than in Great
Britain. (3) “ The University is a mere train-
ing-ground for several professions—law, theo-
logy, medicine, school-teaching, and so forth.”
The University is absolutely debarred by its
charter from teaching, examining or giving
degrees in theology ; pedagogics it does not
teach. Theology is taught by denominational
halls outside of and wholly unconnected with
the University ; pedagogics are taught to
would-be school-teachers by special officers of
the Education Department unconnected with
the University. In addition to being a train-
ing-ground for the professions of medicine, law,
engineering and music, the University provides
all-comers with a liberal education and sound
learning in its arts and science courses. (4)
“ The professors only lecture when they please,
and habitually stay away without notice.” Not
one per cent, of lectures are omitted ; in-
tended omission is always notified in the
morning papers, on notice - boards and
lecture-room doors, and, in the medical
course, also at Melbourne Hospital. (5) “ At
lecture-time, four anajmic students appear and
wait.” Extremely few classes are below 20;
most are from 30 to 60 strong ; some number as
high as 120 members. Under-graduate anaemia
is a matter between students and their phy-
sicians, no concern of the University as such.
(6) “One professor recently repudiated his lec-
tures for a week, without notice—a typical
case.” In that week his wife died and was
buried, therefore the case was not typical; due
notice was given. (7) As to day lectures. It
takes nine hours a day to deliver the present
instruction, therefore shifting it into the night
is impossible, unless night is to be turned to
day and lectures given, say, from 7 p.m.
to 4 a.m. Further, practical scientific work,
dissections, and, above all, hospital work,
can be done only inconveniently and either
badly or not at all at night. At all universities
teaching is done by day. Evening lectures,
where given, are but few, and then given by a
special staff. Again, when, five years ago, an
agitation arose for evening lectures,-the Univer-
sity offered to supply them, if the demand were
sufficient. Only some three dozen applied, and
they wanted over two dozen subjects lectured
on. The University naturally, and with good
warrant, declined. (8) “The door should be
open to the clever youth of the whole com-
munity, not reserved for gilded youth.” The
door is so open. The State awards exhibitions
annually to the best State school pupils. The
University colleges offer 12 £SO and eight £25
scholarships, and 12 £lO exhibitions. The
University chest gives prizes, exhibitions and
scholarships in cash worth £1526. Special
endowments provide cash scholarships worth
£4BOO. That is, over £7246 is given annually
in cash prizes, which are open alike to the
clever navvy’s son and to the son of gilt Toorak
or Boomville. “ Fluffy ” should be sure of his
ground before loosing the vials of his talk;
above all, he should be just and avoid warrant-
less vituperation.—J.S.R.
—.
The State as an Importer.
For 20 years past Victoria has regularly had a
large surplus of grain for export, varying from
about £50,000 worth to the value of about
£1,750,000, and during the last 15 years the
smallest balance of exports over imports in
this line has been £250,000. In the drought-
season of 1895-96, however, the province is
confronted by the possibility of a new experi-
ence. The failure of the crops has been very
extensive; there may be a small balance for
export, or the supply may not even quite equal
local requirements—at present no one can say
for certain. Under its protective system Vic-
toria, despite its very small area, has come to
be the largest grower of wheat, oats, barley,
potatoes, wine, and many other products in
Australia; still even this cannot guarantee
that, in the worst drought year, it will grow
enough for its own population. The four or
five Foreign-traders in Vic. Assembly already
propose to use this exceptional state of things
as an argument in favor of their importing policy.
If Victoria has a shortage in this one year it must
import; if it is compelled to import the protective
duties will make the prices of the imported
grain needlessly high, there being insufficient
local competition. The only remedy for this,
according to the Freetrade argument, is to
abolish the duties permanently and to wreck
the great Vic. agricultural industry for good,
because of one season’s casual scarcity. And if
the worst should happen, and the local supplies
be actually insufficient, a good many people,
with the usual illogical tendency to run to
extremes, will probably accept this view. Yet
there is a very simple and effective middle
course which would fully meet the emergency,
if the said emergency should come to pass.
Let the protective duties, which have served
Victoria so well in the past, be maintained.
But, as a provision against that possible year
of scarcity which may arrive once in a genera-
tion or two until an efficient irrigation system
is established, it should be enacted that, when
the local supply is unequal to the demand —the
latter being estimated at the average of the
previous two or three years —the Agricultural
Department should be authorised to import,
duty free, enough grain to fully supply the defi-
ciency, and should sell it in small lots at current
prices. Unless the scarcity was world-wide it
would realise a handsome profit on the deal, and
it is only in accord with democratic principles
that this profit, made out of the necessities of
the people, should go into the people’s Treasury,
instead of going into the hands of private specu-
lators, as it would do if the duties were sus-
pended to meet the difficulty. The case may
be summed up in four propositions : (1) Victoria
has come so near to actual scarcity, if it has not
actually arrived there, through the present
drought, that it is quite evident it may get
there very badly some other year when the
population is larger and the drought equally
bad or worse ; (2) Protection alone doesn’t
meet the difficulty, for Customs duties don’t
provide for droughts; (3) Freetrade doesn’t
meet it any better—all it can do is to destroy
the local agricultural industry in good years,
and then a time would come, sooner or later,
when there was a sudden scarcity in the outer
world, and the province, with no large local
supplies to rely upon, would suffer from famine
prices ; (4) therefore, what is wanted is Protec-
tion at all ordinary times and in famine years,
if they come, just as much Freetrade as the
temporary necessity demands. But when,
through some unavoidable disaster, it is neces-
sary to supplement local supplies the State
should be the only importer, so that any money
that is made out of the necessities of the
people shall be the people’s property.
Thrown Away.
The troubles of the Homeward Bound Mining
Co. of Yalwal (N.S.W.) serve to illustrate, for
the benefit of Australasia in general, one of the
remarkable features of a very much mixed legal
system. This co. bought its lease from the
previous holder for .£19,000 and expended
£46,000 in machinery and working expenses.
It paid its rent to the Treasury regularly for a
time, and then by a luckless oversight on
the part of its Sydney agent the payments
were allowed to fall into arrears. The conse-
quence was that the lease was cancelled. So
far there was nothing in the legal system that
could reasonably be objected to. The holder
of a mining lease who fails to pay his rent or
fulfil the other conditions of his tenure does so
entirely at inis own risk ; if he doesn’t do his
duty, or see that his deputy does it, he must
take the consequences. But at this point the
wholly ridiculous feature of the case comes in.
The Homeward Bound mine reverted to the
State. It was a valuable property, and with
the shafts, drives and other works that
were necessarily forfeited along with it
would probably have realised £12,000 or
so cash at auction. There was a very
large battery on the ground, and as this heavy
article would hardly pay the cost of taking
down, removal and re-erection, the new lease-
holder would almost certainly be able to get it
at a mere fraction of its cost, which further
enhanced the value of the claim. Yet there is
no provision in the N.S.W. mining laws
whereby the State could sell this important asset
so as to realise anything like its worth. When
theforfeiture was gazetted the-ground wassimply
thrown open to be scrambled for by the first
comers, just as if it had been a piece of bare
ground in the wilderness whose value was
wholly problematical and might be nil. The
scramble, of course, came off, and, as- is usual
in such cases, was followed by long and expen-
sive litigation, and the State, in addition to
giving away .£12,000 worth of property, paid a
considerable amount in judicial salaries over
the matter. This sort of thing seems eminently
ridiculous. When the State forfeits a lot of
smuggled jewellery it sells the goods for the
best price obtainable, but if the Customs were
run on the same principle as the Mines
Department it would dump the whole lot down
in the middle of the street to be scrambled for
by all comers. As it doesn’t follow this course,
it would seem that the Customs knows how to
come in out of the rain, and the Mines doesn’t.
A Triumph, of Noodledom.
Pitt Town Co-operative Settlement is dead :
who would not weep for Pitt Town ? Pitt
Town Settlement was born a little more than
two years ago, with the prayers of every
benevolent noodle in New South Wales. Dur-
ing those two years, about 100 men, 100 women,
and 200 children have fed on the bounty of the
charitable New South Wales taxpayer. They
have received a subsidy of £7705 in solid cash,
and have earned and spent another £IOOO in
addition —total £8705. They have been sup-
plied with a large tract of land of excellent
agricultural quality in some parts, in others
covered with saleable timber; with a .£220
sawmill, horses, cattle, carts, drays, and imple-
ments ; with a school, a library, and, at any rate,
half a church ; and with oceans of good advice.
There was every requisite for “a beautiful Arca-
dian existence.” Thewolf was keptfromthedoor
by Govt, rations : there was nothing to do but
go ahead and prosper. Philanthropic gentle-
men blessed the settlers; M’sP. wagged formid-
able jaws at them ; in their honor was held a
magic-lantern shivoo at Sydney Town Hall,
when a reverend orator waxed ecstatic over a
display of the settlement’s agricultural pro-
duce ; pointed triumphantly to mammoth twin
pumpkins (himself the rarest pumpkin of the
three); and explained that the New Era was
arriving, Universal Brotherhood was coming
real slick, and Pitt Town Settlement was the
first instalment. And now, of all these glories,
what remains? The sawmill (more or less
busted by Arcadian arts), the horses
and cattle and carts, the fencing, and
eight dozen Arcadian cottages fast going to

There still remain a few families gaining a
miserable living by clearing off the firewood,
thus taking the best remnant of value out of
the property ; but it is only a matter of days
before they, too, give up their ghost of a
struggle, and the New Era of Universal
Brotherhood goes once more to limbo. But
the noodles are nob disheartened. Prodigal
of plans, singularly economical of their own
cash, they only want the charitable
taxpayer to advance a few more thousands, and
they are confident they can galvanise the
corpse. Your true noodle never learns from ex-
perience. He never sees that direct Govt, aid
demoralises most men, and that the greater the
aid the greater the demoralisation. He never
sees that, in every community of co-operators,
everybody wants the other fellow to take the
heavy end of the log, and that reliance on the
other fellow weakens the muscles, slackens the
joints, saps the energy, and ruins the character
even of the originally deserving. The Bulletin,
after long years of observation, rises to affirm
that the noodle is incorrigible.
The Vic. Factories Bill provides for the stamp-
ing of all Chinese-made furniture, any person
removing the stamp to be liable to a £5
penalty. Murray Smith and his little Free-
trade following fought desperately against this
last clause, on the ground that when a person
bought an article he had a right to do as he
liked with it, and any enactment to the con-
trary would be “an interference with the
liberty of the subject.” As the person who
bought the article would be, in most cases, the
dealer who intended selling it over again,
this plea for liberty involved, of course,
liberty to sell it as the product of white
labor, so the Assembly sat heavily on
Chinaman Smith and his amendment'. Another
interference with the liberty of the subject was
added in the shape of a clause providing that
no person employed in a factory or workroom
is to receive less than 2s. 6d. a week. This is
meant to knock out the “improver” swindle.
Some large millinery and other workrooms are
now run almost wholly by “ improvers ” who
receive no wages for the first year, when they
are supposed bo be learning the business, but
are promised good pay in their second year.
When that time arrives, however, they are run
out, and other “improvers” take their places
on the same conditions. The Council, how-
ever, is strong on the “ liberty of the subject,”
and will probably make trouble over some of
these reforms when the Factories Bill comes
within its reach.
Barrister Knox, M.L.A., argues that legal
amalgamation will simply lead to partner :
ships between lawyers who now practise in
separate branches. This arrangement would
be infinitely preferable to the present one.
Every term, the Supreme Court has to deal
with a few of its officers (mostly practising by
themselves) for downright thievery, which
would ensure an unprivileged rogue anything
up to 14 years’gaol. Partnerships (there being
safety in numbers) would obviously avert this
to some extent —unless Mr. Knox makes the
unlawyerlike admission that every lawyer is a
scoundrel addicted to conspiracies of the ugliest
kind. Willis, M.P., touches the real key-
note of reform in his clause to prevent legal
gentlemen from absorbing fees without even
pretending to earn them. Some time ago, a
popular “big” favorite appeared before the
Supreme Court, in a certain suit. Junior
counsel had nob arrived when the case was
called. “ Would y’honah allow this matter to
stand over for a few minutes ? ” asked the
Q.C.; “Mr.- isn’t here yet.” “Can’t
you go on without him?” “I didn’t get the
brief until this morning, y’honah, and I only
partially know the facts.” “’m. Is the
ejectment by a mortgagor?” “Well—er—
y’honah, I can’t remember. Er—you see, I’ve
so much to attend to.” Mr. Willis’s amend-
ment, if it becomes law, will do much to limit
this privileged pilfering, which has almost
vanished in neighboring provinces as an imme-
diate outcome of legal amalgamation.
The Melb. General Assembly, a pathetic set of
local parsons, is to consider whether raffling at
bazaars is a wicked thing, but in its sanctified
stupidity it leaves alone the question whether
bazaars may not be a more holy fraud than
raffles. In a raffle, no matter how much behind
is the parson’s salary, it is generally possible to
get something more valuable than the amount
risked, but an ordinary bazaar-sale is ordinary
swindling—except when it is sweating. The
sallow virgin of 47, who offers a smoking-
cap and a pair of braces for ten shillings
each, knows perfectly well that the lot is
not worth ninepence, but the more she gets
the larger and more monkey-like will be her
pastor’s smile. These priests make their temple
a den of thieves as in the olden time, they con-
secrate trade immorality for the sake of their
fetish, and it is small additional wrong if they
add a raffle and a race-game to the other detrac-

The Vic. Sinking'-Fund.
The Victorian Government, at the last moment,
inserted a clause in the Malice Bill providing
that, after Ist July, 1896, all revenue from
mallee lands shall be set aside to form a fund
for the reduction of the public debt. If the
House of 48 Rich Landlords does not interfere
with this wise arrangement, it will form an
interesting experiment. In the first place, it
is a recognition by Victoria that being hope-
lessly in pawn to the British money-lender
should not be the permanent and recognised
condition of the country. Further, it implies
that under the Turner regime, at all events,
Victoria is done with the foreign-borrowing
curse, for (except in Maoriland) it is recognised
as a futile and absurd expedient to pay off old
debts with one hand while contracting new
ones with the other. The mallee country
yields a present revenue of .£16,000 a year,
which will probably increase to somewhere
between £50,000 and £lOO,OOO in a few years
under the new Act-the House of 48 Rich
Landlords permitting. The Turner Govt, also
hopes to be able, later on, to set aside the whole
land revenue of the province for debt-redemp-
tion purposes, but that is an affair of the
future. Assuming that the amount set apart
reaches £lOO,OOO a year, it will be sufficient at
simple interest to extinguish the present Vic.
public debt in about 450 years, so, though the
present small beginning is much better than
nothing, it is only a small beginning at the
best. If allowed to accumulate at compound
interest the process would be more rapid, but
Premier Turner evidently recognises the fact
that sooner or later an impecunious Govern-
ment would annex the fund for current revenue,
so his scheme provides that as each loan falls
due as much of it shall be paid off as the cash
in hand will admit, and the balance renewed as
usual. The impossibility of tying up a Govern-
ment so that it can’t get at the sinking-fund
has been fully evidenced in Maoriland, there-
fore the wisdom of Turner’s proposal is suffi-
ciently evident. If he succeeds in making a
steady reduction, however small, in the public
debt of Victoria, it will be the first definite
step in the right direction achieved by any Aus-
tralasian province since the borrowing disease
first began, and the fact that he has taken this
step so disastrous a period of the
province s finances says a lot for his courage and
his resolve to get back to the paths of national
honesty. The resolutions which every Govern-
ment which desires to see Australia free from a
degrading servitude to the British pawnbroker
needs to paste in its joint and several hat are
these four : (1) There should be no new loans
floated except for defence purnoses in case of
actual war ; (2) the revenue should be charged
every year with a certain sum, say a-quarter or
half a million, to allow of the construction of
new public works, in addition to keeping the
old ones in repair, whether the money has to
be raised by retrenchment, by new taxation,
by drink and tobacco monopolies, by State lot-
teries, or any other means. The first duty
of the State is to be solvent, even if in
being so it can t afford to be moral accord-
ing to the W.C.T.U. standard; (3) The
proceeds of some specified source of revenue,
even if it is a small one, should be set aside
to reduce the debts already existing; and
(4) as each loan falls due it should be renewed,
if possible, in the local market, so as to make
the remaining debt a local instead of a foreign
liability. The Government that puts these four
axioms in the forefront of its policy will be the
first honest one which this country has seen for
very many years. Meanwhile, the Turner
Government’s adherence to axiom 3, and the
fact that, so far, it has acted up to No. 1 and
has shown some signs of a leaning towards
No. 4, are points much in its favor.
Supplementing the S.M. Herald and other
newspaper “ suicide ” articles, prompted by
recent tragedies, the fact may be recalled that
a suicide State once really existed. Massilia,
which corresponds loosely with what is now Mar-
seilles, when under Greek government, conferred
on its subjects the nght to destroy themselves
for approved reasons. When, for instance, a
man like Lacre considered himself insufficiently
appreciated he was instructed to state his case
to what might be called the Governor in Council,
and, if that body judged his impeachment of
society to be well-founded, a decree was written
out and signed, empowering him to make away
with himself and forbidding the community to
attach any odious consequence to the act. In
many cases the governing body refused its
sanction, and then, if the desperate individual
took his life, public odium was free to follow
him and his. Sir Thomas More, in his
“ Ut°pi a ,” similarly provides for a certain class
of unfortunates. The philosophical theory is
that the individual’s life is the property of the
society of which he is a member, and that if he
and the society agree to extinguish it the act
is as valid as any other that can be sanctioned.
M° re confined the right to self-destruction,
under State sanction, to persons afflicted with
unendurable physical diseases, but did he see
with the eyes of to-day he would certainly have
included the ills of mind.
The Wild-Cat Column.
In the continued absence of any satisfactory
explanation from M.L. Govt, it now seems almost certain
that Treas. Ward has seized the sinking-funds of local
bodies which are really trust-moneys, as well as the
national sinking-fund to which he has a claim by law to
square his budget this year. In that case, Maoriland is
now using borrowed money for revenue purposes, which
is even worse than the old Vogel policy of using it for
P' l . I '. works. Maoriland has an enormous war-debt, in
addition to its public works debt, and with this extra
handicap it seems that the province can’t keep straight
or else it doesn’t try hard enough. Moreover, it is loaded
down with snuffle as well as with war-debts. In a reason-
«ii u B 'c u comm,, nity the hard-driven Treasurer mhdit
nil the financial gap by running a Tattersall’s consulta-
tion business as a State monopoly, or by establishing
btate drink, tobacco and opium monopolies, or by levying
taxes on other forms of vice, but the great national
snume forbids. In a truly pious country the Government
may square its accounts by sneaking the trust funds and
afterwards denying the fact, and the public conscience
doesn t object much; but if it proposed to raise money
out of some public vice which wouldn’t thereby be made
one fraction worse than it was before, the great national
hypocrisy would fall on it like an avalanche. The really
tngh-toned public conscience doesn’t much mind a little
mild dishonesty, or even lying, but it is an awful whale
on morality.’

The Colonial Mutual Tire Insurance Co fno
relation of the life office of the same name) publishes an

It is now about two years since the private
note-issues were abolished in Queensland, and according
to the latest returns four banka have still £7443 of note*
in circulation in that province. It is two years since the
Bank of North Queensland ceased to issue notes in
N.S.W.: it had only one branch, and a very small and not
long-established local circulation, yet £62 of its paper-
money is reported still to be afloat. Of the temporary
N.S. W. Treasury notes, long since withdrawn,
£260 worth have not yet been presented for payment. A
good part of these amounts probably represent absolute
losses. No one is ever likely to know exactly wbat the
banks make through the disappearance of their notes by
means of bush-fires, burning houses, drunken bushmen
who use them for pipe lights, men who vanish in the
bush and are eaten by wild dogs, sunken ships, casual
crownings, floods, rats, mice, and miscellam ous forms of
destruction, but paper-money can be destroyed in so
many ways that the amount must be considerable. One
of the small side-issues of the State currency ques-
tion is that, when all notes are issued by the State, the
public Treasury will get whatever benefit is to be ob-
tained from this source of revenue.

„ According to the report of the National Wool
Co. it is estimated that Australia pays £700,000 a year for
tile warehousing of its wool in London and commission
on wool-sales. A good part of the clip—rather more than
one-sixth-was auctioned last year in Australia, and
fetched, on the whole, rather better than London prices.
If Australia can contrive by-and-bye to become indepen-
dent of the London market, these two almost unnoticed
items of warehousing and commission will mean a lot of
money retained in this suffering country.

F. ; “B. Liste ” points a very proper moral
about a badly-managed State Bank. Vic. and S.A. seem
likely to try the banking experiment soon, and even the
alleged failure of the railways doesn’t seem to frighten
the two provinces much. Is it not true that a badly-
managed State concern may be better than the best-
managed private concern ? If the Vic. railways had been
privately managed, the country railways in poor districts
would be either non est or gone bung at the present time
V 1 c that pay would be run on the plan
of the big combines in the States, where, in some cities,
extortionate fares and freights are wrung out of the
public. News of a trust, comprising 10 big companies,
has just been cabled. Moreover, the employes would be
as the tramway employes are now—sweated to the last
degree.
I® fch® case of banks, private management re-
sulted in the biggest crash and dislocation of business and
credit that any country has ever seen in recent years.
It involved £150,000,000 of capital and deposits in
one year—it involved every man, woman and child in Aus-
tralia. Furthermore, the astute financiers so muddled
things that the crisis is still with us, doddering along
from reconstruction to reconstruction. The deplorable
V[ic. Savings Banks, run by unpaid commissioners, did
-tts bit of harm, but not proportionately to the private
failures, and the State guarantee staved off the woes of
repudiation. When the State awakes to the bad manage-
ment of one of its departments it can take time for altera-
tions and repairs—a private concern must ‘simply’
suspend operations. But there is no need for the State
Bank to be badly-managed. There are, perhaps, five
capable financiers in the world who would be open to
accept office at £lO,OOO a year. As the required manager
would be worth £lOO,OOO a year, Vic. would make a clear
saving of £90,000 by paying him £lO,OOO. If the affair
were made inter-provincial, with interprovincial notes and
interprovmcial investments, there would be no limit to
the possibilities of its success.”

Miner's pluck—and carelessness. Martin,
working an old claim near the Day Dream, lit a fuse at
the bottom of the shaft, and got on to the rope to be
hauled up. Then, having got a few feet up, he suddenly
remembered that he had left an open canister of powder
at the bottom. Before he could signal there was an ex-
plosion, and he was horribly burnt about the arms and
shoulders. Yet he hung on to the rope, was drawn to the
top, and then walked into Broken Hill, 12 miles. Sad to
relate, he died three days after.

The Broken Hill North Central has been re-
vived under circumstances that seem to need explanation.
Nothing has been done at the “ mine ” for many months *
it has been practically abandoned. Calls were made but
remained unpaid. Then the Central was sold for three
times as much as the aggiegate value of its shares when
the offer was first talked about, and there was a rapid
upward movement all round in Broken Hill shares. The
North Central, having some debts, was advertised for sale
by auction. On the day when the sale was to take place
it was announced that the calls had been paid on enough
shares to wipe off the debt, and that the sale would no t
take place after all. In making this announcement th
secretary remarked upon the great value of the mine ; it
adjoined “the recently-sold Central mine, the Block 11
of the Proprietary Co., and the rich Block 10” ; also “all
the evidence ” showed that the B.H. lode was not under-
lying west, so that “ the great probability is that the
sinking of the shaft (now down 374 ft.) will result in
getting the great Block 11 lode.” Forthwith these shares,
which had gone begging for a threepenny call, sprang, or
rather were worked, to the neighborhood of 3s.
Meantime a rumor was diligently circulated
that the Proprietary had discovered another big lode-
body to the far east, adding greatly, of course, to the
value of the North Central, supposing it to be true that
the Broken Hill lode does underlay to the east. Whether,
however, it does underlay east or not, it is positively not
true that “all the evidence” is against a western under-
lay. It it does go east, it is certain that the lode must
turn in order to do it; for the first few hundred feet it
unquestionably goes west. The chances, then, of the
North Central getting the Block 11 lode are very remote
indeed ; the chances that it will get it at a workahledepth
are remoter still. And, it is worth remembering, the lode
at 1200 ft. in Block 10 (it hadn't passed out into the next
claim east at that depth) was, with our present Imperfect
knowledge of sulphide-treatment, worthless. Further
than that, the big find in the far east of the Proprietary
proves to be a small thing.
Anyway, here is the North Central co. hold-
ing a block of land which must absorb tens of thousands
of pounds in prospecting if the prospecting is to be Worth
anything ; yet it is in the hands of a co. which can just
pay its debts, and that is all. There is nothing, there-
fore, for the shareholders to do but go on paying call
after call for month after month—which, of course, share-
holders won’t do ; as a rule, they won’t pay a penny after
the stock has ceased to be quoted. If, then, the North
Central was not revived merely for the sake of having
more cheap gambling counters in the market, appearances
are deceptive ; for it is hardly credible that the directors
expected another “ American syndicate ” to relieve them
ot the claim.
• ,^ e same time, in Sydney, there have sprung
mto life the Junction Extended, of even the whereabouts of
which Broken Hill seems to be a little uncertain. Quota-
tioiis of both North Central and Junction Extended are
confined' to Sydney, Fortunate Sydney—her silver-mine
speculations have always been the rankest takes-iii and
wil' ,reB Bun through the list of the last few years—
White Rock, Lewis Ponds, Tom’s, Mt. Stewart, even
bunny Corner, Phoenix, Lubra, &c. They lost the B.H.
Central a,nd the South, the best things they had, before
these claims emerged from darkness.
The North Central was, it is suspected, floated
off (perhaps one might even say jettisoned) when the
Central was terribly hard up, just as, on an earlier occa-
sion, the Central Blocks was got rid of. It was regis-
tered as a no liability 00., and with such wretchedly
insufficient capital that failure was a foregone conclusion.
But what should the promoters care for the failure of the
pup when the parent was in danger I
Soon a tremendous effort may be made to twist
the northern part of the Broken Hill lode about. The
discovery of the new body in the Junction has opened up
a new field for speculation. This fact may be worth
remembering all along. The North and the Junction
North are nob end-on, but side by side ; the Victoria
Cross and the North are end-on.

A new and important development has taken
place at Oobar, N.S.W., on an extension of the belt of
country to which the whole of its gold-mines are confined.
Principally they are low-grade, but at this particular spot
something in some respects resembling the' Drysdale has
been discovered. The finders got a small alluvial patch
and found its source to be a body of soft micaceous slate
and felsite, 18in. of which carries wonderfully rich gold.
The first 8 tons went over lOoz. to the ton, and the next
20 tons over 140 z., and the stone they are now raising
seems milch richer than even the last. ' The richest of the
gold is now occurring in little quartz-and-ironstone seams,
and the formation outside for eight or ten feet contains
payable gold.

The Mt. Drysdale Co. started its mill last

only about a week’s water. It is tune it stopped-
“monkeying” and started to work its show with some-

side the rich narrow streak in the mine carry payable
gold ? If so, the Mt. Drysdale will probably have a long
div.-life ; if not, its life will be short, and the persons who
paid from £7OO to £BOO each for shares will continue to
curse the mine instead of themselves.

to know it. The mine may yet turn out well ; I hope it
will. The latest is the breaking of the crank-shaft of Ihe

Dear Bulletin,—" A Golden Shanty ” is paro-
died at Cue, Westralia, where the church is partly built
of quartz blocks donated by claim-holders whose belief
in Providence was apparently greater than their faith in
the British purchasing public. As many of these speci-
mens show shotty gold, the steady church-goer has a
chance to get even on the collection-plate with the point
of his pocket-knife; and should the field ever go bung
the parson can, by dollying up the sacred fabric and
panning it off in holy water, get enough to pay his coach-
fare to the coast. Wonder some sacrilegious fossicker
has not pegged out the gospel-mill as a quartz claim ere
this.—W.W.

W.A.. news is most conflicting. One day
it is wired that the Govt, has a big water-scheme,
the next that the Premier, speaking at Northern said—
“ They had been investigating the undertaking of bring-
ing water on to the goldfields, but found that such a
scheme would cost millions ; consequently, the Govt, did
not contemplate moving further in that direction until
they had exhausted the possibilities of deep boring and
surface conservation.”

Ten-head : “It makes me tired to read of the big
and numerous water-schemes for Coolgardie. Sydney D.T.
says there will be a great increase in gold-production
there as soon as the water-famine has been “adequately
relieved.” That water-famine has lasted over three years.
It is about time to think what the place will be when it
does strike a drought. Where, in Heaven’s name, are
they going to get water in a region where there are many
hundreds of miles without a river and “lakes” without
water, a country with a rainfall of a few inches yearly,
and land so spongy as to absorb water as fast as it falls.
A large percentage of even that recovered is lost by
condensation. At sixpence a gallon they manage to get
sufficient for domestic purposes, but a 10-head battery
will use much more water than 1000 men can drink- It
is a gigantic difficulty which cloaks gigantic
mining swindles, but it must be faced. The ocean is the
only certain unfailing supply, and to bring .it in ,wiH» take
years.”

Every mine has its day of reckoning. That of
the Plunderderry has arrived. The old owners, Mills,
Huxley, and party, are calling on the Earl of Fingal for a
declaration that they are entitled to the £30,000 long
ago deposited with the Union Bank, pending some
arrangement in re short acreage. The shares repre-
senting their sixth interest have not yet been released.
The specimens (worth from £15,000 to £20,000, and includ-
ing Big Ben and others “ on the gold knobs of which
you could hang your hat”) having well played their part,
have been returned to Australia. How many of the
people who gazed on them in London ever suspected
that they represented the big end of the mine, or under-
stood that they were still the property of the finders?
And how long will it be before Mr. Bull will take another
mine at £700,000, under like circumstances?

Kalgooriie wire: “In sinking a hole for a
verandah-post ■•'!! the main street, gold was discovered in
a cement d posit, which, it appears, runsunder the whole
town, and will probably be worked later on.” The fact
of a covering of cement extending miles over the hills, as
well as the fiats of this field, was known two years ago,
but the rich claims on it were confinid to a short gutter.
It is u ider ihis cement formation, in decomposed diorite,
kaolin, conglomerate, and other mullocky formations, that
the new developments occurred—not in the large white
and r ick-salt-looking quattz reefs, which distinguish the
fields, and will probably ex-tinguish many W.A. mines.

In a letter from the Murchison : “ Weather
very trying just now’, 112° in our otfija —w'ith clouds of
flies and frantic fights between willy-willies and cock-
eyed bobs (two separate and distinct whirlwinds—they
cannot meet without a row). There are three distinct
columns of dust at the present moment in the main
street —one of them really worth photographing. It must
be over 200 ft. high, and forms a spiral structure in which,
among other things, is an empty kerosene-tin and a
couple of dryhlowers’ hats.” The Bulletin s theory
is that these fighting whirlwinds are mining lies
which have assumed another form. What appears to be
a kerosene-tin in the kiok-up above-mentioned is simply
the reincarnation, so to speak, of some colossal perjury
told about, say, the Emerald or the Day Dawn, a year or

Vic. Secretary for Mines Howitt says there are

alluvial Helds. Govt, drills have proved 40 miles of leads

Straws point to Vic. in the near future wiping
out, or at least much curtailing, the iniquitous royalty
tax on mining. As an example of how the land-owner
scores, note the £250,000 exacted by the Seven Hills
Estate Freehold Co. from the famous Berry group. As
gold is really the property of the State, it is a gross im-
pertinence for the landowner to demand excessive
royalty, or even royalty at all, although, perhaps, it is
only right liberal compensation should be paid for surface
damage. It is time for legislation.

The Mallee Bill, as introduced by the Turner
Government, provided for selection and for terminating
leases. Selection meant ultimate alienation from the State
and the leases meant a limited tenure. The Labor corner
declared it would oppose alienation in every form and
degree. Irvine succeeded in finding a middle course,
lie provided an option between freehold and perpetual-
leasehold. The Tories in the House could conceive of no
rent not rack-rent, and bitterly opposed the proposal.
Irvine was able to enlighten them as to a rent that was
not raised with the improvements effected by the occupier.
He preached to them the old, old story of unimproved
values. The verbiage of the amendment he got into the
Bill is an object-lesson for Parliaments: “The board
shall, in fixing the amount of rent payable in each case,
estimate the value of the land comprised in the perpetual
leasehold as if the same were freehold land not cleared or
cultivated, and without any' fences, buildings, or other
improvements thereon, and shall fix the rent payable at
an amount equal to 3 per centum of such estimated
value.” The House then substituted 2 per cent, for 3 per
cent.

Some cheap mines : Garden Gully United, with
£696,315 divs. on £4742 capital, only 2s. lid. per share
being called up. Present yields hardly worth speaking
about—67o tons for 750 z. 10dwt., hut there are signs of
improvement, as the stopes at the 2245 ft. level are show-
ing colors. Frederick the Great Tribute paid £101,275
divs. on £8450 ; United Devonshire, £219,800 on £33,700 ;
New Ohum Consolidated, £133,700 on £18,200; Great
Extended Hustlers, £451,100 on £41,850 ; United Hustlers
and Redan, £122 000 on £19,200 capital. All these mines
are still pegging away for small yields, with good pro-
spects of better things as they get deeper.
This year’s Bendigo divs. aregradually overtaking
the calls. For 46 weeks they amounted to £118,823 Is.,
showing £1163 6s. 7d. balance in favor of calls, which a
few weeks back stood some’ £6OOO ahead. So Bendigo
looks like turning into the new year with a small balance
in hand.
Next month the question of selling the New-
Chura Railway', Lazarus, New-Chum and Victoria and
Hustler’s Reef—the big mines of the field—to J. Bull will

the Vic., which in its best days turned out £112,112 in
divs. Crushings are now unprofitable and shareholders
feel tired of 6d. calls. On the other hand, the Lazarus is
a div. payer, though not very regular at present. The
Railway is a mine of exceptional promise. Has yielded
nearly £60,000 divs. on the £29,000 subscribed, and is
going to throw off some more now the ventilation is

The Angipena gold-mine (S.A.) is alleged by
the new manager to he a salted concern. The deluded
syndicate which floated it consisted of 40 M’s.P., and
they are said to have divided 10,000 gratis shares among
them. If the salting allegations prove true 40 taken-in
M’s.P. will be viewed with grave suspicion by those who

necessary. The odour of decayed skunk about Angipena
recalls a certain very-long-deserted Maoriland mine which
an enterprising local speculator resurrected and floated
in a certain boom time. The board and the new manager
came up to inspect the property, and the manager was
lowered down the ancient shaft. As he went down he
also met with an odour as if all the dead horse and sewer-
gas in creation were waiting at the bottom, and he

potassium used should be bought from them ; and
exacted that the owners shouldn’t at any time attack

One of the boom gold-mining companies on the

was made ; it was found that dozens of claims overlapped
each other in ail directions, and when matters were

Geo. Edmonds, original prospector of the

gorgeous income of £2 10s. When the boss of the score
was out, Geo. used to turn up and get his 50 o’ flour from
Mrs. Storekeeper. When the tide suited he would nip
across the range, clamber out on the old Green Harp
workings, and capture the necessary schnapper. Could
he have raised £3O to pay court fees, the whole mine
would have been his. Hearing he was getting a little
gold, the 00. (English) secured its abandoned ground
and granted tributes. An old chap named Legge (very
hard up) took up one of them. In putting in a level to
get at bis own piece, George had to pass through Legge’g
block. Here he struck ‘‘a reef of solid gold.” Old Legge
had only to haul out the metal to the tune of £12,000.
George had to pass on, but he cleared £2O a week for 12
months out of his own tribute. When the time was up
the co. cheerfully stepped in, and has got out during

The real inwardness of Bamako’s great African
Bank is this: Barnato had mining scrip of the nominal
value of perhaps £6,000,000, but in the shaky condition of
the great African bubble an attempt to sell out might
have burst the market, and values would probably have
gone down to half-a-million. To hold on would be equally
fatal, as the burst must come sooner or later. So Bar-
nato made a bank and sold his load of scrip to it at half
its nominal value. Then he sold the bank-shares to the
public at two or three times their face value, and thus
got more for his scrip than even its inflated boom price.
When the mining scrip goes down io something like a
reasonable figure Bamako's Bank should make its share-
holders wish they were dead.

Before the South African boom partially burst
in London, the other day, the market-value of the Rand
mines was run up to £150,000,000, which means, if
the gold-yield for '95 is 50 per cent, belter than '94, a
possible div. of 1| per cent, per annum. The paper value
of Rand mining, land and trust co. shares ran up to

The celebrated Rand (South Africa) reef extends
for 50 miles, and has been proved for half that distance
not to contain a fault. The quality of the ore is remark-
ably uniform, and Dr. Schmeisser and Mr. Hamilton
Smith concur in estimating the gold to a depth of 1200 ft.
at from £300,000,000 to £350,000,000. The labor at pre-
sent employed is 50,000 natives and 8000 Europeans, and
the 2700 stamps on the ground, aided by cyaniding, can
turn out 200,0000 z. monthly with ‘‘literally no possi-
bility of a disappointment.” There is a theory that the
reef is only the outcrop of a basin connecting with the
reefs of Heidelberg and Klerks-dorp, and that the whole
might pay to work, yielding thousands of millions ; but
this theory is wholly untested, though there is more to
be said for working to a .greater depth than 1200 ft. A
ton of ore yields on the average £2 6s. 6d., to extract
which costs only £1 10s. 6d. Hence over one-ihird of the
gold produced is profit. In '94, with a production of over
2,000,0000 z., worth £7,500,000, the industry yielded, there-
fore, a profit of over £2,500,000, of which £1,580,000 was
paid in divs., the remainder being used for improvements
or development of the properties; this year the output
will be 2,500,0000 z., the profits £3,250,000 ; and the div.
perhaps £2,500,000 ; next year—the increase in the num-
ber of stamps warrants this assumption—there will be an
output of 3,000,0000 z., and £3,500,000 may be paid in div.

Dear Bulletin, —Sawdust may yet supersede
metal and gravel in road-making. An intelligent N.S.W.
man, noticing that the timber-waggons never bogged
near the mills, dumped a few loads of sawdust round his
house, mixed it with sand, and in a little time had a firm,
clean, elastic yard. The atiention of the road-super was
drawn to it, and he experimented on a bit of road with
satisfactory results. It binds well, is porous, doesn’t cut
up, and there is no rumbling, jolting or vibration. In
fact, you don’t know what driving is till you’ve been along
a “dusted” road. There are thousands of tons of the
stuff on the coast rivers, and the coastal roads will soon
be paved with it.—Ponte.

Broker has a friend running a pub. Latter places it in

disbursed it. Only remedy is to sue vendor, who is
always under bill of sale and penniless. Buyer loses

The Neiv Governor’s Reception .
The reception given our new Governor, Viscount
Hampden, was a very slow function compared to
the gorgeous demonstration, a few weeks ago, in
Melbourne. The public lined the streets along
which the procession travelled, but there was an
absence of vociferous cheering, and instead of look-
ing delighted, people mostly seemed woebegone
and, at any rate, listless. Our representative of
Royalty will, however, be pleased to find that he
can obtain at the leading tobacconists in Sydney
those delightful smokes, B. L. Corto Rothschild

The street welcome given to Sydney’s new
Governor was participated in by a moderate
crowd. There was a fair display of flags ; the
Corporation, or somebody, had tied red handker-
chiefs round some of the telegraph-posts, and the
banks hung the_overdraft out of the window by
way of decoration. The gathering on Circular
consisted mostly of women, and each woman
who had a clean handkerchief waved it. Then
the crowd started off to intercept His Ex. and
have another look at him. A great cloud of dust
rolled up Pitt-street, and running in the midst of
it came small boys, and pickpockets, and dogs,
and women of dubious character with their boots
unlaced, and a cow, all bound for the next cor-
ner. This group was the only one which put on
anything like «- real spurt to see His Ex.

The route selected for thb new Governor’s
triumphal entry into Sydney was about the worst
that could have been chosen—the one least cal-
culated to give him an idea of what Sydney is
really like. His Excellency should have been
taken up Johnson’s Bay in the Annandale ferry-
boat the dirt-coloured one—past the dead dogs
and the gas-inflated sheep which fell overboard
last month, and landed at Stephen -street jetty.
Then the procession should have struggled through
the maze of murky lanes behind the local town-
hall, along Smith-street and Mullins-street to the
abattoirs where the smell of offal is always in the
air, and across the bridge into Pyrmont, thence
along the edge of that Great Dismal Swamp
known as Blackwattle Cove, and down the right-
of-way between the threepenny pub., where the
fight is always going on, and the coal-shed kept by
the man with the wooden ieg - . This would
enable it to take a short cut through the
back way where the stables and the marine store
and the hide-and-skin depot are until it emerged
through M'Ginnis’s side-alley into Union-street.
From there it would n'turally go across the
bridge into that waterside region about the

bottom of Market-street, where one-ha f the shops
are threepenny pubs, and the other half deal in
oilskins with the exception of a few butchers’
establishments where the local females come and
paw the chops with their fingers to see if there
isn t too much bone in them. And from there
the procession ought to have meandered through
Sussex-street, where the onion stores are, and
Engine-street, and Mary Ann-street, and Wex-
ford-street, and the other localities where women
fight on the pavements, and the great Australian
adjective is in the air, and the male inhabitants
lean up against the door of the 125.-a-week board-
ing-house. Finally, it might have got back by
the Benevolent Asylum and the gas-works to
Lower George-street, and across in the horse-punt
to the North Sydney desiccator, where his Excel-
lency could have been sworn in. That would have
been something like an entry.

One day last week five women, unassisted
by lawyers, appeared in person in Judge Win-
deyer’s Court to claim divorces, and it was made
a matter of remark that they got their cases suc-
cessfully through with more expedition and
smoothness than the solicitored and barristered
suitors. “Don’t go away with the idea,” said
a court official, “that women are as clever at
other law business as at divorce. The smartest
of these divorce women couldn’t fill up a dog-
license. But once they take divorce in their head
they study the whole thing like a catechism.”

In a lecture at Sydney the other day,
poor parson Clarke remarked that under the
administration of the N.S.W. divorce-law, accord-
ing to events that have occurred during the past
few years, the rich man was treated differently
from the poor man. Di vorces, in several instances,
were granted in camera, apparently because the
petitioners were prominent people, and the poor
man was compelled, seemingly because he was
without influence, to find his private life made
public property. The granting of a divorce in
camera, according to a ruling of theChief-Justice,
the lecturer stated, was not permitted by the Act,
yet men who were influential enough obtained
divorce in that way.

THE GREAT SHEEP CONTINENT.
Once, Lady Carington decreed
That just a native Cornstalk weed
Was quite a model flower ;
She put it in her bosomed vest;
Without it she was never “ dressed ; ”
And, from that very hour,
’Twas plucked, and sold, and bought, and shown,
As if’t had specially been grown
Within a hothouse bower.
And poets since have turned their “ feet,”
And orators their phrases neat,
On New South Wales’s “star-like,” sweet
And glorious flannel-flower!
And yet—and yet—and yet, indeed,
It is the same old sorry weed.
The Brasseys and the Hampdens, too,
Belong unto the cycling crew ;
And, following their likes,
With men and women ’tis the rage,
Or stout or slender in the gauge,
To be a guy on bikes !
Thus Fashion tyrannises wit,
The madder and more hideous it,
The worse you see the public bit.
0 ! would but Hampden walk on stilts,
All garbed in loud, short-waisted kilts,
I’ll bet you a bawbee
The population would go mad,
Nor stilts nor kilts could soon be had—
You’d see what you would see
And, oh ! would Brassey don a tail,
And hop upon an “ old man’s ” scale,
Tattoo his face in shapes,
And 101 l his tongue—it seems to me
By tens and hundreds soon we’d see
His imitating apes !
1 knew a man—he was a man I
Who never, never, never ran
Where other people led ;
Who never honored Fashion’s whim ;
I had a real respect for him
Alas ! that man is dead !
The moral makes my flesh to creep :
Can Nationhood awake from sleep
Where even biped males are— SHEEP?

Loudon Spectator, of Sept. 21, has an
article on “ Professional Secrecy ” which miglit
have been written with a special view to the Dean

tell our own secrets is generally folly, but folly
without guilt ; to tell those which are entrusted
to us, is always treachery, and treachery for the
most part combined with folly,’’ the writer
declares that “ men want to feel, not that the
doctor or lawyer will keep secret what he regards
as secret matter, but everything indiscriminately
that comes to him in his professional capacity.
They do not want their adviser to judge whether
the rule of secrecy applies, but to make the con-
sulting-room like the confessional-box —a place
from which no news issues.”

A pious Melb. drapery firm is lamenting
the sinful lapse of its respected caretaker, vvho
used to take a Sunday-school class and sing
praises to the Lord. At latest dates the valued
servant had been detected in the indiscretion of
assisting a married woman to rob the store.
The misguided female was wont to visit her friend
the caretaker at night, and combine unhallowed
love with felonious “shaking” of the goods. It
had been observed that ladies of “ill-fame”
were in the habit of conversing with the caretaker
at the door, and he was spoken to on the sub-
ject. And what did he reply, dear friends ? He
replied, with tears in his eyes, that he was
“ striving to turn these unhappy sisters from their
evil ways.”

An acute conjugal affection was the matter
with the Dacres throughout their married life.
They desired not only to live and die together,
but to “star ” together—emulating the Kendals—
as long as they remained in the theatrical pro-
fession. English engagements for one or other of
them separately were sometimes available, and
they refused the chances offered, preferring to
wait for the successful joint engagement which
seldom came, and shutting their eyes to the fact
that time was discounting their financial value.
Australia seems called upon to excuse itself, in a
measure, for not having been attracted by
the sound dramatic talent of Amy Roselle,
in conjunction with Daore’s uneven ability.
Several circumstances accounted for their
failure to draw the public, but the lady s
buxom figure was perhaps the first. Ex-
cellence in the art of acting doesn’t go for
much with an Australian audience if the per-
former be physically unconvincing. Amy Roseiie
was too matronly a heroine for' them to rave
about; also Arthur Dacre, whom the writer re-
members as a slim, romantic type of beauty-man,
was rather too large to please the multitude.
Husband and wife aged unnecessarily within a
few vears. because they were so often “ resting ”
together instead of acting apart from one another.
Their mutual belief in “ the Dacres” told against
them every way. It kept them idle and weakened
their capacity for rapid study of new parts. Here
was one immediate cause of their melancholy
end. Dacre railed wildly at the Melbourne
Bijou management for changing the bill
every fortnight, without pausing to consider
that a manager’s policy emanates from the
pay-boxes. If a show is making a profit it
doesn’t get withdrawn these times. The Dacres
pieces were invariably run at a loss, therefore, it
may be remarked in parenthesis, they never had
real grounds for complaining of unfair treatment.
At the Bijou they—or rather husband Dacre, who
spoke for self and wife—would have refused to
undertake “ more study ” once a fortnight but for
the manager’s blunt statement that he must
change the bill or close the theatre. Doubtless
more study came very hard on these artists who
had learned so few parts of late years, Amy
Roselle, an actress from her childhood, may not
have found the strain very severe, but Dacre did.
His brain began to give way. Everything worried
him more than ever, especially new parts. He
began to think seriously about suicide, and the
sympathetic Amy shared this along with all his
other thoughts. It needed only a little more
study strain on poor Daore’s mind to bring the
devoted couple to the point where life seems no
longer worth living.
When Dacre was required to master the long
part of Dean Maitland at a short notice he got
his death-warrant. Then his exaggerated sense of
misfortune became insupportable, and that shock-
ing Sunday tragedy came to pass. It is easily
traced to an acute conjugal affection. The Dacres
inordinate mutual love and esteem kept them
from acting apart, and made them amiable crea-
tures though they were in private hfe-almost
“ impossible ” people to deal with professionally.
Long absences from the stage impaired the hus-
band’s power of assimilating words, the worry of
an unusual (for him) amount of study drove him
mad, and “The Silence of Dean Maitland
brought his madness to a crisis. Amy Roselle,
for her part, seems to have accepted cheerfully
the idea of dying at the same time as her husband
under whatever circumstances he might care to
select. # , #

Ethel Wright, the heroine of the Gunnedah
poisoning-case, are obviously hoaxes, io quote
Frank Rogers, Q.C., with an unimportant varia-
tion, it is “ unreasonable to suppose that a girl on
the threshold of life would risk her existence by
throwing “a deadly irritant poison over herself
“for the purpose of bringing a false charge
against ” a neighbor, let alone her uncle.

Lawyer Barrett, in Melb. Insolvency
Court: “ When woman’s rights are more generally
recognised, we shall have a lady Judge m the
Insolvency Court” :
This may be a truthful prophecy.
Of one thing we are sure, old fellow :
When what’s predicted comes to be,
Because of woman’s vanitee
The Judge’s wig will be bright yellow.
A Maoriland genius
wants all clocks shoved on
two hours by Act of Parlia-
ment, so that the man who
nominally goes to his office
at nine will really get there
by seven, and the man who
arrives at his job at seven
will really be there at five,
and people who get up at
five will, in actual fact, do
it at three, and the hotel
breakfast will be at six a.m.,
and the milk will come round
about 3.30, and everything
will be two hours earlier.
The idea is to violently
shove the people into early-
rising habits, and make
them live by daylight in-
stead of gas. Early rising,
so far, has been a failure
because the average man
wants to have his leisure
after his day’s work is ended,
not before it is begun, but if
everything was put forward
two hours he would rise
early and still have his rest
at the right end of the day.
The Wellington (M. L.)
Philosophical Institute is
thinking over the matter,
and talks of bringing it
before Parliament. •

The Firm’s revival of
“ Pinafore ” reminds one
that the Rackstraws, Bob-
stays and Buckets of Aus-
tralia’s Imperial navy don’t
love their Captain Corcoran
as they should. Aboard
H.M.S. Wallaroo the—haw !
—splendid seamen complain
that night-leave has been
stopped in order that they
may feel quite fresh at 4 a.m.
when they are called from
their hammocks to scrub
decks. Also, it appears that
a couple of other naval com-
manders on the Australian
station are not extravagantly
praised by their subjects.
Instead of singing joyful
choruses to these potentates
the men bemoan their lot in
a minor key, and call upon
the cherub who sits up aloft
to tell ’em whether this ’ere is
a convict-ship or a bulwark
of Hingland’s greatness. All things considered,
The Bulletin would be sorry to hear of the
Russians bombarding Australia just now. If
some of our warships went into action, and two
or three superior officers were carried away by the
first cannon-ball, the jolly tars would refuse to
make any more war upon the bloomin’ foreigners
who had done them such a favor.

Within the past week various Melb. news-
agents and paper-runners have been interviewed
bv constables and cautioned that if they continue
the sale of certain locally-printed newspapers
they will be prosecuted. This proceeding is so
unlike the usual summary methods of the police
that it becomes plain that the threats in question
are mere “ bluff,” unjustified by the provisions of
any statutory enactment. Under the circum-
stances, and with a view to preventing the estab-
lishment of any sort of a police censorship, iHE
Bulletin trusts that the police action will be
defied. The defeat of the authorities m such an
issue would compel the Puritans to take their
grievance to the proper place, Parliament, where
t could be thrashed out openly.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and-away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone whomak s
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats,

Among the Sydney shows, this is a dull,
dead season, when very little happens, and
even that little happens in a listless fashion,
and generally proves, when it does happen,
to be an old thing which happened before
a long time ago. The Criterion and the Opera
House remain closed, which is their usual con-
dition nowadays, and so do most of the small,
moth-eaten establishments which, in better times,
are wont to break out periodically in charge of
some wild-cat company and wrestle with the gas-
bill. There is not a comedy, or an opera, or a
society-play left in Sydney ; the three big theatres
are all grappling with melodrama, and bashing
the skull ot the injured heroine with a sickening
biff against a hard world, and the only difference
is that the Lyceum has a sneerful, cynical villain
in store clothing, and the Royal has a clerical
villain in a white choker, and Her Majesty’s has
a hard-faced villain in oaths and high boots and a
colored shirt. It is an oppressive state of things.
** * *
The Firm withdrew that bright little
comedy, “One of Our Girls,” after one short
week at Sydney Lyceum, and in a wholly un-
accountable fashion put up in its stead the
“ Carson Case.” This latter is a crude American
shriek, which has been localised so far that the
hero is falsely accused in Balmain, and put in
Darlinghurst Gaol, and the sneerful villain insults
a helpless woman in front of the G.P.0., and runs
in disguise through the Domain, and is finally
arrested on the wharf at Woolloomooloo. Other-
wise, there is nothing specially local about it.
For plain, unassuming flatness, which sinks down
restfully like a mass of mud upon the soul, the
“ Carson Case ” ranks very high indeed. A vast
steam-roller has evidently gone over it, and has
reduced it to one solemn dead-level throughout.
It is the same thing which is marked on the map
as the Great African Desert. The plot is sugges-
tive at the beginning of the “ Silver King ”;
there is a weak husband, who is led into drink by
the rival who wanted his wife ,in her pre-marital
days; the rival is in the burglary line in both
cases ; and in both cases the husband recovers
from a drunk to find that a horrid crime—which
the rival really committed, and which is the same
crime in each case—is on his soul, and while he is
away the rival haunts his wife, and does the great
hog-act generally. The rest of the piece is mostly
a reminiscence of the “ Ticket-of-Leave Man.”
The dialogue is a good deal brighter in places
than might be expected, but the utter want of
originality suggests that the plot was purchased
in Mosenstein’s second-hand emporium.
# * #
Elton, who gets up as a striking duplicate
of B. Holt, and Miss Helen Dauvray brighten up
this lamentable affair with an unearthly bright-
ness which is not its own ; and Miss Grace Noble,
who has been driven into unaccustomed ways of
melodrama, makes a pretty and rather pathetic
little wife, but is bowed down by the weight of the
great four-act horrpr on her head. There is too
much of it for a girl of her size to support. King
Hedley is a moderately successful drunken hero;
and Scot Inglis is a nice, highly-polished villain,
in a tall, shiny hat—so highly polished that a lady
could see to do her back-hair in him ; and Miss
Polly Emery occupies a conspicuous Irish situa-
tion in the background with great advan-
t ige; ■ and Miss Nelly Mortyne and Cyril
Keightley both db' very good work; and
some other people are by no means so bad as
some other people. But, despite a strong com-
pany, and fine scenic effects, and the knocking
down of the villain in full view of the post-office
clock, and the arch-fiend escaping in disguise
through the Domain, the best that can be said for
the “ Carson Case ” is that it is a good drama to
go opt in the middle of and have a long rest.
Drama at the Lyceum is evidently a bad spec.,
and even though the management turned on the
new Governor a's an attraction, the first-night
audience was thin and low-spirited.
** * *
“The Silence of Dean Maitland”—the
last straw which broke poor Arthur Dacre—made
its postponed appearance at Sydney Royal on
Saturday. After sitting it out from the first word
to the last in all its profound weepfulness, and
listening to the murky soul-wail of the Dean, and
the ghosts that haunted him, and the voices that
gibbered at him in the night, and the footfalls that
were always arriving at the front-door of his soul,
and the visions that worried him, and the baleful
eyes which insisted on looking at him in his dis-
ordered imagination—after all this the writer
really wouldn’t like to say for certain that Dacre
didn’t act wisely in getting away from it all when
he did. The great fault of the drama is that
almost all the action in the original story is left
out. Everard’s trial, his unjust sentence, and his
20 years’imprisonment are mentioned at second-
hand ; there is only the murder in the prologue,
and thereafter four long acts are filled up with the
worm that dieth not. The Dean sits round
through these four acts and grows old with the
worm for company, and has visions and horrors
and shudders, and sees slimy things in his mind.
His friends mostly die—their deaths are mentioned
by someone in Act ll.—and he and his sister and
his blind son and the worm live together, and do
nothing in particular except wait. There is much
stupendous waiting in the drama, and not one
gleam of anything cheerful, save the agricultural
mirth of three who are having a pot of
beer in the prologue! Finally, a bad man, who
knows the guilty secret, but has kept dark about
it for 17 years for some wholly unexplained reason,
interferes, and the Dean dies a horrible death in
the big cathedral, in front of the stained-glass
window.
* * #
Only a very few people in the long cast
deserve serious notice. Miss Fitzmaurice Gill,
as the Dean’s sister, is bright and convinc-
ing, and plays her part with much force. This
lady has improved remarkably of late, and has
also developed a sudden and striking resemblance
to the stately Geraldine Oliffe. Cathcart plays a
small part in his usual excellent style; Miss
Gwen Dallas makes a rather nice Alma Lee ; and
Johnson Weir as the Dean—who is a good half of
the play in himself—is respectable in a mediocre
fashion, and hardly strikes one really high note all
through. The rest of the co., with one exception
in the person of Mr. Field, and a partial excep-
tion in favor of a certain agricultural grandfather,
is pretty much one dead-level throughout, and in

some cases it is a distinct hollow. Still, at the
worst, Mr. Lewis Scott’s drama is a gentlemanly
production, and the wail is distinctly high-toned.

Nothing new has happened to “Robbery
Under Arms ” since last week, save that one
night the mail-coach, which Dampier sticks up so
persistently, made a strenuous and unrehearsed
attempt to escape into the orchestra, and carry
its elderly passenger to an unhonored grave among
the ruins of the bassoon. The bushrangers, how-
ever, buried their personal animosities and seized
the front horse unanimously. Business continues
remarkably good, and unless Alfred Woods’s
nigger gives out in the legs under the strain of
continuous bounding, it will run till Friday.
“His Natural Life” follows, and the rasping
sound as Gabbett sharpens his teeth can already
be heard all down Pitt-street.
** * *
At the Tivoli, on Saturday night, Miss
Alice Leamar received a soul-stirring reception
from the biggest crowd which could be inserted
into that building. The lady looks as young and
fluffy and golden-haired as she was some years
ago, and she still casts herself head-first into her
business with a frenzied energy which appeals to
the great soul of the gallery. It was when she
appeared in the rational dress of the advanced
bicycle female, however, that the enthusiasm
reached its highest point —evidently the gallery
prefers its Alice in pants, though it also views her
with high approval in skirts and a big hat. The
enthusiasm went as far as six consecutive encores,
and a dreadfully exhausted goddess was the natu-
ral result.
** * *
A good business is still doing at the Sydney
Music Hall, and sundry new artists turn up each
week to lend variety to the bill. The harmless,
necessary corner-man gets some new ideas now
and then, and aims quaint conundrums at the man
in the centre, and some good singers and dancers
brighten up the proceedings, but nothing very
dreadful happens. Possibly, considering the
pressure of competition just now, the manage-
ment would do well to get hold of something
dreadful, and make it happen at once, for the
satisfaction of the ghoulsome public. Miss Amy
Gourlay and her brother Bill have joined the co.,
and make it a good deal stronger than it was
before, and nothing in the programme calls for
particular execration at present.
** * *
“ The Yeomen of the Guard " revival, at
Melb. Princess’s, is about as many degrees above
the W. and M. Opera Go’s average success as the
recent “ Pinafore ” performance was below the
standard. Perhaps it is too late in the day to
convince Australia that “ The Yeomen ” is Gilbert
and Sullivan’s masterpiece, for hitherto thecharm
and pathos of the libretto have not been brought
home to the public soul. Now, for the first time,
this serio-comic opera, containing no extravagant
topsy-turveydom, topical satire, or sunshine,
seems to reveal the collaborateurs at their best.
The performance isn’t perfect, but much of it is
unusually admirable and the balance quite good
enough. If all Melbourne were to pray for a
better show, on a Sunday set apart for the pur-
pose, the chances are that Providence would con-
sider the petition unnecessary and ignore it
accordingly.
* * *
Howard Vernon, as the gruesome assistant
tormentor, puts a little more depth, here and
there, into his original, fine, broad effects, some
of which, perhaps, would be finer if he narrowed
them down. Miss Graupner, whose voice pro-
mises to recover its lost form, sings more cleverly
and acts the part of Elsie Maynard rather better
than of old. The same remarks, multiplied by
two, apply to Miss Ida Osborne. Her character
(sister Phcebe) is full of acting opportunities, and
she is now a distinctly brighter and more
capable artiste than when she formerly tackled
her task-in a somewhat perky spirit. George
Lauri, too, has developed the love-lorn jester
into an object of general sympathy, and the heart
of the man in motley breaks with an impressive
snap at the finish. Lissant is a well-spoken,
natural Sergeant Meryll, Miss Cameron is always
an effective Dame, and Miss May Pollard fills the
little part of the Dame’s daughter in a valuable
manner. Also, the First Yeoman does great
credit to the chorus «■’ en "ailed upon to step forth
and sing a solo. ’ Tw str . ingly-fresh features of
the performance are W.o.ace Brownlowand Cour-
tice Pounds. The baritone is chiefly required to
talk historically and flaunt fine clothes as a
medieval Governor of the Tower should. Brown-
low does these things with commendable earnest-
ness.
* * -■< *
Courtice Pounds appears as the hero,
Fairfax, and except that he is more plump and
cheerful than one would expect to find an amateur
alchemist, the new tenor deserves enthusiastic
praise. He gives the full meaning to his lines,
puts a sharp point to the occasional jokes, sings
spiritedly, and makes love like a man. Tenors, as
a rule, go courting in a sentimental ballad bass.
Take him altogether, Courtice Pounds represents
fifty per cent, of the improvement in this per-
formance of “The Yeomen’’over all that have
gone before. Unfortunately, the revival is for
one week only.
** * *
On Saturday, a new comedy-opera, “La
Belle Therese,” will be produced at the Prin-
cess’s. It is, as its name indicates, very Frenchy,
and comes with a large reputation from its native
gay Paree.

George Rignold, up to time of writing, had
resisted all temptations to prolong his season at
Melb. Royal, so, unless Lord Brassey or some-
body commands him to stay on and accomplish
another spectacle, George is likely to make a fare-
well appearance in “Youth” this week. Last
Saturday there was a distribution of souvenirs
among a crowded audience, and a widow, who
had purchased a shilling’s-worth of pit, had the
felicity of winning a handsome gold watch with
her ticket.

The arrival of John Coleman at the Opera
House on Saturday was found to be a cause for
considerable joy. The comedian from England
caught on.' Also two other new-comers, indigen-
ous to the soil, knocked one another about with
success, and the bear proprietor worried his poor
unassuming beasts in a way pleasing to some
people. Talking of cruelty to animals—-mesmerist
Kennedy is concluding a not very popular season
in Melbourne. The cataleptic person will remain
in his glass case (unless the police do their duty)
until Saturday, and Kennedy invites the lower
orders of humanity to come along in the meantime
and see what is “ practically a corpse.” The
Gaiety still struggles bravely on with a variety
show,

The Bulletin desires to recall attention
to Signora Majeroni’s benefit. It will happen, as
already remarked, on the afternoon of Wednes-
day next (Dec. 4), at Melbourne Princess’s, and
the programme is so large and magnificent that a
short 'paragraph couldn’t'do it justice. There-
fore further particulars must be left to the reader’s
imagination.

Letter from New Guinea:—“We saw
three or four hundred fighting men, going up in
canoes, evidently on the war-path. The Governor,
with all his force, started after them up the river
but was too late. He met them coming back with
canoes loaded with spoil. By the amount of
human flesh aboard they must have wiped a
village clean out. They had men, women, and
children all roasted ; one little girl was tied to a
pole the same as they do with pigs. The Govern-
ment men fired at them, killed three, wounded
others, and broke up the party.”
Ex-Railway Commissioner Speight grinds
his teeth over one passage in the judgment of the
Vic. Full Court, dismissing his application for
another go at the Age. He was informed that
he might perhaps have done well in his libel-
actions by contending that some of the Age
statements libelled him in his private, rather than
his public, capacity—but the point wasn't raised.
Then the judgment, having pointed out the chance
he had missed, refused him a new trial.
Ed. Bulletin, —Let me straighten up
your facts in the matter of that writ which you
say I served on Gov. Darling. In the “Darling
crisis”’nearly 30 years ago, W. J. Gerard sued
the Crown, under the “Crown Remedies Act,”
for the return of duties which he alleged to be
wrongfully paid. He obtained a verdict for the
amount, and his solicitor, T. J. Wyburn, received
the piothonotary’s certificate for payment. One
Richard M'Millan, by direction of Mr. Wyburn,
went to Sir Charles Darling at the Treasury on
the advice of the late Mr. Fellows, and asked for
payment. This was a cause of annoyance to the
Governor, and was commented on at the time by
the liberal press. I was about the same time pro-
fessionally employed as a solicitor in an intended
application to the Supreme Court by Messrs. R.
D. Ireland, Fellows and Ward, against the then
Treasurer, Attorney-General, and manager of the
London Chartered Bank, for subverting the Audit
Act in confessing judgment and obtaining the
Governor’s authority for payment. This applica-
tion, through disagreement amongst the counsel,
was abandoned on the morning it was to be heard.
In-after years, without any justification, these two
matters became somehow jumbled in the public
mind, and I was charged with serving a writ on
the Governor. No writ was ever served on th-
Governor by me, or by anyone else.—George
Godfrey, Melb.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Tasmanian equivalent for the National
Ass is tbe lately-formed Taxpayers’ Association,
locally called the Taxdodgers’ Ass.
The chief business of N.S.W. Labor-party
in Parliament seems to be to roar loudly against,
and vote solidly for, tbe Reid Government. Reid
smiles back fatly.
Queensland’s departed Governor, Norman,
says that “ the feeling of Australian loyalty to
England is so general that there is practically no
other side to the question.” Pooh! Indifference
is not loyalty.
In a full House, the S.A. Leg. Council
defeated by only 12 votes to 11 a proposition tabled
—see how the plot thickens I—by Dr. Magarey to
open up negotiations with Great Britain for the
purpose of getting rid of the Northern Territory.
Twelve votes to eleven !
Talk of Vic. Government’s intention of
pensioning off Speaker Berry calls forth such
vehement protestations of innocence from the
Ministry as to suggest the galled jade. _ Yet
Berry deserves a pension, not for what he is, bub
for what he was.
Jack Hamilton’s rascally motion to make
the life of Q. Parliament five years, instead of
three, naturally meets with the warm approval
of the Boodle wraith. Anything which puts elec-
tion-day further off, which makes Parliament a
more irresponsible body, and gives freer play for
Boodlewraith manoeuvres, is bound to have the
warm approval of Q. Govt.
“Nature gave Australia the hint for
Federation when she placed this continent by
itself apart from the rest of the world and left
its interior entirely without natural boundaries.
< You are here by yourselves,’ she said, ‘ and you
have to look after yourselves and stand by your-
selves as one. country ; everywhere with common
objects, common sympathies, common conditions
of life.’ Nature’s own voice bids us federate.” —
j. \y. M'Cay, M.P. for Castlemaine (Vic.).
Sydney may be congratulated that it did
nob make itself such a grovelling ass over Gov.
Hampden as did Melbourne over Gov. Brassey.
And this at least, if nothing else, may be credited
as an achievement of N.S.W. Labor-party, and
forms a subtle indication of the indirect processes
and secondary and tertiary results of political sub-
influences upon a Government whose “ breath of
life” is to attitudinise and “ tumble before the
Democracy in a straining after popular plaudits.
Copeland suggests that Cardinal Moran,
as head of the R.O. Church in Australia, and
Bishop Smith, the Anglican Primate, should
allow themselves to be nominated for seats on the
Federal Convention, as heads of the churches.
Let it nob be forgotten that every other sect has

the same right to a nomination and the same
chance (“Buckley’s chance”) of being elected.
If the electors are fools enough to allow tne
Church as the Church to meddle m federal poli-
tics they will only be sorry once, and that once
will be all their lives.
Schey’s Bill providing for the amalgama-
tion of the two branches of the legal profession, so
that a suitor can tell his tale of Woe directly to his
advocate, instead of hiring another lawyer to
explain it to him, and paying both of them, and
further providing that a barrister must do the
work he is hired for or else return his fee, has got
through its second reading in N.S.W. Assembly.
But already a strange, gritty sound can be heard
in the air as the sharks of the Upper House
sharpen their teeth on the grindstone.
“ General ” Booth, under the patronage of
Horace Tozer, has been touring Queensland in
connection with his pauper-colonisation schemes.
The General professes to have his eye on bouth
Africa as the most acceptable dumping-ground,
but he’s touring Bananaland all the same. Africa
will undoubtedly suit him best; no turbulent,
jealous democracy ; no anti-alien agitation ; only
a happy hunting-ground for the syndicate and a
pasture-ground for its obedient slave the pauper
immigrant.
New South Wales once had a 40 years’
experience of an undivided legal profession, and
the cry which led to the severance had just as
much of the public voice in it as has that which
now seeks amalgamation. In 1829, when the
division into barristers and solicitors took place,
those then practising were allowed by the Supreme
Court to choose the'braneh they considered suited
to their tastes, and so the rift was inaugurated.
The public of ’29 believed the division would
cheapen law; now the public of ’95 appear to
think amalgamation will do it.
Q. Govt, excels in throwing apples of dis-
cord. The proposed extension of the Northern
railway from Hughenden to Winton—from
Northern into Central Territory—has badly
damaged the cordial understanding desirable
between Central and Northern Separatiomsts ;
and the batch of bribe-railways—ls in all—dangled
before the country in view of the coming elections,
has utterly demoralised the Labor-party. That
party generally votes solid, but in the bribe-rail-
way" division its members Were heads and tails,
“ Ayes ” and “ Noes,” all over the lobbies. Even
a Labor member’s principles melt in the glare of
the eye of the enraged constituent who wants a
railway “ agin his own door.”
N.S.W. Lands Minister Carruthers is pro-
moting a bill to reduce the instalments payable by
selectors from Is. to 6d. per acre per annum, and
also to reduce the interest on unpaid instalments
from 5 to 4 per cent. This means a loss to the
revenue of .£lOO,OOO a year, but it will also mean
a lot of relief to many struggling selectors—like-
wise many struggling dummies. At the same
time, it isn’t entirely the 5 per cent, instalments
to Govt, which oppress the struggling selector;
the 10 per cent, interest on his too-frequent mort-
gage has often a lot to do with the matter, and a
State Land Bank would be quite as much to the
point as a reduction of instalments. Moreover,
how does this subsidising of the agricultural
industry by .£lOO,OOO a year accord with the great
and beautiful Freetrade policy ?
Writes “A Cudgen Kanaka” to Tweed
(N.S.W.) Herald of Nov. 8
The majority of white men of this district run down the
colored men on account of wages. Let me inform you,
Mr. Editor, that the Kanakas all stick for high wages.
Almost all of us at Cudgen receive higher wages than the
white men employed there, in fact we would not work for
the pittance some white people of Cudgen receive . . .
The Kanakas in this district have always kept up wages,
and that is the great thing for all working-men to do.
You of course, remember the Kanaka strike at Oudgen,
two or three years ago, when the “boys” struck for
higher wages. That strike was not a success, because a
number of white men took the work at a great deal less
than the Kanakas.
This should help to keep the white Australian in
his proper place —the Kanaka s cheap laborer !

It needed a war of independence to con-
vince the United States of the economic utility of
Protectionism; and it will probably require a
movement for Independent Nationality to apprise
Australia of the full value and emergent sufficiency
of Protectionism. Major-General Hutton s reqm-
sition for a N.S.W. small-arms, ammunition and
powder factory is one of the signs of the times.
Another is that even Kanakaland proposes to pro-
foSS have constructed within its own
borders 40 new locomotives on which it has set its
heart. The first requisite of an independent
nation is that it must be able to be entirely self-
sunplying in the time of war; self-supplying in
arms, ammunition, food of all kinds (else a
blockade will starve it out) railway material,
ships, clothing, boots—for a naked and shoeless
army is next to useless ; and many other things.
And a time of war may be any time while the
English connection continues.
A movement is afoot inMelb.
to pension off Graham Berry, and
place Postmaster-General Duffy
in the Speaker’s chair.
Sydney Daily Telegraph
rejoices greatly over the fact that
M‘Cay, the new Protectionist
member for Oastlemaine (Vic.)
only gained his seat by 10 votes,
and says that “the coming of the
fiscal change in Victoria can be
read.” This stupid Ananias is
plainly meant to imply that the
man who was defeated by only 10
votes was a Freetrader —which he
wasn’t. The fight lay between
two Protectionists, and no “fiscal
change ” was ever mentioned.
It is instructive to note the
divisions in Bananaland Parlia-
ment on railway discussions. For
once capitalist and Labor M’sL. A.
are at one. The constituents must
be placated with their moiety of
Govt, spoil, be their alleged prin-
ciples Fat or Anti-Fat or other-
wise. Consequently, the hand of
Labor M.L.A. is against the hand
of his whilom comrade, and the
greasy palm of Money-bags is for
once lovingly gripped by the
horny paw of his former adver-
sary.
Last year, the Turner (Vic.)
Government endeavored to pass a
Bill providing that the unfinished
business of one session shall he
continued in the next at the point
where it left off, instead of being
begun all over again. The Coun-
cil dropped this valuable measure
under the table, but another at-
tempt is to be made to pass it.
The present system has absolutely
nothing to recommend it. If a
private co. burnt all its unfinished
work at the end of the year and
started everything afresh on Ist
of Jan., or amanufacturersmashed
all his unfinished products regu-
larly on 31st of Dec., or an author
burned all his uncompleted MS.
on the last day of the year, or if
all uncompleted, buildings had to
be pulled down bn the last day of
the year and started afresh, simply
as a matter of precedent, it is just
possible that the whole vast stu-
pidity of the business would begin
to become apparent. -
Judge Chomley (impressively) in Melb.
court the other day : “ I think the jury will very
likely not regard the witness’s evidence as very
valuable if he is a free-thinker!” Superstition
dies hard, even in fade of the most convincing
worldly experience.
At Cathkin station, Alexandra, Yic., a
sheep which, had not been fleeced for two years*
and whose Wool was therefore long, was being
shorn, when a big tiger-snake suddenly crawled
out of the fleece on to the board. Several half-
shorn sheep got away, one man cut his hand badly
with the shears, and most got a severe fright.
Wise is the race of Cohen. The Saltwater
River (Melb.), haunted of anglers, has lately been
horribly stenchful to fishers, and particularly
deadly to fish. The anglers complained and a
Stock department official went to enquire. He
found that on the banks of the Saltwater are the
pig-farms whence Melb. Christians derive the raw
material of their pork, ham and bacon; that the
pigs were fed on slaughterhouse offal, mostly
putrid and extensively maggot-filled ; that their
drinking-water is that of that awful “ noxious-
trade ” river ; that at the shore of their paddocks
the pigs had converted the banks into a filthy
wallow; and that stomach-ached pigs chose this
gluepot for suicide. He saw also that many of
these pig-farm swine looked “ very peculiar.’
Slain examples showed spleen and liver encased in
dropsical inflammatory cysts ; as for their lungs—
well, even the hardened stock-inspector stuck at
describing them. Thus prophesied Isaiah about
2500 years ago, of the Melbournites “ which eat
swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is
in their vessels.”
Zimmerman, called by Americans “ th e
Speed King,” and by Frenchmen “the Flying
Man ” says that one of his severest races was the
Springfield (Mass.) Handicap. Then he won the
dB2OO first prize by two or three lengths from
Windle, Tyler, Sarger, and Johnson. At Clifton,
Jersey, in ’93, Zim., giving Banker and Wheeler
25 yards in a mile handicap, and other of 68
starters up to 150 yards, won in 2min. 19sec.
Last year in Paris he won the mile handicap from
scratch; there were 28 starters, and Zim. had to
ride at his top the whole way on the outside. But
he won by eight yards in 2min. 9seo. In his races
he has generally made the pace throughout the
last quarter mile, while rivals tried in vain to
hang on; he has come in 10, 20, 40 yards
ahead of the best in that sprint. English cyclists
called Zim. a sprinter, and said he could not last
any distance worth mentioning. Zim. took up
that gauntlet, and won the five and forty-mile
championships from them. Things in cycling
England were quieter for him after that, and
quieter still after he had won 100 races in one
season there. In driving his machine, Zim. and
the machine are one; not an ounce of power is
lost, so precise are Zim.’s movements, and his
path is as straight as the arrow’s flight. He
claims to have considerably revolutionised cycle
construction, and says that his success is due to
the virtues of his machine. Cycle-riders every-
where have adopted Zim.’s innovations, and in
Australia they are shifting their saddles forward
h la Zim.
The Nimrod-Zimmy triplet was brought
from America by the speedy Zimmerman to teach
Australian cyclists the science of pacing, and to
aid them in lowering all previous Australian cycle
records. A triplet first came on American tracks
two years ago, and Zim. has been paced hy one
there over a hundred times. He has raced behind

ZIMMERMAN , Champion Cyclist.
this particular one some half-dozen times. Zim.
says that for 100 yards neither triplet nor tandem
can go faster than a single, but the tandem, with
its two riders, can last at top speed twice as far
as a single, and a triplet three or four times
further. Hence the triplet’s value as a pacer, and
its position, with the u quad, y as the favorite
American pace-maker. !
Mahomet, the talking stallion of Fitz-
gerald Bros.’ show, though tractable now as a
well-trained child, was at two years old an out-
law. He was (so goes the story) found in his
stable pawing the senseless body of his groom.
Mahomet was driven back with a pitchfork, but
the groom died shortly. Two months afterwards
(continues the story) Probasoo, who was born
within fifty feet of a stable-door and had taught
many horses circus work, went into Mahomet s
stall and had a desperate tussle. Probasco was
bitten on the hand, ear, chest, and back ; and one
of his teeth was knocked out by the horse striking
him —Mahomet meant that blow to settle Pro-
basco. But Probasco got Mahomet down and
was master. Eighteen months later saw Mahomet
winning first prize at Chicago for dancing and
rope-skipping. At the end of three years he could
unerringly perform the calculating trick. Now he
seems to have forgotten he is a horse at all he
never whinnies to other horses. He lives on oats,
bran-mash, and hay, and gets three miles walking
exercise per day. He hasn t had a morning
rehearsal for two years past. He has shown all
over Europe, America, and India, and he loves
arge audiences.

Melbourne lost a useful city councillor,

school at Sydney University. Mr. Russell has
long been resident in England, whither he retired
after the memorable dispute with his workmen
which resulted in his large engineering works
being shut up for ever at a few days’ notice.
Sydney University has now at its disposal for
special teaching purposes no less than £280,000,
but Mr. Russell, in making his splendid donation,
has expressed a hope that the gift will in po,way
prejudice the University’s claims to a continued

Gov. Brassey attended his first Masonic
shivoo in M«lb. last week. He was “made”

prior to his departure from England, with a view
to his becoming a Worshipful Master and other-
wise taking a prominent place in Yio. Masonic

Coroners, like Judges, consider it the
dignified thing not to know anything which isn’t
formally brought out in evidence. When the
Daore inquest was about halt through Mr. Woore,

spiration, and stopped the proceedings to inquire
if the deceased lady was an actress. Hearing that
she was, a great doubt was lifted from his mind
and the inquiry went on.
What caused the feeling in the recent row
about Vic. military precedence was the fact that
Templeton turned up at the headquarters office,

gun, or some other weapon of warfare. And
Hood had to go or be shot, and when he came

papers ascribed Parliamentary unveracity—a sort
of accusation about which politicians are not now
so thin-skinned as they once were—but whereas
Ward appealed to the law, M‘Oulloch had up
George for contempt' of Parliament, and actually
imprisoned him in the House for about three
weeks.
Dear Bulletin,—Re Huxley’s courtship.
T. P. O’Connor is not quite correct in his
details. Mv father, Charles Mark Palmer (for
the last 35 years of the Bank of N.S. Wales, and
for years its secretary) was, in 1850, a lieutenant
in H.M.S. Meander on this station. He ex-
changed into the Rattlesnake in which was
Assistant-Surgeon (afterwards Professor) Huxley.
My father joined the Rattlesnake here in Sydney
and sailed direct to England in her. His recol-
lection of Huxley is accentuated by the fact that
Huxley was the only man who ever pulled a tooth
out of his head.—Yours, W. H. Palmer, Sydney,
22nd Nov., ’95.

Pulsford, one of
Premier Reid’s recent
appointments, was the
only N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cillor who attended the

minus the shiny topper.

pepping timorously from

The reported retire-
ment of Dean Oowper
from active church work
in Sydney, now authori-
tatively denied, may be
taken as the shadow of
a near-at-hand event. A
man turned 85 may
strike work any day.
The old Dean has carried
an official soul through-
out the whole of his
long life, his pulse in-
variably beating with
v hat was respectable
and influential. Pro-
bably the 20 years he
spent in the service of
the Australian Agricul-
tural Co. —that 60-years-
ago precursor of the
current Northern Terri-
tory exploiting syndi-
cate —gave his mind the
secretarial character for
which it stands conspicu-
ous. It is a somewhat
singular family coinci-
dence that his father
and himself were suc-
cessively incumbents of
St. Philip’s on ChurSh
Hill, and that the father
at the age of 62, on pro-
posing to visit England,
was presented by his
flock with a purse of
.£7BO, while the son, at
the age of 65, on pro-
posing to take a similar
trip, was in like manner
presented with a purse
of £6OO.
Gov. Hampden hasn’t yet said that he will
stay in Australia for the full gubernatorial term.
Gov. Duff said so on the day he landed, and kept
repeating the statement almost till he died. Jersey
also gave it to be understood that five or seven
years would stand to his credit as Governor, but,
like poor Gov. Duff, he disappeared in about two.
Gov. Macquarie, who said he intended to stop
only twelve months, stayed longest of all—eleven
years.
Premier Reid’s voice is readily distinguish-
able through the tell-tale telephone. A day
before the Hampden reception struggle the wires
got tangled when he was speaking and published
interesting patches of Govt, policy. Quoth the
’phone: “Burr-r-rr! Yes. I shall be aboard the
Premier, and the other Ministers on the Burr-
rr.r_pop i Of course I shall bring his lordship
ashore with me.” Then : “ For God’s sake, ring
off, Georgy. You’ll choke.”
The most military Imperial officer who
ever hawed could not haw more objectionably
than a certain well-advertised Victorian native
military officer. And the most hee-haw johnnie
ever seen on or off the stage in Australia is a
N.S.W. professional man who has never been out
of the country in his life, and whose relatives are
refined and unpretentious people who open their
mouths and talk just as the Almighty probably
intended them to talk.
Arthur Dacre’s letters to his friend Elton,
written when he was awaiting at Naples instruc-
tions to sail for Melbourne, were quite painfully
high-pitched. “My God ! this suspense is ter-
rible !” he would write. Dacre looked at life
through a magnifying-glass. A medium-sized
misfortune was a gigantic calamity, a serious loss
was an overwhelming disaster, a man who crossed
him in business was an unrelenting foe. On the
other hand, a kindly acquaintance was a dear
friend, a pleasant experience a joy unutterable,
and a talented wife the most wonderful woman
under God’s heaven. Nobody spoice harshly of
Dacre, not even the people he came to loggerheads
with. The cold-blooded world has a sneaking
regard for enthusiasm.


How to Dress.
There is a great diversity of opinion on this im-
portant subject, and even such philosophers as the
great Carlyle have not deemed it unworthy of
their attention. Perhaps the suggestion that
when a lady is really well-dressed nobody notices
the details of her attire, is truest of all. In this
case absolute harmony of coloring and perfection
of fit must have been achieved. Messrs. Manning
and Co., of Collins-street, are now the most popu-
lar firm in Melbourne in this special department.
Their designers are the best artistes procurable,
and their materials the choicest. Hence the repu-
tation they have deservedly won in the Southern
city for dress and mantle making, millinery and
whitework, &o. Moderation in cost is also one of
the trade ethics of this firm. Costumes, for
example, are made (complete) in the best style
from Two Guineas. Their specialties in millinery,
beautifplly cut mantles, capes and blouses excite
much local admiration, and are now being sent to
all parts of Australia. Samples, estimates and
instructions for self-measurement will be gladly
sent anywhere on application. Orders to the
value of £5O and upwards are sent carriage free
and duty paid to any Australasian colony ; also
a discount of 2A per cent, is allowed for cash.
The address : —Manning and Co., The Block,
Collins-street, Melbourne.*
A PUZZLE.
Readers of The Bulletin in the country are often
puzzled to know where to send their orders, so
many drapery linns are advertising what they can
do, but few care much how orders are executed.
There seems to be a general idea that “anything
will do for the bush,” all forgetful of the fact that
ladies, even in the remotest backblocks, like to
have the latest styles and the freshest of goods.
Messrs. Riley Brothers, of 570 George-st., Sydney,
have for the past 30 years given special attention
to their Country Order Department, and know
intimately the requirements of every part of the
colony—North, South, or West. If the lady
readers of The Bulletin will look at this corner
of the paper every week they will see what we are
sending away every day. Gentlemen will find
articles for them in the corner of another page.

Sydney,
~ November 26, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The landing of Gov. Hampden last Thursday
naturally drew a big crowd, for Australians are
addicted to circuses, especially with lions—and
the V.R, cortege was all that. Besides, it was a
new departure to trail a live Gov. round the town
—officialdom usually reserves that sort of thing
until H.E. is dead, and can’t see how many offices
are to be let and how many banks are liquidating
up the side-streets. But the rule was broken for
Gov. Hampden, who was taken anything but a
short-cut to Guvmentouse, through layer-on-layer
of goggle-eyed, self-possessed sightseers, backed
by bunting and horsebed ferns at various spots en
route. I thought there was more tail than head
about the procession itself—all the interest cen-
tred in the new Governor’s barouche. In that
sacred vehicle—drawing attention from His Ex.
himself—was the most glaringly-dressed youth I
ever saw outside a circus. He was cherry-ripe
from head to heel with a criss-cross pattern of
gold lace, and his hat culminated in a wild whoop
of red feathers, suggestive of an Australian grass-
tree on fire. He really looked as if he had dressed
himself to frighten the blacks, on the debbil-debbil
principle.
Gov. Hampden struck me as being a somewhat
larky potentate. His smile is rather reminiscent
of the vacuous smirk of—well, a very well-adver-
tised person, still more or less before the public—
and he is a medium-sized, lightly-timbered
Governor, with a moustache like a well-kept
hedge and side-boards of grizzled hair. He smiled
perpetually as he passed along, and appeared to
take stock of the women on the balconies with the
eye of an expert. The best introduction Gov.
H ampden could have had was that Melb. Herald
print of him. After that, the original—who is
just an ordinary sort of plain man—comes quite
as a relief.
Lady Hampden accentuated her striking profile
by wearing her very fair hair crimped in bandeaux
—a style which is not intended for a face like Lady
Hampden’s. She should wear her hair piled high
over her forehead, unless she wants to make her
hereditary nose look like a bowsprit. Her Ex.
wore a black corded silk dress with a small black
bonnet trimmed with pink roses, and her lap was
covered with a huge bouquet of actinotus. Lady
Hampden, who bowed and smiled in the custom-
ary manner and looked about her in a politely
interested way, seems to be a very capable person-
age, who probably has a fad or two concealed
about her person which she would like to practise
on somebody, and who will not let the Guvment-
ouse clique over-manage her. The three vice-regal
girls wore simple white dresses with picturesquely
floral hats for the landing, and looked somewhat
out of countenance— owing to having been so stared
at, I suppose. They all appeared to droop under
the large eye of the public. A great many flowers
were left at Guvmentouse for the vice-regal ladies,
the tributes ranging from a huge basket of actino-
tus, tied with pale-blue ribbons, to a hurried-
looking bunch of Xmas-bush tied with strings.
But whether they came from society or the
florists’, the main idea was the same. All the
donors were after an ad.
There was a great deal of tail to the vice-regal
procession. Gazing on Sydney’s public men en
masse moving along in hired carriages—some of
which were obviously mourning-coaches split open
and trying to look festive—l couldn’t help think
ing what a pity it was that some great men don't)
keep good-looking and well-built understudies to
go out in purple and gold and tights and the rest
of it when duty calls’em to a circus-parade “by
the full strength of the company.” And if they
will star themselves, they might at least rehearse
their parts. I saw some of the scarlet-gowned
Judges—like so many Katishas—getting out of
their carriages with thejudicial petticoatinafright-
ful muddle. They should borrow a skirt from some
of their lady friends and put in some practice
beforehand if they can’t make a more elegant
descent than that. One often hears of limbs of
the law, but on these formal occasions one would
rather not see quite so much of them.
The military certainly made a great show in the
procession, and if “Uncle” Hutton has done
nothing else he has certainly polished up his
army until it is really as bright as a button. If
we must have this sort of pretoy paper frill about
our peaceful Australian civilisation, it’s just as
well to have it clean and combed-up, and I only
hope when the General goes in March that there
won’t be a great sartorial backsliding. On dit
that Colonel Spalding is the politically anointed
to take Major-General Hutton’s post as Com-
mandant.
I hear that Gov. Hampden did not make him-
self severely popular on the voyage out. He was
amiable to all sorts, and he played ship’s quoits
and billiards, losing more games than he won, but
he did not obtrude himself, and impressed his
fellow passengers as a personage who longed to go
through life in carpet slippers. When he was
invited ashore at Adelaide he meekly remon-
strated against the bother of the whole thing, but
he went, all the same, which is a point in his favor.
He also retired to bed at a very early hour all
through the voyage, though Miss Alice Leamar
came out by the same tub, and used to give ’em
“ Whackey Whack ” in the small hours. Now,
Gov. Hampden looks like a man who wouldn’t
miss “ Whackey Whack ” on any account, if left
to himself, and his early retirement, under the
circumstances, to his cradle on the deep looks as
if Lady Hampden’s fad is Home Rule, don’t you
think? It was not a festive trip over—except for
the stewards. Of the .£7O subscribed for amuse-
ments only half was spent, and the rest divided
among the knights of the basin. The Gov.
didn’t have an enlivening effect, evidently, and it
was a great disappointment when he turned up at
the fancy-dress ball in evemng-dress.
The engagement is announced of Miss Maud
Roberts—one of Sydney's prettiest girls—to Mr.
Stanley Mylins, an English artist of repute. The
is arr.anged for February, after which
the principal parties m it will leave for England
and a tour round the world. Miss Roberts has
quite recovered from the severe horse-accident she
met with a few months ago.
Gov. Hampden’s first visit to Sydney Lyceum
led to a great rush of good-looking decorations to
the front—all four stage-boxes being draped in the
Union Jack and adorned with potted plants tied
up in scarlet as if they had a toothache ; while
the profusion of bouquets on both sides of the
house looked as if the management expected a
boarding-school. In the centre of the do. a thing
like a huge green caterpillar and more Union Jack
testified to the joy of the occasion, and the
Lyceum marble stairway blossomed like Aaron’s
rod in honor of H. 8., who arrived with punctu-
ality. It was a disappointment to the gaping
brigade that the V.R. party weren’t set out like
prize shorthorns in the middle of the. d.c. ; but
Gov. Hampden admirably did his part (as a per-
sonally-conducted show) —changing his seat several
times to give all the opera-glasses a chance, and
walking round the circle ’tween acts to visit
ex-Actmg-Gov. Darley, who squired a covey of
daughters, one of whom, in Japanese mourning,
looked as if she deplored the family’s fall from
grace. Seen at short range, Gov. Hampden is a
tall, slight personage with an indolent style and a
graceful manner of walking. He is quite bald
enough to justify his position in the front row on
all occasions, and he has a most elegant way of
scratching himself behind the ear with his little
finger. He wore evening-dress with no bouton-
niere—-a tip for the johnnies—and carried.his white
gloves in his hand. Both he and Lady H. use
pince-nez when struggling with print.
Lady Hampden, who appeared to be somewhat
disconcerted by the owl-like opera-glasses of a
very third-rate d.c.—her Ex. isn’t half as cool
under a fire of eyes as the Gov.— wore a grand-
motherly gown of black silk made high and with
long sleeves, and what really looked like a cap on
her head. This will fetch all the matrons out in
head-dresses, no doubt, though the Sydney house-
mother is not addicted to capping herself, no
matter how broad her parting is - perhaps because
she looks so cooky-tied that way? Her Ex.
tried to hide behind her programme and her
bouquet to get away from the battery of eyes, and
at last changed her seat and retired behind the
curtain for the rest of the evening. A Governor’s
wife who objects to be rudely stared at has a
very hard row to hoe.
The two vice-regal damsels wore white silk
gowns with huge sleeves, and their light-brown
hair very pleasantly dressed. They are pretty
girls with the usual well - broken-in appearance
peculiar to English maidenhood, and they both
looked as if they would want very safe mounts
indeed. The Hampden suite (five in all) look
young and frisky ; with Family Herald legs, for
the most part; and blondehairimmaoulatelyparted.
They all have nice, pink complexions which many
a Sydney girl would like to find in her own mirror,
and, taking them en masse, they appear to be
thoughtfully christened. “Freddy,” “Cecil,”
“ Algy,” and “Francis ” are the Christian names
of four of the staff, and I really must say they
look it.
The play—that old and hoary American horror,
“ Power of the Press,” under the new title of the
“ Carson Case ” —was certainly not the thing of
the occasion. There was no dressing on the stage,
and the local scenery was the only enthusiasm.
It is strange to hear people wildly cheering the
appearance of the G.P.O. when they pass the real
thing every day of their lives without looking at
it, much less saying “ hooray ; ” and it was a still
more unaccountable thing to hear the enthusiasm
with which a set of Darlinghurst gaol was greeted
by the enraptured gods. A stranger might have
mistaken it for a popular boarding-house, it got
such a cordial “hand.” Really, the most soothing
thing in a singularly bleak performance was the
music supplied by the orchestra between the acts.
A feature ot interest in the Lyceum d.c. on
V.R. night was “Zun.” and his bear-leader. I
think the evils of over-cycling are written large on
the ’Melican wheelist, who has the stoop of an
old man, and the concentrated, heavy expression
which comes from biking, so they say. I thought
I detected several physical aids to fame about
Zim. For one thing, he has loosely-hung ears
which would lead to no small increase of impetus
if the wind got behind them at a hot finish, and
then he has a long, thin neck, which is another
advantage where people win by an eyelash very
often. And this long neck gives Zim. an oppor-
tunity in private life for wearing a most elongated
collar—the nearest approach 1 have ever seen to
it is the tin collar they sometimes put on refrac-
tory goats. I hope this isn’t blasphemy.
The final bicycle championship meeting at Syd-
ney Association-ground, last Saturday, drew a
tremendous crowd, and would have made up into
an imposing show if it hadn’t come on to rain.
The V.R.-box, in the centre of the stand, was
rather cautiously‘draped with “jack,” as if the
management were anxious not to overdo it, and
you couldn’t see how the lawn was looking for the
press of people. But the rain spoilt everything,
and the spectacle of soaked champions, with their
silk clinging to their biceps, tearing round in the
mud while a damp crowd shook its glistening
umbrellas at them, was enough to set one sneez-
ing. In the ladies’ stand, rows of foolish women
sat out in the rain and soaked, while the wise
virgins who couldn’t get a seat on the stand just
sniffed contemptuously at the bad management of
Jupiter Pluvius, opened their umbrellas viciously,
and went straight home again. Gov. Hampden
and the hon. Misses Margaret and Alice Brand
were the V.R. gaping-stocks on this occasion.
Acting vice-royalties—who occasionally put on
more frill than the genuine sort, just as an
amateur actress generally sports more paint than
does a professional—have been having a harassing
time all over Australia, lately—with so many new
Governors coming and showing the candle in the
turnip, so to speak. Really, acting-vice-regal
people have a distressing time, taking it
altogether. For an uncertain period they are
kow-towed to and run after ; they learn to enter
public buildings stepping in time to the Anathema,
and they leave off providing their own bouquets
or rushing to reserve front seats ; and then, at a
blow, as the French say, the whole situation
stands on its head—the new star arrives and they
fade away to rushlights.
I am sure the ladies in the case must have a
twinge under the circumstances—indeed, I have
seen them throwing mournful, Peri-outside-Para-
dise kind of glances at the vice-regal box in which
they once held sway, but which knows them no
more, and I am quite sure that many an ousted
acting-governoress, when she hands the incoming
real Jamaica Madame the stereotyped bunch of
flowers on the threshold of Government House,
would very often much rather hand her a bunch
of scorpions. For even acting-governoresses are
human, and I have never met a woman yet who
could take pleasure in being deposed.
The great gathering of the clans “ to meet Card.
Moran and the hierarchy of Australia,” at Sydney
Town Hall, on last Monday evening, was most
successful, with Gov. Hampden discovered on a
dazzling dais, all draped and festooned with
“jack” and lavish decorations of jamias and
hydrangea all round the galleries. Meat and
drink were lavishly laid on in the vestibule, and
VViegand at the organ filled up the gaps. I
thought the reception looked as if the Union ot
Christendom was a settled thing—socially, at all
events—for all sorts of people were there. Gov.
Hampden was accompanied by one pretty
daughter, in white silk (do the V.R. girls always
wear white silk?), who was chaperoned by the aet-
ing-Governoress, whose very decollete black silk
probably accounted for Card. Moran not figuring
prominently on the dais. I believe that His
Eminence will not hold parley with the V-shaped,
and once when a Governor’s wife in evening dress
removed her wrap while conversing with him the
Card, immediately bowed and left her. So most
of the people had a tucker in their frocks, and
many came with their dresses tickling their ears—
but Society won by a neck, as usual, and there
were really a good many handsome modern
editions of Mother Eve’s fig-leaves on tap
The many priests—some in their “ fariola,” the
botanical name for a clerical garb which only
wants a frill of lace and a dart or two to make a
novel and rather melting tea-gown—gave pictur-
esqueness to the huge crowd, and the Cardinal’s
scarlet robes lent the necessary warmth. Every-
thing was abnormally full fig. Every man who
had a brass collar came out with it on, and even
the women tried to look official. One very portly
consuless in black sported a maroon and cream
sash over her shoulder, and tied at the side —
giving her rather the appearance of a welter-
weight jockey or a Mason at a funeral.
The dressing generally was very good. Lady
Innes wore pompadour brocade; Mrs. Eddy looked
well in salmon-pink ; Mrs. Scot-Skirving was in
white brocade and chiffon ; and Mrs. James Allison
(Miss Burdekin) in eau-de-nil, with a very tricky
bodice, and diamond flowers in her hair. There
really were many unobjectionable gowns, so I
forgave a fat lady dressed in wall-paper, also a
sprinkling of females in bonnets, who must have
had bald heads underneath, or they would cer-
tainly have taken them off—l mean the bonnets—
when they saw how the evening was wagging.
The new Gov would seem to be starring in the
title rble. All the consuls—under the wing of
Mens. Biard d’Aunet, Consul-General of France—
called at Guvmentouse recently, and, although
they were all photographed, with his Ex. in the
centre, at the conclusion of the visit—still they all
came away enchanted with the goings-on of the
Brand new household.
SAPPHO SMITH.
“In England the most conspicuous edifices
you see, approaching a town, are steeples. In
America, they are centres of intelligence.”—
Huxley.
A kindly-disposed Melbourne pastrycook
who twice a week distributed to the needy all his
broken and spoilt pastry, has been compelled to
give up the practice because of the tremendous
rush of applicants. The rush for the “ spoils.”
Victoria, with 73 medical men for every
100,000 of population, has the second best record
for number in the world, beating Europe hollow.
But England has a doctor to every four sq. miles,
whereas Victoria only has one to every 105 miles.
Jewish veterans of the German army, to
the number of 500, gathered in a Berlin cemetery
in connection with this year’s celebration of
Sedan. This had considerable significance,' be-
cause of the anti-Semitic agitation, and the rabbis
who spoke enlarged on the fallacy of supposing
that the Jews stood apart from the defence of the
country. Nevertheless, the newspapers of the
other side returned to the charge with extra
fervor, showing the paucity of Jewish officers.
The Bulletin Christmas Number will
this year be published Dec. 12. It is a hard
matter to outdo previous Bulletin Christmas
Numbers in point of interest and variety, but if
that feat can be achieved it will be achieved on
Deo._ 12. The letterpress and illustrations are of
particularly high literary and artistic value, and
promise to move the great soul of the community
as that organ has rarely been moved before. The
price, as usual, is 7d. post free from this office to
any address ; and wholesale agents must positively
send in orders at once to ensure full supply.
The Phillip Ward (Sydney) aldermanic
contest presents a somewhat curious aspect.
Alderman Johnston (a native Australian and 17-
years’ Sydney resident), who has represented the
ward for the past 12 months with vigour and
credit, is opposed by Mr. Sam Bowen, whose recom-
mendations for the control of municipal affairs
appear to lie in the facts that he is a popular
young man and a very good tailor. The one point
alleged, singularly enough, against Mr. John-
ston’s candidature is the vote which he gave
for temporarily reducing some municipal wages
by 4d. a day—when the alternative was blank dis-
missal. The Council preferred to dismiss 96 men
altogether rather than reduce the wages of all by
a small amount for a short time—an unwise and
unfair action, as it appears to The Bulletin.
This paper, therefore, is quite unable to see why
the ratepayers should prefer a young man with no
apparent municipal merits to a tried aldermen of
sound business capacity and good democratic
record.
From “ Memoirs of a Cadet ” :
One evening as our party (in India) were strolling on
shore, after the day’s journey, we observed a native of
most filthy appearance engaged in what appeared to us a
very extraordinary process. He repeatedly laid himself
on the ground at full length, making, at the same time,
a mark in the sand close to the crown of his head ; then,
rising, he placed his feet by the said mark, and lay down
again as before. This process he might continue ad
infinitum, for aught we know, as we saw no end to it,
and each successive prostration gaining one length of his
body (o the southward. We addressed him and inquired
his objects. He returned us no answer ; nor did he
appear to notice us, vl e then made the same inquiry of
some natives, who were also watching him, not with
curiosity like ourselves, but with the most profound
respect and reverence. He was a devout fakeler on his
pilgrimage to Juggernaut, whither he was making his
way in the manner described —namely, measuring; the
whole distance by the length of his body. He had
already thus travelled more than 300 miles ; and had 400
miles to go.”
Hodges, J. (loquitur):
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You have heard of the pleasant Sabbatical
Afterpoons spent by the Just;
Where religion’s expounded, fanatical,
And all sorts of topics discussed ;
Where we fight against all devil’s dodges
And Judges make statements so odd,
You’ve not yet heard God upon Hodges
But you’ve heard Justice Hodges on God.
Williams, J. is a bit atheistical,
A Beckett’s religion’s no good,
The Chief is proud, vain, egotistical,
Poor lost souls are Holroyd and Hood,
But I am the Judge of the Judges,
Their frail little foibles I prod,
Human weakness to my mind mere fudge is,
So I angrily criticise God.
. When the floodgates of Heaven are locked up
And the Lord for men’s sins sends a drought,
And horses and cattle are knocked up,
Why ! God doesn’t know what He’s about.
If Hh don’t send the rain when I ask it,
If He don’t let the showers begin,
Still I feel I’m “the pick of the basket ”
And God’s only a fiend with a grin.
I think nothing of tearing my Bible
If God doesn’t answer my prayer
When I ask Him to send to my kiddies
Enough for the day and to spare.
I’ve a temper that’s simply seraphic,
And when I’m laid under the sod
I’m sure there’ll be nothing more graphic
Than Hodges, J.’s judgment on God.

Keogh & Allard and Gemmell, Tuckett & Co. (conjointly)
Have been Instructed to OFFER BY AUCTION, on the above date, A NUMBER OF
Properties in the City and all Suburbs,
Payment for which will be accepted in Deposit Receipts in the St. James Building Society, at the
PACE ■VALXJE.
These properties are of an exceptionally superior class, and are, without doubt, the beat that have
been placed upon the market purchasable in this manner, and, the auctioneers confidently assert, are
well worth reserves placed upon them. They therefore invite the attention of depositors and others
to the properties, and will give every information to intending purchasers upon application.
Depositors unable to be present at the auction personally can appoint agents to act for them.
NOTE.—The experience of similar sales proves that the depositors who buy at the first oppor-
tunity are those who reap the greatest advantage from this system of disposing of properties, as they
invariably get interest on their investments which amply repays them.
Catalogues are now being prepared, and when completed will be forwarded to every depositor.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under (he brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. 0. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THZRZEIE CASTLES” and ££ C-A-IPSTLAEsT. 7 '
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “ Capstan" Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Mr. E. P. Dawbarn, of Sydney, claims the
credit of discovering the real character of the
woman Lennox, for an alleged assault upon whom
Buttner was to have been hanged, at Sydney, a
year or two ago. “Being in Brisbane,” writes
Mr. Dawbarn, “ I discovered the real character
of the woman. Returned to Sydney and saw the
Minister for Justice, who at once sent to Brisbane
for all particulars, with the result as known.
The officials in Brisbane expressed surprise to me
that no enquiry had been made locally concerning
the girl’s character. She had been an inmate of
Woogaroo lunatic asylum, where I first heard of
her."

Tlie latest thing out—the New Woman
with the latch-key.
The time-honored “ sickening thud ” of
Melb. evening-paper execution-reports is defunct.
Melb. Hekald concluded the Emma Williams
“hanging” with “ A convulsive cry ! ” And its
loathsome contemporary’s version was “ A chok-
ing gasp 1 ”
“ Jack the Ripper ” is now confined in an
English lunatic asylum. He is a religious maniac,
who conceived that God had ordered him to blot
immoral women out of the world ; and it was his
practice, during the time he was committing his
murders, to attend St. Paul’s Cathedral every
morning and give thanks unto Heaven for the
success which had attended his mission. “The
church has never built asylums enough to hold the
insane of its own making. It has shed more blood
than light. It has made more orphans than it
has fed.”
Spagnoletti : “ What makes the trade of
religion stink in the world’s nostrils is that it is a
gate-money business. Hardly has the Melb.
public done laughing over the preposterous folly
of the Y.M.C.A., with its “suitable” saintly
guinea crowd to see Brassey, than the hocus-pocus
about General Booth arouses equal contempt.
He comes to Melbourne. Of course, he is eager
to greet the * soldiery,’ and weeps with joy at the
thought. Of course, they are eager to see him,
and swarm at the wharf. But this won’t do at
all. The most strenuous efforts are made in vain
to keep the ignorant Salvationists in the dark,
and shuffle him through incognito. He keeps
under hatches, then rushes out into his cab at the
last moment. Anyone would think it was Bar-
num’s Gyascutis, with the fuglemen swarming
round to take care nobody sees him. Why don’t
they fetch him ashore in a coffin, or in a barrel,
or the big violoncello, or big drum ? But, mind
you, there’s to be the mighty welcome, when he
really comes. Booth, Jehovah and Co. ! ”
Judge Williams, soon after his promotion
to the Vic. Bench, had a startling experience of
the difference between real facts and police per-
versions of them. A woman of indifferent repute
was charged with purloining jewellery—a scarf-
pin, or something—from a man, late at night, in a
Melbourne street. Constable deposed that the
prosecutor having got into a bit of a brawl,
emerged with the complaint that his scarf-pin
was gone. Thereupon he (the constable) arrested
this woman, who was there or thereabouts,_ and
charged her with the crime, which she admitted,
saying “ I robbed the man.” It was an unanswer-
able case, on the face of it, and the woman seemed
doomed to at least a couple of years’ hard labor.
Yet his Honor was not satisfied of her guilt. He
asked the constable whether anyone could endorse
his story of the candid confession. Constable
stated that some man, whom he didn’t know,
must have overheard the words, but unfortunately
the desirable witness disappeared without leaving
his name and address. There seemed no chance
for the prisoner to escape conviction. The judge
was about to sum up when a man came forward
and asked to be sworn. He was, as it appeared,
the man who overheard the alleged confession,
and he, had come to express a disinterested belief
in the woman’s innocence. She did speak the
words proved against her, but not in the sense
attributed to them by the policeman. When
charged with the theft she had shown much
astonishment, and her answer was “ I robbed the
man ! ” with a heavy accent on the personal pro-
noun. The active and intelligent officer’s
evidence collapsed into dust and ashes, and the
undefended female was presently discharged with-
out any further stain on her character.

"Daore was Roselle’s evil genius.”— Melb. paper.
Amy Roselle’s father was a Jewish schoolmaster.
When Daore heard of H. B. Conway’s recent attempted
suicide he said it was very foolish.
Amy Fawsitt, original heroine of the “ Two Roses,”
was Amy Roselle’s rival in youth, and perished miserably
in a New York tenement house, not without suspicions of
foul play.
Ed. Bulletin, —Some of Mr. Tapley's marmalading
acquaintances are trying to find a grievance in the fact
that the end of his engagement with W. and M. wasn’t
announced by a flourish of trumpets, and a benefit. There
were no trumpets or benefit in the bond, presumably.
This engagement, like others of equal importance, died a
natural death, and Tapley, for his part, passed away with
a peaceful smile on his face. The last member of the
opera co. on whom the Finn thrust a gratuitous benefit
was Ryley, as far as I remember. That was years ago,
when Ryley had not been very long with them, and his
popularity was at its meridian. —Melb.
The Firm s new man, Court,ice Pounds, is not being run
for all he is worth at the start of his engagement, and so
will improve on acquaintance. Tapley and Brownlow’
were fired off on the rocket principle. Tapley, as the
curate in ‘‘Vicar of Bray,” gave the first impression that
he might be an exceedingly clever character-actor, but
the public soon found that the goody-goody part of Sand-
ford played Tapley, whose young-curate manner was pro-
bably born in him. So with Brownlow. He belongs to
the heavy, romantic class of baritones, and as the royal
bearded masher of “ Ma Mie Rosette ” he displayed all of
his stage effects to the very best advantage. Here again
the character played the actor, so to speak, by adapting
itself to his marked mannerisms.
It was just after the death of her son, aged about six
years, that Amy Roselle made her great hit as Constance
in “ King John.”
Paradis; “What is the use of mincing the matter’
Amy Roselle was too old. The drama is not the hurdy-
gurdy of yore. It is as S“rious a pursuit as any. The
actress is necessarily short-lived 'professionally), like the
cricketer, cycler, jockey, or racehorse, for the matter of
that. Is this a hardship? No, indeed. The wages are
immense. They can make as much in ten years as they
used to do in a lifetime, and so will have to make up their
minds that their lifetime is ten years, and act the ant
accordingly.”
D-ar Bulletin,—Who saj's that Amv Roselle “ wasn’t
seen at anything like her best in Australia?” Probably
a Sydney writer. She may have lost heart after the
disastrous season here, but Melbourne certainly got some
very fine work from the talented lady in “A Wife’s
Ordeal,” and one or two other plays. Her “Rizpah”
monologue, too, was about the strongest bit of tragic
acting achieved by any English artist in Melbourne during
the last dozen years.—Yarra-Yarra.
“In their death they were not divided.”—2 Samuel 1
23. Most people fancy it’s Shakespere.
The hardest thing about the Dacre tragedy is the
people who insist on hanging their little advt. on the
coffins of the dead actor and actress. The following letter
by Lewis Scott in S.M. Herald is a case in point:—
“I should like to dispel any impression that Mr. Arthur
Dacre was being unduly burdened by the part of Dean
Maitland. He had six days in which to study it. It was
a part fed by every other, and any of our leading
juveniles, such as Scot Inglis, H. R. Roberts, Cvril
Keightley, or Harry Plimmer, could have mastered it in
three days. In fact, I offered on Saturday night
to study it and play it on Monday; but, of
course, I had a large superficial knowledge of the
whole play. Mr. Dacre asked me to see the manage-
ment, and have him relieved of all worry about cos-
tume, and some uncertainty which had arisen about his
contract. All this was done. On Saturday night, about 10,
he told me he was all right, that he would make a big hit
on Monday, and that he and I would take the play to
London, where he had lots of rich friends to finance its
production. He asked me to dine with them at ion
Monday, dress there, and go to the theatre. Mrs. Dacre
was, she said, in love with her part, and felt she should
have the sympathy of the audience all through. But
they were both mentally and bodily unwell, and when I
told Daore to cut whatever delayed the story in his part,
he smiled, and said he wouldn’t cut a line, he liked it all,’’
&c. Herein Mr. Scott (whom the general public only
know as an ex-civil-servant) manages to convey that he is
an actor of much ability, and capable of taking an im-
portant leading character at the shortest notice. Also,
that though the four “leading juveniles” in question
could learn the part in three days, he could do it in two.
Also, that Mr. and Mrs. Daore, who should have been
among the very best judges in Australia, were full of
admiration for Mr. Scott’s play, and Mr. Dacre reckoned
it good enough to boom in London. Which is a good deal
of advertisement to hang on to the simple statement that
the deceased actor wasn’t quite so tired as people sup-
posed.
A curious trait that Amy Roselle should fear a dangerous
operation and not death. And how singularly prophetic
the finale of Esther Sandraz !
After all, few Thespians suicide. In Australia, offhand,
one recalls Mdlle. St. Denis, basso De Haga, and baritone
Templeton. We have to go abroad for Montgomery.
Melb. : " Phil. Stuart, of the Bijou, has been greatly
heckled over the Dacre affair, but he is surely b ameless.
Dacre insisted on opening -with ‘A Wife’s Ordeal,’ while
Stuart wanted “Esther Sandraz,’ which would have struck
the best blow possible. Stuart entered on the affair with
enthusiasm, and for months previous told everyone what
a trump-card he had in hand. Surely he got as good
people as could he had, Elton, Shine, Gates, &c., while
the ladies were of Dacre’s own choice.”
The fracas between a prominent and heavyweight
Thespian and a certain theatrical agent is the principal
gossip at Melb. “ Poverty Point ” just now. Briefly put:
the agent neglected to observe the spirit of de mortuis
nil nisi bonum, and the Thespian instructed him to
better manners with a hard and heavy fist. G. Rignold
was the heavy Thespian.
“ I hate appearing in tights.”—Miss Juliet Wray to a
Melbourne interviewer—
Don’t fret about that matter, Ju.,
Most slender of the lasses—
Remember when in tights that you

With magnifying-glasses.
Clever acrobat Dan Feeley, of Fillis’s circus, has, every-
one will regret to hear, been crippled for life in South
Africa. He rose from a sick bed to show at a benefit to
Fillis, and, when doing his leap over 30 fixed bayonets,
one of them pierced his leg just below the knee. Mortifi-
cation compelled amputation.
Miss Annis Montague (Mrs. Charles Turner) left per
American mail for Honolulu, where her brother, Mr.
Cook, a wealthy Hawaiian planter, has prepared a house
for her reception.
Showman: "The cardinal mistake in Booth’s Melb.
circus-procession was showing him to the people, which
spoilt the gat j -money. I would have put him in a cara-
van, with a hole on top, through which he might twiddle
the belltopper on a stick. The show is getting sadly
deficient in the ground-and-lofty tumbling, and the
patter. Where’s the one-eyed prophetess, the glory
cobbler, hallelujah knightman, saved gutter-snipe, and ail
the old stars? They used to declaim against the stove-pipe
hats and spike-tail coats which now rule the roast. It’s
just like the new banks. Started to meet a felt want
and help the struggling trader, -they drop into the swim
with the cook salmon of the big accounts. Booth, on a
dunghill, is a mighty power. Traversing Melbourne in a
superb carriage and pair, he is a mixture of Davies and
Kennedy, with a spice of Coppin.”
For weeks past the only theatrical shows in Adelaide
nave been two weak variety co’s. When a discerning
manager with cash and a good 00. strikes Adelaide he
will coin money.
A certain mesmerist met with one nasty experience.
A young man, who had been put “under the influence,”
was benevolently punished by his friends afterwards with
a description of the asinine figure he cut while fishing off
a chair and singing hymns, etc. The boy got mad, and
went on the stage next night full of antagonistic resist-
ance. He pretended to “go off” as usual, and when the
professor” commanded him to “hit me,” he did, and
continued the pummelling till the Prof, had to flee to his
dressmgroom. The audience enjoyed the show hugely,
but the mesmerist has omitted that item from his bill
ever since.
While in Sydney old Sophia, the Maori guide to the
Hot Lakes, visited a curiosity shop and tried to buy an
ancient war canoe paddle to which some legend.iry inter-
est attached. The price asked was beyond the old Maori’s
means, and, after examining the relic with the keenest
interest, she sadly returned it to the shopkeeper.
The first lady-cyclist has arrived in the far West. When
Ada Delroy and co. arrived at Bourke railway-station she
mounted a bike and vanished out of sight. “A woman
on a cycle 1 it spread like wildfire. Men and women
with plates and dishcloths, flatirons, and shaving-brushes
still in their hands rushed madly down the street to see
the marvellous sight. The Dean case is dead—stone-dead
in Bourke. The woman on the bike has taken its place.
The Calculating Boy, at present touring Australia, is a
son of the “Georgia Magnet,” famous in the London halls
a few years back. Johnny, his pa and the Magnet are now
residing in Robe-st., St. Kilda. where the little lady’s
(private) exhibitions occasionally startle guests at her
residence.
A practical assault on Beelzebub by Gen. Booth and the
Salvation Harmy in Sydney, last week, was a midnight
prayer-meeting held specially for “frequenters of public-
houses, theatres and music-halls,” who were besought, in
placards, to “ Come, drunk or sober.” The Harmy thus
indiscriminately bunches together show-goers and grog-
bibbers.
The World (London) calls Melba one of the greatest
singers and the poorest actresses of the time. “It is
quite uncanny to hear her singing like an angel, and to see
her acting like a qiechanical doll.”
Decima.Moore left by mail for England on Saturday
u-’ u u ec '* Hope goes to Westralia to seek that fortune
which he certainly will never pick up on the stage.
One of Dacre’s bitter drops was Willard being sub-
stituted for him in the original run of “Jim the Penman.”
Pro.: “ Azapl, the Prodigal Son, as acted by Brooke
under Coppin’s management, is a well-known spectacle,
originally produced by James Anderson at Drury Lane,
and is taken from Auber’s opera of a similar name.”
A yarn goes round to the effect that our old friend Sass
is superintending the setting up of a new theatre at
Johannesburg, to cost £'40,000. A man who knows some-
thing about such South African matters, says that the
new theatre aforesaid is on the stocks, and is estimated
to cost £15,000, whether Sass superintends the building
of it or not. In theatrical circles, just now, there is a
tendency to represent George Edwardes and his relatives
(S iss is G. E’s brother-in-law) as being about to manage
the Entire Universe.
Pro. : “The only absolutely indefeasible teetotaller I

Alfred Moule, erst Melb. Age critic, now manages

In the theatre. Old gentleman: “Excuse me, madam,
I paid half-a-crown for admission, but cannot see anything

ten times as much for my hat.”
One soulful Melb. black-and-white artist has amongst
his studio treasures three squares of carpet, by which he
sets a priceless stole. He will tell you “with entranced
eye’’that they came from the departed Gee-Gees’dressing-
rooms, and that the dainty (and probably bare) feet of
Grace and Maud have pressed their velvety pile. The
fortunate possessor nightly kneels reverently upon each
in turn, and says the little prayer that all good artists
aay.
One night, at the old Dublin Queen’s, “ Othello ” was
on, and the audience was spell-bound by the realistic
way in which the Moor was bolstering his wife. After a
terrific struggle Desdemona got away, rushed down to
the footlights, and exclaimed: “Good God! what a
narrow escape I’ve had 1 The drunken brute really in-
tended to finish me."
Melb.: “Seeing young George Coppin act, at a sub-
urban fit-up last night, I thought he must be a replica of
his father when first in this city.”

Vet: The usual remedy for a shying horse is the
whip—about the worse thing in many cases. Many shy
through some eye-trouble, such as short-sight or cataract,
which prevents the horse seeing an object till he is close
to it and thinks he is right on it. A blind horse never
shies, because he never sees anything. What’s the good
of the whip in a case of cataract ? When a sound horse
shies at anything, lead him slowly up to it, so that he
may see it close and know it is harmless. Gibers again
sutler from nerves. You don't whip a nervous woman—
at least not in public.

Recent researches into the records of birth of
16,000 foals show that 97 colts are born for every 100
fillies ; that up to the end of the third month of gestation
the foetus is sexless; that the sex is determined by the
bodily condition of the mother in the fourth and fifth
month ; that if the mare, and therefore the foetus, be
well-nourished, the sex is most likely to he female. The
age of the stallion seems to have no effect on the sex of
the foal, but an old mare, being less strong than a
younger one, is likely to drop a colt. Summed up, the
facts seem to mean—healthy mares in their prime with
abundant food will most likely drop fillies; old or ill-fed
or unhealthy mares will mostlikely drop colts.

For the last six months Ikey Mo’s Melbourne
weekly has been grinding out yarns under the head of
“Systems of Betting, or Battling with the Books.” It
goes without saying that the object is to lure punters
away from the Tote system, in which there are no bookies
to battle with.

Bob Sevier “Sutton,” the onetime cash book-
maker who pasted Lord Beerthirst in a Melbourne pub.,
seems to be turning his marriage with a marquis’s daughter
to some account. His noble bride borrows money from a
London usurer, and husband Robert, who is an uncertifl-
oated insolvent, is charged with having gone security in
the capacity of bloated capitalist. The money-lender’s
namj is Samuels, too. Fancy Samuels being had by
Robert Sutton Sevier?

George Bubear, who played an up-and-down
game with poor old Hanlan at a Texas regatta last week,
threatens Do come over to Australia anon. He and his
English mates may possibly want to have a cut at one or
two of our men, he says, but it Bubear should arrive it
will be found that he doesn’t dream of cutting high. He
was here some years ago, and his prudence in selecting
suitable “marks” was most praiseworthy. As second-
rate scullers go, Bubear is a wise man.

In the Melbourne lawn-tennis tournament, last
week, four N.S.VV. men and half-a-dozen Victorians com-
peted for the single championship. In the first round,
VVindeyer (N.S.VV.) wiped out Fox (N.S.W.), and Rice
(N.S. VV.) wiped out Irving (Vic.), whilst the other N.S. W.
man and live .of the Vies, stood, out of the round alto-
gether. Then, in round No. 2, a couple of the Vies, were
vanquished by their own countrymen, and the fifth went
down before Rice. Also, VVindeyer appeared again and
wiped out the other N.S.VV. mao, wiio hadn’t played in
the first round. Therefore, Rice and VVindeyer had to
win two games each before arriving at round No. 3, hut
the remaining pair of Vies, got there on the strength of
only one win eich. And, whereas a couple of Vies, were
hound to be left in the third round, Rice ran a double
risk of getting defeated by a Vic., in which case only
Windeyer, from N.S.VV., would have remained, along with
three Vies., for tlie final ties. A lawn-tennis tournament
moves in what seems a mysterious way to the outsider.
Regarded as an interprovincial event its conduct is most
unsportsmanlike. The tournament was almost as un-
interprovincial as possible in the first two rounds, and all
its eccentricity favored the local men.

The Boston (U.S.) Police News makes some
remarks about Griffo; “Nobody in America would be
likely, I think, to cry himself into a decline over young
Griffo’s announced purpose to ‘soon return to Australia.’
The spirit of the imp of all hoodlum darkness was never,
I believe, quite so strong in any of the errant race of
fighters as it is in Griffo. He is the sancho and the star
sewer-rat of the sparring profession. He has been em-
broiled about all the time with somebody, and is seem-
ingly a helpless prey to his low propensities. Drink don’t
change Griffo for the worse, as it did Sullivan, because
Griffo is at nit times a ‘ m ice,’and destitute utterly of
regard for what he pledges himself to in order to obtain
money. I don't know how many ambitious managers
have had ‘ Griffo under contract. He will sign with any
man for anything, providing he receives a cash-iu-hand
advance. Personally, lie has run himself out wherever he
has been a little while known. People who think highly
of him as the greatest nonesuch of scienoed boxers don’t
want to meet him or talk with him, and will run around
the corner if they see him coming. The hostility of all
the police authorities in and about New York to Griffo is,
for good reason, decided and deep-rooted. Such as he is
unfortunately intensify the prejudices of the community
against all pugilists and sparrers. The chances of the
class for livelihood are pulled down by the ways in which
he outrages public decency and makes himself an element
of disorder. There will surely be a sigh of relief in
America if Griffo changes ids residence back to his own
country. His matchless and masterly cleverness in hand-
ling himself as an exponent of the ‘ manly art ’ is the one
solitary thing about him that can be dwelt upon with
admiration or even with patience.”

A correspondent complains that at Flemington
races one has to pay' 2s. for a bottle of Foster lager, of
the Sort which grocers sell at ss. 6d. per doz. ; “ and,” he
adds, “ the bottle is cheap compared with the retail tariff
of sixpence for each nobbier glass of lager—a charge
posßively conscienceless. Many people who would prefer
the light unintoxicating liquor are induced to drink
Rass s at the same price simply' because the foreign
article yields a less gigantic profit to the caterer. Other-
wise, there is no fault to find with the bar drinks.”

The Vic. four-oared championship ended in an
easy win for the Mercantile, who paddled home four
lengths ahead of Albert Park—in turn separated by a
length from the Wendouree (Ballarat). The famous
Yarra Yarra Club, which has won this event for five years
running, was not represented—chiefly, perhaps, for want
of a decent craft. Ohamley, the stalwart veteran, who
has for some time past rowed No. 3 in the Yarra four, this
time occupied a similar seat in the Albert Park boat
which was stroked by the lanky Powell, winner of the
Champion Sculls in Brisbane. The Mercs, were stroked
by H. T. Davies, sec. of the local rowing association, H.
Lindgren rowing No. 3, Sloan, the brilliant Fitzroy foot-
baller, No. 2, and Dawson, the “cash-amateur" cy'clist,
who raised such trouble at the last inlerprovincial con-
tests, being bow. Davies showed his crew’s superiority
from the start.

No crowd could have taken Zimmerman more
kindly than the Sydneyites did iast week ; “ dropping ”
to the fact that “ Aathah ” was sick, they hooted gentlv
when he drew off after going two laps. Nathless, it was
a mistake to bill Zimmerman so largely. Rumours of
his indisposition were all over the towni the week preced-
mg last Saturday. It was only his brilliant riding
on the Saturday before that saved a demonstration.
Walford, Zim.’s manager, was away in Mel-
bourne until Saturday morning; he says that Zim. will
not be billed and will not start again until he is in true
form. Zim. has been medically forbidden to ride for
three weeks, and will take a holiday in the Blue Moun-
tains. His trouble appears to be malarial fever.
M Coombe showed himself a game and clever
rider last Saturday, but his luck was bad. When Wootten
and Rathgen came down in the League Cup final,
M Coombe was struck by both of them, and had to ride so
wide that he nearly hit the fence. M‘Coombe, if fairly
treated by handioappers, gets his turn before very long.
Poole (Vic.) won the League Cup of .£2O, and
should thank his stars that Wootten fell, killing his own
chance and M'Coombe’s. Wootten fairly gnawed the
grass while down.
Cyclist Parsons writes that he is not engaged to
be married, as stated.
When the cyclist can’t strike form, ask “ who is
the woman?”
On the N.S.W. League’s day, Porta, the
Italian—he no spik Inglees—before going out for the half-
mile, came to the committee and said; “Gentlemen!
Porta! half-mile! no good!” and the Italian laid his
hand over his heart. Porta went and raced and lost.
Then he returned to the committee, and, placing his
hand once more over his heart, said: “Gentlemen! Portal
half-mile ! no good 1 ”
A good many cyclists thought that Meadham
had a bundle. He had too good a reputation for game
swimming to deserve that, but he proved to 30,000 people
that he had no bundle at cycling last Saturday. After
winning the £lOO Metrop, Handicap, he came out
(without having had even time for a rub down) and won
the £lO three-mile Open Handicap. It was a great per-
formance, and showed his true form from every stand-
point.
Though Matthews didn’t win a single race at
Sydney, he has been made second favorite for the Austral
Cecil Turner is first favorite, and, bar accidents, won’t
win. Matthews won’t win either, unless he gets two
men’s slice of luck.
A dark horse who won’t win the Austral is
Griffiths (Fiji).
Most of the Vic. cyclists who attended the
recent carnival say that the Austral £2OO comes to Sydney
this year. J
Close on two months ago the true form of
Meadham, Payne and Graeme was pointed out by Tub
Bulletin. The style i i which these men rode on Saturday
in the big Metrop. Handicap fully met expectations
Meadham and Graeme won their heats in fine style, while
Payne was beaten on the post through an unexpectedly
brilliant and game finish by Elliott. If Elliott had saved
the spurt he put in his finish—he went by Parsons as if
the latter were standing still—he could have had more
say in the final.
The final saw a desperate finish between Mead-
ham (N.S.W.), Martin (America), Payne and MMnnes
(N.S.W.); but Meadham, who had made the pace for
three-quarters of a lap, got home by a few inches from
MTnnes. Martin, the scratch man who gave MTnnes
20yds. and Meadham 65, ran third. Martin’s pluck drew
an extra £25 from the League.
In giving Martin .£25 and Porta .£25 the
League acted generously ; Porta broke the small bone
of his arm through an accident while training. The
League cleared £l7OO on the Carnival, and awarded
“Florrie” Hanslow, the chief engineer, £lOO and
Barkell, sub-engineer, £5O.
The hot pace set by the triplet in the Five Miles
Australian Championship last Saturday shut up the sick
Zimmerman after two laps; Lewis (N.S.W.) cleverly
snatched the triplet from Parsons (Vic.), and set the field
a rattling go. Martin, O’Brien, Chapman, Simpson and
Payne all collapsed in quick order, and at the seventh lap
only Lewis, Parsons, Iredale, and Megson hung on. At
the ninth lap Megson cried go, and the race became a
duel between Parsons and Lewis. Parsons won, and said
it was the most gruelling race he ever rode. Had Lewis
known how much Parsons was baked, the finish might
have been closer. Iredale, who was third, would have
done better but for a nasty fall early in the afternoon.
When Gov. Hampden arrived he aaid—or was
represented by a daily as having said—that he favored a
certain brand of cycle. Now, it is announced that he has
ordered three cycles of quite another brand. This, per-
haps, as a knock at the firm which used him as an advt -
hoarding on the very day he landed.

Writes a Bulletin correspondent : Zim. shows
bad judgment in not accepting for the Austral,
which, on paper, on performances, and on form, looks
a “dead snap for him did he choose to start.
[He denies that he ever entered, and he is
now too ill to race, anyhow. Ed. B.] This
year s limit man in the big event will he thrown off
the 360 yd. mark, whereas in Tom Busst’s year, when the
champion carried off the £2OO from scratch, he had to
give away as much as 420yds. According to this, the
handicappers are apparently of opinion either that Zim.
is a 60yds. poorer man than Busst, or that the third-class
men of the present time are 60yds. better than those of
six years ago. What ground is there for either of these
beliefs? The first may be summarily dismissed, and the
second is almost as ridiculous. The number of cyclists
has increased tenfold since Busst’s era, and every pos-
sessor of a jigger in Australia fancies his chance for
the big prize. Accordingly, entries are now received
from tenth-raters who can scarcely straddle a machine.
The plaint in former years has always been that the rear
men handicapped out; this year they seem to have
the race finished bar shouting—and blocking. To analyse
the men on the back marks, Martin and Porta haven’t a
possible show, giving Parsons start; and that rider, on
Sydney form, would require much more than the 60yds.
allotted him to make Zim. warm.
Now that the Yankee has dropped out, how-
ever, the race piomises well for Parsons. He has men
every few yards ahead to help him along, assuming that
the heats are fairly distributed, and his strength can
carry him through the grass at a pace calculated to crack
up the second-raters badly. Taking all things into con-
sideration, there are worse things than Parsons for the
Austral of '95.

* lit is but 18 months since Porta, the Italian
cyclist, first rode a machine, yet he has carried off the
100 kilometres of Italy against all the European cracks.
His mate, Martin, the Yank, was also a quick learner,
winning his first race of 100 miles (!) three weeks after
starting. Porta has been enthusiastically taken up by
the Italian residents of Melb., who, headed by basso
profuudo De Alba, have made a perfect little god of the
Milanese youth.

Father John M‘Kenna, a Maoriland priest
weighing 16J stone, recently put up a bicycle record by
doing the 11 miles from Masterton to Carterton, along a
road that is neither very smooth nor very level, in 37min.
The bulky Father on a bike, with his shiny hat driven
hard down on his head and his murky coat-tails flying
far behind him, should be worth seeing.
Harris, the English cyclist, talks about every-
thing but cycling. His pet hobby is photography, and
he spends all he makes on the track in plates and chemi-
cals, developing thousands of plates he never afterwards
takes a print from. He holds that the visit of first-class
riders will do Australians a world of good. “When first
we went to France,” he says, “there were only second-
raters there. Now they turn round and beat us.”

Harkins, the 16-year-older who won the Sydney
Wheel Race £lOO prize, is a Sydney native, and learnt to
ride only a year ago. His first race was at the Highland
Gathering in Jan. ; since then he has jigged about 20
times, but until he secured “ the big money” he was
placed hut once-second to Graeme in a two-mile hatid : -
cap last July. He is sft. Sin., and 9st. 121 b., and has
gained 51b. during his past six weeks’ training. He was
never pushed during the race, and ascribes his race to a
good sprint which he put in when the competitor he
most dreaded came near him. That rival had come up
after a real long sprint, and the one Harkins then put in
“busted” him. Harkins rode a machine geared to 68.
He is a dentist’s apprentice, and will finish his dental
t duoation in America or England. He intends to cycle

Another split in the Theosophical Society,
again just as Mrs. Besant was leaving England.
But this time she thought it wise to remain on
the spot, and her departure for India has been
postponed from Oct. 11 to Dec. 4. Herbert Bur-
rows, the most prominent male member of the
Society, has seceded, making wholesale allega-
tions of fraud against “H.P.8.” and the whole
management of the Society. Burrows is a well-
known Socialistic and Freethinking lecturer in
London, and is acknowledged by all who know
him to be transparently truthful and honest.
Afc Kalgoorlie (W.A.), the calico roof has
blown off the court-house, and the sun-blaze pours
right in. The public is still required to take its
hat off when it enters the building, out of respect

simply another name for sunstroke. In quite a
lot of cases now judgment goes by default, because
the other party to the case lias had to take his bare
head out of the glare.
A Dunolly (Vic.) solicitor’s bill of costs

charged his customers for making up the bill for

The latest Kanakaland leper chronicle is

ary drunks. However, as Col. Sec. Tozer cheer-
fully says, leprosy isn’t catching.

Another phase of the alien question. A
N.S.W. North Coast clergyman dressed down his
congregation on a recent Sunday for their nig-
gardliness in re the collection-plate. His weekly
collections averaged only 305., while his household
exes, amounted to over 40s. He told them that
it might be possible for them to import a Hindoo
or a Chinese clergyman to attend to their spiritual
wants for such a pittance as 305., but they would
never get a Maynooth man to do it. The point of
the rebuke was that many fat members of the
congregation were Hindoo employers.
Amongst the pensions granted last year
by the British Govt, was one of <£loo per annum
to the well-boomed poet, William Watson. This is
the neurotic young man who, a couple of years ago
or so, made a rush for the Prince of Wales’s car-
nage as it was passing down Rotten Row, with
the intention (as it subsequently turned out) of
kissing Tummy’s hand or boots or any other
accessible part of his Royal Highness. He was
given in charge at the time as being mad—but it
looks as if there was method in his madness. For
probably this frenzied outburst of loyalty, rather
than his poetry, is responsible for his pension.
Caterer Beach, brother-in-law of Chief
Justice Way, and the principal Adelaide
restaurateur, died the other day, aged 66. It is
related that when Way engineered vice-regal
functions he would call his humbler relative into
his room and say, “ Well,' Beach, which is it to
be, caterer or guest ? Not both.” The old man
invariably chose the more profitable capacity.
Beach long ago made money on the Vic. gold-
fields—and he kept it.
“The System.” Extract from a Sydney
newspaper, 1826 : “A coroner’s inquest was held
m the county gaol, on Thursday last, on the body
of John Murphy, a capital convict. The unfor-
tunate man was condemned to die 19 weeks ago
for a robbery committed in the Maoquarie-place
residence of Dr. Warded, ever since which period
he has been confined in a small cell, on a chain,
on a scanty allowance of bread and water, and
lingered from day'to day tdl the sentence was
slowly carried into execution, to which effect a
verdict was returned.” And that is less than 70
years ago.
The Vic. Audit Office is known among
civil servants as the, “Deathtrap.” It is on the
top floor of the old Treasury, right under the roof.
Its roofs are low-ceilinged and ill- ventilated, and the
passages are exposed to the currents of air rushing
up the stair-shafts, so that, what with stuffi-
ness in summer and draughtiness in winter, it
is in season a veritable stinkhole and freezing-
chamber. These influences, combined with the
daily climbing up and down stairs, have struck
many clerks with consumption. Five of these
have died during as many years. It was at one
time proposed to abandon the place to the ghosts
of these poor fellows, but the retrenchment policy
intervened, and a few pounds are going to be
spent on improving it instead.
The other day the Scotch express ran off
the rails, and among the unlucky passengers were
a Mrs. Macgregor, who got a leg fractured, and
her sister, killed on the spot. Thereupon the
cable liar—having been recently reprimanded,
perhaps, for not putting enough Australian colour
into his work—wired the information that Mrs.
Macgregor was a Ballarat lady, and her late
lamented sister was suspected of coming from the
same city. A Melbourne journal with fatuous
imaginativeness bestowed the name of “Miss
Macgregor” upon the dead relative, which led one
to suppose that Macgregor, of Ballarat, had mar-
ried one of his cousins on the paternal side. Any-
way, it seemed clear that Australia could take
credit from this catastrophe for Mrs. M.’s broken
limb, and her family connection with the corpse.
Then came a further cable message stating that
Mrs. Macgregor was an ordinary British female
as might have been expected. She didn’t come
from Ballarat. It is more than likely that nobody
in the train, or at St. Neots, where the accident
happened, had ever heard of Ballarat. The pro-
bable fact of the matter is that the cable-liarist
met friend Duncan Gillies as he was leaving his
A.G. office at about 12.45 p.m., after a tiring
day’s work, and having showed him a list of the
victims names, said : “Do any of these sound
Australian?” And Gillies replied: “ Weel I
remember a Mrs. Macgregor at Ballarat.” Then
the purveyor of European intelligence with Aus-
tralian color in it rushed away to despatch his
melancholy fiction.
“ Wallaby is the native word for kan-
garoo.”—London Graphic.
S.G. : “ From the scientific point of view,
Lola Monfcez must be looked upon as a neurotic
degenerate; her lying, vanity and pretence as a
child, her temper, instability, alcoholism, liaisons
as a woman, her lapse to what can only be con-
sidered as religious mania, miscalled penitence,
just before her end, all point to this conclusion.
Her brilliance, her personal magnetism, her
genius, it might almost be called, tell the same
tale of an unsound brain.”
The Far Western (N.S.W.) landholder is
sending up his little supplication just now that
God, having neglected thus long to answer the
prayers for rain offered up by the pious ones on
both sides of him, may be pleased to hold the
rain off for a couple of months or so—until he
gets his land inspected for the purposes of the
re-appraisement of rent. A dozen special
appraisers are now out in the West, including E.
B. L. Dickens, and as both drought and rabbits
are to be taken into account, and as the rent now
to be determined upon is to stand for a minimum
of seven years, it is obvious that the drought and
the rabbit-plague, now particularly severe, are
not an unmixed curse. Anyhow, if men will
occupy that far-back country and pay decent
wages, the rent cannot well be too low. By the
way, apropos Mr. Dickens’ qualifications as an
appraiser, queried lately, Dickens was manager of
Mt. Murchison (Momba Pastoral Co.) 18 years
ago, and has ever since been in the stock and
agency business. He was a Crown appraiser
under the former Act.
Henry Lawson’s book, which may be
called “Block and Backblocks: Australian Verses
by Henry Lawson,” or something of that sort, will
be out shortly and will, like “ Banjo’s ” (orders
for which are rapidly flowing in), be a handsome
volume printed in new type on fine paper. The
price will be ss. 6d., post free from this office, and
The Bulletin, after seeing the material of which
the book is composed, has no hesitation in saying
that it deserves to be, and will be, an immediate
and permanent success.
Mr. Nathan Herman, the proprietor of the
Misfit Parlor in Wynyard-square, Sydney, will be
remembered in that city for many years as the
man who struck a new idea. In every country
where man is sufficiently civilised to have his
clothes and boots made to order, there is neces-
sarily a large accumulation of garments which
have been made to fit the frame of particular pur-
chasers, who didn’t call for them, or couldn’t pay
for them, or died, or absconded, or went
mad, or got into gaol before delivery, and
so left them on the maker’s hands. And
in every case there is someone else about
whom the rejected article would fit, for
everybody’s clothes —except those of Dick Dead-
eye and the Hunchback of Notre Dame —fit
somebody else, and this person would be glad to
get a first-class garment at a reduced price, and
the builder of it would be pleased to get rid of it
at almost any sacrifice. The difficulty always has
been to bring the misfit and the man it will fit
together, and Mr. Herman solved the problem by
accumulating in one place misfits from all
the ends of the earth, so that everybody who
can possibly be fitted by human ingenuity
may go there and be satisfied. He is
also a universal provider—a dealer in safes,
crockery, furniture, bedding, carpets, linoleums,
oil-cloths, drapery, jewellery, watches, cigars,
tobacco, tea (401 b. chest for 30s. or 121 b. tin for
10s.), cutlery, fancy goods, ironmongery, &c., &c.
But the misfit idea was his own special inspira-
tion, and he is proud of it. Even the famous
£2 bale, which contains a suit of clothes, two
shirts, two undershirts, six pairs socks, two ties,
two collars, six handkerchiefs, set studs, hat, pair
braces and pair of Loots, all sent to the railway
station or wharf nearest to the buyer’s residence
for 405., doesn’t appeal to his soul like that great
original idea. Mr. Herman has lately broken out
into pianos, firearms, ammunition, and other new
departments, and makes srentlemen’s suits for
£1 9s. 6d., and supplies dress-suits at one-fourth
the usual price. Also, he has broken out into so
many other lines of business of late that no one
knows for certain what he has got, and the things
that he hasn’t got could mostly, be enumerated on
the back of one postage stamp, and even then the
stamp wouldn’t be unduly crowded.*

“About ten years ago, while engaged in
shunting, my foot caught between the rails,
and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but 1 have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
Obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and 1
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the swelling disappeared, and 1 have
not been troubled with it since.”

“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great honetit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger's
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.''
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would he

“ Next to criminals the vainest creatures
are literary men and artists.”— Havelock Ellis.
Westralian election candidate: “Gintle-
min, Oi do b’lieve in wan man wan vote'; Oi do
b’lieve in wan man wan wife —but, gintlemin, Oi
do not b’lieve in wan man wan woman.”
At Perth (Scotland) a man lately got 20
days’ gaol for pounding his wife with a kitchen
fender bearing the legend in brass letters,
“ Home, Sweet Home ! ”
A certain Australian Q.C. was once de-
fending a co-respondent in divorce, and it was
doubtful if the jury could be brought to take a
lenient view. They were evidently halting
between two opinions, and the Judge’s summing-
up would probably settle the matter. This sum-
ming-up the Q.C. strongly suspected would be
adverse to his client, so he rose to the occasion.
He knew that the Judge carried in his most
fleshy part a charge of shot as the result of a
youthful amour. So he perorated thus: “If
petitioner’s story were true, why had he not acted
as an angry man would ? I know a case in which
a vile scoundrel, a dishonorable scoundrel, an un-
speakable villain, a disgrace to humanity and to
his profession, was detected in his intrigues, and
the injured party put a lot of small shot into him,
which he is sitting on at this day. Did petitioner
show any such signs of having learned a shameful
secret?” and so on. The Judge got wild, and
summed up, as calculated, so bitterly and so un-
fairly against the co-respondent that the jury
revolted against the judicial directions out of
natural combativeness, and found a verdict
accordingly.
John Francis Donovan is the third shunte 1 '
killed at Perth railway-station in six months, as a
result of the Westralian Government’s parsi-
mony. At the inquest an assistant ■ shunter
deposed: “Saw Donovan when he came on.
Donovan said he was tired out and full-up of the
job.” Witness had not seen shunting done by
one man until he came to Westralia, and he had
had 17 years experience. “In Victoria, usually
three men attended to the shunting and there
were eight-hour shifts. If there had been another
man an accident might have been averted.” The
driver of the shunting-engine said to Donovan,
just before the accident, “ I suppose you are very
nearly tired out.” He said, “Yes, I am, I have
been working pretty nearly all day single-
handed.” Deceased said when witness came up
to him, after the accident, “Ah, Jimmy,
this is the result of working short-handed.”
The coroner: “This man had a great deal
to do there was evidence that he was
thoroughly fagged out.” The jury strongly
condemned the system of overworking the em-
ployes, and gave it as its opinion that (1) There
were not sufficient men to do the work, and (2)
the hours of labor were too long for the protec-
tion of the travelling public and the employes.
Writes S.M. Herald’s special correspon-
dent from Liverpool :
The ordinary business man of Britain lias about as
much sympathy for “his dear brother,” “his own people
on the other side of the worid, his own flesh and blood,
held to England by that unseverable silken tie” (expres-
sions frequently heard from public platforms, especially
Australian ones), as the ordinary brick of commerce.
There is used here a brick with a vitrified glassy face,
smooth as a tile. That is the brick which meets this case.
It has a smooth face, but a very bard one. . . . Such
a man will trade with America or Armenia, just as he
will with Australia. The smallest fraction, say the
thirty-second part of a farthing, will turn the scale in
favor of the country which offers it. Sentiment is per-
haps necessary to the Imperial Institute, but it doesn’t
exist in the trade centres of London, Liverpool, Man-
chester, or many other places I have visited.
In other words, the sole use of the “silken tie”
and the “crimson thread ” is to make webs in
which British spiders may lie low and trap un-
wary Australian flies. Just what The Bulletin
has pointed out for the last 16 years.
Lands Minister Best predicts that the Vic.
Mallee will, under his new bill, become the fashion-
able place of settlement. The Pall Mallee.

a very troublesome affection of the Nerves,” which affected me so much that I was quite unable to

Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous' System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, 1 was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful 1 did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking, you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper ol
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great.difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me U
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the firs!
of your Pills; since then 1 have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfalhn
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 21
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies te
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I considei
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Jtlizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. Ihe firm has a reputation for straight deal-
e xtending over a period of 40 years, which is
sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems,*

Ihe late manager of a very big Blackall

The NEW ARTISTS and CHANGE OP
PROGRAMME received with thunders
of Applause.
Extracts in brief from the Sunday papers and
Monday dailies
Sydney Morning Herald, Nov. 25,1895
Crowded on Saturday afternoon and evening,
when a long and diversified programme, in which
artists of repute took part, was gone through in
right excellent style. In the afternoon at the
matinee a large number of children appeared to
thoroughly enjoy themselves. . . . The pro-
gramme, which was composed of songs and
ballads, medleys and dancing, and comic perform-
ances generally, proved well-merited applause,
ihe artists were re-called again and again. The
trourlays acted with great spirit and were vigor-
ously applauded.” B
Sydney Daily Telegraph, Nov. 25, ’95
a o Tlie ™ w . as ° ne noticeable repetition at the
Sydney Music Hall on Saturday evening and that
re^ ard khe attendance. The place was
tilled to the limits of comfort. As hitherto, also,
the audience was wildly enthusiastic. . . .
Ihe powerful combination of sterling artists were
seen at their best, and the packed house, with its
incessant recalls, proved the shining ability of the
variety stars.”
Sydney Evening News, Nov. 25, ’95
r ;, Lawler’s popular place of amuse-
ment, the Sydney Music Hall, in George-street,
was packed on Saturday night. A really first-
class programme was gone through. Special men-
ac , Jv? e , ?, uc , c ® sBes of the Gourlays in “ That
Awful Garl, Mr. Frank Adams, the popular
tenor, Miss Eileen Leslie, the dashing Gray Sis-
ters Mr. Leonard, Tom Edwards, Franks and
Williams must be given and praise without stint
tor the excellence of their performances.”
Sunday Truth, Nov. 24, ’95
• . . Mr. Lawler is determined to spare no
expense in providing for the patrons of the
George-street place of amusement, a first-class
entertainment. The Gourlays made a great hit
in that Awful Girl,’and took immensely. Miss
Gora Bailey fluttered the dove-cotes (poetical
for the front-stalls) with her ‘ Cuckoc
Uauce . . There’s plenty of mirth, melody
Mdmusui down at Lawler’s for anyone in search
of those commodities.”
Sunday Times, Nov. 24, ’95.
The latest addition to Sydney variety shows
has undoubtedly hit public taste, and last night
the house was filled in every part, the fact that
several well-known first-class artists had been
added to the. company proving an additional
attraction. In the first part, Miss Nellie
btntch, who made her first appearance, ren-
dered I was Dreaming ” in such a pleasing
manner as to at once make her a fast favorite with
the audience, who recalled her several times, and
she finally responded with ‘ Killarney.’ In their
farce, ‘ lhat Awful Girl,’ the Gourlays were seen
at their best; Miss Gourlay singing and dancing
with the vivacity for which she is noted ; and Mr.
Gourlay keeping the audience in roars of laughter.
Miss Cora Bailey soon danced herself into favor,
and there can be no question about her cleverness. '
The Bulletin, Nov. 30
“A Rood business is still doing at the Sydney
Music Hall, and sundry new artists turn up each
week to lend variety to the bill. The harmless,
necessary corner-man gets some new ideas now
and then, and aims queer conundrums at the man
m the centre, and some good singers and dancers
brighten up the proceedings, but nothing very
dreadful happens. . . Miss Amy Gourlay and her
brother Bill have joined the co., and make it a
good deal stronger than it was before, and nothing
in the bill calls for particular execration at present.

A deposit receipt sale in connection with
ot. James’s Building Society, Melbourne, is an-
nounced in another column for 12th December,
when a number of valuable properties in the
Southern city and its suburbs will be submitted
to the public. Deposit-receipts in the Society
will be accepted in payment at their face value. Of
course, as is usually the case, the buyers attend-
ing this first sale will get the cream of the pro-
perties to be sold. Messrs. Keogh and Allard,
acting with Gemmell, Tuckett and Co., are con-
dupttng the sale.*
An interesting announcement to printers,
stationers and investors is made elsewhere by
Messrs. Danby, Butler, and Fischer, the premier
accountants of Melbourne. Owing, no doubt, to
the stress of the recent disastrous times in the
Southern province, the enormous business of Fer-
gusson and Mitchell, wholesale printers and
stationers, has fallen into liquidation; the stock
sheets tot up £37,550, and Messrs. Danby, Butler,
and Fischer are prepared to receive tenders for
the estate up to 12th December.*
Xmas is a religious festival at which it is
everybody s duty to eat and drink more than is
good for him, and if he doesn’t want to aggravate
the indigestible character of the occasion it is
essential that he should get good liquor. That is
to say, he should get it from Mr. P. R. Larkin’s
old-established emporium, 778-782 George-street,
Sydney. Mr. Larkin’s price-list is an imposing
document of 12 pages, containing the names and
prices or some 240 different liquors. P. R. Larkin
himself is a guarantee of good feeling as well as
good liquor towards all mankind. The fact that
there are 29 different varieties of old Scotch
whisfky alone on his list is a thing for the
W.C.T.U. to ponder over. Twenty nine kinds of
Scotch whisky and only one kind of teetotalism 1
The newest thing in Xmas cards is the
card, issued by George Robertson and
Co., of 361 George-street, Sydney. It is exceed-
ingly artistic, is a new and purely Australian
idea, and reproduces all the delicate shades of the
emu egg to perfection. In other departments the
firm is making a great effort for the holiday
season, and has laid in an enormous stock of
travelling-cases, jewel and dressing-cases, desks,
photo-albums, cases and frames, gold and silver-
mounted purses, card and letter-cases, wallets,
pocket-books, cigar and cigarette-cases in all kinds
of leather and all variety of new colors. The
firm is also strong on toy books, presentation
books, children’s books, miscellaneous books, and
books generally, artistic stationery, all manner of
Xmas and New Year cards, and innumerable
other items of miscellaneous gorgeousness.
LONDON WOOL-MARKET VERSUS AUS-
TRALIAN SALES.
In this important controversy the National
Wool Company, of Melbourne, commenting upon
it, remarks : “Of course, Australian sales are not
regarded favorably by those whose interest it is
to centralise all trade in London, but at the same
time there are cogent reasons why Australians
should insist on disposing of their raw products
in their own trade centres. In fact, it is the
decentralisation already existent, in our opinion,
which at various times has saved the market from
utter collapse. Were the wool products of Aus-
tralia, Argentina, and the Cape, all disposed of
in London, sales might be held continuously all
the year round, manufacturers would supply
themselves from day to day, adopt a hand to
mouth policy, no stocks would be held, and prices
would drop to zero. The conditions which neces-
sitate the holding of stocks are those which tend
to hold up the market. Manufacturers holding
stocks will be led by the strongest motives of self-
interest to see that their trade rivals do not buy
cheaper than they have bought, hence there is a
permanent stimulus to give prices an upward
tendency. Wool-buyers operating here keep that
speculative element alive; had it not been so, the
recent low range of values might have been lower
still. Again, while we feed the London market
at the expense of the Australian, we subsidise the
London middlemen to the yearly tune of .£700,000
for commission and warehousing.” Concluding
their remarks, the National Wool Company asks
the question : “Is it not Australia’s policy to
give all possible employment to her own people,
and particularly when this course is the course of
self-interest as well?
Messrs. Burns and Bright (whose names
probably induced them to go into the lamp-trade
together), specialists in lamps and stoves, have
opened a warehouse at 148 Pitt-street, Sydney,
wiiere, if they don’t get the entire trade of N.S.W.,
they propose at least to deserve it. They deal in
every article in their line, but their speciality—
the culminating point of their ambition and prin-
cipal source of pride and satisfaction—is the
Australis Stove, which combines more strong
points than any other single stove in the market.
All the points are controlled by one damper. It
burns wood or coal and answers equally well in-
doors or outside, requires no setting, and has a
jam-making apparatus in addition to the other
ordinary conveniences of a first-class stove. B.
and B. also deal in table and hall decorations and
lamps of every description for every purpose, bub
their latest and newest feature is a kerosene night-
light, which costs just 3s. 4d. for 200 hours’ burn-
ing, or one-fifth of a penny per hour.
The big firm of Gowing Bros., men’s and
boys’ mercers, clothiers, outfitters, and hatters,
established in Sydney 27 years, has taken over
the extensive premises at 486, 488 and 490 George-
street, lately occupied by Cecil Hordern. The
new establishment is the best-lighted and most com-
modious of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere,
and faces the central entrance of the coming new
markets. Buying at first-hand from the largest
manufacturers for cash, Gowing Bros, are pre-
pared to dress the men and boys of this country
at a cost within easy reach of everyone, be he the
richest or the poorest. The firm particularly
draws attention to the 455. suit, and stakes its
reputatiomon it being the best thing in this line
on the Australian market. Patterns and self-
measurement forms are sent post free, so the bush-
man has only himself to blame if he doesn’t turn
out to mash his Sunday-girl in a suit which would
ingratiate him with the most fashionable girl in
the city. A man well-dressed commends himself
to the whole world, and nowadays Gowing Bros,
have solved the way for a well-dressed world to
be continuously pleasing itself. #
Melb. Argus often tries to joke nowadays,
but once upon a time it never permitted a smile
in its columns, The-fjrst joke that ever appeared
in an Argus leader happened—that is the word —
some years ago, just after Mrs. Campbell-Praed
and Justin McCarthy published their novel,
“T ie Right Honorable.” The writer, in a mood
of after-dinner friskiness,said : “This book, ‘The
Rig it Honorable,’ is the work of a man and a
vvo .i oi most Right Honorables are.” The thing
civ te l such a stir that it was long ere any other
memoer of the staff ventured to laugh in office-
hours.

A Pretorian (South Africa) “ apology ” :
I, Petrus Daniel Struweg, residing on the farm Drie-
hoek, district of Marthinus, Wesselstroom, S.A.R.,.declare
herewith that the evidence which I gave in the Court at
Marthinus Wesselstroom on the 21st August, 1895, under
my oath in the case of N. D. Coetzer versus The Widow
Herbst was false.
I confess hereby, in the presence of seven persons that
everything that I said against Messrs. J. Meek and 0. Vos
to the detriment of their honor and character is nothing
but lies and not true, and I say that, henceforth, I shall
live as a liar, and if, at any future time, I shall say any-
thing to the detriment of any other person, they shall
have the right to shut my lying mouth, and further I am
willing to have this apology published three times in
some newspapers, and I shall pay the charges therefor.
As witnesses, &c.
Mrs. Kilpatrick’s famous case against the
owners of the lost steamer Alert has got a step
further. That lady’s husband was second en-
gineer of the cranky steamer, which went down
off the Victorian coast one day in Dee. ’93, and
carried him along with it to the sea-bottom. She
claimed damages from the owners, and, in Feb.
’95, the broken-winded law overtook the case, and
after much expensive argument awarded her .£6OO,
on the ground that the Alert wasn’t a proper and
seaworthy vessel and fit for the work in which
she was engaged. If it had been a hanging or a
flogging that was in question the law would have
got at the case a lot earlier, and its decision would
have been carried out in a month at the latest,
but Property was at stake, and in these cases
the law goes very slowly indeed. A new trial was
applied for and granted, and then the law spent
nine months getting its second wind. At last it
arrived with the violent energy of a snail in
ballast, and threw itself bodily into the ease a
second time, and after wading through another
ocean of argument it emerged at the other side,
this time for a verdict of .£791, or .£l9l more than
the first one. The widow, who has been living in
poverty for two long years awaiting the painful
gradualness of the courts, will now probably get
her money unless it is all gone in costs, or unless
a few more trials ensue. Even Sleep gets old and
cobwebbed while awaiting the final decision of the
law in a case where Property is involved.
Yoski, the Japanese murderer and suicide,
of Thursday Island (writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent) was a constant terror to the colored popula-
tion, and his country people in particular. At
the local Yoshiwara his demands for amatory in-
dulgence were promptly supplied, as they were
usually accompanied by a display of his revolver.
Before the establishment of local sittings of the
higher court little escapades of this kind were
usually kept quiet, to avoid a trip toCooktown at,
perhaps, the one good season of the year; but, in
such suppressed cases, the boss of the station
adjudicated, and his verdict was never questioned
nor its rigor abated. Yoski once deliberately
shot a countryman, one of his crew; but as
the wound, though extremely painful, didn’t
promise to be mortal, he was let off with
an unmerciful trouncing administered by the
Judge in person, and a fine of £25 by way of
a solatium to the wounded—the hush-money to
be a first lien on his earnings. Whenever, during
the currency of the promise, Yoski got angry and
looked devilish his creditor would say, “ Very
well, I go long Thursday Island, tell pliseman ; ”
but on his subsiding into a peaceful mood the
victim would add, “All right, I take it that
£25.” While anchored in his lugger on the shell-
ing-grounds, Yoski saw, some little distance off,
a man pulling by in a dingey. He hailed him ;
but, as the puller took no notice, Yoski reached
into his cabin for his Winchester and coolly fired
■point blank at him half-a-dozen shots, two of
which went through the boat’s side—fore and aft
its astonished occupant. Thinking it time to
surrender, the dingey came alongside, when
Yoski, with a profound salaam, explained : “ Ex-
coose me, my friend, I think it that dingey belong
me.” With the death of one of his victims (Mrs.
Tommy Japan) closes another chapter of the Car-
bine sweep history. The winning ticket was
owned by a syndicate of Japs, in which Tommy
held the lion’s share, and drew about .£7OOO. He
very soon went home, where he invested largely in
business, and promptly “ went down for his
stuff.” Soon after he died, and his widow re-
turned here a few months ago. Yoski wanted
her to marry him ; but she refused —hence her
sudden exit from life’s stage. The other victim,
Fujetta Tatsu, was the best tattooed man I ever
saw.

Alex. Sutherland, a Melb. poet and peda-
gogue, says ha despises American iiutnor. It is,
tie remarks, extravagant and outrages facts. Mr.
Sootherlan’ is reported to be preparing a series of
lectures which will introduce an uneducated
public to a school of humor that is humor. As a
Scotchman (or, at any rate, a person of Scotch
descent) Alexawnder should be specially qualified
to do this. Scotchmen are said to “joke wi’
deefficulty,’ but that is, no doubt, because they
are conscientious and joke with the fear of God
in their hearts, instead of throwing off their jests
in the spontaneous, slipshod fashion of humorists
who have no sense of responsibility.
CnfcTiett Walker, the popular N.S.W,
Principal Under-Secretary, whom admirers have
placed in the sculptor’s hands, entered the N.S.W.
Civil Service at the age of 15, and has stayed
there almost 40 years. He ordinarily claims to be
a Tasmanian, though in reality he was born at
sea, somewhere in the vicinity of the Cape of
C°od Hope. The title “Principal,” prefixed to
his official designation, was the coinage of his pre-
decessor, the poet Halloran, and was countenanced
out of courtesy ; and many suppose that courtesy
alone sanctions it still. But Mr. Walker, noticing
this in a newspaper some years ago, wrote point-
ing out that the title is his by official gazette
authority.

SEEST- WILLIAM SULLIVAN-
Sergeant William Sullivan is up to
something—he is up to the wall, upright
to the wall, right up to the upright wall.
It is a queer position for a real live ser-
geant ; it looks a painful one, but he does
not show his face—that would tell a tale.
He is laughing, although he is straining
every nerve to keep his equilibrium. It
is not because Sergeant Sullivan is a
giddy man that he makes this attempt to
lean sideways straight up to the wall.
Neither does he try it because there
is no convenient lamp - post to em-
brace. The fact is, he was offered
Five Pounds if he could do it, and, as
the picture shows, he attained the
desired position, but he didn’t attain the
desired Prize, for we were inquisi-
tive, and found out the Old Soldier
dodge. He had a nail on his finger-
an iron one —and driven into the wall.
That wasn’t in the piece, so Sergeant
Sullivan retired, and he says, “You
can’t pull the breeches off a High-
lander, and you can’t do that—it’s an
impossible motion.” Now, readers, the
proprietor of Beecham’s Pills invites you
and all your friends to place your right
side right up to an upright wall, every
portion of your side from ankle to the
shoulder being in contact with the wall.
Then attempt to raise the left foot from
the ground while the right side of the
body is still in contact with the wall. If
there is no fun to be got out of this
experiment, you are in a bad way, and
we feel it our bounden duty to remind
you that for ensuring buoyant spirits,
and the capacity to enjoy life to the
full, BEECHAM’S BILLS are
Worth a Guinea a Box!

The working-classes are represented on

practically passed out of their hands.
Says Rosebery : “ There are two happy

resignation of the seals of office.” An allegory :
Engagement and divorce.
A State schoolmaster has a few leaderettes
from Melb. Herald cut out and framed, as shock-

get niarks for picking out the grammatical blun-

century Abraham was cashier of the Bank of
England for 60 years, and his name became a
synonym for the notes which he signed. Hence,
to “sham Abraham” was originally to counterfeit
a bank-note : then to counterfeit anything ; now
(chiefly) to counterfeit illness.
Cancer is also to be attacked by serum-
therapy, it appears; the serum to be from an
animal in which erysipelas has been induced arti-
ficially in a mild form. And the blood serum of
the horse is to be used as a remedy for tuber-
culosis, it being stated that he is naturally im-
mune from that disease.
Prof. Liversidge, of Sydney University,
has found that a brick soaked in oil does not lose
the absorbed oil, and is absolutely water-proof.
Anyhow, bricks so soaked weighed exactly the
same,.after four years’exposure to the weather, as
when taken out of the oil. But sandstone, soaked
in oil, weighed the same, after four years’ weather-
ing, as before it was placed in the oil. Neverthe-
less, curious to relate, though the oil had thus
apparently left it, the stone remained impervious
to water.
The tea-cup storm re accountant Col. Tem-
pleton and his bossing of the precious Vic. army
whilst the Imperial Commandant went picnicking
in another province, seems to have blown over
at the instance of Gov. Brassey. Anyway, the
local officer suddenly ceased to defy the other
gaudy gentleman, and next night Brassey jumped
at a passing opportunity to drag the name of Mrs.
Colonel Templeton, “ with honor and gratitude,”
into a little speech. Templeton, presumably, had
knuckled down to oblige Government House.
Item from the Investors’ Review (Lon-
don) :
Within the last quarter of a century, to go no further
back, vva have spent nearly ±800,000,000 on our army and
navy, including the cost of little wars not paid for by the
Indian ryot—patient animal that he is, fat votes of credit
for the delectation of our bureaucracy, and such odd-
ments. And the national revenue from drink has in the
game period of time come to within about ±120,000,000 of
this overwhelming sura. The drunkards, therefore, have
been the true guardians of our empire and upholders of
the brotherly goodwill which subsists between nations,
and gets itself emphasised at all military parades and
naval shows throughout Europe. Behold then the
secret of our greatness! If the stability of our
empire had depended on the income-tax or on a
poll-tax, on a land-tax, on “inhabited house duty,” or on
“ss. a quarter upon imported grain,” or on all these
together, it would have long since come to nought. Rest-
ing on our magnificent drinking capacity, it has not only
endured but increased in splendor unto this hour—witness
the array and navy estimates passim . Prom this point of
view we have always regarded the drunkard as the
noblest of national benefactors and greatest mainstay of
the constitution. Upon the highest grounds of imperial
interests, then, we plead for the liberty of all Englishmen
to get drunk as often as seems to them good. Their noble
thirst brings the Exchequer and the local rates even now
a good ±34,000,000 a year.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
Undoubtedly the largest buyer of opals in the
rough state is H. Newman, the well-known Mel-
bourne jeweller, who has been connected with
this branch of the gem trade since its inception,
and keeps a large staff of skilled lapidaries busily
employed on these and other Australian gems.
He is also a large buyer of pearls and diamonds,
and gets through an immense quantity of Queens-
land sapphires. The firm has been established
for over 40 years, and has a reputation for straight
dealing which is sufficient guarantee to con-
signors of rough gems that they will be honorably
dealt with. The establishment is still at the old
spot in Elizabeth-street, right opposite the Post
Office, and is well worthy of a visit of inspection.*
Dear Bulletin, —The black plague which,
at Hongkong, last year, killed 2000 people between
June and Aug., illustrates what might happen if
hordes of Chinese are permitted to settle in Aus-
tralia. The disease was a kind of black typhus,
and produced swellings in fTie groins and armpits,
being entirely similar to the black plague of
London, 300 years ago. It was caused by the
filthy habits of the low-class Chinese coolie, and
was stamped out by the heroic conduct of some
of the European residents, who attended to the
burial of the bodies, burning of the effects of the
diseased people, and whitewashing of their hovels.
About 30 of these volunteer-workers took the
plague-fever themselves, but all recovered save
two. — The.ldler. Hongkong, Sept. 30, ’95.

THE COUNTRY BRAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Six long years’ battling in the bush is not so very
gay,
And so [ chucked the job and took once more the
Sydney way.
I knew, of course, my style was not exactly up-to-
date,
And so I thought I’d make a change—in hats, at
any rate.
The old slouch hat I’d had for years I thought
would make folks smile,
And so I made a big resolve to have the latest
style;
And when I got as far as Bourke—the first big
town you see—
I got the latest:thing they had—it was a cabbage-
tree.
But when I got to Dubbo —why the folks began to
grin—
Said they, “Bourke saw him coming, and they
took this bushy in.”
This broke me up—l bought in place of my new
cabbage-tree
A Panama with turban round—a gorgeous thing
to see.
That cady suited me to rights—l felt ’tvvas just
the thing—
I felt as good as Tyson feels, and better than a
king,
Until at Bathurst I arrived, and there my beer
was flat,
I felt .I had the bushy brand still plainly in my
hat.
I bought a hat of alpine shape—l tell you it was
great,
Said I : “At last I’ve got a hat that’s really up-
to-date.”
Alas ! when I to Sydney got, a news-boy said to
me—
“Hi, bushy, bow’s the sheep out-back? you’re on
a fine old spree !”
Now, here’s the truth about the bush from my
own point of view :
It grips a man at every point and soaks him
through and through.
It draws his legs out thin and long and knocks
his knees together ;
It works until it makes his face a sign-post of the
weather.
It makes him long and lank as well, and gives him
slouching shoulders ;
It gives him, too, a camel walk to paralyse be-
holders.
So, when you come to Sydney town, don’t change
your rig on landing—
No clothes that ever yet were made can hide the
country branding.

WHEN BROTHER, PEETREE PRAYED.
A RECOLLEOTION.
’Tvvas a sleepy little chapel by a wattled hill
erected.
Where the storms were always muffled, and an
atmosphere of peace
Hung about beneath the gum-trees, and the gar-
den was respected
By the goats from Billybunga and the washer-
woman’s geese.
In the week-days it was sacred to my young
imagination ;
From its waljsjthere oozed a sentiment of rever-
ence profound ;
And on Sunday morns the murmuring of the
childish congregation
Seemed to spread a benediction in the bush-
land far around.
But when Brother Peetree prayed all the parrots
flew dismayed,
And the hill shook to its centre, and the trees and
fences swayed ;
And we youngsters heard the rumble of the Day
of Judgment there,
When the pious superintendent wrestled manfully
in prayer.
They were horny-handed Methodists and men of
scanty knowledge,
Who controlled that “ little corner of the vine-
yard ” by the pound ;
Their theology was not the kind that’s warranted
at college,
But their faith was most abundant, and their
gospel always sound.
Brother Peetree was a miner at the Band of Hope.
His leisure
He employed in “sticking porkers” for his
neighbors, and his skill
Was a theme of admiration; but his soul’s sub-
limest pleasure
Was to speak a prayer on Sundays in the chapel
’neath the hill.
Froze the marrow in our bones at the sound of
hollow groans,
And the shrieks of moral anguish, and the awful
thunder tones;
And we saw the Hell-fire burning, and we smelt
it in the air,
When dear Brother Peetree struggled with the
Lord of Hosts in prayer.
Brother Peetree always started with a murmured
supplication,
Knelt beside a form, serenely, with a meek,
submissive face,
But he rose by certain stages to a rolling exhorta-
tion.
And a wild, ecstatic bellowing for sanctity and
grace ;
And he threw his arms to heaven, and the seats
went down before him
As he fought his way along the aisle, and prayed
with might and main.
With hysterical hesceohings. Then a sudden
peace fell o’er him,
And he finished, softly sobbing, at his starting-
point again.
And the elders, to their ears pale with reverential
fears,
And the sisters and the choir indulged in hot,
repentant tears ;
And the sinners for salvation did with eagerness
declare.
When beloved Brother Peetree wrestled mightily
in prayer.

An Unknown Interlude,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The room in which they sat showed that
they were quite well-to-do. The chairs and floor
were richly carpeted. The brass on the fender
and coal-scuttle was bright and massive, the
pictures choice originals. But in all the room
there was hardly any comfort. The fire had gone
low, and although it was six o’clock in winter, the
gas had not been lighted.
Presently out of the silence there came the
sound of the woman yawning, and in the yawn
there was that depth of laziness belonging only to
people whose dispositions are wholly steeped in
sloth.
“ The fault was yours.” It was the man speak-
ing. “The fault was entirely yours. If you had
not spoilt her, it would never have happened.”
“You did not take too much interest in her.
It was not because of that, that she went away.
It is of no use yottr being disagreeable to me.
Who could tell that s e was so deceitful? ”
A young man came into the room. He was
their son; Neither took any notice of him. He
crossed the roo n and lighted the gas, and as he
did so a knock came to the door.
The two looted at each other, and the next
instant saw the boy dart towards the door. A
moment lalcr he returned. He was bearing some-
thing in his arms.
“ 1 knew it! ’ cried the woman, “ I knew it! ”
and that was all she said.
Then her daughte ’s eyes, those beautiful star-
like eyes, looked wonderingly at her. And as
they looke 1, so full of anguish were they, that
they seemed half hidden by a mist.
The next moment the girl fell forward.
* # •
It was eighteen months since she had sud-
denly left the house ; what had happened to her
since then ?
“ He has, of course, deserted her,” said the
wiman. “That is quite evident.”
“ >She had better die,” she was thinking in her
mind. “A woman disgraced! She had much
better die.”
“I always told you how it would end,” said
the husband. “ Licentio isness was graven on his
face. Yet you encouraged him to come to the
house.”
She was used to this abuse, but to-night she
turned white, and, shutting the door with a bang,
s ie left the apartment.
• # #
During the days that passed she haunted
the girl’s room. Restless and eiger, with a
passion for cleta’l, before death came into the
h mse she must know all that had occurred. In
her mind she saw the man that had taken away
her child, drinking, gambling, and making love to
women. To the verdict of her husband she had
a Ided two vices more. There were endless tales
of vice and injury lurking between her and her
daughter. Surely when at last the girl should
s. eak the very walls would tremble with horror !
But she never spoke ; only shuddered once or
twice as the wo nan’s step approached.
#' • #
She was dying.
A movement of suspense passed over the mother
sitting beside the bed. Could she be going to
oie without a word ?
For days the mother had been much happier.
Her daughter had spoken sometimes to her, and
had seemed to listen in return wth interest. At
least, had she not seen he smiling !
It was t ue. She smiled at what she saw in her
own mind—the world that had been hors after she
left home. She would always carry it with her —
even into the grave.
• # «
Her mother lifted her body in his arms.
His mother screamed. “I am going to lay her
at his side,” he saio, and bore her from the room.
His mother went back to the bed.
There, on the white sheets, lay a wedding-ring
clasping firmly a piece of something black.
Sue turned ve y red. Her husband said, “It
is a piece of ploth ” —he paused—” from a pall
and he trembled.
I hat was all they ever learned of their child.
“Edward will, tell us all.” Her eyes were
moist with happy tears. “ Edward will tell us all
when he comes - back. How strange ! How
strange ! ” F
But he did not o&mtTback.

Didn’t Run Smooth,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A close, sleepy summer evening. A drowsy hum
fro n the interior of a village church, wherein the
worthy minister was just reaching his five-and-
twentieth minute of a discourse on the alleged
fact that Joshua made the sun stand still. Out-
side, enjoying the calm sunset and the refreshing
coolness after the heat of the day, was the verger.
•Somehow, vergers rarely love sermons, but prefer
« pipe in the open. To him, escaping with relief
from the close dulness of the sacred edifice, spoke
a youth, “made in New South Wales.”
To gaze on such a lovely being was a feast of
b auty, to hear him speak a never-ending joy.
He stood, confessed “colonial’’-made, and shamed
t e sunset with the glow he wore. Baffled recoils
th ■ pen which dares attempt the picture of the
sp.endid thing he was. Only the pimples on his
N.d.ow cheek, marring his ample mouth’s expres-
sive lines, and the close-bitten nails upon the
1 aws which strove to hide behind his 9in. cuff,
1 .oked hardly fitting adjuncts to a glory which
s emed to shout upon the stilly night, “In this
style, eighteen bob ! ”
This noble product of our later age approached
the placid verger. “ ’Off long ” —thus spake he —
“ ’Ow long do the old geeser gen’ly work ’is
chin ? ”
The verger removed his pipe and shortly re-
plied, “About half-an-hour.”
“ Gawn ! ” exclaimed Adonis. And, in a
breath, he proceeded to unfold the burden of an
enterprise of love, miscarried through ill-chance.
“ A bloomin’gal,” this was his sad complaint—
“ a bloomin’gal I met this afternoon made it a
promise that I’d find ’er ’ere, sittun’ on the
seckind seat from the back. An’ now I carnt lay
’auds on ’er. Pre-aps you’d tell me if you’ve seen
a gal with yaller ’air, green ’at and scarlet feather,
a-sittun in this bloomin’ Weslee’n Church?”
The verger shook his head, but, in an off-hand
way, remarked that the sacred edifice before them
was labelled Anglican, and had no connection
with any other house in the trade.
“Is this th’ English Church?” Adonis cried,
as the crass error he had fallen into smote on his
mind with horrid force; “then, darn me, if I
’aven’t patronised the wrong blanky show 1 ”
And he rushed hotfooted away, seeking for the
fane where Love and Wesleyanism smiled and
waited for him.

Youth,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was long after midnight and we were exchang-
ing confidences. Replying to me, the doctor said :
“ What is the happiest time of a man’s life ? My
happiest time was in my University days. I was
very poor, I worked very hard, and I was in love.
Perhaps love was the charm. And yet in after
time I have been in fiercest love and have enjoyed
comparative leisure and luxury. But no matter
about that —
“ It was a hard struggle for my parents to pay
for my education. I had pocket-money occasion-
ally. When my mother sold a few eggs she sent
me the proceeds. I can understand how religion
has its beginnings in ancestor-worship.
“ I remember one occasion when I was rich in
the possession of six shillings. I had written a
love-letter and was looking for a birthday
memento to enclose in it. The balance, after pay-
ing for the love-token, would be my only asset for
an unknown period. I inspected the contents of
the shop windows and of the book-shops to which
I had access, but all the articles of taste were
only for richer people than I. At last I hit upon
card the design of which was artistic, and which
contained a verse that was really poetry. I
looked and coveted, and with an effort 1 sum-
moned courage to ask the price. It was six shil-
lings. I paid the money and sent the card, and
returned to my dismal lodgings penniless, but
happy.’’
“ And the girl, doctor ? ”
The doctor made no reply.

A Good Team,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They were discussing the horse-power of various
well-known bullock-teams in a pub. beyond
Mossyface, and I hung over some refreshment
and listened whilst the coach-driver doctored his
broken brake. A tall, spare young man, the
color of old bronze, with protruding knees, and
the gravity of a moulting mopoke, had taken up
the theme, and held the floor.
“’Taint no good a man tellin’halfer what he
knows about cattle,” he said, “ ’cos he don’t gain
nothin’ by it but the reputation of bein’ a
jumped-up liar. That’s my experience. But I’m
goin’ to tell you one little thing that’s worth
knowin’, bein’ able to prove it. Know that load’r
galvernised iron an’ things I took to Swift Creek
lars’ month ? Had ten ton up, an’ slush to the
hub right through. Well, I was crossin’ the
creek a few miles the other side Oassilis when I
got bogged. Had Bolliver an’ Briton leadin’ an’
Black Gin an’ Clipper in the pole, ten others
beside. S’pose you don’t deny my team can haul ?
Well, this burst they jest laid right down to it,
an’ pulled till you’d a-thought they’d yank the
crimson world all skew-wiff. I stirred ’em
up all I knew, an’ yelled like a maniac. It’s bad
business gettin’ stuck in that bit of creek. Pre-
sently I saw her coinin’, an’ I jest knocked hat-
fulls of hair offer them raw hides, an’ near bust
rneself cursin’. They brought her along beautiful
fer about fifty yards, an’ then I let up an’ called
spello. But when I turned round to take bearin’s,
strike me blind if there wasn’t that blanketty
blank waggon right there, jammed in the middle
of the gory creek. We hadn’t budged her a hinch.
I was knocked silly, right off me sanguinary
chump. Could ’a bet me life we’d shifted the load
a whole heap, an’ yet there it was in the same ole
shop, an’ the polers with their heels still in the
water. Well, I had another dig at it. Them red
uns of mine took a grip, an’ lifted with a long, low
heave that must ’a fetched this universe if some-
thin’ else hadn’t come. They was bringin’ her up
again beautiful, an’ I danced alongside fer a hun-
dred yards or so, an’ called on ’em till I was blue
in the face. Then we stood off agin an’ took

breath. Now, you can boil me whole if that gory
concern wasn’t stuck fast in the same spot—she
hadn’t budged outer the creek halfer foot. You
know me, I’m tough, but that thing made my
hair stick up stiff, an’ I fell a-tremblin’ like a kid.
Anyhow, 1 had another buck in at it after
a while. I near peeled those cattle, an’ I

Then I up an’ spotted what was happenin’.
Sure’s death we was towin’ that blanky creek
along. We’d pulled it a hundred and sixty-five
yards right out uv its course.”
The bullocky mopped his manly brow on his'
shirt-sleeve, reached for his beer and finished-it
at a gulp, and then concluded.
“ Had to unload an’ dig me waggon out. Ask
up at Oassilis if the creek ain’t gone off its course
’bout seven mile back.”
SILAS SNELL.
ONLY FOUR TO MAN THE PUMPS.
Dear, dear! When you come to think of it how
closely related things are ; how one thing b ings
up another. Ideas are like a lot of beads on a
string, aren’t they ?
A letter I have just been reading makes me i e-
member what happened to me one winter about
twenty years ago. The story is too long to tell
here, so 111 merely give you the tail-end of it. I
was supercargo on a bark bound fi om London to
Rio. A tremendous gale, lasting live days,
wrecked us. Forty-eight hours after it ceased
there were four men and no more left on the
vessel. The captain had been killed by a falling
spar, three of the crew washed overboard, and the
rest of the thip s company (save us four) went
away in the long-boat with the first and second
mates. We were taking in water through a leak
at the rate of six in lies an hour. Working with,
all our might the four of us could pump that out
in forty minutes, but we must do it every hour.
It was awful wo k. For two days we kept it up,
without sleep Then we stopped, took lo the
quarter boat and shoved off. The sea was quiet
—no wind. While we lay to within a mile of her
the ship threw up her no s e and went down stern
first. We were picked up the next day by a
Danish b ig.
Now the odd thing is that the letter that re-
minded me of that experience has nothing what-
ever to say about ships. Please help me to And
out the association
The lady who writes the letter says that in
July, 1881, she got a bad fright. Exac ly what it
was she doesn't tell. 1 wish she did. Anyway it
so upset her that she didn’t get over the effects of
it for nine years. After that her appetite fell off;
she lost all real relish for food, and what she did
eat only made trouble instead of nourishing her.
It gave her pain in the pit of the stomach and
(curiously enough) between the shoulders. She
says her eyes and skin presently turned yellow as
a but e.cup. lie. - face and abdomen swelled, and
her feet the same, the latier so much so that she
was obliged to have her shoes made larger.
“ I got little sleep at night,” she says, “ and was
in so much pain I had to be propped up with pil-
lows. For weeks together 1 could not lie down in
bed. I had a dry, hollow cough, and bad night
sweats. Then diarrhoea set in and my bowels'
became ulcerated. I was often in dreadful agony
for forty-eight hours at a time. Then I would
have a chill as though a bucket of cold water were-
poured down my back. I got so low I could no
longer sew, knit, or do any housework or look
after my children. My sister had to come ami
help in the house.
“ Everybody said 1 was in a decline and must
die. What I suffered for eight years tongue,
cannot toll. The doctor could do nothing for me.
lie said my complaint was complicated and bad to
deal with. In 1886 I wen tas an outdoor pa ient
to the Shrewsbury Infl marj, but only got
transient relief. ”
The writer is in good health now, but why did
her case remind me of the shipwreck ? Lei’sseitle
that first. The association is easy and natural.
Just see. The ship tank because we four men
hadn’t the strength to pump out the water as fast
as it came in. twenty men might have g..t her
into port. It is the last straw that breaks the
camel s back ; the last unsupplied need thaimakesr
poverty abject and desperate.
These bodies of ours carry the seeds of disease
with them all the time —chiefly the poisons created
by imperfect digestion, made worse by ca eless
habits. But as long as nothing extraordinary
happens we manage to scrape along in a half-and-
half sort of fashion. Yet we've got in on blood
the stuff that any of a dozen diseases is inade of,
only waiting for something to set it afire. While
the liver, kidneys, and lu.igs and skin keep us
fairly free —that is, don’t let the load get too heavy
—we say, “Oh, yes, I’m tolerably well, thank
you.” Little pains and unpleasant symptoms
bother us now and then, but we don’t fancy they
mean anything.
By-and-bye something happens. A cold, too
hearty a meal, a night of dissi ation, an affliction
through death or loss of property, a fright, as in
Mrs. Bunce’s case, &c. Over we go. The last
straw has crushed us. One loose spark has blown
up the barrel of powder. The crew is too small to
save the ship. The kidneys, liver, skin, a d
stomach strike work, and we must have help right ■
away or perish. All of which means tua expios.on
of latent indigestion and dyspepsia poisons in tao
blood.
There ! isn’t it plain why I thought of the ship 1
Now for the conclusion of the lady’s story. She
says: “In 1889 I first heard of Mother Soigors
Curative Syrup. Half a bottle made me feel
better, and by keeping on taking it 1 was soon
strong and well as ever. (Signed) Mrs, Ann
Bunco, The Park, Worthen, near Shrcwsbu.y,
February 22nd, 1893. ”
If there were only a way to save sinking ships
as certain and trustworthy as Mother Seigel’s
medicine is in the case of sinking human bodies,
what a blessing it would be to poor sailors.*
