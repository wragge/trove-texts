DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILD
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS. AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM,
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
THE BOOK WILL ALSO
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR.MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
t-o von ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

A Returned “ Loyalist.”
It is a sad and solemn reflection that Aus-
tralia has produced, at various times, perhaps
a dozen or so of the most utterly profound
political grovellers by whom the earth has
been infested this century or more. The art
of grovel cannot be altogether acquired ; it
is an inherited instinct which is afterwards
brought to perfection by much assiduous
culture and carefully acquired ignorance.
The perfect groveller is almost invariably the
man who has spent his whole life in one
narrow community, and to whom the whole
outside world is a blank. An absolutely
parochial individual has two alternatives
before him ; he becomes either a blatant and
offensive patriot who regards everything
beyond his own little sphere as utterly
mean, wretched, and beneath contempt ; or
else he developes into a servile worshinper of
foreign titles, foreign royalties, and foreign
opinions, for exactly the same reason that
the naked savage worships the thunder
because they are far off and more or less un-
known. Of this latter variety is that re-
cently returned globe-trotter, Mr. L F
Heydon, M.L.C. of New South Wales, who
last week delivered an oration before a
Sydney audience on the greatness, grandeur,
and absolute moral perfection of England’
the utter dependence of Australia upon that
far-otl island, the necessity of worshipping
it with all the mental horse-power of the
community, and the base ingratitude of
Republicanism, Federalism, and everything
that England doesn’t approve of. Mr.
Heydon is the ideal groveller. He belongs
to a narrow, soul-destroying profession ; he
is a member of a legislative body that is
bigoted, useless, and utterly selfish ; he has
never previously been outside Australia, and
all his youth and middle age have been spent
in acquiring a great, enduring ignorance of
everything beyond his own beaten track ;
and in all these ways he is eminently fitted
to be an Imperial Federationist of the worst
order. He is an Australian native - (he kind
of native which an inscrutable Providence
now and then inflicts upon every nation lest
it should become too much inflated, and his
country endures him as best it can without
repining.
* # •
Ihe central idea of Mr. Heydon’s philo-
sophy is that the British nation lives, not for
its own aggrandisement, or to accumulate
wealth for its own enjoyment, or to conquer
new lands and add them to its own terri-
tories, or to do anything whatsoever for its
own benefit— -its one desire is to help along
this continent, and all it- wants for itself is
the joy of paying the bill. Some British
confidence-man, realising that Mr. Heydon
was green and harmless, has evidently told
him in a burst of candour that Britain is the
one disinterested, pure, noble-minded, all-
wool nation upon this earth, and he has
taken it all in. Then he comes back to pour
it all out again upon his suffering audience
as follows :
.V lia b it occurred to me, are the objects abroad for
uo • Kurland strains her diplomacy and incurs all the
eav.y burdens of preparation for war? In the first place,
1,,, her diplomatic troubles at least arise over Esrypt.
Ihe national vanity of the great French nation is in-
E =-VPt and the Suez Canal. And France is
I looatrly if not certainly, the greatest military Power in
tne world She has the fleet next in importance to that
ot England, and it is from her shores alone that any in-
vasion of England could possibly succeed. Yet old Eii<«-.
lanil braves tier worst anger to maintain an absolute con-
trol over the Suez Canal. By cleverness and boldness, by
balancing the triple against the dual alliance, and by a
resolute intimation that, come what may, in no event shall
tie great waterway to the East pass out of her bands,
England holds a firm grasp on the gates of the Canal.
And for whom does she make this spirited stand ? Wbo
benefits by it? Jf Australia is ever to have a trade, if we
are to emerge (as we must, of course) from our baby state
ot slender population and feeble commerce, and take our
rank in the world as the colossal Britain of the Pacific
ami Indian Oceans, what route must our ships take to
Europe? And whom will it benefit more than us to have
i i .‘I 1 llal 'ds, absolutely free for every
h itish keel ? Would it suit us to have France or Russia
V c \ e \ ? e ! OS0 llie or overcharge our tonnage?
Aid this immense seivice old England does for us
p.oudly, independently, generously, and asks us not a
P3miy towards its great cost. What is the next object
II whicii England faces powerful foes and lavs heavy
burdens on her resources? India. And is it no advantage
o Australia that our nearest neighbour and most natural
°'stonier, a land of SOO millions of people, should be in
England s control. Should we be better off if a Russian
ukase might any moment bar all tier ports to any but
Russian trade? England’s activity in (he whole East, in
India Buniiah, perhaps Annam, and in Borneo and all
tne Indies, is of immense advantage to Australia
winning for us vast markets and most valuable customeis
in the future. As England faces France in Egypt for our
profit even more than her own, so in India she faces
Russm. Another sphere of England’s activity at present
is ttie East of Africa. We may hope that very much
indeed, if not the whole of the eastern half of that immense
continent, from the mouth of the Nile to Capetown may
ultimately be brought by English diplomacy, English
valour, L.nglish enterprise, and English money, under the
umhsputed sway of England. And here again we benefit.
If India and the East Indian isles are our nearest’neigh-
bour of all, East Africa is the next. From our position
it is immensely valuable to us that all the nearer side of
Alnca, equal to several Europes in magnitude, should be
assuredly free and open to our trade. The Suez Canal,
India and Eastern Africa, these are the objects of
England s efforts to-day, and they all concern ns even
more intimately than England. Yet sac asks us for not
one penny of aid. With her magnanimous mother’s pride
in us she pays ail and bears the burden alone.
* * #
And the sum of all this is that as Emdand
lives entirely for the sake of Australia, (here-
foie Australia should live entirely for the
sake of England in return and her one
desire should bo to be thought worthy of a
smile from that grand, old mother-land. Mr.
Heyden, like the majority of his kind, is
guiltless of history, geography, and common
sense. Ho docsn t even know, apparently,
that England started to hold India with all
her might and niatn many years before she
ever owned Australia, wherefore it may be
safely presumed she holds it now for exactly
the same reason as she did then—because
it is a profitable speculation according to the
eternal laws of her god, which is the Golden
Calf. Also, he is apparently unaware that
she holds Egypt, as everybody except Mr.
Heyden knows, as a bailiff in possession —to
collect the money for (hose greedy bond-
holders who rooked the indomitable, reck-
less, restless, pig-headed Khedive Ismail in
his old age, and induced him to play at a
species of three-card trick by which he was
cleaned out. England holds India bee a use
it pays to do so ; she keeps Eastern Africa
because it pays ; she retains Egypt because
that pays also, and because it helps her to
hold India ; and she “faces” Russia and
Fiance for exactly the same reason which
makes every dog that has a bone face the
other dog that wants to (tike the bone away.
Australia has no trade worth mentioning
with either India, Egypt or Eastern Africa,
and will have none for perhaps centuries.
They are all countries which produce almost
exactly the same materials as those pro-
duced in Australia, and unless we exchange
one lot of bananas and sugar for another
exactly similar Jot there is hardly any trade
to be done. Whether they are open to
commerce or not, whether they belong to
Britain or Russia or Gehenna, whether they
iomaili .as they are or vanish to the bottom of
the sea, makes no earthly difference to Aus-
tralia. If Britain fights for them on our
account, then it is a lost labour, a wasted and
deranged generosity, an utterly misplaced
benevolence, and a useless sacrifice, and Aus-
tralia can t be grateful over llie sacrifice, for
the ottering of the noble-hearted Britain is
just as valuable to her as three cheers are to
an alligator.
# * #
Also, there are several other points in
which Mr. Heydon is woefully incorrect.
His pathos about the dangers braved by
Old England is utterly superfluous;
England isn’t nearly so old as most of the
nations of continental Europe. Further
England whether old or otherwise—does
not “brave the worst anger” of France in
keeping the stolen principality of Egypt ;
France, as everybody knows, is watched on’
every hand by the Triple Alliance, and dare
not go to wtir with England because three
Great Powers and seven million soldiers
would straightway climb upon her'. To
brave the worst anger ” of a nation in so
tremendous a predicament is merely the
valour of a man who shakes his fist at a caged
lion. The Suez Canal is not in “British
hands ” in the sense Mr. Heydon implies—
it is in the hands of a private company of
French origin. There is no earthly reason
to suppose that France or Russia would
either “close the passage or overcharge our
tonnage ” —in any case our tonnage is over-
charged a good deal already, and, for that
matter, it is not ours but Britain’s own ton-
age, which fully accounts for the manner in
which she watches over it. Up to date,
Australia has no tonnage worth mentioning,
and when she has any Britain is as likely to
overcharge it as any other nation. The
statement that that future tonnage must
necessarily proceed through the Suez Canal
is an outrage upon geography ; it may go
cither via Cape Horn or the Cape of Good
Hope, and when the Nicaragua Canal is con-
stiuctei it will probably abandon Suez
altogether. The assertion that, next to
India, our nearest neighbour is Eastern
Africa, is another example of childlike
ignorance ; Tonquin, which Britain has
allowed to drift into French hands, is nearer
than India, and China is many hundreds
of miles closer than Africa at its nearest
point, and German New Guinea is more
adjacent than either. Therefore if Britain,
as alleged, is actuated chiefly by a desire for
Australia’s welfare she will let India and
Africa and Egypt all slide together, and hang
on with a frenzied grip to China, Tonquin,
A imam, German New Guinea, and the
French and Spanish colonies of New
Caledonia and the Carolines. Also the state-
ment that Britain asks “ not a penny of aid ”
is very much out of place considering that
that country has just traded oft’ upon us for
an exorbitant subsidy, a fleet of brown-paper
ironclads which are a by-word and a laugh-
ing stock in the realm of naval architecture.
# # #
These arc a few- only a few of the note-
worthy points in Sir. Heydon’s fearsome
outpouring. Among the others, he demands
that New' South Wales should, if necessary,
“go to some trouble and cost to impress
upon the world that she has no idea of
federating just now.” England, it seems,
doesn’t like Australia to federate. “The
pride and claim for equality from self-
asserting colonies grown to manhood’s
strength are distasteful to her,” and there-
fore it is solemnly requested that Australia
should stop growing lest the “ mother
country should led bad. Even The
Bulletin, whose opinion of Britain is in-
finitely lower than that of Mr. Heyuon,
M. L.C , declines to credit the British nation
with so utterly base and despicable a jealousy
as this, and the assertion that the progress
of another branch of her own race is “ dis-
tasteful to England is as mean a thing
as ever the meanest specimen of humanity
ever said of any people. Further, after-
asserting that Britain spends all her life in a
disinterested effort to advance Australia, the
escaped M.L.C. announces that the British
nation is “insular and narrow,” and takes
much more interest in a local baccarat
scandal than in any events which
take place outside the narrow range
of her own four seas. This statement
seems woefully inconsistent, considering
what went before, but one incongruity is of
no particular account among so many. Also,
the statement that England—again solely on
Australia s behalf—is even now “facing
powerful foes and laying heavy burdens on
her people on the Indian frontier, may be
briefly described as unmitigated folly, inas-
much as, up to the present date, the hard-
driven Emir of Afghanistan is facing the
said foes all by himself, and England isn’t
facing anybody, nor will she "be called
upon to do so till Afghanistan goes under ;
while, as for the “ burdens,” they are
laid upon the people of India, and
England takes nothing but the profits.
But all these historical and geographical
bungles are more derails ; the one ineffable
absurdity of the whole doctrine is the as-
sumption that there is, or ever was, or ever
will be a nation which does not devote itself
solely to an utterly selfish scramble for its
own aggrandisement. Mr. Heydon, M.L.C.,
is ob\ iously a human anomaly, inasmuch as he
seems to know less and to believe more than
any other man of the present age. It is a
noteworthy fact that such individuals as he
are always grown in cities. The utterly
credulous groveller is not a product of the
bush or the wilderness. It is only the man
who has sat looking for half a century at the
dead wall on the,other side of the street who
can become so hopelessly stunted in his in-
telligence and so narrow in his ideals that
he wants his country to stop growing lest it
should aggravate a small island at the other
end of the earth.
The Queensland Slave-Trade.
Rome of the Australian and South Pacific
clergy, let it he recorded to their credit, de-
nounce the Queensland (Jovernment’s proposal
to revive the infamous traffic in Polynesian
flesh-ami-blood. It is true that, of this minority
of “ white ’ parsons, a large proportion is
cynically credited with being personally and
financially interested in keeping the Kanakas
on the islands. Letting that pass, and rather
inclining to uot-too-dceply scrutinise the mis-
sionary claim that the main evangelising idea is
to utilise the islanders as labourers in “ the
Lom> s vineyard, instead of in the canefields of
the Queensland sugar-planters, there remains
still a large majority of professional Gospel-
sellers perched self-regardfnlly on the fence of
opportunism, who declare their joint and
several belief that, if “proper precautions”
against abuse are adopted, everything will bo
glad and gay for the recruited nigger, t
requires no polemical controversy, nor
it need any missionary arguments, to arrive aU
logical conclusion in this matter. A knowle'da
of human nature in its unutterable laws , c
evolution is quite sufficient for the punW
hirst, as to the islanders. What sort 0 f
ultimate development can—must—await peonies
robbed of the flower of their manhood, and ] G fr
to rely upon their senile and juvenile remnant
their ■weak and scanty womanhood’
What sort of fate awaits the departed manhood'
itsdf, kidnapped by artful strategy to a forei-m
country where much of it dies off with alarm-
ing rapidity, while the rest of it contracts
diseases which unman their victims for Hf e ?
•Nothing but appalling calamity can result to
the island-peoples, both as to the feeble
who remain and as to the vigorous who
are carried away by their white conquerors
as much conquerors as if they raided the
Polynesians by fire and sword and bore
on the balance left by rapine and open theft
then, as to the whites. All history blazons
with solemn warnings of the ultimate national
horrors consequent upon the placement of au
inferior and foreign race amongst a dominant
race which yet, being democratic, appends its
sign-manual to the ideality of human equality
Ihere can be no half-way-house between the
puiity of the race-standard and the recognition
of absolute slavery. If the dominant race be
slave-owning and slave-holding, it may be
abominable, but still logical. If it pretend to
glory in the abolition of slavery and in the
“scratch” equality of all manhood, and yet
impose labour conditions on coloured sections
of its population, it is both abominable and
ulogmah Nay, more ; it is in the very essence
of its boasted laws, in the very charter of its
■justice, hypocritical.

The newspapers tell that the Queensland
Government have received over 400 applica-
tions, many of them from young men who come
within the doleful designation “well-connected ”
for billets as Government agents in the black-
birding trade ; but that all appointments arc to
be made from the Civil Service, a boon f or
which the Service should be rebelliously un-
grateful. What possible breed of skimkhood
can applicants for this sort of dehumanising
occupation be ? Picture the life of a Queens
land Government Labour Agent—as we knew
him in the past, and as be will probably’ be to
the end of the chapter. A solitary unit on
board a small schooner, manned by man-
pouncers. He the sole representative in that
lloating family of—“ the Government.” He has
no authority whatever over the crew. If he
attempts to rigidly perform his duty to the
Government, and to be a sort of father-protector
to the Kanakas, he becomes obnoxious to the
captain, and to all whose interests are bound
up with the captain. Everybody on board but
the Government agent is there in the interests
ot t ie sugar-planter, and burns with a lust for
head-money. If the Government agent is
approachable on that side of his nature, all
goes well with his immediate comfort and sur-
roundings, and he is treated by the labour-
pirates as a decent comrade-trafficker-in-flesh.
If his integrity is proof against secret under-
standings, there is nothing on earth so easy as
to lose him accidentally in the Pacific, or on an
island. There is nothing for a just and well-
meaning Government agent to do throughout
the dreary voyage but drink, and the average
skipper’s whole energies are concentrated on
the task of making and keeping him drunk. In
nine cases out of ten, that result is achieved.
If an agent did not get drunk, and if
he returned safely to Queensland with
views of adversely reporting the vessel, there
might be found a whole crew ready to swear
that he was drunk all the time. So, as a rule
he docs get drunk. Shut out from all friendly
intercourse with those with whom he daily
mixes, he is only a man in a million who can
continually keep his mental balance and' Ids
moral integrity, and defy the combined captain
a,ml crew day after day. So the great majority
of Government agents cave in with a sigh,
accept ameliorated conditions, and drug their
consciences into liquid stupefaction. In short,
they must “ keep chummy ” with the captaim
Y hea one of these returns to some Queensland
slave-port, he and the captain go off together
on a drunken spree, it being the captain’s ashore
policy to keep paired with him, lest an irrigated
system might betray a loosened tongue. What
time the agent sits in the hotel parlour, with
bloodshot eyes and incandescent breath, and tells
hallowing talcs of Inst and blood and piracy by
land and sea, until the mind qf the listener sees
red shambles and piled-up, bleaching Golgothas.
I hen the agent tapers oft into delirium tremens,
breaks hotel mirrors, prowls along passages
clad only in a shirt and socks, and flees over
balconies to escape from imaginary demons.
Such was the Queensland Government’s South
Sea labour-agent as \vc knew him at homo.

I hat -the Kanaka proposals of cx-Wilrer-
iorce Griffith deliberately recognise slavery
as a legal institution is capable of being logi-
cally argued, and recent cablegrams inform that
this aspect of the question is being brought
before the British House of Commons by direct
resolution. Ibe following communication
relates to the same aspect of the “trade”:—
Dear Bult.ktin,—The main argument by which the
Ouikkilwraitii Government (Q.) endeavours to excuse its
Kanaka .kidnapping is that the imported n hirers are hy
a "j .eesh ictod to field-work." When any Government
prohibits any section, class, or race of its subjects from
performing any particular I.ranch of honest and lc»al
lal.our, are not the members of that section, class or race
so penal sed necessarily made hy statute-law actual and
confessed slaves t If any subject is hy law forbidden
to do, under any and nil circumstances, somethin"
winch is admittedly legal, right, honest, and honour-
able, then that subject il a : slave) both in fact
and ui law. Griffith's Kanakas are forbidden to
do any honest work except in the field. They
come within my definition, and are slaves both in fact and
in law. Gnu’kit 11 s Polynesian Act therefore legalises
slavery. lut slavery has been declared illegal hy British
Q" s which hold good in this-country. Therefore,
the Griffith Polynesian Act is itself illegal: or, alterna-
tively, those clauses relating to the restriction of Kanakas
to field work are illegal. If the whole Act is illegal, then
it cannot repeal the former Act which abolished Poly-
nesian labour. If only the “restriction” clauses are
illegal, then the Griffith argument about “field-
work only is ft fraud, a lie, a hypocrisy of
,]uigqn, and Kanakas may ho employed indis-
criminately hy planters, farmers, squatters, vtine-
onnuis, manners, manufacturers, merchants, store-

sent conditions) decide it?—l am, &c., Tim D.

An Economical Government.
Tins is the era of rigid economy in. Queensland.
few weeks ago a labourer employed on the
Western line fell ill—his illness started on the
evening of the 25th day of the month —and two
days later he died and went, probably, to a
better land —anyhow, it would be hard to find
a worse one to go to. His wages, at the rate of
7s. a day, were paid monthly, and in the
ordinary acceptation of the term he was a
monthly servant. Therefore, his official superior,
as a matter of course, made out the voucher, on
behalf of the widow, for the ordinary month’s
pay, but on that bereaved woman applying for
the 'money she was informed that the Commis-
sioners had disallowed the amount, and would
pay only to the exact date when the deceased
quitted work. They not only docked the
mid three days of the month after his death,
but stopped the two days which he spent in
dying, and by this act of economy they saved
about 355. to the consolidated revenue, and left
a poverty-stricken widow and a bereaved family
£1 15s. poorer. Yet the deceased was as legally
a monthly servant as any pompous official in a
Government office at Brisbane, and no such
mle was ever applied to the defunct clerk in
the Lands Office or the Colonial Secretary’s
department. The Commissioners who perpe-
trated this piece of small and grovelling
economy were the same crowd who, only
a few days previously, fooled away many
pounds in providing a special train to
convey the Hon. Horace Tozer and his
female friends, relations, and hangers-on to
Tcntcrfield show because that inflated beadle
was too important to travel in an ordinary
train along with the common herd who paid his
salary. And the Parliament which tacitly
sanctioned it was the same Parliament which
recently voted huge grants to the widows of
two public servants who had drawn large
salaries for many years, and whose pay was not
stopped for the time they wasted in dying.
When a Government of the Griffith order
enters on a course of rigid economy it always
goes on one fixed principle, which is to grab
355. from some starving widow, and then grant
£lOOO to some wealthy individual who has
already more than enough, and finally to go on
a champagne burst in a special train in order to
celebrate the saving of the 355. already men-
tioned. Then it “ goes to the country ”on its
retrenchment policy, and the chances are about
even that it gets another term of office on the
strength of it.
Hanging Under False Pretences.
The question put to the jury who tried
“Williams” was, in effect, “Is this man as
sane as the average murderer who goes to the
gallows?” and the eleven citizens in the box,
many of them kindly-looking persons, decided
that Williams was comparatively a healthy
subject for judicial destruction. 'They even
went so far as to declare that no future revela-
tions, tending to suggest the physical im-
probability of this murderer being fit to sit
upon a jury, would or could change their con-
viction that he was fit to be hanged. Probably
they didn’t deny in their hearts that he miyht
be a homicidal maniac, but they were uncon-
sciously endorsing the sentiment of Crown-
Prosecutor Walsh (a sentiment fitted only
for the court and era of a Judge Jeffrey s
or a Judge Norbury), viz., that the state of
prisoner’s brain could be best settled at a post-
mortem. Judge Hodges, one must admit,
made out a strong case for the gallows, in a
weak, halting address. He pounded away
clumsily at the clumsy old law, by which a
murderer’s complete responsibility for his crime
lies in his knowledge of right from wrong, and
hastily dismissed the theory that Avilful wrong-
doing, on impulse or premeditation, may be
inspired by a diseased patch in the human
brain pulp. Henceforth Hodges cannot con-
scientiously admit kleptomania in the case
of a Avell-to-do female, avlio sneaks a bit of goods
from a draper’s counter, and hides it under her
sealskin jacket to escape detection. Also, he
Avill have to protest that a score of reprieved
lunatics, avlio, Avitbin his oavii recollection, have
established their sanity by the pains they took
to commit a cold-blooded murder Avithout leav-
ing a clue (such as Constance Kent), ought to
be hanged forthAvith. According to the law,
the sanest of all murderers must be he avlio
certifies to his knoAvledge of right from wrong
by giving himself up to a policeman imme-
diately after the fell deed is done, yet the self-
accused assassin always gels the gentlest
summing-up. The laiv,Which is an instinctive
humbug, does not religiously maintain the in-
fallibility of the crude “ right from Avrong
test. In fact, it is difficult to pin the murder
law doAvn to any fixed principle, except, per-
haps, the principle that an artful, lying homi-
cide is more guilty than his candid brother
culprit. If the devil that possesses Williams,
the slayer of his oavii children, had, in a
spirit of mischief, prompted him to con-
fess his murders before the last one was
discovered, he would probably be languish-
ing in a lunatic Avard instead of a con-
demned cell at this very minute. Now, the
fact that he didn’t so confess, and Avasn’t likely
to, has no bearing on his knowledge of right
from Avrong, yet it places him beyond all hope
of mercy from the luav. Because A illiams is
an animal, treacherous, remorseless, with a
limited capacity for cunning and a shallow
instinct of self-preservation, he is presented to
the jury as an ordinary fellow-man and judged
accordingly. By sentencing him to death on
the ground that he is a sane human being guilty
of murder, the luav insults our common
humanity, and the Judge practically argues
that he himself might be just such another beast
if he Avcre not afraid of the galloAVS* i Imt s
where the law is a humbug. It hangs Williams
under false pretences. The statutes should
have allowed Justice Hodges to ask the jury
whether they would hang the creature in the
dock as a man or an animal, and they would
have found him guilty under the animal clause.
Then the world at large could exult over the
execution of Williams, withqut trying to
believe that this particular instance of capital
punishment was justified by any higher moral
consideration than justifies the shooting of a
mad dog.
The Case of Thomas Suffielcl.
After a lengthy period of consideration the
Law of New South Wales, as embodied in Mr.
R. E. O’Connor, Minister of Justice, has con-
firmed the conviction of Thomas Suffused,
sentenced in April, 1891, to 10 years’ penal
servitude on one of the most vague and shadowy
charges of criminal assault ever heard before an
Australian court. The evidence against Suf-
field consisted of one woman’s absolutely un-
supported assertion, and nothing more. No one
saw the alleged crime committed ; there was
no collateral evidence to prove that the
prisoner had been at or near the place
where it was committed ; and on the
other hand, some half - dozen witnesses
swore positively that he was in quite a different
place at the time of the disaster. The weight
of evidence was, according to legal authority,
altogether in favour of the acquittal of the
prisoner, but nevertheless the jury convicted
him, as the usual maudlin jury nearly always
does in such cases. The average juryman is
actuated at these times by a certain muddled
feeling that the wives and daughters of the
community will be endangered if the base
ruffian in the dock is allowed to get away scot-
free, and in bis thick-headed indignation he
seldom stops to consider whether he has got hold
of the right base ruffian or the wrong one. Con-
sequently, no prisoner is ever convicted on such
utterly untenable evidence as the one who is
charged with offences of this description. It
was Suffield’s further misfortune that Judge
Windeyer, of Mount Rennie notoriety, was on
the bench at his trial, and being found guilty
he was promptly crushed with a sentence of
10 years. Then, the case being carried before
the Minister for Justice, that individual con-
firmed the Judge’s decision, and explained him-
self as follows : _____
She may or may not be mistaken in identifying the
prisoner as the man who ravished her, hut that she was
ravished by some man, and that she honestly believes that
that man was the prisoner lam convinced. In my view
of the case, therefore, the only question about which the
jury could have hesitated was the identification of the
prisoner. The sole evidence of identification was that of
the prosecutrix , without corroboration of any kind, but
clear and positive. The defence of an alibi was set up by
the prisoner, and several witnesses gave evidence in sup-
port of it. The jury, after careful consideration disbe-
lieved the defence and believed the prosecutrix. Under
these circumstances I am asked to direct an inquiry under
section 353 of the C. L. Amendment Act of 1883, upon the
facts alleged in the declarations herewith. It is altogether
beyond my province to direct a re-hearing of evidence
already given. That evidence has already been decided
upon by the jury. To review their decision upon a new
inquiry into the same evidence, would be to make a private
Ministerial inquiry a Court of Appeal from the decision of
a jury, a thing which the section never intended. It is
only where some material fact or circumstance, not before
the jury at the trial, has been brought before the Minister
that the latter is justified in directing an inquiry. His
Honor Mr. Justice Wisdkyer has, I think, defined very
clearly and accurately the scope and purport of such
an inquiry. I may say at once that in this case l
have been very favourably impressed with the prisoner’s
previous character, the general estimation in which he
had been held by those who knew him, the entire absence
of anything like concealment or shuffling at the time of
his arrest, his frank, open manner all through in dealing
with the police. Being so impressed, and knowing that
the conviction of this man rests upon the uncorroborated
evidence of one witness, I should have been glad to have
had placed before me any new fact bearing upon the
identification of the prisoner or the credibility of (he
prosecutrix upon which I could have granted an enquiry.
There are sundry damning admissions in this
document. Mr. O’Connor points out cheerfully
that the prosecutrix may have been mistaken,
which simply means that, to Mr. O’Connor’s
own knowledge, it is just a toss-up whether an
innocent man isn’t doing 10 years in gaol on an
utterly false charge. He admits that there
was only the woman’s bare assertion on one side
against the prisoner’s assertion and that of
half-a-dozen witnesses on the other. And he
acknowledges that he is “ favourably impressed
with the prisoner,” after which he winds up
with the statement that “ the verdict the jury
arrived at after a careful hearing of evidence in
open court, must stand.” Which should mean,
if words mean anything, that Minister O’Con-
nor believes, in his inmost heart, that the
prisoner is innocent, but that he must stay in
gaol as a sacrifice to certain legal precedents
unless some new facts come to light. If all the
available evidence has been already found, and
the jury has disregarded it in utter defiance of
common sense, and the principle of giving the
accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt,
then the case is beyond redress. Let us
charitably presume that Minister O’Connor is
a diplomatist, and is leaving the matter to the
public.

The New South Wales Municipalities Act
Amendment Act, fathered by Pigott, M.L.C.,
gives municipal corporations power to enforce
all arrears of rates due on any property against
the present occupant of that property, and not
only applies to all cases occurring after the
passage of the Act, but is retrospective. In
dozens of N.S. W. municipalities, there are
scores of properties that are 10, 20, 30, and
inore years in arrears of rates ; yet which have
changed hands several times. Under the en-
forcement of Pigott’s Act, this sort of history
is being continually revealed Crabb got hold
of a township allotment of land 30 years ago, and
never paid any rates. He was often sued, and
verdicts cast against him, but he took no notice
whatever and had no chattels on which dis-
traint could be made. Later, Grubb came
along and bought from Grabb for £5O. Mean-
time Pigott got his Act through. Since then,
land values having declined, Grubb wants to
sell to Grobb for £4O, but finds that, ere he
can do so, he must pay up all the arrears of
rates. Grobb knows that ha will otherwise be
liable for those arrears ami naturally insists on
this point. Grubb finds tlnn [he arrears amount
to £45. If he now sells to G'uouu he will lose £<>
in hard cash aswell as the £lO deferred loss on his
purchase. It. would actually pay Grubb better
to hand over the land gratis to anybody. All
this is a grand movement onwards towards the
coming day when land-ownership shall cease,
but it’s very hard upon Grubb, in the mean-
time. If Pigott’s Act had let the past rates-
evaders escape, and had started fair from its
own birth, the majority of the evils sought to
he cured would have been sufficiently remedied
in the case of most corporations.

Grab Bulletin, — The class which thinks that
Government ought to reward thrift, fixity, and
kindred virtues with an extra vote does not act,
as a rule, as if it were desirable that these
virtues should he recognised in the working
class. On the contrary, at every opportunity
the workers tire scattered broadcast over the
land. Here in Maoriland, after the maritime
defeat of ’OO, hundreds of families had to leave
their homes because work in the district was
denied them. These homes were the only set-off
against years of work and economy, and when
they w’ere lost the only proof of the builders’
thrift was gone. Then, lest they might become
“ fixtures ” elsewhere, the names of many of
the men were scut all over the country, so that
some of them, after travelling over 400 miles,
were told that the Masters’ Association would
not allow them to he employed. Not long ago
an employer of labour, alluding to some dis-
missed employes, said ; “ Nothing like keeping
the -s travelling. ” This policy seems much
in favour, and lias been ruthlessly enforced by
the leading companies. Let us hope that the
meditation allowed by idleness and travelling
may suggest a remedy.—C.o.o.
<j>
Murderer Deeming requests that his brain
he handed to the doctors for examination.
A similar request from murderer Colston
was refused. The official refusal was, in
The Bulletin’s opinion, worthy only of
Dahomey. It is a coincidence that both
Colston and Deeming suffered from the same
disease—which so helps to fill the lunatic
asylums and so often leaves physical traces in
the brain. Does the Victorian Government fear
the knock-down blow wdiich would he given to
capital punishment by the possible discovery of
visible disease in the convict’s brain ? Do they
fear such an occurrence as that wdiich took
place a few years ago at Deniliquin, New South
Wales, where a medical commission reported
concerning the mental condition of two con-
victs, both of whom it adjudged sane ? One
was a solitary crank who, enraged by some
children of whom he was the constant butt,
killed one with his axe. The other was a
horse-thief, who, a few days after the Grown
doctors had testified to his sanity, proceeded to
demonstrate the fallibility of human judgment.
He escaped the gaol, and drowned himself in
the Edwards River, whereupon a local doctor
sawed open his skull and found in his brain a
w-alnut-sized tumour. While we hang people,
let us dare to say why we hang them. If we
hang people whom many of our foremost
scientists suspect to he lunatics, let us say w T e
hang them merely because it is inconvenient to
keep them. The Government which, through
fear of its judgment being impeached, refuses
to allow' a dead criminal’s brain to be examined
in the interests of truth and justice and the
human race, is not much less mean than the
inhuman monster who, after assassinating
those of his own flesh, cements the carcases
under a hearthstone to shut out daylight and
baffle the officers of the law.
King Billy’s Conversion.
(FOR THE BULLETIN, BY "IRONBARK.")
King Billy was a Myall black
Of very early type,
He never used a handkerchief
Ilis royal nose to wipe ;
And he wore no sort of clothes at all
Except a short clay pipe.
lie had no sceptre and no crown,
Or anything of worth,
But he’d paint and grease himself and stalk
The land that gave him birth,
As proud as if he owned the lot
From Moreton Bay to Perth.
His palace was a gunyah built
Of boughs and bark of trees,
It smell of fish and ’possum-skins,
And dogs, and swarmed with 11er.3;
And so did Billy and his gin—
Her Highness, if you please !
He never, like some husbands, wore
His hat and boots to bed ;
But he’d lots of quaint, domestic ways
And playful tricks instead,
And he used to bang his lubra with
A “ yam-stick ” on the head.
He loved to hurj/his boomerang—
His simple joy s were few—
He mercilessly massacred
The “ old-man ” kangaroo,
And knocked from off the highest trees
The screeching cockatoo.
He snuffed the desert breezes like
The poet’s “ Arab steed ” ;j
Though rankest fumes of “ Barrett's twist ’
He much preferred, indeed.
On snakes, and almost anything - ,
IBs Majesty would feed.
He loved (a very long way off)
The battle’s noisy din,
When “ nullah nullah ” blows were struck
About some erring gin ;
But ’possums, grubs, and carpet-snakes
He simply revelled in.
He loved the forest free—the scent
Of wattle and of gum—
But, better far than all, he loved
His senses to benumb,
And fill his Royal person to
The teeth with Queensland rum !
He used to shock the mission folks ;
The missionary’s spouse
The monarch’s sense of modesty
Attempted to arouse,
But she didn’t meet with much success
As every one allows.
The Re\ erend Blobs, he merely yearned
King Billy’s soul to save ;
His wife’s supreme ambition was
To teach him to behave
With decency—wear pantaloons,
And wash, arid comb, and shave.
She thus resolved, although, of course,
She knew she had her work
Cut out, to make hi u “ titivate,
And dress, and come to kirk
An idiliee Hi" King was wont
Persistently 10 shirk.
'Twas thus that at the Mission-house
Arose a friendly strife,
Each seeking to induce the king
To change his mode of life,
A Christian feud sprung up betwixt
The parson and his wife.
They oft discussed the means of grace
For this most graceless dog :
And, touching these same ways and means,
They often came to “ log-
Gerheads,” for Blobs had faith in prayer,
llis wife had faith in “ prog !"
So, woman-like, she first attacked
The monarch’s weakest part
(She felt convinced he’d neither srul,
Nor conscience, mind, nor heart),
And she invoked the goddess cf
The culinary art.
She tempted him with promises
Of “ budgeree tuck out”—
That’s “pigeon-talk” for pigeon pie,
Boast goose, and bottled stout,
And caviare, and all that gives
An alderman the gout.
Che tempted him with choice preserves
Of apple, peach, and plum ;
And stilton cheese and tinned sardines
She even promised rum !
If he to church next Sabbath-day
(Full-dressed, of course) would conic.
Then Billy murmured “ budgerc-,”
And “ y.ohi,” meaning, “yes;”
He promised Christianity',
In future, to profess,
And, for his stomach’s sake, adopt
The vanity of dress.
Then Mrs. B. was filled with glee,
Her breast with triumph throb; l ,
She sent the king a stove-pipe hat —
The kind that’s worn by nobs—
Coat, vest, and pants that once adorned
Tlie sainted form of Blobs.
It’s true that Blobs’s pantaloons
Were thinned with fervent prayer—
He’d sat them into holes behind,
And almost everywhere—
But she patched, and darned, and thought they’d fit
The monarch to a hair.
When Billy saw the parson’s slops
He didn’t like the same,
For he knew he’d have an awful job
To fit them on bis frame,
But lie thought of “ budgeree tuck-ou!,”
And rum, and courage came.
He thrust his arms right through the 1c,3
Of Blobs’s pants at first,
Then tried to button them behind
His nock until they hurst;
Then, over all, he tried to put
The coat, and failed, and curst.
He couldn’t make things meet b( fora,
Nor fasten right behind ;
His savage limbs were ne’er before
So cabined, cribbed, conljned,
And so, the monarch’s wrath was roused,
With fury he was blind.
He wrenched his sinewy arms from out
The missionary’s bags;
Unwound the coat-tails from his legs.
And tore the lot to rags,
And hurled them in the river-bed
Among the rocks and snags !
’Twas Sunday morn—the clang of bells
Upon the air arose—
The pious Blobs walked forth to preach
(Mis mind in calm repose),
Nor dreamt that in the scrub the king
Was wrestling with his clothes.
The settlers churchward wend their way,
In prayer to bend their knees ;
The music of the mission bell
Was borne upon the breeze,
And smote upon the monarch’s car
Amid the mulga trees.
He heard and, jamming on his head
The missionary’s tile,
Stalked calmly to the mission-house
And, with a tranquil smile
Of smuggest self complacency,
Meandered down the aisle 1
The missionary’s daughter was
About to play the symph-
ony ; you’d really think they’d tried
To vaccinate the nymph,
And used some efficacious kind
Of dynamite for lymph.
She got a glimpse of Billy from
The corner of her eye ;
L’.ie hounded from the music-stool
Three feet or so on high.
And fainted in some person’s arms
Who happened to be nigh.
The panic-stricken worshippers
Took several kinds cf fits ;
Some draw their robes of righteousness
Around themselves and “gits,”
And some, in stolid wonderment,
Within their sittings sits.
Then, with a rush, through exit doors
They all commenced to cram ;
Saints jostled sinners in the aisle—
The non-elect said “ Dam
And Billy stood there all the while
As solid as a clam.
Describe, indeed, that wild stampede,
I can’t, ’twould fill a tome,
For no one ever seemed to know
How he or she got. home —
Except the king, and, supperlcss,
The bush he had to roam.
For weeks, within the mission-house,
There was domestic strife:
The missionary wept, and prayed—
The missionary’s wife
Has had enough of royalty
To last her all her life.
Of her civilising talents she
May be a little vain,
She may try them on a Cossack, or
A brigand chief from Spain,
But she'll never try to civilise
A myall black again!

816 Macquai'ie-strcct North, Sydney, May 11,1502
•Mv Dear Sloorabinda, —
Being so accustomed to entertaining crowds of people
whom they don’t know from Adam was perhaps the
reason why the captain and officers of the Orient Co.’s
huge, new and magnificent mail steamer R.M.S. “ Ophir ”
made such an easy success of their ball on board, on 4th
mst., when they presumably had chosen their own
Usitors. The “ Ophir (named after the gold mines of
old) is a very swell lug indeed, the walls of the first
saloon being, perhaps, too lavishly adorned to please the
peaceful passenger who doesn’t want to exactly live in a
transformation scene, and even a Frenchman said to me
that there was too much gilding. Round the walls are
golden statuettes of the wise virgins, put there, I sup-
pose, with a view to moral effect on the female passenger
with gold-washed hair and fifteen tea-gowns. The Agent-
General and Mr. Devil t received their 400 guests in the
drawing-room ; dancing was carried on in the first saloon,
and indeed everywhere where two persons could find
room to twirl; and a chrysanthemum decorated supper,
<i la carte, was served with true marine hospitality in the
second saloon. *
E\erybody was. there—Captain Chum ley representing
Government House ; Paul Blouet, literature ; Signor Fob,
music; and I—well, Beauty and Tub Billetix. There
were some very graceful frocks. Madame Blouet wore
sea-green bengaline artfully mingled with fine black lace,
posies of crimson and yellow roses ; Mdlle. was a charm-
ing contrast in pale-pink silk and chiffon ; Miss Burde-
kin’s white satin duchesse trimmed with fine cream lace
and chiffon, and gold galon was very well cut; Mrs. S. A.
Joseph wore pale-blue and pink brocade combined with
blue and pink chiffon and pink roses; Miss Colland
sported the same contrast very becomingly ; Miss Throck-
morton, in scarlet trimmed black lace and jet, is too
young to carry a posy of autumn leaves ; the Misses
Dight wore white gowns and silk and crepon respectively
and successfully ; Miss Austin’s black satin and velvet
was too dowager-ish altogether ; Miss Ada Fosbery com-
bined grey and pink like an artist; Miss Manning was
there in white striped brocade with tulle waterfall and red
poppies in her hair. Lady limes and her daughter wore
black, the latter’s net skirt edged with green velvet; Mrs.
Alfred Bennett, black brocade and white silk veiled in
black lace. Posies were very much worn—so were pretty
faces, too, for the matter of that.
Max O’Rell’s rather superficial pow wow on “ Brother
Jonathan” proved good bait for “society,” and “lady-
ships ” and “ honourables ” (“ within the colony ”) were
as plentiful as hairs on a horse, “The best people, my
dear, didn’t arrive with much velocity at the “John
Bull” lecture, because that entertaining expose was
more or less of a personal matter to Potts Pointers who
bad been home and Englished, if I may invent the
brevity. But to hearken to Uncle Sam’s weaknesses was
quite another tiling, though the lecture held out one or
two critical allusions to British institutions which made
the front row petrify where it sat. When the lecturer
alluded to “German princes to whom John Bull gives
out door relief,” you could actually see Lady Rose Ray’s
spine stiffening. One thing I noticed—that Jinx O'Rell
cleverly identifies his accent with that of the nation In s
yarning about He is Scotch in “Sandy,” American in
Brother Jonathan, and if lie had criticized Egypt X
suppose he would have lectured in hieroglynhics at
advanced prices with R. S. Smythe disguised as an in-
terpreter.
In “Jack Sheppard ” (much abridged vocally) at Her
Majesty’s, on Saturday, the most noticeable things were
that the fair Billee Barlow (in a Jersey wig) never had
what we might call a Marion-Burton-fit in breeches,
and that Rosa Conroy was painfully shy of her grey satin
knickerbockers in the first act, and seemed to hunger for
one petticoat at least, though she seemed to get more
used to ’em later on. Jack Sheppard isn’t what one
would call a ward-robey spectre, but Billee cuts a lively
figure in a scarlet-and-gold coat and doeskin breeches,
and leaves a good final impression when she dismounts
(Billee is always dismounting near the footlights, by the
way) from a donkey-shay in a mulberry satin-coat and
sea-green continuations ; also, Edilh Vane’s bridal dress
of white brocade, silver, and pearls wasn't the sort of
thing I could imagine myself at the altar in, but which
looked very nice indeed, relatively. By the way, there
ought to be rules in all dressing-rooms restricting song-
and-dance ladies to half-a-pound of carmine on” either
jowl because then Lilian Davis wouldn’t come forth so
fatally like a Glebe Point tram-signal. Miss D. should
also try to manage her petticoats more adroitly in her
“skirt dance,” for it really isn’t a skirt-dance at all when
yourflutteringpettlcoatisbehavinglikewashingonawindy
day. In a genuine Letty-Lindskirt-dance the garment has
most of the “fat”—if it hasn’t you are simply a pas
seul-ist figuring about with more clothes on than usual.
Billee B. got one spontaneous and one mechanical
bouquet. The first fell flop from the gods.
Will it become de riyueur, I wonder, for the friends of
Ihe lady-respondent to hand her flowers on the conclusion
of the suit, as happened the other day at Brisbane, when
Mrs. Crossley was given a large bouquet of white flowers
on leaving the court with a verdict in her favour? From
"bat 1 hear of the case, Sir. C. wanted to shake off his
bonds, and Mrs. C. was accused of what the court says
she never did ; under such circumstances, if wasn’t a bad
public effect to hand her vegetables of blameless white-
ness, although it is evident that the lady’s friends were
quite su(’2j* about the matter long before the verdict, for
they must have arranged that tribute in advance! But
what a fearful thing if, after the emblems of purity had
been theatrically arranged in such a case, the court should
find their intended recipient guilty ! In that event. 1
presume the flowers would have to be surreptitiously
smuggled out of court, or gracefully handed over to the
“old man” as the innocent of the deal. But, after all, it
wouldn’t be a bad idea if the crowd in court showed how
its opinion went by handing bouquets to fair divorcees.
At bite might mean public acquittal —mixed flowers for
mixed opinions, while red would embody her social comjf,
of course. The custom would make divorce cases far more
poetical and picturesque.
This Brisbane divorce incident somehow recalls an
American story I once read. The relatives of a just-
deceased woman were consulting the undertaker about
the coffin-trimmings. “ For an unmarried woman,” said
the man of plumes and “ weepers,” “ you must have
white trimmings ; for a married woman, heliotrope ones.”
They said nothing hut went away. By and bye, the
undertaker got a note: “ Picass put on white trimmings,
with a dash of heliotrope.”
The latest sue jessfui adventuress of tho type of Sydney’s
well known “Clara ’ is said to constantly travel between
Sydney and Adelaide on the mail-boats, and to make
excellent business out of tho passengers, especially the
bald, unctuous traveller with a gold cable watch-chain
looped across and a black silk travelling cap. Of course,
she lias an infinity of aliases, hut recently she represented
herself as the daughter of a well-known captain in the
Orient Co.’s service, and attributed her untrammelled
actions to pa’s neglect. Which fable ultimately bowled
her out, for somebody whom she had impressed too
favourably with her story officiously wrote to the Orient
Co. abusing Captain Blank for letting his daughter roam
about the Pacific. The Orient Co. took it up, and Ihert
of course, tire lady had to suddenly discover that she was
a niece of Lord Jersey, or something like that. She is a
stylish, handsome woman, much-bejewelled, and gifted
with phenomenal cheek. At the saloon table one day she
sat right opposite a gentleman from whom she had stolen
a shirt, wearing a fetching blouse made out of the self
same garment.
And, apropos of adventuresses, “ Clara,” now in prison
at Melbourne, made a bigamous marriage with a young
Sydney Scotchman, who will be worth some thousands in
the sweet by-and-hy. He would he / mourning tils folly
(she represented herself as Lady Carington’s sister, and
they were married after ten days acquaintance) to this
moment had it not been for a smart Sydney lawyer who
bully-ragged the woman into a confession of a pre-
existent spouse, and got him out of the web. Max
O’Bell, who preaches that a Scotchman never made an
unequal bargain in his life, ought to prayerfully peruse
this par.
Harping about the female portion of sea-going passenger-
lists, I remember one lady (a Southern doctor’s ex-wife,
by the way, for he has divorced her) who came out on a
mail-boat and was a source of continual worry to the
gallant captain owing to her over-proof flirtations.
Indeed, so recklessly did she s’amuse that the captain
had her followed after sunset, and whenever she settled
down with a kindred (male) soul, there did a myrmidon
bang a glaring light! She was turned off the ship qt
Adelaide because, I s’pose, the electric-light gave out.
The doll-and pincushion contest, in aid of Mr. Paling’s
Carington Centennial Hospital, commences its wild career
on 13th. inst. There are to be more exciting noveltie
than mere stalls; two teams of Sydney amateurs give
dramatic performances. A remnant of the Southern
amateurs, including Mr. F. Wood house, Mr. R. O. Todd>
and the Misses Galbraith, are to play “Mr. X,” an entirely
new farce introduced to them by George Fat Fortescue.
And there is to be a dog in tire piece.
Sydney Liedertafel hold their sixty-second concert in
Centennial Hall on 18th. inst. Foli, Harley and Bertha
Rossow are engaged to assist at a figure which makes the
managerial appeal for more subscribers at £1 11s. Cd. per
head seem quite a necessary financial step.
Now that ex-Mayoress BUrdekin is back from Europe
people would like to know whether the Governesses’
Home-question—which got so far as circulars in 1890—will
l>e opened up again? Mrs. Burdekin was very keen about
the Home before she went away, and she has only to
convene a meeting to set the necessary scheme in work-
ing order in no time.
It is under existing social arrangements quite out of the
question for governesses to reside at “Homes” where
domestic servants are also entertained, so boarding-
houses, either doubtful or dear, are the only resort for an
unemployed teacheress. I lately heard of one governess
who patronised a Home of the mixed sort from which she
and the new cook were engaged by the same employer oh
the same morning. As a result, Cookie meets her a day
or two later on the stairs with “Good niornin’, Miss
Blank, it’s a lot more comfortable here than at old
Mother ’s, ain’t it ?”
Apropos of nothing, it occurs to me that when the ex-
pounder of any religion escapes and tells fancy stories of
what’s found behind the altar, it would be just as well if
the heads of that faith chained up all their unctuous,
rolling-eyed disciples until he goes away and left only the
pale, thin lipped ascetics free to do the Block. What do
you think ?
If you ever happen to be socially entertaining a China-
man you should be careful, as a woman, to wear decorous
clothing, even if yon are giving him a ball. Up North—
at a time when Chinese big stores were attracting the
attention of the wholesale aristocracy it was deemed good
business for Mr. Softgoods to invite Mr. Confucius to his
house, and at first he was an attractive novelty, especially
when he turned up in full war-paint. But one evening at
a swell party, with .Madame billowing between a belt and
shoulder-straps, Mr. Hong Kong stole up to her gentiv,
and, tapping her lightly beneath her diamond necklace
with his fan, said enthusiastically; “My word ! you welly
fine woman, Missee Dash—my ciontiyman velly fon’ fine
woman allee same as you. Me thinks so too.” Mrs. S-
added another button to her frock next time John was
invited.
The outline of most male singers of note whom one goes
forth to identify has led me to the conclusion that
vocalism should he the very last resort of the dude. The
exercise of singing, as it naturally suits a woman's style
better than a man’s, also exerts a far more favourable
physical effect on my sex then it does on t’other. I
gather so much—as I said before—from outline. The
singing woman is usually rewarded with a bust that is the
envy of every flat-chested female who hails her; hut the
sterner songster—well, he achieves embonpoint, too, hut
it is below the waistband. In the masculine a big voice is
synonymous with a big waistcoat, but, of course, there
are exceptions—Foil, for instance, who looks like a bean-
pole growling its simple lay.
1 am told that an up-country S.A. Civil-servant, who
mysteriously left his office to take care of itself regularly
every Monday, was sought for at home by somebody ol>
business. The door was opened by the inevitable enfant,
terrible, who cheerfully uncorked the fact that “pa was
helpin’ ma do the washin’, and yer carn’t see ’im (ill
after dinner,” and the visitor retired in confusion. By
the way, no woman-suffragist will smile at this item.
When their millennium arrives pa will not only have to
lend a hand at the tubs, but he must take his share of the
ironing process, and get up an hour earlier the week he
has to mend the socks.
Judge Owen’s positively wilful (for the Bench doesn’t
like plain English) misunderstand! pg of the words “ Born

ast timoi, and puts the announcement thus:—“Jones—
Snooks. At Doughboy Creek, James Jones to Mary Ann
(nee Duckey) Snooks.” She wasn’t born Duckey— she was
only a liowling rose-pink atomy with no hair, and she
didn t emerge from under the laurel with her name pinned
on to her ear, yet, to her dying da}-, she will st ite that she
was nee Duckey, and no counter-clerk of them all will
point out the error to her. Dear friends, nee means born,
so please don t make it stand for “ alias ’’ or “ formerly.”
1 Died haul !o sample Sells’ circus on Monday evening,
bid when wo got there, a surging mob of embodied
money-1 urned-away-at-the-doors ” was battering round
the closed entrances while above the fence a hope! from
which issued a strongly American accent, implored the
ciowd to go right away as vve can’t take in any more,
sure. The head, however, had to talk at a great rate
before the crowd would leave, but I saw the thing was
hopeless in just two winks, so we went on to the Garrick
and Harry Rickards. Katie of the same ilk wears a
very sweet robe-de-nuit of pale-blue silk accordeon pleats
and blue shoes; and Madame Vincent! fiddles very art-
fully' in pink, with a bow in her hair besides one in her
hand. And somebody else with a light soprana wore
white satin and pearls, and a train like a fan-tail pigeon.
Madame Blouet’s reception at the hotel Australia last
Monday was attended, briefly, by everybody', and ail
1 otts Point seemed to have gathered as one woman
around the hostess, whose picturesque robe of gold f usel
biocade combined with old gold velvet and band bouquet
of cream and pink roses, became her to a dot. Mdlle.
Leonie Blouiit was very charming in a Marguerite gown
of grey vehet with sleeves and yoke of grey bengaline,
cluster of white roses on ,the corsage ; while M. “Max
O'Rell ” seemed to entertain each one of the multitude of
visitors. Indeed, seeing how smoothly everything passed
off, one may congratulate Madame Blouet in extending
her reputation as a London hoMess to Australia.
I am pleased to hear that Madame Ivellermanu has been
appointed—or is it commanded?—instructrice in music
to Lady' Margaret \ fillers, Lady Jersey’s eldest gal.
Lady Margaret, by the way, is the only vice-regality who
retains the common-sense hand-shake ; her little sisters
all how-do-do their acquaintances a ; t positively dizzy
elevations. Which reminds me that Max O’Bell tells a
story of how the nose high wag first came into fashion.

A girl, the daughter of General
1 allien, recently adopted strong measures to get
level with the old man. lie had refused to con-
sent to her marriage, and ejected her lover, and
thereupon she hung herself in a public manner
from the front balcony, as an advertisement of her
parent’s hard-hearted# ss.
Big-drum Booth seems to have discovered
something sailor-like ”in the Australians, which
is more than the oldest inhabitant can manage to
detect. On occasions like Easter Monday the
young Australian may here and there betray
symptoms of a rolling walk, but, as'a rule he lias
none of the characteristics of the “gallant tar.”
In his ideas and tastes he is apt to be particularly
anti-sailor-like. Take, for instance, the aspiring
boy who wishes to clear out from the old folks at
home, and start life on his own account. In
England, lie talks of running away to sea. In
Australia lie announces his intention of “going up
country.” Booth probably based his nautical
notion of Australians upon the fact that he saw
several larrikins chewing tobacco.
In the address read to Governor .Jersey
at the opening of the Bathurst (N.S.W.) A. H.
and I. Association fehow, special stress was
laid upon the “salubrious climate and the
phenomenal prosperity of the district.” The
climate is still salubrious, but the prosperity seems
to have leaked a great deal since H.E. left, for at
Bathurst Corporation sale-yards, the other day,
the auctioneers offered stock to anyone on four
months’ bills, without interest, and yet no one
accepted. Big, healthy store bullocks were sold at
10s. (id. a head, and cows with calves at foot for
the same price ; sheep were knocked down at 9d.
ahead. The silver-lining to this particular cloud
comes in with the discomfiture of the land-
grabbing capitalists who, having foreclosed on the
unfortunate farmers and turned their splendid
farms into big sheep-walks, now find that they
have bitten off more than they can chew.
The court appointed to enquire into the
charges against N.S.W. Chief Bailway Commis-
sioner Eddy, by Schey, M. L. A., commenced its
sittings under difficulties the other day. The
mild, and affable Schey raised four-aiid-a-half
closely, printed columns of objections to begin
with. He wanted, first of all, a cast-iron guar-
antee that Eddy would take no civil action on
account of anything of a libellous character or of
any other character that he might say against
him, and Eddy promptly dumped down the
guarantee. 1 hen he wanted a similar immunity
against any criminal action, and he got that also.
Next, he wanted the other two railway commis-
sioners to give guarantees of the same kind, and
though it was pointed out that they were not in
the case at all he talked in his soft, mild voice for
nearly half an hour upon this subject. Also he
wanted a joint guarantee from the whole trio.
After that he wanted to know if the Govern-
ment would guarantee him on its own account
against any personal loss, and it was pointed
out that the Attorney-General had already done
so. Thereupon he desired to inquire if he could
be guaranteed against anything that might be
clone or left undone by any succeeding Govern-
moot. He objected to the way the charges were
diafted, and de ired to draft them over again ;he
objected to Eddy being allowed to cross-examine
him in the witness-box; ho objected to go inio
iln witness box at all; and then he objected
to everything and everybody in a large and
general way, and aft r that ho objected pro-
miscuously. Finally, being told that ho must
either go on wiljr Ifis case or collapse, he “ aban-
doned ” the first-elVnfrgfe altogether, and being told
that this was insufficient, he “withdrew” it as
well. The Commission, at the time of going to
p css, w is price'’dine with some other counts in
’'* m ' l, *‘in . a"*l Mr. Soli- y was still objecting.

this advertised drama than all the twenty-five

Mr. Charles Glenny and Mrs. Bland Holt. The

At the Sydney Criterion, Buchanan’s;
version of Fielding’s immortal novel of “Tom
Jones,” yclept “Sophia,” is doing its best to hold
the mirror up to a nineteenth century notion of
the customs and costumes of its great-grand-
fathers. Gabriel Dante Rossetti, wo think it was
who described the gifted playwright in question
as a scrofulous Scotch poet. Buchanan retorted
that lie was not scrofulous, nor was ho Scotch, and
his “friends” completed the period by denying
that he was a poet. We think thev were correct!
“Sophia” is a splendid example of successful
degradation, by a mannikin, of a great man’s
work. Fielding’s Tom Jones was a hearty vaga-
bond with all Blifil’s vices—and some of his own—
but lacking Blifil’s hypocrisy. Buchanan's Tom
Jones is merely a jovial toper of immaculate
morals ; and all the magnificent breadth of
eighteenth-century libertinism indulged in by his
robust exemplar is wilted away in an effort to
display the manners of a past age through the
modern spectacles of cheap conventionalism. Of
course, it goes without saying that the present
Brough and Bouoicault production is splendidly
mounted and admirably acted—but why was it
not called something else? “Susan Jane ” would
have done just as well as “ Sophia,” and the
characters might even have gained in respect-
ability (that huge desideratum of Mr. Robert
Buchanan’s) if they had been attired in the garb
of the present day.
* # *
The most completely artistic and satis-,
factory work ever done, or attempted, by Mr..
Cecil Ward, is his pourtrayal of the jovial and!
robust rake whom Fielding forced upon humanity
for many years as the typical John Bull, junior : :
a good fellow, a hard drinker, a benevolent scamp,,
and an unscrupulous Lothario—a man, in short,'
after his creator’s own big, unregulated heart..
Perhaps, the palm of being next in order of;
merit must bo divided between Mr. Bond
cault’s Squire Western and Mr. Lawrence’s;
Blifil. The latter is an excellent performance, far
more plausible and even than the characterisation;
of the same part by poor Phil. Beck, whose Blifill
was certainly one of the best things he ever
attempted. Mr. Boucicault’s fox-hunting, rowdy;,
vulgar, swearing squire is a masterpiece of make-!
up, and his double-shotted adjectives are delivered!
with a vim redolent of the days of the touglii
five-bottle men whose chair of state was a saddle,,
whose sceptre was a hunting crop, and whose
deity was old port. Mr. Titheradge’s Partridge
has not mellowed with age, and the playwright
has made the character too obsequious to be pro-
bable or pleasing—hence the actor appeared some-
what to a disadvantage. Miss Patty Browne
played the part of Honor with a pert incisivencss,
a keenness of phrase and manner, which were
almost too good for this world ; but the Miss
Western of Miss Pelham, though fairly well
enacted, made one regret that Miss Romer did not
appear in her old rdle. Mr. Corlesse made a
portly and respectable Sq uire All worthy, and Mr.
Lash Gordon a sententious Square, while the
Farmer Copse and George Seagrirn of Mr. Hasker
and Mr. Mill respectively were very fairly
played. Miss Emma Temple, who succeeds Mrs.
Brough as Sophia, was graceful and adequately
ladylike; Mrs. Molyueux’s Lady Hellaston did
not seem to suit the peculiar talents of the
artiste, and Miss Spong wrestled vigorously,
and with a moderate meed of success,
with the country dialect allotted to poor,
but amorous, Molly Seagrirn. Several minor
characters were respectably filled, and Mr.
Spong’s painting of the scenery of the willow
copse was worthy ratior of a play by Fielding,
than of a play travestied from that author by a
poetaster like Buchanan.

At Sydney Her Majesty’s, “Dick Whit-
tington” has taken his "last ride in the
Cockney Lord Mayor's coach, and that cheerful
Rignoldian resort is now handed over to the
mummeries of “Little Jack Sheppard ” and Lis
ultramarine crony, Blueskin. Miss Billee Barlow
holds up the bracelets of the celebrated gaol-
breaker with a music-hall-like vigour that lends
enchantment to a cell, and Mr. H, Shine stumps
quaintly about the stage, d la Royce, in the blue
togs of the ancient lieutenant of thieves, and
essays the ejaculation of the word “Or-der-er!”
with a faint reminiscence of his mighty predecessor
in this part. Mr. George Walton’s Jonathan
Wild is a more or less successful copy of Mr.
Brough’s janissary chief, and many other talented
people meander cheerfully about the interstices of
the present production, and chortle joyous lays in
commemoration of Botany Bay. A wild, weird,
nerve-scaring and blush-raising terpsichorean per-
formance is a mighty feature of the show. Four
male and two female performers indulge in a
Parisian, latter-day, cholera-epoch, fin dc sieclc
can-can. Three of the male dancers are
attired as ladies ; the two ladies and the
other gentlemen are costumed as bucks of the
period. Then to the sound of riotous music
extraordinary gyrations are indulged in. The
danc-rs dressed asdandmeltes turn soul-appalling
somersaults, and sway violently in attitudes sug-


Good wine needs no bush, and Innes’s Boar s

The Sydney Garrick suffered a change on
Saturday last, when the Harry Rickards New
W llC rlish Comedy Company opened to a full house,
after a trip to the diamond fields of South Africa.
i\lr. Rickards reappears in Sydney with anew bill
a ,d new billers, and his “new” company are
absolutely up to the requirements of the Sydney
daily press. # , „
Many other Sydney shows have closed, or
are closing, “ not because they couldn’t or because
they didn't try,” but because the exigencies, &c.,
necessitate —and likewise. Max O'Hell, after a
highly successful run in an ecclesiastical vault,
beneath the Ivdeous oppression of a Wesleyan-
like organ, flits to other, and, possibly, more
appreciative shores. We are sorry to lose him,
for he began to teach us to love—no, not England,
but Maxi me O'Reilly and his superb France.
Sells’ mammoth circus also closed on Wednesday’
night with a wild Arabian whoop, and the glitter-
ing ensemble has gone the way of all horse-flesh.
In various other respects, the Bondi Aquarium is
still open. So also is the Ooogee marine stamping-
ground of that ilk, and various nondescript places

The last nights of Mrs. Bernard Beere, at
Melbourne Opera House, are taking place amidst
a satisfactory display of enthusiasm by the higher-
priced public, who have laid hold of the broad
{act that Mrs. B. B, is a first-class artiste, and are
prepared to swear hardest by her least admirable
efforts. This reckless determination to bedelighted
on principle gave a general appearance of success
to “ She Stoops to Conquer,” in which the star,
as Kate Hardcastle, fought hard against natural
disadvantages and didn’t get the better of them.
The management declared it a draw, and took
plenty of gate-money, and there the matter ended.
This week's programme was arranged to display
Mrs. Beere at her full height of sft. Din., or so.
As Lena Despard and Peg Woffington, she could
conquer without stooping; to-night (Thursday)
she repeats the powerful but unconvincing Lady
Teazle performance, and to-morrow will see the
positively last Melbourne appearance of herself
and company in “Fedora.” Talking of the com-
pany, it is to be hoped that Herbert Standing has
resumed operations this week.
** * *
Gaiety burlesque follows Beere at the
Opera House, even as it danced into the vacuum
left by Bernhardt at the Princess’. On Saturday
the Musgrove combination of legs and light fan-
tastic lunacy will break out in “ Faust up to
Date,” which bears the doubtful reputation of
being a specially funny burlesque. It will be
mounted regardless of the prevailing depression,
and with an eye to another Gaiety boom. Indeed,
the spec, seems full of promise. Several of the
new damsels have already produced a paralysing
effect on the “ Block,” and a young crop of alleged
“silver kings” is said to be waiting for the
sickle.
** * *
The other “Faust” will disappear from
the Alexandra forthwith, so as to avoid any con-
fusion of ideas concerning the ancient and up-to-
date devils. Dampier has decided to retire in
favour of the more festive Beelzebub, for fear that
be might be called upon for a song in the middle
of the garden scene, or have his feelings further
harrowed by the spectacle of daughter Lily
dancing a breakdown at the earnest request of the
gallery. “Faust” chases his love-sick virgin
round the shrubbery for the last time this (Thurs-
day) evening. To-morrow is a Shakespearian
Friday, and the same young couple—Miss Lily
D. and Alfred Rolfe —will breathe their vows
anew as Romeo and Juliet. The story told by
Divine William indicates that Margaret and her
lover didn’t lose much by omitting to get married.
Anyway the confiding little fraulein went up to
Heaven on a cloud for certain, whereas Juliet’s
post-mortem movements are a matter for grave
doubt. On Saturday, the Aleck reverts to red-
hot local melodrama, a four-act shocker entitled,
“Dead Beat; or The World Against Him,”
having been run-up for the occasion.
** * *
Widow O’Brien, of immortal memory, has
returned to the bosom of her family at the Royal.
The actual departure of J. F. Sheridan is nigh at
hand, therefore all who haven’t seen “ Fun on the
Bristol ” more than ten times are exhorted not to
miss the few remaining opportunities for bidding
Bridget good-bye. Slade Murray is a feature in
the variety portion of the show, and the glories of
the new ditty “ Ta-ra-ra-boom-der-ay ” are suc-
cessfully unfolded by J.F.S. and Gracie White-
ford.
** * *
“ Uncles and Aunts,” which has succeeded
“ The Solicitor ” at Melbourne Bijou, reminds one
of the delirium tremens that comes close upon the
heels of a raging drunk. The central figure is
neither an uncle nor an aunt, but a bottle-nosed
nightmare named Zedekiah, who crawls around
tables on his hands and knees, and petitions
womankind in general to call him “ Kiali.” He
resembles nothing else in Heaven or earth, and
even in the awful capacity of a wandering outrage
he is inconsistent and not to be relied upon. It
would be hard to discover what family of human
atrocities this Zedekiah Aspen belongs to, but he
tends to drive dull care away, which is about all
that anybody expects of him. Mr. Oannam, who
impersonates the apparition aforesaid, is sup-
ported by much the same company that pushed
“Uncles and Aunts” along in Sydney. With
Messrs. Brough and Fabert as uncles, Miss Romer
and Annie Taylor as aunts, Mrs. Brough and
Brenda Gibson as cousins, and Cates and Chiches-
ter as the inevitable mashers in attendance it goes
without saying that the fun never flags, although
we say it all the same.
** * *
“ La Cigale,” revived at the Princess s on
Saturday, was exactly as before with the exception
of two new faces in the stupid low comedy parts,
originally played by Elton and Lauri. The task
of following Elton in a Dutch character comes
very easy to J. 0. Williamson, whose unforced
style is a startling contrast to Elton’s painful
attempts at raising laughs from stony ground.
Elton, with his Cockney dialect, could make
nothing out of Vanderkoopen, and Williamson is
equally unable to find jokes that are not there.
But he makes a comprehensible Dutchman of the
famous John Stofel pattern, and adds touches of
nature to the opera without ever becoming weari-
some. Leumane is quite harmless as the other
man, and for the rest they are all worthy of the
nice things generally said about them. Mane
Halton will appear no more in Melbourne after
Friday, they say. Anyway, she is to take a fare-
well benefit on that occasion in the character that
shows her at her best.
« *. « » , , ,
On Saturday the pick of Simonsoti s late
opera company start a short trill at the Princess s.
The arrangement is to sing them four nights a
week in change with an English opera company,
or anything that comes handy, and if there isn’t a
crowded house to hear Cuttioa in ‘‘Lucia,’" why,
the old belief in Melbourne’s musical taste had
better curl itself up and expire. Miss Colborne
Baber, as Maritana, was to open the Anglo-Saxon
portion of the season, but there is now reason to
suspect that Jennie Lee, in “Jo,"’ will meander
like a murky rivulet through the meadow of
Italian harmony. In which case people will have
to take care lest they get Cuttica when they want
the historic crossing-sweep, and vice-versa. The
announcement that a “complete resume, giving
full details of the plot of each opera, will be dis-
tributed gratuitously ” will suit the ordinary low,
vu’gar person who has a mania for wanting to
know what it all means.

With Williamson once more comic-operating in Mel-

Williamson acts too little. Never was there so

was something he could not possibly do; like Henri di
Sartorys, in “ Frou FrouGeoffrey Delamayn, in “ Man

Williamson is distinctly a first-class actor, and not because
he’s a manager, as witness his John Stofel, Rip Van

Retry, and Jim Farren, in “ Shadows of a Great City.

The most popular recitation at Christchurch (M.L.)
smoke-concerts (and a great many other places) is fb e
Billiard-Marker’s Story,” by Edmund Fisher, and which
was first published in the ’9O Christmas number of Tub
Bulletin. Snazelle, who is fond of reciting “ Bill
Adams,” had never heard nor read the piece, and got a
Christchurch elocutionist to write it out for him from
memory. Another favourite poetical selection in
Christchurch is the satirical democratic parody, “ Briton’s
Land,” also from The Bulletin— author, “Titus Salt.
Editor Bulletin. Sir,—l see you mention that “Ta ra-
ra-boom-de-ay ”“is an old Swiss volkslied.” That may
be so, but if the subject is not already threadbare I can
o-ive you a few explanations. In June, ’86,1 was rowing
down the Meuse with some friends. At Mpesyck, on the
Bebnati-Dutch frontier, they were building a bridge and
singing the while. The piles were being driven by the
primitive “ monkey ” or “ mouton,” which was raised by
means of about 30 lines rove over blocks with a man the
otherend. The “ Boom’’-for “Ta-ra-ra,” &c., vyastheir
son „-—was short and dull, corresponding to the tall of the
monkey on the pile: the “de-ay” corresponded to the
hauling in of the slack and rattle of the blocks, &c.j the
“ta-ra-ra” corresponded to the three “holts” whilst
hauling up the mass of iron. 1 distinctly remember hear-
in v the refrain towards sunset as we were coming round
the curve; and, having already heard it, guessed what it
was. The men were chiefly Flemings, and told me in the
evening at the “Kstaminet” that, as long as they and
their fathers could recollect, the song had been in use—
and there is a good deal of pile-driving in those parts.
The proper time, therefore, for the air would be (o

Stage thunder and theatrical wigs on the green at the
Victoria Hall, Melbourne. “ Pat Finn,” who claims to be
the originator of the title “ Ila! ha !! ha !! !” advertises
that “he is now no longer connected with the U.S. enter-
tainment,” and has “duly registered” his pet title “ in
accordance with the provisions of the Australian Copy-
rights Act,” J. Billin, manager of the hall, gets there
just the same with the identical “ Ha !” three times over,
above tile announcement of the “ hundredth week of the

the tin-dagger to be plunged to the heft in the bladder of
logwood-juice. Ha, ha, ha!
Arthur Roberts has, it is said, signed an agreement
w.th George Edwards for three years at the Gaiety at a
salary of £7O a week. It is not likely, therefore, that we
shall see his amusing impersonation of Captain Crosstree,
in “ Blue Eye’d Susan.”
Haddon Chambers has been definitely commissioned by
Beerbohm Tree to write a new play for the Haymarket,
and Tree has already approved of the scenario. It is
likely that Haddon will write another play for George
Alexander, and it is not, improbable that his work may be
seen later on at the Garrick under John Hare’s manage-
ment.

Analytically considered, “Jacques Bonhomme” is Max

pleading.
Another head is being moulded for the figure of
Williams at Melbourne Waxworks. The original face
was not an altogether truthful image, but it had to be
fixed up in a hurry, because a hungry public couldn t
wait for a striking resemblance. A nice, clean-looking
young man, with a wild eye and a silky moustache, and a
liberal supply of cement, was good enough to go on with
for a time. The new Williams is intended to attract the
ladies who have engraved his features on their hearts,
and dispel their gloomy conviction that they will never
look upon his like again. Every wrinkle in the new
Williams is a profound study from life. “ You 11 he
astonished when you see him,” said Phil Stuart to the
writer, and he might well say that. Murderers in wax
are the most astonishing circumstances under the sun.
A Melbourne music-hall has started a new plan of
making the shekels. A man goes round the suburbs, and
gives every child he meets a ticket for a matinee, to be
held on the following Saturday. The ticket admits the
child to the front seats, if accompanied by an adult the
price of an adult’s ticket being a shilling. Of course, the
children badger their parents to take them, and so a very
fair crowd turns up at the matinee.
George Coppin has discarded the one-horse buggy,

smaller shareholders of the Royal Co. whisper that the
second horse is a property charger, and that the coach-
man is capable of playing Conn at a moment’s notice.
When the mail left, Mrs. Potter and Kyrle Bellew were

Brough and Bouoicault are, it is said, giving up the
lease of Sydney Criterion.
When Kyrle Bellew was in Sydney he was very anxious
to become a lessee of one of the theatres, but he couldn t
find any capitalist to back him. “Backing” oofless
managers is a form of business moneyed people don’t take
to readily—after the experience of that gilded youth, Mr.
Blank, of Sydney.
Herbert Standing billed to give imitations of leading
actors, at Anson’s benefit at Melbourne Bijou. We’d like
to see him imitate Anson as “ Eccles.”
The favourite recitation of Odell, the veteran Savage
Club entertainer, is Marcus Clarke’s verses, “ Bill Jenks,”
which “ The Vagabond ” first introduced to his notice.
Standish Sievier (“ Bob ” Sutton, the bookmaker, Lord
Beerthirst’s friend) has come out as a dramatic author in
London with a play called “ Stone Broke.” He ought to
dedicate it to Beerthirst.
Dampier, in advertising daughter Bose as Ophelia,
quoted extracts from American papers, praising her per-
formance of Toddie, in Habberton’s “ Helen’s Babies,”
and also a notice from Habberton himself. There’s a
recommendation of ability to play Shakespeare !
Cecchi, her old Melbourne teacher of singing, says that
Melba was the soul of industry, the most conscientious
worker he ever saw. He taught her for several years.
Marion Hood, of the new Gaiety crowd, says she means
to stay in Australia altogether if she can, and the lucky
place will be “dear, dear old Sydney” which Marion
longs to see again. Who is the squattah?
George Rignold only did fair business at Adelaide
Royal, and the season has been cut short.
Mrs. Bernard-Beere is, in all human probability, the
tallest woman who ever attempted to play the part of
Kate Hardcastle in “ She Stoops to Conquer.” Needless
to say she doesn't look quite happy in short skirts. The
matter is not improved by lengthening the skirts until
they lap over the boots, and give her the appearance of
having grown out of last year’s costume.
Magnanimous Williamson announces the Italian Opera,
in Melbourne, without subscription or increased prices.
Allan Morris, as the Mikado, puts all his Australian pre-
decessors into the shade. His grimaces and business are
ridiculously funny, and he sings the music in a style that
the others' couldn’t touch. The Melbourne people, who
had already reckoned Morris up as a dry-hash performer
after seeing him in two feeble background characters,
were amazed at the way in which he let himself out in the
G. and S. opera.
J. C. Williamson had not appeared in comic opera for
10 years until he played Elton’s part in “ La Cigale ” last
Saturday.
Interesting reading would be the names of all the men
who attended a seaside masquerade ball the other night,
coupled with those of the ladies with whom they danced.
Jimmy MacMahon has been tuning up Ballarat, Ben-
digo, and Geelong with a branch of Williamson’s Opera
Go. in “Gondoliers,” &c.
Lilian Tree returned to Melbourne in the same Orient
steamer with the Lonnen Gaiety Co. Of course, none of
them knew her, and she obliged at the piano for a “ Ta-ra-
ra-boom-de-ay ” and such. Lilian is as plump as a par-
tridge, or a Marie Halton, and mild as an emulsion.
A”few nights ago, in Sydney, one of the “ gods ” flung
a single rose to a lady “ star ’’—who picked it up, tore it
to pieces, and contemptuously scattered the leaves upon
the stage. Actresses can’t stand the poor and humble
admirer.
Alice Leamar, formerly of the “Sisters” Leamar, comes
with the new Gaiety burlesque crowd. She will set many
Cockney Australians thinking of old times, when she and
Nellie L. (who wasn’t her sister off the stage) used to sing
“ Just escaped from the Harm” at four music-halls every
niirht. “Harem” was pronounced so as to rhyme with
“ scarum,” and the song was a delirious success. Nellie
dissolved the sisterhood by marrying a younger offspring
of an earl, and now it seems the scion of nobility has
successfully “ sacked ” little Nell for misconduct with one
Yates, “a gentleman of fortune.”
Tom Cannam is thoroughly accepted, in Melbourne, as
its Pcnley, more so than Frank Thornton, who was a
trifle hard.
Why is the show called variety ? Because there is such
a sameness ?
The last giraffe in London Zoo is just dead. The Mahdi
has closed up the only giraffe region, the Soudan, ami
there i« only one giraffe left in Europe, a she, for which
au exorbitant price is asked. With Cooper and Baileys
sliow they had a stuffed giraffe, which moved its head from
side to side, and was marked, “ Please don’t touch.”
Thus a man of experience: “I would never believe
what any theatrical lodging-house keeper said of a lady
lodger.” The Scotch landladies are very dour. Said an
Aberdeen one to an actor like Bentley : “ Why dinna ye
tak’ to something gentlemaunly, like ma hoosband?” He
was a tailor.
All the talk, in Melbourne Thespian circles, is of Morris’s
‘Mikado.”
P. W. Robinson writes on “ Lady Comiques,” in the last
illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, giving Billee
Barlow a high place,
Slade Murray’s back in Melbourne from India, where
they don’t seem altogether to understand “ Poor Mary
Ann.”
Globe-Trotter Ballantyne writes, in the Theatre
Magazine, London, on Australian theatres. He says the
Ballarat miners really believed Dan. Barry’s announce-
ment that the “ Parson’s Oath ” was written by
Spurgeon.
Melbourne Cyplorama Co. held its meeting last week.
The Waterloo carries the Paris on its shoulders. The
second was an obvious mistake, but the Waterloo is like
Rainer’s American War Panorama, perennial, and it was
the same in London, where they would take to Waterloo
anytime, but did not care for others.
A Frenchman, named Dourof, is holding a unique rat-
exhibition in Paris. He has constructed a miniature
circular railway with a train, consisting of a locomotive,
three carriages, and a goods van. At a given signal from
the station-master, a rat, the engined river, mounts the
locomotive, the guard enters his van, and between twenty
and thirty passengers, carrying luggage, take their places
in the first, second, and third class carriages. They are
all rats, and the station-master and the worker of the
signals also are rodents. A whistle is sounded, and off
goes the train, the motive power being supplied by clock-
work. M. Dourof describes the rat as the most impres-
sionable of all animals, with a sensitively nervous
temperament, fragile in constitution, prone to melan-
choly, and apt to commit suicide when ill or “out of
sorts.” Out of 230 animals he has in training, as many as
thirty will be on the sick list at one time.
When Sampson, “ the strong man,” was sentenced, at
the London Criminal Court, to 12 months gaol for steal-
ing his mistress’ jewellery, he “ uttered a loud groan and
fainted in the box,” and the mass of discomfited beef was
removed, with difficulty, by half-a-dozen warders and
policemen. It is one of the of the big
man to collapse like this. The'gladiator is generally a
person with scanty hair, small eyes, an utterly expression-
less face, and a neck like a tree—and he looks as if lie w as
equal, in his own dull, ox-like way, to any fate, yet when-
ever he meets a difficulty' that can’t be bashed with his
gigantic fists, he falls down and grovels in abject
wretchedness. -
The next Savo}' opera w ill be by Sir Arthur Sullivan
and Grundy.
Sims and Buchanan have nearly completed a new melo-
drama for the Ade l phi, which will be put up after the
“ Trumpet Call.”
Lawrence Irving’s first appearance in London cannot lie
called a success, says The Bulletin correspondent. He
has undoubtedly a good vein of comedy in him, but from
nervousness, or some other cause, he failed to make a
great impression.
Antoinette Sterling, the famous vocalist, has just joined
the Society of Friends. She was received in the com-
munity with much ceremony and prayer, and she declared
that until then she never knew what true religion is.
Jacques, the fasting-man, has been sued in London for
medical fees. He pleaded inability to pay, but as he
recently published a book in which he stated that he made
over £3 a week by his fasting performances the Judge
who tried the case humorously pointed out that a man
who could live on nothing and earn £3 a week should be
able to pay his doctor.
Bavousky: The Divorce Judge is a mere theatrical
advertising agent, to give strumpets a divorce salary.
Sisters Ongar, trapezists, Oxford Music Hall, London,
do all the Silbon business of the leap for life—first time
by two women.
Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay is described as “ a frenzied half-
dance, half-dirge.”
Patti’s dog’s teeth are cleaned with a tooth-brush three
times a day. Probably his tail is also shampooed, bub
there seems to be no evidence on this point.
Says an American manager: “You never know until
eight o’clock w'hether Patti will give you “Traviata” or
a doctor’s certificate. She keeps them both handy.”
Mrs. Langtry has attempted a minuet all by herself in
what are termed “ convoluted skirts,” but she proved 100
bovine for skirt-dancing and gave it up.
Lysterian story:—ln the opera of “ Moses in Egypt ” a
speaking-trumpet voice was heard off the top of Mount
Sinai; whereupon a man in the gallery called out, “la
that Lyster ? ”
Edward Macready, son of the great Macready, came to
Australia with a letter of introduction from Carlyle to Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy. The latter introduced him to Coppin
and he appeared as Captain Absolute in “The Rivals.”
But he didn’t inherit his father’s genius, rapidly dropped
into the ruck and died prematurely in Melbourne.
The story goes that the beautiful Miss Lane-Fox’s
engagement with young Peel, son of Sir Robert, was
broken off because the bride-elect was jealous of her
fiance's fondness for Mrs. Langtry.
Raynham says that Fred. Leslie’s managerial scheme is
all moonshine. Nevertheless, the Referee sticks to the
statement that Frederick will become a “sole lessee”
next Christmas, with Farren as leading lady.
Mrs. Bancroft returns to the stage—this time to play
old women.
The latest is that Abingdon Baird is “off” with Mrs.
Langtry and “on ” with Fay Templeton.
Sir. Stowe, advance-agent for Sells’ Circus, astonished
the big firm’s creditors by humping round a huge bag of
silver coin and paying each account in two-shilling
pieces.
For four years the average weekly profits of “Our
Boys” at the London Vaudeville were £4OO.
Sims drew from Wilson Barrett £30,000, for author’s
fees, on the “ Lights of London ” alone.
Jennie Lee’s little daughter and son have grown nearly
as tall as herself.
There are three theatrical teams kept up in Australia—
Williamson’s Opera Co., Brough and Boucicault’s Co.,
and Rignold’s, in all which the performers ripen by
association.
They were playing “La Sonnambula” recently a*
Turin, when the leading danseuse suddenly advanced to
the footlights and'fell head first into the orchestra, dead.
We always hear of things like these, somehow, hut the
lady who falls dead in a, prayer-meeting passes almost
unnoticed.
“Ma Femme,” a four-act farce which failed badly at
Paris a little while ago, is said to have possessed only one
interesting feature. At a certain stage in the proceedings
the leading lady took off her dress before the footlights,
and appeared ‘‘amid tremendous applause ” m her stays
and petticoats. This isn’t an exclusively French proceed-
ing, by (lie way. A few years ago a male performer took
off’his whole suit of clothes on the stage of a Sydney
theatre, and the applause was deafening. Also he was
recalled, evidently in the hope that he would take off his
underclothing too.

Victor J. Daley, we are glad to hear, con-

A son has been born to the Gordon-

W. H. Groom, who, on August 11 next,

Deeming is known to have been maritally

By the death on May-day of Mrs. C. lb

One of the weirdest sights to be seen in
Sydney is the hundred-guinea-prize-poet Anarchist
Andrews, who sometimes holds forth in the

Prince George of Wales has a much

Artist Leitch (not Leech) taught Queen

Greeley Jenkins, the Yankee Commis-

Deakin’s Deeming address was brilliant
for three-parts of the distance, but Purves dropped
in for a moment, and Alfred, catching his critical

tamely. Everyone looked for a record peroration
in vain.
It is rumoured that Judge Hodges, Deem-
ing’s trier, has spoken of a desire to return to the
bar. Judges’ wives are against this sort of thing,
because of the certain pension. Though the bar
may bo more immediately profitable, it only lasts
with the physique.
Of the passengers in the brig Rapid,
which brought the first settlers to S. Australia
nearly G'J years ago, only five remain : Hiram
Mildred, still in business in Adelaide, Jacob,
Thorne, Hodges, and Buck, all resident in the

Apropos , once more, of Edward Wilson,
founder of the Argus prosperity. When O’Shan-
nas«y went to see him in England, Wilson said :
“There’s a politician here, a great friend of mine,
but we can only agree on one thing-that the
English Revolution is inevitable.”
Editor Twopeny, of the Pastor a i.lst,s’
Review, is also seciotary to Melbourne Wool-
brokers’Association, and has just been appointed
secretary to the Victorian bogus “National”

than ever under the influence of three fat salaries.
A late editor of the Tasmanian Mail now
helps to run a Melbourne jam-factory. He married
the “old man’s daughter ” and has acquired a

“Did yon never hear of the Gracchi?” Reply:
“ and I’ve heard of the Coochi.”'
Judge Hodges has a hairless, angelic cast
of countenance—a sweet face, in fact—and he
talks like a curate at a tea-fight. His general
tone during the hearing of the big murder case
was that of a gentleman who had communed with
Ins soul and discovered a subtle connection
between the gallows and the glory of God.
Premier Dibbs is generally believed to be
by no means wealthy, yet, ere leaving N.S.W. on
his English trip, he refused to accent a gift of
nearly .£3OOO in cash, subscribed for him as a
token of goodwill by a large number of friends,
each of whom gave a minimum of £lO. The sub-
scription was started by a lady with £lOO.
Williams-Deeming said to his warder, just
before the verdict : “How will it go?” Warder •
“Pretty rough, I think.” W.-D. : “I don’t care
a damn about being hung if Hodges doesn’t jaw
me.” His Honor’s ecclesiastical mental kink
must have received a severe shock when he was
denied the privilege of talking to Deeming about
his “ soul.”
Marshall Lyle, Deeming’s lawyer, is an
ardent Home Ruler and Land Nationalisation
advocate, and has lectured on both these subjects
in Melbourne. He was partner during the land-
boom. in an estate-agency business, and subse-
quently played second fiddle in a building society.
Being an Irishman he naturally wants to get into
Parliament.
Christie Murray, writes a London corres-
pondent, has come honourably out of his financial
troubles. His bankruptcy was brought about by
the pressure of a solicitor, who had bought a £lO
debt of Christie’s for £5, and by means of law-
costs brought the sum up to £5O, which Chri-tie
refused to pay. This matter has now been settled,
and Murray, having passed his examination, has
now paid liis creditors in full. He has been able
to do this out of the sale of his new novel, shortly
to be issued.
It is foreshadowed in an inspired news-
paper paragraph that a good deal of Parkes’ forth-
coming book will consist of letters he has received
—or let us say, extracted —from leading men.
The letters that L’arkos lias got are the pride and
joy of his life. Every visitor to whom ho shows
them takes the compliment as a personal one until
he becomes aware that the old man has shown
them to every other visitor.
The head of the great final of Bolckow*
Vaughan & Co., L united, the largest iron people
in England, has just “gone bung.” This gentle-
man's nephew, young Vaughan, some years ago
inherited more than half a million from his father,
which lie knocked down in less than ten years.
His house was a perfect curiosity. The furniture
of his bedroom (he was a bachelor) cost something
like ,£lO,OOO, and the spittoons in the billiard-
room cost £'M) each, He was not a gambler—he
simply lot his money pass through his hands like
water.
Mr. Wentworth Reeve, who is such a
devoted supporter of English racing under Hunt
Club rules, is a grandson of tbe great W. C.
Wentworth. His father formerly owned the land
on which the Pitt-street frontage of Sydney Post
Office stands. Another grandson of Mr. Went-
worth's, Mr. D’Arcy Reeve, is a well-known figure
at London National Liberal Club. He is a
right-down Radical, and gives <£loo a year in
prizes for essays on Radical subjects by members
of tbe Eleusis Club at Chelsea. It is enough to
make his grandfather squirm in his grave.
Mrs. Mary Lee is to be a member of
Adelaide Trades and Labour Council. She is
quite a good speaker, but somewhat of the waving
umbrella stamp.
The Deeming business has given the Eng-
lish papers a noble opportunity of displaying their
knowledge of Australian geography and topo-
graphy. One of them describes Windsor, the
scene of the murder, as “a small town, of
migratory inhabitants, three miles inland from St.
Jvilda,” and “having two fine bridges over the
Parramatta.”
Herbert Palmer’s Imperial Review (Mel-
bourne) which has outlived all the weakly maga-
zines that have been invented in Australia, gets
most flattering notices in London. Yet, such is
the determined boycott on the part of Australian
newspapers against any literary effort that
breathes with a purely Australian breath that,
beyond the circle of the Melbourne journalists’
club, and the odd liere-aiid-there readers of Aus-
tralian magazine literature, the Imperial Review
is practically unknown.
1 .M. Gazette having called for a name
that should “over all subjects of the Queen-
Empress and all portions of her dominions ” a
correspondent comes up smilingly with “Al-
britons,” as soundingly appertaining to “ All
Britain,” and as likely to be equally favoured by
English, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Indians, Canadians
Australians, and Cape Colonists. Thanks. The
kangaroo couldn’t learn to pronounce the shib-
boleth. Why not call them “ Guelphlings ” and
leave out the “ kawiinists? ”
Tho late Frederic Bjgge, the news of
whose death in England has been recently received
was a pioneer squatter of Moreton Bay. The old
firm was Frederic and Francis Bigge, after whom
“ Bigge’s Camp” (rechristened by the altiloquent
Governor Bowen “ Grandchester ”) was named.
F. and F. Bigge also at one time owned Mount
Brisbane station, famous for the Westminster and
1 ouclistone breed of horses. “Bigge's Folly” was a
monumental wool store which the same adventurers
built at Cleveland, Q., in the earlv fifties when it
was fondly supposed by a few that Cleveland was
to be the boss seaport of the then “North.”
Double Destiny.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There were few women in the place.
Those present were in high demand; Pairing-ofi
did not take long; In the absence of a clergyman
mutual agreement settled the thing. So one fin,.*
comely woman and a hardy miner became mates’
and the lady at once left the calico pub., and tool!
refuge in her lord’s tent.
Some time afterwards he was engaged cutting a
race about twelve miles from tbe township. As th<>
country was very rough bo camped at bis work
leaving his spouse behind him. But he went home
regularly each Saturday evening. His woman to
beguile the weary hours, was very familiar with
another man. One Saturday morning, when a
child which had been born to her and the minor
was three weeks old, she wrapped it in its father's
great-coat, put it on the bed, and fled with No 9

Condensed milk saved the infant’s life.
Though its father regarded it with suspicions eve
lie nevertheless placed it under the care of a
neighbouring family, and it prospered.

Twenty-three years slipped away. The
child was now a strapping man. Few remembered
the story of bis mother’s flight. The young fellow
was at work in his claim one afternoon when a
huge boulder fell from the face, and, striking the
pick, drove it into his chest. He died after two
hours of horrible agony. This suffering was
probably the expiation for his mother’s crime as
per non-blood-poisoning Scriptural records.

Stancdng back from the candle-light, in
the hotel parlour, I recognised the lad’s mother
The tears were falling fast. The flickering gleams
played strangely on that haggard face. It needed
no close scrutiny to show the furrows on her brow.
Her bent and trembling frame was the sport of
her unstrung nerves. Shame and hesitancy sat
on her features. In her eyes was the baleful light
of a wild despair. Advancing slowly towards the
corpse, she turned to the diggers around, and in a
broken voice, told of her desertion of the baby
I hen she fell upon the corpse of her son, and went
afresh. 1
Well has Schopenhauer said that “to live” is
sufficient punishment for the greatest crime.

Dear Bulletin, — Sydney Mail reports

that lived for sixteen hours. This is certainly a

a big toe? Was its mental-power generally-
reckoned to equal that of a freetrade editor? And :
so on. But, assuming the journalist has not mis/
taken a comic paper for the transactions of a„,
biological society, or merely tried to stem the ebb-’,
mg tide of subscribers with an extra whopper, let*
us take the Gospel side of the business. Are the..
reverend men now fighting “wicked,” as* the'!
boxers say ? Where do they propose to dpw a
line If a birth appears short, not only of, head
but legs and arms, will it be “the makings.”of an ’
immortal spirit? If only two ounces of stomach or -
three of rear ward ness, represent the nsuall infant

Ur it the ‘ babe ” consists simply of two grains of

of cnerubism would have been greater. For we.
know that celestial infants are deprived of trunks ■

to be that they may not disturb the eternal!
hymnists with strains founded on “ tuinmvache.’”
iossibly also to prevent the unseemliness of the*
severer elders of the glorified treating the errors,
of childhood in the usual manner. Desperate are,
the devices of the desperate. Their altars crum-
bling beneath their feet, their auditors listening-

expedients worthy of Mumbo Jumbo. Oh, LordV,

What is tlio explanation of the downfall of

‘wives wanting to get into Society, or to get back

“ S icialisrn is tho totality of aspirations
and theories which x.ould establish between men,
by various legislative measures, the greatest
equality of wealth and poverty.”
S.M. Herald circulates the Tory canard
that toe Victorian Government is willing to bribe
ox-Riilway Commissioner Speight to abandon his
libel-action against Melbourne Age.
Treasurer MTlwraith (Q.) once said that
his ideas of land taxation were—First sell all the
lauds ; then tax them. He is selling the lands now
as fast as ever he can. lie will not live to tax
them.
The Presbyterian Assembly of Victoria
gets to,the right political point by a wrong road.
The Kirk’s objection to the Queensland Kanaka
business is that it will “depopulate the islands,
and render mission work fruitless on them.”
The more earnest of the Single-tax advo-
cates will now*prob.ably cool down their Froetrade
propaganda to join in the coming struggle between
the Tories and tho Australian democrats. It is
now quite clear Land Nationalisation will never
bo accomplished without One-man-one-vote.
Tho N.S.W. Public Works Committee
have declared against the Glen Innes-Inyerell
railway. Every delegate from the Legislative
Council voted against it. Alexander Hutchison,
member for the district, tabled a motion in tho
House, last session, for the abolition of the Upper
House. ,
A motion is before the N.S.W. Employers
Union to increase the day’s labour to ten hours.
’The proposer is a National Ass. magnate wdio is
■eternally writing to the daily papers. Knowing
.this, cannot the workmen be persuaded to sink their
fiscal differences and stand shoulder to shoulder at
the polls ?
A prominent Empire Leaguer got mixed
up in an after-dinner speech at Melbourne tho
other day. Ile said that “we were all members of
the same gerlorious Angler-,Saxing family, ’ and ho
implored Australians, in looking after their own
interests, “not to lose sight of those relations they
have never seen.” -
Most of the persons just appointed to tho
nominee N.S.W. LegisLtive Council arc empties
of the usual type, who after a few inhalations of
Upper House air may bo depended on to give a
short shrift and a long rope to Labour on every
occasion. They are nearly all politicians “ divorced
from their constitnencus.” _____
Apropos London Standard Wilson’s de-
claration that “the entire fabric of Australian
civilisation is built upon debt,” the Argos points
out that between 1850 and 1890 Australia exported
340 millions in gold and 400 millions in vyool.
And The Bulletin would point out that Euro-
pean civilisation is built on debt, in that Europe
owes about 5000 millions sterling.
Before the Victorian elections, and while
Berry was intriguing with Shiels, a lory tout un-
dertook to sound him for the benefit of the coali-
tion cabal. “On which side of the House will you
sit, Sir Graham?” “The House is not elected.
“But when the House is elected and suppose yon
are a member?” “ I don’t suppose. Good morn
ing.”
One of tho alleged “ missions of IS.S.W.
Premier Dibbs to England is to try and persuade
the British Government to introduce a Bill to
permit trust-funds to be invested in colonial
securities. As such permission would probably
remove the bulk of the trust-funds now invested m
British consols from tho Imperial iroasury, John
Bull is very likely indeed to agree. __
Premier Playford has his eye r.n the S .A
Assembly Speaker’s e-hair.
The Sydney Trades and Labour Council
refused to join the Socialists in celebrating
Labour Day. A silly and unworthy jealousy
prompted the small majority to decline to take
part in what is fast becoming a world-wide move-
ment. However, Burgess, Petrie, Wilson and
others of the Council, by their presence at the
Sunday’s demonstration, disclaimed any respon-
sibility for the Council’s action.
A Granville (N.S.NV.) landowner pays £l3
per annum in municipal taxes on 9-1 acres of
unimproved land, having 13,000 feet of frontage
to Government roads. Near him arc IS wonc-
men’s cottages with 38 feet frontage and a depth
of 110 feet each ; and these pay much heavier
taxes than the big unearned-increment man. ihe
latter values his land already at £2OO an A
land-tax of Id. in the £ would cost him £7B os.
Bd. a year.
An ex-canvasser for the N.S.W. National
Association tills The Bulletin (apropos of the
Association’s statement that it challenges the
votes of friends and foes with equal impartiality,
its only object being to purify the rolls) that when
on the war-path ho, acting under instructions,
“ never went near a decent house or a freehold
property of any description.” “My dart,” he
said, “ was household qualifications and paitieu-
larly workmen’s cribs.”
The anticipated Victorian deficit for the
year is already stated at £1,500,000, to meet
which the. Ministry propose extra taxes 2d. per
gal. on beer, estimated to realise £lOO,OOO ; 2s.

“Walter Besant,” lays Sydney Echo, “is
a strong advocate for the con I federation of the
whole English-speaking race. He looks for war. I
with some hope to the day when England, and
Scotland, the United States, Canada, Australia,
Maorihnid, and the isles of. the 1 will foim
one magnificent confederacy, <!ce. _ Walter Lcsant
is also a strong advocate for Protection, and
suggests in one of his books that England should
put up her epitaph in huge letters over the Struts
of Dover for all the world to read, and that it
should run thus: “Suicided in defence of 1 iee-
trade.” The Echo doesn’t mention this point,
somehow. . .
One of the leaders of the local Socialist
party at Tampeluna (Spain) is alleged to have
Cecil murdered. Nobody knows who murdered
him—most probably some Government agent
but the cablegram.ner states that it isfcJm
(no authority given) that lie was killed V
Anarchists.” Then Sydney Echo drops out th
word “believed,” and states briefly theleuici
of the Socialists of Pam pal muff, as been murdered
hv the Anarchists,” whom it proceeds to denounce
as “ those worse than dogs,” who prey ever, on
their own relations.” What a difference it makes
to the average “ fair-minded paper when Us
enemy is too far off to raise a libel action !
It is about time that Moniington (L. L.
Smith’s pocket borough) took a step in a Down-
ward direction. Downward is always classified as
a Conservative, and L. L. Smith goes on the
Liberal tick.et, but the former can’t be more
offensively loyal and Hinglish than L.L., and he
has undoubtedly worked harder in a more modest
sort of way. The non-resident vote pulls the
mercurial doctor through. At Beaconslield,
Erankston and Cranboiirne, whither ground-
holders can run down comfortably from town, ho
polls more than the majority which puts him in,
whilst Moniington proper is 3 to 1 in favour o
Downward. In fact, Moniington is the one special
part of the electorate which Smith isn't member
for.
London financiers (says a cablegram) resent
the Maoriland Premier’s recent utterance that hi*
Government seeks to wean that country horn a
“ servile dependence on the London money-
market.’ Just so. The “beastly kawlmies are
ungrateful when they don’t fall ou their niuiow-
bones in gratitude to the London pawnbrokers for
favours bestowed at a better percentage than the
three-balls-men could secure anywhere else on as
good a security; and they are thankless and
unnatural wretches if they propose to become in-
dependent and self-supporting, and thus rob J.
Bull of his opportunities of usury. In short, Aus-
tralia is expected to borrow only when it suits
England', and to abstain from borrowing only
when England hasn’t got it to lend. “Vot,.' 1 D
you don’t vant to pawn your vest, then you vo got
to buy a vateh ! ”
A N.S,W. ■country resident I)ought an
excursion railway ticket recently for Sydney and
return. Business compelling him to overstay m
town the period for which his ticket was available,
ho sought the good offices of the member foi lhis
district, said member happening to be a Minister
of the Crown. The Minister asked the kail way
Commissioners to extend the period of his con-
stituent’s ticket, and felt hurt when his request
was officially refused. A few days later, it came
1o his cognisance that the Railway Department
had for three years been occupying, free of charge,
a portion of his official quarters, so hepiomptl>
got even by notifying the Commissioners to vacate
the said premises as soon as convenient, at the
same time forwarding them an account fur <£-■ lto
for back rent. The glorious system of govern-
ment by personal magnetism feels itself once more
vindicated. ___
Dear Builetin,— lie your article on the

circulated in Australia. In most back-country
townships tlic news-vendor combines many other
use'nl avocations with tint sale of brain-food.
Small change is usually taken in these sausngo-
wraps. For the Australian weekly published at

others of that ilk.— Mulga Ned.

Do women dress for each other, or for the
opposite sex ? A clever young woman has decided

A Western N.S.W. woman undertook last
week to “break the news gently ” to the Widow of
a poor man killed on the railway-line, ohe
knocked at the door: “Your husbands been
killed by a train. Cheer up, mum ;he was a fine

A Queensland bullock-driver spread ail
inch-thick layer of mustard over his bare chest,
wrapped some flannel around the plaster, and slept
peacefully till daybreak. Then he arose and
rinsed off the mustard and his skin, lie troubled

mortification and death.
It is suggested in Melbourne Standard
that Deeming be skinned after death and that
several volumes of the trial reports bo bound in
his hide, for presentation to Marshall Lyle, Miss
llounsevell, and the arresting detectives. Lut
why stop so short? Let Deemmg’s skull bo
mounted in silver, and presented to Gov. Hope-
toun as a christening-bowl. His shinbones would
make decent clubs for the local policemen who
dug up the corpse, and one of hi* thighbones, pro-
perly mounted, might officiate with dignity in
place of Victoria’s lost, stolen, or strayed parlia-
mentary mace. The remaining osseous fragments
should be divided up amongst the Melbourne
editors.
r I lie Victorian experiment of village settle-
ments as one narrow sluice-valve of opportunity
fur surplus labour, and which may be regarded
as fairly on its trial, will be watched with
interest. The venture, so far, is a private Scheme
organised mainly by Parson Horace Tucker.
Land has been secured by an association at
Jindivick, on the Tarago River, Vic., and the
first batch of 10 families, consisting of 47 persons,
was despatched there a few days ago. The plan
proposed is to locate each settlement in a district
where the settlers can be employed on wages part
of the year, and to allot to each family a 10-acre
patch on which earnings may be supplemented by
husbandry. Jindivick is in the midst of a fertile
area largely devoted to fruit-growing. The
settlers are to be encouraged to become freeholders
of their lots, by payments extended over 5 years,
with the small deposit of =£l as a required
preliminary. A collateral development with the
idea of village settlements is that the Victorian
Government has promised to bring in a Homestead
Settlements Bill, embracing a similar scheme of
combining wage-labor with independent tillage,
the area of the holdings to range from 5 to 20
acres.
Dear Bulletin, Zola, in “La Bete
Hnmaine,” has a character, one Lantier, an
engine-driver, who in many respects resembles
Deeming. Lantier is the helpless victim of an
inherited murderous instinct which has taken an
uncommon form. Ho luxs never felt the repio
ductive instinct aroused without its being suc-
ceeded by an overmastering desire to take the
life of the woman who has been the conscious or
unconscious cause of his emotion. He vaguely
ruao-ines that the origin of this terrible perversion
is a desire to revenge bimself upon women for
some great wrong inflicted upon him or his in the
remote and forgotten past. Lantier is represented
as a man of refinement and attractive appearance,
but is a member of a family through which runs a
nervous disease, which drives his brother to
suicide and oilier members of the family to various
special forms of insanity. On everything else he
is perfectly sane and even very intelligent ami
humane. When we compare him with that strange
monster Deeming, it is evident that in Lantier
Zo'a has shown us not an individual, but a type,

That Weary Feeling.
How common it is to meet persons who Gomplai.n
„f being tired, languid, who are suffering from
debility, or from loss of energy and strength, more
especially during the summer months than at
other times. The causes vwhich lead (to these
symptoms can readily be found jf the condition of
the blood is examined. It will be found to be
heavily charged with carbonic acid, imperfectly
.cleansed by the oxygen which reaches the blood
through the lungs, and by the action of the
kidneys, which ■should take out of the blood the
poisonous elements—urea and uric acid. It is not
•strange that such persons should suffer constantly
from malaise, tired f ceilings, debbty and loss of
rtreiiglh. They endeavour hy the use of tonic
medicines to overcome the difficulty, but these are,
not effective. They do not remove the cause-, they
do not c'cause the l oad. Such a .result is always
obtained by freely using Warner s Safe Cure and
Warner’s Safe Pills. We commend them as sure
remedies, which will not only remove the con-
ditions mentioned, but .will also ..thoroughly puul y
the blood. Look again at the Permamnt Itesn ts.
There are many remedies in the world, as-well as
many doctors, -who. e treatment gives temporary
relief, yet the .one remedy that produces a .per-
manenfc e tiro- — roiioi\n f j (the cause-- is 'W ainei s

A “ crowded and enthusiastic meeting ” has,'
£t seems, been held in Rangoon, with the object of

tended by all the most influential Moslems,
and a committee appointed to raise funds in

taken for granted j

Williams making his ling speech in the
'dock with staring, anxious eyes turned towards the
jury, was the unmistakoable original of the Rock-
hampton photo, published in The Bulletin a
few weeks ago. The man’s full or three-quarter
face is weak and sometimes young-looking,
whereas Ins profile is full of strange character, and
the wrinkles round his eyes and the furrows in his
receding brow might belong to a keen old fellow
■of GO. He reddens as lie laughs, and from any
point of view appears to most advantage when his
fancy is genuinely tickled, as it was by the cough
<of Walsh. Q.C., during the Judge’s summing up.
Walsh, with a “voice like the squeak of a con-
sumptive shrimp” and a cough to match, had been
■a fund of amusement to him all the while. It is
Williams’ grin that gives the wild animal away.
He hasn’t educated himself up to cool contempt
and a refined sneer. His insolence is vulgar,
aggressive and villainous. Addressing the jury
be occasionally struck a soft spot in the heart of
the court, although, for a Lancashire man, he puts
very little pathos into the familiar West of
England tune. But when lie sassed the Judge
and stiffened his straight upper-lip under the final
ordeal, the poor devil excited no compassion. It
is one thing to meet trouble like a man, and
another thing to meet it like a nasty little beast.

Sheriff Anderson gave a certain tone to
the Williams trial, especially after dusk. In his
official dress, and behind the judicial candles, he
presented the appearance of an elderly, languid
swell who had been called away from a dinner-
party to sit on the Bench and play the part of
n distinguished patron. The entertainment .bored
bim dreadfully though. Considering that hp was
likely to have to demand the body of Williams
(from somebody in a few days time, the Sheriff
■seemed singularly indifferent on the subject. One
•expected him to take a keen personal interest in
Williams’ body, instead of which he gave every-
body the impression that the sudden
•ance of the plumber by spontaneous combustion
wouldn’t matter a rap to tlie Sheriff. Sheriffs are
supposed to be fat, unwieldy persons who glare at
itho prisoner in the dock and wag their heads
approvingly whenever the prosecution gives him
beans. Anderson doesn’t increase the horror of
the scene in this way. He would prefer, appar-
ently, to propose the Judge’s health in the usual
meat speech, and then clear off in a cab.

The witnesses engaged in the Deeming
trial, when ordered out of court, were herded to-
gether in another court close by until wanted.
The press-room was opposite this cave of Adn'lam,
and some of the witnesses preferred it to the larger
and colder apartment. Hence, it was no uncom-
mon thing on any of the four days fur the scribes
on returning to their sanctum after an adjourn-
ment to find Katie Rounsevell and her sister toast-
ing their little toes at the press-fire and chatting
pleasantly with two constables over bread and
.cheese and bottled boor.

Deakin made mincemeat of Dr. Shields
when he came to cross-examine that Government
functionary on the proofs of Williams’- sanity
Shields had found Colston to be sane because be
approved of the Ten Commandments and generally
spoke the truth. For exactly opposite reasons ho
considered “this man” equally responsible for
his actions. “This man” lied like a tombstone
and didn’t care for the Commandments at all.
The prison doctor’s tost was reversible, it appeared,
and if one side of it didn’t meet the prisoner’s
case the other one was bound to do the trick.

The “ Windsor Murder ” group at Mel-
bourne Waxworks is fixed up in the little ante-
room formerly set apart for Kreitmayer’s master-
piece, “ The Widow’s Mite.” A gruesome
suspicion that the two chief characters in the
Biblical tableau were melted down into Williams
and the corpse has got abroad, but there is no
truth in it. The Widow, it appears, has been
taken on tour by Kreitmayer, together with G. N.
'Baylor, Larkins, Cleary, and a duplicate of the
Hearthstone Horror aforesaid. What a beautiful
moral is taught by that travelling waxworks !
Better for the Widow to drop her little thrup’ny
in the bag and lay up treasure in heaven than to
deposit it in a land-boom bank, or a South Mel-
bourne building-society.

The newspapers have it that Williams took
the verdict with perfect composure. Hardly.
When Judge Hodges was reading the jury’s

affecting to fossick in bis ciat-pocket for the,slip
of paper on which he had prepared his last
remarks. Whilst making these remarks lie

his right moved a step nearer, evidently thinking

The other morning in a N.S.W. Govern-
ment Department a subordinate knocked at the
door of his chief, and receiving no answer
attempted to enter. The door yielded but an
inch or two, and from the character of the resist-
ance on the other side, the horrified subordinate
concluded that his boss was in a fit.' Then five
men threw themselves upon the door and forced it
open. The senseless form of the boss was upon
the floor, his knees tucked up to his chin, his hat
upon his brow. Then, remembering how he
slumbered right through the uproar of last Mel-
bourne Cup they left him alone in his glorious
snooze. Some few months back this same Civil
servant went to office on Sunday morning. He

A couple of years ago, a IM (N.S.W.)
selector was sued by his lady-love for maintenance.
There was overwhelming evidence to prove that
the charmer had many admirers, so she was cast
out on a pitiless work 1 , with li >r fatherless child.
Subsequently, what Sara Bernhardt calls another
“little accident” befell her, and this time she
“summonsed ” a second man successfully. A few
weeks after, the first old love appeared with her
before the local priest. “ You wish to be married ?”
inquired the priest. “Yes. There is nothing so
sweet as our first love, and I’ve always been
jealous of her; somehow she knows how to keep
me jealous. I can’t rest aisy until I marry her.’
The priest joined them and blessed them. Truly,
love is a romantic passion.

One of tlie people who attended the last

Guvnah and Her Ex. The set was already com-
plete, so the M.C. expostulated. Then the out-
raged spouse of the local dignitary snapped her
fingers in the M.C.’s face and shrieked to her
husband : “Look at ’iin. Pooh ! Hm M.C. hover

The Womanhood Suffrage Bill has just
been narrowly defeated in the Commons. When
woman does got the suffrage the much-married
woman will want more votes thin the single
woman, because, iu the children, she has “a stake
in the country.” Si the Dear Children Suffrage
Billjwill come along, and after this Baby must
have a vote, bless its heart. Consequently, the
only man of importance will bo the one who has
fourteen cradles going at once, and when he
becomes Premier his wife will want the Head of
the Opposition for the baby to play with, and the
gaping infant will probably end up Gy putting that
dignitary’s nose in its mouth and burning its
tongue.

Th o- Flemington and Caulfield magnates
have at last decided to suppress those females
afflicted to hanging around the gates on race days
and asking members of the club to pass them
through. A member who ventured to tie Ids
ticket to his coat button and walk up to the gates
without his full complement of ladies (2) in
attendance, was always a fair mark for the
charmers who wanted to get into the show
“on the never.” They seemed to work in
unison, and probably drew lots for the
order in which they should waddle, or glide, up
to the next member with a vacancy to spare, and
cadge his company through the barriers. As a
rule, the attacked party gave way, for want of
pluck to say “no,” and the result, for years past,
has been a steady increase, in the army of
courtesans and fat women who “ were to meet a
gentleman who must have passed through without
seeing them.” Henceforth a policeman or two
will be engaged to look after these fraudulent
dead-heads, and if they- are seen swooping down
upon stray members the law will run them in for
soliciting in a public place, or inciting an innocent
stringer to commit a felony.

The gravedigger at Penshurst (Vic.) got
badly “left ” the-other day. It was the custom of
this humorist to get even with his enemies by
digging their graves when they fell sick, and
publicly announcing that he had done so. He
performed this delightful operation for a well-
known resident a fortnight ago, and put in the
time waiting for his victim, who was very ill, by
asking the latter's friends when he might expect
the corpse? Sad to say, however, the corpse that
was to be got well, but mean while the man-planter
himself pegged out, and was buried in the very

Joseph Clarke’s prosecution of his old friend
Mrs. Clara Parker for forgery promises to be a
humorous case. The preliminary hearing at
Melbourne City Court has elicited the fact that
portly Joseph “lent” the lady some £BOOO or so,
on the hazy understanding that she was putting it
into a swamp—Kooweerup Swamp. After a few
years of cashing up Joseph got tired, and then his
fair friend squeezed another £550 out of him “ as
a consideration for any claims in an action she
threatened to bring for not going on with the
swamp.” Finally Joseph went down to the
swamp and “found that the property was noth-
ing at all,’ but what sort of property he expected
to find in a swamp didn't come out in evidence.
All he knows for certain is that his money was
swamped. Mrs. Parker used the swamp as a
name to conjure with. “Did she just come and
say ‘ Kooweerup ’ and you would hand her £5OO,
or whatever the amount she wanted ? ” was one of
the questions put to Clarke. “Yes. and more
fool I,” replied the-rich man. Yet, after all, the
exact word employed by lovely woman to raise
specie with is a matter of small consequence.
There are syrens who obtain tens of thousands by
simply beaming on a male friend from time to
time, and saying “Ducky!” If the Pickwickian
expression “chops and tomato sauce” was sus-
ceptible of an amorous interpretation, who can
fathom the depth of mystic meaning in “Koowce-
rup?”—
A ladies' debating society at Cacnnavtlicn
(U.K.) lately discussed the question, “Should
ladies open their husbands’ letters?” After two
nights’ talk, it was resolved by. an overwhelming
majority that they should. That debating society
doesn’t know its business. The real question is,
how ladies are to shut their husbands’ letters again,
so that no one will know the difference. Any
woman can open a man’s letters, but to seal thorn
up again is a work of art.

Two wildly dishevelled foreigners—H. E.
Seguy, Frenchman, and an anonymous individual
signing himself “ A German ” —are holding a cat-
chorus in Sydney D.T., and abusing each other’s
country gaily. The German began the uproar,
being aggravated thereto by Max O’Rell’s lectures,
and the Frenchman started after him. Both are
fearful examples of “English as she am spoked,”
or rather as she am tried to be spoked under
difficulties. A slab from the German :
A President of the U.S.A. shows his gratitude by receiv-
ing any American at the White House who wishes to shake
hands with him for his successful victory of being elected
as such by them, and as a matter of courtesy acts the
same way to English taxpayers. As a Royalist, as Mnns.
Blouiit expresses himself to be, should ho make such
remarks about princes? Why should they be obliged to
receive English Tax Payers as long as they are doomed
with an independent income and Power before they see
the light of their mother’s bedchamber? .... To
what extent did the Germans sweep the offices for John
Bull at London? If they did, what a glory to them to
divide their time so nicely, and lick the French besides. I
guess at that time the enthusiastic Frenchman was an
English Tax Payer. This great duke refers to Germans
and Swedes, etc., to become the best naturalised citizens
of the States as soon as they are long enough in that
country. Why shouldn’t they ? Whoever is so furious
overjoyed with their native country should stay there,
Mous. Blouet being one of them. . . After all, there is
as much love for liis country in a German as there is in a
Frenchman, which was proved well enough whenever
their Fatherland was subjected to the bloody, unreason-
able furies of the nation they call the French which were
not so awful long ago.
Now for the Frenchman :
Cher Monsieur,—Being a Frenchman, I reaa with in-
terest a letter in yoUr valuable paper of the Glh and
signed “ A Germand.” I cannot let it pass unnoticed, as
it strike me as being a great deal of nonsense in it, and
why Mr. Max O’Rell’s lecture on John Bull should draw
this German out I cannot conceive. In the first place he
ask in what manner John Bull gives the German Princes
out-door relief. Well, if he does not know, he ought to bo
told, and I will leave that for Mr. Max O’Rell to answer,
or any very young English school hoy. He strike me
forcibly that Max O’Rell is as staunch Royalist, hut
lecturing before an audience on the pecularity of a Nation
and showing their dis-Royalty does not prove he is not
loyal, and to prove this practically Max O’Rell was an
officer in the French army and fought for his country in
the Franco-German war. He was not an English tax-
payer as your correspondent said. Possible he a German
at that time was some where in England playing the
trombone in the street and picking up English coppers, or
he was selling contraband cigard at Melbourne nr Sydney.
They do sweep John Bull office at London. What Max
OTlell said is a certainty, and German clerk, it is well
know, leave their country by thousands every month to
seek an existence, not a living, in the Great city of Lon-
don. Max O’Rell being a Frenchman is enough to raise a
German bad nature.
So far, honours are about even.

What a fascinating book the secret history
of Mount Morgan would make ! Rockhampton
possesses a butcher’s assistant who, three years
ago, was worth eighty thousand pounds in cash.
He was the possessor of a snug butchering estab-
lishment, and had bought a few hundred Morgans
at par. (£1). The shares went up, and he sold out,
only to buy in again ; and so the deal went on.
He was anxious to sell at ills, but his adviser
persuaded him they would see -620 —and he bough t
more, giving bills for the major amount of the
transaction. And then someone pricked the.
bubble, and then crash ! and everything was gone.
The vendor took his other Mount Morgan shares
(lodged as security) for payment of those he had
lately bought, and the one-time .£BO,OOO capitalist
is now an assistant in the butcher s shop that v as
his. His adviser was—but wild horses will not

We smile at the well-advertised, but guile-

ness ” in your esteemed friend, the bull-pup-faced
man of nerve, who is ever the most congenial com-
panion of the man of nerves, is “obstinacy,”
brutal, donkeyfied obstinacy, in the fellow you
don’t like. Society can only see unbridled lust
an 1 murderous savagery in the face of the man
who has been convicted of these things. It can
never perceive these things in the face of the man
who sits on the bench. Yet the man whose con n .
tenanco most resembles Deeming’s has a soft se a t
on the judicial bench and enjoys between £lsoo
and .£3OOO a year from the State Treasury of a
British colony. He will probably never get into
the condemned cell, because, as the colonists have
had occasion to notice from time to time, he can, in
the exercise of his “ stern duty to society,” indulge

honour of the new Governor. There is no poetry
in the average groveller’s mean little soul. The
other Maoriland lakes have native names thnn-
sound like sweet music and convey poetic mean-
ings, and among, them the intrusive white clr.-dl
proposes to insert the -harsh-sounding cognomem
of a great, dirty, dark, slush-laden, fog-hauntedl
city that festers by a dank, foul river at the-
other end of the earth. There are not event
any historic associations worth mentioning about:
Glasgow; it is all given up to mud and smells;
and cotton, and great, gaunt, loathsome factories
and there is something horribly incongruous about-
the idea of transferring its name to the glassy
waters and snow-clad peaks of Maoriland. The
man who could be guilty of such an act of van-
dalism would abolish sweet-sounding Manapourii
and re-christen it Porkgoggles, if he had a chance'
to oblige some imported nonentity by so doing,
and he would wipe out the name of grand, solemn,,
old Te Auau, and re-name it Lake Macintosh or
Ilamfat Waters. And when he has successfully
christened his blue inland sea as Lake Glasgow,,
the unfortunate thing is that the name will stick.
The plain, hard-shell Presbyterian whose title is
redolent of the unclean city by the ditch will,
vanish away and bo forgotten, but his uncouth'
designation will keep on for ever. It is a horrible-
thing to think of, and the man who conceived the-
i lea should be exiled to Glasgow straight off, and 1
doomed to live in the Gallowgato for the rest of
Lis days,

A Collins-street (Melb.) building society
has swooped down in wholesale fashion upon the'
furniture of its unfortunate borrowers in arrear,,
upon whom the society’s mortgage and defeasance'
deeds give it power to distrain. In fact, as a rule,,
borrowers are only fortnightly tenants of any

Tuaviiv— Martain.— On the Ist inst., at Cubbing, by
the Rev. H. 0. George, Miss Hannah Martain, second
daughter of Mr. Martain, and second niece of Mr. 0. IP..
Martain, of the Royal Engineers, to Mr. Henry Turvey, off
York, and father of Manchester. The marriage was cele-
brated at the house of the father of the bride, and a very
sociable and pleasant gathering 1 was-the result, and one
had it occurred previously would have caused our presentt
Ministry to have brought the railway through Cubbine

A member of the Melbourne journalists’'
association has his best yarn about a hangman. In a
Victorian town, 200 miles from Melbourne, ibo
prison comprised Jack the Buster and Tassy (from
old Van Diemen’s Land) amid its inmates. Jack
and Tassy were old “t’other side ” pals, and Jack
had to be hanged, but Cobb’s people refused to fetch:
Jack Ketch from Melbourne, because lie bad got
drunk on a former occasion. So Tassy, with many
tears, affectionately hung the Buster—after all the
other prisoners had refused—and shook the dusf-
off his feet with £5 in his pocket.
A Sydney daily paper has printed a half-
column from “A ” who, after being
absent from N.S.W. forSOyears, has returned and
complains that there are people who, at local
Anglican services, bob at the wrong time, or do
not bob at the right time, or bob too much or too ■
little, or something. The abject imbecility of this
kind of thing is about on a par with the monstrous
self-conceit of this brand of pietist in assuming
that the Unknowable cares one jot whether the
public bend their necks, or crook their knees, or
waggle their tails, or stand upon their heads, for
that matter.

Extract from Father O’Farrell’s sermon in;
St. Francis Church, Melbourne : “ I feed thankful
to God for the prevailing depression as the present •
scarcity of money will cause a great decrease of
sin.” Thus does the holy preacher bear up withi
Christian fortitude against other people’s misfor-
tunes, and feel that it is all for the best, after'
which the usual collection is made.

people talk of cutting out the mus e from some of :
the services, owing to the contracted area of the>
collections. “ The prevailing depression” again.
We never thought much of the House
Whose rotten foundation is “ birth ; n
Where nobles without any nous
Made laws for a lot of the earth.
We never were struck on the peers
Who govern by family right,
But we hoped for a good many years
Their skins would be passably white.
It never occurred to us that
The time was so nearly at hand
When a nigger as black as your hat
Would rank as a lord of the land.
Great Britons, the same as before,
May boss those ridiculous waves,
But we hardly can hint any move
That none of their mothers were slaves.
The bloated supporters of “ blood ”
Must see what a mess they are in,
Now Hingland has set up a lad
Who sprang from an ebony gin.
Yet worse may be lurking behind ;
Let nothing astonish us now—
For soon we shall probably find
That a duke is the son of a Chow. ’

A British ironmaster recently informed
London Daily News that, in his own furnaces,
the royalty of (is. a ton paid on ironstone amounted
to =£15,000 a year, the whole of which went to the
landlords, while the men who raised the stone
only earned <£7500 a year wages in all. The land-
lord thus gets twice as much for lazing as the
whole of the men together get for sweating.

The Automaton “ ALI ” during the lasi month has been
on view at Collins’s Music Hall, Islington. A new Auto-
maton which the inventor, A. De Lacy, has termed
“ALI,” following custom immortal; the figure is dressed
in a turban and Oriental costume, it is worked by elabo-
rate wire works, the motive power being electricity. The
movements are natural and lifelike, and paradoxical
as it may seem it has not the appearance of being an
Automaton. “ALI” turns the leaves of the Koran,
becomes warlike and goes through sword exercise, plays
tambourine and hells, and altogether completely succeeds
in engrossing ths attention of the audience, in interesting
them, and winning loud applause. The whole network of
wire, by which the movements of I lie figure arc deter-
mined, is exposed by the Inventor, Mr, Dp Lacy, «ln
must have taken years to have brought his mechanical
figure to pci fed ion.

CORRESPONDENCE
•\ o notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped.
“E.C.0.”: It is not customary for the bride
to be kissed by the officiating clergyman—at the
wedding ceremony, at all events...." H. 8.” : We
don’t guarantee it —not we.... “ J.W.” : We aim at
originality, but often fail, as We can’t read every paper in
the w0r1d.... “ Mutations ” : Very good indeed....” Bush-
man Phil.”: Too improbable....“ A. M‘K.” (G., Q.):
Thanks, but when you write, cut it down and send con-
centrated essence. Queensland is full of good things. All
good things Australian come from the bush—and from
Queensland. There are no brains in the cities “A.K.”
(B.): He who labels his verse, or sketch, or paper,
"comic,” is always a fat-headed, stupid ass. “Comi-
cality” is trio twin-brother of congenital idiocy...
“Knarf”; Previously to hand; thanks .. “One of
Four ” ; Send us something new. Life too short to quibble
over immaterialities;... “ Australian Native ” : To hand.
.... “ Geo. M.” (St. George); Sketch much below standard
artistically and contains no strong idea.... “H. E. Bach”:
Thanks “C. W. Darvall” (B.); Send it a10ng....
“Justice”: Received with thanks....“ Queenslander ” :
The person you call Johnson dies in the first page of your
story, and yet is alive again on the fourth. This resurrec-
tion of Johnson is too much “1.C.G.” (Beeac): A story
in which a small boy breaks Iris log in Scotland and then
thirty-two years elapse is a delusion. Why do the thirty-
two years elapse? “Mark Twill”: A tale isn’t neces-
sarily humorous because it has an Irish policeman named
Casey in it, and he gets drunk and is found naked on a
verandah “ Disciple” (Bundaberg); Will consider....
“ P.T.F.” : Story no good ; moreover, the average navvy
doesn’t talk like a college professor....“ Blackham ” :
When you send six pages of adulation about an obscure
bush politician, we naturally presume that you are the
politician in person “Tornhana”: Thanks. Try it....
“ F.J.” (North Sydney): Your intentions are doubtless
honourable, but your poem is remarkably weak...." Ed.
Kay”: Why do the females in your story rush about so
wildly in cabs for no visible purpose, and who is “ Nell,”
and where does “Tom” get to ?....“ F.W.S.P.” (Surry
Hills): Declined. No one would wade through a shore-
less sea of figures...." Barrowmaniac” ; What do you
mean by speaking of j our “ eugolislic lints,” anyhow ?...
"Neogilus” (Broken Hill); The dust of Broken Hill is
100 old a subject in this dusty land . “C.R.M.”
(Bathurst): Regret we are not an authority on clay.
We are a whale at cement, though....“ Muiga Ned ”:
Too long, and the cook is left unhanged at the end after
all. We had a gleam of hope on page 11, when he was
imprisoned in the meat house "Lloege ” . (1) Our last
reply was not an “acknowledgment of defeat,” and no
one but a wil ul perverter of the truth could say it was.
(2) Your “ thanks for a very interesting corresponded e ”
is altogether one-sxb d ; your end of the correspondence
wasn’t at all interesting. (3) As a fair example of your
veracity you claim to have a list from a large Sydney
firm which states that the price of tools has risen
through Protection. Now it so happens that tools are on
the N.S. W. free list. If they rise it is through Free trade...
“ J.J.D.” (Zeehan): A man who complains because liehas
to walk 10 miles on a muddy road isn’t much of a pro-
spector. When we went prospecting there never was any
road, and we had to sleep on a mountain top to keep out
of the slush “A.E.” (Broken Hill): A very plain
incident, and not calculated to disturb anybody’s mother.
... “J.L.M.” (Malvern): We are trying to bear up
against the undeserved calamity of having your poem
“written specially” for u 5.... “Moses” :. Good story.
Don’t trouble asserting that it is “ strictly true.” A joke
isn’t supposed to be true. It is only the dreary items
that w e want to verify . “ A Swag-man ” : AA’e never jet
met a teetotal poem which wasn’t lame and blind and im-
becile. The trail of five pump is over your verses just like
the rest.... “Spider” (Christchurch, M.L.): Thanks
“A.R.8.”: It appeared the Xmas before last. Sorry we
can’t supply you w ith a copy of that issue “O’C.”:
When the talk’s of glorious and generous England, we
always call up Tom Nast’s cartoon. There is John Bull
as Jack Horner, with the globe as his plum-pudding, out
of which he has cut a monstrous chunk, but is howling
because someone else wants a very little bit....“ A.A.C.” :
Phrenology is a noble science and most accurate—when
there’s a judge and jury and damning witnesses to sup-
port its exponent beforehand.. .“The Old Identity”
(Georgetown, N.Q.): The publication of your “desperado”
item would cause 20,000 other readers'to curse us for its
mystery...“Rata”(Burketown, N.Q.): Yarn unpalatable
in its present dress ; may use it up somehow “Cum-
shaw ” : On the subject of Kanaka labour, the Lilley and
the Rose are at variance “J. AY. Toole ”: The chief
reason whj' professional men are not allowed by their
guilds to advertise is that it would cut down prices
“Mahatma”: Your ghost-story already told a million
times. . “ W.S.” (Wellington): AVe don’t care for paro-
dies as a rule. Parody is generally only a disguise for
lack of originality. Also, we don’t care for poems about
Elisha—that prophet is too dead; and, moreover, the
world isn’t improved by spelling God with a small “g.”
“T.R.S.” (Longreach): Your idea is merely an expan-
sion of the legacy-duty principle which Tim Bulletin has
always supported. You can’t apply your theory indis-
criminately. The widow with eight children who inherits
£lOO from her deceased husband can’t afford to lend
aquarter of it to the State even at 6 per cent “ J.C.”
(AVangaratta): Poetry inferior. Biography of Henry
Jenkins not interesting. Story of how you were locked
out in your shirt too like Max Adder's tale of how he was
locked out in the same short, cold garment “H.C.S.”
(AA’oollahra): Ruined for want of climax. The fight scops
before anybody is hurt, and the falling building kills
nobody “Shepherd Prince ” : AVe are tired of hearing
about the “ Branch Kingdom of Israel ” and the alleged
Babylonian potentate “ authorised by Lord Salisbury to
steal your letters.”... “ Ginx ”: Thanks. AVill consider.
(Many replies held over.)
HE BOUGHT A SORSE
IV/TY dear,’’ began Mr. Cityman, as he
entered bis suburban home the othe r
evening in apparently high spirits, “I did a good
stroke of business to-day.” “ Indeed ! And what
was that?” archly inquired Mrs. C,, with a well-
meant though unsuccessful attempt to appear
interested. “Nothing short of a dead bargain.
I am going to utilise the old stable where the fowls
are housed, and I mean to ride into town every
day. It will benefit my health, and I won’t have
to hang around the streets waiting for a’bus.”
“So you have bought a horse then?” was the acid
rejoinder. “Of course I have ; you don’t suppose
l cl buy a donkey, or a mule, or a dromedary, or a
locomotive, or ” “ Well,” broke in Mrs. C. in
conciliatory tones, “I didn’t know that you
could manage a horse, and besides, I should have
thought—” “Oh, certainly,” snapped out Mr.
Cityman, “you’re always thinking instead of
making sure. But when you see me coming in
after a rattling good canter you’ll change your
tune. 1 tell you this horse is a beauty, and no
mistake, quiet as a child, no vice about him, good
pacer, and warranted not to shy or cut up capers.”
Jtarly the following morning the steed was
brought home and handed over, and the proud
owner, after several desperate tries, finally
succeeded in climbing into the saddle and set off
for town. There was no wind to speak of that
d;iy, and a small boy on the wayside was frantic-
ally endeavouring to persuade a reca’citrant kite
into a recognition that it was destined for a
nobler career than scraping up road metal, when
a spry horse and a perspiring, doubled-up
equestrian hove in sight. There was a busy
eX u C ’ t v llg . t,irie . or a b°ut three minutes, during
which the air was filled with profanity and
buttons and things, and then a riderless horse
might be seen ambling peacefully down the road
as if nothing had happened. Mr. Cityman took
thene_xt bus home, where he humbly submitted
himself for repairs. These his wife soon effected
with the aid of a valuable family remedy always
kept in stock by her. The next day a horse was
advertised “for sale, cheap,” and Mr. C., while
distinctly disclaiming all desire to “make an
advertisement of himself,” felt bound to admit
that his wife was right again when she preached
the doctrine that St. Jacobs Oil for the absolute
relief and cure of contusions, sprains, and bruises
knows no rival. All chemists and storekeepers
sell it.

The Wild-Cat Column.
Heaven grant t'kat shortly some attempt will be
made to clear two-thirds, or at least one-half, of the
mining men, so-called, that loaf about Pitt-street, Sydney,
between King and Bridge Streets. Times have changed,
and so have they. There was a time when they were
more or less excited, but now they amble aimlessly,
dejectedly, about; going from the P.O. Chambers to the
Empire Hotel only to meander listlessly back again. Their
clothes are getting rusty and beastly familiar to the
much-bled public, whose eye revolts at the sight of these
wild, hungry spiders standing at the doors of their webs.
A rush to any new gold-field would cause a temporary
exodus, another boom would agitate them, and in time
they would be resplendent in fine linen and raiment that
would be a transformation. There is a tremendous field
in Africa for them if they could only get there. A scheme
to take, say 50, there would receive the writer’s cordial
■support. Besides, there’s money in it! Strangers in a
strange land, they would take the residents in and boom
things. Australia could spare them, at any rate until
next boom. They consist largely of “mining experts;”
most of them are lazy humbugs; and nearly all now arc
brokers of the stoniest description.

Here we are again. Faulkner's, P ainbula, N.S.W.,
reports The double whip-hauling gear is a perfect
success and a great boon.” It must be obvious that the
future of that field bangs on a whip-pole, and now that
Faulkners have gone in for a double one —it must have cost
£s—dividends are assured. The public will watch the
progress of that “great boon ” with breathless anxiety.
# # *
It is good news to hear that little Louis Beyers
has at last struck it again at Hill End—this time in Pax-
ton’s old claim, of which lie is manager and one of the
largest shareholders. It is premature to say whether the
discovery is a patch or a permanent run of gold, but if it
is true that it has been made some distance from the old
hanging-wall and in a part of the country never before
intersected, it may lie the means of reviving the grand old
field which returned some nine tons of gold from the
smallest quantity of stone known in any part of the
world.
# * *
The Garden Gully United is again to the front
heading the Bendigo yields. For many years it never
passed a fortnight without a dividend ; its shares were at
pence, jumped, and remained at pounds for some ten
years ; after tons of gold had been raised they receded to
shillings, and inasmuch as the present crushings are
coining from a big body at a great depth shareholders are
having visions of"another long dividend-paying period.
# * *
Perhaps the truest fissure reef in New South
Wales is that of Mitchell’s Creek Co., a few miles
out of Wellington. It has an underlie of 45
degrees. The formation is diorite, the ore quartz con-
taining, below water level, five to ten per cent, of copper,
iron, and arsenical pyrites. They never see a speck of
free gold, although ordinary crushing liberates half-
an-oz.; the balance, up to an oz. to the ton, is obtained
from the pyrites. It is a 640-acre freehold, owned by four
men, who have obtained during the last 18 months some
£20,000 worth of gold at a good profit. The last lift, at a
depth of 500 feet, is looking all right for a long continu-
ance of good crushing. It appears to be a long run of
gold as distinguished from narrow shoots—hence the
value of the property.
# * *
The Hazellmrst mine at Parkes, N.S.W., con-
sists of an acre, in which there was, up to some months
ago, a rattling shoot of rich gold, out of which the Orange
school of mining speculators expected to make a big
thing. Hazelhurst, the former holder, after making some
thousands, sold it to the Orange crowd for £16,000, and
they have been sadly left with it.
# * *
The curse of N S.W. mining is the amount of
capital for which most of its mines are floated; of this
the greed of vendors and the gullibility of the public are
the causes. To satisfy the owners with an enormous
bundle of paid-up scrip, the “under offer’’-man with
another bundle, some for the brokers, provisional direc-
tors, and other middlemen, the capital is made £lOO,OOO.
At last—vears too late—that great animal, the public, has
awakened to the gruesome fact that it requires 12500z5.
of refined gold over and above the quantity required for
working and managerial expenses to pay one shilling
dividend on £lOO,OOO capital, and that the bulk of the
capital on which the shilling dividend has to be paid is a
fraud, a delusion, and a snare. Not one gold mine in a
thousand when floated justifies £lOO,OOO capital. It is a
monstrous swindle, engendered by the idea that the
public, when buying, seldom ask the amount of capital,
and therefore there is no proportionate difference in the
price per share whether £50,000 or £lOO,OOO. At Bendigo,
by usa<>-e, not by law, they have a customary capital of
£24,000. Why?' Because every penny represents exactly
£lOO-e.g., sixpehnv call or dividend, £6OO. Every
attempt to increase" it has been successfully opposed.
Would that N.S.W. had taken a leaf out of the Bendigo
hook. It will in time, and the sooner the better.
* * %
A tale of a Northern mine that, during a boom,
went up like a rocket and came down like a stick. It was
placed on the market with a supposed capital of £lOO,OOO
represented by 200,000 shares of 10s. each, 80,000 being
paid up, and the remaining 120,000 offered at 6d. per
share on application and Od. on allotment. As a noted
firm of boss manoeuvrers was prominently identified with
the scheme, lots of genuine small men applied tor shares,
sending ii deposits ranging from £5O to ±lOO. Believing
that a boom could he worked in a fashion similar to that
which had frequently been successful, the promoters
hluffingly relumed most of these deposits, declaring that
the shares had all been rushed for and had been allotted.
In due time, the local exchange quoted the shares,
“Buyers, 3s. ; sellers, 3s. 6d. ;” and sales were reported
as having been made. Now was the orthodox time fot the
harvest \ hut, somehow or other, the bottom had dropped
out of the boom, and the original genuine customers
didn’t bite at the expected 3s. or 4s. per share which was
to have taken the place of the “fid. on application and
fid. on allotment.” Later, the shares went down to zero.
Later still, 29,000 of them that were supposed to he for-
feited were bought in at auction by a boomers’ jackal for
3d. and Id. per share ; and, yet later, 34,904 were taken by
the same party at id. Yet, so dense is human stupidity,
and so sanguine is human that these shares will
probably yet cost a few hundreds of decent people their
individual ruin.
* * *
On an Australian goldfield not so very long ago,
several alleged goldmines went bung simultaneously,
their total liabilities amounting to £350. A legal firm
which bossed their liquidation managed to squeeze about
£3750 out of the sqiie zahle shareholders, who were
harassed by every artifice known to law—and mining law
at that. Many decent citizens saw the inside of a gaol
in consequence of inability or unwillingness to comply
with tiie terms of judgments. Yet, not more than some
£5O ever found its way into the pockets of the creditors
of the bust-up companies.
# # *
The N.S.W. Supreme Court decision against
Mount Chalmers (Q.) Gold-mining Co., which was a N.S.W.
registered no-liability company mining in Queensland
really amounts to a ruling that mere shareholders in such
a co. have no legally sustainable interest whatever in it;
that, in short, it is personally and collectively owned by
the directors. In the case of a golden-gallened claim,
this would be perditionally rough on common shareholders,
and a glorious pool for the directors. However, the rule
cuts both ways. If the directors own the mine, they are
also legally responsible for all tire debts of the alleged
no-liability co., and, if the claim turns out a duffer, they
..can lie compelled to fork out, if they are worth powder
and shot.” The Act suggests several schemesEithei
make all shareholders directors; or else select assured
paupers as directors. By the first, all would equally sink
or swim ;by the second, the “company could laugh at
its creditors. After all, the simplest plan would he a

vinces, that every mining company must be registered

A recently-imported Ilinglish swell recklessly
proceeded to 'cam out a conceived idea of prospecting
for gold through N. Queensland, all by himself. He
avoided white men as being altogether deoeitfui and
overfond of taking rises out of new chums, hut he fancied
that he had struck an original.plan in proposing to pump
any stray hlackfellowa as to the geological features of the
country ahead. In due course of travelling he en-
countered a tribe of peaceful, but unclad niggers who
surrounded him for “hacea.” Here was evidently an
opportunity, and he rose to it. Courteously addressing
the skin-scarred warrior who looked most like the chief, the
Englishman said : “May I presume to ask your highness
if, during the course of your recent peregrinations
through the vast interior, you have ever observed any
surface indications of a mineralogical formation that
would lead you to surmise that they conceal auriferous
deposits?” The obliging blackfellow instantly responded,
with a melodious laugh, “Yowi ; brudder belong ame

The new smelter at Argenton, West coast of
Tasmania, has been christened the Lady Hamilton. It is
to he hoped she will be more free with her silver than her
godmother.
* # *
When Sir Robert Hamilton recently visited the
silver mines on the Tasmanian West coast, the miners
“chalked his feet” with traditional care, but His Ex.
never responded with a single shilling. His economical
style did not impress the sons of toil “deep in the dark-
some mine/* and one or two thought his elongated
secretary might answer up hotter. But it was all in vain.
As one miner said, “both of the beauties has had their
galena pinched out.”

What has become of the Bonang Co. ? asks a
sickened shareholder. It is dead, although an attempt at
its resurrection is about to be made. Its history Short,
rich shoot of quartz, water troublesome, capital £lOO,OOO
—four times too much. £lO,OOO spent on surface works—
twice as much as required—-crushing plant beyond
capacity of the mine, chlorination works started but never
completed—altogether only another evidence of over-
capital, bad management, extravagance, exaggeration and
the fact that you cannot make a good big mine out of a
good little one.

It is inconsistent with all the public have been
told of the Mount Galena mine, N.S.W., to see a call of

lared threepenny calls.

Some years ago, in a Maoriland court, an exile
from County Donegal appeared and applied for a warrant
for the apprehension of a person who had “taken him
down ”in a raining swindle. “ What Was the name of the
mine, Mr. Dougharty ?” asked the clerk.
“Dunno!” said Moichal. “Where was it situated?”
“Dunno.” “ Well, 1 cannot issue a warrant unless you
can give me some particulars. Cannot you tell me any-
thing?” “Oi kin tell ye the colour aV it.” “ The colour
of it 1” said the astonished functionary. “ Yis, the colour
av it. It wuz a purty pink piece av ground with a nate
grane bovther round it, an’ wid something like hairy
caterpillars crawlin’ on it, begorra.” Poor Mike had seen
the plan.

In re the N.S.W. mining decision declares the
law to be that no N.S.W. registered mining co. can mine
in another province. Considering the number of mining

mines, the latter province is getting its watermelon tapped
at both ends.

world’s supply,

A story from Broken Hill— probably apocryphal:
The underground boss of the “graveyard shift,” i.e., that
working from midnight to eight a.m., was much worried
by the men in out-of-the-way corners of the mine sleeping
instead of working. One night he caught two of them
snoring placidly, and after covering them plentifully with
candle-grease, kicked them into a state of wakefulness and
sent them home. Next day one of the delinquents depu-
tationised the general manager. “Well, what’s the
matter, my man,” he was asked. “It was a fair catch
last night, boss, and I suppose it means (he sack !
“ What do you mean, Andy,” said the manager to whom
the occurence had not been reported. “Oh,” replied
Andv, “shift-boss caught me asleep, right enough, hut
twarnt my fault; it was Jimmy’s turn to watch for the
boss coming, and danged if he didn’t go to sleep, toe.”

When bound to the stake, the nigger burnt
alive the other day in Arkansas said, just ere the
woman appointed to do the deed applied the
match to bis kerosened clothing: “Stand back,
gentlemen, and let the ladies see.”
About ten more “Anarchist outrages ” by
means of dynamite and otherwise have been
cabled from Europe since last week, and
yet nobody lias been killed. Also a dozen
more alleged “bombs” have been discovered
by the police before they had time to blow
up. There is a very large moral just here.
The police, in three cases out of four, find the
Anarchists’ bomb before it explodes—in other
words, either the police put the bomb there them-
selves, and therefore knew where to find it,
or the “Anarchist” who put it there was a
hired spy who at once gave information, or there
isn’t any bomb at all, or else, when an object
about the size of a saucer is placed at random any-
where in a city of, perhaps, 800,000 population, the
police are so superhumanly intelligent that, in 75
percent, of the cases, they get on its track and
run it down in the three minutes or so which inter-
venes between the lighting of the slow fuse and: the
explosion. Now, there is absolutely nothing more
to guide the police to the location of a bomb than
to that of a dishcloth. Let anybody plant 20 dish-
cloths at random about London or Paris, and
count how many of them the police find within
three minutes, and if they don’t discover at least
ten, then the Anarchist cablegrams are so many
self-evident lies.

Who wrote the burlesque petition, on
Deeming’s behalf, to the Executive Council i It
is signed “Marshall Lyle,” but reads like Deakin
in mufti. Worthy of the old masters in humour
is the argument that the prayer of Hodges—“ May
the Lord have mercy on your soul! ’—means that
his Honour desires to meet Deeming in heaven,
and that therefore more time should be allowed to
prepare such soul for eternity. Without the
I streaks of sarcasm, the petition might have proved
effective. The lawyers want editing.

I send yon a photograph

on their first birthday, Novem-
ber nth. From birth they have
been fed entirely on your Malted
Food, and from being poor, frail
little mortals, whose lives were
despaired of, they have thriven
and become quite chubby and
jolly little specimens of baby-
hood. Moreover, so far, they
have been entirely free from
illness of any sort. I ought to
say your food was recommended
us by ourfamily doctor. Kindly
post us the photographs back at
your convenience.
Yours very faithfully,

When a mantle of murkiness lay
a S^ lu lon k of the crimson destroyer—
And none knew the name of her sire,
But the woman, and she, ashen gray.
In the fierce pangs of motherhood lay.
The skies were aflame at her coming
With a marvellous message of ill,
And fear-stricken pinions were drumming

Ofjnsectsrose, sudden and shrill,
As they fled from that hell-begirt hill.
the smoke-serpent writhed in her tresses,
Ihe flame kissed her hard on the lips,
ohe smiled at their ardent caresses—
As the wanton who smiles, but represses
A lover’s hot haste, and so slips
t rom the arm that would girdle her hips.
Such the time of her coming and fashion;
How long ere her day shall bo sped,
And she goes to rekindle past passion
With langourous glances that flash on
The long-straightened limbs of the dead,
Where they lie in a winter-wet bed ?
Where the wide waves of evergreen carry
The song—sad and soft—of the surge
To feathered battalions that harry
The wizen-armed bloodwoods that tarry
lor ever, chained down on the verge
Of a river that mutters a dirge.
’Tis a dirge for the dead men it mutters,
Those weed-entwined strangers, who lie
With the drift, in the whirlpools and gutters—
Swol’n hand or a garment that flutters
Wan shreds as the waters rush by,
And the flotsam, froth-freckled, rides high.
Is it there that she buries her lovers,
i This woman in scarlet and black ?
Those swart Caballeros, the drovers,
What sov’reignty set they above hers,
Riding in by a drought-beset track
To a fate which is worse than the rack.
A queen, no insignia she weareth,
Save the lustrous crown of her-hair,
Her beauty, the sceptre she beareth ;
For men and their miseries careth
As little as tigresses care
For the quivering flesh that they tear.
She is sweet as white peppermint flowers,
And harsh as red gum when it drips
From the heart of a hardwood that towers
Straight up, she hath marvellous powers
To draw a man’s soul through his lips
With a kiss like the stinging of whips.
Warm nights, weighted down with wild laughter
When sex is unsexed and uncouth,
Is the chorus that climbs to the rafter,
No thought of the days to come after—
She has little regret and less ruth,
As she tempts men to murder their youth.
Is she marked down as yet by the flaming
Great eye of the Righter of Wrong?
How long ere the Dreaded One, claiming
His due, shall make end of our shaming?
“How long, Mighty Father, how long?”
Is our wearisome burden of song.

The immediate expenses of the Deeming
trial—no small amount, by the way—are borne by
the prisoner’s attorney.

A Sydney (N.S.W.) newspaper the other

It is locally considered probable that the

It is persistently asserted that, whatever

Napoleon was one day searching for a book

A young Melbourne solicitor sat discon-
solately in his top-flat, sky-palace, Melbourne
office, last week. There was a tap at the door,
and in walked a well-dressed lady with a little
boy. He bowed her to a seat and waited to hear
her case. She didn't seem in a hurry, but started
to talk weather, Deeming, and so on. Then she
narrated her whole family history, while the boy
climbed all over the office furniture, and spilt the
ink. At last she said she really must go, and
asked “Alfio” to “come off the table”—which
“Alfie” did, breaking a pair of vases in his
descent. The attorney smiled faintly, and said it
didn’t matter, and seeing her about to depart,
enquired what business she had come to see him
upon. She seemed tremendously surprised but
went on to explain : “Alfie, you see, was never in
a lift before, so I brought him up to this floor, and
as I was rather tired, I thought you wouldn’t
object to letting me rest for a while. Besides,
Skinnem & Grinder, down below, are my
solicitors.” That was all.

When you are suffering from indigestion no good
can result from taking tonics or stimulants, wliich
create a false appetite and conduce to an overload-
ing of the stomach at a time when the digestive
organs are incapable of performing their proper
functions. If a stimulant is fancied the desire can
be effectually, but only temporarily, satisfied by
taking a teaspoonful of brandy diluted with water,
but if a permanent cure for indigestion is desired
take Boot's Indigestion Cure, which is not a “cure
all claim big to be a specific for every epidemic
that arises—but is an absolute cure for Indigestion
only.

Bishop Barlow, of Queensland, made a
progress up North recently, and the faithful got
up deputations and read addresses to him at every
port lie came to. At one place, however, the
steamer anchored five miles off shore, late one
cold, damp night, and the principal lights of the
church, who had been shivering on the muddy
shore for two hours with the address, hired a
lighter and went off to meet her. They expected
to find the bishop waiting on deck for them, so
that they could gabble over the document and go
back home again ; but when they reached the ship
he was in bed, and there was no steward aboard
who could point out his cabin, and the deputation
had to wait on deck till morning. There was a
drizzling rain that night, and the deck was cold
and hard, and the lighterman’s bill kept mounting
up every hour as he waited, but still the deputa-
tion stood its ground all through the small Hours
of the morning with grim resolution. Then at
five o’clock they learned that the steamer was
about to proceed on its way, so they burst into
the bishop’s cabin, and read their address to
him in bed, and ho answered, with one eye shut
and the other sleepily half closed, that it was the
happiest moment of his life, and thereupon the
whistle blew, and the deputation escaped over the
side into their lighter again and got home, and
the prelate fell asleep once more, and the ceremony
was over.
Last week Mary Ann Elizabeth Ryckman,
of Melbourne, being aggravated by the fact that
her small boy bad had a disagreement with the
small boy of Mrs. Chatfield, who lived in the
same street, threw dynamite into that lady’s house
and nearly blew the legs off Mr. Chatfield, who
was removed in a horribly mangled state to the
hospital. Then, just as the police were coming to
arrest her, she exploded another cartridge in her
own premises, blew her hand off and most of her
hair and features, reduced half her cottage
to ruins, covered the constable with bricks and
debris, and was finally picked out of the
wreckage, half-dead and apparently crazy, and
carried away on an ambulance. If Mrs. Mary
Ann Elizabeth Ryckman had been located in
Europe she would have been cabled out as another
fearful outrage by anarchists, accompanied by
numerous arrests, but, being near at hand, she
proves to be only an aggravated woman who got
unduly excited about a row between two
small boys. Distance lends enchantment to
the anarchist as well as to many other things.
As Sirs. Chatfield was absent from home when
the blast went off her enemy’s scheme partially
missed fire, but still Mrs. Ryckman has met with
a certain measure of suosess. Sir. Chatfield,
judging by present appearances, will be afflicted
with a wooden leg for the remainder of liis life,
and if Sirs. Ryckman doesn’t go hopelessly mad,
or die, or get penal servitude for life, she will bo
able, when she comes out of gaol, to lean over the
fence and shout “Peg-leg!” at her discomfited
victim. Site will have a wooden arm with a hook
at the end of it herself, but there is no ointment
without a fly in it somewhere, and the hook will
come in handy to hang on to the fence with.
Way back in the “Sixties” a Sydney
suburban R.G. church was in charge of a priest
whose name might have been Father John Si‘Nab
-—but it wasn’t. With him stayed a new-chum
nephew, Michael, who was waiting for something
to turn up, and meanwhile turned down more
spiritual comfort than was good for what he used
to term his “ locus shtand-eyc.” Ills uncle, know-
ing the strength of Slichael’s “ wakeness, ” kept
the strong waters under lock and key, and Sirs.
O’Dowd, the housekeeper, was warned never to
allow the keys into Michael's possession under
penalty of the purgatorial fires. One sweltering
hot day Michael, having spent his ’bus allowance
in the city on “cordials,” was compelled to “fut
it ” home, where he duly arrived with the thirst
of Tantalus upon him. Knowing that it was use-
less to plead for even a “ tainte ” from Mrs.
O’Dowd, he was about to draw on the pump
when a knock was heard at the front door,
on opening which Michael was met by a cleric
who introduced himself as Archdeacon M'En-
croe, and who was accordingly ushered into
the parlour with the most profuse ceremony.
Archdeacon M'Encroe was the Father Mathew of
Australia, and even surpassed the Irish reformer
in the vigour of his denunciations of the “accursed
drink.” Michael knew nothing of this, but,
clutching the golden opportunity, he rushed to
the housekeeper, told her the illustrious visitor
was “famishin’ for a dhrink,” and succeeded in
obtaining a big bottle of beer and another of prime
mountain dew. He had poured out a bumper of
beer for himself and one for his guest, when the
latter, thrusting his glass aside, said, “My young
friend, shun that stuff as you would the very devil
himself.” This was a bad set-back for Michael,
but he was now desperate, and so, raising his
beaker, he said, “ Oi’ll think about that, yer
rivirince, but as this is the first time Oi’ve had
the pleasure of seein’you, Oi raley musht dhrink
your very good health, sir.” He did, too, and
soon the Archdeacon left. An hour or two later
both bottles were empty, but Michael was as full
as the great tun of Heidelberg, and the house-
keeper, dreading the wrath to come, hustled him
off to bed and cleared away the wreck. Having a
presentiment that something was wrong, Father
John roused the slumbering hero up on his return,
and asked—“ Was there anyone here during my
Absence?” “ There was,” replied Michael, as he
sat up and endeavoured to pull himself together—
“ The Archdacun was here but he didn't shtop
long.” “ Indeed,” said the uncle, “I’m sorry I
was out, but I trust you did the honours of the
house during ray absence.” “Faith Oi did that
same,” returned Michael bravely. Father John
saw bow the battle had raged, and being a bit of
a wag he continued ; ‘ This is a matter which
touches me deeply, Michael. I do trust that you
showed the Archdeacon that he was in the hospit-
able house of an Irish gentleman.” “Lukhere,”
shouted the guileless nephew, who felt that he
had done the right thing, after all, “ I poured th’
dhrink into him until at lasht he pushed his glass
and said, ‘ Young man, don’t pressh me any more,
for if Oi dhrank another dhrop, begorra Oi’d
bnsht.’” “The Archdeacon said that, Michael,
did he ? ” “ Thitn was his very words.” “ I am
delighted to hear he was in such good form,”
returned Father John ; “ now lie down and finish
your sleep, and when you wake read this little
pamphlet of the Archdeacon’s and you will see
what a brilliant man he is.” At dinner next day
Father John carelessly remarked, “Clever man,
the Archdeacon, is he not ? ” But Michael, who
had mastered the pamphlet headed “Drink and
Damnation,” said he didn’t feel as well as a young
man should, and retired to kick himself in the
privacy of his own chamber.
Croup, whooping cough, sore throat, sudden
cold, and the lung troubles peculiar to children,
are easily controlled by promptly administering
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral. This remedy is safe to
take and certain in its action.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
When Walter Reeks, the yacht-designer, came
out to Sydney some years since he was “knocked of a heap”
when he saw the models of the Xavifa and Australian, the
yachts built a life-time ago by Dan Sheehy. Mr. Reeks
declared that Mr. Sheehy was 30 years before the old-
couritry builders, who would at the present day look upon
the Xarifa and Australian as perfection in model. The
old Australian is still in Port Jackson, and, properly
fitted out, could now knock lumps off anything of her
tonnage. It is an interesting fact that the keel of the
Australian is a part of the wrecked Dunbar.

Dear Bulletin, —You ask in your last issue,
“ What sort cf a sensation would a female aquatic cham-
pion make?” The question is quite unnecessary; there
never will be any such champion—at least, not unless she
gets her hair cut very short. The fatal point about the
sculling female is that she has to stop every quarter of a
mile to take her hair out of her mouth, and that unfor-
tunate delay spoils her chances every time. Even when
she does her hair up in a hard knot on top of her head it
invariably conies down in about five minutes, and then it
gets into her throat, and she tries vainly to Spit it out,
and while she is struggling with it her opponent gels hull
down on the horizon. —Yours, A - c., Titus Salt.

The totalisator is gradually killing the Adelaide
bookmakers. Whilst you couldn’t get more than 10 to 1
at the outside from the layers, the “tote” was panning
out dividends giving 50 per cent, better returns than the
books, offered. Had The Despised, which came third, won
Adelaide Cup, the dividend would have been £lOO. This
;s what will kill the ringmen.

Outsiders cannot quite fathom the desire of
Sydney Tattersall’s Club to dispense with the services of
Mr. Scarr as handicapper, and a numerously-signed peti-
tion is going the rounds asking for a reconsideration of
the matter. Mr. Scarr, an experienced gentleman whose
honour is unchallengeable, happens to he one of the very
few institutions in connection with Sydney racing in
which race-goers have any confidence at a time when the
“sport of kings ” fairly stinks in the nostrils of straight-
going men. A change just now will he ill-advised unless
good cause can be shown.

As already mentioned, the Queensland feather-

A certain bantam pugilist of renown is solemnly
warned to seize bichloride of gold by the forelock, for the
hiss of the serpent is at hand. Nearly every night, he
raises a satanic corrobhoree in some Sydney bar, and in
some cases the police are too much afraid of the “ push ” to
interfere. Moreover, when drunk he sings. He prowls

After all his fabulous winnings at Monte Carlo,
Mr. “Bonne Chance” Wells, of whom Australia has
heard so much in cablegrams, does not appear to be pos-
sessed of much cash, for he has been sued hy an English
lady to recover £5O, which he obtained from her osten-

Who would not be a prominent Melbourne foot-
baller? Secretary Marshall, of the V.F.A. says that the
powerful M.C.C. (which now runs the M.F.C.) has a large
number of prominent footballers (from other clubs) em-
ployed about its various grounds. They are popularly
supposed to keep the sparrows from eating the newly-
sown grass-seed. In the cricket-season they are employed
in the manly and active occupation of going round the
ground with a stick, to prevent small boys from climbing
over the fence. And yet these men would hit you with a
brick if you suggested" that they were professionals.

A N.Y. sport has been disqualified for attach-
ing a portable electric battery to his horse. This instru-
ment was fixed to the saddle, and the current was
conveyed through the spurs. Whenever these were
applied to the horse’s sides that horrified animal ran like
aprad possessed by the devil. When the owner didn’t
want to win he left the battery at home, and the amazing
difference in the record made by the electrified beast,
and the same beast when he wasn’t electrified, at last drew
attention, and led to an inquiry.

Touch a man’s pocket and you wound him in his

X he New York Wheel, the cyclists’organ, thus
discourses upon athletes generally;—“lt is written in
‘The Book’ that the man who relies for success on
physical effort or physical exploit is doomed to disinte-
gration, morally, mentally, socially ; yes, even financially,
though that is the least of it. There are exceptions, of
course. We shall ignore the exceptions, few and far
between, and point at the scores of cases that prove the
rule. We take examples from all classes, those who have
competed for glory and those who have competed as a
means of livelihood. First, recall to your mind all the
notable athletes, cycle racing-men, running-men, walkers,
runners, jumpers, &c., that 3 011 have ever known, and
judge them by the sreial laws of success. Take, tben, the
list of champion sprint-runners of the world, all the way
from Big Foot Johnson down to our modern Mercury,
Harry Hutchens. Take them all, amateurs andnrofis-
sionals, and mark what they are and where they are. Go,
then, to your record of lighting-men, from the earliest
dog-eat-dog days of the Nottingham Pet and Birmingham
Spider down to our Solid ans and Cardiffs, and mark what
and where they are. Study the University boat-lists, and
learn the lesson of our early decay, of middle-life ob-
scurity, of after-life senility. First, some English cyclists;
some pure amateurs, some makers’ amateurs, some
professionals. The two brightest particular stars of the
path both dead in foreign countries, two convicted cf
theft, one other noted amateur a physical wreck, another
a another thoroughly tricky and crooked and
a world-wanderer, three keepers of ‘pubs.,’ the Mecca of
so many champions, four others lost in the Coventry
factories, mere bench hands, two others slaves in the coal
mines. We fail to recall five men who have ever done
anything worth anything; not more than five men who
have ever grown into decent members of society. And
now, back across the water, to onr own people, both
amateurs and professionals:—Three dead, three turned
barkeepers, one convicted of murder and afterwards shot,
three retired from all exercise by medical instructors on
account of weak hearts, another dead in a foreign country,
five retired to the humblest sort of private life, three
noted national fakirs and hippodroming showmen. Could
we extend the list ? Well, rather. But we will haste to
repeat the lesson which we have tried to illustrate, notably,
that along the line of physical supremacy lies mediocrity ;
that in the trail of physical exertion, as a means of liveli-
hood, lies moral and social rottenness and general failure ;
that one may become a champion with credit and honour,
but that remaining a champion invites a peril. We want
to enforce this lesson upon ambitious amateurs who may
pay momentary attention to those writers who have the
entree to a dishonest and degraded press, and who are
prating learnedly of cash prizes and flying starts and other
sensations.” And isn’t all this true of” Australia?

authorities. This is a legitimate step in the duo
self-assertion of (1 renfell as the hub of the universe.
Its next move will be to instruct President Carnot
to guillotine the French Anarchist, Ravachol. It

Dear Bulletin,—The par in your last
issue re the sale of George Anson’s books, reminds
me of a little incident in book-auctioneering,
which took place in Sydney not 50 years ago. A
literary man was going “home” and his library
was advertised for sale, among the books being
about 2000 uncut volumes. All Sydney turned up
at the sale and the books brought fancy prices.
It afterwards leaked out that the bulk of the
volumes were the surplus stock of a leading book-
seller who made use of the opportunity to clear
out his cellars. The pathetic part of the business
was that several heavy purchasers sought the
bookseller’s advice at the sale as to buying and his
answer in every case was—“ The rarest lot of
books I’ve ever seen—buy ’em.” The bookseller
can’t well be blamed if the public were “ had,” as
a man with one eye could have seen through the
2000 uncut volumes part of the “ad.”—H.B.
Premier Shiels has arranged a treaty of
peace between Judge Hodges and ex-Attorney-
General Duffy, on the G. N. Taylor question.
Hodges will say no more in explanation, and
Duffy, having resigned his portfolio, is under-
stood to have lost all interest in the case, Taylor,
for his part, considers that further discussion is to
be deprecated. The Ministerial “ amen ” has been
received with “hear, hear,” by the directors of
the Land Credit Bank, and everybody seems
satisfied except the smaller shareholders and
depositors, who are too dead-broke to be worth
considering. As for the odd million or so of
Victorian public, they have now learned to think
of G. N. Taylor’s two years as a representative
joke, and would be sorry to have the humour of
the situation spoilt by another trial.
Let that case of G. N. Taylor’s
Fade away from view ;
Leave him joking with his gaolers
Whilst the weepers and the wallers
(Who are not a few)
Curse the bank completely busted,
Curse the man they once entrusted
With the gold for which he lusted,
Curse and groan and look disgusted—
What else can they do ?
Hundred thousand golden thick Tins
Vanished at a pop !
Though a two years’ sentence sickens
Those who wonder why the dickens
Taylor cannot swap
Places with the dupes that sadly
Roam at large, protesting madly
They would “ do his bit,” and gladly,
For the “ stuff ” they want so badly—
Let the matter drop.

For a Pick-me-up in the morning try a “ milk
punch” made at Walsh’s. New American Bar,
Sydney Theatre Royal Hotel.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
just the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
Almost!
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Well, that shed is cut out, and here I am, on the
toad again to look for another.
It wasn’t such a bad shed, after all. I took
fifteen pounds out of it —would have been twenty-
five only for my wrist caving in and throwing me
idle for a fortnight. It served methe same trick
when I was shearing on Bardeggie, three years
ago. However, there’s some of the season left yet,
and if I can drop in at Muldilla I’ll be right
enough.
Let’s see—what’s its name again ? Muldoon—
no—Muldilla. Ah ! that’s it. I always had a
poor memory for names.
Whew ! It is hot, and, by Jove, the water-bag
is getting light. I must stop this smoking; it
makes me too thirsty.
Only seven miles done out of twenty-seven, and
the water nearly all gone. The bag’s too small,
anyhow.
I shall have to make another one as soon as 1
can get a bigger piece of canvas. I daresay
there’ll be some at Muldilla.
A bit of a spell wouldn’t go bad now. This
swag is beginning to fit pretty tight on my
shoulder. _
Hum; I can’t sit in this flaming sun, and if Igo
into the shade of one of those trees, it’ll be swarm-
ing with ants ; any bit of shade always is.
Oh, here’s a log under this bush. I’ll camp on
it for a bit.
My word, it’s a relief to get rid of the swag; it’s
infernally heavy. I’ll lighten it to-morrow, if I
don’t get any shearing at the next place.
Well, I suppose I must push on again ; there’s a
good few miles yet to do.
I seem to be getting into fresh country; the
road’s getting rather rocky.
It’s a bit rough on the feet, after coming out of
a woolshed, which always makes ’em soft for out-
side work.
Hullo ! Where’s the road gone to now ! I can
hardly pick it out among these boulders.
There’s some wheel-tracks going this way. But
ithere, it doesn’t matter which I follow ; the road
■will show up again when I get through this stony
;ground. .
Confound it! I can’t see any sign of it at all
now. Never mind ;it must be out this way some-
where, so I’ll shove on and chance it.
Where the deuce can it have gone to ! This will
never do. I must have come a mile and a half
since the last track disappeared. I shall be
;getting into trouble if I don’t look out. I’ll try
back.
Let’s see. I fancy I came this way. No—l
never passed that big black rock, I’ll swear. The
road ought to be more to the right, I think.
It’s not this way—oh, of course not —it’s away
tto the left. What a thickhead lam !
Still no sign of it! It can’t be this way or I
should have fetched it before now.
Let me think a bit. Oh, it’s no use getting
frightened ; the road can’t be far away.
It ought to be down here, by the sun ; but
that’s not much of a guide for a job of this sort;
and it’s shifted a good bit while I’ve been
muddling about here. I’ll have a drink and drive
on down this way anyhow.
What, all the water gone? Then I must find
that road somehow, or else this heat will soon
ripen a rare old thirst for my benefit!
It’s no good—there’s no road this way and—by
God, I’m lost I
What am I to do now I I’ll lighten the swag
and try to strike a bee-line out of here. Now,
what shall I part with ? The stone can go ; I can
easily get-another when I’ve got some shears to
sharpen. The boots can go too, and I might as
well leave the mat. There, that makes it lighter ;
and now for another try to get somewhere.
I wish to heaven I had a drink !
Shall I never get out of this infernal bush?
There goes the sun down ; it’ll get a bit cooler
now.
My feet are blistering awfully—but I must push
on while there’s light.
It’s getting too dark to go on any farther to-
night—l shall have to camp down for an hour or
two.
How horrible the thirst is getting, and its
going to be a roasting hot night.
Ah, well, I’ll try and get a little sleep, and per-
haps in the morning
Heigh ho ! what a dreadful dream ! How real
it seemed ! Why* the pangs of Ah, by God,
it’s no dream, it is a reality ! lam lost!
Unless I get water soon 1 shall be in trouble.
No—l won’t take the swag ; quite enough to do
to take myself, for I must make a big try to reach
some place where I can get a drink before things
get too bad.
I’ve heard that it is a good thing to put a stone
in the mouth. I’ll try it.
It is an improvement, I believe. And now,
here’s off.
That sun’s flaming hot again ! It must be
getting on for midday. I wonder how much
longer this muddle’s going to last?
Ah ! what’s this ? A break in the bush.
Hurrah ! the open country at last —and yes—
by Jove! —there’s water—l can see it quite plain
what a fine big sheet of it, and how it glitters
in the sun ! .
Whew ! It’s —no—good—trying to run to it—it
is farther off than I thought. And yet—it can’t
be so far either, for I can plainly hear it rippling.
How my head reels! Never felt like this
before.
It’s queer—l don’t seem to get any closer to
that water ! It’s always shifting away from me—
and there goes the sun down !
Well, dark or light, I must push on, I know
where the water lies and if I follow.it, I am bound
to strike it some time.
Hullo ! a fall—l must be more cautious in this
darkness or I’ll come to grief.
What’s that ? Some one on that knob. Hey !
Oh, it’s only a kangaroo. Things are very
deceiving at night time.
It’s an awfully close night! It’ll be a stinger
when the sun gets up.
Hush ! Is that a crow ? If it is I must be near
water. Pish ! What am I talking about ?—crows
don’t sing out at night. It’s some night bird I
expect.
Down again ! My head caught it that time.
How’s this ? Wet! Why—oh, I must have cut
myself.
I ought to soon reach water now. I’ve come a
long way during the night.
There’s daylight again. I’ll be able to get on
better now.
Lord, how my head aches, and how redevery-
thing seems! I can’t see any water now, either !
I expect I turned away from it in the darkness.
Never mind, I must come to some place soon.
Something out there looks like the mullock out
of a tank. I hope to God it is !
Only a sandridge I Christ 1 shall I never find
water ?
How that sun is biting agaiil t I’ll take off my
waistcoat and hahg it up in this tree. I can find
it again when I want it. ;
My word ! Look at those fountains ! How
they sparkle ! ! I’m right at last.
I can’t make this out —they’re all gone again !
But what’s this? Can it be—ah, it’s only
another of those sandridges.
. Listen. How long have I been lost ? No —it
can’t be more than a week, because it’s only been
dark
I must get back home next week. Jenny will
give me all the water
Water ! Why, here’s plenty of water —look at
it all round ! I’ll strip and then I can plunge in.
I can beat-all the boys at swimming !
The teacher says if he were — When Muldilla’s
cut out, I’ll make in for the river. Why, here’s
the river ! It’s queer I can’t reach it! If Jenny
were only ,
I wonder what makes my head burn so! There s
something through the scrub yonder. Another of
those sandridges, I expect. No, I won’t go over
to it, anyhow. I’ll push on to

A.D. 1950.
And thus Australia —while about her feet her sons,
Furrow-brow’d and sad, crouched listening,
Her voice, where love with anger fought, shivered
To the mountain tops, and curious stars came out
To see men take their dose of Truth.
“ You ask, my sons, why life is sad and why
Old age with giant’s pace o’ertakes
Mid-way ’twixt birth and death ;
Why greed stalks rampant through the land,
Spoiling youth ; and laughter, satire-soaked,
Comes from the birds alone.
Listen ! yonder in the distant days while Fate
Went kissing Northern lands, I lay
And nursed my barrenness, storing
Little hoards of gold away, as old maid will,
Pining for child —ever to the Southern breeze I said :
“ I’ll wait, I’ll wait, men must come, and I,
Welcoming, will laugh in harvest —for God is good.
They came—your sires, and saw, not my flowers.
Nor the rich breasts of me—bursting to feed,
But ripped my robe, and through all chastity.
Made for an old maid’s savings.
One night, while busy sleep men rocked
In the rigor of their dreams, the southern wind,
My old-time friend, crept back, and I—
“ What name give they this mate of mine ?” .
And he, whispering low, “They call him ‘avetice, his lote'
Begets his like—thy little store misspent,
They, greed-impelled, shall on each other feed.
I have no tears for you, nor further word than this,
Had I with effort mated and bred our brawny sons
Owning stocks, nor shares, nor wanting them,
This fair earth had known no land so fair.
But now, farewell —go burrow on as vermin will.
And when the gold is gone come back to me,
Repentance-led, and 1 have golden corn for you,
Laughing vines, and sweet forgiveness.

Still there are exceptions. When a certain Aus-

line at flunkeys, so he was “sacked” instanter.
Years ago, too, there was that heroic member of

sundry little stage mannerisms which this profane-
wight used to mimic behind the scenes. Dondi 1
caught him at it and kicked him in the back-
blocks, whereupon the valiant supe went for him>
like a whirlwind. There was a general kick-up.

locks, but when it was all over Dondi, like the’
trump he was, took all the blame, and this paladin 1
of supers, wasn’t dismissed after all.

The Eight-Mile Tragedy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Eight-Mile” was one of the finest sheets
of water on the run on the river for that matter,
for it was one of the dry, inland rivers in Western
Queensland wherein the water-holes are few and
far between. It was a warm part of the world,
and in summer the broad plains through which
the many-channelled stream wound its way were
full of gaping holes and cracks, and the hot winds
came across them like blasts from a stoke-hole.
The Eight-Mile was a favourite camping-place,
and, induced by this consideration, an individual
proceeded to erect a rough accommodation house
there. He was a pallid, unhealthy-looking man,
whose pasty face contrasted strangely with the
sun-blackened complexions of the station men.
and he had an unhealthy-looking* wife and was-
accompanied by an equally unhealthy-looking
rouseabout, who assisted in the erection of the
accommodation house
ihe prejudice of the district was decidedly
against new-comers; as one of the men
‘they looked too much like so many
kopsuses, but as they all proved quiet, kept a
decent table, and were not much suspected of
either sly-grog selling or horse-stealing, they rose
in public estimation, and when Butler (for
that \\ as the man s name) enlarged his habitation
and applied for a publican’s license, it was granted
without much trouble. Naturally things altered
somewhat, limothy J. Butler was rather more
self-assertive when lording it behind the bar,
and the rouseabout, promoted to be barman sud-
denly developed a sporting, horsey vein hitherto
unsuspected. Still Timothy B. retained his credit.
No outrageous cases of Ihocussmg or lambing-down
were ever reported, and as he now kept a Chinese
cook and gardener and spared no pains to
provide good meals, his place was well patronised
and prosperity appeared to loom ahead.
Mrs. Butler, however, was still a woman of
mystery. limothy and the promoted barman
grew browner in face and more genial in their
manner, but she still remained pale, silent and
reserved. If addressed she answered in the
fewest possible words, and took the first oppor-
tunity of leav mg the room.
One afternoon there was a goodly number of
people assembled at Tim.’s, as the place was now
known. Three teams Were camped at the water-
hole, some of the men from the neighbouring-
station were down, and a traveller or two were
staying there. A few of the boys were playing;
quoits with horse-shoes, some were pitching com-
petition yarns, and the balance talking horse with
the barman. At this juncture a stranger rode up
to the place. He was a big-boned, black-bearded
man with enormous feet and hands. He was;
riding a miserably poor, knocked-up horse which
fairly staggered when his rider dismounted, with
some difficulty extricating his large feet from the
stirrups.
Mrs. Butler was just coming into the verandah
when the new-comer alighted, but at sight of him
she beat a hasty retreat. “ Good day to yez all,” 1
said the stranger in a rich brogue, as he
glanced around, and then, as Butler appeared, he
gave a shout, and exclaimed: “And ’tis yerself,
Tim, ould man, after all, then !” ‘
Tim, however, did not appear to reciprocate the
effusive greeting of his friend, but he treated him
eivilly, sent the black boy to hobble the wretched!
horse out on the nearest bit of feed, and asked his;
guest in. The stranger drew one of his hug©
hands across his mouth and followed with
alacrity. Public opinion in the verandah decided
that he was an ex-policeman and a new-chum in
the bush.
In the course of the afternoon Tim mentioned
the stranger as his brother-in-law, John Dwyer,
It was noticeable that he spoke of him as John,
not the more familiar Jack, although Dwyer
affectionately dubbed him Tim at every oppor-
tunity. Mrs. Butler did not appear as usual to
dispense the tea from the big tin teapot at the
evening meal, and the only person who seemed
elated at the visit was Dwyer himself. He was
hi high good-humour, “shouted” for everybody
wll ° would drink with him, as though the place
belonged to him ; and, after an uproarious carouse,
fell asleep with his head under the table and his
legs dangling over a form.
From that time forth Tim’s was an altered
place. Dwyer, who appeared to be in his proper
element, lolled behind the bar from morning till
night, and his broad fingers were continually
clutching a whisky-bottle. Trade fell off,
for his assertive ways disgusted everybody,
liigh and low, master and man, and much
wonder was expressed that Butler stood it. There
came an end, however, to his patience. It was
soon rumoured that Butler wanted to sell out, and
as the district had increased in importance during
his sojourn in it, he was not long without a suit-
able offer. He accepted it, and it was soon known
that Mr. Dwyer had departed without beat of
drum. Shortly afterwards the Butlers and their
faithful henchman left, and the new people
entered into possession.
Three months had elapsed since Tim’s-by
w hieh name it was, and probably is still, known-
;had changed hands, and three or four teams had
turned out at the Eight-Mile to camp. It was
only about 2 0 - clock) and the black boy, bucket and
billy in hand, went down to the water-hole to
bring up water. The men who were unyoking
were suddenly startled by flying footsteps? and a
scared nigger rushed into their midst with the
astounding assertion that an alligator was in the
water-hole.
Big Bob elevated his tall, sinewy frame, six
foot four in his bare feet, and accompanied by his
mates strode down the track. On the surface of
the water floated a remarkable-looking object.
The men gazed in silence for some time,
“If it was possible,” said Big Bob at last, “I
should say those were Dwyer’s feet.” He flicked
his bullock whip at it, but it fell short. “Lend
us a lash,” he said.
One of the men unbent his whip from the
keeper and handed it to him. He fastened it on
to his own, made a noose at the end, and with one
skilful east sent it over the strange object and
towed it ashore.
• It was Dwyer’s feet, and there was a body
attached to it. A horrible body, so bloated in
places, so shrunken in others, so mutilated by fish,
so unlike anything human, and yet still bearing a
horrid likeness of humanity about it, that some of
the men retired,
With the aid of another whip, Big Bob and two
or three others got the thing on to the bank. A
bag full of stones had been tied to it, but the fas-
tenings had parted and the corpse had come to the
surface.
“ We camped here a fortnight ago,” said Big
Bob, looking at the others,
“ Yes,” was the reply. They were on the up-
trip then, now they were returning empty,
“ And,” said Bob, solemnly, “ we made our tea
and our bread of this water, and boiled our beef
in it. By , if ever I catch Butler, I’ll —I’ll—
Words failed him here.
Everybody put it down to Butlerbut no trace
of him could be discovered. No marks of violence
were found on the body ; Dwyer’s hands and feet
had been tied together, probably when he was in a
drunken stupor, and so he had been chucked into
the waterhole.
“ I’ll never forgive himsaid Big Bob.
“ Why the devil didn’t he bury him ?”
“Too many niggers about,” replied his mate.
“Bound to have tracked him up out of sheer
curiosity.” Which was true, as a camp of blacks
had established themselves near the place.
There were some startling telegrams in the
metropolitan papers, and a verdict of wilful
murder against Timothy Butler ; but that was all.
I was jackerooing on the next station, at the
time, and ten years afterwards accidentally heard
the “ rights ” of Dwyer’s fate.
It came about in this way. I was in Sydney
walking down George-streot; at that time the
totalisators were in full and open swing, and one
fellow who was standing in the street taking a
customer’s name, was knocked down by a cab. I
recognised his white face as they lifted him up ; it
was Butler’s barman. I called at the hospital next
morning and found that he had been badly injured
and could not possibly live. He recognised mo,
and presently told me about Dwyer.
Butler and he, it seems, had been mixed up in a
swindling racing transaction, which, connected as
it was with the suspicious death of a man, made a
great stir at the time.
Butler and the ex-barman got eight years over
it. Mrs. Butler had secreted most of the money,
and, by bribing Dwyer, then a warder, the two
escapee}. They made out back to the most
uncivilised part they could find, and were doing
well by honest means when Dwyer, who had lost
his billet, tracked them down and established
himself at free quarters. He was ruining the
business and Butler, despairing of ever getting
free from his incubus, got rid of him in the way
mentioned. The Butlers, it seems, had since gone
to America, and their accomplice died a few days
after he told me the story.

Archie Brown, the brother and successor
to that John whose body lies a-mouldering under a
huge monument, is the present autocrat of the
Queen’s whisky-bottle. Every night, on the stroke
of half-past ten, poor dear John’s brother bursts
upon the royal scene bearing a decanter of whusky,
a water-bottle, and a tumbler upon a silver
charger, and administers a certain fixed dose to
Her Majesty. She always says, with an air of
monarchial surprise— “ What! is it really time for
me to take my whisky, Brown?” and Archie in-
variably replies, “What are you giving us, Your
Majesty ” (or words to that effect), and the
Crowned Head takes the mixture as before.
Archie Brown plays the same “ sturdy independ-
ence ” game-as John used to play, and regulates
his Sovereign Lady’s refreshments without seem-
ing to consider whether there arc any kings
present.

AN INNOVATION.
A SAC SUIT from £1 10s. Write for Patterns and
System of Measurement. J. S. MANWARlNG, Brisbane.
The new Governor of Maorflancl has
requested that all the drains at Goverfunenx
House, Wellington, be repaired and the p] aer ,
disinfected as much as possible,before his arrival
Evidently he has heard evil reports' about the
malarious city, and is coining out with fear and
trembling. Still he ought to like the place when
he gets there, especially on Sunday, for-barring
Dunedin—Wellington looks more horribly Scotch
on the day of rest than any other locality we ever
visited. The present writer first struck it on a
Sunday, and the experience will 'never, never be
forgotten. It was two o’clock on a sodden after
noon when he banged at the door of a hotel, and
was let in under protest by a man whose religion
seemed to have flown to his head. After securing a
bedroom he was turned adrift in a big, hare
parlour, and left there to amuse himself till
tea-time. The shutters were up, but there were
holes in the tops of them which admitted a faint
yellow glimmer like a corpse-light. There was no
one else in sight, in fact there appeared to ho no
one else in the house. He asked for a paper, and
got half a one—the half with the advertisements
in it. Then he roamed wretchedly around the
big, brown, desolate apartment in search of books
and found a volume upon Napoleon’s retreat from
Moscow. He studied that .subject for four solid
hours till a haggard girl came, and in a sepulchral
voice said, “Tea!” At the tea-table there
were six people sitting straight up in grim,
silence, like the spectres of six dead, wet
Sabbaths. They wolfed the provender hurriedly
and retired apparently to bed. Then the
writer went back to the empty parlour, and
read the x’etreat from Moscow straight ahead till
11 p.m. At that hour the haggard girl put her
head in at the door and asked if he wanted any-
thing more that night. He said he did—he wanted!
a bottle of poison, two razors, a pistol, a liang-
maii’s rope, and the loan of a cemetery.- The
haggard girl fled in horror on hearing this, and he>
gathered up the book and went upstairs, and
crawled wretchedly into bed. Being unable to
sleep he lay there and listened to the rain, and
read the retreat from Moscow till four a.tn., where
the candle flickered out, after which he lay in
the dark and thought over the retreat from;
Moscow. About five he went to sleep, and!
dreamt that he had discovered an entirely new
way of running a newspaper so that there were no>
expenses, and all the takings were clear profit. If
Lord Glasgow only strikes Wellington on a good,,
old, damp, solemn Sabbath, he will baa contented!
Scotchman and the happiest Presbyterian goinm
An average Presbyterian’s idea of happiness con-
sists in reading the Shorter Catechism in a ceme-
tery, and Wellington is nearly all cemetery or
thereabouts.

blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let

A Chinaman was found dead, a month or
two ago, in a lonesome part of West Australia,
ifnd as he looked as if he had been pounded to
death with steam hammers; it was set down as a
case of murder. So three other Chinamen were
arrested, the policeman, as he ran them into the
“logs,’’ warning them as usual that any state ;

As they didn’t knoW a Word df English; afad thd

this wilrning was rather misplaced; perhaps, but it
didn’t uiatter. There were only two lawyers for
feoriie hundreds of miles around, so One of them
got a commission as acting - judge, and the
other was appointed Crown - prosecutor, and
there was no lawyer left for the unhappy
Chows. However, the Court hunted up
ah interpreter who was ordered to explain to the
prisoners “ the nature of the accusation,” but it
presently transpired that the interpreter knew no
English himself, and hadn’t the faintest idea what
the nature of the accusation was, and consequently
couldn’t explain it, so the court decided to go
ahead without him. The prisoners were asked, in
English, how they would plead, and as they
remarked “Chow-wow,” or words to that effect,
it was resolved to set them down as pleading
“not guilty,” The Crown prosecutor opened the
case, and called his witnesses, and the prisoners,
being asked, also in English, if they wished to
cross-examine, again answered sadly “ Chow-
wow.” Then the Crown prosecutor delivered his
address to the jury, and the prisoners were
invited —in English—to open the case for the
defence. Sadly, stolidly, and unmeaningly they
responded “ Chow-wow.” Whereupon the jury
brought in a verdict of “Guilty” without the
slightest hesitation, and the acting-judge asked—
in English, as already mentioned—whether they
could show any cause why sentence of death
should not be passed upon them, and they all
three rose up with one accord and made this brief,
memorable statement, “Chow-wow!” After
that the judge sentenced them in due form, and
the Executive, a week or two later, confirmed the
sentence, and the three Mongols will m, hung in
the ordinary course.

Despite the learned opinion of Sydney
Evening News to the contrary, the abbreviation
“ Mons.” is quite allowable, and, in the interests
of comprehensibility, is preferably allowable in a
programme printed jil English. In French docu-
ments where the full hame of the person denoted
•is usually spelt right out after the prefix denoting
“Monsieur,” the abbreviation “M.”— the equiva-
lent of the English “Mr.” —is all right enough ;
but, with the English vogue of initialling name's,
the “M.” would often be misunderstood to repre-
sent a Christian name, such as Michael, Matthew,
Mark, Melchisedeck, Moses, Marius, and others.

The public eye rejects as uninteresting mon
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day, It is only the remainder that is found
in Thu BULLETIN,
The Bulletin is an aggressive Bemomtio
papet tvhich strives to exclude from its artist p
oally-boilciensed CbllrmilS all matter which is not
of general human interest, The Bulletin was
started eleven feats ago with flo capital but brains,
ar-d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have nnavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more Or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its_ lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparin'*
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands bf pounds in fitting their buildings
with thfe latest appliances i(Jt high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed With hew type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, arid , aidotried With
sketches ftom the bands of the ablest arid best-
paid rlewspaper artists Australia has rivrit serin.-
The Bulletin is the only well-established .Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
THE Bulletin Is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land. Wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity,
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, Tint
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Ear North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the bnghtjs
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and mos,
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
