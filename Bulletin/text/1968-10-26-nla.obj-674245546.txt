If you have a worn old roof you probably
don't dare think about it. Until there’s
a storm in the middle of the night. Then
you worry. But someone’s found the
answer to your problem, with the most
versatile of all metals, Alcoa aluminium.
It’s a good looking, neat fitting roofing
tile, called Permatile, made by Hunter
Douglas Ltd.,* from Alcoa aluminium.
Permatile roofs come in four smart
colours. Attractive, resistant to corrosion
and damage, the tiles fit neatly over the
top of your old roof.
This system avoids the mess normally
associated with roof replacement.
Because they're made from Alcoa
aluminium these tiles won't crack, chip
or rust. This roof is only one tenth the
weight of a conventional tile roof and
reflects heat your house will be cooler
in summer, warmer in winter.
Maybe you're not re-roofing your home.
But you should ask about the advantages
of aluminium in any building products
you plan to use, or manufacture.
Call your nearest Alcoa Regional Sales
Office for the facts to get on top of your
building problem.

SEM-ANTICS
LAST WEEK produced one example
of how it is sometimes unwise to take
people at their word. Two Melbourne
girls who stripped to the waist to
serve customers with Courage beer
were charged with indecent behaviour.
PEACE
IT WAS fascinating to read of all the
human interest stories at the Olympic
Games, particularly the line that Presi-
dent Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico
read his message of peace and good-
will from a bullet-proof glass box.
NATIONAL CAPITAL
LAST WEEK when every main paper
in Australia had as its lead story that
there would be no Federal election this
year; “The Canberra Times’ ” head-
ing was “Big Rise In City Land Value”
above a lead story that the Common-
wealth had placed a valuation of
$400,000 on a site being used for a
service station, workshop, and new car
showrooms in Mort Street, Braddon.
BREAKAWAY
AFTER last week’s Western Australian
earthquake The Bulletin received a
telegram from an anonymous Western
Australian. It read: “To The Bulletin
and all you Eastern Staters — it seems
we are going to secede despite John
Gorton’s good work over the past few
weeks.” If The Bulletin is the seventh
State, perhaps the Prime Minister is
the eighth.
A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY
IN THE MIDDLE of the gaiety of
Export Week we were telephoned by
Mr. Harry M. Miller. “I am about
to make a significant contribution to
the export drive,” he said in that silky,
understated way which has come to
signify that Harry is at it again. We
heard the sounds of our disbelief
echoing around his office. Mr. Miller
uses a loudspeaker device which broad-
casts one’s conversation to his entire
suite. It can be quite unnerving.
“Listen, come down and let me tell
you about it,” he said. “This will really
knock you out.”
It only stunned us. Mr. Miller has
embarked on a plan to sell square-inch
pieces of Australia at $2 a time. Within
20 years he expects to have cut up
half an acre of Blue Mountains land
into three million square-inch “estates”
and sold them all over the world. Mr.
Miller having sold just about every-
thing else in sight it was inevitable that
he would come eventually to the literal
business of selling Australia, but even
so the project seemed wildly
improbable.
“I can assure you that it is com-
pletely and properly legal. We have
been negotiating this through Govern-
ment departments since April and now
have complete backing and approval.”
Usually when Mr. Miller talks of “we”
he means “I” but in this case he means
Australian Goodwill Lands Pty. Ltd.,
which is a company he shares with
Messrs. Fred Gibian and Ivan
Griffiths, two fellow New Zealanders.
Gibian and Griffiths conduct a similar
company in New Zealand through
which they have been selling square-
inch pieces of Rotorua for the last two
years. Their clients have included
Lyndon Baines Johnson, the Shah of
Persia, and the Mayor of Vancouver.
In January they joined with Miller in
the Australian company.
With the co-operation of the Blue
Mountains City Council they bought
Proof of ownership of one square-inch
of Australia
half an acre of land on the edge of the
escarpment overlooking Megalong
Valley at Katoomba and began copy-
righting and legalising their scheme. To
the suspicious mind it all seems alarm-
ingly doubtful, but after reading the
collection of literature which comes
with the impressive-looking certificate
to the land it is apparent that it is no
more than a harmless piece of
gimmickry.
“We are hoping it will take the
place of toy koalas as a souvenir of
Australia,” says Mr. Miller. “I don’t
know about you but every time I go
overseas I have to take about three
dozen stuffed koalas to give away
as gifts. It is a nuisance carrying all
those boxes around with me and when
I go through Customs I feel a bit
ridiculous having to declare three dozen
koalas. Now I’ll just put a bundle of
land certificates in my brief case; much
better.” We have never suffered Mr.
Miller’s agonies of jet-setting but we
got his point.
And so, apparently, has the N.S.W.
Chief Secretary, Mr. Eric Willis, who
will also take a bundle of certificates
with him when he goes overseas next
time. A few thousand already have been
sent to the Dallas department store
Nieman-Marcus for sale, presumably, to
the millionaires who have everything
else except a square-inch of Australia.
But what if an extravagance of mil-
lionaires decided to pool their square-
inches to make one half-acre and bruise
the Blue Mountains with Texan-style
architecture? “Impossible,” says Mr.
Miller. “The land cannot be built on.
It will be landscaped as a Goodwill
Park and that is what it will remain.
We hope landowners will visit their
estates and be photographed on them;
eventually we hope to provide for
plaques which will list the landowners.
But there is no possibility of the land
being used for wrongful purposes.”
As we left, Mr. Miller presented The
Bulletin with a certificate to a square-
inch of the Blue Mountains. We are
now exploring the possibilities of sub-
division. We’ve always wanted a tele-
phone with a loudspeaker device.
COOL RECEPTION
THERE IS considerable controversy
in Hobart at present over the proposal
to establish a casino at Wrest Point,
the city’s most noted hotel. One recent
visitor there reported to us his grave
doubts that Hobart was ready for it.
He made a short stay at the hotel
this winter. He was surprised to find
that his wing of the hotel was not
centrally heated, and somewhat annoyed
when, after a fellow-guest who had been
trying to dry his underwear in front
of a radiator managed to set fire to his
room, they were all called out into the
grim chill of a Hobart winter night by a
fire alarm. This standard of comfort,
he feels, will hardly attract the inter-
national jet set, which the supporters
of the casino project hope to get, and
probably not even the organised crime
syndicates that the opponents of the
casino fear will come in its wake.
ONLY HALF THE BATTLE
TWO MONTHS ago it looked as if
Paddington had won its battle with the
N.S.W. State Planning Authority. When
several major roads, involving the
demolition of about 100 old houses,
were projected, the residents protested
so vigorously that an inquiry was held.
Following this, the N.S.W. Minister for
Local Government, Mr. Morton,
announced that a major part of the
Sydney suburb would be zoned as a
special residential area to preserve its
historic and architectural character.
When the shouting died down, it
became clear that what sounded very

simple and generous in a Minister’s
handout was decidedly more compli-
cated on the drawing-boards of the
State Planning Authority. It has also
become clear that the Authority is fight-
ing a rearguard action with all the skill
of bureaucracy.
The area west of Jersey Road which
was to be “special” now appears on the
Authority’s maps as 2G grading, a
classification which has not existed
before. Decisions on other areas affected
by the original road plan have been
deferred. As an added complication,
part of Paddington has, since the
Sydney City Council boundaries
shrunk, been transferred from the city
to Woollahra Council.
The Paddington Society and other
battlers for the suburb are used to
delays and complications. What is
riling them at the moment is the matter
of protest forms. When the Minister
made his announcement in August he
said that protests would be received
until November 4. These are acceptable
only on State Planning Authority forms.
The Authority now blandly says it is
out of supplies.
OFF THE BEAT ,
ENGLISH legal authority C. H.
Rolph, now visiting Australia, has
looked at the law from two remark-
ably contrasting standpoints in his long
career — as a police officer and a
member of the staff of that canon of
Left-wing intellectual opinion in Eng-
land, the “New Statesman.”
So N.S.W. Police Cqmmissioner
Norman Allan may like to take com-
fort from Rolph’s opinion of his
handling of the Glenfield siege. The
N.S.W. police force may have been
a laughing stock among the British
Press, Rolph said during a Press con-
ference in Sydney last week, but not
among lawyers, criminologists, and
police. “He did a courageous thing —
it was experimental and it worked. He
had more guts than I would have —
I think I would probably have rushed
the house at night, but in doing that
I might have caused more trouble than
he did.”
To cynics, “an academic bobby” is
probably a contradiction in terms, but
that’s the way Rolph remembers him-
self before his switch fro,m the police
force to journalism. As a P.C., ser-
geant, and, later, Chief Inspector C. R.
Hewitt of the City of London Police,
he arrested “a few unlucky thieves
inagile enough not to get away, some
horizontal drunks, and a goat which was
wandering around London, lost. And
I wrote a lot of screeds — in fact,
I produced a massive code of instruc-
tions of 400,000 words for the City
of London Police.”
But under the pen-name of C. H.
Rolph he has written even .more in the
past 21 years in his capacity as the
“New Statesman’s” legal corres-
pondent, campaigning for reforms now
achieved, such as the abolition of the
death penalty, flogging, the crime of
suicide, the virtual abolition of
imprisonment for debt, the withdrawal
of penal sanctions from private homo-
sexuality, and reforms relating to
abortions and literary censorship.
The recent conference of the N.S.W.
Council for Civil Liberties in Sydney
pushed law reform into the news and
prompted debate about whether or not
we should have an American-style Bill
of Rights incorporated into the Aus-
tralian Constitution—something Rolph
is against.
“I can’t say very much about this as
it applies to Australia, because I don’t
know enough. But, in general, it’s not a
good idea. It destroys the elasticity of
common law, and it has led in the U.S.
to some decisions which tie the hands
of the police. For instance, it doesn’t
allow the admission of evidence found
in a house entered for other purposes—
so if police enter a house looking for
LSD and find stolen property they
can’t bring it into court. This doesn't
happen in Britain.”
One topic Rolph will probably be
tackling repeatedly during his five-week
lecture tour of Australia is “Crime,
Violence, and the Press,” which deals
with the responsibility of Press and tele-
vision in the business of reporting the
kind of bizarre crime which can invite
imitation. “There is no doubt that this
can happen. It happened in England
as a result of Glenfield. We had a simi-

A UNIQUE DULLNESS
THAT'S WORTH
FIGHTING FOR
YOUR CORRESPONDENT is terribly
disturbed about all this “brightening
cricket” talk. Mr. R. J. Parish, Chair-
man of the Australian Board of Con-
trol, returned from England and gave
some hints on the subject. In England
he had seen “knockout” one-day
matches between county teams, he
enthused over Sunday “cavalier”
matches between international teams.
We learned further, to our horror, that
in those matches it was customary for
players to have microphones around
their necks, so that they could describe
what they were doing.
No doubt this is the cricket of the
future. Oh, yes, your man also went
to the St. Kilda Cricket Ground to
observe the international contest be-
tween two-man teams. This was the
affair staged by NLT Productions, the
same people who put on Bobby Limb’s
“Sound of Music.” They had girls in
scarlet micro-mini skirts to sell the pro-
grams, and the cricket itself was a
non-stop affair with Freddie Trueman
clowning and hitting sixes, Bill Lawry
bowling eye-level bouncers, and Colin
Milburn being jolly with the crowd
regarding his figure. Just to give you
some idea how distasteful it all was,
there wasn’t a maiden bowled all day.
It is time we formed some sort of
Cricket Watchers’ Protection Associa-
tion to stop the sensation mongers who
want to put pep into cricket. Yes,
cricket is dull, but you must realise
that this is the charm of the game. If
you want blood and passion you go to
a football match, or a bullfight, or to
ice hockey, or perhaps to a fight at
Festival Hall.
Ah, but cricket is the perfect

soporific, the ideal tranquilliser. It has
all the restful beauty of a day’s fish-
ing. Occasionally one gets a bite and
the game works up to a tremendous
climax, but fortunately they do not
come often enough to make the affair
tiresome.
In these days of hustle, of electric
guitars, transistor radios, jumbo jets,
parking meters, instant mash, and
Harry Miller, cricket is the one restful
thing that is left to us. I find the
real charm in cricket is that one can
doze so beautifully, or if one goes off
for four or five beers to return an
hour later, then the game is exactly
as one put it down, with perhaps just
another seven or eight runs on the
board.
But in this two-man cricket, go
away for 15 minutes, they have hit
five sixes and completed a whole
innings.
It is preposterous this idea of
wanting to finish matches in one day.
Don’t these people realise that the
game is unique. What other form of
entertainment takes five or six days
to complete? Well, the only other
pastime that goes on for five days is
Chinese opera, and I suspect that is
not what it used to be. I bet the
Communists are trying to brighten it
up.
Dull cricket has such a long and
beautiful tradition. There was an
example of this in the first interna-
tional match played on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground back in the New Year
of 1862. The Melbourne and Districts
XVIII were all out for 118, then Mr.
Stephenson’s All England XI took
nearly two days to make 305. Toward
the end of the third day the Melbourne
captain, George Marshall, started to
adopt delaying tactics. Why, the
“Herald” even accused Marshall of
“A frightful match I couldn’t sleep
a wink!”

There was the day at the MCG in
1883 when the great W. L. Murdoch,
the Grace of Australia, took 2J hours
to make 19. Alec Bannerman took four
hours to make 41 for Australia at the
MCG in 1892. One of the most memor-
able efforts was by W. R. Playle, who
scored 18 in 194 minutes for New
Zealand in a Test at Leeds in 1958.
This is one run every ten minutes and
it is a noble effort that has never been
equalled in a Test. But then, of course,
in Karachi in October, 1956, there were
only 95 runs scored all day. Australia
was 80 all out and Pakistan 2-15.
The put-pep-in-cricket types are
always talking of the late ’twenties and
early ’thirties when there were innings
scores of over 1000, when the Ponsfords
and Bradmans made their triple cen-
turies. Actually it was a very trying
period. Spectators found they couldn’t
stand the sight of having the same
batsmen at the wicket, thrashing four
after four. In every cricket spectator
there is a healthy streak of sadism.
There is nothing so enjoyable as the
sight of stumps spreadeagled and noting
the expression of the batsman’s face
as he makes the long walk to the
pavilion. In the ’twenties you could
easily wait for days for this to happen.
It is most interesting to turn back
to the newspapers of 1927-28, and there
you will find no end of cartoons and
ieading articles pleading for an end to
the mammoth scores. There were cries
for better bowlers and even some
frightful suggestions such as using four
stumps instead of three.
No, we have kept the game fairly
consistently dull ever since the visit of
Mr. Stephenson’s Eleven, and it has
always remained most popular with the
crowds. I, for one, if they start
brightening it too .much, will turn in
my MCG medallion.

let’s make darn’d sure they don’t get in.
The Assembly turns out magnificently
today. The benches are crammed with
members lolling in sartorial inelegance,
and at 2.30 a bell rings and the Speaker,
the Honorable Kevin Ellis, walks in,
bewigged and gowned. Everyone rises,
he says a prayer, and the session is off
the ground.
The scene below is thus: Mr. Speaker
sits in a raised canopied chair,
described by some as a pale copy of
the one in British Parliament. It is
the men, murmurs Lord Brooke, who
make Parliament, not the furniture. He
is having difficulty crossing his legs
because of the confined space. He
sighs. Produces a pair of white plastic
spectacles and studies the view. Before
Mr. Speaker are three bewigged men,
a large stable of reference books,
stationery, water jug, lectern on which
to put notes, two microphones attached
to the ceiling and which could
be affixed to Lord Brooke’s bootlace
for all the good they’re doing. He
can’t hear a thing anyone says, and
after a while nods off. As do his com-
panion delegates. While down below
the talk ranges from condolences to
drugs to naughty solicitors and a train-
track—err was it road-track?—that’s
taken 69 years to get moving. There is
a Press gallery and reporters taking
down every fascinating syllable, and all
the time a coming-and-going of
Members and attendants and note-
passing and slanging matches. Order,
order, order shouts Mr. Speaker at one
stage and is absolutely ignored . . .
. . . well, you must have had a good
lunch, says someone to Lord Brooke,
as he awakens from his third nap. No,
it wasn’t all that good. The thing is,
they did promise to remove them from
here at 3.30. Mr. Sheahan, Labor
Member for Burrinjuck, has held the
floor for 15 minutes now and Lord
Brooke says things are a bit gayer in
London. For one thing, you can hear
what people say there, for another
everyone would have walked out on
this one long before now. Ten minutes
later he nudges his neighbor delegate
James Stodart, from Scotland, who
played the best 17-hole game of his life
the other day in bare feet and says it’s
no shoes for him from now on, and
they leave.
There is a big hall between the Legis-
lative Assembly and the Speaker’s room.
This hall is out of bounds to the
public, and, today, Members are rushing
through like packs of schoolboys off for
tea. Attendant Mr. Downes is guard-
ing this area and he’s in his wooden
box checking Members’ names fropi a
list, he can never remember them off-
hand, and saying it’s still a mystery as
to what happened to Mr. Speaker’s
stolen antique chair. It was he who
locked the room up last thing at night
and opened it next morning. Actually
there were two theories circulating: one,
it is a Member’s prank on Mr. Speaker,
another, the chair’s gone off to be
repaired. Mr. Downes adds a third.
He thinks it went up in smoke.

IS MR. GORTON A GOOD POLITICIAN?
Comment by ‘Observer’
FORGET, for the purposes of this
piece, how good or how bad you
consider Mr. Gorton to be as a Prime
Minister and consider how good or
how bad he is as a politician as a
practical expert in the consideration of
questions of power, influence, and
prestige.
It was, as you will remember, mainly
as a politician that the Liberal Party
picked Mr. Gorton in the first place.
He was the choice not of most of the
central leaders of the party, but mainly
of the outsiders, and in particular of
backbenchers in marginal seats. Worried
by the comparatively slight reverse of
the preceding Senate election, and
fearing that Mr. Whitlam had
developed a political style that Mr.
Holt might not be able to match they
seemed to think that the momentum of
the Menzies Cabinet that Mr. Holt had
taken over had run out of gas. They
looked outside the old names for a
new one and found Senator John
Gorton, the hero of the F-11l debates.
They thought they had found a vote-
getter.
Nine months later some of those
very Liberals who had put him into
power were calling on Mr. Gorton
asking him not to call an election for
November 30. They did this because
they were not confident that he could
bring in the votes.
It was not Mr. Whitlam they feared
this time. Earlier in the year, in its
now sadly predictable manner, the
Labor Party had done in its own leader,
with some help fro,m Mr. Whitlam
himself, who, although he seems to be
able to make statesmanlike speeches
and seems to have some understanding
of Liberal voters, continues to show a
fatal weakness in not understanding the
very party that is his instrument of
power. This time it was the DLP that
the Liberals feared, and this for the
extraordinary reason that Mr. Gorton
had ignored a significant part of the
very basis of his power.
Sir Robert Menzies and Mr. Holt
knew that, apart from the sheer vanity
and devilry of some of its machine
men (which should not be under-
estimated), what split the Labor Party
was the foreign policy of the Liberal-
Country Party Government and the
role the DLP had in this, directly and
indirectly—directly by a special appeal
to those voters to whom Australia’s
place in the world seemed to matter,
and indirectly by pointing up the
Labor Party as a divided Party that
could appear unlikely to offer sound
government.
Throughout the year, in his unfor-
tunate habit of thinking aloud about
Australian foreign policy, Mr. Gorton
although not coming down with
anything definite, and, indeed, fre-
quently contradicting himself never-
theless suggested to the DLP (and not
only to them) that there was likely to
be a fundamental shift in Australian
attitudes, if only by default (viz. a shift
from an attitude to a non-attitude).
His Defence Minister and his External
Affairs Minister did their best to sug-
gest otherwise, but this did not convince
the DLP.. When the DLP threatened
Mr. Gortoa that they would lose him
some seats this threat seemed credible
to those Liberals whose seats were the
ones that would be lost.
It is possible that Mr. Gorton may
maintain a naive and too exclusive
attention to the thought of himself on
television. One interpretation of his
conduct is that, in something of a
Bonapartist way, he sees himself as
some kind of personal embodiment of
the people’s will. According to this
interpretation he sees himself appealing
directly to the masses, thereby rising
above the ordinary consideration of
power, such as keeping in with his
Cabinet colleagues, using the Public
Service to enlarge his judgment, main-
taining the support of his backbenchers
and keeping an eye on the DLP or
remembering the split in the ALP.
He may be deluding himself. He is
not all that good on television and he
is now showing some symptoms of
over-exposure. (His biggest television
asset is that Mr. Whitlam has had the
wind knocked out of him.) And his
reading of the Gallup Polls may be
false: they might be registering only
a very superficial preference, that
could easily be disturbed by unexpected
events. It would be a very bold and a
very risky assumption for him to make
that he has a Napoleonic genius for
rising above the ordinary intractabilities
of power. It might be better if he
considered the real reasons why the
Liberals have remained in power for
so long. For instance, how much of a
vote-getter is Mr. Gorton going to be
if his foreign policy draws closer to
that of Dr. Cairns than to that of Mr.
Whitlam?
It would not be to Mr. Gorton’s
discredit if he did concern himself with
questions of power. He would be a
disastrous Prime Minister if he did not.
It is more a matter of raising the doubt
whether he is concerning himself
sufficiently with questions of power
or concerning himself with them suffi-
ciently realistically. Paradoxically, it
might be that by becoming a better
Prime Minister he might become a
better politician. For example, it might
be expedient for his Party as well as
desirable for the nation that he should
let us know pretty soon what foreign
policy his Government has.
WHY KEEP OUR POLITICIANS POOR?
Comment by Alan Reid
PRIME MINISTER John Gorton is
under pressure to give Federal parlia-
mentarians a pay rise before Christmas.
Public reaction will probably be
emotional and hostile. Before the
emotion develops it is worth while try-
ing to take a cool look at the proposal.
Rank-and-file parliamentarians re-
ceive a salary of $7OOO a year. If they
represent a city electorate they get
additionally an electorate allowance of
$2200 a year, if a country electorate
$2600 a year. Their last pay rise was
in 1964.
I do not go along with the argument
of Mr. Ted St. John, Liberal Member
for Warringah, that higher salaries
would attract better candidates. Though
there are exceptions—which include the
political “accidents”—,men who stand
for or enter Parliament are usually
people who believe strongly that they
know what is best for their fellow men.
They have the governing instinct. They
desire to be in Parliament because of
the power position it gives them, and
would still do so even if there were no
salaries and they had to exist, as
working-class parliamentarians once
had to, upon uncertain subsidies from
unions or other politically minded
organisations.
Taking the lawyers alone, it costs
Mr. St. John, who is a QC, and such
people as Attorney-General Nigel
Bowen, QC, and Tom Hughes, QC,
money to be in the Parliament. They
would be earning much more if they
were following their professions full-
time. The same applies to people who
enter the Parliament from other lucra-
tive avocations.
But having said that, it is necessary
to point out that the bulk of the 124
Members of the House of Representa-
tives and the 60 Members of the Senate
are full-time professional politicians
during the period they remain parlia-
mentarians. Professor Fin Crisp, in his
“Australian National Government,” did
a dissection of the 1933/1966 House of
Representatives, many of whose Mem-
bers are still in the present House of
Representatives. His list of Members’
vocational backgrounds shows 13 pas-
toralists, 15 in other branches of
primary production, 22 from commerce,
industry, or finance, six shopkeepers,

22 white-collar employees, eight manual
workers, nine trade-union officials, 13
lawyers, eight teachers, four journalists,
one ex-career Serviceman, and nine
belonging to other professions.
Relatively few of those would be able
to supplement their parliamentary earn-
ings by part-time work in their jobs or
professions. Additionally, there is a
general tendency for the Australian
voter to demand from his representative
full-time application to the parliamen-
tary job. Since this is so, voters should
be prepared to allow their representa-
tives to live at a reasonable standard.
But the problem remains as to what
constitutes a reasonable standard of
pay, and it is the differences about this
that produce hostility whenever parlia-
mentarians propose to give themselves
a rise.
Quite a number of parliamentarians
do not need a pay rise. The wealthy
men—and there are some very wealthy
men in Parliament—would merely be
getting an unneeded bonus. But, in my
view, parliamentary salaries have to
meet the needs of the man who is
dependent solely on his parliamentary
income. This has to be the case to
preserve the principle that the poorest
man in the community should be in a
position to win the highest office if his
qualities merit it.
There is another factor, too. Both the
voters and the Parties are insisting upon
younger men as their representatives.
It is these younger men, with families
still on their hands, who get my sym-
pathy. They are paying off their homes.
They constantly have to find money
for electoral needs and the charitable
requests which, in most cases, they feel
they have a duty to meet. Quite a num-
ber of these younger men are in debt,
struggling to keep sons and daughters
at universities or at school. I take the
view that politicians are exposed to
enough temptations in the everyday
performance of their duties without the
additional pressure of being forced into
debt.
Mr. Gorton’s idea is to lift parlia-
mentary salaries out of the arena of
public disputation by raising the,m to
the level of Second Division officers of
the Commonwealth Public Service and
pegging them at that level. Thereafter,
parliamentary pay rises would happen
only as the result of a flow on from
these Second Division rises. Getting
them to Second Division levels, how-
ever, is a problem. Second Division
officers get $9500 a year. Parliamen-
tarians would have to get a rise of $2500
in one bite possibly too large a lift
for the public to swallow.
Mr. Gorton has to make the decision
whether he will give the pay rise before
Christmas and in one or two bites. If
it is remembered that he is catering for
the majority of parliamentarians, those
who are dependent exclusively upon
their parliamentary salaries to maintain
their homes, meet their electoral obli-
gations, and educate their children, the
row that will inevitably occur when the
pay rises come can be seen properly.


AUSTRALIA
The drama
of the
non-election
WHEN MR. GORTON spoke to
journalists last week about his decision
to defer an election, what most sur-
prised the;m was the Prime Minister’s
steaming fury with the Democratic
Labor Party. When the questions pre-
dictably rolled off with the request for
a comment on “the inevitable sugges-
tion that you were forced to take this
decision by the DLP,” a denial was
only to be expected but not such an
angry and emotional one.
As the Press conference went on, Mr.
Gorton kept coming back to the DLP’s
statement that they might adopt a
selective-preference policy: “I would
like to reiterate,” he said, at the end of
the conference, “that one thing I regret
in this, and there is only one thing I
regret in this, I would have loved to
have seen what happened to the DLP.
I greatly missed that fight.”
Mr. Gorton claimed that the DLP
decision was “really nothing to do at
all in any way” with the deferment of
the election. “Now you have got to
believe that or not believe it. The
people who read it have got to believe
it or not believe it.”
Whatever the reaction elsewhere, few
people believed it in Parliament House,
Canberra. Mr. Gorton himself does
certainly not seem to have been influ-
enced directly by the DLP against an
election, but he was greatly affected
by its aftermath of Liberal anxiety.
It is true that he said he was so
affronted by the impertinence of the
DLP in considering not to give him
their support, that he nearly called an
election to have a fight with them. “If
there could have been anything which
would have led to an election, it was
the statements made by the DLP . . .
for a while it made me waver a bit.”
But when DLP leader Senator Gair
had spoken to Mr. Gorton a week
earlier and told him that his Party had
decided it couldn’t give him a “blank
cheque” in an early election because
the Prime Minister hadn’t got a satis-
factory defence policy worked out, Mr.
Gorton had been quite cool and actually
thanked him for coming and putting
his views personally. The Prime
Minister’s later virulence surprised
Senator Gair.
It was not Senator Gair’s interview,
but the results of it that irritated the
Prime Minister. In the week that
followed, Mr. Gorton was thoroughly
worked on by Liberal parliamentarians
and machinemen, who were concerned
that the shift of DLP preferences would
cost the Party seats.
From Thursday
through to Sunday, at
least seven, and pos-
sibly as many as 12,
colleagues tackled him,
urging deferment of
the election. One of
Mr. Gorton’s staunch-
est supporters was in
a terrible flap, since his seat was men-
tioned as one that might be endangered.
He spoke for many others when he told
Mr. Gorton the DLP wasn’t kidding.
The Prime Minister’s conversations with
these visitors and other visitors centred
on the question of whether the DLP
could control its preferences a fact
which suggested he took the DLP threat
seriously.
Mr. Gorton did not get much sym-
pathy, however, from his anger at the
DLP. When it all came out at his
Press conference, he said he had
deferred the election for exactly the
reasons the DLP had been saying he
should defer it. Even, as one unkind
journalist pointed out, down to using
the same phrase as Mr. Santamaria
and Senator Gair. “Really what I
would have been doing would have
been going to the people and saying:
‘Look, vote for me instead of for Whit-
lam,’ more or less give us a blank
cheque.” He repeated the very same
arguments the DLP used about the
Government’s lack of policies on
defence and social services: “There
would not, in my view, have been time
thoroughly to dissect and discuss and
analyse and come down to a properly
considered defence policy for Australia
after the things that have taken place
up there.” (Asia presumably.) And
speaking of welfare, he said: “There
are also a number of social service
matters which Jim Forbes tells me we
could have put forward as vote-catching
proposals, but they are really still work-
ing hard on trying to get to the root
of a few problems ... I think it will
take a little time to go.” After a
rather rambling talk, when Mr. Gorton
was asked: “What you are really saying,
sir, is that there was no issue.” He
replied: “There was no issue.”
He admitted by implication, that his
initial reason for planning an early
election had been his need to establish
his authority in the Party and the
Cabinet. He said that “in the last
couple of months I believe that I
have got it,” claiming that lack of
support in the Party was no longer a
factor. But the ministerial reshuffle
John Gorton last week ...no blank cheque
the Prime Minister was planning is off
for the time being as a result. He
feels he cannot make changes in his
Government until after a poll, and by
a blunt “no” to the question of whether
he would do so, he seems to have
committed himself.
But predictability is not one of Mr.
Gorton’s characteristics, and the way
he is disagreeing with some of his
Ministers, it wouldn’t be surprising if
there were changes before the end of
next year.
DEFENCE POLICY
DRIFTING AGAIN
THE PRESSURE of an election off,
the Government is drifting again on
defence policy. A meeting of the
Cabinet Defence and Foreign Affairs
Committee scheduled for last Wednes-
day was called off by Mr. Gorton, so
there has been as yet no discussion in
the Cabinet of the much-publicised
strategic reassessment, despite the fact
that it was finished by the Public
Service Defence Committee months ago.
Individual Ministers continue to
make their separate pronouncements,
hoping to present their colleagues with
commitments. Mr. Gorton still talks of
defence entirely in continental terms,
and as if it can have only a low
priority in the allocation of national
resources. At Mornington, speaking with
Army Minister Lynch, he declared:
“We must devote more and more, not
of our Gross National Product, but
more and more toward building up
our own defences so that we can,
should the time ever arise when it is
needed, meet any first shock of attack
upon ourselves or the Territories for
which we are responsible— meet it, hold
it, perhaps beat it back by ourselves —•
but if not, at least meet it, hold it,
until further assistance comes.”
Interpreters of the Prime Minister’s
thinking say this is a remarkable one
sentence statement of his whole defence
policy, which, they say, has three


Fairhall...defence speak-out
elements: (1) That defence should not
take more than the current five percent
of GNP, and its cost should only grow
at the same rate as the economy, (2)
that the primary role for Australia’s
defence forces should be to repel
attempts at the invasion or bombing
of Australia and New Guinea, and
(3) that Australia should rely on the
Americans for any defence forces which
cannot be provided out of five percent
of GNP.
Entirely absent from Mr. Gorton’s
pronouncements is any idea of military
assistance to allies in South-East Asia
as one part of a multi-faceted economic,
political, diplomatic, and military
policy. This is obviously at the crux of
External Affairs Minister Hasluck’s
thinking, as it was with the late
Mr. Holt’s.
Defence Minister Fairhall, too, was
speaking out last week, and the whole
trend of his thought was the opposite
of Gortonian continental defence.
Speaking at National Export Week in
Sydney, he said: “In our defence plan-
ning and preparations, we need to look
ahead many years to prepare for a
variety of situations as this country
moves to an era which may call for the
assumption of wider responsibilities.”
This is a restatement of a little-
reported comment the Defence Minister
made a week earlier when he predicted:
“The wars we are likely to be involved
in in future are very likely to be
‘wars of national liberation’ of the type
in which we are now engaged in
Vietnam.”
At the present time, it appears that
Mr. Gorton wants narrower responsi-
bilities for Australia, not wider ones,
and he wants to keep right out of wars
of national liberation. In this he is, of
course, being more Labor than Liberal,
and one of the sources of his intense
anger at the DTP is the fact that they
are pointing this out, and enlisting a
great deal of support in Mr. Gorton’s
own Party in the process.

NUCLEAR POWER
CAN AUSTRALIA CATCH
UP WITH TAIWAN?
MR. GORTON HAS talked a great
deal about “development” since he be-
came Prime Minister, but has done
very little. His first Budget saw
virtually no new development projects
being announced, and development
expenditure tailing off. This doesn’t
mean that he isn’t serious. He just
hasn’t got around to looking at projects
and making decisions.
With the Snowy Scheme finishing,
he will be looking for some grand
symbol of development. It would
obviously be difficult to find any
sensible project of comparable size and
spectacle. But there are a couple of
things currently being looked at which
could fill this role: one is a major
power-chemical-industrial complex at
Gladstone in Queensland, another is a
nuclear power program.
The nuclear program looks the
more likely. There have been various
proposals for nuclear power stations
put to the Commomvealth over the
past five years, but at last it seems that
a decision is about to be taken and a
start made.
There is now no doubt about the
type of nuclear reactor Australia will
adopt. It will be natural - uranium
fuelled, so that we will not be depend-
ent on costly and potentially restrictive
enriching arrangements with the U.S.
or Japan. And it is likely to be a steam-
generating, heavy-water (SGHW) re-
actor, the most advanced types being
developed in Canada and Britain.
The Atomic Energy Commission, in
its annual report published last week,
claimed that the capital cost of these
plants was now comparable with the
complex “enriched” fuel reactors for
stations larger than 500mws (Mun-
morah, near Newcastle, is 1400mw,
Hazelwood, in Victoria’s Latrobe
Valley, is lOOOmw) and since the run-
ning costs have always been lower, the
total generation costs should be more
competitive.
When the value of plutonium pro-
duced as a by-product is worked in,
there is no doubt that nuclear power
is now an economic proposition in
Australia. Various proposals have been
put forward. At first, these centred
around smaller stations of 200mw in
areas of deficient fuel and therefore
relatively high - cost conventionally
generated electricity. Adelaide, with the
worst fuel resources of any metropolitan
centre, was an obvious site, but the
exploitation of natural gas has set
nuclear energy back at least five years.
The remote mineral developments in
the North were next to be looked at
as sites for large metals smelters sup-
plied with nuclear power, but foreign
companies have preferred to buy the
ore rather than the smelted metal. So
those are out for the time being at
least.
Canberra was the site for a third
“small station” proposal, developed in
May this year and first reported in The
Bulletin. By 1975, when a station begun
now would come on steam, the national
capital will need up to 200mw, and
transmission costs from big stations of
the N.S.W. coalfields make Canberra’s
electricity expensive. A baseload 200mw
nuclear station was estimated to be
able to provide power at about 0.7 c per
unit, which is competitive with N.S.W.
electricity once all the transmission
charges are met. And an integral part
of the Canberra scheme would be the
use of surplus power in the Snowy in
“pumped storage” systems. These turn
turbines into pumps, putting water
already used to generate peak-load elec-
tricity back up into high-level dams
where it can be used again for pro-
ducing more peak power.
Professor Titteron supported this
proposal again last week, though sug-
gesting the station be sited some 60
miles from Canberra in the Snowy area.
Government officials in Canberra are
very tightlipped about what is going
on, but it appears that the Snowy-
Canberra project is out of favor. There
are even bigger economies of scale in
nuclear than in conventional stations,
and it appears a much bigger project is
likely.
SGHW reactors of 400mw are being
talked about. These are estimated to be
able to produce electricity at as little as
0.4 c a unit, which is very close to the
price of the largest and most advanced
coal stations in N.S.W. and Victoria
(where 0.3 c is being aimed at).
Even if nuclear plants are marginally
more expensive to begin with, it appears
that over a ten-year perspective they are
cheaper. Liddel Station, near Singleton,
for instance, will probably start pro-
ducing at just below 0.3 c, but as the
closer and easier coal seams are worked
out, costs will creep up. A nuclear plant
might start at 0.4 c, but, as experience
was gained and systems improved, costs
should fall.
The only States which can use a
500mw block of nuclear-generated elec-
tricity are N.S.W. and Victoria. The
Victorians, by all accounts, are far more
interested and co-operative than the
N.S.W. electricity authorities in their
dealings with the Commonwealth and


the Atomic Energy Commission. So the
betting is that Victoria will get the first,
a New South Wales copy being started
about the time the Victorian one
comes on steam, with Canberra and
S.A. following late in the ’seventies.
The Victorian station is likely to be
sited at Western Port, close to the in-
dustrial centre of gravity of that State,
minimising transmission costs. For
N.S.W. it is likely to be somewhere to
the south of Sydney, to balance up the
weight of coal-fired stations in the
north. For Canberra, the initial pro-
posed site is just a few miles east of
the city on the Molonglo River, near
the airport and Fairbaiiv* Airbase. A
trouble with this site is that it would be
horribly vulnerable to attack. It is near
the huge Russell Hill complex of the
Defence Departments, and, together
with these, would be a magnificent
target.
An alternative Canberra site is to the
south-west of the Territory on the Mur-
rumbidgee. There it would be at a safer
distance from the city and closer to the
Snowy and the N.S.W.-Victoria elec-
tricity grid.
A South Australian station would go
north-west of Adelaide. If a four-station
nuclear program, costing $4OO million,
based on 500mw units, seems un-
realistic to some, it is worth pointing
out that this is exactly the plan which
Taiwan is working to. It will have
four such stations in operation by 1980.
PARLIAMENT
"BLUE HILLS" DEBATE
THE SIGHT WAS unique. Right-wing
Liberals like Malcolm Mackay and
Jim Killen were teamed with Left-
wing Labor men Gordon Bryant and
Clyde Cameron. Senior Cabinet
Minister Paul Hasluck was publicly
opposing his Prime Minister. But more
unusual was an occurrence outside the
House of Representatives. Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlam (lake) has
agreed to be paired with his recent
challenger for the leadership, Dr. J. F.
Cairns (hill).
It was heady stuff. Backbench
MHRs were rejoicing after emulating
the Senate’s achievement in thumping
the Establishment and voting heavily
(50 to 39) against Sir Robert Menzies,
Lord Holford, the National Capital
Development Commission, and John
Gorton’s beloved lake site for a new
and permanent Parliament House.
But the Representatives victory was
not quite as solid a triumph as that
of the Senate. Even before the debate
began, the Establishment threw a
spanner into the works. Early on
Thursday morning, Interior Minister
Peter Nixon, whose NCDC has other
plans for Capital Hill, revealed he
would widen the scope of the debate
to allow consideration of Camp Hill
(a mound behind the present building)
if the lake site was defeated.
It seemed curious that the Establish-
ment suddenly found the Camp Hill
site so attractive. But a close scrutiny
of numbers made it obvious. The lake
men were going to lose, and Camp
Hill must have seemed a less un-
attractive choice than Capital Hill.
Just before the vote between hill
and lake took place, hillmen-leader
Gordon Bryant sent a message to
Government Whip Dudley Erwin
(lake). The message suggested that if
the lake was chosen, the Government
choose Joern Utzon as architect and
General Dynamics as builders.
But the vote turned out in favor of
the hill. Then Nixon moved his
amendment, referring the matter back
to the Select Committee for a choice
between Capital and Camp Hills. The
ruse worked: Capital Hill men went
to water.
Even then, the Capital Hill team
had a chance for absolute victory.
Filled with elation, they might have
knocked out Nixon’s proposal as soon
as it was made, but Bryant decided to
speak on Nixon’s amendment, throw-
ing the issue open to debate, and the
waverers had time to think.
The biggest shock of the debate
came with the final vote. The Capital
Hill men agreed to Nixon’s proposal
on the voices. So confused was the
decision that House Leader Billie
Snedden (lake) asked Speaker Aston
to put the question again to ensure
Members knew what they were decid-
ing.
The debate, already becoming a mini
“Blue Hills,” was dull on Thursday
Principals in the debate (l. to r.):
Nixon, Bryant, Snedden, and Aston
in comparison with previous occasions.
Some speakers spent as little as 90
seconds on the floor. And perhaps the
interest was reflected by a call over
the loudspeaker system on Thursday
morning. “The siting of Parliament
House will resume after the lunch
break,” the anonymous voice advised,
“those desirous of speaking are asked
to attend.”
During the debate, Peter Nixon
happily agreed to Billie Snedden’s
suggestion that he alter his proposal,
to require a report from the Commit-
tee within three months. Nixon
originally suggested only one month.
But what neither Nixon nor Sned-
den mentioned was that Parliament
will not resume until next March
effectively preventing consideration of
the report for at least five months. A
curious situation, considering John
Gorton’s earlier insistence that a de-
cision be made as quickly as possible.
SCIENCE
IN CLOSE AGREEMENT
SIR ROBERT MENZIES and Mr.
Holt were rather stodgy in their atti-
tudes toward international co-operative
agreements. Mr. Gorton has changed
this. Australia signed its first cultural
agreement under him with Indonesia.
And now it has concluded its first
science agreement. It is with the United
States. The initiative came from Presi-
dent Johnson, and the agreement is
part of an American effort to increase
scientific exchange in the Pacific region.
The Australian Department of
Education and Science will co-operate
with the U.S. National Science
Foundation in working out new mutual-
aid arrangements. The agreement was
worked out between Mr. Malcolm
Fraser, Minister for Education and
Science, and President Johnson’s Presi-
dential Assistant for Science and
Technology, Dr. Hornig. The com-
munique specified three new areas in
which co-operation will be promoted
by both Governments: environmental
sciences (weather, hydrology, marine
affairs, minerals), agriculture, and
biology.
Sir Hugh Ennor, the department’s
head, in an address, explained the
agreement as follows: “There is already
considerable co-operation between the
scientists of our two countries this
collaboration is something which is
happening without any official stimulus
in the official Government sense. At
any one time in CSIRO it is common-
place for a dozen or so U.S. scientists
to be spending 6-12 months in the
Organisation’s laboratories. It is
commonplace, too, for many U.S. scien-
tists to be working in university
laboratories and research institutes, and
it goes without saying that there is a
very great number of Australian scien-
tists working in laboratories of one kind
and another in the United States.
“It is not our intention to formalise
what are obviously successfully operat-


ing informal arrangements, for to do
so would be to achieve no useful pur-
pose. Rather it is our intention to open
up opportunities for exchange from
those areas where little exchange occurs
at present. For example, a check over
the past seven years shows that of the
U.S. scientists who have visited CSIRO
only 14 percent came from U.S.
Governmental scientific agencies. The
remainder came from universities, and
though they were, of course, welcome
it does seem to us that much of what
we are doing would be of equal interest
to those of the U.S. scientists who are
in Federal or State research laboratories.
“We look forward to arrangements
whereby more U.S. scientists can come
to Australia to work in laboratories
here, which will provide the necessary
facilities, including most items of equip-
ment. In return, we look for similar
arrangements in the United States.”
TOURISM
NEW ATTRACTIONS
DEVELOPING TOURISM in
Australia has its problems, as the 17-
month-old Australian Tourist Commis-
sion is beginning to find out. The
Commission has put up a series of
proposals to the Federal Government
to boost tourism but, at least one cuts
right across Government policy and has
received the cold shoulder.
The Commission has set a target of
600,000 tourists a year by 1975 (316,000
are expected this year) who would
spend more than $2OO million on
present figures. But reaching this target
depends on a lot of “ifs.”
One proposal the Commission has
put up calls for the Government to
relax its present policy and allow more
charter flights to operate in and out
of Australia. It feels this is essential
for Australia to attract visitors who
would not normally travel by the more
costly, scheduled air services. But the
Department of Civil Aviation has acted
very coolly to this proposal, indicating
it is not prepared even to consider it
at present. The Government relaxed
its charter policy a year ago, reducing
group charters to 60 percent of the
economy fare and charters by migrants’
parents to 50 percent of the round-trip
economy fare.
The DCA’s main concern is to
ensure that increased charter flights do
not cut into Qantas’ operations. Another
worry is that they might deter some
scheduled airlines from operating into
Australia, which in turn would hinder
Qantas in seeking reciprocal landing
rights in other countries.
The Commission has also got a few
backs up in the Department of Customs
and Excise with its call to ensure
“suitable” entry and exit procedures.
Customs officials quickly pointed out
that the maximum time for clearance
through entry procedures at Mascot
Airport is 25 minutes, which they say
is comparable to other countries.
While the Tourist Commission is
getting little joy in these directions, the
Government is more than anxious to
help develop tourist attractions in
Australia. The Interior Department is
now considering a Commission sugges-
tion to develop a world-standard wild-
life reserve in the Northern Territory
along the lines of Kruger Park in
South Africa.
The suggestion is that roads and
tourist accommodation be developed
in a strip of Crown land running 50
miles inland from the coast of Arnhem
Land, in an area which abounds in
animal life. Government officials have
already visited the area and are
impressed with its potential. The area
has obvious tourist attractions and
several tourist promotion companies are
already doing a good business operating
bus tours there.
In Meckering’s main street ...
THE WEST
SHATTERING 'QUAKE
MOST Western Australians had not
realised that the south-west corner of
their State was potential earthquake
country, and that the township of Yere-
coin, for example, had acknowledged
that it was unwise to build in brick
for this reason. In Meckering the initial
impression was that only the brick
homes had tumbled, but later it was
realised that only two of the town’s
80 homes were habitable. In one of the
brick homes near York, a home Mrs.
Margaret Robinson had lived in for
45 years with her husband (who was
out), the lady of the house grabbed
for the kitchen sink and hung on when
the shaking started; when it ended, she
found all the interior walls cracked, all
the outer walls demolished luckily
falling outward.
Perth people were thrown into mild
panic. A minority raced outside, includ-
ing one young man naked, wet from a
shower, but most were unaware of what
had happened until it was over. Win-
dows began to shake loudly, but it was
gale weather and this was to be
expected. But then buildings moved
with a pitch and yaw, leaving a sick-
headache feeling, particularly if perspec-
tives were available to line up trees
or other buildings outside. In shops
and libraries, contents of shelves were
spilt over.
...and in East Perth
The actual movement was in the
inland belt, centred on Meckering, and
the city and intermediate quake was
the result of waves moving toward the
sea. The most immediate initial re-
action was to the tremendous noise.
One Perth woman explained it aptly
when she said she felt she was on
the inside of a tambourine.
But this was mild stuff compared
with the sheer terror of Meckering and
the surrounding neighborhood. Farmers
in the fields saw their family houses
tumbling, yet could not run to them
because the ground was moving so
violently. Cars trying to get out of the
area came up against road after road
ending in walls or drops. The totally
unreal sensation of seeing the earth
broken, like a geology-class model of a
fault in a structure, heightened the fear
that dazed the country people. Around
Meckering in a 17-mile arc, they were
told, ran a fault that could be five to
25 miles deep; it had slipped only sft.
Fear spread like shock-waves over the
countryside. When they were told fur-
ther tremors were likely on the Tuesday,
people in Northam'—lB miles nearer
the coast than Meckering—stayed out-
of-doors all night in large numbers. The
tremors did come, and although they
were far less severe, one was enough to
damage severely the farmhouse of
Mr. Fred Patridge, 12 miles from
Meckering, although it had escaped the
big shake. In fact, tremors had been
building up before the Monday; 11 days
before, the most severe of three tremors
had registered 4.1 on the Richter scale.
The secondary wave was felt also in
Perth, where the telephonist on the
top floor of the T. and G. Building
commented: “We were wondering
whether we should try to get out of the
building when the shaking stopped.”
There were stories of stoicism.
York’s Civil Emergency Association
president, Mr. Stan Irvine, was in
hospital with a heart attack, but guided
the 100 men of his organisation from
a bedside phone. Meckering’s most
beautiful old mansion, Caversham, was
demolished. But owner Mr. Norman
Richardson said: “Together Mum and
I watched the old house go, with it
all our belongings. But then I realised

it was no good just standing there and
I went to see if our neighbors needed
help.”
Meckering storekeepers gave away
all their stocks to the soup kitchens
and barbecue-food lines for the home-
less. The relief fund of Lord Mayor
Tom Wardle, in Perth, became the
basis for a deposit on new homes,
backed by loans at slashed rates from
a building society.
Perth had no casualties only because
it was a public holiday, and the streets
were deserted as a north-west gale blew
rain across the city. Hundreds of school-
children were at the pictures, and
there was concern for their safety
within city theatres. Many churches
were damaged. A 2001 b. cross fell from
the top of St. Mary’s Catholic
Cathedral, and drove itself into the
grass; the beautiful old Guildford
Grammar chapel was declared unsafe;
the bells of St. George’s Anglican
Cathedral set themselves pealing; and
the old Town Hall clock got stuck at
II a.m.
VICTORIA
NO GIN MALTEDS
LEGISLATION CAN occur in many
strange and curious ways. Take the
amendment to Victoria’s 1968 Liquor
Control Act, for example. When Mr.
Manson, the Acting Chief Secretary,
introduced the amending Bill into the
State Parliament last week, there was
much puzzlement over why it contained
provisions re-introducing a system of
permits to cover the consumption of
liquor in unlicensed restaurants and
cafes. It was noted that not only did
this follow the abolition of the permit
procedure only six months ago, but
also that Mr. Manson gave no reason
for the change.
Although the immediate reasons for
the change were quite simple, the ante-
cedent events were not. The July Liquor
Control Act had re-enacted the whole
of the State’s licensing laws, including
some of the recommendations of the
Royal Commissioner (the urbane and
seasoned constitutional lawyer, Sir
Philip Phillips, QC) into the sale, con-
sumption, and distribution of alcohol.
During the debate on the legislation
it was discovered that for nearly half
a century Victorians had been able to
consume liquor in milk bars legally,
but they didn’t know of the privilege.
“Troubled mother of five” soon took a
large share of the letter columns, and
the bubble rose up for a brief period,
aided by church organisations, women’s
groups, and the temperance societies.
Having never heard of trouble arising
out of beer and gin parties in the
State’s milk bars, the Government was
taken unawares. The Chief Secretary’s
office subsequently received a heavy
mail on the issue and several deputa-
tions, one including the Reverend John
Westerman, the Methodist Church’s
spokesman on social issues and the
major heavyweight of the temperance


side during the hearing of the 1965
Royal Commission.
Hence the amending legislation.
Having no reason to allow the con-
sumption of liquor in milk bars, no
demand for the right, and no politi-
cally vocal 12-year-old alcoholics
creating a stir, the Government found it
expedient to re-introduce the permit
system so that milk bars could be
excluded from those who could apply.
The only losers are the unlicensed
restaurants.
Where previously a cafe owner could
welcome the civilised drinker with his
bottle of red, it will now cost him
$250 for the right.
Cutler...raiding for a monster
EDUCATION
THE MONEY WAR
WHEN MOST New South Wales
teachers went on strike recently (and
those who remained on duty supported
the strikers’ claims), the New South
Wales Government pleaded that the
cupboard was bare: already spending
$1 million a day on education, there
was simply no more money available.
Since the strike, however, the Govern-
ment has scraped up another $1 million
for school buildings, and last week it
announced that teacher training would
be extended to a minimum of three
years immediately, at a cost of $5 mil-
lion per year.
Under pressure, the Minister for
Education, Mr. Charles Cutler, has
found the money, but as other Ministers
—especially those concerned with hos-
pitals, prisons, child welfare, police,
buses, tourism —point out privately, he
did it by raiding funds of all other State
Departments. Education is becoming a
financial monster.
The three - year teacher - training
scheme is otherwise universally wel-
comed. At the moment, most teachers
are either two-year trained or four-year
trained. This year, for example, 2850
two-year-trained teachers “entered the
service,” 970 four-year trained (B.As,
B.Scs, B.Ecs, etc.) and only 158 three-
year trained. New South Wales is the
last State to establish a three-year mini-
mum, and although the policy is to be
implemented immediately, there will
have to be a transition period in which
some trainees will continue to get only
two years’ training in order to maintain
the supply of teachers to the schools.
The war for money will continue.
Having scraped up another $6 million,
the Government now has to prepare for
the forthcoming hearings in the Indus-
trial Commission of a claim for an
award for lay teachers in private schools.
Since an award and increased salaries
seem inevitable, there will then be
further pressures on the Government for
increased State Aid to prevent many
of the Catholic schools from collapsing
and sending their children to the over-
crowded State schools. Education may
cost $1 million a day now, but N.S.W.
is only just beginning.
Hall...six-month study period
TOWN-PLANNING
SPRAWLING ADELAIDE?
FOLLOWING ITS initially favorable
reception two'months ago, the Metro-
politan Adelaide Transport Study
(MATS) report is now under attack
in a way no planning proposal has
been since Colonel William Light quar-
relled with Governor Hindmarsh over
Adelaide’s site. The report proposes
some 61 miles of freeways, 56 miles of
expressways and new arterial roads,
an underground city railway and fast
suburban rail services, feeder bus routes,
and numerous access roads, crossovers,
bridges, and parking areas. Designed
to serve a population of over a million
in a city that will be flatly wedged
between hills and sea for 50 miles from
north to south, the scheme is to take 18
years to co’mplete and an officially
estimated $574 million.
The report took three years to pre-
pare by an expert study group made up
of highway engineers, town and trans-
port planners, and special consultants
commissioned by the Playford Govern-
ment in 1965. On its release, Premier
Hall announced a six-month study
period during which all sections of the
community could express their views on
the proposals. Over three thousand
houses plus factories and com'mercial
premises lie in the way of the freeways,
and he explained that these properties
would be purchased by the Government
at full value and as if unaffected by
the scheme.
Since then there has been an
unparallelled public reaction against
the scheme. Dozens of local citizens’
committees have been formed to oppose
the plan on a variety of grounds;
groups, often with the support of local
councils, are arguing for greenbelts and
inner-suburban redevelopment rather
than grandiose highways, while groups
of architects, town planners, and
developers are arguing against the
report on the grounds that it will
encourage an unlimited suburban
sprawl.
On the political level the Govern-
ment has been strongly criticised by
Opposition Leader Dunstan for what
lie described as “utter administrative
incompetence” in the handling of the
report. Urgently calling for its with-
drawal on the grounds that property
values were being radically affected
before final decisions had been made,
he said that the essential and intrinsic
part of the report was the question of
its financial feasibility, and that only-
proposals within the State’s financial
competence should have been put for-
ward.
Faced with widespread public criti-
cism on the one hand and Opposition
pressure on the other, the Government
has, through its openhanded approach,
placed itself in a position of disadvan-
tage, even though it has not committed
itself to any part of the plan at this
stage.
But aside from the politics of the
situation the MATS report raises ques-
tions about the kind of city and State
late-20th-century South Australians are
to live in. With the MATS people
and the Highways Department arguing
for maximu'm mobility and spread, and
architects in particular calling for an
entirely different higher - density
approach to planned and integrated
living environments, it is the architects
who have advanced the most reasoned
criticism of the report.
Questioning both costs and overall
social priorities, the Dean of the
Faculty of Architecture in Adelaide,
Professor R. A. Jensen, claimed that on
his estimate, and taking into account
hidden costs, the MATS proposals
would require at the least $lOOO million
to complete. Arguing for a system of
fast public transport, he claimed that
the MATS proposals were likely to have
a widespread destructive effect on the
'metropolitan area “without any hope of
their solving, either in the long term
or short term, any transportation prob-
lems.”


OTC helps Slazengers win $560,000
export order to Japan
"Two international 'phone calls within
minutes clinched a $560,000 export
order," says Mr. Noel Morris,
Managing Director of Slazengers (Aust.)

American-made golf clubs featuring the
new aluminium shaft. A quick 'phone
call to Sydney got our production
arrangements under way and enabled
me to tie up a firm order. Our Works

Made in Singapore: heroes and enemies
In Djakarta, soldiers
carry coffins containing
bodies of two Indonesian
Marines executed in
Singapore last week
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
IN AUSTRALIA’S South-East Asian
neighborhood it was a depressing week.
The new Confrontation between the
Philippines and Malaysia further illus-
trated the distance between Malaysian
and Filipino nationalism. And realities
of the old Sukarno Confrontation
showed themselves to be not very far
beneath the surface. The Filipinos and
the Indonesians demonstrated their own
particular brands of national self-
centredness. Singapore once again illus-
trated its incapacity to understand its
neighbors or to get on with them.
The Malaysians struggled manfully
to appear reasonable in the face of un-
reason. Contradicting Prime Minister
Lee Kuan Yew’s hopes on leaving
Singapore for Japan a week before, the
general situation demonstrated itself to
be disturbed and irrational.
The sudden typhoon in Indonesian-
Singaporean relations blew up over the
hanging of two Indonesians sentenced
to death for the bomb outrage at
MacDonald House (which at that time
housed the Australian High Commis-
sion) in Singapore’s Orchard Road in
March, 1965. As in the earlier hanging
issue this year in Malaysia, the due pro-
cesses of justice, including an appeal to
the Privy Council, had taken several
years to work themselves out. Seeing
that the Malaysian delay had caused
complications the Singaporeans avoided
any procrastination whatsoever—but
still bought trouble. As is its habit, the
Lee Kuan Yew Government, by stick-
ing too firmly to its “rationality,”
stimulated neither tranquillity nor
optimism. Neither Lee nor any of the
other Singapore leaders showed any
appreciation—unlike Malaysia’s Tunku
Abdul Rahman that magnanimity in
politics is sometimes the truest wisdom.
So representations for clemency from
the Indonesian Consul-General in
Singapore were refused even though
commutation to life imprisonment was
all that was requested. Worse, much
worse, Indonesian President Suharto’s
personal envoy was similarly rebuffed,
not to mention the personal pleas of
the Tunku and his deputy Tun Razak,
who were mindful of Malaysia’s own
communal situation and of general
regional relations.
Resolutely and rationally, the hang-
ings of the two Indonesians went ahead
on schedule, thus provoking the pre-
dictably irrational and overemotional
Indonesian response. In Indonesia the
two hanged men were dubbed national
heroes, and while the Singapore Gov-
ernment refused permission for a pro-
jected lying-in-state at the Indonesian
Embassy in Singapore, it yet allowed
the bodies to be returned to Djakarta,
there to assume the halo of martyrdom.
A five-mile heroes’ funeral was
accompanied by the kind of vandalism
which the Indonesians have helped
elevate into virtually a diplomatic
technique. Students sacked the Singa-
pore Embassy and the residences of
the Embassy staff. Marines went
searching for the Singapore Ambassador
with intent to kill him and the Ambas-
sador was taken into what was virtually
protective custody. It is perhaps less
relevant to point out that Foreign
Minister Adam Malik stood up to the
inspired demands of the students for
further action, such as the breaking
off of diplomatic relations, than to
underline that the Singapore action
forced him into such a defensive
position in the first place. Similarly
with President Suharto.
On the surface, all that the hangings
had accomplished was a rebuff which
was taken as a national insult, but
underlying it was the effect on the
Javanese shadow play. As authoritative
observers pointed out, since the hanged
men were KKO members (Indonesian
Marines) and since, because of their
earlier Communist sympathies, the
KKOs have been on the outside, the
heroes’ reception was used to enhance
the position of the KKOs and push it
back into the national mainstream. The
Marines and the Indonesian Navy are
not as firmly under President Suharto’s
control as he would like and others
might wish.
All this as well as the fact that
Confrontation memories had been need-
lessly rejuvenated and that Singapore
had equally needlessly provoked the
antipathies against itself which it is
in its long-term interest to obliterate or
at least ameliorate. One has to only ask
what would have been the effect had
Singapore obstinately acted in the
same way last July or August, when
there was tension in Malaysia? It
would have made the Tunku’s position
impossible and the Malaysian com-
munal situation that much worse. Even
now Singapore’s appearance of arro-
gance, which is the despair of its friends
and the irritant of its enemies, had
made it that much less easy for Kuala
Lumpur to be conciliatory to the
Chinese should the need arise in the
near future. Some Malay opinion, like
the Indonesians’, will obviously see the
hangings in an anti-Chinese light.
The Singapore statement justifying
its action naturally indicated no
perception of these nuances. The hang-
ings were justified in terms of the con-
demned men having caused loss of life,
whereas other Confrontation convic-
tions had been remitted when no loss
of life was involved which in turn
rather undercut Singapore Foreign
Minister Rajaratnam’s references to
upholding the rule of law. Since that
rule had been obviated in relation to
the earlier cases, it could just as easily
have been sustained on this occasion.
Nevertheless, there remains very little
to be said for the way the Indonesians
played it. By quickly threatening what
they would do if the men were hanged
they gave commutation the appearance
of backing down under pressure. At a
time when Djakarta might have been
more profitably engaged in putting
public pressure on the Filipinos it
acted in such a way as to arouse the
regional antipathies which are the
antithesis of ASEAN. Just to under-
line how much the introvert Indo-
nesians expect to have their nationalist
cake and eat it, too, Russian pleas for
clemency for five Communist leaders
due to be shot soon were brushed aside


by President Suharto and otherwise
rejected as a national insult and an
unwarranted interference in Indo-
nesian internal affairs.
With similar disregard for even
minimal consistency, the week saw the
Filipinos once again insisting upon
ministerial summit talks of a kind that
disregarded Malaysian sovereignty over
Sabah. As a result and perhaps
mercifully the projected Tokyo talks
and the hopes of some new cooling-
off period did not even get to first
base. Mercifully, because with Foreign
Secretary Ramos forced to insist at
the U.N. General Assembly that the
Philippines could not recognise the
power, competence, and authority of
the Malaysian Government to speak
for Sabah in a week when Sabah
members of the Malaysian Parliament
made more interventions in a debate
on the Sabah issue than they have
done in any other debate so far
there loomed only the prospect that
the talks would inevitably fail and
thereby make matters distinctly worse.
VIETNAM
THE BREAK-THROUGH?
THE UNITED STATES appeared
at the beginning of this week to be on
the brink of announcing a total bomb-
ing halt over North Vietnam and it
was also thought possible in Washington
that a total cease-fire could now be in
sight.
Although hopes for a bombing
pause, which were raised early on
Saturday by a news agency report
from Saigon that North Vietnam had
already agreed to begin substantive
peace negotiations, were dashed when
the message proved to be without foun-
dation, there was a general belief in
Washington that the long-awaited
breakthrough in the Paris talks could
now only be a matter of days, if not
hours.
One particularly encouraging sign
was seen in the Pentagon’s estimate—
known to have been passed to the
White House that 30,000 to 40,000
North Vietnamese troops (of elements
of five regular divisions) had been
withdrawn from South Vietnam in the
past few weeks.
This official admission was gener-
ally taken as lending a special meaning
to the Administration’s reiterated posi-
tion that there had been no word from
Hanoi in reply to the package offer
that, it was now admitted, President
Johnson had made to stop the bomb-
ing. At least some administration
officials were ready to concede that
Hanoi’s answer could come by de
facto actions as much as by public
statements.
No Government source was prepared
even privately to confirm that a cease-
fire was what the diplomatic flurry of
the past few days had really been
about. But recent comings and goings
including Mr. Cyrus Vance’s sur-
Hanoi’s chief negotiator at the Paris
peace talks, Xuan Thuy
prise visit to Washington a week ago
and Le Due Tho’s sudden flight to
Hanoi via Moscow had necessarily
suggested that the prize at issue might
be greater than simply a consent by the
U.S. to meet what had always been
North Vietnam’s precondition for any
serious negotiations in Paris.
The only man to have referred
directly to the prospect of a cease-fire
remained Senator Edmund Muskie, the
Democratic Party’s Vice-Presidential
candidate in the election. But his words
certainly had sufficient impact on Mr.
Richard Nixon, the Republican candi-
date for the Presidency, for him to
announce that the Vietnam War was
one which “we all trust can be brought
to a conclusion, an honorable conclu-
sion, before the next President takes
office.”
State Department officials believed it
was immaculate timing by Mr. Johnson
to let it be known ten days earlier that
he had finally abandoned hope of a
settlement before he left office. They
believe that Hanoi had become con-
vinced that Mr. Nixon would win the
election, and that this led to Mr.
Xuan Thuy’s statement from Paris that
Mr. Johnson still had the time and
power to solve the Vietnam problem
peacefully.
THE PRESIDENCY
STAGNANT CAMPAIGN
AS THE PRESIDENTIAL election
entered its last fortnight, both Mr.
Richard Nixon and Vice-President
Humphrey intensified their campaign-
ing efforts. More flights, more crowds
to greet at more airports, more motor-
cades in and out of more cities, more
speeches and dinners, more applause
and more hecklers await the two princi-
pal contenders. But their efforts, so
similar to look at, are different in kind.
Mr. Nixon was well ahead when the
campaign opened in early September,
he is well ahead now, and, unless some-
thing very odd happens, he will be
ahead when the votes are counted on
the night of November 5. It is not for
him to stir up excitement; it could do
him no good. His battle was won before
the champions formally took the field
against each other at all. His speeches
are the muffled drum that beats in Act
V while the dead are buried, the
wounded brought in, and the prisoners
counted.
It is for Mr Humphrey to change
the trend if he can. A Gallup poll in
early September gave Mr. Humphrey
the support of 31 percent of a sample
of the voters, compared with Mr.
Nixon’s 43 percent. By the end of the
month Mr. Humphrey was getting 29
percent and Mr. Nixon 44 percent. Mr.
George Wallace, the third-party can-
didate, went up from 19 to 21 percent
and down again to 20 percent in the
same month, while the proportion of
undecided voters did not change. This
stagnation of electoral feeling is a con-
trast to the volatility of a few months
ago when the parties were- fighting it
out within their own ranks and the
public was beginning to grasp the
possibilities of change. It serves Mr.
Nixon’s interest and is death to Mr.
Humphrey unless he can shake it.
Thus Mr. Humphrey’s efforts have
met with no success so far. Given the
circumstances in which he was nom-
inated, it is not easy to say how he
could have done better. He is hemmed
in by his association with the unpopular
outgoing Administration. Once he de-
cided to stay in office while seeking the
Presidency, his efforts to escape from
that association were probably bound
to be tardy and ineffectual, as they have
been. It is true that better management
of the Democratic National Convention
in Chicago might have eased his
dilemma and that, had he been bolder,
he could probably have intervened to
some effect to steer the convention in
such a way as to mitigate the factional
bitterness that is one of his difficulties
now. But the Democratic Party would
still have been left divided, and Demo-
cratic office-seekers in many districts
would still have had more reason to
steer clear of Mr. Johnson’s Vice-
President than to rally to him.
More than the other candidates, the
Vice-President is saddled with the
Vietnam War and compelled to adopt a
coherent policy about it. After wasting
some weeks in false starts and down-
right errors he did, in a television
address in September, produce a con-
sidered position that was distinct from,
while not exactly in contradiction to r
President Johnson’s own. This was
shortly after Mr. George Ball resigned
as American representative at the
United Nations to support Mr.
Humphrey in his campaign; Mr. Ball
in fact helped with the television
address and with careful political
preparations that were made for it.
Evidently (for he did soon afterwards
speak up for Mr. Humphrey in a
vigorous partisan broadcast) the


President was one of those who were
won round to accepting that Mr.
Humphrey could take a position of his
own about the bombing of North Viet-
nam without damaging the Administra-
tion’s own efforts. Another who was
won round was Mr. Averell Harriman,
in charge of the talks with the North
Vietnamese in Paris: when Mr. Nixon
answered the speech with the predict-
able charge that Mr. Humphrey was
interfering with the Paris talks, Mr.
Harriman was ready with a statement
in Mr. Humphrey’s defence.
None of the other Presidential candi-
dates has done better than Mr.
Humphrey. Mr. Nixon would bring
about an honorable peace, never mind
how. Mr. George Wallace would try to
negotiate, but if that failed would set
about winning the war. Still, the truth
probably remains that it is on Mr.
Humphrey, and not on them, that the
burden of the unpopularity of the war
falls in the minds of the voters.
The further truth is that the
campaign reveals the American people
in an inward-looking frame of mind;
they are not really interested in any

foreign issue, not even Vietnam. Mr.
Nixon draws attention to the
deficiencies, failures, and half-successes
of the past two Administrations in
foreign policy and defence — their
“neglect” of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, their “inattention” to the
existence of a Communist regime in
Cuba. He expresses concern about
Soviet naval strength and insists that
the United States must have a clear
superiority in nuclear .missiles in order
to negotiate for disarmament. Mr.
Humphrey talks less of rearmament
and more of negotiations, summit
meetings, and strengthening the United
Nations. These are differences of
emphasis, not head-on collisions, and
they excite little response from
audiences.
The response is reserved for
domestic ills. Two of the candidates,
Mr. Nixon and Mr. Wallace, have been
making hay with the issue of crime and
violence in the streets, to a point at
which even Mr. Humphrey was forced
to join in with a proposal to increase
tenfold the Federal grants under the
Safe Streets Act for the improvement
of police forces. “We cannot build a
just society in the midst of violence,”
declared Mr. Humphrey. Still, it is he,
and the Democratic Vice-Presidential
candidate, Senator Muskie, who insist
that mere repression is not the answer
and that crime and poverty are related
to each other.
Mr. Nixon, for. his part, is not
particularly repressive when he comes
to formulate actual proposals as he
did last month with a rather elaborate
scheme for a new national council, an
academy of law enforcement, town hall
conferences, a co-ordinating centre, and
so on. It is the rhetorical exploitation
of crime that suggests a spirit of
repression and feeds the demand for
repression in the audiences —a demand
that is flourishing already, without any
need of extra fuel from the politicians.
“One of the crime capitals of the
world” is Mr. Nixon’s phrase for the
city of Washington; if one tries to give
the phrase any specific meaning at all,
it is at once seen to be untrue and one
wonders how Mr. Nixon proposes to
live with it once he is, as seems likely,
President.
Lawlessness and disorder are associ-
ated in most American minds with
race: race migrations are associated
with the troubled state of the cities,
with the malaise of the school system,
with fluctuating property values, and
with threats to the pride and security
of white trade unionists. People who
worry about these things are also
worried and resentful about rising
P nce s and falling money values facts
accentuate the widespread un-
easiness about instability and change.
A th « ad leads from, one subject to
the other, sometimes in reality, some-
times merely in the mind of a public
brought up on Puritan values, which it
now sees as crumbling. How far such
associations of ideas and images will
enter into policy-making in the next
Administration is, of course, guesswork;
probably not as far as, to listen to the
campaign speeches, one would suppose.
But they do enter richly into the cam-
paigning speeches; strong police work,
a new and resolute Attorney-General,
less interference with neighborhood
schools, a return to fiscal conservatism,
work instead of welfare these ideas
are allotted their place in the utter-
ances of Mr. Nixon, are indulged a
shade more freely in those of his
running-mate, Governor Agnew, and
luxuriate unchecked in the far livelier,
racier speeches of Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Muskie can-
not exactly take the field against order,
stability, and thrift, but they also can-
not well concede that the past eight
years of bold Federal spending,
economic expansion, and throbbing
social change have been wrong or
wasted. For Mr. Humphrey an obvious
answer was to seek a debate with Mr.
Nixon in which the various competing,
rather than contradictory, notions of
public policy could be rubbed against
one another and tested. Mr. Nixon’s
advisers had no difficulty in seeing
that a long debate between the two
on television could only help Mr.
Humphrey and might well damage Mr.
Nixon. Thus the question of a television
debate has been made into a campaign
issue itself.
Another rather specialised campaign
issue, and one for which Mr. Nixon
has himself to thank, has arisen around
the choice of Vice-Presidential candi-
dates by the two leaders or, rather,
the three leaders, since Mr. George
Wallace selected General Curtis
LeMay to run with him. Senator
Muskie, Mr. Humphrey’s choice, is the
one candidate to have improved his
political reputation in the course of
the Presidential campaign so far.
Governor Agnew is proving no help to
Mr. Nixon. It is no slur on General
LeMay to say that he is no Talley-
rand, more of a Marshal Ney: his
interest is in securing a future for the
manned bomber (in which he made
his own reputation a quarter of a
century ago), and what he is doing in
politics is a mystery. However, what
he was actually doing in politics last
week was visiting Vietnam on a “fact-
finding mission” for Mr. Wallace, who
did not take long to see that the
General would be less of a liability
on a foreign field than on the television
screens at home.
THE U.S.: RACE
NEGRO ANTI-SEMITISM
NEGRO-JEWISH PREJUDICE has
become an ugly new fact of life in New
York. Smouldering for some time, it
flared through the latest strike of city
teachers the third in six weeks
which is continuing to deprive a million
children of basic education.
Issues in the strike are political,
racial, and complicated, and they tend
to shift daily. But through them all one


thing remains constant: the growing
antipathy between Negroes and Jews.
For years New York’s Jews have
been among the most liberal benefac-
tors of other ethnic groups suffering
racial discrimination, and they are hurt,
dismayed, and angered by the way
Negroes are turning on them now. So
strong are their feelings that, against
the appeals of a presiding rabbi, an
audience of 2090 middle-class Brook-
lyn Jews so heckled Mayor John
Lindsay last week when he attempted
to address them about the school crisis,
that the Mayor had to leave the
synagogue by a fire escape. (The
Mayor, in the opinion of many Jews,
is guilty of appeasement toward Negro
demands that they should run their
own schools, to the detriment of Jewish
teachers.)
The Negro-Jewish prejudice has
come to a head in the school system
because it is there that the statistics
are most heavily weighted. Of the eight
million people who live in New York
City, some 15 percent are colored
(Negro or Puerto Rican) and some
30 percent are Jewish. But in elemen-
tary and high schools, the proportion
of colored children is about 55 percent,
while between 60 and 70 percent of
teachers are Jews.
The reason for the preponderance
of colored children is the continuing
migration of Negroes from the Deep
South, coupled with the steady migra-
tion of middle-class whites from the
city to the outer suburbs. The reason
for the preponderance of Jewish
teachers goes further back in time.
Most of these teachers are middle-
aged, the children of poor European
immigrants. They grew up in the same
slums the Negroes now occupy. They,
too, knew poverty and prejudice. Many
of them worked their way through
college, graduating at the time of the
Depression, when they had to face not
only nationwide mass unemployment
but also racial discrimination.
Only in government jobs could they
be sure of equal opportunity. So, in
New York, thousands of them turned
to teaching. Now they form the bulk
of the profession men and women
with 20 and 30 years of class-room
experience behind them and much to
lose if there is a continuing trend to-
ward Negroes controlling their own
school districts.
An outsider might expect to find a
bond between New York’s poor
immigrants of the last generation and
the colored immigrants of this. Indeed,
the city’s leading Jewish organisations
have done what they can to foster it.
But history and color are against them.
In general, lacking the ambition,
application, and opportunities of the
Jews, the Negroes know it is only a
tiny minority of their race who will
become the next generation’s teachers.
Lacking the whiteness of skin, they
also know that they can never be so
easily assimilated. This may partly
explain their apparent hatred of the
Jew because he is the white man
they know so much about, yet can
never emulate. Perhaps, too, because he
is so like them and so different.
There is one factor. Most of the
immigrant generation of Jews earned
their living either in the garment
industry (which explains the strong
trade union support among the present
teachers), or they opened little family
businesses in their own neighborhoods.
Businesses have since passed into the
hands of their children, who have been
able to better themselves, moving out
to pleasanter suburbs. But their
livelihood has remained in what are
now Negro slums.
Because of current racial tensions,
most of the Jewish shopkeepers and
landlords would love to sell their
businesses to Negroes, but, economi-
cally, they are stuck. So, in race riots
of recent years, they have been the
earliest victims 1 — representing, in the
Negro mind, the white man who
exploits them.
Of the shopkeepers in Harlem and
Mayor Lindsay ...many Jews accuse
him of appeasement of Negroes
similar neighborhoods, it is estimated
that between 30 and 40 percent are
white, and almost all of these are
Jewish. When violence erupts, it is their
windows which are broken first, their
property which is looted.
The ugliest demonstration of the
teachers’ strike happened outside the
Manhattan offices of the United
Federation of Teachers when a group of
Negro and Puerto Rican demonstrators
carried a black-draped coffin with two
menorahs (Jewish candelabras) on top.
Jewish outrage was compounded when
one of the leaders of the demonstration
was appointed to membership of the
Board of Education another of the
reasons why the Mayor was heckled in
the synagogue last week.
So far, New York Jewish organisa-
tions have refrained from comment. An
official of one said privately: “This is
an extremely sensitive issue and we are
still debating how to handle it. But
there is no doubt where our feelings
lie.”
THE SOUTH PACIFIC
OLD COLONIAL WAYS
THE EIGHTH conference of the South
Pacific Commission in Noumea last
week brought forth the rhetoric of self-
determination without much movement
in the direction of letting island mem-
bers have a greater say in their future.
Fijian Chief Minister Ratu Maru
called once more for increased island
territories’ participation in the Com-
mission’s activities. A speech by him at
an earlier conference had led to the
annual conference, which replaced the
triennial get-togethers of the 18 terri-
tories which, when the Commission was
set up in 1947, were under the control
of France, United States, Great Britain,
Australia, and New Zealand.
Ratu Maru this year reiterated his
old complaint: “I am irked that the
Commissioners representing the metro-
politan powers should decide mv
people’s and my destiny without my
having a say in it.”
This year, as before, the obvious
French opposition to self-determination
for the island territories, which has
persisted for the 21 years of the South
Pacific Commission, forced Ratu Maru
and his sympathisers to compromise or
risk wrecking the Commission. France’s
Senior Commissioner, M. Nettre, said
that the French Government does not
feel that there should be continual
change in the South Pacific Commission.
Whatever satisfaction Ratu Maru,
who wants self-determination outside
but not inside Fiji, may have got from
considerable support from Tonga and
the Cooks, and from qualified Samoan
support, there is by no means universal
Pacific Island disenchantment with
colonial status.
France’s colonies in the South Pacific
found only one issue on which to dis-
agree with France —whether a coconut
pest, the rhinoceros beetle—should
continue to be a South Pacific Com-
mission research project.
America’s rich territories (rich
because they are American) were not
willing to discuss the future of the
South Pacific Commission in Maru’s
terms. Greater self-determination
seemed academic to the delegates from
Papua-New Guinea. Australia has
always paid the largest share of the
South Pacific Commission budget at
32 percent, but she gets less direct
return from it. The Commission’s work
and technical assistance projects are
more, relevant to the smaller islands.
However, the Australian Government
keeps its finger in the South Pacific
pie. Its trade links with Nauru, New
Caledonia, and Fiji are solid reminders
that the few hundred thousand dollars
provided to the South Pacific Com-
mission are small by contrast with the
size of her present and future benefits.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
Jackie Kennedy...bride of the year
THE END OF THE
KENNEDY CLAN
THE WEDDING of Mrs. Jackie
Kennedy to Greek shipping millionaire
Aristotle Onassis is the beginning of
a new life for her; it marks the end
of the Kennedy clan as part of the
mystique of American life and prob-
ably, too, as a political force. If
Senator Edward Kennedy has been
looking forward, even vaguely, to the
Presidential race of 1972 he will be
very much a lone runner.
Many people who normally would
regard remarriage, even for someone
in Jacqueline Kennedy’s position, as a
private affair, might frown over her
choice. Aristotle Onassis today repre-
sents perhaps the world’s most out-
standing surviving symbol of unlimited
wealth without responsibility. The
Kennedys are rich, but they are rich
in a relatively rich country and their
wealth, accumulated at least at the
respectable distance of a generation
ago, has been tied to simple living and,
with John and Robert Kennedy, used
to gain political power with the object
of securing reforms.
Onassis is rich in a very poor country
and the smell of money still clings to
him. It may now seem to many people
that basically Jacqueline Kennedy’s life
with the Kennedy clan was an aber-
ration from her accepted standards
and that she is now returning to the
life which seems normal and desirable
to her, however anachronistic it seems
to others.
That may be harsh. It must be
acknowledged that Mrs. Kennedy’s
marriage will give her one thing she is
fully entitled to and which she has not
been able to get in the democratic
society of her native country: utter
privacy and full security.
After the President’s assassination
Mrs. Kennedy was forced to give up
her home in suburban Georgetown, out-
side Washington, because of the
omnipresent tourists and sightseers.
Life in a luxury flat on Fifth Avenue
was not much better.
The leading newspaper of the cloth-
ing industry, “Women’s Wear Daily,”
maintained a 24-hour watch on her
apartment and photographed her every
change of dress—an extremely demand-
ing job, since she spends upward of
$50,000 a year to keep abreast of
fashion. She received many threats
against the life and safety of Caroline
and John jun. Her new husband,
owner of islands, yachts, shipping, and
airlines, can at least give her a life
of regal serenity and seclusion.
A SPACE CHRISTMAS
AS APOLLO 7 was orbiting the earth
last week, jubilant American space
officials were hoping to give the
country a Christmas present of a moon
orbit by a manned spaceship. Apollo 8,
with three astronauts — Air Force
Colonel Frank Borman, Navy Captain
James Lovell, and Air Force Major
William Anders — will probably be
put into lunar orbit about December 20,
when earth and moon are close together.
Apollo 8 is scheduled to spend a full
day in orbit 70 miles above the moon
but will not attempt a landing.
NASA headquarters, at Houston,
expect the Russians to attempt a
lunar orbit, either manned or unmanned,
in the near future, before the scheduled
Apollo 8 flight. The successes of Apollo
7, with three astronauts commanded by
Navy Captain Walter Schirra, restored
American prestige and hopes in the
lunar race with Russia.
Realistically, U.S. space officials
recognised, in retrospect, that Apollo 7
achievements were a direct consequence
of the tragic fire which killed three
astronauts at the launching pad on
Cape Kennedy in January, 1967. That
tragedy, it was pointed out, led to the
complete rethinking of the U.S. space
program and produced new procedures.
One of the most interesting and sig-
nificant results of the Apollo 7 flight
was the unexpectedly clear television
broadcasts to earth from the spaceship.
This development indicated that trans-
mission from spacecraft will have far
more serious military and economic
values in future.
The Department of Defence has
already developed an airborne TV sys-
tem for monitoring movements of troops
and vehicles at night with cameras
aboard planes. A TV camera will also
be carried aboard the Manned Orbital
Workshop, the scientific project that is
part of the Apollo Application Program,
to go into effect when astronauts land
on the moon. NASA has plans to use
TV to survey geological and agricul-
tural resources of the earth from space-
craft. Television cameras will be carried
aboard the Manned Orbiting Labora-
tory, which the Air Force hopes to
place in orbit in the early 1970s.
Another Air Force satellite, the
Samos, carries still cameras that photo-
graph foreign military installations,
including Russian and Chinese, and can
provide high-quality photographs with
details as small as 1ft. in diameter.
Terrain photography also will be con-
ducted on the Manned Orbital Work-
shop, which will have four cameras
taking pictures of the same place on
eaith through different filters and
sensors. These enable cameras to pene-
tiate cloud cover or detect temperature
variations on the ground.
Cameras of this type have already
detected sources of water pollution and
emission of warm water springs not
previously known to exist. They can
detect soils in remote areas suitable for
growing certain crops. The Earth
Resources Program of NASA will
attempt to determine growing seasons
of cei tain plants in specific areas with
airborne cameras as an aid to agricul-
ture in under-developed countries. This
program also includes prospecting for
minerals and similar kinds of geological
surveys. Pictures can be made of geo-
logical formations and types of rocks
and matched with photos of other areas
known to be worth commercial exploi-
tation. Similarly, detection of new
fishing areas and new sources of ground
water is potentially possible through
photography from planes and
spacecraft.
The medical directors of the Manned
Spacecraft Centre in Houston were
intrigued by the head colds suffered
by all three astronauts. They have long
feaied that ordinary benign germs
might mutate and become virulent on
space flights of greater duration than
this one, for instance when the Manned
Orbiting Laboratory is sent aloft for 30
days in the 1970s.
Experience in space flight indicates,
the medical authorities commented,
that infectious diseases represent “an
aiea of potentially serious concern for
the health of astronauts, through risk of
mutation and lowered resistance to
bacterial infection.” Danger of pneu-
monia was a real threat to future
astronauts, they emphasised.
THE DUTCH BUTT IN
AROUSED CITIZENS of the Nether-
lands, who consider the Presidency of
the United States “the most powerful
position in the world,” have been send-
ing cards to the “New York Times”
in an attempt to influence the
November 5 election. More than 850
cards have been received in the New
York headquarters of the “Times,”
overwhelmingly favoring U.S. with-
drawal from Vietnam even if that
meant a Communist victory.
The cards were distributed by a
Dutch group called Action Precedent,
which has been holding mock elections
in various parts of the Netherlands to
enable people to express a preference


for the next U.S. President. At a typical
election 51 selected Senator Eugene
McCarthy, who lost the Democratic
candidacy, six chose Vice-President
Hubert Humphrey who won it, and
three supported Republican candidate
Richard Nixon. No one chose George
Wallace.
Hendrik Jan Diekerhof, a retired
Army chaplain who founded Action
Precedent, claims “the U.S. President
meddles in our affairs, we should
meddle in his.” Diekerhof adds: “The
American electorate is one and one-half
percent of the world population and
it is unacceptable that they decide who
shall be the most powerful man in
the world, who decides for us in matters
of war and peace, racial relations, and
the fight against poverty. We want to
create precedent by interfering in the
U.S. elections.”
Action Precedent is holding a large-
scale mock election late this month, in
which more than 4000 people in 13
Dutch towns will be asked their opinions
on international affairs as well as their
preference for U.S. President.
Gallup ... four percent error?
HARD ONE TO PICK
PROFESSIONAL POLLSTERS them-
selves were in agreement that there was
a greater chance this year for error in
the Presidential election than at any
time since 1948, when they picked
Thomas Dewey instead of Harry
Truman as the winner.
All polls showed Richard Nixon sub-
stantially leading Hubert Humphrey
and George Wallace with less than a
fortnight to go before election day,
November 5. But Louis Bean, a well-
known political analyst (who correctly
predicted the Truman victory of 1948
as well as the extremely close win of
John Kennedy over Nixon in 1960),
expressed doubt that the national polls
accurately reflected the relative stand-
ings of the candidates. The election
was actually much closer than the polls
indicated, Bean said, but he refrained
from predicting the winner.
Several factors caused uneasiness
among the pollsters. First, many people
were refusing to be interviewed by poll-
takers this year, and accurate allocation
of their votes was impossible. Second,
a noticeable lack of widespread
enthusiasm for any of the three candi-
dates probably meant many last-minute
switches. Third, the presence of Wallace
in the race made questionable the
accuracy of polling techniques developed
in the past for two-candidate races.
One pollster, Albert Sindlinger, said
frankly, “I think the polls could be
wrong this year,” largely because it
was impossible to assess the strength of
George Wallace accurately. A large
vote for Wallace could adversely affect
either of the other two candidates.
Louis Harris and Dr. George Gallup,
the country’s two leading public-opinion
poll-takers, were less dubious about the
accuracy of their findings. Harris said:
“Polls have been wrong in the past and
they will be wrong in future—and this
may be the year. But there is a better
than 90 percent chance that they are
right.” Gallup recalled that his polls
had averaged an error of only 1J per-
centage points on the size of the win-
ning party’s vote in national elections
since 1954. However, Gallup conceded
he would be “lucky” if the poll held
the error percentage to within four
points this year.
Political observers pointed out that a
four-point error was actually a difference
of eight points, since four points are
taken away from one candidate and
given to another. Inasmuch as the latest
Harris Poll gave an eight-point edge to
Nixon —39 percent for Nixon to 31 for
Humphrey—the outcome of that poll
could prove to be wrong.
RICHES FROM CROESUS
THE WORKSHOP WHERE Croesus
refined gold in the sixth century has
been uncovered by an American univer-
sity expedition in Turkey. Harvard
University announced that a joint
Harvard-Cornell expedition made the
discovery earlier this year, after 11
years of digging at Sardis, fabulous,
city of the wealthy Lydian Empire
ruled by Croesus before he was
conquered by Cyrus.
The archeologists found bits of gold
at the scene, as well as portions of
crucibles, blowpipe nozzles, and other
apparatus. The scene is near the
Pactolus Torrent, which ancient histor-
ians described as rich in gold-bearing
sands. The Americans also found more
than 300 small clay basins in which
gold had been refined from lead ore
by concentrating intense flame through
blowpipes. They also found furnaces in
which silver may have been separated
from gold. The expedition worked
closely with the Turkish Department of
Antiquities and with Turkish scholars.
REDWOODS SAVED
SOME OF THE tallest and most
ancient redwood trees in northern
California will be preserved with a new
58,000-acre national park just approved
by Congress. The park’s creation is a
tremendous victory for conservationists:
it is almost 13,000 acres bigger than the
park which the Johnson Administration
has been pleading with Congress to
establish since 1965. The controversy
over these great old trees has been
fierce. The powerful timber industry
in California has fought every inch of
the way against surrendering its red-
woods; there was local opposition to
the park as well, stimulated by fears
of the unemployment and tax losses
that might follow a curtailment of
timber-cutting.
The Redwood National Park Act
contains a novel new method of
acquiring private land for public use.
From the moment that the Bill became
law, the land designated as parkland
became the Federal Government’s
property. There will be compensation
for private-property owners, in land
or in money, but only later. First they
must negotiate with the Department of
the Interior or take their cases to the
Court of Claims. Highly controversial,
this method should none the less pre-
vent the sharp rise in prices that has
tended to occur between Congress’
authorisation of a park and the actual
appropriation of money for the
purchase.
Originally most of the park was to
be in Del Norte County, and cutting
of timber in proposed park areas was
stopped two years ago. But then, to
relieve the economic burdens on that
county and the Rellim Redwood
Company, which would have been
hardest hit, the park’s boundaries were
redrawn to include more of Humboldt
County, where some of the tallest
trees are. The line was then drawn in
almost to the coastline to skirt the
Northern Purchase Unit, owned by the
Federal Government, which contains
many redwoods. Land from this and
other Federal reserves will go to timber
companies in compensation for their
property taken for the park. This form
of barter is to the Secretary of Agri-
culture, “a most dangerous precedent.”
Congress hoped that the State of Cali-
fornia would donate its State parks to
the new Federal park but it will not
be forced to do so.
Whether its inspiration is seasonal or
political, Congress has pushed through
conservation measures at white-heat.
There is to be an enormous new North
Cascades National Park in northern
Washington along the Canadian border.
A region of snow-capped mountains
and glaciers, it was first recommended
as a national park in 1906, but pressure
from timber and mining interests has
prevented its establishment until now.
Congress has also added 620,000 acres
of Federal property to the National
Wilderness System set up in 1964. Most
of this acreage lies in the west, but it
includes the Great Swamp Wildlife
Refuge in New Jersey, once proposed
as a site for New York’s fourth airport.
A Bill to preserve a number of rivers
in their natural state has been passed
and so has another establishing a
nation-wide system of trails near cities
as well as in remote areas.

THE COMMONWEALTH I ULSTER
Discord in the Londonderry air
THE SCENES OF riot in Londonderry
recently were thoroughly nasty. To
many English people, who do not norm-
ally follow what goes on in the rest of
the United Kingdom, they were shock-
ing. But they were not tragic. Nobody
was killed. Nobody in the total casualty
list —of about 70 civilians, eight police-
men, and one fireman—was even very
badly injured. It is only 18 months
since the last political murders took
place in the province of Northern
Ireland, with rather less publicity: three
Catholic boys were shot on a Belfast
street corner by “loyalist” thugs. The
recent day’s cuts and bruises are in
one sense a step forward. For if Belfast
is a tough place, Londonderry is some-
thing else again.
Londonderry’s electoral system is set
up to ensure that the one-third of its
inhabitants who are Protestants, and
loyal to the British Crown, will keep
control in the City Council over the
two-thirds who are Catholic and seek
unity with the Irish Republic. London-
derry’s economy is so unbalanced that
over 15 percent of its male labor force
is more or less permanently unem-
ployed. These facts alone might be
taken to account for the demonstrations,
and for the police counter-action. But
they do not. The demonstration was
organised outside the city, and the
police were acting on orders from
Belfast (the Royal Ulster Constabulary
is a national, not, like police authorities
in England, a local force).
Londonderry works on a curious set
of assumptions of its own, which for
most of the time ensure a sort of peace
in the city. A rigid, and openly
acknowledged, form of “separate
development” operates there. The most
populous ward (with 30,000 inhabitants
and eight councillors) is wholly
Catholic, votes solidly for various
brands of nationalism, and to a con-
siderable extent conducts its own affairs.
The other two wards (with 24,000
inhabitants and 12 councillors) have
their Catholic streets and their Protes-
tant streets; but skilful use of the
“property qualification” for local gov-
ernment elections (which can give
owners of businesses up to six votes
for each business), and disfranchisement
of Catholic lodgers who are not house-
holders, ensure that these 12 councillors
are Protestant Unionists. When it comes
to the red meat of city government,
which is the housing program, houses
do certainly get built for Catholics —
but the proportion built for them is far
less than their two-to-one majority in
the population, and their hordes of
children, would justify. Above all, hous-
ing for Catholics is crammed into the
small area where it will not upset the
great gerrymander.
Given the historic mess that London-
derry is, this grossly unjust system does
at least have the advantage of prevent-
A Londonderry rioter getting much the
worst of it
ing too-frequent direct confrontation
between the factions. Political parades
and demonstrations form a time-
honored and spectacular part of Lon-
donderry folklore. Twice a year, with
Union Jacks and drums and Orange
banners, the Protestant minority bang
through the streets to commemorate
their ancestors’ glorious victory over
the forces of Popery in 1689. On holy
days the Republican tricolor flies in the
city, followed by bands of folk-dancers
and pipers and other symbols of
resolutely non-British culture. These
manifestations of historico-political
enthusiasm (to say nothing of straight
religious bigotry, on both sides) can
take place in entire peace, so long as
they take place in the appropriate
streets.
About a month ago, the Northern
Ireland Civil Rights Association said
that it, too, wanted to have a march.
Of course, the very name of this
organisation indicates lack of support
for the Unionist government of the
province; but then it is not a pure
nationalist front organisation, either. Its
march was to be a political act, cer-
tainly; but probably not a party politi-
cal act, although some nationalist and
English Labor politicians sought to cash
in on it. Its object— triumphantly
achieved—was to attract publicity to the
evils it opposes. For this purpose, it
was eager to trail its coat. Its march
was scheduled to go into the walled
city, the heart and bastion of Ulster
Protestantism.
The Ulster authorities had good
reason to ban the march. It was not
impossible that some fanatic would
shoot at the demonstrators. There are
plenty of such fanatics in Ulster. Had
Air. Craig, the Minister for Home
Affairs, said this publicly and given
the marchers time to fix on a less
provocative route, he would have
deserved support. Instead, Mr. Craig
made a not unusual ass of himself.
He waited until the last minute before
banning it from the streets it was
tneant to follow, and doing so on a
trumped-up excuse. As an application
for police protection for a march
must be made 48 hours in advance,
this gave the organisers no chance
to reorganise their route, even had
they wanted to.
Some of the marchers, therefore,
tried to go ahead, anyway. In the
event, not a scrap of violence was
directed by civilian Protestants at the
marchers. The task was taken up
with a will by uniformed members
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The Ulster police, as well as wearing
huge guns (and no numbers, so they
cannot be easily identified), carry
huge clubs. They used them with
energy after the fashion of other
Irishmen down the Edgware Road
late of a Saturday night. They also
used some mobile water-cannon to
disperse the crowd: some people have
expressed disgust at this, but water
really does seem better than bludgeons.
The real sorrow is that this well-
televised fracas should have broken
out now. After long years of the
higher lunacy, faint glim,mers of
reason and progress had begun to
come to Londonderry. The Ulster
Government has succeeded in attract-
ing some new industrial development
to the area. A start has been made
on preparing a comprehensive plan for
the area’s development: a plan which
would imply recasting the local elec-
toral boundaries so as to do away with
the worst effects of the gerrymander-
ing. Much of the credit for this
beginning, however timid, lies with
the Prime Minister of Northern
Ireland, Captain Terence O’Neill.
Whatever his private thoughts, Cap-
tain O’Neill cannot publicly say that
his Cabinet colleague Mr. Craig and
the Ulster police made a blunder.
Pie cannot easily agree to a commission
of inquiry into the events, which
would probably say the same thing.
In a rational country the men who
blundered would have to take the
blame. Ulster is not a rational country.
Since the riots, extremists of all faiths
have demonstrated that. The Reverend
lan Paisley and his enthusiasts for
a warped Protestant religion made a
display of themselves in Belfast; this
time both liberal demonstrators and
police behaved very well. A new and
potentially even more explosive
Nationalist demonstration may occur
in Londonderry. Extremism is catch-
ing. Ulster desperately needs a leader
who can hold as many people as
possible to middle-of-the-road opinions,
in a province where roads run far
more twistedly than in Britain. Since
two-thirds of its inhabitants are
Protestants, the leader must be of that
religion. By far the. best middle-of-
the-road Protestant politician on the


horizon is Captain O’Neill. A large
majority of Protestants, and a surpris-
ing number of Catholics, know they
can rely on him for straight dealing
and steady, if slow, progress toward
reason, decency, and moderate
economic good sense.
The constitutional convention is
that the Imperial government (as
Ulstermen so quaintly call Westminster)
keeps its nose out of Ulster’s internal
affairs. If that convention were openly
broken by Mr. Wilson’s Government,
Captain O’Neill could hardly stay in
office. His successor would not be a
more liberal man; far from it. And
there are means of persuasion open
to Britain beyond those of overt inter-
ference in Ulster’s affairs. The British
Government can make it covertly plain
to the hard-line Unionists that British
public opinion will not stand for intran-
sigence, or gross incompetence, in
Ulster: that if there is a switch toward
less-democratic tendencies in policy
and a lack of discipline by a group of
policemen should not count as a ten-
dency of policy then the necessary
millions for motorways and other
desirable luxuries will not go on
flowing across from one Treasury to the
other. And the Londonderry debacle
has at least the merit that, while
damaging several reputations in the
Ulster Cabinet, it has so far left
Captain O’Neill’s relatively unscathed.
THE COMMONWEALTH II—CANADA
Trudeau plays it very dull
THE IMPORTANT fact in Ottawa
still is the personality of Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and he is still an enigma.
Six months after becoming Prime
Minister, he is solidly established with
a comfortable majority. Since Parlia-
ment opened in September, there have
been no big crises, and Trudeau is
picking his way cautiously. The opinion
polls show the public is prepared to
wait and see where Trudeau takes
them.
The ,mood of the country is strikingly
different from what it was only two
years ago. Expo 67 gave Canadians
a new confidence and awareness of
the great technological changes around
them. For instance, they are beginning
to realise that they need far more and
far better education, more intelligent
planning of the society as a whole, and
more competent politicians. The
changing times are illustrated by the
retirement announcements of two
provincial premiers Ernest Manning,
of Alberta, and Joey Smallwood, of
Newfoundland. Manning, a Baptist
preacher in the heart of Canada’s Bible
Belt, hinted that he felt out of touch
with the public after 25 years in office.
Smallwood’s wheeler-dealer, demagogic
politics seemed out of date in rapidly
changing Newfoundland.
Even the sudden death of Quebec’s
Premier Daniel Johnson may be part
of the slow death of an era. At no
time did his Party, the Union
Nationale, have any political phil-
osophy comparable to the Socialists, or
even the Liberals it has always
been a rural-based, loosely organised
coalition of oddly assorted protest
elements. Johnson was the ideal leader
of such a Party. Clever, witty, and
enormously charming, he was a brilliant
opportunist. Unhampered by any
long-ter,m policies, he was able to gain
enormous concessions from Ottawa
through threats, intrigues, and warnings
of the separatiste danger. His affaire
with de Gaulle roused Trudeau to a
peak of fury and almost severed
relations between Ottawa and Paris.
Yet, in the long run, Johnson was both
a moderate and a federalist. Regard-
less of differences, Ottawa could get
along with Johnson. His successor,
Jean-Jacques Bertrand, is even more
moderate, but it is by no means clear
whether Bertrand can hold together
the ramshackle Union Nationale
Government.
Ironically, the supple and skilful
Johnson gave Trudeau a legacy. It
was at Johnson’s funeral, in Quebec,
that Trudeau began the process of
detente with General de Gaulle by
meeting Premier Couve de Murville.
In a dull time, Ottawa’s quarrel with
Paris was over-emphasised by Govern-
ment and Press alike. The surprising
thing about Trudeau’s administration is
that very dullness. Trudeau’s Throne
speech offered no burning gospel of
refor,m, no exciting vistas of the future
not even a blueprint for the “just
society” which he advocated during the
election.
Trudeau’s financial policy preaches
retrenchment, cutbacks, and a balanced
budget. Hints of changes in Canadian
foreign policy have been almost for-
gotten. The Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia gave Canada an excuse
not to rock the boat. Generally speak-
ing, the speech from the Throne made
it clear that the Government will
launch no new and startling programs,
at least until the backlog of legislation
from the Pearson administration is
cleared up. No new social legislation
is envisaged even then it would
cost too much.
At the moment, Trudeau’s major
goal is the streamlining and modernisa-
tion of government. He has surrounded
himself with a strong tea,m of young,
bright, personal advisers. They are
impatient with both Parliament and
the Civil Service. In some respects,
the most important member of
Trudeau’s Cabinet is Donald S. Mac-
donald, President of the Privy Council.
Macdonald, a young and ambitious
MP from Toronto, is charged with
reforming Parliament. The reforms
range from the very minor to the
major. By far the most important
involve a broadening and strengthening
of the co,mmittee system. While
Canada’s all-Party committees are
not as important as the Congressional
committees in Washington, the trend
is in that direction. MPs like the
system. For one thing, committees give
both backbenchers of the governing
Party and members of the Opposition
an opportunity to play personal roles
in government. They become more
effective in Caucus and better prepared
for Cabinet responsibilities when they
come. And there is a very strong
feeling of participation. Trudeau has
also talked of changing the Cabinet
structure, establishing a British-type
inner and outer Cabinet, but this is
extremely difficult in Canada, where
regional politics loom large.
So far, the Trudeau Government
has been administrative rather than
innovatory. It is, perhaps, significant
that the Province of Quebec recently
secretly proposed constitutional reforms
which would make Canada a Federal,
congressional republic. The Federal
Trudeau...adopting a streamlining
role
Government does not favor such a
plan, which would place far too much
power in the hands of the Provinces.
But there is a definite tendency
toward some republican institutions. The
Quebec proposal was not opposed to
the monarchy, even in a republic, .as
long as a majority of the population
wanted it. Prime Minister Trudeau,
when asked about the future of the
monarchy, said he would not say
anything against an institution which
some people considered important.
With that much agreement between
Ottawa and Quebec, we may well ask
how far parliamentary and consti-
tutional “reform” will take Canada.


Japan’s revolution-the
first 100 years
By MARIUS B. JANSEN
OCTOBER 23, 1968, is the date on
which Japan will mark the centennial
of its modern transformation. On that
day 100 years ago it was announced
that the era designation would hence-
forth be “Meiji,” enlightened rule.
The regime of the Tokugawa shogun
had fallen, but the new forces grouped
around the boy emperor were still
struggling to assert control; they had
to promise and persuade, for they could
not force. Yet it was soon clear that
the Meiji Restoration was a political
overturn whose consequences for
Japanese history were incalculable.
By the end of the century it was
apparent that its significance for world
history was scarcely less great.
Despite this, the Meiji centennial is
receiving little commemorative atten-
tion in the West certainly nothing
comparable to that which was accorded
the fiftieth anniversary of the Russian
Revolution. More striking still is the
way its commemoration is surrounded
by controversy within Japan. The mass
media have not let it be forgotten,
and publishers have seized the oppor-
tunity to unloose a torrent of publi-
cations for the occasion. But important
groups of historians have organised to
oppose the manner and content of
the commemoration. A recent writer
goes so far as to bracket the centen-
nial with Okinawa as two major
political issues for 1968. The Restora-
tion seems as political and controversial
in 1968 as it was in 1868. Its events
and the recollection of those events
can tell us a good deal about the
historical present in which Japanese
live.
In 1868 Japan was disunited, poor
and weak, its people compart-
mentalised in an outworn social struc-
ture topped by an hereditary military
caste. The country was divided into
some 250 domains ruled by daimyo,
feudal lords who enjoyed degrees of
autonomy that varied with the defi-
nition of their vassalage to the shogun.
The samurai had experienced little
challenge during the two-and-a-half
centuries of peace, and their preference
for swords over more modern .means
of destruction gave the military
advantage to the few areas that had
profited from trade with Western
arms dealers after the ports were
opened in 1859. It was especially
Satsuma, Choshu, and Tosa, the great
baronies of the south-west, which
provided the core of the “imperial
troops” advancing against the Toku-
gawa vassals that still resisted in 1868.
Recent scholarship makes it clear that
developments in the Tokugawa period
had done much to prepare for Japan’s
late-19th-century modernisation through
education, bureaucratic rationalisation,
urbanisation, the development of a
central economy, and literary and
philosophic preparation for nationalist
and scientific thought. But in 1868
there were few signs of the achieve-
ments ahead. The old was collapsing,
but the new was far from clear.
The future did not inspire very
much trust. To many the warfare of
1868 seemed unnecessary and unfair.
The Restoration had begun in
October, 1867, with a request from
one of the feudal lords that the shogun
resign his powers. When he did so
in November in the full expectation
that he would be the central figure in
the new and more national Govern-
ment, he was confronted with an
abrupt demand that he surrender his
domains. From January 27, 1868, into
1869 the Tokugawa partisans were
defeated in a short civil war. Most
daimyo did their best to avoid taking
part in it because they saw it as a
private fight engineered by the south-
western lords bent on creating a new
shogunate.
The shogun’s complaints drew
sympathetic echo from some of the
foreign representatives. A. R. C.
Portman, reporting to Secretary of
State Seward from Yokohama, saw so
little principle and so much treachery
involved that he warned in March:
“The real sovereign of this country is
not the Mikado . . . neither is it
the Tycoon; . . . the ruler is the
Spirit of Evil, which appears to be
all powerful, and to control every
nobleman in this country.” With
reference to the American Minister’s
proclamation of neutrality and conse-
quent refusal to deliver the ship
Stonewall, a naval ram which had
been purchased by the shogunate, he
went on to warn that “in view of
the utter unreliability of the ruling
classes in Japan, such terrible engines
for mischief as ironclads should never
be permitted to get into their
possession . . . The supply of rifles
cannot well be stopped . . . that of
ironclads, I sincerely hope, may not
be a difficult matter, as they can
only be built in the United States,
England, and France.” The American
Minister, R. B. van Valkenburgh,
predicted that the shogun was likely
to be reappointed as first minister. He
wrote in May that “a Government
in Japan under any other than the
Mikado as chief is now an impossibility,
and it is almost equally certain
that the chief of the Tokugawa
clan will remain the most powerful
personage in this Empire.” But he
was unable to account for the shogun’s
failure to resist his enemies. He
confessed himself hampered by the
fact that “it is next to impossible to
find out with positive certainty what
is actually going on in this country”;
and described a report that the
The new East Garden of the Imperial
Palace in Tokyo, opened to mark the
centennial of the Meiji restoration
shogun would accompany the emperor
into Tokyo as “very doubtful, though
not in the least improbable.”
In retrospect the astonishing thing
about the months of 1868 is that so
much stability was maintained. Daimyo
remained in control, and taxes con-
tinued to be collected. The principal
Tokugawa families never really
contested the issue. The shogun
foreshadowed this in a document he
addressed to the foreign representatives
in January. “As to who is the
sovereign of Japan,” he admitted, “it


Commander Perry’s arrival, in

Emperor Meiji (r.),

The first

is a question on which no one in
Japan can entertain a doubt. The
Mikado is the sovereign.” But a
second reason for stability is that most
Japanese were not very much con-
cerned with what was going on. This
left those who were free to concentrate
on each other and on the foreigners.
Van Valkenburgh’s descriptions of
Tokyo stressed the perfect domestic
order that prevailed even during
periods of substantial evacuation when
fighting loomed. He reported the
feeling against the imperial troops as
“intense. Yet there appeared to be
a power somewhere to control it, as
there was no outbreak of any
kind.” In June he wrote that the
troops “levy in the name of the
Mikado contributions on the people
for their substance, and these requi-
sitions are promptly met. In other
respects they remain isolated and
exercise no authority whatever.” But
most of all he stressed the “indiffer-
ence” of the townsmen.
Indifference did not rule out respect,
or even awe. A fine example of
this in verbal and graphic imagery is
found in the emperor’s entry into
Tokyo in November, 1868. The
shogun’s capital of Edo had been
renamed on September 3, and the
emperor’s journey (an act of some
courage in the confusion of the time)
began November 4. The progress and
appearance of the procession, which
included some 3000 men, are familiar
from the famous print which shows
the phoenix-topped palanquin being
carried across Kyobashi by a swarm
of yellow-robed bearers. Formally
gowned horsemen precede and follow
it, and in the van are large numbers
of strangely dressed, rifle-bearing
soldiers. The “Japan Times” reporter
described the way the great palanquin
was carried on a fra,me that
raised it a full six feet above the
ground. Its 60 bearers, all dressed
in bright yellow silk, wore a
curious ornament of feathers at each
ear eight inches in diameter, like
two outspread fan frames placed
together . . . the effect of the group,
with the brilliant sun lighting up the
sheen of the silk and the glitter of
the lacquer, was very gorgeous and
indescribably strange, comparable to
nothing ever seen in any other part
of the world . . . [As the palanquin
approached] a great silence fell upon
the people. Far as the eye could see
on either side, the roadsides were
densely packed with the crouching
populace ... As the phoenix car . . .
with its halo of glittering attendants
came on .. . the people without order
or signal turned their faces to the earth
... no man moved or spoke for a
space, and all seemed to hold their
breath for very awe, as the mysterious
presence, on whom few are privileged
to look and live, was passing by.
It will be granted that this is not
the stuff of which modern revolutions
are made. No Lexington, no Bastille,
no Lenin; only silence. But for those
who led, the needed dynamic and
reminder of the urgency of it all had
come two days before, when the
procession passed through Kanagawa.
For 100 yards or so covered stands
had been erected there for the
Yokohama foreigners, so that they
could watch in comfort. A foreign
correspondent of that day reported
that “it was something wonderful, that
crouching crowd from whom not a
sound was heard . . . and the more
striking, as contrasting with the hum
and laughter all along the line of
foreigners . . . who expressed their
disappointment in strong language.
Many questioned whether, in fact, His
Majesty was there at all. Secondly,
the whole turnout represented such
a miserable aspect.” He thought that
the guns were old and the horses
poor; what drew awe from the
Japanese brought derision from the
foreigners.
Restoration documents and procla-
mations are full of language
emphasising the need to avoid shame
and win respect. It was just such
weakness and derision that proved the
need for refonn. And indeed nothing
happened in quite the same way
again. The emperor returned to
Kyoto and came back to Edo .the
following year, but without the same
fanfare. Such trappings were soon
among the “uncivilised customs of
former times” that had to be abolished.
Eight years later, when a Korean
embassy came to Tokyo with com-
parable pomp and dignity, another
reporter wrote that the Tokyo crowd
“laughed immoderately” at the very
things that were meant to ,be most
impressive. In a sense, the Japanese
.moved over into the covered stands
they had put up for the foreigners.
The Restoration fits few conventional
categories of social change. Like the
peasant whom the educator Fukuzawa
had to threaten with a thrashing
before he would remount his horse in
the presence of a samurai, the masses
often had to be cajoled, promised,
and threatened into the patterns of
behaviour and participation which the
modern State required. At numerous
points archaic symbolism was used
to sanction sweeping innovation. This
applies even to the selection of the
era name, for the characters “Meiji”
were selected in a Shinto ceremony
that combined mystery and majesty to
promise modernity. Throughout, the
Meiji leaders realised that it was easier
to sell a new idea by describing it
as an old one.
Already in March, 1868, an
announcement had pointed to the
diplomatic intercourse with China in
antiquity as offering a precedent for
the international society that lay
ahead. At that time navigation was
not highly advanced, so that “our
intercourse was restricted to Korea,
China, and other adjacent countries.”
But now it becomes necessary “to
adopt such measures as the ancient
constitution of the £mpire and the
public law of the world may jointly
suggest.” In April the famous Charter
Oath was phrased with the same
sweeping and skilful generality. It
would, in fact, be used again to
provide support for the changes that
followed World War 11. Its promises
of “public councils,” of “all classes”
fulfilling “just aspirations,” of abolish-
ing “uncivilised customs” of “former
times,” and of seeking knowledge
“throughout the world” portended
both tradition and change, for this
was all to the end that the “founda-
tions of the Empire” might be made
firm.
At first these promises were issued
chiefly to reassure. But they remained

The most serious rebellion against the
Meiji Government was at Kumamoto
Castle
as an outline for a program of modern-
isation that remade Japan. Within a
short time it proved that the “uncivil-
ised customs” of the past included the
divisions of feudalism which had proved
unworkable in the face of Western
imperialism. Foreign policy decisions
required a single administrative centre.
The daimyo, who were burdened with
debts, were let down by degrees until
they found themselves rewarded with
Government bonds and eligible for a
modern peerage.
With the end of decentralisation
came an end to feudal society, and
the “just aspirations” that had been
promised in the Charter Oath became
more inclusive than most had foreseen
at the time. If samurai were no longer
to rule the land, it made no sense
to support them in idleness. Their
privileges disappeared; they were first
permitted, and then ordered, to give
up their swords. Their incomes, already
modest, were changed to pensions and
then to bonds. Farmers were given
freedom of cultivation, of occupancy,
of sale, and of residence. They received
the dignity of family names. Merchants
lost their legal and social disadvan-
tages. And within a half decade
measures calling for universal
education and military service made
it certain that the commoners would
never again be as indifferent to the
political structure of their society as
they had been in 1868. Local assemblies
led to national; in 1890 a constitutional
structure was implemented to permit
a slow but steady increase in repre-
sentation and participation.
The Meiji leaders worked carefully
to develop national goals of industrial-
isation and economic growth, and their
papers reflect their determination to
affect and channel economic develop-
ment through industrialisation. They
were not easily discouraged. Kume, the
official chronicler of a mission that
sought “wisdom throughout the world”
(1871-73), learned from his travels that
Europe’s modernisation was of fairly
recent date. “If,” he wrote, “you com-
pare the Europe of today with the
Europe of 40 years ago, you can
imagine how great the changes are;
then there were no trains, no steamers,
no telegraph; small boats were pulled
along the roads; soldiers using brass
cannon and breach-loading muskets
fought at close range . . Japan was
not so far behind; it could still catch
up. And so the same embassy divided
its complement of nearly 40 top-level
Government leaders into specialist
teams to survey Western patterns and
institutions.
This embassy is worth a further
glance, for in broad terms it is the
political basis for the economic growth
that now impresses us. Stability was
central to the Meiji story. Despite
changes in the leadership group, most
of whom were from Satsuma and
Choshu, their continuity of purpose and
policy was impressive. The Iwakura
Mission left home only three years
after the Meiji Restoration, and it was
abroad almost a year and a half during
a period of strong disagreements about
foreign and domestic policy; yet the
members of the mission returned home
to find their jobs waiting for them.
The importance of the non-political
emperor above and the non-political
commoners below was very great, but
this sustained ability to work together
was perhaps most important of all. At
no point in Japan’s modern century
have the taxes stopped being collected;
has the administrative structure come
close to collapse; or a substantial por-
tion of the community or country
withdrawn the consent that is required
for forward motion.
The Meiji revolution thus came after
the Meiji Restoration. It was guided,
and popular participation was initially
limited. But there was steady growth
in response to the themes and slogans
that official and unofficial leaders set
for their countrymen. For it was
impossible to “Establish a Rich and
Strong Country!” without the diffusion
of “Civilisation and Enlightenment!”
and a zeal to “Make Something of
Yourself!” Samuel Smiles’ “Self Help,”
first translated in 1871, became a best-
seller, and his examples of poor boys
who overcame adversity and con-
verted it to fortune were full of
relevance to national as well as personal
needs. Indeed the first political party,
formed in 1874, called itself the “Self-
Help Society.” Without a dynamic
and increasingly large-scale response
the Meiji story would have been a very
different one.
All this made of Japan a modern
nation, one in line with the egalitarian
trends of the 19th century and the
modern world. A quarter-century
later the diplomatic and political
rewards came into sight. Treaty
equality with the West, victory over
China and Russia, and alliance with
Great Britain; by the end of the Meiji
Period in 1912, Japan was one of the
world’s great powers, the envy of some
of her neighbors and the master of
others. There is understandable pride
of achievement in the centennial
statement that was drawn up by a
committee of leading Japanese con-
vened by Prime Minister Sato. It
points to the Meiji change as a period
of achievement without parallel in
world history. The very speed of
Japan’s recovery from the war, it
continues, testifies to the soundness of
the work. This generation is under
obligation to take up this heritage
and challenge. Japan has now com-
pleted its work of catching up with
the West, and is looked to for leader-
ship and help by its neighbors. And,
in view of the disruption that the
development of material culture has
caused in the relationship between man
and nature, it would not be inappro-
priate to call for a reappraisal of East
Asian and Japanese values. In short,
the wheel has come full circle. Japan
can contribute as well as benefit, and
the “search throughout the world” for
wisdom of a century ago gives way to
a “youth ship,” fitted out to sail to
South-East Asia to symbolise friendship
and international co-operation.
The gratification of the centennial
celebrants is matched in volume and
exceeded in intensity by those who write
in opposition. Associations of historians
and educators have formed a coalition
to oppose the manner and content of
the centennial. One might expect pro-
fessional historians to take a jaundiced
look at official history, but the nature
of the Tokyo dissent is interesting
because of what it shows about contem-
porary Japan; for it is charged that bad
history is being put at the service of
bad politics.
Many objections focus on the treat-

Constitution, in 1889
ment the Meiji emperor is receiving,
and charge that this is purposeful. The
Meiji emperor is in fact making up
for the neglect he has endured in the
last quarter-century of historical writing.
He will be the subject of a 13-volume
biographical account compiled in the
Imperial Household Ministry; he will
be immortalised in bronze, dwarfed by
memorial halls and museums, and his
memory, indeed all Japan, will be for
ever green in Meiji parks and forests.
The protesting historians think they
see the phoenix palanquin being carried
into the city once again, past a multi-
tude whose heads bend low, this time
not to the ground in awe but to their
television screens in unconcern.
Whatever the difficulties in finding
alternate heroes, it has to be granted
that there is little justification for
giving the Meiji emperor a personal
role in the formative decades of his
reign. To do so is to ignore the way
in which the Meiji leaders engaged
in emperor-building as well as in
nation-building. For the emperor had
to be explained and sold to the masses
by the elite in 19th-century Japan.
Thus “Yomiuri” instructed its readers
in these terms in 1881:
Tomorrow, the third, is Tencho
setsu. Tencho setsu is the birthday of
Japan’s emperor, his majesty Mutsu-
hito. Formerly the shogun ruled our
country, but now it is different. Tenchi
Sama himself rules. People born in
Japan must extend their greetings
and everybody must be joyous, for it
is a great holiday . . . There are
a good many people who do not
know the name of Tenchi Sama. But
to be born in this country and not to
know it is like not knowing your
parents’ age. This is unforgivable. It
must be carefully remembered . . .
It required effort to acquaint the
commoners with their emperor’s
virtues, and it was the task of the
modern education system to diffuse
this throughout the populace. One
result of this was that the 20th century
saw the emperor receive a much more
structured worship than the breathless
adoration that crowds had given him
in 1868.
But the historians’ complaints go well
beyond this. They point out that cen-
tennial statements and ceremonies focus
on early Meiji, when not a great deal
had been achieved, and that they ignore
the uses to which modernisation was put
when it did begin to take effect—that
mass education was used for emperor
worship, industrialisation for armaments,
and national power for imperialism.
They note also that the official state-
ments say almost nothing about Japan’s
democratisation since World War 11,
and conclude that plans are afoot to
undo as much of this as possible. Any-
thing that stresses only the “plus”
factors of this century’s experience, they
argue, will contribute to a new ortho-
doxy as misleading as was the pre-war
praise of famous men and emperors.
Today’s distortions are tomorrow’s
dangers.
In its most extreme forms the argu-
ment goes further still. The centennial
effort to boost national pride, it is
charged, is a transparently political
effort on the part of the Sato Cabinet
to get Japan ready to play its part in a
scheme of world politics developed by
Mr. Sato’s American backers. And the
opposition group warns that the foreign
praise the centennialists court is actually
a trap prepared by American intellec-
tuals with their fashionable concept of
modernisation. The whole point is really
to “talk up” Japan’s accomplishments
for 1970, the date the Security Pact
with America comes up for reconsidera-
tion.
Thus the centennial argument becomes
another chapter in the long battle
between Japan’s intellectual Left and
the conservative Government. It is a
contest that has focused on controls
over the school system, on educational
authorities’ efforts to contain the Japan
Teachers’ Union and on Government
control over textbooks. A leading his-
torian and author of a popular history
text is today battling the Education
Ministry in the courts in an argument
more than ten years old. Efforts on the
part of the Government to encourage
patriotism draw fire from the same
groups, and because so much of the
institutionalisation of patriotism was
tied in with the mystique of imperial
mythology it is usually the historians
who lead the opposition. That the pro-
testing organisations are dominated by
men who adopt a Marxist framework of
analysis encourages both sides in each
dispute to resort to extreme statements.
Nor, of course, do such controversies
come as a setback to publishers’ and
editors’ plans for exploitation of the
centennial. The recent resumption of
observances of February 11 as National
Foundation Day (for the supposed
accession of the legendary emperor,
Jimmu, in 660 8.C.) climaxed one
vigorous battle. The Meiji revival is
thus seen by some as part of a much
larger scheme of restoration.
It has to be granted that there are
groups of whom this is true. The his-
torians’ alarm stems in part from the
fact that many Right-wing organi-
sations, eager to capitalise upon an
expected surge of radical action in con-
nection with the Security Pact, are also,
for their own counter-revolutionary pur-
poses, pointing to 1970 as a crisis date.
Their aim and language are unambigu-
ously revisionist; Japan must revise its
post-war Constitution, recover its lost
morality, and carry out that ill-defined
goal of the military extremists of the
19305, the long-delayed Showa Restor-
ation. Yesterday the restoration of
National Foundation Day, today the
Meiji Centennial, and tomorrow the
showdown. And so private schools,
institutes, corps and fund drives prepare
for the task ahead. The Japan Alliance
stresses the importance of “Japanese
remaining Japanese,” while the Greater
East Asian Academy and the Fuji
Poetry Society see in the present
the opportunity for first a national and
then a world restoration to get under
way, though a full reconstruction
program may require 30 years to com-
plete. In the language of some of these
statements are traces of the fevered
pledges of the Meiji Restoration’s anti-
foreign loyalists with their talk of
reactivating the Japanese spirit and
bringing about a rebirth of patriotism
and purpose.
All this can serve as a useful
reminder that the legacy of the Restor-
ation years was not only progress and
enlightenment; there were also intol-
'erance and parochialism. Few of the
activists of the Meiji Restoration sur-
vived its coming, but many of those
who did became ideal ethical types,


The first labor demonstration, in 1901,
was heckled by police

Taisho, who was
plagued by ill-health
Tokyo police headquarters burning in the 1923
earthquake which destroyed most of the city
inspiring the official patriotism of the
modern State. They felt deeply and
thought simply about the problems of
their country, and combined scorn for
authority as corrupt and self-seeking
with affirmation of the total purity of
imperial devotion. They have served
as models for political fanatics of many
persuasions in more recent Japanese
history. Even today, what they stood
for has one meaning to Rightists indig-
nant over Japan’s forsaking of its
imperial tradition, and quite another to
Leftists who lament their Government’s
acceptance of American leadership,
somewhat as their forebears complained
about the Tokugawa treaties with the
Western powers.
Yet this is an argument about the
present and not the past. Considered
as a whole, the Meiji Restoration
constitutes a significant chapter in the
revolution of modern times. Deflected
or distorted as it may have been by
the urgencies of the situation, influenced
as it was by a tradition radically dif-
ferent from those in which the modern
revolutions of the West unfolded, and
seldom as it was justified in terms of
larger human rights or individual dig-
nity, the Meiji revolution nevertheless
made possible a radical increase in
individual freedom, equality, and oppor-
tunity within Japan. Herein lies one of
its principal paradoxes. It is one that
seems to be overlooked by both the
centennial planners and their critics.
Recently an American writer des-
cribed as one of the principal aspects
of the Russian Revolution an altruism
of purpose that, he suggested, made it
of very broad and universal impor-
tance. It is appropriate to ask whether
there was in the Meiji Restoration
anything of significance antL benefit for
the world outside Japan. Was all this
entirely, as the stock phrase of Meiji
times had it, “for the sake of the
country,” or was there something of
importance for all countries?
One must begin with the admission
the Japanese were so obsessed with
the danger to their own land that they
had little time to worry about others.
The fact that the Meiji developments
seemed forced upon Japan after a long
period of isolation affected their nature
and emphases. Meiji Japan began
with the conviction that imminent
danger threatened from the West, and
for decades it retained that belief. At
first there was genuine fear of
foreign conquest. Later this gave way
to a more reasoned approach in which
Japan’s danger was seen as less unique;
there was therefore much to learn
from the experience of others. The
Restoration activist, Nakaoka, wrote to
his friends shortly before the Restora-
tion that he was no longer in favor
of immediate expulsion of the
foreigners, but favored learning from
them first. “Exclusion has been
practised everywhere,” he wrote.
“When the American people suffered
... a man named Washington . . .
carried out exclusion and drove out
the barbarians.” Japan should “cross
the seas, learn from other peoples,
adopt their spiritual unity, master their
technology, study their military science,
and bring about true exclusion.”
Writing shortly after the Restoration,
Prince Iwakura shared this gloomy
view of the society of nations as a
jungle: “We have no choice in having
intercourse with countries beyond the
seas, but in the final analysis they are
our enemies. Why? Because they
develop their arts and their technology
with a view to growing in wealth and
power. Every country tries to become
the other’s superior.”
In view of the urgency of the danger
and the silence of the masses that
crouched in the dust along the
emperor’s route, it was probably
inevitable that in setting priorities
social justice should take second place
to international equality. A united
effort in the face of pressing foreign
danger was' the universal desire; it had
also been the reason for the shogun’s
decision against resisting the new
regime. This meant that most political
controversy would be about means
rather than ends, and that the most
important criterion of governmental
performance would be the way national
honor and strength were advanced.
Perhaps the one escape to a less
particular and nationalistic Japan lay
in the idea of partnership with nearby
Asian countries in resistance to
Western strength. If not domestic
justice, regional co-operation might
still have produced some measure of
altruism of purpose. A dream of Asian
partnership did in fact provide the
purpose in life for a number of
courageous and idealistic Japanese,
and revolutionaries in China par-
ticularly owed much to their help.
And yet within decades it became a
dream to lead and finally to dominate.
The Tokyo historians who oppose the
centennial tend to see in this sure
evidence of basic structural faults in
modern Japanese thought and society.
But it is equally possible to emphasise
two other reasons: first, the weakness
and disorganisation of the regimes in
neighboring lands; second, the gradual
conviction of Meiji Japanese that it
would be necessary to join the West in
order to equal it. The Japanese reluc-
tantly concluded that affiliation with
Asia would mean association with back-
wardness and weakness, and that they
would risk being permanently handi-
capped in their unequal contest with
the West. Fittingly enough it was Fuku-
zawa, the apostle of modernity, who
called for his countrymen to part with
Asia after the Chinese lost a war to
France and reformers failed to seize
power in Korea. He argued that it was
hopeless to wait for Japan’s neighbors
to modernise. “When judgments of
China and Korea are applied to ,our
country,” he wrote, “it hurts our foreign
policy. We do not have time to wait
for neighboring countries to develop
and then to join them in the revival of
Asia. We ought, instead, to get away
from them and join the company of
Western, civilised nations. If we keep
bad company we will get a bad name.”
And so association with Asia was put
off until Japan had secured its national
goals. When diplomatic equality was
reached in 1894, Minister to England
Aoki exclaimed in jubilation, “With
this treaty Japap enters the ranks of
civilised countries.” The very next year
Japan forced from a defeated Manchu
Empire the diplomatic inequality it
accorded other “civilised countries.”
But Japanese influence on modern

tury would-be modernisers elsewhere in
Asia associated Japan’s achievements
with their hopes for their own countries.
The Chinese revolutionary movement,
in particular, was powerfully affected
by the Japanese example, and Japan’s
victory over Russia brought thousands
of Chinese students flooding into Tokyo
to make of it the seedbed for the
revolution of 1911. Years later Sun
Yat Sen remembered how, as he
returned to Japan through the Suez
Canal in 1905, the people along his
path had been excited by the Japanese
victory. An Arab, he recalled, asked
him, “Are you Japanese?” Even after
Sun, who was travelling as Mr.. Takano,
said he was Chinese, he could see that
“the joy of this Arab, as a member of
the great Asiatic race, seemed to know
no bounds.” Japan became, by example,
a factor in change elsewhere, and • the
Meiji Restoration found echo in the
modern Asian revolution. Soon the
Japanese image became marred by
selfish and shortsighted interest. Yet the
Japanese example contributed to free-
dom, nationalism, and modernisation
throughout East Asia despite the
best efforts of the Japanese to limit and
control that. response in the areas sub-
ject to their control. Tokyo leaders
never fully comprehended why a
response they had helped stir should
not be pro-Japanese. This is another of
the paradoxes of the centennial and its
significance—and again it is one that
seems overlooked by both the planners
and their critics.
The debate about the Meiji centen-
nial is then only partly a debate about
Japan’s recent past. It is much more
a debate about the nature and direction
of Japan’s present and future. And the
argument about the past is really less
about the Restoration itself, about
1868, than it is about the Meiji .modern
State. The restoration years were a
period of relative openness. The struc-
tured Tokugawa hierarchy came apart,
and Japanese discussed the response
their country should take to the modern
world with imagination and courage.
The Meiji State, on the other hand,
which represented the final response to
this, was completed in 1890 with the
constitution, the educational system,
the powerful military establishment, and
the newly formulated ideology of
imperial divinity and national unique-
ness.
For many, 1890 cancels out 1868;
at the l.east, it conditions it and links
it to 1941. The Government spokesmen,
and the Japanese Establishment gen-
erally, are the least disturbed by this;
they are the most willing to emphasise
the undeniable contributions and
achievements of the modern order, and
are understandably anxious to stem the
tide of self-criticism and lament that
has saddled Japan with an almost para-
lysing inability to form a consensus
since the war. The authorities move
cautiously with the mercurial tides of
public opinion, avoiding both extremes,
and seem to ask only that Japan redis-
cover its pride and confidence. The
Right Wing, on the other hand, without
any of the institutional or financial
support that once made it so potent,
represents a constant nuisance, but has
little real potential. Its nostalgia for a
non-capitalist social unity and imperial
purity is not accompanied by any prac-
tical program for getting there. The
men of letters, however, and the Left
generally, while they share some of this
utopianism and nationalism, remember
the pre-surrender State chiefly for its
stultifying restrictions and police con-
trols, which are described in ever
darker tones for those too young to
have experienced them. The one con-
sensus that emerges, in fact, is a deter-
mination uniting almost all groups that
it shall happen “never again.”
Many writers and intellectuals would
prefer to see 1945 recognised as the
date for the commemoration of a truly
modern and democratic Japan. Their
opposition to any degree of rearma-
ment, to Government control over
teachers, schools, and textbooks, and to
ties with the United States, makes them
quick to charge the Government with
planning a “return” to the unaccept-
able. From this perspective the centen-
nial represents an insidious effort to
promote reversion. The Meiji Centen-
nial will and should be commemorated.
But the larger argument will be decided
by the generation that has had its
education since 1945, and which recalls
neither a divine nor a defeated
monarch. The 23 years since the present
order began represent the same time
span that brought the Meiji State to its
fruition in 1890. There are many lines
of comparison that suggest themselves.
Japan is infinitely stronger today in
organisational and economic power
than it was then, and it is a far more
diverse and interesting society. Then,
as now, there was much alarm about
an uncommitted younger generation
that took its gains for granted and
thought of self over country. There
was uneasiness then as well that repre-
sentative government did not seem to
lead to that perfect harmony in which
money and party played no role. Then,
too, the establishment was alarmed
because it saw military and political
challenges ahead, and, felt the need for
united effort.
Other comparisons are even more
pointed. In 1890 young Japanese who
had no recollection of the crisis of their
country in late Tokugawa times were
resentful of Japan’s second-class
standing in international society, tired
of the unequal treaties and increasingly
suspicious of their leaders. Today,
despite the cost advantages of the
Security Pact, there are comparable
stirrings, discontent, and calls for self-
assertion and autonomy. In 1890 a few
States still served as models, and alle-
giance to the Western ca,mp was a
clear condition for full independence.
Today, after the Cultural Revolution
and Vietnam, the model States decline
in prestige and influence, and there is
a new interest in the nature of a poly-
centric world that beckons. Fukuzawa
could write that it was necessary to
“depart from Asia” to secure true
independence, but his successors today
demand a bridge to Asia as Japan’s
only hope of freedom.
The fervor, innocence, and simplicity
of Meiji Japan will not return a
second time. In retrospect the past
seems contentious, divisive, and sus-
picious. It is almost as though things
were reversed; as though the emperor’s
palanquin, a century later, drew silent
respect from the foreigners, while the
Japanese crowd provided the hum,
laughter, and indignation.

How to naturalise Canberra
Anzac Parade baroque design in the 20th century
By JANE and ALLEN CORREY
LANDSCAPE architects’ ideal, design
students’ inspiration, a nation’s reflection
and example, pioneer exponent of a new
concept . . . this could have been
Canberra.
For it is only in comparatively recent
times that the concept of a national
capital has existed at all. Although such
cities as London and Paris have for
centuries been regarded as national
capitals, they have acquired this sig-
nificance more by circumstance than by
design. However, towns like Washington,
Brasilia, and Canberra were laid out
and built for the specific purpose of
leading their respective countries.
The name national capital implies
that this town is different, not only
from all other towns but from all other
capitals, State or international. It is
the seat of national government, a
gathering place for foreign diplomats,
a clearing house for information on a
national level, and a focal point for
meetings of national importance. It
should, therefore, have an air of dignity
befitting these political, diplomatic, and
cultural functions.
All the characteristics just mentioned
are common to any national capital
city. But if there are to be features
which distinguish one national capital
from another and it is important
from the point of view of maintaining
design unity with a community that
there should be such features they
must, of necessity, be largely visual.
Among the most significant of these
are the man-made landscape elements.
In addition to being functional, as are,
for example, shade and sheltered plant-
ing, the landscape treatment should
also direct attention to major buildings
and at the same time be complementary
to the surrounding environment. It is
important, too, that the man-made
landscape has a distinctly national
character, which should be honest, not
imitative or selfconscious.
In designing Canberra, the new
Versailles: Le Notre’s monumental plan
Canberra: Griffin’s anachronism
capital of a new country, Walter Burley
Griffin had the unique opportunity of
being the originator of a national-design
style—a style as free and untrammelled
as Australia itself. Instead he chose to
copy a style conceived two and a half
centuries earlier the monumental
approach which was Andre Le Notre’s
vision of Versailles.
Le Notre was faced with the task of
providing a stage for the colorful and
ostentatious life of Louis XlV’s Court.
The masterpiece he produced was a
valid expression of a particular time,
place, and a way of life; in other words,
a true landscape style. Griffin’s object,
on the other hand, was to create a place
for real people to live and work in; but
the solution he offered in the absurdly
grandiose lines of Canberra is an anach-
ronism baroque design in the
20th century. His pompous land and
water axes and the avenues radia-
ting from Capital Hill are • derived, in
principle, directly from Versailles. The
gargantuan proportions of Anzac Parade
are positively inhuman; and can its
space-consuming presence and its one-
day-of-the-year function be
anyway? With informal planting, and
possibly building, this Parade could be
converted to a more useful human scale.
The system of circular roads, a fine
example of what the well-known
American landscape architect Garrett
Eckbo describes as “plumber’s plan-
ning,” is not only confusing, it is visu-
ally And so is the
repetition of the almost identical open-
planned new suburbs with their ultra-
neat gardens so conspicuously lacking
in privacy. Over the years these will
soften, and the planting create more
privacy, but at the same time they are
likely, by virtue of the social climate
into which they were born, to acquire
the impression of smug respectability
given by the older suburbs.
The whole idea of Canberra’s suburbs
is reminiscent of the “Garden City” and

“City Beautiful” movements. L. D.
Pryor in “Canberra: A Nation’s Capital”
says, “The idea that Canberra could be
beautified by the planting of trees and
other plants and by numerous parks and
gardens was accepted from the begin-
ning.” This is not only true, it is pre-
cisely what is wrong with the landscape
treatment of Canberra. The trouble is
the people who have been responsible
for this treatment have, from the start,
been horticulturists rather than land-
scape architects, and this has resulted
in fragmented pocket planting as
opposed to the strength of a total-design
concept.
The emphasis has always been on
"prettification”—a “chaos of prettiness,”
W. K. Hancock has called the predom-
inance of showy, exotic, and flowering
species generally at the expense of the
more appropriate native material. Every-
where there is evidence of an unsym-
pathetic mixing of species, gum and
poplar, acacia and hawthorn, that shows
how little thought has been given to the
relationships of form, texture, and color.
The tendency to regiment native plants
is particularly unfortunate in grove
plantings, which should be informal.
There is also great emphasis on the
“park specimen” which merely accen-
tuates the already too tailored landscape.
Outmoded floral displays, especially on
traffic roundabouts where they cannot
be properly appreciated, complete a
rather Victorian picture. Perhaps an
“old hat” approach could be excused
40 years ago, but it is deplorable that
such things as purple prunus are still
being planted. It is possible that all
this Victoriana has been the result of
an unnecessarily rigid adherence to the
original plan, or it may be that designers
have been inclined to give in too easily
to the whims of influential politicians.
In any case, unless a more enlight-
ened line is taken we will continue to
have, superimposed on the Australian
landscape fabric, an alien pattern which
is as out of place and dishonest as
were the jardin anglais and the Italian
Revival at the beginning of the 19th
century.
This alien pattern is quite obvious
from any vantage point in Canberra.
It appears as an oasis of European
green, punctuated by the over-use of
the fastigiate forms of poplars and
conifers (City Hill with its liberal
sprinkling of conifers looks almost
funereal) set in the hazy blue-green of
the surrounding environment. The rigid
cardboard-cutout effect of the forestry
plantations around the city strikes an
equally incongruous note.
Not only are these plantations some-
what sterile in appearance, they also
lack the interest of birdlife that a native
forest has. Another feature seen very
clearly from lookouts is the over-
generous distribution of open space,
quite out of scale with the developed
areas. Although at night these open
spaces are pools of darkness which
provide an exciting contrast to the
lights, this hardly justifies their
existence.
The fact that there are so many
easily accessible natural vantage points
(unfortunately Black Mountain has
been disfigured by an amateurish
dumping, in the name of landscape
design, of piles of boulders) is one
of Canberra’s greatest assets the
siting of the city is, in fact, a master-
piece. The distant Main Range was
obviously envisaged as an arresting
backdrop, and it is becoming a major
recreation area for the town’s growing
population and a link with the
Kosciusko National Park.
Within the town itself there are
abundant facilities for recreation of all
kinds. There are numerous picnic areas,
parks, playing fields, and swimming-
pools, but, of course, the foremost is
Lake Burley Griffin. Originally con-
ceived as an ornamental feature (a
short-sighted stipulation of the 1911
Competition demanded that there
should be an ornamental feature of
some kind), the lake has now been
turned to practical advantage as well.
It serves as a visual and social focus
and also provides physical and phycho-
logical relief during the hot summers.
From a recreational point of view,,
sailing is its most important use.
Aesthetically the form, color and grace-
ful movement of sails are compatible
with the environment, but it is to be
hoped that the disturbing noise and
speed of the motor-boat are never
allowed to encroach.
As a feature the present lake fails
in a number of ways. It occupies a
disproportionate area and is therefore
overpowering, and the vast sheet of
water lacks the vitality and topo-
graphical variety of a meandering
stream, which the Molonglo, although
small, used to offer. Its shores are
shaven; they are without contrast
and should be broken up by the
juxtaposition of bold planting and
building, if necessary, right into the
water. This would have the added
advantage of highlighting the water’s
reflective qualities.
The islands, generally, are pleasing
and help to relieve the flat expanse of
the lake, but it is a pity that a couple
of them are unimaginatively circular.
It is a pity, too, that more thought
was not given to using the concrete
stormwater drains leading into the lake
as landscape elements.
The landscape treatment of the
urban areas varies in quality, from the
best in Hobart Place with its sequence
of enclosed spaces, human in scale,
its unified paving, and its restrained
planting, to the mediocre in Garema
Place which, with its changes of pav T
ing pattern and mixture of plant
species, has been over-designed. Con-
trasting with the comparatively
sensitive treatment of these urban areas
is the vulgar Disneyland of the
Legations district, where pseudo-
architecture and foreign garden styles
mock the environment and each other.
The Australian environment is a
unique environment and it ought to be
our privilege to conserve it as much
as possible for the rest of the world.
The opportunity to do this in Canberra


has so far been missed, but it is not
yet too late to preserve what does still
exist of the Australian character and
to ensure that this character is fostered
in future design. There remain,
probably by accident, a number of
areas of attractive natural bush, for
example between the Legations district
and the lake. These should be retained
at all costs and linked with other
such areas by the same informal plant-
ing of natives which has recently been
carried out below the Russell Offices.
There is nothing wrong with exotics
in themselves. In fact, deciduous
exotics are often more appropriate than
native species, but in the case of
Canberra they should be confined to
the urban areas where formal planting
and growth habit are acceptable and
often desirable. They could also be
used to advantage along natural
drainage channels, because most
deciduous species grow naturally in the
deep, moist soil generally associated
with these channels, and because
willows deciduous exotics already
dominate the watercourses of the region.
Where natives have been regimented
a great improvement could be effected
by judicious culling. A systematic
replanting program could be initiated
to replace gradually most of the
exotics in non-urban areas with
ecologically suitable native species. In
this way the city would acquire a pre-
dominantly Australian flavor.
From now on, Canberra, as the
National Capital, should set an
example to professional and student
designers, and lead the way in all
fields of landscape research. There is
a wonderful opportunity to experiment
with groundcover planting to replace
many of the vast areas of unused and
useless grass which require so much
maintenance. Original thought on
street-planting design is long overdue.
So, too, is experimentation with car-
park design. It would not be difficult,
with the technological means at our
disposal today, to produce something
more imaginative and no less functional
than the terrifying deserts of asphalt
that are such a feature of Canberra
at present. The landscape treatment of
schools and children’s playgrounds, so
many of which are now being built,
presents a challenge which has not yet
been taken up. Forestry, although
usually regarded as merely a com-
mercial crop, has limitless possibilities
as a large-scale design element. All
these challenges should not, however,
be left exclusively to the National
Development Commission’s designers.
It has always been considered healthy
that any design work should
occasionally be given the benefit of
outside stimulus.
But time is running out. A minor
design revolution will have to come
quickly, for even now everybody con-
cerned is doing his utmost to make our
National Capital as stultifyingly
mediocre as too many other cities.

“Everyman”
in Port
Moresby
By JOHN TASKER
God, played by Raphael Angelie, in an adaptation of the morality play
“Everyman,” by the Nigerian writer Obotunde Ijimere, presented
at the Papua and New Guinea Territory Drama Festival
for the Madang Teachers’ College
FOR THE PAST nine years one or
other of the major centres in Papua
and New Guinea has been host to the
Territory Drama Festival. This year it
was Port Moresby. Adjudicating this
year’s festival gave me an opportunity
in a short space of time to see some
of the best theatre work being presented
in the Territory.
Fro,m all accounts, there has been a
firm, steady improvement in theatre
work in the Territory. There are accom-
plished actors, producers, and scene
designers; Lae and Port Moresby are
building new theatres; an amazing effort
is undertaken to present plays. To attend
this year’s festival, various groups flew
more than 5000 miles. Madang sent 60
actors and backstage people. The group
from Wewak travelled with their set
by boat, truck, and plane. Such deter-
mination is rather awe-inspiring.
However, of paramount importance
this year was the very real flowering
of indigenous presentations. Four of the
11 plays were performed by entirely
indigenous casts.
There have been many earlier
attempts to incorporate indigenous
actors in local productions. This is only
to be praised, but past methods now
seem ludicrous or, at least, over-
cautious. A chorus of Papuans as the
policeman appeared in an otherwise all-
European production of “The Pirates of
Penzance.” “It was the only possible
casting for any natives,” someone
remarked to me, “after all, the police
only come on and sing, they never get
to dance with the girls.”
A production of Moliere with an all-
indigenous cast, except for a European
girl playing the daughter, can hardly
be labelled, as it was, multi-racial. All-
indigenous casts have presented “Lost
in the Stars”—without the music, which
never arrived—and “King Kong.”
I had some apprehensions about what
might be presented this year. But the
festival worked out to be one of the
most memorable theatrical events I have
witnessed.
Admittedly, the four indigenous pres-
entations were all produced by European
college lecturers, and only one was
locally written, a dramatisation of a
New Guinea legend, “Pono Atorem
Gapasa.” The other three plays were
African, two by the noted Nigerian
writer Wole Soyinka, “The Swamp
Dwellers” and “The Trials of Brother
Jero,” the third an adaptation of the
old morality play “Everyman” by the
Nigerian writer Obotunde Ijimere.
A very real attempt had been made
by the producer, Greg Katahanas, to
rewrite and adapt the Soyinka plays
to the New Guinea scene, but many of
the basic concepts in the plays
remained Nigerian and much must
have been as foreign to the cast as
a French farce. However, they were
played with great humor and sincerity,
and the hu,manity in Soyinka’s writing
came across, so much so that I
regretted that, unlike London and
New York, we are scarcely likely to
see them performed in Australia.
The emphasis on Soyinka’s plays in
the Territory is probably due to Dr.
Ulrich Beier, Senior Lecturer in
English at the University of Port
Moresby. Beier came to the Territory
after six years in Nigeria. He is a
close friend of Wole Soyinka and, in
fact, has translated Nigerian plays,
including Ijimere’s version of “Every-
man.”
Dr. Beier’s influence will probably
be felt in the near future. His students
are equipped with tape-recorders when
they leave on holiday for their home
districts. They aim to collect legends,
stories, anything the elders of the
village remember; excellent raw
material for future indigenous theatre.
Dr. Beier is also adviser in drama
to the Territory’s colleges and high
schools, which probably accounts for
the predominantly Nigerian context of
the college presentations this year.
All the indigenous plays were
spoken in English, which is still to
all intents a second language. Papuans
and New Guineans find it easier ta
express themselves in their own
language or in pidgin or place-talk.
Despite this, there are distinct signs
of growing awareness that plays
should not be considered as extensions
of the English class. It is now realised
that the plays must have an inherent
importance and relevance to those
perforjning them. No prizes are
awarded these days for “best diction,”
and there is growing hostility from
some quarters, both European and
indigenous, toward the award for the
Best Indigenous Production.
The two plays which particularly
interested me were “Everyman” and
“Pono Atorem Gapasa.” The first
because it seemed to imply possible
means of development of a local
indigenous theatre.
“Everyman” had a number of
moments of purest theatre, stunning
in their conception and realisation. The


curtains opened on God in his
majesty a figure of muscular, primi-
tive splendor. A great headdress of
bird-of-paradise plumes, his wide chest
hung with chains of dogs’ teeth and
w r ild boar tusks, a shell disc in his
nose, legs and arms .muscular as the
jungle. This w r as a relentless, all-
powerful savage god. I felt the entire
audience catch its breath. It was a
terrifying vision. Death was hardly
less so; agile, sinewy, and disguised by
a large black-and-red totem mask held
before his face, he danced attendance
on God and stalked Everyman. Money
entered smothered in chains of golden
coins which shook in jangling
rhythm, a gilded smiling mask hiding
his brutal face. Good Deeds crawled

tribal splendor. These were stunning
exotic movements, but the main area
of the play was set firmly in present
times. Everyman, his friends, and his
women wore European clothes, they
caroused with beer while they boasted
of the cars and trucks Everyman owned;
they danced to a wild twist blaring
from a transistor radio.
The play ended with the sudden,
G i j v rI?
quite unsentimental death of Everyman,
cast down as he knelt gabbling a
prayer. There was no place for
r ; r
atonement. _ _
For a European sensibility there
seemed, to put it mildly, a clash of
styles in this production, but for the
indigenous members of the audience
there was no disunity. Their “decadent
Everyman would glory in his European
possessions while the ancient god
sought him.”
“Pono Atorem Gapasa” was adapted
by the producer, Barry Eton, from a
New Guinea legend. The story was
quite simple—a murder by an opposing
clan, a council of war, the revenge
death, and the final celebration. The
weakest elements of the play were
several chunks of rather literary,
decidedly European, speech.
The strength was the firm, elemental
story line and the ritualistic means of
telling it: the great lament echoed by
solemn drums; the chant of revenge;
great cries of “Payback! Payback!!
Payback!!!” The stately, almost cere-
monial. encounter between the two
clans, the joyous initiation of the boy
hero of the story, and the wild dance
of victory.
The cast seemed most at home with
the mime, the chants, and the dancing,
but there was an unexpected sophisti-
cation in the economy of the produc-
tion. Settings were kept to the barest
essentials, such as a clump of tall grass.
Projections were used on the back
cloth in a manner which would have

The play lasted no more than 20
minutes, but its reliance on a simple
strong story, its use of ritual and mime
and SO ng pointed one possible direction
0 f development for indigenous theatre.
Afterwards several Papuan and New
Guinea students sat me down to ask
advice on writing their own plays.
They had begun to realise that they
needed plays of their own, but how
should they start.
What do you say when our own
theatre is undergoing upheavals in
style, approach, context, and purpose?
There can be no simple rules anyone
can offer any longer. I believe there is
a place for ritual, song, dance, mime
in all theatres and that their culture
is strong in these ingredients. Yet for
a European it is difficult to resist
conceiving an indigenous Papuan and
New Guinea theatre in exotic decorative
terms.
Writers and directors from among
these indigenous people .must be
encouraged. Indigenous theatre must
step out from the colleges and schools
and go to the villages and townships,
Perhaps it can even act as a bulwark
against the erosion of what is best in
local cultures.
NIDA can’t give these people any-
thing. Perhaps a Joan Littlewood could,
Perhaps ways must be found to send
directors and writers to some of the
new African States, which are defiantly
developing a culture alien to the
European models,
_ , , ,
G r id knows what they will want to
express in then- theatre. I hope it will
mean assimilation. I hope it won t be
revolution. Maybe it depends on what
assistance we give now. Surely the
Australian Council for the Performing
Arts must see the Territory as part
of the Council’s area of activity.

Why write novels?
By SANDRA HALL
AUSTRALIAN PUBLISHERS talk
optimistically about increased interest
in Australian books, and some even
contemplate, not too fancifully, about
making money from that great
unsalable poetry.
Yet Australian novelists, lionised and
publicised as never before, look forward
to bleak financial futures- Television
has effectively stolen the audience for
the middle-brow novel. Today, people
who buy novels buy paperbacks, the
royalties from which are not lavish.
So no one writes novels to get rich,
or even to make a reasonable living
from them. But more and better Aus-
tralian novels are being written. In the
past few years a few new novelists have
emerged to the sound of warm
encouragement from the critics. George
Johnston, Geoffrey Dutton, and Thea
Astley are three of the best-known
figures on the literary scene in Aus-
tralia, and all have their own reasons
for grappling with the uncertainties of
the novel.
“I’m very conscious of time running
out.” George Johnston is sitting in his
Sydney living-room, a fat, leather-bound
manuscript on a desk behind him. “I’m
56, and not many writers have written
their best work after my age, so there’s
a certain desperation. After all,
Shakespeare was dead at 56.”
The manuscript is his new novel,
which has been in his mind for three
years, although his writing time on it,
interrupted by illness and long spells
in hospital, amounts to perhaps seven
months. He estimates now that he is
within 30 pages of completing it, “but
you can’t tell how long that will take.
I write very quickly—it pours out of
me, but I rewrite enormously now, and
I keep rewriting continuously, rather
than doing a first draft. I’ve made about
four false starts and thrown away
hundreds of pages.”
The novel, written around the theme
of expatriation, will be a continuation
of “My Brother Jack,” the novel which
Johnston published in 1964 shortly
before returning to Australia from
Greece, where he’d spent the previous
ten years. The book was well reviewed,
sold well, and provided the basis for
an Australian television series. But
financially, Johnston is far less success-
ful than he was ten years ago, when he
was earning an adequate income from
writing slick popular novels with exotic
backgrounds and thrillers for the enter-
tainment market, which has since
vanished.
But the creation of fiction is a strong
habit to break, even if he wanted to,
and although his last spell in hospital
is little more than a week behind him
and his face hasn’t yet lost its strain,
it’s clear the habit has stuck.
“The novel is the only satisfying
George Johnston...a certain desperation
medium for saying the things I want
to say. I got out of journalism by
choice and I wouldn’t go back to it—
it’s a young man’s game. The new
media, like television, are interesting,
but they’re for younger men, too.
“Non-fiction books? I’ve done one,
‘The Australians,’ and it sold over
100,000 copies, which is extraordinary
considering it was $9 a copy. There
definitely is a good market for this sort
of book. But the research involved in
work like that goes against the grain
of the writer who’s used to being in
a room with his characters. This is
inclined to end up as a sort of self-
indulgence. A serious novel takes a
sustained engrossment of ten months or
so and you tend to build a wall around
yourself.
“If you’re doing a biography, it
means, first of all, six months at the
library churning through facts, when
you’re interest probably lies within a
different framework, anyway. The docu-
mentary stuff I’ve enjoyed has been in
films and television, because they’re dif-
ferent media and they allow you to
re-see things.”
The sense of goals yet unrealised is
both an encouraging and discouraging
force, and Johnston feels its pressures
are easier for an older writer to bear
here than they would be in a country
like the United States, where the most
talked-about literary achievements are
coming from men in their twenties and
thirties.
“When I came back to Australia, I
was surprised at how few young novel-
ists had developed, and it made me
think, oh well, better keep on having
a go. A few are starting to appear now,
but with the possible exception of
Keneally there’s no one as yet to put
the pressure on Patrick White. There’s
also the fact that when you reach my
age, and you’ve been writing fiction for
some time, you should at least have
reached a certain stage of economic
security. Royalties from things build up
over the years, and, as well, publishers
do publish you. It’s no longer such a
gamble.”
Autobiography the wish to “get it
out of your system” seems to have
provided the initial impetus for most
Australian novelists writing today, and
Johnston is no exception. His earlier
attempts to write something “serious”
had international backgrounds and no
success. It was only when he ignored
his surroundings and the eternally sunlit
detachment of the expatriate life on the
Greek island of Hydra and focused
several thousand miles away on the city
where he’d grown up that he suc-
ceeded.
“It was better to do it from Greece,
removed from time and space, at least
with a novel of nostalgia like that. If
I’d been here, I’d have had to look back


Geoffrey Dutton ...letting you into the spirit of the age
at things through the contemporary
Australia around me.”
In “My Brother Jack,” the character
of Jack stands partly for the seldom-
heeded conscience of his brother David,
who is opportunistic and often irrespon-
sible, although never ceasing to regret
the fact. He himself is the autobio-
graphical figure, Johnston says wryly,
hoping at the same time that he was
never that bad. (“I made him worse,
because I needed this defectionist a
man of betrayal to counterbalance
the typical Jack.”) And he reappears in
the new novel, becoming progressively
less autobiographical and more
villainous.
“I have to depart from the straight-
forward pattern of autobiography,
otherwise it would be dreary beyond
belief and self-pitying. But I use the
autobiographical form, because if I
can put myself in a situation as it hap-
pened to me I can understand it better
than if I’d invented it. The background
is the thing I’ve tried to do honestly,
trying to make it successful as a
sociological novel.”
Johnston has had many years to
reflect on the dilemmas of expatriation.
His ten years in Greece, with his wife,
Charmian Clift, and their children,
were preceded by his experiences
during the war as a correspondent for
“Time” and “Saturday Evening Post.”
But, he says, the book is filled with
problems, some of them still unresolved.
“Principally, I’m writing about the
process of battling always in the big
leagues up against the tremendously
intimidating factors of competition in
an older culture. The feeling in Europe
that it’s all been done before.”
Yet, in an ironically practical way,
expatriation hastened Johnston’s switch
from journalist to novelist. In Greece,
the impossibility of getting a work
permit meant he had to earn all his
money out of the country, and creative
writing was the least complicated way
of doing it.
“But both the London and Ameri-
can 'markets are hard to crack, so unless
you can pull off a film it’s a constant
fight. You’ve escaped from the rat-
race, but you’re still dependant on it
for survival. You have to rely on self-
discipline and that’s difficult in the sun.
As time goes on, the feeling grows that
you can’t fit into the old life. I still
find this after four years back here.
“But weighed up against this is the
strain of living as an alien and belong-
ing nowhere —the business of residents’
permits and living under police surveil-
lance. And home is there as a constant
escape hatch, so you scuttle back to the
womb, thinking I’d rather be a bigger
fish at home than a little one abroad.”
The stream of indigenous Australian
novelists hasn’t begun to flow properly
yet, he believes, and won’t until a new
group of people start working on the
novel. “And, financially, it won’t get
any easier for young novelists. But
you can’t complain. After all, no one
asks you to write novels. That choice is
entirely yours.”
Geoffrey Dutton has made a reputa-
tion as so many other things . poet,
critic, publisher, and the personification
of a discreet form of literary showman-
ship that his emergence as a novelist
at this point provokes a certain surprise.
Not that it’s a sudden development.
“Andy,” a tragi-comic novel which
owes its existence to Dutton’s experi-
ences in the Australian Air Force dur-
ing World War II has been around
for the past five years, moving
gradually toward completion in gaps
between Dutton’s other activities. It’s
not his first. That one, titled “The
Mortal and the Marble,” was about
German refugees during the war and
was published unspectacularly in Eng-
land in. 1949. He doesn’t believe it
found its way to Australia.
“Andy” is a summation of things
impossible to say in poetry because of
a poem’s brevity and intensity. Dutton
believes poetry is the purest form of
literary work, but at the moment is
intoxicated with “the gorgeous freedom
of the novel,” and a commissioned
biography waits impatiently in the
wings while he gets on with his next
one.
Like George Johnston, he is pre-
occupied with the “innocence” of Aus-
tralia and “our lack of a tragic sense.”
The theme is explored in “Andy,” and
will recur in his next novel about
an Australian scientist’s involvement
with a Russian poetess. The analogy
needs no elaboration, and Dutton’s
eagerness to finish it quickly has been
heightened by Russia’s invasion of
Czechoslovakia. “Not that I’m writing
about that. Writing about things
happening currently is always dangerous
better to wait and put them in per-
spective. So the novel is actually set a
couple of years ago, but the Czech
crisis did sharpen things a lot.”
Dutton is an ardent debunker of talk
about aggressive nationalism in Aus-
tralian literature, but he does believe
the novel brings forth regional charac-
teristics with particular intensity. “This
book, for instance,” he says, picking up
a copy of “Cancer Ward,” by Alexan-
der Solzhenitsyn. “It’s so very Russian.
And Australians want to know more
and more about themselves, so this is a
bonanza for the novel.”
As Dutton’s own novel begins, Andy
is in a military prison—a happy rebel
addicted to the thrills of low-flying
(one point that is entirely auto-
biographical) and frustrated by the
illogicalities of Air Force-style con-
formity. There is a substantial middle
section which establishes Andy’s love
of life through bravado, love affairs,
and frienship before evil encroaches
on his world and shows him the dark
side of life.
Andy learns, improvises, and survives
to find himself once more in the
“boob,” knowing he’s found out a lot
more and that the Air Force hasn’t.
“Andy is a bit like Australia itself—
going through a period of finding out
just how beastly the world can be. I
wanted to balance the wrong Australian
myths, too—about the insensitivity of
the typical Australian.”
The character of Andy was based on
a man Dutton knew in the Air Force
and who was killed at the end of the
war. “He was the essence of the
young Australian, incapable of being
put down by tragic events. The air of
chance intensifies during war, and it’s
what people make of the things that


happen to them that’s interesting. The
old Victorian concept of one thing
leading to another is most unrepresenta-
tive of our age. It’s how you improvise
that matters.”
The trick in all this is, of course, to
make people understand, and Dutton
was temporarily fazed by one Mel-
bourne bookseller’s assurance that he’d
order a substantial stock of the novel,
because it would make good light read-
ing at Christmastime.
But the possibilities of novel-w r riting
more than make
up for its uncer-
tainties, he be-
lieves. “I’m find-
ing writing very
hard. You know
wdiether you’ve
succeeded wdth a
poem, but with a
long think like a
novel you don’t.
But it’s the chal-
lenge I need at
the moment be-
cause of its free-
dom of style.”
And there’s an
air of the big
gamble about it.
“You see, with a
biography you
reach a certain
number of dis-
cerning people.
But if a novel
takes off, that’s
the way of reach-
ing people with
prose. Look at the
impact of a book
like ‘Dr. Zhivago.’ You know, Bren-
tano’s, the New York bookshop, took
just 16 copies of it at the beginning,
then it took off. Nothing else lets you
into the spirit of the age like a novel.”
Thea Astley is standing at a kitchen
bench, saying how dreary making
rissoles is and trying to decide why she
writes novels. The drowning spring
afternoon seems a world aw r ay from the
irony, the power, and the despair of her
last novel, but perhaps there’s some
invisible fuel for writers contained in
this outer suburban air, for Thomas
Keneally and Thelma Forshaw, the
short-story writer, both live within a
few miles.
She finally comes up with her reason
—prestige. “Does that sound awful?
But I suppose that’s what it is. The
money doesn’t mean much, but I’d
hate to be thought of as a writer of
pop novels. And escape that comes
into it.”
Her recently published novel, “A
Boat Load of Home Folk,” is her fifth
(sixth if you count the rejected one she
keeps in a drawer) a merciless
examination of the failures of a group
of life’s lost ones brought together on
an island in the tropics. There’s a
homosexual priest, whose agonies of
conscience are ended wdien his indis-
cretions are discovered, two elderly
spinsters, one pathetic, the other
vicious, a couple w r hose marriage
has degenerated into a spiritless battle
of wills, and a man whose chances for
happiness with his mistress are thwarted
by illness and despair.
~ f her first a " A -
, ra ian s^ tmg ’ an [J she s P ent a holiday
in the New Hebrides absorbing the
atmosphere of the tropics so as to
adhere to the first rule in the fiction-
writer’s canon—write what you know.
Critics have talked about the cruelty
with which she treats her characters in
Thea Astley ...you never stop writing autobiographically
this book, something which makes her
mildly unhappy.
“I meant all those characters to be
pathetic. Although,” and she smiles, “I
suppose I’ve sent the men up a bit.
But there’s a little of me in all of them.
Poor old Miss Trumper’s cleanliness
complex—that’s me. I spend hours here
in the kitchen washing things over and
over again. You never completely stop
writing autobiographically. Yes, auto-
biography was my first reason for
writing fiction. I did a 40,000-word
novella on my last day in Townsville,
where I was teaching.”
And the Catholic issues which recur
in her novels. “Well, I’m giving that
up in the next one, although the priest
will reappear—as a waiter in a strip-
tease place called The Bottoms Up,
which he keeps calling by its Latin
name, but if you’re brought up as a
Catholic and you’re as sensitive—or as
thin-skinned as I am—you never forget.
And it keeps on coming out in my
writing.”
At university in Brisbane, and after-
ward, she wrote poetry, and some of it
has been included in an anthology. She
wasn’t a good poet, she says, but her
love of the glittering phrase made her
feel she might be able to write colorful
prose. “I’ve tried short stories, too, but
that’s too hard. You have to be so sharp
and so concise to write a good story.
And I’m not. In a novel you can cover
up the dull patches with passages of
sheer vitality. In fact, you can cover a
multitude of sins that way.”
BoltYoad'of HoTe Mk” Tof' £ 2
p lifi cat i on 0 f the ornate style she dis-
played in her earlier novels. But she
says it ’ s an effect she wasn’t striving
f or> “The novel before it ‘The Slow
Natives,’ lent itself to phrase-making
more than this one, although I didn’t
feel gay or scintillating when I wrote it.
And I suppose I
just got sick of
waiting around
for phrases to
come. Certainly
I was bored stiff
by the time I
finished.
“And I didn’t
like it that much,
because I missed
the sparkling old
verbiage. Cer-
tainly, the flow is
the most impor-
tant thing about
a novel, but I do
like phrases—l’ve
always loved
words. If you
asked me what
book I’d take
away with me on
to a desert island,
I’d say either an
atlas or a diction-
ary, but I think it
would be the dic-
tionary.
“And Nabokov
is the writer I love most because of
his style.”
When she left university with her
degree, she wanted to be a journalist,
but couldn’t get a job on a newspaper,
a fact which pleases her now, since she
believes she probably would not have
written novels if she had. Instead, she
taught, and at present is tutor in English
at Macquarie University, in Sydney,
and will help to initiate a course in
creative writing.
“You can’t teach people to write.
They either can or they can’t. But you
can encourage, discuss, read manu-
scripts, and guide them. I don’t think
you can write novels well when you’re
very young, but the way English is
taught in the schools doesn’t encourage
children to w’rite creatively.”
Besides imagination and love of
words, a prerequisite for any novelist is
tenacity, and Thea Astley displays hers
for half an hour each evening after the
television set is turned off. She writes
for half an hour a night, producing 500
words each time. The writing takes nine
months, the rewriting three a decep-
tively simple routine, supplemented by
a detailed preparatory plan.
“Oh, yes, there are lots of times when
I don’t feel like going on and days
when I don’t write. But you get over
the blocks. And in this country, you
publish or perish or people forget
you.”


Is a profit as fat as a
chairman’s cigar?
TO MOST OF US, two-and-two make
four: not to an accountant. The answer
could be a matter of judgment, just
like the $1 million that could or could
not be a part of Broken Hill South’s
profits for last year or the $775,000
query in those of Western Mining Cor-
poration, depending on whether you’re
a member of the boards of directors
involved or of Cooper Brothers and Co.,
chartered accountants and auditors of
the accounts in question.
The issue at stake in the BH South
case is one of principle in the method
of treating tax allowance and not
of honesty. There are no generally
accepted accounting principles, and
there lies the trouble. For accounts
which purport to follow the phraseology
of the Companies Act and present “a
true and fair view” of the financial
position of a company can mean very
much what the directors and auditors
want them to mean.
It is perfectly reasonable of South
and WMC to want to retain all the
funds they can for their future expan-
sion by claiming the ,maximum income-
tax deductions allowable under the Act
in respect of all expenditure
including the deductions available to
mining companies for capital expendi-
ture on plant and mine development.
It is perfectly reasonable of Cooper’s
to ignore the position of South and
WMC as strongly developing mining
companies, heading for distinctly higher
profit levels in the years ahead, and
insist that they, like any other company,
make an allowance “for future taxation
which may arise as a result of the
timing differences in the depreciation
and amortisation for accounting and
income-tax purposes of capital expendi-
ture, mainly relating to plant and mine
development.” Neither view is truer
nor fairer than the other.
If anything is slightly disconcerting
about South’s position it is its persistent
history of conservative profit estimates
in April which are almost inevitably
followed by more liberal figures at
the end of the financial year. And yet,
South, like any other mining company
which is involved in successful
minerals-exploration programs has more
justification for such a history than
most. This is the point which Cooper’s
chose to ignore. Accountants have been
trying for years to establish an identi-
fiable code of “generally accepted
accounting principles.” It is unques-
tionable that what Cooper’s are
demanding of South and WMC is
widely applicable thoughout the com-
pany spectrum. Yet to generalise too
far and apply it to a mining company
which has massive deposits of minerals
proven and awaiting development is in
all probability not in the best interests
of shareholders though to inform
them of the situation is.
Because accountancy deals in figures,
most people look upon it as an exact
science. That it is not. When perfectly
honorable parties like Cooper and
South and WMC can have funda-
mental disagreements on just what a
set of figures should show it is
obviously, in the end, a complex
matter of judgment along the vague
“true and fair” lines. The field is then
wide open for honest and not-so-
honest alike. Any efforts to narrow it
down in the long run should not be
too harshly judged.
It is, after all, not unheard of for
a chairman to decide on what the
profit for the year should be and for
the accountant to fix the figures
accordingly. In a recent takeover
battle, the board of one company
suggested to its chief accountant that
an extra $120,000 of profit might help
matters, and the stocks of some
subsidiary companies were revalued to
comply with the wish. And when in
the U.K. last July GEC accountants
got down to doing the sums on the
newly acquired AEI, instead of the
$2O million profit, as promised by
AEI accountants, they came up with
a $lO million deficit and a diagnosis
of well-intentioned over-optimism.
Most accountants conceive profit as
the difference between net assets at
the beginning of the year and net
assets at the end of the year, after
allowing for dividend payments and
capital changes. In other words, the
accountant asks how much the value of
the business has increased over the
year and that is then the profit.
But, at the same time, anything that
alters the figure for net assets also
alters the profit figure.
Stocks and work in progress are the
biggest danger areas. At the end of
each year these must be valued. Get
it wrong, either by mistake or design,
and the effect on profits is dra,matic.
Say stocks amounted to $lO million
and profit forecast was $1 million. If
those stocks were overvalued by $0.5
million, or five percent, that would
mean that profits were overstated not
by five percent but 50 percent.
Actually valuing the stocks can be
a very arbitrary affair. The ground
rule is straightforward enough
“lower of cost or market value.” But
suppose one product is slow-moving.
One company may decide there isn’t
a hope of selling it at what it cost
to make and will write it down.
Another company might quite fairly
argue that although the line was slow-
moving it would in the end be sold
and should therefore be left in the
accounts at cost.
Work in progress is even more
thorny. A $2 million contract is half
completed, but things have started to
go wrong. Do you put it in the
accounts at $1 million in the hope
that things will work out, or do you
guess that it might cost another $1.5
million to complete and therefore put
it in the accounts at $0.5 million,
taking a nasty clout on the chin for
the other $0.5 million of costs already
incurred?
If you’re smart you take your
medicine now. It is always better to
be cautious than to find yourself flat
on your back in a couple of years’
time.
There is little that the auditors can
do. They have not the skill to spot
that the market for a sophisticated
piece of equipment is drying up and
the stocks are therefore overvalued,
or that a large construction project is
heading for trouble. In the end they
have to take the director’s word for
the value of stocks and work in
progress, and that word may prove
very shaky indeed.
Unfortunately, it is in the nature of
business for directors of ailing com-
panies to be perennially optimistic—a
state of mind which can spread through-
out a firm, not breeding falsehood but
bathing facts and figures in the best
possible light. When you are in trouble,
the tendency is nearly always to hope
that good times are just around the
corner. In fact, it is only the successful
who can afford to harbor hope.
One can see this most clearly in the
treatment of expenditure on research
and development. This is an investment
in the future strength of the company.
Should one therefore capitalise the
expense and put it in the balance sheet
as an asset —thereby adding to profits—
or should it simply be written off in the
year it was incurred?
It could happen that a company
embarked on an expensive research
program would soon be showing a loss
if it were to write off all its research
and development expenditure. What te
do in that situation? Is it best, with
the approval of your auditors, to begin
to capitalise some of that research
expenditure? O.r is it smarter to play
cautious, write off now, and bathe in
the profit when and if a winner comes
home? In fact, what too often happens
is that the successful company writes off
this expenditure while the unsuccessful
one, desperate for profits, capitalises up
to the hilt.
Much the same problems arise with
depreciation; it’s all a matter of judg-
ment. Companies set aside sums each
year in order to be able to replace assets
when their lifespan expires. But who

With new ‘SAXON’ by Stetson it’s the power to mark you as a man who
shuns conformity, thinks young whatever your years.
Most distinguishing among ‘SAXON’S’ many points of flattering dif-
ference is the impeccably stitched crown-—decidedly audacious but
still in perfect taste. At all leading men’s stores.
can say for certain over what number
of years a chemical plant should be
depreciated? Certainly not the auditors,
and even the directors of two separate
chemical companies would be unlikely
to agree. But if the job is done too
slowly, the companies’ fixed assets, and
therefore profits, will be artificially
inflated. However, it catches up with
you in the end. When the asset has to
be replaced, profits take a nasty knock.
Auditors would take a dim view of a
company that had been depreciating its
main assets over 15 years and suddenly
wanted to up the figure to 20 years,
thereby reducing the sum set aside each
year and increasing profits. But who will
complain that an asset is in danger of
becoming obsolescent and that deprecia-
tion ought to be speeded up —at the
expense of profits?
All these factors—stock, work in pro-
gress, research and development, depre-
ciation—can radically affect the profit
that appears in a company’s accounts,
which only shows what an illusory
thing profit really is. Indeed it is quite
possible for a company to be apparently
doing very well when it is in fact dying
on its feet.
Its factories may be going full blast,
pouring out goods the bulk of which
remain in the company warehouse
unsold. Those that are sold may not be
bringing in money, merely inflating
another figure in the net asset equation
—debtors. New production techniques
may be appearing in the industry, but
the company goes on w r riting down its
plant at the same old rate. The board
of directors may fail to recognise that
its stocks of unsold goods should be
drastically written down, that a big pro-
vision should be made against bad
debts, and that depreciation should be
speeded up, and the paper profit could
still equal that of a company down the
road whose warehouses were bare.
There would, however, be one big
difference —cash. A bare warehouse
should mean a fat bank balance. This is
why many big companies, with sophis-
ticated management accounting tech-
niques, are coming to the view that until
you can actually count it it’s not a
profit. Companies that make profits
(real profits not book profits) have
money in the bank. The flow of cash
in a company is its life blood; if you
are not constantly vigilant it can so
easily become locked up in capital
assets, debtors, or research and develop-
ment.
There are still far too many com-
panies with little idea of how the busi-
ness is progressing until the accountants
tot-up the figures at the end of the
year. But for any company worth its
salt this is an exercise in history,
for what matters is the day-to-day,
week-by-week financial control of the
business. It means regular figures from
every division on sales, stocks, debtors,
cash, and profit to be measured against
a budget for the year and against the
previous year’s performance. This will
not necessarily stop errors of judg-
ment. But it should restrict the spread
of pathological optimism.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
The endless
pursuit of
vital statistics
Watching the GNP go up in smoke how much and why?
HOW VITAL are statistics? Despite
the fact that Australia has muddled
along quite nicely with some appalling
gaps in the statistical columns, there is
increasing reason to believe that it can-
not go on doing so indefinitely. Each
week presents its batch of politicians,
policy-makers, and campaigners, ham-
strung, frustrated, and generally bogged
down, not in the traditional mass of
information, but in lack of it.
Undoubtedly the Commonwealth
Statistician has done much to improve
the situation over the past decade. His
is the unenviable task of working in
a limitless field where, although some
statistics are more vital than others,
all statistics are vital to somebody; and
where, moreover, certain vital statistics
are apparently not easily come by,
resulting in the occasional unnerving
spectacle like that of the Federal
Treasurer getting down to his budgeting
last monJ:h with, according to published
statistics, a lack of real knowledge as
to what constituted last year’s capital
inflow.
Since the mysterious “balancing item”
in the current account is traditional,
it is presumably unavoidable, though
at $493 million last year it has grown
alarmingly large. Other missing statistics,
though available for collection, have
obviously been judged not vital
enough to justify the Commonwealth
Statistician’s limited resources. That
judgment is, of course, always open to
question.
Currently, the Australian Fire Pro-
tection Association is trying to stir up
awareness of fire risks and the means of
preventing fires. Until this purely volun-
tary organisation came into being and
started collecting and collating its own
statistics, there would have been little
point in launching such a campaign, for
you cannot tackle a problem you know
next-to-nothing about. The Common-
wealth Statistician limits himself to
recording the financial juggling of the
insurance companies, and last year came
up with a picture of fire losses
(premiums paid out) in the region of
$36 million; the AFPA puts that figure
closer to $9O million. The State boards
of fire commissioners issue annual statis-
tics which, quite understandably, centre
on the comings and goings of the fire
brigades; hardly the sort of information,
however, on which to launch a national
fire-prevention campaign. For that sort
of thing you want to know whether your
main problem is electrical faults, care-
lessness, or arson. And if you’re going
to tackle arson, you want to know
whether it stems mostly from spite, mis-
chief, or insanity—as it does in the
U.S.—or fraud and financial gain. If
it’s carelessness you’re up against,
national publicity campaigns might
help. If it's arson, that very same
campaign could well backfire badly,
fanning the enthusiasms of potential
incendiaries.
You need statistics on the size and
frequency of fires related to the various
fire-protection installations before you
can build effective and fair economic
sanctions into insurance premiums. You
need to know a great deal about the
pattern of fire-prevention systems in
industry before you can assess the true
attitude of management to the problem.
You need to know about management
attitudes before you could possibly make
a decision on whether a government
fire inspectorate is called for. And
before you make any move whatsoever
it’s best to know just how much of the
gross national product is going up in
smoke each year.
Burning up the gross national product
is one problem, ensuring its growth is
another. Last week we learnt that “The
availability of finance for housing was
being affected by the lag in statistical
data that would allow for accurate
assessment of a housing demand”—
from the secretary of the Common-
wealth Department of Housing, Mr.
J. F. Nimmo. The gist of Mr. Nimmo’s
comments to the Master Builders’
Federation was that the Government
was unlikely to make forecasts of hous-
ing demand simply because it did not
have the necessary statistics on which
to base such a forecast. A day or
two earlier, Federal Treasurer Mr.
McMahon had been pointing out that
the Tariff Board could not be expected
to do its work effectively without the
most detailed statistical structure pos-
sible at its disposal but then who
can?
For the Department of Trade, Mr.
McMahon is to see about a compre-
hensive input-output table as first prior-
ity. Frequent complaints from industry
about statistical inadequacies suggest
that more detailed production and
trade figures, some more up-to-date
census reports, a Wholesale Price
Index on a less antiquated basis,
and any amount of accurate and timely
business information would be warmly
welcome, also.
And yet, as the Victorian Chamber
of Commerce has pointed out to its
members recently, it’s no good ranting
against the incompetence and indiffer-
ence of bureaucratic statisticians when
a pile of unattended questionnaires from
the Commonwealth Bureau of Census
and Statistics is yellowing at the bottom
of the ‘in’ tray. Accurate, timely, and
useful statistics depend first and last on
accurate, timely, and useful information.
STERLING
JUDGMENT DAY
NEXT MONTH will see, among other
things, the anniversary of the devalua-
tion of the pound sterling to $U.5.2.40,
and perhaps a week later the fourth
visit to London of the team from the
International Monetary Fund respon-
sible, under the leadership of Mr.
Richard Goode, for vetting Britain’s
post-devaluation strategy and success.
Clearly this is not the time to open
up again the arguments on whether or
not Australia should have devalued
also, though things were heading that
way. last week. Australia has accepted
its part, and an important one, in the
exercise to help sterling through its dog-
days. The central issue now is how
successfully the exercise is being brought
off. With a full year of efforts to look
back on, that is the question the IMF
will be seeking an answer to.
Obviously, the verdict will depend
very much on an assessment of the
trade figures. The alarmingly high
visible trade deficits earlier on in the
year narrowed down from £BO million
in July to £3O million in August—
which the IMF looks upon as reason-
able rather than good—and preliminary
figures of £29 million for September.
October, it is hoped, will show a con-
tinuation of the trend. But there are


a host of other indicators to be assessed
and trends to be predicted by the IMF.
The IMF experts, used to American
standards, have a pretty frustrating task
when they come to London. It is not
so much that the forecasting skills at
the Treasury or at the National Insti-
tute of Economic and Social Research
are so much behind America’s, although
that is true, but, more important, infor-
mation is so shaky about what is hap-
pening currently to the British economy.
At least the American forecasters know
the baseline from which they start and
the British don’t.
It is not just a question of the
current British indicators being less up
to date than the American ones,
although again this, is so, but of the
interpretation of them being so
amateurish. Looking back on the past
year, it is revealing that the most pene-
trating report on the British economy
should have come from Washington's
Brookings Institute. It is really
astonishing that it is to that report
that British ministers have since turned,
and quoted from, to tell them some-
thing about British importing habits.
Yet this is a subject that has been tor-
menting the Treasury for years. Imagine
then, the astonishment of the IMF team
when it wanted some interpretation of
what’s happening to Britain’s import
bill and found itself up against a
vacuum. The results of the work
currently being done on import propen-
sities by the Board of Trade economists
and the London business school can’t,
therefore, be published soon enough.
Current indicators, apart from two
good sets of trade figures, are not too
positive. Imports are still running at
record levels, suggesting that consumer
spending has not shrunk as much as
was hoped for. August hire-purchase
figures show a rise which may or may
not be significant enough to give the
IMF the jitters.
The British Government has always
found it difficult to keep a firm hand
on all the multiple channels of credit.
Heavy hire-purchase restrictions bear
disproportionately on the car industry,
currently claiming exports this year at
an all-time £6OO million high, and for
these reasons the Government usually
treads too lightly for the IMF’s liking.
Underlying worries about consumption
are fears that British industry is not
investing as it should. The Board of
Trade had hoped for a seven percent
increase this year in manufacturing
investment. But the revised figures for
the second quarter show almost no
change from those of the first.
Then there is the current wave of
industrial strife to contend with. The
massive Amalgamated Engineering and
Foundryworkers’ Union, supported by
the Transport Workers’ Union, has
brewed up one of the biggest industrial
crises Britain has had to face for several
years.
Obviously, a strike that temporarily
closed down so large a part of British
industry would be a heavy burden to
bear. But, equally obviously, any risks
of concessions that make the AEFU’s
MEN AND MATTERS
AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE of dispensing
chemist and druggist, Washington H.
Soul Pattinson and Co. Ltd., Mr. J. S.
(Jim) Millner has been chief spokes-
man and interpreter in the current
takeover offer for the small league
financier, Deposit and Investment
Co. Ltd., of which he is also a director.
“If someone doesn’t take Deposit and
Investment over, the future is very dim,”
said Millner last week. (The company
resumed dividends with a five percent
payment, after three years of nothing
for the shareholders, although 1968
earning rate was a reasonable enough
15.7 percent on capital.)
In his calculations, if the bid is
successful, the return on the money
paid cut for Deposit and Investment is
5.6 percent, but as Soul Pattinson is
placing 1,300,000 shares at $lO each to
finance this, use of the premium gives
it a 56 percent return on capital.
Keith McMorron
J. S. Milliter
Although the placement hikes capital
up 60 percent, the company Is com-
pletely confident that earning rate will
be improved by the acquisition.
A few years ago W. H. Soul made
an unsuccessful bid to take over Federal
Dispensaries in Malaysia, but otherwise
has not employed Its share premium to
advantage, although it may be open to
suggestions from now on.
In his own right Millner has always
been a very keen investor, even though
pharmacy is an uncommon apprentice-
ship for investment. Now' 48, he has
spent all his working life with W. H.
SouL joining in 1938 as a first-year
pharmacy apprentice. After six years
with the Eighth Army, where he ended
up as a captain and was taken
prisoner of war in Singapore, he
rejoined Soul Pattinson, became
relieving manager in 1948, branch
supervisor in 1949 and general manager
about the end of 1950. For 13 years
Millner and his wife ran a pig stud
and orchard at Carlingford, but the
district is now being subdivided.
Millner is on the directorate of
Mining Traders Ltd., which joined
with Soul Pattinson to form Minsoul
. Pty. Ltd. to take advantage of share
trading opportunities which the two
parents, basically , long-term investors,
avoided. He has been a director of
AOG since its inception, joined Dr.
Pattinson at Ghoiseul Plantations at the
beginning of this year, and the board
of Stocks and Holdings (in which he
is a substantial shareholder himself)
about six months ago.
Publicity last year that he was one
of the biggest private shareholders in
WMC put him on the mailing list of
most charities in Sydney, but he has
his favorites, with Legacy near the top
of the Est.
FURTHER REFINEMENT and
broadening of scope of the Australian
money market, in particular to facilitate
cheaper financing of finance companies’
activities, depend not so much on the
march of events, perhaps, as on the
inspiration of market practitioners in
developing the market’s full effective-
ness to suit their purposes. For instance,
it Is generally conceded by the big
finance companies that they pay rather
too much for their note and debenture
money and that it would suit their
book very nicely if, even at the risk
of borrowing a bit short to lend long,
they could make more use of the short-
term market to reduce their interest
bills. All this is rather far from the
niaddin’ mass of their customers, but
very much in the mind of Keith Mc-
Morron. who has taken over from Don
McOmish on the latter’s retirement
front the top executive post at General
Credits, after leading It out of the
wilderness and fattening It up for the
Commercial Bank of Australia to make
a full meal of earlier this year.
Mr. McMorron. like his predecessor
(apart from a short spell early on
with the Launceston Bank of Savings,
which was McOmish’s first job),
has been a CBA man all his working
life and started on the CBA treadmill
at Ml Gambier branch fresh out of
high school there about 40 years ago
(he is now 58). After playing the
country courses for ten years or so, he
spent 12 years at the Adelaide office
(he was deemed unfit for military ser-
vice), where he got his accountancy
(F-A.S.A.) and land-broker ticket.
Thence came a sort of roued-
Australia tour of the bank’s capital
city HQs. and In 1958 he landed-up
in London as deputy manager.
These are vintage years for Mc-
Morron, who this time last year
joined with D. M. Arnold of the
Wales and Derick Potts of the Com-
monwealth Trading Bank to make a
committee of three to set up the
Australian Resources Development
Bank-
Meantime, he looks back on his
spell in London as his main formative
period, with the fascination of the dis-
count market there throwing up ideas
on possible Australian applications. ,


brinkmanship look successful and other
unions’ more pacific negotiations weak-
kneed will add enormously to the
country’s future troubles.
On the other hand, the IMF is not
full of gloom that Britain is going to
default on its short-term commitments
to it; this program is all set. But the
general accord given to the Basle agree-
ment for sterling liabilities at the recent
financial meetings in Washington, not
only from the IMF, but by all major
industrial countries, shows that,
although there is little talk in these
circles, even in private (except among
the Japanese), of a possible second
devaluation of sterling, sterling is still
reckoned to be the currency that takes
the first rap in any trouble from which
the international monetary system gets
the tremors.
EXPORT ACTION
ECONOMIC LINGUISTICS
MINISTER FOR Education and
Science Mr. Malcolm Frazer believes
that Australian exports will increas-
ingly come to depend on an under-
standing of Asian languages. Mr. Archi-
bold White, managing director of St.
Regis-ACI and chairman of the national
committee for Export Week, believes,
for the .moment, that a knowledge of
Asian languages is not all that import-
ant certainly not a barrier against
going out and finding export markets—
and that there is plenty of room for
improving the coverage of economic
fundamentals in the schools first.
There is something to be said for
both sides. Mr. White is out for imme-
diate results, and for him businessmen
who while away their evenings over a
Japanese grammar or locked away in
the glass booths of the language labora-
tories would be using their time to
better advantage by doing some general
reading on Asian culture and history;
committing to memory the waves of
war and conquest that have swept
across that area and the residues of
hate and resentment they have left
behind. Australia is free from such
history, points out Mr. White, and has
a popular image and sure advantage
in Asian markets because of it.
Businessmen should seize that advan-
tage.
There is, perhaps, something a little
indolent about pointing to the multi-
plicity of Asian languages and settling
back with the comforting thought that
English is increasingly becoming the
common language of trade, even
though that is true. There are, undoubt-
edly, advantages to the drawn-out
nature of negotiating through inter-
preters. There is an even greater advan-
tage, as General de Gaulle when dealing
with the English has discovered, in
negotiating through interpreters while
being familiar with the language
none the less.
But first things first. It is quite
easy to sweep through a successful
S.-E. Asian trade tour with a com-
plete ignorance of Mandarin, Canton-
ese, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian,
or even Japanese. But it would be
of great advantage to have come to
grips with the trade structures that
exist there; and when you actually
pull off the orders and start exporting,
it is best, for the sake of future
orders, to get the labelled instructions
translated into the appropriate tongue;
that goes for advertising literature, too.
From Mr. Frazer’s point of view,
too, there is something wasteful about
all those executives struggling with
their linguaphone courses, with those
years of battling with the French
subjunctive and the declensions of
Latin nouns behind them. Their time
could now be better spent discovering,
for example, the finer points of
management and .marketing; the basic
grounding in the languages and
cultures of Asia could and should have
been done at school. Admittedly, the
widespread indifference to language
study is beginning to succumb, though
piecemeal, to geographical realities
quite apart from economic ones. Mr.
Frazer has promised to tackle the
problem further at the forthcoming
meeting of State Premiers, the Prime
Minister, and State and Common-
wealth Ministers for Education. And
since it would seem that export con-
siderations have inspired him to do
so, he might also consider how best
to improve the teaching of basic
economics in the schools. First things
first, after all.
TOURISM
CURL CURL ADIO
IN THE WORLD’S largest and fastest-
growing industry, Europe claims the
lion’s share of international tourist
receipts. But even if you have seen the
gondoliers in Venice, “you ain’t seen
nothing yet” according to the Australian
Tourist Commission, which goes on to
extol to the American public the attrac-
tions of “the brawny crews battling
waves two storeys high in a surfboat
race off Curl Curl Beach.” To a public
which is increasingly dismissing Europe
as “done,” historic treasures as a bore,
and esoteric experiences as elusive if not
legendary, the more physical charms of
Curl Curl undoubtedly have their
attraction.
Of the ATC’s $1.52 million budget
for 1967-68 (its first year of operation),
44 percent was spent in North America,
18 percent in the U.K., 11 percent in
New Zealand, 8 percent in Asia, and
4 percent in Europe; 13 percent was
spent in Australia. Last year, 253,000
tourists arrived to take a look at Aus-
tralia (a 14 percent increase over the
previous year), spending some $9O
million as they did so (a 20 percent
increase). Not a bad record, with world
tourism growing at 5 percent and tour-
ist spending at 7 percent a year. Though,
with the tourist industry neglected for
so long here, the growth is from a very
small base, with Australia’s share of
international tourist receipts standing
at only 0.64 percent of the world total
in 1966 (esoteric experiences or not,
Europe was still pulling in 62.4 percent).
To finance last year’s promotion, the
ATC received $1.5 million from the
Commonwealth and $247,848 from the
industry itself. Its concentration of
this on North America raised the num-
ber of visitors from there by 26 percent
to 42,000, with the R and R men from
Vietnam luckily giving the figure a
boost at the same time as President
Johnson was advocating “Holidays at
Home”; New Zealand’s travel restric-
tions resulted in a stunted growth rate
of two percent to 75,000; and despite
the relative paucity of promotion in
the area, the biggest growth rate was
recorded in visitors from Asia up
27 percent to 28,000. The ATC still
sees its biggest growth potential in
North America.
The ATC would like to increase its
share of international tourist receipts
to one percent by 1975, thereby adding
a very useful $3OO million to the current
account. But will Australia be able to
cope with 600,000 visitors by then?
Will international air terminals, cus-
toms, and immigration procedures,
accommodation in the cities and the
resorts, multi-lingual receptionists, and
trained guides have developed
sufficiently? Will the harsh realities of
Bondi or Curl Curl have been ironed
out in time to support the fragile
dreams so skilfully woven by the ATC
across the pages of “Harper’s” and
“Venture” and the “Saturday Review.”
We certainly ain’t seen nothing yet.
THE ORD
WATERY DREAMS
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF the Ord
River Irrigation Scheme? State and
Commonwealth authorities are pre-
paring to pour $4B million into
building a further dam and irrigation
system in an area where the principle
product, cotton, is still a profitless
proposition without the aid of Govern-
ment bounties. The bounty is to be
phased out. It has achieved its objec-
tive of Australian self-sufficiency, more
or less some 15 percent of require-
ments are for long staple cotton which
the Australian crop cannot supply
with many producers already able to
produce on a profitable basis without
further assistance, and others likely to
become so with a little more experience.
But up on the Ord they not only
need a bounty, they want it increased.
Now standing at 7.12 cents a pound,
the Ord wants it increased to 10.88
cents. Last week the farmers of Kunu-
nurra declared that they would plant
no more cotton until their demands
had been met. The Government could
well have been forgiven the malicious

SINCE 1753
thought that by the late 1970 s the
whole of the Ord crop could well be
an export surplus problem anyway.
But if you are not going to grow
cotton on the Ord just what are you
going to grow? Sorghum? Sugar?
Wheat? they all have their export
surplus problems and, anyway, can be
produced much more efficiently else-
where, just as cotton can.
The argument is that with the new
$4B million dam, all problems will be
solved, even though 20 years of experi-
ence in cotton-growing seemingly sug-
gests that the Ord will never produce
the quality comparable to farmers in
the East, let alone on world markets.
The Govern,ment is once again prepared
to give this Australian dream the
benefit of the doubt. Mr. Gorton has
announced that the cotton bounty will
be continued for another three years,
at a reducing rate, to give the
farmers on the Ord time to decide
whether they can grow cotton profit-
ably. The Government has only
recently altered the terms of the
Bounty Act so that bounty will be
paid on production and not sales to
local spinners. Constitutionally, the Act
cannot be used to give preferential
treatment to particular regions. But the
new arrangement is specific help for
the Ord, for the Ord does not start
harvesting until much of the local
spinners’ requirements have already
been satisfied by growers in the East.
The prickly problem the Ord repre-
sents is where to find a market for
expensive poor quality cotton. The
home market local spinners are
obliged to meet all their requirements
from local sources or pay an import
duty will increasingly be able to
ignore the Ord. Surplus production for
the current season is expected to be
about 35,000 bales. And almost all the
present cotton - growing areas in the
eastern States have potential for
expansion in the next few years. It
has been estimated that by the late
19705, whatever cotton is grown on the
Ord would be surplus to home demand.
The future for Ord cotton must there-
fore depend on entering yet another
fickle commodity export market. And
quite apart from questions of quality
and price there is one of politics, for
that means going into competition
with the traditional exports from
several developing countries on which
Australia depends for absorbing large
quantities of its export surpluses of
beef, mutton, and wool.
Mr. Gorton is reported to have little
personal enthusiasm for the Ord and
even less idea of how the whole
expensive scheme may be used to the
nation’s advantage. Last week he denied
that the Government had only agreed
to finance the second stage of the Ord
scheme on the understanding that
existing farmers give way to companies,
“foreign or otherwise.” But such
thoughts provide one of the few
glimmers of hope that that expensive,
watery dream may one day be proved
a national asset.

Speculator’s Diary
YOU CAN BET THAT
INVESTORS ARE
THE LAST CONSIDERED
TO THOSE WHO COMPLAIN about
the Government’s inconsistency in its
dealings with Australian companies,
there is one simple reply: at least it is
consistently inconsistent. Whenever a
decision is to be taken affecting the
welfare of shareholders, you can be
assured the Government will do what-
ever is worst for them. Look at its
uranium policy or its changing its mind
and breaking its word on the oil incen-
tive. And now it has to make up its
mind about tin. With its record, the
odds are that the Government will once
again put the investing public last in
its consideration of whether to restrict
exports or output of tin in coming
months. What the Government decides
on will be of major importance to the
Australian tin-mining industry.
The tin problem is simply this. Tin
prices on world markets have fallen
because of over-production and the
International Tin Council has bought
about as much tin as it can in its
attempt to hold the price; it now has
about £stg,l4 million worth in its stock-
pile. So last month the ITC decided
that all producers of tin should reduce
production by 2\ percent between
September and December this year. And
now some of these producers, particu-
larly Malaysia and Thailand, seem to
be putting strong pressure on Australia
to reduce its production levels, too,
even though Australia is not bound by
the agreement. This is because Australia
is not classified as a producing country,
although it exported about 4000 tons of
tin concentrates last year, while its
production of about 6000 tons of tin
metal was consumed locally. This
financial year and next year there is ,
going to be a massive rise in Australian
production, and therefore in exports,
as tw'o Tasmanian mines, Renison and
Cleveland, increase their production
significantly the former because of
much - improved recoveries, and the
latter because its development program
will be reaching full productive
capacity. And, of course, there are
plenty of other tin developments going
on all around Australia that should
contribute to further increases in total
Australian production and exports. The
fact that these mines are economic
even at prices considerably lower than
the artificially maintained world price
for tin at the moment, and that many
of the mines in Malaysia and Thailand
now being kept in business by keeping
prices up are only marginally economic,
does not affect the situation; the Aus-
tralian mines are still being asked
to curtail their production significantly
below what was anticipated for this
next year, while overseas mines are
only being asked to cut back percent
of their production levels of last year.
Now the big question is whether the
Government will yield to the political
pressure from the under-developed
countries like Malaysia and Thailand,
which desperately depend on the
revenue from tin exports for their
economic well-being, or whether it will
suggest that marginal mines overseas
should close down and allow the Aus-
tralian tin-mining industry to continue
to expand its production as a result of
the major developments on which so
much money has been spent in recent
times. There are some practical diffi-
culties in the way of the Government
restricting either exports or production.
The Government’s current inquiry
into the tin industry may well result
in them taking no action whatsoever
to restrict production or exports. And
even if the Government does decide
to take action, perhaps the current low
prices for these stocks fully discount
that risk. Nonetheless, although I’ve
been attracted to the very good re-
covery rate of Renison, and it looks
a very good buy indeed, I have finally
decided to resist the temptation until
the Government has come to a decision.
I’m doing some selling because I
will need to get as liquid as possible
within the next month in order to make
a substantial distribution when I
balance my books at the end of
November. Out went my Leighton Con-
tractors for a profit of $2l; my Pro-
duction Plant for a profit of $106; my
Tasco Downing Industries for a loss
of $l4; my Ronald J. Murray for a
profit of $43; and my MLC for a loss
of $2. By the way, I was a little dis-
appointed to see in Tasco Downing’s
annual report the fact that debtors had
jumped from $158,000 to $885,000, but
that the bad debts provision had re-
mained unaltered at $20,000. No mat-
ter how good the company’s debtors
may be, it seems a bit unreal not to
make a larger provision which would
have reduced the company’s net profit
somewhat.
All this leaves kitty at $5472.

BRIEFLY
The economy Australia’s overseas reserves dropped by
$23.8 million to $1036.5 million in September, after falls
of $l9 million in August and $l3 million in July; they
now stand at their lowest point since April, 1961.
However, the position of the trading account (current),
which is showing a $258 million deficit over these three
months, indicates a reasonably favorable capital inflow
perhaps around $B5O million a year.
September saw the seasonally adjusted figure for registered
unemployed go down by 1003 to 61,765; registered
vacancies also eased by 425 to 37,944.
Trading bank lending actually declined during
September before the Reserve Bank call-up; new and
increased overdrafts averaged $28.1 million a week,
against August’s $32.2 million and July’s $32.3 million . . .
The banks’ deposits rose by $76.8 million to
$5744.8 million in September, while loans fell by
$10.9 million to $3664.7 million.
The Australian Wool Industry Conference will attempt
to secure growers’ support for a non-satutory
marketing authority to be given a three-year trial.
The markets: There has been a fair measure of
levelling-out in many sections of the Australian share
markets, yet the general mood still looks rather indecisive.
Some rises achieved on the early trading days coidd
not be held on the Friday. Most leaders, however, look
rather firmer.
BHP, after climbing as high as $18.90 on Friday,
finished at $18.70 for a net 90 cents advance. Prominent
miners present an erratic appearance. Western Mining
gained 50 cents to hit $10.70 and Hamersley added 10
cents to close at $12.40.
Among the mining falls were Mount Isa $7.26 (down
14 cents), CRA $lB.OO (50 cents), Great Boulder
$10.90 ($1.10), King Island Scheelite $ll.lO ($1.90),
and Murphyores $1.75 (5 cents).
Indecisiveness also struck London, which had to hover
between the engineering strike threat and industry’s hopes
of a better export position.
Good car production and housing figures helped
Wall Street, as did the Vietnam peace prospects;
blue chips led the advance.
Companies: Hamersley Holdings again comes right to
the top with a brilliantly buoyant September quarter;
Indeed the first nine months of 1968 have yielded higher
earnings than the whole of 1967. After a big jump in
future tax provision, the quarter’s earnings at $5,100,000
surpassed the June period’s $3,768,000 by $1,332,000 to
establish a fresh quarterly peak; the yearly profit rate is
now $20.4 million ... A joint venture by Western
Mining Corporation and the Canadian Sherritt Gordon
Mines will explore and develop the nickeliferous laterites
in the Ora Banda-Kunanulling-Broad Arrow area
north of Kalgoorlie; WMC becomes the manager and
holds 51 percent . . . Low-grade lateritics in the
Ravensthorpe district (W.A.) are also interesting the
North Broken Hill-Pickands Mather combination . . .
Revenue of Mount Isa Mines from all sources leapt by
nearly $26 million to a record $104.5 million in 1967-68;
the cost of sales jumped by 48 percent. Copper and
silver-lead-zinc ore reserves have all shown significant
increases . . . King Island Scheelite has recommended
Peko-Wallsend’s one-for-one offer, but another move by
Consolidated Gold Fields is expected soon . . . “To
maintain liquidity,” Kathleen Investments sliced the dividend
from 25 to 15 percent . . . The Robe River iron-ore
consortium has apparently resolved its pricing difficulties
with the Japanese mills.
Both rural and building activities look very cheerful to
ARC Industries, whose July and August turnovers are
considerably ahead of last year’s and whose new orders
are going higher . . . Not all the builder-and-construction
fringe sounds so happy . . . Hardware maker R. B. Davies
went into loss again the figure $243,392 following
the previous year’s small profit and the company’s
first-ever loss $277,226 in 1965-66 . . . Timber and
building-supplies merchant George Hudson lost
$302,142, much greater than predictions; “continuing
improvement” is reported . . . Shipbuilder and engineer
Evans Deakin has got back to profitable trading once
more, although not to budgeted levels
Civil engineer McDonald Industries has sent earnings
up by a mild $11,675 to $313,302 and dividend from
4 to 5 percent; the Frances Creek iron-ore contract is
still causing trouble and more stringent conditions may
bring further losses ... A one-for-five premium issue will
help contracting group Thiess Holdings with its
merchandising and coalmining operations; below-target
output meant that Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Coal (working
Moura in Queensland) lost $570,357 to December last,
against 1966’s $1,261,262 profit.
Life means more of a struggle now for retailer
Myer Emporium, yet “great ingenuity” is expected to
produce a profit increase during the current year . . .
Wage increases are worrying David Jones, but sales
have gone higher so far in its present year . . . G. J. Coles
pushed sales up by 13.9 percent to $317.9 million for
the year to June 29, with all divisions enjoying “good
increases.”
A dividend move from 10 to 11 percent followed the
National Bank’s 20 percent profit increase ... A
predicted profit fall, from $908,942 to $521,385, came to
Australian Mercantile Land and Finance; a traditional
13 percent payout, though uncovered, was preserved.

THE LAND
Meat industry struggles
with import quotas
Meat shipment—
where if
not America?
THERE’S NO QUICK answer to the
set of problems facing the Australian
beef industry following the voluntary
cut-off in exports to the United States.
Though understandable it is no answer,
short-term anyway, to suggest, as the
Victorian Farmers’ Union did last week,
to get the Americans by the ear and
try to drum some sense into them. Mr.
McEwen has tried that before, but even
he was no match for the lobby of the
U.S. Cattlemen’s Association. It is
doubtful if “continued high-level repre-
sentation” of the Australian meat
industry would do any better. As a
matter of fact, although it might be
agreed that the U.S. might well give
us preference over some other meat-
importing countries for various reasons,
the U.S. meat industry is unlikely to be
impressed with the case as an argument
for scrapping the 1964 quota legisla-
tion itself. In fact, the U.S. industry
will be close on the heels of the incom-
ing President next year to have the
legislation tightened up to its own
advantage.
As it stands, the 1964 Act obliges the
President to apply import quotas when
U.S. imports of meat (most types,
including goat and veal, but aimed
primarily at beef and mutton in which
we are mainly interested) exceed
1045.3 million lb. (the level is deter-
mined annually). If imports during
the year look like reaching this
level by the end of it, controls are
slapped on a base level adopted (for
1968 the base quota had been fixed at
950.3 million lb.). Early Department of
Agriculture estimates for the year had
been greatly exceeded by imports before
the voluntary cuts were made and,
though it was Improbable that the
allowed maximum would be reached for
the year, the rate of importing in the
third quarter suggested that it might. In
default of a voluntary agreement to cut
back exports to the U.S. we would have
faced sharp official cuts to restrain
overall meat imports for the year to
950.3 million lb.
The over-riding importance of the
American market to the Australian
beef industry is underscored by the
fact that in 1967-68 it took about
four-fifths of our total beef exports,
that is, 441 million lb. (worth $157
million) out of a total to all overseas
markets of 564 million lb. valued at
$198.8 million. This represented a
useful increase on the previous year,
when out of total beef exports of
578.6 million lb. ($198.3 million')
the U.S. accounted for 415 million lb.
($145 million). These bare figures
don’t tell the whole story, of course,
because a wide area of the industry
here is especially geared to the pro-
vision of the special beef types and
grades acceptable to the U.S. market.
While this is a painful example of
having an export industry geared so
closely to a single market, in this case
there is no ready alternative. Even
discounting the unsuitability of
American-type exports for the British
market, this is now a shadow of its
former self as an outlet for Australian
beef. Beef exports to Britain last year
dropped sharply from 98.2 r million
lb. ($29.4 million) to 55.9 million lb.
($16.4 million). This is the lowest
they’ve been in living-memory (Britain’s
purchases of our lamb and mutton
have also dropped miserably).
Against this there are hopeful
portents from the growing appetite for
Australian meat in Japan, though at
this stage in the development of that
market it would be idle to presume
that, except perhaps on the very long
term, it will become a .major factor
in the Australian beef industry’s
export calculations. None the less,
last year Japan stepped-up its pur-
chases of Australian beef from 1.7
million lb. ($4.6 million) to 26.8
million lb. ($26.8 million), putting
it third on the list of our overseas
beef markets. The prospects in that
direction look much better in lamb
and mutton, for which Japan was our
best customer last year when it stepped-
up its purchases from 62.3 million lb.
($lO.B million) to 92.4 million lb.
($16.1 million).
As for the European market, whose
potential was recently ventilated in
New Zealand (also exploring new over-
seas meat-market alternatives to the
present preponderating American one)
in an address by meat-exporter Mr.
F. R. A. Hellaby, the trade is hard up
against the problem of catering for
special tastes because most of the meat
eaten on the Continent differs greatly
from that preferred in Britain-and the
United States. Our penetration of that
market has to date been very small.
Last year we sent less than 1000 tons
of beef to European countries (Sweden,
taking 440 tons, was by far the biggest
customer, with Italy next at 147 tons)
and New Zealand didn’t do all that
much better. However, Mr. Hellaby
wasn’t unhopeful of the prospects in
Europe, with its rising living standards-
projecting a growth jnass market for
beef, including manufacturing beef.
The best bet in Europe looks to be
Italy, whose imports of beef have risen
dramatically in recent years, that is
(including veal) from 95,000 tons in
1962 to 326,000 tons last year. The
Food and Agriculture Organisation ex-
pects this to rise to nearly half a
million tons in the next few years to
supplement the considerable and in-
creasing local production. Apparently
Italy wants to reduce its high degree
of dependence on Argentina for imports
of beef, and this could well open up
the field for Australia and New Zealand.
However, in Europe in general, and
Italy in particular, the price factor is
against us, and one exporter damaged
our reputation for beef in Italy a few
years ago with an inferior product.
This led to a reduction in our beef
exports to that country and is something
that will have to be repaired.

NEW LINES IN MERINOS
WE CONFESS to having only lately
discovered that there are no fewer than
eight original breeds of Merino sheep.
Our Australian Merinos are derived
from only one of them, the Spanish
Merino, which exists in two types,
migratory (trashumante) and non-
migratory (estante). And the latter
group occurs in several distinct varieties
in its homeland to this day. The other
seven breeds are the Portuguese, Arles,
Apulian, Carapelle, Sopravissana,
Vojvodina, and Turkish Merinos. Some
of these still flourish in large numbers;
others are now dying out and in definite
danger of being lost for ever. Only
about 300 of the Carapelle, for instance,
are surviving around the river of the
same name in Southern Italy.
The Merino in Portugal is particu-

:ence Street, Sydney, 2000.20304,
larly interesting. Over the centuries it
has been selected into three types —the
White, the Black, and the Merino of
Beira Baixa. The White, numbering
about two million, is the country’s chief
wool-producer. It is a sturdy, robust
animal, which cuts a heavy fleece of
fine wool. The Black is kept as a triple-
purpose sheep. It is small, extremely
hardy, and said to be resistant to photo-
sensitisation. The national animal-
breeding centre in Portugal is presently
trying to develop this strain as the
country’s meat-producer. Portugal is the
only country in the world with a sizable
flock of Black Merinos, having over a
million of them. Spain and Tunisia also
have some, and the Carapelle is a Black
breed. The third type of Portuguese
Merino, like ours, is derived from the
migratory Spanish Merino, but is kept
by the Portuguese as a milk-producer.
They are found mainly in the Castelo
Branco district of Portugal, where the
number would total around a quarter
of a million.
It is interesting to note that while
we have tended to regard our Merinos
as poor milkers and have attributed their
low reproductive performance partly to
this, several of the original breeds are
used for milk production. Thus, in its
homeland, the Spanish Merino is some-
times milked, and the Arles Merino of
the South of France supplies some of
the milk for their famous roquefort
cheese. The Italians also use their
Merinos, especially the Sopravissana, as
a source of milk for making various
delectable cheeses.
Some of these exotic breeds also seem
to have a high twinning rate, compared
to the Australian Merino. However, it
has been shown fairly recently that the
genes for prolificacy exist among our
strains and that high twinning rates can
be readily attained by selection for this
character, which is, indeed, highly herit-
able. Similarly, we now know that the
milking capacity of our Merinos is
ample, provided they are fed well
enough. Our studmasters did a remark-
ably good job in raising the cut per
head, which is generally much higher
than that of the European Merinos, and
in improving the quality of the wool,
but they must accept responsibility for
suppressing the breed’s natural high fer-
tility and perhaps to some extent its
milking capacity. We have come to
regret the loss of these attributes in these
days, which call for high stocking rates
and when we are often able to graze our
Merinos on improved pastures.
Because of the cardinal importance
to us of the Merino as a fine-wool
producer we forget that it is just
another breed on the Iberian Penin-
sula, which is home range to at least
two dozen other breeds representing
medium-fine, coarse, and carpet-wool
sheep. Only about one-third of the
total sheep population in this part of
the world are Merinos, and, as we have
already seen, even they are not always
kept for their wool but for their meat
or milk. Generally speaking, sheep
husbandry around the world is practised
as a triple-purpose enterprise. Now that
the future of our wool industry is not
as rosy as we might wish it to be,
possibly the time has come when we
should remember this fact and take a
less narrow look at what the sheep of
the world in all their rich variety have
to offer us.
Portents of change and some swing
away from wool are already apparent
in this erstwhile wool kingdom. The
proportion of Merinos in the national
flock is steadily declining. Efforts are
being made to improve their meat
characteristics. Mutton and lamb,
although less prominent on the menus
of Australians nowadays, are appearing
more frequently on the dining tables
of people in some other countries. The
taste for sheep meat has now definitely
spread beyond the English, New
Zealanders, South Africans, and Middle-
Easterners. The market for sheep-,milk
cheeses is also growing beyond the
traditional districts in Italy, Greece,
France, and other places around the
Mediterranean. Even here we now
have a sheep cheese farm or two
making do with Border Leicester-
Merino cross ewes.
Research presently being conducted
on feeding sheep with protein concen-
trates hints that in future sheep produc-
tion will become intensified along the
lines of poultry and pig production.
Under these conditions experimental
batches of lambs have matched chickens
in efficiency of feed conversion, that is,
they have gained a pound liveweight
for each pound of feed consumed.
Such forms of sheep production may
well call for animals with attributes
entirely different from those exhibited
by any of our present breeds. Our
quarantine restrictions, necessary though
they may be, should not be allowed to
restrict our thinking. Methods can and
should be devised immediately whereby
stock can be introduced without the
risk of bringing in disease.
To help us direct our search for
new blood when the opportunity comes,
the Food and Agriculture Organisation
has recently published a book through
the Commonwealth Agricultural
Bureau. It is entitled “The Sheep
Breeds of the Mediterranean,” by
I. L. Mason. The author has catalogued
no fewer than 175 breeds and varieties,
and compiled 157 photographs to illus-
trate them. His notes about each are
arranged in an orderly pattern and
provide a brief history, a short descrip-
tion of management practices, and
relevant production data such as
average fleece weight, spinning count,
bodyweight, and milk yield. One regrets
that he has not included information
where available concerning disease
resistance, adaptation to specific
environments, and so on, but the book
is fascinating, nevertheless, and has the
ring of authenticity about it. At $6.90
it is rather expensive, but the photos
would make it costly to print. Copies
can be obtained from the C.A.B.

YOURS FOR FURTHER
CONSIDERATION:
A SOLICITOUS SEC
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
PRESUMABLY THE STATES of
Australia will follow the suggestion of
Federal Treasurer McMahon and give
“consideration” to the establishment of
Securities and Exchange Commissions
throughout Australia. They have given
it “consideration” before.
Problems of achieving uniformity of
legislation in every State provide a
major problem for those believing in
the desirability of an SEC on the
United States’ lines. Development of
the uniform Companies Acts in each
State is regarded as a much less oner-
ous means of achieving investor protec-
tion and certainly a less expensive
one. The SEC in the United States is
probably the largest single . employer
of the legal profession and for all its
size and power does not seem to
achieve much in the way of protection
against determined exploiters.
It appears to boil down to the
fact that preventive legislation is
preferable in curbing the activities of
the wheelers and dealers, but is impos-
sible to create. It is difficult to imagine
legislation that will prevent unscrupu-
lous exploitation of unprofessional
investors.
In business circles it is fairly clear
that an SEC is unwanted. Certainly the
Stock Exchanges believe that an outside
organisation could not match the pro-
tection afforded investors in shares by
Stock Exchange rules and existing
company legislation. That is probably
true, but against it is the fact that
share investment represents only one
avenue of the people’s savings.
Sydney investment banker John
Marks has for years been pressing for
a central secretariat to police and
approve prospectuses and the like,
presently being approved and policed in
each State. Such a secretariat, without
moving outside the present company
legislation, could well provide adequate
protection for the investor and may
well be in a position to prevent
exploitation on a Federal scale and
supplant the apparent need for a pos-
sibly unwieldy SEC. Mr. Marks’
Federal-State secretariat would not be
called on to predict the outcome of
any investment; neither would an SEC
be in a position to guarantee the per-
formance of any investment transaction
that it approved.
In favor of the secretariat scheme is
that marketing of corporate securities is
more or less national these days. The
secretariat as proposed by Mr. Marks
would examine prospectuses before
their release to the public to assess
their fairness or otherwise at the time
of signing by directors. This would
deter the unscrupulous, since their
scheme for raising funds would be
subject to close scrutiny before it was
issued. As a sideline, a central bureau
of this nature would be an invaluable
statistical source for the Treasury,
possibly providing capital-requirement
trends sufficiently early to prevent
sudden realisation that the economic
situation is not as thought. Moreover,
the secretariat, provided it gained
sufficient authority, could provide an
advisory service to Treasury to augment
the Reserve Bank’s role.
Mr. McMahon, apparently off the
cuff, said that his Treasury would
investigate the suggestion made by a
Perth Liberal, Mr. Cleaver. It remains
to see if the Treasury can come up
with a workable arrangement covering
protection for the investor without
incurring . a huge administration
burden. Perhaps the first step will be
to establish the long-needed central
company secretariat to cover the Com-
panies Acts in the various States with
a central policing and approving body.
MELBOURNE EXCHANGE
BLIGHTED GRANDEUR
THE STOCK EXCHANGE of Mel-
bourne moved to its palatial new
premises at 351 Collins Street with
appropriate ceremony and a minimum
of fuss last week, but, although the
unrivalled facilities moved into action
like clockwork, acoustics played the
very devil on the trading floor, which
covers an area of 800 square feet.
To start with, the bell for the com-
mencement of trading was barely
audible. That wasn’t as bad perhaps
as when, for all their shouting, opera-
tors often couldn’t catch the ears of
the chalkies to register their bids, a
matter which some managed to rectify
by moving farther away from the
boards. Oddly enough, the bidding was
best heard in the public gallery, which,
unlike the one at the Sydney Exchange,
isn’t closed in. There also seemed to
be some difficulty among operators of
hearing their firms called, though, as
the week wore on, the resonance of
voices miraculously improved.
A more intractable problem was the
longer distance (about three times as
long) between the boards and the
brokers’ booths, compared with that in
the old Exchange, which complicated
THE CHARTIST SAYS: AC I appeared to be a sound technical buy in
June, 1967, at price levels of about $3.18, with the first move to approximately
$3.60 where it encountered resistance selling. It fell sharply at the time of the
U.K. devaluation and prices subsequently continued to move in a sideways
congestion area above a long-term support line. However, it should be closely
watched for any deterioration in the short term, as any fall in price to about
$2.20 (adjusted for current issue) would suggest that a downside target of
approximately $l.BO would be possible. Last sale price on 17/10/68 $2.52.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
the problem of communication no end,
even to the point of some toying with
the idea of using walkie-talkie sets
between operators and their telephone
clerks. In any case, telephone clerks
are situated so far from the boards
their eyesight is strained to see them,
especially the second board, at which
they look side-on, as it were. This
suggested some trade could be done
in binoculars before long, though some
relief from this particular problem will
come with the introduction of the
inquiry service, which will give most
of the information required in brokers’
offices without calling up the telephone
clerks. Later on, some time next year
on present calculations, a computer
service will be available. Another
solution could be to move the telephone
booths much nearer the boards as they
are in Sydney, but this would, of course,
eat into the spaciousness of the trading
floor and reduce the grandeur of its
image.
For all that, the new Exchange has
a winner in its public relations facilities
(not to speak of the sumptuous accom-
modation provided for the committee
and chairman, who do infinitely better
than the rather crowded typists).
Public relations have not been the
Exchange’s strong suit in recent years,
which may be the fault of the present
chairman’s reticence or simply that the
committee and officers have been so
busy setting up the new home. From
now on, however, all is set to give the
public even better treatment than the
ultra-publicity-conscious New York
Stock Exchange provides in its rather
cramped rooms above the floor in
Wall Street. The display floors and
theatrette are truly magnificent, and
only a short, carpeted stairway up from
Collins Street.
CRESTKNIT
TEXTILE STATUS
IT SHOWS SOMETHING for the
enhanced status of textile shares when
those of a garment manufacturer can
command a yield rating of under 4
percent as Crestknit, the Melbourne-
based firm, are at the moment, following
an increase from $447,102 to a record
$552,687 in profit and lifting the
dividend from 12£ to 15 percent for
1967-68. While not gainsaying that this
company’s growth prospects are as
good as any in its line of business
here, it would appear that the present
price of around $2 a share (about
double its low earlier this year) pretty
well looks after the growth potential
for the time being now that reserves
have been liberally capitalised and
more equity added by way of a new
issue.
Usually, something bigger than a
2.2 - times earnings - cover would be
looked for in a share now yielding only
3.8 on dividend especially one in the
clothing business. The chairman gave
the impression at the meeting in Mel-
bourne last week that the group was
running into difficulties in its export
markets (its exports last year came to
about $200,000) for precisely the same
reason as its Asian competitors are now
finding their sales in the Australian
market restricted, that is high tariffs
and, as recently announced, quantitative
import restrictions. Obviously, Crest-
knit’s future in the export field is going
to depend more on the company’s
high quality and design image, but
the going seems likely to be pretty
tough. Tougher at any rate than seems
likely in the home market, where the
Government is looking after it very
well and will be asked to do more
when the industry puts its case (now
being prepared) for higher protective
duties to the Tariff Board next year.
NATIONAL BANK
PICKING UP LOST TIME
HAVING MADE a rather late start
in the savings-bank field —if not in
hire purchase than most other Aus-
tralian trading banks, the National Bank
of Australasia has been making up for
lost time in the past few years under
the powerful wing of Dr. Coombs’
more liberal credit policies (the bank
acquired a 40 percent interest in Cus-
tom Credit in 1954 and this has been
maintained; it was the last trading
bank to get its own savings bank,
which was established in 1962).
The profit increase of $923,606 in
the year to June last was overshadowed
by that of the previous year, but the
essence of the story is that last year’s
profit of $5,540,258 was well over
double that of three years earlier. So
it was about time, shareholders will
agree, that something was done about
the dividend, which is now raised to
11 percent from the 10 percent since
the capital was increased in 1964,
shortly after the cancellation of the
uncalled liability on the shares.
JAMES STEDMAN
BENEFIT OF MERGER
THE CONFECTIONER James Sted-
man is having a fresh independent
valuation this year of the assets of the
group, now including the Melbourne
chocolate-maker Hoadley’s, and will be
able to apply the surplus to clean up
the goodwill in consolidated accounts.
Besides its disappointing profit of
$696,000 on trading (which was down
23 percent on the combined profits of
the then-separate organisations in 1967),
the company did make a capital profit of
$197,000 by disposing of listed shares
in its big portfolio, and there will be
more profit from this source in 1968-69.

knows that the going is not to be easy,
for it faces intense competition and
higher costs for raw materials, labor,
and services. But combined purchasing
power, and improvement of production
techniques by the exchange of technical
know-how, give Stedman additional
strength. Directors say that the benefits
of the merger should show up this year.
It apparently came as a surprise to
Hoadley’s that its chocolate confection-
ery turnover was greater than that of
Nestles. The latter handles Sweetacres’
distribution under long-term agreement,
but Hoadley’s continue to handle their
own. Hoadley’s sales increased by more
than 10 percent last year, although
industry sales of chocolate-component
confectionery, in which category 90 per-
cent of Hoadley’s production falls,
dropped 2\ percent. The general mana-
ger, Mr. A. G. Hoadley, told share-
holders at the annual meeting of
Stedman that the fastest-growing section
of the chocolate confectionery industry
is the candy-bar field, of which Hoad-
ley’s accounts for one-third.
TWO HOTELS
NOT ALWAYS LIQUID
WITH THE Reserve Bank clamping
down a bit on credit liquidity, it
threatens to be more a problem for
companies than it was during the liberal
final days of Mr. Phillips’ distinguished
predecessor, when credit was to be had
for the asking. For Southern Cross
Properties, which rents its hotel at the
top of Bourke Street to Intercontinen-
tal Hotels (for $1.2 million a year
under an agreement renegotiated last
year), liquidity, so it seems, has been
the main stumbling block in paying a
dividend even though it might be
thought that paucity of earnings was
a bigger one. In fact, after five suc-
cessive loss years it only managed to
come out on the right side in 1965-66,
since when it has gradually edged up
its earnings to 8.4 percent for the latest
year after 5.4 percent in 1966-67. Any-
how, it is now to pay its first dividend
and, strangely, gives for the reason the
fact that it has succeeded in making a
satisfactory arrangement for the under-
writing of a $1.2 million loan that
matured at the end of last month.
Things are looking up in the hotel
business at the other end of Melbourne
also, where Federal Hotels holds sway,
a sway which hasn’t done shareholders
of that company much good in recent
years. At the meeting last week, the
chairman, Mr. C. A. Edwards, spoke
of a 16 percent increase in revenue for
the group in the first two months of
the current year, though it seems that
the main thanks for this must go to
the patrons of the White Horse Inn in
Hawthorn, which was recently leased
from the Carlton and United Breweries.
Federal has at last clinched its deal
with Hotel Holdings Ltd., which gives
it a 49 percent interest in that com-
pany, but so far hasn’t succeeded in its
negotiations with the Tasmanian
Government to establish a hotel and
casino at Wrest Point, though all is
ready to go when the talks are con-
sumated.
TURNER INDUSTRIES
PLETHORA OF PROBLEMS
FOR A kaleidoscope of problems
besetting industrial companies it would
be hard to better Mr. Raynes Dickson’s
rundown in the report of Melbourne-
based Turner Industries, which reported
a drop of $206,352 to $83,982 in profit
and a cutback from 4 to 3 percent in
the dividend for 1967-68. First there
was the drought in Victoria and South
Australia to which the group’s sales
are particularly oriented. That, sur-
prisingly enough, was not the main
devil of the company’s piece last year,
because overall its sales eased by only
2.5 percent (from $7,140,000 to
$6,856,000), which goes to show that
in its hardware and hand tools the
group has valuable offsets to the motor-
mower side, which, with so little grass
to cut, were the big flop in southern
States sales last year. What really upset
the applecart was cost increases which,
of course, had to be spread to cover the
slow-moving motor-mower operation
without having the opportunity to let
off steam through the safety valve of
prices.
With so few people buying mowers
and so many firms trying to sell them,
cut-throat competition was the order
of the day in a year when wages bills
were woefully unaccommodating. Talk-
ing of that, Mr. Dickson seemed to
think it was going to wreck Australia’s
hopes of developing increased sales of
manufactured goods in overseas mar-
kets if wages are to continue to in-
crease simply by the drop of an
Arbitration Commission’s hat. What
is more, with the labor market as tight
as a drum at present, it is obvious that
the pressure for over-award wages is
going to increase wages bills even more.
Now the drought is over, Turner will
no longer have to carry the motor-
mower side as a lame duck and, with
progress well in hand in consolidating
the group’s activities at Nunawading
to provide greater economies, the hope
is for a much better year this time
round. So the chances are that, at
their knockdown price of 26 cents, the
$1 shares will revive, slowly perhaps,
in the coming year even though the
yield of 5.1 percent on the reduced
dividend is not going to get investors
looking for income rushing in.

FIELDS ARE GREEN
AND CLOSE FOR
CONSOLIDATED GOLD
WITH A LIFT in earnings from 19c
per share to 25c, coupled with a lift
in dividend from 6.6 c to 11c per share,
Consolidated Gold Fields is bringing
home the bacon. Along with Peko-
Wallsend (its rival in the bidding for
King Island Scheelite), it is adding to
the small number of companies where
good increases in earnings can be
expected not in three or five years’ time
but in the very foreseeable future.
CGFA’s profits for the current year
look like being even better and there
does not appear to be any likelihood
that the company will have to call
on shareholders for more funds to
finance its commitments in regard to
the Mount Lyell issue, as the parent
company of the group had liquid funds
of $8.5 million at balance date, while
current liabilities stood at $4.8 million.
Last year’s earnings saw a good
increase in the contribution made by
Bellambi Coal, following improved per-
formance by that company’s longwall
mining unit. Although the unit had
given the group considerable trouble,
and indeed is still considered to be
unsatisfactory for the conditions pecu-
liar to the Bellambi Colliery, it is in
fact maintaining a level of output
higher than that originally intended.
During the year Bellambi was occupied
in filling export coal orders to Japan,
and in November last year the com-
pany’s contractual commitment was
increased to a minimum of 3.8 million
tons a year, with a slight increase in
prices. The current year will give the
company the benefit of these higher
prices for a full 12 months and, in
addition to this, higher coal production
should ensure another good increase
in profit for this subsidiary.
The group should also be the bene-
ficiary this year of higher earnings
from Associated Minerals, following a
full year’s operation from the very
large dredge and concentrating plant
which was commissioned in April this
year to work that company’s leases
on South Stradbroke Island. The plant
itself was not intended to increase
overall production significantly, but
profit should benefit from the closing
of several smaller and less efficient
plants. Nevertheless, the company’s
output so far this year is well ahead
of last year’s figures and, of course,
profits this year will not have to bear
the commissioning costs which the com-
pany incurred last year.

times smaller than Australia with a population 9 times
bigger.
My capital city is the largest, noisiest, brightest boom-
ingest city in the world. My rate of economic growth
is greater than that of any industrialized nation in the
West. I am a mixture of both East and West. A
contrast of old and new, Orient and Occident,
tradition and tomorrow.
I am Japan and there is no one like me but I am
neither mysterious nor inscrutable. I am an avid
consumer of the world's goods. I am Australia's
biggest customer. I am an industrious purveyor of
the world's needs. I am its largest shipbuilder, its
second largest maker of electronic equipment, its third
maker of steel. My precision products have turned
"Made in Japan" into a proud label. I have developed
man-made fibers that are miracles in a miraculous
field. 1 am helping build Southeast Asia and lending
technical know-how to Europe.
I am growth. More, I am growth through trade.
Surrounded by seas and poor in every resource but
my people's ambition and ingenuity, my blood
lines and life lines are international trade lines.
My trading companies are working partners of
every country in the free world. And Mitsui is
my largest trading company. It has roots in
every major outlet. It imports, exports,engages
in cooperative ventures and investments,
handles three-cornered or many-sided trade
problems wherever business is being
done.
I am Japan. I am the tradingest
country going. And I am
moving. With Mitsui.
With the
world.

profit from this source should also
show a significant improvement
after its loss of $911,000 for the year
to June last. This loss was incurred
largely due to the company’s inability
to achieve a satisfactory tin recovery
rate and the overall rate for the
year worked out at 41.4 percent. Since
the close of the year the rate has
been considerably improved, reaching
a peak of 64 percent for the four weeks
ended August 28. Following its loss
last year, the company will benefit from
the lack of taxation for at least this
current year and perhaps longer. With
tin prices holding up well, a consider-
able improvement is expected from
this subsidiary; a profit of over
$1,000,000 would not be surprising.
Better profits can also be expected
from Mount Lyell Mining, which is
57 percent owned. Last year’s profit
from this subsidiary fell slightly due
to a lower head-grade of ore treated,
as well as higher costs, but the current
year will contain the benefits of a full
12 months of the higher crushing
capacity which was installed during
the Christmas shut-down. This
increased capacity should at least
offset the effects of the slightly lower
average copper price, but the develop-
ment plans involved in opening up
an underground mine may well tend
to hold back the full benefits of
higher production fro,m this subsidiary.
The really big increase in earnings
from Mount Lyell will not come until
after 1973, when the initial production
from the current $3O million expan-
sion program begin to flow.
On the iron-ore side, the Mount
Goldsworthy venture, in which Consoli-
dated Gold Fields has a one-third
interest, again gave a substantial boost
to overall profitability, with Gold
Fields’ portion of profit rising from
$l.l million to $4 million, reflecting
an increase in profit per ton from
$2.2 to $3. During the current year,
shipments will probably be maintained
at around 4 million tons. Now that
the venture is operating at capacity
levels, profit per ton can be expected
to improve with increased efficiency
as well as reduced interest charges
and other overheads, quite apart from
the benefits of spot sales, which last
year amounted to 500,000 tons. The
Goldsworthy venture negotiated a new
contract in May for 11 million tons
to be shipped at the rate of some
1.2 million tons per year, and this
contract, together with contracts
previously held, will .mean annual ship-
ping rate of about 4.2 million tons.
The current year should also see
better figures from Lake View and
Star Limited, although this company
is only owned 16 percent by the group,
and profits of Consolidated Gold Fields
benefit only to the extent that Lake
View and Star increases its dividend.
Overall, the prospects for the group
are such that it should withstand the

Selling for just over 30 times this year’s
earnings, and perhaps 25 times next
year’s likely earnings, CGFA seems
fairly well matched with its opponents
in the King Island offer, Peko-Wallsend,
which is selling for 29 times last year’s

next year’s earnings (based on an
estimated 50 cents per share).
Behind the
balance sheets
BRICKWORKS' GIFTS
ARE RARE, BUT
COME IN BIG LUMPS
NO COMPANY LIKES setting a profit
pace it cannot maintain or improve
upon. Brickworks Ltd., the Sydney brick
and pipe manufacturer which is still
essentially a family concern, tucked
away perhaps as much as $1 million to
various provisions, before coming up
with a profit for the year to June 30,
1968, of $1,372,000 an acceptable
and repeatable 18 percent advance on
1967.
Provision of $300,000 for long-service
leave and retirement benefits (where
$40,000 was enough in each of the
previous two years); $300,000 for
doubtful debts (bringing the provision
to $702,504, almost 50 percent of total
debtors); $500,000 for plant replace-
ment (now totally $1,380,000, for no
particular project); $lOO,OOO for stock
fluctuations and contingencies (though
this appears in the balance sheet as
investment fluctuation and contingen-
cies), are all signs of an extraordinary
affluence.
However, to be consistent in their
accounting, Brickworks should treat
their plant replacement and stock
(investment) fluctuation and contingen-
cies as appropriations of profit if in
the balance sheet they form part of
shareholders’ funds. Otherwise, if they
are provisions before declaration of net
profit, they should correspondingly
appear as liabilities or deductions from
assets, in the balance sheet. The
“working profit” as shown in the
accompanying table, representing
profit before depreciation and tax and
before the stock fluctuation and plant
replacement figures, gives a better idea
of the jump in profits in the latest
year, as well as in 1964-65, although it
still plays down the profit acceleration.
The big run-down in stocks from
$752,000 to $291,000 over the latest
year illustrates the demand for the
company’s products, texture, face,
common and moulded bricks, and of
vitrified clay pipes. Sales of bricks and
pipes were a record, due partly to the

According to the Federal Treasurer,
private expenditure on housing last
year increased by 11 percent, and on
other building and construction by 20
percent. (Main market for Brickworks’
bricks is presumably private housing.)
The value of all new buildings approved
in the two States where the company
operates, was:
Sm. N.S.W. Qld.
1965- 490 228
1966- 597 219
1967- 689 269
Approvals in July and August of the
current year, as a guide to the future
trend, were up 30 percent in N.S.W.
and 14 percent in Queensland.
Higher interest rates just decreed by
the Reserve Bank must necessarily retard
building activity in the immediate
future, although the growing population
compounded by the increase in people
of marriageable age guarantee longer-
term market growth.
Brickworks sells about 1J million
bricks a week in Sydney, out of a total
metropolitan sales of about 8-9 million
a week. The plant at Wallgrove (near
St. Marys, strategically placed to handle
the bulk of Sydney’s growth) has a
present weekly capacity of 1J million
bricks. The second kiln came into opera-
tion there in September, 1963, and the
third (costing $1.2 million) in June,
1965. No further expansion is possible,
so the company is constructing a com-
pletely new plant 400 yards away, at a
cost of $2.5 million, which will have a
capacity of 500,000 bricks a week, and
will begin production in April, 1969.
The company has 2000 acres in the
Wallgrove area, and based on current
production capacity, reserves of brick-
making land there were enough to
supply clay and shale to the company’s
Sydney yards for at least 200 years.
The company claims it is harassed by
State and local Government authorities
concerning its Sydney brickyards. Land
at St. Peters, traditionally used for
brickmaking since the turn of the cen-
tury, has been the subject of several
changes of Government mind, and on
present decision, will be partly resumed
for a county road. This will seriously
affect four yards. It will, therefore, be
uneconomic to operate the pits, and
St. Peters’ yards will eventually have
to be replaced. As far as Brickworks is
concerned this is three or four years off.
Brickworks went to Brisbane about
ten years ago, and has invested more
than $4 million on its Rochedale plant,
where it owns 600 acres. Production
began in September 1968 from a new
texture brick plant which cost S2J
million, and consists of a tunnel kiln
with capacity of 400,000 bricks a week.
The company anticipated the trend to
bricks as building material in Brisbane,
but usage of bricks there is still well
below Adelaide, for instance.

maximum capacity through 1967-68. A
new tunnel kiln which drastically
reduces wastage began producing at the
end of July, 1967, and had to be run.
It added significantly to profits, and
in the current year will make fuller
contribution.
The company has spent considerable
sums converting plant to oil firing to
comply with the Department of
Health’s Clean Air Division, but its
experience has been that smoke can
be cut down but the quality of bricks
suffers. It threw out a challenge to the
State Brickworks, often accused by
Brickworks of unfair competition, to
cut down its own smoke emission.
A private placement of 750,000 shares
at total premium of $6.20 each, raised
$5.8 million cash after balance date, and
will hoist share premium reserve to
almost $7 million, and ordinary capital
to SSJ million. The very great premium
involved eliminates any problem in
maintaining earning rate on the
greater capital, even if most of the
money raised, which will finance new
plant, is not fully income producing.
Although current ratio declined con-
siderably in the year under review
(before the share placement), the com-
pany was very well heeled, and the canny
but ultra-conservative directors have
over $2 million invested in listed and
other companies (mainly interest-
bearing securities with a leading public
company), while at the same time hav-
ing borrowed $5.5 million in debentures.
(In 1967 it raised $4 million debentures
in a private placement for the new
Punchbowl tunnel kiln, the extruded
brickplant at Rochedale, and extensions
and mechanisation at Eastwood.) The
remaining $1.5 million of debenture
money was raised in 1964.
In 1961, Brickworks made a private
placement, at a premium, of 250,000
$2 shares. It has been company policy
that shareholders either get a bonus or
cash issues at par, and directors consider
it would be insulting to offer share-
holders an issue at a premium. The last
benefit shareholders received was a one-
for-two note issue in 1960, which con-
verted to shares at par in 1965, and a
one-for-one bonus in 1958. The 15 per-
cent dividend has been the rate paid
since 1961.
Directors disregard the trend to
smaller denominations of shares, although
the shares, now approaching the $lO
mark, are getting beyond the reach of
the modest investor, who still thinks in
terms of a minimum of 100 shares,
although 50 is a marketable parcel up
to $lO. They are currently at near-record
levels, although still below the net tan-
gible asset backing of $10.28 —on a con-
servative valuation—for each $2 share,
and are inherently worth at least that
figure, even if shareholders have to
await the directors’ pleasure to dispense
largesse in infrequent but big lumps
with a small yield on the investment in
the meantime. The board must have
sufficient control of the issued capital
to discount the possibility of a takeover,
or it could not afford to be so over-
bearing.

Security analysis
A BEVY OF NEW MEN
MAKE THE PACE
AT F. T. WIMBLES
IN MY RARE MOMENTS of relaxa-
tion I often think security analysts
could spend a little less time peering at
balance-sheet ratios and concentrate
more upon the people behind the
figures. There is a natural tendency to
analyse profit figures and the product
range to the exclusion of all else, yet
people make companies, and any com-
pany is only as good as its manage-
ment. The wise investor will bet on
management’s drive and ability as well
as the key financial ratios. A good
example of a company whose balance
sheet tells only half the story is
F. T. Wimble, the Sydney-based
printing-ink manufacturer, and mer-
chandiser of printing machinery and
supplies. Wimble was 100 years old in
1967, and ten years ago was the leader
in the Australian printing-ink and sup-
plies industry, which, at an annual
growth rate of 6 percent, has been
expanding faster than the gross national
product. In the 1960 s Wimble went to
sleep while the world and 20-odd com-
petitors passed it by. Profits and earning
rate on capital declined steadily from
1958-59, culminating in the $lB,OOO net
profit for 1966-67, which represented
1.7 percent on capital. This year net
profit has shot back to $lOO,OOO and
the earning rate is now 15.9 percent.
Recoveries of such magnitude don’t
come from some mystical economic
force expanding and contracting the
market place willy-nilly. They are the
product of good men and the type of
hard work that doesn’t think about
the clock. In Wimble’s case the recovery
coincides with the appointment of 40-
year-old C. D. Wood as chief executive
in July, 1967 (exactly 100 years after
F. T. Wimble commenced business in
Melbourne), and the subsequent intro-
duction of youthful new blood in the
shape of seven executives with an
average age of 36. C. D. Wood came

to Wimble after ten years’ executive
and administrative service with 3M
Company and a period spent as Aus-
tralian sales and marketing manager for
the bakeries group of George Weston
Foods. His background in marketing
has meant the introduction of an
aggressive marketing policy aimed at
doubling group turnover in five years, a
five-fold increase in group profit before
tax and depreciation in the same
period, and at restoring Wimble to its
previous position as industry leader.
The team of key executives has been
strengthened by the appointment of a
group technical manager (C. M. D.
Shaw, 39), group financial controller
(F. T. Hook, 31), and group marketing
manager (F. V. Tynan, 39). Other
important posts filled by young execu-
tives are the national manager of
Wimble’s associate company, Algraphy
Wimble (D. O. Levido, 35), and the
group’s State managers in Victoria,
Queensland, and South Australia. In
addition, operations in New Zealand,
which provide about 10 percent of
group profit, have been reorganised
under the leadership of a general
manager appointed last year. The
emphasis on new blood has not been
confined solely to top management. The
company has brought in technically
qualified salesmen and is planning a
cadet scheme for commencement in
November this year to train ink tech-
nicians. All this frenetic activity in just
over a year has paid off handsomely,
and the result is even more remarkable
when it is realised that virtually all
the 1967-68 profit was earned in the
latter half of the year.
Total labor force at present is just
over 300, spread through 11 plants
in Australia and New Zealand. The
group’s base is a 7f-acre complex at
Rydalmere (Sydney), with smaller
manufacturing plants and warehouses in
each Australian mainland State capital
and New Zealand’s four principal
cities. Two specialised ink subsidiaries
(Intaglio and Commonwealth Inks and
Coatings) have separate production
facilities in Sydney.
I am advised that on a breakdown
of group profit by the three divisions,
about 50 percent comes from inks, with
machinery providing about 20 percent,
and the remaining 30 percent being
received from the merchandising of
supplies to the printing and packaging
industries. In its traditional line of
printing inks, Wimble has about 28 to
30 percent of the Australian industry,
with the proportion rising to 33 to 40
percent in New South Wales. The com-
pany’s product range covers letterpress,
litho, gravure, flexographical, silk
screen, and metal decorating inks for
both printers and packaging manufac-
turers. I have always been fascinated
by the special mystique surrounding the
world of printing and the products used
in that world. I suppose it is because
a combination of paper, ink, machine,
and the printer’s personal craft records

This is one section of Sydney’s skyline which owes much to the use of
coppermetals in unusual and interesting applications. The buildings
concerned are the State Government Block and Qantas’ new Wentworth Hotel.
Over 900 tons of copper and copper alloys were involved in the State Office
Block, including 200 tons of pre-oxidised brass used in the cladding of its
exterior columns. About 250 tons of bronze sections were used in the window
frames and electrically-operated sliding doors. Another interesting feature
seen in the left foreground is a 56 ft. diameter copper-clad fountain. This
also doubles as a cooling medium for the massive air-conditioning system.
The Wentworth Hotel’s two storey copper awning is unique in the world. It
has a surface area of nearly 4,000 square feet of smooth copper, with vertical
ridges and recesses 8 inches wide for its full width of 130 feet. This is matched
with a copper parapet around the front top of the building and there is also a
copper fascia above the Bligh Street entrance to the rear.
Both these fine buildings are splendid examples of the potential for copper-
metals wherever beauty and originality of design must combine with perma-
nence and practical utility.

for posterity what we said and did here
(one can even hope that posterity will
cast a gracious eye upon this column!).
The fascination is also felt by the pro-
duct manufacturers who are continually
researching and seeking improvements
in inks for the whole spectrum of print-
ing and packaging. Wimble is par-
ticularly fortunate in its strong techni-
cal group and the valuable licence
agreement with the United States com-
pany, Fred’k H. Levey, the world’s
largest ink makers.
In merchandising, the company-
supplies the printing and packaging
industries with sundry materials and
accessories, including bookbinders'
cloth, rules, glue, brushes, pastes,
plates, and chemicals. Agencies are held
for many well-known overseas manu-
facturers, among the more important
being Columbian Carbon, Goodyear
Tyre & Rubber, and Whiley, the U.K.
manufacturer of hot-press stamping
foils. The links with major overseas
suppliers ensure that the range mar-
keted by Wimble in Australia and New
Zealand has the advantage of the latest
techniques and know-how.
Machinery of every conceivable
description is obtained from Italy,
Sweden, Denmark, the United King-
dom, Germany, and the U.S.A. The
machines cover printing presses, book-
binding equipment, labelling machines,
tag presses, stereotyping, electrotyping,
and threading and knotting .machines
for use in graphic arts. Apart from
developments in inks, Wimble sees its
biggest future potential in Whiley foils
(U.K.), Columbian Carbon, Inter-
national Chemicals (U.S.A.), Netting
(U.K.) cutting and creasing rules for
package manufacture, and Algraphy
lithoplates and chemicals, together
with certain diversifications now being
finalised.
The industry is highly competitive
and investors shouldn’t expect spec-
tacular results overnight. But Wimble
now has the people, in addition to the
products, to get back on top, and I
forecast increasing earnings and good
capital growth in the next few years.

growth, and prepared to back people,
Wimble is a good stock. Even the ink

What’sa
company like
Rank Xerox
know about
duplicating?
Plenty! They released the 3600.
It took great skill to
develop the 3600 a machine
that combines high-speed
duplicating with the ease of
copying. That produces 3600
perfect copies every hour.
Without masters. With
economy. But the real skill
of Rank Xerox lies in knowing
how to make the best use of
your copier —the most
efficient use of your
duplicator. Their
representative is the man
best equipped to advise you.
Your methods could be too
slow. Too expensive. Or too
much trouble. The Rank Xerox
man will know. And he’ll tell
you whether you're ready
for the new 3600. Or for any
of the Rank Xerox machines
that can produce a few
copies or as many as 3600 per
hour. That way he’ll keep
you a jump ahead.
Always.
When you have a new 3600 wo
gets around fast! 3600 copies
an hour, fast. Or a perfect
copy every second. On bond
paper. Without masters. At a
lower cost. And all copies
can be automatically sorted,
150 to a bin, with a total of
50 bins available.

HOW OLEG'S MAN
FAILED THEM BUT
KEPT HIS JOB
By NANCY KEESING
Three Cheers for the Paraclete. Thomas
Keneally. Angus & Robertson. $3.50.
BY NOW SO MUCH has been written
of Thomas Keneally that most Aus-
tralians know of him as the young
(born 1935) white hope of Aust. Lit.—
that he is novelist, playwright, teacher,
and now university lecturer, winner of
prizes, and critic, and that he trained
for the priesthood but did not take
orders.
Of his novel “Bring Larks and
Heroes” he has said: “I’m fascinated by
the working or absence of conscience in
people.” He has also said: “My
personality was poisoned by good old
Irish theology. Some can take
compromises but the poor blokes who
pursue sanctity according to the Irish—
they’re the ones who have the col-
lapses.” (Quoted by L. J. Clancy in
“Meanjin,” March 1968.) One of the
subsidiary themes in “Bring Larks and
Heroes” was, as Clancy points out,
“a criticism of the primitive nature of
Irish Catholicism.” It is a major theme,
stated in thoroughly up-to-date terms,
of “Three Cheers for the Paraclete.”
I have said very recently in this
journal that much Catholic fiction
nowadays “runs perilously close to the
tiresome for non-Catholic readers.” I
did not find this book tiresome, because
of Keneally’s whole approach and
because it is too crackly (in its prose)
and prickly (in its argument and
characters) for this emotion. But I did,
since the blurb and advance criticism
had prepared me, try to read it in a
special way.
The novel concerns the dilemmas of
priests, some of whom are ordained
and secure, one rebellious, one the un-
fortunate victim of human circum-
stance other dilemmas are ex-
perienced by the trainee priest, an
inquiring nun, and a beautiful, talented,
and tragically mismarried woman. The
book’s centre is a seminary staffed by
men of Irish names and approaches.
Though not, I think, ever identified,
the book’s city is Sydney.
My religion has had no ordained
(i.e., anointed e.g., having mystical
authority) priests since the year 70 of
this era. So, rightly or wrongly, in
experimental mood, I made a conscious
effort to read a number of basic Catho-
lic, and indeed Christian, assumptions
out of the novel. I tried to view the
problems here as un-mystical and
human ones of decency, honesty, kind-
ness, apprehension of other people’s
needs.
The central figure of the book is
Dr. (or Father) Maitland a brilliant
historian trained at the seminary who
has returned from a period in Europe
to teach at his alma mater. While he
was overseas, Maitland, using a
pseudonym, had written and published,
without benefit of Church sanction, a
best-selling book concerned with theo-
logical semantics. Many of his argu-
ments seem like heresy to many of his
co-religionists back home. Its author
can scarcely be a comfortable hawk
among the seminary sparrows; although
the seminarians are able, some very
clever men in their own fields.
Maitland is impulsive. He is forth-
right rather than tactful, often brash
rather than devious. He is not impelled
by any great warmth for people,
although he is not a cold man. In
many ways he is a many-sided snob. He
constantly offends his colleagues, often
without intending offence. Superficially,
one may see him as socially and intel-
lectually honest. But is he?
Suppose a different setting a com-
parable group of men. Let us say an
Australia-wide edible oils combine. Call
it “Oleo.” “Oleo” has its own farms,
factories, laboratories, and employs
thousands of people directly and
indirectly. It has great responsibilities
and considerable tradition. Among its
products are cooking oil and margarine.
“Oleo,” we imagine, employs an ar,my
of scientists and chooses young cadets
for in-service training at universities. It
conducts research and sends bright
young men overseas for experience.
Maitland, in my suppositious set-
ting, is a brilliant, company-trained
science graduate. Although the company
prefers to employ conservative young
professional men from Great Public
Schools, Maitland is a High School
product from a classically Labor Party-
oriented family.
This Maitland is sent to England
to work for his Ph.D. His period of
pure research results in a thesis dem-
onstrating some damaging, though mar-
ginally harmful, properties of vegetable
oils. OK by “Oleo.” But then, pseu-
donymously, he rewrites his thesis as a
popular book, which the embattled
dairy industry hails with delight. Mait-
land, returning to headquarters, finds
his book a hot topic. He keeps mum.
But when asked to be company spokes-
man in a newspaper controversy he
must refuse without stating his full
reasons, and his refusal, understandably,
gives offence. His known Labor sym-
pathies sometimes make for awkward-
ness with his colleagues, too.
One of the side plots in “Three
Cheers for the Paraclete” concerns the
seriously disturbed student, Hurst.
Hurst’s fantasies are of castration of
himself or of his teachers. The. sight
of table knives tortures him. Father
Costello, Hurst’s confessor (and about
to be elected a Bishop), consistently
and persistently, and only partly from
obtuseness, fails to understand poor
Hurst’s neurosis. In “Oleo” I imagine
Hurst as a company cadet who has
severe emotional problems but who
dreads seeking outside medical help
because only the physically and emo-
tionally fit can qualify for permanent
“Oleo” employment. Dramatically,
Maitland realises Hurst’s predicament
and its urgency and notes that the com-
pany medical officer is, from mixed
motives, not treating the boy correctly.
Maitland arranges alternative medical
care for Hurst, but fails to follow up
his well-intentioned deed effectively.
Hurst makes a frightened symbolic
attack and then a suicide bid.
“Dr. Egan, Nolan’s assistant in the
teaching of moral theology, defensor
vinculi defender of the bond in
the archbishop’s marriage court . . .”
I have supposed Egan to be the “Oleo”
legal officer. He is a dry but likable
middle-aged stick who has an awk-
ward love affair which, for a complica-
tion of reasons, drastically interferes
with his probity and, worse, with his
efficiency worse yet, with “Oleo’s”
whole structure. Maitland, bound to
secrecy, condones a foolish, doomed
action by Egan, his friend. The action
leads to Egan’s downfall but one of
his superiors might have helped.
Again, Maitland discovers that “Oleo”
Keneally...in terms of the
marketplace
has investments in a concern whose
business morals are dubious. He uses
his still fairly junior position to expose
the crooked concern before he consults
his senior colleagues. They are honest.
They forgive him, but his manner of
procedure has embarrassed them
dreadfully.
What have we left after these sup-
positions? We have a group of execu-
tives one is an Archbishop-Managing
Director —and so on down the hierarchy.
These men are only as able and as
successful in dealing with human
problems as their training and basic
imagination allow them to be. In the
book, these men, although priestly, are
as fallible as the next man in many
crises, but because they are priestly most
“next men” expect them to have extra-
ordinary perceptions and solutions.
As to Maitland, he emerges as not
basically honest. Given his temperament
and outside loyalties, and despite his
skills and abilities and interests, he ought
not to be working for this company.
By the time Maitland fully realises
his incompatibility he is too settled
in his ways and interests to work any-

where else. Moreover “Oleo,” because
he has so much inside knowledge of
their business, cannot really afford to
let him go. That is, Maitland is pen-
alised but will be allowed to retain his
priestly functions.
If I have made Thomas Keneally
sound very much like Tony Morphett,
a novelist who, vis-a-vis Keneally, is
underrated, my attempt has been delib-
erate. I ad,mire Keneally as a splendid
master of prose, of humor, of con-
struction, of dramatic situation, of
argument, and of character. I think this
new book is good, but less outstandingly
interesting than its predecessor.
I do not think Keneally, or his work,
or the motives of his characters should
be assessed only by quasi-mystical
standards. Of course, this is an over-
simplified view—ridiculously so because
whatever an outsider’s notion of the
Catholic priesthood and its beliefs, the
fact remains that Keneally’s people, in
orders or secular, are inextricably bound
by Catholic views and history. Of
course, their difficulties and solutions
and even the nature of their consciences
remain part of an ancient and slow-to-
alter mystique. But when argument is
presented in the form of a novel and
not as a theological tract, then it can
validly be regarded in terms of the
novel in terms of the market place.
SPLENDID "LAST POST"
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Vital Decade. Ten Years of
Australian Art and Letters. Selected
by Geoffrey Dutton and Max Harris.
Sun Books. $9.75.
THIS IS a sumptuously produced
volume containing a selection of prose,
verse, and artwork published in the
quarterly “Australian Letters” over the
decade from 1957 to 1967. It is a
splendid Last Post for a .magazine
which has now ceased publication.
“Australian Letters” was always
somewhat of an exotic among ■ Aus-
tralian literary magazines. It was one
of the least political of our quarterlies
and its appearances were unpredictable
and maverick, an irregular penguin. I
never really liked its layout, which
somehow seemed scrappy, or its shiny
paper, which was necessary, however, to
reproduce its excellent series of poets
and artists, where a group of poems by
one poet was illustrated by a group of
drawings or paintings by the one artist.
I am certain that entire sets of “Aus-
tralian Letters” will in future years
become very valuable collectors’ pieces
for this alone.
“The Vital Decade” has an extensive
selectibn from this series. There is
Nolan illustrating Randolph Stow,
Donald Friend illustrating Douglas
Stewart, Russell Drysdale illustrating
David Campbell, Charles Blackman
illustrating Shaw Neilson, and other
successful collaborations include Arthur
Boyd with Max Harris, Lawrence Daws
with Geoffrey Dutton, and Tom Gleg-
horn with Ray Mathew. Some of these
reproductions are superb. Most of the
illustrations have a casual air which is
not found in more formal collections of
Australian art, and the collection is all
the more interesting for this.
The volume begins with some critical
articles. There is a well-balanced assess-
ment of Brennan by Frank Kermode.
Richard Aldington writes pleasingly if
not deeply about Kenneth Slessor.
Rosemary Wighton has an amusing
account of C. J. Dennis and “The
Gadfly,” and Randolph Stow writes
nostalgically of that unique Australian
institution “Cole’s Funny Picture Book.”
A selection of poems follows this and
includes poetry by David Campbell,
Judith Wright, and many others. The
two poems by Joan Mas are worth
noting. I feel her poetry has been
underrated at a ti,me when romantic,
short, intense poems are apt to be
ignored. Roland Robinson’s “The
Cradle” indicates that he is perhaps
becoming tighter and more conversa-
tional without losing his essential
romanticism.
I remember someone saying a few
years ago that the Ern Malley affair
silenced a whole generation of would-
be Australian surrealistic and apocalyp-
tic writers. I feel this is not the case.
Any surrealist with talent would have
beaten his way through, if he had
existed. It did not stop Randolph Stow
ten or fifteen years later. In fact, it
has probably helped him, because in
poems such as “The Land’s Meaning”
one can detect the odd echo of the
unflappable Ern in lines such as
and a skin-colored surf of sandhills
jumped the horizon
and swamped me. I was
bushed for forty years.
I keep thinking of those immortal
lines “In the twenty-fifth year of my
age/I find myself to be a dromedary/
That has run short of water/Between
one oasis and the next mirage.”
There are some interesting prose
contributions, including Hal Porter’s
delightful description of “South Gipps-
land and its Towns” illustrated with
very charming drawings by himself.
There are short stories by Patrick
White, Barry Oakley, and James
Preston. Alister Kershaw in an article
explains why he is an expatriate. Ker-
shaw is a magnificent broadcaster, but
on paper, and certainly in this article
lacks the brilliant dryness imparted by
his voice. Patrick White in an answer
to Kershaw explains why he returned
to Australia after so many years of
absence in Europe.
White writes movingly of his panic
at the Australian “exaltation of the
average” which numbed him on his
return but in the end created a void
in which he had to write. He says,
“The worlds of plants and music may
never have revealed themselves had I
sat talking brilliantly to Alister Ker-
shaw over a pernod on the Left Bank.
Possibly all art flowers more readily
in silence . . . Stripped of almost
everything that I had considered
desirable and necessary, I began to try.
Writing, which had meant the practice
of an art by a polished mind in
civilised surroundings, became a
struggle to create completely fresh
forms out of the rocks and sticks of
words. I began to see things for the
first time. Even the boredom and
frustration presented avenues for end-
less exploration; even the ugliness, the
bags and iron of Australian life,
acquired a meaning.”
It is perhaps the irony of our
situation that by the very publication
of such finely produced volumes as
“The Vital Decade” we are breaching
that very silence in which people like
Patrick White are able to create. I
personally do not feel that the decade
from 1957 to 1967 has been the vital
decade in Australian art and writing.
It has been vital, but not seminal in
the way in which the 1890 s were with
the emergence of Streeton, Roberts,
Brennan,- Lawson, and Paterson and
also the 1940 s with the emergence of
Judith Wright, Hope, Stewart, Boyd,
Nolan, Drysdale, and Friend, and the
consolidation of Slessor and Fitzgerald.
Nor can we afford to be compla-
cent. During the 1890 s our dissent was
mainly concerned with financial
inequality, and Australia pioneered
many reforms before the rest of the
world. Dissent is now in danger of
becoming a form of social snobbery,
and follows overseas blueprints without
really throwing up any original ideas
of its own. (For instance, in a country
with so many male migrants I think
there should be a crusade to legalise
prostitution.) I myself am a bit sick of
the constant sneering at suburbia and
suburbanites, and White, I am afraid,
must bear some of the blame for having
triggered this off. Max Harris is able
to write a fine and beautiful poem such
as “At the Circus,” but in his column
every Saturday mixes cultural PR with
attacks on the RSL in a way that
lowers standards. What has happened
is that since the days of Lawson and
Paterson serious Australian writers have
lost much of their contact with the
public. The artist has become isolated.
There is now an attempt to bridge
this gap with PR. One hopes this will
succeed, but without too much trend-
setting and without muddying the
“silence” which White speaks of as the
source of creativity.

Ever since the first tape-recorded
newspaper interviews began appearing
verbatim in the London “Observer”
in the ’fifties, a book like “L’Amante
Anglaise” became inevitable. There
has already been a tape-recorded play
(“Krapp’s Last Tape”), and contem-
porary music now also .makes much use
of pre-recording. It’s in the air, so to
speak.
Marguerite Duras is one of the
big three of the new wave of French
novelists and is best known for her
film script “Hiroshima Mon Amour.”
Her style has always been the
simplest within the contemporary
school. She has been paring away all
surplus verbiage for years. In fact,
her “Andante Cantabile” had reached
a point of basic language that was,
at times, almost childlike. Her skill
was to convey depths of subtlety
between the unspoken lines rather than
in the lines themselves. She uses much
the same technique here.
A murder has been committed, one
of those dreadfully insane, apparently
unmotivated, acts. The body of the
unidentified woman has been cut up
into neat butcher-sized pieces and
dropped from a viaduct, a serving at
a time, on to the tops of passing
trains. That is, all but the head, which
is never found.
Someone who intends to write a book
about the crime has a tape-recorder
going in a cafe where the extraordinary
affair is being discussed. Claire, the (as
yet unknown) murderess, and her hus-
band are present and a policeman
whose plain clothes fool no one.
Suspicion is converging on this district:
after some ingenious studies of railway
timetables, the Paris “prefecture de la
Seine” has located here the only via-
duct in the country under which all
the trains could have passed.
The initial tape contains the woman’s
calm confession and the still calmer
arrest; the subsequent ones the com-
ments of the various participants, includ-
ing those of the murderess herself, on
the contents of the other tapes. So that
gradually, through building up layers of
quite ordinary conversation, without any
descriptive passages at all, a clear pic-
ture begins to emerge.
This is perhaps best expressed in
the novel when the would-be author
explains to the cafe-owner. “And when
what you’ve said has given that even-
ing back its real depth and dimensions
we can let the tape recite back what it
remembers and the reader can take
your place.” The cafe-owner asks,
“How about the difference between
what I know and what I say what
will you do about that?” And the author
answers, “That’s the part of the book
the reader has to supply for himself.
It exists in any book.”
And to his own astonishment and
discomfort, the reader will probably
discover that what he is supplying is a
continuous transference of his initial
horror at the murderess and pity for
the victim into pity for the murderess
and horror at the forces which have
made the helpless, gentle Claire so
utterly and quietly mad. The victim
turns out to be Claire’s cousin and
housekeeper, Marie-Therese, a “great
lump of meat,” a fat animalic deaf-
mute interested only in eating and
sleeping, who was said to have gone
to Paris.
The book begins to pose all kinds of
moral questions which the author is
apparently anxious to imply but for
obvious reasons prefers to leave unspeci-
fied. Was Claire genuinely the murderess
or was she just as much the victim?
Were not those who have, through lack
of insight and imagination, helped to
drive her over the border just as guilty?
Is it true, as an old sweeping and too-
comfortable theory goes, that the victim
often invites or is almost co-responsible
for his or her own murder? And if
society condones some kinds of killing,
why not others? How much difference
is there between Marie-Therese carving
the meat for a stew and Claire carving
up: a dead Marie-Therese? Is not the
line drawn between one type of slaughter
and another the most arbitrary of all
arbitrary man-made laws?
Above all, it is, of course, a study
of madness, revealing how even the
craziest and most revolting act can
somewhere be seen to have some logic
behind it, however crazy this logic
may be. Among the many implied
suggestions, for instance, is that Claire
was killing not merely Marie-Therese
but also, by act-transference, her own
husband. Her action could be seen
as a last desperate attempt to break
through “to the other side,” to-
establish contact with the real world,
which, ironically, she achieves only at
the moment when she is about to be
safely shut away from it for ever.
Well translated by Barbara Bray,
this novel breaks new ground not only
technically but also in the way it
uncovers abysses from which the mind
automatically shuts itself off. It is not
for everyone. It is cool, sane, detached,
holding the reader at a clinical distance
at the same time as it dares him to
look down and draw his own con-
clusions.
Duras . ..after “Hiroshima”


THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Putting the sell into sounds
for the “unlidded ear”
By SANDRA HALL
“THE ADVERTISING mentality” is
one of those fashionable intellectual
catchphrases you can’t help distrusting
slightly. But after two days’ exposure
to the 38th conference of the Federa-
tion of Commercial Broadcasters, all
doubt has vanished. The last vestige
crept away quietly on the second day
during a short Press conference given by
the American Miles David, president of
the Radio Advertising Bureau in New
York, specially imported for the con-
ference by the FACB. (A mastery
of initials is essential at a conference
like this.)
In the soft, eloquent voice he had
been using to some considerable effect
for the past hour, Mr. David said:
“We are beginning to find out that the
sound medium may be more powerful
than sight plus sound media like tele-
vision. Psychologists are saying this,
because the eyes can be turned off —
sight is selective. But the ear has no
lid. It never turns off, even when
you’re asleep. We’d like to find out if
messages transmitted by sound have a
deeper, more lasting effect.”
Didn’t that, someone asked, impose
a great responsibility on the broad-
caster? Mr. David paused. “Oh, we’re
aware of our responsibility. But after
all, we do live or die—not by the open-
ing of an ear, but the switching of a
knob.” Full stop.
His organisation exists in order to
research and supply information on the
effects and efficiency of radio advertis-
ing to stations and their advertisers,
and a similar organisation, ARAB
(surely the most exotic set of initials
around), was set up in Australia several
years ago. ARAB, as everyone kept
pointing out modestly, is still very
much RAB’s Little Brother, but some
of its formidably comprehensive pub-
lications were on display in the foyer
of the conference room, which, inci-
dentally, was decorated with the
legend “Do Unto Radio As You Would
Have Radio Do Unto You—Amen.”
Predictably, the listening habits of the
housewife, (defined as the “person in the
the household who is responsible for the
purchase of most household items”)
comes in for some especially detailed
analysis—subtitle in one booklet is
headed with gleeful indulgence “The
Australian Housewife (She Loves Her
Radio),” and one. extract urges adver-
tisers, “Spend $lOOO in Adelaide radio
in one week and yoiu can reach 81.8
percent of the vital housewife market.
More important, you can reach each
housewife with your selling message
12.7 times.”
There are also statistics devoted to
“Total Impacts,” “Net Cumulative
Reach,” and “Average Frequency,” and
something called “Imagery Transfer,”
which “happens when a radio com-
mercial revives in the mind of the
listener a commercial previously seen
in another medium.”
Mr. David’s particular message con-
tained in a speech titled “Radio in
the Soaring ’Seventies. Get Ready to
Pioneer” was showmanship (“In the
era of super-sophistication and third-
Australian
commercial
broadcasting
executives at their
conference in
Sydney last week
...“do unto
radio as you would
have radio do
to you”
generation computers, we are not to
forget that it is showmanship that will
sell products in the year 2000”), and,
as they say in the business, his was a
knockout performance.
His first topic was management, and,
of course, he had a joke to order —about
a nervous passenger in an aircraft the
engines of which have just failed. He
turns desperately to the man in the
next seat —a priest calmly reading his
Bible. “Father, what’ll we do?”
“What do you expect me to do? I’m
in sales, not management.” And Mr.
David hoped everybody here still
regarded themselves as being in sales.
More jokes followed, with a sock-it-
to-me frequency “Laugh In” would
have welcomed. There were color slides
specially prepared for Australia, and
tapes of American radio commercials
extraordinarily disarming in their use
of humor and lavish in their use of
performers, such as Jack Benny and
Stan Freberg.
Freberg had been commissioned by
the radio industry to do a series of
commercials in the form of vignettes—
one of them about the New York black-
out in 1965, which went this way:
“Yeah, we pulled the plug. A little
promotional stunt for a client of ours—
the transistor radio industry. The people
with radios knew what was going on.
Everybody else just stood around look-
ing at their candles. Remember the
Johnstown flood. That was our work.
We did that for the rowboat industry.”
Next came a slide showing a diagram
of “our particular battle plan” in the
business of influencing retail stores to
advertise by radio (“The arrows show
us putting the pressure on every category
of executive, because the advertising
director is rarely the sole strategy
decision-maker.”), and some suggested
promotional gimmicks.
“I don’t know what you do here on
New Year’s Eve, but in New York we
get bombed, and that includes the
agency community. So what do we do.
We get vacuum jugs containing Bloody
Marys to the agencies the day after
New Year. The salesman is in there—
ministering to the prospect’s hangover.”
Admittedly, the Federation didn’t
place much emphasis on the word
“commercial” during the rest of the
conference. The Postmaster-General,
Mr. Hulme, praised radio for intensify-
ing its coverage of current affairs during
the year and increasing its hours of
service, and Myles Wright, chairman
of the Broadcasting Control Board,
applauded the local country commercial
operation as “one of the greatest of the
many values gained from Australia’s
dual broadcasting system.”
But he also touched on the dangers
of playing the ratings game too assidu-
ously, and recalled his own apprehension
when the Post Office and the Control
Board amended the broadcasting stan-
dards to permit the use of the telephone
for two-way programs.
“I said then that I hoped the new
rule would not lead to the spectacle of
stations madly chasing one another like
the lemmings of Norway, all pursuing
the same course to destruction—not
destruction of the stations, certainly,
but of the value of the program concept.
It happened, or almost happened, with
‘Top 40,’ of course, and I rather hoped
it wouldn’t happen again.
“In the capital cities, most have tried
two-way radio, and at one time I


thought the lemmings had it. Now, how-
ever, it does seem that program formats
have settled down, and there are many
discernible differences.”
Wright blamed failures of selective
programming on the incorrect use of
research by advertisers. “I refer to the
sort of advertiser who says, ‘I always
buy the top station in the market,’
whether or not that station delivers the
type of audience he really needs to sell
his product. I think too many stations
tend to go along with the numbers
game, to the disadvantage of the
industry.” Some stations, he continued,
looked over their shoulders at the com-
petition, rather than ahead at their own
goals.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
SUDDEN DISASTER
Daphne in Cottage D. Stephen Levi.
Ensemble Theatre, Sydney.
THERE ARE moments in the first half
when the whole thing looks rather
promising: a two-character psychological
study looks like ideal material for
staging at the Ensemble. Daphne seems
at first merely absent-minded, clumsy,
and tensely neurotic. Her guest, Joe, is
“well-bred,” relaxed, and straightfor-
ward. The dialogue is mildly Jewish-
funny, and there are undertones of
various sorts: the sound-system gives us
“Billy Boy” on the xylophone at an
almost subliminal volume level while
Daphne talks about her son; she lapses
into moments of unexpected fury, and
though she begins by offering Joe a kiss,
she ends the embrace in a struggle,
tearing his shirt and screeching demands
that he “get the hell out of here.” By
this time you’ve got a fairly clear
impression that something is wrong, and
hints that Daphne has been “somewhere”
long enough to learn the Bible by heart
tend to support this.
The second section of the play intensi-
fies the mood. Daphne calls Joe back
several hours later. She has drunk a
good deal of “straight gin, no ice,” and
you’re now in no doubt that raging
alcoholism is not the least of her prob-
lems. While it is clear that she needs
Joe to talk to, it also begins to appear
that he has a problem of his own tucked
away. All this sort of thing works
extremely well at the Ensemble—you
peer in at close range on the two actors,
trying to decide whether Judith Fisher’s
bright, contorted smiles are the result
of the actress’ own tension, or whether
they represent Daphne’s. You cannot be
sure whether Peter Sumner’s drily
attractive manner belongs to the man
personally, or whether he has assumed
it as Joe’s careful, superficial control
over inner insecurity.
Since the nature of the characters’
psychological reality is also the centre
of the play’s suspense, you find yourself
watching the performances with minute
attention, waiting for clues. And, in
fact, the actors are remarkably well
cast —perhaps Miss Fisher could afford
to be occasionally a little more relaxed
at the beginning, while Mr. Sumner
could allow the odd hint of insecurity
to penetrate his pleasant, “straight-man”
surface—if only to prove that they are
performances. When I point out that
Daphne was originally played last year
by Sandy Dennis, and that the play
might well have been written for her,
anyone who has seen her film perform-
ances will know exactly what to expect.
Unfortunately, the last scene is a
disaster. The two problems are badly
revealed (and turn out to be real
“human drama” television series non-
sense), the bottom drops out of the
play, and the whole thing suddenly
looks like a terrible waste of time. If
only the author had kept the problems
to himself, leaving us with the relatively
subtle shading of the first part of the
play, and the quietly down-beat ending
—a failed attempt at communication.

Garden”...a tawdry affair in
suburbia
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
ALBEE IN STRIPLAND
Everything In The Garden. Edward
Albee. Russell Street Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
MY FIRST impression of this play was
that Albee had rewritten Bunuel’s
“Belle de Jour” as a vehicle for
Blondie and Dagwood. For, on stage,
rendered in comic-strip hard-edge, we
have a surburban American mother
working as a part-time prostitute while
her poor, dull, decent husband looks
pitifully at the audience, bleating
“husbands are a sorry lot.” However,
on doing my homework, I learned that
Albee had, in fact, rewritten a play by
the late Giles Cooper, first produced
in London just seven years ago. The
theme is Mr. Cooper’s, the plot is Mr.
Cooper’s, and the jokes, such as they
are, are Mr. Cooper’s. But after some
Midas-touching-up of the dialogue, the
success has been Mr. Albee’s.
Under the circumstances, the Mel-
bourne Theatre Company might have
found it in their hearts to give Mr.
Cooper some of the credit, if not in
the program proper, at least among
the acknowledgements (Miss
Claire’s jewellery by Dunklings; Mr.
Albee’s play by Giles Cooper) but
the word, apparently, is mum.
However, there’s some rough justice
in this, as it allows Albee to be hoisted
on Cooper’s petard. For the play is a
tawdry affair, totally lacking in what
have always been Albee’s principal
ingredients energy and mystery.
There’s no real attack in this critique
of American values, and none of the
menacing ambiguities of “A Delicate
Balance.”
Albee/Cooper’s Blondie and Dagwood
live in a $40,000 home they can’t afford,
and have affluent friends they don’t
like. Only by the most careful budgeting
can they remain members of the
Country Club, where the main topics
of conversation are the nastiness of
Negroes and the pushiness of Jews. But
the problems of keeping up with the
Woodleys is taking its toll on the
Bumsteads, and when Blondie is propo-
sitioned by a chic, sinister Madam she
is only momentarily affronted. Soon
Blondie is hustling every afternoon and
Dagwood is the surprised recipient of
parcels full of money, which he rational-
ises as coming from some anonymous
benefactor.
While Dagwood’s tiny brain struggles
to cope with the magnitude of the
revelations that follow, a character fond
of Pirandellian asides to the audience
gate-crashes the gathering. He deduces
what has been going on, attempts to
exit laughing, and is promptly mur-
dered by the guests. If all this sounds
lively and diverting, it is mainly
through compression of the plot.
In fact, the play is surprisingly
slow, obvious, and uninventive, and one
gets the distinct feeling that Albee’s
disapproval of mammon is offset by his
love of good box-office. Could it be
that the man who wrote “Zoo Story”
has become a hustler himself?
The only redeeming features of a
stereotyped production were the per-
formances of Alan Hopgood and Robin
Ramsay. Where most of the company
seemed uneasy and out of place in this
play, Ramsay (as the Pirandellian
chorus) was relaxed and accomplished,
once removed from the text’s idiocies.
Alan Hopgood (Albee’s Bumstead)
captured the comic-strip idiom perfectly.
He walked as though Chic Young had
drawn him and emitted his terse lines
in neat talk balloons.

ONE FOR THE OLDIES
Marriages Are Made In Heaven. Lloyd
Thomson, Nancy and Albert Arlen.
Theatre Players, Canberra.
IF YOU ARE 40-plus and you wonder
from time to time why they don’t write


musicals the way they used to; if you
have fond memories of “Maid Of The
Mountains,” “Rose Marie,” “The Desert
Song,” “The Merry Widow,” or “Belle
Of New York”; if most of your favorite
songs are in Francis and Day’s Popular
and Community Song Book take
heart: the old-time musical is not dead,
but alive and well as well as can be
expected after all these years, anyhow
in Canberra, where a new musical by
the writers of “The Sentimental Bloke”
is having its world premiere season.
The plot is, for a musical, simplicity
itself. Martha Sterling is a widow,
whose two children wish to marry
children of two of her suitors. Both the
suitors refuse to let their children marry
while Martha remains single (their
motivation is not very clear, but no
matter). Martha turns both suitors
down, and enlists the aid of a marriage
bureau to find someone who suits her
better. Impasse for the suitors and the
children: impending disaster for Martha
when the bureau turns up someone who
is less than satisfactory. Bated breath
all round the theatre. No cause for
alarm, though. Martha is saved, and
the plot comes in to a three-point happy
landing with marriages for everyone in
sight. As light relief there are a comic
maid, a comic waiter, a comic police-
man, three angels (one comic), who
comment on the action, and a bogus
Frenchman whose accent seems to have
been picked up in Calcutta.
With a widow in her 40s as heroine,
the book is aimed at the oldies. This
also applies to the music, which is a
pastiche of all the musical styles that
were popular between the world wars —
among them music-hall (“Have One
Yourself”), the romantic operetta ballad
(“Sometimes a Sweet Thought”), and
the popular song (the title tune).
Generally the music is best when it is
derivative. “Sometimes a Sweet
Thought” is a fairly successful represen-
tative of its kind, but the syncopations
in “Do Be Quiet,” which seems not to
stand very close to any model, are
simply clumsy.
The book, too, is derivative, but has
serious weaknesses. The plot, or at least
the part of it that involves Martha’s
dealings with the marriage bureau, takes
a long while to get started, rapidly
assumes great importance, then gets dis-
posed of rather hastily, with the result
that the pace at which the play moves
varies uncomfortably throughout. More
seriously, the words are in the habit of
lurching into bathos, and a great deal
of the dialogue is stilted.
None of these deficiencies will seem
very important to the kind of admirers
who were present in force on the night
I went. Aging or elderly, they had come
to see and hear the nearest thing to an
old-fashioned operetta ever likely to be
written in this country. Nobody cared
about weaknesses of plot, dialogue, or
music. Joyce Goode’s production was
excellent. It moved smoothly and effec-
tively, and often covered up bad spots
in the book. Among the strong cast, Sue
Falk was outstanding as Martha.

lit „ .
Michael Johnson. Gallery A, Sydney.
Justin O’Brien. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney. ’
Plate, Dance, and Brickell. Bonython
Gallery, Sydney.
IN REVIEWING Syd Ball’s current
show at Melbourne’s South Yarra,
Patrick McCaughey says that Ball is
arguably the most impressive single
talent to have emerged in Australian
painting in the ’sixties; “arguably” is
the key word, for at present the most
likely contender for such arguable honors
is Michael Johnson. Just as Ball’s
urbanely exuberant flat abstraction
blossomed in New York in the early
’sixties, so did Johnson’s in London. Ball
returned to Australia in 1965, and
Johnson in 1967; both are more virile,
positive, and potent than the artists who
attended their births; while New York
abstraction tends to ecole-de-Paris ease,
Ball, despite his suavity, is more urgent;
Johnson’s formidable monumentality
“Study, Skyros,” a drawing by Justin O'Brien
now owes nothing to the whimsy and
horticultural graciousness of a lot of
English abstraction.
Johnson, like a number of flat-area
painters, has felt that flatness is not
enough, and in a painting like Frontal
Red recesses a bright yellow trough in
the red slab, which is supported by two
dark sidebands; it has a joyful threat
like a gay guillotine. In Compliment,
five slabs of purple in bas-relief uneasily
try to smother an orange background;
Night, with greenish-blue velvety slabs
on purple, is tender and mystical.
What happens in each of his 18
paintings is unique and defies categori-
sation: a diamond, 17ft. long and 3-|ft.
high with the corners cut off, is painted
a single, pulsating dark blue, while
Zipper serialises the same shapes to give
an impression of forms on the verge of a
climax. Morning, Noon and Night,
which is three paintings, each of four
joined canvases, shows that night’s
indigo, noonday’s red blaze, and morn-
ing’s golden calm all have their
tensions. Nothing is, however, so tense
as Through, where two sharp green
oblongs attached to the top and the
bottom of the canvas turn an unobtru-
sive blue between them into an implac-
able slab. What makes such works
thoroughly impressive is that he follows
no formula, not even his own, and con-
ceives of each work as a separate,
urgent problem.
The only urgency in Justin O’Brien’s
disappointing depictions of Mediter-
ranean scenes is in the dry spareness of
the drawings of hillside houses, rocks,
and an old woman by a window. One
would have expected that his visit to
Italy and Greece might have inten-
sified his former glowing color and
energised his firm grasp of structure.
Jeff Smart improved immensely with
close contact with Italian painter-
liness and pittura metafisica, but
O’Brien has adopted a vague,
cloying Italianate gentility; saints are
pastel ghosts of their former selves; his
figures once had a ritual presence but
are now merely compositional props.
Admittedly two heads have a fine,
sad melancholy and the new hill scenes
are a promising departure, but in the
latter the attempt to
combine Cezannesque
touches with early
Renaissance stillness
just does not work.
He has confused
debilitated sweetness
with sens itive
nuances, and scenes
that once were full
of vibrant revelation
have now an air of
indulgent religiosity;
it’s the fineness of the
drawings that re-
minds us of his for-
mer prowess.
At Bonython’s,
Carl Plate, a master
of nuance and sug-
gestion, has never
felt it necessary to show much struc-
ture: these works, completed in Paris,
consist of wan blues, mauves, and
ochres, and black loosely floating in
tattered shapes about an elusive centre.
Monument in Green, the best, is more
resilient as black and white lines slice
into the green, white, and ochre to
create a restless, ragged, dynamic,
sourly green anguished thought in a
green shade.
Co-exhibitor Geoffrey Dance, who
has commuted between England and
Australia since 1950 and has shown
in both countries, is just as delicate
as Plate, though more ephemeral,
in using a deft, tense, and elegant line
that owes a curve or two to Gorky
and Whiteley, to reduce Man Behind
Glass to an intriguing paleness and
turn Sawmill at Obley into an accumu-
lation of delicate suggestions. There is
nothing delicate about New Zealander
Barry Brickell’s rotund, robust jugs and
pots, some called Fatso; in their grey-
and-brown salt-glazes they look as for-
midable as Friar Tuck.

KEEPING IT QUIET
ONCE it was the height of show-
business style for an Australian enter-
tainer to exhibit his status in the direc-
tory, “Showcast,” by not accompanying
his half-page entry with a photo of
himself. For instance, in the directory’s
eighth edition, published recently,
Gordon Chater is still resolutely adver-
tising himself by name alone, while
across the page Barry Crocker (“Inter-
national comedian, actor-singer, impres-
sionist”) has submitted his photograph
and a summary of his career for the
past five or six years.
But the latest bit of baffling one-
upmanship seems to be not to enter a
listing in “Showcast” at all. In a
directory which now lists more than
800 Australian and New Zealand
actors, actresses, singers, comedians, fire-
eaters, trick cyclists, female impersona-
tors, writers and musical arrangers,
there are a few notable absentees from
the performing arts. Random stand-
outs include Peter O’Shaughnessy, Reg
Livermore, Googie Withers, and John
McCallum.
“ ‘Showcast’ now has an international
circulation,” says publisher-entertainer
David Williams. “We would like every
Australian in the business to have an
entry in it — not merely for our bene-
fit but so that the whole world can
have a complete picture of just what
entertainment talent Australia has to
offer.” Among the wide range currently
offering are three snake acts.
BROADSHEET BALLYHOO
THE MEDIUM was show business and
the message virtually was “get with the
‘Age’,” but the two were not always
compatible. Melbourne’s morning
broadsheet had taken over the Lido
theatre-restaurant for luncheon last
week and invited several hundred adver-
tisers and advertising agency people to
make a rather flamboyant pitch for a
bigger share of the market. Showtime
was great, with singer Lorrae Desmond
insinuating her voice through a clever
repertoire, and a line of Lido lovelies
stirring up midday libidos. The hard-
sell should have been so slick. When it
came to newstime, the whoop-de-do
seemed to have had a telling effect and
there was considerable trouble with the
slide projector. One “Age” message was
projected four times before it reached
the screen in focus and the right way
up. When the ironic cheers subsided,
one guest sighed, “Communicators are
so bad at the business of communicating
with each other.”
JOINING THE QUEUE
THERE is nothing wrong with the arts
in Australia that a few million dollars
.couldn’t fix. Latest to join the long list
of cultural mendicants is the Queens-
land division of the Arts Council of
Australia. After being told that its
1968-69 grant from the Queensland
Government was to be $15,000 — the
same as last year — division president,
Dr. Gertrude Langer, cried: “It is
precisely half of what we need to sur-
vive. We cannot go on. We are virtually
bankrupt and faced with dismissing
valuable staff.” Crazy as the alternative
might seem, it is worth suggesting that
the Arts Council of Australia might
consider lining up for a hand-out from
the Australian Council for the Arts.
YOU, TOO, CAN STAR
AMONG the positions vacant for
marketing managers and critical path-
schedulers in a Brisbane newspaper last
week was one to tempt New Faces.
“Announcers needed for the ABC,”
shouted the display advertisement. “If
you make the grade you could earn
$3244-$6638. You may become a radio
or television newsreader, presentation
announcer, or perhaps have your own
personality program. You know the
ABC —- we’d like to know you, so send
us a resume of your qualifications
(minimum: Senior Certificate).” The
ABC’s headquarters in Sydney says the
ad is only being run in Queensland,
is not part of an Australia-wide recruit-
ing drive. Even so, the commercially
familiar faces and voices of broadcast-
ing — with or without the Senior Cer-
tificate — are not likely to rush to
join the Commission in Brisbane. The
current commercial rate for “per-
sonality program” people is well above
the ABC’s $3244-$6638 range.
AMOEBIC
TO MANY PEOPLE the singing group
the Seekers were a delight. To others,
they were just too clean-cut and clear-
eyed for words, and were finally
damned when Sir Henry Bolte’s com-
mittee chose them as Australians of the
Year.
However, nobody could bear them
much ill will. When they split up a few
months ago it seemed that they had
made their pile, although it had taken
them to the ripe, old mid-twenties to
do it and that that would be the last
of them. Since the split, however, fol-
lowing their progress has been rather
like watching some elementary
organism under a microscope: first one,
then another, then another, detaches
itself from the main body and over-
night is a fully grown maker of TV
specials. It becomes an awful lot of
Seeker-type entertainment even for
those who like that sort of thing.

MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
SAVAGE DIVISION
ARTS VIETNAM recently presented
music of the Sydney school of com-
posers with an addition of an example
of the work of Colin Brumby, of Bris-
bane, at the Teachers’ Federation
Auditorium. I am afraid that this con-
cert separated the men from the boys
and the girls rather savagely. The
genuine professionalism of Sculthorpe
and Brumby, knowing where they were
going and travelling their path with
sureness and expediency, was in sharp
contrast to the immature and largely
ineffectual work of the younger
composers.
Even a very early piece of Richard
Meale’s, from a period he has repudi-
ated and when celtic twilight was more
significant to him than the full sun of
Andulusia, had much more evidence of
genuine talent than was shown in the
variations on a Vietnamese tune by
Anne Boyd or the “Song of Love” of
Alison Bauld. Nobody would deny the
sincerity and dedication of these two
exceedingly comely young women, but
they will have to achieve a style which
will allow some oxygen through to the
feeble flame of their desire before they
are likely to say anything musically
significant.
Maybe this is too harsh a judgment,
for Miss Bauld asked her audience not
to regard her contribution as necessarily
representative of her style, and Miss
Boyd’s piece had obviously not had time
to settle into the minds of the players.
Yet both works seemed to be over-
concerned with avoiding anything which
had gone before, despite the fugal
nature of the Bauld. Why this obsession
with breakages rather than fulfilment?
For, although I would not suggest that
Miss Bauld equate iconoclaspa with
vandalism, I detected in their works a
vein of defiant anarchy which could
cripple their creative process. The
same thing could hardly be said for the
largely derivative Trio of Barry
Conyngham. It has its share of extro-
verted passion which could augur well.
The Seventh Quartet of Sculthorpe
is not a major work, which the Sixth
undoubtedly is, but the composer has
found much joy in the strong natural
har,monic series high up on the strings
and obviously derives satisfaction
from keeping the viola’s bow on the
wrong side of the bridge for extended
periods. As usual there were stretches
of strong sonority. His realisation,
through the medium of the string
quartet, of the fascinating sounds which
are so much a part of the Japanese
Noh plays, was masterly. The second
Sculthorpe contribution, by its evoca-
tion of an intrinsically gentle Asia, was
probably a much more potent advocacy
of the aim of Arts Vietnam than
anything else on the progra,m. Colin
Brumby’s “Three Songs for High Voice
and String Quartet” gave a much-
needed injection of elan into the pro-
gram. These songs received the best
performance of the night.
Jane Fonda as Barbarella
FILMS/RICHARD CAMPBELL
FLESH AND FARCE
Barbarella. Director, Roger Vadim.
FOR A FILM apotheosised as a peak
of kinky, satirical get-your-gear-off pop
culture, and denounced as a low point
of insidious amorality, “Barbarella” is
decidedly conventional. Whatever Jean-
Claud Forest’s vogue comic strip (now
in book form) may represent to the
trendy set, shrewd Dino de Laurentiis’
film is well within both the
modern formula of lots of flesh and the
unflagging conventions of farce, bur-
lesque, Mack Sennett visual jokes, and
Marx Brothers’ spoofing inanity. And
this is precisely why “Barbarella” is
witty, bawdy, and, at times, uproariously
funny: the humor is recognised instantly.
Spoof feeding on spoof is now almost a
genre.
De Laurentiis has updated the comedy
and innuendo with leather, knives,
oodles of phallic symbols, things that
rip: and bite, Bondian aerial fireworks,
explosions of psychedelic color, and
such choice titillations as a near-nude
suspended from the groin and ankles
by leather straps, but all these remain
essentially trappings. Beneath all the
futuristic gear there beats the hearts of
the same hoary old film archetypes:
the crackpot professor, the nasty, sultry
siren, the fumbling anarchist-cum-
revolutionary, and the besotted, paranoid
would-be world ruler.
Jane Fonda’s Barbarella is no man-
devouring Bondian or a cold, quick-on-
the-trigger Emma Peel, but remains the
eternally appealing ingenue to the end.
Her cheerful, matter-of-fact carnality is
aroused by the old-fashioned habits of
thJ-wiplanet she visits in her quest for a
mTsstng scientist. Yet again, the girl who
discovers the pleasures of love has been
stock in trade in French theatre and
film for generations. Her healthy appe-
tites occasion what may become a minor
classic of film nonsense. The power-
hungry scientist attempts to do away
with Barbarella by putting her in his
Wurlitzer-like pleasure machine. But
the rapturous, insatiable earthling
simply fuses the machine.
Vadim’s direction is self-aware, resist-
ing any temptations to dwell too long
on gimmicks, symbolism, and the
spoofed-up allegory. The plot, such as
it is, was perpetrated by Vadim and
the screenwriter of “Dr. Strangelove,”
the ebullient Terry Southern. De
Laurentiis is said never to have lost
on a film yet. He won’t lose on this
one.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
BEAUTIFUL AND CHIC
My Sister, My Love. Director, Vilgot
Sjoman.
Vivre Pour Vivre. Director, Claude
Lelouch.
UNDOUBTEDLY Vilgot Sjoman’s
film-making has been influenced by
Bergman, but he’s a pretty good man
by whom to be influenced; and Sjo.man
has individuality and style enough to
be highly reckoned on his own account.
He hasn’t yet acquired the admirable
terseness and directness which Berg-
man has shown in his later films, but
after all it took Bergman himself
several movies to achieve these. “My
Sister, My Love” has, especially in its
early sequences, slow-moving and even
irrelevant passages, but this study of
guilt and remorse has a cumulative
power.
A young nobleman of the 18th cen-
tury returns to Sweden after years of
foreign travel and study. His sense of
outrage when he hears that his adored
sister is about to marry makes them
admit their passionate, incestuous love.
But he cannot accept his sister’s sug-
gestion that they run away and live as
man and wife, so the sister, the stronger
character, marries to protect their
coming child. But though she has not
previously believed in a God of Wrath,
she is tormented with visions of punish-
ment, embodied in the shambling, idiot
son of a peasant woman conceived from
an incestuous love.
After initial discursiveness, the film
pursues its theme relentlessly and often
movingly, thanks to fine performances
and sensitive direction. Visually it is
breath-taking, with the bleak beauty
of the Swedish countryside gleaming
in the pearly black-and-white photog-
raphy at which this country’s cinema-
tographers excel.
Nothing bleak or beautiful about
“Vivre Pour Vivre,” though it’s pretty
and chic. Lelouch hit a winning com-
bination in “A Man and a Woman”—
take a basic sob-story, add some
specific bedroom scenes, spice with
modish backgrounds and cinematic
tricks. In the new movie, the sob-story
is the eternal triangle, and something
new has been added since the man
in the case is a famous TV reporter
(Lelouch still has his preoccupation
with glamorous jobs) the director can
cut in scenes of revolution in Red
China, violence in the Congo, carnage

TELEVISION/DENIS O'BRIEN
THEY WUZ ROBBED
AUSTRALIAN television’s public-
affairs programmers were thirsting for
a Federal election this year. The TV
coverage of the campaigning and the
polling would have been unprecedently
detailed. Electronic journalism this year
in the United States has made a dram-
atic feast of politics, and the influence
on eager, hand-held cameras and
cocked-trigger tongues in Australia is
too great to be ignored. ARC-TV would
have ploughed most mileage out of an
election —both its major public-affairs
programs, “Four Corners” and “This
Day Tonight,” are stitched with earnest
political consciousness—but the com-
mercial networks were planning an
extensive cover, too, even though enter-
tainment shows have now almost flushed
away most of their few regular docu-
mentary programs.
Prime Minister Gorton’s decision not
to hold an election this year has merely
delayed television’s determination to
make a Washington production out of
Canberra politics; it is inevitable. But
in depriving the public-affairs depart-
ments of their last predictable oppor-
tunity to shine this year, Mr. Goiton
has unwittingly deprived television
audiences of a relief from the deeply
rutted sameness of television in 1968.
With the exception of “Laugh In,”
which itself is headed for certain self-
destruction by repetition, the U.S.
entertainment shows have reached a new
low in mediocrity; from a Sydney view,
Australian TV entertainment seems to
have made a massive regression to the
most non-creative formula of all —the
“Tonight”-style show and the amateur
hour, often indistinguishable one from
the other. ,
Even allowing for the ephemerality
of television, it is difficult to recall a
year when the medium has banked
fewer significant memories than it has
in 1968. It is beyond memory since
the nation’s responsible TV critics have
filled more than two consecutive
columns with hearty praise; of the few
that there are, most of them now draw
their copy from mournful philosophy
or industry gossip.
Television’s cocky indominability
notwithstanding, it hasn’t been an
inspiring year for the viewer. And in
that respect, it is rather a pity that the
public-affairs programmers were robbed
of an Australian election.

MAKE THAT
TAHITIAN DREAM
COME TRUE
IF YOU ARE anything like me, there
will doubtless be days when depression
sets in. The routine of everyday life
gets monotonous. You want to break
out —do something drastic, dramatic, or
costly. Usually I feel like that when I
can least afford to do any of them.
You may have provided better for such
rainy days. Let us assume you have
$579 (or at least the down payment
on that amount), then a very good idea
is to pop into your nearest travel agent,
or call at the offices of your nearest
UTA French Airlines branch, and
book yourself a Christmas present —a
pas cher holiday in Tahiti.
For that amount of money you (for-
tunately) get there and back in 16
days. Otherwise, you might not have
enough money left to get back with.
Not that Tahiti is all that expensive.
No more, that is to say, than any terri-
tory run by the French, where every-
thing has to be imported from France.
From my point of view the journey
was almost worth it just for the experi-
ence of tasting fresh French cheeses
flown into Tahiti twice a week.
For the money, you spend a couple
of days in Tahiti on the way there,
breeze over to the island of Moorea on
a fast speedboat in less than an hour
on a calm day, and luxuriate for 12
days on a primitive, incredibly lush
tropical island before ploughing back
to Tahiti.
By that time you will have learnt
some French, or aired the little you
know, picked up a fabulous tan, water-
skied, sailed on either a small or large
craft, gone deep-sea fishing, collected
some wonderful shells and bits of
unbelievably beautiful coral, and seen
fish swimming in the clear blue lagoons
that you would never believe even
nature could produce so artistically.
And none of it will cost you one
extra franc.
Three more-than-square meals a day,
and wine to wash it down with. To be
sure, Cellarmaster would not approve
of its breeding—and even if you want
to purchase a more salubrious wine you
can forget it. On the island of Moorea
they don’t care for you to be a special-
ist. You are there to get away from it
all, and you have to eat and drink what
is put in front of you, just like every-
one else. But for that amount of hard
cash it is frankly no hardship.
If you haven’t got $579, or even
the down payment for the never-never
plan, you can still dream.
Personally, I’m planning a nice
Tahitian banquet in my garden which
will take place any day now. I’ve
taken out my muu-muu and aired it, got
my spouse’s grass hat out of the
cupboard and swept off the winter’s
mildew, and I’m getting him to prepare
the barbecue.
The first course will be Salade
Tahitian, and, if I can collect enough
coconut shells to eat it out of, that’s
how I shall serve it.
Traditionally this should be made
with Mahi Mahi, a large Pacific-
oriented fish, but kingfish or snapper
will do very well.
Don’t tell your guests that the fish
is raw, because they might lose interest.
Just give it to them and watch them
lap it up. It starts off raw, certainly,
but the process of marination “cooks”
it, so to speak.
I prepared a large bowl of it last
Christmas for an enormous gathering
and it was wolfed, to say the least.
Fillet the fish, cut into strips, and
completely cover in lemon juice, lots
of salt, and leave for about 2 hours.
Meanwhile prepare carrots in julienne
strips (about a quarter of the quantity
of fish strips), cut up a turnip in simi-
lar fashion, and pop both into a bowl
of ice water in the refrigerator to crisp.
Boil two or more eggs (depending on
the quantity of guests), and when
they’re hard cool them and then chop
them very finely. Slice tomatoes and
cucumbers.
When the fish has marinated, pour
off lemon juice, add the drained vege-
tables and the salad vegetables, mix
well, and decorate with chopped eggs.
For perfection you should also add
some coconut, but it is not essential. If
you have it, and a strong arm, then
this is the way to prepare it. Crack
coconut, drain the milk and chill it in
the refrigerator to drink with the salade.
Grate the coconut into a bowl, turn
into a muslin cloth, and squeeze the
juice into the salad then discard the
remaining coconut.
This should be served with baked
sweet pototoes which can sizzle on your
barbecue wrapped in foil. A delectable
entree if ever there was one.
Traditionally, while you’re munching
this, a roast suckling pig should be
turning on the spit, to be eaten with
exotic tropicana salads. In fact, we
attended a barbecue in Tahiti where
not one but two little vealers were
turning round on a huge spit manually
handled. And they were basted lovingly
by anyone who happened to be passing.
If you live in the country, this, of
course, won’t pose a problem. A true
Tahitian banquet in the outback.
Fresh fruit to follow in abundant
variety. Just supply the quantity,
knives and plates, and let your guests
tuck in. In Tahiti you might indulge
and eat a whole pineapple. There the
pineapples are very small and sweet.
Here you might just compromise and
prepare a fresh fruit salad laced with
kirsh and sugar, and stuff / it into pre-
pared pineapple shells. Place them into
the freezer to chill thoroughly, but not
to freeze. One or two of these look very
appetising set out on your table, and
guests can spoon the mixture out to
please themselves.


Letters
Commonwealth-States
Mr. Coleman (8., October 5) in his
haste to score a few quick points
against Canberra’s bureaucracy (very
trendy, at the moment) spoils an
otherwise interesting commentary on
the current State-Federal financial
bunfight. Mr. Coleman ought to realise
that the intelligence of Bulletin readers
is sufficient for them to grasp his
valid points without his having to resort
to facile and emotional appeals, based
on one-sided distortions more charac-
teristic of the popular Press than of
a more responsible and clear-sighted
journalism. Mr. Cole,man conveniently
forgets, while he perhaps justly criticises
Federal spending on Canberra’s
swimming-pools, library, mortuary, etc.,
that the penniless State Governments
have their own extravagances dare
I recall two splendid cultural edifices
of wide repute?
Perhaps Mr. Coleman, with his gift
for the instant and apt comparison,
might compare the cost of these with
an equivalent cost, say, of teachers’
colleges, migrant centres, housekeeping
services, and air-conditioners. Or
better, perhaps next time he will stick
to the point and resist the temptation
to lard his narrative with emotive
irrelevancies.
J. Pickett-Heaps
Canberra, A.C.T.
I write as one MLA to congratulate
another new MLA in Mr. Peter Cole-
man for his well-written article on the
State-Federal discussions. Mr. Coleman
has carried out an exercise which I
engaged in myself as a new MLA in
1965 in addressing the Parliament on
a resolution on conservation. I think
that both he and I should go on record,
however, that what we are saying is not
original. The same exercise was carried
out with greater authority by the late
J. J. Cahill as Premier more than a
decade ago. It was continued in a very
erudite way by J. B. Renshaw, MLA,
in his Budget speech of 1965.
I detect in Mr. Coleman in the
Parliament a desire to show some
State independence. I do hope it finds
practical outlet when the com-
plementary legislation is being debated
to give effect to the Commonwealth’s
dictated new wheat scheme. If ever
there was a time to call the bluff of a
Commonwealth Treasury message boy
and a compliant Cabinet this is it. The
State Minister concerned admits the
scheme is a bad one, the wheatgrowers
say they are being intimidated into
accepting it, the Commonwealth pro-
claims it will talk to neither States nor
industry but that its will must prevail
or else ...
Let us say “no” to any change for
the present and use this current year to
reopen discussions for a more sound and
acceptable scheme. This is a real
battleground not a gabfest and I
hope Mr. Coleman will apply his zeal
to bringing fire and courage on this
issue to his colleagues.

Gulf of Tonkin Incidents
In his critique of Jean Lacouture’s
book “Ho Chi Minh,” Anthony Haas
said that Lacouture talks vaguely of the
“incidents” in the Gulf of Tonkin in
1965 (sic) implying that the Americans
provoked them, and that the most
useful corrective is for Lacouture to
keep writing and researching on this
crisis period in history.
United States Senator Wayne Morse,
of Oregon, revealed during the debate
in the U.S. Senate on August 5 and 6,
1964 (on the basis of information given
in executive session by Secretaries Rusk
and McNamara to a joint session of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
and Armed Services), that U.S. war-
ships Turner Joy and Maddox were on
patrol in Tonkin Bay during the bom-
bardment of two islands off the North
Vietnamese coast on Friday, July 31,
1964, by South Vietnamese armed
vessels of PT-boat type, supplied by the
U.S.A. Morse said that the U.S. war-
ships were within three to 11 miles of
North Vietnamese territory at the time,
although North Vietnam claims a 12-
mile limit. Morse said it was not just
another attempt to infiltrate agents into
North Vietnam but “a well-thought-
out military operation,” and charged
that the presence of U.S. warships in
the proximity, “where they could have
given protection if it became necessary,”
was “bound to be looked upon by our
enemies as an act of provocation.”
At the time, according to a recent
“Esquire” article, the Maddox was on a
spy mission, gathering intelligence on
North Vietnam's radar and electronic
defences. This was not revealed to
Congress or the public (or to our
Australian Government).

The Big Sell
The “Big Sell” (8., Oct. 5), by Batman,
is just that—expensive in a big way, as
one can expect from two Government
instrumentalities spending taxpayers’
funds, and just as lacking in profes-
sional expertise from a marketing point
of view.
Some time in 1967 I met an Ameri-
can couple, a Mr. and Mrs. Chase, at
Bangkok’s airport. Not unusually, in
those surroundings, conversation got to
airlines and when I grouped Qantas
among those offering the finest service
in the world I was startled at the almost
venomous reaction I got from this
elderly, very nice American couple
joint owners of an important travel
agency on the West Coast.
In America, Mr. Chase said, the
main activity of a large travel agency
is the organising of large groups of
tourists for holiday travel. Mere book-
ing of tickets for the odd traveller is
considered peanuts. After all, not only
do satisfied customers bring them con-
stantly new ones but jnany people
come back year after year for more
and more tours with the same agency.
So travel by travel agents to distant
spots is essential marketing research,
and their association has convinced the
world’s leading airlines of this fact. As
a result, not only do they get discounts
on their air fares but, and this is con-
sidered even more important in this
hectic a<je, the airlines grant them cer-
tain, almost instant, booking and
reservation privileges.
There is only one airline that refuses
(1967 and correct me if this has
been changed since!) to grant this book-
ing privilege Qantas. As a result,
the members of the association, who
book annually millions of air passengers
to cities and countries ore-selected by
them, quite naturally do not include
Australia in their itineraries for tours,
for which they create this passive
demand by their own effort.

Nationalism
May I submit some comments on “The
New Nationalism” (8., October 5)?
Despite the view that nationalism is
something out of a bygone era, it is a
value which will induce more effort,
greater dedication, greater tolerance,
and, as well, stamina to put up with
things.
I am one of the 40,000 refugees who
arrived in Australia in 1948. The
margin of unpreparedness and easy-
goingness was then quite alarming.
Thanks to our patriotism, we were able
to extend it to Australia as the country
of our adoption, and the refugees were
able to offer a most self-denying service
for Australia. As an example I would
like to quote the Australian Group art
exhibitions in Paris and in the U.S.A.,
1959-61, assisting greatly to inspire an
increasing interest toward Australia. As
I happened to be its organiser, I sold
my house at Double Bay to promote
this venture. The accumulated loss to
me amounts now to some $lOO,OOO. As
its site was originally meant for an
Aboriginal Art Centre, it again assisted
to provide the initial spark for the
Aboriginal rights and to the develop-
ment of the referendum.
Here I would like to suggest that
• another article should highlight the
migrants’ part in building up Australian
nationalism—and idealism. If Australia
should be threatened in the near future
(1971 onward), then Australian
nationalism could be the only bulwark.

Yes.
At the new Victorian Arts Centre,
you'll see Comalco aluminium
just about everywhere you look.
Rarely has architectural aluminium been used
so effectively as throughout the new Victorian Arts
Centre, which houses one of the world’s great art
collections. You’ll see the muted bronze-coloured
tones of Kalcolor* aluminium from Comalco in
countless examples ... from the elegant frames of
the water screen at the entrance to the soaring
eaves which encircle this very special building.
Even the flagpoles! Just as you’ 1 ! see Comalco
aluminium when you look at most of Australia’s
important buildings of recent years.
