O great-grandfather-clock of all our race,
Heirloom yet modern, old yet keeping pace,
Booming the hours with placid mellow calm.
To greet Joy’s jest or Fate's profound salaam:
That bronze long-syllable’d rolling song of yours,
Deep-lung’d, deep tongue’d, resounds and reassures:
Your solemn deep contented Chant of Time
Strengthens the heart: age-peace is in your chime.

HIS
BOOKS
The Looking-glass of Fashion
A writer in the “S. M. Herald” sub-
mitted recently that three tendencies were
threatening democracy—war, economic
nationalism, and “a certain self-satisfac-
tion which has caused modern youth to
accept comfort, convenience and eru-
dition as the perfection of civilisation.”
Two profusely illustrated volumes have
just been published which give a survey
of male and female styles between 1800
and 1930. Costume and Fashion (J. M.
Dent and Sons ; 255.), by Herbert Norris
and Oswald Curtis, covers the nineteenth
century, and Ourselves (The Bodley
Head ; Bs. 6d,), by Irene Clephane, deals
with the first 30 years of this century.
They prove, among other things, that
men and women have always been
obsessed by a reverence for war and
mpney, and have always attached tre-
mendous importance to comfort, con-
venience and erudition.
From the Regency to the Late-Victorian
Period
The doom of the beautified male had
been virtually sealed 150 years before
George 111. came to the throne under
the only Hitleresque regime England has
known. It is not inconceivable that such
exquisite beings as Hilliard and Oliver
painted in Tudor days may be seen
mincing about London again ; a recent
news-item mentioned that scarlet-lined
evening cloaks are being worn by some
of England’s Bright Young Men. How-
ever, most male fashions have been based
on sport (which is another way of say-
ing leisured wealth) and war ever since
England began going in for colonies and
money-making on a large scale.
The Englishman has never had a strong
sense of “economic nationalism.” Or
any other kind of nationalism, for that
matter. Neither have Australians, though
Australia turned from Freetrade before
England. British loyalties are essentially
local. Highlanders despise Lowlanders ;
Manchester despises Birmingham, and
vice versa; London despises both.
There is no love lost between Sydney
and Melbourne, and town and country
in the Commonwealth require separate
parties to represent them in Parliament.
Two things unite the conflicting elements
from time to time —sport and war. Par-
ticularly war. “Military glory,” wrote
Lord Bryce, “is the sort of glory that
first fascinated, and still most fascinates,
mankind.” We can see it in the fashions
of every age,
Trousers had been the national garb
of the Venetians for three centuries (St.
Pantaloon was their patron saint) when
England’s Peninsular army was put into
them in 1806. All young London
business men, and not a few old ones,
like to be mistaken for Guards officers
in mufti; the weakness has inspired hun-
dreds of “Punch” joke-blocks. Trousers
caught on like wildfire. The turban or
toque which is worn to this day by the
Queen derives from England’s operations
in India at the end of the eighteenth
century.
There seems to be no malign signifi-
cance in the periodical decision of
young women to shed their clothes. At
the end of the eighteenth century women
were wearing masses of clothes, and
rarely washing below the neck. By
1820 they had dispensed with stays, and
“an excessively thin petticoat was prac-
tically the only undergarment worn.”
The woman of fashion left her legs bare be-
low her filmy robe. Others compromised by
wearing long flesh-colored or delicately-tinted
stockings.
During the first half of the Victorian
era we can see the influence of militarism
on male fashions. Men wore Wellington
boots, Raglan overcoats, frock coats with
soldierly waists. With peace and pros-
perity the thoughts of the lieges turned
more and more to money, and the
fashions show it. Money in European
countries is largely expressed in terms of
pheasant preserves, grouse moors and
deer- forests, hunting boxes and racing
stables. Disraeli,
who had been a
St. 'James’s-street
fop as a young
man, became a
sportsman sartori-
ally in middle life.
He was often seen at Hughenden in a
brown velveteen shooting-coat, with a flapping
waistcoat and long brown leather gaiters.
During the last phase of Victorian-
ism yachting caps were worn at the sea-
side by lads whose only experience of
pleasure-craft had been gained on the Ser-
pentine, woodcocks’ feathers went with
half-guinea bowlers in the East End, and
thousands who had never been on a horse
affected the rakish clothes of jockeys.
Edward and George
The beginning of this century saw an
abrupt change. The effect of the Har-
court death duties was being felt, and
Lloyd George was shortly to put a super-
tax of 6d. on income’s of over £5OOO
a year and increase the Harcourt duties
on estates of over a million sterling to
15 per cent. The process of taking from
the rich to benefit the poor had begun.
Young men of aristocratic families had
to get work in the city and in trade, and
they dressed accordingly. Frock coats
were relegated to undertakers’ parlors,
top-hats became scarce, tail coats gave
way at night to dinner coats. The Boer
War was too distant, drab and inglorious
to affect the fashions much, and in any
case the nation’s mind was on other
things. Notably money and pleasure.
Coronation Year was the beginning of
another Restoration era. Never had the
female form been more covered up than
in the Edwardian confections shown in
Ourselves, and never had the effect been
more suggestive. One of the few services
done by the World War, which put every-
body into uniform, was to enable women
to uncover their legs again, and they were
still doing it at the close of Miss Cle-
phane’s record. It was not till this year
that a reversion to long, clinging skirts
with no corsets and a minimum of under-
clothes was ordered by Paris. As for
men’s clothes —unless the aesthetes who
are trying to establish scarlet-lined opera
cloaks make good—it seems likely that
utilitarianism will be the vogue for a long
time to come. The Prince of Wales looks
no different from the average golf-club
member on most occasions.
War is still glorified by people who
have no intention of going nearer to a
fighting line than one of the bases, young
people still hunger for pleasure, and
practically everybody hungers for money.
But the discontented are approaching the
old objectives on new lines. They used to
wield le.thal weapons ; now they wield
ballot-boxes, with far more satisfactory
results to themselves. Nowhere in the
Empire since the depression began has
there been a class upheaval comparable to
Peterloo. Once nations sent armies away
to fight in the detached spirit that we send
teams away to play Test cricket; now if
a war started anyone might be a casualty,
and everybody knows it. Modern youth
is no more self-satisfied or luxury-loving
than of old, but it is certainly more paci-
fist. Never before have representative
young men—university undergraduates,
and conspicuous graduates like Beverley
Nichols —been able to announce that they
won’t fight if their country goes to war
and get away with it. But it isn’t
a “turning back from civilisation” ; it is
their way, however misguided, of trying
to save civilisation. Many authorities, in-
cluding the Pope, have said that another
big war will destroy civilisation.

Our Greatest Horse Poet
Edith Humphris has not made much of
a success of her Life of Adam Lindsay
Gordon (Scholartis Press ; 7s. 6d.). It is
a thin three half-crowns’ worth which
reads as if somebody had said, “Oh, by
the way—they’re putting a tablet to
A.L.G. in the Abbey. Let’s write his life.’’
The book, which is 160 pages long, leaves
no concrete picture of the man and his
mind with the reader unless it be an in-
accurate impression of a lank, weak-
minded person who needs to be apolo-
gised for in every second paragraph.
Gordon seems to have been well able
to do the things which he really wanted
to do. He could ride steeplechases, write

verse and commit suicide effectually;
and all these things need will-power and
a certain concentration of mind. His
biographers would understand him a
good deal better if they remembered
that he was one of the mad Gordons to
whom Byron belonged. But while Byron
had a mad Gordon mother, a woman of
domineering temper, subject to periods
of ungovernable rage, A.L.G. had a
Gordon mother, very much the counter-
part of Byron’s in temperament and be-
havior, and a Gordon father, her first
cousin.
That sort of parenthood was more
than full measure. It filled the young
man’s temperamental cup to overflowing,
imbued him with the overweening pride
of race which afflicted this descendant
family of James I. of Scotland and was
responsible for the misjudgment which
sent him to be educated at Woolwich
Military Academy along with examples of
human meekness like “Chinese” Gordon
—no relation, by the way.
There are curious parallels between
Byron and his distant cousin. Both
became exiles, both died at about the
same age and there was something
actively heroic in both, a quality which
is not usual in poets, who love words
rather than deeds. And if A.L.G. scales
only as a mere shadow of his predeces-
sor when their genius is weighed, it must
be remembered that one was brought up
with horsedealers and budding artillerists
while the other rubbed minds in his youth
with Francis Hodgson and Hobhouse, and
was buoyed by the encouragement of
critics like Henry Mackenzie and Lord
Woodhouslee, who urged him into print
before he had reached his majority.
Miss Humphris does not stress the
Byronic side of Gordon. She is more
concerned with producing a detailed
account of his life in the mode of an
age which thought more of him as a poet
because he indulged in race-riding.
Reading his verse at this stage, one is
inclined to feel that it is fortunate for
his reputation that he was’ a hard rider.
The mid-Victorian predilection for the
“Druid” school of literature was all in his
favor, for lines of the quality of:
In the spring when the wattle gold trembles
’Twixt shadow and shine....
are jewels in a vast mass of rather dull
matrix. Eventually his name will pro-
bably live by grace of the “Favorite.”
It certainly won’t survive because of his
biographers, whose writings lack insight,
atmosphere and accuracy. Miss Hum-
phris, for instance, observes:
It has been said that the Sydney “Bulletin”
was the first journal to recognise Gordon’s
talent, and that it used frequently to publish
his contributions under an assumed name, and
that the companion [Trainor] with whom he
shared his hut used to read them and com-
ment on them; but Gordon never remarked
that he was the author of them
Which seems natural, seeing that The
Bulletin was born nine years after
Gordon died.

An Ethnographical Masterpiece
In one of his early stories Kipling por-
trayed an enthusiast who knew everything
about pigs, and the pride he took in im-
parting some of his knowledge to his
departmental senior. Had Kipling met
R. W. Williamson, author of Religious
and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia
(Cambridge University Press; 505.) he
might well have got “another story”—or,
for that matter, a hundred other stories—
from this human mine of information on
the subject of the Pacific races.
Mr. Williamson’s magnum opus is in
two volumes of about 400 pp. each,
beautifully printed. His bibliography
alone fills 12 pages.
To the student these Polynesian legends
will be of absorbing interest, but to the
verage reader the gigantic scale on which
the work is set out is daunting. He will
read it by fits and starts —a dip here and
a plunge there. But rarely does a dive
go unrewarded.
Thus, amid the multiplicity of gods,
godlets, monsters, avatars, demiurges
and First Causes that pervade the endless
heavens and hells of Polynesian supersti-
tions, one is startled to come upon “the
Hawaiians’ myth of creation”:
The Hawaiians at one time believed in and
worshipped one God, comprising three Beings,
Kane, Ku and Lono, who respectively repre-
sented the ideas of Light, Stability and Sound.
Though distinct in attributes, they were equal
in nature; but Kane was superior to the other
two—a primus inter pares.
This triune god existed from eternity,
from and before the period of night,
darkness, chaos. By an act of will the
three broke to pieces or dissipated their
surrounding, all-containing Po —night, or
chaos —and so admitted light into space.
They then created the heavens, three in
number, as a place of dwelling for them-
selves, and the earth to be their footstool.
Next they created the sun, moon and
stars, and a host of spirits to minister to
them. Last of all they created man on
the model or in the likeness of Kane.
The body of the first man was made by
them out of red earth and their own saliva,
and his head was made of a whitish clay
which was brought from the four ends of
the world by Lono. Then they breathed
into the man’s nose and called on him
to rise, and he thereupon became a living
being. Afterwards the first woman was
created from one of the man’s ribs while
he slept; and this man and woman were
the progenitors of mankind. These old
legends seem to have existed in varying
form all over the immense range of Poly-
nesia for thousands of years.
In the Paumotus, Caillot tells of the
legend of the three sons of Rata, a mythi-
cal personage of Polynesia, who with
their parents had survived a great flood.
They made an attempt to erect a building
by which they could reach the sky and see the
creater God Vatea (Atea), but the god in anger
chased the builders away and broke down the
building and changed their language so that
they spoke divers tongues.
The book abounds with such parallels of
the Bible story, many of which have
existed from before the foundations of
the Christian world.

heartedly alleges (R.P. 24/1/’34)! It is
true that women, with a few exceptions,
do not possess creative ability in art,
literature or music. The limit of their
creative powers is ordained by Nature.
Painting masterpieces and writing sym-
phonies require a'much pleasanter kind
of creative effort than is needed for bear-
ing children, so Nature, whose business
is the perpetuation of the race, withholds
from women the faculty for other
methods of creative self-expression. It
was not the bad women painters who
were taken up and “hoisted into pro-
minence.” Much of the modern trash
hailed by dealers and critics as vital was
the output of failures, many of them
mentally unbalanced, who, being pos-
sessed of a grievance, voiced it in a noisy
new jargon.
Women, who cannot create or initiate,
never fail to grow sentimental over the
creature with a grievance. Their emo-
tions carry them hysterically forward,
though their intellects and creative
powers could not budge them an inch.
The women took up the cause of the
poseur and mountebank in art and lion-
ised him, as they always do any other
kind of impostor. Once they espouse
a cause they are ruthless in pushing its
interests. Once an issue has personally
become theirs, its merits or demerits cease
to be critically examined.
It will be found, after a little research,
that any new imaginative ideas, good or
bad, in interior decoration, in the cut
and design of women’s clothes as well as
in painting, have been formulated by
men. Women snatch at novelties and
innovations eagerly; they buy them,
wear them, copy them and “arrange”
them ; are quicker to adapt themselves
to violent changes of fashion than men.
But it is men —decadent men, “pansies”
even —who supply the. ideas, paint de-
cadent pictures and generally keep up
the world supply of mischief and poison
for the women to play about with.
I am sorry that women cannot claim
the guile and cleverness with which
Mr. McDonald credits them. But con-
temporary history and available facts
concerning recent fashions in art, cos-
tume- and furniture-designing wipe out
his pretty theory and leave the he-
painters still selling ; while the “pansies,”
continuing to look languid, to bleat their
grievances and to owe their tailors, are
fed and feted by impressionable women.
And the genuine painters—some of
them with women of their own —con-
tinue to paint genuine pictures, quite un-
affected by the changing styles in neurotic
decor.
HATTIE KNIGHT.
Stella Benson
To-day I glanced at an English literary
weekly and learned, to my sorrow, of
the death of Stella Benson.
No one who has read “Tobit Trans-
planted,” “The Poor Man,” “Worlds
Within Worlds” or “I Pose” is likely to
deny that she was a genius. Her works
were never popular, in the sense that
they were never among the best-sellers.
She was too critical of men, as any ardent
feminist must be if she is to remain sin-
cere, for the male mind to appreciate her
point of view.
Few writers of this age have probed
deeper into the mysteries of human
nature, and fewer still have been able to
express the result of their investigations
with such clarity and economy of words.
One sentence, comprising the preface to
“I Pose,” will always be remembered by
me. “Sometimes I pose, but sometimes I
pose as posing.” Later in the novel she
elaborates on the same theme: “Of
course you know that one of the most
effective poses is to pose as one who
never poses.”
An almost fierce love for all kinds of
living things was apparent in every one
of her novels. Few people knew just how
real that love was, however, except her
most intimate friends. R. Ellis Roberts
tells of an incident at the London Zoo.
We... .visited the snake-house. I can still
see her, with a small python round her neck,
encouraging the keeper to add yet a third to
the two which were already draped rather
heavily on my arms.
Stella Benson thought too deeply and too
clearly for death to hold any terrors for
her. One simply died, and so life ended.
If she had desired an epitaph, perhaps
she would have chosen her own words:
For you may wound and you may kill;
It’s such a little thing to die.
Your cruel God may work his will,
We do not care—my Friend and I.
though at the gate of Paradise
Peter the Saint withhold his keys,
My Friend and I—we have no eyes
For Heaven....or He11....0r dreams like
these....
R. G. RIENITS.
A Satchel of Books
J. M. Dent and Sons have published
The Divine Comedy complete in one
volume, with an English translation oppo-
site the Italian text, at 6s. A notable
feat. The 418 pages contain hundreds of
footnotes, a number of maps and a
genealogical table showing Dante’s
descent from Cacciaguida.
Louis Untermeyer’s The Albatross Book
of Living Verse (Collins ; 55.) may be
compared to “The Golden Treasury” or
“The Oxford Book of English Poetry” ;
and its six hundred and odd pages con-
tain many twentieth-century poems which
are absent from the older anthologies.
Modern American poets are well repre-
sented, Mr. Untermeyer being the Ameri-
can editor of the “English Poetry Review.”
Ernest Seton Thompson is the editor of
Famous Animal Stories of the World
(Bodley Head; 7s. 6d.). Every type
of story is included from TEsop’s “The
Stag in the Stable” to Jack London’s
“For the Love of a Man.” The editor
is responsible for a dozen or more, and
Mark Twain and Whitman are among
the Americans represented. For some
reason Kipling doesn’t figure in this in-
teresting anthology.
Sandwiched between articles in a medi-
cal journal any of the seven stories by
Joyce Dennys in The Over-dose (Bodley
Head ; 55.) might be amusing. In book
form they are a shade colorless. The
following about Vernon Glucose, the
lady doctor’s husband, is a fair example :
Every morning directly after breakfast he
did the flowers —beautifully. He spent hours
over it, the Waiting-Room was always crammed
with them. He had a little wateriiig-can with
a long spout with which he used to fill up
the vases which didn’t need doing again.
The illustrations, by the writer, are really
funny.
Lennox Kerr’s second novel, Ice
(Bodley Head ; 65.), is unusual. For the
greater part the only character is For-
rester, the captain of an Arctic trading
vessel. Forrester once lost a ship through
fear of the ice. This caused him to
regard the ice as a living thing fighting
against him. He accepts an offer to take
the Aurora north, hoping to overcome
his fear, but dreading the first sight of
the ice pans.
He must face and defeat the ice....or be
destroyed by the ice. He did not care which,
rather he hoped at times that he would be
destroyed. The fight which would give him
freedom from all fear would be cruel and
merciless.
The ship runs into ice and loses the pro-
peller. Forrester orders all hands ashore,
but himself remains aboard, too tired to
fight any more. Somehow his nerve
returns; and he decides to try to get
the Aurora home. An absorbing story,
though somewhat long-drawn-out.
Lady Eleanor Smith’s A Christmas
Tree (Gollancz ; 7s. 6d.) is an examina-
tion of the lives and characters of seven
people and their lovers, friends and
associates, who are linked together by
the fact that on a certain day they all
bought Christmas trees at (say) Self-
ridge’s. Some are agreeable, and some
are the reverse, but they’re all interest-
ing. This critic liked “Madame Leno-
sova” best. You see the gallant old mime
—a heroine of the ’nineties —facing
ruin. So low has she fallen financially
that she has decided to become a talkie
star ; more, she has made up her mind
to get a Hollywood job by giving a
Christmas party in honor of the abhor-
rent film magnate Liebmann. And Lieb-
mann doesn’t turn up! Pathos, humor,
shrewd observation of many different
characters and social worlds—you get
them all in these brilliant London sketches.

FINANCING RECOVERY.
A deputation from Cessnock saw
N.S.W. Premier Stevens last week and
talked to him about unemployment. It
spoke for every section of the coalfields
public. Mr. Baddeley was there, asking
for increased spending on relief works,
improved conditions for relief workers
and some subsidies —the usual socialist
something for nothing. Representatives
of the unemployed and the Chamber of
Commerce agreed that the relief wage
was not enough to live on. Somebody
said that local businessmen were nearly
bankrupt because of the assistance they
were giving to 2000 citizens, and the
Rector of Cessnock, an unimpassioned
Queenslander with a practical outlook,
added his testimony:
The change from the dole to the relief-work
system has been accompanied by a substantial
increase in food prices, so that unemployed are
no better off. Many families urgently need
clothing and blankets, but have scarcely enough
to buy sugar sacks. Something must be done to
relieve the position, because, owing to the
collapse of the coal industry, hundreds of
miners are doomed to unemployment for the
rest of their lives.
Mr. Stevens was friendly, as is his
habit. “The points raised,” he said, “will
have careful consideration, but condi-
tions elsewhere are not as gloomy as
painted in Cessnock.” Provision would
be made to relieve unemployment on
the coalfields “as soon as possible” ; he
was “earnestly considering the question
of repatriating miners and their families.”
All the usual mumbo jumbo, com-
bined with all the usual lack of clear
thinking, the more sad because the same
afternoon Dunningham, the Minister of
Labor, assured the press that “more than
50,000 men are employed on relief works,
the greatest number since the scheme
was started,” and “the scheme is popu-
lar with the men.”
It is time this unemployment-relief
question was taken out of political hands.
It is no job for unimaginative account-
ants or for too-imaginative party men
with one eye on the propaganda value
of their actions. It should become a
national affair in the hands of some
authority with the power to do as well as
to talk. In short, the Commonwealth
Bank.
The Commonwealth Bank knows all
there is to know about the financial pos-
sibilities of the country at each stage of
its recovery. It can see better than any
Treasury the financial effects of a given
line of action. It has no party feeling,
no axe to grind other than to put the
money resources of the country to work.
It would have, moreover, the support
of the other banks—the Wales has been
advertising for months its willingness to
advance money to industry to make em-
ployment.
Let those who doubt the soundness of
the suggestion see what is being done by
the Bank of England and its subsidiaries,
the British Industrial Development Com-
pany and the Securities Management
Trust. These are the spearheads of re-
storation in Britain. They have reorgan-
ised the steel industry so successfully that
the 50 per cent, salary and wage cuts of
1931 have been restored. They have
hacked the dead wood out of shipping and
shipbuilding, and used the money received
from the sale of unproductive assets to
open up other avenues of employment.
Coal-mining is having a new lease of life.
The textile business has been rational-
ised ; unproductive costs have been
carved out of it. In each of the three
great northern British industries which
are the lifeblood of nearly 30,000,000
people’s existence a unified organisation
has been created which enables the busi-
ness as a whole to face its employment
and foreign-competition troubles.
In the south of England, behind the
new tariff wall, nearly £45,000,000 has
been invested in establishing new in-
dustries, some of which have already
forced foreign competitors out of the
market. Where financing is needed the
Bank of England and its offsiders accom-
plish it through bond issues.
Dreary unemployment-relief schemes
have been thrown overboard, and the dole
is a shrivelling expedient. In the two
years succeeding 1929 the Labor Gov-
ernment of Britain spent £100,000,000
sterling on the sort of thing that Stevens
and his accountants call relief. This
policy has been abandoned. All schemes
are now productive —housing, electricity,
factories. In the first nine months of
1933 the new commercial effort put more
than a quarter of Britain’s unemployed—
over 700,000, that is—off the dole and
on industrial payrolls. The Unemploy-
ment Insurance Account —remember
that there have been 3,000,000 unem-
ployed—is now showing a credit balance.
Behind the generalised scheme there is
constant contact with industrial labor,
which has co-operated throughout. In
1933 there was no hold-up, and the Spend
for Employment campaign, a citizens’
movement organised by the municipali-
ties, has sent £80,000,000 into circulation.
Australia needs some such plan freed
from the trammels of politics. The Com-
monwealth Bank Board, in friendly co-
operation with other bank boards, is
undoubtedly the body to run it. De-
posits in Australian banks last December
totalled £277,607,000. The increase over
1932 actually shows a margin over the
increase in advances and securities. The
banks know what the safety margin, is.
If their resources of information, finance
and organisation were correlated for the
purpose of solving the unemployment
problem and putting development of in-
dustry on a sound basis, the result would
be a corporation in touch with the pulse
and possibilities of every corner of the
Commonwealth and capable of placing
the idle money at the service of Austra-
lians willing to find work for the idle men
and women and youths of Australia.
In conjunction with the plan, the bank
advisers might also review taxation
burdens and say exactly what Australia
can afford to spend on its own govern-
ance. Much credit has been taken by the
jellyfish Canberra Administration and by
unimaginative State Premiers for the
economies and tax-relief with which
they have been “saving Australia.” The
cold fact is that the Commonwealth Bank
has dragged them to most of their action
by the hair of the head. Force of public
opinion has done the rest.
The “consideration” of the Stevenses,
the self-praise of the Dunninghams and
the socialism of the Baddeleys get nowhere.
The only way to find work for coal and
the men who mine it, and to provide a
decent wage on which self-respecting
Australians can live in contentment, is
to furnish a market in industry for more
fuel through relieving potential users of
the fear that expansion would mean more
burdens, uncertainty and continual milk-
ing by taxation departments.
Fifty per cent, off the taxes, bond issues
for industrial rehabilitation and expan-
sion (preferably on the premium prin-
ciple) and non-political control must be
the essence of any national-recovery plan
worthy of the name.
NO LONGER AN INFANT.
The Prime Minister was very tardy in
denouncing the Kalgoorlie race riots.
No word came from him until he
was warned by Queensland’s Arch-
bishop Duhig that it was a very serious
matter, and that unless the authori-
ties bestirred themselves there might be
similar outbreaks in other parts of
Australia, North Queensland in par-
ticular. The Westralian Premier, for his
part, sent a prompt expression of regret
to the Italian Vice-Consul at Perth. It
was skilfully phrased, but his skill de-
serted him when he was driven to reply
to an Italian newspaper, the “Tribuna.”
The “Tribuna” placed the responsi-
bility for the explosion on “narrow-
minded trade-unionism,” and demanded
punishment of the ringleaders, “re-
parations and guarantees for the
future safety of foreigners.” Mr. Col-
lier protested that the miners union
—really the mining branch of the A.W.U.
—had had nothing to do with the dis-
turbances. This is true of the organisa-
tion considered as such, but it is idle
to pretend that members of it had noth-
ing to do with the pitched battle on the
mining leases. They had most to gain,
and have gained, by the violent expulsion
of foreigners from their homes and the
wholesale arson which made it impossible
for the unhappy people to return; and
while the mob was raging and burning
it is not to be believed that they all stood
aloof.
The comments of the “Italo-Austra-
lian,” published in Sydney, are milder
than those of the Rome newspaper, but
it declares that the riots have adminis-
tered the greatest blow that the cause of
Italo-Australian friendship has received
for many years.” It asks Australians to re-
member that the great majority of Italians
in this country are “naturalised Austra-
lians, entitled to every legal consideration
which is granted to the Australian-born,
entitled to a share of the work offer-
ing and open to the same penalties as
any other worker if they disobey the in-
dustrial laws.” With the restraint that
has distinguished him in these latter
years, Mussolini has been silent. He has,
however, sent a personal contribution of
£lOO towards the relief of Italians whose
premises were wrecked in Kalgoorlie and
Boulder. He doubtless feels that the
brutality of the goldfields mob was a very
poor return for the tribute paid by his
nation to the memory of our own Hinkler,
but he has left it to others to make the
comparison. A lesser man would have
rubbed it in.
In all ages the ill-treatment of
foreigners by Governments owing them
protection or by mobs taking the law
into their own hands has been a cause
of war. Britain has fought many wars
on such grounds. In the eighteenth cen-
tury it made war on the Spaniards
because a master mariner reported that a
guarda-costa had boarded his brig and
cut off one of his ears. As proof he pro-
duced the ear. Enemies afterwards in-
sinuated that he had lost it in the pillory.
In the nineteenth century Palmerston sent
a fleet to Athens because compensation
had been refused to a Portuguese-Jew,
born at Gibraltar, whose house had been
burned down by anti-Semitic Greeks. It
seems, however, to be thought in Aus-
tralia that our mobs are not as foreign
mobs are, and that, in any case, we may
do or countenance with impunity things
which in other countries are accounted
perilous. There are even editors who
think along these lines.
A Sydney newspaper, while allowing
that there could be “no excuse” for “the
few hot-headed Australians” who
“burned and looted foreign property
and wrongfully expelled the stranger
from his liome,” issued a solemn warn-
ing to the Consuls concerned. They must
be careful what they said. They would
“only exacerbate the anti-foreign senti-
ment lying at the root of all the trouble”
if they “made arrogant demands upon the
decent Australian who has raised his
voice against the rioters.” A Melbourne
newspaper delivered itself of the opinion
that “the foreigner” who had “any in-
tegrity of mind and any acquaintance with
Australia would at once acquit it of any
corporate responsibility” for the wanton
destruction of life and property. “On the
goldfields,” according to this oracle,
“certain groups of foreigners elect to
isolate themselves.” For these and other
reasons “resentment is natural,” though
“the antipathy is not racial but econo-
mic.” In any case, there had been provo-
cation: an Australian had been “mur-
dered by a foreigner.” The truth is that
the Australian died after a stand-up fight;
the other party, an Italian, is held on a
charge of manslaughter.
Such writers are living in a fools’ para-
dise. Their minds have stagnated in
a dead-and-gone world, a world in which
the British Navy was stronger than any
two other navies afloat, in which one
Englishman was a match for five French-
men, and Japan was merely a subject
for comic opera, and Italy and Germany
were five or six weeks away, and over-
production and retaliatory tariffs were
things undreamt of, and Government
finance was merely a matter of floating a
half-yearly loan.
We must abandon these archaic ideas
or it will be the worse for us. Australia
is no longer an infant colony protected
by an indulgent and all-powerful parent.
It has grown up, and that in an age
which has witnessed such revolutionary
changes in means of communication and
striking power that —on the word of
the man who was First Lord of the
Admiralty when the Great War broke
out —Britain itself is no longer secure.
Australia has a greater area than any
country in Europe, except Soviet Russia.
It has a larger population than Sweden,
still an important European State, and not
only Sweden but Denmark, Norway,
Finland, Latvia, Esthonia, Lithuania,
Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal (without the
Azores and Madeira) and Switzerland. It
is a member of the Council of the League
of Nations. And like all other nations,
whether members of the League or not,
it is responsible for mob outrages on
foreign minorities and must protect itself
against enemies, within its gates and
without.
A LIVING MUSEUM PIECE.
S. A. Mitchell, the scholarly curator of
the National Museum in Melbourne, an-
nounces the formation of an Anthropo-
logical Society for the purpose of pre-
serving and scientifically studying Binghi
in his native habitat. Prof. Wood Jones,
one of the world’s leading anatomists, is
one of the guiding spirits of the organi-
sation, and it is proposed to mobilise all
the best intelligence in the country and to
take advantage of the centenary for in-
teresting outside experts in the project.
Mitchell remarks that Australians
generally are “content to watch the abo-
riginal proprietor of the soil die.” This
is not the case. Men like Basedow,
Spencer and Gillen and a host of other
workers can hardly be said to have been
indifferent either to the material welfare
of Binghi or to his scientific importance.
Missionaries, an army of them, have
labored arduously and devotedly in the
vineyard, and Governments have spasmo-
dically tried to prevent the demise of
the Australian stone-age man from be-
coming an open scandal. The general
public, when it thinks of it at all, is
simply bewildered. If the experts, both
spiritual and scientific, produce such
poor results, how is the plain citizen to
know what to do about it?
The problem bristles with difficulties
far greater than those which confronted
the white man brought into contact with
the Red Indian and with the Maori. Both
those races had a considerable social
organisation, an instinct for tribal co-
operation and racial pride of the first
order. War with the white man, far
from destroying them, moulded them
into a greater unity than they had before
the Caucasian’s advent. It taught them
discipline and made them proud of them-
selves. It compelled their enemies to
pay some consideration to their interests.
When a Maori or Indian tribe was de-
feated, there was something left with
which to negotiate. Measures proposed
for their benefit could be understood, for
they had an aristocracy of leaders, laws
of property, habits of industry and a
standard of living the same in kind, if
not in degree, as their conquerors.
Binghi is in a different category. He
has no more racial sense or feeling of
unity than a koala. He has an immensely
complicated system of taboos governing
marriage between members of different
totem clans, a legal code largely con-
cerned with retributive murder, and a
vague appreciation of property rights
over hunting grounds running into mil-
lions of acres. He drifts about the con-
tinent, the helpless prey of itinerant
scoundrels, Malay or Japanese trepang
smugglers and the more ignorant type of
missionary, whose highest ideal of native
beatitude is a white nightshirt which
gives the wearer pneumonia, and psalm-
singing, which bores him to distraction.
If the scientists take a hand, it will
be interesting to see what they can do
about it. If vast reservations are put
aside, they will require an army of
policemen, not only to keep the white
men out but to keep the natives in. For
Binghi has just the same thirst for the
delights of civilisation as has his Cau-
casian brother. If he is allowed to do
so, he will gravitate to the delights of
Darwin and a weekly go at the pictures.
The evolutionary appetite cannot be
denied, and subject races always admire
the clothes, customs and values of the
people who have the power over them.
It may be, of course, that the scientists
will succeed in getting a select collec-
tion of the stone-age fauna isolated in
a sort of vacuum, where they can prac-
tise their ancient rites without interfer-
ence, so that anthropologists can study
them at their leisure. In that case, they
will be a kind of living museum exhibit.
But it is unlikely to last more than a
generation.
CAUBOY.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Not Quite a Revolution.
Chautemps has come and gone ; and so
has Daladier. Doumergue, once Presi-
dent, has been summoned from his south-
ern farm to form a Government. Mean-
while there was brisk rioting, which
Royalists and Reds —so often allied in
the stormy history of France since 1789
—did their best to expand into a revolu-
tion.
The Place de la Concorde is an ideal,
if ironically named, spot for a riot. On
one side are the Tuileries gardens ; on the
other, the end of the Champs Elysees, a
n ’agnificent avenue either for charge or re-
treat, with the Beaux Arts and the Grand
Palais to provide plenty of windows
through which to heave a brick. Back-
stage is the street which leads straight
to the Madeleine, a handy shrine in which
to lay the dead; just round the
corner to the left is the British Embassy,
so that anybody with a grudge against
perfidious Albion may lodge his protest
without too long a walk.
The Place faces on to the muddy Seine.
Southward in the distance lie the Palace
of Justice and Notre Dame to remind
one of the future which overtakes most
revolutionaries; across the river, directly
facing the Pont de la Concorde, the
Chamber of Deputies, with its 12 columns
and the Ministry for War, with the
German Embassy hard by near the water-
front in case there is room for an over-
flow meeting.
It is a great region for a scrap. But,
according to the rules, revolution does
not get outside its boundaries unless
France as a whole is involved. Most of
the revoluting is done by the large foreign
element and the young bloods who make
an appreciable proportion of the popula-
tion of a country which returns 319
Socialists of various breeds and 20 Com-
munists to a House of 615 deputies; the
balance is split up among five parties
which range from Independent Radicals
to Democratic Republicans. Middle-aged
Parisians, however, go on with their mar-
keting, their bocks and aperitifs, and their
eternal reading of newspapers on the
boulevards.
The danger-signal in all revolutions is
the provinces. It doesn’t matter much
if the breaking of heads is confined to the
Champs Elysees region, but so soon as
the country begins saying things the
more staid section of Paris puts its top-
hat away in camphor and repairs to the
barricades. Normally the Frenchman’s
life, contrary to the opinion created by
tourist bureaus and comic newspapers, is
so drab, frugal and hard-working that he
must have a bust-up once every genera-
tion.
4
More Homes for Voters.
The Stevens Government has evolved
another home-building scheme. During
the loan-drunk years Australian Govern-
ments built homes at a dizzy rate, and a
great many of the purchasers lived to
wish they had never seen the dashed
places, soldiers as well as civilians.
At the end of the Lang regime 25,522
of them were in arrears to the Home
Advances Department of the N.S.W.
Rural Bank, and most of them are still
in arrears. Over 1000 have handed their
dwellings back to the bank. Nevertheless,
the stupid business is to be revived. No
doubt many of the Government houses
will be run up in Sydney suburbs which
can’t support their present population,
and in which 40 or 50 p.c. of the rate-
payers are behind with the rates.
Under the new scheme the Govern-
ment proposes to advance 85 p.c. of the
security value of the home, the bene-
ficiary providing the rest in cash or land.
In some cases, it is hoped, employers will
provide the land or the wherewithal to
buy it. The “S. M. Herald” interviewed
subdivision specialists, building-trade
people and suburban mayors, and they
all expressed warm approval of the plan ;
but there has been no audible praise in
any other quarter. Building costs have
fallen, but they are still high; suburban
land values are down, but they are still
inflated; moreover, jobs are still hard to
get and easy to lose. Therefore this form
of paternalism looks a very bad bet
from the taxpayers’ standpoint, though
good enough possibly from the stand-
point of a party with an election in the
offing.
Where Tasmania Leads.
Tasmania, which has fewer people than
Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, and
scarcely any more than Brisbane or
Perth, has cause to pat itself on its back
for having used its water power on a
large scale to develop electricity. Its
arrangements are businesslike and free
from political trammels, and the return
on its investment of £3,800,000 is suffi-
cient to meet all charges, including in-
terest, and pay the Treasury a small
profit.
Other States might follow its example.
Victoria has certainly gone a long way
with electrification, and its Commission,
if sometimes arrogant and apt to trample
on individual rights, shows the way in
enterprise to private firms. It has control
of all lines in the State carrying a volt-
age of 500 and over, and it is discussing
the institution of the grid system, now
in vogue in England, which has brought
cheap power intensively to country
centres.
N. S. Wales and Queensland, however,
are backward. Sydney, in which nearly
all industrial power is electric, and New-
castle, which has particularly live electri-
cal management, absorb most of the
effort, but highly modern station-supply
arrangements are not backed up with
modern salesmanship of current such as
is in vogue, for instance, in Durban or
Toronto to induce housewives and others
to use more amperage and place the
trade in units on a payable basis.
Schemes like Nymboida (northern
N.S.W.), which have lived, prospered
and quadrupled in a few years, bring-
ing current to the doors of hundreds of
farmhouses in the face of discourage-
ment and difficulty, show what can be
done in country electrification. While
hydro-power may never be sufficient at
all seasons to supply all country dis-
tricts, it is enough in some parts. What
is wanted in most districts is a combina-
tion service—a triple infeed for southern
N. S. Wales from Port Kembla-Burren-
juck and the Victorian lines, with, per-
haps, in time the Snowy River used to
add to the supply; the pushing out of
Railway Department mains, which
already are well over the Blue Mountains,
and the provision of a further supply
from coal generated from the Lithgow
field (though, of course, the lack of a
large water-supply stands in the way of
a great industrial power-house there);
the bracketing of Nymboida with other
small schemes, possible on rivers flowing
to the coast off the New England Plateau,
and with the Newcastle output; the
development of Jackadgery and its link-
ing with Brisbane and Bundamba ; the
extension of Brisbane lines into the North
Coast —and so on right to the Barron
Falls, where an effort is being made to
establish a hydro-electric dam.
In Japan scarcely a village farmhouse
is without electric light. The same might
be said of most Norwegian villages within
reasonable reach of civilisation and of
such countries as Hungary. In Scandi-
navian cities electric cooking has almost
displaced the wood- and gas-stove.
Outside the heart of our big cities,
however, current is too dear to allow of
such a development. If Governments
want to use their unemployed to slap
about with wet cement and cut poles,
let them put the labor into power-houses
and schemes calculated to cheapen rural
electricity and develop country-town
manufactures.

‘‘Stuart Doyles.”
Giving evidence at the Sydney film
inquiry Stuart Doyle asserted that his
combine had been forced by American
pressure to build theatres and had raised
£1,800,000 for this purpose. Asked why
he had made no mention of this “pres-
sure” in company prospectuses, the gen-
tleman seemed astonished that such a
point should be raised. Confronted with
evidence that he had boasted of his enter-
prise in building theatres and had in fact
solicited in writing the praise of one of
the very companies which, he alleges,
forced on the extravagant building pro-
gramme, he described his letter as
“applesauce.”
Another combine witness has made this
illuminating admission:
A press statement by Mr. Stuart Doyle that
General Theatres had ample supply of films
to carry on indefinitely was not correct. It
was made to keep people coming to corpora-
tion theatres; it was not “applesauce”—
merely trade publicity.
Stevens has promised a new Companies
Act. If it is worth a row of pins it
will make company promoters and
directors responsible for what they pub-
lish and for concealment of material
facts —compel them to tell the truth and
not indulge in “Stuart Doyles.”
Dalwoodf Home Sobstuff.
“J.E.8.”: When The Bulletin criticised
the operations of the charity-collecting
agency which is such a big circumstance
in Sydney—it seems to dominate every-
thing, from the flapper press to the
Employers’ Federation —it said nothing
about the Dalwood Health Home. May
1 repair the omission?
Dalwood is for cases whose history
begins “Lying in a house at Newtown
was a mother of three children
dying.” The coterie that runs the Com-
munity Hospital, St. Margaret’s, the Food
for Babies Fund and so forth forms a
leaven in patrons and boards and house
governors whose names include that of
B. S. B. Stevens.
There are two publicity men—the
Prime Minister’s office gets along very
well with one. Now let’s have some
statistics:
Approx, number of committee and
workers whose names are adver-
tised in the annual report .. 104
Salaries and wages shown in the
balance sheet £7Ol 0 0
No. of persons passing through
homes during a year (76
mothers and 332 children) .. 408
Total expenses shown in balance
sheet .. .. .. .. £2406 0 0
Average per person (approx.) .. £6 0 0
Average cost of food per person
per annum (approx.) .. .. £1 10 0
Average Government subsidy per
person .. .. .. .. £0 16 8
Total receipts shown in balance
sheet, exclusive of £350 Govern-
ment subsidy .. .. .. £2022 9 7
Amount of untotalled donations
and stunt proceeds —they are
enumerated on pp. 12 to 28 in
annual report—which must be
included in the above £2022 if
balance sheet is correct .. £4456 19 0
And these items are worth looking at:
Milk, £166 ; travelling and car expenses,
£129; laundry, £172; publicity and
advertising—the annual report cost £2O
or I’m no printer—£l2 17s. sd.
The Premier might attend the next
committee meeting. As an accountant
he should enjoy a good look at the
balance sheet.

Menace of Refainement.
Well-meaning people have been writing
to “S. M. Herald” about what they call
“Teachers’ English.” Some commend it;
more reprobate it as “lacking in refine-
ment.” The idea obtains in some quar-
ters that, owing to the remissness of the
teachers, young Australians are acquiring
“a common accent.” Horrible examples
have been given: “Orstrylian,” “die” (for
day), “good-ow” and several American-
isms. One correspondent mentioned cer-
tain Hollywood stars as the bane,
Ronald Colman as the antidote.
The battle has been fought out in
England ; and, to an extent, won by the
forces of gentility, with appalling results.
Until a few years ago most English
people had regional accents, and there
was no self-consciousness about it. Many
a backwoods peer showed his county of
origin—English, Irish or Scotch —as
clearly as old Sir Pitt Crawley used to do.
The Americans were the disturbing ele-
ment, as they have been here. Their
highly expressive slang caught on. They
claimed, in a series of silly and unreal
talkies, to have won the war; they in-
sisted on the return of the money lent to
those who had borne the brunt of the
fighting. Patriotic Britons became super-
cilious at their expense. But it is hard
to be supercilious in a provincial accent;
still more so in a Cockney accent. “Re-
fainement,” as St. John Ervine calls it,
suddenly broke out all over the country.
For half a dozen years or more it has
been impossible to go into any big West
End shop without encountering girls
behind the counters who torture their
vowels busily and mercilessly. Motor-
car salesmen are terrors at it; barbers
are, if possible, worse. Every other
typist has the throaty voice and nauseated
expression of a musical-comedy duchess,
and there are young fellows selling ties
in Piccadilly and its purlieus who would
be cold-bloodedly slaughtered in a less
law-abiding country. Their artificial arti-
culation and voices—comic to some, in-
furiating to others —represent the best
that board-school products can do in the
way of imitating Ronald Colman, Elissa
Landi or whoever it may be.
Our State schools are the equivalent of
England’s board schools, and it is impos-
sible here to distinguish State-school from
most G.P.S. products by their speech. If
the efforts of English educationists, aided
by many extraneous advantages (one
being that a genuinely cultivated voice is
an asset in almost any English calling),
can do no better than produce millions
of refained voices, then where is the
sense in Australian educationists attempt-
ing the task? It would be much better
if they left our national accent alone.
One thing, anyhow, can be said for it;
it is the most audible of all accents. In
any event it is ineradicable, like every
other regional accent. The retained
accent which, according to G. B. Shaw
and others, is sweeping over England like
a disease is only a phase. Future genera-
tions will speak as most English people
have always spoken—naturally.

Now It's Colebatch’s Turn.
But he had to wait nearly 15 years:
Colebatch, the Westralian Agent-General,
must have read the reports of the goldfields
rioting with a sardonic grin. He himself was
concerned in an experience of the kind, and
on that occasion Labor politicians who figured
with masterly inactivity in the recent un-
pleasantness were his bitterest critics.
Called to the Premiership in 1919, Cole-
batch found the position difficult. For one
thing, he was a member of the Legislative
Council ; and “Nationalists” in the other
House were oddly reluctant to provide their
new leader with a seat. , Then he had to con-
tend from the outset with a hold-up on the
waterfront at Fremantle.
Ever since the 1917 strike there had been
two unions of lumpers, who for most of the
time had had to be held apart by the police.
Of recent weeks the quarrel had reached a
stage where even the police were powerless to
protect members of the smaller “loyalist” union
from the fury of the larger, which had been
involved in the strike. Then the Dimboola
arrived laden with butter and bacon, of which
there was a local shortage.
Alleging that the vessel might be bearing
the bacilli of influenza, then raging in other
States, the “old” lumpers refused to unload
her or to let the “new” lumpers do it. They
chased the “new” lumpers off the wharf at
which she was berthed, and took possession of
it themselves. Colebatch thought he saw in this
situation a chance of earning the admiration
of a baconless and butterless democracy, and
thus of consolidating his power.
Late one Saturday he chartered a launch in
Perth and manned it with volunteers charged
with the duty of recapturing the wharf for
the Government and barricading it so that the
new union might unload the Dimboola in
safety. Most of his volunteers he got at night
from Perth clubs, notably the Commercial
Travellers. In those days there was a type of
bagman —perhaps there still is—who on Satur-
day night, at a distance of 12,000 miles, would
have fought Jack Johnson.
In boisterous spirits the adventurers set off
down the river on their 12-mile journey to Fre-
mantle. But progress was slow, and news of
their coming had preceded them. Sobering
evidence of this was forthcoming when in the
grey light of dawn the craft passed under a
bridge. She was showered with iron bars and
boulders. Fortunately they all went wide of
their human marks. A similar experience
befel the voyagers when their argosy reached
a second bridge. Among the missiles this time
was a huge lump of rock, which just missed
staving in the boat.
Arrived at their journey’s end, the volun-
teers found there a few policemen ready
to help them and an ever-increasing mob,
armed with sticks and hooks and masses
of coal, over-willing to hinder them. By
this time Colebatch’s bagmen, far from
being in a mood to tackle Jack Johnson, would
have been disinclined to offend Tom Thumb.
Lumps of blue metal were cast among them and
their friends and protectors, and a confused
shindy began. Numbers prevailed; the forces of
law and order were borne back towards the
edge of the harbor. Tliey were in danger of
being thrown into the harbor when a truce was
hurriedly arranged between the Premier and
McCallum, the Labor member for South Fre-
mantle, who loomed up among the lumpers,
although he was not their leader. The terms
were that the police should quit the wharves
and that the volunteers should go back to Perth
immediately. They were made more stringent
when it was learned that one of the lumpers
was dying. After savage assaults on constables,
the police were withdrawn from Fremantle, and
on the day of the funeral the Government trams
and trains were halted for three minutes.
The loyalist union had meanwhile scattered
far and wide. Although it had a legal standing,
it never loaded or unloaded another pound of
stuff at Fremantle.
The affair was fatal to Colebatch’s Ministry.
Within a fortnight he had handed back his
commission. Before and after the event he was
bitterly reviled by Labor politicians, who held
him responsible for the death and swore they
would drive him out of public life. They
also made the most contemptuous remarks
about his lack of nerve at the crisis. Still the
man did attempt something. He was present at
the scene of danger. This is more than can be
said for his Labor critics when put to the test
at Kalgoorlie; they did nothing but talk.
One man lost his life while mixed up in
a mob which attacked the police; two
men were killed on the Golden Mile (one
poor devil while defending his home) in a not
which swift and resolute action on the part ot
the Labor Government might have pre-
vented. For there had been a riot m Kal-
goorlie the previous night and the Labor Gov-
ernment had a full 24 hours in which to pro-
vide against repetition. The same McCallum
was in Kalgoorlie as Minister of Labor and
Works. So was Mr. J. J. Kenneally, as Minister
of Employment and Industrial Development.
Possibly the Golden Mile mob might have been
restrained by the presence and eloquence of
these gentlemen, backed by such force as was
available ; but they did not attend the pro-
ceedings.
Yes, Colebatch must have smiled wintrily
when he read the report of the race riots and let
his memory go back to the events of May, 1919.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Deeahree”: A tourist of my ac-
quaintance, motoring to Sydney with his
wife, stayed the night at a Blue

“A.L.”: At Esperance (W.A.), where
the Government is spending £120,000 on
a new jetty, State Ministers, members of
Parliament, early officials, oldest inhabi-
tants and others gathered for the inaugu-
ral ceremony, and one of the speakers
delivered himself thus:
It gives me the greatest pleasure to be
in Esperance to-day, having received an invi-
tation to see the Minister for Works drive the
first pile of the new jetty through Mr. Nulsen,
the member for Kanowna.
The Minister drove the pile, but not

“Cellarman”: These yarns about the
potency of alcoholic liquors matured in
the bottle seem to me to be tinctured by
relativity. In most cases cited the liquor
is discovered in desolate places by ex-
plorers who haven’t had a taste for
months, and in at least one instance the
booze was consumed in the Arctic. In
normal circumstances a man gets drunk
if he takes in more absolute alcohol than
his nervous system can cope with. Beer
and stout can’t develop more than 10 p.c.
of alcohol at the outside, no matter how
long the liquor is kept in the bottle, and
if it goes bad it acts as an emetic, and
promptly defeats its function as an in-
toxicant. Some wines increase their
alcoholic content with age, and if they
start out at 30 p.c., like some of our sher-
ries, they may be a little bit stronger after
a lapse of years ; but I don’t believe that
any “seasoned toper” would give a testi-
monial to 15-year-old stout or 40-year-
old beer. A teetotaller who sampled any
commercial brew or vintage might get
very tight on a quaff that contained an
ounce of absolute alcohol. S. H. Prior,
who knew Henry Lawson better than
most men, used to say that Henry got
squiffy if he had a drop more than a
couple of pints of beer —equivalent in
Lawson’s day to about two ounces of
alcohol. And Henry wasn’t exactly a
teetotaller.

“Craiser”: Ben Fuller’s half-a-million
project in Bourke-street will be the big-
gest theatrical mushroom erected in Mel-
bourne since the State and Regent raced
each other to completion. It will replace
the old ramshackle Bijou, under whose
foyer is a network of basements and
cellars, reminiscent of the Roman cata-
combs. It was in an odd corner of
these that Squizzy Taylor fitted up com-
fortable quarters and defied capture for
six weeks. The Bijou began as the
Academy of Music in 1876, and subse-
quently enjoyed an artistic renaissance
under the Brough-Boucicault manage-
ment. Since then it has had two film
theatres built into it. The new edifice
will include a hotel, a swimming pool, a
buffet and a theatre with seats for 4500.
* * * *
“Emancipist”: Royal and semi-royal
peregrinations in the old times were fre-
quently signalised by the release of
prisoners, the idea doubtless being that
they ought to have a chance of partici-
pating whole-heartedly in the general re-
joicings. Villon on one occasion owed not
“There were no such things as bathing costumes in my young days.”
“Oh, AUNTIE!”
only his liberty but his life to the pleasing
practice, and celebrated it in grateful
verse. I thought this sort of gaol-delivery
had gone out of fashion in English-speak-
ing communities, but the South African
Government, possibly because of its Dutch
traditions, has marked the arrival of
Prince George in the Union by “ordering
a remission df three months in the un-
expired portion of all sentences.” Now
that Hertzog has given a lead in this
sort of loyal gesture, will Australian Gov-
ernments think it incumbent on them to
follow suit?
“G.S.L.”: “Hotham” (B. 31/l/’34)
stretches things when he states that “still-
burning fragments of wood” were carried
right across Bass Strait when the awful
1851 fires were raging in Victoria. What
really happened was this. Melbourne was
shrouded in an impenetrable fog of
stiflingly hot smoke, driven by a furious
northerly gale, on “Black Thursday,”
while from the sky there later fell a rain
of ash and flakes of charcoal, still hot to
the touch. Later on Tasmania was
shrouded in the same smoke, now cold,
and from the sky the same rain of soot,
ash and fragments of burnt wood, bark
and leaves descended. The newspaper
files of those days will bear this out.
* * * *
“Bert the Carpenter”: The Emden gun
and the Emden bell are far from being
the only souvenirs of the German warship
in Australia (B. 31/l/’34). Brass tokens
bearing the words “Kantine Emden” and
the value in pfennigs or marks were
issued to the crew in lieu of cash and
were good for their face value at the
ship’s canteen. Shortly after the Emden
had been run ashore, seamen from a cargo
vessel pulled over to the wreck and
helped themselves liberally to these
tokens. The acquisitive mariners did a
roaring trade with them whenever they
struck Aussie troopships. I bought one
myself from a wireless operator, was
given another by a friend, and have de-
posited one of them on loan with the
Adelaide Museum.
* * * *
“Trafalgar Square”: I can recall the
riot of 1886 in London when the mob
fairly took charge of a portion of the
city for some hours. After order had
been restored there was a public outcry
for scapegoats, the police heads being held
particularly responsible in that they
hadn’t foreseen and guarded against the
possible effects of what was originally a
Socialist demonstration. The Commis-
sioner of Police was one Henderson—
he had started his official career as an
officer in charge of Westralian convicts
at Fremantle—and out went Henderson,
a disgraced man, to the accompaniment
of a “Punch” cartoon depicting him as
“The Great Unprepared.” I suppose that
in Australia, where there is so much
political interference with departmental
heads, it would be unjust to put all the
blame on a Police Commissioner for any
city or town or district being inade-
quately protected from the possibility of
violence or disorder, but he should cer-
tainly have to shoulder some of it.
* * * *
“P.N.R”: “Craiser’s” statement that
“Vic. police have a voluntary blood-
transfusion corps always at the service
of the public” (B. 31/1/ ’34) is mis-
leading. The policemen who give their
blood when called upon are mem-
bers of the Vic. Red Cross Blood Trans-
fusion Service, which was established by
the society three and a half years ago
and, like the one in England referred to
by “General Prac.,” goes with a click.
It serves all the Melb. metrop. hospitals
to the tune of about 18 transfusions a
month. Besides the police, there are listed
and ready to serve at any time of the
day or night clerks (men and women),
artisans, firemen, engineers, students, and
what not —200 in all. None of them pose
as heroes, but there is something smack-
ing of courage in the answer to a call
at 2 a.m. on a frosty morning or at 6.30
p.m., just as the dinner-bell goes.
* * * *
“Nakh”: Every time a royal visitor is
expected in Melbourne an agitation arises
for improving the gateway to the city
and the road leading therefrom. It is cer-
tainly a dismal thoroughfare, but the agi-
tation seems to come from vested interests.
Personages never use the route, anyhow,
When the present King and Queen arrived
at Port Melbourne in 1901 they were
taken in a launch to St. Kilda and landed
on the jetty there, whence they pro-
ceeded between cheering thousands along
St. Kilda-road, which is the pride and
joy of every patriotic Melburnian. The
same thing happened with the Prince of
Wales and the Duke and Duchess of
York, and nothing is more certain than
that in the case of Prince George the
same precedent will be followed. Ordi-
nary tourists will continue to travel by
the direct route.

Wilfred Ryan, sec. Animal Welfare
League of Victoria, writes:
If “Dr. Mivart” would pay a visit to our
institution at Parkville (Melbourne) I feel sure
he would realise the injustice of spme ot his
statements about the “Hospital for Sick Animals
of Poor People” (B. 17/1/ 34). A tethal
chamber is never used, as it is not considered
sufficiently humane. Cats are chloroformed,
and dogs and horses are shot by an expert.
Dogs and cats are never kidnapped or shang-
haied, but are always brought or sen) to the
hospital by their owners; it is only with their
consent that the animals’ sufferings, even when
they are incurably ill, are mercifully ended.

“Spare Walton”: That Melbourne artist
who caught a centuries-old carp on a
bent pin in the Luxembourg Gardens
(B. 7/2/’34) ought to join the Dry Fly
Club, which admits no one as a member
using anything but spider-web tackle.
The carp is a good fighter for a coarse
fish, and if allowed to live long enough
runs up to 301 b. or more in weight. If
the artist had said he had “guddled” the
catch, or “tickled” him or even “wired”
him with the aid of his mahl-stick and his
lady friend’s garter—all Parisian art
students are supposed to have lady
friends —I could have believed him. As
it is I think the yarn must come from

wife who stoked the primus with ben-

Going on a holiday, the missus left
the girl to do the cooking, with orders
to make melon jam in her spare time.
“And don’t forget to put in the tartaric
acid” was the final instruction. Thomasina
boiled the melons and absent-mindedly
stirred in a tin of baking soda. Realising
her mistake she then added the acid.

“Schnorrer”: One of the participants
in a recent controversy about the wearing
of slacks and shorts by women quoted a
passage from Deuteronomy in which male
wearers of women’s clothes and female
wearers of men’s apparel were declared
an abomination. Nevertheless, the Old
Testament is liable to be a dangerous
guide in matters of this sort. In the same
book it is laid down that wearers of
feminine apparel were to be “cut off”
with stones. There is also a prohibition
against the wearing of garments in which
different materials are blended, which
would condemn about 90 per cent, of
modern clothing. This last seems to have
been an attempt to popularise the use of
wool among a pastoral people; the
penalty attached to the wearing of
woman’s clothes by a man was almost
certainly devised to prevent evasion of
war service.

“Pawang”: The Industrial Health Re-
search Board in England recently con-
ducted an inquiry into what factory girls
talk about. It found their conversations
divided into the following categories: 42

ditions ; 14, local gossip ; 12, clothes; 11,
local events ; 10, suicides and murders.
I once went to great trouble to learn
the Malay tongue in order to find
out what Malays talked about. After
acquiring such a command of the lan-
guage that I could read all the classics
and enjoy a native grand opera, I dis-
covered that I couldn’t understand a
word of a pavement conversation, so I
went to further pains to master the local
dialect and its enormous slang vocabu-
lary. Then I pursued my investigations
on the pavements. My findings were
almost exactly the same as those of the
English board of scientific experts, ex-
cept that the price of food held pride of
place in the intellectual interests of the
Malayan female and scandal about their
white mistresses and masters the second.

“Erua”: It isn’t only hotels that are
liable to suffer from the bottle-substitution
trick (B. 7/2/’34). In our N.S.W. town-
ship a stranger called at the chemist’s
and asked for a large bottle of medicated
wine. He removed the wrapping, osten-
sibly to examine the brand, and, re-
marking that all was correct, placed
the bottle in his suitcase and began
to count out the money. Then he
discovered he was two shillings short, and
asked the chemist to hold the purchase
while he dashed into the pub and cashed
a cheque. The bottle he handed to the
vendor, filled with maroon dye, is still
on the pharmacy shelf.

“Blanc”: Visiting certain towns in
N.S.W. I find evidence of the sort of
pensive pride in a missed distinction that
animates the babu who writes “Failed
8.A.” beneath his signature. Tumut resi-
dents take the visitor to the neighboring
-Lacmalac hills and point out that these
narrowly missed being the site of the
Federal capital; Dalgety shows a magni-
ficent site across the rushing Snowy River,
and still speaks fondly ,of Austin Chap-
man for pushing its claims ; at Delegate
they will tell you “We’re pretty dead
now, but we were in the running once” ;
Albury says “We would have had
it, but Sydney thought we were too
near Melbourne”; Yass still derives
comfort from the consideration that it
was seriously proposed; Bathurst and
Orange are both confident that they were
only robbed of their due by the nasti-
ness of Victorians. And not one of them
that isn’t convinced, perhaps with jus-
tice, that it would have made a much
better capital than Canberra.
* * * *
“Kerys”: We were climbing a hill at
an ultra-popular marine resort when we
were confronted by a board bearing the
legend “Its-a-pittee.” Could imbecility go
farther? It beats even the Maori specialty
“Okikuperau,” a thinly disguised equiva-
lent for “Oh, Kick up a Row!” which
decorates hosts of week-end shacks.
“Why the lipstick? It’s a moonlight picnic we’re going to, and nobody will see it.”
“But somebody might taste it.”
“Emel”: I am thinking about writing
an ode to Roosevelt. From “House and
Garden” (U.S.A.) I received a cheque for
12 dollars, the dollar then being quoted
at over six shillings. Then I had all the
excitement of watching the dollar rise,
fall sharply, and finally right itself before
the bank, having collected overseas,
cashed my cheque for four pounds seven
and six. And all for 12 lines of verse.

“Adelaide”: “Archbishop with a Re-
volver” has made a good heading in the
Adelaide papers. A man from Perth,
with an old griev-
ance about his
brother’s grave,
took it at last to
the home of Arch-
bishop Spence.
On his own evi-
dence, he was
carrying an axe
(bought for his
landlady), a sol-
dering-iron (for
his own protec-
tion as a capital-
ist) and a packet
of pepper (used as
snuff). He broke
the glass of the
front door, then
went to another
and knocked with
the axe, “and the
door flew open.”
The archbishop
came along with
a “g un” and
heard his story,
and he left, hav-
ing no evil inten-
tions from start
to finish. He was
charged with forcible entry. A clever
young lawyer argued that this implies
entering to claim the property. The
Court agreed, and told the axe-wielder
to go away.
* * * *
“Deeahree”: Somerset Maugham, re-
cently criticised for certain errors in local
color, had more excuse than some of
our local novelists. In a serial that
appeared not long since in an Australian
daily, the writer —“a gifted young Aus-
tralian authoress,” to quote the blurb—
started off to describe a Queensland
drought: “Shimmering heat scorched
and grassless plains dried-up water-
holes .... dying sheep,” etc. She then
sent the boss and a jackeroo out to treat
the sheep for—footrot!
“Idle Imp”: Apropos of “Prosit’s”
story (B. 17/l/’34) of the Rothenburg
burgomaster who saved his city from
Tilly by draining a gallon of wine at a
draught, a Brisbane pub for years kept
a gallon beaker of beer which was
offered free to any man who could drink
it through a straw without taking a
breath. Dozens tried it, but the feat
was never performed, though on occa-
sions the liquor was lowered almost to
the bottom.
“Spokeshave”: “Romeo and Juliet” was
recently performed in Moscow after
the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute had
approved of it in these words:
Shakspeare’s artistic power is due to his
destructive criticism of capitalism That is
why the bourgeoisie fears the real William Shak-
speare.
It is amusing to put this judgment along-
side that of the French deputies who
kicked up a fuss about a produc-
tion of “Coriolanus” in Paris, objecting
to the insults the Roman patrician hurls
at the mob as derogatory to the electors
of a free republic.
* * * ¥
“Alkali Ike”: The other day I
wambled down a thoroughfare in the
Sydney metropolitan area till I came to
a spot where streets intersect at an angle
that is several degrees from being right.
There wasn’t a cop in sight, but, still
playing for safety, I steered for an island
in the middle —a raised platform sur-
rounding a monument. Suddenly a warn-
ing shout from behind made me retrace
my steps, to meet the broad smile of a
young cop. “Now there’s four of you,”
he said, and indicated three other scowl-
ing citizens. “If you want to cross the
street you must do so in a straight line.”
“I did,” said I; “I made a beeline for
that monument.” “You did,” he ad-
mitted, “but you jay- walked. You must
cross the street at right angles.” En-
lightenment broke in on me ; I saw the
frame-up. The cop and three of his
colleagues were stationed at places a long
way round the corners, but in line with
the wrong-angled streets. “Cross now,”
said the cop, “in the proper way.” “I
have lost interest in your monument,”
said I distantly, and fell into step with
three of the native-born who also had
no desire to tussle with a cock-eyed law.
They all looked hot about the collar. As
we paced down the left-hand side of the
street, four abreast, No. 1 said: “Great
big slob ; a man ought to dong him one.”
No. 2: “I wish I’d taken that cove’s
number.” No. 3 (very savagely): “I’ve
had three cars stolen in six months, and
what do they do about it?” No. 4 (me):
“Let’s come down to-morrow and get
arrested for the same offence ; I’ll put
up my share of defence expenses.” “You
wouldn’t have a chance!” said 1, 2 and 3
in chorus.
BALLADE OF GEORGE AND JIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Commonwealth Government has invited the
Dominions Secretary, Mr. J. H. Thomas, to accompany
Prince George.”
A happy notion! What a perfect foil
Each for the other should perforce supply—
Prince of the blood, and hardy son of toil,
The worker born so low to rise so high
By force of will and dogged industry,
By quenchless vigor and by sturdy vim!
An admirable stroke, you can’t deny,
This thought of supplementing George with
Jim.
No solemn tribune, haggard with the coil
And care of office here you shall descry;
The gall that makes our legislators boil
With spite and bitterness has passed him by.
He has a pretty wit, a merry eye;
He’ll blow the froth from off a tankard’s rim
As readily as any other guy.
He’s no ascetic doctrinaire, is Jim.
A mixer deft, alike with men who moil
5 And kings (by all accounts); a living tie
Tween class and class —in short, the dinkum
oil,
Self-help in person to exemplify.
What more appropriately picked ally
For royalty, so debonair and trim?
Sure, Lyons shows a sense of symmetry
In seeking thus to bracket George with Jim.
A memorable pair, I’ll certify,
For local bards to sing and artists limn.
To get a glimpse of George there’s lots will
try;
I’d like to have an earful, too, of Jim.

POLITICAL POINTS
The star turn of the Vic. delegation to
the Premiers’ Conference is a demand
that the Federal Government should
evacuate the income-tax field, so that the
States may occupy it. What the taxpayer
would like to hear is the armistice bugles
blow.
Australian Labor was helped in its
early days by the vogue of Markham’s
“Man with the Hoe,” who was “bowed
by the weight of centuries.” A Wollon-
gong alderman has made the odd dis-
covery that the long-handled shovels
issued to Stevens’s relief-workers are also
“bowed.” “Not,” he morosely declares,
“through hard work, but because they
are leant on so much.”
Lang’s clumsiness is contagious. His
cause was espoused last year by the
sketchy Ogilvie, leader of the Tas. Labor
party, and at Ogilvie’s instance the State
Labor executive withdrew from Federal
Labor. It was thought that this would
help Lang to dish Scullin, but present in-
dications are that it will really assist the
man from Yarra, since it will leave
Lang’s Tasmanian friends without repre-
sentation at the “unity” conference.
Everything Lang touches he bungles.
Forde, Scullin’s understudy, went
along to the A.W.U. convention in Syd-
ney and spoke at length about the crying
need for “the nationalisation of banking
and the issuing of the credit resources of
the country for the people and not for
the trading banks.” When the gentleman
had finished, the delegates considered a
report of the manager of Labor Papers,
which “showed that the loss on the
‘World’ was approximately £133,000.”
If banking had been “nationalised” in
Scullin’s time, would “the credit re-
sources of the country” have been drawn
on for the “World”?
Two Premiers will be missing from
this week’s conference in Melbourne.
Tasmania’s McPhee, whose health has
been bad for a twelvemonth or more, has
had to ask Lee to undertake the mission ;
and Argyle, of Victoria, who has a septic
throat, has been obliged to hand over
to Menzies. Neither State is likely to
suffer; the substitute is at least as able
as the absentee.
Abolition of pre-selection ballots is
demanded by an increasing number of
Lang A.L.P. branches. In respect of
Assembly by-elections they have virtually
been abolished by the Sydney bosses,
although there has been no “open go.”
In Hamilton, as in Bulli, the excuse was
that there was no time for a ballot. The
nomination has been bestowed on an
elderly gentleman named Brennan. In
these cases it is always ten to one on
Brennan; any price, Jones.
Forgan Smith is to propose at Mel-
bourne this week that the divorce laws
should be made uniform. His own State’s
divorce law is comparatively advanced,
but because those of other parts are back-
ward distressing anomalies occur which
are commented on from time to time by
Supreme Court Justices. The Common-
wealth, of course, has had power to pass
Australia-wide marriage and divorce laws
for 33 years, but, fearing clericalist hos-
tility, its Governments have never exer-
cised the power.
Stevens’s programme for next session is
a patchwork affair, but some much-needed
reforms are promised. Lottery-share
syndicates promoted for personal profit
are to go ; the lodger vote in City Coun-
cil elections is to be abandoned; the
Companies Act will receive an overhaul;
theatrical cos. are to be registered, so as
to euchre traffickers in female flesh, and
there are to be reforms in metropolitan
transport and hospital affairs —presum-
ably to deal with Golden Jests and the
like. Lastly, defaulting solicitors and
motor thieves are to have drastic atten-
tion. But it seems amazing that about
half the programme should have to be
devoted to such measures. Foreigners
reading the list might well believe that
N. S. Wales is largely inhabited by lot-
tery agents, white-slavers, dishonest
solicitors and go-getters.
Collier will carry one legitimate griev-
ance to the Premiers’ Conference. The
protracted negotiations with Belgium have
issued in a declaration that South Aus-
tralian barley will be admitted to that
country, at least for a time, but imports of
Westralian beef will be prohibited unless
the embargo on sheet glass is removed.
Alternatively, Belgium will admit beef to
THE GANDHI STUNT.
“A Sydney clergyman commends the example of Gandhi: ‘He offers no resistance to
his enemies, loves them indeed, and as a result is revered throughout India.’”
“Nae mair strafin’, ye ken. Tell Stevens an’ Scullin an’ Lyons an’ Willis, an’ all
that clamjamphrie that ye love ’em like porter wi’ y’r parritch.”
the exact value of the sheet glass admitted
to Australia. It is an omen of ruin to
the Government meatworks at Wyndham.
and the Kimberley cattlemen supplying it.
There is a move amongst Melbourne
Centenarians to have liquor-sale hours
extended and dancing permitted on pub
premises during the period of the jolli-
fications. In Ministerial circles, where
there is a wholesome respect for the Pro-
hibition vote, it is held that the alteration
couldn’t be made without an amendment
of the law ; but the Laodiceans maintain
that this is unnecessary. A movement
against six o’clock closing would have
strong support in N. S. Wales, as well
as Victoria. Tasmanians, moreover,
maintain that the maintenance of the war-
time restriction grievously handicaps
them in their fight for tourists with
owners of cruising steamers, who can
laugh at State licensing laws.
Maitland (N.S.W.) “Mercury” has re-
printed The Bulletin’s article on dicta-
phone charges (B. 7/2/’34) and added
facts gathered at first hand:
Within the past four years the cost of trunk-
line telephone services to country newspapers
has increased out of all bounds. Prior to 1929
there was an increase of 30 per cent., followed
by another 40 per cent, at the end of 1930.
In 1931 the minimum cost of a call from
Maitland to Sydney jumped from Is. 2d to
Is. 6d. The charges from February 1, 1934,
have been increased between 40 and 150 per
cent., according to length of call and other
circumstances.
The “Mercury” properly asks by what
right a Government department inflates
its charges to such an outrageous extent
in a depression period. It will get no
reply from Parkhill —he is away in Cairo
having a holiday at the expense of dicta-
phone-users and others.
If Russia and Japan really take their
coats off, China will be the Belgium of
the shindy. It is enormously bigger than
the European cockpit and hence far
more vulnerable. One of the first moves
of the Japanese, if they follow precedent
in these matters, will be to occupy Han-
kow, Wuchang and Hanyang, the Clap-
ham Junction of the shambling republic,
600 miles up the Yangtze, where there
are valuable ironworks, with iron and
coal in juxtaposition. It was here that
Borodin and his henchmen set up a
Soviet regime in 1926.
N.S.W. civil servants are campaigning
briskly for more pay. They declare that
they have suffered harsher financial-emer-
gency cuts than any other body of Gov-
ernment employees In Australia, “pos-
sibly the world.” The case of a married
officer on £6 11s. a week before the slump
is quoted.
He was reduced 16s. by the living-wage de-
clarations and 18s. under the Salaries Reduc-
tion Act. The last amendment of that Act
brought his salary to £4 19s.
It seems a bad case, and no doubt in a
number of instances the reductions have
been inequitably applied. Still, civil ser-
vants have security of tenure, which is
not the case with private employees, and
they have a superannuation scheme
which is a heavy burden on the taxpayer ;
private employees haven’t. Also about
100,000 N.S.W. citizens have no jobs
at all.
Troy, the Westralian Minister of
Lands, has been down in the south-west
inspecting Mitchell’s group settlements,
concerning which a doctor recently re-
ported that farmers were in a desperate
plight and their children half-starved.
The Minister says he saw no evidence of
malnutrition, but he was informed that
50 p.c. of the settlers would never suc-
ceed. In a sense these settlements were
an outcome of the secession spirit. Great
forests were levelled at vast expense so
that tyros might produce butter, butter
being imported from the nefarious
eastern States.
South Africa is to improve its property
and at the same time to provide a lot of
employment by spending a million a year
on reconditioning its railway trunk lines.
One result will be the reduction of the
long run from Capetown to Jo’burg by
about 16 hours. Of South Africa’s
12,600 miles of rail all save 900 are of
uniform gauge, 3ft. 6in. When these rail-
ways were built the Transvaal, the Free
State, Cape Colony and Natal, however
much they feared and distrusted each
other, had the sense to see that inter-
rupted lines of inter-communication were
sheer folly.
Although exports of farm produce to
Britain are only a shadow of what they
were before the first Lang plan was
copied, De Valera asserts that the Free
State farmers are better off than farmers
in “many other countries.”
They have benefited to the extent of
£5,575,000 this financial year through the mora-
torium, bounties and relief from the land annui-
ties and rates.
Still, bounties are a poor substitute for
good prices in a market that used to take
nearly 80 p.c. of the Free State’s exports ;
moreover, De Valera’s subjects have to
stand the racket of the bounties and the
unpaid rates. The one flourishing indus-
try in the 26 counties seems to be the
manufacture of blue shirts for the bhoys
among General O’Duffy’s followers and
blue jumpers for the girls.
From “Hands Off Industry”:
The Commonwealth Taxation Department
issues thousands of “rulings” which have the
force of law. The latest is that it is allowing a
maximum of £520 p.a. as the salary of a direc-
tor in certain private companies and treating
any balance as distributed profit. The effect in
the case of a man who has formed his business
into a co. and taken as director’s fees —after
complying with the Companies Act —a remunera-
tion corresponding to his previous earnings,
and who is perhaps directing the energies of
100 or 1000 people, is that all he has drawn
above £lO a week is to be taxed again on the
higher property rate back to 1930. In the
depression he may have lost half his assets, but
that doesn’t matter to the taxgatherers. It seems
that a N. S. Wales business is to be reassessed
back to 1930 and a Vic. business back to 1931.
Yet “all in together” is the only proper basis
for Federal taxation.

Leading Adelaide citizens who have
turned 70 had a celebration lately. They
were George Murray, Chief Justice;
George Jeffrey, wool expert and mining
director; Barr Smith, pastoralist and
philanthropist; O’Halloran Giles, his law-
yer brother-in-law, and Frank Downer,
the sporting lawyer, who still plays polo.
L. A. Childe, who becomes Union
Trustee Co.’s pastoral inspector for
southern and central Queensland, was
trained with the A.J.S. Bank, but, show-
ing a flair for pastoral affairs, became
manager of the Moonbria group of
stations on the Bogan. Then he went to
Bulgroo, out Boulia way, and finally set
up in business as a stock and station
agent in Brisbane. He is a whale for
figures, which he quotes as lovingly as a
Scotchman quotes Burns. He married a
Fairbairn.
Brisbane Chamber of Commerce has
presented A. M. Hertzberg with a cheque
for £1125. In the days of his prosperity
Hertzberg’s gifts to charity were endless
and unobtrusive and his personal acts of
kindness legion. That the depression
caught him badly in his old age was
due to his earlier generosity, which
whittled away his reserves. No man ever
deserved better of his State, but he pro-
bably values more than the money gift
the first life membership of the chamber
ever bestowed.
A. de R. Barclay’s mild outlook belies
the vigor with which he assails the Bol-
shie. He inherited his fighting spirit from
a parent who was an officer in the old
24th Regiment—a Maoriland pioneer.
Barclay himself was a well-known Maori-
land journalist before he came to Sydney,
joined the staff of the old “D.T.” and
eventually became editor of the “Sunday

Communism.”
Times.” The Sane Democracy League, of
which he is the secretary, was the child
of his brain, and he has built it from a
rather noisy infant into a dignified organi-
sation which spends its days unobtru-
sively instructing some thousands of em-
ployees in N. S. Wales concerns in the
horrors of Bolshevism and the rewards
of virtuous industry.
Frank Murray has been selected by the
Melbourne “Herald” and Associated
Newspapers to accompany the Diplo-
matic Mission to Japan. Murray has
been Federal and State roundsman on
both the “Guardian” and “Telegraph,”
He was at Duntroon, where he studied
Japanese, and he will be the only member
of the mission with even a smattering of
the language.
Ernest Wells, whose historical novel
“Hemp” is on the way to becoming one
of the best-sellers of the year, is an Aus-
tralian in his early thirties. He is a
native of Albert Park, Melbourne, but
has spent two-thirds of his young life in
New South Wales. It was intended that
ERNEST WELLS, one of Australia’s
younger novelists.
he should go into the R.A.N., but he
was rejected owing to defective eyesight.
Educated at Fort-street High School
under A. J. Kilgour—he went there on a
bursary —he entered the N.S.W. public
service; resigning, he studied for the
Bar. Within recent years he has devoted
himself almost exclusively to literary
work. Unlike many fellow-authors, he is
a polished speaker and a sound debater.
In the world of music he is recognised
as a competent critic.
Just-dead J. H. Watson, partner in the
Sydney furniture firm of Beard, Watson
and Co., saw and wrote a lot of history
in his time. Born 92 years ago he was
a relative of the Earls of Balcarres and
Crawford and of Lady Barnard, com-
poser of “Auld Robin Gray.” He had a
school holiday to mourn for the Iron
Duke and saw the London Plymouth
railway built and the troops leave for the
Crimea. He came to Sydney in 1864, but
his residence was interrupted by a spell in
India. He had a long period of military
service, and during the Russian scare in
the ’eighties he raised a defence contin-
gent at Hunter’s Hill. Since his retire-
ment from the forces in 1902 his hobby
was history, and he became the life and
soul of the N.S.W. Historical Society, of
which he was at one time president and
for 17 years honorary research secretary.
Adelaide’s gain will certainly be Syd-
ney’s loss when G. V. Portus treks over
the border to become Professor of Poli-
tical Science and History in succession to
Hancock. After taking his B.A. with
first-class honors at Sydney in 1906, he
went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar ;
at New College he became a B.Litt. and
an M.A.; he was for two years rector of
Cessnock (N.S.W.). He travelled to Adel-
aide to become Acting-Professor of His-
tory and English in 1914, but was almost
immediately appointed to the Censorship
staff. Since the war he has been in charge
of tutorial classes and lecturer in eco-
nomic history at Sydney University. He
has written a dozen books, which range
from theses on Communism and Chris-
tianity to part of the Australian section
of the Cambridge History of the British
Empire. Somehow, in between 24 hours
work a day, he finds a cranny into which
he can pack his duties as a cricket and
Rugby football coach and as an Austra-
lian Rugby selector. And when time
hangs heavy on his hands he writes an
article for the press. In his undergraduate
days Portus was a great rowing man and
Rugby player —got his football blue at
both his universities and shares with
Bulletin artist Ted Scorfield the honor
of having played for England in inter-
national matches.
Doumergue, the new Premier of
France, is a strange product of the fiery
South. He comes from the old Roman
district of Gard, of which Nimes is the
centre, and many an Australian tourist
travelling to deserted old Aigues-Mortes
has passed his birthplace. He looks more
like a sturdy North of England manu-
facturer than the typical Frenchman, but
years as a colonial magistrate and
nearly four decades in political offices
have given him poise and urbanity.
Besides being President for an unusually
lengthy period, he has managed in his
time every important Ministry, but he
has never had a more difficult task on his
hands than the curbing of the new
national which looks** like a
museum of all shades of French political
opinion.
Dr. Allan George Barnard Fisher, re-
cently appointed an economic adviser to
the Bank of N. S. Wales, in succession to
Professor T. Hytten, of Tasmania, hails
from Maoriland, where he was Prof, of
Economics at Otago. Christchurch was
his birthplace—in 1895 —but he went to
Scotch College, Melbourne, and Mel-
bourne University for his education,
where he graduated B.A. with first-class
honors. He went abroad for further
study at the London School of Econo-
mics, and while in that city graduated
Doctor of Philosophy. For a while he
was lecturer and tutor in psychology at

University, appointed an economic adviser

the call to Otago came nine years ago.
Dr. Fisher has played an active part in
the affairs of the W.E.A. and the League
of Nations Union. His published works
include “Some Problems of Wages and
Their Regulations in Great Britain Since
1918” and “Moscow Impressions.”
Justice Herbert Angas Parsons cer-
tainly had his roots firmly implanted in
South Australian history. He is a great-
great-grandson of George Fife Angas, of

Justice HERBERT ANGAS PARSONS,
of the South Australian Bench.
one time was rated as the finest collec-
tion of the famous old Bates Duchess
blood on the globe. The Judge’s father
was a Minister of the Crown and an
early Administrator of the Northern Terri-
tory. The son is a Prince Alfred College
old boy, sat in the local House of
Assembly for nine years, was Attorney-
General and Minister for Education for
a time and went on the Bench in 1921.
He takes a great interest in university
affairs, is Warden of the Senate and is
one of the few Australians to hold a
Japanese decoration. His two sons will
have a lot of ink in their veins—their
mother is a daughter of Langdon
Bonython.
C. E. Deshon retires from the Queens-
land Civil Service, which he joined as an
engineer 52 years ago. He began with the
railways and helped to survey and build
a number of important lines. After 1894
water was his main pidgin, and he car-
ried out the flood surveys of Brisbane,
fixed the dam sites of the capital area
and installed the supply systems of
Cairns, Herberton and other towns. For
a little while he was in private practice,
but Wullie Kidston brought him back to
the fold to take charge of the Public
Estate Improvement Branch, and he later
became the State’s first Irrigation Com-
missioner. His family has had a leaning
toward the land and he will join it in the
St. George district, where his knowledge
should prove an influence in south-
western Queensland development.
A. H. O’Kelly, who has been appointed
to the important police magistracy of
Rockhampton, is a confirmed Northerner.
He has been Clerk of Petty Sessions in
several centres; P.M. at Cooktown
at Innisfail, where a magistrate needs all
his tact in view of foreign complications,
and then at Cairns, where he has sat for
seven years. O’Kelly was the magistrate
selected by the Bruce Administration to
inquire into the shooting of blacks by
police in Centralia, where he spent four
months, mostly on trek, before he made
his report. He is also one of the few
P.Ms. in Queensland who have had com-
mercial experience. For a period he was
out of the service with Allen and Co. at
Charters Towers and with Quinlan Grays
in Brisbane.

The story of a 50-year-old firm which has developed into the
largest organisation of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere
Fifty years ago, before the crack of whip and the beat
of hoofs gave way to the toot of horns and the purr
of powerful cars, Holden’s Wholesale Leather and
Saddlery business was started at Adelaide. In 19 Wj
when the firm was then engaged in making horse-
drawn coaches, the first motor car body was built at the
request of a conference of motor distributors in Sydney.
In that first year of production, 100 bodies were
built. In recent years production has swelled to over
45,000 bodies for one year.
Holden’s always has been, and is today, an entirely
British Company from the Board of Directors down ;
the enormous body building plant uses only Australian
material; it provides employment for thousands of
Australians directly and in allied industries; and all its
profits are distributed entirely to Britishers most of
whom are Australians.
To possess the largest motor body building organ-
isation in the Southern Hemisphere is an achievement
in the development of secondary industry of which
Australians might be justly proud . . .
Subsidiary Activities:
In addition to the manufacture of motor car bodies,
Holden’s Woodville plant fabricates many spare parts
and motor fittings as well as Holdex Filing Cabinets
and modern Posture Chairs.
At Woodville, Melbourne, Sydney and
Brisbane, there is a Holden Repair and
Service Branch, each of which is com-
pletely equipped to render any motor
car service for any make of car.
asdf
At a Management Meeting
of all General Motors Over-
seas Operators held last
year in Europe, it was de-
cided that Holden’s would
be the official plant for all
open bodies for the entire
export production of Chev-
rolet Pontiac, Buick, Olds-
mobile and Yauxhall Cars.
These facts show how the
importance and compet-
ence of Holden manufactur-
ing are appreciated abroad.
And in Australia, every
good Austral ianshouldshow
interest in the development
of secondary industries, par-
ticularly those that have
earned a name for quality in
other parts of the world.
In this direction Holden’s
have won a proud reputa-
tion. Their meticulous care
and soundorganisationhave
engendered a world of sig-
nificant meaning into the
phrase—“ Body by Holden.”
Holden’s Body Building Plant at Woodville, South
Australia, covers an area of 40 acres, giving over
1,000,000 square feet of factory floor space. In normal
times over 3,000 men and women are employed; but this
figure has reached as high as 5,500 in the peak periods.
The plant has over 20 departments. These include
the Designing and Drawing Office, Pattern and Die
Making Department, Press Shop, Panel Fabricating
Department, Upholstery Fabrication Department,
Assembly Line, on which Framing, Panelling, Up-
holstering and Painting are carried out, Spare Parts
Manufacturing, Timber Mill with modern Season-
ing Kilns, etc.
Every Holden body passes through each of these
departments under the constant care of highly skilled
operators. Every Holden body is carefully designed
and built to conform in every detail to even the most
exacting of specifications. Holden coachwork carries
the stamp of quality, and is guaranteed to be correct
in material and measurement, for it must pass no less
than 1,213 progress inspections before it is finally
ok’d for delivery.
To progressive Australian motor car distributors
“Body by Holden’’ is regarded as the finest com-
plement to accompany a good chassis. A
“Body by Holden” is on the latest
models of Austin 10, Buick, Chevrolet,
Standard, Plymouth, Oldsmobile, Yaux-
hall Senior, Vauxhall Light Six, Willys
“77,” and Pontiac, as well as on
many of the most popular trucks.

When this drapery concern (it was
founded by O. Gilpin in 1895) was taken
oyer by the present co. in 1922 there
were 50 stores in the chain; now there
are 93, scattered throughout Vic., S. Aus.,
N. S. Wales and Queensland. The public
became interested in 1926, when
£lOO,OOO of 7 p.c. pref. money was
gathered to lighten the debt and facili-
tate a policy of property purchase.
Amongst other things, the aim was to
anchor the co.’s expanding goodwill,
though the more money it put into bricks
and mortar the more difficult it became
to maintain the old rate of net earnings.
Nevertheless, juicy returns were won
until slump, unemployment and falling
prices lightened turnover, narrowed
profit margins and caused trouble with
stocks; and the weight of the debt
pressed heavily upon the attenuated earn-
ings, of course. Thus the ords., which
got 20 p.c. in 1926, were passed by in
1931. Still, there was always enough to
give the prefs. their £7OOO, and substan-
tial savings followed interest and rent
reductions, wage cuts and an overhaul
of the organisation.
When the tide turned last year there
was thus a marked improvement in the
trading result. While gross earnings,
which fell from £274,562 in ’2B to
£180,292 in ’32, sprang £81,165, exes.
(£162,235) were pulled back £4575. After
meeting pref. requirements, which were
over five and a half times covered, there
was enough to show 5.9 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 1.1, 0.8, 6.1, 5.7, 27.1,
20.1 and 22.8 p.c. back to 1926. The div.
was lifted from 2\ p.c. to a liberal 6 p.c.
The co. has gone substantially into debt
to finance its new building programme
and the purchase of freeholds:

Over the last five years £375,596 net has
been added to the book value of free-
holds. As money became available from
liquidation of stocks, etc., it has been
used to reduce mortgages. The most
encouraging movement last year was the
expansion of £49,635 in the stocks item ;
it was accompanied by a growth of
£16,835 in the amount coming to trade
creditors, and of £6519 in the overdraft.
The more or less liquid surplus (£139,561,
including stocks) improved £13,052 over
the twelvemonth, but was £219,189
lighter than in 1928.
Shareholders are now asked to convert
200,000 of the 355,650 unissued ords. into
B prefs., carrying a cumulative 6 p.c.,
and ranking for capital and divs. next
after the existing 7 per cents., which are
to be labelled A shares. Also, the prefs.
are to be given a vote, with the right to
a majority on the board should their
divs. at any time fall three years into
arrears, and their capital is not to be
returned without the consent of three-
fourths of the holders thereof. No hint
is given as to when any or all of the new
shares are likely to be issued, or upon
what terms.
At 275. the 7 per cents, return 5.1

The cheapening of money and keen com-
petition for sound securities with a more
or less assured return sent the price of
this co.’s pound shares from 235. 9d. to
265. 3d. in the market over the last 12
months. At 265. 3d. (the price was never
higher) the return is 4.5 p.c. on the statu-
tory 6 p.c. div. basis.
The div. was reduced from 8 p.c. to
6 p.c. by the N. S. Wales Gas and Elec-
tricity Act of 1932, which placed the in-
dustry under control of a commission—
one member representing the Government,
one the cos. and the other the employees.
The standard price of gas to the con-
sumer, which used to be determined by
a Supreme Court Judge, is now fixed by
the commission at a figure which will
allow the cos. to distribute 6 p.c., after
paying exes., including interest on loan
funds, and setting aside not more than
3 p.c. p.c. under the old Act) of the
capital outlay on buildings and plant for
special purposes and depreciation.
Despite a growth of 15.5 p.c. in last
year’s gas sales (818.63 million c.f.),
returns therefrom were £4879 lighter, due
to a cut in the selling price (now ss. Bd.)
of 3d. per thousand in Sept., 1932, fol-
lowed by another 2d. in Nov. last. Resi-
duals, etc., turned in an extra £1214, re-
ducing the shrinkage in gross revenue
(£288,514) to £3665: *

Other charges 48,973 1/2} 44,494 1/1
The saving in manufacturing, distribut-
ing and other charges was £14,812, thanks
largely to reductions in the price of coal
and the N. S. Wales basic wage. Thus
the board was able to double the pre-
vious year’s allowance for special pur-
poses and depreciation, making it
£22,000, or about two-thirds of the statu-
tory limit, and show £4BB more profit
than the div. called for. During the year
£30,883 (about the same as in the pre-
vious term) was spent out of revenue on
repairs and maintenance, and £26,412 (up
£19,457) was spent on replacements and
renewals and charged against the special
purposes fund, etc., reducing it to
£60,336.
When the books closed, the share capi-
tal (£740,675) and reserves (£128,407)
were supplemented by £310,000 of 4£ p.c.
debentures and £104,122 coming to sun-
dry creditors. Fixed assets figured at
£1,237,949, and more or less liquids at
£45,255.

Though the profit claimed was £2965
better than the previous year’s—the spring
appears to be due to the reduction in the
N. S. Wales basic wage—it was only 2.4
p.c. on capital as against 1.4, 2.8 and 5.4
p.c. for the three preceding terms ; and
the div. was kept at 2\ p.c. Precisely
what the future holds for shareholders
it is difficult to say. Since the beginning
of this century their richest period was
the 10 years to the close of accounts in
1920, when divs. averaged 10| p.c.; for
the last 13 years the average was 5.4 p.c.
The business kept on expanding, but
owing to price-cutting and mounting
costs the co. (it is Sydney’s oldest and
largest milk distributor, and does a bread,
butter, ice-cream and cold storage busi-
ness as well) got no benefit from the
bigger trading.
Now that the price of milk is con-
trolled by legislation (the Milk Board
allows its agents, including this co., a mar-
gin of 4d. a gallon), further improvement
in earnings will depend largely upon the
extent, if any, to which overhead can be
further reduced, and upon performances
in the other sections of the business. Also,
a lot depends upon the condition of the
plant and rolling stock, and upon whether
the allowance for depreciation, etc.,
proves to be adequate. All that can be
said definitely in this respect is that last
year the book value of plant increased
by £1717, and rolling stock by £209.

To clip £15,358 off the debt, cash, etc.,

balances were reduced by £6754 last year.
When the books closed, liabilities exceeded
more or less liquids by £29,644, or £1479
more than at the previous balance. The
7 p.c. debentures, secured by a first mort-
gage over the freehold, mature at the
end of September next; so the co. may
be able to get a little relief in interest
from that quarter.

The co. may have done a bit better than
the accounts claimed last year, but condi-
tions were very mixed. Good rains fell
during the last quarter ; but the preced-
ing nine months, which included the
shearing period, were so dry that 22,317
sheep had to be written off for mortality.
Also, though more jumbucks were shorn,
the clip was lighter; yet it was worth an
extra £18,555, the average per bale being
£7 7s. lid. better:

Also 48,007 sheep were sold, and any
profit there may have been therefrom
was sent direct to inner reserves. So
gross earnings from all sources (£74,661)
were only £12,689 better. Exes. (£74,425)
sprang £16,355, due to £8247 openly
struck off the book value of livestock, and
a growth of £12,066 in the tax bill,
£12,598 —including unemployment relief,
the Queensland Government took no less
than 7s: 3d. in the £ of the co.’s profits
in that State. Thus the net result was
£3666 lighter at £236, leaving the p. and
1. debit at £105,491.
Dividend prospects have been pushed
into the background by the deficit and
the size of the overdraft, which, thanks
to last year’s sales and allowance for de-
preciation, etc., was lowered by £41,178,
leaving it at £83,976. Here is the position

It used to be the Sydney and Suburban
Hydraulic Power Co., whose outlook was
without promise until it began to supply
and instal electric lifts in 1925, when the
name was changed to the present title,
Hydraulic Power, Electric and Hydraulic
Lifts, Ltd. Then, just when it began to
look like an 8 p.c. proposition, slump
brought a sudden stoppage of lift instal-
lations. But maintenance and repair work
kept the pot boiling, and 3 p.c. was dis-
tributed in 1930.
There has since been a steady improve-
ment in net earnings, due chiefly to cur-
tailment of exes.:

Last year gross earnings fell away £2719.
But exes., including provision for taxa-
tion (£800), were pulled back £3246, leav-
ing the net result £527 better at 6.2 p.c.
on capital as against 5.7, 5.2, 4.3, 5.9, 8.6
and 9.7 p.c. back to 1927. So another
point was added to the div., making it
6 p.c.
Prospects have been enhanced by the
revival in building and business gener-
ally, and by purchase (price not men-
tioned, but apparently moderate) of the
goodwill of the lift business formerly car-
ried on by Major, Stevens and Coates.
Thus the co., which has also become sole
agent throughout the Commonwealth for
the Express Lift Co., London, is now in a
position to instal all the latest types of
high-speed electric lifts and moving stair-
ways. Much depends upon the exten-
sion of this agency, and upon the pur-
chase already referred to.
A large part of the capital is still in-
vested in hydraulic mains, etc.:

OBJECTS
1. The objects of the Company are to
acquire the sole rights for the manufac-
ture and/or sale for Australia and Tas-
mania of paper containers and milk pro-
ducts known as Sealcones, and the Letters
Patent in connection therewith more
particularly described in the option re-
ferred to in the Vendor’s Agreement
hereinafter mentioned.
2. Thereafter purchase, erect, maintain, sell,
license, lease, hire, with or without
royalties, and generally deal with such
containers and/or machinery used in the
manufacture thereof and generally to do
all such other things as are incidental or
conducive to the Company’s objects
which are permitted or allowed by the
Memorandum and Articles of Association
of the Company.
PATENT RIGHTS.
The Patent Rights which the Company is
purchasing are for the Commonwealth and
are covered by ten (10) patents, specifica-
tions of which may be seen at the office of
the Company. Very favorable terms have
been arranged for the purchase of these
Patents by equal instalments extending over
years, as provided in the option secured
by the Vendors in the following terms:
EXPENDITURE.
Purchase of Rights .. £15,000 0 0 (Stg.).
To be paid by 8 instalments
of £1,875 (Stg.).
Two instalments (sterling) .. £3,750 0 0
Exchange 25| per cent 956 5 0
Flotation expenses (say) .... 3,100 0 0
Working expenses, 1 year (say) 1,500 0 0
Machinery 8,500 0 0
£17,806 5 0
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.
It is not anticipated that the Company
will be called upon to expend any money
other than the flotation expenses and in-
stalments on account of the option, the
first being £1875, until such time as it is
necessary to instal a unit of machinery.
Such installation will be the beginning of
operations, and, as it is expected that a
royalty will be paid on the operation of
this unit, revenue will be received by the
Company. Thus it will be seen that ample
funds are at the disposal of the Directors
for the purchase of the option and erection
of machinery.
DESCRIPTION.
The “Sealcone” milk container can briefly
be described as a cardboard carton, treated
in such a way as to eliminate the possi-
bility of wastage through leaking, and de-
signed to minimise all unnecessary handling.
By overcoming these disadvantages, the
consumers of milk are guaranteed a
thoroughly pure and clean supply, and, in
addition, are guarded against losses from
short measure and infection from the con-
tact of the milk with harmful bacteria.
The shape of the container is conical, and
its construction has been designed to
facilitate packing and transportation. In
addition to this advantage, a comparison
with the present milk bottle reveals that it
is far superior on the question of weight,
the weight of a “Sealcone” empty being loz.
and that of a glass bottle being lib. This
fact alone should facilitate speedy delivery.
The filling capacity of each unit of
machinery is 2400 .pint cartons per hour.
The milk container now being put before
the public is not an innovation, but has
been tried and proved in England and
America, where its success has led to a
substantial increase in the turnover of the
companies by whom it is used. This suc-
cess has also led to its extension to Euro-
pean countries and to the sale of the rights
to France, Holland, Spain and Italy.
POSSIBILITIES IN AUSTRALIA.
The proposals of the present Directors
are not to enter into direct competition with
present suppliers, but to take advantage of
their rights over the machines in Aus-
tralia and to instal the necessary units at
the distributing depots. The companies
will be given the option of paying for these
machines on a time-payment basis, or by
one immediate cash payment. This Com-
pany’s revenue will, amongst other things,
arise from royalties estimated to be a frac-
tion of one penny per gallon based on the
output of the machines.
Even on the present consumption of
Sydney alone, the immense possibilities
must be realised, but when it is considered
that the average consumption in the other
capital cities of the Commonwealth is in
the vicinity of 10,000,000 gallons per annum,
the enormous potentialities of the Com-
pany’s rights over the machine throughout
Australia cannot be over-estimated.
The Directors realise that, before the
Company can meet with the success ex-
pected, arrangements must be made with
the distributing concerns for the installa-
tion of the machinery to automatically
handle the milk. This depends largely
upon the future policy of the Milk Board.
Negotiations have already been instituted
and are proceeding satisfactorily in Sydney
and another capital city in the Common-
wealth for the installation.
STOCK EXCHANGE.
It is intended to make application to have
the Company’s shares listed on the Stock
Exchanges throughout Australia, and this
prospectus has been drawn up in accord-
ance with the requirements. The Company
will pay brokerage on all shares applied for
and allotted whose applications are identi-
fied as coming through Members of the
Stock Exchange or other Agent or Broker
duly approved by the Directors.
ALLOTMENT.
The Directors may proceed to allotment
when 40,000 shares have been applied for.
Directors reserve the right to close the list
when they deem sufficient money is in hand.
Unallotted shares will be ottered to the
existing shareholders on a pro rata basis.

The liquidators, who took control in
Sept., 1931, continue to do good work.
Without sacrificing securities they have
since got in £1,130,759, and distributed
£1,016,872 of it—£212,257 to secured and
preferential creditors and the balance to
ordinary creditors, chiefly depositors, who
have received 13s. 9d. in the £ on claims
for which they were entitled to rank in
the liquidation. A further Is. 3d. in
the £, making 15s. in all, is to be distri-
buted before the end of this month, and,
barring accidents, the other ss. is assured.
Last year’s receipts totalled £273,518, and
there was £54,121 in the till at the begin-
ning of the. term, making £327,639 avail-
able, of which £269,135 was distributed to
creditors. Including £Blll paid on behalf
Of customers, chiefly to protect the co.’s
securities, exes, were £31,726 lighter at
£39,687. The liquidators thus started
their third year with a cash balance of
£18,817. Incidentally, the loss on tne
sale of the co.’s Pitt-street, Sydney, pre-
mises (they fetched £44,131) was £35,044.
The position at the date of liquidation,
and at the end of each succeeding 12

At the end of Sept, the book value of
the apparent surplus (£319,882, down
£46,250 over the twelvemonth) was equal
to approximately 14s. 6d. per pound of
pref. capital. But the outstanding ad-
vances, etc., are those which will be most
difficult to collect, and the Brisbane pre-
mises, which failed to fetch a satisfactory
bid at auction, may prove to be worth
less than their book value. Of the £78,594
of reserves, £52,794 has already been swal-
lowed by bad debts and the loss on the
Sydney premises, leaving £25,800 to offset
any further losses on £712,336 of old
advances, etc.
At the moment it is not possible to say
exactly how much shareholders will
rescue from the wreck, or when the wind-
ing-up is likely to be complete. Paid
capital is £439,402, of which £439,380 is
so-called preference capital and £22 ordi-
nary. In addition shareholders put up
£1 of premium money with each pound
of paid capital.
Sealcones (Aust.), Ltd.
This is a Sydney float with a nominal
capital of £60,000 in 10s. shares, of which
100,000 are offered, 2s. on application,
a like amount on allotment and the
balance as required. The vendor (H. G.
Napthali) takes 20,000 paids, but no
cash, for his option (bought for £150) to
purchase (for £15,000 sterling) from Seal-
cone, Ltd., London, the sole patent rights
throughout the Commonwealth for the
production, etc., of special paper con-
tainers for milk. These containers, made
of waxed paper, are manufactured,
filled with an exact measure of milk
and hermetically sealed by machinery all
in one continuous operation. By thus
reducing the risk of contamination, this
sealcone method is claimed to be superior
hygienically to any existing method of
distribution. Tests made in London show
that the milk is in no way affected by
the container, which is lighter and costs
less in freight and handling charges than
glass bottles.
The intention is to sell sealcone plants
to milk distributors here, the co. deriving
its revenue chiefly from royalties, esti-
mated at “a fraction of a penny per
gallon” on output. Each unit of plant
can turn out 2400 pint cartons per
hour. That the co. has possibilities is
plain from the fact that the annual house-
hold consumption of milk in the Sydney
metropolitan area alone is approximately
18,000,000 gallons. Everything, however,
will depend upon the number of
machines it can sell, and that in turn will
be governed chiefly by how the public
likes the new container, and what savings
there may be to the distributing cos.
If negotiations now in progress are suc-
cessful, it is hoped to instal the first
machine in Sydney about the middle of
this year.
The board may go to allotment when
40,000 shares have been applied for, and
it is intended to list the scrip. On the
board are W. R. Carpenter, Dr. H. R. R.
Grieve, S. H. Solomon and H. G. Nap-
thali. Two others are to be appointed.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.
Not only did gold producers in the
British Empire—they are responsible for
about three-quarters of the world’s
annual output of the metal —do well out
of depreciated paper last year, but South
American mineowners similarly benefited
in varying degrees, and for the greater
part of the year goldmines in the U.S.A.
showed rapidly increasing revenues in
the now undervalued dollar, which has
become something of an international
nuisance. Even in Korea two well-known
gold producers gained substantially from
the higher prices which they obtained for
their output in paper yen.

Mt. Morgan has decided to quicken its
activities while the going is good. With
gold at its present price, a large tonnage
of overburden. and other low-grade stuff
is now profitable. The new programme Is
designed to increase ore output to at least
5000 tons weekly. It includes develop-
ment of the opencut, from which over-
burden is to be removed at the rate of
8000 tons a week, reconditioning of the
powerhouse, and the addition of further
units to the mill and concentrator. All
this will mean a fairly large expenditure
over the next 18 months or so. Still,
increased output and lower costs should
make more money available, so share-
holders may not be asked to put up
much, if anything. A welfare scheme
for the benefit of employees is also part
of the new programme; a sum equalling
71 p.c. of dividends paid to shareholders
is to be set aside. Of this, 60 p.c. is to be
distributed in cash bonuses, and 40 p.c.
will be administered by a committee of
mine executives and' employees.

“Bonagai”: More than one effort has
been made of recent years to work the
old gold deposits on Woodlark Island
(Papua), but none met with success. Thus
far, the mines there have never carried
anything better than occasional rich
shoots, and the ground generally has been
torn to pieces by recurrent earthquakes.
In many of the drives on the old Kula-
madau, coral was found in the allegedly
gold-carrying lodes. Also, the island has
a very heavy rainfall, and water trouble
was another reason for the abandon-
ment of several shows in the long ago,
when adequate machinery and satisfac-
tory transport were practically non-
existent. There may be good gold some-
where in Woodlark, but it has not yet
made its appearance, after 40 years or
so of thorough searching. Misima, where
reef gold is now being won again, offered
no difficulties of the kind just referred to.
A reefing proposition was successfully
worked there in the days of Sir William
MacGregor.

New Territory (New Guinea), a Mel-
bourne float with a nominal capital of
£5OOO in £5 shares, has sent two experi-
enced prospectors to overhaul “promising
areas” in New Guinea. The ground is
said to be ideal for bucket dredging, but
no hint is given as to the locality. Of
the shares, the vendor takes 100 paids,
Australian Gold Development has sub-
scribed for 200, and the public has
snapped the rest. The directors include
General A. E. Wisdom, for some years
Administrator of New Guinea.

Oil Search, Ltd., will complete its
second geological survey of Mandated
New Guinea in April, after two years’
continuous work. One closed structure
has been recommended for a deep test.
The location of the first hole will be
determined on the return to Australia
of geologist Stanley, who has been in
charge. Arrangements have been made
to open up two routes between the Sepik
and the coast, and a Government official
will accompany the party to supervise
transport and furnish police protection.

Cracow interests have taken up the old
Enterprise, at Gympie (Q.), and a deal
has been made with Cracow Eagle
Options to work the show with a view
to ultimate flotation. The formation can
be traced for 1000 ft. on the surface, and
grab samples assay from lldwt. to 16dwt.
The water in the main shaft is to be
pumped out immediately, and the Gov-
ernment may be asked to assist in a
diamond-drilling campaign.

About 8500 acres of alluvial tin-bearing
country, between Mt. Cameron and Boo-
byalla (Tas.), has been taken up by the
Delta Co. W. G. Fraser reports
that the river basins on the eastern half
of the properties would be capable of
keeping six large dredges fully occupied
for the next 10 or 12 years—provided
average tin content and price are right.
The area, he says, shows enough attrac-
tive features to warrant close investi-

Westralia’s contribution to the Com-
monwealth’s gold production for 1933
was 637,207 fine oz., worth approximately
£2,706,683 at the old statutory price.
Exchange increased the value of the yield
in Australian currency to £4,878,188.
Kalgoorlie, assisted by Wiluna and
Gwalia, furnished the bulk of the output.
Old gold, including coins, watches,
chains, bangles, etc., purchased by the
Perth mint during the year was worth
£45,539.
* * * *
Now that the riots are ended, Kal-
goorlie and Boulder are counting the
cost. The loss in bricks, mortar, wood,
iron, etc., is roughly estimated at
£lOO,OOO. Eighty buildings, including
three hotels, four clubs and several cafes
and wineshops, were either gutted by fire
or almost totally wrecked. Over 50
houses were burnt at Boulder, and their
contents were either thus destroyed or
looted. The loss to mine workers in
wages is estimated at £lB,OOO, and the
amount sliced off the profits of mine-
owners at £13,000.

After doing nothing for some years the
Lanarkshire Co. has taken an option over
the Lady Gladys East, which adjoins
the Lady Gladys at Mulline (W.A.). The
co. is one of the many ventures formed
at the beginning of the Hampton Plains
boom in 1920. . It has taken and aban-
doned several options since, but want
of sufficient cash prevented anything
large being acquired. Prospects of the
latest option depend upon how some of
the leaders, struck in shallow ground,
will shape at depth. Some hope that a
rich patch like that recently met with in
the Lady Gladys will be exposed.
Ora Banda and Princess Royal have
amalgamated, and are forming a new co.
to take over their interests at Grant’s
Patch, near Ora Banda (W.A.). These
interests consist of about 80 acres of
gold-mining country, including McKen-
zie’s Salvation lease, Ora Banda Mines
and Ora Banda Consols. About £16,000
worth of bullion has been extracted from
the Salvation lease in the last 18 months,
and prospects for all the shows men-
tioned look attractive.

A geophysical survey of the Granite
Development Co.’s 300 acres at North
Wiluna commenced on Jan. 20. The
work is expected to be finished in about
six weeks. It is in the hands of Sepp
Horvath, the Swedish expert, who has
had successes at the Wiluna mine, the
Triton, at Reedy’s, and in America and
Sweden.
* * * *
Western Mining Corp., which has an
option over the Phoenix, Norseman
(W.A.), has applied for four additional
leases in this area. Also, an aerial sur-
vey of the co.’s 500-acre reservation at
Coolgardie has been completed, and
results are pronounced encouraging.

Banda South (capital £22,500) is a Syd-
ney float to resurrect the old Orinda, at
Ora Banda (W.A.). In the past about
3000 tons was treated for 24000 z. of
gold ; the property has been opened up
to 40ft., and ore-bodies are said to range
from 6ft. to 16ft. in width. There will
be no allotment until the full issue
(80,000 shares) is applied for.

C. M. Harris has recommended Enter-
prise Gold, of Adelaide, to drop its option
over the Callion, at Davyhurst (W.A.).
The Callion has prospects, but evidently
they are not considered good enough.

Westralia’s export of arsenic—a by-
product at Wiluna—continues to soar.
The 1933 figure (£36,753) was £lO,OOO
higher than that for 1932, and repre-
sented nearly one half of the value of all
mineral shipments other than gold. Apart
from bunker coal, other mineral exports,
such as tin, copper and lead, which were
once shipped in fairly large quantities, are
now insignificant.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
8.P.: If safety of capital is important, keep
out F.D.: Metropolitan Gas (Melb.) deben-
tures, City Electric (Brisbane) prefs. and Adel-
aide Electric prefs. all return between 4 p.c.
and 5 p.c.; subject to political developments,
or a rise in the rate of interest generally, the
market for these securities seems likely to re-
main fairly firm H.C.C.: (1) Sell the first, but
hold the other two. (2) Berlei ords., Standard
Cement, Mark Foys, Beard Watson, Wunder-
lich and Walkerville Brewing are worth
consideration. Doubtful whether early rise in
Aus, Drug, Richardson and Wrench and Sar-
gents need be looked for... .P.D.8.: Better
leave it alone... .D.G.: Know nothing of it;
making inquiries... .D.JJ.: United Provisions,
though Walkerville Co-op. Brewing and Berlei
offer good prospects... .8.5.: Lancefieldfor pre-
ference, though recent developments have greatly
enhanced Paringa’s prospects.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“Night of the Garter,” at the Mayfair
(seen on Australian stages as “Getting
Gertie’s Garter”), has all the features of
the traditional Elstree laugh-chaser. Wini-
fred Shotter finds herself burdened, on
the day of her wedding to a jealous
young man, with a garter, the present of
another young man whose photograph is
on it. She spends her wedding night
trying vainly to get rid of the thing.
In these productions the performers
gallop about in pairs, and only come
together in the neighborhood of the
fade-out. Miss Shotter’s partner is
Connie Ediss (maid). Her revolver-
wielding husband is mostly accompanied
by Sydney Howard, a beguiling butler-
blackmailer. The jealous wife of the
garter-giver yanks the henpecked hus-
band of another lady out of his bed-
room, where he is convalescing from a
bad cold, and into a car. And so to the
scene of action, where the two rush
hither and thither in a movie storm, and
hide in barrels, hay-lofts, etc., till the
inevitable time comes for the lady to
take off all her clothes and appear in a
rug.
Believe it or not, this venerable rub-
bish was received with howls of approval
by a packed house on the first night.
Sydney Howard is comic as usual. He
teeters about like a stout, nervous old
woman, distracted by the goings-on of
his superiors, startled by the repeated
door-bangings, mystified by the conduct
of an egg which reappears every time
he throws it into a barrel in which, un-
beknownst to him, one of the fugitives
is lurking. Through it all he remains
as melancholy as a sexton, as graceful
as a ballerina. The difference between
him and the others is that his comedy
has character, and theirs hasn’t. The
young men are particular unfunny in
themselves and forced in their methods.
There is a lugubrious story about a
starving composer running through “Say
It with Music,” but Jack Payne and his
band are all that matter. Mr. Payne is
England’s answer to the jazz-croon
specialists of the U.S.A., and he and his
colleagues are certainly no more dread-
ful than their overseas rivals, white or
colored. They perform the same acro-
batic feats, produce the same unearthly
rows, and in most cases favor the same
composers. The name of the film derives
from Irving Berlin’s well-known song.
* v- *
“The Story of Temple Drake,” at the
Regent, is based on a pornographic best-
seller which gave a lurid picture of a
female rake’s progress in the U.S.A. The
principal character in the novel was
Trigger, a sadistic proprietor of houses of
ill-fame ; in the film Trigger is a con-
ventional villain who, after a certain
amount of glowering and revolver-finger-
ing, commits a pointless murder and is
murdered himself. Jack La Rue plays
this futile part. Miriam Hopkins, as
Temple Drake, portrays a promiscuous
B.Y.T. who proves to be the right stuff
when put to the test.
There were plausible psycho-pathologi-
cal reasons in the book why Trigger and
his gang should have detained the girl,
but they couldn’t have been so much as
hinted at in a film. The sojourn of Miss
Hopkins in the sensationally dilapidated
mansion in the wood, while the rain teems
down and the thunder roars and the idiot
lad gibbers and the mother (with child)
registers woe, is largely irrelevant. The
continuity, after being held up for a while
on mystery-play lines, is resumed when
the heroine murders Trigger, and against
the wishes of her admirer William Gargan
(counsel for the defence in a murder trial)
enters the box and reveals all. Trigger
committed the murder, and she shot Trig-
ger because he wouldn’t let her end their
liaison. After which she swoons, and
Gargan gathers her up in his arms and,
while carrying her from the precincts,
remarks to her appalled grandfather “Be
proud of her, Judge. I am.”
Miss Hopkins is brilliant as a type of
neuropath who, though found in all walks
of life, is much commoner on the streets
than in drawing-rooms. She even man-
ages to look the part. Gargan’s throaty
sentimentalism is painful, and he has been
given some lines that would defeat an
actor of genius. During his examination-
in-chief he stresses the aristocratic lineage
of the heroine, and then: “You are a
Drake, but you are also a woman.” It
got the only laugh of the evening on
Saturday.
To enjoy “Take a Chance” it is only
necessary to enjoy the spectacle of James
Dunn and Cliff Edwards making asses of
themselves. They are crooks who begin
in a small way at country fairs and, after
meeting “Buddy” Rogers, a musical-
comedy producer, cavort in more expen-
sive circles. Here the film becomes a
backstager with Dunn and Edwards steal-
ing jewellery instead of notes. They steal
a diamond brooch belonging to the
heroine so often that she says wearily, at
last: “Keep it. I’ll know where it is
then.” The most hilarious item is a skit
on a celebrated American melodrama.
* * *
“Captured,” at the Capitol, is a well-
acted war melodrama of the Find-the-
Moral-if-you-Can school.
Leslie Howard is a young British
officer whose bride was seduced by an
American (D. Fairbanks, jun.) a few days
after he left for foreign parts. He and
Fairbanks meet in a German prison-
camp. Camp life is brightened by a Ger-
man commandant (Paul Lukas) who, be-
cause he was at Oxford with the princi-
pals, gives them certain privileges. A
shell-shocked British prisoner murders a
German girl in lamentable circumstances
just as Fairbanks escapes because he can’t
bear to see Leslie grieving about the non-
arrival of letters from his missus. Fair-
banks is accused of the crime. As he is
about to be shot, Howard goes berserk,
shoots the guards, grabs a machine-gun
and keeps the German army at bay while
the captives swarm aboard ’planes and
escape. Howard is shown beautiful in
death (having been bombed) while Fair-
banks zooms for home and the slightly-
tarnished heroine.
FACES FROM SYDNEY FLICKERS.
(1) James Dunn, in “Take a Chance” at the Regent; (2) Joan Crawford, in
“Dancing Lady,” at the St. James; ( 3 ) Sydney Howard, in “Night of the
Garter,” at the Mayfair.
In “Mr. Skitch” Will Rogers is a resi-
dent of Missouri who has been ruined
by a dishonest banker. The sheriff who
distrained on his goods and chattels over-
looked his car, so he and his wife (Zasu
Pitts) are able to proceed to California,
via Yellowstone Park. Grizzly bears eat
their food, a would-be movie actress
(Florence Desmond) borrows their petrol,
and if a wealthy West Point cadet (Har-
vey Denby) hadn’t met their daughter
(Rochelle Hudson) they would have been
sunk without a trace.
A feature of the work is the rugged
100-per-cent. American individualism of
Will Rogers, who says that since the
bankers are on one side and the people
are on the other he will take illegal steps
to retrieve his fortunes. It doesn’t come
to that. After a series of ancient wise-
cracks delivered by William with tremen-
dous deliberation he is disclosed in a
condition of tumultuous prosperity, with
his country’s social problems still un-
solved.

Sundry Shows
“Listen, Lester,” which opened at Syd-
ney Cri. on Saturday night, is of Ameri-
can origin. Its plot depends on the
thesis that if a young and pretty girl
kisses an elderly man in public nobody
on earth would suppose she was his
daughter. Its music is the feeblest of
Tin-pan Alley croonery, and the patter,
most of which is very dull, has been so
sketchily “adapted” that one character
speaks of nickels and another of pounds,
shillings and pence, and a reference to
Broken Hill rubs shoulders with talk of
N’Yark and Michigan. But Mr. Ernest
Rolls has stocked the stage with a pleni-
tude of pretty girls in striking dresses, the
second-act scenery is charming, and,
although there isn’t a voice in the co.
worth writing home about, there are
some very clever legs. The feature of the
show is the dancing of Maorilander Joan
de Beere, who is graceful and expressive
from the crown of her Joan of Arc
coiffure to the tips of her toes. A Pierrot
ballet in which she is associated with
Serge Moros and Jan Kowsky and dances
to non-jazz music—Borowski’s “Adora-
tion” is one of the themes —sparkles like
a jewel set in the head of a toad. F.a.q.
vaudeville-hoofing sketches are provided
by Jack and Sylvia Kellaway, Rene
Riano, Charles Norman, Sydney Wheeler
and Rita Pauncefort.

It was a queer show the A.B.C. put
on at Melb. Town Hall on Saturday
night. Captain Adkins’s bandsmen in
tight red coats, their brass buttons wink-
ing like heliographs ; solo pianist Henri
Penn, bursting in several places out of a
jacket of the same sanguinary hue ; basso
profundo Alan Eddy, his hair reduced
for the occasion to seemly military pro-
portions, and his workmanlike chest
adorned with a bandolier; the distin-
guished conductor himself, a soldierly
figure in a beautifully tailored blue uni-
form covered with gold braid and hung
with gold rope ; microphones standing at
attention with expectant ears ; and the
horns and the trumpets and the heavier
howitzers glittering menacingly under the
electric lights. Here, surely, are the
materials for a major offensive on the
eardrums of the universe. Instead, when
the conductor signals to the monster to
release the bowels of its wrath, comes
a soft twittering, a tender whispering, a
wistful musical smile.
True, when the captain flings in all his
reserves, he raises a respectable noise, but
at its full extension his band cannot reach
anywhere near the pomp, the majesty, the
soul-paralysing effects of a full orchestra ;
nor can it produce the wide range of con-
trasts required. It does not open door
after door on fresh horizons of sound,
stretching into infinity. The clarinets do
their best to conceal the absence on
parade of ’cellos and violins, but they
cannot, like the strings, pile octave on to
octave until one’s insides are plucked out
and one feels like a scaled and gutted fish.
No! Captain Adkins’s band is a poor
thing, despite its appearance of might,
except when it plays pieces written
especially for it—marches and waltzes
and suchlike things. It can then be jolly
and exhilarating and make one want to
stamp one’s feet. But when it attempts
Wagner, Sibelius and Grieg, it is not
Wagner, Sibelius and Grieg at all, but a
dull, monotonous compromise.
However, it was a grand popular
entertainment, and the hall was packed
and the applause was deafening, especi-
ally when the four trombones arose as
one man and flung a bomb full in the
face of the audience. Henri Penn played
the solo part of the Grieg concerto with
his usual address, but the bright clarity
of his playing only served to make the
orchestral section sound like the suc-
cessive interruptions of bands marching
past in the street. One of the most
satisfying adaptations was Dvorak’s
“Humoreske.”

Beresford Fowler, who is visiting Syd-
ney with the idea of leavening the city’s
theatrical lump with plays by the higher
order of dramatists, started off with a
double bill at St. James’s Hall. The first,
Strindberg’s variously-named essay in
abnormal psychology, billed on this occa-
sion as “Countess Julie,” did not impress.
Mr. Fowler’s interpretation of the man-
servant lacked life, and his lisp brought
laughs where they were not intended.
Myra Leard played Julie with consider-
able vigor. Shaw’s “How He Lied to Her
Husband” was much better done. Helen
Blood as Aurora Bumpus, and Harley
Granville Mullens as Apjohn, the very
youthful poet, achieved some very effec-
tive comedy. Edward Jackson, as
Aurora’s husband, was stagey.

The A.B.C.’s performance of Gounod’s
“Faust,” broadcast from Sydney one
night last week, was given in English by
an all-Australian cast. If there had been
even a little bit of devil in Walter Kings-
ley’s Mephistopheles the affair would
have been an all-round success. Molly
de Gunst as Marguerite and Cecil Sher-
wood as Faust were adequate to the duet
in the garden, in which Gounod reaches
the summit of his inspiration; Alfred
Cunningham robustly interpreted Valen-
tino (more suitable music was never
written for a baritone), and chorus and
orchestra did themselves proud under
Wando Aldrovandi’s baton. By the time
television in color arrives the A.8.C., if
it doesn’t weaken, should have an opera
organisation equal to all the requirements
of that form of entertainment.
West’s Theatre in Adelaide is swim-
ming against the tide, having closed its
doors as a picture-house “to be recon-
structed for theatrical productions.” It
was built for a Waterloo cyclorama about
1890 ; changed into an ice skating-rink ,
and then became, under J. T. West, the
first movie-house the city had known.

Melbourne Tiv. is rejoicing mightily in
the best bill it has had for months. The
worst thing The Bulletin can find to say
about Fred Miller is that he is a Cockney
humorist, and the best thing it can say
is that his Cockney humor is more than
the usual dreary gagging and touches the
fringes of Art. Ella Shields makes an
appearance as herself, and is revealed as
a handsome, upstanding woman with the
secret of perpetual youth in her reticule ;
later, she is found at the old address in
the vicinity of Bow. There is also a
gentleman, suitably clad for the time of
the year, who seizes by the ankle a lady,
also suitably arrayed, and uses her as an
Indian club while she fiddles away on a
violin without dropping a note or a stitch.
The rest of the bill is neither very good
nor very fresh, but it does good business
with the audience.
# * *
Melbourne is resounding with the
tramp of marching feet, the blare of
bugles, the thunder of artillery wheels
and the clatter of machine-gun fire, while
the sky at night is being stabbed with
wavering searchlight swords. The Exhi-
bition oval is the concentration-point for
this display of military might, which
takes the form of a week’s display of
the lethal appurtenances, gymnastic
prowess and facilities for popular enter-
tainment of the men of the Army, Navy
and R.AA.F.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Real Stud”: Dad took in the scene at
Sydney Central with the eye of the born
general. “It’s them Kalgoorlie riots,” he
said reassuringly to Mum, who was be-
ginning to think that perhaps they hadn’t
heard the last of the time when Dave
shot Fatty Phelan’s white calf, mistaking
it for a ghost. Every street-corner had its
bevy of white-hatted policemen, making
semaphore motions with both arms.
“Nuthin’ to do with us,” said Dad
valiantly. “C’mon ; we’ll make our way
to th’ pub.” Dave stepped off the pave-
ment bearing the two heaviest suitcases.
A white-gloved hand smote him in the
chest. “Get back!” said a terrible voice.
Dave dropped both suitcases and
scrambled back to the safety of the pave-
ment. “Pick those things up and look
snappy about it,” said the domineering
voice; “you’re obstructing the traffic.'’
“Me man,” said Dad grandly, “you mind
“Are you the waiter who took my order?”
“Yessir.”
“H’m, still looking well, l see. How are your grandchildren?”
your business. I’m a justice of the peace,
and if I tell my son to cross the road
your business is to shut up and let him
obey my lawful commands. Otherwise
I shall arrest you.” “You will?” asked
the terrible voice. “I will!” said Dad.
Dave picked up the suitcases and
plunged once more across the open space,
Four white-hatted cops buffeted him
back. Discretion deserted Dad. With a
bellow like an angry bull he plunged into
the fray. A dirty one on the beezer laid
him prone. Mum and Sarah rushed to the
rescue. Twelve white-hatted cops re-
pelled the attack, and when these were
assaulted in the rear by Dave, who had
moved en echelon (as it were) to uphold
his sire’s dignity, 12 more deployed from
various corners. At this moment a tre-
mendous concussion shook Australia and
the Central Railway Station tower toppled
over, slaying 857 citizens. Simultaneously
12 banks were burgled. It was discovered
later that three limousines, another
motor-car and a Ford had collided just
in front of the station. One of the five
was loaded with gelignite. The bodies
of Dad, Dave, Mum and
Sarah and of 24 cops were
supposed to be missing, but
were never identified. The
assets of the banks also went
west. By the time the rum-
pus subsided N. S. Wales had
split into five new States, the
Legislatures of which united
in passing ordinances making
it a capital offence to drive
a motor-car (or a Ford) in
the narrow streets of Sydney.
A subsequent historian states
that the great reform started
on Feb. 1, 1934, when an
unwise attempt was made to
coerce the Pedestrian party,
which exercised most of the
votes.
“McFad”: As a house-to-house sales-
man of two years’ standing—and walk-
ing—I can tell you that to most of our
fraternity the average dog. notice has as
much significance as “Welcome” on the
mat. I have met them all —“Beware of
the Dog,” “Beware of Savage Dog,” “Be-
ware of Alsatian” —but we take them all
in our stride. If a man-eating monster
exists to justify the warning it is usually
safely chained up. But, as a rule, we
discover the home protector to be either
a senile, amiable Towser or a snappy,
diminutive and detestable Fluffkins. Only
one notice has ever had me stonkered.
It reads thus: “Tradesmen and Can-
vassers —Please open this gate cautiously.
If attacked by Alsatian, do not run, but
knock on door for assistance.” Three
times have I got as far as the latch, but
always that sinister word-picture sends
me slinking back like a booted mongrel,

The Prooshan’: There’s more than
one way of getting a waggon out of a
bog. Long ago Old Bill, while haul-
ing wool from Tubbo station, was
bogged at Darlington Point just before
he could get to the punt. The waggon
stuck in the black-soil glue. Horses
couldn’t shift her. Another horse team
came along; no good. Two fine teams
of bullocks, with inch-bar chains right up
to the leaders, were hooked ahead of
both, but that army of horse- and
bullock-flesh couldn’t make the load
budge an inch. Then the waggon
was unloaded, but she was down
that far, and in that tight, that still the
“ ’Ow long will y’r ’usband he away?”
“The P.M. won’t say till t’-morra mornin’.”
combined teams couldn’t pull it. After
a while a swaggie arrived. “I’ll bet you
a quid I can get her out with a single
horse,” was his challenge to the assem-
bled teamsters. They said he was mad,
but he was welcome to have a try. Over
to the punt went the traveller and came
back with a strong rope and some block-
and-tackle gear which he rigged to a
big gum-tree. He set a snatch-block at
the bottom of the tree, hooked on a
good horse, and the waggon came clean
up out of the bog. Old hands declare
the suction noise could be heard over
at Whitton. The swaggie took his quid
with a grin, remarking that he “hadn’t
spent 30 years on the sea for nothin’.”

“Yangardook”: During the extension
of the N.T. line from Pine Creek, I was
appointed ganger over a motley crew
of a hundred men, half of them
Chinese. No matter how many deserted,
there was never a vacancy, as another
countryman was substituted. Tiring of this,
I decided to tag each man with a number.
But changes were rung during the night,
all the same, and the engineer decided to
announce a three-bob reduction in pay
for one gang of 25. There was apparent
discontent and much chattering till knock-
off time Saturday. It was noticed that
all that gang took their shovels away to
camp, and a strike was anticipated, but
on Monday morning all rolled up to
work. It was not till the following
Saturday that I detected that in a truly
tradesmanlike manner every shovel had
an inch taken off all round the blade.
Then my turn came. I got the sack.

“Walkabout”: I dunno who’s the best
Australian horseman, but our station abo.
Jacky Flourbag must get a place. Sit-
ting on the rails of the Mulga Downs
stockyard we witnessed Jacky’s exhibi-
tion. Barefooted, he was hoisted into the
saddle of an unbroken and nasty-tem-
pered prad, and the evolutions the horse
indulged in when given its head in the
yard caused the dust and sand to
fly. Observation was obscured, but the
yells from Jacky were evidence that he
was undaunted. Suddenly from out the
whirlwind of dust came the saddle, the
force of its impact against the fence
almost unseating us from the rails.
“Pelted saddle and all,” said a voice near
us, and then the dust cleared. There
was Jacky, still aboard the now subdued
outlaw, with the toes of his big bare feet
in the rings of the bridle bit!

“Raorut”: A famous figure in the early
days of Bendigo was a Cousin Jack black-
smith who possessed a wooden leg.
When starting work on a mine for the
first time he never failed to go through
a ritual which caused managers new to
him to imagine they were seeing things.
Climbing up to the poppet-head, he would
there solemnly stand on his head, with
the wooden limb describing circles in the
sky. His explanation for this extraordi-
nary behavior never varied. “Never on
top uv poppet-’ead all me life ’cept I
stan’ on me ’ead,” he would say.
* * *
“Apis”: Boundary-riding on a bee
farm has always been used by the Aus-
tralian bushman to express the flaming
limit in unpalatable jobs, real or hypo-
thetical. With modern methods, not
only boundary-riding but droving bees
has been brought within the bounds of
possibility. Recently a N.S.W. bee-king
found that feed was getting short on
his holding. He had 250 hives, and arti-
ficial feeding was such an expensive pro-
blem that he resolved to put them on
agistment. Suitable country was obtained,
and the question was then how to shift
the stock without loss from overheating,
to which bees are very susceptible. He
loaded the hives into a big louvre rail-
way van, and put a ton of iceblocks,
wrapped in bags and packed in sawdust,
round them. At the end of the trip of
over 400 miles the percentage of loss
at delivery was small. It is estimated that
11| million bees were overlanded in this
fashion. I would like to know if any of
the N.T. cattle experts can claim to beat
this record and retain a clear conscience.

“King T.”: The historic battle be-
tween the South Sea Islanders and the
Manilamen on Thursday Island was
not, intentionally, a lawless affair.
South Sea Islanders had been stabbed at
night, and a deputation from them
waited on the resident magistrate, who
was rather deaf, to ask if they might fight
their enemies. The magistrate thought
they had asked when their complaint
might be brought before him, and replied:
“Yes, yes ; at three o’clock to-morrow
afternoon.” The South Sea Islanders,
who are pretty good sports, immediately
notified their opponents, and turned up
about 100 strong at the appointed time
armed with nothing but their fists. About
60 Manilamen appeared, carrying for-
midable knives, but the South Sea fellows,
nothing daunted, attacked in force and
put their antagonists to rout. The police
arrived when the fracas was over. One
South Sea Islander was killed and sev-
eral badly wounded, but the local lads
were satisfied with the results of the
scrap, and were immensely grateful to
the magistrate.

“Kiriwina”: The Papuan ladies may
pluck their eyebrows (B. 31/3/ ’34),
though I have never spotted one doing
so. At the same time I was much in-
trigued, on my first visit to the Trobri-
ands many years ago, to find that the
very good-looking flappers of those parts
wore their eyelashes cropped almost to the
lids. Later I found that this was done,
not by the damsels themselves, but by
their best boys, who bit them off as a
sign of their affection. By a natural
sequence, a young lady of the Trobriands
who wore her lashes long was looked on
with alarm as a hater of mankind, or
with contempt as a congenital old maid,
neither being popular with the Trobriand
Bright Young Things.

“Soso”: A peculiarity of the Stanley
River, a tributary of the Brisbane River
(Q.), is the fact that iron or steel articles
dropped into it do not rust. Recently a
workman in a bridge gang dropped a
new handsaw into the water. It was not
recovered for a week, and was then as
bright as the day it left the shop.
ON A PICTURE OF KANGAROOS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What pace they make through the open timber,
With lifted tails and with doelike heads,
“Old men” and joeys, all snug in pouches,
Grey kangaroos and the tawny reds!
They have nibbled the grass when the dawn
star hung,
They have dozed at noon on the sandy flat,
Passed by the scrub where the fungi’s lantern
Shone, goblin-blue, in the mosses’ mat.
Strange phantoms these of a nursery dream,
As swift as swallow in headlong flight,
Gone down to drink in the creek’s pale
shallows,
Or feeding out on the ridge at night.
An eerie shape in the summer dawning;
A thudding fate on an autumn eve;
Shy, shadowy wraiths in the ringbarked timber,
Like something spawned of a Make-Believe.
But you bring back youth—and the bushfires
burning
Where the tall flame skirted the Horseshoe
plain,
A rake of gold where it scoured the paddock,
The sudden rescue of cool, white rain!
The musterers driving the Shorthorn cattle;
The blunt, grey sheep on the dusty track;
The homestead, down by the weeping willows—
A bushland dream that will not come back!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.


“Paragraph”: Now that I have ap-
peared in print and become universally
famous, I shall, of course, be besieged
by interviewers—young, aspiring para-
graphs who desire to emulate my
success. To them I shall tell the
sober truth. I was born of a poor but
honest parent who needed the money,
and he had written, whether he knew
anything about them or not, statements
about aboriginals, bull-roarers, colts, dogs,
emus, foxes, goannas, hares, ibises, jack-
eroos, kangaroos, lost explorers, minahs,
nulla-nullas and opals. Some of these
returned, being accompanied by ransom.
The rest went into the dark unknown.
So my parent then assaulted all the likely
subjects he could think of —parakeets,
Papuans, platypuses and prawns—that
came next in alphabetical order. No-
thing happened. My parent, who hitherto
had not used his nut very much, became
thoughtful. He said to himself, “I know
what it is ; they doubt whether I know my
subject. I’ll show ’em.” So he tackled
“paragraph.” “After half a century
breeding ’em,” he said to himself, “The
Bulletin will recognise that bird as part
of the Australian fauna.” So I was
tucked in an envelope and arrived with
a batch of other prisoners. I sat in a
"Hey, come into the ring, quick! The tamer’s being hard pressed.”
“Are the lions attacking him?”
“No; but the elephant’s rolled on him.”
court with dozens of others. The Judge
(a man of sinister and irate expression)
gave most of us merely a passing glance,
I know you ; an old offender! ” he would
say, and the poor thing went to join a
hundred other crumpled felons in a lat-
ticed dungeon. (I’m told that later they
were burned.) One or two of us were
laid aside. “Not exactly new,” said the
Judge, “but topical and possibly accu-
rate.” Others, and some of these were
(I noticed) not very well dressed, were
passed on at once to publication. “Never
saw ’em before,” said the Judge, “and
they ring true.” Of others he said “Not
a bad lie,” and passed them on to glory.
And then he came to me. My heart
stood still. “Of all the blasted cheek!”
ejaculated the Judge. I even hit the edge
of the basket, but he grabbed me back
as a relentless voice boomed: “We could
do with another stick or two of ‘Abo.’ ”
So here I am.
* * * *
“E.S.”: A recent reference to the
Yarrabah mission, North Queensland,
recalls its hospital,
which the lubras re-
gard as a rest home.
An old gin one day
walked in and turned
into bed without con-
sulting anybody.
When discovered and
questioned by the sur-
prised nurse, she re-
plied with a weary
shake of her head,
“Me gotum all same
white pfe 11 e r.”
“What’s that?” asked
the nurse. “You
know,” said the new
patient. “That pfeller
tired feelin’.”
* *
“Stope”: In a mine
near Blayney (N.S.W.)
the other day two
men were sinking a
shaft when an under-
ground river broke
through. One was
trapped by the fall of
earth brought down
by the rush of water
and drowned as he
was pegged down.
The other, caught in the swirling and
rapidly rising tide, was carried up close
enough to the top of the shaft to make
his rescue by his mates on top possible.
* sj* * *
“Mundowie”: A queer tucker name is
dogs’ jew’s-harps, by which are known
the currant dumplings that are cooked
when the sugar is done. Scotch coffee
and leather jackets are often close com-
panions. The first is flour roasted in the
pan—a substitute when the tea bag is
empty. The other is unleavened bread,
cooked on the coals in thin wafers, and
called track biscuit. It comes on the
menu when baking powder is exhausted,
* * * *
“Mundowie”: The desolate-looking
Black Mountain, which rises to 2000 ft.
between Cooktown and the Roseville
tin mines, nurses a secret that no ex-
plorer has been able to solve. Its piles
of black granite are almost bare —only a
few small trees crown its summit —but at
its base are numerous dark, tortuous
caves. It is known to the blacks as
Kalcajagga. When any of their number
were wanted by the police they took
refuge in those caves and were safe.
One dusky fugitive lived there for
“The fortune-teller told me a very dark, good-looking man would fall in love
with me.”
“Cripes, missus, my bin have to watch Jacky!”
months, till the Law gave up looking for
him, food being surreptitiously taken to
his hiding-place by his cobbers. On one
occasion two black-trackers, following
the trail of a wanted man, went into the
unexplored caves with revolvers and lan-
terns, and were never heard of again.
The caves go deep down below the level
of the ground, but they have never been
thoroughly explored.
* * *
“S.H.”: Horses can become “jolly
good sprinters” and stayers too if reared
on cows’ milk, despite “Coper” (B.
17/l/’34). C. S. McPhillamy, in his book
“The Thoroughbred,” says “Great mares
are very seldom good dams.... One of
the best horses we ever saw —Newmin-
ster —was reared on a couple of cows.”
In my own experience there are numer-
ous cases of poddied horses becoming
decent racers.
* * * *
“Moukau”: Government departments
are nothing if not deliberate. On a
N.S.W. main roads job it was suddenly
decided to build a bridge by day labor.
One of the engineers was instructed
to prepare his list of requisitions forth-
with and to get on with the job.
He placed the list on the divisional
engineer’s table next morning. No sup-
plies arrived, so the constructing engi-
neer, with the help of the blacksmith,
rigged up a pile-driver, got a gang to-
gether, and, with what makeshifts his
ingenuity could devise, cut and shaped
his timber in the bush near by. Six
months after the bridge was open for
traffic, up came the first instalment of
the requisitions—some bolts for the pile-
driver !
* * * *
“Bill R.”: “Dai R.’s” claim that the
musk-duck holds the feathered long-dis-
tance diving record (B. 24/1/’34) is due
to a misunderstanding of the bird’s
trickery. Rounded projections furnish
the extreme tip of the oily counterfeit’s
upper beak, and they are his tiny pro-
truding nostrils. A couple of minutes
after diving he rises to within a few
inches of the surface, whence he can
extend his prominent breathing apparatus
to the air and himself remain undetected.
Those who are mystified at the length of
time he stays under water don’t know
that he is breathing contentedly all the
while.
* * * *
“Yarri”: Scores of people have missed
fortunes through not knowing ambergris
when they saw it. The other day a young
fellow picked up a lump on a Kempsey
(N.S.W.) beach. It had been passed by
numerous holiday-makers, and a worm-
catcher had been working for days in
the vicinity of the beastly stuff. Which
recalls the experience of the crew of
the Antrope a few years ago. Bound
from Newcastle to Sydney, the ship
sailed into what the crew called a large
quantity of grease, and as a calm pre-
vailed simultaneously they scooped up
buckets of it and used it for slushing
the masts. Later, they learnt from a
druggist that they had wasted over £4OOO
worth of ambergris. Then there was the
gift to two fishermen on the west coast
of Tasmania. McGregor’s whaling ship
Derwent Hunter beached a huge whale.
and after the crew had roughly stripped
the blubber the fishermen —Black Harry
and a Canary Islander named Louis,
who were making for Southport—were
told that they could have the remains.
Louis crawled inside, and discovered a
huge lump of ambergris, which was sold
in Hobart for £ll,OOO.
* * * *
“The Antiquary”: Carp (B. 10/1/’34)
hold the record when it comes to lon-
gevity among fish, many of them attaining
an age of over 400 years. A corpulent and
hoary veteran, known by the name of
Gabrielle, was 475 years old when it was
killed by a huge pike at Chantilly in
1872, a year after it had been purchased
for 1300 francs. It was 29| inches broad
and 38 2-3 inches long.
* * * *
“Avis”: If A. J. Marshall (B. 24/1/’34)
had taken the trouble to read my par.
(27/12/’33) he would have seen that,
while stating that the Albert lyrebird
had been “posted as extinct,” I added that
naturalists averred that it was frequently
heard and seen in the country referred
to. The reference to the bird’s “extinction”
appeared in the Melbourne press, which
was also responsible for locating the pro-
testing naturalist in the Macpherson
Ranges.
* * * *
“Louisade”: That reference to the
cocoa-de-mer of the Seychelles (B.
31/1/ ’34) reminds me. A great many
years ago William MacGregor, in the
course of his job of making British New
Guinea what it is to-day, imported a
number of these double nuts from the
Seychelles with a view to improving the
B.N.G. variety in the days to come. De-
siring to give them an atmosphere some-
what resembling their own, MacGregor
installed the precious nuts in a special
seed-bed on an island in the south-east-
ern division which was also the site of
a Government station. Recommending
the care of the nuts and the natives of
the division in that order to his subordi-
nate, MacGregor departed. Months
passed, and he returned again. Mean-
while the R.M. had acquired a wife,
who extended to the potentate all the
hospitality she could muster. She was
specially proud of a delicious salad
made of the white, cheeselike interior
of a sprouting cocoanut, and expressed
regret to MacGregor that there would be
no more of them since this one was
made of a lot of beautiful seedling
cocoanuts. In spite of stories to the
contrary, MacGregor was a well-man-
nered man. He carried on without
turning a hair, and when the meal was
over rushed to the Seychelles-cocoanut
patch. As he expected, there was no-
thing there but the holes where the pre-
cious importations had once been bedded.
All else had become salad.
BATCHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s not a dressy sort of life; we never change
for dinner;
We don’t adorn the outer man but cater for
the inner.
Our trousers have a check effect, from rough 1
but sturdy patching,
But, if you’re covered, what’s the odds, when
you’re up-country batching?
Our menu doesn’t vary much, no matter what
the weather;
For eggs and bacon in a pan are easy slapped
together.
And if the hens perversely cease to lay and
turn to hatching,
There’s always something in a tin to feed
a fellow batching.
We shave when we go out to call, and that’s
not often, mind you;
For why go out at all —except to leave a wife
behind you?
And when we amble in o’ nights the door needs
no unlatching;
There’s no excuses to invent when you come
home to batching.
What more could any m.an desire? And yet
my mate’s gone stupid.
He’s got a girl to name the day—another scalp
for Cupid!
Alone I wash the dishes up and wonder if it’s
catching.
There’s nothing ties so many knots as five or
six months’ batching.

THE PUNTER TAKES TO BRIDGE.
There’s a field o’ twelve, so they run
it . in three divisions, four starters in
each. I’m drawn with a racy little filly
f’r me pacemaker, an’ there’s an old
stag pacin’ an aged mare agin us. We
all gets away well, but the oppersition
goes to the front. I tries to force the
runnin’ when I gets a run in hearts, but
the old stag crowds me pacemaker, and
clubs us out wide. We’re down 200
enterin’ the straight, when the filly
snorts, props, an’ flicks her ears at me.
She offers to day two spades straight-
out, an’ when the mare offers three
hearts the filly gives me the, oil an’ I
stands up an’ yells four sparklers.
The stag, who’s canterin’ along behind
the field, now feels the whip pulled on
him, an’ sprints to the front. “Four
’earts! ” ’e ’isses. Dead silence in the
ring. The filly shows the whites o’ her
eyes an’ lays her ears back. “She’s
gointer quit gallopin’,” thinks I. Then the
old mare whinnies and—strike me ! —it’s
like a battery.
“Four no-trumps!” squeals the filly.
She cuts in on the rails an’ takes the
runnin’, knockin’ the mare back an’
outer the race. I’m watchin’ the filly, an’
see she’s full o’ runnin’; so when the. old
stag says “Double,” I comes at ’im with
“Redouble, yer cow!”
Well, at the distance the filly falters—
it turns out she’s got a weak ’eart. But
I’m savin’ me trot : for the avenoo an’
puts in a late run o’ sparklers, takes the
lead and canters ’pme without so much

LAPSE TO BARBARISM.
. “The speech of the young is influenced to
a great extent by the screen. It is a reason
wHy we must encourage our children to attend
British films.”
Johnny, who had done a course of
educative British films, was playing with
his train when his friend Bluey, another
patron of the culture of Elstree, put his
head over the fence.
“May I come and play with your
train?” he asked politely.
“By all means, my dear fellow,” was
.he response, “and pray bring your
marbles with you.”
“I think it would be only fair of me
to let you bestride my bicycle, since you
have granted me the privilege of examin-
ing your mechanical contrivance,” said
Bluey, and so saying lifted the convey-
ance over the fence.
Mrs. Shandy, a product of an earlier
film generation,. was moved to address
her neighbor.
“Say, girlie! It sure makes my heart
beat some to see your kiddo and mine
makin’ whoopee that a-way.”
“You’re tellin’ me,” said Mrs. Ryan.
“They sure is one great pair o’ bozos.”
When he had had enough Johnny dis-
mounted.
“The bicycle,” he observed, “is apt to
pall if indulged in over too lengthy a
period.”
“Quite,” agreed Bluey, and withdrew
with it to his own demesne.
Johnny went back to his toys. Sud-
denly he stiffened with horror. Some-
thing was missing. In face of the appal-
ling wrong that had been done him his
talkie education fell to earth like a dis-
carded sock.
“Hey, mu-u-m! ” he howled. “Bluey

; THE THROWN PARTY.
If you’ve ever thrown a party (having
cash to throw away) and surveyed the
bunch of throw-ins who arrive to make
it gay, you’ll probably recall a fact that’s
fairly widely known ; viz., there’s never
any party like the party that is thrown.
You have thrown out invitations, and
your door’s thrown open wide. To a
throne you think they’ll vote you, but
you’re simply thrown aside. Fellows butt
in (utter strangers) and direct, with
chests thrown out, the show ; it seems
their party as they throw their weight
about!
There’s a cove with songs to sing you
—he just throws ’em off his chest—and
The only pebble on the beach.
you can’t well throw off at him, since he’s
giving of his best.
In the throes of sore repentance all my
cash I find is blown. Hear me swear
off future parties—of the kind, I mean,
that’s thrown.

I’ve noticed it. After Ledger’s differ-

under the impression that he had gone to
live at Long Bay. Not at all! “He’s
gone to the Mountains,” said his wife—
“possibly for three years.”
When the Flashleighs closed down their
Bellevue Hill home, the explanation was
that the air didn’t agree with Mrs. F.
The family, I was told, had decided to
live in the Mountains. It struck me as
strange in the circumstances that I
should keep running into them on the
Drummoyne tram.
The Gayley girl was warned, time
and again, about Diddler—a married
man with family complete. Anyhow,
she’s gone to live in the Mountains, too.
And a few weeks ago Skiter told me
that the reason he turned in his city
job was that he couldn’t fit in the work
with his desire to live in the Mountains.
Yesterday I heard that Skiter had been
trying for weeks to land another job.
It’s enough to make a man wonder if
anyone lives in the Mountains at all.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Williamstown racing was not particu-
larly informative concerning the claims of
candidates for big autumn events. Hall
Mark went down before Gaine Carring-
ton in the Williamstown Stakes; but the
Maorilander met him on 51b. better than
weight-for-age terms, and neither C. B.
Kellow nor his trainer was dismayed over
the result: Holt realised that Gaine Car-
rington, who was favorite, was more for-
ward in condition than his colt. Gaine
Carrington had developed suspensory
ligament trouble on the previous day, and
in starting him a breakdown was risked.
Worth £l5OO to the winner and con-
tested for the first time, the Williamstown
Stakes attracted only four runners —a
poor reward for enterprise. Frank
McGrath saddled up Deputy Ruler and
Adam Skirving stripped Ruach. Pike
contrived to make the task of Gaine Car-

rington easy. He went to the front and
slowed down the field so dismally that it
took 2min. llsec. to run the \\ miles,
time which the February Trial winner,
Amazon Queen, bettered by 3*sec. Not
until the straight had been entered was
Gaine Carrington seriously challenged.
The whip was drawn on Hall Mark, but
Pike sat in the saddle like a graven image
to score brilliantly by a length. Gaine
Carrington was obviously lame in the off-
foreleg when he returned to scale.
Deputy Ruler had an unfortunate ex-
perience. The saddle slipped and K.
Cook had to concentrate on avoidance of
a fall. He dismounted after passing the
post, the saddle then being half-way along
the colt’s neck. Deputy Ruler may be a
good one, but is far from stoutly built.
Hall Mark also is on the small side, but
he exudes quality. Ribs of the son of
Heroic were showing through the satin
polish of his skin, and many good judges
expressed the conviction that he can be
brought to concert pitch quickly.
Jack Donohoe, of Randwick, has the
best two-year-old filly on the Australian
turf in Arachne, whom he trains for
Norman Robinson, nephew of the late
Lionel Robinson. Arachne (Corban —
Welkin Queen) cost a mere 75gns. at the
yearling sales, and is the only galloper of
exceptional merit that Corban has sired.
Sent out at 6 to 4 on for the Electric
Handicap, she carried Bst. 1 lib. and made
the opposition look cheap. Devoncourt,
who finished second, is a promising colt
by Devonshire from Traquette, dam of
the 1932 Ascot Vale Stakes winner,
Powerscourt. It is intended to run
Arachne in the Caulfield Futurity Stakes,
an event that no juvenile has captured
since Palmer scored for James Wilson in
1900.
George Jones, who had charge of
Sasanof in the latter days of that horse’s
career on the turf, made his influence felt
at Williamstown. He won the Wyndham
Handicap with Greenhorn and ran second
in the last race on the card with Stag-
horn. Both gallopers belong to W. R.
Kemball, who accumulated a fortune out
of picture-theatres in Maoriland and lives
there, but prefers to have his colors car-
ried in Melbourne, where his early man-
hood was spent. Greenhorn has 7st. 61b.
in the Australian Cup, and the manner
in which he came home suggests that he
will be hard to beat. He covered 11 fur-
longs in 2min. 18|sec., which equals the
course record put up by Carlita in the
Williamstown Cup of 1915.
The sprint victory of Middle Watch
evoked warm applause. Tindall has
worked wonders with this infirm stallion ;
fine courage enabled Middle Watch to
cut down Rose Mignon in the first divi-
sion of the Marine Handicap and win by
half a neck. Palphar, who vanquished
Hall Mark in the Caulfield Guineas,
chased Rose Mignon up to a furlong
from home and then knocked up. He will
improve.
* * * *
Lavington was a failure on previous
visits to Sydney, but M.L. trainer Horty
Lorigan, whose home is at Wellington,
is now making good money with him. In
the Canterbury Handicap Lavington went
out at 6 to 4, and won well from the
pacemaker, Rogerson, and Fickle Bal-
loon —his second success this trip. Lav-
ington, who is by Gaine Carrington’s
sire Hunting Song, has 7st. in the King’s
Cup, and 7st. 21b. in the Sydney and Aus-
tralian Cups.
Questionnaire remains a model of con-
sistency. Favorite at 2 to 1 for the Flying
Handicap at Canterbury, the Legionnaire
mare did not commence well, but Darby
Munro almost scraped the paint off the
fence to get her through in the first fur-
long. It was then a procession ; Mon-
tego was a poor second, with Red
Shadow third, and the well-backed Loyal
Verde a bad fourth.
Fluent, who is owned by a Sydney
medico, has at last lived up to the
promise she gave early in her career.
The daughter of Chatterbox (4 to 1)
made hacks of the opposition in the
Maiden Handicap. Just as easily gained
was the victory of the Canterbury-trained
Varnottar (3 to 1) in the youngsters’
race; and nine-year-old Sarinch made
light of his lOst. 81b. in the first division
of the Highweight. Early backers took
fours, but he eased to sevens.
Moorefield trainer Jack Cush has
pleasant memories of Encre, the dam
of Gravure. The .latter, carrying his
colors, surprised him by leading all the
way in the Ashbury Handicap ; nominally
at 10 to 1, she gave the bookies a clean
sheet. The favorite, Prince’s Daughter,
would not gallop a yard. Babili, second,
also shirked it in the last furlong.
It was a fortunate day for trainer Cecil
Russell when he took over Charalf,. the
Cistercian gelding. Ridden by an appren-
tice, McFarlane, Charalf (3 to 1) proved
too good for Jacko’s stable-mate Mesha
in the second division of the Highweight,
with Royal Park in the minor placing.
Charalf is held on lease until 1935.
* * * *
Every year Rosehill trainer Booth goes
to Manly for his annual holidays, and
as a rule his horses are lucky while he
is there. Recently the veteran won a
race with Constantine at Randwick, but
lost it on protest. He had other strokes
of misfortune, and said, with a wry smile,
that the sooner he went to Manly the
better. He descended on the Village, and
almost immediately Leila Vale captured
the Adrian Knox Stakes for him. And at
the postponed Rosehill meeting Booth
arrived from Manly to see three more of
his neddies win. One of them was Tin-
galba, who saw out a middle-distance
admirably, and perhaps the son of Tre-
clare is going to develop into a stayer.
* * * *
Fred Seeley has been appointed secre-
tary of Sydney City Tatt.’s Club. For
10 years he has been assistant to Owen
Maidment, and he is still only 27. There
is a great rush for these positions when
they fall vacant; applications numbered
127, and came from all over Australia.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Opposed to the massive Beth, Sam
Burmeister, an Esthonian who claims to
have met the great Gama, looked about
the best wrestler seen at Leichhardt.
A splits hold gained him the only real
fall, but he was adjudged the loser on
two penalty falls, for twice punching the
referee. He also stoushed Beth, and
that warrior bled freely before the thing
was stopped in the sixth. Australian
Tommy Nylan and Bulgarian George
Penchiff also provided spectacular wrest-
ling at Newtown. Each scored a fall,
but Penchiff was presented with a points
win.
ins and Outs
“Aigburth”: Last week that good little
Balmain left-hand bowler and batsman
Billy Hunt left to take up an engage-
ment with a Lancashire League cricket
club, where he will run into his old mate
Sid Hird. In Sheffield cricket Hunt took
48 wickets for an average of 20.70, a
dashed good one as modern bowling
figures go. Batting, his average was 14.76
for 17 innings. He is one of the many
whom the eccentric methods of Austra-
lian selectors have driven to other coun-
tries for recognition.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: The case of Owen
Smith, who has represented South Africa
at cricket and England at Rugby foot-
ball, has a parallel. One of Surrey
county’s players is Melville, a South
African who is also an Oxford cricket
blue. Melville, at the time in his native
Natal, for which he was to appear in the
Currie Cup series, was notified that if he
turned out for Natal he would not be
eligible in future for Surrey teams.
* * ifc *
“Huon”: The great success of the
young Tasmanian batsman Badcock this
season has been followed by the usual
urge to embrace professionalism. He had
hardly put his hooves on Melbourne soil
with the visiting Tassie team before half
a dozen clubs tried to slip the hobbles
over them for the next season. Jobs are
to be found for him, of course, if he con-
sents to make Victoria his home.
* * * *
“The Prooshan”: In view of the de-
mand for cricket all-rounders for export,
as well as home service, why not start
State cricket schools of instruction where
blob batsmen and indifferent fieldsmen
but really fine bowlers, like Bill O’Reilly,
might quickly develop all-round quali-
fications? Let expert bowlers teach bats-
men how to bowl decently, and star
batsmen instruct bowlers how to make
runs, as well as defend their wickets, and
let the fielding specialist instruct both.
(Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: Gordon Lowe, a great
player in his day—he won the Austra-
lian championship in 1915—and one of
England’s most reliable writers on tennis,
is very confident of Australia winning
through to the challenge round to stack
up against England at Wimbledon. Lowe
expects the Australians to win the Euro-
pean zone and beat America in the inter-
zone final, in spite of the formidable side
the Yanks can field, even without Vines.
He adds the rider that all depends on
Crawford regaining the super-form he
showed last year in England, and
shrewdly comments that the Australian
has not been the same player since he
succumbed in America last year to the
strain of five years of continual tennis.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Japan is to send five
players and a coach to Europe. The men
mentioned as likely to make up the play-
ing team are Nishimura, Yamagishi, Fuji-
kura, Satoh and Nunoi. The fact that the
last two are ranked behind Nishimura,
Fujikura and Yamagishi as singles
players, and below Nishimura and
Yamagishi for the first doubles, should
make some of our optimists think. A
combination that can rank Satoh and
Nunoi as second-class players must be a
pretty hot one.
* * * *
“Heath”: English tennis circles are
not pleased with the Wimbledon de-
cision adopting a new method of making
the All-England championship draw,
which entails the distribution of byes
throughout the draw instead of their
appearing only at the top and bottom as
heretofore. The inventors consider the
new plan will avoid the luck element in
the draw, but there are many dissenters.
Byes are a nuisance in any form of sport.
o Continued on page 26.)
Overseas Rugby Union results last
week showed England victor over Ireland
at Dublin by 13-3 (3 tries, 2 converted,
to a try). England, with Scotland to meet,
is the only undefeated member of the
four British Unions.
In Japan the Australian Universities
team showed a surprising reversal of
form by beating Waseda, the champions
of Nippon, 21-6. They followed that up
by winning the first Test with Japan on
Saturday by 18-8.
* * * *
N.S.W. won the Kieran Shield, thanks
largely to the splendid swimming of Noel
Ryan on the final day of the Australian
championships in Sydney. In the mile
Ryan broke half a dozen standing Aus-
tralian records. His time for the distance
was 21min. 36 3-ssec., 33 2-ssec. better
than his own previous best. The 100
yards took Ryan 55 4-ssec., two-fifths of
a second better than P. Hooper’s standing
Australian figures. H. Tickle, of N.S.W.,
won the high diving with 92.64 points
from the much-fancied champion,
Masters, of Victoria, who scored 91.51.
* * * *
The Australian dirt-track motor-cycling
team won the third and last Test with
the English riders at the Speedway Royal
at Sydney by 28 points to 26, thus
bringing back to Australia the champion-
ship lost to England in London last year.
The result was in doubt until Lamont
took the last race. R. Case, another Aus-
tralian, was second, and Parkinson filled
third place for England. H. M. Steven-
son, the greatest rider seen here, won all
his events with ease from his Australian
opponents and scored nine of England’s
points off his own bat.
* * * *
The South Australian eight-oar cham-
pionship in Adelaide ended dramatically.
Soon after the start, when Torrens was
leading, No. 3, D. Mutch, broke his oar
and dived overboard. The boat lost 10
yards, but cox D. Earl picked up his
crew splendidly and urged them on to
a grand win from Renmark by three feet.

ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip”: If the selection of the
team for England raised some eyebrows
the frantic attempts of the selectors to
rake together a mob to tour Maoriland
were mirth-provoking. For one reason
and another a number of those chosen
excused themselves, like the Biblical
guests asked to the wedding feast, and
towards the finish the whole country was
raked to find a team. Tom Garrett wasn’t
approached, but he must be about the
only one. The chief trouble was, of
course, that only 15s. a day pocket-money
was to have been paid. In these pros-
perous times to offer an amateur cricketer
only five guineas a week over and above
all his expenses isn’t nearly good enough.
What the Maorilanders, who were hoping
for a decent side, able to pay expenses at
the gates at least, thought of the collec-
tion headed by the venerable Jack Ryder
would probably sound more respectable
if translated into Maori. They cancelled
the tour.
* * * *
With the Sheffield Shield contest over
there was mild interest last week in the
match in Melbourne between a Victorian
second eleven and Tassie. The Tas-
manians led off with 388, Badcock tack-
ing up 104, his third consecutive century
against the Cabbage Garden this season.
Victoria was out for 68 in its first knock
.(Thomas 5-14, Walsh 3-16), but closed
in the second with 560 for six wickets.
Lee (258) and Quin (210) beat the world’s
record score for fourth wicket in a first-
class match, the 448 put up 42 years ago
by Abel and Hayward for Surrey against
Yorkshire. The match was drawn.
* * * *
“Hopper”: The old hands of the Aus-
tralian Eleven in England this year will
miss H. T. Hardinge, in his day one of the
finest opening batsmen in England. Kent
has decided not to re-engage him this
year and has given him £SOO as a fare-
well gift. In his long years of cricket
Hardinge scored over 35,000 runs and
made 75 centuries in first-class cricket.
He figured in one Test, that at Leeds
against the Australians in 1921, when he
averaged 15 for the two innings. A great
professional Soccer player with Sheffield
United and Arsenal, Hardinge was capped
for England against Scotland in 1910.
* * * *
“The Adje”: Those who recall the
big asphalt square in Sydney’s Victoria
Barracks when it resounded to the trum-
petings of the n.c.os. putting the young
entry through its facings will hear with
mingled pleasure and regret that it has
now been transformed into a turf-clad
cricket ground. Next week will see a
series of matches begin between the dash-
ing militaires of Victoria and N.S.W.
The kick-off will be on February 19. A
match between Vic. and N.S.W. services
will round off a perfect week—that is,
supposing the canteen doesn’t run out of
beer.

Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Australia won
the fourth tennis Test at Adelaide by
seven rubbers to five, this making four
off the reel. The outstanding items of
the affair were Quist’s defeat of Perry
by excelling the latter at his own game
of rushing the net, and another poor
showing by Crawford, who went down
to Lee. Crawford and Hopman beat Lee
and Wilde, but Perry and Hughes were
too good for Quist and Turnbull. The
English press is again complaining of
the three-set matches, as “not to be taken
seriously.” But the visitors asked for
them.
* * * ❖
“Cash Amateur”: In some blurb con-
cerning the English tennis team in Aus-
tralia, London “Evening News” calls on
the United Kingdom to preserve Perry
for the next Davis Cup and to win back
the All-England championship at Wimble-
don. It protests that “continually for
four years” Perry has been playing
tennis “in England, U.S.A., South
America, M.L., South Africa and the
West Indies.” The journal also com-
plains of the Australian tour as being
designed “only for publicity and the box-
office,” and advises Perry to conserve his
energies, as he only gets “some of the
publicity and none of the box-office.”
What do Perry and his fellow-amateurs
of the tennis hierarchy want with sordid
box-offices, anyway? It is evident that
they all have immense private means of
their own, else how could they play
tennis as amateurs from dawn to dewy
eve and from China to Peru all the year
round?
* * * *
“Baseline”: This year’s draw for the
1934 Davis Cup is eloquent of the fact
that in future years seeding will be im-
perative. As it is, three of the most-
fancied teams will meet early, and this
must mean a loss of interest. In the first
round of the European section, Czecho-
slovakia, M.L., Italy, Germany, Australia
and Japan have byes. In America the
U.S. plays Canada, Mexico sitting on
the fence. In South America, Brazil and
Peru clash, the winner meeting the victor
of the North, in this case sure to be
U.S.A. In the second round Australia
plays the strong Japs and, provided a
win is scored, has another tough lot to
meet in the Germans. That hurdle
cleared, the Czecho-Slovakians have to
be encountered. Winning here, and
France having been disposed of, Aus-
tralia should meet U.S.A. in the inter-
zone final, and if our players do that
they will know they have been travelling.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: After sitting tight for a
couple of weeks to see if Papa Hartigan,
of N.S.W., could be kidded into footing
the entire bill for the trip of daughter
Joan to Wimbledon, the Australian
tennis heads last week reluctantly made
up their minds to contribute £lOO. The
decision was hastened by some plain
speaking on the part of the stern parent,
who said he was not going to face the
entire expense so that the L.T.A. might
make money from exhibition matches by
his daughter on her return from Europe.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: As was expected, the
L.T.A. declined to add Hopman to
the Australian Davis Cup team, though
there is any amount of evidence that a
strong reserve player may be urgently
needed any time during the tour. The
L.T.A. explains that to send Hopman
would cost just about the profit made
on the last tour and, considering it has
had to find £350 for Mrs. Crawford,
whose husband will not make the trip
to England without her, it really cannot
be done. For tough luck and queer
treatment by their respective sports
authorities, Hopman and Ron Oxenham
make a good double.
“Hotham”: The Australian tennis
heads got the shock of their lives when
Stanley Youdale, who made such a sue-
cess of managing the last Davis Cup
team, notified that he was giving the job
a miss this time. Youdale says he can-
not spare the time from his business. It
will be hard to replace him, for he fitted
the tricky job like a made-to-measure
glove.
* * * *
“Prunes and Prisms”: The Manly golf
club official who objected to Jim Fer-
rier’s bare shins (B. 7/ 2 / ’34) is far from
being the only wowser in the sporting life
of the village. Its tennis heads are talking
of banning the wearing of shorts by male
tennis-players under their jurisdiction.
There is strong opposition to this among
the lads, and if the ban is imposed
they threaten to go on strike until the
women are stopped from appearing in
backless frocks and without stockings. It
is a good move and almost certain to
work. A tigress robbed of her whelps is
a mild circumstance compared with a
flapper compelled to wear clothing she
has made up her mind is superfluous.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Yandina”: Crows, magpies and
goannas have been so much to the fore
as golf-ball stealers of late that they have
ceased to be “news.” Stalemate has been
lifted. At Maroochy (Q.) a kookaburra
descended on a four-baller and, picking
the brand-new ball out of the lot, re-
turned to his perch in a gum-tree, where
he proceeded to whack it hard on a limb.
The owner danced beneath the bough
and hurled stones and even irons at it.
“This boy o’ mine boxes like Griff o, ’its like Dempsey, is quicker on ’ees feet
than any ballet-dahncer, an’ is the cleverest lad in Aussie with ’ees ’ead.”
“Can ’e croon?”
None of these had any effect, but after
another spell of banging the pill on the
limb Jack came to the conclusion that
it was, as tucker, a washout, and
departed, first dropping it on its owner’s
head.
* * * *
Victorian golf lost a lifelong supporter
when Alex. Macneil passed out in Mel-
bourne the other day as the result of a
motor accident. A foundation member
of Riversdale club, one of the oldest in
Victoria, he was its honored president
from 1900 to 1915. To the last he was
a prominent figure on the links, mid-
week four-ballers with some cronies
being his particular vanity, and few men
have more enjoyed the social side of the
game.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: Though they decided
to cancel their proposed tour of Aus-
tralia early this year because it would
clash with the Melbourne golf festivi-
ties, Joe Kirkwood and Sarazen will be
with us in time to take part in the Mel-
bourne tourney and, if possible, the Aus-
tralian open event at Rose Bay. . The
pair will come by the route originally
mapped, Japan, Manila, Australia, and
then on home via M.L. and Honululu.
In between the tournaments the pair will
conduct an exhibition tour of the States.
* * * *
“Pie”: After driving a good-length
ball on the Gympie (Q.) links, Harry
McKenna took an iron club for the next
stroke. With the backward movement
of his shot, a brown snake became en-
tangled on the club. The beast was killed
and the corpse hung on a near-by fence
as a warning to other serpents intruding
on golfing Edens.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Though the N.S.W. Golf
Council has at last yielded to pressure
and consented to seed the draw for the
State championships in July there has
been no move to abolish the present sys-
tem of 18-hole rounds of match play,
which do not give a better player a
chance to pull up on an inferior one who
has fluked away on a lucky lead. Opinion
among players generally is that qualify-
ing rounds of 36 holes stroke should be
adopted again, 32 to qualify and not 16,
as at present, while match play should be
over 36 holes. This would go far to level
matters up and cut out the element of
luck.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: Queensland Golf Union
has hit upon the bright notion of sending
a good professional on a tour of coun-
try clubs to show the locals by
example and precept how the R. and A.
game can be played. N.S.W. has made
experiments in this direction. .These
have been supplemented by exhibition
tours, and results have been encouraging.
Many of the Queensland outback club
exchequers do not run to the maintenance
of a professional. To these the visits of
a travelling coach would be of the great-
est benefit, and the cost, helped by small
subsidies from the clubs profiting under
the scheme, should not be outrageous.
* * * *
This year’s Walker Cup tourney has
some extra interest for Australians in that
Michael Scott will probably lead the
Britons, for all his 55 years. His form
last year when he beat the American
Dunlap for the amateur championship,
after which his opponent went home to
wipe up the American title, has stamped
Scott as good as ever. In 1924 he won
two of the three points scored by the
Britons, among his victims being one
Robert T. Jones. Perhaps he can swing
the luck this year. Something of the sort
will have to be done, for Britain hasn’t
won since the series started in 1922.
Car and Cycle
“Pismire”: An unusual motoring in-
cident is reported from Liverpool
(N.S.W.). A driver crawled under his
car to investigate, and was so furiously
attacked and bitten by bulldog ants that
he had to be treated for his wounds at a
near-by residence. The reason for this
hymenopterous roughhouse was a mys-
tery until someone discovered that the
car had been halted over the ants’ nest.
As the car in question was one of these
tiny dinguses which are difficult to dis-
tinguish from insects it is easy to under-
stand the indignation of the emmets at
the unwarranted intrusion of one of
their own class probably bent on jump-
ing their claim.
He * * *
“Whizz”: Keeping pace with motor-car
speed records is a wearisome job. They
happen when one sleeps, and no sooner
is the latest figure jotted down than
another is hoisted. English driver Eyston
is the latest to make a splurge. Usually
he affects small cars, but this time was
driving an 8-cylinder Panhard in the B
class (5001-8000 c.c.) at Montlhery. He
kicked up 133.01 miles in an hour and
100 in 45min. 7.9sec., which means an
average of 132.8 m.p.h. Two hundred
kilometres were covered in 56min.
2.78sec., an average of 133.04 m.p.h. All
are world’s records.
* * * *
“Corner”: The Australian dirt-track
season, with its Test duels between the
English and Australian teams, was cut
short when the English riders received
notice that they were required in Britain
as soon as possible, for the opening of
the season there. They were in Brisbane
when the news came, and had to scoot
for Sydney, where they drew with Aus-

The Australian pushbike amateur
championships were run off at Sydney
Velodrome and saw Victoria get a better
share of the plunder than for some time
past. Goodwin, of the Cabbage Garden,
retained his five-mile title on the opening
night, and fellow-countryman Foster took
the junior mile and five-mile in fine style,
in addition to winning the three-mile
junior point-score race. R. Porter, of
N.S.W., won the mile in lmin. 56 4-5sec.,
barely beating Goodwin home. Duncan
Gray was successful in holding the 10-
mile senior title, and was going well in
the five when another rider brought him
down. This race went to the titleholder,
Pethybridge, of N.S.W., whose time was
9min. 58sec.

“Fitzcray”: The Digger spirit still
crops up. Witness the ride from Mel-
bourne to Sydney on a pushbike of Nor-
man Foote, who left a leg in France. A
few miles out of Melbourne, he lost a
purse containing his scanty store of
.money. He rode back to look for it,
before giving up the search as hope-
less. Instead of eating and sleeping
in hotels, as he had intended, he got
food where he could, and slept in the
open. At Albury he sold his tennis
racquet and sent part of the proceeds back
for food debts contracted. He rode into
Sydney from Liverpool on a penn’orth of
chips, and had to wait on the south side
of the bridge until a relative living on
the Shore came along with the necessary
money for the toll.

the N.S.W. representatives. One of these,
H. C. Press 111, was built on the latest
Whereat model also, and as she won one
of the three races there can be no doubt
about the efficiency of the design. Yet
it is only a return to the fashion of years
ago before the “skimming-dish” craft
came in. The new model is cheaper to
build, is far better into a wind, and has
a smaller sail area than the old. Also
she carries a smaller • crew, and that all
makes for the economy most of us are
supposed to be hunting for to-day. Build-
ing, rigging and sailing even these com-
paratively small boats come expensive.

“Rickety Kate”: The cancellation of
the tour of the English bowling team has
been welcomed rather than otherwise by
Australian players. The Australian cham-
pionships carnival at Adelaide next
month will be followed later by a cen-
tenary jamboree in Melbourne, and then
there will be inter-State matches as well.
Many of our prominent bowlers feel
that with the addition of a British tour
the burden would be greater than they
could bear, even in these days of economy
when everyone adds a little water to it.

“Spike”: Before the end of the month
we shall know the Australian team tor
the Empire Games. The five selectors—
three from N.S.W. and two from Vic-
toria will not get busy until after Feb-
ruary 19, when nominations close. At
present those with a good chance for
the track and field items are jumper Met-
calfe and quarter-miler Golding, of
N.S.W.; P. McLardy, of Victoria, whose
performance in winning the national
h “ rtte > in Adelaide stamps him as a
champion; T. Irwin, of Victoria, the
half .^ii er and Noe l Dempsey, of
Queensland, who broke evens in the 100
at Adelaide, and was only beaten by a
whisker in the 220. J. C. Horsfall, now
at Cambridge, will join the team in Eng-
land, and as a sprinter of the first class
should greatly strengthen it.
“Withering Tyke”: The immortal

on Ilkley Moor has an opposite number
in Australia. This is John Brown, who
managed the Queensland athletic team
visiting Adelaide. Eight years ago when
Brisbane was housing the Australian
championships, Brown blossomed in a
boater straw, the first seen thereabout for
many years. Seeing the Southerners off
after the meeting, he was deprived of it.
Since then the lid has received the auto-
graphs of many famous athletes, its wan-
derings including a trip to the Amster-
dam Olympiad. Brown was allowed a
glimpse of it at the Adelaide meeting,
but was told it was being held in reserve
for the next national championships at
Hobart in two years’ time. In between
it is likely to journey to London for the
Empire Games, acquiring fresh signa-
tures as it goes.

gratifying to note when Sydney Show

THE STUFF ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'S
MEGGTTS LINSEED MEAL
BEATING THE BLOWFLY.
“G.H.H.”: Facts and fancies are mixed
by “Lion” (B. 3/1 / ’34), and . the amend-
ment by “512” (B. 24/1/’34) is not com-
plete. The whole area of the sheep coun-
try is permeated by the small green Lucilia
cuprina (a relative of L. sericcita), which
is the main cause of strike. Although five
species of the large brown blowflies,
genus Calliphora, are also capable of pri-
mary strike on sheep, such cases are pro-
bably local and restricted. The other
green fly, Chrysomyia rufifacies (the one
with the “hairy” maggot), follows the
original strike, but there is no assurance
that it acts as a check on primary flies.
Evidence suggests otherwise.
No Australian investigators now believe
in the efficiency of traps, parasites, birds,
carcass destruction and other much-dis-
cussed theories beloved by the layman,
and soon treatment for the poisoning of
maggots in the wool will be discarded in
the light of researches now proceeding.
Modern research turns back to the old
theory that bacteria in the wool lead the
blowfly to lay eggs there, and make the
fleece, and later the flesh, into a suitable
maggot food medium.
Blowflies are not all curse. It was an
American who discovered that maggots
can be used to cure osteomyelitis, a bone-
wasting disease which leaves an ever-
running sore, rarely responsive to medical
treatment; it is one of the worst troubles
that flesh is heir to. Maggots are steril-
ised, placed in the sore and allowed to
clear away all decayed matter; and they
so change the nature of the wound that
healing takes place.
The bacteria render bits of the sheep
into carrion, whilst the fly clears away
dead matter, leaving bare the living
matter for the bacteria to break down
ahead of it —that is what seems to happen
in the cases of fly-blow. The dead
matter is not given a chance of forming
into a healing scab. As long as the bac-
teria do not act, the maggots do not
act, and vice versa.
DEAD WOOL.
“Murrawong”: The heavy sheep losses
of last year have resulted in larger quan-
tities of dead wool coming on the market
than for many years. The handling of
dead wool is not a pleasant job, and most
sheepowners prefer to give the collecting,
at so much per pound delivered at the
press, to contractors, who get not only
the wool but everything pertaining to it.
Thus the buyer pays for the collecting of
a high percentage of bones, sticks and
dirt, which further add to the cost of
pressing and rail freight and reduce the
sale value of the parcel.
The best vehicle for collecting dead
wool is an old sulky or spring cart with
the flooring removed and a lin. wire net-
ting basket or coop in its place. The wool
is piled into this and most of the dust
and dirt is shaken out en route. Carry
a few chaff-bags to hold plucked wool
and fork the other stuff on to the net-
ting after shaking out as much bones and
dirt as possible. It is safer to wear
leather-gloves when handling dead wool.
They may be hot; but dead-wool collect-
ing is a cold-weather job. A tin of mixed
disinfectant or sheep dip should also be
kept handy. Don’t stack dead wool in
the shearing-shed ; if it is necessary to
press it there, sweep all the dust from the
press and wool room and disinfect thor-
oughly when the job is finished.
There are three ways of marketing
dead wool. (1) The all-in method —usu-
ally shovelled straight into bags and
sent direct to the broker. (2) Consign-
ing it thus to a repacking firm and having
it sorted before sale. (3) Sorting it your-
self.
Those who wish to get full market
value for their product and at the same
time save freight and cost of sorting will
find the following hints useful.
Get all the wool in one heap before
sorting, as the treatment varies with the
amount to be handled. For quantities
of less than one bale it is simpler to
market in chaff-bags. For larger lots,
work as follows: (1) Separate merino
and crossbred wool and treat each simi-
larly. (2) Remove all bones, shake and
tear up wool as much as possible to free
from dirt and sticks. (3) Work wool into
two heaps — (a) wool with skin adhering
to it, and ( b ) wool free of skin.
Plucked wool (bright, clean wool gar-
nered before the animal has been long
dead) will sell almost as well as. fleece.
Brand these lines PLK, SKIN Pcs ( a ) and
DEAD ( b ). Where there is a large num-
ber of bales of the last it will pay to
make two lines.
The best wool (anything that will tear
apart easily) may be branded FIRST
DEAD, and the low, earthy and matted
wool, DEAD. Where there has been an-
thrax on the property it is dangerous to
handle or market dead wool —burn it;
and when working with any dead wool,
be very careful of cuts or scratches. Wash
the hands frequently in disinfectant and
apply iodine to any wounds until thor-
oughly healed.
POINTS IN SHEEP-MATING.
“F.L.8.”: “Anti-Dorset” (B. 24/1/’34)
says that D.H. rams will “mate at any
old time.” So will Romneys, English and
Border Leicesters if carefully handled.
We have mated all three breeds with
great success, usually averaging 80 p.c.
to 95 p.c. according to seasonal con-
ditions.
Rams should be .well fed on the best of
pastures before mating, not starved down
“because they are fat.” A ram will soon
thin himself while retaining his strength
and vitality. Keep him well fed; he
will do the rest.
When about to join ewes, put 2 p.c. of
the youngest rams in the mob for a
fortnight. Then add 3 p.c. Five per
cent, has always given us the best results ;
anything under is not enough. Small
lambings can often be traced to ram
shortage.
Watch the rams every day as soon as
joined, and, if they do not appear in-
terested, yard ewes and rams at least
every second night. Yard them moder-
ately tight. Two good rules: “Get the
rams working quickly” and “Use only
young stud rams.”
Get rid of six-tooths. They sell well at
that age, when their usefulness begins to
decline.
After your rams have been six weeks
with ewes, put them on extra good feed
for a fortnight. Then replace them in the
mob again for a further fortnight.
THE FRUGAL ABERDEEN.
“Barrabooriong”: The idea that the
black poley is not suited for our condi-
tions is entirely a myth. He can fend
for himself with the best of them. I
have watched him, in a drought, pushing
the sapling between his forelegs and eat-
ing the tops as he goes—with an energy
and a businesslike purpose that would
make a horned beast green with envy.
And he can range away from water with
the best of them.
Hitherto the only real objection to the
A.-A. has been an alleged penchant for
going wild on the big runs, where contact
with man is at its minimum. But with
the establishment of a trade in chilled
meat this idea of letting cattle breed for
themselves—like Kipling’s seals—will have
to go by the board.
Young steers will need to be worked
in to the fattening grounds to provide
the baby beef, and there should be little
chance under those conditions for devel-
oping wildness.
As far back as the early ’eighties it
was established that this hardy native of
a rigorous and moist climate could fatten
well in Queensland. And just before the
war Americans carried out an ex-
tensive propaganda in the North on its
behalf. The studs that now exist are
capable of supplying the best herd bulls,
and expanded shipping of chilled meat
should put this fine breed into the place
it should have earned long ago.
THE CARE OF WHEELS.
“Maurice”: The tyres should be set
up tight before wooden cart or waggon
wheels are painted. When the wheels
thoroughly dry, the rims should be run
slowly through hot linseed oil, which
should cover the felloes completely and
reach far enough up the spokes to fill the
joints between spokes and rim. The oil
should be held in a narrow trough of
galvanised-iron, wide enough to admit the
wheel. The proper temperature is a little
below water boiling point. If the oil
boils, it may injure the fibre of the wood.
It is better to keep the temperature down
and run the wheel in it for a considerable
time. After oiling allow a day or two
for the oil to set, when the wheel may be
given two coats of ordinary paint.
SPONTANEOUS FIRES.
“Seenitall”: Recently I heard of a
strange case of spontaneous combustion,
which might have been disastrous.
A farmer was cutting hay with a
reaper-and-binder, and, having run out of
twine, fetched two balls back in a brand-
new tin dish after dinner. One he put
into the machine, the other he left in
the dish on the ground, near his work
and close to some sheaves.
On going to the basin for the second
ball, he found a heap of hot ashes only.
He concluded that the bright tin dish had
concentrated the fierce rays of the sun
on one spot of the twine, thus causing it
to ignite. Only luck prevented the burn-
ing twine from firing his crop.
A wind during a hot summer will rub
two limbs of a dead box-tree together
and cause them to catch fire. Such trees
are always a potential source of danger.
Glass bottles have often been known
to start fires in the same way as the tin
dish, especially the white variety. These
should not be allowed about the run.
Prevention is ever better than cure.
GRAZING LUCERNE.
“Cassilis”: Now that wool prices have
made more money available to wool-
growers they should consider laying down
more lucerne, which, of course, may
mean more subdivision. In most N.S.W.
districts it will be found profitable to
grow grazing lucerne. In my district
(Merriwa-Cassilis, N.S.W.), there has
been a steady increase in the amount
sown, with the result that during the last
six years the average carrying capacity of
the whole district has improved 20 per
cent., while trucking of fat cattle and sheep
has almost doubled over any similar
earlier period. For instance, in 1900 (be-
lieved at the time to be a record), 4500
cattle and 29,000 fat sheep left the dis-
trict, while during the last six years the
trucking from Merriwa railway station
averaged over 10,000 fat cattle, and
120,000 fat sheep per year.
Some of those who have led in
planting large areas of grazing lucerne
are F. D. McMaster (Dalkeith), Thomas
Hogan (Brindley Park), Vincent brothers
(Pembroke), T. O’Brien (Green Arms),
J. R. Telpher (Bow Creek), W. S. Wood-
side (Dunlop), and A. B. Bettington
(Cootie). However, notwithstanding the
enterprise of these graziers, and many
others, it is safe to say that the lucerne
grazing era here has only just begun.
Old hands still believe that lucerne will
only thrive on the small alluvial flats,
where shallow-depth water is to be
found. Actually, it does well on suitable
hillsides and hilltops.
THE CHAIN SYSTEM.
“X. Slaught.”: As a link in the “chain”
in one of M.L.’s largest freezing works,
let me put my spoke in. Firstly, the
chain workers don’t do any more per
day than the equivalent number of com-
petent slaughtermen would do. Under
“go-as-you-please” methods they would
do more. The carcass is turned out no
better and no worse than under the old
style. The freezing cos. have the same
trouble with the chain worker as they
had with the slaughterman—in time.
There are too many anomalies.
For instance, the men taking off the
pelts have 100 per cent, more work to
do than any of the others, but receive
the same rate of pay, and their hands
knock up very quickly, owing to the ex-
cessive number they have to punch off.
No matter what work a man does, a
newchum, rung in as a substitute for an
exhausted worker, holds up the others
until he becomes competent. The method
of hooking the leg and “hanging off’
prior to sticking is bad.
Every carcass shows a bruised knuckle
on the catching leg —some worse than
others. Hard sheep are slummed be-
cause the worker has to do a difficult
carcass in exactly the same time as an
easy one —or stop the chain.
THE QUEENSLAND PIG INDUSTRY.
“Large White”: Mortality of young
porkers in Queensland is estimated at
over 62,000 annually, or 25 per cent, of
the pig population ; £lO,OOO worth of car-
casses are condemned each year at slaugh-
tering time owing to preventable diseases.
The total annual loss from these and
other causes may conservatively be set
down at £lOO,OOO.
To save some of this money the Pig
Industry Act shortly will operate. Noti-
fication of disease will be compulsory.
Piggeries will be subject to regular inspec-
tion for sanitation, etc. The main idea,
however, will be to spread knowledge
gained through scientific research and ex-
periment regarding breeding, feeding
and proper management, with especial
encouragement of more extensive grazing.
Evvard has proved that the pig which
gains weight most rapidly is the most
profitable one, making more weight per
pound of feed consumed as well as
maturing earlier, and also transmitting
these desirable traits to their progeny.
Systematic testing and certification as
practised in Denmark along the lines of
Evvard’s researches have increased
economy of feed consumption from 4|lb.
to of feed per pound of gain;
developed the average size of litters by
over two pigs, and raised the general
standard of carcasses enormously.
CARE OF FARM ENGINES.
“Cosine”: The main causes and cures
of farm-engine breakdowns are limited.
The use of a good canvas cover over the
engine, when not in use, would save a big
percentage of stoppages. The open-air
treatment so freely given to farm
machinery is the principal cause of curses
and blisters.
Many consider that a bag thrown over
the engine is good security, but bags let
the dirt and rain through, and hold them
there. Canvas tightens up, and is “water-

proofed” by rain ; also, it does not let the
dirt in.
Gross overloading causes a lot of
trouble. Many farmers are convinced
that an engine rated to develop, say,
2 h.p. can, at a stretch, give about 5 h.p.
Some salesmen even claim this marvel-
lous flexibility, get away with it and leave
the result to the repair mechanic and
posterity. Where only a fair margin of
safety on rated machine engine power is
allowed, the spare-part demand slumps
considerably.
Oil doesn’t worry some people—any
old liquid will suit them as a lubricant.
But engine parts under heavy strain deny
it with a cloud of blue smoke, or a
series of loud metallic bangs when snap-
ping takes place. Cheap or skimped oil
is poor economy.
PUTTING UP NETTING.
“Michael Prior”: Before erecting net-
ting unroll it and hang it for a while. Do
not try to stretch it higher than its own
height. To strain, weave a batten
through the mesh, and thus get an even
pull. Use a lath woven through to fasten
the netting to the posts in preference to
nailing. Dip in hot tar for underground
work. In fastening to a plain wire, a
piece of tie-wire here and there, twitched
round with a long, clean nail four times,
holds quite well. When unrolling it
saves time and temper to run the bar
through the centre and unwind the roll
from a frame —a couple of logs or
trestles—on the same principle as fencing
wire. Be careful not to crack the gal-
vanising.
SKIM-MILK VALUE.
“Jack Point”: As a result of research
and experiment extending over several
years past at Ohio Experiment Station and
Cornell University, U.S.A., vitamin G has
been definitely identified as the vitamin
which controls not only the growth of the
young bird or animal, but also of the liv-
ing embryo during its period of incuba-
tion. Eggs laid by hens fed a ration lack-
ing this vitamin gave hatchability as low
as 2 p.c., whilst young chicks similarly
fed failed to make one quarter of the
growth of that made by controls fed a
ration in which the vitamin was present.
The main sources of supply of the
growth vitamin are beef and pork livers,
dried yeast and milk. Being water-sol-
uble, none is removed from milk with the
cream, so that skim milk actually con-
tains a larger percentage than whole milk.
Heating the milk up to fairly high tem-
peratures does not affect it.
It has been well known always that
skim milk possesses feeding value far in
excess of that indicated by its analysis,
and its high vitamin content undoubtedly
explains this. Cereals are poor in vita-
min G, and meatmeal contains only
limited amounts. The man who pins his
faith to skim milk in the raising of young
’uns, especially chicks, is on the right
track.

in lgal. of rain water and then adding 4gal. of
cold water. Different varieties require dif-
ferent strengths of lye; the best com-
pletes its work in 48 hours. This process
should be conducted in a dark room, as the
light turns the olives brown. After 24 hours
test the fruit by taking a few olives out of the
lye and cutting them transversely. It is easy
to see by the bright yellow color how far the
lye has penetrated. When the lye has not
penetrated, the white pulp is seen in a ring.
(The bitterness having gone, the lye is drawn off
* and is replaced by pure water, which is re-
newed at frequent intervals the first day and
then two or three times a day for a week until
the alkaline, the bitterness and the coloring
matters have been discharged. Next procedure
is to soak the olives in brine made by dissolv-
ing 4oz. of salt in lgal. of water. After a week
the strength of brine should be doubled. To
give bite some cloves, cinnamon or other spice
may be added. The spice should be pounded
and boiled for some minutes while the salt is
being dissolved for the second lot of brine.
When cool, the liquid should be strained and
poured over the edible olives. Caustic potash
should be handled with great care.

A WEEKLY PRIZE FOR A HINT.
Hints for farmers have always been a popular
feature of the Man on the Land Page, and the
little volume of them published by The
Bulletin has had a wide sale.
Lately, the supply appears to have dried up
somewhat, and in order to encourage a re-
newal of the flow The Bulletin has decided
to offer a regular weekly prize.
In addition to space rates, which will be
paid for all hints published, £1 Is. will be paid
for the best hint of the week.
Hints should not exceed 100 words in length.
Every land man has some method or con-
trivance about his place calculated to make
work easier or farming more profitable. Give
the other chap a chance to benefit by your
experience through the Man on the Land Page.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Tenrag”: A safe way of taking up the
slack of a loose barbed wire without
danger to the hands: With pliers, catch
hold of the wire between the barbs and
give a half-turn. Do this along the panel
until the wire is tight enough. Barbed
wire in a fence treated in this way will
keep taut for ages, unless it is interfered
with by stock or the posts rot out.
“Maurice”: Hessian may be water-
proofed with a mixture of tar and lime.
Heat a kerosene-tin three-quarters full of
tar until near boiling point, then stir in
gradually enough powdered lime (air-
slaked is best) to make a creamy mixture.
When it froths it is ready to use and
will give a surface like black enamel.
Apply the mixture hot with a tar brush.
Hessian thus treated will last for years.
If made a little thicker, by adding more
lime, the preparation can be used for re-
pairing tanks, etc. Spread it over the de-
fective part, cover with a piece of hes-
sian, and apply a good coating over all.
“W.P.T.”: Hay tea is a pick-me-up for a
tired horse. Fill a kerosene-tin with fresh
hay and pour in as much boiling water as
the tin will hold. Leave it for 20 minutes
and then pour the water off. Add enough
cold water to make a little over a gallon
and administer when thoroughly cool. To
a horse it is as refreshing as a glass of
beer is to a man.
“Tenrag”: To compute the cubic con-
tents of a sloping dam or ensilage pit:
(1) Multiply top length by breadth ; mul-
tiply bottom length by breadth. Add the
products together. (2) Add top length
to bottom length. Add top breadth to
bottom breadth and multiply these pro-
ducts together. (3) Add together the
totals obtained in (1) and (2) and multi-
ply the result by depth (or height, as the
case may be), and divide product by
two.
“Small Holder”: Recently I marketed
stock in two consignments. One lot went
in the cool of the evening the day prior
to the sale, and the other on sale morn-
ing. Ages and quality were the same,
but the arrivals in the cool returned 10
per cent, better price. The auctioneer
said his records showed that all stock,
from poultry to horses, brought better
figures when yarded in the cool, espe-
cially pigs and calves, which feel the
heat. All saleyards will accept consign-
ments the evening before. That tip paid
commission for me.
“Cockyson”: A new post or a new set
of rails has to be put in a split-rail fence.
Having dug the hole, mortised your post
and tenoned the rails, which must be
perfectly fitted, cut away the tenons from
the under side to about half their depth,
taking care to leave the shoulders full.
Then slip the rails lightly into the mor-
tises of the posts already supporting a
rail or set of rails. Place a paling over
the open post-hole and stand post to go
into it on paling. Hoist free ends of the
partly-erected rails into position, insert
the rails into the mortises, and then pull
away the paling from beneath the post.
It is impossible to slip a rail so fitted
without first lifting out the post.
“Salum”: An effective and lasting cure
for the fence-jumping cow is to pierce her
eartips, tying the ears together lightly
with a thin piece of rawhide. No Daisy
will jump any fence with this adornment
fitted. The reason is simple. Every
animal pricks its ears before jumping—
if they are tied, it can’t.
THIS WEEK’S PRIZE HINT.
This week’s prize of £1 Is. for a hint
has been won by H. A. LEE,
Ridgemere, Nanango (Q-): —
I feed 62 poddies in 16 minutes with
this plant: Section a 10ft. 6in. 20-
gauge galvanised-iron trough ( I Oin.
diam.) into 18in. compartments, each
sloping from trough top on one side
to sin. from the bottom on the other.
At each end of trough rivet on a 1 in.
iron axle fitted into holes in posts
to allow the trough to swing. Put a
milk vat with feed tap at one end.
The milk flows over sloping divisions
when tap is opened. On one trough
end fit a lever to tilt or straighten the
apparatus and regulate supply. The
trough can be overturned when
cleaned to dry or to be hosed out.
It can be used with calf or other bails.

Gold
In 1925 Australia’s total mineral pro-
duction Was £24,592,000, of which gold
accounted for £2,375,000. In 1933 the
value of all minerals won was approxi-
mately £12,000,000 in Australian cur-
rency, gold representing £6,432,500. The
gold yield last year was 830,000 fine
ounces, an increase of about 116,000
ounces compared with 1932, and a jump
of 270,812 ounces from the 1925 figure.
Though last year’s yield by weight was
only 49 p.c. greater than in 1925, its
value in Australian currency was 170
p.c. higher. That is because the average
price realised last year for the yellow
metal was £7 15s. Australian per ounce,
as against £4 4s. when we were on
the gold standard. The position of the
industry is even more favorable than that.
Goods—coal, food, chemicals, etc. —
which cost mineowners £162 in 1925
now cost only about £l3O. With gold
at present over £8 10s. an ounce in
Australian money—which means two
Australian pounds for one golden sov-
ereign—further improvement in mining
results is assured.
But Australia’s production of the
wealth-measuring substance nowadays is
merely a drop in the world’s bucket.
Before the discoveries in the Spanish
Main the world’s supply of gold came
chiefly from the mines of Saxony, Spain
and Austria. From 1823 to 1848 Russia
was the chief producer. In ’49 California
took the lead ; and the Californian rush
led to the Australian finds in ’52. Then,
until 1893, the U.S.A. and Australia vied
for first place ; with Russia they were
responsible for 87 p.c. of the world’s
output. The Witwatersrand was dis-
covered in 1885, and since 1898, except
during the Boer War, S’Africa has been
the world’s chief producer.
Between 1493 and 1850 the world’s
gold production was 153 million fine
ounces. From 1851 to 1900 334 million
ounces was mined. Between 1901 and
1932 621 million ounces —56 p.c. of the
world’s total recorded gold production—
was won! A record output was
reached in 1932, after a heavy decline in
the post-war period. In spite of this
enormous increase in stocks during
recent years the metal is now dearer in
terms of sterling than it has ever been.
This high price, of course, is stimulating
production, but lower-grade ore is being
milled, and the 1932 peak production of
fine gold may not be greatly exceeded
when complete 1933 figures are available.
There is no scarcity of gold in the
world generally to warrant the present
high price of the metal. There is an
abundance of it, though not such as to
justify a return to the old price of
£4 4s. Maldistribution and misuse
are responsible for the low commodity
prices, which is another way of saying
that gold is high. In 1933 approximately
70 p.c. of the world’s monetary stocks
was held by U.S.A., France, Belgium,
Holland and Switzerland ; the rest of the
world, including Britain and the British
Empire, was off the gold standard, and
had to get along on 30 p.c.
Although still the largest repository
for the world’s gold, America continues
to bid up for the metal, and, her cur-
rency being overvalued in the foreign
exchanges, there is a steady flow of bul-
lion across the Atlantic away from
Europe. The present supply of gold, pro-
perly distributed, is quite adequate to
support a stable level of prices; but
those countries which possess it, par-
ticularly the U.S.A., have used it in
national instead of international interests,
making the world’s economic confusion
worse confounded.
The present premium on gold is partly
artificial, especially when expressed in
terms of other commodities. Mainly
because of the inflation caused by a
costly war, it is not likely that Britain
will stabilise her currency with 123 stan-
dard grains in the sovereign. Colin
Fraser, of the Australian Mines and
Metals Association, last week suggested
a new sterling parity of not less than
£6 10s. an ounce, as against £4 4s. lUd.
at present. The mining industry would
benefit from such a devaluation until
costs came into equilibrium with the new
gold parity of the currency. One of the
effects which economists hope for from
devaluation and world-wide stabilisation
is a rise in commodity prices, and that
would mean less-profitable gold-mining.
Company Law Reform
The N.S.W. Companies Act is to be
amended, Mr. Stevens says, in the direc-
tion of protecting investors against mush-
room and bogus companies. If things
were rightly ordered this protection would
be afforded by a Commonwealth Act,
but the people have repeatedly refused to
give the Commonwealth express authority
to deal with company law, the last occa-
sion being that of Bruce’s 1926 referen-
dum. There were then quite a few high
commercial interests which didn’t want
company-law reform ; they included sub-
sidiaries of overseas holding cos. not at
all anxious to let the public know how
much money they were making in Aus-
tralia.
Failing a Commonwealth Act, the
best we can hope for is up-to-
date and more or less standardised State
legislation. In N. S. Wales the moth-
eaten law that governs the promotion,
constitution and conduct of companies
and their affairs is possibly the most in-
adequate in the British Empire. It
dates from 1899, and is based on the
original English Act of 1862, which intro-
duced the limited-liability system to the
world.
Company control is slipshod in N. S.
Wales, South Australia and Westralia ;
“Been in every prurry shop in te town to-day and can’t get what I want.”
“What did you want, Henare?”
“Tick.”
not so bad in Queensland, Vic. and Tas-
mania. Company-law tightening should
aim at protecting the public from go-
getters, the introduction of a special sec-
tion covering all types of investment con-
tracts other than shares and life policies
—with particular reference to forestry
bonds —and increasing the powers of
shareholders to call directors to account.
Door-to-door canvassing by share- and
bond-salesmen should be made illegal.
Publication of separate or aggregate
balance sheets of subsidiaries ought to be
made incumbent upon all holding cos.
Every shareholder, whether preference or
ordinary, should be given the right of
access to annual accounts. Voting power
amongst shares of a certain class should
be on a one-share-one-vote principle.
There are enterprises called insurance
offices from which The Bulletin and
policy-holders have been unable to
obtain balance sheets. All companies,
public or private, should be compelled
to file annual accounts with the Registrar-
General. This particularly in respect of
bond-issuing and life-assurance concerns.
There is one merit in the N. S. Wales
Companies Act; what there is of it is
easy to understand. This is not the case
with Bankruptcy, Income Tax and many
of Lang’s Acts, which are a boon to the
legal profession.
Idle Men and Idle Money
“F.G.’s” opinion from the Speck:
“King D.” (B. 17/1 / ’34) claims that Gov-
ernment can do much to assist re-employment.
He says: “It can do something that the banks
cannot legitimately do: finance new private
industrial undertakings.” Surely he isn’t seri-
ous? Would he entrust such handing out of
public money to politicians—say, to Lang or
Theodore?
In the same par. he points out that one
obstacle in the way of recovery is heavy taxa-
tion. It is the greatest obstacle, and perhaps
the only one. New industries are needed, and,
given the right conditions, all the money neces-
sary will be forthcoming without Government
assistance.
Power alcohol from sugar-waste and pota-
toes; paper pulp and cellulose; low-grade-de-
posit gold-mining; extraction of oil from
coal; shale-oil; fishmeal and fertiliser from our
tropical waters —these are only a few of a host
of industries that should be in full swing. In
most cases, however, large capital expenditure,
plus research and experiment, is necessary be-
fore production commences; and the industry
which appears to be sound to-day may become
a hopeless washout when taxation and other
burdens (such as arbitration awards) are im-
posed to suit political ends.
Reduce taxation, allow essential machinery
to be imported duty-free (in many cases patent
rights alone prevent its economic manufacture
in Australia), and when the capital invested
amounts to a reasonable figure give the com-
pany a definite undertaking that taxation and
protective duties will remain at fixed figures for
21 years, and much of the idle money in our
banks will be put to work.
Colin Fraser, addressing shareholders
in Aust. Mines and Metals last week,
said that world-wide inflation, which
commenced long before the war, had
raised costs while the price of gold re-
mained stable, and forced out many of
the weaker mines. He attributed the
present high price of gold to the deprecia-
tion of the paper currencies offered in
exchange for it, and said that few would
care to predict a strengthening in the
price of this paper. That is only part of
the story. To-day the sterling com-
modity-price index is around the 1913
level, when the gold industry was pros-
pering at £4 4s. ll|d. an ounce. Gold,
in terms of sterling, is now 64 p.c. over
the pre-war price. The truth is that at
present we are having a gold boom,
whereas in 1920-25, when gold produc-
tion was unprofitable, we had a com-
modity boom. It is the relation between
commodity prices, other costs and the
price of the metal that decides whether
gold-mining is to be profitable or other-
wise.

Hong Kong’s Advertising and Pub-
licity Bureau—one of the biggest con-
cerns of its kind in Asia—recently sent its
manager to the Commonwealth, and fol-
lowing the visit has issued a booklet de-
voted to trade development in South
China and Malaya in particular. Hong
Kong and Singapore between them are
the clearing houses for £250,000,000
worth of goods p.a. even under present
depressed conditions ; but it is pointed
out that the ability of any country to
share in this trade depends on an accu-
rate knowledge of local requirements
and prejudices, and the employment of
local publicity advisers who understand
selling to the natives and Orientals.
China, says the booklet, is becoming
Westernised in its buying methods, and
the next decade will see the area between
the Straits and Fukien province—popula-
tion 126,000,000—a field for keen Euro-
pean, Australian and American competi-
tion, with the spoils in proportion to the
skill in marketing.

The British Post Office has developed
a new type of telephone in which the
insanitary mouthpiece is done away
with and the instrument is enclosed in a
cabinet like a baby radio-set. It “will be
available to the British public later in the
year.” And to Australians, no doubt, in
time for them to ring up and book seats
for the Sounding of the Last Trump
ceremony. And they will be privileged
(as with the last “new” instruments) to
buy the gadgets and instal them as
presents to the P.M.G.

“C.M.J.L.”: A gentleman drew up at a
Victorian farmer’s residence, his Ford
loaded with Persian rugs. They were
worth £2O each, he said, but being
urgently in need of cash he would sell six
at £lO each. The farmer bought. Next
day. a prosperous-looking stranger in-
quiring about property values dropped
in. The conversation turned to rugs;
the farmer exhibited his purchases, the
caller being lost in admiration. “Worth
at least £20,” he said. “I’ll give you that
for them myself, and for any more you
can get. I’ll call back in a week and
pick up the lot.” Next day re-enters the
man with the Ford with more rugs. The
farmer bought another half-dozen at
£lO each. He is now in possession of
12 rugs worth about £2 each, and waits
in vain for the second man to turn up.
* * * *
“Crops”: The Australian cattleman is
used to having it jambed down his throat
that British beef is immeasurably superior
to anything produced in the “colonies.”
C. F. G. McCann, S. Australia’s
trade commissioner in Britain and a meat
expert, says that high-grade home-grown
beef is almost unprocurable in Britain,
and specially cites a Christmas fat-stock
sale in the South of England. Of the 200
animals paraded, not more than six in
the steer-beef class were up to the stan-
dard of first-grade imported meat, and
in this opinion McCann was backed by
the buyers. There is in England an over-
supply of poorly bred animals, and these
are preventing the man who breeds care-
fully and scientifically from getting a
proper value for his product. Many of
the farmers don’t try to supply the market
with the type of beef it is asking for. It
is these casual folk who have recently
been whining to the Government to pro-
tect them from the consequences of their
laziness and ineptitude by restricting the
importation of the better Dominion meat.
H= * * *
“Mako”: Maoriland, which has been
for some years perturbed over the down-
hill path of the flax industry, has great
hopes in a new process discovered by R.
Coghill, of Dunedin, by which the harsh
fibre of the native plant is rendered soft
and pliable, and eminently suitable for
sacks and woolpacks. Semple, M.P., is
encouraging the project, and Foxton is
to have the factory. At present M.L.
presents India with something like a half-
million a year for jute.

“Q.Q.”: Electra House, London,
which was built by the cable companies
in a mood of undue optimism before the
war, was recently the scene of the latest
wireless miracle—transmission by micro-
ray. The power required is no more
than that required for a pocket torch,
and the aerials are only three inches long.
Messages can be sent and received simul-
taneously, and teleprinters can be worked

individual communication nearer ; citi-
zens may soon be able to walk around
with radio-telephones in their pockets.

NORTH OF

The Man for New Guinea
“Gain”: “Fi. f a .” (B. 7/l/’34) can
scarcely be serious when he suggests that,
because an Administrator of the Man-
dated Territory runs a risk (in common
with every other public servant there) of
contracting tropical diseases “as a result
of ignorance of elementary rules of
health protection in the tropics,” he
should be a medical man. If that argu-
ment holds, the whole civil service should
be medical men, too. But it doesn’t hold ;
and if eleven Administration doctors and
six others who serve the population of
New Guinea can’t drum a few simple
precautions into the head of the local
Governor and tend him when sick, then
they should be sacked.
“Fi. fa.” accuses me of discarding
British precedents and of “never having
heard of Sir William MacGregor.”
Where are the British precedents? Mac-
Gregor, whom I knew well, was more
or less an accident, but it wasn’t his
medicine which made him a great
Administrator. He never called himself
an anthropologist or aired any theories.
Moreover, though he had to delegate
his authority, there is no instance which
I know of his handing district adminis-
trative duties to a medico. He had faith
in three qualifications—strength, tact and
honesty. Leonard Wood, who is men-
tioned as a medical
Governor, was a
general in the
U.S.A. army and
had completely for-
gotten his medical
days. He was sent
to the Philippines
because they
needed a strong or-
ganising hand and
a capable military
leader. Doctors
were sent out by
the Germans occa-
sionally, but only
when the job was
so small as to call
for limitation of de-
partmental heads.
They got their
training as part of
a gruelling special
tropical - adminis-
tration course
which was their
paramount qualifi-
cation. In spite of
them, the only
man who left a
real name and
mark on the M.T.
was Bulowinski,
and he was no
doctor.
The rest of “Fi. fa.’s” advocacy can
be left to speak for itself. In tone it
reads more like an advertisement for a
patent medicine than a recital of the
qualifications of somebody for a digni-
fied and important position, and some of
the facts cited don’t coincide with those
in “Who’s Who.”
As for Mr. Payne, whom I suggested
as the type of Administrator wanted—
though I made it clear that he would
scarcely be available—“Fi. fa.” does not
know his onions or he would not place
any medical candidate available within a
thousand yards of him.
I should make it clear that I made no
attack on Dr. Cilento. He has given
excellent medical service in comparatively
junior positions, and he is one of the
finest speakers in Australia. It is no re-
flection on him to say that he is not
qualified by experience or otherwise to
hold the most difficult and important
gubernatorial job in Oceania.
Doing Time in the ’Nineties
“Old Lag”: News that a son of Sub-
Inspector Carroll has been given the posi-
tion of Commissioner of Q’land Police
wakes memories of Blackall Gaol, where
the new Commissioner was born (his dad
was in charge of the lock-up in the nearly
’nineties, when it was a home from home
for prisoners serving sentences of any-
thing up to 12 months —over that stretch
they went to Rockhampton). The Royal
Hotel was just across the road from the
lock-up. A warder, if there was one
about, never objected to a prisoner keep-
ing one down with a friend from the
bush. At odd times they’d keep more
than one down and come back to
the gaol to sober up. Occasionally a
prisoner might be invited to stay to
dinner. But that was a breach of etiquette
—the lag had to feed with his mates from
the prison trough.
A few hundred yards up the paddock
from the gaol there used to be a hut in
which saddlery work was done—when
there was a saddler among those serving
their time. I’ve put in many pleasant
half-hours with a prisoner-saddler work-
ing without supervision, with occasional
strolls across to the Royal. That saddler
fellow —I forget his name now —was as
good company as I’ve ever met, in gaol
or out.
A couple of mules, Moses and Aaron,
were attached to the police station. Any
old time a prisoner would be sent with
those brothers in a dray to cart water
from the Barcoo. There was no bore
then, and water wasn’t laid on to the
town. At other times, nominally under the
care of a black-tracker, Moses, Aaron,
a prisoner and a dray would be sent bush
to cart firewood. If the tracker wasn’t
too bumptious we’d give him a hand to
load the wood. If his red braid went to
his head he could load the lot himself
while the “hard laborer” smoked his pipe
at ease.
I wonder if the new Commissioner re-
members the old gaol, and, if so, has the
same kindly feeling towards it which I
have?
Randolph Bedford, M.L.A., who re-
cently brought an action for £20,000
damages against Brisbane “Telegraph,”
has been granted a new trial by a two-
to-one majority of Queensland’s Full

Court. The “Telegraph” is to pay costs
of the appeal to the F.C., but those of
the first trial are to abide the event.
Respondents have been granted a stay
of proceedings pending an appeal to the
High Court.

From Mrs. A. J. Crowther, president
of the North Queensland Country
Women’s Association:
There have been so many inquiries follow-
ing The Bulletin’s review of Mrs. Black’s
“Queensland Pioneers” (B. 20/12/’33) that we
should be grateful if you could save duplicate
correspondence by asking those who need it to
write direct to the C.W.A., Stanlcy-street,
Townsville. The whole proceeds of the book
are being used to establish the North Queens-
land Women Pioneers’ Memorial Home. The
price is 7s. 6d., plus sd. postage.
* * * *
“Rankine”: The Barkly Tableland has
been suffering for a year from a rat
plague. Thousands are to be seen along
the tracks of an evening, and 100 in the
station traps between dusk and daylight
is a moderate capture. They belong to a
kangaroo species and nothing seems to be
safe from their teeth. Anybody who can
suggest a way of dealing with them will
earn the full gratitude of Territorians,
who have enough to worry them already
in the monsoon season without being
eaten out of house and home.
* * * *
“Saurian Bill”: Somebody in North
Queensland has been ridiculing a report
that a prospector has seen a crocodile in
a quiet waterhole on the Upper Burdekin,
not far from Charters Towers. The con-
tention is that falls prevent the passage
inland of the pests. Anybody who builds
on that theory is in the running for a
bad nip. In a dry season I have met —
to our mutual embarrassment —a croc,
in a quiet billabong 20 miles from a
river, and, as they can travel overland
like a goanna and about twice as fast, a
few impediments in a river are not likely
to stop them. They usually stick to the
broader coastal reaches of the rivers pro-
bably only because there are better pick-
ings there.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: That promoter who was
refused permission to borrow Queensland
abos. for show purposes in Melbourne
might have better luck if he tried the
Commonwealth Government. The War-
ramunga tribe of myalls near Tennant’s
Creek (N.T.) is in the way of gold pros-
pectors, and is to be asked to vote at a
referendum to decide whether its mem-
bers are agreeable to allow themselves
to be transferred to another part of the
Territory! Such a scheme at once con-
demns Canberra as being completely
ignorant of the abo. A myall is just as
apt to say “No more” as “Yowai” to any
question, and to reverse his answer the
next second.
* * * *
“NXT”: News has come through that
one of the Caledon Bay Peace Mission,
which the Commonwealth is subsidising,
has been speared through the leg, and
if the Commonwealth doesn’t stop its
operations somebody is likely to get
stuck even more dangerously. Arnhem
Land is a native reserve, and Groote
Eylandt should be added to it. All that
is wanted to save the region from being
a nuisance to the whites is to keep the
whites out of it. The remnant of
indigenous Australians who still exist
have a right to at least one small corner
of this continent which they can call their
own. Instead of this, however, the Gov-
ernment’s policy seems to be more and
more missionaries.
* * * *
“El V.”: Bethania Junction (Q.) the
other day celebrated the 60th anniver-
sary of the founding of its Lutheran
church and the 70th birthday of German
settlement in the district. Six of the
original pioneers were present, mingling
with four generations of Australians who
have sprung from the first settlers. The
German colonists have been good citizens
both on the Queensland South Coast
and in the Moreton district. They mainly
selected scrub country which called for
almost unimaginable hardship in its
clearing, but to-day they form some of
the most prosperous and law-abiding
communities in the Commonwealth, and
their votes control half a dozen State
electorates. During the war their dis-
tricts gave many Diggers to the A.I.F.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: I wonder that the Common-
wealth does not do something to stimu-
late manufacturing of simple Australian
necessities in Papua and the Mandated
Territory, where the native has a good
deal of technical adaptability. Simple
wood-turning and weaving suggest them-
selves. If the white Australian manufac-
turer doesn’t want to get into these in-
dustries, it would be better to have our
own cheap labor producing them than
somebody else’s, provided the capital em-
ployed were Australian, the supervisory
part of the work in the hands of our own
people and the materials used either local
or from the Commonwealth.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Cupid, as usual, worked overtime on the
beaches during the holidays, and there is a
healthy crop of engagements. June brides
should bloom in overwhelming numbers. The
latest contracting parties include Elizabeth Eich-
mann, the pretty dark-eyed daughter of A.
Eichmann, of Lota, and Roy Reid, only son
of Mr. and Mrs. E. A. S. Reid, of Hendra.
Sylvia Shepherd also is filling her glory box
before meeting Reg Hall, of Calen, at the altar.
May Powney, of Stanthorpe, wears a new
sparkler on her left hand, placed there by
Gordon Wilson, of the same town. Smiling,
fair-haired Joan Ferguson, only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. P Ferguson, of Clayfield, marries
Cynl Powell at the Albert-street Methodist
Church on Feb. 19, and Marie Baker, daughter
of the late Rev. E. and of Mrs. Baker, of
Gatton, has said O.K. or something to William
Jackson, a personable young man with many
acres who hails from St. George way.
News arrived this week of a recent Singa-
pore wedding which will interest both Brisbane
folk and Sydneysiders. The bridegroom, Eric
Christian Tommerup, is a Brisbane boy. The
bride. Gladys Parry, is a daughter of the late
W. A. Parry, of Ashfield (N.S.W,), and Mrs.
Parry. Eric Christian holds down the interesting
job of soils officer to Dunlops at Malacca. Bride
wore white organdie, and carried a bouquet of
Christmas lilies. A wide-brimmed white hat
showed two fascinating dips above her curly
hair. Mrs. J. S. Dunn, of Johol Estate, Tampin,
was matron of honor, and W. S. Roe, of Batic
Anam, was bottle-holder for the ’groom. The
’groom did his course with the Forestry Service
in Queensland, and then studied further in
Sydney and at Rothqjnsted.
Fred Snelling, son of the T. A. Snellings, of
Ascot, is wearing a complacent smile since
Ruth McLennan accepted an engagement ring
from him. Ruth will be making her home near
Winton.
Anyway, a life in the bush doesn’t mean that
one s career will be cut short in the late thirties
or early forties, as so many city women seem
to think. Witness Mrs. J. O. Kennedy, a pioneer
of the Bulloo, who celebrated her 80th birthday
the other day. The blacks ran wild when she
first went out to South Comongin (s.-western
Queensland), and on one occasion she and her
children spent a terrifying few days with abos.
hemming in their little cottage. Kennedy and
his stockmen arrived and the abos. vanished.
Miles of rough country stretched between this
young wife and the nearest white woman, and
the quickest mode of transit was by horse team
or buggy. Like so many other fine pioneer
women, Mrs. Kennedy enjoyed the bush life,
and reared a family of westerners who are a
credit to Queensland.
Many years ago there was a very old lady
whose sister was the bride of that Connolly
who was known as the “Father of Gayndah,”
and who lived to see his 103rd birthday. The
very old lady refused to mention her brother-
in-law without a sniff. “I have never forgiven
him,” said she icily, “for putting my sister into
a bullock waggon at the church door and taking
her all the way from Sydney to the Darling
Downs.” Perhaps it was an uncomfortable
journey, but it had no ill-effect on the bride,
who was very nearly 90 when she crossed the
big Divide.
Haunters of eisteddfodau require no intro-
duction to Eileen and Evel Burns, two pianists
who had a habit of annexing not only solo
events, but medals for sight-reading, pianoforte
duets and other little things. Eileen, who is
Mrs. Deighton now, has been appointed official
accompanist for the big eisteddfod at Easter.
The lady, at 14 years of age, had the right to
add L.T.C.L. to her name, so budding singers
need not be afraid that she will “ruin” their
songs. Evel is off to London.
Edna Barbour, younger daughter of G. P.
Barbour, of the Toowoomba Grammar School,
has been appointed sports mistress of St. Mar-
garet’s Church of England School, Brisbane.
Edna, like all the family, inherited a love of
sport from her father, the veteran cricketer.
One of Toowoomba’s most recent brides is
just back from Asia. She was a Walton
Kent, one of those pretty, slender girls who
look so well on horseback and who take blue
ribbons at every show. She is now Mrs. G. H.
Griffith, and her husband is a member of that
Toowoomba family which owns the foundry.
Mrs. Stanley Hobson, Mrs. E. A. Gill and
Mrs. Gerard Boyce, all notable hostesses, were
members of the Griffith clan.
W. A. Baird last week flew to and from
Mt. Isa, a distance of 2200 miles, in two days,
piloting a sick woman, Mrs. A. Ely, whose
recovery depended on immediate transfer to
Brisbane. Baird gathered up Nurse E. Horn,
Mrs. Ely’s sister, in Brisbane on Saturday
morning, and landed at Mt. Isa at 6 p.m.
Ambulance bearers brought the patient to the
Mt. Isa landing field at daybreak the next
morning, and, stopping only at Roma and
Longreach for fuel, she was landed safely in
Brisbane at 6 o’clock the same evening. The long
air journey did the patient no harm; indeed,
she seemed better on arriving in Brisbane than
she was at starting. Baird’s new De Havilland
arrives from England next week. This ’plane
is fitted with special stretcher accommodation,
as the pilot has so often been called on to trans-
port stretcher cases from distant centres. It
will be berthed at Archerfield, so that it will
be available as soon as Qantas gets an SOS
from the north or west.
Queensland Diggers are opening a “Last Post
Fund,” to provide honorable burial for all ex-
Imperial or other soldiers (of the Allied nations)
who have settled in Queensland and who die
in poverty. The R.S.S.I.L.A. has always seen
to it that such men were saved from a pauper’s
grave, but its funds are raised really to com-
bat distress among the living, and its care
for overseas fighting comrades has meant a very
heavy drain on its resources. So the public
now is to be given a chance to help, and the
G.-G. and our own Sir Leslie Wilson are lend-
ing the scheme their hearty support.
Monday, Feb. 12, saw the wedding of Frank
Deshon’s son Leslie (Frank was on Mitchell
Downs for 34 years, and was one of the best-
loved men in the district) to Florence Isley,
of Eagle Junction. The Deshon and Ewart and
Isley clans gathered in full strength for the
affair. The baby daughter of the Deshon family
will be a bride in the near future, and her
husband-to-be is one of the Douglas family
who held Mt. Maria for a long time.

Particulars of last year’s motor-boat contest
for the British international trophy ? —52.
The racing was conducted at Detroit on Sep-
tember 2 and 4. The trophy, presented by Lord
Northcliffe in 1903, has been in the hands of
the American, Gar Wood, since 1920. Last
year he again proved victorious with Miss
America X. The challenger, H. Scott-Paine’s
Miss Britain 111, is 24ft. 6in. long, with a Napier
engine of 1375 b.p.h. She developed a max.
speed of 85.789 m.p.h. in the contest. Miss
America X is 38ft. long, has four Packard
engines totalling nearly 7000 b.h.p., and de-
veloped a max. speed of 86.937 m.p.h.
Does the Australian Government hold golden
sovereigns equivalent to the note issue or gold
in any form ? —B.
The note issue is under the control of the
Commonwealth Bank. In terms of the Com-
monwealth Bank Act the board of the bank
must hold gold or sterling to the value of
18 p.c. of the notes on issue during the year
ending June 30 next. A return issued January
29 showed note circulation £47,300,958 and
gold and English sterling held £14,507,537. The
reserve was thus 30.67 p.c. The balance sheet
shows other assets, some of which could be
quickly converted to gold or sterling if neces-
sity arose.
I have a block of land in Sydney across
which some three years ago the council erected
an electric main, although there is a road along
which it could have been taken. (1) Can 1
compel the council to remove it ? (2) Can I
stop the council cutting down and lopping trees
on my property which are growing under it,
and which are wholly on my ground ? (3) If
so, how should I act ? —2O.
(1) The N.S.W. Local Government Act gives
a council power to enter on any land and take
temporary possession of it, and use it for the
carrying out of any works or undertakings. (2)
Where damage is shown to have been done the
council must make compensation. (3) You
cannot compel it to remove the main, and
where the roots of trees are growing under it
the council may cut them out.
(1) Approximate amount spent on dole relief
in Australia by national and municipal authori-
ties in the last three years ? (2) How much
would it cost to unify the railway gauges of
Australia ? —9821.
(1) Government expenditure was approximately
£34,000,000. Amount spent by municipalities
is not ascertainable, but as most of it was pro-
vided out of Government subsidy it is not a
very important item. (2) A Royal Commission
in 1921 estimated the cost at £57,200,000.
Particulars of the Queensland Authors and
Artists’ Assoc.’s short-story competition ? —6B.
A first prize of £5 ss. will be awarded, and
if entries are sufficient a second prize of £2 2s.
The story must be original, written by residents
of Australasia, must have an Australian or M.L.
setting, and must not exceed 5000 words in
length. It must be typed and signed with a
pen-name, and the pen-name and the real name
of the writer must accompany the story in a
sealed envelope. Members of the association
may enter free; others must enclose 2s. 6d.
entrance fee. Entries close March 31, 1934,
and should be addressed “Short Story Compe-
tition,” care J. V. D. Coutts, Kodak Building,
Queen-street, Brisbane.
(1) Does the N. S. Wales Education Dept,
keep a record of intermediate and leaving cer-
tificate passes ? (2) If a person lost his certifi-
cate could he get another ? (3) In applying
for a Government position wherein an inter-
mediate certificate is necessary, do the authori-
ties accept the certificate as sufficient evidence,
or do they apply to the Education Dept, for
verification ? —24.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes, on payment of a search
fee. (3) Asa rule an authenticated copy of the
certificate is accepted in the first instance. The
candidate might later be required to produce
the original document.
(1) What children are eligible for enrolment
in the Blackfriars Correspondence School, con-
ducted by the N.S.W. Education Dept. ? (2)
How is the work carried out ? —B2.
(1) Children between the ages of seven and
fifteen years who reside not fewer than three
miles from the nearest school (and who are
unable to attend an existing school with the
aid of the department’s subsidy) are supplied
with stationery and books free of cost, and
stamps are provided for the return of papers
worked by the pupils. Regular instalments of
work are sent out, and the children, under the
supervision of parents, are required to prepare
and write out the lessons set by their teacher.
The work is then returned to the correspond-
ence teacher, who corrects it, comments upon
it, and gives such written instructions as will
enable the pupil to master the difficulties which
he has met. The school has to rely on some-
one in the home to see that instructions are
carried out.
How can a nurse qualify for enrolment on
the General Register of the Vic. Nurses’ Board
or for membership of the Royal Victorian
Trained Nurses’ Association ? What educa-
tional qualifications must she possess, and from
whom are full particulars obtainable? —88.
She must have completed a course of train-
ing of not less than three years in a recognised
hospital or hospitals containing over 40 daily
occupied beds (a longer term is required in
smaller hospitals). Candidates must be edu-
cated to, at least, the standard of the certi-
ficate of merit (preferably higher), and before
being registered must hold a certificate lor
invalid cooking from the Education Dept, or a
recognised cookery school. This can be obtained
before entering the hospital. Particulars from
the Registrar, Nurses’ Board, 352 Collins-street,
or the secretary, R.V.T.N.A., Equitable Bldg.,
Collins-street, Melbourne.
Is it correct to leave cards when returning a
first call ? —33.
Yes, if the visit is very formal and if the
people called upon are likely to expect them.
The use of visiting cards has almost vanished
in Australia, especially in country parts.
(1) How is oil extracted from hallu leaves ?
(2) Could a man make a reasonable wage pre-
paring the oil ? (3) Is it easy to sell ? (4)
Is the raw product as good as the refined oil
as an embrocation? —9991.
(1) Bulletin No. 4, obtainable from Techno-
logical Museum, Harris-street, Sydney, 6d., gives
details. (2) Yes, in the right locality. (3) Yes.
(4) Probably, but it would be difficult to per-
suade the public to that effect.
I have an upstairs verandah, 20 ft. x 25 ft.,
with wooden floor, in a Sydney coastal area.
What 'plants would you recommend as suitable
to grow there, and how should they be culti-
vated ? —llO.
Cover the floor where the plants are to
stand with sheet lead or galvanised iron, and
paint it to match the wooden floor —this will
be protection against rot and soakage when
watering. Wooden tubs, concrete or earthen-
ware pots are the ideal containers, and in them
can be grown small shrubs such as azaleas,
Rex begonias, fuchsias, hydrangeas, cuphea (the
cigarette flower), daphnes and gardenias. A
small wooden trellis made to fit a tub gives
effective support for lantana ( Sellowiana )
and the decorative asparagus; leaf plants in-
clude crotons, aspidistras, coleus and aucubas,
and among hardy palms are rhaphis, cocos,
phoenix roebelini, chamerops (fan palm), Ken-
tiqs and Bangalow palm ( Seaforthia elegans).
Tree-ferns are also suitable, and on boards for
the walls can be grown staghorns and elkhorns.
We have spasmodic rainfalls at our far-
western N.S.W. town. What flowering plants
will grow there to brighten the garden and
cheer us up? We can only give them the
residue of the washtub. —117.
Suitable plants are portulacas, mesembryan-
themums, zinnias, eschscholtzias, nasturtiums,
geraniums, snapdragons, cosmos, marigolds,
gaillardias, phlox drummondi, calliopsis, Rosy
Morn petunias, cynoglossum (forget-me-not)
and alyssum. Climbing plants to cover an old
tree-stump, fence or trellis are cobaea scandens
(evergreen, with purple bell-shaped flowers),
antignon (red flowers), convolvulus (evergreen
with pink, red, white and blue flowers), beg-
nonias (all colors), honeysuckles, manettia
bicolor, Thunbergia ( Gibsonii, yellow-orange
flowers) and the quick-growing hedera (ivy).
Keep the seed-heads from forming and the
flowering period will be extended. Continual
use of the hoe will prevent the soil caking and
will promote growth.
(1) Where can I buy Cupressus torulosus, and
cost ? (2) When to plant ? Do they grow
well in sandy soil ? —39.
(1) Any of the nurserymen in Sydney could
supply at a cost of about 3s. 6d. each, or 40s.
per doz., carriage and packing extra. (2) Early
in April, when the hot weather is over. (3)
They do well in ordinary garden soil. Sandy
soil would have to be enriched.
What are the prospects of employment for a
lad who takes N.S.W. degree in veterinary
science ? —9867.
Good. The profession is about the only
one that is not only not overcrowded, but
is actually short of the numbers required at
the present moment. This is likely to be the
case for some years to come.
What is the story of the “Diehards” in Eng-
lish politics towards the end of 1918? —108.
The nickname became current when
Lloyd George’s Coalition Government began
to show signs of internal dissension. Many
Conservatives desired to return to the original
party system. The proposal to set up an Irish
Free State with a Parliament in Dublin revived
many oid controversies, and the extreme sec-
tion among the Conservatives became more
urgent in its demands for separation. At first
the leaders of this movement were few in
number and small in influence, and they were
called Diehards almost in derision. But gradu-
ally their influence increased until at an im-
portant party meeting they found themselves
to be in a majority of nearly three to one.
The Coalition Government ceased to exist, and
Lloyd George was succeeded in the Premier-
ship by Bonar Law.
What is Ferrel’s Law ? —99.
It is a statement of the fact that everything
moving on the earth’s surface is subject to a
deflecting force owing to the rotation of the
earth —in the Northern Hemisphere the force
deflects to the right, and in the Southern Hemi-
sphere to the left. This is especially applicable
to the air when in motion.
I have an old snuffbox bought at an auction
sale in Sydney. It has the initials “A.M.” and
“Quartermaster, 99 th Regiment,” engraved on
a silver plate. What regiment would that be ?
—9847.
Possibly the 99th Lanarkshire Regiment,
which was quartered in Sydney on its way to
. the Maori War. Several pieces of the mess
plate have been found in Sydney.
On a sundial is the sun E. at 6 a.m., W. at
6 p.m., S.E. at 9 a.m. and S.W. at 3 p.m. ?
—l4.
Compass direction of the sun varies from
day to day at any given hour according to
the variation in the sun’s declination. Only a *-
the equinoxes, March 22 and Sept. 23, when
the sun is crossing the Equator, is it due east
at 6 a.m., and due west at 6 p.m. On all
other dates it is slightly north or south (accord-
ing as to whether the sun’s declination is north
or south) of the east point at 6 a.m. and
of the west point at 6 p.m. For this reason
sundial times are only approximately correct.
(1) What was the date of the murder of Steve
Grace, of Warracknabeal (Vic.), whose camp
was attacked by blacks near Wiluna ( W.A .) ?
(2) Who were his three mates, and what was
the name of the other member of the party
who was speared ? —24.
(1) August 24, 1907. (2) The party con-
sisted of Robert Kirkpatrick, William Kirk-
patrick, Stephen A. Grace and William Phillips.
Grace and Phillips were speared, Phillips not
seriously.
Should an ordinary citizen discover another
in the act of breaking the law and no police-
man is present, can that citizen demand, in
the name of the law, that the offender accom-
pany him to the nearest police station ? —9917.
Any person who is present when a felony
is committed not only may, but is bound, with-
out a warrant, to arrest the offender. A private
person also may arrest any person whom he
finds committing an indictable offence by night
and in a few other specific instances, but he is
not clothed with a general power such as you
describe.
I believe Captain Cook discovered and
named Whitsunday Passage and Long Island,
landing on the latter for water. (1) Date of
landing on Long Island ? (2) Did Flinders also
land on Long Island, and on what date ? (3)
Names of books in which I can study the sub-
ject, and where obtainable ? —l7.
(1) and (2) There is no record in Captain
Cook’s Journal of his having landed on or even
discovered Long Island. In regard to Whit-
sunday Passage, the entry in his Journal under
date Sunday, June 3, 1770, reads as follows:
“In the afternoon we steered through this pass-
age it is formed by the main on west and
by the islands on the east, one of which is at
least five leagues in length. At six o’clock in
the evening we were nearly the length of the
north end pf the passage 1 called it Whit-
sunday’s Passage, and I called the islands that
formed it Cumberland’s, in honor of the
Duke.” There is no mention of Cook landing
at any island between Cape Conway and Cape
Gloucester. Long Island lies about one-third
of the distance between these capes. Flinders
visited Long Island on September 20, 1802, and
paid successive visits on the 21st and 23rd, and
he gives in his book a further description of
the island on September 28. (3) The only cheap
edition of Cook’s Voyages now likely to be in
print is the Everyman’s Library edition, but it
is very much abbreviated. For instance, it has
no mention of Whitsunday Passage. There is
a good little book on the Voyage of the En-
deavour by Professor G. A. Wood. For the
voyages generally, if the complete account is
desired, it would probably be necessary to pur-
chase one of the early editions, very frequently
quoted in booksellers’ catalogues.
1 signed a joint and several guarantee to
secure an overdraft for an incorporated asso-
ciation seven years ago. I have left the dis-
trict now, and have no interest in the associa-
tion. How can I relieve myself of the liability ?
—46.
You must obtain the consent of your joint
guarantors and that of the bank.
What were the literary activities of J. J.
Shillinglaw, shipping master of the port of Mel-
bourne, about the middle of last century ?
—lls.
In 1870 he acquired the “Colonial Monthly
Magazine” to serve as a receptacle for miscel-
laneous historical information; in 1878 he dis-
entombed from the archives of the Colonial
Secretary’s office at Sydney a number of docu-
ments bearing on the early history of the Port
Phillip settlement, which were published in
1879 by the Victorian Government as “Histori-
cal Records of Port Phillip.” He had previously
written a good deal for the British and Aus-
tralian press. In 1858 he published a ship-
master’s guide for Victorian mariners, in 1859
a book on Arctic discovery, and in 1865 (as
editor) Musgrave’s “Castaway on the Auckland
Islands.”
Often in reading English novels I find refer-
ences to dogcarts. What is meant ? —9O.
A dogcart was originally a horse-drawn car-
riage fitted with a box under the seat for carry-
ing sportsmen’s dogs; later the term was
applied to an ordinary open cart fitted with two
transverse seats placed back to back, the hinder
of these being so constructed that it could be
shut up.
Who was Grinling Gibbons, and what is he
famous for ? —62.
He was a celebrated wood-carver, born about
1648, and is said to have served an apprentice-
ship to William Etty, the architect, who turned
painter. He was discovered by Evelyn, the
diarist, who introduced him to Charles 11. and
Wren. He carved chimney-pieces for the
Queen’s chamber, the King’s drawing-room, the
chapel and the halls at Windsor Castle, and
the choir stalls, organ cases and screens of St.
Paul’s Cathedral.
I have a reproduction of an engraving by
Robert Nanteuil. What is known about the
artist ? —9980.
He was born at Rheims in 1623. Settling in
Paris, he was appointed engraver to the King,
with a pension. He engraved notable portraits
of Mazarin, De Bellievre, Turenne, Jean Loret
and Anne of'Austria.
How is lanoline made ? —9610.
Three parts of water are mixed with seven
parts of neutral wool-fat, extracted from sheep’s
wool, when it is being prepared for spinning.
(1) To what family does the ferret belong?
(2) Average length and color ? (3) Can it be
regarded as a tame animal ? (4) How often
does the ferret breed, and how many in a
litter ? —lO5.
(1) Mustelidce, other members of which are
the badger, weasel, otter and polecat. The
ferret is the domesticated albino variety of the
polecat, both belonging to the genus Putorius.
(2) About Min. long, with yellowish-white fur
and pink eyes. Sometimes ferrets breed with
polecats, and the result is a cross-breed having
fur tinged with brown. (3) No. It may be
partially tamed, but even then occasionally
becomes ferocious. (4) Twice a year; six to
nine ip a litter.

. ...L.F.G.: For exact information write to
the Resident Commissioner at Tulagi. State
whether widow and/or children survive—if not,
who are the next of kin ; also if the estate
consists of realty or personalty or both. It
is improbable that a distinction in death duty
is drawn between cases where a will is made

Victorian Order, is bestowed only on special

If you make no use of the periodical but throw
it aside, there is no implication of an accept-
ance of the implied offer, and consequently no

R.F.: Elliotts stock the preparation, but
supply to trade only. You could get it from a
chemist... .E. 8.: Any insurance co. dealing
with accident risks will show you a schedule.
Almost all cos. trading in Sydney transact such

which you could sue. (2) If the department
ignores your claim and you are convinced it

soak the nests with boiling water. A surer
method is to pour into the holes a little carbon
disulphide, stepping on each hole firmly when
treated to close the opening, and allow tne
fumes to work inside. This will kill' insects and
larvae as well; one treatment is usually suffi-
cient G.M.P.: Have never heard of fabrics
being marked by naphthalene, which is exten-
sively used for preserving woollen clothing
from moths —linens and cottons require
no such treatment. Possibly the stains have
come from the envelopes. All you can do
short of laundering, is to soak the stains with
clean, cold water, keep damp for an hour or
so, then expose to the sunshine; damp repeat-
edly with clean water W.H.W.: CD The
owner of the ‘ aeroplane is responsible, and
could be sued. It rests with the owner to cover
his risk—if he can do so. (2) If the owner of

It was an Australian airman, it appears,
who dropped from the skies in the midst
of the trouble in Iraq last year and took
the threatened Assyrian Patriarch to a
refuge in Cyprus. Flying Officer Norman
Berry Littlejohn was one of the three fly-
ing men nominated two years ago by the
Commonwealth for commissions in the
British Air Force ; he and one other were
allocated to the Indian Air Force, and
he has been located at Basra for 14
months. The I.A.F. has quite a bunch
of Australians, including a Rhodes
scholar, the ex-Rugby winger A. L. Ray-
mond, who is an M.O. with it.

When pianist Benno Moiseiwitch and
his then wife violinist Daisy Kennedy (she
is now the wife of the poet Drinkwater)
were touring in Australia their conversa-
tion would invariably turn on small
daughter Tania. Tania is now in her
teens, with a slight figure and an oval
face. She follows neither in father’s nor
mother’s footsteps, but expresses herself
in color. She is a scenic artist and did
some of the scenery for the present pro-
duction of “Henry VIII.” at Sadler’s
Wells and the Old Vic.

President Roosevelt had a birthday the
other day, his 52nd, and it is recorded that
he received 100,000 cards and 150,000
telegrams, besides stacks of presents and
cake. But the occasion was marred by a
Federal District Judge, who granted an
injunction to restrain a committee from
enforcing the Agricultural Adjustment
Act, which he characterised as “so full
of holes that you could drive eight yoke
of oxen through it.” Turning on Roose-
velt’s Secretary of Agriculture, his Honor
described that gentleman as “having
under him an army of men greater than
Washington’s, and more power than
Caesar or Napoleon, and all without con-
stitutional authority.”

“Lao-dah”: I can sympathise with
Australian newspapers over their con-
fusion about Chinese names (B.
17/1/’34). The orthodox Confucian puts
his surname first and his two early per-
sonal names come after, usually joined
by Westerners with a hyphen. But the
two latter can be and are changed fre-
quently ; thus Sun Yat-sen was known
in China as Sun Wen. The Christian-
ised Chinese sometimes shifts his sur-
name to the tail and replaces it with a
Western baptismal title, and sometimes
he doesn’t. Thus Wellington Koo isn’t
Mr. Wellington, but Mr. Koo, while the
equally eminent Chow Willie Chan may
be Mr. Chow or Mr. Chan —take it or
leave it. The new Manchurian emperor,
Henry Pu-yi, goes one better. His family
name is embedded in the centre, and Mr.
Pu would have been the way to address
him—in his republican days at any rate.
Malay names are even more perplexing.
In some tribes when Damit has a son
called Kelau, he ceases to be Damit and
is known as Pa Kelau, or Kelau’s father.
If a rajah named Kelau ascends the
throne Kelau has to change his name and
so does father ; also Kelau changes his
name after marriage and on other occa-
sions, and the old man has to change with
him. Still, the vagaries of our nomen-
clature are just as bewildering to the
Asiatic. What would he make of Arch-
bishop Head signing himself F. W. Mel-
bourne?
* * * *
“Morimoto”: The new Emperor of
Manchukuo has crowded more vicissi-
tudes into his young life than most of the
discrowned European kings. Born heir
to the oldest throne in Asia, he was saved
from being thrown down a well by dis-
gruntled eunuchs when the Chinese Re-
publicans came into power. The first
President, Yuan Shi Kai, was at heart
a monarchist, and he saw to it that
the boy was accommodated in a wing
of the Forbidden City at Peking, where
he was provided with an English tutor
—the celebrated Buddhist scholar and
ex-British official R. J. Johnstone—a
harem and a big enough civil list to
maintain much of the ancient pomp.
Then Yuan made a jump at imperial
honors himself, but died in the mysterious
fashion which is usual in high circles in
“the East.” Ex-Emperor Pu continued
to lead a life of dignified ease until an
ambitious general, Chang Hsun, dragged
him out of his retirement and dumped
him on the Dragon throne for a brief
two weeks. This sort of thing would
make anybody but a Celestial revolu-
tionary want to chop the kingly head
off, but Pu was allowed to retire to Tien-
tsin, where he played with a typewriter
and learned trick cycling until the Japan-
ese translated him to Mukden. Now it
is reported that he is shortly to proceed
to Japan to confer with his fellow-Em-
peror of Nippon, and it is on the cards
that he will reascend his old throne.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The laugh that Sydney had been gap-
ing for during a long dull week was
supplied by “Listen, Lester” on Saturday
night. Into the Criterion crowded smart,
bejewelled women, their trains more or
less regally sweeping the aisle and stair-
way. Mere man did his best to keep in
the picture with tails and hand-wrought
ties. Jean Anderson made handsome
entry in flowered taffetas. Mrs. Tait
came with just-returned E.J. and daugh-
ter Mrs. Jimmy Bancks in silver tones
set off with turquoise feathers. Rene
Riano’s figure was envied by every
woman from front stalls to the back
seat of the gallery, firstly in its silver tis-
sue mould that frothed into a wide hem-
line of emerald-green marabout and
wore the shoulders of its leg-o’-mutton
sleeves pointed, and lastly in white velvet
that had its long mediaeval bodice bor-
dered with a plait of the fabric. In
between joyously occurred a daffodil
velvet. Bea Hussey-Cooper, from Bowral,
made her first professional appearance in
songandance numbers, and Maoriland’s
Joan de Beere, who has arrived in Syd-
ney by way of years of study and experi-
ence in London and Paris, danced like
a moonbeam.
All Sydney seems to be rushing off to
buy a steamer ticket or a marriage
license. The very lucky ones are buying
both. At the present rate of vow-
exchange one of the best investments
would be shares in a confetti factory.
Wreathed about with last week’s orange-
blossoms were Margaret Grant, of Warra-
wee, and John Dyneley Fell, a son of
David Fell, who now lives in London.
This found all the social North Shore
liners gathered together at Maiala, the
Beresford Grant home. Among the guests
were the next day’s bride and ’groom,
Alice Carruthers and Dr. Geoffrey Mait-
land. Another knot-tying that caused a
boom in the crystal and silver trade was
that of Peggy Carter and Geoffrey Sad-
dington. The bride came from Urie
Point, Brewarrina; v Geoffrey’s home
address is Wahroonga. This ceremony
was set in the garden of No. 11 Onslow-
avenue, the altar being raised in a mar-
quee hung with ruby-red and green cur-
tains.
The old nonsense verses about pigs
flying and cows jumping over the moon
are being recalled in Salamaua, where the
butcher does his rounds by aeroplane,
and naturally the pig and the cow (even
though their parts are not assembled in
one whole) accompany him. Mrs. Allen
Innes told the business girls lunching in
Farmer’s last Wednesday all about
domestic arrangements on this island,
where she has lived for many years. The
lady could also have told them a good
deal about her own voluntary work m
nursing the little community in the days
when medical aid was more remote than
now. Mrs. Innes has welcomed more
than 80 brides to her little corner of the
earth, and one of the pleasantest homes
in New Guinea is that made by a
Devon bride who waited 25 years
for her fiance, toiling against odds. At
last luck, touched by such constancy,
smiled on the man’s labors. Verbal
decorations for bravery were pinned by
the speaker on the blouses of Mrs. Eric
Osborne, who paints the landscape on
Rossell Island surrounded by hostile and
critical crocodiles, and Mrs. Ede, of
Lachlan Island.
With a complete absence of swank
young Tom Kelly, the Bertie Kellys’
elder son, a product of Eton and Oxford
and one of the richest young men in the
State, hied him to St. John’s Church in
Balmain last Saturday to marry his Mollie
McWilliam —a splendid horsewoman and
fond of all outdoor amusements. The
smiling bride set ofl her smartly tailored
white crepe suit with a jaunty little white
toque. Her flowers were a shoulder spray
of pink frangipanni.
Mayoress A. L. Parker showed her
mettle as a hostess last week when she
gave her first civic tea-party. To this
were bidden the aldermen and the heads
of departments and their wives, and as
everybody knew everybody there were
no strained silences. All chirped as gay as
birds upon the bough, and to this babble
the softly-stealing music from the orches-
tra ran like a pleasing undertone. Mrs.
Parker, who from half-time onwards had
the support of the Mayor, moved among
her guests, very cool-looking in her
apricot crepes smartly buttoned in
brown. Last year’s Mayoress Hagon
added a caramel-toned ensemble to the
summer frocking.
Perhaps it is reaction from the tailor-
ings she wears for her male impersona-
tions that causes Ella Shields, off stage, to
be ultra-feminine in her attire. Impec-
cable white kid gloves, shoulder length, or
nearly so, and a fan of which the Pom-
padour herself might have been proud are
invariable accessories to Ella going a-may-
ing. In her slim black velvet dress with
its sweeping train, her white shingle and
her clear complexion Ella did not look
unlike a French marquise at Carrie
Lanceley’s party in her honor. Carrie,
who , se ow n singing voice is heard all too
rarely these times, lives in a rambling old
home up Greenwich way The garden
1S full of flowers; the house of old
French pieces, of which Miss Lanceley is
a connoisseur. Everybody in Sydney s
musical and theatrical world turned
up to bid the popular Ella good-bye ; and
Tedd y Cahlll PJ* hi? appreciation into a
programme of Chopin and the moderns,
With temperatures soaring, and city
pavements excellent understudies to the
grill of St. Lawrence, the news that some-
body at last is setting about sinking a
swimming pool in the heart of the city
raises three cheers. At the present time
the toiler who wishes for a bathe must
hie him or her to the Domain baths
(and no trams go within coo-ee thereof),
or else go out to Coogee or Bondi,
But this, of course, can only be done
at the end of the day, and by that time,
being mostly creatures of routine, our
one thought is to board tram or ferry for
home.. The pool will have its sides and
sliding roof of glass. Showers, h. and c., a
gymnasium and a cafe are among the
joyous etceteras promised. But the baths
won’t be ready till next summer,
Helen Stewart is the girl responsible for
bright and light-hearted art show in
Macquarie Galleries. Helen has
almost filled her exhibition with portraits
er contemporaries girls in berets
with swagger spotted scarves, in rasp-
berry-pink and grass-green dresses ; girls
with brightly-hued composition bangles;
§. irls who look as though they’re just set-
tinS put on a cruise (which indeed, if
Y° u mink of life as a sea, they are) and
ai p read Y to greet hail or shine with a
grm on their lipsticked mouths. Whether

P ot > Y° ull ,d )_e the bold way she handles
“ er c °l° r - There s not a second of bore-
dom in the show. Thea Proctor in Syd-
ney, Lhote and Vythacyl in Paris,
trained Helen in her job. Dorothy Weld-
ing made this picture.
Mrs. A. T. Anderson, the foster
mother of all the young moderns, spoke
the prologue to the show. In both rooms
of the gallery it was a case of eyes front
while she introduced the pictures on the
walls to the visitor and said that the young
artist had captured the “winged bright-
ness of the Australian girl.” The speaker
was parked behind a great bunch of
roses during the oration, and was later
squired around the rooms by young
Philip Game, husband General Ander-
son and Helen’s proud father. The artist
was brilliant in hibiscus reds.
The Hobson’s Bay went off yesterday
with a full human cargo. Among the
streamer-holders was barrister John
Gould, who goes as the Shakspeare
Society’s representative to centenary
junketings at Stratford. John, who has
a speaking voice as rich and resonant
as the tones of a ’cello, should give an
oration among the English highbrows,
and thereby squelch the libel that all
Australians speak with a twang. His
pretty wife and their offspring travelled
with him as far as Hobart. Another
whose hands were crowded with
streamers was Mrs. E. A. Thomas, of
Chatswood. Mrs. Thomas is a public-
spirited woman who works in many
causes, and at one of her farewell parties
representative women from the Mothers’
Union, the C. of E. Homes, the Anzac
Fellowship and the Guild of Empire
spoke in praise of the departing one.
One of this traveller’s most prized gifts
is the leather passport case given to her
by the old ladies at Rosebank, Glebe.
Joan Hartigan is going off to Wimble-
don with the Davis Cup players. This
is breaking new ground, for our girl
players have hitherto gone abroad in
women’s teams. There were quite a tense
day or two while Australia’s young
champion and her supporters were uncer-
tain whether the A.L.T.A. would manfully
hand out a cheque for £lOO to match
the £lOO thrown in by the N.S.W. body
for her expenses. Finally, the Melbourne
end determined to do the handsome
thing, so Joan takes her women’s singles
championship and her slim eagerness to
face the world’s best. She won’t play in
shorts though ; she prefers skirts. Joan
is an ex-pupil of Loretto Convent at
Kirribilli, and a daughter of this State’s
Railway Commissioner.
A daughter of the late ex-Premier
Joseph Carruthers was married on a hot,
still night of last week to Dr. Duncan
Geoffrey Maitland, the younger son of
Sydney’s still-grieved-for Herbert Mait-
land. The fashionable marriage, smithy
of St. Mark’s at Darling Point was
chosen for the vow-forging, and its pews
rustled with the latest version of purple
and fine linen, a modish interpretation in
white angel-skin lace and a blue tulle
hat with a crown of blue flowers being
supplied by the ’groom’s mother, the
Maitland lady. The Carruthers lady was
frocked in dusky pink lace. A velvet hat
of the same tone and a sheaf of del-
phiniums on a background of fuchsias
struck an opulent color note. The bride,
Alice Carruthers, a shimmer of pearly
satins, her arms filled with white tiger-
lilies, was followed by sister Peggy in a
trailing frock of white Chantilly lace and
a white crin. flat-in-the-front hat, the
space between its upturned brim at the
back blooming with field flowers. From
St. Mark’s the guests went on to the
Rose Bay Golf Club, where the eatables
lurked amid posies of wildflowers. The
moon of their delight will beam on the
two fishing along the South Coast.
“Faust” in English by an all-Australian
cast was the big gun by the A.B.C. last
week. Cecil Sherwood was the rejuven-
ated savant and Mollie de Gunst the
Marguerite of the performance, which
filled the studio with persistent opera first-
nighters. Mollie’s diction was good ; that
of Cecil might be best described by the
Italian phrase which means “flower of
the lips.” Mollie, who is of Junoesque
build, sleek black hair and oval face,
presented a Mona Lisa-ish expression to
the microphone, rather than the ingenuous
look of the village maid. She wore black
velvet, patterned in green, and was
flanked by a dulcet-toned Siebel, in
powder blues, and a very youthful
Marthe, in yellow. Listening and watch-
ing were all the prima donnas of former
performances, and among the loud
applauders of Walter Kingsley’s sinis-
terly debonair Mephisto were Roland
Foster, Jean Drummond, Art Gallery
director Jimmy Macdonald and Mrs.
Florence Taylor, who sat with her friend
Mrs. Wunderlich.
Clifford Hay, the handsome Under-
secretary of the Premier’s department,
is to stage-manage Prince George’s tour
of this State, as he did for the Prince
of Wales and the Royal Yorks. Clifford
is well up in all matters of precedence
and he seems to sense just how far a
visiting royalty can be urged in the
matter of bigger and better levees. He
is full of tact, and even under the sever-
est strain the polish of his manner has
never been known to crack.
The new travelling baby clinic which
has already got busy on the Far West
Children’s Health Scheme looked a cosy
little home for Sister Kellie when seen
at No. 11 Central last week. At one end
is her bedroom, at the other a bathroom
and kitchenette, while in between the
little clinic is speckless and shining. Kelso
King opened it with a gold key and Rail-
way Commissioner Hartigan acted as
fairy godfather, his gift being a forgive-
and-forget message from his department
to the Far West Council concerning the
£l4O it had cost to reconstruct the car-
riage.
Melbourne may have its centenary, but
Sydney will have its Festival Fortnight
and dazzle Prince George with a Vene-
tian carnival on Port Jackson. The
gaieties will be tucked into November-
December, and listed among the outdoor
frolics are a surf-club day, a masked
Venetian ball (and this Letter would hate
to miss seeing some of the costumes and
their wearers at that), a buckjumping
championship, an Air Force display, a
sculling championship, and an aeroplane
Derby. And there’ll surely be balls at
the Town Hall and at Government
House.
Visit the Electrical and Radio Exhibition,
Sydney Town Hall, Feb. 28 to March 10.

“The Barrier Miner,”
Broken Hill.
Published since 1888 and circulating
throughout Broken Hill, the West Darling
pastoral country and many of the north-
ern parts of South Australia, “The Barrier

readers and advertisers.

Chatter
The Ivan Gutmann couple gave a
house-warming (the mercury helping by
an unexpected leap to 107 in the city) at
their new home in St. George’s-road. It
was a late-afternoon affair, sherry, cock-
tails and much longer drinks with the
tinkle of ice and the frost on glasses
giving new life to the wilted guests. Host
and hostess did their formal receiving in
the drawing-room, and the party then
went outside to the shade of the two-
storeyed house and gum-trees, and the
clear mirrors of lily-ponds, dragon-
flies darting over them and goldfish disap-
pearing among their dark-green vegeta-
tion. Mrs. Gutmann wore her favorite
browns and beiges, so successful with
auburn hair, and a large hat. Many
medicoes moved among the guests. Of
the smartest who trod the lawns was Mrs.
Keith Allard, who accompanied her hus-
band, and Edna Glasscock was distinc-
tive among the girls. Guests who recon-
noitred the house received an impression
of much sage-green and crushed straw-
berry, beautiful furnishings and glittering
tiled bathrooms as a complement to each
bedroom.
This Page paid a formal call upon
Percy, the new arrival at the Aquarium.
He is a crocodile, young and only half-
grown at eight feet, though his age is
guessed at 100. In his native North
Queensland swamps he could have
counted on a further 200 years of bask-
ing in the sun and slithering through the
mud. Percy peevishly cracked one of
his best molars trying to get out of his
new cage on his first day there, but now
he spends all his time lost in thought,
without a movement of his submerged,
spiny length. Our Aquarium has had
other attempts at importing crocs., but
the animals met untimely deaths in trans-
port ; one was strangled while being
hoisted off the ship, another was drowned
and a third got shot by mistake. Upon
dissection all their interiors showed
accumulations of barbed-wire, nails,
pieces of piping and horseshoes.
The hot spell caused a few casualties
among other aquarium inmates. The
seals barked and snorted in disgust.
Some fish drifted round in a perpendicu-
lar position gasping air ; others lay on the
bottom, moving nothing but their goblin
eyes. In the largest salt-water tank, two
sharks, hard, leathery and baleful,
though they’re only infants, moved like
swift, grim shadows. Among the newts
were elegant creatures clad in what could
be described as “snowflake satin,” with
rose-pink ruffles fluttering round their
necks.
We are being militant for the Navy,
Army and Air Force are baring
their teeth and showing with spectacular
pageantry and noise how well they know
their jobs. There have been rehearsals ;
khaki has marched the streets on our
hottest nights and bands have carried
instruments up to the Exhibition, the
buildings and grounds of which have
been hired for the event. Some officers
and troops have shakedowns on the spot
to guard the exhibits. There are varied
and interesting programmes every after-
noon and evening. Those who aren’t
used to wars and warfare would be wise
to take cottomwool for their ears.
The Leitch lady, in the absence of her
husband, who is being nursed back to
health, performed the official opening of
Everyman’s Library’s new home. A
travel club, a display of posters and a
balcony garden of marigolds are adjuncts
to Dora de Beer’s venture in the Colonial
Mutual. “Armchair” travellers with a
cup of tea and a cigarette can take their
choice of cruise or voyage of adventure
in the lounge. There’s a movie camera
which will be used to illustrate a series
of talks by travellers who have something
to say about their rambles. Of the
posters, the London Underground lets
loose the Zoo animals with amusing re-
sults. Monkeys run up and down
escalators, lions buy the “Daily Gossip”
and liver pills from a wolf and a mon-
goose, and seals do swallow dives from
the Noah’s Ark springboard.
You get used to a monotony of menu
and doing without fresh vegetables if you
live in the interior of China; also you
become blase about guerilla warfare and
can live without frequent mails. Dr.
and Mrs. Harold Anderson are fond of
Chengtu, despite its discomforts. While
the doctor is lecturing and working in his
lab., his wife is busy educating Chinese
girls in the “fine arts” department. The
Y.W.C.A. made itself alluring with tiger-
lilies, hydrangeas and a profusion of
other flowers when it gave a florin tea in
honor of the Andersons. Miss A. M.
Brown welcomed and introduced the
special guests, who spoke of their work in
China. The doctor is soon off to Eng-
land to find out about tuberculosis and
to raise money to fight the disease in
the East.
C.W.A. centres are competing to see
which can send the most attractive and
useful batch of articles to the Melbourne
centre’s shop. The inducement is a £5 ss.
plum for the winning branch, donated by
the association’s chairwoman, Mrs.
Ronald Macdonald. As well as skill and
neatness of nimble fingers and the artful-
ness of cookery there will be points for
packing and labelling. The shop opens
in April.
February 22-24 are dates reserved by
the Power House Dramatic Club for
“The Case of the Frightened Lady” at
the Palace. The producer of the Edgar
Wallace thriller, which is guaranteed to
send a shiver up your spine and make you
grab the perfect stranger in the next-door
seat, is Terence Crisp, snapped here by
Broothorn. Mr. Crisp is on the com-
mittee of the Playlovers’ Club and a
member of the Little Theatre. For both
groups he has developed play-readings
into something more interesting than a
semicircle of nervous amateurs reciting
their lines from a mass of typed matter.
The players use script, but they are well
rehearsed ; they make entrances and exits
and there are curtains. Broadcasting is a
sideline.
Earnings by “The Frightened Lady” go
towards the Somers Camp. Lord Somers
founded his scheme on the same basis as
the Duke of York’s venture at Little-
stone-on-Sea; the object is to bring
together public-school boys and lads
whose environment is the factory, with
the hope that they will exchange ideas,
play together as equals and perhaps be-
come good friends through seeing one
another’s point of view. There’s not much
roughing it about the camp. Conveni-
ent buildings sprang up at the opening of
philanthropists’ purses, and the site on
Western Port Bay was a gift of J. S.
Feehan. At the conclusion of the big
annual camp at Somers every boy auto-
matically becomes a member of Power
House and can attend the smaller camps
held during the year and bring a pal with
him. Dr. McAdam and George Nicholas
are the chief and deputy-chief.
After a giddy round of pre-nuptial par-
ties Lesley Gowan found herself in bridal
attire keeping an appointment with Stan
Hunt in Melbourne Grammar School
chapel. Clouds of tulle veil swept over
the long train which was attached to the
waist-line of her crinkled ninon gown.
Gold lame ribbons bound the white roses
of her bouquet. Mary Whitehead, Judith
Campbell and Lilian Hunt were a lime-
green trio, their trained chiffon dresses
trimmed with frills round the decolletages
and their heads diademed with crystal
flowers. The aftermath was at Grosvenor.
Joan Hersey, only daughter of the J. E.
Harpers, of Numurkah, and C. W. Ward
set sail in their matrimonial barque from
Scots Church. Honiton lace worn by
the bride’s mother at her wedding was
used to beautify the modern bridal attire.
The veil was of old Limerick lace, and
the perfume of frangipanni mingled in
the bouquet with the allure of water-lilies
and gladioli. Esme Daniel attended in
Chartreuse-green georgette and pink roses
in her hair. A small boy and girl, John
and Margaret Harper, saw that the
bride’s train flowed smoothly. Intimate
friends and relatives stepped up a block
to the Oriental for the after-rejoicings.
Betty Hickie, who was a passenger on
last week’s inward-bound mailboat, saw
England through domestically-tinted spec-
tacles. She got a job touring as assistant
demonstrator for a new Parkinson stove.
Cookery demonstrations were the pills in-
side a sugar-coating of plays with a kit-
chen background. Admission to these
comedies and Httle dramatic interludes
was free, and consequently full houses re-
sulted in each town. There were traps in
plenty for the demonstrator who became
immersed in the plot to the detriment of
the cheese souffle ; but on the whole the
experts got through their jobs without
many burns or underdone meals. A
sprinkling of professional mummers per-
formed in the casts, and Australian Gwen
Hughes was author and producer of
several playlets.
Noel Clapp, the much-talked-of society
lass, who sells misses’ dresses at Myer’s,
is wearing a fiery diamond with emerald
wings. The man in the case is Dr. Geof-
frey Smith, son of Dr. Julien Smith.
This is an Andre portrait of one of
Melbourne’s most attractive matrons,
Mrs. Phil Finkelstein. Her hobbies are
golf, driving -her own car and surfing ;
she and daughter Peggy had a rapturous
time recently shooting the Pacific
breakers at Honolulu. The Women’s
Hospital is one of her pet charities, and
she’s that rarity an excellent correspon-
dent. After 20 years away from Maori-
land, the country of her birth, she never
misses a weekly letter to an intimate
friend in the Dominion. She’s the wife
of Phil Finkelstein, of the Firm.
Perth records a merry week:
Springtime engagements are resulting in a
series of summertime weddings, with several
brides insisting on slipping unobtrusively into
matrimony. Medico Hayward’s daughter Lloyda
had the quietest ceremony of the week, with
only her parents, sister Betty and ’groom E. T.
Pettitt at St. Patrick’s, Mt. Lawley. Nan Page
Smith slipped on Neilson Handcock’s ring after
a morning drink at Mrs. Hubert Momber’s
Cottesloe home, where a presentation was
made. In spite of a scorching sun sending the
temperature round the century mark, Edith Beck
managed to keep her bridal rosebuds from wilt-
ing as she became Mrs. Robert Hicks. Her
blush-pink laces and wide black racello were
rearguarded by the cornflower-blue blister
crepes of Mrs. Helen Clarkson, who joined in
the family rejoicings at the Savoy.
The W. J. Winterbottoms’ garden looked like
a Continental boulevard at their party for Mr.
and Mrs. J. F. Loutit, who sailed for the Cold
Country in the Mongolia. Gaily-colored giant
umbrellas shaded a crescent on the lawn where
guests sipped cocktails and speared savories at
tables surrounded by chairs and lounges. Green
and primrose blossoms grew on Mrs. Loutit’s
black georgette gown, and hues reflecting the
brollies filtered through Mrs. Winterbottom’s
airy mousselines.
Woolgrowers foregathered at the W.A.C.A.
as the guests of, and to play cricket against,
the woolbrokers. Feminine supporters of both
teams came along on the breeze which cooled
proceedings after luncheon, and consumed tea
and ices in the grandstand. Dalgety’s R. A.
Cameron brought his better-half; pretty little
Mrs. Jack Money watched her husband mow
down broker wickets, and Mrs. Geoff Maxwell
applauded her husband’s useful score. The
Guy McLeods, various branches of the Burt
family, the Ernie Halls, Forrests and Messers
were in the handshaking arena.
Twenty-four hours a day allow “Johnnie”
Lathlain little time for sleep ’twixt her pre-
wedding party dates. Her embroidered white
organdies billowed at an Esplanade luncheon
table which was head- and tail-pieced by Mrs.
Tom Moore and Gwenyth Ambrose; later they
fluffed over cards during a rubber of bridge,
and were then given a hasty shake before the
rush of the Arthur Males, where Dot and Tom
had garnered some 60 cocktail quaffers. The
Geoff Lynns shook a further batch of cock-
tails in her honor; sisters Mrs. Robin
Leiper and Gwen Cadd unleashed decks of
cards, and Freda Weir rallied the troops once
more for a final round at the Esplanade.
The Karrakatta Club’s first musicale of the
year drew a horde of members and friends to
the rose- and zinnia-decked reception-room.
Dashing scarlet flat crepes with matching head-
piece encompassed Mrs. Cecil Mason, who
joined forces in programme-arw.nging with
Kitty Gillies, lithe and blithe in diagonal-
streaked uncrushable silks. Elia Peterson and
Mildred Grigg harmonised their notes in song,
Gwen Brockway and Veronica Kenniwell had
a piano each for their duets, and Edward
Black, Alice Mallon and G. Glassford gave
piano, vocal and violin solos.
The stream of farewell parties for Mrs. Her-
bert and daughter Jean flowed steadily right
up to the eve of their departure in the Mon-
golia. The culminating effort was a picnic at
Serpentine, whither Mary Henn piloted a col-
lection of cars crammed with youth and good
cheer.
Staff Corps circles bemoan the transfer of
Capt. A. H. Boyes, who with his wife has a
finger in the pie of most military social manoe-
uvres. They go to Sydney.
The Speck’s summer gaieties:
Launceston had a day out for the Summer
Cup meeting at Mowbray. His Ex. and Lady
Clark motored out. The president (Dr. G. E.
Clemons) tea-ed them and a big crowd of other
guests in the committee room, where the tables
were decorated with phlox of all colors. Lady
Clark wore a black lace frock topped by a
small black hat with touches of mauve, purple
and dull pink. Organdie and printed chiffons
worn with picture hats were favorite feminine
wear. Lieut.-Governor Lewis and his lady were
in the throng, together with Mayor and Mayor-
ess Hollingsworth, the Andrew Raeburns, the
Tulloch Scotts, the T. A. Fields and Mrs. C. P.
Andrews and her sister.
Launceston’s carnival week ran with vim
after the good wool sales. The Bachelors’ Ball
at the Metropole was one of the great occa-
sions. The ballroom was decorated with masses
of pink, rose and blue hydrangeas. Supper
was served in the dining-room, beautified with
pink carnations of all shades.
Italy and Australia shook hands when Col.
and Mrs. Juele feted the Italian Consul-
General, Marchese Ferrante de Ruffano, and his
marqhesa at Hadley’s hotel. Decorations com-
bined the British red, white and blue and the
Italian green, red and white, a bouquet in the
last trio being presented to the marchesa by
Mrs. Alan Mclntyre. Hobart’s importants filled
the and the city’s very small Italian
colony was represented. The hostess was in
a beige turnout, and the marchesa looked smart
in navy blue.
His Ex. and Lady Clark entertained the
De Ruffanos at dinner, and the Italian visitors
were also made much of by the Lyceum Club
and Victoria League.
The president of the Kingston Beach Golf
Club and Mrs. Webster entertained a huge
throng at the links. Weather was fine, and
cars rolled up in hundreds. All the southern
clubs were represented, and a sprinkling of
mainlanders leavened the Tasmanian bun. Tea
was set out on little tables in the dining-room,
where vases of red roses and many-hued sweet-
peas looked gay on the blue and white checked
tablecloths.
Valmai Cox and Fred W. Gourlay were tied
up for better or worse at the Methodist Church,
New Town, the bride wearing ivory ring velvet,
made on Empire lines, with a Juliet cap and
long, flowing tulle veil falling back to form a
train. Four ’maids in nattier-blue organdie,
with picture hats in dull pink, adorned with
large velvet bows of blue, followed.
Olive Wilton and daughter Junee are back
in the Speck after a year’s absence in London.
Junee got word by wireless on the way out
that she had won a Fellowship of the Trin. Col.
Music, London. She’s the first on the roll
of Tasmanian candidates to earn that distinc-
tion. Miss Wilton has been making a study of
repertory-theatre methods at Birmingham and
Manchester.

BY HENRY G. LAM ON D.
44nPHIS is what we’re lookin’ for,
I Barney,” Bill Ridgeboard ad-
dressed his brother, rising to his
six feet one of raw-boned manhood and
peering from under his beetling brows,
Barney, a reduced replica of his
brother, took the Stock Sales List and
read the marked item by the light of the
hurricane lamp: “2000 ewes, mixed ages,
all sound mouths, Pirrapilla bred, Sep-
tember shorn, to lamb in May, travelling
for sale, now about Tambo. Price Bs.
plus droving.”
“No good to us,” Barney grunted.
“Tambo’s a couple of hun’red mile away,
an’ they’ll cost nine an’ six landed here.
We can get cheaper sheep, an’ just as
good, nearer home. Th’ bank won’t
advance us another bob. We have to get
stock on here quick an’ lively or they’ll
close on us.”
“We’ve thirty thousan’ acres,” Bill com-
menced in a judicial tone. “We’ve cut
ourselves to th’ bone, an’ we’ve borrowed
to th’ limit, to improve th’ joint. Now
we got to get sheep. An’ we’ve got less
than a thousan’ quid to do it! Two
thousan’ ewes ain’t no good to us. We
want four thousan’ for a starter. That’s
our position. You agree to that?”
“Your argument’s good,” Barney
approved. “Keep goin’.”
“Right alongside of us is Moorstania
station. They shear a hun’red an’ twenty
to a hun’red an’ fifty thousan’ every year.
What’s their earmark?”
“Front quarter,” Barney replied briefly.
“What’s th’ Pirrapilla earmark?”
“Dunno.”
“Pirrapilla, Barney, is down near
Charleville. Moorstania is where we are.
Th’ Gover’ment, only, havin’ a limited
number of earmarks for sheep, duplicates
th’ earmark in different, districts. Pirra-
pilla’s got th’ front quarter, too! I often
thought them years I spent drovin’ wasn’t
wasted. I know a lot of earmarks.”
“But there’s th’ tar brand,” Barney
objected. “All these stations is usin’ th’
tar brand now.”
“You makes me tired!” Bill spat.
“What’s Moorstania’s brand?”
“Black L on th’ rump.”
“What’s ours?”
“Red B on th’ rump.”
“Moorstania uses that Indeelico
brand,” Bill announced, a note of triumph
in his voice. “That goes a kind of rusty
color after it’s been out in th’ weather a
month or two. We uses Oovine Red.
That goes a rusty color after a month or
two. A man’s a dead mug if he can’t
stick a red B over th’ top of a black L.”
“Keep goin’, Bill.”
“When does Moorstania shear?”
“They start first week in October.”
“Them Pirrapillas is September shorn.
They’ve got th’ same earmark, about th’
same growth of wool, an’ they’ll carry
th’ same tar brand in certain instances of
what’s goin’ for to happen. Are you with
me this far?”
“I’m beginnin’ to see light,” Barney
admitted. “You’ve overlooked th’ fact
them Pirrapillas will be carryin’ a black
T to show they’ve been travellin’. Th’
Moorstanias ain’t got no T. Even if we
puts one on ’em, it won’t look as old as
th’ Pirrapillas for a few months.”
“You won’t buy no tattoo oil to pick
up dust an’ look old quick,” Bill agreed.
“But we can get lampblack. We can
render down mutton fat. We can mix
th’ two. That makes a tar brand cheap
an’ quick. It picks up dust lively, an’ it
looks old as soon as it’s put on. I often
wondered why I worked twelve months
for th’ lousiest pastoral firm in Australia.
They certainly do teach a man a point or
two. Any other objections?”
“Only th’ simple matter of finance.
Where we goin’ to raise th’ money to
buy these Pirrapillas? Nine an’ six
landed here means a thousan’ quid.”
“Listen, Barney,” Bill spoke impres-
sively. “We can get them ewes on bills.
We can double ’em off Moorstania. We
can sell a few, clear th’ ewes, an’ still
be a heap in pocket. Moorstania lambs
in June. Everything fits in like a jig-
saw puzzle. It’s temptin’ Providence not
to take th’ gifts what’s offered. We
might have to wait a month or two till
Moorstania puts a mob of ewes in a
handy paddock for us. That don’t
matter. They’ll be growin’ wool for our
benefit.”
“We can’t fly ’em,” Barney protested.
“We must leave tracks. What about
that?”
“There’s only one lot of tracks what
counts,” Bill advised. “Them’s th’ ones
where they get out of th’ paddock. Other
tracks don’t matter. I’ll blind them
tracks. I won’t have no tracks. What
about it?”
“You’re on!”
The Pirrapilla ewes were bought and
delivered at Outanouta Park. The brothers
put them through the yards and stamped
them with their brand: a red B on the
rump. They were let go in a small pad-
dock adjoining the homestead. The
Ridgeboards waited.
"‘We wants ’em handy,” Bill explained.
“As soon as we gets these Moorstanias
we boxes ’em. We splits ’em up and
puts ’em all over th’ block. An’ we
won’t have to sell none, neither, to meet
our bills! I give a lien over th’ clip.
We’re set. Now we only wants old
Donaldson, of Moorstania, to put a mob
of his sheep handy an’ well get busy.”
A week later Bill rode home in high
glee. “Donaldson’s playin’ right into our
hands!” he exclaimed. “He’s put eight
thousan’ five-year-old ewes in Gumboil
Paddock. That’s right on th’ boundary
beside us. I seen old Feathers, th’ boun-
dary-rider of Gumboil. In fact, I drew
th’ cork from th’ bottle for him. He
talked. He told me Donaldson’s leavin’
’em there for three or four months. We
can get ’em any time ; an’ there’s no time
like th’ present! ”
“But,” Barney objected, “how about
tracks? If they sees horse tracks there
they’ll know there’s somethin’ doin’.
None of our sheep is runnin’ near Gum-
boil. They’ll see tracks on this side.”
“P’ff!” Bill dismissed the fears.
“There’s spellin’ horses runnin’ in Gum-
boil. No man livin’ can tell th’ differ-
ence between th’ tracks of a ridden horse
and th’ tracks of one what’s runnin’ loose.
We won’t put ’em through th’ boundary
there. It’s a nettin’ fence. Th’ man ain’t
yet born what can cross sheep over net-
tin’ without damagin’ it an’ drawin’
attention to th’ fact.”
“Then how you goin’ for to get em’?”
Barney demanded. “We can’t fly ’em.”
“Our horses’ tracks don’t matter,” Bill
explained carefully. “That’s number one.
We’ll take a couple of thousan’ of them
ewes through th’ fence into Molar Pad-
dock. We’ll take ’em across Molar. Th’
paddock sheep runnin’ in there’ll blind
our tracks. We’ll bring ’em through th’
Poolpoothra Gate on th’ boundary into
our place.”
“An’ how about th’ tracks through th’
gate?” Barney sneered. “Nobody won’t
smell no rat if they sees a mob of tracks
goin’ through a gate, will they?”
“There’s six thousan’ ewes on th’ road
now, travellin’ from Strathbyan to Mee-
tucka. They’ll be cornin’ through th’
Poolpoothra Gate early Wednesday
mornin’. We wants to put our lot through
just before daylight Wednesday mornin’.
Them Strathbyans is goin’ for to blind
our tracks. What about that?”
“Bill,” Barney said admiringly, “you
ought to be in Parliament.”
On Tuesday night the Ridgeboards, with
Spanker the dog following, rode through
the boundary and out into Gumboil
Paddock. Before midnight they had the
sheep together and had taken the num-
ber they required over on the fence of
Molar Paddock. Barney rode round
them and kept them in position. Bill
went to the fence. He opened a panel
of it. He plugged the wires to keep them
from slackening back through the strain.
Bill took a roll of woolpacks from the
pommel of his saddle. He spread them and
laid them as a blanket over the opening
he had made in the fence. With a couple
of wires he stayed the corners of the
blanket to two near saplings. That kept
the thing in position. Any sheep going
through the opening would have to walk
on the woolpacks, not touching the earth,
and thus leaving no tracks.
He remounted his horse and rode
round the back of the mob to join his
brother.
“You take your horse through, Bar-
ney,” he advised. “Me an’ th’ dog can
hold ’em. When you get through, leave
your horse tied up on th’ other side. You
come back an’ grab one of them ewes by
th’ ears. You walk backwards through
th’ openin’, draggin’ th’ sheep after you.
Leave th’ rest to me an’ Spanker. An
when they starts runnin’ you get on your
horse an’ hold ’em there in th’ corner
till they all gets through.”
When Barney commenced to drag his
captive the nearest sheep looked at it.
Cautiously, a step at a time and with in-
finite care, it followed that led sheep. It
came to the woolpacks stretched on the
ground. It hesitated. But the led sheep
was crossing that obstacle. It was going
with its feet propped stiffly, dragging its
hooves and unwillingly. But it was going.
Where one sheep will go another will fol-
low. The follower sniffed, held com-
munion with itself, and nervously ad-
vanced. When less than half across the
packs it bounded wildly and fled past

the sheep which Barney held. Others
fob owed it. The string commenced.
But they did not run freely. They
halted a dozen times. They broke and
had to be restarted. At the best they
merely dribbled instead of flowing in an
even stream. An hour passed, and only
about a thousand had crossed.
“We’ll have to shake it up, Bill,”
Barney called. “It’s six mile from here
to th’ Poolpoothra Gate. You ain’t for-
gettin’, are you, that daylight comes about
five o’clock?”
“Bring your mob closer to act as
coachers,” Bill advised. “I’ll force these
others through with a rush.”
The sheep would not rush. They
hugged one side of the opening and
jambed against the post of the fence as
they went through. They refused, with
all the perversity which is theirs alone
among domestic animals, to take the full
panel and to make use of all the opening.
At last they were all through. Barney
took them on alone while Bill repaired
the fence and removed all traces of the
exodus. He mounted his horse and
caught up with Barney and the sheep.
They pushed along. But the sky in the
east was visibly lightening when they
reached Poolpoothra Gate. And behind
them, not half a mile away, was the glow
of the campfire and the dim outline of
the camp of the Strathbyan sheep. They
were home on Outanouta Park —that was
all which mattered to the brothers.
“We can’t take ’em straight along th’
road to th’ yards at th’ house,” Bill ad-
vised. “That runs along th’ high downs
all th’ way, an’ we’d only be advertisin’
ourselves. We’ll poke up along Pareena
Creek. We’re hid there, well out of sight,
an’ no one won’t know what we’re doin’.
We’ll have dinner at th’ waterhole. We’ll
yard ’em about sundown. We’ll have a
night’s sleep—an’ we needs it. To-
morrow we’ll work. We’ve got our flock.
To-morrow, Barney, you an’ me’ll be
capitalists.”
The sheep were yarded overnight.
Early next morning the brothers com-
menced work. In the branding race Bill
carefully superimposed a red B over a
black L. As carefully, and with an
artistry worthy of a better purpose,
Barney placed the black T on the sheep.
He put it on lightly, to appear old and
worn ; he smudged it; he did several with
only the top bar of the T showing;
others were done with the T broken and
the tail of it missing. He viewed his
work with the pride which only a true
artist might feel. Though only an hour
or more old it required about half a day’s
sun and weather to play on it and those
T’s would appear faded and the work of
months past.
They had put through but two races
when men were seen riding up to the
house.
One was Donaldson, managing partner
of Moorstania; one was Jackson, his
overseer ; there were two stockmen and
two others unknown.
Donaldson dismounted, tied his horse
to the yard, and came to the race, lean-
ing his long length over to view the sheep.
“I’ve just come in time to save you
further work,” he said gently. “There’s
no need to brand any more.”
“These is th’ sheep we bought off Pirra-
pilla,” Bill blustered.
“The earmark is the same,” Donaldson
agreed. “Pirrapilla, though, don’t brand
with a black L. Their registered
brand is a P on the top of the shoulder.
They rarely brand their sheep, though.”
“Anyway, who give you th’ right to
come in here without notice?” Bill de-
manded. “You’re trespassin’. Get out!”
“Mr. Preston, the stock inspector, came
with me,” Donaldson explained gently,
almost sadly. “His position gives him
the right to enter any holding without
giving notice. I brought Mr. Wilson with
me also. He’s a justice of the peace. We
may need him in his official capacity.”
“These here,” Barney interrupted
blandly, “is some Moorstania stragglers
what got through out of Gumboil. We
was just brandin’ a few of our own an’
gettin’ th’ Moorstanias out.”
“That’s quite a good story,” Donaldson
agreed equably. “Lacks imagination,
though. We rode the Gumboil fence this
morning. I know what these sheep are,
and how they got here. I have a proposi-
tion to put before you. Accept it, or I
hand the matter over to the stock in-
spector and to the police.”
“What’s your idea?” Bill demanded.
“You cannot have sheep with a similar
earmark to that which we use on Moor-
stania,” Donaldson benevolently replied.
“You must admit, on the face of the
evidence produced, that you are not to
be trusted with that earmark. I’ll buy
your Pirrapilla sheep.”
“How much?”
“Seven shillings.”
“No damned good!” Bill exploded.
“We give nine an’ six for ’em. They’re
worth more’n that.”
“That’s two hundred and fifty pounds
you lose,” Donaldson murmured in a
purring voice. “It’s a lot of money to
two men just making a start. Still, it’s a
good deal less than the amount of the
fine and your legal expenses should you
refuse to accept my suggestion.”
“Take it, Bill,” Barney pleaded, being
made of weaker stuff.
Bill knew he was beaten. But he was
fighting a rearguard action.
“Make it seven an’ six,” he pleaded.
The deal was completed. The papers
were drawn up, signed and a deposit was
paid. Donaldson drew a paper from his
pocket.
“When I heard you’d bought these
ewes,” he continued in the same gentle
voice, “I got in touch with the manager
of Pirrapilla. I have here his telegram
authorising me to take over the lien on
the sheep. I only pay you three and six
a head for all delivered, of course. You
still owe three shillings on the sheep. That
three shillings is a matter between myself
and Gregory, the manager of Pirrapilla.”
“It’s a have!” Bill exploded. “It’s a
dirty, sneakin’, put-up job! That’s th’
way you capitalists keep th’ workin’ man
down. Anyway, I’d like to know who
squeaked.”
“No one.”
“Then how’d you drop on me so
quick?”
“I just remembered the axioms of our
copybooks during our school days.
Every effect has a cause. When you
bought those Pirrapillas I looked for the
cause, knowing you could get cheaper
sheep locally. I found the cause in the
directory of earmarks.”
“I could’ve told you that much if you’d
asked me,” Bill grumbled. “Anyone
knows that.”
“To prevent crime,” Donaldson con-
tinued in the same even voice, “one must
have a knowledge of crime, and —er —
nothing personal, you know —also of
criminals.”
“Set a thief to catch a thief,” Barney
sneered.
“Exactly,” Donaldson agreed affably.
“I see you also have been improving your
mind by reading the copybooks. That
set a thief to do ditto is good stuff. I
commend it to your consideration. You
see, I was trained in a pretty tough
school. I could guess the reason behind
your Pirrapilla purchase. I wasn’t going to
waste both time and money watching you.
I brought things to a head immediately: 1
put the sheep beside you straight away.”
“You baited me?”
“Y-e-s, I believe that is the correct
term to use. I did. I was going to prove
one thing or the other. Yesterday morn-
ing I saw tracks of sheep rounded up on
the Molar fence. I saw tracks of horses
outside them. That particularly drew my
attention to the thing—though I’ll admit
I was looking for it.”
“Those tracks might’ve been made by
bush horses,” Bill stated.
“A bush horse,” Donaldson continued
softly, “no matter what it is doing, in-
variably leaves its manure dropped in
one heap. I noted a scattered line of
manure outside those sheep tracks. It
was a ridden horse! The rest is so
simple that I’ll not bore you with details.
That bag trick to blind tracks is a very
old thing, dating perhaps from the Ark.
But you made another mistake.”
“Where?” Bill demanded truculently.
“You forced the sheep over the bag-
ging. You should have let them string
quietly. You jambed them, and they
left wisps of wool hanging to the bark
of the post. After that, of course, it was
merely a matter of tracking them here.”
“You couldn’t!” Bill shouted exul-
tantly. “Th’ Strathbyans come through
after them —that is, them Strathbyans
come through yesterday mornin’ early.”
“They didn’t,” Donaldson corrected
him. “Like yourself, I thought this was
a good time to buy sheep. I bought the
Strathbyans for Moorstania. They turned
back from the Poolpoothra Holes. Your
track from Molar here was as plain as a
road. In fact, it was plainer: I knew
where to go!”
“You’re smart, ain’t you?” Barney
jeered.
“I used to be considered so,” Donald-
son admitted regretfully. “The activity
which has been sapped by age has been
ripened by experience. Where I lose on
one I gain by the other, as it were. In
fact, I proved the smartness of experience
by my purchase of the Strathbyan sheep.
I have a telegram from my agents. They
say wool has hardened twenty per cent,
on a firm and rising market. That means
sheep will increase in value at least five
shillings a head.”
“Hell!” the Ridgeboards exclaimed in
unison.
“It will be for you,” Donaldson agreed.
“With your depleted finances you’ll have
a job to buy sheep at the advanced price.
Still, you can always start in a small way.
Come, though ; we’re wasting time. Let
us muster these sheep I’ve just bought
from you. We’ll box ’em with the Moor-
stanias now in the yard. I have a peculiar
and pressing desire to see them all at
home on Moorstania.”

The Sniper.
BY FRANK DALBY DAVISON.
IN his camp below the ironbark ridge
at Lannigan’s Pocket, Dice Chaseling,
who had a contract to split fence-
posts for Old Man Guilfoyle, was clean-
ing his rifle. He was seated on a kero-
sene-case, just outside his tent. His pipe
was in his mouth, the smoke issuing
from his lips at methodic intervals.
Leila, his wife, sat on an upturned bucket
near by watching him.
The light was poor. The sun had gone
down. Its afterglow was still in the
sky ; and the risen moon had not yet
gained strength. Dice paid no heed to the
poor visibility. He acted as if he had
cats’ eyes. Though he worked systemati-
cally, his thoughts were not on what he
was doing, but on an event that he ex-
pected the passage of time soon to dis-
charge.
The weapon that he used with fondling
hands was the familiar short Lee-Enfield
.303 bore. It was regarded with some
disfavor by kangaroo-shooters of his
acquaintance, for several reasons; but
he had an affection for it. It had been
his in France, in the days when it was
exhilarating sport to devise invisible open-
ings in the sandbags, and to lie behind
them for half a day at a time, watching,
over open sights, for a chance to send
another man to eternity. He had been
one of his battalion’s snipers. He had
souvenired the rifle at the close of the
war, sneaking it home dismantled.
The truth was that Dice’s rifle didn’t
need a rag near it. He was just marking
time, his nerves strung up to a delicate
pitch of anticipation. He was reminded
of the times he had crept over the sand-
bags in the twilight—except that the ele-
ment of danger was missing. All day,
as he worked with axe and saw and
maul, he had been living in the events
that he hoped the night would bring to
pass. Dropping the pull-through down
the gleaming bore of the Lee-Enfield and
wiping out the speckless breach was the
merest sop to strained patience.
He looked around him. It was about
time to be moving. He put the cleaning
tricks into the old baking-powder tin in
which he kept them, and took them into
the tent. He returned with one cart-
ridge in his hand, slipped it into the
breech and turned the safety catch.
He drew a last few puffs from his
pipe, knocked the ashes out against his
heel, put the pipe in his pocket and,
with a word of farewell to Leila,
went across to the dray where Lassie,
the red kelpie, was tethered with a length
of greenhide to one of the wheel-spokes.
The little bitch fawned, with her tail
brushing the earth in swift strokes as he
stooped to untie her. She whined her
delight at receiving his attention, her
hazel eyes brightening. Thrusting her
pointed muzle against his arms and try-
ing frantically to lick his hands, she made
it difficult for him to untie her. Flat-
tered by her obsequiousness, he cuffed
her good-naturedly into quietness, re-
leased her and stuffed the greenhide strap
into his pocket.
With Lassie trotting at his heels, as
soft-footed and alert as a little fox,
Chaseling took the track that led up the
Five-Mile Gully and passed over the
divide. On the top of the ridge the smell
of wool and ammonia drew his atten-
tion to a mob of Guilfoyle’s merinos
camped under a clump of wilgas. He
made a short detour to avoid disturbing
them. A quarter of an hour’s walk from
there, through dry bluegrass standing
like wheat straw, brought him to the
sandalwood and hopbush scrub that
crowned a rise overlooking the Old
Sheepwash.
It was now night, brightly moonlit,
still and chilly. There would be a light
frost before morning, thought Dice as
he stood looking about him. The box
forest, its tree-trunks silvery in the moon-
light, and the ground beneath the
branches barred with shadows, came
right to the edge of the scrub. The
grass, just where he stood, was too tall
and thick for what he had in mind.
As noiselessly as he could, he made
his way along the black margin of the
scrub until he came to a place where a
tongue of earth, barren and grassless,
ran out into the forest. He took the
length of greenhide from his pocket,
stooped, tied Lassie to the butt of a
slender sandalwood that stood by itself
in the centre of the bare, moonlit ground,
and walked on.
Lassie sat on her haunches, her vel-
vety ears pricked forward, her head on
one side, looking after him ; at a loss to
understand such behavior. She got up
and tried to follow him; felt the tug
of the greenhide, and sat down again.
She whined to call his attention to the
astonishing thing he had done. He paid
no attention. She yapped shrilly, twice,
imperatively. No result! She lay down
with her head on her forepaws, her tail
straight out in the dust behind, looking
in the direction he had gone.
Lassie was, like all kelpies, highly
strung, with brains under her broad,
thin-boned skull. She could think, within
her limits. The boss seemed to know
what he had done! She got up and faced
toward the camp, sitting on her tail, her
head again on one side, ears sharply
pricked. As the boss didn’t seem to want
her company she would have liked to
go home. But she was much too sen-
sible to tug at the greenhide. Her
tongue lolled and she panted a little with
impatience. She got up and looked again
in the direction the boss had gone, listen-
ing for returning footsteps.
Well, she’d have to put up with it! She
lay down again with her head resting on
her paws ; her ears tuned to catch any
sound puncturing the dead stillness of the
moonlit bush. He’d come back in the
time of his own choosing. She felt no
resentment. It was just that his ways
sometimes took him beyond the circum-
ference of her understanding.
For an hour she kept her mind in a
condition of waiting and expectancy, all
other thought being excluded. Then, a
little at a time, consideration of herself
took possession of her. She was of much
importance to herself, just at present. She
was feeling the yearning for company
that regularly came upon her. And it
was just at these times that the boss tied
her up.
Usually she trotted at the boss’s
heels wherever he went; to other people’s
camps, and even to town. But as sure
as she felt, in her own inwardness, a wish
to meet with her kind, she found herself
tied to the wheel of the dray. Then, if
the boss saddled his horse and rode out
of camp, he left her behind. Neither
was she allowed to have visitors at the
camp.
Only last night a dog had come from
another camp to see her. It had pro-
mised to be a most thrilling meeting.
She had whined with excitement. And,
almost at once, the boss had come run-
ning from his tent. He had thrown
things at the visitor, shouted after him
when he ran away, and taken her into
the tent and tied her to the leg of his
bunk.
Such things would go on, she knew,
until, for reasons she made no attempt to
understand, she no longer cared whether
she ever saw any other of her kind. Then
she would be let loose again to run about
as she wished.
The hours went by.
The little black blob of shadow which
had been on the homeward side of the
slender sandalwood where Lassie was
tied had passed to the opposite side,
when she sat up, pricking her ears toward
the depth of the scrub. There was a
dog in there! She hadn’t heard him ;
but she knew he was there. And, further-
more, he knew where she was. It was
that knowledge that had brought him
through the scrub.
She pushed her sharp little nose for-
ward, shifted her forepaws impatiently,
and whined softly. Excitement! He had
come closer; she couldn’t see him as
yet. She kept shifting her head from
side to side with a little twitchy motion,
her eyes wide and staring into the
shadows.
He was in there; so close that he
could see her. He was watching her
from his place of concealment. She
wished that he would come out and talk
things over. She was a dancing bundle
of nerves at that moment. She whined,
more loudly than she had done before ;
and her heart jumped when she heard
an answering whine from the scrub. In
that moment she forgot that she was tied.
She would trot away and he would fol-
low ; that was the natural way of things.
She started to go, and was pulled up
short by the tug of the greenhide strap.
She sat down, tongue lolling, drawing
it in only to whine her eagerness.
The dog had come to the extreme edge
of the scrub. He was there, just a few
feet away ; standing half in moonlight,
half in shadow. A big fellow! But he
didn’t move. He was wondering why
she didn’t run from him. Something not
understood, therefore to be feared.
Lassie was beside herself. She sat up
and whined. She lay down with her
head on her paws. She got up and trotted
to the length of the greenhide. She sat
again, and waited.
He was moving. A slow, short step at
a time! Head thrust forward, nose sniff-
ing warily. Sense of time was suspended
as he came slowly from the scrub and
stood over her, full in the moonlight.
Their muzzles met in mute inquiry.
Ecstasy! She was flattened to the ground,
quivering from nose to tail.
An explosion near at hand blasted the
night. Lassie sat up with pricked ears.
She saw the dog walk a pace or two and
then lie in a most unusual position; and
she saw the boss step from behind a tree
close by.
Dice lit his pipe and drew on it with
a sense of luxury. Five hours is a long
time to wait without a smoke. He
picked up his rifle from where he had
leaned it against the tree-trunk after
firing, and crossed the twenty-odd yards
to the two animals. He leaned the rifle
in the fork of the sandalwood, stooped
to pat Lassie, and then turned to examine
the dead dog.
Lassie, all else forgotten in her delight
over the return of the boss, tried to
prance all over him. She strained at the
greenhide, put her forepaws on his back
and whined in his ear.
Dice ran his fingers through the dog’s
thick sable coat. He turned him over,
examining with curiosity the dark hair —
evidence of some stolen love in a year
gone by.
He drew out his knife and set to work
with quick, practised hands. Dammed
back until now, a flood of jubilance
surged through him. It was a bit of luck
that he’d crossed the tracks leading back
from the waterhole in the Five-Mile
Gully this morning and had glanced up
in time to see him sneaking into the
scrub!
He laid down his pipe, the better to
concentrate on what he was doing. Forty
quid this was worth, with Guilfoyle’s
.bounty and McAllister’s added together.
There’d be some excitement in the morn-
ing when he went from homestead to
homestead with the “black dingo’s” pelt
at his saddle-bow. The sheep-killer had
fallen to him!
He paused a moment. He’d leave the
head and paws in the skin; someone
might like to have it mounted and soft-
tanned for a rug.
Dice finished his work with swift
strokes, wiped his knife on his trouser-
leg, and put it in his pocket. He left
the carcass lying.
With the Lee-Enfield over his left
shoulder, Lassie trotting in happiness
and innocence at his heels, and the trophy
that had been a dog dangling from his
right hand, he started for home.
Fle’d be able to buy Leila that sulky
and fony she’d been wanting.

Theatrical Slump.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
IN high excitement Ginger stormed
into the shop, glared at Giuseppa
behind the counter, and raised his
hat.
“I say, Seppa,” he began ; “this cove
Paravane”
The sight of her halted him in sudden
half-embarrassed mildness. “Well,” he
continued, “you got back then.”
“You see me,” she reminded him.
“How are you?”
“All right,” he said, watching her. “All
right”
The dark fruits that made Ettore
Scala’s shop so rich a garden of dreams
for Will Drummond meant nothing to
Ginger to-day. The heavy plum-bloom,
the half-sulky gloss of the nectarines be-
side the yellow banner of the oranges,
the passion-fruit—these had been part
of the dream of seeing Giuseppa Scala.
The lustre, even the perfume, became
somehow her eyes, her voice, the shadow
of her hair. But to-day he knew nothing
of them:. Seppa herself was the thing.
Seppa doing what she wanted to do, and
separated from all dreams.
“Goulburn is a big place,” she was
saying, “and different from the ’Loo”
“I shouldn’t wonder,” he interrupted,
“but I was telling you—this cove Para-
vane has taken a flat in the new block
in Brazier-street, opposite the store”
“Do you mean Charles Paravane, the
actor-manager, the English actor?” The
dark power in Seppa’s voice filled the
shop with her awed surprise. “What is
he doing in a flat in the ’Loo?”
“Some mate of his owns the block,”
he explained. “Besides, he isn’t Eng-
lish —he’s Australian. Used to room in
the ’Loo before he went to London in
about his first solid job, donkey’s years
ago. He comes over to the store and
yarns with dad most evenings”-
“Charles Paravane yarns with Marty
most evenings!”.... There was wonder
now in the vibrant, deep voice. “The
Hamlet, the King Lear”....
This was the burden on Ginger’s
shoulders. Herein were they separate
from all dreams: Seppa who play-acted
all day long to the applause of her
father and the anger of her Australian
mother, and Ginger Marty’s adopted son
who worked in the Brazier-street store.
“That’s the bloke,” he agreed curtly.
“And my idea was this: you know that
old woman you do, the old, starving
deadbeat whose daughter’s baby dies
and so in a few years there’ll be nothing
more of her on earth”
Immediately Seppa’s beauty fled. She
was sallow, frail, beaten, old —old as
Death; her shadowy hair seemed to
straggle, grey and lifeless ; she hunched
wretchedly against the counter; her
voice was dry and old. “The monologue
Will Drummond made me —yes, I know
that, of course.”
“Or the one of the girl going to be
married against her will, out of the con-
vent —that might be better,” Ginger said
thoughtfully. “Or you might do some-
thing new, on the spur”
“Ginger!” Like a sword of fire her
voice cut through his thoughts. “You
make riddles, mysteries. Tell me!”
“Well,” he apologised, “I was thinking
—you see, this cove comes in about clos-
ing-time ; he’s done it three nights
already. And he yarns with dad (he
seems to like dad) about the old ’Loo
and where the schoolhouse was and
where the steps used to be. And I
thought you could blow in one closing-
time and —and do one of your stunts
and he’d wangle a job for you.”
“You mean —enter the store as that
old grandmother, or that poor girl who
wants only to stay with God? Play it to
him?”
“Yes,” he sighed, “that’s what I mean,
Seppa. And then you’d get your chance
and —and be on your way. See?”
In silence she looked at her long, thin
hands, and up again at him. “Thank you,
Ginger,” she said.
For a weak moment the shop was
again the garden of dreams as he touched
one of the hands. “These cows in Syd-
ney won’t listen to you, won’t look at
you”
“A theatrical slump, they say. If I
were Duse and Bernhardt in one they
could not make me a place in the chorus,
they say. There are no choruses in the
theatrical slump”
“Well, who wants ’em?” Ginger’s
casual scorn hardened up the weak
moment. “This cove’ll soon find some-
thing that isn’t in the chorus. And he
could be the big boss o’ the lot if he
liked— he’s not here in Sydney for his
health, whatever he says.”
But Seppa had forgotten him. “On my
way,” she was saying, her voice soft
with a dark intoning, “London, New
York —all those million hearts to make
weep, to make laugh, to fill with
thoughts.... No more a narrow street in
the ’Loo—on my way”....
The shop, deep in all these colors and
blooms and perfumes, burned in the
longing in her voice. Slipping away, even
now, far away, before this man had even
seen or heard her
“You’ll be gone pretty soon, if the
luck holds,” he said, making a thorough
job of it. “I sh’d think it was a cer-
tainty. You’ll be in another world, Seppa.
You won’t see this shop or this street
any more—you won’t see any of us —
any more.”
Seeing her face he could believe it was
the house of dreams again, for this frail
moment. Yet her own strong dream had
faded from her startled eyes. “Not see
you again,” she murmured, watching
him. “No more”
“Not likely,” he mocked. “I’ll be
humping me basket and listening to dad
and mother- —serving Denis with cheese
and butter on the nod.” He laughed at
her grave, still face. “Well, how about
it—we’ll give it a go, eh?”
“Yes” She was still watching him.
“Yes... .of coarse”....
“Goodoh. I’ll leave the stunt part of
it to you—that’s your end. Somewhere
round six is the time ; and the cove —
you can't mistake him”
“I know his face like my own.”
“Well, then, there it is,” he told her,
all the misery and loss on earth sweeping
into the glowing perfumed shop.
And the streets, the fagged, empty
streets, and himself toiling along them
alone. The dust on the pavements, in
his mouth, in his heart.
Anyhow, there it was. She’d be on
her way. There was Snowy Stevens’s
parcel to leave and old Mrs. Laurie’s
order to take.... On her way.... He
could be back at the store by ten to six,
if he stepped on it.
Marty smiled and nodded as Ginger
came in and continued to talk to the tall
cove. The clock said seven minutes to
six as Ginger put his basket under the
counter.
“All that top end was pretty slummish
in my day,” the tall cove was saying,
“but there were some very nice bits in
it. There was one chap who had a
garden there—the front of his house was
wistaria in the spring”
“I remember it,” Marty said. “Put
out the back lights, Ginger, will y0u?....
It was old Collett’s place in those days
—his daughter married Peter Boyd and
went up-country”
Did she? Ginger switched off the
back lights, glanced into the smallgoods
cage, turned a bottle of sauce round
back to front, glanced into the small-
goods cage again. Nervous work, this.
At any moment she might turn up.
“You might get the shutters now,
Ginger, and be putting them up,” Marty
said. “Boyd made a lot of money”
Ginger flew out into the yard for the
shutters, had them up, and in record time
was back -in the store again making jobs
for himself. The tall cove’s voice
was rolling and booming round the
darkened store, warm with its mellow
charm ; he was persuading you all the
time. Goodoh. Ginger glanced at the
open doorway. He’d hear something in
a minute or two that would persuade
him, for a change.
“But it doesn’t seem to me that the
’Loo really alters at all, in spite of what
20 years can do to it.” The mellow,
clean-cut words became a warm, soft
laugh, which was put on and yet was
sincere, as Ginger read it. “Like the sea,
it is changeless.”
The rich echoes of this were not dead
when a shadow darkened the doorway.
Ginger slipped up to the top end of the
counter (to look for his duster) and stood
waiting. Now they’d see something.
The shadow drifted into the store. It
became a man, a little trembling desolate
man in an overcoat, though the night
was \Varm. Ginger caught his breath ;
this was a new 0ne....
The man drifted to the counter,
touched the slouch hat pulled down over
his eyes, and looked at the counter-top
in front of Marty.
“Er—good evening,” he whispered.
“Though how I’m in time I don’t
know It seems to be midnight to
me.” His toneless whisper was as pene-
trating as Paravane’s silken voice. “May
I have some cigarettes? Three Queens,
please.”
Marty put the packet on the counter.
“Thank you.” The little desolate man
stared at the packet a moment before his
trembling hand put a shilling beside it.
Even then he didn’t pick up>the cigarettes,

What Hollywood Doctors
say
Skilful doctors, in whose hands is the health of
famous high-salaried film stars, agree that many
common ailments, physical and mental lassitude,
bad complexion and lack of charming person-
ality are caused by autoxima (self-poisoning).
Autoxima is the direct result of hidden con-
stipation, and many people, ill in health to-day,
do not realise that they suffer from this serious
complaint. Yet it can effectively be overcome.
Faulty bowel action results in particles of food
waste becoming encrusted on the walls of the
intestine and even though evacuation is regular,
the intestine may still be partially clogged. Therein
lies the real source of disease and sickness a
dreaded danger, because it is so seldom suspected.

but looked abruptly up at Marty. Ginger
saw that his dark eyes were full of woe
—and horror. Despite his knowledge,
Ginger shuddered at these terrified eyes.
“You do well here, don’t you?” the life-
less whisper asked Marty.
Marty shruggd his shoulders and
smiled, though he too had felt the horror
of the dark, haunted gaze upon him. “I
work hard,” he said.
“Yes. You work hard —you all work
hard, being alive”....
A mantle of dreadful solitude seemed
to be upon him, as if he had no fellow-
men but was alone in shame and woe
in a darkness of his own making.
In the shocked silence he peered, shak-
ing so that his teeth chattered softly, at
Ginger, at Marty again, at Paravane. His
lost, half-animal gaze paused at Paravane.
“I know you,” he whispered, staring
at the actor’s strong, handsome head. “I
know y0u”.... A horrible laugh stole
into the store, mocking and sly, and
making him seem smaller and frailer.
“You are Charles Paravane. I saw you
act in London. I was on the same pro-
gramme—it was a Hospital Matinee. I
sang”.... The" foul laugh floated softly
into the air again like a thousand
whimpering bats. “I sang” ....
He took the cigarettes from the
counter.
“That was long ago, when I was alive,
too. Before I was a dead snow-bird”....
Ginger saw that mother had come to
the living-room doorway and was stand-
ing there, her eyes dark with pity.
The little man put the cigarettes in his
overcoat pocket. “Don’t ever try cocaine
for the extra kick,” he whispered to
Paravane. “Nor you,” he turned to
Marty. “Nor you,” he turned to Ginger.
“It’s your duty to stay alive.” His
whisper drifted with him to the d00r....
“My God!” Paravane squared his
shoulders and took a breath. “Thank
God that’s over! What a visitation”....
His breezy relief brought the store to life
again. “Poor devil! I wonder” He
stared at the empty doorway.
Marty’s deep sigh was full of pity.
“Poor hopeless man”....
Paravane shrugged his shoulders. “I
wonder,” he said thoughtfully, “who he
is. One can’t remember all the”
Ginger came out into the light. “I’ll
tell you,” he said watching them. “He’s
Giuseppa Scala. Seppa, old Scala’s
daughter”....
“Daughter?”.... Paravane peered at
this young man. “But”
“But, Ginger” Marty’s astounded
voice began.
“I’ll tell you,” Ginger repeated curtly.
“We fixed it up, Seppa and I, for her
to do one of her stunts here to-night.”
He looked at Paravane. “So’s you’d see
what she could do. She’s mad for the
stage, and the Sydney cows won’t look
at her or listen to her. So we
thought”
“Are you telling me,” the great voice
thundered indignantly, “that this—this
tragic waif was a girl ?”
“That’s what I’m telling you. We fixed
it—T told you. I know her—known her
all me life. It was to get a chance from
you, a big man on the stage. It’s
straight”.... Ginger’s anxious gaze
searched his face.
“My God!” Paravane said again in
his deep amazement. “That horrible little
nothing of a man —the atmosphere she
built up all that whispering to
keep her voice 0ut”.... He stood in
thought a moment. “Stage?” he turned
vigorously to Ginger. “I should think
so,” he said, his voice full of energy
instead of charm. “Ask her to come and
see me, if she cares to”
These streets again, empty, desolate as
Seppa’s snow-bird, and his feet going
swiftly along them to tell her the job was
done. He knew it was a certainty
Soon she would be gone. He wouldn’t
be belting hell-for-leather past these
houses to tell her any job was done. He
set his jaw. Last lap, he told himself,
pushing open the shop-door.
The perfumes rose at him from all the
shining colors, but he marched through
them to the counter.
Here Ettore Scala sat, grey-faced,
heavy with anger and sorrow. He glared
in black silence at Ginger, as at a
noisome fly almost invisible to his monu-
mental misery.
“Where’s Seppa?” Ginger asked.
Ettore’s vast shoulders slipped up to
his ears and down again. He lost his
faint interest in this fly, and returned to
the ledger on the counter.
“Where’s Seppa, Mr. Scala?” Ginger
demanded.
“In her room.” Ettore laboriously
changed a nought into an eight in the
book. “Col’ feet,” he added.
“Cold feet?”
Ettore looked up, gazed at Ginger
for a heavy moment like a mountainous
snake about to strike. Presently he did
so, leaning forward to threaten Ginger
with his pen. “Dis,” he growled. “Seppa
is great ac-tress —you know dat. One
chance —only one —and prrrt! Napoli,
Roma, Londra. A million pounds”....
Murderous arabesques with the pen made
this clear. Ettore’s eyes bulged suddenly.
“To-night— to-night!” he vociferated,
“dis one chance comes. A biga-da-mans
—Paravan, Caravan, what do I know —
will hear her, see her act, dis great
ac-tress. And then?”
Ginger made no reply to the question
thundered at him.
“Then” —Ettore dropped the pen and
shook his fist in Ginger’s face—“then —
she won’ go! An hour ago, fly to her
room, locka-de-door, weep,” his flutter-
ing hands were an ocean of tears. Sud-
denly he winced, his voice a faint squeak.
“I’m frightened,” he squealed in scorn,
“I am great ac-tress but I’m frightened
—I can’ g 0 .... My one chance can go
hropa-da-hell”
“She didn’t go?” Ginger whispered.
“She didn’t see this cove Paravane
Then that snow-bird”.... He stared at
Ettore. “She didn’t go,” he repeated.
“I tol’ you,” Ettore said wearily. “Col’
feet”
But Ginger was out of the shop, run-
ning up the stairs, knocking at Seppa’s
door.
“Yes?” a lifeless voice asked.
“It’s me —Ginger. Open the d00r”....
Her eyes were stars in the half-dark
of the landing.
“What’s the matter —why didn’t you
go? You weren’t afraid!”
“Yes, I was.” The stars watching him
were very bright.
“What you! Afraid you’d fail?”
“No, Ginger. Afraid I would —sue-
ceed”
The stars leaned closer now, so that
even Ginger could read their message.
“But,” he stammered, “you’d give up
your work, your acting?”....
She shook her head. “No. Always I
act, while I am alive. But for you only,
Ginger.” She laughed softly. Perhaps
often I make you the big scene, eh?”
Pinchgut.
EVERY day, as sure as one o’clock
arrives, the gun on Fort Denison (col-
loquially Pinchgut) booms out and
the North and South Heads stand at atten-
tion. In spite of the greeny shoots
around its tower, the stone island seems
austere and forbidding to the passer-by
in the ferries. Actually it is one of the
jolliest spots washed by the blue waters
of Port Jackson. Every bit of it that
isn’t tower and living-quarters is garden.
Gladioli, hippeastrum and roses blow
bravely about the caretaker’s dwelling.
The tomatoes and lettuces are coming
along nicely. The fig-tree on the way to
the tower is thick with ripening fruit, and
the lemon-tree is a sprightly young thing
with plump offspring.
Every Saturday two or three launch-
loads of visitors call at the fort, climb
down to the powder-room and up the
stairways cut into the stone to the tower.
This was originally built around the
guns; and they were obsolete, it is said,
before the stonework was completed.
The domed ceiling in this room is alone
worth a visit; the stonemason’s art in
1859 was something to make eyes used
to concrete and plaster blink in wonder-
ment. The brass rum-measures, high out
of reach of the souvenir-hunter, are the
pride of the place. There’s a Gargantuan
one, they tell you, that was the
sergeant’s ; the small half-pints, they add,
were for the privates. In the basement
of the tower there’s a marvellous chart
whose recordings of the tides are pub-
lished in the papers every day so that
harbor-dwellers with swimming pools
will know when to set the alarm clock
to get the benefit of high tide for their
morning dip.
But the most curious and pleasant of
all Nature’s gifts to this stone fastness is
a spring of fresh water.
Beyond To-morrow.
You asked me, dear, when our troth was
plighted,
“Will you love me still when the years grow
grey,
When the song is hushed and the rose is
blighted?”
And I laughed, and I led your, thoughts
away.
The fiercest flame leaves the fewest ashes,
And I dared not hope that my love would
last;
The wildest wind while the thunder crashes
Leaves the deepest calm when the storm has
passed.
Yet strange are the ways of the fates that sever
The heart from the heart most cherished;
Mine was the love that endured for ever,
Yours was the love that perished!

Nine out of every ten persons suffer more or less
from Liver Complaint. That feeling of “No energy”
and “Not too well” are but symptoms of a weak and
disordered system. Weak because the whole vitality
is absorbed, inactive kidneys, and constipated bowels.
For not only is the Liver the largest and one of the
most important organs in the human body, but when
deranged it becomes a source of endless suffering.
When the Liver is clogged by the inactivity of the
Kidneys and Bowels it becomes torpid, and fails to filter
the bile from .the blood, thus producing Biliousness and
a genera! impairment of the digestive system.
There is little use of treating the Liver separately, as
it can never be set right until the Kidneys and Bowels
are made active in removing the waste matter from the
blood. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching,
cleansing remedy. They put a move in your Bowels,
life into the Liver, and tone the Stomach—thus bracing
up the system generally.

Worms
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN
HOW TO TREAT THEM.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels; generally occasion pain or uneasiness
in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing and biting, and not infrequently
of a vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the Nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is charac-
teristic of the affection. The Bowels are often
disordered, sometimes relaxed, as in Dysentery,
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently alter-
nating with another. The Abdomen is often
hard, swollen, and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the sleep
are other characteristic symptoms. The effects,
however, often extend beyond the Alimentary
Canal, and various derangements of health
are experienced in consequence, either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the dis-
ordered digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous affec-
tions, such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed- sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ment of the eyelids, dilated pupils, perverted
vision, temporary blindness and deafness.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones are suffering
intense pain and distress, and are practically
irresponsible for the outbursts of temper, rest-
lessness and peevishness, and until some more
serious symptoms appear nothing is done to
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of this
disease are somewhat variable, but generally
they are so characteristic that no mother
need have any doubts. The best proof of
worms is worms, and if the general conduct
of the child is such as to give the slightest
suspicion a careful watch will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an
indifferent state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper. Another point
to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation com-
pounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels,’ and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they would
an ordinary sweet.
Obtainable at all chemists and stores or

We’re still talking about something
that happened eighteen years ago!
THIS
WILLARD
THREADED
RUBBER
INSULATOR
In 1915, T. A. Willard discovered and
patented this Threaded Rubber Insu-
lator. Until that year, all Willard
Batteries were made with wooden
Insulators.
These had been found satistactory,
but T. A. Willard wanted the perfect
insulator* He wanted one that would
outlive the battery plates. One with a
higher resistance to the battery acids
than wood. One with greater porosity.
In short, he wanted an insulator that
would enable the Willard Battery to
develop its maximum power!
He found it in Rubber the perfect
Battery Insulator! Now, due to this
Patented Willard Threaded Rubber
Insulator, the Willard Battery gives
longer life, requires less upkeep, is
thoroughly dependable, gives better
starting under all conditions and
more miles of uninterrupted service.
You can have these definite advantages
—see your local Willard dealer!

This illustration explains the
Porosity of the Rubber Insulator .
Porosity simply means free flow of the
battery acids through the separator be-
tween each positive and negative plate.
The illustration above shows clearly the
tiny threads or wicks which by capillary
action carry the acid through. There are
5,000 of these wicks to the square inch in
the Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator!
This means easier and quicker starting for
you. Practically 85 °/c of all battery faults
are due to premature failure of conven-
tional insulators. Use a Willard Thread
Rubber Battery.
No Wood in a Willard Thread Rubber
Battery!
Hard usage, vibration, and the result of over-
charging often wear out wooden insulators be-
fore the battery plates have been used up. This
is the most common fault of battery failure.
Insure yourself with a Willard Thread Rubber.
More Willards are sold than any other make!
