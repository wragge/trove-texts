Writers of Young France.
nyyow these are passages from the wit
I and wisdom, the style and culture of
Vance Thompson—
. . . Marie Krysinka, a Polish Jewess, who pounded
melodramatic music out of the piano, and was a poetess
whose peculiar passion was corpses and snow. ... I
heard afterwards that she married an archeologist—or
was it a manufacturer of wooden toothpicks ?
. . . [Verlaine’s] face was like the mask of Socrates, with
its high cheek-bones and simian mouth. The nose was
flat, camous, broken ; the great bald head covered with
knobs, like a battered helmet; a draggled beard hung
about the cheeks and chin; the ears were flat and
large. The eyes, those deep-set, dreamy, intolerably
vague eyes, glowered at one from beneath rugged, square,
hewn brows. ,
. . . And it is a moon pale as an agonising tree ; a%d it
is a moon all-weary, so old it is, a very old moon, a moon
before Christ, a moon that saw the antique Pan die and
Hylas die among the white nymphs in the fountain ; and
it is a moon of La Jeunesse,
. . . the renewing soil and obliterating sea, those eter-
nal protests against civilisation.
. . . Georges Rodenbach always summons for me a pic-
ture of a white Beguin ni\n passing tlirough some dark
mediaeval street oil a white errand. . . . Re wrote like a
man who had an orchid in his button-hole and the fear of
God in his heart.
... The ideal wife for the painter, the musician, or the
mari-of-letters is the matter-of-fact woman. She Should have
an animal-like somnolence and stolidity in which he might
rest as in a mental feather-bed. The artist is more of less
irresponsible ; he is full of irritancies. His work demands
of him a certain intensity, which, when the strain is over,
lapses into peevishness, or at all events, into weakness.
In these moments he does not want the counter-irritant
of a woman’s hrilliancy. He wants a mental feather-bed.
[This after Daudet. To point it: Not a pepper-wife ; a
pillow-wife.]
. . . When a good woman is dead she is dead forever.
It is only by her vices that a woman can cheat oblivion.
... Great art is always virile. The slim pallidities of
Fra Angelico belong to a day of degenerate and monkish
thought. Rubens’s great blond women are the solaces
of the eternal fighting man. And if the great artist has
always been virile and wholesome, he has also been the
broad, spendthrift, Rabelaisian man—spendthrift of his
golden fancy, his wit, his heart, his intelligence. He has
not chiselled a sonnet —like Mallarm6—and called himself
a poet; like Homer, like Shakspere, like Goethe, like Ti tian,
like Rubens and Da Vinci and Angelo, he has poured forth
a rich and golden stream, which only death could dam.
I do not think that there is a better example of the,essen-
tial prodigality of the great artist than Rubens—not even
Shakspere, who dowered the world with so much intellec-
tual magnificence. And I like to think of Rubens
sitting in his garden (while his handsome wife sipped a
glass of wine, and his handsome children frolicked with
the peacocks), and sketching out, before breakfast, a
masterpiece.
. . . How did Jean Richepin and Sarah Bernhardt fall in
love ? It was very simple. They met one night in the
Rue des Martyrs. He saw her pass, accompanied by her
maid. Her hair shone red and gold in the lamplight. He
caught her in his arms and kissed her. Sarah turned on
him furiously, and struck him iu the face. They black-
guarded each other. It was very simple ; it was love.
• * » »
Piquant ? Pregnant ? Of such passages and
others Vance Thompson’s book is made up. For
literary people, you may say it is the most attrac-
tive book printed this year. The title: “ French
Portraits.” The matter : Just what you want to
know about the most interesting bevy of bards
and story-tellers on a planet—those of young
France, young Belgium ; where literature is a
fever, poetry a triumph and a despair, and the
cadence of a lin6, the colour of a phrase, are (for
some) the only things in the universe which a man
need bother his head about. And the book is full
of pictures—sketches, likenesses, of Verlaine and
Verhaeren and Rette and Jammes, Eekhoud and
Maeterlinck, Catulle Mendes and Albert Samain
— toute la lyre et la timbale. A joy of a book.
Vance Thompson was recently stigmatised as
one of the three men who (in English)
write best about young French writers (James
and Gosse have \ grown elderly and counted
out). Another man knows most about the
books, and one of the men is most in tune with
the spirit of some of the books. Vance Thompsou
is the third man : he knows most about the
writers—their walks, their talks, their clothes,
their looks, their private lives. He imitates
Macaulay’s dexterous Capuchin —■ arouses in-
terest by bringing you a shred of his sin-
ner’s garment, a sip of his absinthe, a drop
of his blood. Who is Vance Thompson ? I have
no exact data. He seems to be an American col-
lege student, graduate of journalism, wanderer in
Bohemia (? with a small income to round
VANCE THOMPSON.
Bohemia’s rough edge, and make him plump and
jolly in an atmosphere of persiflage and cigarettes
—vide Sketch). For the most part he lives in Paris,
rubbing elbows with the men he writes about. His
age?—porhaps3s. Hisculture—wide, on a decently
solid basis, His tastes —literary, artistic, musical:
His judgment (lie calls Verlaine “the greatest
poet of this generation,” Verhaeren “ the greatest
French poet of this day ” —he agrees with Me)—
good, decidedly. Mayhap there is a touch of
Boston in him : though he cries for the Rabelaisian
outlook he does not fully appreciate Pierre Louys,
does not recognise the compensations of Zola:
maybe there is a touch of Boston prig in him—
forget it: he atones.
And in “French Portraits ” he talks of nearly
all the men one wants to know about “over there.”
Consider his list—
Verlaine Camille Lemonnier
Mallarme • Maeterlinck
Mend&s Verhaeren .
Mordas Eekhond
Rette Max Elskatnp
Henri de Regnier Rodenbach
Stuart. Merrill Fernand Severin
Viete-Griffin Pierre Louys
Signoret Richepin,
Albert Samain Jehan Rictus
Jules Renard Francis Jammes
Paul Fort Marcel Sehwob
■ St.-Georges de Bouhtilier Montesquieu Fezensac
Ernest la Jeunesse.
All these ; and others incidentally. The mere
list makes' one’s mouth- water. All of these
Thompson has, seen ; he has read their books ;
with most of them he has spoken and fraternised.
And lie gives his impressions lightly, not too
learnedly, sometimes chasing a thought, some-
times catching a phrase—not swallowing his sub-
jects, but savouring them between tongue and
palate and telling the flavour. The -best journal-
ism and often finer (nearly the whole book is re-
printed from American journals).
Mendes, Maeterlinck, Moreas, Mallarme—these
are four M good sketches : Verlaine and Richepin
in the result a little better. Of Verlaine—
He had a face vizard-like, unchanging, made impudent
with the uSe of evil deeds. But the eyes were those of
the penitent thief turned toward Him on the middle
cross. ...
There were two men in Verlaine—Socrates and Pierrot,
Saint Francis of Assisi and the Marquis de Sade. ...
He had a horror of sin even when he sinned. The
defunct symbols of the Pardoner haunted him. The pen-
dulurit of his life swung between, riot and renunciation,
from the hair-cloth to.the cloth of gold.
“ How do you write ? ”, t asked him.
“Enfi&vre,” he said. ...
Verlaine attempted the impossible. He strove all his
life to reconcile the seven deadly sins and the three car-
dinal virtues. He wished to erect in the market-place of
Gomorrah a statue of the Blessed Virgin. A weak and
futile man, he was eminently human. He was simple and
intense. He was ah exaltation, an exasperation of the
modern man; at once mocking and mystic.
Now being dead,—and saved or damned — he is an
accomplice in the-eternal mystery.
Priez pour le pauvre Caspard !
1 * * if. *
Of Richepin, the sailor, the athlete, the vagrom
man, and his dramatic poem of “Le Chemineau ”
—the Tralnp—
It is the Odyssey of the Eternal Wanderer.
The highway—there is magic in the very word. It
draw's them all —gypsies, players, beggars, saltimbanqUes,
poets—all those who go in the rags of poverty or the rags
of the Great Ideal. The good bed and fare, the easy
chair in the chimney nook, the cronies at the cosy tavern
or club —the lover of the Highway is willing to barter
them all for the journey that leads no whither, and has
no end, Save the foolish end of the grave. He sleeps cold
and dines light, the wayfarer. The four winds of heaven
blow upon him. The rain and sleet drop from the north
wind’s wings upon him. The suns burn him. The stones
of the highway cut his feet. He is fain to fill his belly
with husks. The dogs bay him. And yet he is happy-
only happy when he travels the Highway.
Why are you happy, old pad-the-hoof ? Because you
journey on and ever on, between the mountains and
along the plains, by thorp and grange and town, through
the forests and mysterious shaded places, on and ever on,
you know not whither, save that it is toward something
very far away, golden and glorious, most beautiful—
which you shall never reach.
Enters Richepin’s idyll of Le Chemineau, the
wanderer who stays a little at a farmhouse, and
(for a little) loves Toinette.
But the chemineau will not stay. It is not that he is
ungrateful; it is not that he does not Jove Toinette ; only
—the wind passes, the birds fly—the great horizons call
him, he must go. He passes on his way, singing. For
Toinette there are wet eyelids and a broken heart, and an
honest, home-keeping husband.
The years fly, and a sombre thread winds
through the idyll. Toinette’s son loves a rich
man’s daughter, and is crossed by the scandal of
his birth.
The beggarman comes singing, a rare, gay, lilting song
—the song of twenty years ago. But he is no older, the
wayfarer, for he is still himself —the lover of gay horizons,
the singer of songs, the traveller on the sunless highway.
And he smooths all troubles over. “ Since lie is
something of the Ideal, it is not miraculous tliat
he should bring happiness, justice, and peace in
his pouch.”
These good peasants are full of gratitude. They offer
the vagabond a horse, rest, ease—oh ! an easy chair and
a good red fire and the Christmas goose for this weary,
frozen, hungry Vagrom Man. See, he is naked of all the
world prizes. They will give him all—even love, the love
of kin. But on the other side of the door, he knows, the
great highway stretches, far and very far, into the infinite
mysterious distance—the great highway, swept with win-
try rain, burned with the summer sun, where men fare on
and on to die in a wayside ditch. Which will he choose
—this Vagrom Man ?
Since he is indeed the Wanderer, what can he do but
wander ? It is the logic (awful, implacable, imperturbable
as the logic of the scientist) of the Ideal. Without him
they will sup well, sit warm, sleep deep ; without him
they will die decently between four posts—hut as for him,
the Vagrom Man, he must go, On and ever on, toward the
mystery of the great Highway which has no end. He
goes out into the stormy night, singing.
* * • *
It is a fine statement of a noble poem ; and after
it all else is anti-climax. You may read of Jules
Renard, victoriously Himself —
lam no man’s son. lam not the son of Flaubert. I
am not the son of Zola. lam not the son of my genera-
tion. lam The Peasant. lam sad. lam good. lam
cruel. lam patient. I fear God. I love the black cricket.
What I am, I write. What I write is me. It is not art.
It is not life. It is myself.
Of Jean Moreas, who cries to the waiter
“ Rhum a l’eau ! ” as though he were giving the
order for the storming of a convent. Of Catulle
Mendes, “the most accomplished man of letters
living— master of all the artifices and secrets of
literature.” Of le Comte Robert de-Montesquiou
Fezensac, who sees the sky as a silk petticoat and
the sun as something like an antique warming-
pan. Of the tribe of writers who yearn and
rhyme and bubble and froth in Le Mereure, and
La Flume, and La Revue Blanche, and La Libre
Critique, and La Lutte, and the rest. All anti-
climax. You turn back with your heart to the
story of Jean Richepin and the chemineau who
fares forth into the stormy night, singing.
♦
An enthusiastic (not undjscriminating) friend
supplies this account of Norman Lindsay, the
young Vic. artist whose own likeness of himself
appears on this page—
Keen of face, luminous of eye, slim and wiry of figure,
strangely resembling the early portraits of Albrecht
Diirer, Norman Lindsay is the very re-incarnation of the
ancient artist-craftsman —one of those merry painters of
Verona who made such sport of poor Calandrino over the
wench at the fountain. Born on February 23, twenty-one
years ago, at Oreswick, Vic., he is the fourth son of Dr.
Lindsay, well-known as a skilful surgeon and genial
Leveresque host throughout a 50-mile radius. On the
mother’s side he is a grandson of the Rev. Thomas Wil-
liams, known through the South Pacific in the fifties
and sixties—Lindsay’s mother was born at Fiji. Two
generations of pioneer missionaries precede the Rev.
Thomas, so that there is no stay-at-home tendency in
his family history. Neither father nor mother is avowedly
artistic; yet their ten children have taken as
naturally to art as other youngsters do to lollies.
Two of Norman’s elder brothers are professionals, and
every member of the family can and does draw. It is a
house of pencils and paint-boxes, a house where the nor-
mal course of pocket-money is toward the local “ artist’s
provider.” Incidentally, some are musical, nearly all can
string rhymes when occasion demands, and one (aged 10)
renders yeoman service to the local newspaper with a
scent for copy that would do credit to a veteran rounds-
man. Even the baby of the family will not sleep without
a -colour-box in his fist.
NORMAN LINDSAY.
There was talk of a profession ; but destiny prevailed,
and Norman Lindsay, gravitated into journalism at 15 to
relieve an elder brother of a superabundance of work.
Since then he has worked steadily on. At 16, he ambi-
tiously set to work to illustrate Shakespeare, a previous
series'of drawings for “The Three Musketeers” dating
from 13 or so. Whatever moved him, that he has set to
work to draw, gaining breadth and strength of grasp with
each fresh essay. Posters, bookplates, designs, he has
taken as'they have come his w'ay—a late poster is now
making a decided hit on the Melbourne hoardings—and
still his strength grows.
Faults there are no doubt here and there about his
work, but they are faults that will be eliminated as the
co-ordinative brain-centres develop, and he has done
enough already to give the solidest promise of ripe years
to come. Cheerful, plucky, cool-headed, and possessed
of good “ horse sense,” he is his own severest critic, and
no success will spoil him. Only the proper environment
is needed for full development, and that development, if
present promise goes for anything, should be along the
highest lines.
“ Maro ’’ comments —
... if them declare
And speak of them I would, they more
Than can be numbered are.
This is not a literal translation from German, but a psalm
as sung in Sydney Presbyterian churches. The rhyme
“ declare ” and “ are” is perhaps equal to the construc-
tion ; but I doubt it.
It stirs an old memory of an English hymn of
gratitude for deliverance from Guy Fawkes—
’T was on that day, that very day,
The villains did conspire
To blow up the Houses of Parliament
With gun-de-pow-de-hire.
Which is proudly offered for the championship.
There are a couple of decent rhymes in
“Patriotic and Other Poems,” by Wm. Satchell
(Brett Printing Co., Auckland) and it is only fair
to say that they were originally printed in The
Bulletin, and are not “ patriotic ” in the author’s
British sense. The rest hardly deserved reprint-
ing.
Coquelin’s account of the making of “Cyrano
deßergerac ” holds the lesson which so many
aspiring authors shirk—
As the work began taking forth, Rostand hired a place
in the country so that no visitors or invitations might
tempt him away from his daily toil. Rich, young, hand-
some, married to a woman all Paris was admiring, with
every door, social or Bohemian, wide open before his
birth and talent, he voluntarily shut himself up for over
a year in a dismal suburb, allowing no amusement to dis-
turb his incessant toil. Mme. Rostand has since told me
that at one time she seriously feared for his reason if not
for his life, as he averaged ten hours a day steady work,
and when the spell was on him would pass night after
night at his study table, rewriting, cutting, modelling hi#
play, never contented, always striving after a more ex-
pressive adjective, a more harmonious or original rhyme,
casting aside a month’s finished work without a second
thought.
If Rostand’s play is the best this century has produced,
and our greatest critics are unanimous in pronouncing it
equal, if not superior, to Victor Hugo’s masterpieces, the
young author has not stolen his laurels, but gained them
leaf by leaf during endless midnight hours of brain-
wringing effort —a price that few in a generation would
be willing to give or capable of giving for fame. The
labor had been in proportion to the success ; it always is !
I doubt if there is one word in his “ duel ” ballad that has
not been changed again and again for a more fitting ex-
pression, as one might assort the shades of a mosaic until
a harmonious whole is produced.
Looks as if the degeneracy of old age had over-
taken Henley. Refrain of some villainous verses
in The Sphere—
Storm along, John ! Storm along, John 1
Not in the best of the years that are gone
Has the star which is yours thus tremendously shone !
Storm along, storm along, storm along, John !
Ah me ! how changed from the old Hector !
H.M.T. :
When A. L. Bourcicault ran Shepparton (Vic.) Adver-
tiser a WeSt Indian black forwarded from Jamaica a
donation to the local hospital in return for benefits con-
ferred in a long-past year. Bourcy’s paragraph climaxed
with Juvenal’s “ Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima
cygno!”
Melb. Outpost —what is Melb. Outpost ? —will
somebody send a copy ? -was complaining recently
that “ the spirit of Australian Literature seems to
have fled from the earth.” Further, that it has
received a great number of stories and sketches,
“and only one of them was in the slightest way
worth publishing.” What do the Outpost’s con-
tributors say to that ? What is Melb. - Outpost t
will somebody send us a copy ?
N.S.W, new Federal electorates, to the tune of
infancy’s “ Cows and horses walk on four legs”—
Why not preface Federal Parliaments with a cor-
roboree to that chant, instead of the time-dis-
honoured prayer? Mem. —The names are not all
euphonious ; outcry against them is mostly
because they are neio-jphonious.
English “ Dictionary of National Biography ” is
complete in 63 volumes after 15 years’ labour—an
admirable product of learned industry.

“ New South Wales and Queensland.
The Dissolution of the Sydney Wool-selling Brokers’ Association by effluxion of time,
and our Refusal to join the Wool-selling Institute, enables this Company to Revise its
Charges on the Sale of Wool by Reducing same, and also Abandoning the CONSOLI-
DATED COMMISSION CHARGE, which, we have always contended, unnecessarily
Penalises the Wooigrower, as the BETTER the character of the Wool Grown and the
PRICE REALISED the HIGHER the CHARGE.
The following will be our Charges to the Grower :

ance, Weighing, Lotting, Repacking Sample Bales, Adver-

say this 1 They
are exhausted,
depressed, dis-
couraged. Even after
sleeping they find them-
selves just as tired as before.

/ from the hard aches and pains. You
should have all impurities removed

greatly strengthened.

nervousness disappears and your great
unrest passes away.
Of course you know this is so, for
you have heard all about Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla. ~ Ask your doctor if it isn’t the
best Sarsaparilla in the world. Even
your druggist will tell you “It’s the
oldest and the best.”
If you are constipated, take Ayer’s Fills.
They greatly aid the Sarsaparilla.

Phil Phelan.
Bed Phil was braceman at The Whim,
Most generous of simple souls ;
So suave, we all considered him
A perfect gentleman in “ moles.”
His English failed him now and then,
His brogue was straight from Donegal,
But women smiled with pleasure when
He paid his compliments, and men
Were Phelan’s brothers, one and all.
One day, a summons from below
Brought Phelan running from his graft;
A luckless boulder tripped his toe,
And plumped the braceman in the shaft.
• 'in that brief moment, when he knew
That he must make a quick descent,
Poor Phelan, to his instincts true,
Raised one wild yell, as miners do—
“ Look out, below ! ” and down he went.
We brought him up again, a wreck,
The doctor found that through and through
Phil’s bones were cracked—except his neck,
And that was somewhat damaged, too.
Phil lay a weary month in bed
Ere he again unclosed his eyes.
A man was standing at hi 3 head.
“ If I hit annywan,” he said,
“ Bilave me, I apollygiso 1 ”

SILAS SNELL.
The Digger’s Fest.
You’ll meet him in the towns,
A id on the diggin’s,
All I rest in reach-me-downs
And fancy ri'ggin’s.
He sings his little psalm
On farm and st i ion,
Or drifts upon the calm
Of “no ’cupation.”
In dust he’ll map the course
Of leads and feeders ;
The reef that is their source,
The strike of leaders.
He’ll whisper you aside,
Plaguin’ an’ postin’
Of things that ain’t been tried,
And want the testin’.
He mutters his beliefs
In shows that’s hidden,
And talks o’ shutes in reefs
He’ll find, if bidden ;
But never takes a tool
To rise his treasure,
Although he’s of a school
With lots o’ leisure.
To take his tip is worse
*N poison adders
To one’s bright hopes—a curse—
A chasin’ shadders;
For in the fields o’ blow
He mostly figgers,
And never in the co.
Of reg’lar diggers.
N.S.W.
HIS MATE.
Western Heroes.
Smiled at and often set at nought,
Slighted and sometimes scorned,
O comrades, ye have dared and fought
Unpraised and Unadorned !
No medals here “ For Valour ” speak,
No bars your breast emboss ;
A bit of bronze on brow and cheek
Is your Victoria Cross !
When Death comes close with fingers cold
If I leave thousands ten,
I’ll bid them mould in beaten gold
A cross for Western men ;
For every splendid rescue made
From flood and thirst and fire,
For those who give their gallant aid
In friendship, not in hire !
And, pride of all the watching fair,
At Western ball and show
These men shall wear their honours rare
That all the world may know
There is no need for our brave breed
To fight across the foam,
Since men may do a gallant deed
A bridle-length from home !
N.B.W.
WILL H. OGILVIE.
Judge Docker, of ' N.S.W., spoke a word
of profound wisdom when he remarked, the other
day, that the method of indicting: prisoners was a
usurpation of the powers of judge and jury. The
statement is true in a far larger sense than was
probably intended. Two men may commit an
equally bad assault apiece, but in one case the
arresting constable may tone it down by laying a
charge of common battery, and thus bring it
within the reach of the local »T.P. and a £1 fine.
And in the other case, not a whit worse, lie may
lay a charge of assault with intent to murder, and
start the accu ed on an upward career which ends
in the Supie ne Court and a sentence of ten years
or more The common bobby can thus switch jus-
tice on or off, largely at his pleasure. And so can
other people, right up to tlie Attorney-General,
who can add years on to the sentence or take
years off, merely by the name he gives to the
charge that is laid before the jury. In which con-
nection it would repay anyone interested in the
proper and literal administration of the law--to
say nothing of justice—to look up at this late
period when there is no longer any excitement or
argument about the matter, the method in which
Montgomery and Williams, hanged for the
Bridge-street burglary affair, were indicted.

They have a holy reverence for Property
in Tasmania. Witness these extracts from the
House of Assembly debate on the Constitution
Bill:
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL: With regard to two
joint owners it the property was worth
£20, or over they could both vote. But if only worth
£15 they would be considered as rated at £7 10s each, and
not be entitled to vote.
Mr. URQUHART (in wild alarm) : But then the pro-
perty would be disfranchised !
Mr. BURKE said he opposed manhood suffrage. As
to a man not being allowed to vote in more than one dis-
trict that was entirely wrong. If a man voted in one dis-
trict and also had property in another the latter would be
disfranchised.
Mr. URQUHART suggested a possible means to avoid
disfranchising property worth £15 a year.
A few members talked a strange unknown
language to the House about the sinfulness of dis-
franchising human beings. But the House was
so heart-broken about “the Property” that it
hardly heard them.
The recommendation of the Temora-
Wyalong railway by N.S.W. Public Works Com-
mittee by a majority of one excites loud Western
anger. Two previous committees recommended
the Grenfell-Wyalong route; but Temora is in
Mr. Watson’s electorate, and Mr. Watson is on
the present P.W. Committee, and consequently
Grenfell is erased and Temora substituted.
Which goes to swell the reasons why the Parlia-
mentary Public Works Committee should be
abolished and a board of official experts subs i-
tuted. Mr. Holman, who reprobates Watson fo -
snatching the line from Grenfell, being himse'f
member for Grenfell, is also to an extent interested
in the material consequence of his vote in the
House. But he is not in so equivocal a position
as Watson, the latter being paid twice for his
Parliamentary energy —once as M.L.A. and aga n
as P.W.C.-man. By the way, does Watson turn
over one half his P.W. fees to the Labor fund, as
was resolved when Laborites first went on that
rollicking body ?

WHAT IS CATARRH?
nm
MEDIC ATOH.
/CATARRH is inflammation of the
'- y lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flnmmation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lun(rs. It injures the sight and
| hearing,.destroys the sense of taste
and smeli, renders the lireath offen-
sive, breaks down the affected
tissues, consumes .the. .nasal ear-
tilepes, and rots away the small
frontal hones of the skull. The put rid
dischanre passing through the lunirs

Federating the Railways—at Cost
or Otherwise.
In a recent article an attempt was made to
gild the lily, and pour water on the deluge,
and be otherwise needless and superfluous,
by showing reasons why the Federal
Government should take over the State rail-
ways and be the sole railroad-proprietor of
Australia and Tasmania. About the advisa-
bility, in a general way, of Federal railroad
ownership most people are now agreed.
The difficulties lie in the means, not the
end. The Federal Convention slurred the
matter over and bequeathed it to the
Federal Parliament, because it found itself
confronted with two problems too vast to be
dealt with in the time available. The com-
munity wanted to know : (1) On what
principle would the railways be valued when
the Federal Government bought them ; and
(2) what arrangements would be made to en-
sure a fair distribution of new lines when the
Federal Government became the sole rail-
road-constructor of Australia. The time re-
quired for the thinking-out of these problems
and for educating the public up to the result
was not available. Yet it is absolutely
essential that the Federal Government
should take over the railways, and have a
uniform gauge, and uniform rates, and uni-
form principles of management, and lend its
credit to the country’s railway loans in order
to get them at a cheaper rate, so the
problems must needs be solved in one way
or another.
* • • •
There are two principles, and no more, on
which the Federal Government can acquire
the State railways. It may take them over
(1) At the price they originally cost, or
(2) At their present value.
* * * •
Assuming that the Federal Government
desires to take the railways over at present
value, there are a number of things to be
considered before present value can be ar-
rived at. On the surface, it might seem
that the only thing necessary is to take the
net earnings and estimate that the lines are
worth so many years’ purchase. But it can’t
be done by taking the net earnings for one
year, or five, or even ten years. To buy the
lines of one province orr. the strength of the
returns they yielded on the top of a large
temporary boom caused by wild borrowings
would be a ruinous absurdity, for when the
boom was over the earnings would probably
drop more than half. To buy those of
another province on the returns they yielded
in a period of unusual depression, caused,
perhaps, by a sudden stoppage of borrowing,
would be a swindle. Again, how many
years’ returns should be taken in order
to arrive at an average ? Several provinces
have, at different times, owued the most pro-
fitable railway system in Australia. That of
Westralia is the most profitable now, and
has been since 1894, though the returns now
are little more than a third of what they
were in 1896, and it was largely the great
borrowing boom which then brought them
up to the hitherto unheard-of figure of 11|
per cent. In 1891, and one or two ad-
jacent years, the South Australian railways
were by far the best-paying system in
Australia. The Victorian lines were the
most profitable in 1885, and for quite a num-
ber of years thereabouts, till S. A. took the
lead. New South Wales had the lead in
1881, and also at one or two other times,
and it has long held a good second place.
In the days when Victoria had the best-pay-
ing railway-system in these provinces, the
W A. lines (which have since boomed up till
they gave ll£ per cent, on their cost—the
highest rate on the Austi’alian record) didn’t
pay for coal and grease. The Tasmanian
and Queensland railway systems haven’t yet
had their experience of being on top, but
Tasmania is coining on rapidly, and may get
its turn ere very long.
* * » •
Therefore it is impossible for the Federal
Government to buy the railways at a price
based on the profit they yield without first
deciding how many years’ average should be
taken to decide what is the profit. Wes-
tralia would probably be satisfied with 40
years, so as to take in its good times and
leave out its bad ones; on a 10-years’ average
the Westralian lines woukL cost the Com-
monwealth about six times as much as on a
20-years’ average. A 20-years’ average would
suit both Victoria and N.S.W., taking in
their best times and leaving out the worst
ones. Probably S.A. would sell its lines at
the highest figure on the basis of the aver-
age profits of the last 15 years. Tasmania
would doubtless want to sell on the basis of
last year’s earnings, they being its best up to
date.
• • • •
And then, what are earnings in the sense
that concerns the Federal Government ?
That body will have to organise reasonably
uniform fares and freight-charges for all
Australia. It will probably strike an
average among the different rates now
existing. A railway system may pay well
through charging very high rates, which the
Federal Government will have to reduce;
or it may pay badly through charging low
rates, which -the Federal management
will have to level up. One system
may pay better through being credited with
heavy allowances for carriage of mails
and deadhead passengers ; through not being
debited with pensions to raihvay-employ4s ;
through being liberally credited on paper
with freights for the carriage of material for
building new lines ; through not being de-
bited with interest on money borrowed for
unfinished lines ; or through not being
charged for services rendered to it by other
departments. Another system, which really
pays better, may look as if it paid worse
through not being credited with some of
these paper items, and through having pen-
sions, interest of money borrowed for con-
struction of unfinished lines, &c., charged
to it instead of to the general revenue. A
railway system which looks profitable may
only do so by paying starvation wages for an
exorbitant amount of work, while a better
one may give worse returns on paper through
paying a decent wage all round and through
being over-manned. The Commonwealth
management must pay reasonably uniform
wages, and it can’t be expected to buy on
the basis of profits made by sweating, seeing
that it doesn’t intend to make profits itself
sweating. Any province can make its rail-
ways look profitable for a few years by saving
money on repairs and letting the lines and
rolling-stock run down. It can make its
lines look profitable for many years by sur-
reptitiously charging repairs to loans instead
of revenue, and replacing worn-out rolling-
stock in the same fashion. Or it can make a
good system look comparatively Unprofitable
through economising loan money and throw-
ing a greater outlay on to earnings. If this
matter is not carefully Considered, the Fede-
ral Government will find itself offering a
premium for fraud and penalising honesty.
• * * *
The question of borrowed money and the
booms attendant thereon is always with us,
and it is large, indefinite, and unfathomable!
Any State can, at any time, make a tre-
mendous burst of what looks like prosperity
by borrowing enough money and spending
it liberally enough; this was, to some extent,
how Victoria, Westralia, S.A., and N.S.W.
had their periods of splendidly-profitable
railway management. While the boom
lasted everything paid handsomely. The
Federal Government can’t be expected to buy
railways on the basis of the returns thus pro
duced. By leaving lines unfenced, and build
ing wooden instead of iron or steel bridges,
the cost may be kept down so far as to make
an appreciable difference on the imme-
diate profits, but the Federal manage-
ment which paid a higher price by reason of
that extra profit would be badly left; it
would have to rebuild the shoddy bridges
very shortly, and the fencing would be an
inevitable expense when population in-
creased. Good or bad management might
make all the difference between profit and
loss. But the Federal Government, which
intends to pick the best manager and make
him boss of all the railways in the six pro-
vinces, couldn't fairly be guilty of the sharp
practice of penalising a province for its mis-
fortune in having, temporarily, an inferior
man at the head of affairs, or an inferior
Minister to control him. There is the ques-
tion whether the system which is now paying,
sa y» 4 per cent., but which shows worse re-
turns every year, should be brought on a 4 per
cent, basis, and if not, then on what basis ?
Also whether a system which pays 2 per
cent, or less, but is steadily and continuously
improving, should be bought on a 2 percent,
basis—or on what other basis 1 Again,
taking over the railways involves taking over
the railway debts. One province’s lines may
be burdened with a 4 per cent, debt, and
consequently represent a heavy loss, while
another’s is only loaded with a 3| per cent,
debt, and therefore is a reasonably profit-
able investment. But the 4 per cent, loans
may have, on an average, only 12 or 15 years
to run, while the 3j per cent, loans may be
fixed for nearly 30 years. And if they can
both be converted into 3 per cent, debt
when they fall due, then the 4 per cent,
debt is the cheaper of the two after all. In
that case, to take them both over on the
basis of the present interest rate would be a
swindle on the 4 per cent, province. And
to take them both over on the assumption
that all the loans could be converted into 3
per cent, debt when they fell due would be a
wildly interesting experiment, seeing that
either or both might fall due at a time of
financial wreck when money couldn’t be
borrowed below 5 per cent. Again, the
profits in any case may be increased or
diminished through the operation of dif-
ferential border tariffs, or border Customs
tariffs. The Commonwealth means to com-
pletely suppress these, and it can hardly buy
the railways at a price based on profits or
losses caused by a policy which is just about
to be abolished for ever.
* • • •
Supposing it were possible to decide what
are legitimate earnings—the earnings which
would be realised if freights and fares were
uniform, if there were no border tariffs or
differential rates, if wages were equal, if
bookkeeping was exactly similar, if repairs
were equally attended to, if exactly the same
rule- was adopted as to what should be
charged to revenue and what to loans, if the
provinces all borrowed every year the same
amount per head so as to keep their artifi-
cial loan booms on the same basis, if the
railways were equally well managed, and the
loans carried the same interest and were for
the same term ; and then if the Federal
Parliament could decide how many years’
returns should be taken to give a fair aver-
age, and it could be arranged that all the
provinces should increase about equally in
population so that the systems would retain
the same relative value—then, no doubt, the
policy of taking over the railways on present
value would be easy. A few points may
have been forgotten, but the above are the
principal factors in the calculation.
• * * •
But in view of the difficulty of doing any
of these things, The Bulletin suggests that
the Federal Government should otter to buy
all lines at their original cost, and thus cut
the knot. It is a simple, off-hand, rule-of-
thumb way out of the difficulty, but in the
end it would probably be found to have more
elements of justice and sanity in it than any
other possible device. Certainly it has the
evidence of past experience behind it.
If a Federal Government had taken over
the railways of Westralia, S.A.. Victoria,
and N.S.W. at cost 20 years ago, and had
extended them just as they have since
been extended—just as wisely and as
foolishly—at exactly the same cost, it would
probably by now, or by a few years hence,
have got, on the average, the same return on
its money all round. Each of these pro-
vinces has been, at one time or other, the
one which held first place as owner of the
most remunerative railway system in Aus-
tralia, and they have all had turns at occupy-
ing second place and third place, and pro-
bably they will all occupy all these places
again in turn. The fact that Tasmania and
Queensland have never yet been on top
merely goes to show that their time hasn’t
come yet, but that it will come is practically
certain. The chances are that fifty square
miles of paper covered with the most intri-
cate calculations of the most learned calcu-
lators in Australia would arrive at nothing
which, judged by the average results of the
next 100 years, would be more fair to all
parties in the end than the purely mechanical
expedient above suggested. To arrive at a ma-
thematically accurate result—to split the last
hair exactly and to divide the last halfpenny
fairly among six—it is not only necessary to
know what each railway system would have
paid for, say, the last 20 years if all condi-
tions had been equal, but also to decide what
effect a totally different set of conditions will
have on each system. To be absolutely fair
to the provinces and to itself, the Common-
wealth Government wants to know what
each set of lines will prove to be worth under
a combination of new circumstances—so new
that there is absolutely no evidence to go
upon. It can’t find out by leaving the lines
under State management for a term of years
after Federation is established, and judging
by results at the end of the term ; the re-
results produced under Federation and six
antagonistic managements, and the results
that would be produced under Federation
and one uniform management, are as wholly
distinct as Moses and Mahomet. The
obvious way out is to abandon the impossible
problem, and take over the six railway sys-
tems at cost. It may not be an ideal basis,
but it is a basis. The other is a quicksand.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Boodlewraith’s Practical Joke.
Charitable people who don’t like to think evil of
their neighbors begin to suggest that the Queens-
land Government is possibly a trifle off its head.
It pays lecturers, and touts, and people with
magic lanterns in which are beautiful pictures of
the Barron Falls, to stump Great Britain and tell
the small farmer about the advantages of Queens-
land as a place for him to settle in. These
stipendiary frauds explain how a fatherly Govt,
will meet the immigrant on landing, and shout
for him, and find him a nice farm where he will
be rich and happy and contented, and grow old
under his own vine and fig-tree, with his own pig
swelling to abnormal dimensions in the sty. The
auditor thinks the Barron Falls are a fair sample of
Queensland ; he knows nothing of, Boulia and
Birdsville, and the Western deserts, and the
drought-lands, and the sand-patches whitened
with cow-bones, and the ticks, and the awful
snake-infested Gulf-country. So he comes. And
when he arrives there are practically no farms
available. The State has some good land,
but most of it isn’t surveyed or cut up, and no one
can supply any accurate information about it. The
Queensland Govt, goes down on its two large
excited knees in England, and grovels to the small
farmer to come out and settle. And when he
comes he is treated mostly as a nuisance and an
interloper, and public officials groan when they
see him come in to ask where his farm is located.
To the immigrant all this seems a grim and
hideous and purposeless practical joke, and he
generally moves on enraged and disgusted. The
Queensland Government is doing a little now at
cutting up large estates for closer settlement, but
for every small farm it has to offer there are
several applicants, even without bringing new
applicants all the way from England. As for the
domestic servants and laborers who listen to the
glozing voice of the Boodlewraith’s hired deceiver,
their situation is pitiable. They come out with
the assurance that the wages of the domestic
Biddy in Queensland are from £5O to £7O a year,
and that laborers can get pay which seems
fabulous according to English ideas. In fact,
the lecturer talks the jargon of 30 years
ago, and pictures things as they were in
the riotous early days. And the imported dupes
arrive to find that the drought and the ticks have
so diminished employment out-back that the
towns are crowded with workless agricultural and
Eastoral laborers, and that the Kanaka, Jap.,
how, Malay, Javanese, coolie, and all the tribes
from Gon-knows-where are in the land, and that
Freetrade in niggers has cut down wages to a star-
vation level. In fact they find that the Queens-
land Government, having by its nigger policy and
its misgovernment loaded the country with unem-
ployed, has finished by going off its head and im-
porting more unemployed wholesale, so as to heap
one curse on top of another. And they also fail,
somehow or other, to appreciate the great Philp
practical joke. It is doubtless a good joke in its
way for the Philp Government, but for the immi-
grants it is a heartless, cruel, shameless deception
— ■»
New South Wales Awaits a Message.
Now that the report of N.S.W. Finance Commit-
tee has made it clear that the Freetrade policy, as
practised by ex-Premier Reid, didn’t yield
enough to keep N.S.W. solvent, and it was only
made to look temporarily solvent by Reid’s impu-
dence in denying the existence of his huge defi-
ciencies, the public is waiting to hear from the
Great Freetrade Party. That party always alleges
that Freetrade is good because it charges the
people less in Customs duties than Protection
does. And in the same way it would be good to
abolish duties altogether, and also to abolish direct
taxation and railway fares. These doings would
have the same merit that is claimed for Free-
trade ; they would “lift a burden off the backs of
the people,” and “ reduce taxation,” and “ spare
the public pocket,” and so on. But the country
must pay its way ; it can’t live for ever by falsify-
ing the public accounts ; and in view of the pre-
sent lamentable situation the public is wait-
ing to hear whether the Great Freetrade
Party proposes to raise another £700,000
a year or so by going back to Dibbs’s
tariff, or if it is prepared to double the land
and income-taxes, or what. The public has been,
talked to death by the Pulsford tribe about the
beauties of Freetrade, inasmuch as it signifies the
reduction of taxation. It wants to know now
whether that party has the courage to say what
taxation it will advocateputting on to fill the huge
financial gap its policy has created. Anybody—
even an aboriginal—can say that it is good and
pleasant to take taxation off. It would be pleasant
to take all taxation off, and give everybody a pen-
sion in addition. But now things have narrowed
down to these five alternatives: (1) Either the
great Freetrade Party must advocate greatly in-
creased customs duties ; or (2) it must advocate a
huge' increase of direct taxation ; or (3) it must
vote for letting N.S.W. slide into ultimate in-
solvency and repudiation ; or (4) it must advocate
a large retrenching of public servants’ salaries; or
else (5) it must continue to be a party of moral
cowardice, as it has been for the last five years,
s . lm ply keep on howling about the advantages
of reducing taxation, and refusing to say anything
about how to repair the shortness of money which
arises from the reduction. So N.S.W. keeps on
waiting to hear from the Great Freetrade Party.

Soldiers’ Wives.
In the recent piping times of patriotism, when
Australia was passing the ’at for its credit’s sake,
and revelling in an unwonted tendency to “Pye,
pye, pye!” nobody troubled to question the
genuineness of the wife whom Tommy left
behind lam. The authorities—God bless ’em !
chose to think of every married gentleman in
kharki going West as a citizen of unimpeachable
moral character. His desire to get away to Africa
and leave little things behind him was sufficient
guarantee of his good faith. And yet even in
Victoria, where the Defence Department was so
much concerned about woman’s rights that it


tried to bounce one particular warrior into mar
riage with one particular girl, there are said to
have been several instances of Tommy dedicating
an unlawful wife to his country’s care. The
Bulletin knows of the case of a Vic. Contingenter
who made out an order for the wrong woman to
draw his pye (or part of it) during h s absence at
the gory “ front,” and, had the careless hero been
killed instead of merely invalided, the Defence
Dept, would now, doubtless, have been pension-
ing a bogus widow on his account. It seems that
the hero’s real wife, whose religion is opposed
to divorce and “ scandal, ” has lived mostly apart
from him for many years, giving financial assist-
ance occasionally, and taking a philosophic view
of her alleged grievances. She was aware of her
husband’s departure for Africa. _ He called to see
her the evening before the Contingent sailed, and
he gave the lady—a friendly promise to write.
Mrs. Blank therefore refrained from putting in
any claim to registration (as it may be called) by
the Defence Department until she chanced
to discover that another person was figur-
ing as the Soldier’s Wife in h stead, and then
Mrs. Blank thought it would be well to
lodge a protest. She put her case (and her
marriage certificate) before the Defence Depart-
ment, and got considerably snubbed by a certain
gallant captain for her pains. Also, the Premier’s
secretary expressed the Premier’s regrets that he
couldn’t interfere in the matter. And when, a
few weeks later, Mr. Blank was coming hick
from S’Africa on the sick-list, it was the wrong
Mrs. Blank who got an official notification of the
warrior’s return. When lie did return, a proud
and happy town jubilated over him and heaped
congratulations on the wrong Mrs. Blank. So
the right Mrs. Blank, in Melbourne, fears that by
the time her husband has been granted a Govern-
ment billet in reward for iiis patriotism she will
begin to feel very like an impostor, unless the
Defence Department will kindly settle her little
difficulty by desiring Mr. Blank to say, on oath,
which wife will be his widow in the event of his
being wafted skywards whilst both ladies remain
here below.

More About these “Sacrifices for the
Empire.”
In New South Wales it is proposed to put the
war-expenditure into the floating debt. Victoria
is paying its war-bill out of revenue, and, to do it,
throws Old-Age Pensions overboard, and fills in
further gaps by charging an increased amount of
ordinary expenditure to loans, and by leaving its
deficit to posterity to clear.off. The M‘Shiels
Government intended to start the Old-Age Pension
system this financial year, and thus save its coun-
try for the future from the ineffable disgrace of
sending its aged and sick poor to gaol for want of
any other provision for them. But the cost of
slaughtering a number of complete strangers ate
away the available cash until it dwindled down to
£lO,OOO, where all of £300,000 is required. ■ And
then further bills for the slaughter of complete
strangers ate into the funds again, and now Trea-
surer Shlels goes through the howling mockery
of setting aside £25,000 for Old Age pension
purposes ! Not one Jingo of the lot seems to be
ready to tax himself to pay the war-bill. These
alleged “sacrifices” that Fat Man said he
was “ready to mike for the Empire” pan
out, in N.S. Vf., into the fact that he is
willing to sacrifice his children by leaving them
the bill to pay, while in Victoria the Fat One
is nobly prepared to do likewise indirectly ; also
to sacrifice his poor, sick, and aged fellow-creature.
In fact, in their large and generous readiness to sac-
rifice someone else, the Victorian and N.S.W.
Jingoes beat Jimmy and Joe Governor out of
sight. The Bulletin is the only paper that has
persistently demanded the imposition in each pro-
vince of a new tax sufficient to pay the war-bill,
so that this generation—the one which has had so
muoh to say about its readiness to “ make sacrifices
for the Empire ” —will put it beyond a doubt that
it is making the sacrifices itself—not directly or
indirectly shunting the bill on to anyone else.
In fact, the non-Jingo Bulletin stands out
as the one institution, among a crowd of bel-
lowing and flag - waving shams, that is pre-
pared to make sacrifices for the Empire in
dead earnest. As for the gang of mock-
loyalists who waved banners, and made speeches,
and held banquets, and got drunk on Mafeking-
night, and who ad vertised themselves by calling for
this paper’s ejection from public reading-rooms on
aocount of its “disloyalty,” The Bulletin’s dis-
gust at their mean and shabby disloyalty is too
deep for words. There are two ways in which the
shrieking Jingo can make sacrifices for the Em-
pire—he can either fight or pay. The great bel-
lowing mob didn’t fight, and it proposes to pay at
the expense of somebody else. The Bulletin
didn’t fight either, but it is fully prepared to pay
its share of a war-tax rather than resort to the
cowardly expedient of leaving the bill to posterity,
or paying it by withdrawing the more than half-
promised relief to the poor, sick and aged. It
isn’t a question now of raising a paltry little sub-
scription and getting the value back in advt. and
glory. It is a question of paying the real bill, and
getting no return except in the satisfaction of
having honestly met an obligation. And now
that the real test has come the self-advertised
“ patriot ” whose professed desire to make sacri-
fices for the Empire was so vast and burning an
emotion, stands convicted as a gassy impostor who
got drunk on false pretences, and as a “ disloyal ”
wind-bag who added hypocrisy to his other sins.

Tlie N.S.W. Superannuation Fund.
Re the N.S.W. Civil Service Superannuation
Fund. The receipts for the year 181)9 were
£44,834 and the disbursements £i03,711, showing
a deficit for the year of £58,877. The deficit is an
increasing one, and for 1900 will pan out at about
£75,000. The estimated amount required to pay
pensions for the next four years is £400,000. The
expected receipts for the same period can be
roughly estimated at £llB,OOO, and the balance to
the credit of the fund in January last was about
£300,000, making a total of £418,000. Thus it is
plain that the fund will become exhausted in 1903.
The Govt, will then have to provide for pensions,
gratuities, and refunds about £107,000 per annum.
The actuarial report for 1898 estimated that on 31st
Dec., 1897, a sum of £1,344,541 was required to
place the fund in a solvent state and enable
it to remain so until all claims were met. It
is now estimated that on 31st Dec., 1900, a
sum of £1,500,000 will be required for
the same purpose —an increase of £155,459 on
the capital liability. Procrastination is thus* the
thief of £155,459 hard cash. It’s the old policy
of passing the burden on to successive Govern-
ments. Why not face and end the matter at once ?
Victoria has a far heavier burden, paying away
annually about £340,000 a year in pensions under
the disastrously-liberal Act passed in 1802 and re-
pealed by an alarmed country in 1883. Victoria’s
pension-bill is now a diminishing quantity, but for
fears it is likely to be over £300,000 per annum.
n Victoria the State carries the whole load ; it
isn’t assisted by large contributions from public
servants’ salaries, as in N.S.W. And yet Victoria
pays every penny of its pensions (£340,000 a year)
out of revenue, while N.S.W., rather than face a
charge of about £lOO,OOO a year out of revenue,
proposes to charge the whole Superannuation
Fund deficit to the floating debt! The good old
floating debt! How many burdens it bears 1
The Cattle-beat Horror.
A Victorian writes to The Bulletin on an im-
portant marine matter :
The question of the carnage of grain in bulk came up
before Vic. Marine Board recently, and it promptly
adopted the stringent precautions now in force in the
Atlantic trade. A much louder-crying evil, however,
that is always with us and has been ever Since Australia
commenced exporting live-stock to oversea ports, seems
likely to be quietly ignored, or at any rate shelved. Take
the facts as they are. The War Office contracts for large
supplies of live stock to be delivered in Durban and other
S’African ports. Suitable stock-carrying vessels are not
available, and in their place tramp steamers are engaged
on time charter. The main idea in the building of
these vessels is capacity : they are ’ long, of
comparatively narrow beam (as regards their length)
and few, if any, are provided with bilge keels
to ensure greater steadiness in a sea-way.
Arrived here, hastily-constructed stalls are fitted up—
flung together would describe the piocess better—and
secured to bulwarks or rails by hooks of, at best, Jin.
iron, through outside upright posts. Into these stalls the
live freight is packed, their only protection from wind and
water being lin. planking, of which the first gale makes
matchwood. Where beasts are stowed below decks no
extra means of ventilation are provided over-and-ahove
the ordinary deck ventilators and hatches, both of which
must of necessity be covered during bad weather, for the
safety of the ship and cargo. One instance out of many
during the last four months shows the necessity of in-
sisting on greater supervision and more stringent require-
ments. The s.s. Anerlev sailed from Newcastle for Durban
with a cargo of coal and some 315 head of prime cattle.
Scarcely 24 hours out, dirty weather was met, and, with
small engine-power, the vessel was almost unmanageable.
These conditions lasted two days, andat the end of that time
out of the 315 live stock 205 had perished, while of the
remainder several died whilst the vessel was lying at
Williamstown. With this evidence of the steamer’s un-
suitability as a stock-carrier, mark what followed ; the
flimsy stalls were repatched, and 256 head of horses
shipped at Melbourne, and the.vessel proceeded, arriving
at her destination after having lost 201 head 1 1 In the
case of the regular traders of the 8.1. Co., and other
lines, where permanent and substantial fittings are used,
the mortality seldom exceeds showing that live stock
can be successfully carried for long voyages if only suffi-
cient precautions are taken. Underwriters, after raising
their premiums to an almost prohibitive figure, are now
refusing to accept any risk where stock is carried by
certain vessels of the tramp class. The essential points
of a good cattle-boat may be summed as : (I) good pro-
portion of beam to length ; (2) big freeboard ; (3) great
steadiness in a sea-way (to be obtained by use of bilge
keels); (4) perfect ventilation where stock is carried
below decks ; (5) sufficient number of attendants for
watering and feeding animals ; (6) room between rows of
stalls to allow of carcases being easily removed. Marine
Board surveyors should be directed to see that no vessel
is allowed to leave port with live stock on board, unless
she possesses these most essential qualifications. Other-
wise the live-stock trade is ahout as cruel as a Boxer in-
surrection and even less excusable.

The Devil’s Brigade Again!
In the interests of N.S. Wales Public Service
“Libra ” kicks against the lawyers :
Editor Bulletin. —The frequent cases of “ In re gent
one,” &c., are almost invariably dealt with in a manner
demonstrating beyond doubt that a cast-iron band of
clanship and class sympathy—sufficiently strong to over-
ride the public interests—exists in the close corporation
of the law. And now, to the dismay of the whole N.S.W.
civil service, but more especially to that of the officers of
the Department of Justice, this same accursed class-
feeling comes nakedly to the surface in the last annual
report of the Public Service Board. An individual joins
the Justice Department, and after a long apprenticeship,
during which he necessarily becomes acquainted with
every phase of court procedure and routine, he is pro-
moted to the charge of an office as O.P.S. Still his
experience goes on. He has continually to keep the
honorary Justices posted up in law ; he has to help them
out of all their difficulties ; he hears all classes of cases
dealt with, every legal point argued ; then he has at last
to pas, a stiff exam, in every branch of law dealt with by
inferior Courts. And then? Well, then, any sane man
would think that after 15 or 20 years’ such work, rounded
off by such an examination, those officers would be persons
eminently fitted for promotion to the next grade—that of
Police magistrate. But, no ! —hear the P.S. Board : —“ The
board think that to satisfactorily fill these positions (of
P.Ms.) it is necessary that'the persons selected should
possess qualifications of a high order, including tact and a
general knowledge of the world—requirements which a
long servicq in the Public Service does not ensure.” And
who are the persons possessing these eminent qualifica-
tions? Again the P.S. Board—indirectly indicating what
they think on the subject:—“The Board contend that
they should be at liberty to select the Beat Men, even
although they may not be able to certify that there is no
person in the service capable of filling the post (of P.M.).
The Board further think that barristers or solicitors, of,
say, five years standing, should be exempted from passing
the prescribed examination.” (Note —A C.P.S. of 20
years standing is not exempt.) “ And they believe, after
several discussions with them, that both the Attorney-
General and the Minister of Justice ” (himself an attorney)
“ are in harmony with their views.”
Of course they are. Let the Civil Service go to sleep,
so long as their fellow-sharks are fed. But what sort of
sharks ? Surely of a very inferior hammer-headed sort
he must be who, after five years’ practice, is willing to
accept such an office, at a commencing salary of £250.
None but a failure in his profession would do so. Still
they are lawyers ; and therefore in the opinions of those
boss-lawyers, the A.G. and the Minister of Justice, they
must be the best men. Which carries us farther, in-
ferentially, to the opinion that conditions precedent to
the possession of “tact and a general knowledge of the
world” are impecuniosity and professional incompetence.
But as a matter of fact any ordinary C.P.S. can give
points to any ordinary barrister or attorney in matters
relating purelv to police-court law ; and often has the
C.P.S. to smile at the exhibitions barristers and attorneys
make of themselves in public. A few recent cases : Not
one individual out of a Full Bench or Court packed with
barristers knew that the Common Law had been so
amended by Statute that fruit can now be stolen before it
is severed from the soil. Any C.P.S. could have told
them the Act and section which altered it. Again, a
judge recently made absolute a rule nisi for a prohibition
on the ground that he had no power to amend an exces-
sive sentence imposed by a Bench of Magistrates. Any
C.P.S. could have told him that for nearly 10 years a
special law had been in force directing a Judge in
such a case to either himself vary the sentence so
as to make it level, or else to remit it back
to the lower Court to be there so dealt with.
Another Judge, when a prisoner charged with felony
asked for permission to sit out of the dock next to his
counsel, replied that he had no power to grant such an
application, and apparently no one in Court knew that for
nearly 17 years a special section of the C;L. Amendment
Act has given a judge the power to allow a prisoner on
trial to stand or sit whenever he, the Judge, thinks fit.
Another Judge gravely quashed a conviction on appeal
because the prisoner had not been sentenced to imprison-
ment in the nearest gaol, as the particular Act directed.
Any C.P.S. could have told him that a later Act had
specially repealed that particular provision and that it
was competent for the Bench to award imprisonment in
any gaol. And now crede experto— the opinions of the
P.S. Board, the A.G., and the Minister of Justice to the
contrary notwithstanding—it is a solemn fact that even
good attorneys make excessively bad P.Ms. —the late
S.M. John Dillon being a solitary exception. In the lower
Courts I contend that the public want less law and more
equity. A lawyer naturally looks for quibbles and techni-
calities and if the adverse party does not raise such
points, the lawyer P.M. will be certain to raise them
himself—simply to air his superior wisdom. Again, and
again have I seen this happen ; indeed the very examina-
tion which Clerks of Petty Sessions have now to pass,
tends to foster this kind of thing, and all the latest
fledged P.M.’s are tainted vvith the same fault—a desire
to impress the public by airing their special knowledge.
But to whom can the Service look for help. Wise and
Wood have decided against it ; Reid, with his eyes fixed
on higher things, cares no longer a tinker's-curse for it.
It only remains for the Service to help itself, and at the
elections, which cannot now be long delayed, show what
it thinks of the party which allows it to be thus con-
temptuously thrust aside to provide billets for deadbeat
but influential legal failures.
Victoria still continues its infamous habit of
gaoling persons for the crime of being ill. Bridget
Coyne was, the other day, discharged from Pent-
ridge prison, after serving a three months’ term
for having “no visible means,” &c. This iniquit-
ous sentence had been imposed by the Carlton
Bench (of course), Bridget being then old and ill
and unable to work. When the time expired, she
being still ill and not having acquired a com-
Eetence meanwhile, the accommodating Coburg
ench ordered her a further three months —pre-
sumably for not having mended as rapidly as she
should. On the same day Premier and Chief Sec.
M ‘Lean injured his foot, but so far there has
been no suggestion that he should give the salu-
brious climate-of the Stockade and the nourishing
hominy diet a three months’ trial. Yet, if daily
paper reports of his Bairnsdale speech are to be
trusted, he promised that there should be no
further gaoling of the poor and the sick, as such ;
also ex-Premier Turner promised ditto, in Parlia-
ment ; despite which and the fact that the sick
poor can be better and more cheaply attended to
in the hospitals or the Immigrants’ Home,
Bridget Coyne was sent to gaol for the second
time because she was ailing and poor.
The tender methods of the Victorian penal system.
Edward Johnstone, who is eitheroueof society’s
irreclaimahles or has been driven to crime by his
inability—from incurable illness—to get work, has,
since ’B6. been sentenced to no less than 26 years’
imprisonment. One of these sentences was 12
months, for escaping from gaol ; and another three
years, for being illegally out of gaol. His last
sentence, for tive years, was extended, under the
Pentridge Star Chamber system of punishing a
prisoner practically without trial, to six years and
nine months, and he was discharged, suffering from
severe heart-disease and nearly blind, on June 15,
’99, with 15s. in his possession. The thriftless
Johnstone squandered his capital on, among
other things, half-a-crown’s worth of medicine and
a four-and-sixpenny pair of spectacles. The pro-
digality of a man who dissipates over two years’
earnings on a pair of spectacles cannot be too
strongly reprehended. Then, having battled
along for a week or so on the other Bs., he once
more indulged in the offence legally known as
housebreaking, with the result that Judge
.Johnston gave him another five years !
Burglar Johnstone is one more of the ridiculously
extravagant mistakes of the Vic. prison system.
When the law discharged him, physically worn-
out, nearly blind, with no trade except that of
housebreaker, and with no assets except the price
of a little medicine and a pair of spectacles, it was
reasonably certain that he would burgle some place
and come back on the State for support. The
State would have saved damage to property, wear
and tear of “ bobbv ” and cost of trial, by putting
him into a charitable institution right away, and
the cost of supporting him there would have been
no greater than the cost of supporting him in gaol.
That the system of starving the charitable vote is
wicked doesn’t matter much, but the indirect
waste of money which it leads to is dreadful.

The Bulletin “told you so.” Writes the Jingo
Sydney D.T. in a leading article :
The British South Africa, otherwise “ the Chartered,”
Co. is making bold bids for Australian and Canadian
settlement in Rhodesia. It is offering to the colonial sol-
diery farms of 3090 acres each, grants of cattle, and a
retaining fee of £25 per annum per man for military ser-
vice. As between individuals these are very enticing
terms, perhaps too enticing. The objection naturally
entertained here to their acceptance is that these
troops were sent to S’Africa to fight in the Em-
pire’s cause, and that having done that with much
success this co,, which was very heavily benefited
by what the colonials did, is seeking to retain
the pick .of them there as farmer-soldiers to secure its
own safety in the future. Admittedly some of the Im-
perial Bushmen went there as free lances, and with an
unconcealed intention to better themselves by settling in
South Africa if they could. They were, in a way, soldiers
of fortune. But there was no suspicion that this idea
would be applied generally, that by Imperial or South
African effort Australians would be induced to remain in
the Transvaal or the Orange River Colony. If that had
been foreseen, probably there would have been less
enthusiasm about sending soldiers to the front;
for the idea was to demonstrate the Empire’s solidity,
not to play into the hands of a body like the Char-
tered Co., which is composed of speculative individuals,
and has already done more harm than good by its
meddlesomeness. Mr. Seddon, the M.L. Premier, has
practically resented this scheme to absorb the pick of the
colonial soldiers by declaring as forcefully as he could
that no permits to stay in f’Africa would be granted by
his Govt. It threatens to become necessary for other
Governments to take the same course, and discourage to
the best of their ability this ungrateful effort to denude
the colonies of the men they need.
How the Glory is fading !

Queensland papers are just now filled with the
wails of dissatisfied contingenters. It is alleged
that, on their arrival at Pretoria attempts were
immediately made to induce the men to join the
police, enter the railway service, and so forth.
Those who stuck to the Queensland force were
subjected to a sort of boycott, put on half-rations
now and again, and treated in a shabby
fashion generally. How far these allegations
are justified one can hardly say, but it
is remarkable that hardly a single letter
has been received from the Queensland
boys expressing either pleasure or satisfaction
at the treatment received. “ Smiler ” Hales tells
that during his captivity in the Boer camp he never
heard a single complaint from Kruger’s warriors.
But, then, the Dutchman isn’t vaguely fighting
for wanes! By way of counterblast to that munifi-
cent offer of £1 and 255. a day recently made by
Rhodesian authorities, the following extract from
a letter written to the North Queensland
Register by Ransome, a well-known North
Queenslander, might be quoted: “I do not see
that work will be possible at Johannesburg
till the beginning of next year. The coast towns
are full of men wanting to get away. At Durban
400 white men are working for the Corporation at
3s. and 4s. a day (find themselves), and hun-
dreds of others cannot find employment at all. To
railway men I might mention that several men
who previously earned £lO a month arrived here
lately, and were offered £5 a month by the Natal
Railways. Natal is not a white man’s country at
all.” . . . And yet they call Natal the Garden of
South Africa.
The A.N.A., in its agitation for the establishment
of one municipal government for all Melbourne,
has taken up the stra g t,. honest, and democratic
idea of removing the matter altogether out of the
province of the many mayors and sets of aider-
men, and appealing direct to the people. It pro-
poses agitating for an Enabling Bill under which
the people of Greater Melbourne will elect a Con-
vention, and the Convention will draw up a
municipal constitution for the whole metropolitan
area, the draft constitution to be afterwards sub-
mitted to the popular vote for acceptance or re-
jection. Mayors, aldermen, town clerks, and
other interested Bumbles are simply to be left
out. Even the tiredest Government can t excuse
itself for want of time, for the necessary Enabling
Act would be of the shortest, and the people
would do the rest. And the most stagnant
Government can’t object on the ground that the
time isn’t ripe,” for this is simply a proposal to
let the people; interested say, by direct vote,
whether the time is ripe or not, it it isn t ripw
they will reject the proposed municipal constitu-
tion, and no harm will be done.
The Bulletin receives this letter from Matti
Kurikka, spokesman of the Finnish immigrants
to Queensland: —
Cairns, Smitfield, August 3, 1900.
Dear, sir,—ln your respectable paper is a article, where
you say that we Finns may never be permitted to leave
Australia. But think you that the present Qovernment
of Queensland, knowing my political views, will do some

these few hundred Finns, who already .arrived here, in
their enthusiasm not waiting until I had time to :t'Ve my

if the terms for their settling are satisfying, week
on summertime there is emigrating from 660-1000 peisons

their lucky without some leading. If I, as a most P.°P“!* r
writer ami one of the first leaders of the Labour in t in-
land, can assure them satisfactive existence, the enngra-
tion will increase twoduble. ,
Thus if there are one other governement of the Austra-

to its disposition. 1 have yet possiblity to return my
promise for Canada, because I haven t yet got a reply to

The projjosal that the new staff of Public Servants
created by the Sydney Harbor Trust Bill is not
to come under the control of N.S.W. Public Ser-
vice Board wants a lot of explaining to justify it.
Equally the clause that the legal business of the
Trust is to be done independently of the expensive
Crown Law department. What with the Railway,
Legislature, Water and Sewerage Board and.
Lunacy Department staffs, as many Public Ser-
vants are already beyond the Board’s control as
within it ! And if Parliament has decreed that
half the Public Service can best be governed by a
body like the Board, it is hard to see why t’ e
other half should not come under it. The other
day Premier Lyne said, re the new Sydney Harbor
Trust Bill: “The criticisms that lam anxious to
undermine the Public Service Board are not justi-
fied. My desire in this Bill is to enable the new
commissioners to have control of their professional
officers and not to have a number of incompetent
men placed under them.” Which is indeed rough
on the Public Service Board. And two whole
pages of Hansard, devoted to explaining this
ambiguous statement, do not make the situation
much clearer from the Premier's point of view.

“P.H.C.” on the naming of the N.S.W. Federal
electorates: —
The objection that the suggested aboriginal names for
the N.S.W. electorates are uneuphonious and unpro-
nounceable is not of much weight, for the majority have
a melody which will soon “catch on,” and a settled
official spelling will render them pronounceable by all.
Much to be deplored is the increasing tendency to forsake
old place-names for new-fangled appellations, and
it is to be hoped this effort to revive them will
not be frustrated. If the abounding beauty-spots of
Sydney harbour had retained their native names,
their charm would have been materially enhanced.
Compare some of these names, as follows with their
present substitutes : “ Burra-birra ” (the home of fishes):
“The Sow and Bigs”; “Mil Mil” (the eyes): “Goat
Island ” ; “ Koree ” (where waters kiss the sand):
“ Chowder Bay ” ; “ Tarra ” (beside the waters) :
“Slaughter-house Point.” Let us, where euphony is not
sacrificed, retain the native names to keep alive the early
traditions of a fast vanishing people. But if, as has been
suggested, the divisions be named after historical
personages—makers of the Empire—let us at least have
the independence to confine ourselves to the names
of men of Australia; though perhaps in after
years they would have even less meaning than
the proposed aboriginal names. In the suggested
aboriginal names there are evidences of hasty
selection and haphazard spelling, apparently the
result of not seeking the help of the few persons
in the province who are competent authorities on abori-
ginal ethnology and philology. For example, the Wirra-
dari electorate, which bears the name of one of the largest
native tribes is, according to some authorities, situated
too far westward ; for the tribe in question is supposed
to have extended from Booligal on the Lachlan to Orange
—or perhaps to Bathurst. The word itself, too, is vari-
ously spelt “ Wurradjerry,” “ Wiradhurri,” “ Wirad-
thuri,” “ VViraduri,” &c. Then again, the name of
“ Kamalari ” division has been spelt by good authorities
as “ Kamilaroi,” which is certainly more euphonious.
These are but two instances of the necessity for the co-
operation of experts in philology and specialists in abori-
ginalities in determining the .correct pronunciations and
spellings before an official orthography is adopted.

Vic. Assembly seems to have suddenly awakened
to the “messenger” scandal in the Postal Dept.
Trenwitii had recently something to say about
the messengers who “received only £6O a year,
which had been increased by an allowance
to £9O a year;” and melancholy Vale,
M.L.A. (the Vale of Tears), came forward
with a discovery of “600 men who receive
only £6O a year.” The bitter cry of the grey-
headed messenger engaged in bringing up a family
on about £6 a month has been “under considera-
tion ” bv a Reclassification Board, but nobody
expected much from any Board that has to deal
with a professedly insolvent department, and
nobody is surprised at its colorless report. If the
Post and Telegraph Service of Victoria doesn’t
pay expenses (and it says it doesn’t), the position
of those 600 employes was not likely to be much
improved. The Board practically advises them
to seek employment elsewhere. Meanwhile, the
case against the Dept, is being understated, rather
than otherwise. A lot of smart telegraph work
is performed in Vic. country offices by messengers
of 20 years of age, and older, who receive less than
£4O a year.

The disclosures of the inquiry into the charges
against certain officers of the big Callan Park
Hospital for the Insane by N;S.W. Publics Service
Board have revealed the startling fact that the
system of inspection now observed in N.S.W.

The departmental permanent head is styled the
Inspector-General of the Insane, but he has no
inspectors under him and he has no time for
personal inspection. Though the Executive Council

The “Power of Wealth, ” which occupies
Sydney Criterion with no special relation to its
°J VI J napie, is a rather respectable dramatic version
oi Marie Corelli’s “ Vendetta.” There are also
fleeting reminiscences of “Monte Christo ” about
tiie story, but then it is hard to find a sensation of
any kind that isn’t more or less reminiscent of
. Monte Christo,” nearly all the sensations on
earth being in that book more or less. The title
is the weakest part of the tale, for though
•1 bun pier is fabulously rich, and has to struggle
hard to keep his head above lias income, arid
though he is the best of husbands, yet his young
wife is mashed on an unsuccessful man who paints
‘cows looking over a fence and other unsaleable
works of art. The husband and the other man
are friends, and when the husband is struck by
catalepsy the other man is the only one who knows
that it is catalepsy, and not death. So he judici-
ously hastens the burial, and proposes to the widow
and is refused. About this time a white-bearded
man with blue spectacles and a fixed expression of
eye begins to pervade the drama. Me drops into
it quite casually. He is rich and popular, but
everybody has an uneasy impression that he has
Seen that white-bearded man before somewhere.
.Nobody can really locate him, but his voice and
the unearthly way he looks through his blue spec-
tacles shake people up. His eye is the baleful eye
of ltdrnond Dantes m the second volume. He
marries the widow of the nobleman whose kind
friend buried him alive. The kind friend, who still
expected to marrv the rich widow himself, uses
language just like that heard at a meeting of
. ) driey aldermen, and is killed in a duel for doing
it. Even when he is dying he is almost sure that
the eye which looks at him through the blue spec-
tacles is an eye he has seen before soinewhere, and
in a future state it probably pursues him over the
coals m a place that need not bo further men-
tioned. The new wife is also haunted by that
rnore or less familiar eye, both waking and in her
sleep. And at last one day the eye fixes her
worse than usual, and it is explained to her as a
kind of birthday present that she has re-married
her dead husband. He has broken out of the
grave, and tipped up the tomb and the epitaph,
and come back to make inquiries.
* * * *
And just here the drama goes wrong.
For Mr. Dam pier takes his re-married wife to the
family vault where she planted him, and sentences
her to life-long imprisonment among the ghosts,
lie is going to call round regularly with her daily
Victuals and her jug of water, but apart from
these refreshments she is to be numbered with
the dead. Now she is young and strong, and
seems good for 30 years imprisonment, and the
drama can’t finish till she comes to some definite
end, so it is obvious that there must be a long
series of acts showing Dampier, as he grows older
and older, coming in daily with his wife’s food
while she implores him through the keyhole to let
her out. And at last, after long, long years there
must be a patriarchal Dampier tottering under
the burden of the prisoner’s bread and cheese, and
a captive with her clothes fallen to rags, and her
white hair about her feet, and her nails grown to
the length of crowbars, still requesting to be let
out. And to get out of this difficulty the building
illogically falls in on top of the lady and
eloses the proceedings with an abrupt bump.
A few people leave a footprint of some size
in this drama, and a few more leave nothing that
the public could not dispense with. Mr. Dampier
is one of the former as a matter of course. Another
is the ever-welcome George Buller. He has a
very small part as an embittered second-hand-
clothes dealer, who supplies a suit to the
nobleman when he has broken out of his tomb,
but the old clo’ man is a man of might all the
same, and if there was more of him and less of
Some other people who will not be further alluded
to just here, the audience would feel better. Like-
wise John Forde, in a small side-character, has
invented a new way of being intoxicated which
has points of interest about it. If the general
public would get drunk in that way instead of the
very uninteresting way ip which it does get drunk,
the gerieral public when it is drunk wouldn’t be the
miserably commonplace drunk the general public
generally is.

The glad news is hereby conveyed to
Sydney and its surroundings, and the infected
area generally, that Charles Arnold is to open the
Palace on Saturday with “What Happened to

there is no moral in it and no problem, and no
crank with a brow like a tower is ever likely to

ance. There is not the least chance of its becom-
ing a classic, and no one is likely to give “re-
verential productions” of it on Friday nights
three centuries after the author is dust. But it is
a cheery item which comes to Sydney with the
credit of having filled one of the largest theatres
in Australia for so long a time that the public
would probably not believe it if the exact period
was given. Arnold’s Jones is a pleasant commer-
cial bounder who lost his coat-tail at an illegal
prize-fight, and is grievously troubled through
leaving that clue in the horny hand of the law,
and many things result therefrom, including an
archdeacon being turned into a Red Indian.
Louis Lohr manages for Arnold, as before, which
generally means success.

“Rose of Persia” fills Sydney’s biggest
theatre just as full in its fifth week as in its first,
and though Miss Fyvie Dench, the new Dancing
Sunbeam, strikes this paper as rather a poor
apology for the vanished Dorothy Yane, she has
cast no visible shadow on the takings. The new
lady is taller and thinner and more serious than
the former Dancing Sunbeam, and she makes up
the first of Hassan’s 25 wives as an elderly lady of
grim exterior. Miss Vane went on the pleasing
theory that Hassan had married his 25 wives
rapidly, so that the first one was young and can-
tankerous instead of old and cantankerous. But
Miss Carrie Moore’s Heart’s Desire, which was
food at first, has further improved, and Honey of
life, represented by pretty Joey Cassellis, is even
a nicer girl than she promised to be five weeks
ago. Likewise Blush of Morning and Moon Upon
the Waters and Song of Nightingales and Scent of
Lilies, and various other ladies whose names ex-
tend round the cornel’, not forgetting Oasis in
the Desert and Whisper of the West Wind, may
consider themselves honorably mentioned by this
influential paper.

Apropos of that remarkable Sydney society
benefit, which panned-out £3 14s. Id. for the dis-
abled Australian soldiers, and which cost £ll odd
for decorating the Governor’s box, The Bulletin
finds that the £5O for a night’s rent of the theatre
is, at all events, an explainable item —at least, so
far as the receiver thereof was concerned. The
price included rent, use of the theatrical staff, use
of properties, use of the Biograph, and a multi-
tude of sundries. Also, it represented the loss of a
night’s business, for, instead of waiting a few days,
when an empty theatre might possibly be had
gratis, the organisers were seized with the bright
idea of interrupting the run of an existing show.
This naturally ran away with part of the money,
and the other bright ideas with which the
organisers were seized annexed the balance—all
but £3 14s. Id. For months to come, even the
mention in Sydney social circles of any sum end-
ing with 14s. Id. will be an insult to be wiped out
in gore.

Bland Holt’s Jew, and the burglar who
hit his wife, and the deadbeat who used to live on
his relatives, and the noble young man who did no
useful work but depended on the charity of his
uncle, are still enlisting regularly for the Boer
war at Sydney Royal. Even the fading of
Roberts’s star, as weeks follow on weeks, and the
agile De Wet continues to stamp on Roberts’s tail
with both boots > and comparative impunity, and
get away again before the British general can turn
round, has diminished the glory of Bland’s drama
not a whit.

A “ museum of art, physiology, anatomy

he ought to know.

Rickards’ Tivoli programme opens this
week with a patriotic song describing the enthusi-
asm the audience will feel when the S’African
boys came marching home, and the audience
enthuses in a mild fashion and without uudue
frill. It gets much more excited over Wallace
King and Arthur Crane who never even mention
Africa. Madame Cordelia comes out with a ballad
—the tale of the good girl standing up before the
altar with the base deceiver, and the other wife
rising excitedly in the front pew, and re-
marking, “Stop, ere it is too late.” A trio of
Haytors enact the story of a gymnast Editor,
the circulation of whose paper is labelled as reach-
ing a fabulous number of noughts. Billie Barlow
sports two new songs, and only her artistic ability
pulls her through the utter imbecility of one of
them, “Do buy me that, mama.”

The Melb. boom in Bendigo talent, created
by Amy Castles, has passed away like a dream.
T’other Saturday night Lili Sharp took a said-to-
be farewell “ off-to-Europe ” benefit at Melb.
Town Hall, and the fact that she had come from
Bendigo a year ago to put Amy’s nose out of joint
was not of enough importance to draw a decent-
sized audience. Yet Miss Lili is a capable singer
with a good voice. No doubt she would have got
a better footing in Melb. but for the short frock
and juvenile smile which made her somewhat
ridiculous when she first appeared as a prodigy.
Last year, Lili was a mere child of 16, according
to the paragraphers who* had fixed little Amy’s
age at 16 ; and this year the local Herald critic
has the heart to say—“ What is the use of
announcing Miss Sharp as the ‘ young ’ Bendigo
soprano ? Miss Sharp has a valuable voice, but a
great deal of time has been lost in getting it
properly cultivated.” All the same, Lili is not
any older than was the Mrs. Nellie Mitchell Arm-
strong who went away to study for the role of
Madame Melba. Waste of years wouldn’t prevent
her getting to the top of the tree if she were
built that way.

Talking of Bendigo girls .* there should be
a place for Miss Alice Crawford on the Australian
stage. She lately popped up in the background
of Nance O’Neil’s show, and looked very proinis-
ing. Too promising, perhaps. In the next pro-
duction, sweet Alice, the recitress, didn’t get a
chance to pop, though she might have cut a more
imposing figure of a dairymaid than Miss Berry
or Miss Roxy Barton. The blonde Roxy, with
her engaging young lady-like style, is wasted in a
rural hoyden character.

The Broughs’ season at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s will close on Monday, and meanwhile the
programme changes every night or so. “The
Man of Forty,” which ran for a week, was a very
good play in many things, but they Were not the
things of most importance to the pay-box. All
the same, they deserve an affectionate farewell
mention. The happy-go-lucky actress from
Johannesburg, admirably played by Miss Temple;
the living truthfulness of 'Brough’s talks with his
daughter (Miss Noble); the note of wicked, scarlet
velvet sentiment introduced by Miss Bessie
Thompson ; also Leslie Victor’s promising carica-
ture of the Parliamentary ass of 28, who takes
himself seriously, and is to all intents and purposes
a quite elderly nuisance these are durable
memories of a fleeting production.

To-day (Thursday) “ The Liars ” takes its
turns, matinee and evening, in the revivals;
“ Dandy Dick ” comes on Friday, and on Satur-
day “ The Village Priest,” with Brough in the
name-part. “ Niobe ” brings the curtain down on
Monday, and then the Broughs move along to
Adelaide and Perth, and foreign elsewheres. They
will be missed in Melbourne by people who ask
for bevelled edges to their theatrical entertain-
ment and can easily find something new to admire
in the performance of real artists, no matter how
often they have seen them. The man in the
street is apt to say he is “ tired of the
Broughs,” though he usually qualifies the
remark by admitting that they— i.e., the
Broughs and company—pleased him much the
last time he sampled their show. As a
matter of fact, the man in the street is merely
tired of appreciating the Brough company’s
familiar merits at their full value. He wants to
be impressed by something new, or to think he is
being impressed, which amounts to the same
thing, for a few weeks, and he doesn’t trouble to
wonder how it would bear the time test that has
been applied to the Broughs.

At Her Majesty’s, Melbourne the career of
Tess” was to be cut short on Tuesday,
and at time of The Bulletin going to press
revivals of “ Magda ” and “ Hedda Gabler ” were
to extend over the balance of the fortnight which
that unsatisfactory show had been billed for. The
comparative failure of “Tess” is a painful cir-
cumstance for the Nance O’Neil boomsters, inas-
much as the drama went for five weeks in Sydney
with Miss Crane in the name part ; yet it doesn’t
follow .that the massive lady was not “up to
form.” She mostly played the character of the
dairymaid in her two stock moods, alternating the
aggressive mood of Magda with the submissive
mood of Camille, and turning her back to the
audience with unfailing precision at emotional mo-
ments ; also she had plenty of stage thunderstorm
in the air, and lots of clotted blood on her fatal
table-knife, and if red gore isn’t fine acting it
suits a lot of people, anyhow. The company,
apart from Miss Nance, probably accounted for
the heaviness of “ Tess.” Miss Linda Raymond’s
place as thirsty Marian was taken by Miss Ricca
Allen after the first night, and when the two other
subordinate dairymaids took Miss Allen into the
firm th 3 effect of their three boisterous merriments
was particularly amateurish. And there were
other weak spots in the performance—but no mat-
ter. Perhaps “ Tess ” will get a chance to redeem
some of its lost character when the new co. comes
along.
To-night (Thursday) will have “Magda
onthebilL “Hedda Gabler”is to be tried for
one oonseoutive Friday, by “universal request.”
On Saturday, the tardy “Ingomar” starts to
shake his barbario locks for three nights
(“Ingomar,” all things considered, ought to be
the most interesting item in the O’Neil series),
and on Wednesday of next week the majestic cir-
cumference of the leading lady will appear in
selections from four characters, three of them
being new to Melbourne. This little lot includes
“Nanoy Sikes,” which is Melbourne’s first inti-
mation of a lawful marriage between Nancy afore-
said and her burglar Bill. Married or single,
Nancy will be anticipated with awe, on the
strength of news from Sydney to the effect that
Sikes draws berlud from his. shrieking missus at
every stoush.

The last nights of the tiger and the Orphan
Heiress are now “on” at Melbourne Royal, but
The Bulletin views the announcement with a
dry eye. The tiger has lasted for three weeks,
and as an object of zoological interest it is played
out. Moreover, it doesn’t keep up the reputation
of a theatre where a most respectable sham ele-
phant was seen of yore. The elephant wafted
something of an odour of menagerie across the
footlights, and was occasionally believed in
by short - sighted persons. The tiger up to
now has had no believers except one lady)
in an advanced stage of intoxication, who
shrieked at the sight of the strange animal and
was ejected from the Royal premises complaining
that she had got ’em again. On Saturday manager
Anderson will stage some more military drama,
entitled “ Serving the Queen.”

it is understood that Paul Martinetti will set up

One cheering piece of information in Treas.
Shiels’ budget is the notification that Victoria’s Credit
Foncier system is progressing vigorously. Total advances
to farmers since 24/12/’96, £973,435 ; £182,490 advanced
during last financial year. Total number of borrowers,
2033 ; average amount of loans, £440 17s. 9d. Only 12
instalments are in arrears, and the whole lot together
make up but a paltry £IOO 15s. lOd. Since the initiation
of the system, only six properties on which advances had
been made have been sold in default, and in each case the
amount of debt with accrued interest has been recovered.
Where is the private bank that could show such a record ?
* * * *
It is curious to find the Sydney Telegraph
quoting, in its financial columns, as an evidence that the
A.M.P. Society will gain by extending its business
to a country where interest is lower than in
Australia, the fact that the Bank of N.S.W. has been
pushing its business in recent times of low interest just as
it did in times of high interest, and profiting thereby.
This is the sort of specious analogy which appeals to
people who can’t recognise a difference, even when it is as
large as Chimborazo. A bank is a proprietary affair. If it
had £8,000,000 of deposits in Australia on which it earned a
net profit of £1 per cent., that would»*iean £BO,OOO a year
for the shareholders. And if it could extend its business to
a, country where profits were much lower than in Austra-
lia, and get £8,000,000 more deposits there, and invest them
to yield it only ss. per cent, net, that would mean an-
other £20,000, making the profits from deposits £IOO,OOO
That would be good enough. The A.M.P., on the other
hand, is a mutual concern. If its Australian business
yielded, say, £BO,OOO a year by excess of interest earnings
above the estimate, that would, while it confined itself to
Australia, mean £BO,OOO in bonuses to Australian policy-
holders from this source alone. And if it started an
equally large business in England, but, by reason of the
lower interest rates there, its equally large English in-
vestments only yielded £20,000 surplus interest, that
wouldn’t mean raising the Australian profits to £IOO,OOO,
as in the bank’s case. It would mean reducing them to
£50,000. The Australian and English businesses (of
equal size) would yield £IOO,OOO profit between them, and
each set of policy-holders would take half. The figures
are merely put in for purposes, of illustration; it is the
principle that needs to be driven home with a steam-
hammer. Getting new business that yields any kind of a
profit, even if it is only a tenth of the profit obtained
from the old business, is gain to a proprietary institution.
But in a mutual life office things don’t work like that.
There is no more relation between the cases of the A.M.P.
and the Bank of N.S.W. in this matter than between an
analogy and an Afghan.
* » * *
The A.M.P directors have so far admitted the
unsatisfactory nature of the proxy device for taking the
real sense of the members that a straight out-vote is to be
called for. The question to be submitted to the members
is this: Shall the A.M.P., which, by confining its
operations to Australasia, has grown, to be one of the
largest and most prosperous and' most cheaply-managed
life insurance institutions on earth, and which pays about
the biggest bonuses on earth, and does nearly half the
business of the. healthiest country on earth, and which is
the only life institution in the world that, in its own
line, bosses a whole continent, and which is already
growing faster than it ever grew . before—shall it be
content to let these magnificent results alone, and
stick to the lines which have made it prosperous.
Or, shall it empower its directors at their sole
discretion, to extend the business to any part of the
British empire— to the fever haunts of India and Ceylon
and Burmah and the White Man’s Graves of the West
African coast, or even to England, where the death-rate
is nearly 50 per cent, higher and the interest-rate lower
than in Australia, and where even the best British com-
panies can’t manage to earn such profits as the A.M.P.
does in Australia ; and thereby reduce Australian bonuses
by sharing profits with outside policy-holders whose busi-
ness is less profitable than our own? Is it worth doing
this merely to make the institution larger when it is so
large already, seeing that increased size has no connec-
tion at all with increased profits, and to gratify the vanity
of the men in command who (quite naturally aad reason-
ably) are proud of the size of their institution? Is it
worthwhile? The Bulletin says No !

The Bank of New Zealand, on 31st March, 1900
closed its fifth complete year under State control. When
the State took it over from the private management
which worked such unutterable ruin, there was, even
after a very heavy writing off of capital, an immense
amount of losses unprovided for which had to be made
good out of profits. In 1895 all the called and uncalled
capital of the private shareholders was lost, and an im-
mense amount besides. The State, as the only share-
holder who had any real money in the concern, had every
possible right to throw the private shareholders out bodily,
and make the concern a State Bank pure and simple
and keep whatever profits might be made in the’
future for its own use. It had a double right to do
this, for not only was it the only shareholder
who had any real money in the concern, but it was taking
over, as an act of grace, the private shareholders’ debts
losses and shortages. If it had called-up the last penny of
the old private capital, and had then utterly ejected the
private shareholders, it would still have been doing an act
of grace, inasmuch as it would be taking over heavy
losses which they still left unprovided for. But with
amazing magnanimity the Maoriland Government lent its
brams, its credit and guarantee, and the support of
£2,500,000 of cash to pull the decayed institution round
and set to work to make up the old losses out of earnings’
so as to save something for the private shareholders. And
it does this with no reward whatever ; for it charges the
bank only the exact amount it itself pays on the money it
?T v ??. ce< * the bank. By good management it has saved
itself from loss, and is also rescuing the private shareholders
froma great part of the disasters which they themselves
c.reated. And the private shareholders show no special
sign of gratitude for being thus saved from utter ruin
and put in the way to earn big dividends in the future. ’

31st March in each of the five complete years of State
management has been as follows
During five years of State control, therefore, the Bank
of New Zealand, whose previous career had been so con-
sistently downhill, has managed to pay full interest on its
deposits, to pay the interest, or dividend, on the money
which the State advanced to it (at cost price), and to pay
off £399,072 of its old accumulated losses. Which isn’t a
bad record for State management. The earnings this
year are equal to £8 6s. 2d. per cent per annum on the
bank’s capital and guaranteed stocks ; but if these latter
are regarded rather as deposits at a fixed rate of interest,
then the profits are £145,020, equal to £34 11s. 4d. per
cent per annum on the capital of £419,519. This latter is
how things stand as regards the private shareholders.
The State takes a small fixed rate of interest on its
advances, and over and above that it is earning profits for
the private shareholders at the rate of £34 11s. 4d. per
cent on the private shareholders’ capital of £419,519, and ap-
plying the money to pay off the private shareholders’
debts and losses.

The Bank of New Zealand, like the Commercial
Bank of Australia, has an “assets trust.” Its deadest
assets, mostly big foreclosed estates, were handed over to
the Assets Realisation Board along with about £2,700,000
of debenture liabilities. In this matter, again, the State
treated the bank with remarkable liberality. The bank
has to pay £50,000 a year towards the Board’s shortage
till it is all paid off, but it is not liable for any losses
beyond that figure. The B.N.Z. Assets Realisation Board
does regularly every year, without turning a hair, the very
thing which the Commercial Bank of Australia’s directors
say they can’t do—it publishes a full statement of receipts
and expenditure, shows how far the revenue meets the
outgoings, what losses are made each year through the
sale of property below its book value, and gives as full a
statement of the Assets Realisation Board’s position as it
does of that of the Bank. And the directors of the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia say they can’t (or won’t) do
this. At 31st March, 1897, the Assets Realisation Board
showed a visible deficit of £185,411. That is to say, the
liabilities were £2,711,320, and the assets, taken at' their’
paper value, were only £2,525,909. Also there were un-
limited possibilities of increase in this deficit, through
the sale of properties below their paper value.,- Since
then the Board has progressed thus :

It thus appears that the income gets nearer to meeting
expenditure every year—in fact it seems as if the B.N.Z.
Assets Realisation Board might soon be able to make
income cover expenditure. The contribution from the
bank has more than covered all shortages of income up to
date, and the total deficiency, despite heavy, losses on
realisation of properties, has a tendency to-diminish. The
bank has still somewhere between £200,000 and £400,000
of dead assets to write off, according to how the proper-
ties turn out; and it may have to continue paying
£50,0 ‘0 a year to the Assets Realisation Board for another
ten year 3 or so according to how its properties turn out.
But the v, rk of clearing off the burden left by the old
private m gement is progressing very rapidly. It is
quite possib. • (if Maoriland keeps prospering) that less
than 10 years i,,\v.see everything cleared up.

Port Jackson Co-operative Steamship Co. (Syd-
ney) shows a profit, ad or writing-off £3923 for deprecia-
tion, of £1734 for tu; year ended 30th June, 1900.
Including £1768 bronght forward from previous year
there is £3502 available. A dividend of 5 per cent, to
shareholders for the year (it is described as dividend-for
the half-year at 10 per cent, per annum, which is the
same thing) has already absorbed £1250. Interest to de-
benture-holders at 2$ per cent, for the year (it is called a
half-year’s interest at 5 per cent, per annum) has absorbed
£219. No further dividend is paid, but £lOO9 is
written off goodwill, reducing it to £2OOO ; and £1033 is
carried forward. It isn’t what could be called a cheerful
balance-sheet, by any means. The P. J.S.S. 00. has no
reserve, save only the £1033 undivided balance above-
mentioned, and as there is a paper asset of £2OOO for
goodwill on the other side its assets are reallv £967 less
than its liabilities to shareholders and the public. Also,
the co. gets a nasty knock from the Brighton-Brunner
collision, which, no matter who is in the wrong (the
Navigation Dept, enquiry has gone against the P.J.S.S.
Oo.) will inevitably cost a lot of money.

At June, 1893, the Victoria Insurance 00. had £78,601 of
reserves (reserve fund, £50,000 ; contingency fund,
£15,000; and undivided profits, £13,601). Its reserves
are now £54,753 (reserve-fund, £25,000 ; re-insurance
fund, £11,838 ; contingency fund, £BOOO ; and un-
divided profits, £9915). This is a very considerable
fall. In the last seven - years dividends have
exceeded profits by £3848. For some years prior to 1898,
the Victoria Insurance Co., with incredible fatuity, went
on paying from 35 to 44 per cent, dividends, while admit-
ting that there were heavy losses, through depreciation
of securities, to be provided for. It paid away
its profits riotously, and made no effort to pro-
vide for losses till 1898, When it wrote £20,000
off its reserves. Judging by the fact that last year
the co.’s investments only yielded about £2 Bs. per
cent, on their nominal value, it seems doubtful if they
were written-down sufficiently even then to bring them to
their real value, and the establishment this year of a con-
tingency fund of £BOOO seems to point in the same direc-
tion. The Victoria Insurance Co. never had a reserve-fund
at all commensurate with the size of its business, and the
intense desire to keep paying the biggest dividends in
Australia when the earnings didn’t justify it has greatly
reduced the strength of the institution.
* * * *
The Victoria General Insurance Co. (Melb.),
which is a sort of off-shoot of the Victoria Insurance Co.,
reports a rather bad year to 30th June, 1900—or rather it
is a rather good year, but not good enough to support the
extravagance of a management which is possessed with a
mad desire to pay 20 per cent, dividends even when the
earnings don’t justify it. The recent record of the Vic-
toria General Insurance co. is as follows :
Profits. Dividends.

The Victoria General is a young office yet—
.t was founded in 18S9. It has £20,000 paid-up capital and
£11,238 of reserves (reserve fund, £5OOO ; undivided profit,;
£2238; and contingency fund, £4000). It is admitted
almost in so many words that the contingency fund of
£4OOO is required, in whole or in part, to cover deprecia-
tion of assets not written off, so the real reserves may pos-
sibly be set down at £7238. The pernicious custom of
keeping inflated paper values standing in the balance-
sheet, instead of writing them off and showing only the
real assets, can’t be too strongly reprehended. At 30th
June, 1893, the Victoria General had £13,722 of reserves,
so it has faded badly since then, solely by reason of the
inflated-dividend disease. Its premium income has
diminished by over £lOOO since 1893, and its revenue
from interest and rents has dropped from £1854 to £ll6O.
Altogether the Victoria General doesn’t look like a con-
cern with a future-before it, though there is nothing but
the ruinous policy of the board to complain of. That
seems to be gradually eating the company up.

The Victoria Life and General Insurance Co. is
a proprietary life co. which was once of high standing,
but which went, out of active business long ago and is now

As the Victoria Life and General Co. has no desire ior u e w
business now, and accepts none, there is no necessity to
give bonuses by way of attracting insurers. Therefore,
the shareholders have a great and glorious time. The
total insurances remaining in force are supposed to be
about £200,000, or perhaps a little less—the continuous
fall in premiums shows how-last the ancient policy-holders
are dropping off. To cover this, and refund the share-
holders their £40,000 capital when the last ancient pegs
out, there are assets of a nominal value of £364,000, but
as the amounts actually invested only yielded last year
about £2 14s. 6d. per cent, on their nominal value, it
isn’t rlikely that the present value of the lot is over
£260,000. Even at that rate, however, there should be
many more big dividends for the shareholders before the
last insured goes to his long home.

The Australian Gaslight Co. (Sydney) earned
£47,879 for half-year to 30th June, which compares as
follows:
June, 1895.. ..£48,357 June, 1898.. ..£47,922
Dec., 1895.. .. 53,701 Dec., 1898.. .. 54,155

June, 1897.. .. 48,435 June, 1900 .. .. 47,879
Dec., 1897 .. .. 54,742
The invariable 15 per cent, dividend uses up £51,135, so
the balance at credit of profit and loss is diminished from
£6798 (o £3542. The Sydney Gas 00. is a much smaller
concern than the Melbourne institution, with less capital
and less reserves. But it doesn’t carry anything like the
load of borrowed money that the Melbourne co. does;
which is part of the cause of its unfailing 15 per cent, as
compared with the Melbourne rival’s humble 8.

The unobtrusive little report of the Perpetual
Trustees, Executors and Agency Co., of Tasmania (Hobart)
sets forth that the profits for the six months to 30th
June, 1900, were £3BO. The usual 6 per cent, dividend
absorbs £3OO and dividend-tax is £l5, so the co. improves
to the extent of £65. The Hobart institution doesn’t
vary much in its earnings, and its 6 percent, dividend is as
regular as the sunrise. It has a paid-up capital of £lO,OOO
and £4308 reserves (reserve fund £4OOO, and £3OB un-
divided profits). At June, 1892, the total reserves were
£1496, so in eight years the co. has improved to the
extent of £2812. Yet the average earnings are lower now
than they were some years ago, as shown underneath :
June,,’92 £319 June, ’95 £526 June, ’9B £420
Dec., ’92 847 Dec., ’95 435 Dec., ’9B 421

Whether the trustee business has fallen off or whether
there has been a serious slump in the returns from invest-
ments it is impossible to say, for the income from all
sources is lumped together in one item after a most
unbusiness-like fashion. Therefore, there is no evidence
on which to base an opinion as to whether the assets
(largely described simply as “investments”) have de-
teriorated below their paper value or not.~ The average
Tasmanian balance-sheet is a document which preserves a
great silence on many interesting points, and this is one
of the silences.

Out of the paid-up capital of £480,000.it is only claimed
that £400,000 was actually paid up by the shareholders in
cash, so at this rate they received 6 per cent, in 1893-4-5-
6-7 and ’8 on the cash they actually laid out; £7 4s. per
cent, in 1899, and £9 12s. per cent, in 1900. At this rate,
and saving nothing of the 18 per cent, they received in
1892 and even larger dividends before that, the Melbourne
Tramway 00. has been doing very well in the worst
times.: A good deal of the obtrusive weeping of the
management about the practical impossibility of giving
the employes an eight-hour day, as specified in the
original agreement, appears quite uncalled for.

S.A. Govt., having got a majority to vote down
the proposed veto of the railway by-law raising Barrier
ore-freights, wisely bends so far as to propose a reduc-
tion in the freights of some mill-products ; the proposal is
to bring them back to the old level. This is no doubt
the answer to the several directorates which have com-
plained that the increase knocked out their experiments
in the treatment of slimes.

Thanks to the obscurity of the quarter-century-
old N.S.VV. Municipalities Act, a fine, fat law-suit has
begun over the long-disputed question of the local taxa-
tion of Broken Hill mines. The Labor-party having at
last got into power in the B.H. Council, asked the co.’s
for nearly £20,000 of town rates for the year ; and at the
same time it prepared to fight the co.’s in the only two
places it thought possible—the local municipal Appeal
Court and the Privy Council. But the co.’s, advised in
the first place, it seems, by barrister Bryant, of Melb.,
have hit the local Council in a quite unexpected way with
a suit in Equity to restrain it from proceeding with the
collection of the rate. Pending the settlement of the B.H.
matter, the Wyalong Council and companies, between
whom a similar row was beginning, have compromised
“ without prejudice.”

B.H. South, which has not shared in the reduc-
tions of the charge for water by the Water Supply Co.,
announces that it is prepared to join in with others to do
something ; the 5s per 1000-gals, for water for ore-dressing
is, the directors say, preposterous. Meantime, Minister
O’Sullivan remits to the Works Committee the question
of carrying out the Umberumberka Creek scheme, re-
cently taken up and dropped by B.H. Prop. Anyhow,
seeing that B.H. is now entirely dependent on the con-
centrating mills, and seeing that those mills can’t run
without plenty water, B.H. people are becoming more
certain than ever that wisdom will not be satisfied with a
single source of supply. The fact that at present, despite
the very fair season, the supply in the reservoir is lower
than it was even during last drought has sobered-up a lot
of sanguine people.

The proprietors of Robinson and Rice’s, sensa-
tional mine, Long Flat, Gundagai, evidently hold no
mean opinion of their show. The other morning working-
partner Rice knocked out in a few minutes a bag of ore
from a rich shute, in the presence of several representa-
tive mining men, including E. A. Mannheim, general
manager of the Howell gold-mines. The stuff was quite
as good as that previously taken out. One lump, weigh-
ing 101 b., is estimated to contain upwards of lOOoz. of
gold. The contents of the bag are valued at from £lOOO
to £l2OO. Half of a prospecting dish of fine dirt taken
from the bag was washed, and panned out about 250 z.
fine gold. Gold still shows quite as well in the roof of
the drive and the rise, there being apparently a seam of
almost pure gold. Speaking to a mining reporter after-
wards, Mr. Rice said he was assured that it was the
best mine in the world ; there was nothing in Westralia
like it. But the man who finds a tubful of gold always
talks like that. Where now is the Londonderry, on the
golden knobs whereof you could hang your hat ? And
the Beyers and Holtermann show ? But we could go on
for ever.

' John Howell advocates the erection in Australia
of plants for separating and refining complex bullion.
Says the greatest sufferer is the producer- of crude ore
who, in selling his ore to the local reduction works, has
to submit to heavy charges to cover cost of freight, etc ,
etc. The Bulletin goes further than Mr. Howell in advo-
cating the erection of National Smelting and Refining
Works. It would make it a Federal undertaking. .Neither
Bapto nor Cockle Creek works fills the hill: For instance,
a few weeks ago these companies introduced a 2s. 6d-per-
unit realisation-charge on copper, equal to £l2 10s. per
ton ; so that, when copper was .selling in London at £72
10s., the producer in Australia- would get £6O. There
could be only one of two reasons for this awful charge—
either the smelting co’s Were squeezing the locals, or they
were being robbed themselves in London. The London
smelting co’s are well-known robbers. It has been going
on for generations, and, though the erection of National
Smelting Works in Australia would not stop it altogether,
it would iniiii.uise.it so far as Australia was concerned. It
cost the Jit. Lyell people over £lOO,OOO before they got a
fair price for their copper, and it all went iii sheer
robbery, which drove the co. to America for a
market. Robbery on the part of the smelting people
in London caused the Cobar tributors to erect their
own electrolytic works at Lithgow. If any further proof
is wanted of these smelting robberies it is only necessary to
call for account sales and hundreds of them are available.
They commence as a rule “ Bought of you to-day ” instead
of “Robbed of you to-day.” A lawyer’s bill‘is the per-
sonification of modesty compared to them. If copper is
standing at £72 for Chili bars—which means 96 per cent,
copper—and your copper goes 97 per cent., the chances
are the noble London smelter will take it at £69, but he
doesn’t stop there. A2£ per cent, discount is made under
the rules of the Metal Exchange, another 355. off on the
present price. Some big consignors don’t pay it, but all
the little ones have to. Then there is £ per cent, commis-
sion for the agent, who. is too often the buyer as well— to
say nothing of sampling, assaying, wear-and-tear, insur-
ance, bills of lading, losses in shipment and other things.
National Smelting Works would not stop it all, but
would certainly reduce it over 50 per cent., and this 50
per cent, would soon pay for the work. The market-price
of copper is one thing ; what people mining it in Aus-
tralia get is quite another.

Editor Bulletin.—Re par in issue 11/8/’OO anent
Madbuck mine. It is not true that the mine “is
being worked as though the owners were afraid to break
the stuff down and send it; to market.” The co. employs
12 men. There are three shafts on the property, one
205 ft. deep, and the other two each 70ft. In addition over
300 ft. of driving has been done at the different levels: So
far all the work done is development and it was in this
work that all the ore that has been sent away was got.
No stoping has been attempted. The 40 tons ore sent to
the smelters averaged 21.2 per cent, copper. The lode
has just been tapped at 200 ft. level, the borings being
Boft black sulphide ore. —The Secretary,

The Western Consolidated Silver Mines (No
Liability) of Zeehan, Tasmania, announces in the adver-
tising columns of this number a further issue of 60,000
shares of 2s. each, payable in six instalments. There are
120,000 shares issued, all fully paid, and 20,000 are still
unissued. The co. has 350 acres adjoining the famous
Western Silver Mines, and the necessary plant, including
a railway and other trifles, is already on the ground, and
paid for. The object of the present issue is to raise some
more cash for the purpose of opening up the min©, and
the directors are sanguine that the expenditure of another
£2OOO or £3OOO will get'the co. into a dividend-paying
condition. ' - -

“ Wilka : ” A word about Tarcoola (S.A.) gold-
field. The Wai tin tin. ranges are situated in one of the
most dismal and waterless "stfetches' of country in all
S. A.—about 600 miles N. W. of Adelaide. At present there
are about 150 men on the field, and-up to date a few fine
colors have been found, which might at most go 5 or 6
dwts. to the ton. There are two or three shows on which
rich gold has been found, but so little work has been done
on them that it’s impossible to say whether they will
continue at depth. The field has hitherto depended for
water entirely on a few small rock-holes, and though a
condensing co. has been formed no supply of even
salt water has so far been discovered, and it is pretty
certain that when summer approaches the population
of Tarcoola will be considerably decreased. The
average rainfall for the district is about sin., and
there are no creeks or places where water could be con-
served, consequently camels only will be of use for a long
time to come. Such finds as have been made were all in
a low range of quartzite hills about two miles long, with
heavy sandhills on each side covering all outcrops;
thereby making prospecting expensive and tedious, and
showing that the golden zone for so far is very limited.
As usual on mining fields there is much shepherding of
claims by city men, who have never seen the place and
only intend to make capital of their property when the
workers have proved the value or otherwise of the field.
Only in very few instances are the regulations complied
with by these mining sharks. When the field was first
started stores, &c., were a reasonable price, but cartage has
already gone up nearly 50 p.c.—so it is anything but a
poor man’s field. To show the utter poverty and naked-
ness of the land, I may state that all, or nearly all, the
stations to the N.E. and E. have been abandoned—hun-
dreds of thousands of sheep having died or been removed.
Not even rabbits can be found, and no tribe of natives
was ever known to have lived in the country.

“ Colo” : A few facts re two of the most-talked-
of mines in North Murchison (W.A.) district—the “ Horse-
Shoe” and the “Peak Hill.” The former is located in a
curved range of hills, from which gold has apparently de-
parted in the form of alluvial on to the flats upon one side
only. Said hills have been burrowed into from all sides
by recent prospectors, without revealing anything sensa-
tional. The Horse-Shoe was recently floated in London
for £250,000 —£4(10,000 of which is set aside for working
capital. Present management is working things very sys-
tematically, but so far has met no gold. Workings show
the hills to be interspersed with quartz and ironstone
veins, carrying a fair amount of, as some think, galena.
Strange that these leases, which have been worked off and
on for the last nine years by prospectors and other com-
panies, without profit except from flotation, should now
be looked upon as a second Mt. Morgan by the locals,
some even venturing to predict that it will shortly rival
the Peak. But the gold does not seem forthcoming.
Peak Hill mine is cheaply worked owing to its
deposits being in kaolin, the most costly item being tim-
ber, which has to be carted 12 miles, and costs the co. as
high as 4s. 6d. per stick. All miners working below have
continuously to prospect faces of stopes ana drives, and
throw what they consider mullock into the worked-out
stopes. It is believably stated that there are tons
of rejected ore, that would pay handsomely,
thrown in as mullock to fill up the workings.
Present writer has himself seen shots put into the stopes
(which needed no shooting), scatter fragments of ore into
the.mullock-stopes that were being filled-in. With the
kaolin quartz is cement, the quartz-veins in most places
carrying gold, but the kaolin..being very patchy. The
deepest part of the mine is about IBoft. down, and is said
to be wanting in kaolin and gold, but to be “ all there ”
as far as-a' quartz-leader is concerned. Personally, Ido
not think the gold in the kaolin or veins has ever been in
touch with water, ag some alluvial miners contend, though
that it has been subjected to volcanic process at one time
the layers of kaolin and burnt quartz indicate. All men
working below in this mine have, when coming off a shift,
to strip naked in the presence of searchers. Also, there
are two special men told off to bag rich ore and keep an
eye on things Below, yet even then men have been
arrested for having specimens in their camps which were
said to have come from the mine. There are no cages for
haulage purposes or for lowering workers ; all ore is
raised in huge buckets ; the miners find their way up and
down per ladder. Strange that the present co., which
has had the mine for nearly four vears, and during that
period has paid £120,000 in divs., has not had the grit to
put down a 200 ft. shaft to test the depth of payable ore.
The winze sunk from the lower level of the workings
remains as a sealed book ; possibly on account of kaolin
and gold petering out. “My face is my fortune, sir, she
said.”

The Sullivan Syndicate at Chambers Creek,
near Bathurst, is erecting a battery plant pn its 24-acre
lease. The show is a likely one and gives promise of
development into a valuable property. The mill has a
capacity of about 40 tons a week. It is of the fast run-
ning type designed for prospecting, and has three 9001 b.
stamps and a triple discharge. The plant was supplied
by the Parke and Lacy Co., who make a speciality of
prospecting outfits.

Outside Pretoria.—Queensland Bushmen’s

rides into Imperial troopers’ lines after being
warned several times. “Look here, my man,
says the Colonel, “I’ve told you before to keep
out of our ranks, so be off!” “Right 0’ matey.”
Colonel, affronted at being called “Matey,” calls
the bushman to halt (he had started to canter
away). “I want your regiment and number; who
are you ? ” “ It’s all right, boss, I’m the Man from
Snowy River.”
Irish Hospital, Pretoria.—Enteric patient

Just now everybody at Paddington
(Sydney) Barracks is “standing from under.”
Everybody “acted under instructions.” Col.
Roberts “suggested” that the British authorities
should be asked to supply saddles and other things
which could not be got here ; but Gen. French
said the British authorities had enough to do to
supply their own people. Saddles were got from
contractors “on a pattern saddle selected by the
General, and were inspected and passed by
Thompson and or Vaughan.” Thomp-
son, an old dragoon and ex-po’.iceman, has been
on one exploring trip, and may be supposed to
know something about saddles, and his opinion of
Gen. French’s pattern may be judged by the
promptness with which he got rid of the lot as
soon as he reached Capetown in favor of those
from the Army stores which Gen. French said
could not be obtained.
Gen. French, “explaining” about the appoint-
ment of officers of the N.S.W. contingents, said
that “Col. Airey was not a bushman, but he was
an excellent horseman.” It does not seem to
have struck the General that as a
sexagenarian the Colonel was barred,
even if he had been otherwise eligible.
“Capt. Ciaud Robertson was not
a bushman. He belonged to the
marines on one of the wai ships in
the harbour.” Therefore he wasn’t
even a horseman. Gen. French fur-
ther didn’t know if any of the officers
werebushmen. He only “assisted”
in the selection. Even so, one would
have thought he would have been
able to specify their qualifications.
Re Major Owen, who was invalided
to England two months after landing
in Capetown, Gen. French said that
“ great pressure ” with regard to the
appointment was brought to bear
upon him (the General) and, when
asked who wrought the pressure,
answered vaguely: “It occurs to me that the
Colonial Secretary decided that he should go.”
Which would appear to point to Guerilla Minister
See as more or less responsible for what has re-
sulted from the blundering and incompetence of
officers appointed under pressure of the “ Barrack
Push ” and other socially-influential persons.

Sydney’s Hospital for Sick Children is to
be removed from Glebe Point to a beautiful site
overlooking Botany, known as the old Randwick
rifle butts. Besides finding the site, Govt, is to
be asked to help largely with building, &c. North
Sydney also wants a hospital, and demands
£20,000 from Govt. ; £20,000 promised accordingly.
Queer that anything like the private liberality,
which found £17,000 to straighten out Melb.
Hospital affairs seems impossible in Sydney—
though Sydney must contain as many wealthy
people as does the Southern capital.

N.S.W. country hospitals have a standing
quarrel with the Sydney authorities re the treat-
ment of the chronic sick poor. There is no asy-
lum for treatment of these cases outside Sydney,
and so the Parramatta institutions are the goal of
all the province’s aged poor, who sometimes have
to travel long distances to reach them, as the
funds of the local hospitals are too small to permit
them to house a “ long ” case of (say) acute rheu-
matism. At present there are some half-dozen
old men between 72 and 80 years of age at that
most awful p'ace, Tibooburra, who have to be
brought somehow to the metropolis. It will cost
£4O to get them as far as Bourke on the way down,
not to mention the cruelty of inflicting a journey
of over 000 miles on the old fellows. Yet there is
no existing way of treating them otherwise. Liv-
ing is high out-back, and it would take a goodly
sum per week to maintain them locally on bare
necessaries. Wanted badly, that Old Age Pension
Act.

When Cairns (Q.) authorities arranged that
the shipping co.’s should erect bathrooms at each
of their wharves, and supply carbolic acid, etc., so
that each lumper op knocking off should have a
bath and put fresh clothes on before going home —
were these men overjoyed at the care that was to
be taken of them, and through them, of the rest
of the population ? No ! They promptly struck
for overtime, and the shipping co.'s had to allow
them a quarter-hour’s pay for their enforced ablu-
tions. One man, indeed, objected strongly, pay
or no pay, on the ground that washing was too
“ weakenin’.” He got his wages up to date, and
left.
A Melbourne youth ex
citedly rushed into the loca.
hospital one recent Pleasant
Sunday Afternoon, and stated
that he had just swallowed a
shilling-, and was afraid of
sudden death and the loss of
so much personal property.
The casualty-ward attendant
began squeezing various parts
of his anatomy to discover the
location of the bullion, regard-
less of the fact that it is al-
ways unpleasant to be pressed
for money. The patient
wanted a powerful emetic
immediately, but, when as-
sured that even the most
effective drug would hardly
bring up more than tenpence
halfpenny, quickly dropped
that notion and demanded
the X-rays. Finally he was
persuaded there was nodanger
of instant dissolution, and
left, promising to call in the
morning. He wanted to know
if he could be cut open and
the coin extracted, but the at-
tendant had doubts. As he
never returned it is feared that
lie cut himself open in an
amateur fashion with a carv-
ing-knife, and that the experi-
ment failed for some reason
or othei.
The Melbourne Board of
Works scheme of sewerage
has played up terribly with
the average married man with
a family and a fixed screw.
No house in a decent subuib
capable of accommodating a
family of, say, eight can be
rented under 15s. unless the
rail-fare to il4s extortionate.
This arises fropi the destruc-
tion of so many old houses
whose owners had either to
get them sewered or remove
them. Hundreds of mangy
tenements in St. Kilda, Prah-
ran and Malvern districts
have disappeared, hence the
increase in rents and values
of suburban properties.
The recent additions to Sydney G.P.O.
included the erection of another arcade-arch in
George-street. The keystone of what was then
he central arch was set by the recently-deceased
Prince Alfred, on Ist April, ’69. It is no longer

Q. Govt, has a tender regard for the
morals of its aliens. According to last return

bagnios profit by the arrangement. Christian
civilisation disapproves most strongly of poly-
gamy : but, evidently, polyandry is regarded as
comparatively innocuous. It is, indeed, a touch-
ing sight in Queensland to see 30 Polynesians
sally out of the hut in the morning—followed at a
respectful distance by madame —the dutiful and
united bride!

When a deputation from the Queensland
Association for the Prevention of the Spread of
Consumption waited recently upon Home-Secre-
tary Foxton, one member, Dr. Hirschfeld, advo-
cated making expectoration in the streets by any
person an indictable offence, “as this was the
cause, to a large extent, of the spread of influenza,
pneumonia and consumption,” Mr. Foxton re-
marked that the stopping of Australian public
spitting was a decidedly “large order.” Which
is true—inasmuch as it would mean, in probably
19 cases out of 20, the prevention of smoking in
the street. But still it has to be done.

The casualness of the young Australian !
A damsel charged with bigamy in Melb., t’other
day, had been married, when a ward of State, at
the age of 16. Her husband, who made a pre-
carious living helping another man to sell rabbits,
lived with her for a week or ten days and then
left for parts unknown. Subsequently he returned,
took up the contract where lie had left it, for
another three years or so, and then finally quitted.
On the alleged bigamous occasion the bride, it was
alleged, had been drinking with her bridesmaid,
a colored lady, for a fortnight before the cere-
mony. Neither officiating parson—one a Presby-
terian, t’other a Free Christian—made undue
inquiry i ito the circumstances ; or, if they did,,
they Avere not successful in finding out anything
of importance.
RIGHT,
HE: “I hear she made a good match."
SHE: “ Yes. -She married twenty thonsand-a nice old man
with a nasty cough—and it's dead."
A prisoner had a curious experience at
Sessions in aW. A. mining town t’other day. The
jury found him guilty, and Chairman Finnertv
sentenced him to a year’s hard. Thereupon the
man’s solicitor announced that he had been “in-
formed that while the jury were considering their
verdict they had asked if there were any previous
convictions against prisoner, and on the answer
being passed into them it had imperially affected
their verdict.” The Court was instantly in a
commotion, and “it was finally decided that the
previous sentence be cancelled, and that he be re-
sentenced to be imprisoned ‘ till the rising.’ ”
Extract from a letter from India :
Someone has misled Sydney Mail with regard to the
two famine pictures in its issue of May 12. This famine
has not been bad at Tumkur—and those photos were
taken by Barton and Son in 1876-7 when the famine was
raging there. They (Barton and Son) had some corre-
spondence with the Graphic or Illustrated London
News, which printed these same pictures last year.
On a school question :
Dear Bulletin.— Re your article, “Pants and Petti-
coats ” (B. 4/8/’00). Exams, for N.S.W. male and female
public-school teachers are not exactly the same, neither
is the work. In both Ist and 2nd class exams, the mathe-
matical standard for females is much lower than for
males. As regards school attainments, however, the male
teacher has decidedly the best of it—at any rate, in coun-
try schools, where the hapless “ school-marm ” has to do
four hours a week at teaching needlework, and vet, in
the remaining 21 hours, reach the same standard iii other
subjects as the male-teacher does with 25 hours to work
on. Women, as a rule, however (with exceptions), make

Compelled also to stand for hours inhaling a more-or-less
vitiated atmosphere while following a most monotonous
occupation, a woman’s physique suffers much ; fainting
among female-teachers being tolerably common. And, in
any case, comparatively few girls remain in the service
long enough to become proficient as head-teachers. When
it comes to choosing between “brat-whacking” and
matrimony—well, the list of resignations for any given
period makes it pretty evident that the average damsel
would a heap sooner bear children for her own husband
than bear with them for somebody else. —Pants.

George Knight, a trader in Melbourne
Eastern Markets, died recently. Ever since the
boom cracked he had posed to his wife as being
absolutely ruined. After his death, however, no
less than £8162 was found carefully hidden under
the floor of a little back room of his house in Fitz-
roy. This sum, together with £6lO realty, goes to
Mrs. Knight and her daughter, who believed de-
ceased had left behind him only a score of pounds
or so.

As exoehted, the report furnished to
N.S.W. Chief Secretary on that tired institution,
the Metropolitan .Charities Association, recom-
mends the utter wiping-out of the concern. Out
of £llOO raised by the association, of which the
public revenue contributed £1034, some £3O was
expended on relief to the poor, no less than £656
going in salaries alone, while expenses did.
the rest. When investigation of the associa-
tion was threatened some weeks ago, the
manager suddenly announced his intention of
giving up all his emoluments and ranking as an
honorary officer, but this latter-day generosity
was too late. The report states that the associa-
tion has admittedly failed in its determina-
tion to prevent overlapping, as practically no
overlapping exists —certainly not £llOO worth.
When the girls at Melb. Telephone
Exchange kicked against the introduction of
“head-receivers” it was generally understood
that the poor dears were the victims of a
fad. The head gear was foolish, as well
as cruel, said the angry “ Are-you-
there-ers,” and as the result of the
shrill outcry Postmaster-Gen. Duffy
decided to let Telephone sqbscri-
hers go on suffering as before.
The new system had given
satisfaction to a-few thousand
customers of the Postal Dept.,
and dissatisfaction to half-a-
dozen civil servants who
threatened to wait upon Duffy
with tears in their eyes, so
for the sake of peace and quiet-
ness Duffy threw the public
overboard. He had nothing to
fear from a downtrodden public,
anyhow. Watt, who succeeded
Duff v last year, has not dared to
burst up the departmental
fiction re head-receivers. They
are ridiculous things. No
girl at Melb. Exchange
could think of wearing
the hateful gear, unless
she were tired of life. And
yet the girls in Sydney and
every big city on t’other side
of the world have been 'wearing
it for years." Those girls objected
to the novelty, no doubt, on
conservative feminine pri n ci pies,
but they were officially desired
to dry up or resign their billets,
after which they made the best
of their fate and found that the
work came much easier to them
than when they had only one
hand available for switching
purposes.

At latest the unfortunate men who were working for
the Pinnacles Cos., outside Broken Hill, when the Queens-
land Smelting Cos. took possession, were still unpaid.
There is hardly a man on the mine to whom more than
three weeks’ wages are not due ; and wood-cutters and
carters, the people who supplied the stores and those who
carried the ores—all are left lamenting. Meantime the
Smelting Cos. works the mine and trucks away ore. The
men hesitate to sink any more in law expenses ; though a

had made substantial offers for the mine—much more
than enough to wipe off all liabilities—almost persuaf
them to force the co. into liquidation.

The N.S.W. police are busy hunting after

One of the inscrutable designs of an all-

public a chance to enjoy the hearse. The recent
railway accident, which killed three navvies and
injured many more, chanced, as usual, on a Thurs-
day. On the ensuing Sunday a large portion of
Melbourne called on the injured at the Hospital
(the Institution now charges (id. admission to the
casual visitor). Most of the rest went to the
funerals. There were two of them at the General
Cemetery, and the other at Williamstown. People
who were too remote to attend the funerals
walked or drove or hiked out to the scene of the
catastrophe. It was a real good Sunday, and
Melbourne quite enjoyed itself.

The Tied House oppression, which has

entered into after a license
is granted, duplicates
of these as soon as

be the victim

should not
confine its
attention to
the mere
words of the

it gather from
the spirit of the document that
the publican is not the master
of his own house and of its
trade the agreement should
be cancelled and the whole-
sale man who made it be
heavily fined.
The Street-Noises Act, now
being rigorously enforced in Lon-
don, should give a valuable hint
to Australian legislators. Our cities have a full
share of the nuisance, and a lot more than their
share of the kindred abomination of nocturnally
barking dogs and crowing roosters. Here again a
good example is set us by New York, in which
city the police are empowered, upon complaint by
neighlxirs, to destroy any animal or bird that per-
sistently disturbs the night-hours. The grOss-
grained and wooden-witted person may sneer at
the grievance as a sentimental one, but to the
highly-strung and bright-brained these nocturnal
noises are a very real and serious evil ; and, as
every doctor knows, the crisis of a serious illness
is often determined for ill by a crowing cock or
yapping cur. ...

If I cannot overcome it, I must leave the force, as I feel
wretched in my present state.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 21, 1900.
Mr Dear Myee.—
I had a chat with Mrs. Edmund Barton to-day,
and thought you might like to hear a little about,
her impressions, gathered in her hasty but vivid
17 weeks’ visit.
“ Myee,” ending with two “ee’s,” let us start
with the subject of Dress.
“What struck me most,” says brown-eyed,
kindly Mrs. Toby, settling herself and her audi-
ence in two cosy chairs, while the fair-haired only
daughter of the house, yclept Muffy, leans loose
and listens with absorbed eyes—“ What struck
me most about dress in London was that the
tailor-made was simply nowhere. I had a really
nice tailor-gown made as soon as I got there.
But my boy—who has been in England some time
—was m a great hurry to tell me, ‘ Mother, you
can’t wear that .’ He (I mean Edmund) is at Ox-
ford and has acquired an English eye. And,
indeed, he was right. Morning, afternoon, even-
ing everyone seemed dressed up as if for Some-
thing. The tradition of the Englishwoman shop-
ping in homely morning clothes is, a fallacy. In
the morning there are ethereal frills and frou-frou,
and wonderful flowered toques, and loner, extra-
vagant sweeping skirts, as if for garden parties.
London seems to be in a perpetual state of wear-
ing its best clothes. Dress is luxurious, extra-
vagant, ruinous. There seems no end to it, and
to attempt to ‘ keep up ’ with Society women’s
frocking would be absolutely impossible without
untold gold. •
“ For presentation at Court I wore as simple a
gown as possible of pink crepe-de-chine, with pink
satin tram, pink tulle fall, and the indispensable
three feathers. Mrs. Isaacs (of Melbourne) wore
a beautiful gown, and looked very well. And the
presentation was a simpler affair than I had ima-
gined. I mean that everything was made so easy
for us. One couldn’t help knowing exactly what
to do.
“It was waiting in the carriage that really
tried one’s patience. We never got used to that.
One night, at 11 o’clock, we set out for the
Duchess of Devonshire’s ‘At Home.’ We had
had a long day. Lunching out, dining out, and I
was tired, frankly and honestly tired. I hardly
ever got to bed before 2 o’clock in London. Our
carriage stopped after a while, and we waited.
We waited half an hour, then an hour, then an
hour and a half. And then I said to Ted, ‘ Shall
you mind if we go home, lam so very tired.’”
And anyone can imagine how much Toby minded !
And the carriage turned round and left the line.
And that is how the Bartons went to the Duchess
of Devonshire’s “At Home.”
“Among arandes dames I met well, the
Countess of Warwick first. A beautiful woman,
fair, tall, blue-eyed, with an exquisite speaking
voice. She always looks ‘like a picture.’ We
went to Warwick Castle with the Delegates. The
Earl had influenza that day. But Lady Warwick
was a host in herself. In fact, she made the
speech toasting the delegates. One couldn’t help
being struck by her genius for entertaining ; every-
thing at the Castle went off so smoothly. She
came to see me several times in London. She
takes a wonderfully keen interest in everything—
from Federation to almshouses. Then Lady Ran-
dolph Churchill —dark, exquisitely-dressed, and
sparkling, and looking so young. She was near
me at a State concert, and came and spoke. Some-
one wanted to introduce us, but she said, ‘ Oh, I
am still American enough to make myself known
without an introduction.’ Yes, her engagement
to young West was talked of, but I did not know
it was an actual fact. And Lady Ainpthill—Lord
Beauchamp’s sister, younger than. Lady Mary—l
thought her one of the most lovely women in Lon-
don, and so tall—six feet, I believe. , But then all
these English women seemed to me to be tall. It
is the fashion to be tall, and they are tall. I never
saw so many tall women in my life-long, slender
beings, and in manner most simple, cordial, and
unaffected. ”
A person that Mrs. Barton did not meet was the
haw-naw Englishman. Naturally she met great
varieties of the English male kind. But she
looked in vain for this one. He was nowhere. Is it
possible that the brand is utterly extinct? Or
that, like Punch, it “always was.” And if so,
how do we get so much of it in Australia ?
While in London the Bartons lived in a pretty
flat, furnished by a man who had gone to the war.
It was in a building called Whitehall Court,
facing Thames Embankment. There was a
restaurant attached, and they didn’t housekeep.
They were there to breakfast, but that was about
all. A joy to Mrs. Toby’s Nature-loving soul,
when she had time to look at it, was the flower
pquare in front. The tulips came up in blazes.
But lo'! before they had time to die away, and
leave the desolation of dying flowers behind them
one would wake up one fine morning and find the
garden ablaze with pelargoniums—“they think
such a iot of pelargoniums m London,” says she,
with a.note of—er—wonder in her voice—sprung
up as it were by magic, with their flowers ready
made. It was, of course, the art of potting'that
held the.secret of these quick successions of vivid
blossoms.
“And oh ! the flowers at dinfiers—they were so
fine. Table decoration never seemed to me to be
carried to excess. In fact, the simplicity of it
was more apparent than the subtlety. Nights at
the round table were rapidly coming in. At the
Hopetoun’s a party of twenty-four were seated
about two round* tables, with Lady Hopetoun at
one of the two, and the host at the other. Lady
Carrington I saw often. She is as pretty as ever,
but her l.air has gone quite gray. Lord Carring-
ton looks younger. It is hard to believe him
sixty years of age. I saw the two girls who are
out; they are both very “smart.” One of them is
considered very pretty, but not as pretty as the
mother. Kind Lord Jersey, too, and Lady
Jersey, they do take such an interest in Australia
and all Australians.
“In Bohemian circles I met Percy Spence. He
is doing well, but thinks of coming back to Aus-
tralia. He believes that Federation will make
things livelier out here in art-circles. Melba I
met. I gathered that she doesn’t think seriously
of visiting Australia. And when I saw the rows
and rows and rows of carriages outside her operas
I didn’t wonder. She isn’t as stout as I expected
from descriptions of her. I thought her acting
was cold. The woman I loved was Eleanora Duse,
with her grey, rough hair and utterly unmade-up
face. At first she seems'so natural that you think
she’s acting badly, not acting enough, not acting
at all. And you say to yourself that her eyes are
rather small, and her dress isn’t effective in the
very least. And then, all of a sudden, you are
carried quite away. You—you and Duse—just
live through what she is acting from then till the
end.”
Coming away, later, Mrs. Toby and her audi-
ence go in and see Mr. Barton—the latter a
little fearfully, imagining him stretching his brow-
beaten eye over tons of Federal matter. Not a bit
of it. The dining-room door opens, and there he
sits, alongside the family table, covered with a
brown art-serge—the table, not Toby—smoking a
big cigar, and letting the ashes fall dreamily on
an evening paper. Or perhaps I ought to say
reading that evening paper. With his calm,
leisured, single-minded, unhurried, unfederated
face, he appears to be bearing up well under being
hero of the hour.
Turning to things theatrical in our own land,
the whole of our Comic Opera Co. has been busy
writing its name (or malting its cross) at the end
of new agreements all this week. So that Mus-
grove won’t snavel anyone from this galaxy of
stars—Williamson has made every one sign a year’s
engagement, from the principals down to girls
whose “carriage waits.”
By the way, I consider it a very lucky accident
that took me, unintendingly as it were, to the
“ Rose of Persia ” last Wednesday. I found Dolly
Vane’s part being played by Miss Fyvie Dench,
an Adelaide girl, thin, eager—a little too eager—
who certainly looks more the part than Dolly,
although I can hardly pretend that she is the
raison d’etre of my use of the word lucky. No.
It was the understudy of Miss Winston-Weir who
provoked that five-legged epithet. Miss Ruby
Bowring made a sweet-looking Rose, with a most
delightful voice—fresh, flexible, and sympathetic
—a mezzo-soprano that can take C. The new
Rose—who is in the chorus, by the way—played
on very simple lines; no dancing and little panto-
mime, but she scored. She has charm and appeal;
and amateur eyes and ankles go for nothing in the
face of charm and appeal. Hers is about the best
of all the many new voices we have heard, or
heard about, lately.
Miss Burdekin’s marriage with Mr. Alec. Hay
is to be one of Race Week’s attractions. It comes
off on Race Wednesday. I hear that the brides-
maids—two Hay sisters, little Miss Burdekin, and
three others—will wear white tucked crepe-de-
chine frocks and big black hats, but don’t blame
me if they wear something else.
Tongues are wagging busily over the Advertise-
ment Ball. Society likes the idea. Business
houses are being busily canvassed for ads., and
out of the sum paid, the fair wearer pays for her
frock—representative of the firm she advertises—
and hands over the remainder to the Children’s
Hospital Fund. By the way, a charming widow
says she would go as “A Brandy Bottle”—a
brown cardboard frock—only that men would put
their arms round her neck. A pretty actress was
the last to give a big masked ball here. It was
there that a certain Mr. Samuel Snooks, of Sydney,
got a mask, and followed his wife without telling
her he was coming. He was disappointed to find
Mrs. Snooks sitting quietly along the wall the
whole evening. , .
Out of sheer masculine disappointment he found
out his tnother-in-law, put on a French accent,
and made himself fascinating. He gave his name
—Monsieur Diderot, Ist Officer on the Culac.
Would Madame lunch with him to-morrow on his
boat. His mother-in-law fluttered; she gave, oh,
such a delightful consent. Later on she told her
daughter all about her conquest ; the. daughter
told Snooks next morning. Then Snooks con-
fessed.. But masked balls are never mentioned in
that family circle now.
At the Alpress Benefit, Town Hall, last week,
one was glad to see a comfortably-moneyed house
for the sake of -the thin, long-haired fiddler so
distinguished by his fiddle, and Phil May.
Alpress is thinner and longer-haired than of yore.
He has had bad health lately, and goes to England
shortly. He sported a bad cold, but fiddled beau-
tifully through part of a Beethoven Concerto, and
fired off Joachim’s cadenza as if four hands were
at it instead of one and a bow. Although we don’t
hear him often, nowadays, he hasn’t lost his
cunning.
In an interval, John See presented the familiar
figure with a gold watch —token of esteem from
pupils. I mention this chiefly for the sake of say-
ing that Mr. Riccardi returned thanks on behalf of
Rivers, who could not speak through cold. The
musician alongside the politician scored heavily.
Although the political man punctuated his speech
with bobs, and the singer merely drew breath, the
poverty of the former, as a speaker, was brought
into evidence by t’other, who—to misquote Donald
Macdonaldis much-talked-of ad.—“ talks better
than he sings.” The ad. meant that for a compli-
ment. So do I.
I think everybody was on the programme. Miss
Jessie King was in pink, with a fine carriage of
her head that won her a treble recall for “A Sum-
mer Night,” which somebody says is the best love-
song ever written. I don’t agree to that, but I
think Miss King knows how to sing it. Miss
Nellie Cooke was gowned elaborately in pink
satin with a lace overdress and elbow sleeves.
She sang her Bellini bravely, and came back and
gave a ballad that didn’t suit hei® high flexible
voice as well. Mr. Woodhouse, the Liedertafel,
and a fine orchestra, Laurence Campbell, Signor
d’Alba and Miss Mylott also swelled the attrac-
tions of the benefit night.
Gov. Gormanston has taken his departure from
Tasmania after a seven years’ rule. He sold by
auction his horses, carriages, and so forth.
Everybody expected that Acting-Gov. “ Johnny”
Dodds would have bought the big yellow
chariot—of which he had the use while His
Ex. was on leave in England—but it was knocked
down to a common cabman for £BO, and is now on
the rank opposite Hobart Public Library. You
can now ride in Gov. Gormanston’s carriage at
3s. an hour. Old Vic. Judge Molesworth’s carriage
can be hired in Hobart on the same terms.
Deputy-Gov. Dodds wanted to hire the yellow
trap by the week during his second term of office,
but cabby wasn’t satisfied ivith the amount of the
weekly stipend* and refused to let the kerridge—
which looks as gaudy as if it were made in Ger-
many. But it wasn’t. It was made in Dublin.
The ex-Gov. is going to spend the first few
months of his freedom from office in North Italy.
He will get a pension of £2OOO a year for 15 years
in the Colonial service. Private Secretary
"Rawlinson goes straight to Rome when he touches
Europe, and will spend the winter with his mother
in the city of the Pope. The last time he was
there Leo XIII, made him a Knight, for civility
to the R.C. Bishops at Govt. House, Hobart,
when Archbishop Murphy celebrated his episcopal
golden jubilee. Mr. Rawlinson is a ’vert to Rome
and went to Cardinal Newman’s school at
Birmingham. The regal-looking Lady Gorman-
ston is also a ’vert.
There is much. indignation in Hobart among
the ladies who subscribed for - a present to
the departing Lady Gormanston. Wishing to
consult her. taste in the matter, they wrote asking
what she would like for. a souvenir of Tasmania,
and received the reply that Lady G. would prefer
to have the money to spend, on a souvenir. A
cheque for the amount —about £70 —was accord-
ingly sent, but the kindly feeling that usually
accompanies a parting gift was noticeably absent
on this occasion. , ,
There’s a good deal of condensed pathos some-
where about the remarkable suicide of the doctor’s
widow, who recently flung herself over a 100 ft.
cliff, at Coogee, Sydney. The person who was
with her had just remarked upon the apparent
loneliness of a sea-bird , flying below, and was
simply petrified when the lady —who had not
theretofore manifested any suicidal tendencies—
exclaimed, “Yes, it does look lonely—and so do
I! ’’—flung her parasol Over the cliffs —and threw
herself after it! A recent serious brain-illness,
following the decease of the lady’s husband, had
probably something to do with the awful act.
_ I would like to draw your attention to an adver-
tisement in another part of this paper that may
prove invaluable to country people. Mrs. Baldry,
of 205 Glenmore-road, proposes to undertake
shopping commissions, engage rooms, and do
various services for way-back women that friends
in town are only too glad to shirk. I need not
add that high references go along with the above.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“At the Police Carnival for the Children’s
Hospital (Aug. 18), serried female masses glared
inquisitively at the actresses tending the tea-
tables. Mrs. Brough worked grandly, and looked .
well in riding-habitlike gown of black cloth, with
novel laced-in gusset let into the bodice-tail, and
green-straw hat stabbed by a black quill. Carry-,
mg cups through ' the orush, _ she reiterated,
‘ Ladies, please stand aside! ’ in tragic tones,
reminiscent of her ‘ Lord Quex ’ question, ‘ Girls !
did you never sleep in a strange bed ? ’ While she
toiled for charity’s sake, she must have reflected
on the fickleness of women who, forgetting to
revel in the honor of elbowing their former
favorite, Mr s - Brough, constantly button-holed
her to ask ‘ Where’s Miss O’Neil ? Where’s the
head-waitress ? ’
“ Rumor had it that Miss O’Neil was too
nervous to face Saturday gloaters. All the after-
noon, however, traffic was congested near a lilac-
hatted, auburn - haired counter nymph, whose
aspect gave rise to endless ‘ Nance’ or ‘ no Nance’
discussion. Off the boards, the tragedienne keeps
very dark, which explains popular unfamiliarity
with her appearance. Some people suspect that
the supposedly divinely-tall Nance ‘calklates’
that down street, minus stage devices, she would
show up as rather long-waisted and short-legged.
Anyway, even at the races t’other week she lurked
in her carriage, with nothing of herself on view
but her pallid chin peeping from under the brim
of a floppy black hat.
“In Saturday’s actress-show, Grace Noble,
with her big brown eyes and glossy hair to match,
was a prize exhibit. Her natty fawn Eton suit
had cream brocade revers, and soft shades of blue
and mauve mingled on her fawn hat. Mr. Brough
was a resplendent item with red in his tie, and
button-hole of blue hyacinths. Brother Percy,
with scarlet carnation posy, wore his usual air of
figuratively licking his lips over a just-consumed
jam tart.
“ In the Bijou tea-room, ‘ dainty Irene Frank-
lin,’ with touzled vermillion hair, flaming pink
blouse and lashins of visible ankle, looked ‘ a little
bit of orl-right.’ Her face seemed 10 years older
than her skirts, but one liked the misnamed
‘Dainty’ for the tolerant, humorous glance she
flung at gapers, who, instead of letting her see the
color of their tea money, stood at the door audibly
criticising the Franklin as ‘ a Yankee terror,’ ‘an
old-fashioned child,’ etc.
“ Among the visitors were Mrs. George Chirn-
side, all in black, except for her sack rain-coat,
and Janet Lady Clarke, who relieved her sartorial
gloom by a bonnet-spray of white blossom.
“The ministering stage angels included Roxy
Barton, attractive in her mauve hat, though too
thin for a theatrical victrix. Miss Thynne (Mrs.
Plimmer) was decorative in pale-biue blouse,
while in the Theatre-Royal tea-room, Eugenie
Duggan affected black and white and looked as
she does when, the villain having done his worst,
she heralds her coming swoon with the Runio
o?OQn, ‘No-o a hoosband, no-o ho-me, no-o
chee-ild, no-o na-a-me, alo-one, alo-one, alo-one ! ’
“ Nance O’Neil wears in ‘ Tess of the D’Urber-
villes’ the same white dress that she wore in
‘ Hedda G-abler.’ This shows a nice sense of the
fitness of things; the fitness of the dress being
understood. Tess and Hedda are cousins in
fiction ; the wearing of the same dress emphasises
\heir relationship in art. The frock is ‘ a simple
thing in white,’ largely flounced at the hem, and
with trailing white scarves from the shoulders.
She suicides in it as Hedda, and in ‘Tess’ is
taken prisoner for murder.
“The £3 14s. Id. benefit in Sydney reminds me
of how they do things in the South Melbourne
district when Mr. Henry Skinner interests himself
in the cause. The name of the ‘ well-known
caterer ’ on the bill is seemingly a guarantee of
* Alrightness,’ as they would say down Sowth.
Only the other week Mr. Skmner acted as
treasurer to a benefit fund for one Ed. M. Crindle,
and after the public had been most liberally
catered for at a concert in the S.M. Town Hall,
the balance sheet came out this wayt

“ A just-announced engagement is that of Mr.
Frank Clarke, youngest son of the Cliveden dow-
ager, to his second cousin, Miss Nina Cotton,
whose father manages a bank at Daylesford’s
mineral rill. The bride-elect, with no fortune but
her face, was regarded as a coming ‘ beauty ’ a
while ago, when her flaxen-floss hair was hanging
down her back, and, as such, she was included in
a pictorial series of ‘ Australian belles.’ Nowa-
days she is a dainty pocket-charmer with delicate
features and a skin like porcelain—a pearl of a
girl rather than a dazzling diamond.
“ The Softgoods ball took chill at the first sight
of rather an empty Town-hall last Tuesday, and
even when the Madden and ‘ Cliveden ’ parties
came to hand the numbing impression was not
removed. The dowager, in the scaly armour of her
black and silver toilette, contrived to outshine the
few dazzling gowners from drapery show-rooms.
In the dancing crowd no figure revolved more
animatedly on its axis than that of the ever-red
Mr. Butters, whose uncertain age—it must now be
70 odd—seems to make no difference to his
waltzing.
“ The rehabilitation of Mat. Davies is complete,
and last week’s Softgoods Ball at Melb. Town
Hall found him honored with a place in the Vice-
Regal set. It is a foregone conclusion that Mat.
will stand for Parliament again at the forthcoming
Vic. elections. Other certain starters are Jimmy
Munro, Tommy Bent, and Jimmy Mirams.
“Dr. Oculist Jackson’s dashing daughter
managed a team of four up-to-date Johnnies in
the driving competition, at the Rink Carnival, on
Tuesday night, and the fair whip presented a re-
freshing appearance in trim white frock and sailor
hat. By the way, Miss Blanche Watson, of the
hunting-field, is one of the most graceful gliders to
be seen on castors, and perhaps Miss Bartrop
scores next, with rather a picturesque type of face
and lithe form.
“ Miss Cotton —the Daylesford belle—whose en-
gagement to Francis Clarke has just been
announced, is cast for a character at the Poster
Ball.
“ Among the Posters mooted for the ball, that
of a popular corset promises to score conspicu-
ously. It is being made in a dainty fashion of
satin and lace, and designed to be worn over the
tricky frock by a smart E. Melb. girl. One of the
bulkiest of the originators will beam forth in a
Court-costume of a certain oats ad. Quite a big
sum has already been realised by the contribu-
tions of the advertising firms.
““Press critics, writing of ‘Tess,’ hinted darkly
at its ‘ horridness.’ In consequence, many people
are dragging themselves to Her Majesty’s just to
allay their misgivings. T’other night scribe saw
an elderly flutterer arrive at the d.c. door, where
she was met by a party of friends. Here she
baulked, and mysteriously . beckoned all the
women of the group into.the cloak-room to break
to them the news that she felt shy about going in.
‘The book’s so dreadful, you know!” she reiter-
ated nervously. At last she was coaxed into the
Chamber of Horrors, but not till a red-faced man
who had seen the play had testified regretfully,
‘ No fear, you won’t see Tess get hung ! ’

The plague lias had its advantages for some
people, though not for most. The Sydney Safe Deposit,
for instance, has had a great accession of business during
the last few months, consequent on persons having de-
cided to prepare for the worst by placing their papers,
&«., in safety. The fear is that when a house is quaran-
tined valuables may go astray. It is well to be on the
safe side, and the Safe Deposit affords perfect protection
against either fire or burglars. It is well worth a visit,
anyway. The Deposit is situated in Ash-street, near to
Paling and Co’s. *

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Up to time of writing, General Billy Gover-
nor and his foroes have displayed great mobility,
and evidently know when to come in out of de
Wet.
Dr. Cecil Wilson, Bishop of Melanesia,
now in Sydney, distinguished himself a few years
ago by demanding “ a close season ” for South Sea
niggers.
Louis Samuel Cohen, to be Lord Mayor of
Liverpool (Eng.) a second time, is a native of
Sydney and son of old Sam Cohen, one-time mem-
ber for Morpeth.
George Fisher lately boasted, in M.L. Par-
liament, that he had seen and survived 41 editors
of Wellington papers, every one of whom had
been opposed to him.
Preliminaries for a long-delayed theatrical
divorce have been taken up South, somebody’s
‘really’ husband having grown weary of officiating
merely nominally in that capacity.
Two startling facial resemblances—(l)
JLiord Roberts and Signor Steffani, of Sydney ; (2)
Lord Wolseley and Sydney artist Julian Ashton.
All great men, too ! in their different lines —
especially as organisers.
The Henry Parkes Bursary idea, which,
on the old man’s death, was taken up with such
loud-mouthed clamor by a host of self-advertisers,
political and other, materialises to a frail little
three-guineas-worth of books a year !
No one prominently identified with the
framing of N.S.W. Constitution in the middle
’so’s is now alive. Andrew Clarke is the sole sur-
vivor of the framers of the Vic. Constitution.
Queensland points to several such curios.
Obit., aged 82 years, William Moore, born
at Old Govt. House, Sydney, where his father was
steward to Gov. Macquarie. Mr. Moore has been
living in retirement at Ashfield for many years,
having lost his eyesight lialf-a-century ago.
Expected that Mr. Justice Bundey, the
most popular and respected S.A. Judge, will
shortly retire owing to chronic ill-health. Mr.
Bundey has been on the bench for 16 years. In
his day he was a sterling cricketer and enthusias-
tic yachtsman.
Old Canon Handheld, for almost 50 years
incumbent of St. Peter’s, Eastern-hill, Melbourne,
who died the other day, was a great admirer of
Tennyson ; it was said that in the course of his
several thousand sermons he had quoted every line
of “In Memoriatn.”

Capb. Loder, an aged resident of Single-
ton, N.S.W., has in his possession the diary of ex-
plorer Howe, who in 1818, trekked across the

Valley. Some leaves are missing from the book,
but enough remains to form a thrilling narrative of
the intrepid party’s experiences.
Mr. Barr Smith, who lias just given £lO,OOO
to help finish Adelaide Anglican Cathedral, is a
brother-in-law of the late Thomas Elder who,
during life or by will, distributed over £250,000
among local institutions. Barr Smith privately is
the most liberal of givers, and he has made several
pretty big public donations also.
Ex-Premier Kingston says that Dr. Cock-
burn is so much in love with London that when
his term as S.A. Agent-General expires he will
most likely begin to practice as a consulting
physician there. The Doctor is highly qualified,
being M.D. of London University. But he is a
man who often changes his plans.
Colonel Bell, the retiring U.S. Consul, is
the only citizen of a foreign country whom any
Govt, of Australia has employed to officially repre-
sent it abroad at an exhibition or other national
congress. Reid, when Premier, commissioned
Col. Bell to represent N.S.W. at the late Com-
mercial Congress in Philadelphia. Had Bell not
been the generally-favored person he is the
Opposition would have resisted the appointment.
Among all the talk about who should and
should not be remembered in connection with the
Federation of Australia the name of A dye Doug-
las, of Tasmania, gets no place. Vet Douglas,
now in his 86th year, has been a 40-years believer
in and worker for the Federal idea. He hailed
with enthusiasm Parkes’s first suggestions in that
direction, and has been member of almost every
conference dealing directly or indirectly with the
subject.
Archdeacon White, to be consecrated
Bishop of Carpentaria at St. Andrew’s, Sydney,
on August 24, had an eye on his preferment for
many years. While stationed in N.Q. over a
dozen years ago he frequently adverted to the
necessity for erecting a see in the North, and
practically designated himself for the pilot. He
is an Africander by birth. The name Carpentaria
was conferred on that region by Dr. Lang, the
cleric-patriot of Sydney.
Perambulating Adelaide streets on the day
of Kingston and Barton’s arrival was Samuel
Davenport, who, in 1846, was one of the first four
nominee members of S.A. Leg. Council, 10 years
before that province had a constitution. Later,
he was Works Commissioner in the first Ministry
formed under responsible Government. Daven-
port, now 82 years old, is in fairly robust health,
and to see the Commonwealth Parliament in
session is the one remaining ambition of his life.
N. S, W. Commandant French lately
offered directly 2000 men to the British
Govt. Of course it was through a brother
Imperial officer that the offer was made, but
“it got there just the same.” The Command-
ant in the Soudan days behaved differently. The
idea of sending troops struck General Strickland,
but he mooted it first to Acting-Premier Dalle) ,
who promptly took the idea and got all the loyal
glory in its train. That old General often after-
wards regretted (for he too loved Jingo glory) that
he had not done like French in these latter days.
Attorney-Gen. B. R. Wise’s name has been
mentioned in connection with the N.S.W. Chief-
Justiceship—in the event of Chief-Justice Darley’s
translation to the State Governorship. Mr. Wise
would certainly, as A.-G., have the first refusal.
But, when all is over, the new C.J. will prob-
ably be Mr. Pilcher. That Q.C. has, it is true,
more than once refused a Puisne Judgeship ; his
Bar-income having been so good that he could
make more money by practising in Sydney and
yet living half the year in England than a seat on
the Bench would give him. But the Chief-Justice-
ship, it is thought, might tempt him.
Mainly about “ Honest Tom ” Playford, a
S.A. politician :
Ex-Agent-General Playford, who is expected to table a
no-contidence motion against his old colleague, Holder,
ere present session is over, is now practically leader of
S.A. Opposition. He has been in S.A. Assembly, off-
and-on, for 32 years, and as far back as 76 was
Lands Commissioner in Boucaut’s Ministry. He has
twice been Premier. Tom Playford is a hard-shell Tory,
although association with Kingston, ever his sworn per-
sonal friend, kept him for years ostensibly a Democrat.
Privately he runs a market-garden business, and, like a
modern Cincinnatus, drove his cart to market many
years after embarking in politics. One blot on Playford’s
career was his earnest advocacy, in the eighties, of coolie
labor for the Northern Territory, and danger of a piebald
population in the Territory was only averted by his defeat
by Holder in ’B2. Honest Tom is still strong, mentally
and physically, although 63 years old.
A bronze tablet in the corridor
of Melb. Age office commemorates
the death of war-correspondent W.
J. Lambie. This is the only record
of the kind at present in an Aus-
tralasian newspaper office, but the
thing will become common enough if
the country is to participate in all
the wars of Great Britain.
The late Duke of Saxe-Coburg
was not particular in his methods of
acquiring anything which took his
fancy. When in Auckland, M.L., he
learnt that .Judge Fenton, of the
Native Land Court, a musical dil-
letante, owned a very valuable ’cello,
and being himself an amateur in
music—remarkable mainly for not
being able to tune hisown fiddle—
he expressed a desire to see the in-
strument. It was sent for his inspec-
tion, and that was the last the owner
saw of it. Repeated written appli-
cations for its return were ignored.
Carrington in the Lords on the
second reading of the Commonwealth
Bill gave it as a fact that “the crisis
over clause 74 w;is so great, so anxious,
that the health of one of the delegates,
Mr. Deakin, broke down absolutely,
and he had to return to Australia.”
Deakin’s health did collapse, but
that was rather due to biliousness
than anxiety. The banquets upset
him. It takes solid, capacious men,
with bonded-store bingies, like Bar-
ton and Kingston, to go through a course of
London.
Sydney U.S Consul, Colonel Bell—the
man of “ words, words, words ” —has been, more
American)!, suddenly and without notice super-
seded in his office by the Republican Orlando H.
Baker—by whom, and not the Yankee foreign
office, the first intimation of the change was con-
veyed to Gol. Bell. But for “influential Aus-
tralian representations” a change would have been
made upon M’Kinley’s accession to the Presi-
dency. Now, however, the mellifluous “Kernel”
(whose public utterances, by-the-way, might all
along have been those of a representative of J.
Bull, and not of “ God’sown country ”) has appar-
ently reached the end of his Democratic tether,
and Sydney loses a lot of very handsome official
talkee-talkee.

The recently dead Lord Russell, of Kil-
lowen, Chief Justice of England, had crowded a
lot of living into his 67 years. In turn pressman,
solicitor, barrister, M.P., Cabinet-Minister, and
Chief Justice of England—he brought to every-
thing the same commanding ability, backed by
apparently limitless working power. He made
£25,000 a year at the bar, had a devil of a temper,
will be best remembered by bis masterly defence
of Parnell in the Times case, and may be best
summed up by his own declaration that, high
above imagination, humor, subtlety, or eloquence,
be valued “clear-headed common-sense.” Pers-
picacity was the man’s keynote.
Shiels’s orations always smell of the lamp
—the gas-lamp. It is one of Shiels’s pet affecta-
tions that he never prepares his speeches. Once
during bis Budget speech he implored members
not to interrupt him, as he had so many figures
to carry in his head, when all the time he had
large sheets of fcap. notes in front of him. Most
of his smart sayings are worked up days before-
hand. On one occasion, when challenged on a
point, he said he was totally unprepared with his
answer, but would do his best—and forthwith
drew out of a portfolio a pile of notes, stuffed
with English and foreign quotations, which gave
him matter for an harangue three hours long.
English pension-list for the new financial
year contains this item: “Anne Maria Lady
Barklv, in recognition of the public services of her
husband, Sir Henry Barkly, K.C.M.G., K.C.8.,
as Governor of five British colonies in succession :
£75.” Less than 30s. a week for a Governor’s
bard-up widow ! The same list gives £IOO a year
to the widow of Hamilton Macallum, a painter of
no particular merit ; and £IOO a year to Sims
Reeves, the old tenor, who has made tens of thou-
sands in his time, and never saved a penny.
Many a generous private employer will give an
old servant’s widow more than £1 Bs. lOd. per
week, which is all the wealthy British Govern-
ment can spare for a Governor’s relict!
The death of the Duke of Edinburgh
recalls the painful fact that, after his fortunate
escape in Sydney, some Maoriland enthusiasts
added this dreadful verse to the National Anthem
—a composition already in bad enough health—
and it was publicly sung by a huge assemblage at
Christchurch :
God save thy naval son
On whom foul wrong was done ;
God shield his head.
O, Lord, defend his life
From traitor’s ball or knife,
Or in our country’s strife
God save M-fred:
One’s enduring impression of Treasurer
Sliiels (Vic.) delivering his four-and-a-half-hours’
budget speech is that of a tall, thin, cornet-voiced
man, with a long head partly bald and partly close-
cropped to the point of baldness, evidently vain
of his position, droning away wearily, hour after
hour, to a half-empty chamber. Every now and
then there was a striving to be rhetorical, only the
would-be orator had no eagle’s pinions, but only a
flying-machine to bear him aloft, and every time
he fell flat to earth. He tried anecdotes ; they
were mildewed with age. He flung in Latin
quotations ; they were laughed at as pedantry.
His facts were confused, and his comments irrele-
vant. Everybody thought of plain George
Turner’s six plain, clear, sober, terse, brief, vigor-
ously - expounded budgets, effortless, compre-
hensible, and admirably free from decoration.
When Sliiels sipped his last drop of whisky-and-
waterand flopped through his flatulent peroration
people just sighed for the hundredth time, and
went home bored.
The first two politicians who shook hands
with Delegate Kingston,
on his arrival at Largs

time deadly
enemies.

ly oym-

Adel aide
people, with
the memory
of their bitter
feud still fresh,
were almost
startled. Later,
at the reception
i n Adelaide,
Symon had a
tremendous re-
ception, but
when King-
ston referred
to his old an-
tagonist’s
help, thecheer-
ing was greater
still. Even King-
ston, looking, like Bar-
ton, as brown as a berry
and in fine health, was almost flabbergasted
when Baker, who is still suspected of having tried
to undermine the Bill, made a flattering speech
Melbourne Argus, in discussing the
subjects of original pictures and replicas by
the artists in connection with works in Vic.
National Gallery, says : “No mention is made in
the catalogue of the duplicate existence, well-
known to experts, of Watts’ portrait of Tenny-
son.” This is quite a mistake. The Watts por-
trait of Tennyson in Melb. Gallery is the original.
It was painted in ’56. Watts painted four other
portraits of Tennyson, but at different periods of
his life (see Biography 11., 431). Present writer
has seen all these pictures except one. But Watts
did no replica of the Melb. portrait, and when
Gov. Tennyson paid his first visit to Melb. last
year, he went to the Gallery to see the portrait,
of which there is no (authentic) copy in England.
A certain clever lawyer at long inter-
vals goes a little “ off his onion ” for a week
or two, and always, when in that state, takes
divorce-proceedings against his devoted and much-
loved wife, citing some friend of his as co-respon-
dent. These letters passed between A and his
best friend (also a lawyer) some time ago :—-
My dear B. —I’m sorry to have to cite you as co-respon-
dent in this case, but I must do so. Yours affection-
ately, A.
Dear A. —I submit, and under the circumstances wish
to retain the best legal adviser possible. 1 send you
retaining fee. Yours, &c., B.
After three days A replies :
Dear B.—Having thought seriously over the matter, I
accept, sacrificing private feelings to public justice.
Yours, A.
The case did not come on.
Will someone be so kind as at once to
procure a knighthood for Mr. Charles Davies of
Hobart Mercury (who, on his recent trip to
England, had the honor of shaking hands with the
P. of W.)? That Mr. Davies should be knighted
is absolutely necessary in order that his unhappy
local public, which is compelled to read the
Mercury aforesaid, may be protected from slush
like this, now constantly appearing in that dull
and greaseful paper’s columns:—
Will someone suggest a way in which we (Britons) might
put on record and perpetuate The Mercury’s splendid
loyalty and steadfastness (during a trying period) and our
appreciation of same? Trusting some leading loyalists
will move in the matter, and apologising for intruding on
your valuable space.—Yours, etc.
“ Will somebody suggest ? ” Of course. Let Mr.
Charles Davies be a Knight, allesaine Eairfax-

Ben Hall, the last man outlawed in
N.S.W. until now the (aboriginal) Governors
enter the list, was treated to a death in accord-
ance with the terms of the law of outlawry. He
was literally riddled with bullets when it was
quite possible for him to have been captured alive.
Hall had made up his mind to quit bushranging.
He parted with his mates and went to an old
friend to raise some money deposited with him for
safekeeping. The “friend” pretended to goto
the Forbes bank for the money, but went to the
police-station instead, and in the night a sub-
inspector and posse of police surrounded the
“ friend’s ” humpy. In the morning Hall unsus-
pectingly walked out of the front door, and was
instantly shot down. £IOOO reward was offered
for him, £SOO of which was divided among the
police, and the other £SOO given to the “friend.”
The “friend” also, it was said, stuck to Hall’s
deposit.
Writes “Lex Scripta” :
Ed. B.—You print (8., 11 8/’00) that “ the late Justice
Faucett is the only N.S.W. Judge who was never over-
ruled by the Privy Council.” Which is not correct, for that
able legal luminary was distinctly over-ruled bv the P.O.
in the-well-known case of Barton v. Muir (11 S.O. R. Eq.
90 and on Appeal L.R. 6 P.O. 134). This case was one in
which Muir, an overseer, purchased for Barton, his mas-
ter (a squatter), with the moneys of the latter a free selec-
tion under an agreement that he, Muir, would comply
with all the conditions of N.S.W. Land Act of'6l, and,
these being performed, would transfer the land to Barton.
After the performance of these conditions, Muir refused
to transfer on the ground that the agreement was illegal,
as being contrary to the spirit of the Act. The Primary
Judge in Equity, Hargrave, upheld the squatter’s conten-
tion and decreed specitic performance of the agreement,
but on the overseer appealing to the Full Court—consist-
ing of Stephen, C.J., Hargrave, and Faucett—that body
reversed this decree, Hargrave dissenting and holding to
his former opinion. The squatter then appealed to the
Privy Council, and that body held that the case was
rightly decided by Hargrave, and over-ruled Stephen,
C.J., and Faucett. —Lbx Scripta.

Mr. Mulryan was an epicurean cocky.
His Su: day dinner was roast chicken, killed over-
night, and hung in a mosquito-net safe under a
tree at the back of the house. Mul. was deaf.
Goo Hi was also an epicure. His method of pro-
curing a Sunday chicken was to commandeer
Mul.’s. To prevent this, Mul. bought a fierce
half-bull half-cattle dog, and tied him under the
tree to watch the prospective meal. Still the
chicken kept disappearing. Mul. was mystified,
but Goo Hi explained to some admiring friends :
“ Mul-lyan, him darn fool. Tie em bu’ dog under
tlee to watch’em fowl. Me look'at dog; dog
look at me. Me walk’em loun’ tlee, bu’ dog him
walk’em loun’ after. Bimeby, bu’ dog all tie-up
close a tlee. Then me take ’em fowl, an’ walk
loun’ oder way ; bu’ dog him walk loun’ oderway,
too, an’ bime-by him loose. Mul-lyan bime-by
say, ‘Bu’dog no dam good’ ; then hang’em an’
get’em noder dog. Allee same me ! ”

There aren’t many aborigines out in far-
west N.S.W. now; but those there are have
probably suffered as much through the drought
as the most afflicted squatter. A couple of
months ago a lubra, with two little children,
was dying in a Darling camp. The drought
had either killed or driven off the wild game,
and the river was too low for fish; so abso-
lute starvation kept the poor lubra company in the
camp. After a fruitless search for food, the
lubra’s “ old man ” sent his camp-mate off to seek ;
and he could find nothing but a sheep, which he
caught, and the famished camp ate it. The two
male blacks were arrested, and, after being kept
in gaol two months (the lubra died during this
time) were carted off to Broken Hill for trial.
When Judge Gibson got out these facts, and was
assured that the prisoners were “good blacks,” he
passed his best sentence to date—“ till the rising.”
And the Court rose.

and sped to the Warrumbungle mountains, the
same farce was enacted as is now in progress. The
Eolice were such a nuisance in the Calga men’s
ut that the cook complained, and they had ta
earn their service money by cooking in another
hut. And they had often to be reminded
that the bushrangers would not come down and
give themselves up. I’d like a free-pass and use
of a really good horse and a free leg to try single-
handed to find out the whereabouts of these men.
Tt is useless, anyhow, to go in pairs or mobs after
these Breelong blacks. A swag or a petticoat
might get near them, but tweed clothes or boots-
and-breeches never—except by chance.

Be the chase after the Breelong blacks.
It is narrated that a responsible “ mimber of the
foorce, ” coming to a river, was informed that the
blacks had been traced thereto, the tracks being
clearly visible on the opposite bank. Whereupon,
according to the yam, the “active and intelligent”
went back 15 miles to his last camp, remained the
night, and pushed forward next morning. Such
zeal as this would account for a good many things.

A country N.S.W. paper, in referring to
the Breelong fugitives, calls them devils six times
in one par; also “damnable brutes” and “in-
human destroyers.” The writer further observes
that his finger never left the trigger of his rifle
while travelling, and that men are swearing “ by
the great God of Heaven” to avenge the murders.

There is a big revival of blackfellow lingo
in the A ustralian Parliaments. Native names,
spurious or real, are in great demand for the
Federal constituencies. In Yic. Parliament the
debates have been sable with patois noir. The
funniest incident was when Tory Graves got the
name of the Goulburn Valley constituency altered
to “Moira,” which he assured the House meant
Murray Flats, and was a name given to the
district in the Alcheringa days of settlement.
J. G. Duffy said nothing—for the fun of the thing
—until the name was solemnly changed; and
then he turned on the historical tap and showed
that the name Moira wasn’t native at all, but was
given to the district after Moira, an Indian
General famous in his time. There was grave
debate as to whether Korangamite should be spelt
with aC.or a K. John Murray declared that the
blacks spelt it with a K before the white man
came 1

“Scotty the VVrinkler ” re the Myall
Creek massacre (8., 11/8/’OO) :
I was overseer on the station 35 or 36 years after the
slaughter. One part of the yard in which the blacks were
“executed” was shown me, and the head-stockman, W.
Wemyss, said it had been unsafe to go to the creek for a
bucket of water, and that last of all they were run in and
shot. At the trial, when the seven were acquitted, a
squatter interested in the matter said to Attorney-General
Plunkett : “ We’ll have none of your Irish laws here.”
“ No,” said P., “ but I’ll show you English law.” And he
had them re-indicted for the murdering of one picaninny,
with the result of conviction and execution. One of the
station-hands was still on the creek, a dummy. My
orders were to give him a bottle of rum on his birthday,
so he had a birthday—ranging promiscuously from 75 to
82 —about once a fortnight. He was away with two mules
to Murrurundi for four kegs of rum when the massacre
took place. “ Yes, sir ;or I’d a bin in it. Rum saved
my life.” This run is also celebrated as being “ selected”
minerally and otherwise by Wm. Shakespeare, Richd.
Turpin, John Shepherd, Wat Tyler, &c. Also as the
station where they drafted the hostile and friendly voters
at election times—one pen being allowed to go to Wari-
alda, the other to their work. Mr. J. B. Dulhunty, of
Bathurst, was manager when I was there. He ought to
know the Breelong murder-country. His father had that
land, or some near it, as a run.

A recent letter from New Guinea to a

having just massacred another, and having a fine

the field tne writer was on had been, it was sup-

“ Alba ” : The mis-
take happened because
Bill was in such a des-
perate hurry. The corn-

he started howling for
mustard and pepper.
This flurried the slavey,
and instead of pepper
Bill got a tin shaker full
of flea-powder. After
dinner Mr. Public-house
wondered why Bill was
lying face-down on the
verandah. It may have
beentthe insecticide co-
operating with the beer,
for an hour later Bill was
seen tearing towards the
creek flapping his arms
and stretching his neck
skywards. He waded in
and thrashed tons of
water over Brannigan’s
selection. Then he built
himself a circular bed of
reeds and branches and
slept. He said after-
wards that something
had turned him into a
wild black swan; he
swore that he felt soft,
dark wings growing
from his shoulders. The
news of his strange experience travelled to
the uttermost run. Lone, haggard men who
scratched verses on billies and bark-huts wandered
into the pub. demanding flea-powder on their cab-
bage. Some of them became swans immediately
and lashed themselves into a frenzy over the
“ Australian Sonnet.” Some of them got no
warmer than a flea on an iceberg. Insecticide as
a brain-stimulant is more effective than three

“D. 8.”: Of tea, as of mustard, more is
wasted than is consumed. A peculiarity of the
bush man of every type is that, though his billy
may hold 2 or 3 quarts and he may only need a
pint of tea, he invariably makes a billy-full and
has to throw the balance away. Swagmen do
this because, as they will tell you, it spoils a billy
to boil only a small quantity of water in it.
Doesn’t seem to occur to them either to carry a
smaller billy or throw the surplus water out before
putting in the tea.

complacently surveyed the scene below. Pre

behind the sheep had no dog, and my own (log was
at my side, so I jumped on my horse to see what
was the matter. We could see no strange dog,
and were mystified until we found that a common
crow flying over the flock was doing the barking
and frightening the sheep. In my 30 years’ bush
experience I had never myself met with anything
of the kind, though I had heard a man say 1

j N MEMORIAM.
THE LATE MBS. .
In memory of my late dear wife, who departed this life at
10 minutes to 7 on the evening of Saturday, April 28th,
1900.
The late Mrs. was the eldest daughter
of the late and who were well
known and highly respected. The late
in the early days of North and South Gippsland,
was appointed Ohief Inspector of Police. He held
this responsible office for several years, being
then a young man, strong and healthy. He looked noble
in his uniform, and was active and brave in the pursuit of
his duties, and after years of service he resigned. He
then turned his attention to farming at
where the late happy couple lived for many years, but like
many other kind, good and useful members of this
world, they have since passed away. The late Mrs.
was sister to , now of , and (several
names given). The late Mrs. was born at , and
•v is 48 years old at the time of her death. She was well
>wn and highly respected by rich and poor alike. She
married 22 years ago in the Catholic Church, , by
me late Kev. Father , who has since passed away,
but we have a kind memory of him yet. Ever since her
marriage the late Mrs. had lived at the
homestead with her husband, comfortable and
peaceful ; during that time having eight children ; and
left five sons and two daughters to mourn her loss —one
having died some years back. On the evening of the 28th
April, less than two hours before her death, Mrs.
was in her usual good health, cheerful and
bright; she went into her bedroom and sat on a chair to
bathe her feet, and then came out to the front verandah,
where she knelt down on one knee to pare a corn that had
annoyed her very much. While she was in a stooping
position the blood flowed to her head, the over-pressure
upon a weak-artery in the head causing it to burst.
She then rose and went into the bedroom, where she
sat on a chair at the side of the bed and called her
daughter . She said, “ Oh, my head is swimming,
there is such a dreadful pain,” pointing to the right side
of her head. She asked that cold water cloths be placed
on her head, as it was burning, and to give her a drink of
cold water, also the bottle containing the Holy water.
She then became unconscious and began to vomit, and
after that she breathed rather heavily for a time, then
she went into a sleep, from appearance, and by the beat-
ing of her pulse she was still living, and apparently easy,
and in a sleep for about a quarter of an hour. Then the
pulse gradually weakened down until it stopped. She
died easy, for she never moved in the slightest, but
showed a happy life-like appearance on the features.
During the last few years she had complained of a violent
pain in the head at times, and it seemed that no medical
skill could effect a cure, and I often feared it would end
her life. She was truly an honest Christian,
and was fully prepared to ' meet her end at
any time. She was kind and good natured,
and was a dear wife and fond, loving mother.
Her death came so unexpectedly on Saturday evening
that there could not be any intimation given of her death
until Tuesday, it being then too late for the funeral
notice, only what was given by wire. The funeral was a
very large one, and it was wonderful to see the number of
relatives and friends, who came from far and near only
from what they had heard. You could see they had lost
one that they liked so well. The Bev. Father ,
unfortunately, was away at the time ; but on receiving a
wire he returned by the evening train, and tried nia
hardest to be there in time, but was a quarter of an hour
late. The Bev. Father started from , travel-
ling hard, and was there in time to perform the last sad
offices in the presence of a large number of sorrowing

23 Hunter Street (Only), SYDNEY.
One of liord Roberts’ Soldiers.
An old soldier of the Queen, Staff-Sergeant J.
Chalkley, late of the Bengal Commissariat Dept,
and the Bth. King’s Liverpool Regiment, residing
at Bunara Road, Horton Park (N.S.W.), was
recently called upon by a reporter.
Asked for an account of his experiences,
Sergeant Chalkley said lie had enlisted when only
17 and served in India and Afghanistan for 20
years. He was under Lord Roberts in the Afghan
Campaign of ’7B-9-80 and fought at Charasia and
Kabul, for which he received a medal and two
clasps.
“The climate and exposure told upon my
health,” he continued, “and in 1870 fever and
ague attended me with shivering fits, intense
cramping pains, and copious perspiration. Then
bronchitis came on and left me so weak that I
could not walk without a stick, and I was so dizzy
that I often had to catch hold of something to
save a fall. I could not sleep properly and rose
each morning quite worn out. Although treated
for 19 years by army surgeons, on Christmas Day,
’BB, I obtained my discharge, coming to Australia
and settling here ; working as a market gardener
whenever my health permitted. Several doctors
said I would never be rid of the effects of the
fever and one told my son I had not long to live;
but I was induced to commence Dr. Williams’
pink pills. Two or three boxes made me so much
stronger that I continued them, and although
when I commenced them I was very ill and unable
to work, I am now quite strong and well and work
in my garden with the hoe and spade without ill
effect. lam a living testimonial of the merits of
Dr. Williams’ pink pills, for I believe they saved
my life.”
Sergeant Chalkley’s cure is not an exceptional
one. Dr. Williams’ pink pills, by bracing up the
unstrung nerves, enriching the impoverished
blood, and strengthening the spine, made an
active man of him despite his long experience of
suffering. By acting on the cause of disease they
have cured thousands of cases of rheumatism,
sciatica, neuralgia, lumbago, bronchitis, con-
sumption, dysentry, coughs and colds, ladies
ailments, dyspepsia, paralysis, etc. Sold by the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., . Queen’s Place,
Sydney, two and nine per box, six boxes fifteen
and three, post free, and by chemists and store-
keepers—But mind you ask for Dr. Williams’.
Remember it was no substitute which cured
Sergeant Chalkley.*

“ A.P.R. ” : Re audacity of emus. Our
kangaroo-shooting camp last year was much fre-
quented by a big emu, in search of stray jam-tins,
etc. ' He watched me making bullets one day with
the greatest attention, and devoured them one by
one as I threw them behind me—without my
knowledge, of course. I got them back again,
though, by giving him another bullet in another
place.

When poking about the bush
on Callandoon station, near Goondiwindi, I
found in a hollow log the queerest little nest, made
of long dry grass, and in it three tabby kittens.
Took one of them, and it grew to be a fine cat,
but was always rather fierce, and much larger
than the domestic puss. The same run is the
home of many cats, whose ancestors were no doubt
lost from some pioneering caravan. The colors
are black, yellow and grey,

“A.B.T.”: Very noticeable is the
cowardice of the crow—as compared with the
“ magpie ” —when a nest is molested. Have often
climbed for crow’s nest, and the owner, if on hand
at the time, always fled the scene after one or two
protesting caws, not returning, although I have
waited hours. Mag, on the other hand, assumes
the offensive sometimes before you even get close
to the nest.

An escaped boar, which had been roaming
the E. Malvern district, near Melbourne, did so
much damage that police assistance was invoked,
and the quarry, after a long chase, succumbed to
five bullets from a trooper’s, carbine. “The
brute,” adds the Age scribe —here suddenly losing
his head—“ stood over 4ft. high, was Oft. long,
and had enormous tusks.” It was such another
reportorial genius who described a deerhound at
a Sydney dog-show as being “5ft. high at the
shoulder.” Very few dogs pass 32in., and a yard-
high tyke is colossal.

“P.H.C.” : Re dingo (“ P.,” B. 4/8/’00).
I have known a dingo, hard-pressed by dogs, to lie
on the ground, apparently feigning death. Also,
the dingo’s rough outer coat is certainly due to
acclimatisation. The dingo was brought to Aus-
tralia by the Dravidians of Southern India, and
the greater coolness of the Australian climate
accounts for the outer coat. [There is no satis-
factory evidence that the dingo was thus im-
ported, neither are ethnologists agreed that there
is any Dravidian element in the Australian
aboriginal race.]

“Mac”: Be fishes’ swallowing powers :
Last year a man netting in the Lachlan pulled in
a 301b. cod, which had swallowed a couple of feet
of net in getting at the smaller fish therein.

“ Yes,” said the cockie (in answer to ques-
tions by a commission-agent’s man who had called
for “one trial shipment ”) ‘‘ the ’67 flood was right
over the tops of them there trees,” pointing to two
80ft. Norfolk pines in front of the house. The
drummer smiled knowingly and departed. Lower
down he casually mentioned the “ lie ” to another
cockie whom he had buttonholed. “True enough,”
said cookie No. 2, “I see it ineself; but them
trees was only about 3ft. high then ! ”

“ L ir.” : Brilliant pastoral outlook in
West Queensland. A good drop of rain fell at one
station where they were shearing, and the sheep
were counted out of the pens, shorn and pretty
lively considering the season. Yet, after the
shower, 900 were dead in the yard in the morning.
The losses on that station from the Sin. of rain
that fell are fully 5000, including three animals
that had cost 110 guineas each.
He had had charge of a miser-
able little N.S.W. river school, and as
he grew his own vegetables, he often
appeared in school with soiled clothes.
But he generally had clean garments
with him ; and, if his wife, from oppo-
site bank of river, saw in the distance
a stranger approaching the school, she
would ‘ 1 cooee, ” and the teacher would
do a “lightning-change.” On one
occasion she was heard loudly shouting,
“Harry, put on your trousers —the
Inspector’s coming ! ” Unfortunately,
however, the Inspector also heard, and
wanted to know if “Harry” only
wore pants when being officially
visited.

“ F.A.R.” : In the ’so’s I once
got a cat from a storekeeper, up Graf-
ton way, and took it home with me
across the river—three-quarters-of-a-
rnile wide, and a very stormy night.
Cat duly installed in my. premises,
but by morning was back in her old
quarters. Now, the ferry-boat had
worked no more after I crossed, and
yet I can’t believe puss could have swum three-
quarters-of-a-mile of rough water.
Some information was lately gathered :n
various B.H. mines as to the life of timbers under-
ground. So far as Oregon, imported from
America, is concerned, it was found that everything
depended on ventilation. In a hot, damp stope
the timber had become quite useless through
dry-rot in four years. In similar situations red-
gum, put in 12 years ago, was crumbling away.
Oregon put in shortly afterwards in a well-venti-
lated drive was perfectly sound. The best results
absolutely were achieved by mulga, the native
timber of those parts; but mulga grows only a
few feet high, and is rarely 6in. through. So ex-
cellent a timber is it that, in white-ant-infested
districts on Darling sheep stations, mulga posts
erected over 30 years ago are still standing.

“Xerxes ” : “ Bushie ” (B. 14/7/’00) must
be the dog the Contingent took away. Anyway,
I have a fiver that says he can’t produce fire from
two pieces of wood (that I will provide) in 48
hours, let alone a few minutes. That is, of course,
by hand-friction. He might with kerosene,
matches and tar, and a lot of work.

From a Queensland juvenile prize-essay
on “ Kindness to Dumb Animals ” :
Young bullock’s when they are going to be killed are
often driven long distances to meet their doom and are
then shut up in some dark little room, and lef there
unthought of by thoughtless men. Lamb’s have been
known to frolic and play about in the fresh air and sun-
shine and is then suddenly caught and dragged away by
cruel men. All these cruel habits go on every day, and
butchers out to use the quickest means for killing tin
animals. Alt lin stray doys ars so obstinate that they can-
not be moved and it is only right that they should be
given a drink and made return to its home if it has one.
Horses should be allowed not to gallop but to walk or
canter on hot days and there scarcely is ever any occasion
to be in such a hurry.
The last observation indicates that “That Tired
Feeling” is with Young Queensland already.

“ Baalam’s A." : Did “ Pigeon Pair ” (B.
30/6/’00) ever know a pigeon to lay more than two
eggs anyhow ?
The Acetylene Miners’ Lamps, introduced by
the Acetylene Gas Co. of Australia, Ltd., have proved a
great success and are now largely used in the mines
throughout the colony. The company has lately been
rushed with orders for lighting up gold-mining dredges
owing to the many advantages offered by the light for
that purpose. It would be well for mine and dredge
owners to ascertain full information as to cost, etc., from
the Head Office of the Company, 36 Pitt-street, Sydney.*
Herewith are published two photos. (casual “ snaps,” obtained under difficulties) of the so-
called Cresswell, to be discharged from Parramatta Lunatic Asylum to the care of Mr. E.
Priestman , of Sydney, who, in the firm conviction that Cresswell is really the long-lost Roger
Tichborne, is taking him to England. One picture shows the old man looking up in conversa-
tion, and in the other he is shown having his ear measured by Dr. Pickburn. Both right and
left profiles are thus shown, the lobule of the ear being normal in one case, but absent in the
othe r—as is proved to have been the case with Tichborne.

Jerome D. : Would much like to see him occupy
the office, but there is not the remotest chance of that,
as he is too downright a Radical and Nationalist Dis-
gusted : You omit to mention that the promoters of the
benefit (to sick and invalided N.S.W. soldiers) paid over £ll
for decorating the vice-regal box (did the vice-regal party
pay for its seats ?) and left only £3 14s. for the soldiers
J.L. (Inverell): This paper does not propose to glorify women
who sail out with horsewhips in quest of men who have
offended them. If the facts are as stated, it is to be
hoped the lady will be dealt with at the Police-court
E.A.O. : The point is that the mere suspension or disroll-
ment of a dishonest solicitor by the Judges does not
deprive the injured person of the right of prosecuting
him criminally. When brought before the Court the
s >licitor is not criminally arraigned : the question for the
Judges to decide simply is—“ Has he done anything
which precludes him from being allowed to continue
practice or calls for other punishment ? But the State,
which actively prosecutes the private embezzler,
hardly ever prosecutes the legal one W.M.8.: If
all those native names are retained, then there should be
no Federal Parliamentary rule compelling members to
address each other by their electorates E.P.A. : The
loaves and fishes of the Commonwealth service should
not be officirlfiTutriment to the stomachs of anti-Federal
sharks, anyljbw 11.8. : Rose Evans, Louise Pomeroy,
and some of/ier actresses have at different times essayed
the character in Australia, but only with the result of
making it ridiculous. One of the sisters Cushman was
very good as Romeo, but that is altogether a different
affair. Edmund lvean objected to enact the love-sick
hero, on the ground that he was not sufficiently manly
to be worthy of his (Kean’s) powers Spini-
fex : Quiet funeral; no fuss Archer: Fine pro-
mise—for the local paper F.D.B. (Whangarei) :
“ Riding of the Rebel ” is in Ogilvie’s “ Fair Girls and
Grey Horses,” 4s. 6d. post free from this office
G.M.W. : We’ll tell you how much we pay when you send
something worth paying for.. .. Mioko : Tiib Bulletin
has avoided the use' of the word “ colony,” and has
invariably substituted “province.” Now, of course, the
proper word is “ State.” Goburra; You deny that
young Australians commonly call a spade a “spyde,” or
pronounce cow “ kee-a-ouw.” Your experience does not
tally with our own. We know quite a number of other-
wise nice girls who will never get civilised husbands
because of their habit of calling cake “ kike,” and talking
about “ daown taown.” At a picnic, for instance : “ Mary’s
got the plites (plates) and Lucy’s got the graipes” (grapes).
“Locust’s” remarks are very little overdrawn
Richard T. : It’s pretty wooden ; but in mere routine-re-
porting there’s little room for felicity of style or minute-
ness of discrimination. You’d know if you tried it
T. : Appears to be mainly a long extract, with no apropos.
... . Inanalbar : “ Copyright reserved.” Ye gods—copy-
right of such doggerel !... .Balmain : The Navigation
Dept, is not entirely to blame. In its efforts to ensure
that no ships not well-found leave harbor it has to fight
not only the owners, but also the officers and the seamen
—such is the worker’s fear that he may lose his billet and
cast those dependent on him helpless upon the w0r1d....
Toscana : Too faraway a subject. And you could never
convince anyone here that the release of Sipido was not
an outrage on civilisation. As he was acquitted practi-
cally on the plea of irresponsibility, he should have been
locked up like any other homicidal alleged alieni....
O.W. : This paper certainly does not think that tram con-
ductors should be asked to change sovs. and half sovs.
It is of opinion that the public should be made to buy
tickets or to provide itself with reasonably small change.
The man who deliberately lays himself out thus to annoy
a poor devil of a conductor deserves no consideration
whatever... .Mowra : Merely patriotism of the shin-
ing-billy sort. The advt. of a designing trader
shamelessly pasted on the holy of holies. Such a
man would graze a goat on the grave of his
grandmother if only the thing paid 2£ percent....
White Eye : In Tasmania an unskilled laborer has a very
very poor show. That island is much more English than
Australia : much less pay and much more pulling of the
forelock. Would not advise you to go there, anyhow,
unless you get a billet in advance... .O.A. : We print
The Bulletin at sixpence in order to make it an
expensive vice W.L.P.: The question of provid-
ing for the manufacture of small-arms in Australia
is purely a matter for the Commonwealth, and is no
concern of the aldermen of the State Parliaments
J. 11. Cook : Thanks for letter. But the question is :
Does the fact that the Federal territory must belong to
and be vested in the. Federal Government imply that the
Federal Government must be, sole ground landlord, or
simply imply such ownership as the U.S. Federal
Government has in the District of Columbia ?
Opinions are so much divided that it is essential
to rouse the public to understand the importance of
the question. It isn’t good enough to rely solely on a
clause aboul which even lawyers are so much in dispute....
F.G. (Melbourne —pen-name illegible) : Will act on your
suggestion in some form or other when election time
comes. Meanwhile many thanks... .P. Smith : Well, it
was a good item, anyhow, and the details don’t matter...
E.II. : Good friend, you have struck the most hopeless
snag in the path of the social reformer. You may have
that snag and do the best you can with it. We are busy
on some other snags just n0w....0ne of the Dancers :
Glad you think The Bulletin a “ wonderful paper,” but
it was only by long years spent in carefully leaving
out items' like yours that it became wonderful.
The Bulletin has left out about 200 tons of
contributions since it started, and hopes to
leave out 2000 tons more before it dies
E.O. : Not up W.F.: Unusable.. . .Mansfield : No,
thanks Prospect: “Fathoms” lacks distinction
H.M. : Not amusing Fairholm : Not point enough
H. 8.5.: Not up H. Reed : “It is alleged in a medical
paper that it has been don e Etta P.: Goals to Newcastle
—an old Bulletin anecdote E.O. : It takes 1000
Chinese “ cash ” to make a dollar—say, 260 to the shill-
ing. The sycee, a silver coin, somewhat corresponds to
the shilling. The tael, a lump of silver shaped like the
Chinese woman’s crumped foot, represents about 3s
A.8.T.: Reads unconvincingly... .0. Simons: A great
error ; to shoot accurately with a revolver needs immense
practice. The average man simply couldn’t hit you at 15
paces in three tries with a navy pistol E. Price : Bul-
letin is not aware that it unduly “ jumps on ” the gentle-
man. Anyhow the matter isn’t one publicly discussable.
Kurrajong : Glad to hear from you again.... YVaimak :
No such story ever appeared in Bulletin .... Moandra :
You write like a “ bush-telegraph ” who quite sympa-
thises with the Governors. But for bush help those gentle-
men would no doubt have been caught long ere now
Skipper H. : Thanks . .G.M.A. .- Mere words T.E.T. :
Said suicide’s spook stifled.... Magnet: Quaint cuss !....
Shilli : No aspirate, please. ..Vida: Too unadvised and
sudden.... H. Dean B. : Has points about it, but would
need too much recasting.. . .Sydney S. : “ M.S.” you call
it ? It’s apparently the track of an army of beery spiders.
Ada M‘D. : Will make inquiry Steff C. : No more
tree-climbing... .Savage W. : No fun in obscene details.
F. Van: “Neiinii” too trifling for print H.M.
(W.A.) : Anyone who professes to be able to cure a patient
whom he has never seen is a quack. Send them no more
money There are some good doctors in Perth
O.T.S. (Bris.): Baron Carrington was N.S.W. Governor at
the Mt. Rennie time....lnhambane : For all we know,
there may be no doctor of that name at all E.A.L.:
But should North Shore necessarily growl because all the
Hospital Saturday money locally collected does not go to
its own hospital ? Scores of bad and troublesome medical
and surgical cases from the Shore find their way to the city

Many thanks.... Mileah: It isn’t too late to repent. The
trouble is that the public so soon forgets all about its re-
pentance J. (Donald): None of them suitable... .Wild
Monaro Joe : That daily paper complained of the alleged

Joe from Monaro that doesn’t affect you. Or are you a
tame Joe from Botany? N.M.S. : Some information
can be obtained from the Statesman’s Yeah Book
Sawny Hide: Poem gone at both knees Kelpie:
The B.C. was referred to.


Mr. Deakin, Victoria’s virtuous delegate to see a man
in London about the Federal Bill, has, as you have
heard, returned £450 out of the £lOOO allowed him for
expenses. Hence this unseemly mirth.
“ Come and have a drink with me," he
used to say to Mr. Chamberlain, and the
other Federal delegates ; but when they
found it meant a drink out of the horse-trough they praised his
soonomy rather than blessed his hospitality.
When the Prince of Wales offered him a big cigar he didn’t smoke it
and damn Chicago. “ No,” he said simply, “ no, thanks ; as a Federal
delegate I can't afford to give away cigars, so I won’t accept any. I shall
stick to my pipe.”
Many dark bints are afloat of the austere econOHlidw
practised l>y him to save money to hiB province whilii
in London.
While Barton, Dickson, etc., were
wasting the substance of their vari-
ous provinces in riotous living ai)d
faring sumptuously every day, this thoughtful patriotic man
munching penny sandwiches and gingerbread horses to the
glory of God and the reduction of Victoria s deficit.
And if the table, ink-pot and pen (A,
B, and C in the above) used by the
Queen in signing the Bill are worth pre-
serving among the trophies of a new-born
nation, let side by side with them {in the
same show-c'ase, if possible) repose the
ink-pot and pen (D.d.) used by Deakin in
signing that £450 cheque !
The Man who Broke the Bank at
Monte Carlo isn’t on the same pede-
stal with the Man who Wrote His
Cheque for Four-and-Fifty.
Hence, pleads the applauding
lininer of these lines, let us raise
a waxen statue to this man and
place it in some conspicuous (hut
cool) part of the Commonwealth, say
the design subLittld the holes burnt in the pockets by tV*t £lOOO.

-i counted fpr. When Mr. Deakin left for London

since the Budget papers had been made up the

Dr. Gresswell, President of Victorian
Board of Health : “ There is no
danger in coming to Sydney at
the present time. Of course, it

visitors go. To come to a place
like The Australia Hotel is to run

“Gunner” re sepoy-chivalry :
“Old Jack” (B. 11/8/’OO) says my observations about
sepoy-chivalry are “ rot,” but all the cases 1 mentioned
were judicially investigated and may be looked up in
Kaye’s and Ma'lleson’s “Sepoy War” and Gen. Cavanagh’s
book of Recollections. Gen. Cavanagh, whose published
“Recollections” are in Sydney Public Library—knew
more of what went on in India than anyone else because
in ’57-8 he was Fort-Major at Calcutta, and every military
document and all reports from up-country passed through
him to Gov.-General Canning, who insisted on seeing
everything. Cavanagh in his book says expressly that
outrages did not occur. Now, I have made no statement
on my own authority, and can corroborate every'word I
write. The fact is, neither Mahoinmedan nor Hindu ever
violates women. The one is forbidden by the Law of the
Koran, and to the other it would mean defilement, and
loss of caste. All stories to the contrary are simply due
to the prurient fancies of ignorant Europeans who know
really nothing of the natives of India.
[The white man also is forbidden by his religion—
as far as that goes—and caste sits very lightly on
low-class Hindus.—Ed. B.]
This is the queerest of several queer letters
to hand at The Bulletin office this week :
Sydney, 11th Aug., 1900. The Editor Bulletin. Sir! 1!
I see in your answers to correspondents this week that
you have refused my contribution. Now Sir, I will
watch your paper closely and if you dare to publish my
poem, I will take proceedings against you. Had you
accepted it at first I would not have been very pleased,
for I did wrong in sending it to you. Most of my produc-
tions are full of loyalty and breathe loving respect for the
motherland ; knowing, however, that your vile vitupera-
tive rag would not accept such effusions, I, for once, de-
scended to your own low, zero-like level. The merit of
the poem was not, perhaps, high ; on such a theme
the muses fail to rouse the glowing imagery
of my dormant genius, but I am sure it was
far above many of the insipid lucubrations which
you have the audacity to print in your foul sheet.
I do not take your refusal as an insult, on the contrary, I
think it will raise me in the estimation of myself and my
friends. Sir, I will not cease to subscribe to your paper.
No ! in its putrefying columns I will follow with interest
(as showing to what depths of degradation human beings
can descend) the rotten, corrupt productions of its de-
praved contributors; and, by the tone and matter of its
leaders I will note with gloating joy, the descent of its
abandoned editor to that fathomless pit where his master
awaits to reward him for his faithful and fruitful services
on earth.—Yours in eternal enmity, Joseph C F

The Bulletin hopes to hear from this gentleman
again—though as somebody once remarked,
“Nobody named Joseph was ever an entirely
satisfactory person.”

The Land of the Leper.
J. Spence Evison writes of lepers and things
leprous:—
The vultures of the West gather to gorge the Leper of
the East! Only a very first-class prophet, one of the
ancient and ex.tinct breed, might pretend to predict even
the proximate result of that carious carousal. That the
partition of China by the Western Powers —if it go for-
ward—will almost assuredly ignite the slow match tied to
the big barrel of gunpowder on which Great Britain and
Europe now uneasily squat may with safety be presaged
even by the common, carmine-nosed seer of the streets.
But no one living can say who will come down whole
after that explosion, and no one, alive or dead, can fore-
tell what will happen, the partition effected, when the
Chinese, having enjoyed the “inestimable blessings” of
Western civilisation—having been armed, drilled, dis-
ciplined, taxed, and preached to on the most modern
Christian methods —feel a call to run this sublunary uni-
verse on their own! Posterity’s troubles, no doubt 1 Still,
eventhe most ardent admirer of the “ mild, gentle, indus-
trious and frugal ” Chow might gather discomfort from the
possibility that a hundred years hence would see his
great-grandson the helot of an unwashed Mongolian with
elephantiasis, St. Paul’s (London) a Chinese joss-house,
Westminster Abbey a Chinese laundry, and the Anglican
Cathedral, Sydney, and the Scots’ Church, Collins-st.
Melbourne, opium-den and samshu- shop respectively.
~ * * * *
At this particular juncture when—largely owing to the
gospel according to Joseph Chamberlain, who originally
started to save and sanctify British humanity with three
acr6s and a cow, but who now perceives the redemption
of his race in more acres and less cow—the belief largely
obtains that Providence wants the British to chop this
world into building sections, the person who publicly
argued that the partition of China is an almost impossible
task would be properly and painfully bashed by a
patriotic populace. Africa has been nicely divided, why
not China ? The patriots forget, or probably never knew,
that the gulf between the inhabitants of the two
countries is nigh fathomless. The one people—mostly
of savage tribes, each bitterly antagonistic to all the
others, speaking many tongues, and acknowledging many
rulers and a great many more gods—have compara-
tively little to forget and the mental capacity to learn
little at present, save that a Mauser is more murderously
effective than an assegai, and that Christian brandy
affords a more complete, complicated, and swift drunk
than pagan beer. In China, on the other hand, are some
400,000,000 of a people of naturally acute intelligence, of
an extraordinary and prehistoric civilisation, and possess-
ing a tradition, more sacred than any religion, of condign
hatred and contempt for the creeds and civilisation of the
“outer barbarian.” These millions, despite diversities of
dialect, have one tongue (“ Mandarin ” Chinese) compre-
hended in every corner of the vast kingdom, and there is
no suspicion of the deadly hostility between the followers
of Confucius, Buddha, and Tao, which exists in India
between Mohammedans and Hindus, and which animosity
alone preserves the British raj in the latter country. Nor
is the acute dividing line of caste, prolific cause of native
dissension in India, known in China, though even there a
few trades —iron-workers, actors, barbers, and musicians
—do not wear the gilt-edged halo of respectability.

We are told there is a Progressionist party in China.
No doubt there is—of a sort. But it is merely a section
of the most practical of the people, who, after long con-
tact with foreigners, have most unwillingly had the con-
clusion rammed into their comprehension, not that
foreign methods are in any sense better than Chinese, but
that the guns and ships of the foreign devil, in native
hands, are more fitted to keep the “ foreign devil ” out of
China than are gingals and junks. The present writer
once bade an educated and intelligent Chinaman to note
the difference between a splendid English frigate (China
had not then any foreign ships of war) and an adjacent
rattletrap war junk. The heathen’s .comment was:
“ English ship too muchee stlong, Chinee ship too much
handsome, go lah 1 ” That dictum represents not only
the sentiment, but the profound belief, touching the
merits of all things foreign and native, held by the most
progressive of Chinese progressionists. In wildest dreams
they have never conceived that progress would mean
Cossacks at Canton, and the administration of the Yang-
tse Kiang in the hands of a British J.P., assisted by
Tommy Atkins and the N.S.W. Lancers.
* * » •
The quidnuncs argue, however, that whether the parti-
tion of China be agreeable to the Chow or not, it can be
easily effected, because the Chinese are cowards and can-
not fight. There are, in one sense, no greater cowards
on earth than the Manchus, and, at the same time,
despite the apparent contradiction, none who fear death
itself less. If they are ever admirable, it is when dying.
Let a European in China slap a Chinaman’s face, and the
latter will lie down and howl with an exceeding great
howl, and will subsequently smear himself with the blood
of sheep and goats, stain liis face the light-green hue his
complexion would wear at the point of decease, wind
bandages round his unsavory person, and, repairing to
the nearest foreign consul, swear, by every god known to
him and some promiscuous ones, that he has suffered
brutal and horrible assault and battery. If, however, the
same caitiff Chow knows you mean killing him, he will
face the music with frigid composure. The present scribe
saw, during a long residence in China, numberless
instances of this disregard for death—one may here
suffice : When, in the early sixties, Ningpo was taken by
the Taipings, some foreigners residing in the foreign con-
cession, thinking to annex certain apparently ownerless
casks of sugar, took over the river to the city 40 odd
coolies for that purpose. A Taiping guard suddenly
appeared on the scene, and, .without interfering
with the foreigners, began to saw off the
coolies’ heads with knives none too sharp. Those
who suffered never whimpered or flinchedsome of
the others, waiting their turn, however, represented to
the executioners that they had not yet “ eaten rice,”
which was awaiting them aboard their boats. The
Taipings, being really quite good-natured persons, and in
no hurry, permitted the coolies to go and get their break-
fast. That finished, the latter returned, and had their
heads removed, with indescribable sangfroid.
* * * *
Whenever the fighting capacity of the Chinese comes up
for discussion we have the inevitable reference to
Gordon’s Ever Victorious Army as demonstrating that
the Chinese can fight, if only led by English officers, but
that they are indifferent murderers otherwise. In the
first place the Ever Victorious Army was originally dis-
ciplined by the American, Ward —an old Nicaraguan fili-
buster—and the members of it were veterans before
Gordon knew anything about them. In the next, the
army, composed not of true Chinese, but of Mongol
Tartars, had, even in Gordon’s time, few English among
Che sweepings of hell and Texas calling themselves
captains, majors, and what not. Finally, the army only
fought, and then with very moderate pluck, when it was
quite top dog in the scrimmage—when opposed to com-
paratively unarmed Taipings, and when backed by flat*
bottomed gunboats carrying heavy guns. In a hand-to-
hand fight the Taipings always turned the “ Ever Vic-
torious” inside-out, and frequently out-manmuvred
British regular officers. The Taipings, on the other hand
—true Chinese, wearing long hair and not the pigtail
(Manchu badge of servitude)—fought with unsurpassable
gallantry, coming to close grips whenever possible, and
disdaining the use of foreign mercenaries. _ When
Burgoyne, Ward’s erstwhile lieutenant, went with some
of Gordon’s dissatisfied foreign swashbucklers into the
Mon Wang’s camp at Soochow, the Taipings showed such
contempt for the deserters that Gordon, to save their
lives, entreated the Moh Wang to send them back. The
latter did. “ Take your white-faced trash 1 ” said that
sturdy, ignorant, but valorous old fighting man.
• * * *
As a matter of fact, no living foreigner can say with
certitude whether the Chinese will, in the event of
attempted partition, fight to any extent or not. And
this simply because the Western mind is totally unable
to understand the springs of Chinese action. Foreigners
who have been a life-time in the country, and who speak
the language, will be the first to own they have no com-
prehension of Chinese motives. To the ordinary intelli-
gence, a Chow always seems to act only after the most
profound consideration. Yet occasionally they seem to
be impulsive as the hottest-blooded Celt. The foreigner
may have a Chinese servant with him for a, quarter
of a century, may trust him during the time with
untold dollars, and prove him trustworthy as the day,
though if the “ boy” only strolled into the nearest native
city he would be as irretrievably “ lost ” as if he went
to the North Pole. Then, some night, the “ boy,” grown
grey in one service, will cut his master’s throat for a
couple of Mexican dollars. The writer, at a time when,
from the Peiho to the Chu Kiang, the coast swarmed with
native pirates, when the boss pirate, Apak, who defied
even English gunboats, was on the warpath, had for crew
for years certain Ningpo-men, never so happy as when in
tight places tackling odds. We were mostly convoying
salt-junks, and Chinese pirates are perhaps the most un-
tamed devils of cruelty above the fire-line, yet those
Ningpo-men would go out of their way to meet them. One
night, sailing from Ningpo to Chusan, a small junk we
could have blown out of water with one gun had the
cheek to try to stinkpot us. The Ningpo-men, without
firing a shot, scuttled below and hid 1 A missionary may
pursue his calling in the same locality for years, meeting
only the silent contempt Chinamen normally extend to
gentlemen of his cloth. Then, some fine morning, with-
out word of warning, they will sack the missionary’s nice
bungalow, take his choice fowls, trample on his beautiful
flowers, perhaps roast, boil, or stew in tea-oil the
missionary man himself. But instances of such strange
inconsistency could be multiplied ad nauseam.
* * • *
In the writer’s humble opinion, there will be no great
amount of fighting in the North of China, should it be
determined by the Powers to proceed to partition.
The real trouble will first rage from the Yang-tse Kiang
to the Chu Kiang or Canton River. The Northern
Chinese, though big, are a pretty soft lot, but Kiangsu,
Nganwhi, Chekiang, Tokien, and Kwantung are—
especially Chekiang and Kwantung—choke-full of Chows
who both can and will fight. No doubt the armaments of
these provinces are poor enough, though vast quantities
of foreign war material have been imported of late years.
But not only have the Chinese the same contempt for
foreign weapons they have for everything else not
Chinese, and which leads them to neglect the proper pre-
servation of their arms, but, when they get a new big gun
or a few stand of small arms, they, like children with new
dolls, monkey round with them till the bran stuffing falls
out. In the old Taiping days the foreigners running arms
into rebel territory always took care to supply plenty of
thick tea-oil to purchasers ; the latter would immediately
begin squibbing off their weapons, and would continue
doing so until the locks became choked with bad
gunpowder and oil. The smuggler, on his next
visit, would clean and re-oil the lock and charge his cus-
tomer almost the price of a new gun. _lt was a fine, up-
standing business while it lasted. It is probable, there-
fore, that the Chinese armaments are not in first-class
repair. Even allowing for this, we must remember the
hundreds of thousands of lives the Chinese authorities
can always afford, out of their enormous population, to
throw away—a fact which would go far to balance the
superiority of foreign skill and equipment.
So far we have been considering only the coastal pro-
vinces, in which are the treaty ports, and which are the
only provinces known, and that most imperfectly—to
foreigners. Bitter as the feeling against the outer bar-
barian is in the provinces accustomed to their presence,
it is inconceivably more hostile inland. It will need many
foreign armies to over-run and conquer Honan, Hupeh,
Hoonan and Szechuen alone. Granting the possibility of
such conquest, the most unsolvable problem will still re-
main—the occupation of the country and the govern-
ment of a people hostile, incomprehensible and homo-
geneal.
THE MEETING.
For the Bulletin.
The star-gemmed ti&tt of Night was drawn
All silently apart;
Before the Altar of the Dawn
I stood with beating heart.
The Rising Sun with priestly hand
The sleeping world did bless,
And there was over all the land
The hush of holiness.
A Maiden robed in rosy mist
To where I stood drew nigh;
The flowers raised their heads and kissed
Her feet as she went by.
A light was in her eye of blue —
Could I that light forget 1—
Like sunlight in a globe of dew
Upon a violet.
“ Madam," I said, “ ’tis years ago
Since under far-off skies
We met —and yet, methinks, 1 know
Those blue immortal eyes.
“ I go with laurelled lyre to sing
Spring’s journey to the South."
Said she: "My dearest, I am Spring!"
And kissed me on the mouth.
VICTOR-J.DALRY.
Home Again.
“ Tell the news in brugh and glen,
Donald Oaird’s come again 1”’
Less stout, less rubicund than when he left us,
but hale and hearty after months’ wandering,
Edmund Barton is back in Australia with the
Commonwealth Constitution Act in his pocket,
and Queen Victoria’s table, inkstand, and pen
stowed snugly among his forthcoming luggage.
“Like England, ‘a little body with a mighty
heart,’ ” Queen Victoria seemed to Barton;
“but wearing wonderfully well. I was struck by
the strength of her voice ; it held vitality. (The
Prince of Wales’s voice” —Barton’s eye twinkles
—“ holds a strong German accent.) Did you hear
what she said to Bishop Barry, on his presentation
after returning to England ? ‘ You did not stay
long in Australia?’ ‘No, your Majesty, my
wife’s health was not good in Sydney.’ ‘Oh . . .
why didn’t you take her to the Blue Mountains ? ’ ”
The dignity of the House of Commons impressed
Barton. “Yet the debates were not dull and
sombre. Only the members did not make per-
sonal imputations ; they argued to the matter in
hand. Tim Healy made a bright speech while I
was there. ‘Mr. Speaker,’ he said, ‘I have
listened attentively as the Chief Secretary enu-
merated the titles of Australia to the right of self-
government. The Chief Secretary is a man
of great discernment. He sees clearly that it
is for the benefit of the Empire that Australia
should be united under an independent govern-
ment for the administration of local affairs. On
the other hand, he sees no less clearly that Ireland
should not have the right of independent govern-
ment for the administration of local affairs. Mr.
Speaker, the Chief Secretary is a man of great
knowledge. He must be aware that the Irish in
Australia have risen to the very highest positions
in the Government. He knows that the Insh have
contributed greatly to the progress of Australia.
He knows that they have taken a prominent part
in rendering that recent assistance to the Empire
on which he has laid such stress. Can it be, Mr.
Speaker, that the Chief Secretary considers that
an Irishman is unable so to govern himself as to
become a good subject of the Empire until he has
been transported ? ’
“Chamberlain struck me as the strongest Par-
liamentarian. He is a man of great force of
character, very able, very adroit, and, in my
opinion, perfectly honest. His face has, from a dis-
tance, a somewhat narrow cast. That vanishes when
you see him closely. He works very hard ; and
takes no exercise during the week. But when he
goes home from Friday to Monday he is always
walking and pottering about his garden. He has
a very fine landscape garden, as well as his
orchids. As to his character, there are two thing’s
by which you can especially judge a man : the re-
gard in which his family holds him, and his de-
meanour towards ladies. If you test Chamber-
lain by any such criterion, your good opinion of
his personality is confirmed.
“ Two of the most personally charming men I
met were Arthur Balfour and John Morley.
I was struck by their delicate distinction of mind,
their refinement of character. At one dinner I
was placed between Balfour and the Chancellor,
Lord Halsbury. The contrast between the genial
simplicity of the one, the stateliness of the
other, was most marked. At dinner, one prefers
simplicity. Morley is not popular at present,
owing to the belief that he is allied with the Pro-
Boer Party, which represents a very small section
Of the nation. But his intrinsic worth is every-
where admitted. Of Lord Salisbury I saw and
heard little ; but the force of a speech which I did
hear was striking. I should say that, in spite of
his age, there is nothing to justify any impression
of weakness. The Prime Minister of England is
still possibly England’s most forceful statesman.
Sir Charles Dilke’s intellect is esteemed ; but his
influence extends only as far as his intellectual im-
pression. It may be that in England they are
stricter than we are.
“I saw less of literary men than I wished to—
we were kept so busy with the BilL One whom I
found very charming was George Russell, author
of “ Collections and Recollections.” Pinero —he
is a smallish man, and straight up and down
—seemed to me both clever and kind. I saw
Irving in “The Bells.” He was very fine, and
left me unmoved. The best acting I saw _in
London was Miss Evelyn Millard’s impersonation
of “Madam Butterfly.” It was so simple and
intense. The piece is pathetic, and I think every-
body was crying: you could hear the sobs.
Melba—a voice like a bird’s, every gesture
accurate, and no warmth, no passion. The
delegates were so hospitably entertained that we
seemed to meet nearly everybody you hear spoken
of. The Universities were very kind. I remem-
ber particularly a dinner with Dr. Butler, the
Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He objects
to smoking, so it is customary with guests to ad-
journ after dinner to the rooms of another Don,
Dr. Jackson, one of the most attractive of men,
whose intellectual stature is well adorned by
simple beauty of character.
“I think that the scenery of the Thames was
the most striking I saw in England. I liked
particularly the fine English trees —and the grass.
The solid character of the English is noticeable.
They seem less nimble of spirit than Australians ;
yet I do not think they have any advantage of
physique. But one interesting thing is the num-
ber of tall women you see everywhere—as tall as
the men ; in Paris they are taller, and the men
shorter. In Australia I suppose the men have
still what we are accustomed to think the natural
superiority of height.
“The Commonwealth Constitution Act? 1
think that had we been strongly sup-
ported from Australia it would have passed
the House of Commons intact. The same had
the Liberal party been in power ; their represen-
tatives were unanimous in holding that the right
of local independence should apply as well to the
judiciary as to the legislature. In the result, as
to the disputed clauses, the Act is a com-
promise ; and, though I should have pre-
ferred to see nothing altered, I think the
compromise is satisfactory. Australia owes very
much to Kingston for the strength and de-
termination which he showed throughout our
negotiations ; and Deakin’s adroit ability was of
the greatest service to us. The course before us
now is a course of pretty plain sailing; but the
first Federal Ministry will have c> great deal of
hard work to get through.

Of course” —Barton chuckles —“that is not for
publication.”
A remittance-man named Brocklehurst,
who suicided recently in a Christchurch (M.L.)
hotel, made a luxurious exit. His draft hadn’t
turned up, and he suspected that it was coming
no more, so he decided to quit while he had still
money enough to do it in an expensive, high-class
fashion. He dined well, had a lire made up in his
private sitting-room, ordered up a scuttlefull of
coal, some biscuits, and a-bottle of champagne,
and having got through his liquor he shot himself
like a gentleman in an easy chair before the fire.
The missing remittance turned up a day or two
afterwards ; but that is a mere detail.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ Out of dry, marrowless political bones,
not even a stew of statesmanship is possible”:
Opinion of N.S.W. country editor on provincial
parliamentarians in the field for Federal honors.
Gibbon, in the “Decline and Fall”:
“ I have never met with an instance of a conquer-
ing army being as numerous as the male
inhabitants of the conquered territory.” So
another record has been made.
A big and important Albury faction says
it will support Premier Lyne for that constituency
in the House of Representatives provided he
pledge himself to advocate Albury, and Albury
only, as the site for the Federal capital.
“In Australian sentiment, Australia
should be a home, and not a boarding-home ” —for
the benefit of the Empire. Pity it should be
necessary for departing U.S. Consul Bell to tell
us that. The Home party and the Boarding-
house party. Good !
The other day a wayback squatter, in
addressing a meeting of station-hands, said he
meant to be a candidate for the Federal Parlia-
ment, and that he would pay shearers 20s. per 100
and give 255. a week and tucker to rouseabouts.
Evidently a heaven-born statesman.
Premier Lyne must surely be a somewhat
embarrassed Federal candidate. The Border elec-
torates are too Federal for him, and he can hardly
forget the dangerous run given him when he
sought re-election as a Minister for the State con-
stituency of the Hume. Had he not been Premier
his peril would have been greater.
Vic. Leg. Council is nominally elective,
but, as a matter of fact, walks-over are so common
that only four of the 48 Rich Landlords hold their
seats in virtue of an election, and some have never
faced their constituents in a contest since they
were first seized with the belief that they were
Heaven-born statesmen. Yet none of them are
technically “nominees.”
An old member of the A.'N.A., a member
of Vic. Parliament, offered to bear the expense of
compiling a roll of all who voted at last year’s
Victorian Federal Referendum—the roll to be
presented to the Federal Executive, ar.d to be
AFTER BIGGER QUARRY.
EXCITABLE CONSTABLE ( sole protector of the terrified township within a few
miles of which the Breelong blacks were last seen, to “Saucy Sal,” to
whom a night or two in “jug” has become second nature): “Now
then, get ye home. If I hadn't more important business on Old
run yez in.”
placed in the archives of the Commonwealth.
The offer has been accepted, and a commission ap-
pointed to prepare this roll of “Fathers of their
Country.”
Editor Hackett, of Perth West Aus-
tralian, intends to run for the Federal Senate,
i ■ has evidently figured it out that the smaller
States are more likely to get a Ministerial repre-
sentative in that chamber than in the Representa-
tives, where, proportionately to Vic. and N.S.W.,
they will be numerically weak. Besides, most
of the other aspirants for office are running for the
bigger body.
Barton, at the big Sydney Town Rail
meeting, remarked that if the delegates had had
better backing from Australia they would have
got more concessions from Chamberlain. Lyne
was sitting on the platform, and must have
blushed to the soles of his feet when he thought
how easily the .Premiers here backed down at the
first sign of fight from the pugnacious screw-
maker of Birmingham.
Maoriland Government was incurably mean
to the very last in its dealings with Hansard
chief Grey, whom it dismissed for writing in an
American paper about the Boer war. Parliament
decided at 2 a.m. on the morning of 20th July to
sack Grey, aud same day it gave him a cheque for
nineteen days’ wages and turned him loose. It
even got things down so fine as to defraud him of
his last day’s salary.
It is insolently proposed by a section
of the present N.S.W. Parliament that the mem-
bers be presented with a life free pass over the
State’railways and tramways on the strength of
their being memliers of the last Parliament before
the establishment of the Commonwealth ! As an
alternative, The Bulletin proposes that every
member supporting this scheme of robbery be
branded “ Dingbat ” on the forehead and turned
loose.
Ominous passage in Kingston’s Adelaide
speecli:—
We ought to have (rot the Commonwealth Bill, line and
letter. It was not our fault that we did not (ret it. Where
the fault lies lam not going to enquire to-day. Perhaps
you know ; perhaps you’ don’t. It was a question of
loyalty to Australia—loyalty to Australia should have its
reward, and disloyalty should be punished.
Everyone instinctively scanned the platform, and
noticed that Chief-Justice Way was prominently
absent.
Several absurdly self-satisfied persons who
have unsuccessfully contested every possible elec-
tion since the year One are in the field for the
Federal Parliament—believing somehow that the
widened constituencies give them a better chance.
Also, quite a number of tinpot politicians, who
by sheer force of lodge, church, culvert and street-
lamp influence have contrived to get their wooden
heads inside the provincial Parliaments, are
ambitioning Federal seats.
N.Z. Herald on the S’African war :
No work ever undertaken by us as a people ever equalled
in magnitude the task of making South Africa a land free
to our generations yet unborn.
In other words, Magna Charta, the Reformation,
the Spanish Armada,.the settlement of America,
the conquest of India, and the Napoleonic
wars, were all trifles compared with the task of
crushing 40,000 Dutch farmers, who have been
over and over again described as “ cowards.”
There is more dissatisfaction among
the M.L. Goyt. party than Premier Seddon
cares to admit. The strongest opposition to some
of his measures—particularly the increase in
Ministerial salaries —came from his own ranks.
In fact, the increases in Govt, screws, as origin-
ally proposed, had to be much reduced ere Seddon
ventured to bring the subject before the House.
The caucuses on the subject were very stormy.
The dissentients are known as “the Boxers,” and
the Opposition is doing what it can to widen the
breach by studiously refraining from criticism and
from giving united votes.
The L.O.L.
in N.S.W. has
formed a new
Association “to
endeavor to se-
cure a fair share
of preferment
and promotion
for Protestants
now in the Pub-
lic Service,” &c.
It is proposed
“to open up
communications
with M.’s'L.A.,
Protestant Min-
isters, Protest-
ant employers,
and lodges, in-
viting them to
send word to the
office when any
men are required
or vacancies like-
ly to occur in the
public or private
services.” At this
rate no man, Pro-
testant or Catho-
lic, who is not a
member of some
secret society or
other will be able
to get public em-
ployment at all.
The Public Ser-
vice is already
laden with sec-
taries of various
colors, and peo-
ple are saying
that to secure an
interview with
some big officials
the applicant is
required to first
recite the Doxo-
logy or “Hail Mary” to the messenger. What
is badly needed is a society to procure soft billets
for men with false teeth.
Of the various syndicate railways at pre-
sent before Q. Parliament, the most dangerous
and obnoxious is undoubtedly the Normanton-
Cloncurry, inasmuch as it bids fair in time to
develope into a trunk line. Its length is 435
miles—big enough to be deemed a principal line
in many countries. It will be remembered that
MTlwraith’s famous but unsuccessful transcon-
tinental scheme included a section that would
have been the counterpart of the above-mentioned
line.
Minister Piesse, of Westralia, has thrown
his resignation at Bigjohn’s head, and the Bigjohn
Ministry is said to be crumbling. But it is just
possible that Piesse’s exit will strengthen it.
A N.S.W. VISION OF THE FUTURE.
Piesse made great trouble at the Railways by his
efforts to suppress trades-unionism among the
employes, and as Bigjohn quarrelled with him on
this point the latter should gain democratic sup-
port out of the matter, unless he makes the great
mistake of persuading Jonah Piesse to climb on
board again.
Q. Minister for Education Drake is en-
couraging the teachers all over Bananaland to run
up flag-staffs in the school grounds and float the
Union Jack thereupon. The kiddies are to be
taught to salute Britain’s emblem every morning.
During the recent Federal campaign Drake was to
be seen unfurling the Australian flag on Brisbane
platforms, but, apparently, our national emblem
is to be discarded as soon as the land suffers from
an outbreak of Jingo fever. Come—which flag is
it to be ?
Much of the earlier part of Barton’s speech
at Sydney Town Hall was an apology for Dick-
son. That floundering politician came late, and
when called upon after Barton, gave a long, halt-
ing explanation, punctuated by many gulps of
water, of how the ’cute Chamberlain got the Im-
perial salt on to his (Dickson’s) tail. How on
earth such a dismal, commonplace, ineffective
speaker ever “ arrived ” to be sent on such an im-
portant mission is utterly incomprehensible to
Southerners.
As illustrating the trials of a straight
Labor representative in the North, the following
might be quoted: McDonald, M.L.A. for the
constituency of Flinders (a Labor stronghold), re-
ceived a telegram from the secretary of the Labor-
party at Cloncurrv requesting him to support the
proposed syndicate line from Normanton to above-
mentioned town. State-ownership of railways is,
of course, one of the first planks in the Labor
platform. Truly, Premier Philp is a wily
adversary !
Maoriland has, roughly speaking, one-
fiftieth the population of the United Kingdom,
so when Premier Seddon proposes to organise a
force of 10,009 men available for foreign service—•
he hasn’t, however, said anything about it in his
Budget-speech—-that is equivalent to Britain
maintaining 500,000 men ; whereas the British
force available for foreign service is only about
350,000. Seddon, in his new-born Jingo frenzy,
is striving to be more loyal to Britain than Britain
is to herself.
The chairman of the Labor-party of S.A.
(Tom Price, M.P.) tips South Australia’s first
seven members of the House of Representatives
thus: Education Minister Batchelor (Labor),
Works Minister Foster, “Paddy” Glynn, Treas.
Holder, ex-Premier Kingston, ex-Agent-General
Plavford, and Tom Price (Labor). The Labor
nominees for the Senate will probably be Guthrie,
M.L.C., and Gregor M‘Gregor, M.L.C. The
latter, though blind, is full of general information
and strong m common-sense.
Frequent references to N.S.W. Public
Works Committee of questions which cannot
come practically before Parliament in the current
session lead to the opinion that the Lyne Govt.,
like the Reid, desires to feed that body with
generous fees. Some member should inquire how
much money was paid during the Reid regime to
the P.W. Committee for sitting on speculative
themes, such as the new Parliament Houses. And
at the same time a similar return might be asked
for covering the period Lyne has been in power.
Home Secretary Foxton (Q.) told an
audience of Queenslanders recently that.he had
withdrawn “1000 aboriginal children from the
control of the Q. Education Department so as to
be able to give them the benefits of religious
instruction.” That is to say, Foxton thinks the
Q. system altogether too poor for the offspring of
Kitty and Warrigal, but amply good enough for
the white youngsters. By the way, is it the
correct thing for a Minister of the Crown thus to
slur the educational system of the country he
helps to misgovern ? Foxton may be some sort of
a judge of what is fit for aboriginal heathen, but
so far he evidently isn’t much of an authority on
the best way of running a White Country for
White Men.
Among the IN'.S.W. 'M’s.P. who
daily haunted the offices of the Commis-
sioners appointed to map-out the N.'S.
Wales Federal electoral sub-divisions
were the loudest and most illogical
denouncers of am and every scheme
of Australian unity. They are now
nearly all “Federal” candidates, and
they had the effrontery to implore the
Commissioners to make alterations in
the original plan to suit their elec-
tioneering purposes. Electors should
look sideways on all Federal candidates
who opposed Federation for selfish, ad-
vertising, or stupid reasons. Silver-
billy Gfeebungs, for instance.
If Panjandrum Syme permits,
11. H. Champion will again woo the
Albert Park electors this year. Should
he stand he is not likely to make such
a mistake as he did six years ago in
lggesting arbitration to decide which
of the three Liberal candidates should
contest the seat, with the result that
the Trades Hall influenced the arbi-
trators to strike Champion’s name off
the list. Although he had come late
into the contest, the cultured socialist
from London was getting right hold
of the Albert Parkites when his candi-
dature ended. This time he will take
the platform as a quiet old-established
Australian with a charming Australian
wife to help his canvass.
Does the JingoN.S.W. Education
Minister know that the following sedi-
tious and inflammatory sentences ap-
pear in the public-school books of
N.S.W. ? Fourth Reader, p. 220 :
They send out numerous colonists to possess the unoccu-
pied lands around, and some of them, who have a touch
of John Bull’s masterfulness, do not scruple to er'wuiin-
ate weaker races who may stand in their way.
Also, Fifth Reader, p. 225 :
I shall repudiate and denounce the expenditure ot every
shilling, the engagement of every man, and the employ-
ment of every ship which has no object but the inter-
meddling in the affairs of other countries, and endeavour-
ing to extend the boundaries of an Empire which is
already large enough to satisfy the greatest ambition, and,
I fear, is much too large for the highest statesmanship to
which any man has yet attained.
Surely Mr. Perry will at once have these passages
expunged from books placed in the hands of im-
pressionable pupils!
Kingston returns to find himself the most
interesting figure in S.A. politics, although tem-
porarily out of the Legislature. The question
with local politicians is as to his future move-
ments. When the pressmen stormed the boat at
Largs Bay their first question was on that subject,
but the ex-Premier smiled and kept silent. At
the reception in Adelaide the audience laughed
when Chaffey Baker tried to “pull his leg,” by
picturing what a loss it would be to Australia if
Kingston remained in parish politics. But the
ex-Premier remained “ a sealed oyster.”
The Breelong murderers will probably be
responsible for the cutting-out of many of the
aboriginal names of N.S.W. Federal divisions.
Lots of people, just now, regard the race of the
woman-slaying .Jimmy and Joe Governor as on a
par with the mutilating Chows. Certainly some
of the names introduced by the Commissioners
should be rejected in favor of more compact and
euphonious native appellations. Why, for in-
stance, was “Araluen” omitted? The State
(N.S.W.) constituencies, aboriginally named, are
well-godfathered—Bingara, Narrabri, Warringah,
Wilcannia, Gundagai, Illawarra, Woollahra and
Gunnedah, for instance.
The great downfall of the Parochial crowd
in Westralia was a shock of no ordinary dimen-
sions to the local National Ass—a body which was
wrong, as usual, in the first half of its nau e, but
which struck a very solemn fact in the second.
The Parochial Mule threw money about lavishly
in anti-Bill organisation, and through meeting
itself frequently in the streets really got to believe-
that it constituted a majority, it was like the
stage army, where eight men swell up to great
numbers by walking persistently round one piece
of scenery. And when it was beaten at the polls
by more than two to one it dried its eyeS piteously
on its ears and went home.
It is announced with all seriousness by
sundry M.L. papers that the proposed new Maori-
land National Option law is to work thus : Only
two questions are to be submitted—continuance of
license as at present, or no license at all. If three-
fifths of the votes are cast for “no license,”
licenses will be abolished, and if two-thirds of the
votes are cast for “continuance,” things will
remain as they are. This sounds like a wild joke.
If there are only two issues and it takes 600 votes
out of 1000 to carry “no license,” then 401 votes out.
of 1000 will carry the other thing, and what’s the
good of specifying that it will take 666 votes to
carry the other thing ? Somebody is badly mixed.
Q. Worker supplies details of the syndi-
cate railways, which the Philp gang is endeavour-
ing to press through Parliament: —
Each bill provide that the syndicate may construct
branch lines as it pleases, with a maximum length
of 10 to 26 miles. Each syndicate has the right to
eharge up to 150 per cent, more than the State
lines for ordinary freight and passengers. Each
syndicate gets large areas of mineral lands for 50
years. There is no minimum-wage clause. No
guarantee that the lines will not be jerry-built to
serve the syndicate ends and no others. No
royalty payable to Govt, after a fair profit is made.


Text of the U.S. Democratic party’s plat-
form on the Boer business, on which W. J. Bryan
stands for President:
Believing in the principles of self-government, and re-
jecting, as did our forefathers, the claims of monarchy,
we view with indignatio ■ the purpose of England to over-
whelm with force the South African Republics. Speak-
ing, as we believe, for the entire American nation, except
its Republican office-holders, and for all free men every-
where, we extend our sympathies to the heroic burghers
in their unequal struggle to maintain their libertv and
independence.
Bryan may not win—he probably will not—but
the fact that one of the two great parties in the
U.S. (rpeaning millions of. men) has adopted that
shows how much the Jingo cables to the Austra-
lian, papers about “universal American sym-
pathy” and “the Anglo-Saxon alliance” are
worth.

29 Havelock-street, Ballarat, 9th June, 1899.
Mr. S. A. Palmer,
Dear Sir, —For the sake of other sufferers, I feel it to be
my duty to state what VITADATIO has done for me.
About three years ago I was seized with BLEEDING ‘
OF THE LUNGS, which continued at intervals for two
years, by which time I was iso bad that • my' medical
adviser, A COLLINS STREET MELBOURNE DOCTOR,
recommended me, to go to the “ Sanitorium ,for Con-
sumptives,” at Echuca, which I did,, and remained there
for three months. I gradually got worse, until my weight
was only Bst. 21b. , . ;, . ; .
At this time my sister, Mrs. Taylor, advised me to try
a course of VITADATIO. I took one bbttle, and on
account of it causing me to feel w'orse I discontinued
taking it, and on my return to Ballarat from Echuca I
was ur d to again try it, which I did, with the result
that afoer TAKING NINE BOTTLES I had so gained in
weight that I NOW WEIGH list. 41b., and can honestly
say that I am now quite strong and well, and never felt
better than I do now.—Yours very faithfully,
S. SAUNDERS.
Mr. S. A. Palmer. 31 Havelock-street, Ballarat.
The above testimonial by Mr. Saunders is the plain, un-
varnished truth. He came here to Ballarat apparently
IN THE LAST STAGE OF CONSUMPTION, and he is now
strong and well.

Mr. W. LAKE, Student, Hobart— “ By its aid I can
now do with ease and certainty that which was almost
impossible. I find it a WONDERFUL HELP in learning
languages.”
. Mr. A. H. Brown, Constitution Hill, Tas.—“ History
with its dates was always my dread in exams., but by
your system I have gained 92 per cent, of the possible in
it. I also used it in geography, Latin, &c., with equally
good results. It is easily learned, and cannot be for-
gotten.”
Rev, W. E. BROMILOW, New Britain.—“ It has greatly
strengthened my natural memory. By it I learnt the
almanac for the year in about two minutes, and can give
instantly .the day of any date, and vice versa. Its use
must be of great assistance to students.”

The First Federal Premier.
There are two fallacious ideas abroad just now in
N.S.W. with regard to the first Federal Premier.
No. 1 is that the matter is all cut and dried
between Chamberlain and Hopetoun ; that who-
ever is to be appointed has already been fixed
upon, and that Australians have only to meekly
accept the Chamberlain-Hopetoun nominee, just
as they do their Governors, without protest. No.
2 idea, equally fallacious, is that the first Premier
of the Commonwealth will, as a matter of right, be
the gentleman who accidentally happens to be at
the head of affairs in N.S. W., which State is
considered to be entitled to this distinction by
virtue of the fact that it was the first settled
(never mind how); that it has more hard-shelled
anti-Federalists to the square mile than any other
State, and made the bitterest fight against having
any Commonwealth at all for a first Premier to
govern. As a matter of hard fact the appoint-
ment of the first Federal Premier is not subject
to the caprice of a gentleman running a State
Department 16,000 miles away, nor does it
depend upon the age, importance, or position of
any particular State. As in State politics,
the man to be “sent for” to form the first
Federal ministry ought to be the man who
is capable, first, of securing the confidence of
the majority of the electors of the whole Com-
monwealth, and, secondly, of getting the best men
to serve under him. Whoever may be the first
man sent, for, if he cannot command the confidence
of the majority within and without the Federal
Parliament, he will have to stand down. Now,
the most sanguine Geebung can hardly hope that
the mediocre Lyne would be able to get men like
Barton, Kingston, Reid, O’Connor, M'Millan,
Turner, Deakin, Isaacs, Gordon, Symon, Hol-
der, or Braddon to serve under him ; and if they
are not with him they would probably be against
him, and would incontinently eject him from
office. Further, Lyne would hardly get the suf-
frages of the majority of the electors of the Com-
monwealth, including the electors of Victoria,
S ; A- and Tas. in view of his association with the
gibes about wolves and thieves,” “bounties,”
“Victorian gold,” the-- “attempt to steal our
(N.S.W,) rivers,” and the “ Tasmanian army of
14 men,” which were reasons advanced by the Gee-
bung crowd (which Lyne was with, but not of)
why N.S.W. should not join the Federation. Then,
on principle, the continent would revolt against the
claim of N.S.W. as of prescriptive right, apart
from merit, to have the first Federal Premier.
The claim of the most populous State to
supply the Premier because it is the most
populous State is just as good as the claim
of the most populous city or the most
populous electorate. The claim of the oldest
State, because it is the oldest, is just as good as
the claim of the largest State, or the driest, or the
wettest, or the least-indebted, or the youngest.
And the claim of the Premier of the oldest State
should be judged solely by the claimant’s merit®,'
just as the claim of the oldest inhabitant would
be. It should be a question of finding the man
who is likely to do the best .work for Australia,
and every other consideration should be dropped.
N.S.W., because it has the largest population,
has more to lose than any other province by put-
ting its own local failure into Federal office merely
because he is local. For that matter, neither the
Scotchman Reid nor the Tasmanian Lyne is local.

' ' we mean it, for it is a fact that
thousands of cures have been accomplished by Dr.

the past twenty-five years. There is nothing else like it
on earth ! It does the work! Have received so mam
letters and testimonials that we hardly know what to do
with them all. If ruptured investigate at once. Our
prices are reasonable, but not cheap. We make no dis
counts. “ Dr. Pierce’s ” is THE Truss, and you cannot
be happy till you get it.

. AND
THE AGED.
A Public Institution.
“C.C.” describes a Paddington (Sydney) State
institution: —
Ormond House, depfit for children, had a gratifying
sound of mystery about it which tempted my journalistic
footsteps thitherwards one sloppy afternoon. Ormond
House is what may be called a transition ’Ome, Sweet
’Ome for the State child. When a boardad-out child gets
the sack, owing to arriving at the unfortunate age of 12
(when board-money ceases) it is shunted back to the
depot, till in due course of time it gets over its infirmity
and is ready for the laboar m irket once more.
The old lady who superintends these youthful derelicts
was anxious to show me the various bundles and hat-
boxes all ready packed and corded, so that the family
which suddenly discovered its need for a slavey of 13
might not require to wait a moment more than necessary
to be put in possession of the property. After investi-
gating bales of blue frocks and other interesting ware, I
inquired where the live stock were penned. When the
remark had been duly translated, the old lady escorted
me down a flight of steps at the back which led to an
open courtyard. A loud noise issued from a door which
burst open as a crowd of boys of all ages up to 15, or per-
haps more, ran into the yard. I waited modestly till
these specimens of the superior sex had vanished to a
distant corner of the yard, and then entered at the door
from which they had issued. The room was half play-
room half kitchen, rather dim as regards natural
light, but enlivened by a cheerful fire, before which the
State property was sitting, knitting, sewing or conversing.
I patted the girls on the head, and hoped they were good
girls, and did the correct thing generally, after which
we proceeded to business. The army of the ex-boarded-
out were not at all Institution.v in their behaviour. They
had a refreshing habit of leaving out the “ mum ” and the
curtsey, and altogether ignoring the catechism-rule about
ordering themselves lowly and reverently before their
betters. They spoke as if they had as much right to be
alive as “ proper sort of children.” It was grim enough
to hear some dozen under-sized little girls regarding
themselves as among the world’s workers, not players,
but it was pleasing to reflect that none of them seemed to
have a proper sense of the lowliness of their position. A
dep6t, by the way, should keep children for a few days
at most, but many of the Ormond House girls stay there
for weeks—even months. There is no school at Ormond
House, so that when the young ex-boarded-out one has
helped in the ordinary housework—which is not much—
she has nothing else to do. Underordinarv circumstances,
there is nothing particularly wrong in this fact. Unfor-
tunately, it has this effect, that when the youngster goes
•forth to be boarded-out once more—this time as a slavey—
she finds housework plus education rather too much of a
change. Therefore, to get sent back to the dep6t, which
she knew must take her, she not unfrequently makes war
upon china so successfully that the missus is only too glad
to tell the Inspector that Olyra doesn’t suit. Sometimes
the Inspector remonstrates with Clyra, and-Olyra, who
has studied the pamphlet re the laws affecting State
children (said pamphlet having been packed along with
her belongings for the benefit of her new mistress), is able
to tell him that the State is her father and her mother,
and that he (the Inspector) is merely her paid
servant. Then the china-smasher goes gleefully back to
have another holiday, till someone else expresses
a desire for a household treasure. IftheN.S.VV. board-
ing-out system is to be retained, one reform is necessary.
Board money should not cease as early as the age of 12,
as the child has still two years of school life before her,
and the person who thinks a 12-vear-old child should pay
for her keep by continual floor-scrubbing is a Boer and a
Boxer, a Paul Kruger and the Empress of China rolled
into one. The State shouldn’t send its waifs out as ser-
vants till they are 15. Then it should take some measures
with'the maiden who smashes her mistress’s crockery in
order to get sent hack to the ’Ome. In one place, which
I won’t particularise, the State’s returned girl is always
thrashed on re-admittance, no matter for what cause she
is sent back. It is done on general principles to inspire
her with a desire to strike out for herself. I don’t ap-
prove of this. I think if she was set to wash clothes or
beheaded it would be quite sufficient. I wouldn't have
her excessively beheaded—only beheaded in moderation.
“ F.” : Recently heard a Caledonian des-
canting upon the merits of his dog ; and, after he
had repeated about a dozen times that the brute
was “ hauf Scoatch collie, ye ken,” one of us said,
“ Well, and what’s the other half? ” “ Eh, mon ”
—and the dog-owner scratched his head —“ Weel,

“ Hermes ’’ interviews a semi-Chinaman :
Among the low company I sometimes keep is a well-
educated and much-travelled half-caste Chow spieler,
: who, when he is not, spieling, is a very decent fellow, and
•would make a first-class newspaper man. The upheaval
in the Flowery Land caused him to talk a lot the other
evening. Said he, in almost as many words : “ Sup-
posing'you Australians (who, by the way, are the biggest
mugs in creation from a 1 magsman’s’ point of view) had,
during the life of Queen Victoria, seen the whole of the
Northern Territory seized in time of peace by Russia, as
the Chinese have seen the Amur provinces, and that later
on the same greedy robber had proceeded to eat up the
North Queensland region as she has Manchuria, and then
because a push killed a German—which they have
done before now—Kaiser William waded in and stole
Cairns and a good slice of eastern Queensland, and the
Russians thereupon declared they must be compensated
by taking Rockhampton, and the French, to preserve the
« balance of. power,’ promptly stole Gippsland, and the
Japanese wanted to be compensated with the gift of New-
castle and the surrounding country, and then the Boers
had sailed in on general principles with a modest
demand for a ‘ sphere of influence’ around and including
Wollongong and the coast down to Gabo as Italy
did. Just imagine all that, and then in addition, while
you were talking horse, a piebald crowd of engineers
started laying down i a.l ways and telegraphs, which you
were to be compelled to use, while all the profits went to
a foreign—say Dutch—gang of robbers —-how would
your pushes deal with any isolated parties of those
foreign devils ? Would they respect the women and chil-
dren t Rats ! Mt. Rennie and Gaoton. and a few other
horrors, would be completely plunged into darkness by
comparison with the things that some of the nice Christian
larrikins wou.d do ; and all your respectable gentlemen
of influence and standing would excuse it on the ground
of “misguided patriotism ” once the fat was in the fire.
A good many of them would applaud it and say it was the
way to put' the fear of God into them. Look at the
caoled speech of the Kaiser—wouldn’t he make a nice
companion for the savage Tuan, who is anxious to hive
his palace carpeted throughout with the skins of the
foreign devils, or a first-ciass boss for a Miller’s Point
push f No, old man, I’m inclined to think if you had
been treated as the Chinese have you’d be just as un-
civilised.

Mrs. S. Gardiner, of 70 Green-street, Rich-

have suffered from biliousness, sick headache
and morning nausea, and for which complaints
I have tried many patent remedies, .and had

few doses the nausea fled, and the headaches dis-
appeared ; after taking one bottle and a half I
felt quite well again. I may also state that my
son, aged eighteen, who has suffered since child-
hood from urinary troubles, has been taking the
Pills, and he has derived more benefit from their
use' than from any other remedy he has tried, He
was operated upon at one of our public hospitals,

The Australian kookaburra is the most amusing ; while the bower-birds are ner'

SPORTING NOTIONS
ri s ,^ issi5 '’ ranner-up to Hymettus in the ’9B
Cup, won a six-furlong flutter at Flemington
last Saturday, and promises to be busy in the spring if
his legs hold good. Also, Lancaster (not fancied by pre-
sent scribe for Melb. Cup) showed his heels to a field of
commoners, including non-triers, and among other inci-
dents of a damp day’s sport, Mysore ran off at the first
!f nc , e *“ the August Steeplechase. It’s about time that
the Manifolds gave Mysore a long rest, or half-a-bottle of
brandy before going teethe post, or something.
Most promising nag at Moorfield, Saturday, was
Lady Stuart, who got away with Kogarah Stakes and
Welter Handicap (each 6 fur.). Crack rider Steve Callinan
was up both times. Lady Stuart was bred by her owner,
Mr. H. O. White, and is by Clan Stuart (same sire as
Georgic, now at Ome) from Mira by Monmouth from dam
of Mirzapore, who was dam of Georgic. She is nicely
shaped, and built to carry weight, and, if appearances
count, should be heard from often when a bit further
advanced.

“ Via” : Why not Gauleon for Caulfield ? Bred
to stay and his father’s sons improve with a year or two.
Last year I fancied him, he ran second. Anyhow he will"
be ‘dead on it” for the sake of Oxy’s “double book"
and coupled with the best three-year-old (whichever that
is) it seems at least a fair chance.
* * * •
_Noticeable that the Wilson stable has entered
Nitre for Melb. Cup only this year, avoiding Caulfield.
Last year it did the same with Merriwee.

Recently W. A. Long wrote to the Austra-
lasian complaining of slovenly handicapping and men-
tmnmg various animals as likely winners (Prince Carbine
and Cya,mde for Metropolitan, Mora and the Chief for
Caulfield, La Carabine for Melb. Cup) Is this the straight
tip from the king of the A.J.C., or a “ keep-off-the-grass ”
notice as regards his own particular bit of horseflesh!
Sweet William ” dearly loves to rake it in at 100 to 3 or
thereabouts...

A pleasing little swindle coming into vogue at
pony races consists in changing positions at the post:
the place of the animal drawing No. 1 being generally
occupied by a moke which has drawn an outside place
and which happens to be “on the job.” The modus is
that all the competitors take their correct positions when
first assembling, and then the non-trier slips from next
the rails into the centre of the field, the attention of the
starter being meanwhile engaged by a wilful “ playing-
up ’ of other competitors who are likewise not “ on the
job.”

In the days of the old Island Bay Racing Club
of Wellington (M.L.), they used to have an open hack race
for visitors, which was once won by one of a pair of car-
riage-horses belonging to a well-to-do person, who was
picnicking with his family near by. The coachman sur-
reptitiously entered the moke in his own name, and after
winning, coolly slipped the horse back to the carriage and
drove home.

Volume 10 of Millers Australian Racing
Chronicle is to hand. It gives complete records of 760
race-meetings held in Australia and Tas. during the half-
year ended July 31st, and is in all respects as valuable as
the nine volumes that have preceded it. - In so far that it
may tend to restrain uninformed punters from backing
very bad tips, The Bulletin commends the A.R. Chronicle
to their serious consideration.
The famous high-jumper, Fairfield, has been

Dear Bulletin.— Re purchase of army remounts
in Australia. A horse-breeding friend of mine on the
Hunter assures me that a horse he had previously known
for over 20 years was thus bought at a good price. Such
judgment is hardly, likely to gain for our horses the repu-
tation they deserve. Also, another friend of mine, who
was offered the charge of a shipment of horses for China
was satisfactorily tested as to his veterinary knowledge*
and was then offered £8 for, the trip ! To China and back’
taking all risks, for eight whole pounds !—with a bonus of
£5 more if all the horses were landed safely. This pur-
chasing and shipping of horses badly wants some light
let m upon it. H.S.

Cabled last week that Mr. Spencer Gollan (well-
known M L. breeder and sport, who, last year, bought
the crack Australian Star from Kogarah, Sydney, trainer
“ Andy” Gollan, and took him ’Ome) had won the big
golfing event—Calcutta Cup—played for at St. Andrew'’!
(Eng.). Mr. Gollan was always a fine golfer, and did some
great things in M.L. as well as at ’Ome a few years ago
Previous year’s winner of the coveted prize was late Lt
Tait (erstwhile Supt. of gymnasia in Scotland), whose dead
body was found near Cronje’s Magersfontein trench
(among others of the “Gordons”). He was previously
badly wounded, and had only come out of hospital a dav
or two before.

Coursing for most money (£2OO aside) put up in
Australia since the Hons. Geo. and Edw'ard Lee (Bath-

ardent enthusiasts, took place at Adelaide, Friday Com-
peting hounds were S.A. dog—The Grafter—and Vic
dog—Confident. Conditions called for best two of three
courses. The Grafter led up in both, winning first by 3
and second by 5,V points. Match was the outcome of an
alleged faulty slip when same pair met in a course at
Adelaide a few months back. Writer saw Confident over
herein big N.S. W. Challenge Stakes and didn’t think him
far above the ordinary. Can only account for match being
made, by the probability that owner (Mr. Kenyon)
entertained a poor opinion of t’other dog.

“ Leash ” : Ways 'of bourSing'officials are often
peculiar. Belmore (Sydney) Coursing Park syndicate
last Saturday put on an event for dogs that had never
won a stake. .One,.Larry-, was protested, against because
he shared in divisions of winning money at Rooty Hill
and Orange-recently. Stewards met, and, being unable
to agree whether - sharing was winning or otherwise
relegated the matter to the N.C.A. council. Meantime
Larry was allowed to go on and win stake and bets,,
which, of course, was all those behind him were after :
troubles- how the governing body’s wiseacres de-
cide now-. Matter was as simple as ABC, and should
ha\ e been settled without a moment’s thought. Might
as well contend that if two horses run a dead-heat and
divide, neither wins- and yet both do. Somethin-
equaliy absurd occurred at Association meeting at Rooty
Hill last week. Barb ran under wrong collar against
Beauchamp. Latter (a hot favorite) won, but all bets
were declared off. Why ? Punters put their money on
Beauchamp and Barb, not red or white collars.

Details of English championships, contested
June 7, are to hand. Yankees —an route to Olympian
games at Paris—annexed 8 out of 13 premierships. Aus-
tralasian sprint-champion Stan. Rowley was fourth to
Murikans ” Duffy, Jarvis, and Tewksbury as named
in final of 100yds. Winner’s time was lOsec. Rowley
had previously equalled this in England, but he got
badly away ; otherwise, ’tis said, Duffy would have been
closely pushed. Kraenzlein’s hurdling was an eye-
Opener; though not in best form, he got over 120yds.
and cleared 10 flights in 15.2-5.
Country bruisers M'Coll (Armidale) and Arthurs
(Wyalong) had a rough turn-up at Metrop. A.C. (Syd-
ney) last week. Both scale over 12st., and are as tough,
strong, and gritty as can be, but neither knows the rudi-
ments of the game. They simply stood up and banged,
bashed, ’rastled and wrenched like men possessed. Each
aimed at nothing but hit out hard and often.
Whether punches were expended in the air mattered
little to them so long as they kept going. Arms flew
about like flails, and sometimes legs got twisted in a
marvellous fashion while the crowd (not Very big) roared
itself hoarse. At the end of fourth round'the “Wipe”
was skied in Arthurs’ corner owing, ’twas said, to his
right hand having been badly maimed. M'Coll says he
never had a lesson in his life—a statement that his
methods fully endorse. Further information conveyed
by the Armidale man (who was never in Sydney or any
other city as big before) is that he only came down to see
if there was anything in the game, and if there isn’t he
can easily “ return to the pick and shovel.” There’s
nothing like having something to fall back upon ; the
pug. game is a precarious one always—especially for the
rough-and-tumble section of its exponents.

Golden Gate club room (Sydney) hasn’t been so
densely packed as on Saturday night for a long time. Ic
was one big mass of man wedged and jammed alongside,
on top of (almost), and underneath each other’s feet.
Frost and “Monty” Andrews were the draw, and theirs
was the hottest and most bitter fight for the first five
rounds writer has ever looked at. Then it slackened off
till it dragged wearily near the end agreed upon, 20
rounds. Frost got the decision, and earned it well.

Peter Murphy and Jack M’Gowan didn’t waste
much time clinching matters for Australian light-weight
supremacy. Agreement signed in Melb. last week and
fight fixed for Oct. 13 (Caulfield “ Guineas ” night). Con-
ditions—2s rounds, and if referee cannot name the better
nian then three rounds more are to be fought, and so on
until one or other holds a pronounced advantage. Which,
of course, means that the affair is to a finish—as it should
be where championships are concerned.

Ed. Bulletin.—Seems that a lot of would-be
authorities are prejudiced against Mick Dunn—why, I
cannot imagine ; unless it is because he is too well-
behaved and unassuming. “Uppercut” displays his
ignorance both of boxing and of Dunn's abilities I
might mention for his benefit, that the short, quick jab
well timed by a scientific boxer, is more effectual than the
wildly-swung “ bash,” which rarely reaches a vulnerable
part, and often leaves the aggressor unguarded. The
greatest exponents of this quick, half-arm blow are
Corbett, Fitzsimmons, Jackson, Griffo and Dunn. Wild
erratic fighters are amusing, and.probably interesting to
such as “ Uppercut.” He Dunn’s hitting power—when I
saw Conlon 21 hours after his defeat, his nose was still
bleeding, the result of one of Dunn’s “pats.” Walcot
was incapacitated for two or three da vs after his fight with
this gentle Dunn—l have N.Y. World with account of

out of the fight is contemptible, “ Uppercut ” can find in-

Satisfactory to know that good old Harry Trott
is about in the world again with a level head (like his old
friend and antagonist little Johnny Briggs, the Britisher)
but very. unsatisfactory to hear of the circumstances
under Which the onetime “ popular captain of the Aus-
tralian Eleven ” was allowed to make his re-appearance
in public. It should have been the business of many
professed patrons of cricket to keep themselves informed
of Harry Trott’s condition when he was away in retire-
ment. If his own cricket club (the South Melbourne)
didn’t give a constant thought to his case the M.C.C.
might at least have been expected to know something of
the health, prospects and necessities of this very repre-
sentative cricketer. But seemingly the hospital authori-
ties had no sort of Trott Fund to draw upon. The
moneyed supporters, individual and collective of the
fashionable game had forgotten “ dear old Harry.” His
recovery was not a matter in which they were interested
and he came back to life, as it were, in a pair of worn-out
boots. That’s a fact. The patient’s first trouble after
quitting the hospital was to get himself decently shod.

a Todgers’ boarding-house, is more than prob-
able. All the same he returns £450 of his own
allowance of £IOOO. Therefore Deakin poses pub-
licly as a man who has sacrificed £950 in cash and
half-a-year’s professional income in his country’s
cause, and in so doing he makes things very
unpleasant for other delegates who haven’t £950
to throw away. Even if they get £ISOO they lose
half-a-year’s professional earnings, and on top of
that they are looked at askance as grasping indi-
viduals who didn’t act like the noble and glorious
Deakin. Why didn’t the virtuous Alfred give
his £450 anonymously to the hospital ?
The Chief Inspector under Queensland’s
Factories Act, in his annual report, tells a hideous
tale bf ; sweating, misery, neglect, insanitary con-
ditions, and other horrors. Then he adds this
remarkable statement :
What should be done to remedy flagrant cases of viola-
tion of the principles of sanitation and decency is quite
manifest. . . but the sections are framed so jealously to
guard the liberty and independence of the subject
as to make successful prosecution thereunder an ex-
tremely doubtful consummation.
Observe, the clauses are framed most carefully to
guard the liberty of the boss subject to keep his
workrooms filthy and unwholesome. The liberty
of the much more numerous employe subject to
pursue his or her calling without being killed or
injured by the boss’s filthiness isn’t guarded at all.
There isn’t another phrase in the English language
that covers more shameful tyranny than that
beautiful hypocrisy about “ the liberty of the.
subject.”
The elaborate official reports which N.S. W.
Government receives daily re the pursuit of the
Breelong blackfellows show immense returns of
“energy displayed” and “steps taken” and
“excellent work done’’—but, for so far, not a
penn’orth of practical result. The fugitives, to all
appearance, are, at time of writing, no nearer
capture than ever they were.
Sydney Telegraph, in its leading article
of last Tuesday, propounded a most remarkable
scheme, wvhereby N.S.W. is to make a separate
profit for itself at the expense of the Common-
wealth. It proposes that the Federal Government
shall be sole ground landlord in the Federal terri-
tory, in order to secure for the people the in-
creased land-values created by the expenditure of
the people’s-money on a Federal capital; It
points out also that if the Federal territory covers
only 100 square miles, even though the Common-
wealth owns everything within it, much of the
increase of land values created by Federal expen-
diture will extend outside its borders, and this is
liable to be snatched by private landlords.* So
far the Telegraph is merely repeating The Bul-
letin’s leading article of August 4. And then it
goes on to declare that the Federal territory is
limited to 100 square miles, so the best thing for
N.S.W. to do is to pass a State law empowering
the N.S.W. Govt, to compulsorily repurchase a
great area of land around the Federal 100 square
miles, so that the increased value created there by
the expenditure of the money of all Australia will
go into the separate Treasury of N.S.W. ! There
is just one difficulty in the way of this proposed
grab. The Federal territory is not limited to 100
square miles; it is to be not less than 100, but it
may be 5000 or any other amount over 100. And
if'thfe Federal Parliament has any sense of the
value of a great opportunity it will take over 5000
square miles and put the capital in the centre of
it, and then this insolent scheme for enriching one
State at -the expense of the other five will break
off short, carrot-fashion. Meanwhile the Tele-
graph, is doing its best to advertise N.S.W. as a
State that is. already devising schemes to loot
its Federal brethren —which is so very like the
Telegraph. :* ■ ■' '
A correspondent of Sydney D.T. declares,
that though he, for one, had intended to keep on
subscribing to the Patriotic Fund, he will now
hold his hand in view of the possible allotment of
portion of said fund to the uses of relatives of the
contingenteers for China. “ We know what we
are fighting for in S’Africa,” it is pointed out,
“but he would be a clever prophet who could tell us
what we are fighting for in China; and we might
as well swell the future beneficiaries of the fund
by sending troops to Ashantee.” Even Jingoism
is not illimitable !
Q. clergy are again thundering against
the godless secular school. It is undoubted, they
allege, that the increase in immorality in the
country is due to the absence of Bible teaching in
the State schools. Two of the parsons in Bris-
bane at present loudest in their denunciations
against the secular system are visitors from Scot-
land. Can these rev. gentlemen explain how it is
that Scotland, which has always been so eminently
godly in church and school, should also be so very
much to the fore in the illegitimacy business ?
A story which reads like a bit (tut of a
Family Novelette is relieving the drab monotony
of existence in Maoriland. About three months
ago a Christchurch doctor received a type-written
letter, asking his lowest charge for poisoning a
lady, and suggesting £200 as a fair thing. The
letter was submitted to the police, who decided
that it was intended as a burst of humour. Later
on, another type-written letter came along to the
same effect, and asking the doctor, if he meant
business, to signify the fact by advertising for
a dog-cart. He began to grow interested and
advertised for a dog-cart. The understanding
appears to have been that the lady, whose
description was given, would come in the doctor’s
way by arrangement of the writer, whoever he
might be, and that when she was sufficiently dead
the" £200 would arrive by post or in some other non-
committal fashion. Soon after the doctor’s
public craving for a dog-cart, a Mrs. S. called on
him, for medical treatment, and he noted the fact
that she answered the description of the lady who
was to be removed. He didn’t remove her, but
lay low and waited developments. By-and-bye a
typewritten postcard arrived drawing the medico’s
attention, in veiled words, to the fact that if
“Mrs. S.” wasn’t murdered more promptly
the writer would be reluctantly compelled
to butcher her himself. Then the police
woke up and proceeded to show as much
intelligence as could be expected considering the
pay they receive. An expert decided that the
letters had been written on an old No. 3 Reming-
ton machine, and there being very few old No. 3
Remingtons in Christchurch they were soon run
to earth and examined. One was found in the
office where Mr. S. was employed, and deep re-
search proved, or is alleged to have proved, that
it was crippled in various places just where the
machine on which the letters were written had
been crippled. Thereupon the force arrested Mr.
S. in a large, public fashion at a football match.
Evidently the case will turn a good deal on the
questions : Did Mr. S. urge Mrs. S. in any un-
usual fashion to consult the doctor who had been
advertising for the dog-cart ? Or did someone else
urge her to do it ? Or did she, of her own free
will, suddenly constitute herself for the first time
the patient of this particular doctor ? Or
was he her regular doctor, and known as
such, so that he would be naturally and
reasonably the man she would consult,
quite irrespective of any communications about a
dog-cart? In either of the first two cases, the
person who urged the lady to consult this parti-
cular doctor should explain. In the third case,
the lady should explain. In the fourth, it might
possibly be interesting to know what kind of
pennyrshockers the office-boy has been reading
lately.

OBJECT OF THIS PRESENT ISSUE OF SHARES. *
The Shares now offered to the public are for the purpose of providing the necessary capital to
develop the numerous lodes proved on the property.
It is fully anticipated that the net proceeds obtained from the sale of these shares will be ample
to put the Company on the dividend list, as the money derived will be all available for the purpose of
development of the lodes and further opening up of the mine, the main shaft being sunk and six lodes
already discovered on the property. A powerful pumping and winding plant is erected and in thorough
working order, also an up-to-date concentrating plant, ore sheds, railway connecting with the Western
Co’s line to Zeehan, manager’s house, workmen’s cottages, and all accessories of a well-appointed mine,
all erected and paid for and in thorough working order, the total cost of same being over £17,000, so
that the mine is now brought up to that stage when there is no need of further expenditure other than
that in further prospecting and developing the lodes proved on the mine, and it is considered that an
expenditure of from £2OOO to £3OOO will put the Company on the dividend list.
The property is reported on in the highest terms by Captain A. Paul, late Mine Manager of the
North Broken Hill Mine, Mr. P. G. Morris, for 7 years principal underground Manager of the
Western Silver Mine, and Mr. J, G. Nash, for ,16 years Mining Inspector for the Argus and the
Australasian.

J. F. McOERMOTT & COMPANY,
37 Market-street, Sydney, N.S.W.
It must have been uncomfortable for
Barton to hear Yic. Treasurer Shiels in his budget
speech harping on the magnanimity of Deakin’s
refund of £450 out of his £IOOO for expenses as
Federal delegate. Barton, who occupied a seat
on the floor of the House, appeared unconscious of
Shiels’ remarks and was deeply interested in a
number of printed documents until the Treasurer
changed the subject.
One of the most audacious and transparent
moves of the Lyne Ministry is the referring to
N.S.W. Public Works Committee of the proposal
to spend £70,000 —seventy thousand pounds I—(loan-
money, of course) on anew library for Sydney
University. This, despite the long-standing and
desperate necessity for anew Public-lAhraxy
building in Sydney. The genesis of this pretty
piece of business is, of course, the Ministers’heart-
felt desire to keep sweet with University-Chan-
cellor M‘Laurin, the real arbiter of their destinies
in the Upper House.
Gaffney, M.H.R., lately proposed in Tas.
Assembly that members’ salaries should be raised
to £2OO a year, and that they should give up their
right of sending letters and telegrams free. Re-
jected by 20 votes to 7 —which was intensely
foolish, for, next year the Federal Postmaster-
General will abolish the free postage and telegram
swindle without raising members’ salaries a cent.
And if the State Parliament has just been pro-
rogued when he does it, it may be six months after
this loss has fallen upon them before members can
get together to raise their salaries.
The glorious news has transpired, in the
course of the N.S.W. military inquiry, that
Major-General French wired to the Imperial
authorities offering, on his own responsibility, 2000
Australian troops for foreign war service. The un-
speakable front of this uniformed personage
in thus jumping the functions of the Legislature
and setting himself up as the autocrat and the
Czar of Australia is too large for expression in
words, and there is no sack peremptory enough to
meet the case. What is N.S.W. going to do with
Major - General French who, by the way,
has the nerve to object to a Parliamentary
committee inquiring into his doings in this mat-
ter ? The military figurehead evidently thinks he
is superior to Parliament.
The allies having got to Pekin and found
the members of the foreign legations safe, all
those picturesque stories about how the white
barbarians at Pekin were slain to the last man
(after having first killed their wives and children,
to prevent these latter from falling into the hands
of the Chinese), are now to be put in the same
catalogue as the romantic stories re the impreg-
nable defences of Magersfontein (which really
consisted of one trench, in easy country, with a
wire fence in front of it), and the unblushing
yarns about Barnum-Powell’s defence of Mafeking.
Russia now seems inclined to withdraw from
operations in Southern China, and to lay severely
to her own book up North. In South Africa,
Lord Roberts finds it necessary to proclaim that,
in future, all burghers who break their oath of
neutrality are to be severely dealt with—which is
exactly what might have been expected to occur,
inasmuch as few men in any conquered country
ever respect a practically forced oath when they
see an opportunity of breaking it. The Boer war
has now dwindled down to small guerilla opera-
tions. It is cabled that over 100 members of the
Q. contingent have joined the Transvaal police.
Maoriland Agent-General Reeves cables
his Government that the British casualties in
S’Africa up to date are : Deaths from all causes,
9300 ; prisoners in hands of enemy, 2850; invalided
home, 28,000 ; and probably from 6000 to 7000 sick
and wounded in hospital.
Victoria’s Factories Act Wages Board for
the furniture trade issued its newest regulations
last week. Journeymen’s wages Is. per hour for
a maximum of 48 hours per week, and an
additional 4d. an hour for overtime. Apprentices
55., 7s. 6d., 10s., 155., 205., and 255. per week for
each year, thereafter full wages. Improvers 55.,
10s., 17s. 6d., 225. 6d., and 305.; both these
classes getting 3d. an hour for overtime. One
apprentice and one improver allowed for every
four journeymen. Which is right up to what the
trade-unions have been fighting for for years, save
in the matter of overtime, and that is a trifle
better. And unless sweating is to flourish
unrestricted in the other provinces they must all
come into line.
Sydney Daily Telegraph's fiction laughs
at the same D.T.’s leader policy. Thus the “ Loot
of T’ien Ti Hwuy,” Ambrose Pratt’s serial story
now running in the D.T. :
What a pity it is you are not an Englishman ; then you
would see things properly without the ridiculous scruples
you have just acknowledged. Look you, when a big
civilised nation sees some small, uncivilised but rich prin-
cipality struggling along without strength sufficient to
protect itself, what does she do ? Does she pass by and
leave the plum hanging on the tree ? No. If she is strong
enough she annexes it, and the act is not called theft.

I am able to bear out much of the worst that Mr. Bur-
dett-Coutts has written. . . . There were 2510 enteric
patients when I left them, and they were in a large pro-
portion left to lie on the ground arid he nursed bv ignor-
ant and slovenly “ Tommy ” attendants. They lay in
water, they were rained on, and the sanitary arrange-
ments were such that at least in some hospitals' thev had
to leave their blankets at the risk of death. All the time
I was at Bloemfontein I was haunted bv the horror of the
neglect and cruelty to the sick. . . . When I was at Kim-
berley some of the local physicians were similarly horror-
stricken by the condition in which the wounded came to
them, trundled over the bad roads all the way from
Paardeberg in ox-waggons. ... I have no hesitation in
saying that I considered the treatment of the sick and
wounded (especially after the m tin advance from Modder
River) primitive, cruel, and almost barbaric, as well as
needless and inexcusable.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
__ H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Soon To Be Withdrawn.
The success with which The Times offer of the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica” has met makes it
apparent that the offer must soon be withdrawn.
Subscriptions are coming in rapidly, and it is evi-
dent that the number of sets allotted for this
colony will soon be subscribed for. Prompt action
is needful, therefore, by those intending pur-
chasers who have deferred ordering in the belief
that they can secure a set at any time. The offer
was strictly limited from the first, and the present
demand makes it apparent that the offer must
soon be withdrawn.
Cur Railways.
The railways of Victoria are under the control
of Government. Those of the old country and
some of the other colonies are worked by
companies. It is as least questionable which is
the better system. The British people reap the
benefit of the competition between rival com-
panies. The paternal Colonial Government
professes to cater for the comfort and convenience
of travellers, but this idea has not prevented the
occurrence of some discreditable jobs in the past,
and not a little mismanagement.. Railways have
been constructed through private influence, which
have proved veritable “ White Elephants ’
However, we . learn wisdom by experience. The
railway officials of Australia are, as a class, an
excellent body of men, and for civility, sobriety,
and willingness, will compare favorably with those
of other countries. They work long and ardu-
ously, and their remuneration is certainly not
excessive. Seeing the responsibility for life and
limb which some of them undertake, they should
be specially careful of their health. There are
danger signals in life besides those on the railway
lines._ Those which herald the approach of kidney
and liver diseases are often insiduous and require
to be guarded against with great vigilance.
Warner’s Safe Cure is the best safeguard against
these troubles. The Station Mister, Mr. W. C.
Cutten, of St. Kilda, Victoria, writes as follows :
“It is with much pleasure that I add my
testimony to the many others with reference to
Warner’s Safe Cure. I and my family have been
in the.habit of using it for years, whenever liver
or kidney troubles have appeared, and the result
has invariably been great relief and ultimate cure.
Were the valuable properties of this medicine
more generally known, no family would ever be
without a bottle of it in the house. It is simply a
wonderful medicine.”*

( 2i. : Concerning “Smiler” Hales’s boxing
exploits (8., 21/7/’UO). He always did fancy himself a little
that Way. At Broken Hill he had one locally-famous
midnight outing—without gloves, though, that was.
Young Everard Browne, son of “ Boldrewood,” was
reckoned a fine athlete, even for early B. Hill; and there
were some fine athletes round there then. Something
Hqles had written in the local Miner (he wrote the same
purple stuff then that he does now) offended Browne.
The two met rather late in the evening, and all local male
“ society ” Was rounded up to a convenient hall to see the
thing settled. Browne had the best of a very willing
battle, for there were heaps of pluck behind some science
in each. Police interfered ? Pooh! Those were the days
whbn Saunders, now inspector at Orange, and the most
successful police officer ever the silver-fields had, wasn’t
above entering in boxing tournaments himself; and they
didn’t always weigh the gloves either. And he could run
too—was for a time a consistent runner in local Sheffields.

After his frosty tour of Australia, John L.
Sullivan found himself in ’Frisco, with “a sou’ wester in
the cash-box,” and challenged anything with hair on for
a 4-round go. The local Dagoes had been watching fora
chance, having a huge Italian (weighing 265 t.) in
pickle, and they jumped at Sullivan’s challenge,
reckoning John a back-number. Arrangement were
promptly made for a meeting, and on the appoint ght
—the stakes (pretty heavy) being up—John, fu. old
rve, wobbled into the ring, before a packed house, two-
thirds of which were Dagoes. In came the 3651 b. Dago—
a monstrous muscular mass of humanity, with a coat of
thick black hair from head to heel. “ Oh, h !” said
'John, “ they’ve brought a bear against me.” Time was
called, the pair shaped up, and Parsimino led with a
terrific sling, but John side-stepped, swung his mighty
right fair on the “point,” and down went the hope of
Italy. When it had been brought-to and was asked if it
wanted to go on, it remarked, “Oh, my jawa 1 Why he

“ Old-Timer I’m with “ Alex. M.” (Bulle-
tin,” 28/7/’00) re Corbett’s methods—provided he owned
the necessary punching power ; but boxers of the extra-
clever type don’t possess that com-
modity to any great extent. Griffo
never had it, neither did Jacksou
“ Gentleman” George Dawson, nor
Mick Dooley, though the last three
were much better equipped than
the first named. All were jabbers ;
they believed in watching for open-
ings and taking no chances in the
way of returns. The right never
shot out on its mission unless the
enemy’s right was pretty safe.
There was no fluke about any
knock-outs scored by these men—
they were invariably intended for
the spot they brought up against.
No clever boxer would mooch,
crouch or slink round after a knock-
out—he’d simply si and square on
and watch, albeit punishing in the
ribs and on the “ mark ” or else-
where as opportunity occurred.
Pugs. gei#rally appear to think a
knock-out can only be scored by a
blow on either side of the point.

left jab dead on the point. Apropos

A case which will tend
to further encourage dishonest
wagerers and to put stakeholders strictly upon their
guard was decided lately by the English Court of
Appeal. Although it did little more than freshen up old
law, the circumstances are interesting enough for notice.
The action was to recover £3oo.deposited with the Sports-
man, to abide the event of a boxing-match between Burge
(plaintiff) and Dobbs, for £3OO aside. Dobbs won, but,
before the stake was paid oVer, Burge gave notice to
the Sportsman people not to pay it to Dobbs, but to repay
it to himself. The Sportsman, however, handed the
stake over to Dobbs, whereupon Burge sued the Sports-
man and recovered his money. The court held that the
old law was still good which declared that, if a person de-
posited a sum with a stakeholder to abide the event of a
wager, he had a right at any moment to require it to be
handed back to him, so long as it had not actually been
paid over.

The use of modern powders will necessitate
larger and better-enclosed grounds than are at present
used by pigeon-shooters. At Morelands (Vic.), recently,
a lad was shot in the face whilst playing in a back-yard
200yds. from where the gun was fired. The force of
cannonite powder is tremendous. Writer once saw Hugh
Roarty blow the head, wings and legs clean off a pigeon
which was flying towards him. Also saw a cannonite
cartridge fired out of an. ordinary gun, and a good gun
too. The barrel split up as if a steel wedge had been
forced down it.

When Major Thompson was picking horses at
Singleton, N.S.W. for the Imperial Govt., many of the
animals were rejected and few were chosen. An ancient
moke was trotted round the ring and dismissed as of no
account. Owner changed the rider and equipped the new
jockey with long-necked spurs. The result was magical,
and the mount was passed for £B. Three months before,

Which was the best all-round horse ever seen in
Australia ? Carbine or Ahercorn, Grand Flaneur or First
King. No, Malua. Look at his record in cups and big

cup. He has also been a big success at the stud.

J ust now, when all Maoriland is in the thick of
the maddest possible gamble in gold-dredging shares, and
even the kitchen, sink is being pegged and floated as a
dredging-area, the Council of Christian Churches has
taken on itself to moan about the humble totalisator,
which, as compared to the dredge gamble, is a fly-speck
beside an elephant. One reverend, with better logic than
the rest, proposed that the council should attack the
dredging and the tote gamble together, that the churches
should speak to Christian dredgers on the unchristian
character of their dredge gambles, and that ministers
should make themselves acquainted with the details of
the business, so that they might preach in an authorita-
tive tone against the evil. But the worldly parson is
already full up of dredging scrip, and knows too much
about it, and the unworldly one would only be loaded
with shares in wild-cat dredges while pursuing his in-
quiries. It was a significant fact that the council ac-
cepted the anti-tote report, but dropped the proposed
dredging curse on a point of order. Few institutions
know better than the Church does the time to come in
«ut of the dew. The cries of that one conscientious
parson to the rest of his colleagues to come out and get
wet might as well have been addressed to a pillar of
salt.

After Maluma’s bad fall in Liverpool Cup
there can be no more doubt that the Tod Sloan system of
riding is dangerous to the gee-gee and the man, but
especially to the gee-gee. Fred Archer and Fordham, of
yore, rode hundreds of races during the season, year
after year, without ever falling off. English jockeyship
is a little less cautious nowadays, perhaps, still the Cannons
and the Loateses rarely come to grief. But Tod Sloan
frequently has a spill, vvith disastrous results to the ’orse
as a rule. We heard of his mount coming down in the
Derby, and having to be put out of its agony on the
course, two or three years back. He has been down in
handicaps and w.f a. races. Maluma is the latest recorded
instance of a Sloan disaster. Horse stumbles, and little
Tod, perched upon its neck, can’t pull the animal together.
His system of riding increases the chance of a stumble
and diminishes the chance of a “ successful recovery.”

The new A..T.C. committee-men have a chance

Canadians who have seen Australian lacrosse—
notably in Adelaide—aver that a local picked team woifld
give the best Canadian twelve a good game, if not a
beating. To bring out a Canadian team would mean at
least £2OOO, and it seems hardly likely that this will all
be found, in Australia, anyway. The drawback to
lacrosse as a game to draw gates is the difficulty spec-
tators have in following the play owing to the smallness
of the ball. The ease with which the game can be fol-
lowed will always make football the leading winter sport.

Are International Hatreds a Good
Investment?
Colin M'Kat Smith on the above subject:
The query is one of the last importance. No topic with
which journalism can concern itself has a more immediate
bearing- upon that ordered prosperity which wholesome-
minded peoples regard as the end and aim of their secu-
lar existence. The remarkable success with which
international and racial hatreds are cultivated in our
time, is surely worthy of examination. That we can take
to them as a matter of natural preference, and without
some explanatory motive, is plainly inadmissible : any
such acknowledgment would amount to a repudiation,
not so much of Christianity, as of civilization. On a mere
surface view, it would almost seem as if it could be
plausibly argued that war made for prosperity. Britain
decides to try conclusions with the Dutchmen of the
Transvaal. No sooner do her armies begin to move, than
numberless industries receive an impetus, in which high-
priced human labor finds ready account. Are there not
coal-beds to be mined, mountains of ironstone to be
smelted, great iron plates to be rolled, ships to be
planned and built, cannon to be forged, small arms,
ammunition, bayonets, swords, saddles, forage,
to be "supplied vans limit; to do no more
than touch the fringe of the activities called into
existence by any considerable war. Even the mixing of
the devilish chemistries of lyddite have their compensa-
tion, if so you choose to call it, in bringing work, wages,
and increase of human comfort, to many toilers. Leaving
moral considerations out of the account, the superficial
deduction would seem to run to this : That when enemies
do not thrust themselves naturally in our way, the next
best thing to do is to select one or more sections of the
human family, with the view of forcing a quarrel upon
them. Bat the belief that the application of the earth’s
treasures, and the material accumulated by human
resource, to purely destructive uses, can make for other
than eventual sorrow, or is anything less than discounting
a bill upon the future, at ruinous usury, is one which,'
stated in its naked simplicity, could scarcely be expected
to impose upon the most credulous of marines.
* * * *
Waiving for the moment the question whether wars are
at all times avoidable, one may, I suppose, claim assent to
the abstract proposition that war, as such, is an execrable
thing, a desolating abomination. And I may surely invite
the acknowledgment that those who, unless with patent
justification, use the influences within their control to
foster and promote the war-spirit are as nearly as possible
the worst enemies a country can contain. I propound
these theses without the sm illest reference to the war
now.being waged in South Africa. The opportunity for
its dispassionate study is not yet; it will come.
* * ■» *
Not long ago London Times, writing of the fre-
quently-strained relations of our country with foreign
powers, used the phrase, “ our splendid isolation.” The
isolation is on open view ; where the splendor comes in I
for one do not know. Those who set themselves out to
cultivate hatreds, be it on the individual or the
international scale, need never anticipate difficulty in
having the order filled. Supply adjusts itself to de-
mand with an exactness unknown in the walks of ordinary
commerce. That the Englishman is freely execrated by
non-English-speaking races on his own plane of cultivated
progress, is an imputation capable of being launched
without any sense of apology, inasmuch as, not only is
he himself conscious of it, but it is his humor rather
proudly to own to it, in the spirit of the phrase Which I
have culled from his favorite oracle. Where shall we look
for the microbe of this peculiar growth ? It is not exactly
a new one ; but accidents political, educational, and geo-
graphical, have rather favored its propagation. My own
studies have led me to the conclusion that the freehold
upon which it thrives is vested in the Head Printers.
Certain members of the sect own that Englishman’s lay
Bible already referred to, the Times newspaper. Others
of it run Punch, a sort of planetary satellite of the main
body. In our own local and more limited sphere, it is
represented by two chief, and two minor moons, which
complete their orbit every 24 hours. For present purposes
it will suffice to accept these as representing the seed-beds
upon which malice, hatred, and uncharitableness, in the
international rendering of the terms, are ripened into a
venomous maturity. They are the vehicles in which not
only is every trifling incident in the spheres whether of
diplomacy or war magnified into the extreme of mis-
chievous possibility, but invention is never wanting when
raw material runs short. Thus a gallant soldier like Lord
Roberts gets reported as announcing to his men that
“they will soon have an opportunity of avengin Mag-
gersfontein ” ; Sir Rbdvers Buller is made to advertise
his intention of “having his Christmas dinner in Pre-
toria” ; and, of course, the Sydney cabfegraph man
in Fleet - street, London, has always up; his sleeve,
when occasion demands, “ the mobilisation of the
fleet,” “the Channel squadron” (dramatically) “ordered
to Gibralter,” the “ massing of troops by Russia,”
it may be on the “ Afghan,” it may be on the
“ Chinese ” border, but any border will do equally
well ; these being mere surface specimens of the
tricks, both mean and stale, on the strength of which,
were there men of real capacity, with any serious desire to
moderate the passions of their readers, at this end, he
would have been kicked out of his billet, any time these 15
years. The Czar of Russia—sineerest advocate of peace on
the earth’s surface at the present time—was recently re-
Eorted as rejecting with contempt a proposition made to
im, to convert Britain’s time of trouble into Russia’s
opportunity. Note the sweet spirit of charity in which
the senior journal of Australia refers to the' incident:
“ At the best, Great Britain cannot expect more from
Russia than malevolent neutrality 1 ”

No one. capable of grasping the almost visible evolution
of events would care to dispute the proposition that
journalism, as a political motive force, increases in
strength from year to year. It constitutes a despotism
dissociated from the redeeming feature of despotisms, the
possibility of being capsized by revolution. It represents
power divorced from intelligence, unless, perhaps, that
low form of intelligence which regards news vending solely
from the shop-apron standpoint, and finds its account in
pandering to the Philistini-m of the hour. The power of
miking war, so far as Britain is concerned, rests, as the
world generally believes with the Queen. In the'
popular mind, it is supposed to be vested in Minis-
ters and Parliament. As a matter of naked fact,
it is the exclusive privilege of the Head Printers,
and chiefly of the Times. .When, as British Premier,
Lord Palmerston, in the course of an exceptionally pro-
longed political career, found opportunities, which he
diligently used, of dealing out his high-handed insolence
to powers and principalities throughout geographical
space, it was always with the certainty of the Times being
behind him as echo and endorser. For half a century or
more the witlings of Punch have found butter for their
bread in pourtraying, both by pencil and pen, Frenchmen,
Russians, and Americans—the era of gush over these-
latter had not yet set in— as typifying every last possi-
bility in the way of baseness. The late John Leech must
have built a more than respectable income on “ Mossoo ”
alone. And an earldom might, I should say, be respect-
ably endowed upon John Tenniel’s income from cartoons,
in which the chosen three, with the Sultan of Turkey
occasionally thrown in, have invariably been rendered as
objects either of ridicule or contempt. They are the con-
venient foils by contrast with which the shining virtues
of Bull, the man in top-boots, are suitably proclaimed.
They are the “ confidence” men, he the innocent yokel
from the country upon whom they practise. They are for
ever on the prowl to seize his acres or his strong-box, he
the man of peace who merely wishes to keep them out.
* * * *
Of course, it is open to remark, the Times isn’t Britain,
Punch isn’t Britain ; the numberless penny rags of
Jingoism which adopt them as their model are not Britain.
These journals, saj 7 the Head Printers, are our private
property ; we are free to put in what we like; free to
leave out what we prefer left out. If you do not like
them, you can easily save .your 3d. or your Id. as the case
may be. If in ministering to the gospel of strife, we
choose to take our line, from the vein of sentiment upon
which music-halls are run, and generally to play to the
gallery, what is that to you? And to this, there is, sad
to say, no adequate reply. In time we may ppssibly get
accustomed, if not reconciled, to the experience of having
our opinions shot in upon us each morning from the news
cart, along with the milk. But in accepting without
audible protest, the shoddy goods thus faked upon us, we
surely deprive ourselves of coherent defence, when
charged with being accessories after the fact, and as
standing in with those who fill the world with violence
and slaughter.
* * * *
What is it to your Head Printer plutocrat that the area
of human comfort is lessened ; that the condition* of
existence are rendered more precarious to those whose
daily lot is one of perpetual contest with adverse con-
ditions ; that every million diverted to the waste of war
is a handicap upon human industry : a killer of life policy
renewals ; a deduction from the possibilities Of building
up provision against a rainy day ! But never mind all
that: up with your hats in the air ; “ we’ve got the men,
we’ve got the ships,” and all the rest of it. Some might,
perhaps, tell you, what the Head Printers withhold; thal
the finer reserves of national character, the side of it to
which chauvinism and swagger count for an abomination,
were, under the influence now dominant, disappearing
down the shoot. But you have your easy retort—“ Who
are those that say so? Are they not mere wretched
Oobdenites and little Englanders?”
* * * *
The Head Printer is, no doubt, in his own view, and in
his own way, a patriot. He represents a form of patriotism
which is mainly composed of bigotry, ignorance and
stupid prejudice, and a love of country which is not so
much love of his own country as hatred of somebody
else’s. He represents, in an exaggerated form, the
frenzy of the moment. If the idea of the moment is good,
which happens not often, he may strive, to make it
better—though he doesn’t always, in any really intelli-
gent sense, know how. If it is bad, which is very often
indeed, he strives to make it worse, and that he always
knows how to do. All the same, he is the coming man :
let us bow down before him, lest a worse thing befall us.
“N.S.W.” Silver League ” —he should call him-
self “N.S.W. Silver Crank”—sends along this
very curious letter about the good old “ meejum
of exchange ” :
Editor Bulletin’. —Can you tell me if there is anythin'?
to prevent a company (say) in China minting £lOO of half-
crowns (English) and having it paid into a banking-
account in Sydney, drawing the amount out in gold,
sending that gold back to China, purchasing with £lOO of
gold silver, at 2s. 3d. per oz., making £240 of half-crowns,
sending it here again, or perhaps to Melbourne this time,
and so on ? It might explain the fact of £400,000,000 of
gold which has been unearthed in Australia, and of which
we can only boast about £20,000,000 at present.
Now, first of all, why do it in China, so that the
passage-money of the conspirators back and for-
ward would damage the profits, and the time
spent in wandering to and fro would be so many
lost months per annum—months that should be
devoted to the .manufacture of sham half-crowns?
And why go in for a system whereby the trunks-
full of half-crowns would have to run the gauntlet
of the Customs ? Why not do the business here?
And the wonderfulness of the theory that our
vanished £380,000,000 of gold has disappeared
simply through being replaced by £380,000,000
worth (nominal) of sham florins and such ! At that
rate it might occur to any rational observer that
the £380,000,000 worth of silver would be here, and
that the Australian banks, instead of reporting
that they hold £20,000,000 of gold and silver as
they now do, would report that they hold
£400,000,000 —£350,000,000 of it being small change!
And think of £380,000,000 of sham silver money
being distributed among 4,ooo,ooopeople (£95 worth
of small change for every inhabitant) without it
bein g notice ! And yet The Bulletin’s corres-
pondent is a prominent bi-metallist who gives
Australia learned advice about the “meejum of
exchange.”


THE TIME
IS LIMITED.
Prompt decision is needful for those who desire to secure sets of the London “Times ” Reprint
of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNIC A at the especially low price and convenient terms of
payment provided for residents of this colony. The offer of The “ Times” has been before the
public but a short time. At the rate applications are now coming in, the present offer can be
continued but
Two or Three Weeks at Best.
When a work so well known and so fully appreciated as the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITAN-
NIC A is offered to the public for less than half the publishing catalogue price, it is not strange
that the offer should receive
Prompt Acceptance
Among the best people. The fact that the entire set of 25 volumes is delivered to the sub-
scriber upon payment of the first guinea, the remainder to be paid in convenient monthly in-
stalments, makes it possible even for those of slender purse to provide themselves with this
greatest of literary necessities.
It has been said
Of the vast library of the British Museum that the twenty thousand volumes kept in the read-
ing-room for current reference contain all that is worth reading in the million and a-half volumes
in the galleries. The ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA may be regarded as in some sort
a second distillation of the whole. One turns instinctively to the ENCYCLOPAEDIA
BRITANNICA when some urgent question is to be answered, but it is an error to think of it
only as a remedy in moments of emergency. A glance at its beautifully illustrated pages will
give abundant proof that the classical work of reference is withal a book to read, to read easily,
for the mere pleasure of hearing a tale well told: the delight we feel, even at our laziest
moments, in following the lead of an able mind. The ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA
is not a lexicon, it is neither dull nor categorical ; its comfortable pages, full of matured thought,
are for all men’s common use. There is not a trace of pedantry in its tone ; the great men of
our day wrote it, and every one of the 1100 contributors was proud to do his best in such goodly
company.
Those who apply
Without further
Loss of Time
Can secure this great work on the advantageous terms that now prevail temporarily, providing
you apply at once. Those who hesitate longer may lose the opportunity that presents ito elf
once more for acceptance. When the stock reserved for this colony is subscribed for, no further
sets will be obtainable, and the offer will then be withdrawn at once without notice.

An Admirable Investment.
The “ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITA.NNICA ” is an admirable investment for three excellent
reasons, ihe three excellent reasons which combine to recommend the “ Encyclopaedia ” are these:
■no Jr P is the very best thing of its sort to purchase. The “ENCYCLOPAEDIA
L 1 AJ\ NIG A has been recognised, ever since the first edition was published in 1771, as the very
best work of reference in the world. It is easy enough to find more costly books, to purchase a thou-
sand volumes instead of only twenty-five, but that thousand would be ill-chosen if the twenty-five
volumes of the “ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA ” were not among them. It is not, indeed, too
much to say that no thousand other volumes contain so great a proportion of the whole sum of human
knowledge as do these five-and-twenty. Here, then, is one excellent reason why the “ Encyclopaedia”
is the very best thing of its sort.
In the second place, the ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA may at the moment be purchased
upon remarkably advantageous terms. The established publisher’s price for the twenty-five volumes
in cloth binding is £37. “ The Times ” offers precisely the same work, unaltered and unabridged, for
seventeen monthly payments of one guinea each, or for £l7 in cash—less than half-price. This is
another excellent reason, for everyone must wish that the pounds and shillings one spends should do
their utmost in adding to the accumulated wealth of the investor.
In the third place, the purchase of the ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA does not involve,
on the one hand, ready money, nor yet, on the other hand, the incurring of a vague debt which the
debtor may be called upon to pay when it is least convenient for him to do so.
• >
A preliminary payment of only one guinea in cash will secure the delivery of the volumes. After
the delivery has been made other payments of one guinea each become due at monthly intervals. The
purchaser of the “ Encyclopedia ” who adopts this novel and convenient system of paying for books
knows precisely when his payments should be made, and knows too that each one of them is so incon-
siderable as to make hardly any strain upon a month’s income.
Concerning: the Forthcoming: “Supplement.”
A Supplement to the Ninth Edition of the ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA is now in course
of preparation, and will shortly be published by “ The Times.” When completed it will be supplied
to purchasers of “The Times” Reprint at a lower price than that at which it will be obtainable by the
public at large.
It is impossible to give a work so large and so comprehensive as the ENCYCLOPaEDIA
all the minor advantages possessed by an annual, such as “Whittaker’s Almanac” or the “States-
man’s Year Book.” The scholarly care with which the ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA was
prepared serves to make the progress of its issue so slow that its volumes must inevitably cease to be
“up to date ” before they leave the printer’s hands. The value of such a work is quite unaffected by
the changes of the moment. It has none of the perishability of a directory or a year-book, because its
editors were wise enough not to attempt to give it the advantages and disadvantages of an annual.
Information that is truly of an encyclopaedic nature does not indeed accumulate in any great degree
in a year, or even in a score of years; it is only in the case of a few of the more rapidly-advancing
sciences that more could be said than is now contained in the treatises of the ENCYCLOPaEDIA
BRITANNICA. The subjects which have been seriously affected by the progress of the past few
years form so small a proportion of the contents of the ENCYCLOPaEDIA BRITANNICA that the
great bulk of the work will probably remain the same even should a tenth edition be issued to the
next generation.
No steps will be taken towards preparing the tenth edition for many years to come, and when a
new edition is undertaken it will require at least twelve or fifteen years to complete it. The present
edition (the ninth), with the Supplement now in preparation, will, therefore, be the national standard
work of reference for at least twenty years to come.
The editor-in-chief of the Supplement is Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, and it will contain new
articles dealing with the various inventions, discoveries, etc., which have been made since the ninth
edition was completed.
The Supplement will also contain biographies of distinguished men and women who have died
since then. The various treatises of the ninth, edition and all the scientific and historical information
which these treatises present will be brought up to date so fully that the issue of the Supplement will,
to all intents and purposes, make all the volumes of the ninth edition as recellt as if they had been pre-
pared this year.
A Work Which Has No Competitor.
The Ninth Edition of the “ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA,” completed nearly ten years
ago, at once assumed, and has finally retained, a position of paramount authority. Upon its own plane
and in its own field, it has absolutely no competitor. Its plane and its field are, indeed, of its own
creation, for no other library of reference has ever been planned upon so comprehensive a scale, or
constructed with so uncompromising a determination to make the very best possible bo< f without
counting the cost. The smaller works of reference are so much smaller, that it would be gro jly unfair,
to even the best of them, to compare them with the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNiCA. The
Encyclopaedia is the only work which can fairly be described as a complete library in itself, and to own
it is, as Mr. Gladstone said, “to acknowledge one’s self as recognising the best there is in literature.”
To have such a work always at hand is a silent invitation to wholesome reading and high thinking.
Yet the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA is not dry and repellant; many of the most popular
novelists and essayists of the day are among the contributors; and such names as those of Mrs.
Humphry Ward, Sir Walter Besant, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Lang, Mr. Dobson, are in themselves the
best evidence of its literary charm.
The policy pursued by the editors of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA—the determination
to enlist the services of the very best writers, and to present their writings in clear type, carefully
printed, and copiously illustrated, made the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA one of the most
costly works ever offered to the public. And the price fixed by the publishers was necessarily a high
one —in some measure a prohibitive one. But the present special offer of The Times remedies this
one defect, overcomes this one obstacle, and the “book that answers questions” has now become
accessible to every thoughtful man who has questions to ask of it.

Melba left Australia in *B6. If the public of Melbourne
were unconscious of her exceptional powers, the critics
were not to blame. A par. in the Lorgnette, dated
xlarch 2,1886, said: “This talented young Australian,
who has fairly earned the title of The Australian Prima*
Donna, will take her only and farewell benefit (it realised
io profit only) next Saturday. . . . Mrs. Armstrong goes
mime to finish her professional musical training in Europe.
Her laudable ambition is justified. The Argus, of August
10th, last year, says : ‘ We have but few words to say con-
cerning this lady, and we weigh them well before uttering
them. Such beautiful natural gifts as she possesses mark
lor her a place among soprano vocalists on a level with
.ma de Murska.’” Well, Melba is another De Murska.
Edson : “Fax’s” proofs that Nance O’Neil was ab-
surdly over-boomed in Melbourne are ridiculously weak.
Melb. papers published interviews with Williamson, and
Williamson said he was taking the Exhibition-street
house to present Nance to Melb. What then ? William-
son had returned to Melb., and was practically starting a
new theatre ; the papers would have interviewed him
had Nance been as unheard-of here as she was nine
months ago. But Nance had just kicked up something
of a dust in Sydney, and the mention of the big woman
was rather casual. If - this is booming, what would
hax be pleased •to call the hullabooloo raised over
numerous half-pinters from—other places?
Snorter ” writes : “ In excuse for Nanceoneil’s rough-
and-unready performance of “ Fedora,” the rash ‘ Edson’
writes you from Melbourne—‘ Certainly no actress operat-
ing here has worked through so many heavy roles in so
short a time ’ —and he talks Of Nance’s three characters
within eight days as a quite phenomenal strain on her
mighty physique. Nance, up to date, has played eight
characters in 12 weeks. Mrs. Bernard Beere, who was in
bad health when she came to Melbourne, played seven
star parts in less than seven weeks, and nobody made a
fuss about itr. Here are some of Mrs. 8.8.’s dates—April
30th, 1892, ‘ Fedora ’; May 2, ‘ Lady Gay Spanker ’; May
5, Miss Hardcastle (‘ She Stoops to Conquer ’) ; May 9,
Lena Despard (‘ As in a Looking Glass ’); and May 10,
Beg Woffington. Tliis after she had played Lady Teazle
and Adrienne Lecouvreur.”
Melbourne has seen three performances of “Fedora” in
English within the past 10 years, and the Nance O’Neil
performance was not the greatest of these. In
March, ’96, the Brough-Boucicault co. tried “ Fedora” at
the Princess’s. Mrs. Brough lacked strength in the name-
part, but the show was artistic. Titheradge as Ipanoff,
Cecil Ward as Jean de Serieux, and Miss Faber as his
“mash,” the Countess Olga, Boucicault as the Chief of
Russian Police, and Mario Majeroni, Miss Temple, George
Carey, and Miss Katherine Hardy among the small-part
players. When Mrs. Bernard Beere played “ Fedora ”at
the Opera House in April, ’92, the season was ruined
by the “sudden indisposition” of her leading man,
Herbert Standing, on the first night, after which the
pretty fellow of the co., Otho Stuart, took the part of
Ipanoff, and took it very well. Marius, the Frenchman,
then played De Serieux, handsome Isabelle Urquhart was
the Countess, and the boy-part of Dmitri (in knicker-
boikers) fell to Miss Henrietta Watson. That’s only
eight years ago, and yet there isn’t one Melb. theatre-
goer in 500 who remembers that Miss Watson, the bril-
liant Miladi of “ The King’s Musketeer,” once played a
boy in “rationals” at the Opera House. For that mat-
ter, not one in 10,000 knows that the Alexandra Theatre
was styled Her Majesty’s on the programme years before
it got the name from J.O.W. And probably nobody
would be more surprised than J.C.W. if one could lure
him into losing a wager on the point.
“ Narranghi ” : At last he has arrived 1 'A new kind of
circus clown. Heard him at Fitzgerald Bros.’ show in
Brisbane t’other night. Judging by his dialect, brother
Tom must have trapped him just about where the meri-
dian of Vienna crosses the frontier between Pekin and
Ireland. The coming century must evidently be simply
stuffed with wholesome novelties when a surprise of this
magnitude slips through in advance.
Wilson Barrett was among the hundreds of blatant self-
advertisers who sent Mafeking telegrams to Baden-Powell .
or rather he sent it to Lord Roberts, with a request that
the worried little man would send it along. This was
Barrett’s particular foolishness—” Hurrah 1 Ordered you
actor’s make-up box in silver. When Bobs can spare you
come home and use it.”
Jnlius Knight, when last heard of, was about to do a
London suburban tour “ on his own,” playing the calm,
masterful baronet in “ Forget-me-Not,” with Miss Elliott
Page as the all-important Stephanie. “ Forget-me-Not ”
is a better show for the lady than for our old friend
Marcus Julius.
This, from an Australian cinematograph advt., takes,
not merely the cake, but the whole bakery: “It is the
expressed wish of his Holiness that those who see his
Benediction in the moving figures at the Biograph, and
receive it in proper spirit, should participate in the hap-
Einess, in the glory, and in the advantage of it as if it was
estowed upon them personally. —Sebastian Martinelli,
Apostolic Delegate.” Science has “got there" at last!
Salvation per camera 1
“ Snakes ” : I take a couple of lines from “ Stroller’s ”
audacious fairy tale re the Melb. performance of “ Hedda
Gabler.” Says the inventive “Stroller,” who, by the
way, alleges that he was the sole man among 200 women
in a rush for the amphitheatre—“Nance had reason to be
proud. She had interested a majority among whom a
few years ago the ‘Doll’s House ’ was guyed.” Now, the
“ Doll’s House,” with Janet Achurch as heroine, ran for
two weeks (or three weeks) at Melb. Princess’s, the audi-
ences being more male than female. There was no actual
guying of the “ Doll’s House,” except on the first night.
On subsequent nights there may have been a little
derisive laughter at certain points, but it was not so
general as the titter that Nance evoked by her shout-
ing in the last act of “Hedda.” Nance was out of
sight at the time. She had gone behind a curtain
to commit suicide, and before shooting herself she
made a few last remarks in the tones of a
suburban matron talking over the back fence. “ Hedda
Gabler ” would have been unmercifully guyed by
an average first-night audience of men and women such
as witnessed Achurch’s debut in Australia. But where
there are, by “ Stroller’s” own showing, 200 women to 1
man (as a matter of fact, the women throughout the
house outnumbered the men by about 20 to 1) the guying
is restricted to titters and sniggers. The men felt too
lonely to laugh. As for the allegation that Nance’s show
interested the majority (by which “Stroller” would give
you to understand that the piece could have drawn more
people than “ Doll’s House” drew in a fortnight), I refer
you to the notices in Melb. Age and Herald.
“Faust” will be one of the first of Musgrove’s grand-
opera productions at Melb. Princess’s. In fact, it looks as
though the season would open with “Faust, after which
the Wagnerian operas. -
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis has been engaged to play the
geflial Madam.e in “ Trilby,” at Her Majesty’s, Melb. The
Ekiith Crane co. starts proceedings with “Trilby” on
Sept. 2.
Baritone John Prawse, whose pose while singing can
only be likened to that of a starter in a 100yds. sprint wait-
ing for the pistol to pop, is not supporting Mdlle. Tre-
belli—Dolores, she now calls herself—in America.
Rev. Stewart Headlam (of London) has dropped the ex-
tinguisher over the-flickering Church and Stage Guild:
Hie “ felt it was best for a society which has done its work
to give thanks for its success, and.to dissolve,” the alleged
success being the annihilation, by the Grace of God and
8- Headlam, of “ecclesiastical prejudices against the
stage.” Therefore the last “ Guild Service ” was held on
Ascension Day, and a gathering of members and friends
sang hymns to the Giver of all good ballet-girls, and the
Spirit of the Guild went up to Heaven without dying.
Rev. H. was said to be quite sincere and proper in his
efforts to promote kerristian feeling between Church and
Stage, but one always thought of him as the hero of a
verse in Peggy Pryde’s ditty concerning the evangelist
who got behind the scenes and found himself environed
by ardent young disciples of the opposite sex—
“ They tickled him in the ribs,
O, the darlings were so bright;
He had never been there before—but now
He’s going there every Right.”
Paul Martinetti is one of the marvels of the profesh.
His remarkable somersault at the finish of “Robert
Macaire ” has to be considered in the light of the fact
that.he made .his first appearance, in. Australia 33-years
ago. He was quite a young fellow then—only 20 he says
—but anyhow not too young to be styled “ Mr.” Paul
Martinetti on the Theatre Royal display bills, one of
which is shown in a frame just now atMorell’spub., corner
of Bourke and Swanston streets, Melbourne. He took a
benefit, it seems, in the character of Jocko, a monkey,
and figured as the head-waiter in “ Robert Macaire,”
whilst Julien and Philippe Martinetti (the old originals,
presumably) were playing the two thieves. 33 years ago 1
If the nimbleness of Paul Cinque valli, the man of forty,
or thereabouts, appeared remarkable for his age, what
about this other Paul, the apostle !' £
Apropos the recent ridiculous appearances of a lady
who, apparently, is a raw amateur with no sort of turn
for the stage. Such incompetence in a male actor would not
escape open ridicule from an Australian metropolitan first-
night audience. Two or three men have been “guyed”
at the Princess’s of late years, and way back in the rather
long ago there was an outbreak of public scorn at the
Pijou. It happened on the night of Arnold’s first Austra-
lian appearance as Hans the Boatman. The villain of the
piece was played by an amateur who lost nerve, and the
gods ” made it so warm for the unhappy man that the
management wouldn’t let him appear again. Phil Stuart,
at that time an occasional mummer, stepped into the
gap, and “ Hans ” went booming along as if there had been
no opening fiasco.
" Locust” : Miss Winston Weir’s constant tremolo has
the same effect upon my ears that the flicker of the cine-
matographs has upon my eyes.
a II J-O-G- •” T’other night witnessed the stirring drama
Ned Kelly ”at Manly. In the interval went out to “ see
a man ” and heard a young Australian of about 18 years
going up street, exclaim, “Well, I don’t care what any-
body sez—Ned Kelly was the best blanky man that Aus-
tralia ever saw."
Brough’s step-sister, Brenda Gibson, the original Sweet
Lavender in Australia, is getting to be quite an old-estab-
| ] ( shed member of Irving’s co. She was playing in
Olivia” at the Lyceum last month. Fred Laye—he now
takes his family name of Tyler—who had to leave the B.
a Ui Co ‘ * n **' s ear ly days on account of his unconcealc
able and pardonable fondness for Miss Boucicault, is play;
mg at the Haymarket in “ School for Scandal.” Dion
Boucicault and Polly Emery are engaged in the London
Criterion success, “ Lady Huntworth’s Experiment.”
Titheradge has a good part in “ A Message from Mars,” at
the Avenue. Miss Beryl Faber is on the bill at the
Royalty, and Percy Lyndon looms large at the Duke of
York’s. There seems plenty of room on the London stage
for artists whose Australian experience was marked
1 B.B.”
Charles Cartwright’s successful performance of Oliver
Cromwell in days of yore has induced him to go halves
with one Arthur Patterson in the manufacture of a new
play called “The Ironsides,” wherein he will play som6
more Oliver.
London papers have a rumor that Kyrle Bellew is
going to build a theatre for himself. But who believes
these rumors?
“ G.F.8.” : “The Pirates of Penzance” will by now
have succeeded the 200-nights’ run of “ The Rose of Per-
sia ”at London Savoy. Wonderful the popularity still
of Gilbert and Sullivan. A few weeks of “The Pirates”
will bring the total number of performances of their
operas, at the Savoy alone, up to 6000, “The Mikado"
being easily ahead with nearly 1200 performances. After
The Pirates ” is to come a new opera by Basil Hood
and Sullivan. By-the-way, Gilbert is again to appear in
the law-courts. This time the dispute is with Janette
Steer a rising “ lead” now at London Comedy with
her own co.—about a recent revival of “ Pygmalion and
Galatea,” the first London revival for 16 years.
Many Australians will be sorry to hear that Miss
Grace Warner’s husband, the brilliant Franklin M’Leay,
lately died in London at the early of 33.
Said by people “in the .know” that war-correspond-
ent Donald Macdonald will probably clear
£BOOO and £lO,OOO out of his lecturing-tour. Up to now,
it is stated, he has made between £4OOO and £5OOO, and>
has yet to traverse Maoriland, which is verra Scottish '
and will gladly listen to a Macdonald.
“S.": A delightful creature is the professional reciter.
Heard one giving “ Bingen on the Rhine ” at a recent
social function. He wailed of the girl who was “ too
innocent for cocoa-tree," and declared : “ Ah, friend, I
fear the lightest tart makes sometimes heaviest mourn-
ing.”
(( When Harry Rickards goes to England to engage new
“ turns ” he has one stereotyped reply for the person who
wants to introduce him to a lady “ ballad-singer.” Per-
haps it is an agent who proposes to supply the Australian
manager with a cockney queen of song ; more often it is:
the husband of the lady. “My wife could come with me,
Mr. Rickards; she’s a nice littje ballad-singer”—which?
means that she possesses a raucous voice and has learned
four melodies by ear. “Engage a ballad-singer!” says
Harry ; “ my boy—why, we breed ’em in Australia."
Evidently “The Tyranny of Tears” was inspired by
Oscar Wilde’s epigram : “There is no tyranny so bad as
that exerted by the weak over the strong.”
An “ aged son ” was the other night burnt
to death with his parents in their house near Dun-
gog, N.S.W. The anomaly is explained by the
fact that the two old people totalled 177 years
between them.
Said Barton at Sydney Town Hall, with a
significant side glance at Lyne:—“ Had the
Premiers sent a. stronger rep>ly to a certain cable-
gram from Mr. Chamberlain, there would have
been no amendment to the Bill.” And Lyne
explained that a majority of Premiers preferred
amendment of Clause 74, whence their weakness.
One thing is quite clear now, that the Privy
Council appeal was maintained for the benefit of
lawyers and property-holders, and at their
instance. 4 •
The “ outlawing ” of the Breelong blacks
will apparently make no difference because the
present trouble is that no one with a practicable
gun can get a sight of the fugitives. Also,
Guerilla Minister See has, as usual, made an ass
of himself by ordering the arrest of the Governors’
brothers and “any other aboriginals who openly
express sympathy with the Governors.” What is
“ expressing sympathy ” ? Would Mr. See have a
black run-in for saying “I’m sorry for poor
Jimmy and Joe ” ? If so, J.S. is a bright example
of the effects of Australian hysteria—the speoial
disease of this continent.

The Man That Came Back.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Frank Robertshaw ran away with his
wife’s lady-help, the congregation of St. Peter’s
said that her conduct was certainly reprehensible.
Then they told stories of his neglected condition
when with that literary wife of his—often and
often he had come home tired and hungry to find
the dinner uncooked. Then they sighed, and de-
clared you couldn't blame him ; now, could you ?
I went to see the discarded lady about a month
after the absconding one’s marriage with No. 2.
She had divorced him, of course ; another action
which raised the ire of the good ladies of St.
Peter’s. They, being eminently religious, would
have allowed the errant damsel to live in sin all
her life rather than give , her the satisfaction of
being made an honest woman.
The rejected dame was engaged writing up a
war-poem with the aid of a thesaurus and a
rhyming dictionary. She wore a mildly cheerful
expression and there was a flavor of ink on her
large and healthy hands. She stretched one of
them towards me with an equally well-developed
smile.
“Glad you’ve come. Heard all about me? I
thought so. Well, T’ll tell you some more.
There’s been a lot written about the siren that
lures men astray. I wish some greater genius
than myself—if there is any,’’ she added modestly
—“ would indict the virtuous woman who does as
much through her conscientiousness. Now just
listen.”
She tossed the thesaurus carelessly on the cat
which lay dreaming on the rug with its paws
folded up, and creased her immortal verses by the
sudden descent of a massive elbow.
“It’s a funny thing to be a clever woman.
Cleverness doesn’t seem much of an asset matri-
monially. My mother, who thought herself a
Woman of the world, used to say of me : ‘ She will
attract men intellectually.’ I remember not feel-
ing particularly joyous over the prospect. Yet
my sister Cynthia, who married for her beauty,
has lost the lily-complexion to which her husband
is still faithful in the cheeks of other women.
While I
“I met him at a boarding-house—a cheap and
lowly one. The boarders were nearly all girls just
then ; but there was a man of the young, smooth-
headed bank-clerk variety. Whenever he went
out of the room the girls all talked of him. They
said that he was not exactly beautiful, but that
there was ‘something in his face,’ I don’t know
What they meant by that, unless it Was the aper-
ture into which he. inserted more food than the
landlady could reasonably afford at the price. I
Was the plainest of the women in the boarding-
house, dnd the worst-dressed, but I told him stories
that amused him when the other females were out
bf the room, and so he loved me with a true and
jiure affection. Then the other girls thought it
was my clothes and hair that did it, and took to
wearing old dresses and leaving their heads as
disordered as a retreating Boer array. They did
not know the secret of the charm.
“ I wasn’t really matrimonially inclined, but I
accepted Frank. I wanted a pet of some sort,
and couldn’t afford the dog-tax. Besides, I drifted
into it.
“We took a little house in the suburbs. Frank
went to .town and amused himself with figuring at
the bank, as before. I stayed at home, and wrote
speeches for members of Parliament and other
things. I made more money that way than Frank
did at the bank. Frank came home at 5 punc-
tually, and helped to bring in the dinner. Some-
times he did the whole business himself. In the
evenings he darned his socks, and I showed him
the things I had written, and told him a yarn or
two. There was nothing really bad about the
yams, but the clergyman at St. Peter’s would
have called them irreverent.
“I don’t think there was a happier little;chap in
all Sydney at that time. You’d have said so if
you’d seen him career into the parlor with the tea-
pot in one hand and the buttered toast in the
other, like the goat that skipped upon the moun-
tains—the one that the young man in the Song of
Solomon is described as resembling. If you can
comprehend, he liked being a worm. It was his
forte to be a male Dora Copperfield. Yet I un-
derstand that my conduct excited grave dr‘"Appro-
bation at the weekly meetings of the . owing
Society of St. Peter’s.
“ Of course they did not know anything about it
till I invested in a lady-help. She was one of the
girls I had known at the boarding-house—a soft,
sweet thing with open eyes set wide apart, and
crimped hair forming a neat semi-circle round her
broad, low bro\V. I had heard that she was out of
work, and I thought that she might just as well
make a convenience of my house till she got some-
thing.
“I rank was much disgusted when he heard what
I had done.
“She was eminently bourgeoise; she belonged to
the class of woman that treats the husband as an
Orphanage and Hospital combined, with a touch
of the Lunatic Asylum thrown in. She appeared
to think that this was enjoined by some observa-
tions made in the third chapter of Genesis. The
first time she saw Frank come in with the coal-
scuttle it was evident that her.religious sensibili-
ties had received a severe shock. She had hardly
strength to get tip and put the coal on herself.
“ Gradually she took the household into her own
hands. She looked after me perfunctorily, but
Frank was the Benjamin. I could see that she
was grieved at his position in the house. She
tried to indicate to me in a gentle womanly way
that I was not grateful enough for the honor of
being Frank’s wife. When Frank was away for
three days—the bank sent him—We economised on
scrappy luncheons and that hideous meal knowp
as high tea. “ Women don’t eat as touch as men,”
she would say, gently. The money saved was de-
voted to cooking little dishes for Frank, and of
these I soon felt that it was not etiquette for me
to partake.
“Gradually Frank ceased to help about the
house, and grew dyspeptic with the consequent
want of exercise. May soothed him. She told
me once, before him, that in her family the girls
were trained to watch for the first signs of a frown
on their brother’s face, and that moment to stop
and ask. themselves what they had done wrong.
She said, in her soft, womanly voice, that it was
the best in the long run. Then I remembered
that Frank had frowned three times that evening,
and that I had not taken the slightest notice of
him.
“I don’t think the girl meant anything wrong.
She was merely impelled to weep over Frank be-
cause she had seen him carrying a coal-scuttle,
and pity is akin to love.
“ She got a situation in the city at this time, and
left the house. But the mischief was done. Frank
was off his domestic duties. I was sorry for him.
I knew he wanted to begin them again, but he
felt that his manhood was at stake. I read him
some stories, but he snorted virtuously and said
that sort of thing was revolting in his wife. Then
he went out and enjoyed the conversation of the
local bar.
“When he came home he was drunk, and referred
to me as his wife again. It was the first time he
had ever really noticed the fact; a wise woman
strives to keep that gloomy circumstance in abey-
ance as much as possible.
“ Somehow, he blamed me for that drunk. He
went out again and had another. Then he met
the girl accidentally. Then he met her again—
not accidentally. She wept over his downfall.
He said if he had met her —if his home had been
different . He did not return that night. Nor
did she. You know the rest. Never did two
people fall from virtue more accidentally.”
She paused, and took up the thesaurus once
more.
“Did you ever meet him again?” I asked. So
far, the discarded lady did not seem to have scored.
“ Yes ; once. ■ It was two weeks after his mar-
riage. We came across each other in the Gardens.
He looked over-fed and phlegmatic. He told me
he was bored to death. She was always asking
questions. She ‘tried to take an intelligent in-
terest in things.’ Oh, it was horrible ! Then he
broke down and Wept on my shoulder, and won-
dered if he couldn’t come back somehow,”
“ And you couldn’t, of course?”
“ No. You see, I'm going to marry Professor
Mulholland next month, and he might object.”
CONSTANCE CLDE.
Beautifully Irish paragraph from a M.L.
Hibernian organ:—
The Irish regiments* composed of the poorer classes of
Irishmen, have by their bravery Covered themselves with
clory in South Africa, while the Irish Yeomanry, made
up principally of Irish landlords, have only been covered
with the dirty, cast-off clothes of their captors.
The question of a new cemetery for the
convenience of, surviving Melbournians threatens
to be debated and debated until corpses are
Crowded out of all the existing burial grounds, and
every man with a death in the family will have t 0
arrange for a private interment in his hack ygitb
Some eight or ten years ago the necessity-for a
large nev, T cemetery was said to be urgent, and
FrankstOn was officially fixed upon as a suitable
“pitch.” Then Chief Justice Madden built a
family residence at Frankston, and his cornelj'
womenfolk took to travelling frequently on the
railway line to and from Melbourne! and—that
was the end of the Frankston Cemetery scheme.
The idea of expecting the Madden ladies to dwell
in a marine suburb where they couldn't move
without meeting a hearse, or run for the train
without getting elbowed by chief mourners and
undertakers’ men, was not to be by
any Government. Similar objections have arisen
in the case of other cemetery sites that look suit-
able ; also the proposed crematorium at St. Kilda
is contrary to God’s word, or something of that
sort, and the day when Christian burial will be a
go-as-you-please competition is very nigh at hand
m Melbourne. The old Metropolitan Cemetery
has been finally closed with 200,000 subscribers;
at the pretty St. Kilda ground there is standing-
room only; the booking for the Kew and Bright-
on reserves is very brisk, but the wrangle of
municipal councils, Board of Health, influential
citizens, rival undertakers, &c., proceeds as usual.
If the wranglers don’t soon agree to sink their
grievances in a common grave the corpse of the
future will become a public scandal.
Wire from Rockhampton in Sydney daily
press:—
A Rockhampton member of 2nd Contingent, writing
from Pretoria, complains that Queenslanders were being
coerced into leaving the regiment. Lieut.-Col. Ricardo,
he said, had admitted that the services of the men as a
fighting force were not required, and he was one of the
foremost in trying to induce the men to join the S’African
police and railway service. Those remaining true to the
Queensland badge, the writer asserts, were treated under-
handedly and threatened with all sorts of penalties, some
of which had already been imposed. Many wishing to
return home sought escape by entering the Govt, service.
About 30 non-commissioned officers and men were deter-
mined to resist all efforts to compel them to leave the
ranks.
“ Smiler ” Hales writing from South
Africa to London Daily News on the Boer—him
of the Orange Free State in particular :
I think I wrote you some time back in regard to state-
ments appearing in the Press of Britain, concerning the
homes ih Africa. If I did, well and good. Anyway, I
want to state here that I have never lost a single
opportunity whilst travelling through the enemy’s
country of looking at the “home” life of these people,
and I may say that I have been in a few back-country
homes in America, in Australia, and in other parts of the
world, and I want to place it on record that in my opinion
the Boer farmer is as clean in his home life, as loving in
his domestic arrangements, as pure in his morals as any
Class of people I have ever met. Filth may abound, but
I have seen nothing of it. Immorality may be the
Common everyday occurrence I have seen it depicted in
some British journals, but I have failed to find trace of it.
Ignorance as black as the inside of a dog may be the pre-
vailing state of affairs ; if so, I have been one of the lucky
few who have found just the -reverse in Whichsoever
direction I have turned. After six months, or nearly six
months, 1 close and careful observation of their habits, f
have arrived at the conclusion that the Boer farmer* and
his son and daughter, will compare very favorably With
the farming folk of Australia, America and Great Britain.

In a Terribly Bad State
Soon Brisk and Cheerful.
The Oase of
MR. THOMAS WICKHAM.
(BP OUR SPECIAL REPORTER).
The shades of evening had already begun
to fall, and the bu y hujn of Brisbane’s
streets was fast dying a ay to a faint
murmur, when our reporter, in accord with
the instructions from his chief, hurried past
the Custom House, and walking along
Wickham Street, at length arrived at
Duncan Sheet, and ultimately stopped at
tae residence of Mr. Thomas Wickham,
wliicn is the se ond house in that thorough-
iare. Airs. Wickham received our reporter
courteously and very amiably engaged
him in conversation pending the arrival of
her hu band.
“I am sure,” she said, “ that my husband
will be only too p eased to give you every
infoi mation about his recovery from what
we both consider a very dangerous illness.
He is so grateful to Clements Tonic—the
friend in need—that anything to do with
that remedy is a favourite topic of con-
versation with him.”
Just then Mr. Wickham arrived and
joined in the conversation.
“ Well, how did the disease first attack
you ? ” commenced the reporter.
“It was a nervous complaint,” replied
Mr. Wickham, “ and first displayed itself in
a general shakiness. My hands trembled
just as if I had been lifting immense
weights.”
“ Where were you living at the time?”
asked the scribe.
“ I was at Townsville at the time, and
was engaged to superintend the large and
beautiful garden of a prominent Queens-
lander. As you can infer, mine was a
healthy occupation, and it is therefore
surprising that any nerve,or other malady
should attack me ; but attack me it did, and
I got into a terribly bad s'ate. That just
points out what I often toll people, that it
uoe-n’t matter how healthy you are you
never can tell the moment you may be
struck down with disease. Grad ally I
fell into a state of disquietude and unrest.
My appetite failed me altogether, and soon
it was no longer a pleasure for me to eat my
meals, but rather an unpleasant duty. Of
course, I «as forced to eat something or
otherwise I should have starved to death,
but my food never did me good, but lay
like a heavy lump on my chest. The days
seemed awfully long to me and the nights
longer.”
“ You didn’t sleep much, then ?”
“Oil,-no! In fact I obtained no real
sleep at all. I would often lie for hours in
a semi-conscious state, something between
sleeping and waking. Sometimes some
faint sound would rouse me up with a
sudden and distressing shock, and even in
the daytime anything unexpected happening,
su h as anyone shouting near me would
throw me ito a fit of trembling. My
nervous system was very much like a
machine tuat was loose in all its putts. I
felt I wanted oiling and screwing up and
bracing all o er. Naturally enough, I was
troubled with all sorts of low and dep essed
feelings. I could take little interest in
anything, but just let the time piss away
!n a dull, hopeless sort of way, as though I
didn’t care w at happened to me. Some-
times 1 flattered myself that I was feeling
a little better, but some slig t shock would
sccur and I should b; thrown b ick into a
state of ik rv uisness worse than ever.”
“ Did you stiff r any pain ?”
“ Yes, my head troubled me a good deal,
and at times a queer pain in wie back would
aftlic me.”
“ Where cl d you feel the pain in the
t»ack ? ” r
"Between the shoulders anft somecirntt
over the loins, it was a dull, dragging (jam
aiid I was always changing my position
when lying d wn, vainly hoping to gut ettsu
but whilst it lasted sleep of any kind waf
entirely out of the questkm,
“ But surely there are doctors in iiowu*
villc T ”
" Aye, there are, and chemists wwo so .1
all sorts of medicines wairanted to cure
anything, but what is the use of a doctor or
a chemist if neither the one nor the other
can cure you. I went to the doctor and f
went to chemists, and I took all they
ordered me to take, but all their physio
made no diff rence to my ailments. On the
other hand, I daily became worse under
their treatment, and got thinner and
weaker. 1 felt it was time I did something
decisive. I could nob afford to go tc
Sydney, or even to Brisbane, to consult
leading specialists on ner ecomplaints, and,
to tell you the truth, I don’t think that in
the weak and nervous state that I was in
th it I could have stood the journey. I
thought things looked very blue for me, I
can tell you, and 1 had nearly lost all hope.
Now comes the strange part of my story.
I had taken all sorts of patent medici es,
but with no benefit, and 1 felt inclined to
say as Shakespeare said : ‘ Throw physic to
the dogs,’ but one day I read about the
effects of Clements Tonic on nerve com-
plaints. The statements bore the stamp ol
truth, and, being sworn to, it caused me to
come to a decision. I didn’t let the day pass
without sending for a bottle ot Cle cuts
Tonic, and I commenced taking that
remedy—though I must confess I was so
anxious to get well that I took a little more
than .the regulation dose. (No benefit is
gained by increased dosage. I'D.) Next
day I continued on the same way, and the day
after I felt a, decided action from the
remedy. My nerves, were certainly much
firmer, and the tone of my system generally
seemed improved all round. In a day or
two more I found my digestive organs were
beginning to work again iu the proper
manner, and I felt bi'isker and more
cheerful and hopeful for the future. My
nerves grew stronger day by day, and, to
my delight, I found I was put ing on lle.-di
once more, and everyone said I looked
better than I had done tor months.
Clements Tonic gave me a steady appoi.itc
and enabled me to sleep once more in peace.
And, to wind up, I can only say that
Clements Tonic put me on my feet again
with nerves braced up and ready for
anything.”
“ Have you been troubled since *"
" No. My nerves are now as firm as a
rock, nor have I suffered since from any
pains in the back, and my digestive organs
work just as well as J could wish them tc.”
“ May we publish tne results you
obtained from Clements Tout#!'*'
" Certainly, you may, in

20 HIGHEST AWARDS
At every International Exhibition since wherever
it has been in competition.
SOAP
Has invariably been awarded the Highest Distinction at
the disposal of the Judges.
The Testimony of Eminent Analytical
Chemists :
From Dr. REDWOOD, Fli.D.,
F.1.C., F.C.S., See.,
Late Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy to th*
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
“My analytical and practical experience
of Pears’ Soap now extends over a very
lengthened period—nearly 50 years—during
winch time 1 have never come across
another toilet soap which so closely realises
my ideal of perfection : its purity is such
that it may be used with perfect confidence
upon the tenderest and most sensitive skiu
—even that of a new born babe.”
CHAS. R. C. TICHBORNE, Esq.,
LL.D., F.1.C., F.C.S.,
Lecturer on Chemistry at Carmichael College of
Medicine, Dublin, and Chemist to the Apothe-
caries’ Hall of Ireland.
“I have made three separate and in-
dependent analyses of Pears’ Soap, obtain-
ing the samples myself at the ordinary
retail shops, and from these examinations
lam enabled to certify to its purity. It is
made in a most perfect manner, and is free
from any causticity—to persons of delicate
skin a question of vital importance. Being
free from all adulteration with water its
durability is really remarkable. I cannot
speak too highly of it, for it strikingly
illustrates the perfection of toilet soap.”
STEVENSON McADAM, Esq.,
Ph.D., &c.,
jecturer on Chemistry, Surgeons' Hall,
Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have made careful analyses of Pears’
Soap, which I have obtained indiscrimi-
nately at different shops in Edinburgh,
and T can certify to its being a pure and
genuine soap, free from admixture with
any foreign substances, and practically
devoid of causticity. It combines detergent
with emollient properties in a high degree,
and it may therefore be used with great
advantage for toilet and bath purposes,
especially in the case of children and others
whose skin is soft and delicate, and liable
to be affected by the impure and caustio
nature of ordinary soap.”
The tied-hotel question is for the time being a
greater puzzle than ever. The point is this : Monopolist
brewers habitually bind publicans to whom they lend
mone3 T to buy liquors from them only. When the bond
was put in the mortgage deed, the publican was free if he
paid off his mortgage. Now the brewer puts the bond in
a separate deed, and (in N.S.W.) the publican must con-
tinue buying his liquors from the brewer after the mort-
gage is paid. Some months ago English Judge Cozens-
Hardy decided that the tie ceased as soon as the mort-
gage was paid off, but N.S.W. Full Court in Tooth v.
Parkes held the other way soon afterwards. Now the
Cozens-Hardy decision has been upheld by the English
Court of Appeal —the Master of the Rolls going dead
against the N.S.W. Court. The English case is to be car-
ried to the Lords, when, if the other court’s decisions are
upheld, Tooth and Parkes will go to the Privy Council.
Meanwhile, N.S.W. Parliament is to be moved. Watson,
M.L.A., has brought in a measure to abolish the “ tied ”
hotel bond. Meagher, M.L.A., submits another bill to
make the bond a collateral security, to be abolished when
the mortgage is paid off.

Tbe estate of a deceased Sydney undertaker was
recently advertised for sale by tender. There were £1941
of book debts, of which £1524 were classed as bad and
doubtful. In fact, bad and doubtful debts amounted to
much more than half the estate. Apparently, people
can’t afford to die on the cash-system now.

It’s an ill-wind, &c. S.A. Ostrich Co. rejoices
that, owing to the war in S’Africa, prices of feathers have
gone up. All the same, ostrich-farming in Australia
doesn’t seem a short-cut to wealth ; this co.’s profits last
half-year were only £lO4. The farm (up near Port
Augusta) runs at present 525 birds.

One of tbe bad debts of the National Bank
(Melb.) was heard from in a casual fashion, the other day.
The Carmelite (R.C.) Church at Middle Park (Vic.) held a
meeting whereat the faithful were urged to do a big solid
heave, and get the debt lifted, and prevent the tabernacle
being seized by the mortgagee.. The Carmelite establish-
ment, it was mentioned, owed the National Bank £8912
principal and interest, and the bank offered, if £2OOO cash
was paid immediately, to knock £2912 off the debt and
reduce the interest on the other £4OOO to 31 per cent. Pro-
bably the bank will be lucky to get out even on these bad
terms. A foreclosed church is a most unsaleable asset.
The demand for churches is very limited, and many deno-
minations don’t like buying another sect’s left-off church
for fear the other sect’s doctrines should be wandering
about the premises. Also the ordinary business man
won’t buy it for a tailoring establishment, for if he does
pious people get an aversion to him and possibly also to
his 10s. 6d. pants. Some rampant atheists would gladly,
take it over and use it for some discreditable purpose by
way of showing their scorn, but then rampant atheists
never have any money somehow. It is stated, by the
way, that this is the first time a R.C. church in Victoria
has come within measurable distance of being seized by
the mortgagee.

Melbourne .A,e once more gets on, with both
feet, to the awful financial incapacity of Melbourne Metro-
politan Board of Works- the great Fitzgibbon concern.
In 1892, before the smash, and while this country’s credit
was still reasonably good. Chairman Fitzgibbon went to
England to borrow £2,000,000 for the Board. And, after
becoming a joke and a subject of mirth to British
financiers, he managed to sell £1,000,000 worth of the
Board’s 4 per cent, debentures at about £9l 10s., when all
expenses were paid, so the million yielded only £914,708.
It thus cost about £4 7s. 6d. for interest alone, quite apart
from the big sum lost on the original issue. Then
£300,720 of the money was left in the notoriously shaky
City of Melbourne Bank, which perished miserably while
trying to do a second reconstruction. Finally, two years
ago, the Board sold, to some especially lucky individual, pri-
vately and without competition, the debentures issued to it
in satisfaction of its claim against the City of Melb. Bank,
for £35,200. A month later the lucky individual received
a dividend of nearly £15,000 from the bank and he has
now received in all £34,000, while the securities he still
holds are worth £45,600 in the open market. So the securi-
ties which the Fitzgibbon Board sold privately in August,
’9B, for £35,200 have proved to be worth about £79,000.
And even in ’9B it is commonly alleged that they would
have realised £50,000 quite easily if they had been offered
by public competition instead of bhing foolishly traded
away in the dark. And people are saying that the Mel-
bourne Fitzgibbonolitan Bard of Works has shown itself
such an unspeakable bungler at every stage of the business
that it can’t possibly get the sack too soon.

province’s wheat was at one time the world’s best for
flour-making) that it new' sells for from 50s. to 60s. per
ton less than best Manitoba product. The S.A. Parlia-
ment is considering means to bring about a recovery.
Experimental plots for grain-crossing, &c., in different

W. H. Williamson to The Bulletin, from Cook-
town, under date July 23 : —“Having been in Papua for
the last 12 months, I should like to point out that the
Yodda Valley rush ought never to have been proclaimed a
f oldfield, the prospecting-claims being payable only with
lack labor —and very poor at that. Prices on the field
are : Meat, 2s. 6d. per tin ; milk, 2s. 3d. per tin ; bacon,
3s. 6d. per lb. ; flour, 2s. per lb. ; so that, at 4 or sdwt. a
day, it is only a ‘ storekeepers’ rush.’ The sickness and
mortality are also great. As regards black labor, you have
to pay £6 per head for 6 months ; yet on Woodlark ‘ boys ’
are to be had for £3 per head. The way some of the
storekeepers starve and ill-use (heir ‘ niggers ’ is shameful,
though if a digger were to.do this he would be arrested
immediately. We want a new Governor over here.
M’Gregor was bad enough, but this one is worse ; and, as
the granting of leases is optional with him, Fatman mostly
scores. As regards the mining-regulations, the best of
the Queensland provisions have been altered : and, though
we are supposed to be under Q. regulations in regard to
dredging-areas, they do not come into force until Nov.
next.”
* * * *
Dear Bulletin. —Would not advise diggers to
come to New Guinea at present until a permanent field is
discovered, which will never be in this water-worn
country. Alluvial gold here is conspicuously patchy—a
gully here and another 50 miles away. Every gully is
being rushed and over-rushed by the men here, and
worked out before you hear about it. The two new
rushes are poor and only capable of carrying a few men,
both being practically worked-out by this. Carriage to
Yodda Valley is 2s. per lb. and the field is too poor for
that, men'barely earning tucker. As the whole Island
and all gullies and rivers are mostly standing on end. any
gold that ever was in the country in out in the sea now.
—Yours, Kiriwina, Tamata, 8.N.G., 23/6, ’OO.

The Queensland river does not take kindly to
dredging. The bottom is unsuitable, rock bars and river-
timber too numerous, and the water supply of a nature
too astqundingly sudden and yet retiring. The incipient
Q. boom, therefore, like the young masher’s moustache,
-refuses to grow. -Some local optimists are sticking to
their graft, but in almost every instance their case is a
hopeless one. Apparently they mistake river-dredging
for ierial navigation or submarine mining. Kyrle Bellow’s
renowned claim on the Palmer will share the common
fate ; for even where there is gold there’s not the quantity
of alluvial; and the river banks are made of living rock.
By the bve, the th4atrical-cuwt-mining authority just
quoted is alluded to among Northern diggers a»‘‘Ourly
Billy."

The big Calumet and Hecla, the boss producer
of the Lake Superior (U.S.) copper mines, has had a fire
in its underground timbers. This is the mine’s fourth
big fire, and it, like all the others, was discovered on a
Sunday. Also all the fires that have occurred in the
similarly-timbered Broken Hill mines have been found on
Sunday; and neither in 'Murka nor here has the
origin of a single one of them been ascertained. Perhaps
of more practical value it is to know that in fighting the
fire in the Calumet, though one man was smothered and
others injured Dy fumes, “a specially devised oxygen
apparatus for resuscitating workmen overcome by
gas or powder-smoke ” was used for the first time with
great success ; so Minister Fegan might add to his glory
by finding out what the alleged new apparatus is stuffed
with. The Broken llill Prop., by the way, the scene of
the biggest of Australian mine fires, has now its own fire-
superintendent (specially trained for the job in Australia
and Europe), engines, and chemical apparatus. But in
its case the chance of fire underground has been reduced
70 per cent, or so by the comparatively new plan of
filling the worked-out ground with mullock, and
taking out the timber when the mullock has formed a
sufficiently solid support—though, of course, it can’t all
be extracted. The co.’s timber bill last half-year was
£13,109 ; there was a time when, with no greater extrac-
tion of ore, it ran up to £120,000.

The way of the syndicator is hard, sometimes.
Four of him up North, t’other week, struck a sweet
thing— 730 z. silver and traces of gold per ton from a trial
crushing. But their map or their surveyor was wrong,
and the financial institution that really owned the land
fired them out in record time after grabbing proceeds of
crushing.

There might yet be a rush, emulating Cape
Nome migrations, to the Antarctic. Says Borchgrevink:
“ We made the important discovery that York Island is
cut from East to West by a belt of quartz. I nave every
confidence that minerals of great value occur in the
vicinity, and under the influence of this incentive, it is
Erobable that in future Antarctic explorations will not
ein want of financial support. Officially I took
Eossession of the island for Sir George Mew lies. Geikie
and, which we visited, is also rich in minerals.” Since
when did “ Sir George Newnes ” assume Royal pre-
rogatives ? Another case of snavelling “ Tit-bits ” 1

Pritchard Morgan writes thusly, in the British
Australasian, re Chinese and Corean concessions : “ The
deposits (in Szechuan) yield about l£oz. to the ton. The
gold, remarkably pure, is worth about £4 3s. 4d. an oz.
The native miners work it as alluvial, grinding it between
two flat stones. It takes 80 men to crush a ton of ore in
a day in that way. Labor is cheap and abundant. Good
native miners can be had at Is. a day, and two will do as
much as a white. We pay the Emperor 25 per cent, of
the profits. The province of Szechuen is near the Thibetan
frontier. It is quite advanced and peaceable, and there
are no Boxers for a thousand miles.”

Croydon (Q.) tinfield is attracting much atten-
tion. It was recently visited by Mr. Reid, of the Chillagoe
Co., who says it is hot sufficiently developed yet to war-
rant opinion, but declares the ore free from refractory
ingredients, and some of it really good. Several claims
are under offer to Melb. capitalists. Fresh holdings are
being taken up every week. Development proceeding
slowly but surelv, miners being determined to prove their
ground. Govt, promises subsidy for erection of battery
to help development later on, provided that meanwhile
private enterprise does not supply mills and smelters,
which is likely.

Associated, W.A. : Director Waddington de-
fends himself in London by a circular to the shareholders
issued just before the annual meeting. He declines to
resign at the bidding of a noisy few ; declares he has lost'
heavily over the slump, and still retains a large interest
in the co. which he is anxious to safeguard. Insinuates
that the directors have been the victims of a conspiracy
on the part of local management, who shipped poor sul-
phides in defiance of the Board’s advice. Now it is about
time this alleged conspiracy was sifted to the bottom.
The mine has had a number of bad clean-ups, but not one
as bad as this clean-up would be. It is alleged, on the
other hand, that the- Board advised the shipping of poor
sulphides the moment the manager’s back was turned on
his way to meet them in London. Anyhow, it is remark-
able that although the manager has been in London dur-
ing the last six months, and there has been a good deal of
senseless talk of directors’ innocence and the manager's
guilt, it has all ended right there. From what writer
hears in quarters very well informed indeed, the Asso-
ciated directors simply dare not prosecute the ex-manager
or his assistants.
« • *■ *
The quantity of sulphides now treated per week
at the “ Barrier ” compares favorably with the output of
any silver-lead mining field in the world. The difficulty
in treatment of sulphides is being successfully grappled
with mainly owing to improved systems of mechanical
“dressing.” In this the Luhrig Vanner plays a very
prominent part. A large number of these machines are
now in use there, and fresh orders are still being given to
the agents, Messrs. \V. and J. Lempriere, Melbourne. The
South Mine people are remodelling their mill on up-to-
date lines, and will install twelve or more Luhrig Vanners
of the 1900 pattern. The British Go. is also erecting
more of these superior machines.*

Cosmopolitan, Westralia.— Mr. R. Hoffmann,
one of the directors, lately cabled London : “Am sur-
prised at the magnitude of the concern. Mine looks
splendid. There seems every prospect of Altona opening
up splendidly New incline shaft perfect in every respect.
With new machinery profit may be expected to be not
less than £200,00) per annum.” This is a remarkably fine
mine, but not quite so great as that cable indicates. It is
bung boomed in London papers, so writer takes it that
the Bewick-Moreing crowd has some move on. In all the
descriptions not a line is given to the prospector Miller
who opened this mine and stuck to it in the face of much
tribulation and repeated disappointments. It should be
a constant div.-paver with the new mill. The erection of
the present old dilapidated one was a serious mistake for
which the mine has had to suffer. An old stamp-mill on
a new mine is usually a mistake anywhere ; on isolated
Westralian gold-mines, such as this, always.
He Shouted for Help.
It was not for pleasure that Mr. Wilson concluded
to take a walk in his garden ; it was rather an ex-
periment than an act of recreation.. And, griev-
ous to relate, the result was against him. The
fact is, he had hardly covered a hundred feet of
ground before he stopped, gave a choking gasp,
and then sang out for help. His wife and two
sons came to the rescue, and got him indoors as
best they were able. And that ended his going
alone for six months or more.
By trade Mr. Wilson is a carpenter, one of the
most useful, peaceful and respectable of all the
forms of industry. He has lived and worked for
a long time at Given Terrace, Paddington, Bris-
bane, Queensland, and lives there still. About
four years ago—or it will be by the time this gets
into print—Mr. Wilson began to feel himself much
less of a man than he used to be ; he was breaking
down.
The first thing he noticed was that when he set
out to walk a fairish distance, which he would have
done once with a kit of tools on his back without
minding it—l say, when he set out to tramp this,
he found his legs were weak, and he often had to
stop for breath. And he kept on getting worse.
Such a state of things was almost as bad for a car-
penter as it would have been for a postman.
Both these vocations demand good legs and good
wind.
On being consulted, the doctor said, “ Mr.
Wilson, your heart is so weak it can scarcely pump
the blood through your body, and your whole sys-
tem is out of order. There is no chance of your
getting sound again, and the sooner you lay aside
your saws and hammers the longer you are likely
to live.”
These were plain words, to be sure, but not
words which a patient would feel like paying out
money to listen to. All the same, friend Wilson
did as the doctor said, because he had no choice.
He couldn’t work, and so, naturally, he didn’t.
His chisels grew dull, but not so dull as their
owner. He left off making chips and shavings,
and went in for drugs and regrets—a bad land-
slide for him.
After about half a year of this sort of thing,
Mr. Wilson made up his mind to find out for him-
self if he was in fact so poor a stick of human
timber as the medical man had declared him to
be ; hence the experimental walk in the garden
already described. For six months more he was
like a ship in a dry dock, of no use to himself or
anybody els 3. The doctor had measured up the
carpenter’s complaint to an eighth of an inch, but
as for cur ini/ it, why, that he made no pretence of
doing.
“ About this time,” says Mr. Wilson in a letter
dated Sept. 22nd, 1899, “ Mr. Frank Percival
Peacock, of Manning Street, South Brisbane,
urged me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup ; he said
he was sure it would help me. I didn’t think so,
but I tried it. To my surprise and delight, it
enabled me to get about in three weeks, and in six
tuee.iS I went hack to work; and have had splendid
health ever since.
“ As I am 61 years old it wasn’t the rebound of
youthful elasticity that saved me; it was Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and nothing else. lam known to
nearly all the people of this neighbourhood, who
can vouch for the truth of my statement.” —
H. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson’s ailment was of the digestion —the
heart and lung troubles being functional symp-
toms of that. When the stomach was made right
he picked up his saw.

BUSINESS
SACRIFICES.
How often we read of a flourishing business for sale on
account of the ill-health of the owner. He has been so
absorbed in his fight for wealth that he' has forgotten another ac-
count that needs balancing —his health account. Kidney troubles are slowly, but
surely, dragging thousands of men and women to the grave. It is only backache at first,
doesn’t amount to much they think. Then come headaches, dizzy spells, urinary troubles, diabetes,
and then, if it is isn’t checked, Bright’s disease and Heath. What might have been a brilliant, useful career is
ended. Hard work and worry —principally worry —are bound to cause nervous depressions and a consequent failing of
the entire system. To overcome this condition the body must be built up by restoring healthy kidneys. Keep your blood
pure, and your system in good order by using

and good health is yours. Plenty of Sydney proof that this is so.
Mr. J. J. Schuh, tobacconist, of 773 George-
street, this city, says : “My business requires me
to be almost constantly on my feet, and necessi-
tates also a gre.it amount of stooping. This sort
of thing affected my kidneys. The first symp-
toms were occasional pains in the small of the
back. They gradually grew in severity to a con-
stant ache that impeded my movements. Then
came rheumatic pains which caused me much
misery. But lam thankful to say that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have rectified the kidney
trouble and completely cured me of this terrible
backache.”
The above statement was given a year ago in
substance. Mr. Schuh was recently interviewed
by our representative, and after a cordial greeting
Mr. Schuh said : “I wish to reiterate the state-
ment previously made by me, and T will add that
after a lapse of one year I have had no recurrence
of the rheumatism or kidney trouble. The cure
in my ease was a perfect one, and I cannot recom-
mend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills too highly.”
Mr. William Carroll, an ex-railway guard, of
749 Harris-street, Ultimo, this city, writes:—“l
strained myself in pushing some heavy trucks,
and soon noticed the effect in the small of my
back. For three solid months I was unable to do
any work, and was laid up. I had a very lame
back, and a dull pain through the loins and
kidneys, and the secretions became unnatural and
irregular. My physician advised Turkish baths.
I took them and received some small benefit, but
not sufficient to enable me to work properly. I
procured some of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and used them ; I found wonderful relief, so much
so that l am now able to do heavy work as of old
in a thorough manner. I might mention that it is
a year ago since I took these pills, and I have not
been troubled with my back or kidneys since,
which firmly convinces me that Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are . a true kidney remedy, and I
never fail to recommend them among my friends.”
Mr. F. Florence, 208 Alfred-street, North
Sydney, says:—“More than a year ago I took
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for a backache
which had been giving me a lot of bother for some
months. It came on in the first place through
weak kidneys, 1 believe. My back was so bad that
I could not stand straight or do any work, and I
began to think I was crippled. I procured a box
of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at Newman's
Pharmacy, King-street. They were not recom-
mended to me, but the name seemed promising
and suitable to my case. lam glad to be able to
inform you that tins medicine soon effected a cure,
the first few doses giving me almost complete re-
lief. It is a wonder to me at my age that lam
not troubled more with backache than I am, but
I suppose that the pills have put my kidneys in
perfect order. I can work and move my back as
freely as I could in my young days.”
Mrs. Spear, 32 G-oodsell-st., St. Peters, this city,
says : —“ For a good while I was in a pretty bad
state with my back. This was a dull, constant
ache about the kidneys. Sometimes-it was much
worse than others, when I moved the pains becom-
ing very bad indeed, more particularly when I
stooped. It was a most distressing complaint,
and I did not like the thought occurring to me that
this sort of thing often lasts a lifetime, yet such is
the case. Almost a year ago I heard of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and resolved to try them
for my ailment, so procured some at Newman’s
Pharmacy, King-st. lam very pleased indeed to
inform you that they cured me. I’ve never had
the pains return since I used them. I gave some
of these pills to a relation, who has derived as
much benefit through taking them as I have. I
am very glad to be able to state these simple facts
since it may lead to others getting benefit from
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

The Sword of Genghis Khan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From the mouths of western rivers—Danube,
Thames, Rhine, Seine, and Shannon —
Battle-ships are pointing eastward where man’s
blood for vengeance cries.
All the western ports are busy loading men and
loading cannon,
For the Mongol has awakened, and all Europe
must arise ;
Must arise and league for safety—every other
strife must die,
For the ancient Dragon flaming biddeth forth the
Yellow man ;
He has done with sloth and sleeping while the
centuries drift by—
’Ware the Mongol and the Tartar and the sword
of Genghis Khan !
He has lain in sullen torpor while the countless
ages ran,
But the West may call the East-man as it called
in days of yore ;
And we mayhap have touched the end of our
allotted span ;
Are over-ripe and rotting just as they who went
before.
Have we reached the bounds of progress and the
barriers of thought ?
Drained the fountain of our being under Nature’s
changeless ban ?
Has our history been written, have our greatest
deeds been wrought,
And shall Barbarism find us in the Sword of
Genghis Khan ?
How the millions tread on millions ! —can we hope
to stem the tide ?
Fierce and cruel and revengeful with a deadly
debt to pay;
We have roused a sleeping devil with our greed
and with our pride,
With a keen eye for examples, and a mind to
learn our way.
With our itching palm stretched to him, with our
cannon on his shore,
With our Bible-preachers shouting in the holy
traders’ van,
We smote his gods and pockets with a practised
stroke and sore—
Till the angry East unsheathes again the sword of
Genghis Khan.
Though our time be not concluded on the dial of
the nations,
Though in union strong and dreadful we shall see
the Mongol hurled
From his eminence of terror, bound in iron limi-
tations ;
From our blows he’ll reel to scatter through the
wide ways of the world.
Ever Battle is the gateway up through which the
Mongol goes;
Past the shattered walls of China flies the endless
Yellow van,
To the outer nations marching (who shall bide the
. curse that grows)
’ Ware the Mongol and the Tartar and the Curse of
Genghis Khan !

Creith’s Luck.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were three of us diniug in Ning-po—
Rogers, Creith, and myself (Adams).
I had lately arrived in China to study the tea-
trade, and had run across an old school chum—
Rogers—who had also asked Creith, a third man
from the same school, to his villa in the English
quarter.
Naturally enough our talk turned after a while
to old days, and incident chased incident across
the table.
“ I say, Creith,” I remarked, “ do you remem-
ber old Father Cotter taking up a collection on
behalf of the Chinese missions, the time he asked
us all to bring a half-crown apiece to purchase a
Chinese baby for Christianising.”
“What’s that? I don’t remember,” Rogers
struck in.
“I do, though,” Creith said, “ I remember giv-
ing my half-crown, and a terrible lot it did seem
in those days, although I’ve known them scarcer
since.”
At the Jesuit College in Melbourne old Father
Cotter had explained to us the circumstances
which attended the obtaining of Chinese recruits
to the True Faith. It appeared that the mothers
in the Flowery Land, with a kindly forethought
of the ills that flesh is heir to, often cast their
offspring on the bosom of the river ; not because
mother or child likes it, but as a matter of neces-
sity as well as convenience. So little do the
mothers like the custom, that they will, on pay-
ment of a couple of shillings, deliver up to the first
bidder the slant-eyed squaller, to be turned into a
Christian, Turk, Hindoo, or what you will. A
stranger would think that the children might as
well be given away for nothing as thrown into the
water, but in default of the florin, the mothers
prefer to cause a dearth of babies; they flatly
refuse to flood the market with a low-priced
article.
However, while two shillings was the ruling
rate, the Catholic fathers, with their usual acu-
men, were willing to give an extra sixpence for
healthy and pedigreed specimens. In this way,
by making the Catholic Chinese the pick of the
basket, they hoped to extend their influence in
China, let alone in Heaven.
“ I hope your half-crown’s worth is still alive,”
I remarked. “ It is a handy thing to own a live
man ; even a Chinaman.”
“ But,” put in Rogers, “I don’t remember any-
thing about it.”
So I told him what I have just told you.
“And did you fork out 2s. 6d. to buy some
Chinese kiddy from a grave, where he would pro-
bably have been a deal happier than he is to-
day ? ”
“ Creith did ; he was a nabob then. But Cotter
said, you must remember, that if we couldn’t run
half-a-crown, five of us might go together as a
syndicate, and, for sixpence each, own a China-
man among the lot of us. I only own a filth of a
Chinaman, but Creith here has a whole one.
The talk turned to the general principle under-
lying mission-work.
“To take a concrete case,” said Rogers,
“ Creith here has saved the life of a Chinaman—
owns him, you might say. With the misery and
poverty and degradation you see everywhere
around, I wager anything that that Chinaman is
now leading a miserable existence, when only for
Creith’s meddling half-crown he would be enjoying
—well, Lethe.”
“ Would you have the English mothers in a
Whitechapel slum, which is quite as bad as a
Chinese town, allowed to murder their offspring
in that manner ?”
“ I say this, if you could find Creith’s Chinaman,
and ask him if he were grateful or not, he would,
if he spoke truth, say ‘ No.’ You must take the
victim’s view of it. He can’t be glad he is saved
for a life of wretchedness, especially when he is
only part-owner of himself. I wonder does Creith
think he owns the lot of him, or if he looks on it
as a partnership concern, he providing the capital
and the Chinaman maintaining the property.”
Creith was waking to an interest in his posses-
sion. He had never before realised his awful
responsibility.
“ Why not get in one of Rogers’ servants and
put the question to him, taking his decision as
final ?”
We had each of us had just enough wine to
make us hail Creith’s suggestion with applause.
“All right, we’ll get in Ling; he is a most
fluent speaker,” and Rogers, having rung the bell,
directed Ling to be summoned. Presently he
appeared, just the same as so many millions of
others of his race.
“Ling,” said Rogers to the solemn slant-eyes,
‘ ‘ we want your opinion on a certain point. ’
Ling nodded.
“ This gentleman, many years ago, paid money
to a priest to save a babv from your river—might
have been you, even. Now, we want you to tell
us if you think Mr. Creith did a good or a bad
action in saving this baby from drowning.”
“I was not saved from the river. But my
foster-brother He stopped.
“ Well, Mr. Creith saved your foster-brother
from the river. Put it that way. Do you blame
or praise him ? Don’t be afraid; say what you
think.”
Ling’s eyes gleamed. They left Rogers and
rested on me with a curious and uncomfortable
malignity, which made me sit up in my chair.
The orbs turned to Creith, and glistened in their
placid yellow setting.
“ You Mr. Creith?” *
“Yes.”
“You saved the life of my brother?,”
“ 0 yes, certainly ; I bought him.”
“Quite sure?”
“Yes, Ling, that’s all right,” broke in Rogers,
humoring him, with an amu3ed glance at us.
“ Mr. Creith saved your brother’s life, and we
want your opinion on his action.”
Ling still regarded Creith ; then he smiled, and
relapsed into vacancy.
. “ Take too long,” lie murmured.
“ Never mind its length, tell it any way you
like.”
“A story?” /
“ All right, a story if you like,” said Rogers.
His eyes again roamed over the three of us, and
again settled on Creith.
“Iwas small,” he began, “when the English
priest came to my mother’s dwelling. He gave
her a baby to keep. He promised a tael every
month for two years. Baby was reared with
me, and we were all the same as brothers. I
looked after him and loved him. I think he loved
me, too, but not so much as I loved him.
“We grew up. I was older —two, three, four
years. We got a boat, and ferried on the river.
We got rich.
“ I was promised to marry Ku-To. Her father
sold umbrellas in Sum To, across the river. I saw
her every day, and every night when we stop
work. We were going to be married soon ; she
was Christian, like me.”
“You are no Christian,” said Rogers.
“ I was.” His eyes again reverted to Creith.
Ling was interesting us. He went on.
“Once I took my brother to see Ku-To. She
smiled at him, and I think it was because he mv
brother. He goes again and often and I think
Ku-To is good to bother with my brother.
“ I go one day up the river in the boat of Han
Lo. I leave my brother to ferry by himself. I
come back in two days and my brother not in. I
think he is to Ku-To, and go across the river.
Our boat was not there, and I don’t find Ku-To.
Then they tell me my brother run away with. Ku-
To and my boat. I look for him, but not find
him. If I find him I kill him, but I think he is
o-one over the sea alid I will not see him again. I
think, ‘ Why did that priest save him ? I would
be happy only for that.’ And you paid the priest
to save him to do this to me ! ”
His eyes were still venomously fixed on Creith.
“Ling,” began Rogers. But Ling waved his
hand and backed towards the door, his eyes still
on Creith. “You saved him. I kill you ! ”
A decanter overturned as Rogers jumped up,
but the Mongolian had fled. Rogers raged through
the servants’ quarters, angrily ordering a search
for him, but Ling had disappeared as a tarantula
in a crack. , . '
Rogers returned. “Let’s have another glass,’
said Creith, nervously ; “that fellow frightened
the wits out of me. I hope he didn’t mean it.”
“Oh, no ; he doesn’t mean it in the slightest.
We’ll make it all right with him in the morning.
I would like to down him for his impudence,
though.” But Rogers looked slightly serious.
I got up.
“lam going your way, Adams,” said Creith.
“And I’ll stroll part of the way with you,” added
Rogers, catching my eye.
Presently he got me out of the room.
“Be careful of Creith, you never know, what
these devils may do. It will be all right in the
morning, if we can find Ling then, and let him
know it was a stupid jest of ours.”
We arrived at Creith’s hotel, and the three
parted.
I heard a confusion downstairs shortly after
dawn. Slow, foreboding steps sounded up the
stairs, and Rogers entered my room with a face
which made me sit-up.
“ Adams—Creith was stabbed last night in his
sleep!

What will be practically a new religious
order in the Church of England will shortly start
existence in the Bourlce district of N.S.W. The
order is to consist of English immigrants, lay and
clerical, who will devote themselves to teaching
Anglicanism under the guidance of the local
bishop. They will live about on farms and at
stations as guests of residents. All will be single
men—for a time.

The same remarks that apply to milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a fine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few, we are
pleased to say, only a few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is satisfactory
to know that these are getting less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only |d. per lb. It would pay consumers well to give six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, send yOlir orders to US, and we will deliver it at your doors.
Good butter such as we have described is appreciated always, whereas at afternoon teas or for ordinary use bad butter is dear
at any price. The famous “Berry” brand Pasteurised butter can be obtained only from this Company.
