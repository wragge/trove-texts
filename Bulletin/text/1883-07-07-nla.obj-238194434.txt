SATURDAY, JULY 7, 1883.
Lawyers and Journalists.
Mr. Owen, Q.C., created, we are told, some
amusement by remarking that, if the news-
papers went on as they have been doing,
they would soon have to be suppressed.
Their conduct, said this lawyer, had been
most reprehensible. His Honor Mr. Justice
Faucett had given the cue by regretting
that the Press had commented as it had done
upon the case of Mason and Another versus
Watson and Another. The occasion w as the
granting of a rule calling upon the success-
ful plaintiffs to show cause why a new trial
should not be granted. The suggestion of
“suppression” was possibly Mr. Owen’s idea
of ‘ wholesome fun.” That sort of jocularity
has been so highly extolled by Mr. Darkey,
Q.C., and Mr. Owen had been declared by
Judge Innes such a master of humour, that
itseeras quite probable he, as Mr. Watson’s
counsel, felt it incumbent upon him to sus-
tain his reputation for forensic jocularity—
always within canonical limits. But Mr.
Owen’s fun fitted so neatly with his own
and Judge Faucett’s seriousness, that it be-
comes as difficult in this instance to distin-
guish his jest from his earnestness, as it was
on the occasion which earned for him the
critical encomia of Sir George Innes to
recognise the subtle wit which ticked that
easily amused dignitary. It is not easy to
recognise either the humor or the wholesome-
ness of a suggestion that there should be a
curtailment of the already desperately re-
stricted rights of the Press to comment upon
matters of public interest. Mr. Owen’s wit
has the same sobering and saddening effect
as the weekly coruscations of the author of
“Shandridan Papers” in the Tribune. We
wonder whether it would be grossly libellous
to accuse Mr. Owen of being the author of
these dismal lucubrations. We observe
that our contemporaries treat Mr. Owen’s
remarks as a serious expression of
opinion. We prefer to regard them as the
emanation of a heavy humour, stimulated
into ordinary friskiness by the encomia of
the appreciative Jo. We are unwilling to
believe that any educated man could evince,
in this year of grace eighteen hundred and
eighty-three, so much inboru Icve for the
dead-and-gone tyranny of a century ago, as
to wish to restore the Press disabilities which
were in vogue in the days of our grand-
fathers. It would, perhaps, be scarcely deli-
cate to speak of grant 1 fathers at all in con-
nection with some persons in this community,
who seem to have the servility of the
prisoner blended with the arrogance of the
warder, bred in their very bones. In the
present instance there is no occasion for
nicety in this respect, but the iuea is worthy
of general attention. It seems to furnish
about the only philosophical or physiological
explanation of the circumstance that, in
New South Wales, there exists a stronger
disposition on the part of men in authority,
and privileged guilds, to chafe at the barriers
to i ascality on the one hand and to uncon-
trolled power on the other, than can be
discovered in any other part of the British
dominions.
# • *
We don’t affirm that it is only scoundrels
in fact or in inclination who resent the free
discussions of the newspapers. The disposi-
tion may be discovered on the part of very
worthy members of society. There are men
whose whole lives have been devoted to
honest endeavours to do their duty honestly;
and it might be supposed that no such men
would be found in the ranks of the enemies
of a Free Press, But, unfortunately, from
whatever cause, the contrary is true. While
doing their duty fearlessly and well, it has
befallen that aome such men have been misre-
presented and censured, on totally unsustain-
able grounds. They have been held up to
obloquy and derision when they knew that
they merited the thanks and applause of the
■community. We don’t know of any parti-
cular instance. But we do know by the
inductive process that such cases must have
been. While the Press ranges freely over
the surface of events and draws current
deductions from ephemeral combinations of
acts and appearances, it is inevitable that
there must be occasional false inferences
| and unmerited aspersions. That these should
rankle is natural enough. But the point is
this: A man may be good without being
great. A worthy man of narrow calibre is
apt to resent an injustice to himself and to
magnify his own grievance until it shuts out
his vision of all else. A great and good man
recognises his own place in the social
economy much better, and is able to recog-
nise that it is not for him to rage and repine
because called upou to experience in every
particular the common lot of men—and
verbs—to be, to do, and to suffer. Such a
man would never for an hour let his own
resentments or pique obscure his sense of the
general principle that it were better he
passed his whole existence misunderstood and
maligned, his virtue painted as vice, than
that society as a whole should be deprived
of one jot of the grand advantages derived
from the free and untrammelled discussion
from every point of view of public men and
public measures. The Press is a human
institution. Its voice is the utterance of mere
men, fallible like their fellows, subject to all
the imperfections of humanity, liable to
the distorting influence of prejudice, the
embitterments of spleen, and the blinding
effects of passion. But as a rule the utter-
ances of any considerable newspaper are
intelligent and honest. Whatever point
of view a matter is treated from, the
delineation is usually that of an artist.
Newspaj)er proprietors seek intelligence
in the open market, and for their em-
ployment men generally are preferred
in proportion to their proved ability.
A fool may stumble into an editorial position
now and again, but he can’t hold his ground
any more than a pretentious fraud can do
“ leading business ” on the stage. A news-
paper man’s work, like an actor’s efforts, is
always m evidence, and perpetually under-
going public criticism. The influence of a
newspaper is, almost universally, propor-
tionate to the ability with which it expresses
its views. One need not go outside of Sydney
to learn that a journal conducted without
talent languishes, and secures but a limited
hearing and consideration. In this way a
newspaper is a representative of public
opinion. According as its opinions harmon-
ize in a greater or less degree with those of
the public, its influence is great or small.
People will not persist in supporting a news-
paper which offends their sense, or irritates
their minds by inculcating opinions anta-
gonistic to their convictions.
* * *
There is really only one power which can
in a free community “ suppress” any insti-
tution. And that power is vested in the
people at large. Neither the Bench nor the
Bar possess the requisite authority. They
are themselves mere dependents upon
public toleration or approval. They are
in no sense representative institutions.
In that respect the Press has a distinct
advantage over them. For the Bar to
menace the Press with extinction is not only
an outrage but an absurdity. True, the
heads of the Bar, on their elevation of the
Bench, are now invested with executive
powers to which the Press cannot pretend.
But those powers are a trust. They are
delegated powers, founded upon the free
consent of the community which supports
also the Press. If a question of suppression be
raised, it is a two-edged sword which is
hauled out of the scabbard. The Bench may
wield it for a moment, but at any instant it
is liable to be snatched from that grasp, and
the direction of its strokes reversed by the
real owner, the people. If it came to a
choice of suppression, between the privileged
and non-representative guild of lawyers,
and the unprivileged but representative
open brotherhood of the Press, against
which is it most likely that the master of
both—the public—will turn the edge ? Let
us say that the Press is sometimes wrong;
that its strictures are occasionally mis-
directed, its tone bumptious, and its attacks
scurrilous. It is amenable to the common
law. It cannot shelter behind a caste-privi-
lege. Every man has his remedy. It has
never pretended to more, never pleaded for
more, than the right to claim exemption
from punishment, provided it can show that
its challenged utterances were called forth
by a care for the general welfare, and that
when it smote, it smote not from malicious
private motives, or for gain, but that by
the deserved pain of one, many might
be saved from injury. All it has asked is
that superhuman accuracy be not required
of it—that it be not held accountable for the
exact weight of its blow, provided it be
shown that it struck with reasonable dis-
cretion, with honest purpose, and for the
public good. This is surely no tyranny that
the public would groan under—no curse to
be suppressed as an intolerable evil.
It is easy to conceive how the Press could
become an unbearable infliction deserving
of suppression, sooner or later. Imagine a
league or guild of journalists to be instituted,
hedged around by exclusive and semi-pro-
hibitory barriers, such as made it a close
borough which no man could enter, no matter
what his natural qualifications and aptitude,
unless he submitted to special pupilage and
started with peculiar advantages and oppor-
tunities of easy circumstances in early life.
Suppose that, once within the pale, he was
when exercising his profession specially
exempt from the laws relating to libel and
slander which applied to every other indivi-
dual and class in the community. Suppose
that the only restraint limiting his abuse of
such immunities were such as was imposed
by the interference of veterans of his own
guild, elevated to positions of distinction
within it, but always allied to it by a life of
journalism and a retrospective sympathy.
And suppose, in continuation, that in lieu of
being bound by every consideration sacred
and secular—by the force of public opinion
and terror of legal penalties, and the influ-
ence of self-respect—to plead only causes
which he truly believed to be honest and
true, he were to announce himself a public
prostitute, for sale to the first sufficient
bidder. What, then, could he reply to a
threat of suppression ? What could he oppose
to a rising of general scorn and abhorence?
He, whose opinions were purchasable, who
stood in the public market ticketed with a
price; for sale to any knave who brought
money—money stained with blood,* soiled
with fraud, sweating with oppression, or

The traditions of the Press are such that a
creature of thp kind would be scouted from
its ranks. The public expect from journal-
ists a higher standard of principle and self-
respect, aud the journal which sold its in-
fluence aud talent would soon have no in-
fluence to sell. But what would be infamous
in a journalist, is no disgrace to a lawyer.
The traditions of the legal profession are not
so elevated as to make it an infamy for a
man to hire himself to serve the cause of
vice and chicanery. If the question be
raised, which shall be suppressed—a Press
which advocates only that which it believes
to be just and true, and assails only that
which it believes to bo pernicious, or Courts
which clothe themselves with the name of
justice, but deal in legal lotteries, in which
only one thing is ever certain, that is, that
the keepers of the tables secure a fat per-
centage of the stakes; which will the public
be likely to extinguish ?
One Farthing—and Costs.
The jury in the case Davies v. Harris
awarded the plaintiff one farthing, that
being their estimate of the injury sustained
by the distinguished plaintiff by the allega-
tions of the defendant — that he, John
Davies, C.M.G., had, in fact, obtained certain
moneys by false pretences. His Honor the
Judge has supplemented this verdict by a
decision that in addition to the farthing, the
defendant shall pay all the costs of the trial
—probably a couple of thousand pounds.
This is the second time that a similar ver-
dict, given under nearly identical condi-
tions, has been practically set aside by
the Judge who presided at the trial. The
contention of the Bench on the previous
occasion was that all it had to consider was
whether the ease was a proper one to be
heard in the Supreme Court. If that were
so, the Judge had no option but to give costs.
By what legal refinement this is reconciled
with the fact that, in Victoria, Judge Wil-
liams, in the case of Hunt v. Syme, where a
verdict for a farthing was given, refused to
certify for costs, we don’t care to inquire.
The broad fact is what concerns the public.
The administration of the law in this colony
has come to such a pass that the amount of
a verdict is in many cases of minor import-
ance to a decision respecting costs. A jury
may decide one thing, and the presiding
Judge immediately give a decision which
practically reverses the verdict of the jury.
The real anxiety in a bogus case of slander
or libel is not terminated by the verdict. It
only then commences. The grand considera-
tion is, who shall pay the lawyers?
• •
But, supposing It to be granted that the
ruling relative to costs is governed by the
consideration whether a suit was a proper
one to bring into the Supreme Court, still
there are anomalies. We have, for instance,
a distinguished man, at one time or other
leader in numerous associations, one of the
people’s representatives in Pailiament and
in a Metropolitan Corporation, a man select ed
for honour by his Sovereign. He is assailed
by rumours as numerous and varied in de-
tail as they are uniform in their tenor—
that tenor being to ascribe to him con-
duct and proceedings which would cast dis-
grace upon the meanest gutter-snipe. Of
these floating aspersions, one or two are
definitely and publicly stated as open accu-
sations by another mao also occupying public
station. Here we have surely a case for the
highest tribunal in the land. The defendant
thinks so, apparently ; for, on being brought
to Court, he requires more than the or-
dinary tribunal. He is not satisfied with
the special characters of the Court,
but demands also a special jury. So far,
and throughout the trial, everything is
momentous aud solemn. But the jury sud-
denly change the tune. They are appealed
to “ in the name of the Prophet,” and their
verdict is “ Figs !” They estimate the dam-
age done at one farthing! This creates a
dilemma. On the one hand it seems clear
that the Supreme Court is the proper tri-
bunal to deal with so grand a thing as the
reputation of a distinguished public man.
But on the other, it equally seems clear that
the Supreme Court is not the proper tribunal
to be occupied with a dispute about farthing-
worths.
• • •
It strikes us that there is a very easy way
out of the dilemma, if judges would only
condescend to the level of ordinary mortals,
aud allow then - oobwebbed intellects to be
swept by the broom of common sense. And
there is nothing revolutionary about the
means of escape wo have in view. It is
simply that the verdict of the jury should be
accepted as deciding whether a ease was a
proper one to bring before the Supreme
Court. To a certain extent, this plan is
already recognised and in actual practice.
If a vet’diet be given for an amount exceed-
ing AiIO, costs go with Mie verdict as a matter
of courso. There seems no reason why there
should not be fixed a sum, or a proportion
of the amount sued for, a verdict for less
than which would involve the payment of
their own costs by each of the parties to a
suit.
• • •
Reviewing a few of the points, we see that
a case may at the outset appear one proper
for trial in the Supreme Court. We see,
also, that when the broad issues are stated,
the propriety of having the case dealt with
by the highest tribunal possible seems in-
controvertible. And finally, we discover
that in the end, after the time of the court
has been occupied perhaps for weeks, a de-
cision of the jury may put quite a different
face upon matters, and distinctly settle that
the injury, or whatever has been the subject
of proceedings, has been either pretty fully
deserved, or trumpery. A public reputation
may appear a very big thing till investiga-
tion has pricked it, and then everybody may
discover that it was but a bladder. It really
seems that when owners of bladder-reputa-
tions impose them upon the Supreme Court
as substantial realities, they obtain the at-
tention of the Court on false pretences, aud
embezzle its time, which should be given to
matters of more real solidity. When a man
thrusts his affairs and drags another into
the Supreme Court, it should be distinctly
provided that he does so at his own risk, and
that if he has grossly exaggerated the im-
portance of his grievance, or absurdly over-
estimated the extent of his injury, he should
at least be made to pay his own costs, As
the practice now exists, under the benign and
sagacious guidance of Sir W. Manning aud
Sir J. G. Innes, backed by Sir James Martin*
there are cases in which it is impossible for a
jury to do justice, strive how they may. The
weight of the award lies outside their vex*-
diet, aud beyond their control. They can-
not, for example, give a verdict which will
tally with their belief that a ease is probably
true but “ not proven,” or that both parties
are equally to blame. The nearest approach
they can make to this is a verdict for a plain-
tiff for one farthing. If they go a farthing
better for the defendant, by giving him a
clear verdict, they know that the plaintiff
will certainly have to pay all costs. And, as
matters are managed by our Judges, if they
give him the farthing the Judge steps in and
makes it, in fact, a verdict for thousands
of pounds. This condition of affairs is an
enormity, and degrades our highest court to
a place where, in sora i suits for slander or
libel, justice cannot by any possibility be
done—a place where the only thing worth
contending about is who shall pay the
lawyers’ fees ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Dig at Marsh.
When an action of a high official is taken without
any appearance of initiative, and especially when
it is an eccentricity and altogether a departure
from regular grooves, the public reasonably infer
that a motive power has been at work below
the surface of things- It i« thus that the Premier’s
extraordinary departure with respect to My
Marsh, Stipendiary Magistrate, and in relation to
the fine inflicted by that officer in open Court upon
Moore, the Botanical Gardener, has given rise
to considerable speculation. The case created
a good deal of interest at the time it came before
Mr. Maush, and must be fresh in many memories.
Mr. Moore, the Curator of the Public Gardens,
was summoned to answer a charge of having used,
towards a visitor to the Gardens, language cal-
culated to occasion a breach of the peace*
Mr. Moore had come across this visitor with
his wife leaning in his arms, and had in-
stantly ass. med that he had before him an in-
stance of larrikin indecorum. His accost was
toned accordingly. The person thus addressed,
however, swore that his wife had been attacked
with indisposition, and he deposed to the use by
Mr. Moore of expressions the employment of
which seemed to indicate that the Curator was not
above combatting larrikins with their own lingual
weapons. On the evidence before him, Mr. Marsh
inflicted a fine upon Mr. Moore, who was defended
by Mr. Edmunds, a young barrister. The Colonial
Secretary appears to have been induced to take
the extraordinary course of inviting this same Mr.
Edmunds to sit in judgment upon Mr. Marsh, and
when, as might have been expected, the lawyer
reported that his client had been unjustly con-
demned, Mr. Stuart went to the extreme of
endorsing this opinion with a strong expression of
acquiescence, thus conveying a direct censure of
the magistrate. This proceeding is so unprece-
dented that the public is quite curious to learn
what may have been the potent reason which
influenced the Premier of the colony to select for
special treatment of this particular sort one among
the hundreds of cases disposed of by Mr. Marsh in
the period which elapsed since Mr. Stuart acceded
to office. It is to bo expected that some member
of Parliament will ask for information when the
Assembly again meets.
Gosford Geese.
Gosford seems a place quite too small for the
great men who inhabit it. Among these is, or
was, a bailiff of the Small Debts Court, who, being
discovered in the arms of a young woman, was
dismissed from his important position—in the
Service. The young woman, abashed, made for
the river, was apparently intercepted, and was
charged with an attempt to commit suicide. The
two magistrates on the bench, after offering bail
if an uncle would take the young woman away,
refused it when tendered by a more distant rela-
tive backed by the local schoolmaster. The last
named promptly reported the bench to the
Minister for Justice, by telegram. The Min ster
prudently declined to interfere. Next the bench
got level with the schoolmaster by reporting him,
through the medium of the Police Magistrate, who
had been absent during the hearing of the case,
and who is cruel enough to refer to the Evening
News as “ a scurrilous Sydney paper.” (Mem.: A
scurrilous paper is a paper which one doesn’t like.)
The Police Magistrate’s report was referred to the
District Inspector attached to the Education De-
partment, who, after calling upon the school-
master for an explanation, reported that the
trouble was probably an outcome of prior un-
pleasantness between the schoolmaster and one of
the magistrates, due to the former having sus-
pended the magistrate’s son from attendance, in
consequence of repeated insolence and insubordi-
nation. The Inspector further stated that the
schoolmaster enjoyed wide-spread and sincere
esteem in the district, owing to his manliness,
courtesy, and kindness of heart, and that his inter-
esting himself on behalf of the unhappy girl was
quite In accordance with that reputation. Here
the matter stood, until the schoolmaster wrote,
asking permission to take legal steps with regard
to the Police Magistrate’s statements. Then the
trouble broke out afresh. The Police Magistrate
was called upon for a fresh report which he supplied
in a voluminous missive, remarkable for embodying
assumptions that it is net voluminous but vir-
tuously brief, and for sav vgci'y pitching into the
schoolmaster as “a very o ocr.ted, restless, self-
taught man, illiterate even for a village school-
master, with an apparon m ufia for writing and
rashly intermeddling, a v->t uteer tribune of the
people, and constantly i : r.-A water.” There is
also a broad limit that the * •U u and fierce advo-
cacy of the man -(the sea'• •’•mister named)—is a

with animosity, and is r* -.orf numerous by a
statement that tb<? schooln. rte I* a “ very offen-

appears that the P.M. is a vrr.v superior and

Great excitement at the Literary Institute,
Braidwood, seven members having called a meet-
ing, for the fifth time, to close the reading-room
on Sunday. Of course, they wore defeated. It's
very strange that these super-pious people are so
dull; they can never see that the world is daily
losing its old superstitions.
Near Braidwood are five of the original
proprietors of the soli of N.S.W. They have their
ancient jins w ; th them. We spell it with a j, be-
cause the English people have got into the habit of
pronouncing them with a hard g. The jokers have
called one “Mr. Hunt,” and another “Mr. Wal-
lace.” But both gentlemen are in indigent circum-
stances—one of them too thin to move, the other
blind. The Aborigines' Protector has undertaken to
furnish them with an allowance somewhat short of

II., or St. James to Arabi Pasha. Jt runs: 81b. flour,

How did Alfred miss this? Last Saturday
night a fearful, and it was once feared fatal, acci-
dent happened to the Parramatta train. Owing to
some unaccountable negligence on the part of the
authorities the 10’30 p.m. train from Sydney arrived
in the “ oldest city ” punctually at its proper time.
Of course, this unusual occurrence caused the
greatest consternation nmorivst the inhabitants;
but by dint of superhuman exertions matters have
since been rectified, and now the trains run just as
late as ever. Old King, the “ Flying Pieman, once
matched himself to carry a sheep and walk to
Parramatta before the steamer, and he won by 11
minutes. Wouldn’t he snigger in his shroud to-day
if someone matched him to run the train?
The Hermaoos Penitente*. a new Mexican
sect, numbering about 3000, have this year been
purifying themselves by torture. We quote a
single paragraph from a long account. A march
of half-naked men and women was being performed
under the stimulus of raw bull-hide whips: —“ Dur-
ing the march not a groan was heard nor a word
spoken; but just before reaching the goal, a small
adobe hut, an ordeal was encountered which tried
the nerves of the boldest. For some distance
before the door cactus plants had boon thickly
strewed upon the ground, and, as the barefooted
cross-bearers approached it, one hesitated. In-
stantly half a dozen whips descended upon his
bare shoulders, and with a bound he sprang into
the thorny plants, his every step ’’d the footsteps
of his followers being marked wit ‘od. As the
torture grew more terrible, the chan w louder
and the thongs fell with morevigoui. • • hing

of mortification of the flesh ?

Our old friend “The Vagabond” is again

Mr. John Murphy, late M.P.for Monaro, died a few
days ago near Bombala—Mrs. James Brown, who
recently died near Wagga, at a great age, had seen
a curious sight. Long ago, her husband kept a
circus, and one day a committee bought one ot his
horses to carry in triumph a newly-elected member
of Parliament at Beech worth. To magnify the
triumph, the horse was actually shod and ridden
with tour solid golden shoes. Mrs. Brown had
them for some years, but turned 'hem into coin
when the wolf peeped in at her door.

We have several sugges-
tions to make concerning the
“Sr Wo are living near it
now. at Manly Beach, and wo
anve been struck with the
immense amount of force
there la going to waste on tho
beach all day long. As a spec-
tacle? we consider the se a has
been overrated; though at
Hmes it deserves considerable
credit. At noon on a clear day,
when the sun sets a diamond
m the crest of every wave,
the sea is quite a respectable
sight; Butat night, when the
skies are moonless, it takes a
terrible guise. Then the great
Sw breakers come blunder-
fog shoreward, as if with the
intent to drag out with them
and drown in the black deeps
t?ery living thing upon the
shore. And the white fringe
nf ghostly foam along the
coast looks then like the sea
grinding its teeth in rage at
having missed its victims. At
such times, if it is not too late,
we always go and take a drink
tn Rteadv our nerves. But,
talking of the waste of force,
what a splendid idea it would
be to build a fence right in
the middle of the breakers,
and hang soiled linen on it!
The dash of the waves would
wash the linen, and the gay
laundress could in the mean-
time be coquetting on the
Corso with the owner ot the
linen, who had come out really
to watch it, but ostensibly
with the purpose of inhaling
ozone. This is not all, however.
We would propose to make
the sea musical. It sings its
own song in an uncultivated
kind of way as it is, but we
would suggest that it should
be made to play it own ac-
companiment. This would be
an easy matter. J ust lay rows
of pipes along the shore on
the mouth-organ principle,
and the thing is done. We are
pleased to see that the Manly
municipality have laid one
such pipe already. And then,
again, what a mighty innova-
tion it would be to convey the
sound of the surge through a
huge telephone, and use it as a
background for the music of
such an oratorio as—say, the
“ Creation!” We know that we
are parting with wealth at
every sentence in giving away
these ideas gratuitously, but
we don’t care. We are weary
of wealth. We are tired ot
fame. All we want now is to
see D. B. W. Sladen once
and die. Oh, and before we
finish, we must tell you that
we suggested this notion of
utilising the wave-force to a
local Edison. He acted upon
it in quite an ingenious man-
ner. He made a little surf-boat,
fixed a ring in a rock about
twenty yards above high-water
mark, got apiece of rope about
a hundred yards long, tied one
end to the ring and the other
to the boat, and then proposed
to let the latter out for surf-
rides at sixpence a time. The
underwash would, of course,
carry it out, and the inward
rush would carry it in. We
went down to the beach to see
him try the machine. He said
he was confident of success,
but he wanted us to make the
first trip. We thought this,
however, belonged of right to
the inventor, and told him so,
which view of the case he
finally agreed with. Before
starting, he informed us that
he reckoned to be able to make
money enough to bo able to
retire upon with the concern.
The result showed that he was
right. He retired so far that
we have never seen him since.
He is probably somewhere
around tho South Pole by this
time. We have a lot more
ideas of this kind. We are
keeping them for the benefit
of bailiffs.
A prominent citizen —of course not any [
Sydney man—has lately joined the Blue Ribbon
Army, and he wears Its embleni conspicu-
ously in his sinister button-hole. The natural
result of such an operation has manifested itself
only too quickly. He associates with , despises
water, and sedulously cultivates an abnormal
appetite for fermented liquors. But, though on
the whole, the remonstrances of friends have been
successfully resisted, and a state of chronic semi-
inebrity happily attained, a lurking dread has em-
bittered the merriest cup. Our friend with an
enlarged experience, with childish ignorancesd dis-
pelled, with the Eternal Verities standing or try-
mg to stand right by his elbow, feels a shadow
looming in front —a grisly phantom —an unpleas-
ant companion—a restless agitator— D.I., m tact,
otherwise known as jim-jams. Coming home not
long ago, after an extra convivial evening, he
waded upstairs, unsteadily opened the bedroom
door, and was able to divine intuitively, rather
than distinguish intelligently, that the gas-light
was turned down very low, and that the sharer of
bis couch, and of his joys and sorrows, but not ot
bis jim-jams, was between the sheets. So tar,
then, he had grasped actualities. Suddenly our
triend felt something slippery and wriggly under-
foot. He looked down. His long-abiding fear had at
fast assumed tangible shape I He saw it. He felt
it. He scrunched, a number 14 bopt round on the
carpet, but the slimy thing twisted itself about the
uppers and threatened to embrace his ancle. 1 here
could bo no mistake ! He heard the gurgling hiss
which marks the properly-developed serpent.
Maria 1 Maria !” he roared, “ I’ve got ’em at last !

enough to wake a congreg itlon. She sat up in
bed and gazed reproachfully at the lurid bacchanal.
“I’ve got ’em, Maria, my dear ; I’ve got ’em at
last 1 ” “What have you got?” quoth Maria,
beginning to feet alarmed. “ Snakes ! Snakes I
See ! See ! Got up and smash him. See !” Maria
arose, considerably undressed, and found the
bedroom poker. Then she advanced. “Now,
what Is It?” “Oh, Maria, I’ve got ’em!
Snakes ! Simses 1” Maria came near, tremblingly.
“ Hit him, Maria I Smash him, Maria I Break his
back, Maria 1” “ Why, you fool,” rejoined Maria,
after a moment’s inspection, ‘ you’re treading on
the tube of baby’s feeding-bottle!” And so he was.

In answer to numerous enquiries, we may
mention that the correct way of spelling the name
of the first mouth of the year is J-a-n-u-a-r-y, not
Jancry as Or. Johnson has it, nor Jannury as
Webster prints it, nor Jannuerrey as Dr. Arnold
used to spell it. It takes its name from Janus,
who was a two-faced Homan deity. He presided
over the beginning of everything, and was always
invoked first, even before Jupiter, who was a sort
of Lord Mayor of all the gods. Janus also presided
over gates—but not over railings,—especially dur-
ing tne time of shows or triumphal processions;
hence ho was also surnamod Patulcws, or “the
opener,” and Cluslus, or “the shutter.” On the
festival days of this two-faced deity the people
made presents of sweetmeats, fruit—especially
oranges,— copper and iron coins, rings, and costly
head-wreaths. The sacrifices offered to Janus con-
sisted of Janual (a sort of cake, or bun), fruit, and
wine—probably unfermented. He was a great god
in those days, but the only use his statues are put
to now is lo ornament out door-scrapers—to em-
bellish the things on which we wipe our feet.

The Judges, it is alleged, held a corro-
boree as to the expediency of hauling up the
Sydney Echo for contempt of court re its remarks
on the summing-up of Judge limes in the Ander-
son libel-case. If the Supreme Court wants some
good cues for contempt, it had better look up the
country papers. Mudgee has a journal which is
scandalously irreverent. Thus
“ But on North Shore a wonder, lo!
That this of old surpasses—
Two steeds more just than Holy Joe
And his twelve special asses!
What else expect but sickening shocks
And Snufllebusting fudges;
With shoddy asses in the box
And canting windbags judges ?”
How is it that the country press is allowed to
write in this Insolent way ? How is it that the
judges take no notice of the bucolic miscreants
who alternate shingle - splitting and milking
cows with turning the handle of the double
demy which thus foully slanders the grandest in-
tellect that ever adorned the judicial bench ?

A very big divorce case comes on in Mel-
bourne shortly. It id all the fault ot the injured
husband, who, they say, broke the compact not to
take legal proceedings. The particulars of the
case will, of course, now be ventilated in the
Divorce Court, but we are afraid the following
authentic story in connection with this matter will t
not come out there. It is a pity it should be lost,
s > here it is:— It was on a Saturday afternoon in
May, 1880, when the husband arrived from a coun-
try trip. The servant whispered something, and
the face of her master turned livid with rage. His
spouse was about to receive him with a hearty
welcome, when “ho drew himself up full length,”
and with dramatic gesture indicated to her None
me tangere. The scene which followed was exciting.
She confessed, so he says, and so also it is stated
in the document signed by her subsequently. He
left the house mad with rage and jealousy. Dined
that evening in town, and then went to the Opera
House. To his surprise, the Lothario was there.
Imagine the husband's feelings. He went out and
had refreshments, and scarcely was he again seated
when he heard revolver-shots. Screams, excite-
ment, confusion. Three bleeding persons lay in
the dress-circle —two men and a women. It was
the Grcer-Soudry tragedy which had just been
enacted. The case was on all-fours with his own.
The husband was out of his senses for the moment.
Ho fumbled mechanically in his pockets, but there
was no loaded revolver there. Else there would
have been another tragedy that memorable even-
ing, and more expense to the proprietors in getting
new coverings for blood-stained seats and carpets.
History does repeat Itself occasionally ; but it
would have been rather the quickest on record had
our hero had a revolver with him that Saturday
night.
On the last day of 1882, a lunatic who had
boon in the Dunedin Asylum for llfty years, gave
j a ball and supper to the other inmates. Dr. Rone
know him well enough to permit all the others,
except the violent ones, to attend. It was a Bel-
shazzar’s feast for style and plenty, and the group-
! ing was such as was never before seen in the world.
On the host’s right sat a man who believed he was
a King, He had a crown of pasteboard and Kolu-
noors of broken tumblers. Alongside his plate was
| laid his sceptre—a piece of broom-handle. On the
left sat a conspicuous figure. He had for twenty
years believed he was dead. He never ate in the
presence of others, and slept in a coffin specially
designed by himself. He never spoke to anyone.
In ms right eye was fixed a half-crown, but he kept
the other open—knowing not how to trust the
dead. Another was an Elephant, and would have
space around him. They had to take a door off its
hinges, because he believed he couldn’t pass
through, and as he used his nose for a trunk, that
■organ became decidedly more high-toned than his
manners. Julius Ctesar was there, and now and
then would get up, gather his toga round him,
and fall under the conspirators’ daggers, and then
get up and fall to his dish. The Messiah cheerily
took a glass of wine with another Messiah, and the
Czar of Russia passed the salt to Noah with a
friendly enquiry how he was getting on with the
old ark. At the ball the orchestra was immense.
( Three or tour wore dress-suits, but the first
violin dressed in his own true character of
I Paganini. Shakespeare handled the double-bass,
and in the intervals of the dance handed in lemon-
I ade to the Queen ot Damascus, or Mary Queen ot
Scots. The Lmjt of tho Mohicans trod a war dance?
and bishops and monarchs became sane enough to
clutch their scalps. And when the strains rose
higher, and knights of chivalry and queens whirled
round, then the Dead Man, wrapped in a new
shroua, would fasten in his half-crown firmly, and
stalk amidst them to “ fix them with his glittering
eye,” now and then brushing his ears or his sound
eye, or poking a mournful finger into his mouth,
to clear away the dust. The Professor stood the
whole evening looking into the bowl of a new
spoon, and reflecting on the aberration of light as
his face became long or broad by holding the bowl
in different positions. The genial host moved
everywhere. The Immortal Man expressed strong
hopes that ho would have the pleasure of cele-
brating many more half centuries in that insti-
tution, while the Dead Man was so overcome with
his feelings that ho nearly spoke. As it was, the
half-crown fell out of his eye, and in the confusion
of his grief at so nearly relapsing into life, ho rc-
flxod it in the wrong eye. At the conclusion, all
uncovered to “God Save the Queen,” except the
Queens of FIJI, China, India, and Palestine.

Years ago Sydney Smith
(the Canon, not the Macquarie
popgun), doubting the practi-
cability ot introducing trial by
Jury into New South Wales,
thus imagined a few of the
excuses that might be made by
anyone summoned as a juror:
—“I cannot come because the
waters of the Hawkesbury
are out, and 1 have a mile to
swim; the convicts have
robbed mo; ray little boy has
been bitten by an ornlthoryn-
chus paradoxus; I have sent
a man 50 miles with a bag of
Hour to buy a pair of breeches
for the assizes, and he is not
returned.” The jocose Canon
never thought ot an alligator
being put forward as an ex-
cuse, and yet read this extract
from a North Queensland ex-
change:—“A juror, who would
be one ot the very last in the
Cook district to shirk his duty,
objects to being summoned to
attend court at the risk of his
life. Ho lives at the southern
side of the Annan river, and
every one well knows that
there are times when an alli-
gator renders it almost suicidal
to cross over to the north. Mr.
Justice Cooper accepted an
excuse based on the above
grounds, and remitted the
line he had indicted without a
correct knowledge of the cir-
cumstances.”
We have heard about the Emperor
Austria’s travelling altar, and how it is carried

would be thought of him in Heaven if he wexe to
say his prayers on the bare ground, like a common
sinner f But we know a man who combines plea-
sure and prayer far better than this. He just says
his prayers in a vapour bath; loses no time, and
gains eternity at the one stroke. j

somewhat curious that on the very same week that
he left the gaol, his accomplished son, Dr. Louis

the business at Pentridge Prison, which he divides
with Dr. Stewart, his brother-in-law.
Archibald Forbes, commencing next Mon-

Then he is going to Washington to get married,
when he may have an opportunity of listening to a
few lectures; and if he should ever return, the

Cardinal Czacki, who lately got the hat, is
only 49 years of age. The present Pope likes to
have young fellows about him. This hat-giving
suggests a philo'ogical speculation to us. When
Pope Alexander VI. wanted to raise money, he—so
historians say—used to make a cardinal. The car-
dinal always paid for the honour. Shortly after
that, he would die suddenly. Then His Holiness
would make another cardinal to fill the vacancy.
The theory we have to offer is that this custom
was the origin of the phrase, “passing round the
hat.”
It is said that when the charming Emelie
sued the triumvirate for eighteen hundred, the
verdict for the nine hundred was a heavy and un-
expected jar for the defendants. Garner was very
despondent, but Jimmy Williamson, who always
takes a bright view, comforted him by whispering:
“ Never mind, old man; we've got well out of it.

The principal mover in the expulsion of
Marks Hermann from his office as President of the
East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, was Mr.

The fraternity have made a dean set against the
Hkbald for exposing their transactions, and Mr.
Marks Hermann has been just up to move for a
rule to attacb the publisher of that newspaper, old
Ignatius Peigl, woo, it may be remembered, had
one of his hands taken off by machinery some years
ago. Well, the joke of the whole affair is that
Ignatius, whom they are trying to send to gaol, is
himself a money-lender in Richmond, where his
wife runs a pawhbroking establishment.
So the half-caste Maori heiress has been
caught at last. A couple of weeks ago the banns
of marriage wore pronounced between Mr. Moor-
house, son of the late Superintendent of Canter-
bury, and Miss Rhodes, daughter of the late
Captain Rhodes. Miss Rhodes, who visited Sydney
some time ago, is worth at least half a million—in
fact, a judgment of over £400,000 was. some time
ago, given in her favour by the N.Z. Supreme
Court and uphold on appeal by the Judicial Com-
mittee of the Privy Council. The marriage will
shortly eventuate, at Wellington, N.Z., and the
surroundings will, in the words of the theatre bills,
on a scale of magnificence never before attempted
in Maoriland.
Mr. Brough Smyth, who was for many
years permanent head of the Victorian Mining
Department, and who had to resign after an en-
quiry into charges of cruelty brought against him
by his subordinates, has now settled down in his
new position as director of the Sandhurst School
of Mines. After his resignation in Victoria, he
went to India, and received an appointment as
Inspector of Gold Mines. His glowing descriptions
of the auriferous prospects of the Indian mines
induced English capitalists to float companies, and
they lost their money. When he returned to Vic-
toria, he wrote reports for the Argus on some of
the Victorian mines; then he received his present
appointment at the hands of the O’Loghlen Gov-
ernment. Complaints against him are again rife
among his underlings at the School of Mines.
A certain bishop was travelling from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, the other day, and in he rail-
way carriage struck up a conversation with a
fellow-passenger—asked him, among a variety of
other things, whether he was a good churchman.
“ Not particularly—but always sent his wife and
youngsters, &c. &c., supported the church, paid up
the necessary dues, and so on.” Notic ng that his
friend had met with an accident, the good prelate
ventured to remark that such things were some-
times blessings in disguise. “ Very probably.”
replied the bishop’s fellow-traveller, who was a
bushman and had broken his leg. “ Hadn't been
to church for seven years until I went to hoar the
Bishop of Northern Queensland eight weeks ago
Next day I broke my leg.”
Old Tom Boyd, the only survivor of the
first exploring party which crossed the Murray, lias
had a great deal of trouble with his family. But
this is not his only misfortune. He does not now
own a single hoof, and a few months ago he built a
hut on a reserve from which he has now been
ordered to remove. The principal cause of his
downfall was an impounding match between him
aricTan adjoining squatter which nearly “ broke ”
both of them. The squatter was allowed compen-
sation for land taken from him by selectors, but
Boyd, not knowing that he possessed all the inti-
mate and enthusiastic friends who showed up at
the Albury banquet, didn’t apply for—or, at any
rate, wasn’t awarded—any solatium, though the
whole of his run had been selected.
Herbert Spencer has, on account oC ill
health, abandoned his projected visit to Australia.
It was his wish to spend some time in the colonies,
with a view to collecting materials for the com-
pletion of his great system of philosophy. He has
for some years employed a number of specialists
on Indian and American subjects. They supply
him with accurate accounts of the old civilisations,
and he marshals the information into his system.
It w ll bo some years before his system will be
complete. So far, he has covered nearly the whole
field of modern scientific research, and has reached
to the middle of his great work on Sociology.
Three or four volumes on the Principles of
Morality will form the completion of a work that
has already given him a name that can range up
alongside Plato or Aristotle.
Peter M'Mahon, whom the Ballarat Justices
fined recently for imbibing too much poteen, turns
out to be the oldest British soldier on record; in
fact, he was born a soldier. H is father was a ser-
geant in the 88th Connaught Rangers, and whilst
stationed in the Royal Barracks, Dublin, his wife
gave birth to Peter. As soon as ho was able to
carry and beat a drum, he was taken as a drummer-
boy in the same regiment, A Post reporter
wanted to know whether Peter had been in a
battle. “Have I been in a battle? Is it whether
I have been in a battle ? What a question I Why,.
I was at Salamanca, Nive, Toulouse, Talavera,
Santerarn, and Waterloo.” Peter then gave a long
description of the last-named battle, and produced
a bullet which hit him in the thigh, and after it.
was extracted has been carrying it about him ever
since. That was the last battle he was in till he*
met a policeman on Soldiers' Hill, Ballarat, the
other day.
The Saltan of Turkey has commenced the*
foundation of a national public library. He has.
ordered all the literary treasures now buried in.
mosques and religious houses to bo sent to Con-
stantinople as the nucleus of the new library-
Among those may be discovered some that may
give the impetus to another classic revival. But.
whether or no. this is very queer conduct for the*
head of that faith of which Omar was an arch-
apostle—O ar, who burnt the grand Alexandrian
library to the ground, saying that if the books that,
were in it disagreed with the Koran, they were
pestilent, and should be burnt; and if they agreed
with it they should be burnt, as being useless. This;
world, we are afraid, is becoming too well educated.
If things go on as they are doing, it will soon be
necessary for the praylng-mantises to turn hod-
carriers.
Charles Bradlaiijgh’s present position is not
so utterly unbearable, or rather, it would not be to
an ordinary unambitious man. For the House of
Commons is the “ best club ” in the world, and he
enjoys all its privileges; he can eat there, drink
there, smoke there, read there, write there, receive-
his friends there, and, whenever he feels inclined,
drop in without the trouble of securing a seat or
attending prayers, and listen to his favourite ora-
tors from one of the most comfortable places in the
House. He is independent of all the whips; he Is.
pursued by no deputations ; he is worried by
no necessity to vote: in short, he tastes all the
sweets and none of the bitters of Parliamentary
life. Many a rich man would give a slice off his
income for an entree to this “ best club ” of th&
greatest city of the world, an entree which no
wealth can buy, and not fret very much because
he couldn’t take part in the debates. But “ ambi-
tion should be made of sterner stuff,” and Charles
is not happy.
Poor old Tawhiao, the Maori king, has had
to start on a pilgrimage around his dominions. He
has eaten out his own proper territory, and has
now to go about, like Lear, billeting himself on
his lieges. Like Lear, too, he has a train of fol-
lowers who put up wherever he puts up. They
now number two hundred very hungry and mira-
culously thirsty Waikatos. Ho looks poor. In-
stead of being every inch a king, he is about three
feet a broken-down sportsman, two feet (his own)
a pile-driver, and the rest of him a bibulous bar-
man. His royal robes, when he is on the march,
consist of a red hunting coat, a mat, and a white
loin-cloth. His legs and feet are bare, and he is
bareheaded. Hut ne is a right royal rum-drinker—
a virtue which endears him to the hearts of his
subjects. And when it comes to the point, wo
don’t know whether most other monarchs who are
beloved by their people could give a sounder
reason for it than poor old Tawhiao.
Sir Arthur Palmer, the present acting
Governor of Queensland, has a pleasant autocratic
way of his own which has made him the object of
lively admiration in Queensland. As an instance
of this we may begin by saying that, near Brisbane,
there is a particularly dangerous level crossing.
It has semaphores at each side, and elaborate
instructions are issued to the gatekeeper with
regard to the prevention of traffic fre m passing
about train time. Very well. Sir Arthur Palmer
wanted to pass one day just as the train was ex-
pected. The gatekeeper, not knowing that the
august eye of His Excellency could awe the engine
with a glance, refused to let him cross the line in
his carriage. For this shocking Irreverence, the
gatekeeper was very properly suspended. And
now the man who was sent to relieve him has been
suspended for the same cause. The third man
knows his duty better. What are trains when an
Acting-Governor wants to pass ? We hope Sir
Arthur won’t getkilled, however—which he might
one of these days if a democratic engine happened
to be coining along when be was crossing. And
then what would become of the country ? We
shudder to think of it.
This is the true biography of Mark Twain,
the archasologist, poet, and astronomer. He is
descended direct from the Twain who were made
one flesh; and he was first born April 1,1728, on a re-
markably cold morning. At an early age he became
addicted to science, and, before he was seven, he
made the valuable discovery that a spring clothes-
pin, carefully applied to the continuation of a cat,
would create in that active animal a strong desire
for immediate foreign travel. At 19, he went
through college. He entered the front door when no
one was looking, kerosened the rector’s favourite
cat, and graduated soon afterwards over the back
fence. After travelling to the four corners of the
earth, including the middle, he began to render
himself famous by that remarkable series of truth-
ful anecdotes which have stanmed him as the true
and heaven-sent successor to George Washington.
As an archaeologist. however, he has gained the
most success, and his collection of Pompeiian.
Egyptian, and early Greek jokes is considered the
most complete in the world. He has been accused
of making some himself, but this is a straight
slander. He has written a brilliant essay on the
political advantages of a “full deck” in playing
“ante-up;” while his exquisite poem entitled
“The Frog bowed down by weight of Shot,” is
considered one of the most pathetic in any lan-
guage, and equal to a good many poems that have
never been printed.
Leopold Jordan fancies he will owe one to
G. R. Sims by the time he reaches London again.
Three years ago Jordan wrote and composed a
comic opera, and called it “The Derby Day.” He
rather prided himself on being the first man to put
racing matters in a comic opera. There was a
bookmakers’ chorus in “The Derby Day,” also a
chorus by jockeys. Messrs. Holt and Wilmot
bought the opera, and sold Australian rights to
Dunning, who may or may not think he secured a
bargain. It was known among professional people
that Jordan had written and sold “ The Derby Day.”
G. H. Sims, among other people, should have known
it very well, because Jordon read the book to him.
Very lately a new comic opera has been produced
in London successfully. It is called “The Merry
Duchess.” G. R. Sims is author of the libretto:
Frederick Clay of the music. Now, curiously
enough, it contains the salient ideas of Jordans
opera, as, for example, the bookmakers’ and
jockeys’ choruses, and the general horsey business
originally Invented by Jordan. This is what
Jordan avers, and he calls Bogus-Pathos-G.-R.-
Dagonet Sims, Esq., far stronger names than we
care about putting down on our scented pink
hand-made paper. Dunning may chip in here-
about, if he chooses, and tells us If ever ho did
hear of Jordan’s “ Derby Day.” On flit that
Jordan has agreed with Moulton and Millis to
travel as their manager and agent.
C. E. Jones, of “ Paschal Lamb and Mint
Sauce” fame, is again before the public as the
champion of the Orangemen of Victoria. Jones is
a tailor by trade and a politician by profession.
Like many other tailors, he rose to bo a member of
the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and a Minister
of the Crown. Unfortunately for him, certain
little bribery transactions, in which he was con-
cerned, were disclosed in 1869, and Jones was
drummed out of the Victorian Forum, He then
disappeared from Victoria and went to the U.S.,
where ho edited a newspaper. It was a failure.
He then tried American politics. He was a failure.
Then he attempted to make a living by lecturing.
This was also a failure. At last he came back to
Victoria, in 1881. He expected that, like the Pro-
digal Son, the fattest calf would be killed for him
on his return, and that he would be taken back
into the House. In this he nearly succeeded, but
the “early voters” at Ballarat were too many for
him, and Pinchara succeeded in tieing him, and
the returning-offleer adminiterod to Jones the coup
de grace by giving the casting vote to Pincham.
Jones talked of an appeal to the Elections and
Qualifications Committee, but here again he found
himself baulked—he had been naturalised as an
American subject, and had failed to return to his
allegiance to the Queen. Having failed to secure
the £300 a year for talking in the Club at the top
of Bourke-street, Jones has been trying to make a
living by blathering to audiences in the provinces
about the Mormons. This is also played out, and
now the loquacious ex-tallor has presented his
talking talent to the Orangemen, and will deliver
his first lecture on the “ Spanish Armada ” on the
12th July, to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne,
A strong posse of police have been ordered down
to the hall to watch events.
The rejection of the Affirmation Bill re-
minds us that there has been for many years a
French Bradlaugh. If the House of Commons
oath were the sesame to the French Senate, Prance
would have been deprived of all the good done by
Victor Schoeloher, He’s 80 years old now, and
since he was 19 he has hated and fought and v an-
quished the “Scribes and Pharisees” of France.
For (50 years he has been a man of unselfish aim
and untiring- effort, a redresser of grievances, a
helper of the desolate, and the emancipator of
French Negro slaves. He has pursued evildoers in
high places with implacable persistency; he claims
“ equal rights ” for women, and has displayed great
personal courage on many occasions. His great
battle -was for the slaves, and, in seeking their
emancipation, he brought down a shower of
national indignation; was treated as an enemy of
his country —as aiming at the destruction of the
French colonies by ruining the planters. But, in
spite of all opposition, he went on, and a clean
sweep was made of slavery, once and for over.
He opposed capital punishment, and got an end
put to Hogging In the array. Schcelcher would
never take an oath, saying “ if a man does not
scruple to tell a lie, no oath will bind him.” And
he is right. For no one can enter a court of law
or a house of Parliament without discerning what
a farce an oath is, so far as conscience is concerned.
Schcelcher is the French Bradlaugh—the “schoel-
cher” of shams. And, when the trumpet-voiced
dauntless Bradlaugh—the man whom the miser-
able twaddling bigot who t cts as London corres-
pondent for the S.M. Herald last week designated
“ that creature Bradlaugh’’—goes into the House
of Commons, he, too, will be a “ schcelcher- ” of
shams, beneath whoso Titan force hypocrisy will
crack like a nut under a Nasmyth hammer. So
keep him out, oh! “ scribes and pharisees.”
Some years ago “Jack” Gardyne—there
was a deal of moaning in the fact that nobody ever
called him “John” Gardyne—was perhaps the
finest man in Sydney. He was as handsome as a
Norse god, 26 years old, six feet two, broad-
shouldered, with a figure and face such as are not
even given to one man in ten thousand. He had
good abilities, was universally popular, was as
generous as he was handsome, and was married, to
an estimable young lady, the daughter of a wealthy
and respected citizen. At the time of his marriage
he was a partner in the well-known hardware firm
of Holdsworth and Gardyne, his connection with
which was severed perhaps a year ago, when he
started business in a much smaller way on his own
account. Affairs may have gone fairly well; but
still Jack Gardyne in his new sphere found the
road of commerce a hard one, and one not alto-
gether suited to the temperament of a man
who could never refuse a favour to either friend
or stranger. To the cares of business were added
anxiety as to the health of his wife, who had long
been seriously ill. Last Thursday Jack Gardyne,
who had not preserved the hardness of condition
which characterised him in his athletic days, was
about town apparently in his usual high spirits.
He did his business, met his friends, and had lunch
at Compagnoni’s; but, in the afternoon, it is said,
some friends of his, at the Sydney Club, saw him
gazing fixedly and long at a picture in an illus-
trated paper of a man holding out a revolver. A
little after four o’clock, his brother, hear-
ing the report of a pistol-shot in “ Jack's ”
office, rushed in and found the latter sitting in a
chair with his head on the table—blood flowing from
his right temple and from a hole behind the left
ear, the point of the fatal bullet’s exit. “Jack”
whs dead. He had deliberately bought at Lasset-
ter’s that very afternoon a bulldog revolver and
fifty cartridges.
Capt. W. E. Armit, R.N., who has gone to
New Guinea in the interests of the Argus, was
formerly an officer of the Queensland native
police. Having kicked over the traces consider-
ably, he and the service bade each other adieu.
Then he wrote for the Australasian a series of
exceedingly readable articles by “A Queensland
Native Police Officer,” including some first-class
alligator and nigger lies. Capt Armit is a good
busnman, a man of science, and the wielder of a
facile pen. “ He goes,” announces the Argus,
“ with instructions and supplies to buy, not to
fight his way ” Young George Morrison, who is
to “explore” New Guinea for the Age, also takes
a commission from the Presbyterian Church of
Victoria, which fact will, we are afraid, consider-
ably discount any chance his articles might other-
wise have hod of creating a sensation. We’ve had
quite enough missionary yarns. We are sick of
the galimatias of the clerical scribes and of the
jeremiads of the keepers of Christian homes for
niggers in the wilderness. Young Morrison
is a plucky fellow who, had he been sent to New
Guinea by “the boys,” instead of being curled up
under the wings of the kirk, would, in all pro-
bability, have reflected a lot of glory on himself
and David Syme. We hope George won’t be eaten.
We also hope that, should ho succeed in gaining
the ear of the principal blackfellow in New G uinea,
he won’t put that worthy up to eat his rival Armit.
George is a pious boy; and as he is a member of
the Y.M.C.A , he will probably neither elope with
the chief’s wife, nor steal his daughter. But if we
were in his place, we’d certainly do our level best
to get the king to chew up the Argus fellow. Cer-
tain ignorant persons have asked now it is that the
S.M. Herald authorities don’t send out a New
Guinea expedition, too. These people must be
unaware of the fact that a majority of the mem-
bers of the Herald staff are now engaged in the
good work of converting the Papuan darkies, and
that a consignment of sanctified blacks will shortly
arrive here to report muffin-worries for the Old
Girl. Nor is Alfred idle. The Town and Kuntry
Jeknel canvasser is already on the war-path—six
shillings a quarter.
As New Guinea yarns are in season, we
give an odd one from a continental paper. The
introduction of the elephant lends a special charm
to it:—“ Particulars have been received of the
circumstances under which Mr. Frank Hatton
(only son of Mr. Joseph Hatton) met his death
while on an expedition of exploration in New
Guinea. Mr. Hatton was conducting an expedi-
tion in an hitherto unexplored district, with a view
to determine the geological character of the
Seguama Kiver and certain; regions of the
Kinabatangan. While proceeding down the
river, Mr. Hatton fired from his boat at an
elephant on the banks and wounded it se-
verely. Leaping ashore with his mandore,
a Malay, he gave chase. The elephant pausing, as
they thought at bay, they returned for reinforce-,
ments. Arming a few of his men with Sniders,
Mr. Hatton led the way into the jungle. The ele-
phant had moved off, and, night coming on, Mr.
Hatton was persuaded to return. While making
his way through the jungle, he raised his rifle to
move an overhanging creeper, stooping at the
same time to pass underneath it. The weapon
became entangled, the muzzle was twisted towards
him, and, the trigger having been pulled by some
twigs or the vine, he was shot. His men wore all
round him in a moment. They caught him as he
fell, and he murmured ‘ Ovodeen,’ his Tutong
boy’s name, as he laid his head upon his shoulder,
lost consciousness, and died. Mr. Beveridge, an
Australian mining expert, arrived on the scene
at the moment, and round the voung scientist’s
dusky followers weeping, Ovodeen having
the deceased’s head upon his kn e. The body
was carried to the boats, and, under the direction
of Mr. Beveridge, eleven of the deceased's fol-
lowers paddled the body in a native ‘gobang,’ or
boat, by river and sea to Sandakan, a distance of
nearly 170 miles, without sleep night or day, over
the unknown river and finally into the sea, coasting
along the north-east shores into the bay of San-
dakan, where they arrived after having pulled for
fifty-three consecutive hours, only resting three
times for half-an-hour to eat a little rice. The
funeral was attended by all the Europeans and by
most of the native and Chinese residents of Elopura.
The body will be exhumed for final interment in
one of the London cemeteries, and is expected to
arrive in England at the end of July or beginning
of August.”
This is a yarn—a rope yarn. Marwood, the
merry gentleman who gives such people as the law
thinks would make nice corpses a graceful send-off
to the cemetery, Avas performing this pleasant
office in Cork for an individual by the name of
Keefe, who murdered his uncle not long ago. After
it was over, the jury who inquested what remained
of Mr. Keefe after Mr. Manvood had done Avith
him requested to see the rope which Mr. Marwood
is in the habit of using on such occasions. This
vulgar curiosity Mr. Marwood very properly re-
fused to gratify, and, in doing so, informed them
that the rope was his private property. For a
thorough appreciation of the necessity of uphold-
ing his official dignity, there is no man that can
compare Avith the hangman—not even the beadle.

in his private capacity. What tales he must
tell of the manner in which the great men

rant their last words wore, and how much small
they had in their pockets before starting!
% i'then again, what fun he must have had in
them when they were on the scaffold,
ind then suddenly letting the drop fall, and leaving
rhoni to have their laugh at his waggery in eternity!
There is something like seasoning in the conversa-
H rn of a man like this. And we believe Mr. Mar-
n'* * 1 is quite as affable and unostentatious as any
'T" orivate gentleman when he is not on public
a Which reminds us that Mr. Up.iohn, the
vietorian hangman, was also noted for ins cheerful
Vivacity in society before a contemplation of the
V iekcdhcss of the world made him misanthropic.

We must be gay sometimes.
Osmond Tearle, the Rignold of America,
and a strikingly handsome actor, earning about
r'inoo a year, has just been divorced fro n his wife,
nrhor suit, on acco mt of a little laxity in Osmond’s
conduct as regards the seventh commandment. A
phief witness against him was one of his own
letters which the wife put into court. Abridging
it somewhat, the substantial parts are certainly
iiaidue —‘ My dear Wife. Let me say at once
what must be said. You must have seen the
breach that was gradually widening between us.
You know perfectly well my feelings towards you
were anything but what they should be. I cannot
lielu it • my life to you has been one of deceit. I
have been unfaithful to you from shortly after our
marriage, which was a fearful mistake. My life has
been wretched in this country. What I told you
in Barrow was false, utterly false. But as the
time approached for rn> arrival in Liverpool, a
feeling of fearful repugnance came to me,
and I had to lie to avoid doing what I could
not—my whole nature abhorred at the mere
thought. Knowing this, it is much better we
should part. Add to this the knowledge that
I love-have loved for two years—another, dearly.
Mv love is such that I am prepared for anything,
so what worth am I to you with another woman s
love in my heart? Our lives would be simply
abiect wretchedness, with an end—God only knows
what I shall send you £300 a year, in £25 every
mouth. You threatened to come over here, did I
not return. It would be exceedingly foolish. This
is a very inhospitable country to women in any
case, and I should necessarily have to be very cruel
to you; besides, I am taking out my papers as an
American citizen, and should then obtain a divorce
—a thing easily procured here with money and
influence—so be sensible. Nothing in the world
can alter this decision. It is irrevocable. I can
never endure the misery I have done. God knows
T suffer as I write this. I have forced myself to it
In the early morning, not being able to sleep. God
help and pity you. But you will be far better with-
out me, I am not, nor never have been, worthy of
you’ try to forget such a wretch ever lived. God
bless and shield you from harm, and should our
marriage tics bo severed, send to you some true one
who will make you as happy in the future as I have
made you miserable in the past. Kiss the children
for me. They are, thank God, in good hands.
Your husband. George.” The Judge decreed that
Mrs. Tearle should receive £400 a year alimony.
\Ve notice, when women desert their children, or
men their wives, they always entrust those dis-
carded encumbrances to the hands of Divine Pro-
vidence, It’s a cheap and convenient method.

— Archbishop Vaughan, has, in all probability, ere

late Martin Shanahan), and lives in Sydney... From
Melbourne Punch:—Louise Michel,the he-woman
Communist, who has just been sentenced to six
years’ imprisonment, “ is the illegitimate daughter
of a French noble and n scullery wench. It is said
that angel and devil are about equally blended in
her character.” No doubt, angelic qualities from

Mrs. Astor, wife of the American Minister at
Home, is a woman of surpassing beauty —Jay
Gould’s expenses on his yacthing tour will be £100

or rather, some people in tact anticipate, that is to
say, Sarah might be temporarily absent from the
stage in August, in consequence of a pleasing
possibility Patchett Martin, who started the
Melbourne Review, is residing in London, devoted
to dramatic matters—At Washington, the Lily
performed as Hester Grazebrook. As she came on,
there was a great buzz of expectation, a quiet
steady stare as the beauty acted, and when she dis-
appeared, “a titter of amused derision was heard
all over the house.” Perhaps the most accom-
plished young Chinaman is Mr. Chin Chi Yung,
Ambassador at Washington, or the “ Flower of
China,” as he is called. He is quite a master of
European styles ef flirtation. One day at a ball, a
young lady remarked he did not dance, sayimr she
supposed the thickness of his soles prevented him.
“ It is not the soles of my feet,” replied the gallant
Chin, “ it is because the soul of my body is chained
to your side.” Quite a willow, willow-waly
pattern piece of young crockery he is... At Devon
(Eng.) has just died a remarkable woman, Mrs.
Robertson. Thirteen years ago, she was seized with
idiopathic gangrene after her accouchement. Six
weeks subsequent y both her legs had to be ampu-
tated to save her life, and 33 days later both hands
were cut off in the hospital. She recovered and
left the hospital, a mere torso, after being there
only 18 weeks And then lived on for 13 years! —
A man who drank a pot of beer in a Liverpool
(Eng.) public-house was taken to the hospital soon
afterwards, racked with pain, and before dying he
admitted having put strychnine in the drink. He
was Hugh Williamson Gladstone, cousin to the
Prime Minister of England.. .The London World,
who ought to know, takes to task a leading Ameri-
can paper for saying of the Lily; “ Her beauty is a
quarter her own, and three-quarters Worth.”
This is absurd. No lady ever owed so little to
dress as Mrs. Langtry. Her first and greatest suc-
cess in England was made, not only in spite of, but
very considerably on account of, the groat sim-
plicity and modesty of her apparel, and she never
used magnificence of dress to attract admiration.
Nor, indeed (until the exigencies of the footlights
rendered, it necessary), did she “make up” like
most women. Her magnificent physical health
rendered cosmetics superfluous; and it was the
very fact of the elastic jerseys—named after her-
self—showing every sinuous, graceful movement
of her supple form, without any meretricious
padding, that made her so irresistibly charming...
Nilsson’s hair is of a peculiar, indescribable colour,
almost an old gold, and her complexion is as fair
and soft as the bloom of the peach. She is thirtv-
nine years old, and yet she has all the spirit, fresh-
ness and piquancy of a young girl. She is queenly
in appearance, majestic in carriage, and is a splen-
did specimen of the perfectly healthy woman,
both in mind and body. She says she is at peace
with the world, and has high hopes of reaching
heaven, and is curious to know whether the angels
will like her singing—Mr. Chenery, editor of the
Times, always carries a revolver in his pocket—
The “curate” trick was tried on Mary Anderson,
the beautiful American actress. She was shown a
photograph representing herself and a man kissing,
and an attempt made to levy blackmail, under
threat of publicity. She, however, took the initia-
tive in exposing the affair herself, and immediately
prosecuted the blackmailers. No sensible man
believes the curate yarn to be true—Oscar Wilde
has had his hair cut I This Is a frozen fact. The
story runs —as told by the Pagan Poet —that Zola
objected to the Absalom-like length of Oscar’s
locks, and declared that if Oscar yearned for his
companionship, Oscar “must to the barber with
them.” Whereupon the shearing took piece. It
is hoped that the poet of the sunflower and velvet
smallclothes will defer his return to London society
until ho can shake the aowdrops from a mane of
normal length. It would be sad to see him in front
of Mr. Frith’s picture in the middle of a crowd that
recognised him not .. Captain Lonsdale, in com-

When the celebrated firm, Priggs and Co.,
otherwise “Uniacke,” flourished in Pitt-street, a
young man arrived from Queensland and adver-
tised in the S.M.H. for a billet. In due course, he
received a letter from Messrs. Priggs, who received
him with great urbanity, and inquired if £300 per
annum would meet his views. The modest youth,
to whom fifteen bob was wealth, thought it would,
and in a moment of enthusiasm formed a resolu-
lution to write to his aunt. “ The firm ” produced
a pretentious ledger, and in silvery tones requested
a preliminary ten shillings, “ just as a matter of
form, you know.” This being forthcoming, the
fortunate young man departed, and is—still wait-
ing for the billet.
Here is a straight tip for bank directors.
It is no hard mutter to see what is the primary
cause of so many bank officials becoming defaulters
—especially up North. Take any northern town as
an example—Herberton, for instance. At Her-
berton, the cheapest rate at which a man can live
in a hotel is three guineas a week, or £163 a year.
There are no private boarding-houses at which a
‘•gentleman” would care about stopping, though
a man of low gregarious tastes might certainly
hang out at a Chinaman’s boarding-house. Yet,
Brisbane banks send clerks—who are expected to
keep up a gentlemanly appearance and behaviour
—up to such a place, and salary them at £130 a
year. Strike the balance for yourself.
Slumber song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Prone by the marge o. that wide walk
Whereon our burgher’s feet are pressed,
While nigh him clacked their ceaseless talk,
He lay at rest.
What though those waters o’er him crawl
Which make the city’s Helicon
And smear his couch ? Unheeding all
He slumbered on.
How free, how fine, how godlike swelled
The outline of his sinewy form!
Like some fair tree before us felled
By some foul storm.
His tawny locks in careless grace
Caught, or appeared to catch, the light,
And flamed around his noble face
An aureole bright.
Pillow’d on one athletic arm
His head reposed; as though a child
Again he felt the holy charm
Of mother mild.
Noon wilted Into shadowy eve;
The stars shone out; the moonshine came;
Dews fell, nor wakening could achieve—
He slept the same.
When Night and Dawn again had met,
Calm ns a cell-enfolded monk.
He slumbered on—he slumbers yet:
He was so drunk.

OLD JULIUS.
Old Julius has got married after travelling
through the world so long with a love-proof
panoply. He was one of those men whom
you would believe you could never mate in
any number of moves. He was a skilled
pawnbroker while he had a pawn to exchange,
and even the tactics of a pair of bishops
could not get him into the embarrassing
position of renouncing his freedom and ac-
cepting a mate. He would entrench himself
behind some castle, and would wink round
knowingly at the company.
It happened at hist, however; and he is
now married. “Mate in three moves!”
cried the by-stauders; and, sure enough,
although he made a half-hearted struggle,
the bishop came down upon him, and his
roving career was over.
“How did it happen 7” asked a few visit-
ing bachelors, who had been absent at the
close of the game. “ How did Edith catch
you 7”
Old Julius was sitting in smoking cap and
shppers, in a broad weather-boarded house,
with an anucapnic lamp burning brightly
before him, and a “ mated-at-last ” look
about him, which, although showing some
lines of subdued emotion and tethered en-
terprise, yet exhibited that tranquillity and
resignation which a brave man who has done
his best always wears. The bravest men are
the calmest under defeat,
“ How did Edith catch you 7” repeated his
old acquaintances. “Did she throw science
at you 7 captivate you with dissertations on
the immensity of the universe, when star
calls to star and is never heard across the
wide floors of eternal space 7 Did she dive
into the profound abyss, deep, deep down,
where the everlasting Nothing dwells in
unspeakable silence, and did she then soar
aloft, beyond the gates of the morning star,
and revel in the dazzling splendours of inex-
tinguishable suns 7 Was that the game Edith
played 7 ’
“No,” replied old Julius, “Edith didn’t
throw science at me. Louisa did that twenty
years ago. Louisa used come up with the
doctrines of Maupertuis on her finger ends,
and used go on about rotundity and atmos-
pheric pressure and a lot of things. I re-
member her very well. She had black hair
and hazel eyes, thin lips and a straight nose.
Mind you, she tickled me. If anyone wanted
atmospheric pressure, Louisa was just his
mark. But atmospheric pressure was not
my style, I played the dolce far niente gam-
bit. and escaped.”
“But how did Edith do i 1 7” cried the
inquisitive friends. “ Did she go in for his-
tory 7 Did she uni old the philosophy of the
Acta Humana to you, and show you that
everything you regarded as a fact was only
a fable? Did she work you back into the
infancy of the world, and reveal to you that
the civilization of our com eraporaries is only
the logical outcome of the sagacity of our
scalp-hunting ancestors 7”
“No,” replied old Julius; “Edith didn’t
throw history at me. Annie did that fifteen
years ago. Annie had read Hume and Lin-
gard, and had Maguall’s Historical Questu us
by heart, and was far gone in the fever
of the new school of history writers, and
could rhapsodise like Michelet and posture
like Lamartine. Since her day I have never
calle l any man a scoundrel, not even if I
caught him with his hand in my pocket or
his knife at my throat. I let some other
body call him a name—for I am quite sure
in fifty years after this some historian
of the new school will prove, from hither-
to unpublished documents, that the man
in question was much maligned, a».d that
all who blamed him in his day were
addle-headed Pecksniffs and irreclaimable
donkeys. About the time of my acquaint-
ance with Annie, my house was robbed. I
caught the fellow as he was getting over the
fence, and. after a smart scuffle, I put him
under. I marched him to the police quarters
under cover of a patent Colt. But, coining
near the place, 1 remembered Annie’s views.
The new school of historians, she had told
me, was growing, and I did not want to go
down to posterity as, in the language of
Froude, a thick-headed Conservative who,
by sluggishness of disposition and inertness
of intellect, was incapable of appreciating
the frank and undisguised sentiments of my
bush Cromwell. So, as I was a little bit
weak on Annie, I let him go. Mind you,
Annie tickled me. She was a tall girl with
a small mouth, a hooped nose, green glasses,
and a headache. But I adopted the <u fresco
defence after dinner, and escaped.”
“How did Edith do it?” persisted the
bachelors. “ Was it religion she opened
with? Did she play off the sad risks to
which the female is subject who wanders
through this vale of tears without a home
and the strong hand of a protector? Did
she attack your front with the cruel-heart-
edness of man, his frivolity and recklessness,
and his deafness and dumbness to the sympa-
thies he has awakened 7 Did she prove from
venerable sources that it is bad for man to
be alone, and did she then rout your flanks
by intimating that one little heart was con-
cerned for you and that only in the virtuous
household true happiness could be found 7”
“No,” replied old Julius. “Edith didn’t
play off religion. Ten years ago there was a
dead set made on me in that way. Sarah
came along with tracts in her pockets and
the Apocalypse in her head. She could prove
anything from that Apocalypse, even to the
tact that I was to marry a pious, virtuous
woman. Mind you, Sarah tickled me. But
when she came the length of bringing in her
own red bead and blue eyes, I responded
with the vamoose gambit, and escaped.”
“ But Edith—how did she manageit, Julius ?
How did she manage it 7 Was it money 7”
“No.”
“Was it beauty 7”
“No.”
“Now, come it, old man,” cried all the
bachelors in chorus. “Give us the move.
You must now, Julius!”
“Well,” replied old Julius, fairly cornered,
“ I’ll tell you. 1 saw Edith one day studying
a Cookery Book, I asked her to prepare a
dinner from it with her own hands, ana she
did it capital, my boys, capital. So 1 married
her.”

POLITICAL POINTS.
The British Under Secretary of State for
the Colonics has declined to advise the Governor
nf New South Wales to increase the reward of
CTOO offered for the solution of the Bermagm
Sivstery. What the deuce has the Under Secre-
tary for the Colonies got to do with advising the
Governor of New South Wales?
PRO-ROGUING.
What comes before roguing ? Proroguing
of course—
And now that the proroguing’s dot e.
So gaily off they go,
And practise just the same old fun.
But, mind, without the pro!
The “Protestant Ascendancy” gag brought
tn bear in Melbourne against Bromby, of 1 asmania,
lecturing in the Town Hall (which had been duly
let to him for the purpose) on “The English in
Ireland.” Mayor Dodgson persuaded to cancel the
arrangement by which Bromby had severed the
Hall. Case of Dodgson and no Fog-a-bam- gh.
Of Mr. Bromby, who has taken up the
cudgels for Mr. Redmond, the Age says Uu proper
thing for the Land League to do would be to snip
him home, freight and duty paid, and inv« iced as
dangerous goods not wanted on the voj ago If he
is an Englishman, he is a disgrace to iIn* name;
and if he is an Irishman, the proper place . or him
is Ireland. Bosh I
The law laid down by Chief Justice Cole-
ridge, in respect of “ Maintenance" in the decision
anent the Bradlaugh v. Newdegate case, holds re-
sponsible all as -eolations of individuals who sub-
scribe to take proceedings against any person;
every speculative lawyer who takes up a case on
the chance of what he can get out of the other
side; and everybody who supports the litigation
of a person who is unable to go to law on his own
account.

“ Why not stick to your Post, Mr. Wright ?
You’d suit better there a blank sight.
In your tirst position
Could arise no suspicion
He your firm and the Works, Mr. Wright, Mr.

Henry Harry Cooke and William Robins
Stone represented Forbes and Parkes at the late
Albury fete. The former is a Mayor and an Orange-
man, and the latter is an ex-Mayor and an ex-
Orangcman. The latter honourable “ ex ” was
accorded Stone because ho refused to give a pig-
vote at the last election at the bidding of the
Lodge in favour of Cooke. William K. Stone
ought to be prouder of this “ex” before, than a
C.M.G. after, his “monniker.”
Lord Reay, it is said, has been offered the
envoyship to the Boers. If Reay is as canny a Scot
us his name, Donald Mackay, would imply, he
won’t go. Sir William Gurdon (whom the Sydney
dailies will call Mr. Guerdon) evidently doesn’t see
it. Fact is it requires a very rare sort of man to
go to South Africa specially to eat humble pie,
and that’s what someone has to go for, since the
song of the Boer, according to a London paper is—
“ My big Bulldog cannot know what he’s about,
He seems in a bit of a fog.
If the dog wore the stronger, he’d rule me, no
doubt.
As it is, I shall just rule the dog.”
So Lord Randolph Churchill has publiclY
accused the Khedive of being the real instigator
of the massacres of Europeans at Alexandria.
Hush-sh-shl It would be altogether inconvenient
to admit the possibility of such a thing. Why, His
Highness is our respected ally. He is the distin-
guished source of honour who formally degraded
that wretch Arabi, and who conferred distinctions
upon Lords Wolscley and Alcester, and our
picked heroes for—hem! w ell,yes—for slaughtering
his people. We decline to believe the story. We
resolutely refuse to listen to such wickedness.
Only think how dismally inconvenient it would be
if we didn’t scream down such allegations!
Who’s afraid? “ Fear,” cried the Czar, “I
know not fear.” The mail nows tells us that at the
emperor’s coronation “slicks, umbrellas, parcels,
even such small ones as are used for sandwiches,
biscuits, and even fruit, will not he permitted. All
the shops will be closed and the proprietoi s guarded
by the military. The owners of houses are strictly
lot-hidden to let rooms or windows to strangers,
and are also responsible for any persons venturing
on the roofs of their houses, which will be guarded
by the military." What satite is the foregoing on
oil the recent telegram, “ that the Czar in the
coronation procession rode alone, without the
slightest fear.”
As everybody knows, the ultra-squatters
of Queensland are opposing M’llwraith s trans-
continental railway scheme. Well, these gentle-
men are real patriots, one of them recently ottered
Government £1,000,000 to secure a gigantic freehold
in Queensland, but M’llwraith refused to transfer
to one man some 4,000,000 of the colony’s best acres.
This clearly evinces the terrible tear of creating
landed monopolies existing in the minds of the
men who have allied themselves to the so-called
Liberal party. They affirm that they do not like
the details of the transcontinental agreement,
when in reality it is the principle they dread. The
principle means to them the resumption of land
for railway purposes—resumptions in a form which
they undoubtedly will not be able to control.
The Echo on the 20th ult., the anniversary
of the Queen’s Accession, did a very big gush in-
deed about Her Gracious Majesty, winding up,
though, with a most pathetic anticlimax. Having
teemed out ladlefuls of melted butter as to her
personal character and so on, it went on to speak
of the growth of he calm, linishing off with—
“And if the voice of re Australian colonies is
sufficiently potent, her e cpire will shortly be still
further increased by anne-cations of Islands to the
north and east of Aust ralia. They might indeed tail
into worse hands.” The italics are purs. They
form the anticlimax referred to. There s some-
thing eminently ridiculous in the idea of heaping
up outrageous praise on a fellow, and then telling
him (or her) that it’s Just possible there may be
worse people in the world!
The Northern Miner, of Charters Towers,
has a fiery article recommending the annexation
of the New Hebrides, albeit it employs plain En-
glish, and terms the necessary raid “buccaneer-
ing.” The Miner says: “There is a general
consensus of opinion in Australia that the annexa-
tion is necessary for the protection of the colonies,
and, it the Homo Government refused to sanction
it, the colonies would be justified in protecting
themselves oven at the sacrifice of the Imperial
connection. It is not improbable that the federa-
tion of the colonies will be precipitated by the
action now taken by Victoria for the annexation
of the Hebrides group. Once those islands are
annexed there is no reason in the world why we
should not extend our conquests and seize upon
the Santa Cruz Islands, the Malaya Islands,
the Solomon Group, and New Britain and
New Ireland, to the east of New Guinea. If
England will not consent to this extension of
territory and consequent responsibility, the united
colonies may undertnk6tko work, and that would
constitute the first act of independence. Popular
feeling in Australia will go in the direction pointed
out by Victoria, and it England should refuse to
go along with the colonies, the question will then
arise, Is the English connection any longer neces-
sary? is it to hamper our onward march, or expose
us to the hazard of foreign menace and danger ? ”
When the First Lord of the Admiralty reads this,
he will most likely order a gunboat to proceed to
Charters Towers, to exercise a “moral miluence”
upon Thady O'Kane. And then ho will learn that
the ship-railway to the Towers has not yet been
completed—that, in tact, no such work has been
begun. And now here’s a cable to the effect that
England won’t let us annex New Guinea. By next
week, we dare say, Thadeus will be locked up for
high treason. # #
Zox, M.L.A., of Melbourne, is not quite
easy in his mind about the Petty business. Wax-
man says: “ 1 have made him a Member of Parlia-
ment, and now I’ll unmake him.”... Handsome
Fred. Cooper, who was so lucky the other dav in
the Victorian matrimonial market, and J. D. Gib-
son, late of the Palmer Chronicle, have an-
nounced themselves as candidates tor Cook, (Q.)

too well to be gulled by his sort sawder.... .Total

Xiie 3. Treasurer, in bis Budget speech on Wed-
nesday last, said that the encouragement given to
settlement in small holdings by deterred payments
and p rpetual leases was considerably affecting the
land revenue by decreasing receipts; but the policy
was good. He also invited discussion of a scheme
for compulsory national insurance... Thus prophe-
sies the London Spectator: “Papua will, within
two generations, be neither English, French, or
(sic) German, but Australian. The Federal Re-
public of Australia is a certainty, and it will claim
Papua, oven if it has to fight Germany or France.”
This is cheery news for our Volunteers. All resig-
nations must be sent in before the Age correspon-
dent sets fire to New Guinea N.S.W. Radical

It is a sign of the times that so respectable
a paper as the Spectator is found writing against
enormous fortunes. Ten years ago it dared not
have done so There is more proverty in New
York than in any city in the world, not excepting
London, and yet at the great ball given by the
Vanderbilts the 800 people present were worth in
the aggregate £110.000,000. Yet we are horrified at
Socialistic demands The Bhinwarries, wo see,
have captured a convoy of munitions, proceeding
from India to Cabul. These Shinwarrn s seem to
need a lot of licking. On the 8th of May they
attacked the Ameer’s troops at Tajiri, and were
beaten w th a loss of 700, yet here they are again.
After Mr. Bradlaugh had stood at the bar of
the Commons delivering his speech, it was found
that the bar could not bo drawn back. It is con-
structed on the telescope principle, and Bradlaugh
had so grasped and shaken It in the course ol his
oration that it had been thrown out of gear....
In Armenia, a plot is said to have been discovered

will made by a Leeds confectioner in favour of
Secularism and Republicanism should be declared
illegal and void, as against public policy. The de-
ceased 44 sweety M man had left considerable sums
to be Invested in forming secularist clubs, lecture
halls &c., at the discretion of his executors, of whom
Charles Bradlaugh was one. The judge declined to
make any order, as he was not prepared to say

Ihe C.M.G. will now adopt anew “ Order,”
doubtless.
Sir George Innes; “Now then, spell January.”
Davies (somewhat “Hurried”): “J-u-s Jan t-i-c-e
nary—January.”
We scout the idea that Mr. John Davies, C.M.G., ever bolted with a bun-fund.
Mr. Davies angrily told me to sit down, and said that if I
was three mayors he would make me sit down.
Alderman Young spoke about Alderman Davies having received a Present of
some iron railings from some Corporation contractors named Bradford.
Mr. Harris said a good deal about having
something in his pocket that would
bring Mr. Davies down. After a care-
ful scrutiny of the contents of Mr.
Harris’ pockets, we failed to find any-
thing calculated to bring Mr. Davies
down, unless it were the small coin seen
above.
A few days after witness was told that his
tender was accepted, he gave Mr. Davies
the ring,
Mr. Woolcott was instructed to make all
necessary preparations for the picnic.
"i ■ 1 11
“ I have something in my pocket that will bring you down from your pedestal.’
■ -— ■ - i

Witness believed he was correctly reported to have said at
a council meeting that “ If it was not for party feeling,
Davies would be in the Soup Kitchen.


BRIEF MENTION.
“Why do not the banks build ?” asks the
Cootamundra Hbrald in a leading article.
Simply because fools build houses for—well, for
ank directors.
’ The Sydney D.T. posted a notice that John
Davies had got £1000 slander damages from Mayor
Harris. The wish was father to the thought.
This is the very latest libel out. Speaking
of the recent Albury shivoo, a ftiverlna Journal
says: “The ‘Press’ was most enthusiastically
drunk." As the Rum has been issued punctually
ever since the opening, we have no hesitation in
saying the above is a perfect George Lord Carter.
An old lily in a Northern township
demurred to t i cing the oath, saying, *• Why can't
I tell the trut i Just as well without swearing ?’’
Poor old simple! Why 1 some of those witnesses in
the Davies-Harris case would take an oath every
minute of the day. Why I one man would take
’em two at a time.
A debt that must be
paid: Bur-dett. (This is a
legal joke, and knocks clients
to “ Smith-ereens.”)
A Melbourne milkman
confessed In court, not long
ago. that he watered his milk.
Which shows how far behind
our milkmen the Melbourne
ones are. Here they merely
milk the water.
An infant three weeks
old, and a fifty pound note,
were lately discovered on a
door-step in St. Kllda- We
will take delivery of an in-
fant every morning at this
rate. We shall afterwards
sub-let them to Mrs. Ander-
son. of the Destitute Boys’
College, to be educated as
journalists.
A Wagga woman writes
to the local Advertiser say-
ing that she wants the branch
of an old gum tree, growing
in one of the streets of that
sylvan city, cut down because
it frightens her at night “ by
its resemblance to the head of
a man.” It is not stated
whether she is an old maid or
a widow, but, evidently she
is not a widow. If she were,
it would be the branch that
would be frightened.
Says the Shroud ;—“The
verdict of the jury in favour
of the Andersons must be
regarded as an expression of
popular dislike of the manner
in which it was sought to
crush an Institution which,
with all its defective manage-
ment, contained the germs of
something better, of a system
which under proper super-
vision and experienced con-
trol might have become de-
serving of material support."
Germs of something better!
Say, better itch; better stock-
ings; better gill-bird shoot-
ing ; better beer; better-
better what ? Better Inever-
wearems ?
The Tenterfied Star
wound up a Sapsea-ish al-
lusion to the 68th anniversary
of the memorable and de-
cisive battle Df Waterloo,
with the thrilling tale that
C. A. Lee is the worthy son of
a gentleman who played an
Important partin that scrim-
mage. This was too bad of
the Star. Just when we’4
begun to rejoice that the
Waterloo veteran was becom-
ing as extinct Os the dodo, we
And. the sod*. of a veteran
dragged in to,be made a re-
cipient of second hand kudos.
Why it’s as bad as Rossi wear-
ing his father’s medals, or old
Pitt returning-thanks for the
army because his maiden
aunt was jilted by a light
dragoon.
In the Cooktown Hos-
pital, It was the fashion when
a pauper died, do get a box of
any shape or dimensions. The
body was then rammed into
it, with the legs tucked
away in a knot, or with his
head jammed under his arm-
pit. Then, while an official
sat on the lid, the chec ry car-
penter produced a pound of
nails and drove them in.
Sometimes the coffin didn’t
burst on the way to the ceme-
tery, and sometimes it did.
But so long as there was
enough of him left in the box
to shovel in, it was deemed
satisfactory. The committee
have ordered that, in future,
no coffin shorter than four
feet shall be used for adults.
So that it will only be neces-
sary to crack the legs at the
knee.
Bega is the great pig
country. The Bega people
are said to be as fond of their
pigs as the Irish peasantry
are supposed to be. They
cover them with sheep-skins
in the cold weather, and give
them packs of cards to play
euchre with when time
hangs heavy on their feet. In
addition to this, they are pro-
vided with whistles to play
sentimental airs upon, ana the
local papers are read to them
as regularly as they-the
papers come out. By the
time this educational course
is finished the pigs become so
Intelligent that theyare im me-
diately shipped off to Sydney
for fear they should begin to
get too wise, and want to
lecture upon theological sub-
jects. What becomes of them
then, we hardly know. Proba-
bly they are made school-in-
spectors. Or country editors.
A ’cute N.S.W. squatter somewhere in the
Riverine district sent all the way to a Melbourne
•Asylum for a cripple to dummy tor him. The joy
of release from poverty to becoming a squattah
was too much for the poor old fellow. He turned
up his toes two days after passing through Albury,

In the early days of Sydney were two
darkeys, Combo and Peter. The latter, for sheep
stealing, was sentenced to be hanged, and he gave
his clothes to his sooty friend and countryman.
Combo. When Peter was on the scaffold and
placed under the beam, some delay in turning him
off took place and a murmuring went through
the crowd that he was to be reprieved. Upon this
Combo elbowed his way through, and, getting as
near as possible to his friend, cried out at the top
of his voice: “ Mind, Peter, hang or no hang, bam
em you get ’em clothes back I”
Scene: Liverpool Council Chamber. Dra-
matis persona}: The Mayor and three aldermen.
Alderman. No. 1 ( apropos to some remarks of
Alderman Brown anent a money vote): “ Aider-
man Brown is a liar and an idiot—a damned idiot!"
Alderman Brown; “I will take the sense of the
Council as to whether I’m a liar and a damned
Idiot.” Alderman Wilson: “ Fou take the sense of
the Council, you , . . .” And so on. There
was something very Dogberrylike in Brown’s
notion of taking the sense of the Council as to
whether he was a liar and a damned idiot. If the
ayes h d carried it .
It occurred to us, when we heard that Mr.
and Mrs. Anderson had been thrown from their
buggy while returning home from court after
their libel victory over the S. M. Herald, that the
Herald was the only paper In Sydney for whom
Providence would have done so much. The
Andersons might have broken their necks, and
that wouldn’t have been in the public interest;
though, perhaps, If you could get Edward Fairfax
to tell you all about it under the rose, he would
have preferred their receiving such damages to
those awarded, £450 and costs. We are glad to
be able to state that two out of the four jurymen
who tried our case are now dead, and, we presume,
In Heaven. The blessings of Divine Providence
don’t seem to have been ladled out very freely to
Judge Manning: lately, either.
Perpetual motion ia discovered now.
Andy Lynch did it. He was in the “ thrane ” the
other day, groin# along-, looking as sweet a man as
ever sat under a blue cloud, when he suddenly
said, *• I waz thinking to myself, and so I waz, that
the f lotion of the whales of the thrane ought to
phroduce enough electhriclty, bedad, to move it
mtolrely.” A timid man, who listened to the
words of wisdom falling from the lips of the great
Italian legislator, asked, “ But how would you
start the train ?” “Oh,” said Andy, airily, “that’s
moighty alzy; you could use the locymotiv ingin
to jist make the electhriclty for a sthart, you
know, and till the battberies, and shure, phat's to
sthop the thrane thin from goin’ and goin’ till its
whales wear out entoirely, and ain’t there at all at
all 7" So Andy Lynch, M.P., has discovered it at
last.
The following advertisement appears in a
Maitland paper:—“ £50 Reward.—To the Police In
Singleton District and Others.—My cattle bearing
the Ace of Clubs brand, with number 8 crossways
under, depasturing on Strathisla and other places,
Upper Paterson District, decrease very consider-
ably, and must bo driven away or stolon. The
above reward will be paid for secret information
resulting in the conviction of any person or per-
sons.—Herbert H. Brown. Exchange Buildings,
Sydney, May 7,1883.” With reference to the above,
wo have received the following facetious little
communication:—“To H. H. Brown, M.LA., per
favour Bulletin.—Sir, In reference to your ad.
in Maitland Mercury, I would suggest that the
decrease in your cattle arises from insufficient
grass, or from in-breeding. Try oil cake. As you
say it is imperative that the cattle be either stolen
or driven awav, kindly inform me date when you
wish this done, and I will personally attend to it
for you. Having hereby secretly informed you of
the publication of your advertisement, by which
the author may bo convicted, the £50 reward may
be sent to Pat O’Really, Gresford.”
The other day a Sydney “young blood”
had a fight with a Melbourne ditto over a question
of ancestry, and got worsted. The matter was to
have come before the courts, but was squared by
the intervention of mutual friends. Aoropos of
the question of ancestry, a Victorian barrister tells
a story, which we think we have heard from the
nigger minstrels, about the “ancestor” of a cer-
tain Melbourne man who is, or used to be, consider-
ably gilded, and who is very proud of his “ ances-
try.” The “old man," in the early days, kept, in
Melbourne, a well-known public-house. The
barrister’s father was an occasional customer, and
one day entering the parlour, found mine host
seated near the fire, with a copy of the Port
Phillip Gazette in ids hand and looking very
dejected. “ What’s the matter, Billy—why so sad ?”
enqu rod the man of law. “Ah,” replied Billy,
“there’s been a great accident in the bay yester-
day. I was just reading the paper and it says live
ships came in—and they are all bottom up.” Now
the P.P. Gazette used to print over the notices of
shipping arrivals the llgure of a ship and the old
man had got the paper upside down. This ancestry
quarrel reminds one of the story poor J. C. Patti-
son used to tell about the Scotch squatter who
said he was going home “to his ancestral halls.”
Which, explained J.C., “consisted, to my personal
knowledge, of an inverted boat on the Clyde.”
The Fisheries Exhibition in London is a won-
derful affair, covering 22 acres; so vast and in-
tricate as to bewilder the beholder. The trail of
the tarred rope is over it all; and through and
aoout among the craft walk dainty English dandy
yachtsmen, mahogany-looking Chinese, Red Indian
canoers, and sturdy blonds from Norway, lineal
sons of the grand old Viking heroes, indeed, one
of the sights, at of the opening, was a body of
several hundred fishermen in their real jerseys and
sou’westers, from all the coasts of Britain, ranged
in lines down the building. Awkward, shy, un-
gainly, in the fashionable throng; but men, every
inch of them. Grace Darling’s old coble was there,
and the very boat that carried the Eira men in the
neighbourhood of the Pole, while the dog that
trotted through the snow lies under the boat;
there are collapsible craft, marvellous lifeboats,
enchanted river launches with glossy planks and
velvet seats, telling of flirtation and idle hours;
and a raft with seats, like a floating parlour. A
great attraction Is where trim and lusty shrimping
girls (who never wore a crinoletteor French corset
since they were born) bend their graceful figures
in the making of nets and patching of lackle,
while dandydom looks on and relishes the contem-
plation. There are the latest delicate trout rods,
weighing half a pound; and there is weird Chinese
gear, use 1 when the world was young, and formed
on the model invented by Noah when his time
hung heavy in the Ark.
The “New South Wales
Social Purity Society ” are
already sending out circulars
asking for subscriptions. Evi-
dently there is no use in a
ppor man trying to keep
pure.
The boat in which Ber-
nard Gllboy made his voyage
from San Francisco to Aus-
tralia is now In the Wax-
works Exhibition. We are
surprised that Bernard is not
there, too.
A soap-boiling firm in
this city advertise that “all
the best families” use their
soap. This is loo thin. The
“ best families ” never use
soap. They ate afraid of
washing otr their respect-
ability.
Two Victorian girls,
named respectively Venus and
Virtue Betts, were recently
expelled from the Industrial
School because of their “ hor-
rible depravity.” The old
story, we suppose—Venus led
Virtue astray.
We remember reading
once, in a cheerful little book,
entitled “Melancholy Exam-
ples,” of the corpse of an ex-
communicated wretch which
the earth refused to receive.
It was burled time after time,
but the grave vomited it
forth again after each burial.
So with the corpses of certain
politicians. There is one on
the surface now which has
been burled many times. And
it stinks.
The Victorian Govern-
ment have refused the appli-
cation of Power, the bush-
ranger, to be released from
Pentridge. Power is now 80
years of age. This refusal
seems cruel, but we think it
is right. If he wore released
hewould have to be supported
in some way, and he is now
too old to become a police-
man, and too respectable to
go into Parliament. They
might, however, make him a
C.M.G. — Just to discourage
others from becoming bush-
rangers.
An eminent doctor has
discovered that the common
house-fly carries germs of
disease about with it. Of
course. We have seen dozens
of them doing it. We have
seen them carrying one under
each arm, and a swagful on
their backs. They do it out
of innate devilry. A germ is
three-cornered with a flat
bottom, so that they can lay
it down anywhere when they
want to take a rest without
fear of its falling. It is the
existence of such marks of
design as this which tills the
mind of the philosopher with
respect for the mysteries of
nature. Refer to Paley for
further particulars.
Australian larrikins are
accused by Forbes of “ swear-
ing before women." This vile
habit is but too significant of
the utter lowness of our
lower class. In the old days,
they used to punish blas-
phemy by cutting out the
blasphemer’s tongue. This is
the only cure we can think of
for this disease of cursing. It
would be practically, though
we are afraid not morally,
effectual. Other people would
not hear the curses, but the
blasphemers, when they had
their tongues cut out, would
for a certainty learn the dumb
alphabet, and curse on their
lingers. When people are des-
tined to go to eternal sulphur,
there is no use in trying to
bar the way.
The Duke of Buooleuch
is said to look with a very un-
favourable eye on the mar-
riage of his son with “ the
cousin of Lady Clarke”—wo
mean Miss Ryan. This is just
the kind of hue old contempt
which the Highland cattle-
lifters used to have for the
plodding Low landers who
reared the cattle. It is not to
be expected that the descend-
ant of a haughty line of
border-raiders, who always
stole whatever sheep they
had, would consent with good
grace to the mixture of the
blue blood of his family with
the blood of common people
who got their stock in the
tame colonial way—under a
system tempered by the ope-
ration of the Brands Act.
Debrett forbid!
The N.S.W. Premier, has lately taken a
great interest In the Melbo rne law courts. When
he is tired of this, he might stroll along and take a
little Interest in his own vermin and typhoid-fever
breeding shanties at Sydney. In the Insolvency
Court, for instarce, one-half of the clerks' ilme ia
taken up defending their lunches with the ollice
furniture from the desperate attacks of centi-
pedes, daddy-longlegs, and bob-tailed scorpions ;
in the District Court, two of the deposition clerks
have had their toes bitten off by hideous-looking
reptiles peculiar to the ai le-diluvian period and to
the court aforesaid ; in the sacred precincts of the
Supreme Court its if, it is nothing unusual, even
during the most solemn occasions, for a bald-
headed, gravy-eyed old cockroach to look over the
top of his Honor's ink-pot, and ask if there s “ any
more news about the Fenians.’’ A sum of £180,000
was voted for the erection of suitable buildings
nearly as far back as the Norman Conque t, and if
this vote is not utilised by the end o the present
year, it wili lapse, and ti e whole concern go
ll bung.” The terror of Hogging isn’t a circum-
stance compared with that of being tried in a
Sydney law court.

30.000 deaths occur annually in India from snake-
bites. Since 1870, from 150,000 to 300,000 persons
have perished in this way. In 1880, 313,776 serpents
were destroyed; 11,663 rupees were paid to their
destroyers. In the north-west Provinces and in
Oude a body of Kanjars has been formed for the
special purpose of killing off venomous reptiles.
The men receive two rupees a month, and if a man
is so fortunate as to destroy more than twenty
snakes during that period he is paid the equivalent
of about 3d. per head for all in excess of that
number. In 1881 wild beasts caused the death of
3757 persons, as against 3810 in 1880. In 1881, 1557

Capt. Armstrong, R.N.
The case of Capt. Armstrong, whose portrait
we now give, occupied the attention of a
select committee of the Legislative Assembly
shortly after the present Government took
office. Captain Armstrong was appointed
Resident Magistrate and Government Repre-
sentative on Lord Howe Island in 1878, and
continued to discharge the duties of that
post until 1883, when, in consequence of a
Setition from nine residents, the late Hon. J.
owie Wilson was sent as a special commis-
sioner to inquire into the complaints. Mr.
Wilson reported adversely to Captain Arm-
strong, and that officer was, in consequence,
removed from his post, deprived of his em-
ployment, and dismissed from the Commis-
sion of the Peace. Captain Armstrong came
to Sydney, and long vainly demanded
a fuller inquiry than had been held
in an irresponsible, and, he contended,
irregular manner on the Island. It
was not until the present Govern-
ment took office that he was granted
this reasonable request. A committee of
the Assembly was appointed to investigate
the whole matter; and the report of that
committee in the fullest sense exonerated
Captain Armstrong from every one of the
charges upon which he had been con-
demned, and showed that Mr. Wilson had
conducted his investigations with a strange
absence alike of discretion and common fair-
ness. The injury done by the long period of
apparent disgrace, and painful uncertainty
as to the future, to this officer, can scarcely
be estimated. He had suffered in reputa-
tion, pocket, and feelings. The fact that he
had been dismissed the magistracy had been
commented on in the very London clubs
where his old comrades resorted. And
reparation has yet to be made. And the
man who had thus suffered is a retired com-
mander in the Royal Navy, a Knight of the
Legion of Honor, decorated with the
Order of the Medjidie, the Crimean and
Turkish medals and clasps. He was a
midshipman of H.M.S. Howe when she took
Queen Adelaide to Lisbon and Madeira in
1848, and was appointed aide-de-camp to
Her Majesty; saw much service in suppres-
sion of slavery on the west coast of Africa;
was in the Vesuvius during the Crimean
War; was present during the Crimean War
at the Sulina mouth ot the Danube, and cap-
tured many vessels; was engaged at the
wreck of the Tiger, off Odessa, and on several
occasions on the Danubian and Circassian
coasts; signal-midshipman of the Vesuvius
when engaged at the battle of Alma; pre-
sene at the combined attacks on Sebastopol:
was in command of a small steamer at
Balaclava; served with the Naval Brigade
in the trenches before Sebastopol; was
one of the storming party on the Redan
on the 18th June, and present at the fall of
Sebastopol; was engaged in the Sea of Azoff
expedition, and had charge of boats at many
skirmishes at Mariapol and other ports; re-
ceived special promotion from Lord Lyons
for conspicuous zeal and gallantry, and was
wounded on three occasions.

WOMAN ITEMS.
The Mackat Mercury tells a fairy tale of
a young woman in that locality who was mot
travelling with three tortoiseshell cats In a peram-
bulator, and two big dogs behind, and who said she
walked overland In that dignified way from Mel-
bourne to Rockhampton, and thence up the coast
to Mackay. She was 23 years of age, travelled
from station to station, her dogs protected her, and
for a living she sold needles and thread! The MER-
CURY' has been “ had ” The thinnest thread in the
whole affair, to us, is the yarn itself.
“ Madge ” had rather a bad shock the
other day. She tells her dear friend Amy about It
thus!—“I met a real live poet out at dinner the
other evening. As you cherish your illusions,
Amy dear, avoid snch a catastrophe as that. I
have not yet recovered from the rough shock of
disenchantment. The creature greedily eyed tho
dishes, wouldn’t speak till he was fed, and then
talked only of cookery and recipes! His hair was
long, whlcn gave him an unkempt look, suggestive
of tho Zoological Gardens and their Inmates. He
apparently forgot, while Imbibing his soup, that
ho possessed a beard, and was almost totally obli-
vious of the lady he had taken down to dinner. I
don’t want to meet any more poets.
The Empress of Austria has just “sacked ”
her colffeuse for “ a breach of professional
honour.” Tho Empress has a magnificent head of
hair of unusual length and beauty. Tho artiste. In
combing it every morning, contrived to abstract a
few of the precious filaments, and. In time, had
sufficient to form a tresse, which she sold for a big
sum to an English collector of curiosities, who had
it artistically mounted in a frame and exhibited.
This came to the ears of the Empress, who snorted.
But the dismissed professional lady only smiled,
and is about to start In business in New York, and
get the paragraph about her broach of faith
inserted in every newspaper she can get at; she
says it Is a good “ad.” A hundred years ago she
wouid have been strangled In a dungeon. The
service Is going to tho Devil; yes, your Majesty, se
It is.
Walter Lareher, of Emerald Hill, was a
voung man who deemed It time to enter into the
holy state of matrimony. Ho married a widow in
September, 1879, and by 1S81 he was so pleased with
the connubial state that he left homo and mar-
ried Miss Braithwaite, of Geelong. His name was
Henderson by this time. Ho was now launched on
the soa of matrimony, and at the end of another
twelve months of happiness he wedded Miss
Thornton, of that place. Having now three wives,
it was manifestly ridiculous that he should kill
himself with work, and, although an expert cook,
he decided to let the pots and pans go to rust, and
to get coppers by other means than rubbing them.
But life is made up of disappointments. The con-
stitution of society is so rotten that a man is denied
the privileges of a savage, and the law won’t allow
him to have three wives at one time, Agnes, and
Leah, and Martha were unknown to one another,
but now they have mingled their tears in court.
Walter is committed for trial, and, in court, ac-
cepted his position quite cheerily, refusing to say
a word.
A Western Queensland paper says“ Bar-
maids at Hughenden command 45s. per week.”
That’s nothing. In Sydney, most of them don’t
get much more than half forty-five shillings, but,
then, look at the “perks.” why, one vivacious,
neat-figured, tastefully-dressed Hebe,who for some
months was the Idol of the mashers In a
city caravanserai, had presented to her about
£100 worth of jewellery monthly on an average.
In about half a year platonic admirers—they In-
cluded all sorts of people, even Ministers of the
Crown and (wo say this very sorrowfully Indeed)
clergymen — handed over to their divinity
£700 or £800 of more or less tasteful presents. We
have caught Bulletin bards writing verses to her
eyebrows, and watched Cabinet Ministers and legal
luminaries become mere drivellers In her presence
—for what did she care about all their brains and
prestige while they didn’t wear a masher collar,
like the young Idiot to whom she talked for half-
an-hour at a stretch, totally oblivious tho while
that the most promising young politician in Aus-
tralia, sir, was dying for one word, one glance, one
smllel But she has gone at last—to be married,
they say to the sen of a big Melbourne capitalist.
Talk about De Sta61, De Genlis, Cleopatra,
Josephine, and se on! The place of the literary
and diplomatic woman of yore is now occupied by
the pretty barmaid who used to be the mainspring
of the present N.8.W. Government. But, then, she
was pretty.

— “Mask,” of Frogmore, in some ropy drivel

woman of his acquaintance, who we suspect has
jilted tho brute, as “a cloven-footed advocate of

and so on. We should like to hear what
are this cloven-footed liar’s ideas anent “ Masks.”
In some of the English counties they say
that children born at midnight have the power e£
seeing ghosts. We don’t know about this, but we
know that we have seen ghosts for several nights
back, and we have started to make notes on their
habits and customs. We have already noted that
they have a fondness for firewood and a passion for
poultry. We shall make some more notes when
we can manage to borrow a shot-gun.
This is the way in which the Tamworth
Independent man writes about advertised
whisky:—“ Good. We have sampled this whisky.
Better. It is soft as velvet to the palate, fragrant
as nectar, and richer than ambrosial wine.
Couches of pearl, and vestures of purple, are the
duo concomitants of this luxurious beverage, and
the imbiber sighs for the melodies and savours
of Orient, and the voluptuous quiescence of East-
ern harems, ‘ where never thread of silver strays
in tress of singing girl.’ ” Now this is what we call
a literary style. We Ilka a man who can with
equal ease turn a metaphor or the handle of the-
steam-power. If he can write in this fashion about
whisky, we should like to see what he can say on
rum. And we should like him to wxite it in the
morning after sampling.

His Honor Judge Harding, Acting Chief
Justice of Queensland.
The Acting Chief Justice of Queensland,
during the absence on leave of Sir Charles
Lilley, is one of the few Australian Judges
who does net ewe his seat on the Bench to
prominence in party politics. Mr. Harding
has never been a member of Parliament, and
was elevated to the Bench as a recognition
of his legal attainments. As a barrister, Mr.
Harding was less remarkable for forensic art
than for erudition. His knowledge of the
law placed him at the head of his profession
in Queensland even before the outside public
were aware of his existence. His opinion
was sought in hosts of cases in which he
never held a brief to appear; and when he
was appointed a Queen’s Counsel, his name
had been little known to the public. Lat-
terly—perhaps in view of the possibilities
which began to open before him—Mr. Har-
ding’s appearances in Court became more
frequent; and when he was appointed to fill

The argument that a man can do as much
in eight hours as he can in ten, will surely cut both
ways. If he can pile into eight hours as much
labour as he can get Into ten, we reckon he could
pack as much pleasure into the same. We should
like to utilise the O’Sullivan for experimentalising
on this question.
A Melbourne evening paper came out the
other day with tho statement that Lady Augustus
Loftus was the original Lady Henry in Sardou’s
“ Diplomacy,” and that her Ladyship, on visiting
the Melbourne Bijou tho other evening, was much
pleased at so clever a representation by Miss Cora
Gwynne of her worthy self. Romantic, wasn’t it?
But, then, Lady Henry’s husband is represented in
the play ns a slightly giddy young person. We’d
almost swear Augustus was never giddy: wo be-
lieve, in fact, he was never young.
A short time since, a man started as a
coffin-maker in Forbes. Ho got as far as exhibit-
ing a sample coffin lid in his window. You know
the kind of thing: varnished board, with a pewter
breastplate on it, supported by two tin angels that
just look as if they had been out bathing and lost
their clothes. But no corpse oame. The death-
rate Is low in Forbes. This is because the peopio
up there are so ugly that death is afraid to call
round lor them except at night, when ho can’t see
their faces. So the coffin-maker loft. And a
policeman loft with him. He was wanted in an-
other district for something or other. It was evi-
dent he was not wanted in Forbes.
One Cook is carrying on a roaring trade in
Melbourne and suburbs as an informer on “short ”
bread sellers, etc. The other day he got a score of
them fined at the Hotham Police Court for selling
bread without weighing it. It was elicited from
Cook, during the trial of these cases, that to carry
on his “business"properly ho employed one man
at £2 per week, and a boy at 10s. per week with
board and lodging, their duty being to make the
purchases while their employer watched outside.
Cook also said that he had his summonses printed
a thousand at a time, and did not deny that he
made from £600 to £700 per annum from his little
game. Cook is very cool and self-possessed whilo
giving evidence, and the Parthian glances shot at
him by his victims seem more to amuse than annoy
him. He entered the court with a large sack con-
taining his "purchases.” which ho placed very
methodically on tho table, each loaf being marked
with tho name of thesollorand other hieroglyphics
representing facts necessary for a conviction. The
bakers say: Heaven sends bread, and the Dev i

The late Mrs. Pearson, postmistress at
Caradon, was not tho least eccentric or interesting
Civil Servant that New South Wales has known.
Her name will be fresh in the memory of Camdeu-
ites, even when some of the Addisonian articles
which Mr. J. B. Martin has contributed to tho
Camden Times are forgotten. Mrs. Pearson made
no distinction between persons, whether they were
rich or poor, magistrates or policemen, chimney-
sweeps or C.M.G’s., friends or foes. Her “ Wm,
what do you want?” always given in a loud shrill
tenor, greeted alike tho bellman or tho local
parson, as he poked his head In tho office window
to inquire for his mall. 11 the parson and the bell-
man happened to call and Inquire for their mail at
the same time, she was so methodical that she
would “servo them alDhabetieally,” assho phrased
it, and bellman Yooley would get his mail before
parson Zooley, This was what she called “ carrying
out tho postal regulations to the letter.” To prove
thuit she was strict, here is one out of about 50 stories
told of her. A gentleman once rode from Vermont
-to-Camden to get an Important letter, which he
knew was in the office for him. He reached the
office at 20 minutes to 6 o'clock, and, being an old
and intimate friend of Mrs. Pearson, began a bit
of friendly gossip with her. They laughed and
chatted away (for when Mrs. Pearson did unbend,
which was about once in every seven years, she
was quite fascinating) until tho office clock struck
six, which reminded the gentleman of what ho had
come for, ami ho smilingly said “ Oh, by the bye,
Mrs. Pearson, there is a letter here for me, I be-
lieve; will you bo kind enough to hand It t« njc ?"
“ Oh yes," she replied with a smile which was in
reality a grin that Grimaldi might have envied—
“ Oh, yos7 Mr. M., there is a letter here for you,’ but
you must call for it during office hours. It is new
past six o’clock. Good evening.” And down went
tho office window with a bang.
Osman Day, orator, In November, ’81,
married Emily Harriet Balmcr. Some time subse-
quently a woman announced herself to Mrs. Day
(ndc Balmer) as the original and duly qualified Mrs.
Day. Thereupon, Balmer pire made inquiries,
with tho result that tho father ef the original Mrs.
Day forwarded to Kydney a copy of the certificate
of marriage between Osman Day and Eliza Harri-
son. Confronted with this, Osman alleged that the
woman who had said she was the original Mrs.
Day was, in truth, the wife of ene Barlow, who,
for something he had dene, had been obliged to
quit England, and that he had simply brought hor
out as his wife to oblige Barlow 1 And to this story
tho woman who had called herself the bond fide
Mrs. Day also stuck, with variations. Result—
Osman committed for bigamy.
Some months ago the Anglican Bishop of
Ballarat, speaking mendlcantly at a religious meet-
ing held in the Mansion House, London, said that
so great was the ignorance In his diocese, that a
sect called “Sounders” swarmed the bush, who
held that the way to get to Heaven was to make a
peculiar sound with the voice, this grotesque be-
lief being based on a text of Scripture, “ Blessed
are tho people who know the joyful sound.” The
people of Hamilton (Vic.) who dwell within tho
boundaries of his See want to know who the deuce
are these “ Sounders,” and their Spectator says
on their behalf“ We have never heard of them;
but so long as they help to make the Right Rev.
Ballarat’s ‘soundings’ into British pockets in aid
of tho poor benighted peopio of BaHarat and tho
Western District successful, wo supp'ose that is all
His Lordship cares about.’’ In connection with
this, there’s rather a good story to tell. When the
yarn as told by the Bishop reached Australia, an
Anglican parson wrote to the Australian
Churchman to seek information about these
“ Sounders.” His letter being published In that
journal, elicited a reply from another contributor"
to the effect that the said parson himself was the
founder of the stentorophonlo sect, and that the
Bishop had sarcastically alluded to him when he
mentioned the matter in England. If this bo so, j
as we have good reason to believe it was, that 1
Bishop Stanton designedly sneered at one who had
held his license, all we can say Is, tantame anirnis

Mrs. Hampson, the Evangelical Lulu from
Paradise Gardens, who is now creating a huge
sensation in the South, makes “ Inquiry Meetings ”
■ a feature of her mission. They come off after
the regular services. Anxious ones are invited to
stand up. Then, the general audience having
departed, these anxious ones are wrought by the
mission-workers, who are faithful souls that have
been recommo ided by Evangelical clergymen to
Mrs. Hampson and her engineer, the Rev. A. .1,
Cinrke, the Baptist minister of West Melbourne.
By means of a careful ticket system it has been
calculated that a l . rge number of non-churchgoers
attend these services. The workers tackle the
anxious lingerer in this wise: “Do you know
Jesus for your Saviour 7’ or, “Are you saved?”
The usual reply is: “I hope so.” to which the
worker responds: “Hoping wont do; you must
know it.” And then tho workers, having set the
sponge, knead in the impression. The Hampson
missioners don’t go in for noise; they eschew the
howling “ hallelujah ” business of tho Harray, and
possibly It’s this that fetches a moresubdued'lot of
anxious ones. The larrikin element It doesn’t
attract. Mrs. Hampson goes around whilo tho
workers are at work, and has a little prayer here,
or chops a little theology there, and, whatever
may bo the source of her power, gets at hundreds,
as is clear from the effect she produces—men and
women broken down and In tears all about the
“ Inquiry Room.” It’s alleged that, the other day,
she got at a veteran Melbourne editor of secular
journalism, and, such was hor effect on him,
that he posted himself in the corridor of
tho Inquiry Room, and kept exclaiming loudly,
“This is Real Salvation,” "Oh, it’s glorious,”
“I cannot tear myself away,” and so forth
(here he looked very hard at the lady and winked.)
Here are samples of the "requests for prayer”
and “ prayers offered” at hor services:—” Pray for
one who was at the point of deciding yesterday,
but was persuaded to turn back.” -• Will God’s
children plead for a young lady convicted last
night.” “Tho writer wants that new birth he has
heard. He wants to know it in truth.” “ A sor-
rowing mother asks prater for herjchildron, espe-
cially hor son.” “A wife who has prayed for up-
wards of 13 years for her husband asks that ho may
be saved to-night.” “ We pray, O God, for a bless-
ing on those two young women who could not get
into tho meeting last evening. Is it not a reproach
to Your People who have beoncrowding round the
Fountain, and keeping away those who never
drank.” Itov. A. J. Clark prayed: “Lord, we ask
Thee to save u young sister who has gone from tho
inquiry room to the ball room, headlong again
into the world! Oh, my God, take the worldiiuesa
out of Thy church in this city! (Murmurs of
Amen). Save the gambling ministers 1 (Amen!)
Save those who get up the gambling and tho

“ We pray that the literary men, the men who write

and may it appear in practice.” (Amen)!
Conversionary revivals, like murders, suicides,
divorces, and so on, move in cycles. A whole
people will exhibit the appearance of deep reli-
gious enthusiasm from lithe to time, just as the
average of tho Lunatic asylums will periodically
go up. Whilo hundreds of tho lower classes in
Melbourne are enlisting under tho banner of the
Salvation Harmy, and tho Press have suddenly
found attraction in pulpit discourses, giving to the
Sublio whole columns of bunkum every Monday,

and gradually lowering the returns of the other
theatricals. Outside the Town Hall is Mrs. Hamp-
son’s enormous placard headed “ Jesus Only I”
Now, though Melbourne is about the last place
whore you’d expect to find Salvation, yet hundreds
declare that they have found it and arc happy.
Mrs. Hampson is an eloquent woman, who preacues
palatable Christianity. That’s what she is. And
she’s raking in the coin. When she has thoroughly
scooped the pools, she’ll be off to fresh woods and
pastures new, whore there's more sin, and probably
more money.
The Forbes bench the other day granted
license renewals to 28 pubs. And yet they wail at
the dry state of the country out there.
On Monday week, at Bourke, Frank Robert-
son, of Jandra Station, defeated John Aplitt in
150 yards spin, for £100 aside. Robertson, who not
long* since leffc the Scotch College, Melbourne,
jumped away with the lead, and at 100 yards had
slightly over a yard to the good. In the last 50
Aplitt closed up, but the young one responded
gamely, and won a grand race by about 2 feet in
I5?s seconds. At least, that’s what they say : we
don t believe it.
Burns got pretty well the hang of lovely
woman when he said “ she’d marry auld Nick if
he’d keep her aye braw.” In Tasmania, a China-
man induced a girl to leave her homo and live with
him, without any fettering legalities. Next a
white man wooed and won the maiden, and was
duly married in church. But John had only to
appear again on the scene, armed with a few pre-
sents, when the fickle one came straight back to
him. And yet some people despise a Chinaman!
Whatever their secret is, Chinamen can notoriously
buy pretty girls any moment they produce the
price.

were discharged cured from N.S.W. asylums during

Mr Alley, the Police Magistrate, had been
to hear Dr. Simms, at the Melbourne Athenaeum,
when the great man on bumps told his audience
that Australians are the greatest in
the world. The following morning, Mr. Alley
presided at the Emerald Hill Police Court,
and gave evidence that he had well digested the
knowledge ho had acquired the previous evening.
A working man made his appearance in answer to
a fraud summons for not paying a butcher s bill,
and Mr. Aliev told him that the working men in
this “HappyLand ” were not satisfb d unjew they
had meat three times a day. Some even indulged
in ham and eggs for break fast. Porridge was quite
enough to form sinew and muscle.
Marv Paine, of Parramatta, has been sent
to gaol for six weeks for fruit-stealing. She has
been suspected of being an orchard robber for the
past ten years. It is a clear case of kleptomania,
and it is ‘irresistible. She has no need to steal, and
yet will think nothing of doing a twenty-mile
tramp to rob an orchard. And she has lately put
up her children to steal fruit for her. Of course,
six weeks in gaol will not cure her, and she will be
out again in the orange season for a bit of fresh
fruit. It seems a pity that the unfortunate woman
should have to herd with criminals. Possibly, if
she were compelled to eat all the fruit she stole, it
might open her eyes. The last haul would have
been a tidy meal. It was four dozen lemons.
In the very far North, a shocking state of
affairs exists with regard to licensing arrange-
ments. Licenses are issued without the least dis-
cussion to men who are living in open adultery
with notorious women; and women who are living
in the same manner with eminent horse-thieves
and distinguished card-sharpers are also allowed
licenses The so-called “hotels” are the resort of
the most abandoned characters, who, like the pub-
licans themselves, would be locked up in
bad though that city be. The worst part of the
whole business is that the licensing bench consists
of the local editor, who has the bad taste to ait
during the hearing of an application concerning
which he gets an advertisement from the publican.
The other day, Mr. R. W. Skinner, book-
seller was lined £5 at Sydney Police Court for selling
" Fruits of Philosophy,” the pamphlet out of
which arose the celebrated prosecution of Mr.
Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant, and which, in the
opinion of the Bench, was an “improper
bbok Mr. Skinner, who, in Court, did not appear t
willing to enter into any argument as to char-
acter of the publication in question, lias, since the
conviction, applied to the N.S.W. Liberal Associa-
tion for the funds necessary to enable him to
appeal, and received the following rather neat
letter from Mr. Charles Bright:- era M^ 8 R C w'
tion of N.S.W., Sydney, June 37, 1883. Mr. It. w.
Skinner. Dear Sir. Your application to tlm above
Association to support you in an appeal to the
higher courts in respect to the penalty intbeted on
you at the Police Court for selling a pamphlet en-
titled ‘Fruits of Philosophy,’ was considered by
the Committee lost evening, and I am instructed
to inform you that while individual members of
the Association will, doubtless, bo willing to con-
tribute to any defence fund which may be inaugu-
ratedmi vrir behalf, the Committee, as a body,
have reach cd not to take any action in the matter.
They have arrived at this conclusion mainly be-
cause you declared to the magistrates that you had
ceased selling the pamphlets since the visit of the
police to your shop, and hence, evidently, are not
acting on any principle calculated to enlist the
sympathy of this Assoclatlon.-Yours lospecttully.

At Port Douglas, (N.Q.), a man named

crlnolotte, and introduce steels into their skirts in
only the most modified form. ‘ Some ladies insist
on a huge bunch at the back,’ one of them said to
me, ‘but I try to tone it down as much as possible.
Innocent mistakes are occasionally none the
less awkward. For instance, the family name of
the Earl of Dartmouth Is Legge, and at a dinner
party once the Countess and two of her daughters
were announced by the over-precise butler as The
Countess of Dartmouth, and the Ladies Legges.
The effect on the highly-civilised society present
was mixed Freaks may come, and tollies may

favour, in spite of masculine ridicule and feminine
caprice, to one of which forces sooner or later

At a meeting of the Auckland (N.Z.) Rugby
Football Association, the secretary was instructed
to write to the secretary of the Southern Rugby
Union, Sydney, asking what terms the Union
would be prepared to offer in the event of an Auck-
land team visiting Sydney.
Edwards’ victories over poor old Dan are
putting him “ off his head.” Immediately after the

The following programme has beeu ar-
ranged for the N.S.W. Rugby footballers who
purpose visiting Brisbane :-15th August, First

ogether); 23rd, return Intercolonial match; and
on the 24th they leave for Sydney.
Rowing seems to be at a low ebb in Eng-
land. George Bubear has been trying to start an
open scullers’ handicap, but the affair fell through
for want of entries. London Bblu’s Life says
“ it is to be hoped that when Largan arrives here
he will find friends ready to support him in a match
against England’s champion, George Bubear.”
About 700 attended the Morpeth races on

Harry Channon, of Frogmoor, was recently
cantering along a level piece of ground at Reedy
Flat, when his horse stumbled and threw him on to
a|stump. fracturing his skull. He died some three
hours afterwards. Poor Channon was an enthu-
siastic all-round sportsman, and a general favourite
in the district. Mr. Timmis rode to Adelong for a
doctor, and covered 36 miles in something under
two hours.
The Canterbury (N.Z.) Jockey Club intend
giving £3700 in added money at their Spring meet-
ing in November. The principal events on the
first day will be the New Zealand Cup £1000, and
Welcome Stakes, £200; on the second day.
Stewards’ Stakes £250, Derby £250, Juvenile
Plate, £200; and Steeplechase, three miles, £150.
On the third day the main events are the Canter-
bury Cup, £500; Metropolitan, £200; Steeplechase,
£100; and Spring Nursery, £100. Now then, Ivory,
what about taking Jessie over ?
Thus Figaro “ The famous Maori pugi-
list, Slade, is now in London, and aflne specimen of a
man he is, his appearance being suggestive of even
greater strength and longer reach than that of the
renowned Heenan. Great efforts are being made
to arrange for a display of his talent; and there
are even rumours of a surreptitious revival of the
glories of the P.R. for the purpose. But, as the
authorities are keeping a sharp look-out on Mr.
Slade and his movements, nothing of the latter
kind is very likely,”
It is not likely that Myers will visit Eng-
land this year, as that gentleman has issued chal-
lenges to George to run him three races at 1000,
1200, and 1320 yards. This offer might pass for
“ Yankee ’cuteness ’’ were the one-sided nature of
it not at once apparent. It is acknowledged by
Myers that George has no chance with him at half
a mile, so he magnanimously offers to run him a
race 120 yards more in length, at which distance
Myers has made a record surpassing the profes-
slonal one, even. It is given by most athletes that
Myers Is the better man at three-quarters of a
mile; and every yard that a race is under that dis-
tance it is so much in his favour against George,
and the converse holds good to George’s benefit.
Setting aside the fact that George is suffering from
a bad strain, Myers’ anything but tempting offer is
not likely to “ retch him.”
A novel experiment is being tried in the
celebrated Englisn racing cutter Vanduara this
season. Electric batteries have been placed on
board for the purpose of setting up an electric
current through the steel plating of the vessel,
which has been burnished as bright as a new
knife. This electric current is expected to keep
the bottom of the yacht from fouling. The
strength of the current has not been stated; but no
doubt it will be strong enough to give o> o a
shock should a hand be incautiously placed on her
sides.
For the South Grafton Athletic Handicap,
125 yards, to come off on 13th July, W. Noud is
placed at scratch, P. Donoghue 3 yards; G. Shcr-
loy (Sydney) 4 yards, and T. Hines (Sydney) 8
yards. Tho handicap ranges up to 17 yards. In
the other Athletic Handicap, 150 yards, to be run at
North Grafton, on July 14, there are 129 nomina-
tions, nod possibly a row more may have been
made on the Richmond. F. Brown, Callaghan,
Farrell, and Pyke are among the Sydney nomina-
tions.

The English Amateur Boxing Association
recently made application at Scotland Yard for the
fiolice to attend at one of Its exhibitions, and
nterfere when It was thought the contestants had
received sufficient punishment. Not alone did the
Scotland Yard “boss” refuse to “take the chair,” as
was so kindly done by the N.S.W. Inspector-General
at the Miller-Foley show, but a strong intimation
was given that the perpetration of anything Illegal
(the hitting of a man “too hard” being instanced)
might result In the appearance of all concerned at
a Police Court.
It having been rumoured that the amateur
champion George would attempt to beat record
time in the ten-mile race for the Oliver Challenge
Cup at the Moseley Harriers’ Meeting, a rare crowd
mustered at Aston, England. George was care-
fully trained, but met with an accident at the last
moment, and after leading for four miles, became
so lame that he had to retire. The race was won
by Snook. The Birmingham roughs howled at
George as if he had thrown the race over, whereas
anyone who kept his eyes open could have seen
that he was running lame and In difficulties a
couple of miles before he gave up.
According to the 8.F. papers, C. A. Harri-
man has walked 121 miles without rest in 29 hours.
The feat was accomplished over a 165-foot track,
requiring 32 laps to the mile. The track was sur-
veyed and measured by a committee, and every
precaution was taken to get the walk on record.
The last one-half mile of the task was walked in
5min. 13sec. Ho received £26 for his performance
from the man who had the race in charge. The
previous record for distance walking without rest
was the 120 miles 1560 yards of Crossland, at Man-
chester (Eng.), Sept. 11 and 12, 1876. Harriman
backs himself to walk 200 miles without rest.
Sullivan and Mitchell have met in a boxing
match in America, and, as we anticipated, wonder-
ful middleweight as the Englishman undoubtedly
is, the American “put him through” in three
rounds. In the first round Mitchell got all the best
of it, but in the second Sullivan s weight and
strength began to tell, and the bout was a -bout
equal. In the third Mitchell came up weak, and
Sullivan seeing his chance, and fighting as Miller
should have milled with Foley, dashed In, relying
on his hitting power to make a finish of the affair,
which he did. By the way, how is it that Sullivan,
who, according to all accounts by last mall, was
half-dead of pneumonia, has come round so sud-
denly ? *
That historical sporting hostelry, “ Bunch’s
Hotel," Pitt and King streets. Sydney, terminated
Its spirituous career on Saturday night. A banking
company will now occupy the site. The only
drafts to be got henceforth will be over-drafts.
Which reminds us that lots of people have had
over-draughts at Punch’s at one time or other. In
the #ld times, the thirstier a man was the larger his
draught might be; but it is greatly to be feared
that from now the greater a man’s necessities, the
less will be his chance of getting a draft at all.
Anyhow, Punch’s, as a bank of issue, has put its
shutters up. It’s now to be a bank of deposit.
At Burwood, on Saturday last, the local
footballers met the University team, and were
defeated by 18 points to nil. This match, however,
cannot be taken as a criterion of the Burwoods’
strength, as live or six of their best players were
absent, and, to make matters worse, they had to
play most of the game with fourteen men, as
Hassall was hurt early in the day... The ttedfern
and Balmain Clubs met on Moore Park, but, owing
to the enroachment of the crowd, the game could
not be played out. Balmain claimed the victory
by two points to nil. During the afternoon,
Cameron, of the Balraaniacs, made the run of the
season, carrying the ball the whole length of the
ground, and obtaining a touch-down., ..On the
Association Cricket Ground the East Sydney and
P tersham clubs met for the second time this
season. East Sydney won the match by 1 goal
19 behinds to their opponents’ 1 goal 7 behinds.
At the recent Dunedin (N.Z.) meeting, just
before the starting of the Novel Race, a well-
known Boniface, while surveying the totalisator
and trying to make up his mind what he should
back, had his elbow touched by a man whom ho
didn’t know, and who said to him, “Better back
Clinkerina.” Asked the publican, “ Why should I
back her ?” “ Because she can go like blazes— I’ve
seen her.” Then Boniface drew his gratuitous
adviser out of the crowd, and talked to him on the
quiet. “ Now teil me,” he said, “ what makes you
advise mo to back Clinkerina ?” The stranger re-
plied, “Because I want to do you a turn. Years
ago, I was hard up, and wanted two shillings to
pay my fare to Port Chalmers, and I asked you for
it. You gave it me right off, and you now take
what I give you; back Clinkerina; there’s nothing
in it but her.” Boniface put £2 on Clinkerina—and
as, after the race, he was collecting his dividend of
£.56, he again saw his mysterious friend at his
elbow. Enquired he: “If you knew Clinkerina
was so good, why did not you back her yourself ?”
—“Ah!” was the r«ply; “look at my clothes; I
had no money.” His ailment was speedily re-
lieved.
Miller has stated that he made £540 out of
the Foley affair and his Melbourne benefit; that he
considers Foley tho best man that ever stood be-
fore him; that he is willing to put £100 in a stake
of £506, and back Larry against Mitchell, or any
middleweight in the world; and that to win from
a man of Foley’s weight, good as he is, was o
honour. No exception can be taken to the state-
ment that it was no groat performance for a man
of Miller’s size to take three hours to boat a lOst.
101b. man, but we wonder how the “ Professor’s ”
backers will like his acknowledgment that he won
the battle, although he agreed to a draw. “ A
Disappointed Stakeholder” writes in tho Melbourne
Sportsman that "ho was asked to put a small
amount in Miller’s stake, on the distinct under-
standing that if he won ho was to get back his
money, anti as much more.” Miller has paid back
tho money put in by the stakefinders, with 40 per
cent, added. The custom is to return only the
money put in; but if he made any arrangement he
should stand by it, as he received the whole of the
stakes, It is the backers who have most reason to
complain, os in consenting to a draw he completely
threw them over.
Captain Barclay, who years ago was the
leading patron of English sport, Is reputed to have
made many strange sporting wagers. The cham-
pion carrier of weights in England wagered that
he “ would carry 561b. more than any other man a
greater distance.” The captain said he could find
a man, and the match was made. Upon the day
of the match a mass of weights were carted to the
ground by the champion’s friends, and Barclay
was requested to produce his man. “ Here he is,
replied the captain, pointing to a wretched picture
of humanity under nine stone, with a one-pound
weight in his waistcoat pocket. Of course Her-
cules" could not carry his extra weight against
that, and his backers lost their money. On another
occasion large sura was laid between the captain
and another gentleman, each putting a snail on the
back of a dinner plate, the first off to win. Here,
again, the captain had a point. He had his plate
made uncomfortably hot, so that bissnail “ hooked
li” with all possible speed, while his adversary's
scarcely made a move. It was Captain Barclay
who first walked a thousand miles in a thousand
hours, a performance which at that time it was
considered would never be equalled. The same
feat we believe, has since been accomplished by a
woman.
The great international chess tournament
in London lasted nearly two months. From all parts
of Europe strange pale men gathered, each a
master or the game. Daily they played, for prizes
ranging from £25 to £300; and for weary hours, day
after day, hundreds of men and women paid their
half-crowns to watch their slow struggles from
outside. the roped boundary. The players all sat
in a cleared space in the middle of the room, at
little round tables: and under the glare of the
patient enthusiasts looking on, while the clocks
kept up a maddening tick, their games were
played. Occasionally an outsider, a barbarian,
with no chess views, would raise his voice above a
whisper, when a chorus of Indignant murmurs
warned him of certain ejectment. The players
were men of world-wide reputlon, and Zukertort
was the favourite all through. He has won. He
is weakly, and sits Immovable as a sphinx, with a
bird-like glittering eye. Steinitz, a brilliant little
Jewish-faced Austrian, second. The champion,
Rlackburne, who is painfully irritable, third.
Mason chewed all the time; Englisch toyed eter-
nally with n cigar, sitting sideways; and Mackenzie
was’the only really handsome man there. Behind
the bar, in a corner of the room, where a silence as of
a graveyard was peremptorily kept all the time,
was a victim of cruel torment. She was a pretty
barmaid—and she daren’t talk.

A correspondent who, at the Masonioaffair
a few days ago, experienced his first public ball in
Australia, sends a few of his impressions. He was
disappointed at the general disregard by dancers of
both time, step, and deportment; quadrilles were
danced in all sorts of different ways, and persons
stood up completely innocent of any knowledge of
dancing. Ladles dressed well, but lacked carnage.
There were several good waltzers, who reversed
properly and gracefully. In most parts of Great
Britain, Europe, and America, reversing is
universal; and the writer upholds it for four
distinct reasons: to avoid accident, as a cure for
giddiness, to vary the monotony, and because
those who can do It correctly can so adapt their
style and step as to-be able to waltz anywhere and
with anyone who can really waltz. The writer
adds: “As a rule I have found those who cannot
reverse always condemn it, and vice versa.” Our
correspondent has travelled, and, as a Judge of
dancing, no man in Australia is more competent to
speak.

On the 26th June, a marriage was cele-
brated whereby Miss Clara Drew, of the Glebe,
became Mrs. George Hewison, and In the evening
that important event was further celebrated by a
large party, at which 100 wore present, in the local
Town Hail. Guests as they entered were intro-
duced to the happy couple by the bride’s eldest
brother, who did the honours of the evening.
Dancing commenced at 9, and finished at the
reasonable hour of 3 a.m. A good spread was
made by CompagnonI, which gave teetotal plea-
sure, and sixteen dances were on the programme.
After half of them had been completed, a game
called “musical chairs” was introduced, in which
a large number joined, This lasted about half an
hour; It fojrned an agreeable break, and was a
thoughtful provision for thoso,ospeclally the young
ones, who could not dance. The bride, of course,
“ drew ” lots of admiration in her pretty oream
raolrd antique, draped with white and orange-
blossoms. Four little dots were bridesmaids; two
in pink cashmere and satin, and two in blue cash-
mere and satin. During the evening three of those
small maidens danced a Highland Fling creditably,
and a song or two wore given. One of the prettiest
dresses was that worn by Miss Myers, of Leich-
hardt, a pale blue and oream satin, adorned
uniquely with rows of rosebuds in silk crowelling.
In a very handsome white satin, adorned with
bullion fringe, with a gold band brought ovor each
shoulder, was a Glebe young lady, to whom the
company were indebted fora capital extra waltz—
the best of the evening, too. Two sisters wore
quiet and pretty in cream brochd and nun’s cloth:
a married lady was stately in a figured satin ot
silver grey; and a lady with a “pile" of golden
hair was rich in ruby velvet and pearls. MissN.
Collins wore black velvet, with cardinal silk inlets;
Miss Cooper was a casket of charms in pale pink;
and a graceful blonde beauteous as ever iu her
decking of fragrant violets.

At a recent Auckland (N.Z.) wedding, the
prospective bride at the last moment wanted to
gain some point from her future husband, and ho
would not consent. At the altar the bride point
blank refused to allow the knot to be tied, and the
ceremony was postponed sine die. Seeing then*
was no other means of conciliating hrt loved one,
the poor fellow gave way, and the marriage took
place on the following day.
» * *
At Gisborne (N.Z.) a couple attended the
Catholic Church for the purpose of getting married.
The ceremony hod proceeded to the point where
the priest put the question to the bridegroom.
“ Wilt thou take this woman to be thy lawful
wedded wife?” “I will," was the reply. “Wilt
thou take this man to be thy lawful wedded hus-
band?" said the priest to the bride. At that
moment a note was placed in her hand by a spec-
tator, containing something.” I will not, ’ said the
bride, who at once rushed out of the church and
disappeared. The wedding ceremony was thus
abruptly brought to an end. It’s quite easy to
guess the class of communication contained in
that note.
• • •
Within the Grenfell electorate, a comely
young widow recently got married privately and
secretly to “ one who spoke the Irish brogue, and
dressed in a suit of blue.” A priest of the Church
of Rome was requested to perform the ceremony,
but he refused; consequently, the services ot a
rival minister were secured for the occasion. Now,
it was a very naughty thing for the policeman to
get himself wedded without his superior’s leave, so
the affair was kept as quiet as most secrets are;
but as it became very apparent that the widow
had wedded again, her lord thought the time had
come for him to return his coat, and accordingly
he sent In his resignation. But, unhappily, at about
the same time his little game was discovered by
the authorities, who admonished and thou banished
him to a far country for throe mouths, at the ex-
piration ot which time his resignation would be
received, and he would bo at liberty to return to
his sorrowing wife—who, determining not to be
out-generalled, succeeded through the medium of
an obliging M.L.A., in procuring her husband’s
discharge from the force after ho had done about
a week's duty in the remote town to which he had
been removed, and just as he was beginning to
know the girls there, and cat cold mutton at night.
Ho returned and went about the tusk of complet-
ing the wedding ceremonies. The orthodox cake
was made, and preparatory to its distribution
among guests and friends, it was laid upon a table,
when an unceremonious and uninvited guest in
the form ot a mastiff entered, walked out into the
street unobserved with all the cake, and devoured
the greater portion before he was observed by the
mortified pair and their guests, who had to bo con-
tent. with plum-duff. Tne dog still lives, and thus
it endeth. The ex-policeman, having surrendered
his authority, couldn’t even arrest the canine on
a charge of larceny, or insulting conduct, or uou-
registratlon.

In a part of Germany an edict has just been
issued, and the police are to see it is carried out.
that no youth under 17 is to be admitted to a ball
or served with alcoholic beverages unless accom-
panied by his parents. To hal mosques the youths
ot the above ago are to bo admitted on no terras
whatever. Moreover—and this is the severest cut
of all—no youth under 16 is to be allowed to smoke
in the public streets. This is one of the most prac-
tically sensible things we have heard of. Our balls
are thronged by cheeky boys and chits of girls,
who grow cunning and wizened under the gas-
glare, when they ought to be in their little beds.
And some of the hobbledehoys are very lacile at
tilting brandy bottles into an oblique position.
Their parents often don’t know of it; and, if they
did, probably haven’t any control over them.
Moreover, smoking and spitting, swearing and
swaggering, are the only employments of many of
the very juvenile and very port youth of Sydney
long before they reach 16; and it would be good if
Robert the Peeler were empowered to seize upon
some of these rapid youths sometimes, and walk
them off on their little pink ear. And, further-
more, when they knot together on the street in
the hearing of ladies, and vent ribald foolishness
until the whole vicinity of their presence becomes
saturated with suggestions of gore, it would be
good if the gentle Robert were to take them to the
“Central,” and then and there, having Inverted
them and made the necessary modification in the
disposition of their apparel, administer correction
iu that primitive fashion familiar to their early
infancy which they have scarcely yet had time to
forget. It might Jar their juvenile dignity some-
what; but it would mend their manners, and make
the atmosphere of the ciiy a good deal purer.

Mr. Heath, principal of the Girls’ High
School, Auckland, has had the temerity to start a
crusade against feminine fashions, and has invoked
the authority of the Board of Education to com-
pel a rigorous course of physical education. And
the brave Board support iiim. What heroism this
Involves may be guessed, when it is told that
among other dreadful things, Mr. Heath says some
of the girls at his school are “sluggish and
slovenly,” and others have “uncouth ways,” be-
cause they won’t drill. Some can’t walk freely
because or “pull-backs;” while yet others of the
Eretty rebels, he distinctly avers—by reason of
igh heels and so on—have r ‘ poor legs! ” Now, wo
quite believe all this; but tell ns, Mr. Heath, just
whisper now, how did you collate all this valuable
information ?

He would be a very credulous person who
could believe that closing public houses at eleven
made a single drunkard one whit more sober. But,
even if it did, it’s very hard that decent people
should parch for his weakness; and it’s very hard
on theatre-goers—
A visitor goes
To one of these shows.
And four hours later come out —at the close,
It’s a little after eleven, suppose,
He can't get his nose
Into friend or foe’s
Where the good rod wine, or the lager flows;
And everyone knows
That to seek repose,
To get forty winks, or a decent doze,
When vainly his eye for a nip he throws,
And can't got a sniff—unlessunder the rose’’—
Is the cruellest acme of human woes.

What has justly oome to be regarded as
the event of the season in the go-ahoad “ City of
the Crows”—the Masonio Ball—happened on St.
John’s Day last. Ever since the large square cards,
adorned by the peerless hand wrltinr of Bro. Daly,
went out a few weeks ago, the fair ones have been
exercising their faculties of invention and Piste ia
tho construction of dresses. And the outcome did
them credit. The hall—tho Masons’ own hall, by
the way, with probably the premier floor of the
South—was fittingly decorated, the greenery and
rosery with which the walls were dressed being
interspersed with the mystic emblems of the order.
Not less than 300 were present, and not until after
midnight was there any perceptible thinning of
the numbers. We make no attempt to describe
what the ladies had good reason to be proud of—
the dresses. They were uniformly pretty and
becoming. The genial squire of Brookong lent his
presence, and, wnat is better, brought his three
daughters with him , all of whom looked charming.
There was rather a considerable sprinkling of
brides—among them the first bride of 8t. Mary’s,
whose ivory satin looked even prettier than it did
during the Triduum. Narandera contributed an-
other bride (a solicitor’s bride, too), and her attire
arrested a stare wherever it was seen Hitting.
Supper was spread in the lodge-room, and it
shared the fate of all good suppers. The stewards
were unremitting in their attentions to the guests,
and as a result wall-flowers were rare. The
orchestra was undqr the leadership of Bre. Broad-
hurst (an old friend of the Victoria Theatre), and
he kept things going until the whole programme
and a few extras had been exhausted.

The marriage of Miss Elizabeth Lalor to
Mr. A. W. Davidson, Public School teacher, last
Thursday, was a ceremony differing from the usual
nuptial proceedings. Both bride and bridegroom
are Friends, and were united according to the
usages of that society. Standing on a platform
facing those present, they uttered their vows, un-
assisted by any third person; but the pastor subse-
quently offered prayer, read the certificate of
marriage, and gave an address. His ministrations,
however, were no part of the act of marriage,
which was solemmized by the two alone. The
bride wore a travelling dress of navy-blue velvet
and white lace. You can’t always find a husband
and wife who are Friends. Tins may be read in
two ways.

Mr. and Mrs. Turner, of Elizabeth-street.
gave an enjoyable dancing evening at their rooms
on Wednesday week, to about 100 guests, when the
fun was kept up in a lively style till early morn-
ing. Among the haudeome toilets was noticeable
that of the hostess’ daughter, an elegant white
satin. Mrs. G. Eastway wore a Lyons grpsaraln
black silk, with diamond jewellery; Miss L. Phillips,
blue satin bodice and ecru cashmere skirt; and j
Mrs. J. Solomon, a fine white satin brooms, with
head trimming to match, &c.

There was a marriage of some interest at
Milan in May. It was that of Miss Monica Chis-
holm, daughter of a lady whoso name was, at an
early part of Australia 8 history, perhaps more
widely familiar than that of any other ot her sex—
Caroline Chisholm, the “ Emigrant’s Friend.” Even
now, after many years, the name is as a household
word. It is said the motto, “ Advance. Australia!”
was adopted for the Australian flag by Lord
Palmerston on her suggestion. Her daughter,
Miss Monica, has now become Mrs. Arthur Lloyd
Gruggan. * * *
On Friday, the German Club celebrated its
anniversary in the Club Rooms, Castlereogh-streeL
by a concert and soiree dansante. Oror a hundred
ladies and gentlemen were present. The concert
Included solos, glees, and various vocal and inatru~
mental selections by musicians whose national
names are harder to spoil than M January —assisted
by Mr. Malcolm and Miss St. Clair. Decorations of
greenery and Hags were abundantly disposed
around, and soma of the staid Teutons indulged in
cards, conversation, billiards, and beloved lager;
while others, more reckless, ventured on the giddy
whirl of the dancing floor. And it is giddy when
thej/ dolt; there’s no chandelier meandering in a
Gorman waltz. Herr Kretschmann and three as-
sistants played fine stringed music for the ball, and
the little affair went smoothly in every way.
* * •
On Friday, 13th July, the Balmain Rowing
Club hold their second annual ball. Encouraged
by their local success last year, this time they have
come over to the Sydney Towh Hall. Already 160
tickets are sold, with a week to the good for unde-
cided persons to make up their minds. Com-
pagnonI will eater, De Groen give the music, and ■
Turner and Co. do the wines. The programmes
are neat cards, with the Club cm a flag, and
a picture of the picturesquely situated boatshed,
and no doubt the dancers will lay them carefully
by as “ momentums ” of the ball. Mr. Ainsworth
is determined the whole affair shall be free from
the slightest objectionable feature. Fancy dress
optional.
* * *
Miss Gully, of Ashford College, Darling-
hurst, held her annual pupils’ social evening,m
the Town Hall, on the 36th June, when over 300,
including relatives and friends, were present.
Selections of music were followed by a drama, in
German, titled “Mary Queen of Scots, the scholars
taking parts. Then came dancing, which afforded
delectation to the young ladies, and lasted for some
hours. Refreshments were available, and all went
smoothly.
• • •
Professor West gave a Calico Apron and
Neck-tie party to his Ashfleld dancing class last
Tuesday night, in the School of Arts. The room
was prettily decorated, and some of the aprons
looked quite coquettish. The idea is this. Each
lady weaiS an apron of a certain colour, and pro-
vides a tie to match. The ties are Jumbled up'to-
gether, and one presented to each gentleman. The
latter has then to search for the apron which is of
a corresponding colour to the tie, and dance the
first dance with the wearer. This does away with
a good deal of stiffness and formality. The
principal dances were the new waltz and polkas,
and some of the more advanced pupils went
through the French Cotillion —not quite to the
Professor’s satisfaction. About a dozen pairs of
young folks were there, and danced quite prettily.
A little lady in a pink satin frilled skirt, with ever-
skirtof same coloured cashmere edged with swans-
down, seemed to dance oa air. One «f the adults,
who wore a cream satin dress with crimson apron,
and her hair coiled round the crown of her head,
also danced well. And if this cannot be said of all
the Professor’s pupils, it eertainly is through no
fault of his.

Nowhore perhaps has the dentist’s art obtained
such high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly we
are in no sense behind any other city. Visitors to
Sydney might, to test this, visit the establishment
of Messrs. Adolphe Gabriel and Company, 18 Wyn-
yard Square, two doors from Pfanlert’s Hotel.
Here the manufacture of every essential in the
profession is carried on. At the rear of the surgery
is a compact little factory where all the requisites
for supplying every dental defect in the human
mouth are made. Messrs. Gabriel and Co. (whose
only address is as above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial teeth to those
interested. There being two firms of the same
name in the Square, patients will oblige by paying
particular attention to the Christian name, Adolphe,

The Engineerin'.: Conversazione at the Ex-
hibition is a splendid lounge. You can go strolling
round, see your friends, stock your mind with
useful knowledge, and listen to delicious music
under the electric light, all for a well-worn shil-
ling. The City Band’s concerts are alone worth
more. Bicyclists can see the best and latest thing
in bikes; there is the human door, that rebukes
you if you either leave It open or banja: it shut,
by sedately closing Itself; there are electric experi-
ments, models of trams, Yankee “fakes” that are,
each in itself, the acme of Ingenuity; iced drinks,
miniature Australs, photos., plans, engines, guns,
machinery, furniture, a panorama, and light re-
freshments. All is so arranged in the large build-
ing that there is plenty of room to move about and
inspect comfortably. Many go night after night,
and it’s the popular promenade at present.
* * *
Last week, another “Ladies’ Night” was
given by the Petersham Owls, and the concert
portion of the programme was voted by all ns the
best yet. An array of talent was purveyed such
as can seldom be heard in the musical line except
at high-priced concerts, and the Owls give it free
(by invitation). Many encores wore desired by the
audience, who insisted on their being recognised.
The polished chairman wrestled in a most intrepid
manner with the formidable foreign names that
studded the programme, and in several instances
completely conquered them. Miss St. Clair, in a
fleecy dress of lace covering a satin underskirt,
was as artistic as ever; and Paladini sang an ex-
quisite solo from “ Martha ” in his best style.
Giammona sang twice, and his duet with Mrs.
Wood provoked a lot of appreciation. Herr Francik
played twice, his answer to the insistence of the
hearers being a sweet-toned solo on his violin.
Charles Malcolm, pianist, was set for two pieces,
which the audience multiplied to four, and his own
composition, “Passing Band,” was amongst them.
Kretschmann was in good form, as were Jefferson
and Phillips ; and several other amateurs added
their efforts. When the vocalization finished, there
was a short interval tor light liquoring and so on,
and then the chairs were removed, and dances
followed till midnight. The daughter of a lady
vocalist was one of the most favourite of partners:
a brunette, in black satin with cardinal sleeves and
bow, was attractive. Two fair sisters, in pink and
blue respectively, were from town ; a lady in a
brilliant golden satin, covered with black lace,
from Annandale; a surveyor’s charming sister in
pink llama; a blonde, in lavender silk and pearls,
excelled in featly tripping, and so did a pale blue
petite who lavoured with a timely dance 4uno.
Wo hoar that the Club is going to cover itself with
glory in a short time by a ball, concerning which
there are rumours of weird grandeur; but this
subject is—to be continued.

On Wednesday week, Mr. and Mrs.
King, of Jamberoo, entertained a number of
friends, on the occasion of their daughter, Isabella,
becoming Mrs. S. Cooke. Charming was the bride
in fawn satin, wreath and veil, also her maids
(Misses Cooke and Janet King) in cream satin, and
white muslin and lace. After the ceremony, and
breakfast to some two score guests, the twain
departed for Wollongong and Sydney, and the
invited guests danced till daylight.

His Excellency the Governor arrived in
Sydney from Melbourne on Saturday morning, and
on Monday afternoon he visited the Engineering
Conversazione. Several things were explained to
him. Lord Augustus was extremely delighted,
especially with the cup of tea offered to him by
Quong Tart. Quong has since enshrined the cup
among the Tart family jewels, and won’t allow it
even to be dusted. His Excellency said it was all
so nice and so instructive that he’d come again,
and endeavour to persuade Lady Loftus to accom-
pany him.

Northern society is still rather mixed. The Her-
berton (N.Q.) Masonic ball was a grand success,
none but Masons and “ respectable women ” being
admitted. Several fair creatures had imported
very costly dresses from the South for the occasion,
but were not allowed to be present, on the ground
that their morals weren’t up to concert, or, rather,
Masonic-ball, pitch. Of course, there were no
respectable men in the place except the Masons —
Humoured that the daughter of a cer-
tain Knight will shortly become a Baroness of
the Russian Empire....A few frien s dined with

Melbourne, to bid him farewell on starting for
Europe On the 3rd instant, Hon. George Coppin
was installed as Grand Master of Masons in Victoria
.. .The Normanby Bicycle and Tricycle Club, Mel-
bourne, held their first annual ball on Wednesday
week in the AthemBum. Large and stylish attend-
ance, Flock’s band, lavish decorations, and pretty
girls all combined to make it a thorough success.
.... Athletes in every branch seem to indulge in
balls in Victoria. Following the Bicyclists, the
members of the South Melbourne Swimming Club
had their annual ball, which received lots of patron-
age... The Botanical Gardens in Melbourne are
now available all day on Sundays, though great
objection was at first made to their being open
during church time. Just fancy, keeping God’s
own church closed to force people into gloom-
laden buildings!... .The noxt Bachelors’Assembly
at Nithsdale comes on the 7th July. This will con-
clude the first series. In August, another series
will begin, under a reconstituted committee, audit
is contemplated to have no visitors, as the number
of members is already so large... Next Wednes-
day “ Our Boys” will be repeated at Parramatta,
by the same amateurs as before, but in aid of the
Alfred C.C., who give the performers a compli-
mentary dance in the Masonic Hall after the
comedy is over.... On the 18th, Mrs. F. Wyatt gives
an evening and fancy dress party, to mark her
daughter’s birthday, at Pomona, Darlmghurst....
A ball was given in the Temperance Hall, Shell-
harbour, on the 33ud June, on a teetotal basis—
June 33nd, the second Young Winter Assembly
took place in the Oddfellows’ Hall, when the ton
of the town and cream of the country danced for
some six hours to Sherwin’s music, and went away
voting it a pleasant ball .. Grand Masonic Ball in
Windsor-, under distinguished town patronage,
noxt month Just a little “local blow." At Sir
William Jervois’s ball in N.Z., some six months
ago, the Maori newspapers gave Mrs. Thomas
Morrin credit for being the most handsomely
dressed lady present. Well, that dress was sent to
her from Sydney, and made in Wynyard-square.
On dit that a Melbourne doctor, known tor his
love of diamonds, is about to enter the silken
noose Mr. H. E. Lord is expected to arrive

Lawn tennis finds favour in many country towns
at present. Maitland boat Singleton lately in a
public contest. At Armidale, there was a tourna-
ment for a prize given by Mr. Surveyor Chard,
when Misses Hogarth and Bray gained a victory
over the two Post Office belles....A few youthful
heroes once clubbed together to give a Bachelors’
Ball, and asked a gilded youth to join them.
“Well,” responded the sapient one, “I don’t mind
a pound or two, but 1 don’t believo in those
bachelors’ balls. Give me a ball where there’s
plenty of girls!” A marriage is on the tapis be-
tween the doctor of a mail-boat and a well-known
young lady of Sydney. They met on the steamer
coming out, and decided not to part again — At
the last Hobart levee, the Mayor of that town ap-
peared in a splendid new court costume, all richly
ornamented with lace ani cut steel buttons, and
a real sword. Surely our Mayor can have a gold
chain, now!....At the Albury banquet, not
colonial wines, but imported ones, were drunk.
When we don’t encourage ourselves, how can the
rest of the world ? A school lor Art Needlework
has been started in Melbourne by a lady who was 1
instructor in the art at South Kensington school,
Loudon. It serves a double purpose: ladies can
learn the art thoroughly, as well as earn money at
it, and the general public can give orders for any
fancy work they desire, and it will be duly exe-
cuted.... A lady, writing to the Australasian,
proposes to cut the Gordian knot of servantgalism
by the employment of Hindoo domestic servants,
who, she guarantees, will give satisfaction for £3
10s. a year, and two suits of clothes. Their passage
costs about £15, and they engage for five years. ..
There was a ball at Wodonga, too, at the time of
the federal fuss. 40 gentlemen present and 30
ladies Herald, July 3: “Frederick Atterton to
Julia Salt,” &c. Must have our little thoughtless
joke. That idea of somebody’s wife being turned
into a pillar of salt, always staggered us. Rather a
hard pill-er to swallow. But we cheerfully offer
to believe this Salt will turn into a first-rate wife.
We hope it will be a turn for the better—There
was a good Oddfellows’ ball in Wagga on Thurs-
day; and a masquerade ball at Wentworth the
Thursday before; a Government House ball at
Perth on June 38th; and one given by the Mayor
of Glenelg same night. Sir Arthur Palmer gives
one at Brisbane on the 13th July, in honour or the
Queen’s Birthday... .The next Ladies’ Night of the
Liedertafel happens at the Protestant Hall on
Tuesday, 10th July, when visitors are particularly
requested to be punctual, so as not to disturb the
singing. A cloak room is /provided at each en-
trance, and both doors will be open—The first
Ashfleld Assembly of this season took place in the
School of Arts last Friday, when a good gathering
of fair ones and their flatterers had an evening’s
first-class dancing. It was managed by a com-
mittee, and a capital spread was arranged by Com-

will start punctually at half-past eight— Mascorte
was the scene of a merry birthday party, given by
Mrs. Mannlx to her daughter, on Monday. Dancing,
singing, and music whiled away the fleeting hours.
Hostess and daughter were bright and busy in
their efforts to help the guests float light on the
airy sea of happiness. The only thing that marred
their attempt was the elegant supper—a thing
which never helps anyone to “ float light.” — The

Bicyclists, and the less ambitious adepts
who drive three wheels, are preparing’ for the
forthcoming amateur race meeting of the Sydney
Bicycle Club, which is to be held on the Association
Ground on August 4. There are a lot of prizes
provided, besides the honour and the spills, so
that there will be distinction for every com-
petitor, from the spider-legged hero who fancies
himself for the ten-mile championship, to the
aspirant.
The South Melbourne Football Club has
sent over their trainer. Jinks, to put the final
polish on the team for the Sydney matches. Great
interest is centred in the combination match, to be
played on the Association Cricket Ground on the
14th Instant. Most of the leading Melbourne clubs
now employ one or more trainers for the season.
Football has come to something in Victoria.
The Paris correspondent of the London
Times says:— “There is not a contemporary figure
of more intrinsic and imposing grandeur than Leo
XIII. In that vast and expansive intelligence no
narrow thought can enter. No one can better sift
the immutable in his dogma from what is capable
of transformation; and whenever Prussia has only
sacrifices to ask of him belonging to the domain
where his will does not come in collision with the
insurmountable barrier of dogma, Leo XIII. will
place his hand resolutely in the Chancellor's, and
the two men will be proud of meeting and acknow-
ledging each other.”
Some time ago Mr Ryan, otherwise
Chaplin, arrived at Hamilton, Vic., looking as in-
nocent as it was possible for him to do, and had
not been hero many hours before a match tor £lOO
a-side was made between him and Neaves, who
had previously beaten Louis Watts in a hop, step,
and jump match. Ryan won the event easily, and
returning to Hamilton, took up his quarter's at the
Criterion Hotel. Shortly after, a rumour got
about that another illustrious stranger had arrived,
and had expressed himself desirous of “clipping
that fellow Ryan’s wings.” This was Lawson, alias
Arnold, who put up at Host Ferguson’s, where
Ryan went to inspect him, "just to see what sort
of a fellow he is.” After some coquetting, a
match was arranged between the two, £5O a-sido
was deposited, and great was the excitement.
However, tor very excellent reiisous, the race
didn't come off. The pair are now at Bourke,
where, the other day, Chaplin easily raced away
from Combardello Billy. It is doubtless if in his
present fine form, there are many or any taster
men than Chaplin in Australia. He is probably
the best “all-round-man” in the colonies. Amongst
other exceptional feats, Chaplin will take level
money up to a good round sum that he jumps six
feet high, and a shade of odds that he can clear one
inch more in three tries. On a previous visit to
Bourke, for a wager of £2O, he absolutely walked
up to a jump of exactly sft. 10in.. and cleared it
without any apparent effort. With such prowess
as this, Chaplin should be a rich man at forty. For
any distance over the 100, Arnold can leave his
friend behind every yard. He has just returned
from Walgett, where he has vainly tried to arrange
a match with the blackfellow’s (Combardello
Billy’s, or some other name) backers. They, how-
ever, fought shy for some reason, notwithstanding
that the blacktellow has easily beaten everything
he has met of late, including some first-class men.

George Gardiner was a tutor in the house
of Mr. Monckton, J.P., of Bradford. One day this
tutor, having no doubt worked his head off in
drilling Into the idiotic young Monkles Just such
Latin, Greek, and Sanscrit as the British snob exacts
from poor scholars, went to the cellar and helped
himself to a glass of beer. Mr. Monckton’s butler,
being duly on the alert In case of revolutionary
scholars trenching on his preserve, gave the British
Justice notice of the tragedy. And the scholarly
George was arraigned for stealing sixpen’orth of
beer. And Mr. Monckton sat on the bench, but,
says the cautious county newspaper, “took no
part In the proceedings.” Gardiner was sent to
gaol for six weeks. Now. after our experience of
the ways of Judges, is it any marvel that wo
wonder what “ taking no part ” means ? Over the
walnuts and the wine, with Messieurs the Justices
spending the evening in the house of Mr, Monck-
ton, J.P., we fancy the conclave of retired sugar-
sanders, and chalk-milk-waterers, holding their
glasses up to the light, and hearing the dismal tale
of aanscvXoLteUm of the reprobate scholar. And we
also recall the scenes so well caricatured In Field-
ing, where the needy curate (the schoolmaster of
those days) by sufferance receives his half-pint of
alo, and some cold meat with the servants—and im-
plores God’s blessing over it. The transaction is
like cutting out a slice from an old geological
formation. It shows that the old estimate of
learning was no caricature, as far as the English
squires r notions wont. But it also furnishes the
reason why the most violently democratic men in
Russia, Franco, and Germany are also scholars.
When knowledge is brought to the stocks, is it any
wonder that knowledge allies itself with violence,
and will prefer the chance product of chaos to the
smug selfishness of an old and ignorant age ?

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
Aii unusual scene took place the other
day in Rome. Pope Pius IX.’s effects were sold by
auction as if the family were completely ruined,
and were trying to make the utmost penny by a
great name," whereas the smallest missal should
have been kept a sacred family relic for ever-
‘ What have you to say for yourself?”
asked the presiding magistrate of a female who
was charged with drunkenness at one of the subur-
ban police courts in Melbourne. “ Please, your
‘ Honor,’ ’’ replied the bilious lady, “ I was at the
Salvation Army meeting last night, or I would not
be hero now ”
In Victoria the cause of a rational Sunday
is espoused by the Akgus and the Age, while the
side of Pharisaism is supported by the rusty
artillery of the D T. On one side, Intellect,
culture, and manhood; on the other, hypocrisy,
bigotry, and masculine petticoatlsm. Mesdames
Chadband and Stiggins have high pattens and big
mops, but the wave of public opinion will be
what the Atlantic was to Mrs. Partington. Now
verrimB.
The infant son of a Grenfell squatter was
about to die, and a R.C. priest was called in to per-
form the rite of baptism. But, when the eccle-
siastic discovered that a Protestant lady was to be
the godmother of the dying child, he refused to
perform the ceremony. Whereupon the Infants,
father told the father of the church that “ he was
too well paid and fed, or he wouldn’t display such
contemptible bigotry." Eventually, a C.E. min-
ister performed the required rite.
The Melbourne D.T. is the only paper in
that city which stands by the parsons in their cry
for a cold, cheerless. Puritanical Sawbath. This
consumptive production, which was started for
the purpose of enlightening the working man, cries
out for the closing of the Museum at all cost on the
Lord’s day, and its new line of holy war has given
a temporary flicker of life to a one-lunged consti-
tution. When the parsons are quietly rolled up,
and the public of Melbourne have all their institu-
tions open, the D.T. will silently go under.
Stockwhip Kelly, on the dying out of the
aboriginal before the missionary, raises a question
which the missionary will find it difficult to
answer. And the missionary can’t avoid the
question by asking “ Am I my brother’s keeper,’
when it’s his special line to pose as his (black)
brother’s special protector, guide, philosopher, and
friend. The missionaries (says Kelly), compass sea
and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
compassed they either make him twofold more the
child of hell than themselves, or rub him out—an t
Kelly’s not much out of it.
The Maitland Mercury considers that if
Sunday concerts are allowed, a State censorship of
stage and platform will be indispensable. But
what can a State censor do ? He can only prohibit
immoral entertainments, and for that purpose we
have a censorship already. A concert or lecture
that is plainly immoral may be stopped at any
time, and if such things are wrong at any time,
they are no less wrong on Sunday. The only
censorship possible is public opinion. Public
opinion has shown its censorship by pretty well de-
serting the churches, and public opinion will
refuse to be dictated to by a handful of fanatics as
to how the people shall spend their Sundays.
Melbourne Punch writes thus about the
Hon C. H. Bromby “ Bromby, the apostate, has
been considerably sold over that little Town Hall
business. Ho thought he had managed it so nicely
undercover of a name on which he is doing his
best to bring disgrace, but the wily Patterson, on
the look out for Protestant votes, was one too
many for the renegade. The Mayor made him a
very pretty little speech, and we trust he enjoyed
it It is bad enough to put up wltn balderdash
about Ireland and Catholicism when it proceeds
from a native-born traitor, but when it is forced
upon us by a whitewashed Paddy and pervert, it is
too. too sickening. He is going to bring an action
because ho was not allowed to spout sedition in the
civic palace. Let him, and much good may the
damages do him and his cause.”
Bishop Selwyu, addressing an audience
over in Victoria, the other day, remarked that
“ some people said the natives of the islands were
savages, but he doubted that very much, having
road of crimes in the colonies and iff England, which
were of such enormity that they were unknown
there.” In the face of this statement, we should
like to know what excuse can be made for scoop-
ing up collections every other week to christianise
the heath*m. If Bishop Seiwyn is right-as, of
course, wo believe him to be —then it would be
mo e to the fflory of God to heathenize the Chris-
tian. For our own part we shall be willing at any
time, to contribute to a fund for bringing Poly-
nesian missionaries over here to convert us. we
shall first stipulate, however, that they shall not be
allowed to sell rum. That is the privilege of the
white proselytizers.
A Dunedin (N.Z.) parson, Rev. Fitchett,
lately publicly criticised the Salvation Army. He
save to the hundreds of young women who were
present at the "Salvation tea” in the Garrison
Hall for factory girls, seamstresses, and domestic
servants, that the Army meetings have brought
nightly scenes of excitement, late hours, and a
new code of easy and sympathetic rela ions with
a corresponding number of young men. It is
true that all this is supposed to be under the
sanction and guardianship of religion, but no one
acquainted with the history of religious excite-
ments, and their tendency when not controlled to
run into a particular form of immorality, will see
much ground for reassurance in that. The truth
is, that the Army has been perverted from the
simplicity of its original mission, which was that
of evangelising the classes not reached by existing
Church agencies.
General Booth’s latest is a “freeand easy,”
assisted by his wife and daughter. Big Ben, a
Yorkshire" fighting man, obliged with ‘The Devil
and me, we can’t agree,” which was much appre-
ciated. It is not much good for anyone to address
a Salvation crowd, unless he has been a prize-
fighter, or a wife-beater, or a burglar. They are
the only kind of orators the audience care to listen
to If the speaker hasn’t been a “ regular tearer
at wickedness, he is of no account at all. In the
London .Standard of April IS, is an account of a
"long all-night” meeting in a circus, the chief
portion of the service consisting of "creeping for
lesus " In order to show their utter humility, the
salvation seekers—of all ages, sexes, and characters
—crawled round on the floor for two hours, in
complete darkness, the gas having been purposely
turned off. When those methods of seeking salva-
tion are adopted, it is scarcely surprising to hear
of a girl summoning a pious lieutenant for assault.
The Encyclical of Leo XIII. to Cardinal
M'Cabe, summarised, reads in this wise:—Ireland
in a fix. Grievous oppression on one hand; on the
other, perplexing agitation running many into
turbulent courses. Catholic bishops did well to
exhort moderation. So long as Kingdom of God
and His justice be first sought, it is lawful for the
Irish to contend for their rights; but justice is not
to be found in secret societies, which, under pre-
text of vindicating right, end in violent disturb-
ance of the public peace. It is for the bishops to
exhort all Irishmen, by the holiness of the Catnollc
name, and by the very love of their country, to
have nothing to do with secret societies, which are
powerless to obtain what the people rightly ask,
and too often impel to crime those who have been
fired by their allurements. It is *or the younger
clergy "to be obedient to episcopal authority. The
statesmen who preside over British Imperial affairs
will give satisfaction to the Irish when they de-
mand what is just.
A deputation who waited on the Archbishop
of Canterbury from the Church Defence Associa-
tion, presenting a petition from 13,650 clergy
"against the removal of the name of the Supreme
Deitv ” from the House of Commons declaration,
as proposed in the Affirmation Bill, must have been
rather surprised at. their answer. The Archbishop,
while declining to go fully into the matter, sain
ho must express his conviction that the absence of
any formula would not necessarily imply unbelief,
tost as upon admission to the cure of souls m our
own times a declaration has been placed in the
mouth of tho curate instead of the oath. It was
by a declaration that tho clergyman repudiated the
crime of simony; by a declaration that ho signified
his assent to the Thirty-nine Articles and the Book
of Common Prayer, and also acknowledged his
obligation to use no other form ot worship than
that in the Book of Common Prayer; and, again,
supposing that bv any moans tho words of the oath
wore removed from the declaration made on enter-
ing Parliament, he should be the last to admit that,
after that moment, Parliament had lost ite Chris-
tian character, or could be less called on than now
t, > handle public questions in a religious and Chris-
tian spirit.
The Auckland Free Library have just re-
ceived f rom England 39 volumes of the works of
Swedenborg. We have read 38 of them, and it is
to tho speculations of that philosopher that we
attribute our clear views on the condition of the
dead. They are nice, popular reading, and we can
conceive of no greater pleasure than to retire into
the country with a pocket edition of say 100
volumes of his work. Prom his own system, we
gather that he is now up in tho seventh heaven.
He had a fair time in the tirst six, but he tore him-
self away from the frivolous enjoyments current
in the lower heavens, and went up higher. Ho
saw nothing in the everlasting twanging of harps,
and strolling about golden streets. So he chipped
off enough of the kerbing to pay for the trip, and,
employing two sturdy angels, went up to No. 7.
His occupation at this time consists chiefly In
reading over his own works, and working out cir-
culating decimals. At last reports ho was calcu- .
luting a decimal to a million places, with a view to '
measure eternity ; and the only amusement he
takes is in instigating mankind to read his works.
His followers assert that a new edition is forth-
coming, edited by himself, and that he will shortly
lower liimself down here by a piece of string, and
start to hawk his books.
One of the blessings that follow In the
wake of Christianity is undoubtedly brandy. And
the brandy is none the worse lor being dispensed
to the benighted savage by a Wesleyan local
preacher. And it is not deteriorated by being dis-
pensed at 10s. a bottle on Sundays. One Maori in
N.Z. grow sick of the theology of his fathers, and
went up to the penitent form at a revival meeting.
He found salvation in less time than any other man
in the room, and bragged ns much. 1 he mission-
aries drilled him in catechism. He became a burn-
ing and shining light in class and prayer meetings,
and ultimately was appointed a local preacher.
His ministrations were marked by a tine fervour,
and the work of the Lord prospered in his hands.
Now came the opportunity. He had banished i he
blanket of his fathers, and clad his regenerated
frame in broadcloth. By strict attention to the
collection-box, he was enabled to add to his
spiritual gifts a choice collection of Hennesse3's
brandy; and on the Sabbath, after exhorting the
brethren, he would tip the wink, and begin busi-
ness. One half-sovereign was his price for a
bottle; and if he didn’t succeed in converting his
aboriginal friends, he at least made them drunk.
He was caught, and fined £38 for this. That’s how
enterprise is checked in these days.
’Tis abundantly evident that the published
reasons given to the Victorian Premier bv the
Rev. Mr. Paton (a retired gospeller living m com-
fort at Kew) why the New Hebrides should be
annexed by the Imperial authorities are pot for-
ward at the Instigation of the cocounut-oil mission-
aries. As a sample of his mealy-i#-uthed white-
chokerism take this little hiccup: “All the men
and all t e money (over £14000) used in civilizing
and Christianising the New Hebrides have been
British. Now fourteen missionaries ..... and
about fifteen native evangelists and teachers are
employed in the above work on this jfroup, in
which over £6000 yearly of British and Br tish-
colonial money is expended. And certainly it
would be unwise to let any other Power now take
possession and reap the fruits of all this British
outlay.” Of course it would, Mr. Paton. \oure
pretty fat on the real British gospel, you are,
sirree! £6000 per annum of Uritisn coin spent
there! For what, brother? To improve die
nigger off the face of the airth as has been done in
Tasmania! But this pat *un also thinks that
Britain should go for tho New Hebrides because
there are 70,000 Hebrideans awaiting the gospel.
Lot ’em want. They’ll bo more hybrideans when
they’ve got it. That’s so. Lot us prey I
If the Queen doesn’t go straight to heaven
when she dies, money must be no consideration up
there. The Dean of Windsor is paid £3000 a year to
smooth Her Majesty’s path, and gets perks
besides. £350 is his fee for a funeral. This makes
dying very expensive. He also gets £o00 a year
for keeping spare bedrooms in his house (which
he has rent free, of course), for Royal chaplains
and other theological swells, who come to Windsor
for ceremonies. The Deanery is a most delightful
house, comfortably and well-arranged inside, and
with a terrace commanding one of the finest views
in England; while beneath, on a level with the
slopes, in the Queen’s private grounds, the Dean
has a largo and prettily-arranged garden, where
Dr. and Mrs. Wellesley used to give afternoon
parties. The work is very light, for the Dean has
four Canons (each £1000 a year), and four minor
Caucus (each £200), to assist him in doing* the
chapel duty—perhaps the closest approximation to
doing nothing obtainable in these days, ion or
course, Her Majesty’s sou* needs no saving. This
recalls tho indignant surprise of the J rench noble-
man jirt before the Revolution, who on being re-
monstrated with by an eccentric priest, haughtily
remarked that “the Almighty would never have
tho bad taste to damn a man of his rank.
Thus a correspondent auent Mrs. Hatnp-
son:—“For weeks past she has numbered her
daily and nightly audiences by thousands, and this
in the face of tho counter attractions of the regu-
lar churches, and of the regular shows. Dr. Moor-
house cannot do it, Mr. Strong connot do it, the
Very Rev. Father in God, Prior Butler, cannot do
it. the Revs. Clark, Menzies, and Jones, in their
palmiest days, could not do it —wherein, then, lies
the wonderful influence - f this woman. She is
handsome, but not very young; she is not well-
educated, she is not even eloquent; and yet she
draws crowds together such as have never before
been assembled by any man or woman in Aus-
tralia. It may be vril force, or it may be animal
magnetism, or it may be Heavea-knows-what; but
it is altogether unexplicable and marvellous. Bet
all parsons look from their empty pews to the seeth-
ing masses which nightly crowd Melbourne Town
Hall to suffocation, and road the riddle If they can
—it is above the comprehension of ordinary lay-
men. I heard her this morning, and her words are
tingling in my ears as I write; and when she can
thus affect an old pressman, whose heart has been
hardened by the cant of religion for more years
than he would care to mention, what a spell she
must throw over the imagination of tuose Tv".°
have been less exposed to the wickedness of this
world!
A Tasmanian correspondent writes thus to
the N.S.W. Liberal,:— the late prosecution
for obscene literature in Launceston, just fancy
them suppressing Dr. Trail’s ‘ Sexual Physiology,
and ‘ Maria Monk.’ It is thought by many that
the Popish party have had much to do with it, on
account of ‘ Marla Monk,’ ‘ Woman, Priest, and
Devil,’ and ‘ Woman and the Confessional, which
Osborne publicly advertised for sale. The Super-
intendent of Police, who had the books seized, is a
Roman Catholic. The real fact of tlie matter is it
being a ‘ Freothought Bookshop.’ This being the
case, Protestants and Catholics are allied to put it
down, and they have (in my opinion) only made
the ‘Obscene Literature’ a pretext for action.
Not content with destroying the books, they have
5iven Osborne three months. Mr. w. B. Button,
,P . is talking about having a pamphlet printed
on the subject, and he is going to write to the
Attorney-General about it.” The so-called Free-
thought” booksellers have, in our opinion, much
to answer for. Freethought doesn t necessarily
mean free-love, any more than it moans filth and
pruriency in general; yet at almost every so-called
44 Freethought 99 book-shop you tind exposed for
sale publications which are a great deal more
filthy than they are scientific. Perhaps the reason
is that the “ Freethought ” bookseller finds science
and philosophy, properly so-called, don t pay. The
man who leaves the paths of orthpdoxy by reason
of the impressions produced on his mind by Tom
Paine and Voltaire, may still be good and true and
moral. But the individual who habitually buys
and gloats over such books as Maria Monk Mid
“Sexual Physiology, ’* is and must be filthy-minded,,
and is not a fit associate for even a leprous China-
man. And the bookseller who gets his living bv
the sale of such publications should be flogged.
“ Maria Monk ” &c., are openly exposed for sale in
a dozen shops in Sydney.
Mrs. Hampson, who for the last couple of
months has turned out In Melbourne a goodly
number of hysterical females, and who, before her
•• mission ” is finished, will have earned the un-
feigned thanks of all the doctors of Oollins-street,
and the curses of the men whose female relatives
have been worked up into religious mania, has
been doing a wholesale pray. She has been pray-
ing for gambling ministers of religion, and was
thanked publicly by the Kev. Mr. Campbell, who
stated that he was "within fifteen minutM of
hdl, and was saved by her prayers. She has been
praying for the three hundred profane labourers
who are engaged in demolishing Kensington Hill,
but who have declined in bad English, though in
good taste, the proffered compliment. She has in
fact pray, d for everybody, and has not forgotten
the Pre«s of Melbourne in her supplications. She
made a special intercessory effort with Heaven on
behalf of the staff of the Melbourne Herald,
who, to our own personal knowledge, really want
praying for very oadly. George Arthur Walstab,
the editor, is by no means a saint—never has been;
the eminent Mr. Joseph Geary, author of the
aphorism, " If ever a man wants to sell you a horse
cheap, ask him why,” is not at all likely to go to
Heaven suddenly in the Harmy’s fiery van: Jem
Middleton, the head of the reporting staff, is, we
are sorry to have to say, like Brodzky, a most be-
nighted heathen; and if you want to hear ingeni-
ous, forcible, and protracted blasphemy, you
should go to the composing room when the
"formes” are late, and Winter is giving a bit of
his mind to Hannon. It will be observed that we
have said nothing about the moral condition of the
Police Court reporters, who are, from an evan-
gelical standpoint, very bad hats indeed. The
other day, after Mrs. Hampson had prayed for
Sam Winter and the staff, “ an Ardent Be-
liever ” communicated the fact in writing to
Samuel, who in acknowledging, through the me-
dium of a foot-note, the Interest taken by the lady
in the spiritual welfare of the staff, rudely disil-
Jusionisod the ardent one as to the benefit of her
prayers in inducing the Herald to give more
attention to religious subjects. The fact was, re-
marked S.V.W., that the Herald was a newspaper
which attended to everything, from sermons and
revivals to divorce cases and dog fights. We want
Mrs. Hampson to come to Sydney and pray for the
editor of the Holy Howl. She might at the same
time ask Mumbo to send Alfred a better class of
ink, and try to arrange for a little more go in the
Herald leaders, for the suppression of six-column
muffin-worry reports, for the poll-axelng of the
persons who write the Witness, and for the deifi-
cation of John Davies.

Mr. Martin Hoskins, town missionary,
Ballarat, thus:—" I do believe that there are minis-
ters of religion at the present day—men who are
supposed to be shining lights-ignoring temper-
ance. In the morning, before they go to service,
they must have whisky and milk: if they go to a
wedding, they take drink; and they even go into
bar parlours and take intoxicating liquors. Now,
what Sydney cleric is there who can lay his hand
upon his heart and say that he has nover.drank
whisky and milk?... Professor Strong, o| Mel-
bourne University, has given great offence *6 the
Catholic members of the Ballarat Mechanics Insti-

Felix Oswald, lu the Popular Science
Monthly, says, in opposition to Buckle, that
fanaticism is not the result, but the cause of
ignorance ... At Loudon Central Criminal Court a
member of the Peculiar People, who follow out
the Bible injunctions in cases of sickness, and
refuse to call in a doctor, was brought up for trial
for manslaughter, in allowing his child to dl© or
bronchitis by applying no other remedy than
prayer. The grand jury, however, appearing to
think that he was bound to obey his Bible, ignored
the bill, and he was discharged . . . From the W11 ts-

"A LEAP IN THE DARK.”
I know not it a Heaven there be,
Or if a fiery Hell;
Through the dim space I cannot see.
Nor aught of Future tell.
But this I know, there is a land
Whore God takes true men by the hand.
I have no faith in Idle Creeds —
I scorn the bigot. Sect:
Can aught that vile dissension breeds
Be from God’s hand direct ?
I know not all, buf this I know,
Religion oft is God’s chief foe.
I rest my hope not on the dreams
That cloud the frenzied mind,
Nor on harsh Dogma that oft teems
With chains that free souls bind,
I take it, God would have us bo
True men, erect, unbound, and free.
I hold that not “ brimstone and fire,”
Nor yet cold prison bars.
Are means by which God would Inspire
Hate of wnat His Truth mars.
God never meant that cruel chains
Should form our heaven-wing d chariot s reins-
So, though I know not aught of Heaven,
Nor yet of awful Hell,
I know to Creed it ne’er was given
Free souls to buy and sell.
If our God’s worship be not free.
As slaves we’ll but blasphemers be.
And here I tell those who would thrust
Down free men’s throats their creeds,
Their gilded faith is Devil’s dust—
Their laws such as Hell breeds!
While Saints elect themselves they deem,
By word and deed they God blaspheme I
