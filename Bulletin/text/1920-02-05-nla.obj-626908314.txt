“My Commonplace Book,”
By J. T. HACKETT.
NOW ON SALE AT THE BOOKSHOPS.
THIS volume, issued in London, has had
a wonderful reception in Great Bri-
tain. The leading newspapers and reviews
have published splendid notices. The fol-
lowing extract is a fair sample:—
“My Commonplace Book” _is treasure-
trove ; it belongs to the State. '"lts peculiar
charm is indescribable. It is an anthology
bearing on every page, the mark of the com-
piler’s personality. Mr. Hackett might
have written a book of literary criticism;
he has done far better by merely giving us
the key to his great collection of jewels. His
volume has the effect of an original book in
the Elian sense. His taste is perfect, both
eclectic and sensitive, his reading limitless,
his aim always the highest. This is simply
the contents of a refined scholar’s notebook,
filled in only as his own taste and fancy dic-
tated. Kindred spirits will hail it as one
of the finest things of its kind ever pub-
lished.

Theft and Borrowing
Sliakspeare was a magnificent stealer;
xennyson embodied whole passages of older
writers in his work ; scores of fine phrases
in our best verse-makers are lifted from the
ureek or Latin. How far is such stealing
to be allowed? From the point of view of
the reader it matters nothing what the
source of a phrase or an idea may be as long
as the writer makes an effective use of it.
Much that is akin to stealing, yet subtly
different, goes on from age to age; and it
was actually a canon of eighteenth century
criticism that every line of a poem could be
picked to pieces and each portion traced to
its source. What happens, however, in most
cases is vastly removed in principle from
burglary. The lover of verse reads far and
wide and remembers well. When lie writes
the old remembered words come flooding into
his thought, the sources quite forgotten ; and
they go down on the written page without
any consciousness of the fact that they have
been used before.
This experience must be common to almost
every modern verse-maker, for traces of it
flash out in the most unexpected places.
Who would expect Tennyson to borrow from
Tom Moore? But Tom Moore was a very
popular writer in Tennyson’s youth, and the
borrowings can be very easily followed.
Moore wrote:—
Thou of the hundred fights,
Thou on whose burning tongue
Truth, peace and freedom hung.
Tennyson wrote:—
He that gained a hundred fights.
And later on in the same poem :
For one upon whose hand and heart and brain
Once the weight and fate of Europe hung.
The parallel is close enough, but the writers
might have reached the words independently.
What proves their connection is that Moore
is writing of the death of Nelson and Tenny-
son of the death of Wellington. Moore was
probably quite forgotten, but an echo re-
turned to Tennyson from his youthful read-
ing when a similarity of subject touched
some sub-conscious chord. Curiously enough,
Moore himself acknowledges his phrase “of
the hundred fights” to ancient Irish writers;
so the borrowing had been continuous. Again,,
in “Morte D’Arthur” the line “This way and
that dividing the swift mind” is a direct
translation from Virgil, who directly trans-
lated it from Homer. From whom Homer
borrowed it only the ruins of Ivnossos may
guess. Even Milton picks up a trifle here
and there. Here is a fragment of the lost-
play of Sophocles, “The Mysians,” as trans-
lated by Sir George-Young :
And many a Phrygian dulcimer, and crash
Harmonious of the Lydian psaltery,
Sounds to it, in linked measures, long drawn out.
Compare Milton:—
In notes with many a winding bout
Of linked sweetness long drawn out.
Such borrowings are, however, very under-
standable and very far removed from theft.
The borrowing of subjects has never been
seriously called in question. It has been a
very ancient practice; and without it the
world would have been a lot poorer. The
Persian story of “Sohrab and Rustum,” told
by Matthew Arnold, appears in very similar
form in Macplierson’s Ossian. It must have
been known in countries as far apart as
India and Ireland before the Christian era;
and a later historical setting in no way
affects the original tale. It is open to any-
one to _ improve on it to-day and lay the
scene at Manly.
How far some hereditary memory working
through the sub-conscious may account for
revivals it is hard to say. In a little play,
“The Harp that Once,” I wrote of a harp
whose various strings each touched the source
of a primal emotion, two or three years be-
fore I knew that there was exactly such a
harp in Irish legend. I would have bor-
rowed the story cheerfully, but it borrowed
itself before I was aware. Two or three
times I have found a phrase or an imaginary
detail which I have used in telling an old
tale exactly echoed in some transcript of an
ancient fragment which I had not seen at
the time.
The test of all borrowings, conscious or
otherwise, must be the improvement in set-
ting made on the original.. Language, how-
ever flexible, has its limitations; few phrases
are without a brother or sister. It is when
verse is written in the simplest possible way
that it lends itself least to plagiarism. After
all, simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve;
and the verse, unquotable in phrases, which
stirs a real emotion, is likely to be the
purest and best. But no writer has any
patent rights in language. It is rather irri-
tating to find a line directly taken from your
verse _in another man’s work, but the fact
that it doesn’t fit well in its new place is
compensation of a sort. Anyhow, you have
plenty of other lines where that came from,
while he is probably suffering from a rhyth-
mic drought.
The criticism of verse which lays undue
stress on imitations and echoes is generally
bad. Take the work as it stands. The
alleged borrowings won’t have been worth
borrowing unless they fit; and if they do fit
all’s well for the reader, as Shakspeare knew.
Only last year a Melbourne critic accused
me of borrowing from- writers I have never
read and whose work was. published later
than mine! If I had accomplished that feat
I might have felt rather proud of it; -for
even Shakspeare didn’t borrow much from
Alexander Pope. Generally speaking, the
wilful plagiarist is a bit of a nuisance and
a big bit of a failure; but the unconscious
plagiarist is practically every verse-maker.
To keep entirely off other men’s grass would
be to limit the standifag-room to a plot of
earth about six feet by two.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Arthur Schnitzler and Casanova
Granville Barker put on some of the
Anatol series of'one-act plays in London in
1914. himself playing Anatol. The wit and
sparkle even of the translations made the
things successful, helped by Lillah
McCarthy’s dramatic personality, but not
at all by that of Barker. He, it was de-
cided, was an excellent, sometimes inspired,
producer, but as an actor was anything but
inspired. Anatol, as the Red Page has said,
is brilliant and most engaging matter. In
London the amorous adventures of the
Viennese bachelor about town were. success-
ful as amusing freaks, risque, certainly, but
sinee they were obviously as imaginary and
impossible as “The Merry Widow,” harmless
enough, provided you were grown up. In
Vienna they were ordinary dramatic cur-
rency, the reflections of current thought,
produced and successful by reason of their
good construction and literary delicacy.
All that Viennese stuff, which mostly got
to us in the musical comedies of Franz
Lehar and others, is sensual and cruel, as
the music is. In its littleness it has the
barbaric quality of the Roman saturnalia's
greatness. Its acceptance of conjugal in-
fidelity as an ordinary incident is quite
nonchalant; the romance of life lies appa-
rently in the direction and possible success
of the passing infidelity. Vienna applauded
the “happiness” of the “lover,” and condoled
with him upon ' his failures; the absolute
moral correctness and good form of his con-
duct were never for a moment in doubt.
One would say that all the simple things
were gone hence, that social intercourse and
its faiths and debts were all pul on a differ-
ent footing, reputedly by the growth of
knowledge, the broadening of the public mind
in the cities. One wondered for a moment
about the parents and grandparents; but
all that childishness, with the nursery tales
of romance and fidelity, Vienna had changed.
Life was not like that; life was —here
the war appropriately interrupted the game,
and the last stage of Vienna’s downfall
began.
Casanova, who flourished from the middle
to the end of the 18th century, left as his
memoirs one of the extraordinary documents
of history, lie spent most of his life in
banishment from his beloved native Venice,
wandering up and down Europe in search
of adventure. His memoirs describe those
adventures, fully half of which are amorous,
in meticulous, garrulous detail. His gloat-
ing over these details of his encounters with
serving-maids, with the ladies of the castles,
with chance companions in public vehicles,
with the wives of his friends, is as hideously
honest as it is revolting. Venice in its de-
cadence had nothing but praise«for “gal-
lantry” ; the honest recital of a series of
amorous successes was never out of the
way; the documents were “useful now for
social history” and so on. But Casanova was
a pig; he began where the other gossipers
stopped. He was a confessed degenerate
who saw nothing unusual in his confession.
The book throws the bewildered reader from
back-stairs to post-chaise, from brothel to
ambassador’s palace, and stands him up as
a distressed spectator of the antics of two
or even four apes. The thing might have
been written by a dirty schoolboy or a mad
old man.
But it must have beep some reflection of
the Venetian thought of that day. Casanova
had many friends in his native town with
whom he foregathered when he could. These
formed a set of aristocratic dilettanti, dab-
bling with the arts and the intellectuals,
living careless lives, but holding their jobs
as senators and active Government officers.
It may be that they took the modern critic’s
view of Casanova as an engaging rascal;
but it is certain that he was one of them-
selves. He died in 1798, and took his dirti-
ness and engaging rascality with him.
It is impossible to think that he was other
than exceptional in any age ; one must ke *p
some rags of faith in one’s brother. But
his memoirs indicate the thought of his
time as surely as if he were a type instead
of an exception. As a Veifbtian possibility
of the 18th century, he is a sign of the
background from which he stood out.
When, up in the north, the Revolution
burst in Paris, the noise and .destruction
of it swelled down in a few years" to Venice.
Napoleon’s taking the city in hand a year
before Casanova’s death opened the last
stage of the downfall and historical oblitera-
tion of Venice. It was a downfall in dis-
honor, in forced bondage; a pluckless, feeble-
minded downfall, much as Vienna’s was of
yesterday.
Schnitzler, the accredited recorder of
Viennese life as it was, the German Guy de
Maupassant, joins forces with Casanova in
his Casanovas Heimfahrt, a “novelle” pub-
lished last year in Berlin. The story .doesn’t
matter much; it is the usual Casanova
business. A successful lover gets his debt
of honor to Casanova written off for allow-
ing Casanova to take his place in Mar-
colina’s room. She discovers the fraud in
time, and a duel ensues, in which the suc-
cessful lover gets killed, as he deserves.
Casanova goes on home to Venice, and the
decidedly unpleasant stofy ends with his
warm welcome there. The book is in its
40th impression. And Casanova is the hero.
So the social debts and faiths, the parents
and grandparents, and all the simple things
will have to wait a while longer, even now.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
“The R.A.M.C. and the War”
In the first volume of this important work
Lieut.-Colonel Brereton narrates the doings
of the medical units during the first two
months of the Great War. And a stirring
history it is, full of good work accomplished
in the teeth of apparently insurmountable
difficulties. The R.A.M.C.. seemed to have
been, in foresight and acumen, ahead of the
military experts, since it had requisitioned
motor-ambulances from the very first day of
mobilisation. Parsimony, ignorance and
red-tape, however, prevented these indispens-
able vehicles being sent over, with the disas-
trous result that most of the wounded were
left behind at Maroilles, Landrecies, Le
Cateau and other places, and the service lost
invaluable men who were taken prisoners.
Motor-ambulances were not officially supplied
until September 20, when the Aisne fighting
was in progress; and by this time such was
the enthusiasm in Britain that owners of
cars tore off the expensive limousine or
other bodies, substituted ambulance bodies,
and hurried off to the Front in order to help
in the evacuation of the wounded.
When the Sixth Army had been sent off
north the medical units set themselves to
make alterations in the ambulance trains

HOW TO DISCARD AN UNSIGHTLY
COMPLEXION.
“Toilet Club Notes.”
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “If I
could only tear oiff this old skin!” And, do
you know, it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would be too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually—requiring about
ten days to complete the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth. Mar-
vellous ! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surely discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mercolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
WHY HAVE GREY HAIR
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless
recipe will correct it ?
, Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite, and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A STRANGE SHAMPOO.
“Cosy Corner Chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn
from this young woman with the beautiful
glossy hair that she never washes it with
soap or artificial shampoo powders. Instead
she makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspoonful of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only in
ilb. sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it.
Certainly this little lady’s hair did look
wonderful even if she ha,s strange ideas of a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself. *
BLACKHEADS INSTANTLY GO.
The new sparkling face bath treatment gives *
instant relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the skin.
You have only to drop a tablet of stymol,
obtained from' the chemist, into a glass or
hot water and bathe the face with the hquid
after the effervescence has subsided. Ihe
blackheads will then come right off on the
towel. The enlarged pores immediately con-
tract to normal and the greasiness disappears,
leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool and
free from blemish. But to make sure that
this desirable result is permanent, it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
IS POWDER NECESSARY? „
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically, No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at the same time both
elective and beneficial to the complexion.
Cleminite is a splendid substitute for face
powder, which is at the bottom of many
complexion Get about an ounce
from the chemist, and dissolve in four table-
spoonfuls of water. The result is a fine clear
liquid, which instantly gives the face, neck
or arms that peach-like bloom of perfect
health. There is nothing to equal it for
greasy skins, and the result lasts all day
long under the most trying conditions.

Beware of Imitations.
See that the name “Michelin”
is on every red tube you buy—
and remember it pays best
ALWAYS to fit Michelins.
It pays best because for service
Michelin Tubes completely out-
distance all others. Michelins alone
are SHAPED to their covers. They
alone FIT their covers, filling the space
WITHOUT STRAIN when inflated.
Thisfreedon from creasing and from all
other abnormal working conditions,
combined with
Michelin quality
materials, achieves
the usual result —
“Michelin First.”

Point Clare.
The cottage perched right up there on the
point,
Well up above the blue
Of lisping water and the reedy shore,
Sits easy. Though the times are out of joint
Life has a golden hue,
A piquant flavor exquisite and rare
That comforts you,
Here at Point Clare.
Rising quite early, first we bathe our souls
In the pellucid ecstasy of dawn.
The silver warms to pearl, the pearl controls
For long hushed minutes of reverent sus-
pense
The perfect scheme,
The dreamy world lost, dreaming of a dream,
While lingering Night sighs sweetly as it
Then, as new veils are drawn,
Comes wave on wave of rose
To herald Majesty, and each raptured sense
Cries out to greet the incomparable one,
The sun’s magnificence.
Day has begun.
After our souls, our bodies; that dear thrill
Of the first plunge! The water flung aloft
Into a thousand dewlets, and the soft
Pervasive glow that follows the swift chill
In startled flesh that finds itself restored
After night’s slackness still to praise the
Lord
Who made the sky and sea
For our felicity !
Heaven is a place afar where lithe girls swim
And splash at sunrise; with such ardent vim
As much enheartens the coy cherubim
And slips into each seraph’s golden throat
A hoarsened note,
The note of worship meet shot through with
fire
That fused in mortal blood would be desire.
Then, as the dewlets fly, I seem to think
That every glistening drop is blushing pink—
A thought to make the probing higher
thinker,
Although he thinks he thinks not, blush the
pinker.
Thus I, who am a pious soul, discern
The truth that G d is good,
That though phenomena be transitory
He shapes our ends to his completer glory...
The rest is understood.
So all things come to me.
The cottage snugly perched above the point.
However much the times are out of joint,
Is sanctuary.

Lost Gardens.
Who tends the gardens that have departed,
Whose flowers are dust and whose leaves are
wind?
Who tends the squares of the ghostly gardens
The world in its march has left behind,
Where the roots of the roses long have
passed,
With upstart daisies in lawns well-grassed?
There are tenements where the gardens blos-
somed,
There are narrow alleys with concrete paved ;
For here where the human weeds are thriv-
ing
Never a bud nor a bloom was saved,
And chimneys cluster towards the blue
Where once the shaft of a poplar grew.
Has the earth forgotten the births of
flowers ?
It bears high walls to the town to-day,
Till the Spring grows sick for the leaf pro-
cessions
That came with the changing year its way;
Has the earth grown blind through its many
covers
Of the dust of flowers and the graves of
lovers?
Who cares for gardens that have departed?
Who leans to weep o’er their cenotaph?
The wraith of a word of passion spoken,
The slender ghost of a broken laugh!
These come when the fine moon rays arc
bent
Like stairways over the tenement!

The Decadent City.
In my dreams do I behold
One old city dim and far;
Watch a silver crescent hold
In its lap the evening star;
See a slender minaret
Lifting from a dome and tower
’Neath which Mussulmen forget
Turmoil in the worship hour.
Ragged folk of gutt’ral speech
Surge along its dark bazaars,
Filthy children leer and screech
Harshly through the window bars.
Walls are crumbling, ruins grey
Smite the vision left and right;
Morning dawns on foul decay,
Death is visible at night.
All the splendor of its past
Buried lies in ddbris black;
From the winter’s fitful blast
Poverty is echoed back.
Brazen summer glares with scorn
On the filth of ages there.
Hearth and threshold are forlorn,
Dread disease is everywhere.
Wheels have marked its metal road.
Once its writhing alleys rang
Loud and long with men who strode.
Fought and conquered, laughed and sang.
Dead is all that lilting cheer
Brought by strangers from afar
To a city, hoar and drear,
Rotting in the wake of war.

HIS ESKIMO HONOR.
Judge Ewing, of Tasmania, just back from holding an inquiry at Darwin, says the North is “the place of lost souls.” He adds that it is the hottest spot on
earth, and that (though it is none of his business) he must include some remarks about the White Australia question in Ins report
HIS HONOR (home again, and interviewed by HOBART ICEBERG): “It’s a terrible, terrible place. There isn’t a snowball or a glacier in the whole
country, and I found my snow-shoes quite useless. When I asked for whale-oil at the best hotel the savages had never even heard of it.
They’re a brownish people up there, not blue with the cold like us, and I don’t like the look of them."

WANTED, A COTTON GOVERN-
MENT.
“Cotton growing and picking are pre-eminently
tropical pursuits. We have suitable country, but it is
not white man’s work.” —Sydney Telegraph
(2G/l/’2O).
It smelled like a familiar mephitic breath
from Home and Mother when the old Free-
trade paper published that. The text was
the report of the Empire Cotton-growing
Association, in which it was stated that the
price of cotton is now amazingly high, that
it is never likely to come down again to
anything remotely resembling the pre-war
level, and that the scarcity is great and
increasing. This sounded so promising that
the Telegraph sprang in promptly to voice
the old familiar lie that what the United
States do we can’t possibly accomplish under
.similar conditions. The Tory of the oldest
school, possibly believing the lie, demands im-
ported nigger labor. The Laborite, who
asserts that a White Australia is perfectly
feasible, devotes the best part of the country
—the 1,149,320 square miles of tropical and
largely cotton country—to the growing of
bullocks, strikes and loan railways that don’t
pay working expenses. The verdict passed
on the North, in which Labor acquiesces, is
that it isn’t fit for a white legislator to live
in, and, a legislator being only a man, this
signifies that it isn’t fit for a white man to
live in. So there are six State capitals and
one Federal capital in much less than half
the country—the section between the north-
ern suburbs of Brisbane and Tasmania. And
there isn’t one seat of Parliamentary Gov-
ernment in the district north of the outlying
fringe of Brisbane, which includes tropical
Australia (1,149,320 sq. miles), the belt
between the tropic line and Brisbane (about
800,000 miles more) and Papua (180,000
miles). The North is governed from cold-
weather capitals as if it wasn’t a white
man’s home, but a nigger dependency like
India. When information - is wanted about
it a cold-weather Government in Mel-
bourne —to be succeeded some day, it
is said, by a colder-w r eather Government at
Canberra —sends up a Judge selected from
among the pink, chubby, full-blooded folk
who live under the snow-peak of Mount
Wellington; sends him up to heap anathema
on it. Also an importing an anti-Australian
paper in Sydney, with wind blowing upon it
off the snow of the Blue Mountains in Jan-
uary, tells the world that the gigantic indus-
try which should be the standby of the North
is not fit for white men. If what such
authorities say, and what such authorities
are almost bound to say, is not refuted, then
Northern Australia is accepted as being no
white man’s land, and if it isn’t then the
black or brown or yellow man is coming.
The day of great, almost-unpeopled estates
that are held against settlement —and North-
ern Australia is a great estate —are nearly
over. Labor ought to know that, for it has
preached the gospel long enough and hard
enough.
* * * *
The cotton position is worth consideration.
Cotton-growing is a highly-paid white man’s
job in the United States, and, more than that,
it is a small farmer’s job. Because it pays
well there is a new tendency to push the
colored person right out of it; but as there
are over 10,000,000 of him and her this
can’t be done. People who are always 40
or 60 years behind the times and still believe
in Cobden and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” regard
Freetrade and the need for the nigger in
the cotton-field as two equally solid axioms.
Yet the work isn’t hard compared with the
kind of toil the white man does in Northern
Australia —wharf-laboring, tree-felling, min-
ing, bullock-punching and building loan roads
and railways and bridges. The latest report
is that one bale of pure cotton (5001 b.) can
be grown on an acre of land and that an
expert worker can take it off in 1J or 14
days. The crop delivered in England was
worth £l4 11s. per acre (7d. per lb.) in
1914. It is for the moment worth about £54,
having had a much bigger boom than wheat.
When foreign wheat records are quoted as
an encouragement to the Australian farmer
the result is always disappointing, for the
Australian wheat yield is under average. But
it must be remembered that wheat Australia
is also that part of Australia which is liable
to drought, whereas cotton Australia is rea-
sonably like other tropical countries for
assured rainfall. Notwithstanding all this,
though Australia sent samples of cotton to
England as far back as IS6I and it was pro-
nounced better than the American article,
under present conditions the industry seems
no more likely to start on a big scale than
a new religion does. The administrations
that we have know about as much of the
North as the equally well-meaning and stupid
Louis XYI. at Paris knew of Marseilles, at
the other end of his kingdom, where the
great disturbance was to come from. So the
Commonwealth in the gladness of its heart
and the greatness of its foresight offered
bounties not to exceed £2OOO a year and last-
ing only eight years (£16,000 in all) to start
the cotton industry, while the single State
of N. S. Wales gives over £1,000,000 a year
in railway rebates, by carrying goods below
cost, to encourage wheat growing, and is
now offering cheap loans up to £5OO each
on no very palpable security to help dis-
tressed wheat farmers. And this is done in
spite of the fact that for cotton there is a
big local demand with no local supply, so it
is an assured proposition, while the wheat
business is to a great extent a struggle to
produce a surplus for export to precarious
foreign markets.
»** * ■
Something must be grown in the North,
and grown in earnest, else the law against
holding a big estate practically unused will
surely lead to a trouble that will be the
end of White Australia. And what can pos-
sibly be so good as cotton? It is the easiest
thing to grow, and the world wants it badly
—wants it so badly that in the year before
the war even bleak Russia made an un-
natural effort and supplied the world with
2.000,000 bales of the article. Even the
Telegraph admits that the country is suit-
able ; and with the world hungry for cotton,
the land that is suitable for growing it will
probably have to grow it—or change owners.
The Labor Government at Brisbane appa-
rently understands nothing of all this; and
probably it can’t be expected to, for it lives
more than half-way down the map. If two
or three really Northern States were estab-
lished with Tropical or Cotton Governments
that lived in the country and understood it
things might improye. And this is Labor’s
special funeral, for it has talked more about
the white policy than any other parties, and
is sroing to suffer most if the policy col-
lapses.
SEMI-DIVORCED.
General French, after a brief and stormy
time as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, has
commenced his second great retreat, that
from Mons being the first. He reports that
Ireland should be given “the fullest mea-
sure of autonomy consistent with Imperial
supremacy.” Incidentally, he “recognises
that only two courses are possible, military
rule or self-government, and he has become
convinced of the futility of the former.”
Naturally he has, and the marvel is that
he has been so long about it. There are five
possible courses to be followed with a con-
quered white race. One is to assimilate
it after a friendly fashion, but there is
hardly a nation that has had any real suc-
cess that way. The Fre.nch have probably
had the best luck. Another is to keep nag-
ging at it indefinitely and lead the cat-and-
dog life. The third is to wipe it out, as
the Saxons did the Britons over most of
England, but for which strenuous feat there
might be Irelands dotted all over England
to this day, and London would be divided
into British and Saxon quarters, and there
might be Christian rows and THOR-and-
Woden riots in Bermondsey and .Battersea,
and, maybe, Druid 12th of July processions.
Afitey the unspeakable Turk had lost all his
Christian provinces save two because he was
no assimilator, Abdul Hamid came to the
throne with this third device in his narrow
brain, and decided to end the process of dis-
integration by wiping out the two remain-
ing Christian races of importance —the Bul-
garians and Armenians —and to clear his
Ireland out of the way. Being a Fez born
out of due season, he didn t realise that the
world had outgrown the simple old Saxon
methods. A fourth device is the one that
John French apparently proposes—to give
up everything except the bare name and
semblance of sovereignty. And the final
wav is by giving up both the fact and the
semblance —by shifting the statue of the
great god Terminus, who was originally a
god and not a railway station, and admit-
ting that the silly old game isn’t worth the
expensive old candle.

The Irish settlement enacted in 1914 but
never applied was a profoundly incapable
piece of work. In fact, it was asinine. It
provided that the British Parliament should
still control the Iris'h tariff, navy, army,
coinage, cables, wireless telegraphs, light-
houses —in fact, the big things. And as
Ireland’s representation in the Commons
was to be reduced from 103 to 42, the coun-
try’s new freedom was to consist in losing
almost the last semblance of control over its
own big things, (to the other hand, a local
legislature was to un the small things sub-
ject to control in London. The country was
to become a semi-divorced woman, par-
tially thrown out of the hoitse, still subject
to her husband’s conttol, but without the
status of a wife. It was to be a sort of per-
manent grass-widow, neither one thing nor
the other, and there would be nothing else
quite like it in this or any other empire.
Such a clumsy and unseemly jest only
roused Sinn Feinism to new fury. So
French proposes, apparently, that Ireland
shall have the autonomy that Australia en-
joys. This implies tocal control of army,
navy, coinage, tariffs —in fact, absolute
separation save for the fact that a vice-
regal figurehead will be sent from London
with instructions to reserve Acts dealing
with certain subjects, and not very many or
very important ones, for the “royal assent.”
An alleged “possession” held on the same
terms as Australia is of value to the head-
quarters of empire if the possession feels
friendly. It is then a source of strength.
If it doesn’t feel friendly it is of no value
at all. Australia has supplied troops to the
empire on three or four occasions. On the
last occasion it supplied a very large num-
ber. It has furnished ships. It gives Bri-
tain a preferential tariff, and it prefers to*
pay interest on British loans rather than
on United States loans, which is a material
benefit to the Old Man in London provided
there is no default. Also, it gives Britain
the first offer when it has a wild cat or a
Ivalgoorlie to sell. If it did none of these
things it would be a mere blob of color on
the map. It isn’t bound to help in the de-
fence of Britain; yet Britain, because the
image of the god Terminus hasn’t been re-
moved, is bound to defend it or else be
marked down as a nation that has lost caste,
a sinking concern which can no longer hold
what it calls its territory, and, therefore, an
object for the vultures to gather round and
put under close inspection. If autonomy
on the Australian plan can make the Irish
forget that they are a separate and origin-
ally a conquered race, all may be well. But
autonomy didn’t produce quite that effect
with Hungary, Serbia, Roumania or Norway,
and it isn’t quite certain that it has done
so ybt with the French Canadians or the
Boers. It has succeeded so far in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland, but then they had no
racial differences and nothing to forget. If
the experiment of the partly-divorced woman
fails Britain will have to defend Ireland
in case of need, and will get no defence in
return, nor will it get any profit. It won’t
even be quite sure that it hap got rid of the
Irish question in its own politics. The con-
duct of partly-divorced women is uncertain,
and permanent grass-widows are a doubtful
quantity.
AUSTRALIAN ROADS.
There is pathos in this naif Melbourne item :
Great interest is being taken in the suggestion
that the main road between Melbourne and Sydney,
which at present is for long stretches nothing bet-
ter than a bush track, should be reconstructed, so
that it would be possible for the Prince of Wales
when he visits Australia to make the journey be-
tween the two capitals by motor.
The motor-car interest always approaches
the Australian roads question in some such
oblique fashion. A method much in favor
with Yankee importers of cars, and also
sometimes with importers of Yankee cars,
is to condemn the nation’s taste. The idea
is that the state of a people’s roads is a
gauge of its cultural level: those who en-
dure bad roads are intellectually and spiritu-
ally of an inferior order. This disregards
the fact that when Praxiteles and Pindar
were at work the roads of Greece were dis-
graceful, while at a time when Rome, cul-
turally speaking, was to Carthage what
Wagga is to Edinburgh, the roads around
the Italian city were as vast and smooth as
they are to-day. The chief highways of Eng-
land —the great York-road, the Bath-road
and others —were certainly better between
the Roman occupation under Julius Agri-
cola and the arrival of the Jutlanders a
couple of centuries later than they were in
the golden age of the nation’s literature. A
Milton would live uncomplainingly on the
notorious Parramatta-road which leads out
of Sydney to the west, provided he did not
own a vehicle of any sort; whereas an illiter-
ate bicycle-enthusiast, or the proprietor of
a garage, might join the local Progress Asso-
ciation and work hard to improve matters.
Good roads have never materialised through
the raising of such side-issues as the com-
fort or edification of a globe-trotting Prince,
or as the outcome of embittered scoffs levelled
by interested parties.
# * * *
The real trouble with Australia is that it has
no very insistent impelling force to keep driv-
ing it in the direction of decent roads. The
claim that usable roads ought to be built
on military grounds enthuses very few, this
country not being invadable in the sense that
France or Germany is. There is no Austra-
lian-built motor-car yet, which is another
way of saying that there is ‘no' chflap car,
and, therefore, no car used in vast numbets.
The owners of the costly imported cars com-
plain and protest, but they are few and their
motives are suspect. And yet, if it cottld
only be brought home to them, there are
solid material reasons why all classes of
Australians should begin to invest in better
roads, if not in the best roads. In sup-
porting a consumer’s scheme for the estab-
lishment of suburban provision-markets in
Sydney, Captain Carmichael, M.L.A.. the
other day referred to Ilford, in England! and
someone else mentioned the street markets
of France. Now Ilford is served by the
great thoroughfare which, beginning as the
Mile End Road, bisects Essex and taps farms
and market-gardens as far as Chelmsford.
It is as flat as a bowling green and as
smooth. And similarly the poultry farmers
and fruit- and vegetable-dealers who supply
the different Paris markets arrive by roads
which are normally without reproach. There
are thousands of Australians who can pic-
ture what the Amiens-Bapaume-road was be-
fore the war, and it was typical of the French
provinces. To get goods in bulk to a Mel-
bourne or Sydney suburban market by road
would cost a fortune in horseflesh and in
wear and tear of vehicles; and the roads
serving the up-country towns; if no worse,
are at least as bad. No country needs
mechanical road-traction, which was one of
the chief developments of the late war, more
than Australia, suarsely settled and with no
canals and few rivers. It means lessening
that outrageous cost of transport which is
one of the biggest factors in the high cost
of living. But it cannot arrive to any serious
purpose with the roads of the Common-
wealth in their present state.
* * * *
The tragedy is that even if the majority
of Australians were satisfied as to the
urgency of this matter (which at present
they are not, many regarding it purely as
a joy-riding motorists’ problem), it would be
next door to impossible to get any large
measure of reform. Over a great part of
Australia we handle either all or most of our
roads on the system that England employed
two centuries ago. Under the I,7th and 18th
century laws the care and construction of the
nat! m’s roads were vested in the parishes.
They were often jealous, as our shires are;
and, anyhow, they saw no reason why the
parish money should be spent to providing
passing strangers with comfortable transport.
The great Roman roads fell into disrepair;
and many of the arteries became quagmires.
When John, hjlacadam got to work things
were so bad that it was not possible for
him to build: he could only repair. But
England with its centralised form of gov-
ernment was always in the position to act
when it saw the light. Control was more
and more removed from the local authorities;
and ten years ago Parliament, in recogni-
tion of the new conditions created by the
spread of motoring, established a Road
Board and gave it control throughout the
Kingdom. The Board was empowered to
finance approved new roads and pay for
improvements to existing ones; to ensure
that all roads were safe for traffic, and as
dustless as possible, and so on. The Aus-
tralian Parliament is powerless to do any-
thing of the sort. It cannot even interfere
with roads between capital and capital. It
is oddly unreasonable, seeing that inter-
state traffic is fluid as inter-State trade in
respect of which the Commonwealth has
authority. Yet so it is. And as for the
State Parliaments, they move in this matter
with the utmost trepidation. Practically all
of them have some body or other with a pre-
tence of authority; but except in Victoria
the State legislator has been in too much
dread of the small municipal 'potentates to
rob them of any substantial part of their
power and patronage. Even in Victoria
interference with the “local authority” has
been undertaken in a spirit of apology.
Under our present form of government it
seems almost hopeless to expect any
thorough improvement. Unification with re-
construction—and nobody seriously asks for
one without the other—holds out the best
hope. It may be that the present States
are too large to allow of central road-con-
trol being effective: and certainly the popula-
tion of congested Sydney, for example, re-
fuses to be interested in a North Coast road.
We shall have better things when the con-
tinent is subdivided into perhaps 20 States,
with a healthy rivalry between them. Mean-
time those who are going to lament that they
cannot motor the Prince over the track be-
tween Sydney and Melbourne may charge
their grief up to State Frights, which are
the chief obstacle in the path of unification
and reconstruction.
A NEWER NEW ORLEANS.
Seen from the sea Cairns is a town of
white and green; seen from the great range
climbed by the railway 3000 ft. to Kuranda,
it is a handful of white dice thrown on a
green cloth. There is no finer vision than
this on earth: the great panorama from be-
low Kuranda of gorge, canefields, sage-green
mountain striped with the white trunks of
the kauri; foothill and sea, waterfall and
scarp; until, with flanges grinding on the
quick and many curves, the railroad descends
to the orange and banana groves of Bedlynch
Nearly 22 years ago I first saw it in all
its beauty ; and through the changes and g-.od
and ill of that time it stays unforgetablj.
For three months of the wet season the
town, but a few feet above the sea steams
in its own sweat; 20 miles away, and but
an hour of rail-roading, is the tableland of
clear, hot days and cool nights • gi eat areas
of jungle, and forest of maple and pine and
crow-foot elm and silky oak; of dairy lands
and maize fields; the tin and copper of Her-
berton and Irvinebank, and so to beyond
Girofla, the bismuth and wolfram and molyb-
denite of Carbine and Wolfram camp and
Bamford and Koorboora ; the coal of Mulli-
gan ; silver, lead and gold in a dozen camps
from the Hodgkinson to the Percy. On this
tableland of Atherton and beyond it there
is room for all the population of the State,
a great and wealthy region mined for all
the metals, and stuffed with sugar, beef, fruit
and corn to feed all Australia. There is
water power to be harnessed; a climate nor
to be bettered on earth; and, more than in
any other part of our country, not enoug
men to go round. And where are the men•
I had to wait five days at Cairns for a
China liner, and found time to answer
own question. . • ~*
There is a bath enclosure m the lniei
approached from the shore over a or
gangway that the most intrepid passeng


treads circumspectly. I know of no better
place to think in than the bath, mental con-
centration being at its best in loneliness and
silence. The hot bath for closely critical
thought; the cold for quick decision, even if
it be only a decision to leave. But the sea
to think big things in: open sea, open sky;
light airs and caressing sun upon tne naked
body; inspiration from the primal elements
—an inspiration too wide for small circum-
stance. So, floating in that peculiarly grey-
blue water, the divinely soft air quickened
the vision to the future of this land —a
future that can be repeated in a dozen lands
of Australia if but the three devils of Cen-
tralisation, Freetrade and Imperialism be
cast out.
There are 700,000 people in all Queens-
land, and twice 700,000 the Cairns region
could maintain ; and there are 800,000 people
or more in Sydney, and on the population
of all Australia that is half a million too
many for one city. Thousands of those
Sydney people engaged in shops selling goods
from oversea to thousands of other people
who are trundling foreign goods over
wharves, and carting foreign goods to im-
porters’ warehouses, and loading ships with
much Australian raw material—they should
be in factories nearer to the raw material’s
place of origin, and by their work opening
other ports north and south. Rid ourselves
of a centralisation that spells waste in
transport; rid ourselves of the Freetrade that
gave Germany the money to fight us with
and now enriches Japan; rid ourselves of the
Imperialism that preached against a citizen
soldiery and a citizen navy for Australia
and still preaches against high Protection
and in favor of the profiteer. That done,
difficulties will largely solve themselves —
with certain reservations.
Australia cannot be certainly protected
against all foes without increased popula-
tion, the native and the introduced. Being,
as it is, the best land on earth, it must have
the best people; and these are not to be
selected by the old slipshod selection of
assisted immigration. “Agricultural immi-
grants” have been sent from England and
found to be peddlers. There are hundreds
and thousands of English and Europeans
who are not good enough to be admitted to
Australian citizenship; and as the cost of
transport of the wornout cabhorse for the
Zoo and of a blood horse are the same, why
carry food for the lions? But we started off
with the English superstition of Freetrade
in place of a sane fiscal policy, and the Eng-
lish superstition aimed at driving out the
decent Britisher with cheap foreign-made
goods and then filling the decent Britisher’s
place with the cheap foreigner himself. The
cold-blooded batteners on British industry
had to have a slogan to cover the crime, and
the Freetrade slogan was “Under the British
flag there is freedom.” So there was; but
it was a freedom mostly consisting of
liberty to starve. Now that the old order
departs, no matter how tardily, that old
slogan is stilled for most of the British, who
have found it out; and for Australia the
echo of it is stilled also.
I would have as directors of the Austra-
lian Immigration Commission not commercial
men, who are for all other purposes than
commerce the dullest of intelligences; not
time-servers, who would hurry to show re-
sults of mere numbers; but men who firstly
know Australia and its necessities and abili-
ties, and who would accept the long-distance
job of building the high-grade nation with
full recognition that their work is not to
be judged by this generation. The commis-
sion should have the best of medical advice
to fix high physical standards of immigrants;
and it should have the counsel of good artists
in the making of a mental standard and a
standard of comeliness. It should have no
care for any special nationality of the white
races. The statement of the facts of Aus-
tralian conditions is good enough to charm
birdseed out of a cuckoo clock; but these
things have not only to be told but to be
shouted, because most people are mentally
deaf. Australia should be given perma-
nently the publicity that belongs temporarily
to a circus or a murder. The commission
controlling its immigration should go through
Europe with a search-warrant for youth and
beauty and comb the old-world lands of all
the strength and brains that are courageous
enough to take a chance.
The artist’s voice would have to be heard
in that commission, because of all people the
artist has least the small insular prejudice
against other races. It was, and to some
extent still is, the English fashion to speak
of the French and Italians as decadent.
That fashion, and the related old hatred
of the French, because of Napoleon, had
much to do with the fattening of the Prus-
sian purse and the Prussian vanity for the
crime of 1914. But the French and the
Italians, except in trade, have been the
superior of the English; and trade superi-
ority happened mostly because of great coal
and iron deposits in Britain, whereas Italy
has never found or mined a ton of coal in
all its history. The Italians are industrious,
cheerful, kindly, and come of the sunlight.
A great Italian artist can be happy on the
wages of a workman so long as his work is
his art; Italy is one of the few countries
whose sculptors, writers and painters have
not flagrantly commercialised themselves.
There literary reputation rests on achieve-
ment ; in England on advertisement, so that
Marie Corelli is better known than
Maurice Hewlett. As for the Frenchman,
Australia, wants him if it be but to teach
the Australian to love Australia as the
Frenchman loves France —not as a shop to
sell goods in, but as the mother that gave
him life and as the gracious breast that nour-
ished him.
This, broadly then, for the Australian Im-
migration Commission —to comb the white
races for their best. And for the best immi-
grant of all, the native born, a better deal.
One of these days the blue riband of all
Ministerial portfolios will be the Ministry
for Children. It will not aim at the Biblical
idea of population—mere quantity of any
sort —but it will better the quality by giving
the new Australian’s mother the best of
treatment before his birth ; by making every
birth welcome, and by making the Austra-
lian birth-rate the most effective on earth.
Then I may be within sight of the realisa-
tion of this day-dream in the sea —of twice
the present population of Queensland hapnv
in this northern region of meat and maize
and sugar and fruit, bringing sunlight to
the acres now dark under forest and jungle,
md building this port of green palms and
-white houses into a new New Orleans.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Polar Bears in the Tropics.
The Federal authorities made an experi-
ment when they sent an Eskimo judge from
Tasmania to hold inquiry at Port Darwin.
He wasn’t greatly impressed with the fer-
tility of the country or the scrap he saw of
it, coming as he did from a small island
where the average wheat crop is about twice
that of the mainland and oats go 28i bushels
to the acre. But the heat was the outstand-
ing feature, and it naturally surprised a
man who struck the place in midsummer
fresh from latitude 43° :—-
“Hot! There was nothing on earth that could
equal it....
“I have sweltered in Darwin during the last five or
six weeks more than I ever have during the rest of
my life. It was not so much the temperature as the
humidity of it”....
In his report to the Government he would have to
make some reference to the White Australia policy.
The lot of a married woman in Darwin was dreadful.
She had to do her own cooking over a stove in a
heat that could not be imagined.
Of course the luckless man, snatched from
the blubber-pots of Hobart, struck Darwin
in the rainy season. Every tropical country
that is blessed with rain has a distinct rainy
season, and it is always the summer, Dar-
win’s dampest month being January. And
the place has the misfortune to be the most
low-lying of Australia’s capitals as well as
being the furthest north and on the tip of
a very narrow wet strip. It is 97ft. above
sea-level, while even Melbourne is 115 ft. and
Perth 197 ft. The Territory should be opened
from the south, and when the railway is
finished it might possibly have an inland
capital or at least an inland summer capital.
In any case, lest Mr. Ewing should really
propose to quit the subject he was appointed
to inquire into and talk of White Aus-
tralia in the tropics, it is as well to get in
early with the counsel that', as an Eskimo
or whale-fishing judge, imported suddenly
from a small glacial island, and sizing up
the eleven hundred thousand and fifty square
miles of Tropical Australia by a brief resi-
dence in one of its corners in the hottest
and wettest season, he isn’t fitted to pass
an opinion. lie is no more fitted than a
newly-arrived Egyptian judge would be to
pronounce on Tasmania’s blackberry crop,
and a wise Egyptian wouldn’t try to do it.
The Foreign Profiteer Shows His Teeth.
The great Shipping Combine has set to work
to put what is called in the best circles the
kybosh on the Commonwealth shipping line.
The Combine is a mighty affair spreading-
over all the seas. Even the P. and O. group,
with 554,013 tons of shipping, is only an
item of it. The Combine’s method, now put
in force against the Commonwealth ships
for the first time, is simple. It charges very
high freights, but every half-year it gives a
big portion back, provided that during the
half-year the shipper hasn’t sent a single
ounce of freight by any non-Combine ship if
there were Combine ships on the route.
Otherwise the rebate is forfeited, and any
firm whose trade is mostly shipping would
be knocked out of existence by a continuance
of the forfeiting process. Having put this
rule in force against Australia, the Common-
wealth vessels are leaving London empty,
which means that half their earnings dis-
appear’, and unless this country puts up a
vigorous kick its great venture will dissolve
i% smoke. The only people to patronise the
Commonwealth line will be the class who
trade exclusively with Australia and so have
nothing to lose elsewhere, and only the
portion of that infinitesimal class which
trades so little that it can afford to wait for
the Commonwealth ships, a very feeble flock
as yet compared with the fleets of Private
Enterprise. It isn’t a question that can be met
by cutting rates. With many shippers even
free carriage by the Commonwealth vessels
wouldn’t make up for the confiscation of
their rebates by the Combine. The Combine
is so dead-sure of the strength of its con-
spiracy or whatever it may be called —no-
body cares much what it is called —and so
confident that it owns us body and soul, that
it has put up its freights to Australia from
£5 ss. to £7 10s. per ton. British Govern-
ment control in war-time prevented anything
absolutely uproarious in the way of freight
increases, but soon they are likely to be up-
roarious enough. They are already disas-
trous, especially so far as Australia is con-
cerned —a country which provides hardly
anything for itself except wheat, meat and
perishable eatables, yet demands the best
and lots of it even if the cost is paid for out
of loans: the Anomaly Land which sticks to
the dull, laborious agricultural work of the
coolie and expects to live like the highly-
skilled artisan who is almost an artist. A
haughty yet helplessly dependent people like
the Australians must pay whatever is asked.
Yet the trouble is one of the kind that
the Labor party carefully avoids taking up.
It is the policy of that party to disseminate
the lie that our profiteers are here, in the
little workshops and little stores and little
coastal shipping companies and little sheep-
flocks, and it urges the people to rise and
seize these petty enterprises and put them
under the charge of the little inflated
Trotskys of the One Big Union. To point
out that the real profiteers are far away,
only to be attacked by large measures of
constructive statesmanship of which the little
Trotskys are quite incapable, would ruin
the little Trotskys’ position. There are
some obvious courses that strong men might
take :—• *
(1) To inform the British Government that the
proceedings of the -Combine are regarded, in the
eloquent United States language of the Monhoe
Doctrine, as an unfriendly act, and ask it to inter-
fere. It probably wouldn’t, for such a thing would
be equal to sitting on a nest of hornets, and .even
if it did interfere the high freights would remain.
(2) Failing assistaince from the British Govern-
ment, to abolish the preferential tariff and thus
get some satisfaction and some money and show
that we have a powerful argument. Either way the
rich men of the Combine, whose interests include
banks and all sorts of things, would probably reply
by blocking all new loans, which would be'the best
thing that could happen. Possibly they would also
block renewal loans or put up the interest to
12J per cent. Then Australia could only reply that
it couldn’t pay and that the loan was compulsorily
extended at the current rate of interest.
(3 —and most important of all): To decide to
cut down the curse of foreign trade by two-thirds
or three-quarters, so that the small balance coull
be easily handled. To this end it would be necessary
to postpone till the Friday after the next blue full
moon, and later unless the blue full moon happened
on the sth Friday in the month, all the public
works that can possibly be postponed. Also to
encourage immigration. And then to concentrate
all our labor power on the growing of our own
linen and cotton and miscellaneous foodstuffs and on
the making of our own clothes, machinery, tools,
ships, victuals, drink, and, in fact, our own dashed
everything. Of course the great foreign profiteering
interests would hire every available Labor “leader”
and “extremist” and Bolshevik to foment strikes and
revolutions, but even they could be dealt with.
Australia is just about to begin to realise
the awful servitude of a country that de-
pends for almost everything on the foreign
manufacturer, shipowner, trust, combine and
money-lender—the place that is every
foreign profiteer’s slave and also his yellow
dog. As a single instance, the increase in
freights which the Combine has put on so
gaily means that the farmer who has wheat
for export will get Is. 3d. less per bushej.
That is one reason why he wants a manu-
facturing population created here by high
Protection or otherwise, so that he won’t
have to pay 4s. per bushel or even 2s. 9d.
for having his wheat carried to a distant con-
sumer by any Combine.
Something Worse than Profiteering.
One recent message said that Bradford
(England) “has become a town of million-
aires, and many one-time workmen are
worth hundreds of thousands... . Yarn sold
in 1914 at 3s. Id. per lb. was quoted last
week at 17s. tid.” Another was to the effect
that the Egyptian peasant cotton-grower,
who used to be one of the poorest creatures
on earth, has boomed so much through war
prices that people living in mud huts are
worth £20,000 or more. The man in Brad-
ford took hold and manufactured woollen
goods like the Devil to meet the big demand,
so, tnough he was hampered by the lack of
local raw material, he made money. Aus-
tralia plodded away with strikes, short-hour
movements and railway-building and land-
settlement dodges, so despite its abundance
of raw material it is paying 17s. Od. for
imported yarn and making millionaires at
Bradford. As for the Egyptian, he had the
thing which is indispensable to the exporter
of raw material —lie commanded the ships
to take his raw material to the market while
it was 1 offering fabulous war prices, and,
therefore, he didn’t miss the ’bus. The Aus-
tralian, being consumed with the importing
disease, didn’t own the ships or have com-
mand of them, so his wheat and wool had >o
be sold here at any old price to anybody
who could afford to stand out. of his money.
As a result the Australian in a hut isn’t
worth £20,000. Rather, he is short of a
hut. What this missing of the ’bus meant is
partly shown by Federal Statistician
Ivnibbs’s latest volume. In 1915 Australia
put a tax of 50 per cent, for the first year
and 75 per cent, afterwards on all profits
made during war-time in excess of those
made before, and by June. 1913 (three years
later)', the result was £1,116,080. It should
have been, as compared on a population
basis with the results obtained in the United
Kingdom, about £30,000,000 j in one year.
But then there were no big industries here
to profiteer on, so the taxable profiteer
couldn’t be found. The man who made the
money to tax was in Bradford and such-
like places.
Protection and the Population Question.
The Calcutta Statesman, which, like the
rest of the big Indian “official” journals, is
of the Cobdenite persuasion, propounded a
novel theory the other day. Talking of trade
it remarked that “Australia has already
created a protectionist tariff, and the con-
sequence of her high protective policy is a
complete cessation in the growth of her
population.” Protection has been accused of
a lot of things in its time, but never before
of interfering with the birth-rate or dis-
couraging immigration. The U.S.A. were in
a 'bad way at the end of the Civil War.
Immigration had almost ceased, manufac-
tures were lanquishing and the Government
was loaded with debt. A beginning was
made with that system of tariff legislation
which has existed with a brief respite or
two ever since. By 1885 the country was
so prosperous and the population had in-
creased so much that the local heirs to the
Freetrade superstition were able to get an
agitation going in favor of once more risk-
ing the old policy. Nine years later a serni-
Freetrade tariff became law. It lasted three
years, at the end of which time the McKin-
ley Tariff (the highest the States had
known) was imposed by a Parliament
alarmed at the results of the previous ex-
periment, and the Dingley Act raised the
schedule still further. At the end of the
Civil War and Freetrade the population was
just on 27,000,000; when the last census was
taken it was just on 82,000,000. It is to-
day probably about 100,000,000. In 1860
the population of Freetrade United Kingdom
was roughly 2,000,000 more than that of
the then Freetrade United States. At the
last (1911) census there were 37,000.000
less people in the Freetrade country than
there were in the one which, except for a
three-year break, had been highly Protec-
tionist for half a century. What are the
factors which have helped to keep Australia
sparsely populated? In the first place, in-
adequate Protection. The politicians have
usually been willing to wound the importer,
and yet afraid to strike with any vigor.
Immediately after a war which was fought
by the Central Powers on the proceeds of
Protection—in the sense that without Pro-
tection they could never have become suf-
ficiently wealthy or populous to undertake it
—-a N. S. Wales soldier-Senator proclaimed
himself a Freetrader: a fair example of the
difficulties Australian Protectionists have
always encountered in the effort to get their
policy made effective. A second main cause
of the population-shortage is the fact that,
unlike the U.S.A., this country has always
been fairly exclusive in the matter of its
immigrants —not so exclusive as it should
have been, but more exclusive than most.
And, finally, it is further from the world’s
main emigration-centres than any other
country. But neither the expense involved
in getting here, nor the fact that only a
picked type of immigrant is wanted, will
permanently stop Australia from booming in
respect of its population, provided it is not
permanently denied the thing which the
Statesman imagines is keeping it empty.
How the Cities Live.
The housewives of Melbourne and Sydney
who have started a movement to secure
suburban market-places are on the right
line. Every few days some paper or
other prints a letter to the effect that on
the very morning the writer paid fourpence
for a cucumber a market-gardening friend
sent 3cwt. of them to town and got only 3d.
a dozen. The fact is that if the grower got
nothing at all the vegetable couldn’t be
carted hither and thither and handled and
re-handled and sold for much less. In the
first place Australia has the congestion dis-
ease worse than any other country in the
world. Knibbs estimated that on December
31, 1918, no less than 50.57 p.c. of the en-
tire population of Victoria lived in one
bloated city; and in S. Australia the position
is still more alarming—s2.B9 p.c. of the
population of the vast State inhabited Ade-
laide. If these were great manufacturing
centres, shipping their wares to foreign
places, the condition would not be so dread-
ful. Yet even in great manufacturing coun-
tries the figures of congestion are not so
startling. London has only 12.22 p.c. of the
population of England; Brussels but 8.77
p.c. of the population of little Belgium;
Paris but 7.29 p.c. of the people of France;
Berne but 2.50 p.c. of the Swiss who remain
at home. For every one Spaniard who in-
habits his capital of Madrid 14 of the popula-
tion of N. S. Wales are crowded into
Sydney, basing the comparison on the
population of the two countries; for every
one Italian in Rome there are no less
than 20 Australians in one or other
of their six capitals. With this con-
gestion how is it possible to avoid grossly
unnecessary handling of foodstuffs in par-
ticular, along with prodigious for
which, of course, somebody has to pay? On
top of that come rents; for the ground rents
paid by a population of a million gathered
in one city are probably 10 times greater
than the aggregate paid by the same number
of people divided into 10 cities. In the small
town the housewife finds it not impossible
to do her own marketing. In a bloated city,
unless suburban markets are established, it
is well-nigh’ impossible: the tradesman has
to be relied upon to bring almost everything
to the door, and that piles up the cost enor-
mously. Possibly also we have got into the
habit of relying more upon the carrier than
any other people in the world. The city-
dwelling Australian carries home his own
beer, and very little else. The establishment
of suburban market-places, where the house
wife can deal more or less directly with the
producer—in some few lines, at any rate —
is certainly calculated to do something tc
reduce the high cost of living, by cutting
out entirely superfluous middlemen. To that
extent, then, the movement is good. But it
does not get to the root of the trouble. That
trouble is the appalling congestion of popula-
tion —how appalling we can hardly realise
until we compare our own state with that
of other countries; and all the more serious
because our congestion accrues not so much
from manufactures as from the superfluous
handling and re-handling of the necessaries
of life.
«.
The Case for the Turk.
“D.’s” rejoinder:—•
“Henry Horsecollar” lodges several objections (B.
29/1,/’2O) against my arguments and conclusions in
“The Case for the Turk” (B. 22/l/’2O). For example:
“There are supposed to be 220,000,000 Mohammedans
in the world (not 300,000,000) and 67,000,000
Mohammedans in India (not 72,000,000).” The last
Indian census, which was taken in 1911, gave the
figures that “Henry Horsecollar” quotes: or, to be
exact, 66,623,000. There were 62,500,000 Moham-
medans when the previous count was made in 1901.
As Islam has not yet adopted Malthusianism, there
should be about 72 millions now that another census
is nearly due. And similarly with the Moslem world-
figures.
“A whole lot of Mohammedans,” says “Horse-
collar,” “scoff at the professed Caliph hiding at
Constantinople. The Persians, for instance, have little
use for him.” This is like trying to prove that
the Vatican is on the wane by demonstrating that
the Russians have no use for it. The Persians (Shi-
ites), who regard the descendants of Ali as the only
legitimate Caliphs, have not been orthodox Moslems
since 657 a.d.
And again: “The whole case for the Turk in Europe
is based on the assumption that it is his country in
the same sense that Spain and Germany belong to
their inhabitants. It might have become his country
if he had developed the slightest capacity for assimila-
ting the old population, but he didn’t. As he re-
mained a stranger he has to leave like one, having
outstayed his welcome.” How many appropriators of
foreign countries have managed to assimilate the old
population? Australia certainly hasn’t. Neither has
the U.S.A. or South Africa, or Canada.
But all these are side-issues. “H.H.” himself pro-
vides a very good reason why the, Turk should be left
alone. “Patchwork countries or agglomerations,” he
says, “held together by force, just dismember them-
selves on occasion.... About 97 & per cent, of the old
Ottoman dominions in Europe have been dismembered
already, largely by the indignant inhabitants them-
selves.” This is true. All great empires have been
patchwork creations; all have been held together
more or less by force (force is being used in several
parts of our own empire at this moment) ; and all
must come to an end. Surely the very fact that
the Ottoman Empire is evidently expiring by natural
process provides a strong argument against pushing
it over the edge, and so outraging Moslem feeling
all over the world. The Sultan’s claim to be the
spiritual Caliph of Islam may, of course, be absurd.
And many of the Mussulman peoples may think so,
just as many Latins deny the Pope of Rome. But
that has nothing to do with the case, in view of
the undeniable fact that the vast majority think
otherwise. As “Henry Horsecollar” remarks, “it
isn’t difficult to raise a religious shindy any day in
India.” There was a sufficiently serious one, in
which Moslem as well as Hindu fanatics participated,
after a great European war 63 years ago. The
British Empire has not so much blood and money
to spare these days that it should gratuitously risk
another.

to the throne and person of his most gracious majesty
King George V., and expresses its determination to
resist by all lawful means any attempt to subvert
the great principles of civil and religious liberty
which triumphed in the glorious revolution of 1688.
This constant reference to the founding of
civil and religious liberty by the Dutch
William revolution does more to keep sec-
tarian bitterness alive than even the memory
of the fact that three of the four Irish pro-
vinces were confiscated bodily in Cromwell’s
time and the old proprietors turned
into peasants, with English landlords over
them. There was civil and religious liberty
under Charles 11. and James 11., but the
revolution of 1688 ended it for 141 years.
Every Roman Catholic was disqualified as a
voter and a member of Parliament, and in
Ireland at least as a landholder, and in other
ways innumerable. It wasn’t till 1829 that
even an English Roman Catholic peer was
allowed to re-enter the House of Lords, much
as England reverenced its peerage, and
despite the fact that there wasn’t the slight-
est sign of any danger from, or any dis-
affection in, the little handful of R.C. popu-
lation in England. Dutch William was a
Calvinist, and the Calvinists have two
articles of faith—that almost everybody is
going to Hell and that he will find Hell a
great deal worse than he expects when he
gets there. He and his followers set up a
new definition of “civil and religious liberty”
to match their idea of the deity, and once
a year or oftener dull dogs of his following
announce that it is still their definition, and
that it is the sort of thing they would apply
if they had the chance. Most of them
wouldn’t, and they know it; yet they say it
in order to keep the sectarian shindy alive.
This isn’t Ireland, nor is it England, and
Dutch William was never King of Aus-
tralia, and it isn’t our shindy; and it is
degrading our national holiday to use it for
the purpose to which it was put last week.
Holman Drunk and Holman Sober.
Resignations from the N.S.W. National
party keep dropping in on Premier Holman,
who receives them with polite regret, as any
general might who saw his regiments leaving
him. The malcontents unanimously ascribe
their retirement to dissatisfaction with
llolman’S management, which is feasible
enough. Nobody quits a leader because of
satisfaction. But the retiring men are very
unsatisfactory themselves. Not one of them
says that he is quitting as a protest against
Holman’s insane loan policy—especially his
£13,000,000 loan policy of this year, which
is the final madness —so there isn’t the
slightest reason to believe that any of them
would be one iota better than the leader he
repudiates. Not one of them -points out
that a loan policy which, by reason of high
costs and poor returns, makes it necessary
to increase taxation threefold br more in
eight years, can have but the one result —
the country must eventually go broke under
the strain. Nor does any one of them pro-
fess to be a shade better than Holman on
the question of real decentralisation —the
cutting up of N. S. Wales into manageable
States, each with its own port and metro-
polis. That is the second big question,
though for the moment it comes a long way
behind the loan matter. There is no other
about which it is worth anybody’s
while to leave Holman and join such very
ordinary creatures as are available in his
stead. For there are possibilities about Hol-
man if his drink supply was cut off —he con-
sumes the IOU brand, 5| per cent over-
proof and in shocking ciuantities. It may be
that there are more possibilities about him
if he was sober than about any of his visible
rivals supposing they were sober. Holman
with his drink cut off would have to find
new expedients, and he has a genius for find-
ing expedients. Probably if he could rouse
some real courage and declare for the prohi-
bition of new loans by law he would even
at the tail of the eleventh hour restore his
faded fortunes. If he carried his point it
would be the end of Storey and nearly the
end of his party, for though Holman drunk
and Storey drunk are not widely different,
Holman sober would probably be as far
ahead of Storey sober as an arc lamp is
ahead of a Japanese match. At the worst
he could fail and go down in a blaze of
glory, execration, applause and curses after
giving his enemies the shock of ages, in-
stead of going down in a flicker of mud,
and he seems like going down in any case.
He could fall like Troy or Babylon instead of
falling like a bark hut. He could have his name
in every paper in the empire, including even
the Philatelic Gazette and the Austra-
lian Soda Fountain Journal, as the first
Premier who made it his. policy to declare
further borrowing illegal. There is no need
for any showy repentance, either. It
is only necessary to say that the policy of
developing the country with loans has
reached a natural finish, just as the policy
of developing an army or navy finishes wnen
the force is big enough. It could be said that
circumstances have changed, which they cer-
tainly have, or that the State has become
rich enough to depend on itself—-that it is
grown up. in fact. A new man could intro-
duce an anti-loan policy with the bald state-
ment that all the borrowers, Holman in-
cluded, were profligate lunatics; but the old
man, if he is reasonably adroit, can get out
of the difficulty without describing himself
that way.
Are the Heavens All Cloud?
“Good Australian” : I attended the Founda-
tion Day lunch of the A.N.A. in Melbourne
and got my pouch full of platitudes spiced
with hypocrisy. Why can’t public speakers
talk sometimes about cheerful things? Why
can’t they tell about the good iueas, the
agreeable questions, the amusing events of
the day or the times, instead of perpetually
grouching about the dreadful problems ahead
and the bad things that will happen if we
don’t alter? There was not a joke, a laugh,
a witty allusion, a sentence of fancy or phan-
tasy uttered all the dreary afternoon. Do
they take it from the daily papers, which
delight in reporting measles, ’flu, divorce
cases, abortions and infanticides to the ex-
clusion of everything humorous? Every
speech this day was despondent, and the hori-
zon of Australia’s future was pushed back
to the tenth pit of Hell, the very lowest,
where Judas and Lucifer are imprisoned.
“Australia must arm, or some hungry people
will, come along and take tie country from
us,” 'was the wail even of Birdwood, “the
Soul of Anzac.” If the Pacific is to be the
next battleground of the nations, and if
Australia will have to bear the brunt of an
ecumenical invasion by all the land-hungry
nations, what is the value of being an integ-
ral part of the British Empire? What will
the British Navy be doing? Will all our
Allies stand by and allow this continent to
be snatched from us (even if the thing were
feasible) by., any nation whatsoever, be it
yellow, brown or
white ? Every
speaker spoke as
though this Com-
monwealth was
weak, unprotected
and friendless,
marooned at the
globe’s end, open
to occupation by
THE OUTLOOK.
“U.S.A. has gone dry. Maoriland is going dry. Australia is on the way to going dry. Whisky
in Europe is hard to get.”
“Now (hie), I wonder wheresh a pub !”
any bucaneering race, and absolutely without
friends or allies amongst the peoples of the
earth! And not one of them and nobody
else ever says to us, “Men, women and
children of Australia, directly the first shot
is fired by an enemy at you, every Briton
in the Empire will take up arms and rush
to your aid!” Yet if that isn’t so, the Bri-
tish connection is a delusion and a snare, and
in pure self-defence we are bound to find
another. That is the situation which these
apostles of gloom force upon us.
“Expert Too” : It is possible that our tele-
graph rales will be reconsidered before
long, because they are too low; but it does
not follow that the zone system so often
referred to would be a desirable change.
There is a far better method, and one which
anolies particularly to Australian condi-
tions. Many N. S. Wales lines running
into Western and Central Districts don’t
carry much traffic, but they are costly to
build and maintain. The people employing
them usually have a poor or tardy postal
service, and a 40-word-for-a-bob lettergram
lodged any hour would take on like hot
cakes. This is one class of traffic which
should be cheaper. Quite otherwise is a
class of telegram lodged late in the after-
noon in great numbers for delivery same
day—sales at Homebush and city markets
and so on. To be effective these are “rush”
messages, and the Department has a mini-
mum of time to deal with them. They
should cost lid. per word. The present
“urgent” telegram is a favorite with stock
agents, and as its cost bears very little on
the value of the business it expedites it
should be charged 3d. per word. To sum-
marise I would have the following class
rates :—•'
(a) Lettergrams 40 words Is. (for delivery by
postman in ordinary course next day) between
places where postal service takes more than 48 hours.
(b) Id. per word for messages lodged anywhere
for delivery anywhere on day of such lodgment.
Time of lodgment to be up to 1 p.m. Minimum Is.
(c) lid. per word for messages lodged after
1 p.m. for delivery that day. Minimum Is, 6d.
(d) Urgent telegrams 3d. per word. Minimum 3s.
(e) Suburban (15 miles radius), half rates.
“Ida D.” : I applaud the patriotic and busi-
ness-like suggestion of “W.F.S.” (B.
22/l/’2O) to establish a company to provide
returned men with a mill and other neces-
sary plant for making woollens, etc. I for
one will follow his lead in buying all pos-
sible from such a source, and will do my
best to persuade other people to do so. Also
I will undertake to canvass for shareholders
without commission. And for the love of
Heaven let the mill take on the making of
women’s stockings ! Not flimsy, badly-shaped
articles, such as the shops sell and over-
charge for, but the real honest article at a
fair nrice. Australian women will rush both
for stockings and shares. Like a good Austra-
lian, I have been endeavoring lately to obtain
a pair of tan stockings (cashmere, woollen
feet) made in Australia ; but the answer is
always the same: “Cannot procure.”
When the very bad sinner repents he re-
pents hard to catch up, wherefore a reformed
devil turns hermit and lives the naked life
on bread and water in a cave. In the early
days of Russian Bolshevism factories and
workshops were run by committees of work-
men who elected their own bosses and deposed
them every time they gave an order. Pro-
duction fell to next to nothing, just as it
did in Lane’s New Australia. Also working
hours reached next to nothing. There were
a few glad months while accumulated stocks
and accumulated wealth were being used up.
Then there were liberty and famine unutter-
able. Now the two boss apostles of Bol-
shevism are firmly in the saddle, and because
there are huge arrears of work to make up
the hours of toil have been fixed at 12 per
day, including Sundays. It was probably
inevitable, for the Russian, like the Aus-
tralian, is mostly a toiler at cheap raw-
material jobs, and his credit having given
out he can’t borrow £6 per head per annum
(say £600,000,000 yearly in his case) as
N. S. Wales is doing this year under the
pretence of “public works,” and live on that.
But it was another dismal evidence that
Domain oratory and One Big Union speeches
and glowing diatribes in the Worker are
no substitutes for production. The picture
of gloom is completed by the fact that when
’the Bolshevist mission returned from the
U.S. it was seized and put to work.
“Hm.”: Massy Greene in saying a few
soothing words to a meeting of housewives
in Melbourne said that to deprive jam manu-
facturers of sugar would rob a number of
workers of their employment and close a
large market to fruitgrowers. In short, the
production of sugar is a basic industry on
which several industries that help to pay
the interest bill and keep Australia solvent
rely ; yet it is left in the hands of a private
monopoly, whose interest it may be to keep
the market short-supplied. That policy is
just a.s shortsighted as Britain’s was in
building some of its industries on Ger-
man foundations.
From an old Melbourne pressman:—
With a dim personality, a stub nose and a thin,
characterless voice, Birdwood doesn’t strike one as at
all the sort of man that would be likely to be “tee
Soul of Anzac.” What one misses in him most is
the suggestion of latent power and authority tint
one gets after five minutes’ close quarters with
Monash and Charnel. No doubt his bonhomie is a
bit of sugar-coating that perishes utterly under
military necessity; all the same he is nearer to
the Diggers in comprehensive friendship and free-
dom than any of the Generals that were born
amongst them. Notwithstanding all they had heard,
secret believers in the English caste traditions in
military service must have been paralysed when
a common private exchanged his own battered lid
for Birdwood’s cap while the General pretended
with perfect aplomb that the act was a common-
place. I think the whole secret of Birdie’s success
with Australians is that the humblest foot-slogger
cannot insult him by claiming equality. No doubt
he stands a lot of easy-going familiarity merely in
order to keep his prestige sweet and green, but the
genuineness of his democracy is strongly suggested
by the fact that thousands among a nation notori-
ously suspicious of patronage have regarded him
since Gallipoli as one of themselves.
“El Arish” : The war has ruined General
Ryrie as a dinkum Orangeman. He turned
up on Anniversary Day at the Clifton Gar-
dens (Sydney) function of Colonel Henley
—the Colonel whose only brigade was a stock
of pyjamas and socks —and started by virtu-
ally apologising to those li.C.’s who had
fought with him for being at the show at
all. He then proceeded to assail not
It. C.-ism but Labor. The Orangemen were
first puzzled, then cold. Many of them are
Laborites; and the li.C.’d that they object
to most- are as anti-Labor as Ryrie. Prac-
tically the whole militancy of the N.S.W.
Catholic Federation is directed at the State
education system, and John Storey expressed
his party’s views on that issue in these words
(19/3/T7) :
I have to state emphatically that if the Labor
party is returned to power the declared Labor policy
of free and secular education will be maintained.
But what, after all, could Ryrie do in the
circumstances? A true Orangeman knows
only one tune —“To Hell with the Pope!’’
Soldiers, who met all sorts and denomina-
tions of Australians- during the war, learned
a number of tunes —so many that they have
become unfit for the old choir.
“Rivetina’s” good word from Maoriland:
When Monash remarked at a banquet in London
that the war had drawn Australia and Maoriland
closer together in the bonds of brotherhood (or
words to that effect) he got off something more
than an after-dinner platitude. One notices the
difference between the present feeling and that of
pre-war days. Returned Kiwis have so consistently
and wholeheartedly boomed the Kangaroos that the
elders now regard Australia as something better, after
all, than a la/nd of two-up and manslaughter. “Out
there” a strong affection sprang up between the two
crowds, notwithstanding that in camp in M.L. the
official feeling against Australians was remarkable.
We Aussics who enlisted in M.L. were continually
made wrathful by officers and n.c.o.’s who re-
minded us that we should comport ourselves like
Maorilanders or Englishmen, and not like “a mob
of Australians.” And later when we camped along-
side the Australians in Egypt, at Tel-el-Kebir, offi
cers were detailed to visit our tents and warn us
to keep to ourselves! That shattered my patience,
and when I had made my protest, the officer—a
decent sort —confessed that the job was not to his
liking, but he was obeying orders. He confided
afterwards that the men scoffed violently at the
warning; and it must have been the same with
all companies, for the subject was thereafter dropped.
Australia the other day had a visit from
Thomas Burton, an ex-Senator of the
U.S.A., who was talked of in advance as the
greatest American that had ever come this
way and a very probable future President.
When the ex-Senator turned up he showed
no wish to boom himself: it must have been
a month after the Woman’s Letter had a
talk to him before another paper even men-
tioned him. Nobody could quite make out
what his mission was, if he had one. He
wanted to talk about the League of Nations,
and claimed that he' was really the first
American public man to push the idea of a
League of Nations to the front. As a matter
of fact, Mr. Burton is really a sort of super-
commercial traveller. He is the specialist ; n
international relations whose advice the
great manufacturers and financiers of N’York
take. And rattling good advice it often is.
Just about four years ago Burton addressed
a private meeting of manufacturers at the
Biltmore. He had just returned then from
a study of European conditions, and his
forecast of what was going to happen, and
of how the U.S.A. could profit by it, was
amazingly correct. Even then, by the way.
he pointed to Australia as a field which the
American manufacturer would be able to
exploit with great success. In his present
tour he took in Japan, and studied its prob-
able iufluence on world-trade. »


Of Greater Importance than Gold
The Interstate Commission in the majority report stated ; —
. . .this industry [iron and steel] is the basis of all other
industries, and every country has found it necessary to
encourage its prosperity, not only as it leads to considerable
employment, but because no country can afford to be wholly
dependent on outside sources for a supply of a metal
compared with which gold may even be looked upon as of
secondary importance.”
If all the iron and steel goods imported into Australia were made by our own people
work at Australian rates of pay would be given to not less than
30,000 MEN, o°v"V* £5,000,000 per year.
Engineers should use only
AUSTRALIAN IRON AND STEEL.
POLITICAL
POINTS.
Victoria hopes to make a permanent loss
of onlv about £lOO,OOO a year on the renewal
of its £6,000,000 loan in London, though it
may be more. The money, borrowed at 4 per-
cent. and now to be re-borrowed at about 54
and expenses, was spent so long ago that
the State doesn’t remember what was done
with it or what joy there was in it. It is a
sorrowful business to get a bill for another
£1 on the suit that you did a mash with in
the giddy days of 40 years ago, but these
things happen in the loan market.
Notice to abolishers of capital and such :
It was.on July 19, 1918, that the Russian revolu-
tion abolished the franchise for nil except workmen,
soldiers and peasants and confiscated all private
lands, with livestock and fixtures; also forests, fac-
tories, mines, banks and all means of transit. It
also enacted compulsory labor, but that was rather
a dead letter for a while. But the capital having
been rather eaten up, compulsory working hours were
fixed about the end of the year at Si per week.
Eighteen months of dazzle and very dim dazzle at
that!
Durin - a recent wet spell the N. S. Wales
Minister for Works and the Chief Secretary
and the Attorney-General all “chucked” the
work of N. S. Wales for a day and went as
deadheads to Bowral (81 miles from Sydney,
population 2060) to dig up a bit of glass.
It was the “turning of the first sod" of a
new water-supply to be paid for out of loans.
Any farm-hand could have done it better,
and it was no use or amusement to man or
cow, and most people stayed away from the
dreary function and the dreary speeches.
But in a land where Ministers play
the part of unglorified aldermen or
beadles, it was the correct thing. Bowral
has been waiting and clamoring 30 years for
that water supply, and never once thought
of passing the hat and doing the work itself.
The platitudinous new Senator Duncan,
who has begun to be a disappointment very
early, was recently at Lismore (583 miles
north .of Sydney, and very tired of its dis-
tance from a capital) telling the people that
“the time is inopportune for the creation of
a new State.” Did anyone ever see an
opportune time? Thus for 1918 Australian
records showed 8344 infants that were in-
opportune in point of date, and 6582 that
were ditto in point of convention. Many of
the rest arrived before their clothes. The
sun set 365 times before people were ready
to go to bed and rose 365 times before they
were ready to get up. There were inoppor-
tune accidents, and hailstorms tha*t came
down when nobody was asking for them, and
people got all their taxpapers at, the wrong
moment. All the deaths were inopportune
except the suicides, and when a fire was
opportune the insurance co. generally rang
up the police.
New York held a banquet or clam-bake
lately at which “speakers stated that America
was anxious to know what Australia’s tariff
policy would be.” Well, Australia’s policy
should be explainable enough. First, as N.
S. Wales alone received last year about 74
millions’ worth more goods from Uncle Sam
than Uncle bought from it, it thinks of put-
ting on a specially virulent anti-Uncle tariff
to even up the figures a bit. Second, it
would like to know more about that exchange
mystery which makes it necessary to send
265. lOd. to Uncle in payment for £l. Third,
it would be pleased if U.S. people wouldn’t
tell us quite so often how we ought to run
this benighted country. And (lastly) it is
Australia's fixed policy to mention that the
ships it bought from the U.S. during the
war were a rotten, jerry-built swindle and
obviously made for sale.
Uncle Sam may have used the war to sell
the world a new crop of wooden nutmegs,
but it is probably quite wrong to blame him
altogether for depressing the dollar value
of the English pound until the latter is worth
only about 14s. 2d. in U.S. money. The
American financier may be losing nothing ir
the process; but the American manufacturer
certainly is, while the European manufac-
turer, and especially the British manufac-
turer, is gaining enormously. Twelve months
ago the Australian buyer of most manufac-
tured goods gave his first thought to U.S.A.;
to-day the Yankee is almost out of the ques-
tion, because you have to pay him about
£l4O for £lOO worth of goods. And it is
the same with the European buyers. There
never was a time when the great financial
houses of London stood behind British manu-
facture as they do to-day; and the chances
are that those great houses are much more
responsible than the Yankee himself is for
putting an export duty of over 35 p.c. on
Yankee goods. Incidentally German and
Austrian manufacturers are squealing that
A WINNER EITHER WAY.
LAGO STOREY: “Now whether he kill Holman or Holman him, or each do kill the other,
every ŵay makes my gain.”
Britain, with the backing of the European
Allies, is manipulating its exchange, too.
But in this case a different process is alleged.
There the mark is depressed, so that the
buyer in Germany, purchasing on a mark
-basis, is making a huge profit when he sells
in the currency of his own countrv.
The Bolshevik army is reported to have
found a real general—not the popularly-
elected Ensign Krylenko of the early days,
who uropped out of notice, but Brussiloff, the
aristocrat and brilliant ex-imperial leader.
His wife and family have been secured as
hostages, and will probably die very unplea-
santly if the house-father doesn’t provide a
victory. So Brussiloff will do his best.
This may not be conscription, but it has a
family resemblance.
The fact that David Storey whipped
Edmund Barton badly 26 years ago, and
thereafter held the Rand wick seat in the
N. S. Wales Assembly with ease, has its own
significance. David Storey was an extra-
good commercial traveller; and it was com-
mercial-traveller qualities that won the seat
and held it for over quarter of a century,
just as it was statesman’s qualities that
lost Barton the seat and made him a
wanderer as Parkes had been. In a larger
constituency the statesman has a hope; no
David Storey could beat Barton in a ballot
of the whole State. The smaller the con-
stituency the smaller, as a rule, the man
chosen for it; so the ward politician who
soars above culverts is asking for defeat.
There are more things than one to be hoped
for from the Ma State’s scheme of propor-
tional representation which lumps three or
four of the old electorates into one.
“Yacamu”: Dr. Solf’s appointment as
German ambassador to Japan makes it all
the more imperative that Australia should
have sound, alert and energetic administra-
tion in the Pacific. Not only is Solf extra-
ordinarily able: he is also a most experi-
enced Pacific administrator —it was he who
so completely bluffed the British out of
Samoa. Whatever he is in Japan for it isn’t
for our good, and we shall need to watch our
steps with all the care of which we are
capable. In my view, that means, first and
foremost, co-operation between the authori-
ties in Australia and the British settlers in
the islands. Individually they may not oe
wise; but collectively they Know enough to
be worth consulting, and it may be worth
while encouraging them to know more.
Quite a lot of people in Queensland hoped
that the old preference-to-returned-soldiers
pledge was as dead as it looked; and they
got a nasty shock the other day when the
returned Digger of Cairns started to take off
his coat. The Harbor Board there had given
the old easy pledge; but when an engineer
was to be appointed and the choice lay finally
between a returned man and another, the
other got the job. It was then that the
returned Digger said it was time men were
taught to keep their pledges; and the pre-
vious appointment was hurriedly rescinded.
Now, of course, there are threats of law
from the other party; but if the other party
was aware of the Board’s pledge, he shouldn’t
have applied. And if he wasn’t aware of it
he should have been.
In these times of scarcity the jam manu-
facturers are still kept supplied with sugar
while households go short, aud a good deal
of vituperation is wasted on the subject. The
rock-bottom fact is that the jam industry
would die for want of sufficient sugar, while
the household can struggle along with very
little ; and if the jam business dies the fruit
industry will be at least half-dead, for the
fruit business w r ould be a poor thing without
the 21 millions a year the factories pay it.
The factories employed, at latest advices,
about 6000 people, and their product stands
for one of the biggest of the very few
exports of manufactured goods < that Aus-
tralia possesses. A job that brings money
into the country and puts up a good tight
against the importer shouldn’t be sacrificed
even though the community goes without
sugar in its tea. In fact, a country which
can and won’t grow the raw material to keep
its own simple industries going deserves
nothing in its tea except flies.
A bird came home to roost the other day
in the office of Daily Truth, the official
organ of the Broken Hill A.M.A., which has
been preaching the doctrine of Direct Action
for years past. The boys employed to de-
liver the paper struck for some reason or
other, despite various promises by the -heads,
including one that an independent person
should consider their claims and give a ver-
dict. The boys followed the example of their
tutors, and merely said “To hell with arbi-
tration !” And then they were all sacked.
Such is the brutal way of tyrant capital!
Labor’s dishonored IOU —’Iggs. ’Olman.
’Ughes.
There is a great deal of self-importance
and damaged vanity and not much plaus-
ibility about this proposal of N. S. Wales
Labor Council: —
That in view of the antagonism shown by the
Brewers’ Association towards trades unions and
considering the misery and degradation caused by the
liquor traffic, the Council pledges itself to use every
means in its power to eliminate the industry from
the social system.
The artless combination of reasons suggests
that if the beer strike had been a success
the “misery and degradation” might have
been overlooked. But now, having spoken,
let the Council be a little more deiinite. Is
it out for Prohibition with or without com-
pensation, and in the former case is it for
compensation out of loans? In other words,
if it proposes to pay compensation, is it
prepared to do its own paying or is it
going to charge its spasm of virtue and its
ill-starred beer-strike to posterity?
The Vic. State elections are due in a few
months, and the Lawson Cabinet is nerv-
ously considering the prospect of an influen-
tial Liberal fragment breaking away. There
have already been vague threats of getting
the Nationalist Federation to promise the
malcontents opposition if they should shatter
the sacred principle of solidarity, but the
Federation isn’t enthusiastic about endorsing
a squad of nonentities to unseat Peacock and
his friends. The whole trouble is caused by
the usual office hunger mixed with a genuine
distaste for the Wowserism_ of the Lawson
Government. Lawson is personally an ex-
cellent fellow, but he is deflected from many
a broad-minded course by thoughts of what
the elders will think of it. Some other mem-
bers of his Cabinet and party are victims
of grimy bigotries, and it is even alleged that
the Government has been pressed to lift up
a meek voice in favor of Prohibition.
There is a movement afoot in Melbourne
to form a Middle Classes’ Union on the lines
of the British league with the same name,
which already has 100 branches and 50,000
members. The idea is that the “middle
class” contains architects, accountants,
bankers, journalists, doctors, lawyers, brokers
and agents, as well as civil servants, teachers,
postal officials, and persons having small
fixed incomes from rents, pensions, bank
deposits, etc. This section has suffered most
by the high cost of living and the increase
in rent and food. Its opinions differ, it is
admitted, on a hundred things; nevertheless
its members have large common interests.
For instance, they are nearly always the
sufferers by strikes; they suffer while the
row is in progress, and whoever wins it is
taken out of their hides. They are the buffer
between the two militant sections of the
community; they are the people without a
kick —so obviously without a kick that when
astute politicians “settle” a strike it is
always at their expense. There are tremen-
dous difficulties in the way of organising this
inchoate mass; but they are worth tackling.
Those Victorian legislators who have lately
been asking for a rise are invited to say
whether, in view of these facts, they honestly
think they have earned it. Butter is mostly
sold to grocers ready made up in Mb. and
lib. packets, nicely wrapped in oiled paper
and labelled as .guaranteed under the Dog
Act or something. But a vast number of
those packages are an ounce or so short
weight. And apparently none of all the
Parliaments that have,come and gone since
the beginning of things lias had brains or
energy enough to devise a way of stopping
the swindle. The Vic. Weights and Measures
Act declares the practice illegal, but pro-
vides no penalties for infringement; and
though the municipal councils, including even
the City Bumbles, have for years been ask-
ing for an Act that will be less of a farce,
the State Parliament has always been too
fatigued to do anything. Or is it plain
cowardice ?
Melbourne Socialist party has decided that
it is, after all, the Communist party, so it
has changed its name, after reconstruction,
and has been busy trying to say what it now
stands for. As usual it employs language
that may mean almost. anything: it aims
at “the overthrowing of the capitalist system
by means of a social revolution and the
establishment of socialist communism” ; and
it will employ only “revolutionary politics.”
The Bulletin will be glad to present the
party with its tax-papers for a year
if, without previous consultation, as many
as two of the members will translate the
rigmarole into the same plain English.
UNAPPRECIATED EFFORT.

“News from Wazirstan indicates the possibility of
further stiff fighting. The Mahsuds are determined to
resist our efforts at road-making on the frontier.'’
—London cable message (2/2/’2O).
The Mahsud is an infidel;
He is not civilised.
He flees from place to place on foot;
So one is not surprised
To learn that he received with sneers
Old England’s eager engineers.
They came to him with picks and spades
And asphalt of the best;
They laid down kerbs and guttering,
Yet was he unimpressed;
The product of their skill and brain
Was instantly torn up again.
What waste of energy and zeal!
Here is a peaceful land
With countless miles of rotten roads
All calling for the hand
Of someone skilled in filling holes,
And smoothing ridges, mounds and moles.
The natives would not do a thing .
To check the engineers ;
While wealthy men in ev’ry State
Would welcome them with cheers;
And Millions Clubs would stand them lunch
Both sev’rally and in the bunch.
So let them leave a land whose roads
Cannot be worse than ours;
And we will pledge ourselves that here
They shall use all their powers
Unhandicapped by doubts or fears
On work that may go on for years.

An old friend of the suburban economist, the
law of Supply and Demand, has been operat-
ing with a vengeance in the timber trade.
This co. finds itself with orders “far m
excess of any possibility of supply.” Ship-
ping troubles are partly to blame, for in
VVestralia alone the Kauri Timber Co. has
something like £BO,OOO worth of sticks wait-
ing to be lifted; but a shortage of forest
labor is also responsible for lean supplies.
Nevertheless, the _co. has been able to get
such good prices for the stocks it has been
able to lay hands on, that directors have
lifted the dividend rate to 8 p.c. again, and
then had a comfortable margin for
strengthening reserves. Last year’s gross
profits amounted to £137*567, compared
with £121,877 for the previous year;
but net results were a trifle lower
because the Maoriland Treasury opened
its mouth wider, while considerable expen-
diture has also been incurred remodelling
the co.’s Auckland mill. The modernising of
this plant is also going to cut into the cur-
rent year’s revenue, though the outlay should
effect savings in future terms. However,
the timber business is one in which any
year’s disclosed profits are merely an ap-
proximation. Everything depends on the
basis on which stock (and in this case
forest land) is valued; no doubt the £203,961
of stock held 12 months ago proved to be
worth much more than thut owing to the
heavy increase in prices since, and thus the
past year’s profits may have benefited. There
is no evidence as to whether stocks are con-
servatively valued or otherwise, and even
the co.’s auditors will only venture to re-
mark that the accounts give a correct state-
ment of the co.’s position “so far as they
are in a position to form an opinion.”
Though there is little' doubt that present
high timber prices are likely to be main-
tained for some time, probably stocks have
(they certainly should have) been valued
on a basis which allows a margin to protect
them against an unexpected slump.
A more satisfactory view of the co.’s posi-
tion is got by comparing the balance-sheet
figures over a period of years:—
1911. 1915. 1918. 1919.
Liabilities .. £52,288 £108,812 £45,097 £25,023
Properties, plant 329,472 407,172 401,608 388,774
Stock .. .. 238,502 291,172 215,005 207,997

Liquid assets . . 162,997 88,132 134,627 144,591
It is not much use taking the comparison back
beyond 1911, for prior to that stocks were
lumped with other assets. Over the past
eight years the balance-sheets show an im-
provement of £95,066. But the four years
to 1915 were much more profitable than the
subsequent four. Between 1911-15 the
visible improvement was £48,818 after dis-
tributing £198,900 in dividends; since then
an improvement of £46,248 has shown up,
but £35,100 less has been distributed among
shareholders. Still there may have been sub-
stantial improvements which do not meet
the eye; if, for instance, the market holds
ut) for some years, which seems not unlikely,
maybe that in spite of the hewings of recent
years the co.’s properties will prove to be
worth much more than the figures at which
they stand in the books. The co. has experi-
enced that pleasant shock once before in its
history, when on revaluing its Maoriland
kauri forests it discovered that after years
of working it still had sticks worth more
than the original cost of the properties.
Still, the Kauri Timber Co. has never been
very fat. Twenty years ago it was in trouble,
or thought it was, and 7s. per share was
written off. For some years shareholders
got a very mild return on their money, and
9 p.c. divs. have been the best the co. has
passed out at a time when State construc-
tion booms have been at their height, raking
into consideration the £107,000 of reserves
which have piled up during the past 10 yeais,
present disclosed net profits are nothing to
write home about. Possibly there may be
more in the show for shareholders it higii
prices continue and the management can
solve its transport and labor difficulties. Cer-
tainly it is in a much hedlthier position finan-
cially than it was some years ago,. when it
had to lean on outsiders to finance its opera-
tions. And whereas 10 years ago there were
net assets with a book value of 255. bd. to
represent each £1 of share capital, there are
now assets set down as worth 28s. 4d., while,
as previously remarked, it may turn out that
the co.’s properties have enhanced in value.
Paid capital is £585.000—600.000 shares of
335. each, one quarter of the issue being fully
paid and the rest paid to 15s. per share.

The figures in the last line were made up in
London towards the middle of November,
when, because of drought, the outlook in
Australia was particularly bad. And since
this is a co. which depends very largely on
the seasons, The Bulletin would not be
surprised if the management, with its eye
on the possibility of a lean cycle, did not
keep a little of last year’s easily earned pro-
fits up the sleeve for future use if necessary.
The pastoral finance cos. have not had many
troubles since the British and Australian
Governments arranged a market for the
whole wool clip at What looked like high
prices and backed the scheme financially.
But while this maintained the earnings and
even increased them, war needs called for
higher taxation, and other outgoings in-
creased also. Prior to the war taxation
charged to P. and L. varied between seven
and 10 thousand. What it has been since
then this comparison shows, with other
things:—■

* After writing down premises and providing for
contingencies.
Until recently the co. has always had some-'
thing to say concerning the amounts written
off premises and provided for the deprecia-
tion of investments; but there is silence now.
The profits for the year shown in the first
table cannot fairly be compared with those
for previous years, unless that difference is
kept in mind i and it also has to be remem-
bered that in many previous years (1917, for
instance) large profits made on sales, of
assets —some by this co. itself and some by
another in which it was interested —were
taken into account.
The co. had its beginnings 57 years ago,
and was at one time probably running a
larger area of dry-country squattages than
any other concern. And it was doing excep-
tionally well for its English shareholders,
too; for many years they were receiving
regular 20 p.c. p.a. dividends; later, during
the troublesome ’9o’s, they dwindled to 7j
p.c. p.a., and then the 1902 drought gave
the co. a few hard knocks. But the re-
covery was rapid, and 124 p.c. divs. soon
showed up again. \Vnen the Watson Labor
Government hove in sight the old gentlemen
in London got a bit scared and hastily put
some of their money into Argentina to
escape the Sosh tiger. But things have not
been going all the co.’s way there. _ The
extent of the investments in S’America _ is
not revealed, but 12 months ago the chair-
man confided that business was not being
extended there until the directors were “sure
as to the attitude of the Government to-
wards foreign capital.” Further, the. co.
has found from experience that sheep-raising
and stock-handling is not such a simple busi-
ness in Argentina as it is in the Common-
wealth, despite our droughts and labor pro-
blems.
The A.M.L. and F. has a paid capital
of £520,000, and had, after posting cheques
for the latest divs., £579.549 of visible re-
serves. Besides that £1.099,549 of share-
holders’ funds, the management has a
greater amount of what is now very cheap
money to play with —£1.900.000 of per-
petual 4 p.c. debentures and £10,850 of per-
petual 3 p.c. debentures. Balance-sheet
figures have moved in this way over the past
four years:—
1915. 1919.
Liabilities £408,660 £310,153
Mortgages, properties, stock, etc. 2,413,047 2,003,622
Advances on produce . . . . 54,163 107,986

Cash and investments .. .. 645,680 827,256
Premises.. .. .. .. 204,263 228,791
Lumped with the “mortgages, properties,
stock, etc.” item, thtre is now an unspeci-
fied amount of bank deposits, thus render-
ing comparison with previous figures of little
value. But this is evident: conditions have
been so good that clients have required less
assistance, and the co., besides reducing its
own liabilities, has had a considerable
amount of loose cash which it has been able
to put into gilt-edged securities, etc. Though
the return from these has no doubt been a
good deal less than if the money had been
out at other work, the greater security has
probably been very satisfying to the old
gentlemen in lxmdon who did not know how
the jumbuck was going to jump. With a
surplus of more or less liquid assets over
liabilities (not including terminable stock)
amounting to considerably over £BOO.OOO, at
the latest balance the A.M.L. and F. was
in a very good position to meet whatever
was coming to it.

In 1006 this co. acquired the old Sydney
Cyclorama buildings, and in place of the
nicturisation of the Battle of Gettysburg set
out to freeze mutton and other perishables
and popularise ice-skating. . During the war
years skating was off, though fhe co. con-
tinued to pay good dividends to its share-
holders. Last winter the rink was put into
commission again, and, the refrigerators also
having had a good time, a record profit
showed up for the year, shareholders getting
15 p.c.—equal to more than 17 p.c. to old
holders because of the capitalisation of re-
serves five years ago. Formerly the co. had
a mortgage on its property, but debts have
gradually been worked off until now for the
first time there is a surplus of liquid assets
over liabilities: —
1916. 1918. 1919.
Assets other than premises
and plant £11,427 £8,289 £20,120
Liabilities (inc. dividends) 22,896 12,035 17,451
Excess liabilities.. .. £11,469 £3,746
Surplus assets .. .. £2,666
While that £14,000-odd improvement in the
liquid position has shown up in three years,
concurrent with the payment of handsome
dividends, buildings, plant, etc., have been
maintained. Part of the accumulations may
no doubt presently be called for to make re-
newals ; at any rate, book value of the plant,
etc., has been written dow r n from £53,929 to
£42,559, which seems to suggest something
of the sort. The value of the freehold has
remained stationary at £33,635. After pay-
ment of current dividends there were net
assets with a book value of 235. to represent
each £1 share. Since old holders have had
more than their original capital returned to
them during the past eight years, and as the
books show 265. 7d. of net assets in hand to
represent every £1 they put into the con-
cern, they have done extremely well.

That £6414 of profit for the past half easily
beats all previous records, and the sudden
spring suggests that some commissions
hitherto reserved pending the winding-up of
estates have been now brought into account.
Four years ago there was a somewhat similar
leap; but expense and taxes have increased
so much that to show a £3OO improvement on
the previous-best returns earnings have had
to expand £2479. This comparison gives
further details: —
Commissions,
Dec half Bents, etc. Expenses. Taxes.

Last half-year £7BO was also distributed as a
“peace bonus” to the staff. The revenue-
earning assets comprise £47.843 in public
securities, with a further £15,962 in premises.
The extent of the Equity’s trust business,
however, is not disclosed, and because of the
erratic movements of the figures in the profits
column it is not possible to gauge the growth
of business. What is clear is that share-
holders are doing very well indeed. In 1916
their paid capital was doubled by the issue of
bonus shares, and in a brief 34 years since
then thev have had in divs. an amount ex-
ceeding the capital they actually put into
the business. Meantime £7650 has been
added to visible reserves. But though the
co. is fattening its proprietors, for the ser-
vice it provides it doesn’t profiteer. Besides
doing their work, as a rule, much more
cheaply than the private trustee —because of
their more efficient organisation—trustee cos.’
capital (called and uncalled) is an insurance
fund to protect trusts against pilfering or any
loss due, as the N.S.W. Act puts it. to “any
breach of trust or duty committed by the co.
or any of its officers.” Besides the Equity s
revenue-producing assets already mentioned,
there is a further £19.663 in cash, book debts,
etc., and £469 of office furniture. At the
balance the co. did not owe a penny, and
thus had altogether nearly £84,000 of assets
readily available to protect its customers,
with 'a further £200,000 of capital callable
if anything very terrible should happen. But
the uncalled liability of £2 on each £2 10s.
share is not likely to cause shareholders any
loss of sleep; so far as blundering is con-
cerned trustee co. managements are highly
specialised in the safety-first art (particu-
larly in this case, for the Board includes
several legal heavyweights), and the con-
tinual audit of their books is an added pro-
tection for all hands.

Note, first, that, for some reason or other
connected with the trade, the year is divided
into one period of five and another of seven
months; but in the dividend column of the
table, for the sake of tidiness, these irregu-
lar periods are regarded as exact half-years.
Since the June accounts £18,453 more capi-
tal has trickled in ; but at the balance none
of it had apparently been employed in extend-
ing the business; a few thousands had gone
into stocks, which are much more expensive
than they used to be, and the rest was tem-
porarily in deposits and investments. This
shows the position more clearly—the com-
parison goes back to the beginning: —

The getting in of the new capital resulted
in the surplus of more or less liquid assets
(including stocks) over liabilities being in-
creased from* £17,667 at June 30 last to
£38,607 at the latest balance. But because
the new funds are thusfar producing little,
the much-improved net profit is all the more
satisfactory. The co.’s tannery and its
leather and belting factory were kept
busy during the whole of the term. Never-
theless, this and other cos. in the business
are so far handling only a very small frac-
tion of the hides produced in the Common
wealth. A very wide field lies before these
cos. once the export trade can be organised
and local labor recovers its senses. At pre-
sent employees in the industry are inclined
to hitch on to the 0.8. U. and try its policy
of direct action, and each of two branches
of the leather business has lately seen a
single firm selected as the target for a “scien-
tific” strike. If labor wants to do better
than it is at present doing, it can be easily
managed—by assisting the manufacturers to
build up their output until outsiders who
want the superior Australian article_ pay a
lot more of the good prices which will pro-
vide better wages. So far as Mangrovite
Belting is concerned, it is steadily expand-
ing, despite all pinpricks. From the begin-
ning it has paid regular 10 p.c. divs., and.
though reserves are trifling, it is in a com-
fortable position, chiefly because _ this is a
business which requires comparatively little
capital tied up in plant, etc. The co. is
now listed on Sydney ’Change, and nominal
capital of £50,000 having been fully sub-
scribed and paid, shareholders recently
agreed to the creation of a further 50,000
£1 shares, which will be put out when the
directors —headed by Chas. _ Ludowici. for
many years with the old pioneering J. C.
Ludowici firm —consider an opportune time
has arrived for further expansions. Some are
already being made with the capital lately
got in.

THE SIGN OF
AGOOD SHINE
Suspecting that much of the war gratuity
will be "blevved” if not safeguarded, Vio.
Under-Treasurer Minogue has put forward
a scheme for distributing the money so as to
do the Digger the most permanent good.
He suggests the purchase of a one-premium
policy for each soldier who wants a house
or a farm. The Federal Government would
purchase these policies and hold them as
security for loans to Diggers. If the soldier
died the co. would pay over sufficient to help
free a house or to reduce the debt on the farm,
as in the case of house-purchase policies
at present issued by some offices. Minogue
also. suggests that some Diggers might
readily use the “blood money” to buy annui-
ties if the advantages were propeiiy ex-
plained to them. Any scheme which will
tend to prevent the indiscriminate spending
of the gratuity should be considered by the
Federal Government. The insurance cos.
would no doubt willingly accept the bonds
and undertake business at practically cost
price.

A strong new combination consisting of
leading English white-lead corroders and
Broken Hill cos. has put up £300,000 to
manufacture white-lead and paint from Bar-
rier material. Australian Lead Manufac-
turers Pty., Ltd., has acquired 22 acres at
Oabarita, on the Parramatta, and last week
Premier Holman laid the foundation-stone of
the works. With the plant it is proposed to
instal the co. anticipates producing white-
lead and paint almost equal to the Common-
wealth’s requirements. Since other local
manufacturers have been very successful dur-
ing recent years, the Commonwealth should
soon have a considerable exportable surplus.
Incidentally, the new concern hopes to avoid
labor troubles by introducing the most up-
to-date sweat-saving machinery and also by
welfare work. A dining-room providing hot
meals at bare cost, a recreation hall and
library, free overalls and free laundry are
on the programme. Vic.’s Attorney-General
(Arthur Robinson, M.L._C ) is the co.’s
chairman. From which it may perhaps be
deduced that Lionel G. Robinson and Clarke,
of London, are interested parties.
* * * *
The next coal-mining upheaval is to be
about many things, the principal being less
production (30 hours per week), and
payment by time instead of by work
done. More payment for work done
is quite reasonable. But payment whether
work is done or not in anv industry
where payment by results is nossible is a
foolish, unpatriotic swindle in a country
like Australia where half the work is left
undone. There is just one point about the
idea—it prevents any man rising out of the
ruck bv superior ability. All are on a dead
level, with the solitary figure of the political
or union boss appearing above the billiard-
table plain of compulsory mediocrity.
Port Pirie’s supply of concentrates is
now about exhausted, and there seems no
likelihood of further supplies from the Bar-
rier for some time. Anyhow, the coal short-
age is so acute that even if the smelters had
material they would be compelled to curtail
operations. At the best of times S. Aus.
never has large coal reserves, and when
trouble hits the State the capital invari-
ably commandeers all available stocks at
Pirie. On present indications, a week or
two ought to see the Associated Smelters
hang the “No work” board on the gates.
There are still very large quantities of
metals at Pirie for the market to absorb;
so the men are likely to suffer more from
the stoppage of production than the cos.

Position and not prospects are counting
in the present Hampton Plains boom. Re-
cently the market in Celebration Junctions
improved in spite of adverse reports from the
management, and a few other shows, notably
the Nor’-West and White Hope Extended,
at Slavin’s, soared for no apparent reason
than in anticipation of a gamble. Junction
has furnished some good values, and may
also respond at depth; but so far the North-
West and White Hope Extended have pro-
duced nothing to blow about. Further, be-
tween these shows and the White Hope
itself is broken and disturbed country, which
reduces the likelihood of either of them get-
ting the continuation of the White Hope
shoot even should it traverse that co.’s
reserve block.

Civial Hawkins, late of the Riverina
South, Boulder No. 1, and other Westralian
shows, is to manage the Celebration at Hamp-
ton Plains. Dick Hamilton, who selected
him, has agreed to act as a sort of honorary
consulting engineer to the co. Giblin, of
Edna May Central, is said to have been
sought for the job, but the White Hope
crowd got in first. Development work has
been resumed _in the Celebration, and by
the time a mill has been decided on sub-
stantial reserves of ore are expected to be
available. The . crushing average of 'the
mine to start with will pi*obably be about
50s. per ton.

The Lake View and Oroya Board makes
no bones about its reasons for reconstruct-
ing the. present co. as an “investment trust.”
The object of the scheme is to avoid liability
for income-tax and excess-profits duty on any
surplus from the realisation of the co.’s
investment holdings, the most important of
which is that in the Burma Corporation.
Provision is made in the scheme of reorgani-
sation for increasing the salary of each
director to £3OO a year, the chairman to
receive £5OO. The Board is also to divide
2$ p.c. of profits in any year in which share-
holders get £50,000 (12$ p.c.) or over.
Ivanowna (W.A.) is awakening from a
long sleep, Dorrie Doolette and others hav-
ing taken an option over a group of mines
with fair performances. They include
several old-time claims of prominence which
have together yielded to date about £200,000.
Twenty years ago several London cos. were
at work on this field, and thousands of allu-
vial miners were doing well. One claim
alone on the Fitzroy lead yielded its four
owners over £30,000.

For its past financial year Ivalgurli
(W.A.) realised £74,644 from sale of gold,
of which £4212 represented premiums on bul-
lion sold through the Gold Producers’ Asso-

as this sum, with £176 brought in, was in-
sufficient to pay the 3s. div. distributed, the
Board had to dip into reserves for nearly
£6OO. At the balance investments and cash
in hand were valued at £56,000 and stores
at £5,322. The manager stated that dia-
mond drilling had located two promising ore
bodies.

smelters and lead mines in the West, made a
profit of £8542 for year ended July last,
and paid a 15 p.c. dividend. This result
was obtained notwithstanding that, owing to
the collapse of the lead market and high
production costs, operations were suspended
for a time during the early part of last year.

An attempt is to be made in Victoria to
revive mining. A body called the Mining
Revival Association has been brought into
being. The idea is to open a publicity cam-
paign to let people in Australia and Britain
know more about the resources of tne State
in metallic and non-metallic minerals. W.
G. Spence, ex-M.11.R,, one of the founders
of the Miners’ Assoc., will be president, and
help Allan Bowler to establish branches in
the old mining towns.

The Melbourne group of promoters of
Badak tin floats had an anxious moment or
two last week when word went round that
the Federal Treasury intended to intervene
in the boom. Though the abandonment of
the War Precautions regulations gives full
freedom to promote in Australia, the restric-
tions on floats to work oversea enterprises
have not been lifted. The Bux and Jungle
crowds are said to Have been hauled on the
carpet; but some of the little syndicates
were not even up for caution. The yarn
got around that the Treasury had power,
and would probably use it, to demand a
refund to purchasers of shares and cancel
market sales. It was a grim joke to play
on the promoting fraternity.
Of the Badak floats, the Jungle has an
application in for land ; the Bux is to have
a block of the Badak property ; and prospec-
tor Gray is credited with having picked up
some of the Lord’s earth nearby the Badak.
Half a dozen other ventures are poising
awaiting a chance to participate in the
gamble. _ Meantime further word is awaited
from Wilson a« to whether later bores con-
firm his first checking.
The fuss over the delay in the publica-
tion of news of the results of boring on Tong-
kah Compound’s tw r o new areas ended in-
gloriously. This was because no Stock
Exchange committee is able to adjudicate
on issues of the kind. It may think it can,
but it can’t, because the Board of any co.,
with sufficient fight in its make-up, has only
to tell the committee to do its "worst and
be d—d, and the committee is likely to lapse
into silence. Block 10 did something of that
kind in the misty past, and the stock is
still listed. Palfreyman and Pratt met the
Exchange committee for the Compound
Board and smoothed things over; so
the committee gives it out that it has
accepted “the explanation of the Tongkah
Compound directors that they did not con-
sider the information important enough to
notify the Stock Exchange and shareholders
until the directors had considered it on Mon-
day afternoon.” This announcement raises
more than one nice point. In particular, is
it the directors or the secretary who should
act?. Some offices don’t wait for Board
meetings to give out news that is likely
to tell on the market. Other secretaries
efface themselves till the Board meets. In
this case, even if the Board did not con-
sider the information important enough to
publish, other people who had a hint of
things, not necessarily through the office,
thought otherwise. But, as said at the out-
set, Stock Exchange inquiries of this kind
must be ineffective. No committee would go
the. whole hog and de-list a stock for fear
of injuring perfectly innocent shareholders.

J. Calvert now runs Sloane and Scotch-
man’s, Stawell (Vic.), but he has not had
time so far to make records. The mine is low
grade, as the ore works out at only about
80s. gold per ton, while extraction costs con-
tinue steady at 225. Under Couchman 20
heads were kept going partial time. Another
10-head have been added, and the mill now
rattles on three shifts daily; so that at the
end of the next three months proof should
be forthcoming whether crudes and tails can
be made to yield profits by milling and con-
centrating on a large scale. If so, there will
be no trouble about raising cash to enlarge
the mill and put up plant for the handling
of the mill products. Arsenic is a by-product,
but has so far gone to waste.

Tom Pugh, known all over the Common-
wealth and the sole sdrvivor of the old job-
bing crowd of the Melbourne Stock Ex-
change ring, goes for election, having got
the call of the late W. T. Jones’s seat. One
of the beliefs concerning the latter famous
punter after he moved on to .London with
a pile made out of Broken Hills and Bal-
larat alluvials was that luck would not stick
to him in Blighty if he sold his seat. So he
held it till he faded out. Stock Exchange
seats bring in £5OO even in these dull days.
Long after Billy Jones left he could have
got double that sum for his. The highest
price paid for seats 'Was about the land
boom era, when up to £2300 was given by
one of the notable punters of those days
for the privilege of losing his cash.
Star Gully, Tingha (N.S.W.),has squeezed
out 1$ tons oxide from 2000 cub. yds., so
shares have jumped from obscurity to close
to the 30s. mark. T. W. Horton not only
furnished Stringer’s office with the data
needed to bring in the cash and get the show
off the stocks, but he sponsored it so well
that a fair-sized area of adjoining * ground
was bought. Thus the co. holds a plot contain-
ing about 400,000 cub. yds. of easily-handled
drift. If a big slice of this should pan out
41b. ground profits ought to be all right,
provided an ample water supply can be
secured. Star Gully is regarded as a good
thing because the tin from the first clean-up
came from overburden, also because the
average contents top the bore sampling. The
pumps are now sluicing out a surface pad-
dock so as to get down to wash.
* * * *
Henry Chinn sets out to defend the price
(£BO,OOO in shares and £lO,OOO in cash)
asked by the vendors and promoters of the
Atlas Portland Cement and Coal Co.:—
The Wild Cat (B. 29/l/’2O) asks “whether the
price is a fair one, taking into account that appar-
ently no development work has been done.” Refer-
ence to the prospectus will disclose that coal has
been proved on both sides of the Main Dividing Range
by tunnels driven for some distance on the coal.
The positions of these tunnels will satisfy any person
familiar with the Western coalfields that the seams
are the Lithgow and Irondale. On a conservative
calculation there is awaiting production the enormous
quantity of 40 million tons coal at least, making this
part of the co.’s proposition one of considerable value.
The clay shale beds have been opened in many
places by sinking shafts to a depth of 15ft. or 16ft.
without bottoming the shale.
Regarding the limestone, no development work is
necessary, for the huge mass comprising the deposit
rises in a vertical wall to a height of 300 ft. or
more above the surface level.
It is fair to assume that the freehold portion
allotted to the town site and residential area will,
on subdivision, return a very substantial profit on
the purchase price, as instanced at Kandos during the
last few years. Wherever cement works are built
a new township is established, and as a rule one-
third of the capital required is obtained by the
natural increase in land values. The promoters of
the Kandos Co. on a capital of £200,000 reserved
to themselves 60,000 shares and £lO,OOO in cash
for a property less than one-third the size and value
of the Atlas Co. and 35 miles further from Sydney.
Kandos has proved a success. W T ith a better and
bigger proposition the Atlas Co. promoters consider
they are justified in asking the amount fixed, for
With the money subscribed and the profit from sub-
division and sale of coal there will be enough and to
spare for establishing works on the basis of a
dividend-paying concern similar to those existing in
the district.
After wondering for 30 years whether
Leigh’s Greek brown coal is any good, and
deciding that it probably isn’t, S. Aus. is
going to put the stuff to a test. A small
pulverising plant is to be installed, and a
loco, engine converted to use the product;
and it is reckoned that, if the experiment
fails, the loss won’t be more than £5OOO,
anyhow. Some of the local references to
the trial are gloomy enough to make one
wonder whether there are not people in
Adelaide who don’t want it to succeed. Any-
way, there’s very little of the spirit which
says that it’s got to succeed.

J. B. Lewis is emphatic concerning the
prospects of the Federation, Heemskirk
(Tas.). On Lewis’s prospectus figures—
which were not all they might have been—
-40,000 shares were placed by the float. Since
then Lewis has been looking deeper into the
proposition, and he now talks of “bodies
of ore running up to 10 p.c. tin
oxide.” Gravitation can be utilised to en-
sure easy transport, and water-power is
even better than anticipated. So, with tin
at anything like current prices, he concludes
that the property is a very valuable one,
and should provide handsome profits. A
start with 30 head of stamps is on the
cards.

It will be 30 years to-morrow (Feb. 6)
since Parkcs called the Melbourne Confer-
ence—the first convened to consider Austra-
lian federation. Of the 13 representatives
who attended Samuel Griffith (Q.). William
McMillan (N.S.W.), Dr. Cockburn (S.A.)
and the aged Bird (Speck) are the only sur-
vivors.
Born in leap year, Justice Duffy, of the
High Court, has a birthday in 1020. He
will be 08 on February 20. Justice Hig-
gins (6S) is the patriarch of the High Court
Bench. Chief Justice Knox and Justice Rich
are in their 57th year. Justice Isaacs is 04,
and Justice Powers will soon be 07.
The late Edmund Barton was responsible
for one little interjection that has called for
years and years of explanation. It was in
the early Boer-war period, and Holman was
getting off a pro-Boer speech in the N.S. Vv .
Assembly, when Barton interjected, “Whom
do you wish to win—Britain or Boer?” To
the amazement of everybody Holman hurled
back, “The Boer!” and then and there set
to work to defend his hope in the triumph
of right. In his Labor days the Liberals used
to point to his remarks and say “Disloyal!”
Now Labor digs up the same observations
and says “ traitor”---chiefly because it
sounds nasty.
Simon Hickey, member for Alexandria in
N.S.W. Assembly, and secretary of the old
Parliamentary Labor party, was a bad
fourth in the Botany Labor selection ballot
(five to run), and looks like falling between
two stools. They prefer their politics hot
out that way, and Hickey has neither abuse
for opponents nor a guillotine for friends.
The fact that it would probably pay him
better to leave politics alone doesn't help
in an industrial centre either. In the House
he is w r ell liked and capable of as much
good to his party as if he roared twice as
loud and three times as fast. He occasion-
ally has a sprint along the Inky Way, and
The Bulletin is always glad to see his copy.
Samuel Hutchinson, who has been ap-
pointed second member of the Vic. Fair
Profits Commission for one year at a salary
of £lOOO, is an elder brother of William
Hutchinson, Minister for Education; and
Minister Hutchinson is a personal friend
of Premier Lawson. Treasurer McPherson,
who was mainly responsible for persuad-
ing Samuel Hutchinson to take the job,
probably made a bad tactical blunder in
doing it. Anyhow, there has been a lot of
chatter on the subject: Vie. is still a little
more sensitive on such matters than Ma
has lately proved herself to be. McCay,
the chairman, is a former member for
Castlemaine—and a general—and lie is to
get £1250. The third member, Charlie Gray,
has thrown up his billet as Trades Hall sec.
to take this £lOOO a year post for one year.
In any case the Trades Hall job might
have relinquished him: he has been losing
favor, as all old Labor battlers do sooner
or later. Holloway is likely to be his suc-
cessor.
They run in all shapes. Lieut. Leonard
McCarthy, a V.C. who has just got back
home to Westralia, and whose performances
were too audacious to be believed, was known
on Gallinoli as “Fat,” and as his rotundity
didn’t diminish the name stuck.
When Deakin was Vic. Minister for
Works in the Service-Berry team ( r B3-86)
he would stop a long-winded country deputa-
tionist by intervening suavely and saying:
“1 think I catch your main point; you desire
me to understand
that this is a
national work, and
that the State
should, therefore,
do it or find a big
share of the cost.”
Too dense or two
shrewd to detect
the satire, the
deputationist would
endorse the inter-
pretation and sic
down. Last week
Donald Mackinnon
got off the gag on
a deputation which
he heard as Law-
son’s proxy at the
Lands Department.
There are times
when Mackinnon
still reminds old
friends of his
association with the
great Higinbotham.
R. C. OLDIIAM.

From the Federal Gallery:—
In the disaster that befell the Hughes party in
X. S. Wales Jack Lynch, of Werriwa, went down
without anybody troubling to drop a tear at his
funeral. Yet Jack is worth kindly remembrance. An
amti-Conscriptionist to the last drop of his vocabulary,
he still managed to leave the Labor party on a
matter of principle affecting his political freedom.
But the man’s honesty and his courage saved him
from the ill-feeling which his former colleagues de-
veloped towards Laird Smith, Archibald and others.
Lynch was the only one who sat opposite his old
pals without losing any of their friendship and
esteem, and in time their cordiality removed the
early diffidences John felt in his new surrounding's,
and brought him out as a speaker determined to
astound the Fourth Estate with his fervid perorations.
Jack always began tamely, but when he was
approaching the end he rolled out the gaudy plunder
of Cassell’s Popular Educator or some similar pub-
lication, mixed with a flood of visionary prophecies
and hopeless Hibernianisms. One night when he was
sinking magnificently in the torrent of his verbiage
and was questioning Australia’s political course in
a series of unaccountable “Whithers?” he happened
to pause for breath. Then sotto voce came from
the Labor corner: “His whithers are unwrung.” In
the laugh that followed Jack sat down. He could
enjoy a joke with the best, but a telling interjection
was always fatal to his fluency.
’’Bill” Lennon was the first Speaker to
appear in the Chair in the Queensland As-
sembly without the gown. His successor,
Bertram, has followed suit. Ex-shearer Bill
Hamilton, president of the nominee House,
still wears the trappings; he knows that if
an attempt were made to end tradition in
that ancient assemblage, there would be a
howl worse than the one over Lennon’s ap-
pointment as Lieut.-Governor.
Latimer, who has regularly won the prize
for the most silent member of the N. S.
Wales Leg. Assembly since Mobbs of Parra-
matta left it, is another of those who are
dodging the boot that threatens to flatten
the purely local man in the larger elector-
ates. lie will retire to the drapery shop he
owns in the electorate which he has repre-
sented for 18 years.
COLLES'S FIRST IMPRESSION OF
BIRDIE ON GALLIPOLI.
The new Senators are a fairly comprehen-
sive lot —three farmers, two graziers and one
orchardist; three lawyers and one who calls
himself an “agent”; two carpenters and a
clerk ; a journalist, a secretary, an engineer
and an ex-public servant who is also a Briga-
dier. One —Newland —calls himself a Sena-
tor by occupation. Otherwise the man who is
frank enough to say he lives by politics
hasn’t transpired yet.
Major-General M. F. Downes, R.A., who
has been residing in Victoria since his re-
tirement in 1902, will be 86 on Feb. 10. The
veteran served in the Crimea, commanded
the Royal Art'llery at Mauritius in the
early ’sixties, and was military commandant
in S. Aus. and Victoria for many years. His
son, Colonel Rupert Downes, went through
the Great War.
Bill Lawrie, one of the best-known of
Northern Territory pioneers, died at Dar-
win this week. Bill had been in and out
of many large holdings, and is credited with
having made as high a pile as any cattle-
man of those parts.
Sydney Millions Club’s new secretary is
Frank Edwards. As a mere boy he was
in the law office where Holman lay in wait
for fees that rarely came: and Holman,
always a good friend to his friends, has
looked after him ever since. As a mere
youngster he gained by Holman’s influence
the opportunity to tackle Fitzpatrick in the
Orange electorate, and made a good fight of
it. Since his patron became Premier, he
has been his confidential man—they were
together in France when the shell which
killed General Holmes lobbed among them.
The move to the Bilious Club has a signi-
ficance of its own.
In the House of Reps. Higgs, the apostle
whom Judas expelled, will presumably sit
on a back cross
bench; but where
is he going to rest
his bones when
Parliament is not
actually sitting ?
Like Gardiner in
the Senate, he is a
party of one; and
if Gardiner is
allotted a room all
to himself, why not
treat Higgs like-
wise? M. K. Mc-
Kenzie, member for
Upper Goulburn in
the Vic. Assembly,
has a room to him-
self because he is
blind and has to
keep a private sec.
alongside him ex-
cept when in the
House. Campbell
Jones, now manag-
ing-editor of Syd-
ney Sun, was the
first to thus serve
McKenzie, and that
was 25 years ago.

Creek and near the boundary of W.A. and
the Territory. imst year the’, took 1200
bullocks over a 130-mile dry stage with a
loss of nine. That was in the course of a
trek of nearly 1500 miles from the Sturt’s
Creek country to Townsville.
“Ithuriel” Maling, of the Argus, who has
been taking part in the Back-to-Kyneton
spree in Vic., told a group of old friends
that it was a letter written by him to the
local Guardian 40-odd years ago expressing
indignation at the howling-down of Murray
Smith by loyal Liberals at a public meeting
in the town which prompted M. K. Arm-
strong, the proprietor, to offer him a job as
a reporter.
The dapper little Drake-Brockman, who
comes to the Senate from the West, first
learned how to word his fellow-man in the
Young Liberals’ Society of Perth, from which
also came a member of the late Lefroy
Government, It. T. Robinson, K.C. Drake-
Brockman was by no means the most pro-
minent or promising member of the society,
but he had a polished way with him that
made friends, and that, coupled with his war
services, is doubtless why the Federal House
will soon hear the little Brigadier’s piping
voice.
Albert Bruntnell, M.L.A., the somewhat
physically unconvincing apostle of teetotal-
ism, who had prospects of being brought
into the Holman Cabinet, was a brigadier—
no less—in the Salv’army when old-man
Booth made his last visit here 20 years
ago. Booth announced a lecture to the offi-
cers one morning. To this there was a good
roll-up, but “Briggy” Bruntnell and two
others came in tip-toeing and crouching
when the show was half over. Of course
there was the usual interruption, in the
midst of which the General, with no thought
of how his words might be applied, sawed
o<ut: “Heed what I’m saying—don’t mind
these crawlers.”
Anderson, Sec. of Yic. Law Department,
is to retire in August. He may be given
leave of absence unless he desires to remain
till Arthur Robinson, Attorney-General, re-
turns from England seven months hence. If
the Mines Department is abolished as a
separate administrative entity, Dickson, the
permanent head, who has just turned 60,
may go out or put in a couple of years at
the Law Department. Dickson has the
judicial temperament—he made a fine police
magistrate—and it is a treat to meet him
after dealing with fussy folk. The worst
official time he ever had was while Drysdale
Brown, who didn’t know what he wanted,
was Mines Minister.
Jack Cochran, member for “The Rocks,”
goes out with this Parliament, having failed
to secure selection. Cochran was a cap-
able secretary, who made the Sydney Labor
Council an interesting, influential body, and
going into Parliament as the Darling Har-
bor representative was looked upon by
unionists as a likely Minister for Labor.
In the House, however, he was only heard
in indignant questions about the treatment
of tenants in the Government-resumed
Rocks area. The “harsh treatment of old
tenants who have resided in the same house
for 10 years and are now to be evicted”
was usually explained to be due to the
tenants paying no rent, and showing no in-
clination to pay any; and as Cochran didn’t
seem able to take up any other question a
feeling got abroad that the Parliamentary
job wasn’t what he w T as cut out for.
THE DEATH OF BACCHUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bacchus, the fallen god, dejected, wept
In the damp darkness of a cellar’s womb ;
About him empty casks and bottles slept,
The air was heavy with the breath of doom,
But softly threaded with the plaintive sighing
Of long-forgotten songs. Bacchus was dying.
A great moist toad, a mass of flesh and shame,
He sprawled and conjured up the brave dead past.
Lighting again the red wine’s leaping flame,
Tasting the joy of old blood running fast.
He was a king of shades. His ears were ringing
With shouted laughter and his gifts of singing.
Forgetful of the men in coats of black
Who with shrill clamor had destroyed his throne,
He saw the vanished pomp come surging back.
The peoples who had bowed to him alone
Came with their cheery lips, their bright eyes
shining,
Came with soft rounded limbs gleaming and twining.
The wind ran leaping through the swaying trees,
The sunshine showered kisses on the grass,
And in his leopard-skin he lay at ease
Watching the glory of the wild rout pass,
The maids, full-bosomed, with their nimble dances,
The hairy vine-draped men of burning glances.
The shadows bound their flesh in nets of lace,
The leopards like gay sins frisked in their play ;
Slim as green reeds the youngsters sprang to race,
And it was joy to see the brown girls sway
On their white ankles as they paused, and drinking
Started the gay eyes of the leaves a-winking.
The throng swept past in one hot flash and cry
Of shining flesh and green leaves and the sun,
Of music echoing to the broad kind sky,
Red wine and passion, kisses and wild fun;
And Bacchus, red-eyed, watched them dwindle,
vanish,
With a deep pride the present could not banish.
The splendor that was Rome was born again;
The grey walls turned to marble white as milk,
Rose petals drifted down in scented rain
Upon the tables rich with gold and silk,
Where feasters sat with hearts and senses glowing
With the glad gifts which were the vine’s bestowing.
It was a triumph of the magic grape
Which gives to men deep joy; the perfumed air
Was heavy with the sound of strings, an ape
Played with a sleeping slave-girl’s tangled hair.
They toasted Bacchus as the petals drifted
On brimming beakers to the heavens lifted.
There came the sounds of fans, the room was lit
With shaded tapers and made rich with art;
Gay powdered dames were courted by the wit
Of gallant men, and one with hand on heart
Quaffed from a shoe and made a pretty saying,
Toasting a dimple just to see it playing.
Outside the pane an orchard’s blossom smiled,
The pewter shone about the long, low room,
And on the brown oak table rang the wild
Beating of flagons, while the mellow boom
Of. men’s deep voices rose and smoke went stealing
In soft vague clouds to kiss the mellowed ceiling.
He held his last review of those brave folk
O’er whom he reigned in pride in days long dead.
They came, the tipsy ghosts, to kiss the yoke
To which they bowed because the wine blushed red.
From age to age Bacchus passed through his story,
Drinking his long last draughts of love and glory.
He saw the rear-guard of his army pass:
Men in red jackets who were fond of port,
And their sons’ sons who tossed aside the glass
After a little while, for life was short —
The last sad “drunk” crept home, and Bacchus
waking
Found he was lonely and his heart was aching.
Then he, the tyrant of the ages, wept,
Hearing high voices pipe outside the door ;
Knowing his enemies upon him swept,
He crouched upon the cellar’s barren floor.
The tyrant of the vine-chains and great drinking
Into a giant toad was fading, shrinking.
He heard their feet clad in goloshes come
With righteous clamor, while their thin bent legs
Shook in their baggy trousers; growing numb,
Swiftly he drained death’s bumper to the dregs.
Then all the cheerful past with dreadful crying
Swept from the place. Bacchus was dying! Dying!
In the de-licensed house men sought more room
For storing bedsteads, pews and broken chairs;
They found the cold toad lying in the gloom
And threw it to the cat upon the stairs;
They had no time to see the jewel, only
The bloated toad... .Outside the Spring mourned
lonely.

SOCIETY
JUDGING BY APPEARANCES.
G IRLIE: “And will my Archibald he able to
buy all the clothes I require ?”
HER ARCHIBALD: “Sure thing, Girlie! They
are a mere trifle.”
“Bay Road”: The squad of newchums
detailed to act as funeral escort had succeeded
in converting the ceremony into a farce.
The marching had been execrable and the
firing party had pulled the triggers by num-
bers instead of simultaneously, but the climax
arrived when the bugler sounded the Last
Post too soon. On the return to camp the
Major paraded the rabble and exploded: “Of
all the miserable blankers it has ever been my
misfortune to command you lurid savages
take the cake! Dammit, the only poor
blighter who knew anything about his busi-
ness was the corpse ! Dismiss !”
“C. Coral”: Tlie Anglican Cathedral at
Thursday Island, usually known as the
Quetta Memorial Church, unique iq many
ways, has added to its novelties. Within
it Australian natives have for the first time
been admitted to Holy Orders. The cere-
mony took place recently when Bishop New-
ton (who manages to get a day or
two at home occasionally—his last trip
away took seven months) made deacons
of Joseph Lui and Poey Passi, two
natives of Murray Island, Torres Strait.
The necessary preliminary instruction
Avas imparted to them at St. Paul’s
College, Moa Island, where Rev. G.
A. Luscombe deals out theology in a cocoa-
nut-leaf and grass “college.” Both the black
brothers are of a highly intelligent type.
Native dress is to be adhered to, and the
Bishop has even made boots taboo, so the
back-sliding parishioner will have to keep
his eyes well skinned to dodge his appointed
shepherd.

“Essington”: The Vestey firm which runs
the meatworks at Darwin also holds on
lease or grazing license just on 30,000
square miles, or, roughly, 20,000.000 acres,
in the Northern Territory—as much as the
area of Scotland. Besides that it holds
3000-odd square miles at Sturt’s Creek, just
over the W.A. border, and a few other areas
in Westralia. Still, it has not a single sta-
tion to come up to Victoria DoAvns (N.T.),
held by Bovril Estates, Ltd. That runs to
12,000 square miles, or, including some de-
tached blocks, 16,000 square miles, which
is more than twice the size of Wales and
half the size of all Ireland. It is the big-
gest cattle ranch in the woidd, and is said
to have over 100,000 cattle on it; but the
figures on the latter point are a bit uncertain.

“Esckay”: Seaham was the laziest fellow
in the class 15 years ago, and when I met
him again he was teacher at a small way-
back school. He invited me over next day
as the inspector would be around. Naturally
enough Seaham hadn’t made a great success
of teaching, and confessed it frankly. The
inspector was there all night. Jim put the
questions, and almost always every hand
wavered in eager expectation. In every
subject the class was proclaimed excellent,
and -after the examiner had departed I re-
marked on the smart set he’d got. “Oh,”
he said, “they’re not so bright. You see, I
promised the little beggars a tray all round
if they did as I told ’em.” “What’s that?”
1 asked. “Simple enough. Those who knew
the answers to put up the right hand ; those
who didn’t, the left.” He was promoted.

The barrow-men of Australia all felt like
Foches last week, They never had such a
victory since barrow-men were first born.
In Sydney no less than a hundred stands
were set apart for them, and Saturday,
January 31, saw them selling peaches at 18
for sixpence while the neighboring Dago
turned pink with the horror of it. And in
Melbourne Treasurer McPherson set out to
license 30 and give them stations, too.
Adelaide didn’t have to make the great
change. There the barrow-man has long-
supplied the city with the best fruit in Aus-
tralia at pyices that the Dago of the two
other great wens would call murder.
“M.G.R.”: Bill Wayback is versatile and
full of resource, all right. Hard up
against it, after being “adrift” for
six weeks, my cobber spent all but
a bob of his silver in purchasing a
cheap watch from an Israelite in
Petticoat-lane. A visit to an en-
graver, who inscribed a Fritz name
on the back, transformed the time-
piece into a decent souvenir. Then
the poor bush boy went to a pub
where he told a story of an unpaid
landlady in whose interests he would
sacrifice the watch he took from a
Hun he had bayoneted in a hand-to-
hand struggle. An onlooker eventu-
ally acquired the souvenir for £2.
It was so good a stunt that later
on the simple bushman peddled over
200 cheap watches at prices vary-
ing from 30s. to 40s. “But,” he
adds sadly, “I sacrificed a few for
as little as fifteen bob.”
“Hamer”: If natal influences are potent,
the most unfortunate child in Australia is
one that was born the other morning on a
Bankstown-Sydney train. The event hap-
pened suddenly, and the procession was held
up while assistance was secured for the
mother. The infant is doomed to travel on
workmen’s trains, and be eternally late; it
will find itself constantly whistling for others
to get out of its way, and stopping at places
which are not in the time-table; it will be
pestered all its life by people who want to
see its ticket and collect excess fares. In
addition to all this it will probably have
Bankstownline as one of its names. It is
a miserable thing to be born on any Sydney
suburban railway, but the Bankstown line
is one which any mother with a care for the
future of her offspring ought to have avoided.
“Motorist”; Ip Sydney, a congested city
of rather difficult streets, there will yet be
an uprising of drivers against the people
who block the roadways or leave children
or eat lunches on them, and there will be
a demand that in flagrant cases the person
ENTIRELY.
“Where are you going to live when you are married?”
“In Heaven for a while —and then it depends on hubby’s
behavior.”
who ia run down and not the runner-down
shall be run in. At a wide road junction on
any ordinary forenoon tne population may
include the following :
Six sets of tramcars on two sets of rails.
Sundry motor-cars and a number of assorted
vehicles.
Two rows of people waiting in the roadway for
trams. They always wait on the roadway.
Five or six groups of people—long-lost brothers
and the like—stopping to converse on the road-
way.
Six women and as many men getting into or out
of tramcars on the wrong side.
The person who has stopped in the middle of
the street to compare his watch with a big clock.
Also the tall, abstracted individual in a brown
suit who crosses reading the headlines about the
murder. The lady with six parcels and eight
children (she always brings the entire family with
her and sometimes borrows a kid or two from next
door). The eight newsboys who are all shouting
the same paper with the same murder, and the
unattached offspring who are supposed to be at
school but aren’t.
Also, the professional suicide who gets knocked
down by wealthy-loolcing cars and is willing to be
compensated without going to court. His business
isn’t so dangerous as it looks. A friendly pugilist
may invite you to lash out at his face whiie his
hands are hanging by his side, and by an almost
imperceptible movement his face is just an inch
too far back to be more than touched, no matter
how you lash. As the distracted driver pulls up
for all he is worth and the india-rubber profes-
sional “gives” a little, the human object who goes
flying into the road is more avaricious than hurt.
A policeman has been known to haul the same
intended victim off the road three times in an hour
without running him in. Possibly there is no law
to touch him.
The youth who is apparently proposing to a girl
on the tramline while the driver tries to dissipate
love’s young dream with the bell.
Dogs—of course.
Some day enthusiastic horticulturists will
try to grow flowers in the middle of a busy
crossing and the scene will be complete.
-* *• * *
Of the joys of running an organ:—
Following the morning papers, which the other day
put up their price to three-ha’pence, the Sydney
evening shrieks took the plunge and said three-
ha’pence, too; and Sydney needn’t be surprised if
the morning rags go on another ha’penny, as Mel-
bourne Herald has done for its Saturday issue. The
story is told that some of them are paying £B2
per ton for news-print—the sheets that ink often
spoils—and if that is from £lO to £l5 over the
average, at any rate the stuff is costing five er six
times more than it used to, and is almost unprocur-
able at that.
Before the W’ar supplies came from Europe (Scan-
dinavia mostly) and America in fairly equal quanti-
ties. Then Europe went off the market, and just
when there was an unheard-of scramble for paper
in America, mills eased up because there were other
and more urgent jobs for men to do. After the
war, with everybody in Europe with anything to
sell in a hurry to take advantage of a booming
market, there was a rush for paper of all sorts;
also nobody had any stocks worth mentioning, and
everybody wanted to get a bit in store. So there
was a descent upon American mills, which mostly
were still not working full time because they didn’t
have the raw material to work with; and Unc. Sam
started to bid so high for Canadian paper that
Canadian journals howled and the Government
stopped export. While this was happening somebody
or something pushed down the price of the English
pound in N’York until it was worth only about
14s. 2d. ; and that drove hungry European buyers
back to their own mills, and Australian buyers with
them. And as the only mills that count are those
of Scandinavia and Britain (the latter supplied
mostly with imported pulp), they are so snowed
under with orders that except in very rare cases
they won’t undertake to deliver within any given
time —it may be six months, it may be twelve.
So Australian papers are hoarding their supplies,
and when you take a half-crown advertisement to
the Herald you are to be handed back six-

pence and told that the thing must be put into a
line less; and if because of the rise in price Briggs
decides to buy only one paper instead of two, the
paper he doesn’t buy is liable to be more pleased
about it than the paper he gives an insufficient
three-ha’pence for.

PARTING SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world is wide, the skies are blue,
Each prospect beckons fair,
And you have me, and I have you,
And so....why should we care!
So sweet you are, fain would I stop
To speak your praise aright;
But soon I’ll lose your hand and drop
Far back into the night.
Then I shal? see you far ahead,
Beyond my reach and call,
Until (the thing that stirs my dread)
1 see you not at all.
And in that' dark I’ll mourn apart,
My glad days past with tears,
Indifferent to Love and Art
And all the flowering years.
But you, my dear, will bravely go
Straight down the happy way;
And every little while, I know,
YouTl think of me, and pray:
“Dear God, I cannot see him (let
Me hear his voice!) nor touch
His steady hand; and yet, and yet
He loved me, God, so much
“That surely you’ll forgive his sins
And keep him safe for me.
For love’s the blessed gift that wins
Right to the heart of Thee!”
So God will listen,- and maybe
Where in the shade I sit
As in a dream your face I’ll see,
Child, and rejoice at it.
Meanwhile, you gaily stroll along
And glad my closing day.
Hear how the world’s athrob with song,
As we go down the way.
Why should I vainly strive, or why
Should I weep fruitless tears,
Because between your youth and me
Lies all my weight of years.
One loves, one loses. Nothing new,
I’ve been through that before.
Again I lose. I’m fifty. You,
Sweetheart, are only four.
N.S.W.

A Goodyear Tube keeps
its air in close captivity
MOST motorists think that they are
carried by their tyres. They are not.
It is the volume of air imprisoned in each
tube which supports and carries the car.
When this is remembered it will be seen that a
Goodyear Tyre is really an ingenious contrivance for
retaining in captivity a definite measure of sup-
porting air.
And just so far as a tube maintains this exact volume of air
undiminished, and successfully resists the punishment sustained
from hard wear and road-shock, to that extent and no further
it has usefulness and efficiency.
Quite apart from the question of rupture of the tube through
injury, there are two ways in which air can escape—by
“diffusion” and by “chemical leakage ”
The laminated structure —the building up layer by layer—of
Goodyear Heavy Tourist Tubes effectively checks diffusion. The
proper preparation of the rubber for vulcanisation and the
Goodyear process of proper curing, produces the wonderful
elasticity that prevents chemical leakage.
Furthermore, the laminated structure, producing as it does a criss-cross
grain, limits the extent of a puncture to the actual wound inflicted.
Goodyear Heavy Tourist Tubes do not rip when punctured.

“Si-Si”: I don’t know how it may be out-
side Queensland ; but in that State it seems
to me beyond all question that we begin our
go-slow propaganda in the schools. Under
the pretext that education was growing
more strenuous, though it was nothing of
the sort, we have mawkishly cut and
whittled at the time spent by youths at
their studies, until we have reached a point
which is simply ridiculous. For more than
half of the rubbish which has been talked
on the subject the teachers themselves have
been responsible; and now they almost
believe that their work is so strenuous that
they couldn’t possibly do it more than five
days a week and for about 38 weeks in the
year. The effect on the youth is most seri-
ous. Till they leave school, throughout the
bulk of their most impressionable years,
they don’t, as a rule, know what hard
work is—many of them scarcely know what
work is. And what they learn most per-
fectly of all is that any excuse is good
enough for a holiday.
“Hamer”: While he was on leave the
Digger trained himself into the habit of
being a wealthy tourist, and now that he
is back home he has a strange tendency to
do his drinking in flash pubs. When I meet
some of the boys I knew over the other side
they usually suggest an adjournment to a
place of refreshment that is far distant but
has a reputation for style; and they go cold
when I tell them that there are handy pubs
where perfectly good beer can be got for
threepence. They are quite willing to return
to their old jobs as bricklayers or whatever
it may be ; but when they get into the seven-
guinea suits for which they have paid twelve
pounds twelve and go holidaying, the in-
clination to be flash comes back. "The folly
might have had some excuse when they were
moving amongst Europeans obsessed with an
idea that all Australians are millionaires;
but here it is merely a waste of good thrup-
pences.
ONE OF THE HORRORS OF PEACE.
“Say, Uncle, did anybody help (you to win
the war?”
Several months ago Melbourne Trades
Hall Council decided to urge the principle
of “one industry, one union,” the idea being
apparently designed as a sop to the minority
which favors the 0.8. U. plan for attaining
the Millennium. Since then practically noth-
ing has been done and it looks as though “t;ie
missus” is responsible. The missus sees
that, for instance, the mostly-unmarried
builders’-laborer is generally a more irrespon-
sible party than, say, the married carpenter,
and far readier to enter on a few weeks’
wageless inactivity. It has been suggested
as a compromise that the married man should
have two votes on strike business; but the
idea is far too radical for the miltant extrem-
ists of the Cause.
THE HERO'S
REWARD.
“Gorstrewth! Give us a smile, lady. T been
fightin' in France for you for four
years."
“W.H.8.”: I met my casual cove along-
side the town of Proyart. About the middle
of August, 1918, the 55th Battalion was in
support there, each platoon having dug itself
in on reaching the position early in the morn-
ing. When daylight arrived the dog-tired
men settled down to get some rest. But the
Hun soon spotted our newly-made home,
and commenced lobbing ’em. My cove was
snoring away at one end of the post, when
a 4.2 struck the parapet just above him,
came through about 3ft. of France, and fell
with a whack on his tin hat alongside his
head, where it was likely to explode any
instant. The falling dirt waking him up, he
coolly picked up the hot present, tossed it
over the parados, and saying, “Bit of a dud,
eh!” turned over and was snoring again
within five seconds.
* * * *
“O.Lf.”: Recent motor smashes in Mel-
bourne emphasise the fact that drivers’
licenses are issued far too readily. Some
years ago I visited the barrack-yard at Rus-
sell-street to “perform” for a motor-cycle
license. I was merely called on to drive
around the yard,' which I did “in second,”
no trial among traffic being demanded, nor
even a spin down the street. Things haven’t
changed much since then. The other day,
along the trafficless main road of my quiet
suburb, a car came walloping like a sozzled
citizen escaping from a midnight cray. The
driver was a young man I knew, and I
chaffed him about it later. He grinned and
pulled a paper out of his pocket. It was his
driver’s license awarded him on the morning
I saw his exhibition.
* * * *
“Bill o’ Costs”: A recent Bulletin par.
apropos the hiding alleged to have been
administered by Lord Somebody-or-other 4°
his spouse with a sjambok, and raising the
question whether the castigation might not
have been a fair thing, revives a memory of
Thomas Kennedy Pater, formerly Judge in
the N.T. and subsequently P.M. in Adelaide.
Pater was in appearance and manner a sort
of dyspeptic Mephistopheles, sallow, satur-
nine and cynical. The expression of his
leaden-yellow countenance seemed oidy to
vary between righteous anger and sneering
contempt. Nevertheless he detested violence
and cruelty, so that when a young lawyer
once found himself defending a wife-beater
before Pater the chances did not look
promising. As the story of the lambasting
of the wife unfolded itself (and it really
was a thorough hammering, from her toupee
to her toes), the satanic P.M.’s indignation
worked itself up to explosion point, and he
left no doubt of his opinion. The over-
energetic husband was looking forward to a
sentence of three months’ hard, when, by
the accident of luck, the beak’s wrathful
comments induced the wife to chip in, un-
invited, with her idea of the sort of punish-
ment that should be dealt out to the defen-
dant, a proceeding which quickly showed
her in the light of an atrocious nagger,
with whom domestic life must have been
plain hell. Pater let her have her head for
a while, his angry aspect slowly melting
into his habitual bilious-sardonic expression,
until he stopped the lady’s injudicious
eloquence in full tide. “Dismissed!” he
snapped. “You received only a little proper
marital correction.”
“S.S.”: It hap-
pened in Spencer-
street. An Italian
sailor was walking on
the footpath, carrying
on his shoulder a
monkey of the man-
drill family, and fol-
lowed by a string of
kiddies. Suddenly,
when passing a hotel,
the monk sprang from
his owner’s back,
hooked on to a sill,
swarmed up the hotel
front, and darted in
at an open window.
Almost simultaneously
a man darted out at
the second open win-
dow of the same room,
regardless of the fact
that he had about
13ft. to go to the
asphalt bel o w. A s
luck would have it he
struck a canvas
screen protecting a
ground-floor window,
and arrived on the
footpath uninjured.
Springing to his feet,
wild-eyed, and grey
with terror, he cried:
“He’s after me ! He’s
after me!” and fled.
T hen the landlord
came to the door, and
scolded the Italian
mariner. “Why aren’t
you more careful with
your d—d monkey?” he said. “This isn’t a
teetotal town, you oughter remember.”
* * * *
“Mimosa”: “Don Three” (B. 8/l/’2O)
tells the yarn about the Diggers who pinched
the mayor’s chain of office at a municipal
reception in Flanders after the Armistice.
I witnessed a more daring bit of souvenir-
ing than even that. On Christmas Day,
1914, I was close to the Esbckiah quarter,
Cairo. Amongst the various street per-
formers (jugglers, monkey and goat acts,
etc.) was an Indian with a cobra. After
Dost Mahomed had annoyed his serpent he
would stand off a few feet, bend toward him,
grab him and pop him safely into a bag. As
he was completing this finale of his turn an
impish Digger got in first, grabbed the cobra
by the neck and bolted across the square,
with Dost clawing the air behind him.
“Digger”: The Boche was singularly un-
fertile as an originator cf
engines of war, considering that
he has been thinking war and
has actually lived by the fruits
of war for centuries. The
battleship, the torpedo, the sub-
marine and the q.-f. gun—all
were taken over by him_ from
other nations. Lord Dundonald
invented poison-gas 20 years ago
and demonstrated its possibili-
ties to the War Office, though
neither he nor the W.O. dreamt
of employing it. The first Ger-
man aeroplane was the inven-
tion of an English marine en-
gineer named A. V. Roe. Fitted
with a stationary instead of a
rotary engine it became the ori-
ginal Hun battleplane. The
Frenchman Garros was flying a
Morane monoplane (“type Gar-
ros”) over Germany when the
petrol tank was hit and he had
to land. Its chief point was a
steel deflector which enables a
machine-gunner to shoot through
the propeller. The Germans
collared this idea and evolved
the Fokker. Finally the Eng-
lish produced the Handley-Page.
The first that ever left for
France was navigated by a staff-
officer. He lost his bearings
and the giant machine came
down in German Belgium. The Germans
were so pleased that they wirelessed
the War Office: “Handley-Page arrived
safely. Will be most useful.” On it were
modelled the machines which later bombed
London and the East Coast towns.
Observations of the office chaplain :
There is a cry from Macedonia, whose capital is
Melbourne, that young men are not offering for the
Anglican priesthood. The Bishop of Wangaratta says
they won’t “unless we pay them a living wage” ; and
the elderly saints reply that the young Australian
who feels called to the Church ought to be ashamed
of himself if financial considerations stop him. But
in nine cases out of 10 it isn’t that the young man
wants money for himself. The youngster who is
brought up closest to the church is also brought
up closest to the skirt; and his thoughts turn early
to matrimony. Moreover, his elders, knowing a
thing or two, encourage him to anchor himself”be-
side a young woman, with matrimonial intentions;
and from the point of view of filling the pulpits
that is their undoing. Our friends of the Roman
Communion are wiser: they catch the young man
younger, as a rule, and before his thoughts turn
lightly to love fill his mind with the idea of celibacy.
If the Anglicans are not prepared to pay a wage that
will allow their young parsons to marry, then they
will have to follow Mannix and catch their youths
before the girls get their hooks on them.
“Sam Periscope”: I was there when Bird-
wood got a slight knock from Jacko and
so appeared in the casualty lists. Our mob
(the 15th Battalion) was holding Quinn’s
Post at about 4 p.m. on May 14, 1915. Birdie,
followed by the long and well-groomed God-
ley and some red tabs, blew into our trench.
Birdie wanted to have a quiz through a
periscope. Our 0.C., a hefty scrapper
named Sampson, objected, as it was his hist.
The Turk had smashed four that day. But
Birdie insisted, and shoved up the bit of
glass. “Look out, sir, and don’t keep it
still for long,” said Sampson. “Crack!”
from Jacko, and away went glass and the
little man’s helmet. He never turned a
hair —just stooped down with hands to his
head, blood dripping through his fingers.
“Old Sam” helped the General out as far
as the C.T. and then came back cursing like
a bullocky. “I told him it was my last peri-
scope, and the crimson thing’s pone now,
curse it. And they’ll blame me for getting
him knocked.” And sure enough they did.

“Gint” : Queerest parcel from home I ran
across in Fjmnce was received by a chap in
the Ist Div. Sig. Co. It was a billy of eggs.
They were probably fresh when they left
Australia, but the hero who carried them to
the incinerator got a Military Medal.

As a working girl sees it: —
If Randolph Bedford would come down from the
roof he would find Australia waiting with these
objections to his solution of industrial sex rivalry
(B. 15/l/’2O) : (1) There is no such rivalry in
Australia. Under protection of the Great War,
industries have progressed by leaps and bounds,
and manufacturers, etc., are doing their level best
to bribe Maudie with morning and afternoon tea,
no Saturday work, high wages and holidays on full
pay, to come and work for them and not for the
other fellows. (2) Maudie often does fulfil that
part of her job which consists in being a nice girl
and marrying a nice man ; but there she signs off.
She doesn’t want to sit by her own fireside, nor
by anyone else’s, and she most emphatically does
not want the nice baby that Mr. Bedford sees
through his telescope. In fact, she will run a
race with Death rather than take charge of it.
Anyone with two ounces of wide-awakeness will
see more such cases in a week than shock the
Coroner in a year. (3) Sally, of England, on the

THE POINT ON VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sat behind a lady in becoming evening dress
v.And when I say “becoming’* I mean becoming less) :
Her face was quite averted, but I heard her laughter
gay,
And I counted all the little knobs that formed her
vertebra.
Her neck, discreetly covered by a rose-pink satin
skin,
Well camouflaged the tiny knobs that I delighted in;
Hut starting from the shoulder blades, with rare
artistic grace,
Her cuticle was draped to hold the larger knobs in
place.
“The play’s the thing!” the poet sang. Ah! how-
can that be true?
r ! he raising of the curtain hid a shapely back from
view;
And the villain falsely shouted, in a supercilious
tone,
That what all women needed was a vertebra; of bone.
1 sat beside the lady, on the curtain’s swift descent.
The subtle perfumes of the East with golden hair
were blent.
How ravishing her scarlet lips! When sparkling
eyes sought mine,
Forgotten were the little knobs that nestled on her
spine.

“C. Coral”: Apropos native fruits. Up
here in the Torres Strait we have some varieties that
make good eating. The wangi (or wangai), a big
tree with wide-spreading branches, produces a plum-
shaped fruit which is a
rich purple-red when ripe
and tastes something like
a loquat. The natives dry
it and it is then hardly
distinguishable from
prunes. Jt makes excel-
lent preserve or filling for
puddings. The wood of
the tree varies from light
to a rich red, similar to
jarrah: it work? up splen-
didly and takes a fine
polish. The tree is pro-
tected, however. Another
edible fruit is the mekair
or almond, flat, oval-
shaped, about two inches
long, with a red “meat - ’
surrounding the kernel.
The sorbey, red in color
also, isn’t at all bad. It’s
rather like a pomegranate
in flavor. There are also
other species rather like
pomegranates, but lemon-
flavored. Amongst the
natives the kowsar, which
produces a golden fruit
something like a pine-
apple, but made up of
wedge-shaped sections
which pull apart when
ripe, is in general favor.
It has to be caught just
at the right time to
appreciate it. The vegetable is of the pandanus
variety.
“Treefern”: The greenish bronze beetles
“Paul C.” reports from the cabbage-gums on the
North Coast have made their appearance in many
ither places in N. S. Wales. I lately saw myriads
of them feeding upon the gum-trees in the Bowral
district. The gaudy visitors are known as the
chafer or Christmas beetle. Their existence in this
world is brief —about three weeks. After the
honeymoon period the female deposits her eggs in
the dampest soil she can find, and then she and
her consort die.
“Melos”: Implacable enemies of our fresh-
water fish are the turtle, eel and water-rat. On
the North Coast
(N.S.W.) a day’s fish-
ing usually results in
what would have been
considered only an
hour’s haul a few
years back. Mainly
the turtle is respon-
sible. In the Murray
waters, too, shellback
threatens to extermi-
nate the cod. To check
its ravages it would be
advisable to encourage
the cormorant, which
destroys great numbers
of the pest in the in-
fant stage. Unfortu-
nately the cormorant
is on the black-list in
N.S.W. It was, too,
some time ago in South
Aus. on a charge of
destroying edible fish,
but it has since been granted a pardon on additional
evidence.

“U.P.”: That delightfully playful Aus-
tralian, Willie Wagtail, can be a ferocious mur-
derer when annoyed. The other day one of the
kids found William’s happy home with a nestful
of young, and one of the babies was removed for
the family’s inspection and then carefully replaced.
When Dad came back and found there had been a
human finger interfering with his household there
was h 1 to pay. He tore the nest into small
pieces, massacred the family of four, and if Mum
hadn t kept at a distance she might have met the
same fate. After this performance the bad old
bird got on the clothes-line and swore at the world
in shrill oratorio. Is this Willie’s habit if
his nest is disturbed, ox* was this a low-down repre-
t tati.e of the species who had been drinking?
* * * *
“Mulga”: At Jimbour, near Dalby IQ.),
a good many miles of the old Jimbour station boun-
dary fence is still in use. The posts are ironbark
and box and were erected in 1879.
“Dux” ; Henare tied his horse to the post
outside Julian’s billiard saloon and went in to take
a cue. Shortly afterwards the horse dropped dead.
When Henare was told of the fatality he exclaimed:
“Py corry, he te peggar, t’at horse. T’at te werry
first time he do t’at trick on me!”
‘‘Dido’: The station cook was complain-
ing about has black eye. He said it was wholly
supererogatory, his intentions having been of the
best. He was coming across from Goliath’s to Grass-
down, and the day was oppressive. He had taken
the turn in the road where it dips down to Morwong,
when he came suddenly upon a traveller lying near
the track by his own camp fire, fast asleep. A
spiral of smoke was curling up from the man’s
clothes where Ins pipe had set his coat afire, and
HE REMEMBERED HEARING SOME-
THING ABOUT HIM.
VISITOR: “Did you hear about young Smith
coming all the way from England to
Australia in an aeroplane?”
COCKY: “Young who?”
VISITOR: “Smith; S — M — I — T — H, Smith.”
COCKY: “No, I never ’eard nuthin’ about it.
But the name sounds a bit familiar.”
the flame spurted as cook approached. The latter,
looking around for some means of dousing the burn-
ing man, discovered a billy more than half full, and
dashed it over the blazing stranger. The latter
sat up, singed, but quite extinguished, and blinked
about him, taking in the situation. It took him a
minute or so to grasp what had happened; then
with a howl of fury he arose, and instead of offering
cook his heartfelt thanks he fell to with the obvious
intention of breaking him all up. The assailant
succeeded to a large extent, and cook limped on to
Morwong with the black eye above mentioned, intend-
ing to seek police intervention and the sympathy of
the township. To his amazement he found popular feel-
ing against him; Morwong’s sympathies were with
the accused. “Yes, you put him out all right,”
Cumming said, and Cumming was the constable;
“and p’raps you saved his life. But there’s extenu-
atin’ circumstances. That billy of stuff you threw
over him —do you know what it was? Why, damitall,
it was beer!”

“Jimsey” : One night when camped on
the Diamantina River I was awakened by a row
which sounded as if someone was belting the ground
with the flat of a shoyel. This was followed at
regular intervals by prolonged yells. I learned that
it was some blacks who were camped near me “rain-
making.” It is the custom among some tribes
round about the Diamantina when rain is ■wanted
(and the signs look promising) for several of the
oldest men to go at midnight to the grave of a dead
king, or noted warrior, or hunter. There they
perform some jealously-guarded rite, yelling and
walloping the grave with flat pieces of bark. Binghi
says the ceremony never fails to produce rain, but
to Binghi’s rules there are always many exceptions.
* * * *
“Kanuka”: “Sandy Mac” and his neigh-
bor, Jerry Twomey, have a very bitter feeling for
each other. About 5 o’clock one evening a boy
galloped up to Jerry and told him that his cow
Nancy had tumbled down a shaft about 10ft. deep
half a mile up Mac's gully. Suspicious at once,
Jerry said that “she must ha’ been ’unted and
dogged by Mac and fell in.” He lost no time in
finding the hole, and sure there was the
beast pretty well covered with mud and slush. Jerry
snared a couple of rabbiters to lend him a hand,
and by 8.30 the three had a windlass rigged. By
midnight Nancy was hauled to the Surface, wet,
cold and all out. So was Jerry. A fire was lighted
and the work of cleaning, warming and bringing her
to had just begun when Jerry’s missus came on the
scene with a billy of tea and a snack. Jerry, round-
ing on her, said: “Damn fine mess yous made, leavin’
them rails down, ’aven’t yer?” His missus, whose
eyes were fixed hard on the cow, said in a gentle
voice: “Dad, that ain’t our Nancy. That’s Sandy
Mac’s Rosie.” And then the storm burst.
“Wealsman”: In a pretty big English
paper I find some verses under the caption “The
Colonist at Home,” wherein the alleged “colonist”'
threatens to go “back to the bush.”
Where the ragged gum-trees gape and droop in a
silence like that of the tomb,
And the sun glares down relentlessly from cloudless
brazen skies....
Back to the land of the Southern Cross—to spinifex
she-oak and sand,
To the country of mellega scrub, the land of the
kangaroo,
To the land of the bluer and billy, the swagman’s,
the sundowner’s land,
Never again to forsake its shores and it 3 skies of
miraculous blue i
I m not particularly interested in the gum-trees
that gape in a sepulchral silence. Nor am I
violently gripped in the vitals by the poet’s feeling
references to sand and spinifex, bluevs, billies, sun-
downers, etc. These are all familiar properties
among the bush bards of Battersea. But the spelling
of old mulga is surely a newey. I have never met
it in that garb before—possibly because I have
always lived too close to the vegetable (in both
timber and wire form) to take proper notice. Per-
haps some other Abo.-liner knows the plant as “mel-
lega.” If so, in what particular locality? I would
hate to learn that our dear old “mulga” is all a
mistake. I would much rather believe that the Poet
of Poplar has confused the scrub with some other
undergrowth: the Pillaga Scrub, maybe.
“Scale”: How about this for the cham-
pion all-round one-armed man ? Left arm amputated
two inches above eßxrw-joint. Quarter-mile and 220
champion runner North of England 1906-07. Road
and track walks from one mile to 40 miles. Glebe
(Sydney) British Association footballer (Rawson
Club medallist). Plays Rugby or Australian rules,
hu y'7, cricket, foils, wrestling, swimming, and is a
first-class revolver shot. Wheel a barrow or fell a
tree; makes his own furniture; vocalist, actor, gar-
dener and black-and-white artist. All he does he
does well, using no hook or attachment excepting a
rope in wheeling the barrow. Professionally he is an
engineering draughtsman, and uses instruments
equally as well as his fellow-workmen.
“Jim Carew”: Years of observation have
convinced me that Binghi had a secret system of
telegraphy. When Sub-inspector Kaye was murdered
by myalls near the Woolgar goldfield, 30 years ago,
tame blacks on stations in the Richmond and
Marathon districts knew of the tragedy within 12
hours of the occurrence. Again, when Sub-inspector
Beresford and a black trooper were killed at Clon-
eurry a year or so later blacks well over one hundred
miles from the scene were promptly in possession
of the facts. Beresford was slain during the night,
and the distant abos. had the information before
daylight. The theory that the tribes communicate
by means of smoke signals appears to me to be
untenable. One of the most experienced officers in
the Queensland force firmly believes that Binghi
has the power of thought transference, but believes
it to be confined to a few individuals in each tribe.
* * * *
“Senex”: Re “Chev’s” par. (B. 11/12/’li))
which relates that a pal of his liked stewed octopus.
Once upon a time 1 was third mate of a Spanish
steamer trading from Bilbao across to Cuba,
and on one occasion our outward cargo con-
sisted chiefly of tinned fruit and fish. Among
the latter I noticed cases bearing a pic-
ture of a devil-fish. Curiosity getting the bet-
ter of my moral upbringing, I at last broached cargo
and opened a tin of the fish to see what it was
like. The contents were black, a horrible bluish
black, with bits of gristly stuff floating round in
the liquid. 1 couldn’t “come at it.” Somebody must
like it, though, for we carried over 20,000 cast's
of the beastly-looking tack to Havana in two voyages.
The rocky coast from Santander round past Vigo
swarms with octopus.
RUNNING ON AHEAD.
BOX: “I’m a plain man, and I say what I
think.”
VOX: “Yes, but you say it oftener.”
“Bad Australian”: I have seen hundreds
of lyre-birds’ nests, but none furnished with more
than one leaden-colored egg or a single fluffy-coated,
raucous-voiced chick. Occasionally I have found a
snake, a gohanna or a ’possum in the place where
the egg or chick ought to be. If anybody has had
better luck in his investigations let him lob in—
with an affidavit.

THE PINE MILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beside a clump of needlewoods we’ve set the little
mill;
The engine’s by the blue-clay tank an’ further up
the hill.
The blokes are in the pine-trees and the chips are
on the wing,
And in the fresh bush morning we can hear the
axes ring,
\ou see, the cocky wants a home—a solid house
built true;
The old log hut has served its time, its days are
nearly through.
’Twas right enough in times gone by and it would
do him still,
But someone’s girl has answered “Yes”—and so
we’ve brought the mill!
We’ve set the bench and “trued” the saw and let
her have a spin
(The bencliman eyes his pet with pride and pats
the packing in).
We’ve chocked the eight-horse engine’s wheels, we’ve
backed the water-cart,
And stacked a heap of short-length wood in readiness
to start.
We have no tearing “vertical,” we run no twin-
saws here,
No clanking winches, swinging cranes and wealth
of Yankee gear.
We have no collared office-staff, no multitude of men—
We’ve just a little pine mill and we number nine
or ten.
Tiie man who hauls the logs along, a brainy chap
is he.
Unto his team of bullocks he discourses fluently.
While Joe, who “spots” the bigger logs to take the
rollers neat
Without a sign of twist or wind —his work is hard
to beat!
W r e bark the logs and butt them square and roll
them up the skids.
The cocky chap’s impatient and he’s waiting with
the quids.
We grease the transports, oil the trucks, the bench-
man gives the sign,
The engine starts, the big belt flaps, the saw begins
to whine.
THE ULTIMATUM.
BUSY DOCTOR: “I’m too busy to attend to
all of you this eventing. Those who are
sure they're going to die to-night remain
behind; the rest go home."
The sun comes out a scorcher and the bullocks raise
the dust;
The waterbag gets covered and our throats begin to
rust;
B"t still the bark-heap grows apace while cant-
hooks slip and grab,
And logs lie on the cradle, which is just a long
pine slab.
The sawdust heaps up day by day, the scantling’s
piling high,
And weatherboards and! four-by-two’s are in a stack
close by.
The benchman is a tireless man who scorns to loaf
or “dwell”—
He keeps the log-men' busy and the tailer-out as well.
The hill is looking strange and bare, the bigger
trees are cut,
And through the gaps we catch a sight of someone
else’s hut.
The slope is scarred by dragging logs, the grass is
put to rout,
And now its just a few more days and we shall be
cut out.
Old Sam the cook has packed his pots, the tents
are down and rolled;
The bench is on the waggon and the engine fires
are cold.
The cocky now can build and wed; the pine-tree
clump is gone;
The good old sawmill and its crew are moving
further on.

THE MACHINE-OWNERS PRAISE
THE MACHINE THEY ENTHUSIASTICALLY URGE THEIR NEIGHBORS TO BUY!
she
The thing that is deciding so many woolgrowers to instal Cooper Shear-
ing Machinery is the overwhelming reputation they carry from those who
own them. When owners go out of their way to comment on the
surprising *'economy for so much service, as they are doing all over
Australia right along, the prospective buyer knows that there is some-
thing back of it. There is something back of it.
There is a lot back of it. The Cooper Air-cooled Handpiece is the nearest approach to perfection
the world has ever seen. Such is the verdict of Woolgrowers, Contractors and Shearers throughout
Australia—men who have spent their lives in the everyday use of Shearing machinery-men who
understand shearing machinery from A to Z. This result has been obtained after thirty years stupendous effort on he part of
our organisation throughout the world to produce a shearing machine of the greatest efficiency, that could be handled by any
amateur with a minimum effort—a machine that would give a maximum amount of service and a minimum cost of upkeep.
If you have sheep to shear you need a shearing plant. There is every reason in the world why it should be a “Cooper.” Write
us to-day for catalogue explaining these machines in detail, with price and full particulars of an outfit to suit your requirements.

“G.B.” : Has anyone heard of a fox kill-
ing a crow ? Stinker has the habit of burying his
kill, and personally or by proxy I’ve unearthed prac-
tically every bird from his larder except the crow.
Is the latter too shrewd for the fox, or is crowflesh
too tough for his digestion?
* * *
“Magnet”: Queensland isn’t the only
place where green scrub will burn. In the Tas-
manian West Coast highlands, where a weather
sample taken at random gives 60 wet days out of
two months and 10 wet months out of the 12, the
only dead trees are rotten, but the green ones,
except King Billy pine (resinless and coneless) and
sassafras, burn like tar-barrels. Leather-wood, tallow-
wood, manuka and horizontal all hiss and sizzle
and boil a while, but unfailingly end in making a
good fire. And for kindling no West Coaster worries
while there’s a (so-called) grass-tree about. Said
grass-tree isn’t a grass-tree; it’s a true palm, and
its underneath dead spears beat grocer’s kindlers
any day.
* * *
Gron” : The natives on the barren, mis-
nomered Cape Yerde Islands are about the most un-
conventional fishermen on earth. We watched them
from the transport as they got busy beside us. There
were a few very dead mackerel in the bottom of each
boat. The fishermen tore the heads off with (slow
music 1) their teeth. They then gave the bait a
perfunctory flick which sent part of the innards
overboard. Next they commenced to chew up what
was left. When it was thoroughly crunched up the
mess was expectorated into the sea. Suddenly the
water was a seething mass of mackerel just below
the surface. AVhile the fish were scrambling and
tussling over the burley, Black Brudder took an
ordinary cask-hoop across which was stretched a net
and leisurely scooped fish into his boat. Each
scoop landed them in dozens. The detached air of
boredom with which Jack Johnson’s cousins carried
on the good work sufficed to convince us that there
was nothing unusual about it.
ON THE LAND.
“Have you seen much of my brother Fred
since he went up your way?"
“Quite a lot. Last week he came over to
inspect our artesian bores."
“Oh, he’s nuts on pigs. I bet he wanted to
closs ’em with his Berkshires!"
“Azac” : A very effective waterproof sheet
can be made from unbleached calico or canvas duck
by dipping the material into paraffin, painting what-
ever color is desired, and then leaving it to dry. It
will not harden or stick, as ordinary tarpaulin has
a habit of doing.
McNorth ’: It’s hard to wean Binghi of
his habit of sleeping on the ground. Once, up at
Cape York, when there was a sudden wave of sick-
ness, I had bunks set up in the sleeping quarters of
the black brethren in my employ. I issued strict
orders that the bunks were to be used from then
on and drew an exaggerated picture of the ills' that
come to those who doss on the ground. The first
morning a deputation consisting of four gins, three
youngsters and a pair of naked savages with matted
THE RETORT COURTEOUS.
CRITIC: “Well, I’ll say this—if that’s Art I’m an ass.”
A RTIST: “Oh, that’s art right enough.”
hair ancl sleepy eyes waited on me. They explained
that the bunks were no good at all. Everybody
had fallen out, some to collect large bumps on their
heads, and one had been bitten by a sleeping dog
on top of which he had fallen. It was explained
that people accustomed to sleeping on the ground
were careless of how they rolled about —they couldn't
fall off the earth —but the habit in a bunk was
dangerous. What with the continual falling over-
board of masses of black brudder and the surprised
howls of dogs that had been curled beside the bunks
there had been little sleep for anyone. 1 then had
sides built to the bunks. For a time it worked right
enough, but one by one the simple children of
nature went out an to the beach to sleep on the
warm sand beneath the stars. Which was probably
the more healthful way, after all.
“Bright”: “H. Church” (B. 15/l/’2O)
wants to know the name and secret history of the
insect that kills the cicada or locust. The gentleman
is the digger-wasp, who, slaughters the noisy insect
to provide food for its young. Selecting a bank
where the earth is dry, the digger drives
a shaft in from four to six inches almost
horizontally, but with a slight downward
slope. The shaft then makes a sudden
turn and continues vertically for about
the same distance, ending in a round
chamber with a diameter of from 1-Mn.
to 2in. Sometimes there are branches to
the main shaft each ending in a cell.
Each cell has to be provisioned before
the wasp lays her egg in it. Having
completed the shaft the wasp sets out
to procure the tucker. When the victim
has been picked out he is first paralysed
and then dragged to the store —no mean
feat, seeing that the cicada is about twice
the size of the wasp. When the
cicada has been placed in one of the
chambers the female wasp completes the
job by laying her egg on the underneath
portion of the victim. The egg takes
only two or three days to hatch. When
the grub emerges he is broader at the
stern than he is at the head, which is
very small. This point is thrust between
the joints in the cicada’s body and all
its substance is absorbed by the young
digger-wasp. It takes a little more than
a week for the cicada to become grub.
The latter then spends a couple of days
making a cocoon of silk and earth. Early
autumn is the time that the cocoon is
spun, but the change of the grub to the
chrysalis does not take place until the
spring, when the finished digger-wasp
makes his appearance.
“Yarrurn”: There is only one big differ-
ence between a wallaby and a kangaroo; but how
many Australians know it? One is covered with
hair and the other with fur. Now, which is the
hairy one ?
* * * *
“H.F.W.”; The habit some horses have
of plunging out of shafts when being unharnessed
is generally acquired through the common practice
of giving them a smack on the rump or otherwise
startling them as a send-off from the shafts. A good
way of breaking prads of their fault is to tie them
to a fence, or anything else they can’t get past, and
then gently roll the vehicle back. After a week or
two the animal is generally cured.
“Bad Australian”: If “Sassafras” (B.
1/1/ 20) puts his shekels on the Australian horse
“for staunchness, hardiness and utility every time”
he is liable to lose once, anyhow. The average
Chilian-bred saddle-horse is far ahead of the Aus-
tralian animal. He is reared on mountainous countrv
under a temperature ranging from 80 to 85 deg. F.
down to lOdeg. F., is hardy and sure-footed as a
goat, and doesn’t know when he is licked. He is
cobby, inclining to junkiness, but very active and
handy, and although at first glance he looks like a
pony, the tape soon proves that he is a horse at
every point. He doesn’t know what oats are; but
fresh off the grass he will carry -you and your swag
blithely from dawn until dusk. He is bred thus:
A blood mare is mated with a percheron. The fillies
from this cross are sent to a blood horse or an
Arab, and the result is the cavallo chileno, the
most sought after animal in South America. The
type used is a medium-sized, compact, active draught-
horse, with fine, clean action, very much like the
better class lorry horses in Australia. The Argen-
tine horse is just the opposite to the Chilian. Little
or no care is taken in his breeding, and he is
raised on the pampa. He is as often as not a slab-
sided, ewe-necked, banjo-headed, loosely-coupled
brute with feet like soup plates. Twenty-five years
ago almost every Australian horse was a good horse;
to-day it is a rare thing to meet one of the old
type of hack or stock horse, a type that whatever
else it may have lacked always showed blood and
substance. The reason for the charge may be found
in the indiscriminate mating of almost any kind of
“are. with five-furlong rats and Yankee trotters or
with the so-called English hackney or, roadster, whose
get is at best a poor-spirited coach horse. It is
time Australia got back to the big-boned, compactly-
built blood horse and Irish hunter and a sense cf
disci imination in the selection of mares as well
as horses.

“Budgerygar” : Money in kangaroo skins?
Well, a hunter at Adavale (Q.) got 200 in 11 days.
His cheque was £132 10s., after paying commission
and freight. What’s wrong with that?
“Merrigal” : I thought Spcn. Bowen, of
Bowen Park (N.S.W.), was pulling my leg when
he related that four red-gum stockyard uprights put
in at brother Hill’s adjoining old ranch, Gillawarrina,
by William Lawson’s fencers in the ’forties, were
recently found after exhumation good enough to
occupy the corner positions in his newest milking
yard. But he was telling the truth. He further
opened my eyes by asseverating that yarran posts
wear better in foreign than in their native soil.
Incidentally, yarran foliage isn't good tucker, though
cattle will munch it when the myall and rosewood
aie eaten out; but it sometimes brings on trouble.
A Trangie man lost seven head of over-hungry stores
in an afternoon by glutting them with the foliage
from a single tree and allowing them too much
drink just afterwards. Felling instead of lopping
the vegetable in successive droughts has been a bad
error. Settlers would do well to follow the lead of
Buttabone and Bundemar, whereon myall plantations
have long been fostered; also the example of Thomas
Bragg, of Mungeribar, who has an extensive kurra-
jong nursery flourishing on the flattest ground, though
ridgy country is their favored location.
“Arthur R.”: Suicide was O’Brien’s hobby.
Twice in one day Myrphy fished him from the river;
but on seeing him tie himself by the neck to a
beam in the stable, Murphy took no notice. When
the body was cut down Murphy was paralysed.
“B’gob,” he exclaimed, “I thought he’d hung him-
self up to dry.”
“S.D.”: Binghi wasn’t a cannibal all the
time. When the body of “Boney,” king of the Fraser
Island blacks, had been recovered from the Mary
River, 50 years ago, his relatives (about 200)
skinned, dissected and roasted the body in order that
his bones might be distributed among them. No
portion of the body was consumed.
“Cape Pork”: No good “Friday Island”
scoffing at the suggestion that the fruit of the wild
quinine is a cure for beri-beri, for I can vouch for
the fact that it cured an outbreak west of the
Palmer five years or a little less ago among both
whites and blacks. I don’t say that regular medical
treatment is not preferable, but there are places
where medical aid is weeks away. The spot I have
quoted was one of them.
“Seymour” : I’ve lost track of Dan Has-
sett, but he mas a champion whip-cracker. It's
a game that never “caught on” much; still there’s
fine art in it. “Saltbush Bill” was the best I ever
heard with the whip, and was Dan’s tutor. It’s
hard to say which was the better.
* * * *
“Yaeko”: A word to “Buttinhere” (B.
l/l/’2O), who states that sheep’s wool falls off at
the end of 12 months. Go and examine the strand
of wool 4ft. 2in. long at the Exchange Hotel,
Adelaide. It grew on a merino which ran at Karatta
station, Kangaroo Island, from lamb to full-mouth.
“Pongo”: Rat-catching with a hook and
line is useful and exciting sport. When a kid on
the Parramatta ltiver 1 used to land giant water-
rats where George Towns now has his boatshed. A
bream-line and a smallish hook baited with old
cheese was used, and after some three months’ fishing
it was possible to rear chickens in the immediate
locality.
* * * *
“Senex”: Keep shy of “45’s” advice iB.
18/12/’l9), and don’t use a steel hammer with
wedges. The chips do fly, and dangerously. About
six months ago a boy giving a hand to a timber-
cutter at Malanda (Q.) was killed by a splinter
nicking his jugular. The lad bled to death inside
10 minutes. “45” can obtain confirmation of this
on application to the Atherton District Hospital.
“McNorth”: It’s not often that bad
Weather lasts long in Torres Strait, but on one
occasion persistent nor’-westers threatened our
larder. The supply-boat from Thursday Island was
held up, and cartridges being short there was no
way of getting scrub-turkeys, pigeons or other
game. There were mobs of fish in the sea, but the
water was too rough for netting in the orthodox
manner, and too clouded by freshes from the creeks
for line work. So we evolved a new scheme. At low
water a stake was planted firmly in the sand near
the tide mark 'and a couple more, 30 or 40 yards
apart, out acriWss the half-dry flats. Then a 50-
fathom fishing net was stretched between the stakes
We let the night tide come in a*»d sweep over the
net and when it had ebbed we examined the catch.
There were cat-fish galore, silver mullet by the
hundred, innumerable whiting, johnny dories, spotted
tails and young sharks. There were crayfish and
crabs without end. We obtained sufficient fish to
last a couple of weeks, and for the rest of the day
all hands were busy salting and making ready for
the smokehouse. But it cost the price of a good
net, for umpteen sharks had passed clean through,
taking yards of mesh with them, a crocodile or two
had bitten and slashed several passages, and the
crabs had nipped through scores of strands.
SHE KNEW HIM.
G ROANS: “I’ve just proposed to Miss
Bunions."
B ONES: “I suppose you said you were not
worthy of her, as usual?"
G ROANS: “No, she got it in first."
“Pick”: We had finished up the night
after the Adaminaby races at the over-crowded pub
by stowing away the 6ft. llin. of Jack Harvey, our
shout” champion, in a 6ft. verandah-end room. In
the morning his long bare shanks were extended
through the low open window with a somnolent
turkey gobbler roosting on one lank shin-bone and
the missus preening herself on the Other. The pub
had hysterics!
THE BULLOCKY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The swearing old bullocky comes up the road
ith a crack of his whip and a creak of the load;
And the sleepy red bullocks pull in and pull out
a »hoa-gee-back,” and the lift of a shout;
TwV C , n ° W by the stoop in the round of his back
that hes not very far from the last little track.
The lonely old bullocky halts for the night
4 ’th ?■ damper to make by the stars dipping white;
And the bells on the leaders ring high and ring low
V bile the lazy green breeze seems forgetting to
blow;
And he whistles a lone, little bullocky air
Ol the coolabah bushes and billabo'hgs bare.
The slender young moon in a mantle of gold
O’er his weary old face trips a rigadoon bold,
As the chains of the hobbles chink here and chink
there
Like freedom with fetters of custom to wear ;
And she knows by the smile in the twist of his
mouth
That he dreams of his mates in the tents of the.
South.

(so-ca lled) The abominable goods trucks
nnu bC shak . mg tke life out of the wounded
, endangering the doctors in charge, who
nad to clamber from one beastly truck to
wkl , le tlle train was in motion. But
gradually the vehicles were hammered into
■+p e j corridor cars were added which per-
mitted nurses to be carried, and order began
to appear out of chaos.
When the Huns became the pursued in-
stead of the pursuers they abandoned their
wounded wholesale, and left most of them
untended on the field of battle, bearers and
doctors having fled with the retreating
armies. One has been led to believe that
few miscalculations were made for the forth-
coming struggle by the Hun High Command,
but facility of transport for the wounded was
one of them—they possessed no motor-ambu-
lances to start with any more than we did.
1 here is not much about the treatment of
disease in this volume; that was to come
when I landers mud was reached, and no
doubt it will be detailed in Vol. 2. Tetanus
"as met with early, but as soon as anti-
tetanic .serum could be manufactured or
obtained in sufficiently large quantities the
disease vanished. Every wounded man
were the wound ever so trivial, was given
a dose of serum. Typhoid was encountered,
but the disease was immediately pounced
upon by the sanitary people, all estami-
nets which had been selling contaminated
beer were placed on the retired list, and, by
this means, and the careful segregation of
the cases, and, above all, by -anti-typhoid
inoculation, the disease never became epi-
demic, a result that was of incalculable ser-
vice to the fighting machine. Gas gangrene
was a horror of months, but eventually this
terrible scourge, too, was eradicated by the
genius of the American Alexis Carrel.
The book is published by Constables. Our

Short Stories, Ours and Others
Recently the Red Page printed a discus-
sion on the merits of the short story as
known in America and Australia. The
American short story is not; but it once
was, and, comparatively, the English short
story never was. The English short story
of now is mere slush, and the English
humorous short story is in the bulk the ex-
pectable result of accepting that mere
mechanic, W. W. Jacobs, as a model. But
up to the time of the war there was hope
in the American magazine. Good strong
yarns, without sufficient of what the actah
managah calls “heart interest” to make them
sloppy, gave the Philadelphia Evening
Post, for instance, its vogue in Australia—
a vogue that its present contributions to
literature will assuredly destroy. And
while the Evening Post has deteriorated to
long-drawn-out dulness, the higher-priced
and mostly pretentious American magazine
has descended to Slush’s Seventh Hell. A
typical sinner is the Red Book, a 20-cent
magazine in America and sold at 30 cents
in Australia by the grace of the tripe-
importers, who should be hit by a tariff and
a re-enactment and extension of the Keating
copyright to give Australian authorship a
chance.
As a sample read a story entitled “Tim
One Before the Last,” by Fanny Heaslip
Lee. These are some of Fanny’s ways of
being clever: —
The roses looked like amorous cabbages. She
regarded the tasteless masses of herbage about the
room.
Mrs. Dunn came into the room with a ryriUpV
silk petticoats, bearing a holiday
violets, and Marion’s same perfunctory
widened and amplified into a sort of
seeing of the universe.
She met Robert’s fingers deliberately for the
wing-brush of a second.
Nina’s seraph eyes were on her plate, her fingers
shakingly busy with a fold of her napkin.
His smile even in the dark was a most human
and engaging thing.
The darkness swirled about them like a living
thing.
I know of no more irritating stuff than
this—the air of tremendous cleverness in
the misuse of words, which are honorable
tools of trade and to be treated with proper
courtesy. But added to that the thing isn’t
a story, and 75 per cent, of the efforts that
call themselves stories are merely inconse-
quential sketches without beginning, mean-
ing or end ; whereas a real story is of three
factors—statement, development, denoue-
ment. The American story is becoming the
“story” of the English magazine—a floun-
dering, aimless thing that never gets any-
where. Still, it is poor consolation to the
writer of the real story that never wastes
a word and regards directness as the first
literary quality to be in receipt of shillings
where the malefactors of these splayfooted
incoherences that cover 10,000 words are
paid dollars for their incompetence.
Of course I’m not saying that bad stuff
hasn’t naturally a public; but while there
is so much of it that reprehensible public
has little chance of growing smaller.
Maurice Hewlett, excellent artist, cannot
find the public that waits for the Barries
and the Jack Londons—mere ticklers of
time and a cult. The public demands tick-
ling in its latest scratching place, though
that doesn’t make literature of the jour-
nalistic tickling; but that can’t alter' the
man who can realise his own literary iden-
tity even if his expression be faulty. Yet,
again, poor conjrtfttion to the r§al writer
that Charles GaffliMe can beat “The Cloister
and the Hearth” for editions and Hall Caine
can make Maurice Hewlett’s royalties look
like threepence.

A Satchel of Books
The Taming of Nan, by Ethel Holdsworth
(Herbert Jenkins, London). Bill works on
the railways in a Yorkshire mill town for
a pound a week. His wife has cave instinct
and longs for a good hiding. At last she
gets it, and then she sweeps her husband
out with salt. Bill comes home without any
legs, and has to be nursed on the reduced
income of ten shillings a week. Told rather
forcefully, but Nan doesn’t seem much tamer
when all is told.
The Death of Man, by R. C. Trevelyan
(George Allen and Unwin, London). This
is a book of alleged verse which is mostly
disjointed prose. In one or two shorter
pieces the author writes in an orthodox man-
ner and achieves mediocrity. There are ideas
here and there in the volume that possess
some strength and freshness, but it is hardly
worth wading through the mass of half-
rhythms and whole discords to find them.
The Glorious Thing, by Christine Or
(Hodder and Stoughton). David Grant, in-
valided home from the war.' finds the
“glorious thing” by the aid of Marion
Sutherland, but none of the glocy seems to
spill over into the telling of the common-
place yarn. Jennie, David’s old Scotch
servant, is drawn with some skill, and Min-
nie is rather pleasing; but two women, un-
aided, cannot leaven the wEole dull mass.
The Woman’s Footprint, by E. R. Pun-
shon (Ilodder and Stoughton). Here’s ad-
venture for you in large doses and with all
the necessary thrill. Three cattle-traders
come across the footprint of a woman with
a shoe near a village sacked by Arabs in
Central Africa. They start in pursuit of
beauty in d i s-
tress, and come
up with her
and some other
European pr i-
soners, when
they are cap-
tured by the
Arabs. Moham-
med-el-Iv e b i r
has dreams of
an African em-
pire and is mar-
ried to a girl
fr o m an Eng-
1i s h fish-shop,
for wh o m h e
has built a
modern villa in

a 11 necessary

PUNCH.
Danger Signals for Teachers, by A F
Winship (Forbes, Chicago). “Teaching
must be attractive in salaries,” says this
American doctor of laws in a long, loosely-
wntten harangue to the American teachers
it is. his one thrilling remark. The book
may inspire those for whom it is written as
its publishers claim that it will, but it wfl!
leave the Australian teacher cold.
His Secretary, by Bernard Gilbert (Her-
bert Jenkins, London). A well-told yarn
with some humor that will make its chief
appeal to those in England who were behind
the scenes in war _ work. Sophie is “his
secretary,’! and he is sorhebody who gets a
knighthood. There are other pretty girls.
A love-making seene during an air-raid is
about the centre of events. Afterwards the
discarded Sophie writes to the new knight
and tells him her poet-lover will break his
neck if he follows her. The book seems to
imply that girl labor in the higher Govern-
ment service wasn’t exactly the cause of
sky-scraping moral ascents by the patriotic
heads who stayed at home.
The Secret of the Shining Mountain, by
Eric Wood. The Bulletin has only one
complaint about this story, and that is that
it wasn’t itself with the two boys and “the
whitest man who ever held a gun” in the
jungle of Africa, where the pygmies spread
themselves instead of making a contract
with Hugh Mclntosh to appear on the Tivoli
circuit as a foil to the ten most beautiful
girls. But it’s a good book —a pleasurable
book. (Cassell and Co.)
The Inky Way
“Fandango”: Are there any profiteers in
the bookselling business? I am told that the
amusing reminiscences of breezy old Admiral
Fisher are supplied to the trade here at
13s. fid. A combination which includes most
of the bookshops in Melbourne has decided,
as there is a chance to do “a deal” in this
book, to demand from the patient public 28s.
for it. Over 100 per cent, for a work there
is sure to be a cry for !
“Karim Khan”: The first time I saw war-
correspondent Martin Donohue was when he
came to us officially at Bijar (North-West
Persia) in 1918 to help us unravel the
mysteries that then surrounded us. lie
spoke French and Russian fluently, rode well
for a heavy man, and exuded an air of kind-
liness that soon made friends of us all. His
experience in Persia was considerable, and
the book he is writing should be full of
novelty and diversion.
“T. 0.1.” : There are three interesting issues
of a Sydney paper for collectors to hunt for.
The Globe, founded by W. H. L. Bailey,
and subsequently taken over by Gresley
Lukin, first appeared in November, 1885.
The last regular issue was published on
Saturday, June 18.1887. But presumably be-
cause there was still some faint hope of sav-
ing it, it came out on the following Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday, though only as a
single-column galley-proof, with two items of
news and the imprint, the strip measuring
eight inches by five.
There seems to be a literary Fairfax at
last. A youngster of the fourth generation
—one of the family that settled in England
—has been writing verses, mostly transla-
tions, for some time ; and the S. M. Herald
reviews a book, “Carmina Rapta,” appa-
rently by this young man. A “sonnet” is
quoted, but something has gone wrong some-
where, for it has only 13 lines.
“Hugh Veteran”: That night Alfred Dea-
kin spoke with baffling fluency. In the
course of his speech the word “dichotomise”
jumped out. One of the reporters, who had
never before met the word, saw Alfred out-
side after, and asked him what the darned
thing meant. Deakin laughed. “Did I really
use that dreadful word? Suppose we say
‘bisect’?”

Le Penseur (The Thinker) by Auguste Rodin.
In front of the Pantheon Paris.
"There’s all the future left untouched”
Back in the dark days of war, faced with overwhelming problems, the Diggers, with wonder-
ul optimism, were often heard to say, "Well, anyhow, there’s all the future left untouched.”
Here at home, faced only with the problem of our indi-
vidual future, the overwhelming cry goes up against "the
price of things,” yet, withal, the waste goes on !
The things of life, so hard to get, so costly to re-
place, are cast aside with careless ease. The engi-
neer throws out broken metal parts—-the motorist,
too. The farmer buys new ploughs, the housewife
discards the broken kitchen pot and sighs at the
cost of a new one. The manufacturer of metal
goods plods on with old fashioned methods, pro-
ducing one article when he could with ease produce
ten articles of better quality in the same time by using
The Oxy-
Acetylene
Welding
Bio wpipe.
All of this waste can stop at once and economy be the
order of the day. Let the Oxy-Acetylene Welding
Process help you ! Metal parts of any size, broken
tools, or metal utensils composed of cast or wrought
iron, mild steel, brass, copper, aluminium, or zx\-
metal; all of these can be repaired in a fraction of the
time, for a fraction of the cost of doing the job by any
other means. Oxy-Acetylene Welders stand waiting at
hundreds of points all over Australia ready to save you
money. Make this year your starting point for real
economy. "There’s all the future left untouched.”

Grandfather’s
Day
Our forefathers were excellent judges of what was good for
them —a remedy became famous because it cured the complaint it
was intended to cure. So fame came to the firm of manufacturing
chemists who, at their works in Lancashire in England, prepared
a successful remedy for Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago and Sciatica.
People in those days did not take long journeys to foreign
watering-places when they were ill—they took the “ Kruschen
course in their own homes, and got well all the sooner in conse-
quence. Kruschen Salts is invaluable in all cases of Constipation,
and in Liver and Kidney disorders generally. To get fit there
is nothing like Kruschen Salts—it gives an abounding sense of
vigour and vitality that is in keeping with the spirit of the day.

“Dial Sight” : A country pub monarch had
a neat one put on to him recently. A casual-
looking cove, showing tendencies to a *juiet
jag, floated into the bar. After spending a
few bob he worded the boss confidentially
and asked him to mind an envelope which he
said contained a five-pound note. He re-
marked that, as he might be getting a bit
lit up, he wanted to have something to move
on with. After a couple of days Bung lent
him 10s., and next day a pound. Then Bung
noticed the absence of his depositor, and de-
cided to investigate the parcel. Steaming
open the envelope he found it contained a
couple of his own beer labels.
“T. Bower”: When the bootmaker says
the repairs will cost six and six, run to the
nearest paint-shop and buy a tin of hard
oak varnish. Apply to soles and heels, which
will devour the tonic; give a second helping
and allow to dry hard in the sun. The var-
nish hardens the leather, makes an ideal
walking surface, and if the process is re-
peated every now and then the hide will
last a year’s continuous wear. Moreover,
the varnish makes a waterproof leather, and
is superior to applications of oil. To reduce
the repair bill I have tried rubber soles, but,
while their life is long, they are heavy and
easily cut. Mineralised leather lasts for
ever, but absorbs water like a sponge. A
fortune awaits the man who patents an
acid-proof sole. In a place like the Common-
wealth Acetate Factory on the Brisbane
River a workman will “do in” a pair of
boots in six weeks.

“McNorth” : I got a letter from a Chicago
tanning firm asking for crocodile skins.
The foreigners did not mention prices, ex-
plaining that they could not quote without
seeing samples, but, judging from the
amounts charged for the article made up
into fancy trifles, I thought there might be
something in it. I was in the Gulf ot
Papua, where every creek and river
abounded with crocs., so I secured every
sample possible. Crocs, are not too easy
to shoot, their iron-like hides deflecting
almost any but a right-angled shot, and ob-
taining and skinning the corpse is a job that
calls for much blasphemy. To tear the over-
coat off a single specimen is a half-day job
for three men. However, I secured 10 good
skins, cured them with sand and ashes and
exposure to the sun, and sent them to
Chicago. The prices paid by the tanners did
not cover even the freight.
* * * *
“Senex”: Recent Bulletin mention of a
Dutch shipping venture from Australia to the
West Coast of South America brings me out
of the chart-room. A few years ago I was mate
of a big tramp humping coal from Newcastle
to Valparaiso—nine voyages running. Seek-
ing to supplement my magnificent salary of
£lO a month, I thought of Australian wine,
and took two dozen cases of cheap port as a
trial. Got them here for about 16s. a case.
Sold ’em in Valpo. at 25 dollars (the Chili
peso is about Is. 2d.), and they went like hot
cakes at that price. Next voyage I had
four dozen cases —all I could find stowage-
room for without exciting comment —and
charged 28 dollars. I could nave got rid
of a shipload at that figure. What’s wrong
with beating Dago stuff off the Chilean
market with our bottled sunlight now _ that
the foreigner provides us with carriage?
P.S. —What’s wrong with getting our own
carriage as well?
* * * *
“R. 8.”: Who wants to know why food
prices are high? To this land of plenty the
old-world stress has been imported by the
habit of looking to the oversea markets while
neglecting the best market of all —the
market that is in Australia. Mutton is dear
in Australia largely because Victoria, like
other places, shipped nearly three million
carcases of lamb and mutton in the six
months from July, 1919, to Jan., 1920. Aus-
tralian ham costs the Australian 2s. per lb.,
partly because one pig factory has an order
for 30,000 hams for Manila. Pineapples are
skied in price for similar reason. Even
the canned Christmas pudding didn’t escape.
In Melbourne one operator bought them up
ahead for export. Similarly with boots.
Hughes permitted £750.000 worth of leather
to go to America, and Australians are forced
to import hides from Maoriland. The Beef
Trust stores on Brisbane River, I am told,
are stuffed with hides waiting transport to
the U.S. A real statesman would .stop the
export until Australian requirements had
been filled at a fair rate. The procedure that
helps high prices in Australia is the legacy
of the fatheaded Freetrade that blithers of
“the open market” while its own people
starve.
TO MY LANDLORD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A cheerful man, I note your smiles
When calling on your weekly mission.
By walking many happy miles
You still maintain your good condition.
Here gathering up with legal stress
Your doles of gold from gate to gate,
Accumulating heaviness
You pleasantly keep down your weight.
I too would be a slender cit
Could only I such training get,
And keep myself extremely fit
By making other fellows sweat.
No cute collector I have known.
Pursuing ticks in fields and fens,
Has half the zest that you have shown
In adding to your specimens.
A neat and slender waist have you,
Your wind is good—it never fails.
Here’s proof what exercise will do —
At sixty you are hard as nails!

Dodge Brothers
MOTOR CAR
Because people think well of these cars, it is still im-
possible for Dodge Brothers to build enough of them.
Seldom has there been a finer example of the force
of friendly thoughts.
It is an inspiration and an encouragement to build
well—because the reward is so great and so sure.
With nothing but goodwill toward them—how
could Dodge Brothers do less than they have done?
Nothing has checked or hindered, for so much as a
single week, the continued bestowal of this recog-
nition and reward.
The eagerness to own the car is greater to-day than
it ever has been.
As a result the works in which the car is built are
steadily spreading and expanding.
The petrol consumption is unusually low.
The tyre mileage is unusually high.

Motor Show.
AN ATTRACTIVE
EXHIBIT.
The Standardised Motors, Limited, are
certainly to be commended for their artistic
display on Stand No. 20 at the recent
Motor Show held in Sydney under the
auspices of the New South Wales Motor
Traders’ Association. .
To assure the Public securing a good
view of their models they arranged for a
large amount of floor space, on which was
displayed a stripped Chassis, an Imported
Touring Model embodying many attractive
features, whilst the third Model was fitted
with an Australian Touring Body with nickel
fittings and trimmed and finished in an
attractive shade of grey.
The floor coverings and other furnishings
on the stand were all carried out to a set
color scheme, which together with the
machines exhibited made for an exception-
ally happy result.
The Standardised Motors, Limited, are
very keen on carrying out Messrs. Dodge
Brothers’ Policy in respect to Standardisa-
tion, whilst their Sales Policy follows closely
along the lines recommended by their prin-
cipals.
With respect to Body Work —Arrange-
ments have been made for Australian Bodies
designed not only for appearance but for
comfort. These bodies are all standardised,
and are trimmed with Grey leather and
painted and finished with an attractive shade
of the same color. Buyers also have the
choice of body work turned out in America,
and recent examples just to hand would
indicate that a number of important im-
provements have been made principally in
the matter of trimming and in the width and
depth of the seats.
The Standardised Motors. Limited, were
only appointed Dealers for Dodge Brothers
Motor Cars in August last, but we gather
from Mr. Kloster. the Managing Director,
that their efforts to date have met with ex-
ceptionally satisfactory results. Their
activities in connection with sales have been
amply supported by Messrs. Dodge Brothers
in shipments from the factory, with the re-
sult that comparatively early delivery can
be quoted.
The new Dealers are determined to give
satisfaction to buyers of Dodge Brothers
Cars, not only in the way the cars' are
turned out for delivery, but in subsequent
attention to buyers. In the latter connec-
tion they are steadily developing a Service
programme in which they will be supported
by the various Associate Dealers appointed
by them in the State of New South Wales.

“Adelaide”: We’ve ended that old system
by which a man could become a mayor in
S. Aus. “without doing any hard graft as
a common councillor.” Nowadays our mayors,
though elected by the ratepayers, must have
served in the council first.
Thebarton, an Adelaide suburb, has seen
a strange accident. A boy of 14 was stand-
ing on a platform fixing up a punching-ball.
Slipping off it, he caught his necktie on the
handle of a hay-fork, was found hanging un-
conscious, and had to be taken to a hospital.
A concern in London called Australian
Farms, Ltd., and engineered by Billis, is
said to be arranging for the settlement in
Australia of “Imperial ex-officers of the
public-school type.” The type that says
“haw,” in fact. No Australian bullock ever
put on a spurt by reason of “haw.” The
bullock is no public-school beast.
The Melbourne police, long regarded as a
rather slumbrous body but now under- new
management, has wakened up. In a few hur-
ried days it lately recovered about 10 tons
of stolen property at a dozen different places,
an old-age pensioner who had apparently
been kidnapped and a fair procession of
embezzled horses and carts. No lost ships
or elephants have been found yet, but there
are hopes.
“G.II.”: Affability is one of the most
valuable items in Birdie’s military equip-
ment. He always tried to give the impres-
sion that he remembered every domestic de-
tail confided to him. “Well, and how is
that father of yours getting on now?” he
inquired of one Digger. “Still dead” was
the laconic reply. Disraeli’s “And how
is the old complaint?” was better. All men
may not have fathers, but every man above
40 has an “old complaint.”
“Sands’ Directory” is 60 years old, an.l
if an honest vote could be taken among the
commercial and professional men of N. S.
Wales to-morrow as to what dozen public
benefactors deserve public memorials, “Sands’
Directory” would certainly stand high in
the scoring-list. It would get a Bulletin
vote, at any rate. There isn’t a day when
it doesn’t tell half a dozen departments of
this paper in three minutes what it would
take them hours to find out without it.
“0.L.”: A neighbor of mine, being asked
by a Melbourne timber-merchant to pay
225. 6d. per 100 super ft. for the hardwood
framing timbers of a house he was about to
build, with higher rates for 10ft. and up, and
cartage extra, decided to get a truck-load
direct from a bush mill. The price for
sound,. seasoned stuff, same as would have
been supplied by the retailer, was 13s. Bd.
per 100 super' ft., railway freight and
cartage included, and no impost was made
for special lengths. City timber-merchants
aren’t profiteering, of course. They’re just
making a bit while making’s easy.
“X Patch”: My objection to politicians
encountered in the A.I.F. was based on
their congenital inability to regard them-
selves as ordinary Diggers. We were
afflicted with one for about 12 months, and
succeeded in getting him into the line for
only one tour of five days, after which he
developed neurasthenia or something equally
tangible. He regarded his absence from Aus-
tralia as inviting national disaster, and was
constantly writing to Birdie, Hughes or Joe
Cook and usually getting what he asked for.
From opinions expressed by fellow-sufferers,
I gathered that he was a fair sample of the
species, although fortunately there were two
or three notorious exceptions.
“Solomon Malaprop”: It has been dis-
covered, or some learned man thinks it has,
that space is not limitless, but globular like
many other things, and is bounded somehow
by something. Therefore, if something set
out from the earth at great speed, and went
straight ahead for longer than a billion
men could imagine if they thought for a billion
years, it would arrive back at the earth,
just as the man who goes straight away
from Timbuetoo and keeps going finds him-
self back at Timbuetoo if it is still there.
The great eclipse of 1922, it is said, if the
eclipse is properly applied, will give a chance
to test this theory. But if Tom Walsh gets
to hear of it he will order a strike for cer-
tain till the matter is cleared up, so I de-
voutly hope Thomas won’t come across this.
“The Pariah”: “Good Australian’s” kick
( B. l/l/’2O) about the export of stud sheep
to Japan is opportune. The brown man is
taking a keen interest in the jumbuck. Half
of the Japs that come here give more or
less time to the study of sheep business.
Koide, who teaches Japanese at the Sydney
University, proposes to spend all his holi-
days in the country, so that he may see for
himself all the phases of wool-growing. He
has a degree in agriculture, and has studiefl
in German and English universities, so he
is not likely to do that sort of thing merely
to waste time. But I doubt if the Jap
will ever grow sheep successfully. The only
part of his islands which afford space is
the bleak north, and a previous attempt
made there failed. In Korea there is no
room for sheep if the people are to grow
their food, and the Manchurian provinces
would freeze Hell in winter.
“The Happy Historian”: The other day
a hatless individual asked an elderly lady
fresh from drawing £lOO from a Sydney
bank to step back into the office while he
took the numbers of the notes —he'd for-
gotten to do it. She thought he was a bank
official, and the thought cost her £lOO, for
he disappeared through a door marked “em-
ployees only” and didn’t emerge again.
There have been even cheekier rogues. In
the early days of Dymoeks, the hook people,
a stranger taking a book from the shelves
asked one of the two men working in the
shop what it was worth. He then sailed
with it to the other end of the shop and
offered to sell it to the boss, saying that
the manager in the front had valued it at
£9. The boss sang out to his employee: is
that right, £5?” and held up the book, the
other called back “That’s right—a aver,
and the cheeky man got a cheque. And
only a year or two ago a farmer, down to
buy machinery, spoke about his plans too
freely, and it cost him £2OO. He was met
at the entrance to an implement-maker s dis-
play at the Show by a smiling young ma
who showed him all the latest in farm
ventions, and ultimately sold him various
gear for cash, carefully took his name a
address, steered him out for a drink, and
then melted into the crowd,


WHAT IS BEST TO TAKE.
rfdfghygtjkhujk
UST at present is probably the most
trying period of the year owing to the
extreme heat, often accompanied by
great humidity, with wet and cold snaps
sandwiched in between. It is this sort of
thing that makes people feel washed out,
bad tempered and devoid of energy. Any
kind of work is most irksome. The business
man goes home each day with a headache
or some other bilious symptoms, and prob-
ably finds his wife and family in a similar
condition. None of them seem to know
exactly what they want or what is the
matter. In most cases it will be found that
it is nothing but the liver which has become
disordered and upset the , system. Very
simply caused but most distressing while it
lasts. At such a time Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are most valuable, and will cor-
rect this trouble speedily and restore the
organs to regular action. They act directly,
though gently, on the liver, and by this
means tone the system. Users of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are urged
to take them more freely while the trying
weather lasts, as the liver is most apt to
get out of order at this period of the year

It is claimed for Hugh Brady, who passed
out on the Darling Downs a few days ago,
that lie was the first man in Queensland to
smelt tin ore. That was at Stanthorpe. He
soon afterwards turned to farming, and the
excitement of it killed him at 77.
St. Pat.’s Day may again have a pro-
cession in Melbourne, provided the executive
gives guarantees that no objectionable em-
blems will be carried or controversial tab-
leaus shown. Anyway, it is known that new
Gaud Mayor Aikman has been obtaining
particulars of the arrangement made by the
State Government and the Town Hall when
Peacock was Premier and the late Ai’ch-
bishop Carr was the applicant.
“Naming”: American brewers, out of a
job, are looking for new fields, and many
have decided on China. One California con-
cern has arranged for the construction there
of a plant costing two million dollars, and
other American brewers are planning on
similar lines. China has forbidden opium,
and it is expected that beer will help the
enforcement of the decree. There are points
in being Ah Sin. All the effect a foreign
Tennyson Smith is likely to have on his
country is quite harmless.
Manifold, the newly-knighted President of
the Vic. Council, surprised everybody that
is anybody the •.other day, at one of the
festivities in honor of Arthur Robinson, by
speaking disparagingly of official clothes. In
commenting upon the talk about Robinson
taking the Agent-Generalship, S’Walter said
he could not imagine his friend decking him-
self out in Windsor uniform, sword and
cocked hat. At Manifold’s own At Home
Peter Mcßride lately wore just such habili-
ments, and it is pretty clear that the effect
on his host was painful.
“Broker”: Under the new scale of duties
in Britain, Australian wines have a solid
preference. Wines not exceeding 30 per
cent, of proof spirit are subject to a duty of
9d. a gallon as against Is. 3d. on foreign
brands, and those that exceed 30 per cent,
pay 2s. as against 3s. levied on the foreigner.
Cased “still” wines in bottles are subject to
Is. 3d., which is half the amount outsiders
pay. It is good news, for a new competitor
in California has entered the lists, and is
going to make a fight for those markets which
have been largely collared by Australia.
It was the day after Webster had re-
turned quietly to his office, and when Watt’s
P.C. was still new. A Henry Hayseed, well
pleased with himself at becoming an M.P.,
dropped in to the public offices to rehearse
for departmental trotting. He asked where
political chieftains were to be found, and a
friendly officer explained, using his right
hand to point out the location of Hughes,
Jocook and Watt, and his left to indicate
where Webster and Glynn could be run
down. “Ah, I see,” said the freshly-elected
one, merrily—“right honorables this way,
left honorables that way.”
The current report of the Minister for
Education contains evidence of the way “the
chief business of-a State” is carried on in
Bananaland. On the authority of the retir-
ing principal of the Training College:—
The proportion of unclassified teachers, nearly
one-half, is higher than in Maoriland, where the
classified (i.e., trained) teachers reach 71 per cent.,
of the teachers employed; and it is also higher
than in any of the larger Australian States.
This is how they attempted to rectify
matters: —•’
The operations of the Training College were limited
by necessary economy due to the continuance of the
Great. War. This economy led to a reduction in the
number of short-course students enrolled for the
year, namely to 19 in January and 20 in June, a
total of 39, as compared with 71 in 1914, 60 in
1915 and 99 in 1916.
So Ryan economised where eeqnomy can
be least afforded, and loafed on the Great
War as usual.
“Sixo”: To run against “Tom Noddy's”
nomination (B. 8/l/’2O), I enter a bird
of the 3rd Divvy for the vanishing stakes.
For my sins I had a guard at Hurdcott on
Christmas Eve, 1918. My bird was then
awaiting trial on three charges of A.W.L.
He. had been loose for 21 years, and for 18
months, in company with an adopted Wood-
bine spouse, had kept a fish-and-chip joint
in London a couple of hundred yards from
the Horseferry-road headquarters, and some
of the “Jacks” were regular customers. As.
usual, the woman put him away. It was
a bitterly cold night, and, being Christmas,
I let him out of the cell and we yarned over
the lire. He decided I was a good sport
and he’d give me a spin. He kept his
word. But next night he cut his way out
of the cell, and the sergeant who relieved
me “did his bars” over it.
“Billy B.”: It’s as sure as sun-up tluit
people will board a moving train if they get
a chance. It’s a risk easy to explain and
sympathise with in despite of its foolishness.
They shouldn’t be given the chance. On
the time for a train to leave a barrier
should fall over the entrance. That alone
will save" the passenger from himself when
he loses his own head and from the railway
servant when his goes. One of the most
hair-raising things I ever saw was a train
bustling out of Sydney station with a
rattled guard trying to push off a car-
riage platform a youth who had leaped
aboard on the fly. When I bawled in his
ear that he was trying to commit murder
he spluttered in my starboard eye, took my
name and address and yelled that he would
“see about” me! Perhaps he did, and let
it go at that.
John Hops assisting in the preparation
of new electoral rolls for the Vic. Assembly
are not finding it easy to induce Chinese to
fill in the forms. Ah Soon mostly reckons
there is a “catch” somewhere and denies
vigorously that he is the occupier of the
building, and when cross-examined remarks
(a) No savee; (b) he does not know; (c)
he never smokes; (d) he no speak English;
(e) whaffor? There seems no special rea-
son why the Electoral Department should be
so anxious to compel Ah Fat to take an
interest in Australian politics; but it has
issued a warning that unless colored brother
enrols, without delay he will be dealt with.
The chances are that in due course it will
be discovered that Won Hi is not on the
roll, an intelligent John Hop will serve a
summons on Yet Soo, and when Li Chang
appears in court to explain that his friend
Soo is welly ill the Beak will dismiss the
ease or fine Chang on general principles.

Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You

stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickly, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?

ChAMPEPLNNS
Tablets -
Hot-weather liver troubles get many who enjoy
good health at all other times of the year.
Many people who generally enjoy
good health suffer from biliousness in the
summer time. Rich foods served cold
are difficult to digest by the majority and
often produce a chilling of the entire di-
gestive tract. The liver thus becomes
sluggish, when the condition known as
biliousness results.
This is often accompanied by constip-
ation and indigestion. Serious as it may
seem the unfortunate person can soon
remedy these ailments by taking Cham-
berlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are a tonic laxa-
tive which contain ingredients that act on
the liver and stimulate it. They will re-
lieve hot-weather liver complaint very
quickly.
When you lack energy, don’t relish
.your food, feel dull and stupid, all
you need is a dose of Chamberlain s
Tablets. They will make you feel like
a new man and give you an appetite
like a bear. They will do you more
good than a five shilling bottle of tonic.
If you have any indisposition of the
stomach, liver or bowels you should at
once take
CtUMBEBIAII6TABLCI3
Jhf the Stomach o Livep.
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
raay be avoided.
13e Firm.
Wien you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic anti
Diarrhoea.»Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediatf and permanent
relief.

WHY?

Fine Diamonds, set
in Platinum, £l5.
Selected Diamonds
and Centre Sapphire
set in Platinum,
£l2.
Because our repute for selling only the best grades of diamonds was confirmed.
Because all through the war years we never raised the price of our diamond stock, although
values in Europe doubled. We objected to profiteering.
Because the public knows that with us only the best qualities are stocked, but prices are
kept to the minimum, consistent with such quality.
Because our expert knowledge, our best buying power and skill, and our great reputation, are all
at our customers’ service.
Diamonds will continue to rise for years. The demand is in excess of the supply.

Conventional devices, stale yet trusty ;
Two jealous wives, a guardian bluff and
gusty;
A husband, urged by force of complications
To aid his wife in dangerous flirtations,
The while he squirms in menial disguise
And notes his Georgette making goo goo eyes
At someone else’s lawful lord and master;
Smart chorus girls, to make things travel
faster
When dialogue hangs fire, or jokes fall flat
Which Noah’s brain in Deluge-days begat •
Some change of scenes, laid all in giddy
France;
Fair dreams of gowns, a fine athletic dance,
Within the Cafe where the fiction ends
And reconciliation to old amours lends
Enchantment —all the dear familiar ways
To catch the careless public ear and gaze
Are here adopted. Lighting from above
Streams down upon the sturdy theme of Love
That never wanes, in any age or clime,
And gives this show its title—“ Kissing Time.”
* * * *
“Kissing Time,” the present musical play
at Melbourne Royal, began to look unprom-
ising as soon as Gladys Moncrieff had dis-
posed of the bright ditty, with chorus
attachment, that started the narrative. Two
or three duologues in succession were long
and witless; and the arrival of Bantock with
a frequent reference to an internal paiu
merely added fuel to the fatuousness. Then,
when prospects were very depressing, an
uplift was provided by a stereotyped old
Colonel (Stigant), who proceeded to mistake
the wife of Theodore Leonard (Gladys Mon-
crieff) for the spouse of Leslie Holland,
whose own doting bride (Maude Fane) had
wheedling designs on the Colonel. On this
ancient scheme of misunderstanding the story
got along briskly enough until at length the
plot dwindled and the business took care of
itself.
“Kissing Time” is likely to be a long time
at the Royal. Though it wanted some cut-
ting on the first night, the entertainment has
many bright moments apart from the stag-
gering parade of gowns in the Cafe and tue
athletic whirl of Robert Jackson and Louise
Larsson. This latter act stirs the very vitals
of the audience. Leonard is full of comedy
tricks, and pungent in speech and song as
the distressed husband; Leslie Holland be-
comes his chirpy British self, after opening
as an incredible French soldier who marches
with his legs akimbo, as it were. Maude
Fane, mostly a blonde vision in rose 'pink
“Kissing Time," at
Melbourne Royal.
Theodore Leonard as
Bi-Bi St. Pol.
and pale blue, is
addicted to senti-
mental ballads that
display her voice to
advantage, whilst
Gladys Moncrieff is
an item of about
equal value. The
two leading ladies,
as a matter of un-
usual fact, have
really fatter parts
than the foremost
men, and the prin-
cipal musical suc-
cess of the piece is
a duet in which
they divide the
honors. The one
drawback to the
triumph of these
sweet, level-toned
daughters of har-
mony is their lack
of keenness in enun-
ciation. Song words
rarely come forcibly
from their lips,
though the sound is
always effective. All
the ballad and
jingle music of the
play is eminently
tuneful and strikingly unoriginal. The care-
ful treatment it gets from a somewhat
stinted orchestra deserves as much credit as
the handsome dressing ancl staging of a well-
managed production into which every cut-
and-dried effect of the dozen nrevious come-
dies seems to have been crowded.
"Oddments,” at Melbourne Tivoli, is now
persevering with an alleged “gala pro-
gramme” prepared last week for the pleasure
of General Birdwood. The new entertain-
ment isn’t much of an improvement on the
ojd, but it is kept moving by the hard work
of Minnie Love and Workman, and gets use-
ful assistance from the warm tenor tones of
Arthur Aldridge. Though the manner of
Arthur’s favorite song, “Come into the Gar-
den, Maud,” invites Maud’s dad to sool the
dog on him, the warbler has still an under-
tone of pure passion which, poured into one
of his toreador airs, is apt to cause even
over-married females to breathe a bit harder.
When rendered by Aldridge in his loveliest
Spanish style, a recent item, “Nita Gitana,”
for instance, almost amounts to one of the
reasons why girls leave home.
sjs & If-
Since Barry Lupino resumed the volumin-
ous wardrobe of Mrs. Hubbard at Mel-
bourne King’s, his temporary understudy,
Maurice Dudley, has been flourishing afresh
as the curious demon miser of the tale. This
bent and demented personage suggests Bal-
zac’s Grandet with a dash of Dickens’s
Scrooge, and the character seems to be satu-
rated with the actor’s consciousness of its
importance as a literary figure. On that
account Dudley’s Entwhistle appears a bit
subtle and overdrawn, especially as he
occupies a serio-comic position tending to
belittle a careful impersonation. All the same,
the actor makes the most of his opportunities
and faithfully does his best in scenes where a
flying saucepan or an uplifted hoof is often
the whole incentive to dramatic expression.

A company of Digger-actors will let Mel-

an elderly fatuous aristocrat who has

well) with the customary Apache partner
(William Scott), and the lot pursue their
devious ways determined to avoid any intel-
ligent action that might bring a sudden end
to the story. “The Ragged Messenger,”
Hoyt’s second feature, with Violet Hopson
and an all-British caste, achieves notice by
its comparative restraint and original route
to a familiar objective. At the Majestic the
welcome juvenile work of Jack Pickford
keeps the eye anchored to “In Wrong.” Jack
is a country reuben suspected of burgling
a bank, but most of the time he is making
love. In the wake of Pickford old friend
William Desmond comes as Bare-Fisted Gal-
lagher. It is a mining tale packed with
guns, girl and gold-stealing, and the late
Master Deadwood Dick, might have been
proud to own it.

Adelaide Tivoli revives the spoken drama
with a Puller Co., opening in “The House

variety, with a lot of new artists just com-
ing in. Pictures have a strongly feminine
interest, supplied largely by Rex Beach' and
Elinor Glyn. At West’s Constance Tal-
madge shows in “The Shuttle” how an Ame-
rican girl can cross over to England and
annex one nobleman while defeating the vil-
lainy of another who happens to he her
brother-in-law.' Wondergraph deals with
Katherine Bush, who took the wrong road
and found the fact awkward when her turn
for annexing the peerage arrived. At the
Royal is little Mary McAlister in “Pants,”
with Theda Bara about to bring in her
special brand of devilry. At Austral Gar-

“Grip”: In the absurd military charges
competition I enter the following, which was
framed against a gunner in Egypt early in
1916, when the cheese on issue was
notoriously vicious:—
That he did, to the prejudice of good order and
military discipline, at Serapeum, Egypt, tether a
piece of cheese to a stake in the ground.

Since the coming of peace, athletic work
in London music-halls is coming back to its
old prominence. During the war people
wanted simply to be made to laugh; but
now the acrobat, balancer, dancer or roller-
skater is again the most popular thing on
the programme.
“The Gold Diggers,” a new American plav.
is not at all what the title might suggest,
being in reality a rather savage satire on
theatrical life. Modern N’York slang, which
calls the girl clerk a “clock-watcher,” knows
chorus-girls as “gold-diggers”—the allusion
is unpleasantly obvious.
“P.X.”: Picture-makers ar.e going to be
pushed on to the same back seat as other
Australian manufacturers, if they don’t look
out. Who, for instance, knows the name of
the firm which made “The Sentimental
Bloke” film? The name of the man who
“presents” it is widely-enough advertised;
but the name of the little co. that manufac-
tured it is pushed so far into the background
that, though I heard it once, I’ve forgotten
it myself.
“Stargazer”: Charley and Harryf Coghill
were running a variety show at St. George’s
Hall, where Hoyt’s Melbourne theatre now
stands, and a feature of their entertainment
was a lively thought-reading turn given by
Professor Something and Madame his gifted
sister. The lady sat blindfolded on the
stage, and her voluble brother went among
the audience soliciting articles and confid-
ences, which the lady on the stage described
and explained aloud by virtue of what the
Professor said was her miraculous gift of
■clairvoyance and second-sight. Nothing, it
appeared, was a mystery to her: she could
dip into all minds, fathom all intentions;
by her supernatural gifts she was cognisant
of all things. One night the Professor found
a most sympathetic subject in , the front
istalls, and to the audience’s delight the lady
read him like a book. The show having
done with him, the young man was passing
out of the hall with just a trifle too much
haste, when the Prof, clapped his hand to
his fob pocket, and the next-moment yelled:
“Hi, hi, stop that fellow ! He has stolen
my watch!” It was pitifully true. The
fellow had not. only taken the Prof.’s watch,
but had purloined everything be had about
him, and the great clairvoyant and thought-
reading turn went bung on the spot.
TRIUMPH.

My boots are soft, sweet, pale, blue kid.
My stockings’ sheen I oft disclose—
They were not woven to be hid.
And when I walk abroad I hear
Their praise, and drifting eyes I see.
The women when I’m passing near
All swing about to look at me.
I do not mind w'hat men may do,
What compliments each fellow sheds,
Or if they coolly look me through,
While I can turn the women’s heads!

“M.P.A.”: Arthur Stigant and “Vaude-
ville Vet,” writing of the broken-mirror act,
only touch on modern performances. When
Stigant used this business in the J.C.W.
panto in 1917, I
wrote a P.P. par
about the Schwartz
Bros., whom I had
seen at London Hip-
podrome in 1912.
After weighing up
the acts at the halls
in London in that
year, I placed the
brothers’ as the
most finished
comedy stunt then
presented. Talking
to an old friend in
the business about
it, I was informed
that old-man Leh-
man, who brought
a troupe to the Ilay-
market Theatre,
Melbourne, in the
’sixties, had a pair
of clever daughters
who did a dancing
act on the mirror
principle. One
worked as Madame
Marxetti and
t’other as Julia
Lehman. There is
every reason to be-
lieve that Lehman’s
girls were taught
the act by some of
the clever mimics

of the old French school, who had the idea

training in dumb show.
“D.”: At one of the leading picture
theatres in Brisbane the other day the
orchestra did its work in shirt sleeves. It
was a vice-regal performance, too. The
Governor —who got as close to shirt-s'eeves
as he dared—nodded his approval. He knew
it’s no ioke fidddling or blowing for hours
with a temperature ranging from 80° to
100°.
“Pish Tush”: A lot of the press boosting
of Theodore Leonard in Melbourne seems to
me inspired, not so much by affection for
Theodore, as by dislike for the Firm that
employs him. For some time there have
been dark stories of strained relations be-
tween Leonard and his bosses, and even
darker rumors of their efforts to suppress the
genius in the sight of his god—the public.
other things it was alleged that the
J.C.W. publicity department was not puffing
Leonard. This, at any rate, was untrue:
in the course of my own press duties I
handled a bit of official skite about the
comedian long after the absurd canard got
into circulation. Likewise it was whispered
that the two or three critics who refused to
fit Leonard with the halo of George Lauri
had had their hostility stirred in advance by
a whisper from the management, though I
can vouch for at least two critics who neither
required nor received any advice regarding
the attitude they should adopt to the come-
dian. On the other hand I can record what
looked like an attempt to enrol at least one
critic among Leonard’s admirers. Personally
I know nothing of Leonard’s relations with
the Firm, and am not a bit concerned in
J.C.W.’s reputation ; but I am satisfied that
the Firm is being lied about now in order
to win sympathy and good notices for one
of its performers.

Leonard Nelson
was one who suc-

manager wired a

Nelson was sup-

sou g h t out the

common with all
artists, had been
thrown into en-
forced idleness by
the closing of the theatres. The equally-
mystified Nelson wired back: “Don’t want
to rest; want to work. What’s the joke?”
“Ancient Prompter”: It was a perhaps
excusable mistake of the printer, who, no
doubt, was an ardent admirer of musical
comedy and revue. We were going to do a
performance of Goldsmith’s immortal “She
Stoops to Conquer,” and sent in an ad. to
the local rag to that effect. They printed it
“She Strips to Conquer.”
“C. Ockney”: The big London Alhambra
revue, “Eastward Ho,” has gone west after
three months —which suggests frosty weather.
The show was easily the most expensive put
upon West-end boards in recent years.
Oscar Asche, part-author and producer, spent

curtain went up. Managing-director Oswald

“Fleet Street” (London) : Dion Tither-
adge’s latest venture is a play attached to
music—the music, of auite an exceptional
quality, being supplied by Ken. Duffield, of
Adelaide. The play is to be produced here
this year by Andre Chariot, of the Prince
of Wales Theatre. Dion has also lately
written and sold five scenarios for the
movies.
“Norbell”: When Rignold finished his
eight-years tenancy of Sydney Majesty’s in
’95, Alfred Woods carried on for a spell. He
put up a panto at Christmas, and a feature
of the harlequinade was a moss-grown but
never-failing “have.” The clown (Tommy
Cosgrove) made some horseplay with a
mimic. Salvation Army, and at once a gentle-
man in evening-dress stood up in one of
the D.C. boxes and protested loudly. The
shrinking young angel beside him implored
him to sit down, but that only made him*
more excited. Finally, after a heated
wrangle with the clown, and amidst deri-
sive uproar from the house, the Salvation
champion overbalanced himself and was
dragged on to the stage. Immediately the
clown seized one coat sleeve and the panta-
loon the other, the dress-suit came in halves,
and the trio took headers through a trap in
the scenery. It “went” so well that a
friend of Woods’s bet him that he could im-
prove on the sensation and upset the pro-
ceedings. This oractical joker rigged up a
bogus policeman, and arranged for him to
“arresr’ the D.G. interjector as soon as he
got going. Walter Rivers (since dead in
America) played the protesting Johnnie, but
on this particular night he took ill, and went
home after the first act, leaving Frank
Foster to take his place as the Johnnie. The
conscientious Foster got into the trick dress-
suit, and took his seat with his lady in due
course. As soon as he stood up to interject,
the counterfeit John, in full uniform, strode
through the circle and seized the interrupter
by the arm. “Go ’way, you damn fool!”
implored his victim in an agonised whisper.
“It’s part of the blanky show!” But the
policeman was obdurate, and finally lugged
the wildly-protesting Foster through the
circle to the stairs and down into the vesti-
bule. Then a real policeman, noting the
disturbance, came to lend his “mate” a
hand, and between them they man-handled
the struggling mummer till they dragged his
trick clothes off, and the joke was exploded.
The wretched Foster was allowed to sprint
into Pitl-street and round to the stage-door,
lightly clad in pink fleshings and a thick
cloud of profanity.
“ Jarrah”: W.A. may not be the best of
fields for theatrical “specking,” but at odd
times much gold has been picked up by good
shows —notably Williamson’s, when they
have done the fair thing and sent the Syd-
ney-Melbourne successes over in their en-
tirety. But Williamsons have been shrewd
enough never to drop their cos. in the West
in the dog days. Others, less cautious, have
suffered. One or two recent, visitations from
the drama that points the moral have
withered like the Perth grass under the
GUARANTEED.
“Do you think the new show will be a
success ?”
“Sure thing! Even the leading lady blushed
when she read her part at the first
rehearsal.”
fierce tropical sun; but in the season the
West is hungry for good stuff —musical stuff
preferred.
“T. 0.1.” : Apropos Irving and Armadale
(B. 29/l/’2O). The late Wm. Ryan (on
the stage—Arrowsmith in private life), an
actor of the heavy type, frequently under-
studied G. V. Brooke when the tragedian
was “indisposed.” No change was announced,
and most of the audience went away in the
belief that they had seen Brooke. I admit
that Ryan could only appear in such charac-
ters as “Lear” where the make-up disguised
the actor. By the way, Mrs. Randolph Bed-
ford was a Miss Arrowsmith.
“Monkbarns”: The Rev. Gorman, the
.Ringing Parson of vaudeville, recalls George
Crichton Miln. He began in the U.S. as
an evangelical pastor, went on to Unitarian-
ism and then became a tragedian, His
Shakspearean performances were relished in
Sydney and Melbourne, where he came to
grief in management. Louise Jordan, his
wife, made only one mistake —she went to
bed as Desdemona with her boots on.
“Border Fence”: Queerest outburst I ever
saw at a picture show happened when the
Willard-Dempsey fight film was being shown
at Byron Bay (N.S.W.). An excited cow-
puncher leaped up during a rally in the first
round apd offered to bet a quid that Wil-
lard would win. He wouldn’t believe either
that the film hadn’t been faked when Demp
sey settled the long slab quick and lively.
“Bally Who”; Comedian Johnny O’Neil,
who attempted to introduce the Duke of
Edinburgh’s elephant into the show busi-
ness (B. 22/l/’2O), went circusing himself
once with Chiarini. The Signor travelled
62 trained horses and 150 people, and in
Sydney occupied
the whole block
from and including
the present Hippo-
drome site right
through to George-
street. When he
sailed for Batavia
he used an entire
ship. The Carlo
Bros, fell out with
the old man just
before the sailing
and quitted. Chia-
rini was wrath, but
he almost frothed
at the mouth when
one of the deserters
m arried his pet
tight-rope walker,
Emmeline Bridges.
The circus had all
her props, aboard
the boa t, and
Emmy demanded
them. No one had
authority to de-
liver them except
Chiarini, who pur-
posely made him-
self invisible. The
boat was held up
in the har b o r
during the search.
O’Neil took the
opportunity of slip-
ping ashore to buy
lemons. He never
returned. O’Neil,
by the way, sup-
ported Charle s'
“As You Were," at
Sydney Tivoli.

raun Australia knew, and believes he was

Certainly he has been Conn more times in

May Martin Wirth, the somersaulting
girl on horseback, who took American circus
audiences by storm with her performance,
was married recently in New .York to Frank
Martin Wirth, a young Australian who took
the name of the Royal Wirth Family for
business reasons. Since Mrs. Martin, a
sister of George and Philip Wirth, and a
fine performer on horseback in her day, took
May and an assisting team away to the
States, the bridegroom has managed the
booking end of the act.
“Biobox”: I vote in favor of vaudeville
and circus managements paying the insur-
ance premiums on artists engaged in hair-
raising feats (B. S/l/'2O), but what about
the movie stunt-actor? In the old days it
was mostly fake that sent the shudder
through cinema audiences, but the fans are
wiser now and quick to spy the “cod stuff.”
Late last year two N. York movie gladiators
were engaged in a hand-to-hand combat on
the top of a prop submarine which was to
sink during the battle. It sank all right. So
did the actors, and one did not "come up till
the water-police dragged the bay.
“S.S.”: Why is an entertainment like
"Oddments” imported? There is not in it
from first to last a single item that could
not be bettered here at 10 minutes’ notice.
There is not even the usual excuse for the
display of foreign goods of this description
that the stage-managing is already done
and the “paper” is procurable abroad, since
there is no stage-management that a tyro
could not handle, and no visible “papex - ” of
intrinsic value. Indeed, any band of fairly
experienced and proficient performers turned
loose on the stage and ordered to do some-
thing on the spur of the moment could pro-
duce a better entertainment, and a more
coherent one.
A PHILOSOPHY OF KISSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Take a kiss, for example,’’ said Mr. Henderson.
“There is nothing in a kiss. But how they hang on to
it in the pictures!” (Renewed laughter). A delegate:
“Don’t you do it like that?” (Loud laughter).
Report of Teachers’ Union.
A kiss it is a gentle thing
Beloved from pole to pole,
And oft performed, as sages sing,
With heart and mind and soul.
Performed, observed, enjoyed—the style
Is in the changing phrase:
The kiss that measures half a mile,
The peck that burns and stays.
Old Judas kissed and side-stepped quick
To make his purpose plain ;
The Judasess still tries the trick
With simple Mary Jane.
“So very glad to see you, dear” —
And then the thin lips make
A sudden dab below the ear
Swift as a rt"iking snake.
But kisses wro ..ht by man and maid
As love’s supreme appeal
Are better flavored, better laid,
And good to give and feel.
They stand for faith, they stand for truth,
Whatever else may lie,
Since each must learn in early youth
Through swift attempts and shy.
And something of that youth remains
Through all the years between—
The kisser dreams of August rains
And daisied pathways green.
Peck though he will, dab though he may,
A splendid truth is this:
The traitor waiting to betray
Can never truly kiss.
No act can give the clinging urge—
Sweets in a rose-lit fog—
Though flaccid lip on lip may splurge
Like cow-hooves in a bog.
A hundred kisses in a day,
And still the hearts make song—-
Oh, Eleanor, Amelia stay!
How long, O Lord, how long?
He prayeth best who kisseth best
All maids both great and small,
For clearly in his ample breast
Is room enough for all.
Men with a mouth eight feet by three,
As shown upon the screen,
Should give a kiss as large and free
As any soup tureen.

THE PICTURE ACTRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She had a shop in Collins-street,
And sold fine lingerie.
Her taste in nndies was so neat
She prospered famously.
But now she’s sold her place in town,
And in a long, eccentric gown
Parades a histrionic frown.
She says Viola Dana’s fair,
And Theda Bara —well,
She passes with some pushing where
Men are not critical.
“But I go at an early day
To star in pictures grave and gay—
Los Angeles, the U.S.A.”
“And have you acted?” people say.
“Oh, well, I will, no doubt.”
“You think you can?” “Oh in a way.
For folks who’ve been about
Are telling me (they’ve seen these plays)
I ought to go—l take always
A lovely photograph!” she says.

Ihe A.I.F. XI. disappointed somewhat in
their first strike against N. S. Wales, despite the
brilliant individual effort of Jack Gregory. lie
shapes like the cricket find of a century, and it
will be a great loss to the game if he sticks to his
present intention of putting work first and going on
to a far Northern station. With a year or so’s
experience he would probably be the most punishing
left-hand bat on record. He is already perhaps the
greatest slip that ever took the field. As a bowler
he recalls the abo., Henry, who came south one
season with the Bananalanders, and he fields his own
returns as keenly as the nigger did. But as for
pace Docker can’t be much behind him ; and he is
funereal compared with
Cotter. The roost in-
triguing bowler on the
N. S. Wales side, all
through, was Mailey.
The little man’s slows
had all the Diggers
tied up part of the
time and some of (hem
all the time. Andrews,
on the other hand, was
treated with genuine
enthusiasm. He came
on in the second in-
nings, when Gregory
and Collins had w”"i
down Norman and
Trenerry, and the six-
footer banged him for
14 in his first over.
Norman seemed to be
trying to bowl too fasr.
and the result was all
too often the succulent
long hop or the presen-
tation full pitch. Car-
ter is still without
peer behind the sticks,
and some of Andrews’
work at silly mid-olf
was superb.
COLLINS,
Captain A.I.F.
Cricket XI.
“Norbell'’: If the Sydney Cricket Ground
serangs want gates they should treat their bob
patrons courteously. On the Tuesday of last week
I turned up at 11 a.m. (the advertised time) to
see the 3rd day of the N.S.W. v. Vie. match. The
gates were shut and there was nothing doing. No
explanation was given, and no hint as to when the
game would start. I hung on with a crowd of
other enthusiasts until nearly 12.45, when the
gates were opened. Then we found that the game
was in full swing, and that' Ransford had been dis-
posed of and Park had got going. What would the
gallery queue at Her Majesty’s say if they weren’t
let in till after the first act? Or how would the
Randwielc crowd perform if they were held up at
the gates till the first race had been run?
It looks as if the Sheffield Shield would
stay in the Ma State for ever. N. S. AVales has won
three matches against Victoria’s two. Victoria has
yet to play South Aus., but will need a phenomenal
win to achieve the required balance.
The eighth round of Melbourne District
was played off on the Foundation holiday last week
and resulted in more single-innings decisions than the
limited time had led people to expect. The most pun-
ishment was handed to South by Fitzroy, who retorted
to South’s 108 with 364 for live wickets (Liddicut
116 not out). The same man also had the bowling
honors (four for 43) and on his recent figures de-
mands bigger recognition from the selectors of the
Vic. Eleven. Northcote easily beat Carlton by seven
wickets and 44 runs. Bailey (five for 57) and Wood-
bury (five for 74) shared the ’Cote attack and
worried every bat, bar Clover, who contributed 85
n.o. to Carlton’s modest 155. Melbourne won from
P’ran by 20 runs, but only a solid eighth-wicket
partnership enabled them to put the P’ran total of
143 behind them. Melbourne’s Ironmonger produced
pessimism in the shop suburb by gathering five scalps
for 62. It was unnecessary to call in the police for
the disturbance between Richmond and Uni. Rich-
mond’s 130 runs were registered in a manner that
commands respect at ludo or draughts. Uni. com-
piled 170 as if they were reluctant to carry their
victory to the verge of insult. Collingwood and St.
Kilda were more animated. ’Wood hammered up
268 and at the gong Saints had lost two for 151,
the match ending in a draw. Essendon scuffled with
East with the same indeterminate result, though
East, scoring seven sticks for 219 in response to
Essendon’s six for 245 (declared closed), may be
said to have lost on points.
* * * *
Onkapariuga (S.A.) Racing Club has in-
creased stakes for its Easter Monday meeting, always
much patronised by Victorians. Hurdle Race and
Cup will now carry £4OO each, and the Steeple
£lloo—£7so to the winner. The Club talks con-
fidently of departing from its long record of only
one fixture a year; the second one will probably be
in October.
“Yarra Ben”: Lucky Jim Scobie! He
generally enters a horse or two for the Woodend
(Vic.) meeting. This year he overlooked the date.
The secretary, sizing up the situation, rang him up'
the night the entries closed. Scobie promptly
nominated two nags—Sun Cloud arnd Katiga. The
last-named arrived on the scene in time to win the
Woodend Cup in Rupert Clarke’s colors. Its price
was one. Lucky Jim! Lucky Rupert!
Bracegirdle, one of the best steeplechase
jockeys in S. Aus., is to ride no more. He had a
bad fall over hurdles lately, and the doctors say
“Never again.”
In winning a welter race at Moonee Val-
ley last Saturday the much-fancied Ready Aye Ready
called further attention to the probability of another
Newmarket going to N. S. Wales. Not that the son
of Wallace is necessarily the most likely of recent
Sydney performers to do the trick. Victorians talk
softly of Chrysolaus, Aries, Oetigne and others as
likely to beat the best of the local sprinters, but
there doesn’t appear to be much money chipping
into the discussion as yet. Writing before the late
£3O entries for Caulfield Futurity Stakes have been
received, this scribe expects that one of them will
eventually play a star part in the betting and the
race for the brief and hasty event at Flemington.
The safest motto for punters thusfar is “Wait and
See.”
The prompt scratching of Artilleryman
and Lucknow for the Australian Cup has settled the
question as to what weights would bring those
top-notchers down to the level of the common or
every-week gee of quality. The long distance race
is open to any commonplace animal with stamina in
its blood and a careful preparation in its favor. A
possibility cropped up last Saturday in Cyntoi, a
five-year-old imported horse that won a one-mile
Maiden Plate in pleasing style. He beat nothing,
but he did it very well. There are possibilities right
down to the 6st. 71b. division, but the shortage in
competent boys who can ride the weight makes one
chary of looking far down the list of entries for a
second choice in a double.
The True Blue gelding Two Blues was a
lucky speculation for the Tassy who races as “S. M.
Wilson.” He is a real stayer and weight-carrier,
though not quite class enough for Randwick. He has
just added the George Adams Handicap to the long
list of his successes in the Apple Island.
* » * *
At the Canterbury (M.L.) Racing Club’s
meeting on the 31st. ult. the principal race —the
Middle Park Plate (6fur.) —went to George Clif-
ford’s two-year-old colt Winter W’ind (Antagonist—
Wind-whistle). The same owner’s classy Moorfowl
was among the nominations; also G. L. Stead’s
Right and Left.
* * * *
The consistent Stage Girl romped home in
the S.A. Tatt.’s Handicap (11m.) on Saturday, doing
the distance in 2min. 36jsec.—nearly six seconds
worse than Wedding Day’s record. The latter’s
time compares favorably with the new American
record just put up by Thunderclap, a grandson of
Rock Sand—2min. 29 3-ssee.
* * * *
The next best thing to disqualifying an
outlaw is to erect a rail at the starting post to
separate him from the rest of the field. This is the
idea of the Dunedin (M.L.) Jockey Club and it is
one that might be copied in Australia.
Frank Beaurepaire gave the Yankee cham-
pion, Norman Ross, a sound beating in the half-mile
championship of Victoria at St. Kilda Baths on
Saturday. Ross began his Melbourne campaign by
informing the press that open-water swimming with
a rope turn represented new conditions so far as he
was concerned, and that the locals would have a
distinct pull oier him in consequence. When the
wind changed during the early afternoon and pushed
the Port Phillip rollers through the top fence of the
baths Ross smelt the approach of defeat. To the
displeasure of the crowd he refrained from taking
the board in the 106yds. event in which Ivan Sted-
man was waiting for his scalp. Stedman won the
“hundred” from Logan in 59sec. Billy Mason, an
ex-champion and returned soldier with a “game”
leg, pushed the pair closely, dead-heating with
country swimmer Wallace for 3rd position.
In the half-mile Ross stuck to Bogey till
the stocky Victorian wore him down at the half-
distance, and swimming strongly gradually put
lengths between them. From the* sixth lap, where
Beaurepaire got a two-length break after the turn,
it was a procession, Bogey touching the rope half
a lap to the good in 12min. 8 4-ssec. A good
effort considering the state of the water.
It is such a contest as this which goes to show
that in tests of real endurance the good little man
is better than the good big man. Bogey evidently
has greater strength for his weight and inches than
Ross has for his height and tonnage.
Norman Ross left the train at Sydney on
his way to Melbourne, and cleaned up the last of
the N. S. Wales swimming championships. That is
to say the mile, which he covered in 24min. 6sec.
The time was slow but the mediocre efforts of Billy
Longworth and M. Christie didn’t invite effort. The
placid water and the turns helped Ross.
JACK
GREGORY,
the A.I.F.
howler.
Ex-schools’ champion Keith Kirkland is
young to have killed a Chinaman, yet what can you
think when you consider his rotten luck? After finish-
ing second to Ross in the 100yds. State champion-
ship he went down in the test to represent N. S.
Wales at the Australian championships in the
southern States. On Saturday, however, in gather-
ing Northern Suburbs (Sydney) 100yds. champion-
ship in 58 3-ssee., he badly defeated H. Hay (chosen
rep.), and C. Crackenthorp. Later in the afternoon
Kirkland left 220yds. behind in 2min. 35 3-6 sec.
Apparently the only thing to do is to include Kirk-
land as an extra member of the State team.
* * * *
The 100-yards swimming championship of
South Aus. was retained by the holder, L. Reed-
man, who won from his brother Sid in lmin. ssee.
Spencer Major, from Moonta, was an also-swam.
But in the 220yds.—also freshwater —the sprinter
champion died a wav in the second half, and Major
won comfortably. Sid Recdman was again second.
The brothers are sons of Jack, a great performer in
most branches of aridities when Dad was a boy.
* * * *
There was a curious end to the scrap
between veteran Frank Thorn and Jamito at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday right. In the 10th round the
Filipino, who was much the stronger of the two,
dashed his adversary to the boards. He didn’t
knock the veteran down: ho threw him. Thorn
stayed where he was, with the evident intention of
resting. However, he overdid it. As he rose the
referee indicated the colored youth as the winner.
Up to the time of this occurrence Sydney’s old
favorite was well in the lead on points. On the
other hand, it is doubtful if he could have lasted
out the 20 rounds, or even another five.
Eight events of the Australasian A.AT
championships were decided at Sydney on Saturday.
M.L. and N.S.W. each won three and Victoria two.
The big item was the 100yds. sprint, and Walton
Hunt, who has a vigorous style and a high,
machine-like action, won comfortably in lOsec. from
the stocky J. Lindsay (M.L.), J. Leadley (N.S.W.)
and R. Burguez (Q.). Burguez lifted the first heat
in 10 2-ssec. after being two yards behind in the
first 40. A better knowledge of the track would
have brought him close to the flying Hunt in the
final. The 440yds. was a boil-over. Lindsay (M.L.)
won the first heat in 54 3-ssee., after Hunt had made
a mess of things by trying to sprint over the final
220yds.; and W. H. Hutton (N.S.W.) took the
second in 52sec. from B. J. Limehan (Vic.), who
came with a lucky burst at the tape and caught
Piggot (N.S.W.) slowing up. In the final the
sinewy Linehan made the others look second-raters
and won by six yards in 53 2-ssec. W. H. Brown
(Vic.) took the mile comfortably from the long-
striding A. W. Dormer (M.L.) in 4min. 36sec.
Brown’s even gait and judgment broke up his field.
H. Grandemange and J. W. Cain (N.S.W.) filled the
other places. In the 120yds. hurdles H. E. Wilson
(M.L.) took the first heat by seven yards in 16sec.,
and in the final, after leading all the way, won by
three yards in 15 9-10 see. from L. F. Edmunds
(Vic.) and K. B. Fraser (N.S.W.). The wonderful
Maorilander skims the hurdles in the straight-leg
style. The three-mile walk was the drab item, and
G. R. Parker (N.S.W.) won easily in 22min. 45
4-ssec. from Bob Stokes (N.S.W.) and A. B. Siev-
wright (M.L.).
In the field events P. Munro (M.L.) provided an
eye-opener with a 161 b. shot putt of 43ft. 4in.,
Which outdistanced the best efforts of K. J. Naukler
(N.S.W.), 37ft. and F. L. Edmunds (Vic.),
35ft. lliin. Munro’s try-outs were remarkably even
—4oft. 9in., 42ft. llin. and 42ft. 6Jin. R. J.
Honnor (N.S.W.) did 22ft. 6in. in the broad jump,
with H. E. Wilson (M.L.), 21ft. next. After
a protracted contest, G. Harvey (M.L.) won the
pole vault, with 10ft. 9in., against G. W. Gorman’s
10ft. Bin. A. Floyd (N.S.W.) fell heavily at 10ft.
All amateur records stood the strain, and the only
improvement on the last championship times (1914)
was Hunt’s one-fifth second off Parker’s (U.S.A.)
figures. Another strange fact was that none of the
winner’s had previously won an Australasian title.
* * * *
Jack Sommers, now of Sydney, and origin-
ally of M.L., who has been artist, Digger and
journalist, has decided to abandon all else for
portrait-painting. He went north the other day
and came back with the counterfeit presentment in
oils of that prince of sportsmen, Ross Smith. It
will be on exhibition at Farmers’ (Sydney) during
the week.
The invading cyclists sprang another
series of match races oil Sydney last week. Over
two miles R. J. McNamara defeated Alf Grenda in
straight heats (paced) and W. Spencer did likewise.
A pursuit whirl between A. Mcßeath, Priestley and
Walker (Aus.), and C. Osteritter, H. Ohrt and F.
Corry (America) caused excitement. The Aussies
won after 31 miles in 6min. 40sec. In the five
mile scratch races Alf Grenda and Alec Mcßeath
each had a victory.
Melbourne tennis followers will get a
chance to inspect Britain’s Davis Cup team at the
Albert Ground to-morrow and Saturday. The British
trio will play against a strong Victorian three—
O’Hara Wood, Hawkes and Wertheim—in an attrac-
tive programme of matches. O’Hara Wood will have
the pleasure of singles matches with Beamish and
Kingscote, and will attack the pair in the doubles
with the assistance of young Hawkes, who also part-
ners Wertheim in another doubles struggle with
the hardworking Kingscote associated with Lowe.
Kingscote will also face the lengthy Wertheim, and
if he wins every battle he will do a large two-
days’ work.
Dear B., — Re the Davis Cup and the
business methods of the people in control, did they
ever hear of a contract that is bad in law and
hence no contract? English railway cos. used, in
my time, to issue tickets “subject to the Company’s
by-laws and regulations” which contracted out of all
responsibilities ; yet no one ever heard of an English
railway co. fighting any reasonable claim for dam-
age due to accident. The same (only more so)
applies to passenger shipping cos. If persons selling
tickets for amusements stick to the price thereof
in spite of the fact that they do not carry out their
side of the contract, I submit, with all respect, that
this is not only a “senseless arrangement” but a
contract that is bad in law, and the public has not
“got to take it or leave it,” but simply to sue for
a refund and get it. Now, my learned friends?—
Yours, Dr. Nil.
One of Victoria’s new Senate three —
Guthrie—finds pleasure in coursing. He has fol-
lowed the dogs for many years, and can recite the
family tree of the best specimens almost back to
the founder who got shelter with Noah.
For centuries the Protestant churches have
been fighting against the tendency of the young and
casual to play games on the Sabbath. Last week the
Anglican Synod at Goulburn (N.S.W.) inserted the
thin end of the secularisation wedge by deciding
that tennis was allowable—after the relaxation had
been paid for by attendance at church. However,
the business is still in the discriminatory stage.
One minister told how, in his parish, an R.C. trustee
gave permission for football to be played on a
certain ground on Sunday. He was warned, but he
merely scoffed. What happened? A player was
killed! Obviously the youth had been immolated by
Providence as a sign. “The funeral was atttended
by 400 men who afterwards gave him their word of
honor never again to play football on a Sunday.
The men now engaged in cricket.” No one has
thus far been exterminated while playing Sunday
cricket, so presumably the summer game is accept-
able to the powers above. And if cricket why not
bowls and croquet? The mind of official Anglicanism
is apparently open on certain aspects of the ques-
tion. But it seems solid on one issue: No pray no
play.
* * # *
Governor Galway, who has just left
Adelaide, had played most games before coming to
Australia, but bowls was new to him, and he soon
got among the best. Being farewelled by the players
in Adelaide he, with rifle-shot Lance Addison and
cricketers Clem and Roy Hill, gave an awful beat-
ing to a team led by S. .T. Jacobs, president of the
Bowls Association. He also promised to hunt up
opportunities for playing in England. They are
likely to take some hunting. England’s Nicest know
nothing of the game. An old set of bowls may lie
about on a country-house lawn, but anything like
a club is apt to depend on the green attached to a
country pub.
* * * *
“H.S.H.”; One of the favorite pastimes
of the Light Horsemen on furlough in England was
to line the rails in Hyde Park and criticise the
performances of passing cavaliers. Many a rider
found it a very rotten row to hoe, this canter over
the tan while trying to look unconcerned amid ex-
hortations to “Get off his neck 1 ” and the like. But
a good mount and a good seat were always oertain
of a good reception. The English crowd, though less
apt to barrack, is more one-eyed. Last summer in
England I was at Henley, Wimbledon, Lords and
the Oval, and everywhere I found that the attitude
of the majority was utter lack of appreciation of
opponents’ effoi'ts. And this unhealthy spirit the
English press does its best to foster. Patterson won
as he liked on every occasion, yet received very poor
notices. The A.I.F. crew won at Henley after a
good race, but the papers were full of insinuations
about the course steered. When a short ball from
Gregory hit a batsman in the ribs the barrackers
howled and reckoned he did it purposely. And
now I can imagine the kind of article in the
English sporting press that Kingseote’s foot-faulting
fn the Davis Oup will bring forth. Thev’ll talk it
over from every angle until the British public is
thoroughly convinced that but for this the English
team would have lifted the Cup.
* * *
“N.C.” : It’s time they got a new scoring-
board at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The existing
affair is a cross between a weather-beaten coffee-
stall and the skillion of O’Kelly’s Dynamite Hotel at
Dingo Crossing. The painted signs “Batsmen.”
“Bowlers,” etc., are nearly illegible, and the crazy
structure is a blot on the proceedings. To match
the board the figures are hoisted in a languid,
dreamy sort of way, and a retiring batsmen is often
having a rub-down in the pavilion, and his successor
has taken strike, before the individual score and
total has been posted under “Wickets For .”
THE LONE FISHERMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He sits upon the pier-head, and he gazes at the sea.
And every day he’s squatting there, however hot it
be;
However cold he crouches there, all muffled to the
throat,
11 is fioh-line in his fingers, and his eyes upon the float.
He s little, and he’s old and grey, he’s on familiar
terms
AVith scraps of smelly mussel, and with little bits
of worms.
A bottle full of tea he has, some grub that’s out of
date,
A basket for his flathead, and a pannikin of bait.
He has the eyes that do not see, the ears that do not
hear.
When sounds the trump of Gabriel ’twill find him
on the pier.
When all the dead are gathered up and booms the
final drum,
He 11 fish and fish and never dream the Resurrection's
come.
What friends he has I do not know, and he does not
invite
My confidence. I fancy, though, he fishes all the
night.
No time he has to eat his fish, whatever may befall;
But as he rarely catches fish that matters not at all.
I heard him in his wrath one day, a mullet on his
hook,
And he spat such curious curses that I saved them
for a book.
He said: “I wish I knowed a place around this dis-
trick, mate,
Where there’s no gaudy fish to come and spile a
feller’s bait!”

For
Australian Homes
In many Australian
Homes and stores where
imported Carbide was
previously used for
acetylene lighting,
“Tasma” Carbide, the
Australian carbide, has
proved to be equal to
the best European and
Eastern carbide pro-
duced. It possesses
an exceptionally high
percentage in gas pro-
duction, and as a con-
sequence is most
economical in use.
Its illumination is
brilliant and steady,
and it is quite free from
phosphorus. For light-
ing your home and
vehicles specify “Tas-
ma" Carbide—by so
doing you benefit Aus-
tralian industry and
benefit yourself. Made

Henceforth, the recent Federal elections

Mrs. Hughes intends to give her poor nerves

It was a shock to the Melbourne friends
of Jack Pennefather when the news came
tnrough that he had adjourned sine die at
vYangaratta, where he was P.M. He was
only 08, and heart trouble was the ailment.
When assistant clerk of courts in Mel-
bourne he knew everybody, and, being a

Mrs. Pearce says that what she noticed
most about the young Prince of Wales was
the care he took of his old grandmother. When-
ever he can manage it Queen Alexandra,
now very shaky,’ makes her appearance in
public on his arm. The King and Queen
first, then Alexandra moving slowly with
her grandson The Prince helps her, too, in
the general conversation. Alexandra is still
very sensitive about her deafness. When
people speak to her she smiles and makes a
continual chant of “Yes, yes—yes —yes,
yes.”
Birdwood has had one short spell from
the function job. He had a peaceful time
with the Lieut.-Governor Irvines at the
Macedon vice-regal cottage.
Mayoress Mrs. Stein gave a little party
to Mrs. Moulden, the Mayoress of Adelaide,
on Friday, and the council room and the
boudoir of the Town Hall were both filled
with a wonderful parade of fine feathers.
Among her other glories the guest of honor
had a walking-stick with an ivory handle
studded with gems. Mrs. Stein’s frocks are
always chiffon visions; this time she wore
several layers of buff-colored georgette. A
few men came to the chatter.
The Peter Mitchells, of Bringenbrong, in
Riverina, have pulled up at Menzies’ after
a long American tour. Peter Mitchell still
owns Trafalgar, the famous chestnut gal-
loper of years ago. The old champion grazes
in the pet paddock of the run.
General Elliott was another large Apple
Islander who crossed Bass Strait in the
little sailer Grace Darling, all steamer com-
munication being stopped by the engineers’
strike. He came over to greet Birdwood.
The Harry Watsons have sold Tooma,
their Riverina station, and will be lost to
Victoria. Moss Vale on the N.S'.W. side, is
to be their new abode.
General Burston has been missing from
the ranks of generals who are seen at every
Birdwood party. He has been seriously ill
and is only just past the danger-line. Mrs.
Burston has shut herself in as nurse-in-
ehief.
Bachelor Dr. Nihill, of Collins-street, has
been doing dangerous work—for a bachelor.
At Portsea, where the Naieest are surfing,
he rescued a lady from drowning. After the
incident the hon. life-saver hurried back by
motor to his zinnias and delphiniums.
Lord Plunket, just dead, was Governor of
Maoriland when the Dominion was enter-
taining groups of tribes from all the neigh-
boring islands. There were numerous
ceremonies in which his Ex. was the figure-
head. One was the presentation of medals
as decorations to some Fijians. Plunket
didn’t like the job and couldn’t help showing
it. During the presentation the thin little
man remained seated in his chair. He would
hold out the ribboned medal at the full
stretch of his arm while his nose wrinkled
superciliously. Each dignified bi’own brother
was checked in his advance and received his
bauble from the Governor’s finger-tips. Then
he strode off, wondering greatly, to find some
place on his half-clothed body on which to
pin the brooch. Lord Plunket’s widow is
a sister of Lady Helen.
Mrs. Acting Mayoress Stein’s husband
appeared at the last party, but kept deter-
minedly in the background in spite of Uncle
Aikman’s introduction. The Gaud Mayor
made efforts to drag him into a speech, but
Stein smiled quietly in his corner and let his
decorative wife do the dazzling.
Oommendatore Grossardi is our new

A shindykit, whose capital last week was
spoken of in thousands, but has now become
millions, is' endeavoring to purchase several
leading supper factories with the object of
providing Melbourne with a jazz palace. A
yarn in circulation that the Australia had
been bought for £40,000 is vigorously denied
by manager Lucas, but undoubtedly some-
thing is doing or about to be done. Infor-
mation 6f a less precise nature may be ex-
pected at any moment.
The house shortage troubles all sorts of
people. Mrs. W. M. Hughes says she is
hunting for a home in Studley Park—not a
princely mansion, please, but a nice, cosy
home suitable " r a household containing one
small Prime Minister. Studley Park is
favored as being handy, yet far from the
maddinsr crowd that wants to know about
profiteers, tariffs, etc..
Charles Barrett,
late of Melbourne
Hekald and now one
of historian Charley
Bean’s assistants, is
getting another
natural-history book
ready. Not a collec-
tor but an observer,
he has found unsus-
pected wonders in
our bird and , plant
life that have only
inflamed his passion
for his chosen science.
Barrett is the mov-
ing spirit of the Bird
Observers’ and the
Nature Photograph-
ers’ Clubs and plays
a star part in the Ornithological Union,
whilst maintaining a valuable connection
with the Zoological Society of London. Hard
work as a member of the Camel Field Ambu-
lance in Palestine and Egypt took him off the
trail of the lower creation for three years,
but while he was away he seized every oppor-
tunity to study Egyptian reptiles, and some-
times harbored specimens in his tent which
made cobbers suspect that they had been
handed an elephant’s rum ration.
General Chauvel and his lady were
amongst those who delighted to honor Bird-
wood. They did it at Yarra House, and Mel-
bourne’s brass hats and 400 others were
invited. The youthful hostess was in blue
silk of Damascus.
( The Everard Brownes will spend the next
12 months at Tograk, where they have hired
Mrs. Charles Moore’s house, Werrima. It
was formerly the Italian-gardened home of

the place Merriwee.
Dame Bridges, widow of the Anzac
General, is just convalescent after six
months’ illness. In April, with younger

After four years’ work in France and in
British military hospitals, Mary Rawson is
resting in the family home at Kyneton. She
is the eldest daughter of Hugh Rawson, a
local chieftain, and formerly member for
the district in the Assembly. Mary got her
preliminary training in the Kvneton Hos-
pital, and subsequent experience in Aus-
tralia and imgl&nd GQuippcd her for war
work. She was attached to the nursing staff
m the hospital where the knighted Douglas
Shields was boss surgeon, and latterly was
m an American Red Cross Hospital.
Brothers Gerald and Hugh served with dis-
tinction in the war. Gerald is among the
unreturning brave.
General Monash has associated himself
with the small group that protests against
the old cemetery at West Melbourne being
used as a site for the extension of the Vic-
toria-street market. There is not, however,
much hope of the repeal of the Act authoris-
ing this removal of the bones of the pioneers.
A commission recommended the change, and
the pious Hutchinson piloted the bill through
the Assembly. Another bill, of which
Rogers, member for Melbourne, was spon-
sor, sought to repeal the Act. but it was
rejected on a test vote at the first stage.
B. M. o’Connox•,
late of the 35th, who
won the M.C. and
M.M. in the process
of shoving the Hun
back, had another in-
teresting hobby. He
hunted assiduously
for photographic
souvenirs, and even
out of the litter of
Fritz’s pockets h:
has rescued some
crumpled snapshots
that proved to have
immense pictorial
value. One of his
huge studies show-
ing the Kaiser in-
specting the Prus-
sian Guard before
the second battle of Ypres was enlarged
from three-quarters of an inch of cinema film
yielded up by a prisoner. Another view of the
Huns which measures lift, by 3ft. 6in. is the
expanded record of a vest pocket kodak,
Avhilst his biggest effort, a panorama of the
Belgian front, 45ft. by 2ft. 6in., was origin-
ally caught by an airman’s camera. O’Connor
photoed many subjects himself, and though
he took great risks he received greater pro-
vocation, as some of the smaller studies in
his exhibition reveal. His show moves shortly
from the Fine Art Society to Sydney.
Adelaide’s seven days :—
Concerning the appointment of our new Governor.
When war broke out, and the Weigalis equipped and
ran their home in Lincolnshire as a military hospital,
Sister Rosalind Stow, of Adelaide, was in charge, and
another Adelaidean, Nurse Hodge, was second-in-
connnand. The Weigalis have one small daughter—
Patricia, aged six.
Meanwhile Governor Galway continues his good-
byes. Bowlers wished him fine luck, and the
Adelaide Club said much the same kind of thing at
dinner. Next he lunched with the Commonwealth
Club, and in the afternoon presided at what will
be his last public meeting—one in the Mayor’s parlor
to launch the Boy Scouts’ endowment fund.
The Nestor steamed away with an assortment of
Adelaide folk. Amongst those who waved good-bye
across the rail were the F. H. Snows and their
daughter, who have no definite plans beyond a
lengthy trip ; Mr. and Mrs. Owen Smyth, Miss Horna-
brook and Miss Vere Hopwood, the Queen Adelaide
Club’s secretary. (She plans to be back at the end
of the year.) Dr. Helen Mayo will see America as
well as England before she comes back. Miss Nora
Stewart is also on her way to London, to pick up
the latest steps and dance crazes for her winter
classes here.
Woe is us, and in the jam season, too! No white
sugar after Friday! The shortage is one of the
effects of the strike, and every day the Coal Board
gets a little more definite about impending restric-
tions on gas and electric light.
The news that Sir Robert Affieck is dead and that
the baronetcy goes to his brother John takes memory
back to the days when a Book Lovers’ Library (since
defunct) was opened here. It was owned and run
by Mrs. Affleck, wife of the new baronet, who before
her marriage was Blanche Robson, of Sydney. Her
husband in those days was an almost helpless invalid.
They sold the library when they left here for Eng-
land 15 years ago.
Our Fire Brigade has had the queer experience of
being bombed with boiling jam. The McEwen factory
in East Adelaide was burned out early one morn-
ing. Tons of sugar blazed furiously, and tins of
jam, exploding with the intense heat, flew furiously
all over the place. Two firemen, caught in one
Conner, saved their lives only by abandoning ladder
and hose.
Benno Moiseiwitsch, the Russian pianist who per-
suaded Adelaide violinist Daisy Kennedy to make
her name less pronounceable, will come to Australia
in May next. He is now in America repeating his
English successes, and J. Nevin Tait has made a
contract with him in N’York to play before the
people of his wife’s native country.
Adelaide’s father of music, Reimann, head-teacher
of piano at the Conservatorium, leaves early this
month for a holiday in England. He has been teach-
ing in Adelaide for the last 45 years. Maude Puddy,
who recently returned home, will carry on while the
Old Master is away.
Port Adelaide has just lost its energetic Sidney
Malin, who had been its mayor and most other
things. He was 68 at the end.
Catherine Austin, daughter of the Eilyer
Austins, is wearing a solitaire diamond ring
Billy Bowie, of Aiandeville Hall, Toorak, j s
the lucky man. Brother Captain Tom Aus-
tin is also in the engagement boom. His
fiancee is Alice Allanby, daughter of th<-
late Archdeacon Allanby, of Ballarat, and
Airs. Allanby, of Croydon, Surrey (Eng.).
Toorak Anglican Church was packed with
the Dressed to hear Aubrey Officer and
Isobei Nankivell exchange vows. The bride
did her part in white georgette draperies
under a trained veil of white embroidered
net lent by her cousin, Mrs. Alec. Creswick.
Little Mary Grey-Smith, in white and pink
chiffonery, made a pocket-edition bridesmaid.
The bridegroom went to the war early in
1915 with the 17th Battalion, and got back
at the end of 1919 after a two-years’ ex-
perience of Hun prison camps. Many boxes
will be needed to get the wedding presents
to the N.S.W. station. The groom is the
elder surviving son of the late squatter
Charles Officer, M.L.A. Bride Isobel’s late
mother was a daughter of the late Dr.
Wilkie, Melbourne’s leading medico of the
’7o’s. One Wilkie girl is the wife of Major-
General Rainsford Hannay, who once decor-
ated the Victorian stall'. Another is the
widow of baronet Robert Baillie, formerly of
Melbourne. Another Wilkie daughter is'the
widow of the late Pat Agnew, secretary (in
the ’Bo’s) of the Melbourne Club.
Handsome Lea Halinbourg (she is now
Airs. Prank Drexler) has been displaying
her newly-acquired husband to Melbourne
friends before taking him to Dutch New
Guinea, which will be her future home. This
is Lea’s second matrimonial venture. While
in England she became Mrs. James Grilles,
but in a few weeks was a war widow.
The Army Nurses’ Club’s reception to
Birdy at the Grand Hotel was attended by
200 Nightingales, mostly in mess dress.
Some appeared in civvies, one lady explain-
ing to Birdwood that she had outgrown her
martial attire. Lady Helen was present in
mourning owing to the death of her brother,
Lord Plunket; the Clmuvel lady was
smartly varbed in dull gold tissue, and the
Billy Hughes and Cuscaden wives were
there. The new French Consul and
his pretty, girlish-looking wife attracted
much notice. While the show was in pro-
gress upstairs a military wedding-breakfast
was happening below, the principal per-
formers being Sister Doris Barry and Cap-
tain AV. C. Scurry, M.C., D.S.O. A sister
collected the leading members of the party,
and while Birdy was sipping tea a bridal
procession entered the room. The couple
were introduced, and Birdwood and Lady
Helen made the pleasant remarks expected
of them.
\ vonne Deschamps, daughter of the steel
man. has gone to Rome to study music.
While travelling she was robbed of her pre-
cious violin and all her jewels—gifts from
her father. He has just been in Melbourne
for a week.
Flo Young, whose face was recently-
damaged in a motoring accident, is now out
of hospital, and on Friday night shared a
box with Airs. Tallis at “Alother Hubbard.”
The house gave her a welcome, and come-
dian Jack Cannot made comic love to her
from the stage.
A fancy dress and masked ball is to hap-
pen at the King’s, after the show on Satur-
day, in aid of the children’s orphanages.
A committee of performers from all the
theatres will manage the affair, Gertie
Latchford-Lupino being president, and
dancer Daisy Yates and Ethel Walker
(“Mother Hubbard’s” Fairy Queen) secre-
taries. Double tickets are a guinea, and
Otto Falkener has handed in his cheque for
£lOO to help.
The Royal tried to pretend that it was
Her Alajesty’s on Saturday night, when
“Kissing Time” arrived. The bright, dressy
show kept the Best People from supper until
nearly half-past eleven. The Tallises occu-
pied the managerial pen, while in the oppo-
site compartment Airs. Geoff Syme, who was
accompanied by her English sister, Aliss Gar-
nett, hid herself behind an ostrich-fan punka.
In a stalls box were the Rupert Atkinsons,
lately back from the U.S., and Tommy Coch-
ran, whose social duties seem to be wearing
him to a shadow. Gladys Aloncrieff’s appear-
ance in the last act in a crinoline of the type
which is threatened with popularity in Lon-
don drew all opera-glasses in her direction,
while the males who had paid for the glasses
became restless, being anxious to make a
more detailed examination of Louise Larrson,
the new star dancer, who was—er —not wear-
ing a crinoline. The male members of the
co. were hopelessly behind the times as re-
gards freak fashions, no ruffles, knee-breeches
or strawbe. -y-colored evening suits being
visible.
Arthur N. Bishop, the brainy, busy son
of an archdeacon who is brainy and busy
too, has been up North looking for markets
for Australian goods and finding them. Not
in Japjan—in China. In Hongkong he
talked Australia to a firm- whose three
directors are accredited millionaires —talked
Australia until they booked him at a salary
that a Prime Alinister doesn’t get, to come
South and send them stuff to compete with
American and Jap products.

An advance display of model gowns shows
that the tailored suit of the winter will be
straight, narrow and short of skirt, while
the coat will be of much length and but-
toned to the chin. But prices—well, 39s 6d
a week won’t run to more than a button-hoD
or so. One tailor-made suit that passed
muster is a gift at £4:9 10s. Evening gowns
betray signs of fading away until they are
merely skirts and a belt of velvet hitched
over the shoulders, with a string of beads.
A studied opulence marks the materials, and
even the charm of fichu-like draperies on an
evening gown is marred by a fussiness of
tumcked skirt suggestive of the pantomime
fairy.
His Ex. and Lady Davidson will give a
garden party on April 8 in honor of Bird-
wood; and there will also be several dinner
parties- the Mayor will make a gorgeous
spread at the Town Hall, and the Imperial
Service, Australian, Union and New South
Wales Clubs and the British Empire League
all want to feed him. Even the Millions
Club asks to be allowed to make him the
excuse for a little more trumpeting.
Sir Henry Galway, retiring Gov. of South
Aus., arrives in Sydney on February 11 and
sails next day for England ; and if ever an
Excellency deserved a parting cheer he does.
Painters and decorators have started to
get Government House ready for the Prince
and the adioiriing bunsralow for his staff.
The Prince will occupy the same rooms as
ma and pa did when they visited Australia.
Tt is surmised, that the Government has
purchased Kirribilli House to accommodate
the Prince with his staff should he be the
guest of the G.-G. while in Sydney. Admir-
alty House barely accommodates the G.-G.
and his own little lot.
Looked into Sydney on her way back to
Toganmain station* Hay, Mrs. J. S. Robert-
son, with a store of memories of her journeys
up north—a north that took in Pekin and
Tientsin and the Legation set as well as
the touring-car and cabaret in crowded
Shanghai. At Pekin the days pass with the
fiuiet dignity dictated by the Legation set.
Hiding and dinner-parties on the wall of the
city are the outstanding feature of its enter-
tainments. But even here the cabaret with
its jazz and the once-more popular waltz is
a well-established fact. In Pekin and Tien-
tsin many of the younger official Chinese
have European wives, who go everywhere and
are received by everybody. For the most
part the houses are built in the Chinese
fashion around a court made gay with
flowers and stunted trees and fountains
where goldfish flash in the Altered sunlight.
The educated-abroad Chinese, man and girl,
stick to the Western style of dress —the girls
from the English and American finisliing
schools have developed the purest Parisian
clothes-sense. In the gaily-painted, heavily-
gilded streets of the native quarter pretty
Chinese ladies still trip about in the
black pants and heavily-embroidered coat of
old times, while the mandarin, fan in hand,
or thrust through his belt, walks in his coat
of heavy white silk, which fashion now
decrees shall be perfectly plain, to the home
of his No. 2or No. 3 wife. And this is where
Western ideas are going to hit father; for
the young Chinese woman, standing on her
natural-sized feet, is demanding her rights—
is indeed making public speeches about them
-—and the first thing she demands is mono-
gamy.
Chinese women are going in for every-
thing : having learned her job in England
and America, one damsel is opening a flying
school in Pekin, and the aerial mail service
between the North and the South will be run-
ning before the year is out. When the Chinese
think a European is becoming too powerful
they kill him with kindness. They shove
him into some job that keeps him too busy
to be much before the public. So they made
Dr. Morrison an adviser to the Government,
and Lucas, who followed him on the Times,
they have just made director of tHe Bank of
China.
On one of her excursions to the native
quarter of Yokohama Mrs. Robertson and
her party met other sight-seeing Australians,
among them Mrs. Libby Hordern. And then
there was a party of Russians that included
the wife of General Siminoff, a singer with
a glorious voice from the Opera House of
St. Petersburg and some Cossack officers.
The Russians had come over from Harbin
for the summer. Harbin is now the refuge
of the Russian aristo. fleeing from the Bol-
shie. Cabarets are thick as mushrooms in
a feverishly gay and reckless city.
In the passage from Korea to Japan Mrs.
Robertson and her friend, Miss Wheeler, had
a taste of Japanese feeling towards Austra-
lians. The passage, which takes a night,
had a two days’ quarantine tacked on to it,
and during those 48 hours the Jap attendants
•would scarcely do a thing for the Australian
women—refused to bring them afternoon tea,
and when they were leaving the boat would
not carry their baggage off for them.
Sister ( Matron) Alice Cashin, who has
a bar to her Royal Red Cross and five years’
war service to her credit, was a trainee of
St. Vincent’s Hospital. Her war-job kept
her a year in France, another in Egypt and
a third on the sea', with the matronship of
the big Lichfield Military Hospital filling
the final two years. Her experiences in-
cluded the torpedoing of the Gloucester
Castle (with wounded aboard), of which she
was matron. Besides her double decoration
and war-service ribbons, sister brought back
a set of furs (cape, muff and cap), a gift
from Queen Alexandra in the first winter of
the war to each of the Imperial Military
Nursing Service Reserve. Another remem-
brance highly prized by this Australian
army nurse is a gold link bracelet, inscribed
with her war record, a farewell presentation
from the nursing staff of the Lichfield Hos-
pital.
Dr. Elizabeth Ilainilton-Browne, some
few years ago associated with Dr. Voss at
Rockhampton, has, under the auspices of the
Women’s Medical Mission, taken her stethe-
scope from Endell-street Military Hospital
(London) to the Women’s Hospital at
Jubbulpore in the Central Provinces of
India. The daughter of Major Hamilton-
Browne, of Rose Bay, himself a D.S.O. of
the Boer War, she threw in her lot with the
A.M.C. in Egypt during the second year of
the war, and the signing of the Armistice
found her still in France.
The Primate leaves by the Osterley on
March 20 for England to attend the Lam-
beth conference. Mrs. Wright goes with the
Archgaiters to busy herself with Girls’
Friendly Society, Mothers’ Unions and other
Church work. Second daughter Norali, a
University degree (with honors) fresh upon
her, and youngest daughter Isabel, the artist
of the family, accompany them. En route
they hope to make pilgrimage to the memo-
rials raised to Australian soldiers in France,
and will also spend a week in Italy. They
expect to return to Sydney in November.
Regina Pfeiffer, who shortly weds Lieut.
Harold Allen, late of the 54th, is being
given a series of color gift-teas as varied
as Joseph’s coat. Bride-elect and bride-
groom hail from North Queensland —the
Townsville-Charters Towers part of it. Papa
Pfeiffer pursued the dollar in the rough
most successfully, and the wedding will be
dressed and celebrated accordingly. The
ceremony and Nuptial Mass at St. Mary’s
will have an elaborate floral schenie.
The first marriage to be celebrated in
Australia by the Apostolic delegate will be
that of Nora Nugent, of Clonmel, Ireland,
a sister of the late Mrs. Tom Dalton, of
Wheatleigh, North Sydney, to Dr. Power, at
St. Mary’s, next Wednesday. Bride’s
brother-in-law, Tom Daltop, gives her away,
and Marjory Dalton, of Orange, attends her.
Brig.-General Jobson’s sister Nancy
dropped in on Sydney
from Maoriland en
route to Queensland,
where she will take
command of the
Presbyterian Ladies’
College at Too-
woomba. Lately
she has been princi-
pal of Queen Mar-
garet’s College at
Wellington. While in
Sydney she stayed
with the Barton
Addisons, of Mos-
man, and got an ink-
ling of N. S. Wales
politics from a
chosen farmers’ can-
didate. Barton Ad-
dison will contest
the Nepean seat.
Monty Stephen is engaged to Miss Hos-
kins, a Maorilander, who L in Sydney with
her family. Her father is a well-
known North Island Judge: his Is Consett
Stephen, one of the sons of the late Chief
Justice and senior partner in the firm ol
Stephen, Jaques and Stephen. The young
man is a member of the family firm, and in
his leisure moments one of Sydney’s
best dancers and most popular best-men.
He was rejected for the army on account
of his short sight, but his brilliant, younger
brother, Adrian, joined the R.F.A., and after
serving with distinction was killed.
Last Thursday, at St. Philip’s, Canon
Bellingham tied Mrs. Lane (widow of Major
Lane) to Lieut. Postle. Mrs. Maclurcan
(bride’s mother) and sister Mrs. Spencer
Watts were witnesses. Lieut, and Mrs.
Postle left same day for Maoriland.
To-morrow sees the ringing down of the
curtain upon the last effort of that fine and
brilliantly-successful war organisation, the
French-Australian League of Help. In the
afternoon, at the French Consulate, will be
read the final balance-sheet, and the money
left in the till will be handed to Consul-
General Campana for the Red Cross in
Paris. Mrs. Arthur Jewett and E. S.
Marks, combined secretaries of the France’s
Day Fund, have convened the meeting.
Visiting Sydney on a long holiday is A.
B. Wallace, Minister for Works at Nukua-
lofa, Tonga; he is accompanied by Mrs.
Wallace. During the ’flu epidemic which
raged fiercelv in these islands Mr. Wallace,
with the British Consul, did some heroic
work.
The K. Luise brought back Rene Maxwell
of the beautiful soprano voice. A few years
ago she was a flapper singing to the waiting
throng in the family circle during the Quin-
lan opera season. She comes back a singer
with a London reputation. Her notes will
be unpacked for inspection at Sydney Town
Hall three times this month. Contralto
Nathalie Rosenwax, who guided Miss Max-
well’s first vocal efforts, accompanies her
back home. By the way, these Maxwell con-
certs are concert-manager Jack Brownlow’s
first venture on his really-and-truly own
account.
You must know Matron Creal. just re-
turned after nearly four years’ active ser-
vice, with an R.R.C.
(Ist class) handed
her by George him-
self at Buckingham
Palace. She was
matron of the 14th
A.G.H. in Egypt,
and, like a good Aus-
tralian, appreciated
the privilege of
nursing her own
countrymen. Ross
Smith was one of
her patients. The
popular woman with
the pretty Irish grey
eyes is spending her
furlough on the
Blue Mountains be-
f o r e resuming the
post she left as mat-
ron of Sydney Hospital.
A surprise packet is likely to appear this
season in a soprano who is at present
trilling and learning the beauty of the
legato under the guidance of Mrs. Hugh
Ward.
David Storey’s hat will be seen no more
in the Assembly; he takes it to the Council,
and no sort of millinery calls for remark
there—patriarchs are permitted to cover
their baldness as they please. It was at
Storey’s hat that Edmund Barton flung his
bitterest gibe. He was feeling very sore
over his defeat in Randwick. “Yes,” he said,
“beaten —beaten by a man with a thousand
hats and not brains enough to fill one of
them.” But if he vyasn’t a great statesman
the House soon got to know David Storey
as a good fellow.
“Sandy” Jaques, the barrister, was en-
dorsed last week as a Soldiers’ candidate
for one of the Eastern Suburbs seats in the
State Parliament. He was beaten on the
post in the same place shortly before the
war, but since then he has sacrificed a leg,
and. that ought to be worth more than many
canvassers.
The Jack Bruntons had an unusual tea-
party last week at Gladwood, which used
to be Glenyarrah in the Kellys’ day. in
the spacious set of ground-floor rooms look-
ing out on Double Bay were the sporting
pictures which Mr. Brunton recently
brought back from England ; and the guests
were the racing officials who are to take
most of them over on behalf of their clubs.
One of the best of the portraits is that of
Admiral Rous, a small, dictatorial sports-
man who was famous for half a century at
Newmarket as “The Skipper.” A notable
horse-picture is that of Flying Fox, a Derby
winner of the dead-and-gone period before
jockeys learned to crouch. The seat of
Mornington Cannon, who usually rode him,
would not disgrace a present-day Light
Horseman.
Mosman carnivalled in moderation on
Saturday night in aid of the North Shore
Hospital. Twinkling electric lights and
Japanese lanterns decorated the foreshores
from Bradley’s Head to Cremornc Point,
while the bay itself was dotted with lan-
terned boats with gay companies aboard,
and the music—at an„v rate, the sound —of
ukelele, mandoline, brass bands and song
filled the air. The Mosman Musica l So-
ciety and the Gallipoli and Police Bands
made musical accompaniment to the jingle
of the collection-boxes passed among the
merry-makers. Because it was a post-
poned ceremony the illuminations were not
what they were on former occasions; still
a radiant moon and a velvety evening made
the annual effort joyous.
After finishing his work in the field, Aus-
tralian painter George Lambert got back to
London with a boxful of military trapnings,
including a feathered Light Horse hat. Some
time ago he called in at the Chelsea Arts
Club with ’em all on. “Hullo, Lambert.”
said somebody, “has the war started all
over again?” Lambert preened himself And
replied stiffly, “No, I had some official cor-
respondence to attend to.” Nothing like
getting the right “atmosphere”!
The Voluntary Workers Cafe in Elizabeth-
street is making a corner in flying men.
Captain Oswald Watt started the fashion by
dining there at least once a week ; now every
airman who loops into Sydney gravitates to
the tearoom with the wonderful record. Ross
Smith is to be given a great luncheon there.
A note from Bathurst: —
Woman’s Letter (29/l/’2O) mentioned only some
of Bathurst’s soldiers of high rank. Lieut.-Colonel
Mclntosh (brother to solicitor John) heard the
splash of Charon’s oar in Palestine; and add
Murphy, D. 5.0., and Paul to the list of lieut.-
colonels and Darvall Barton (Dr.) to that of majors.
Mrs. Hallam has welcomed her one and
only, Corporal Basil, from the wars. He
has been in khaki since 1915, and is one of
the few Aussies who got to Persia and had
a look at its very large Shah.
“Home for Easter,” cables Captain
George Hamilton, A.A.M.C., son of Judge
Montgomerie Hamilton. While making a
good recovery from severe wounds, the young
doctor has been specialising in skin diseases,
first in Paris.* then as clinical assistant to
Sequera in London. Brother Major John,
with English wife and infant daughter, is
expected home about the same time.
Eileen Boyd should be back in Sydney
this week after a 12 months’ tour of Asia
towns: she has been with Edgar Warwick's
Vanity Fair Co. The Taiyuan brings her
home.
Some of the dailies badly need to revise
their portrait aralleries. Every time tennis
is mentioned an alleged likeness of Gerald
Patterson is thrown on the news screen.
It presents a sweet-faced mother’s boy with
a rosebud mouth and pointed chin. He
wears the diminutive striped cricket cap
of early adolescence. The reality is a typi-
cal heavyweight Digger, with a face and
jaw hard enough to stop a tram. At inter-
vals a picture of Lord Birkenhead, Lord
High Chancellor of England, appears. It
displays a smug, well-groomed youth, with
one of those lQfty turnover collars which
were the fashion some 20 years ago. The
real man has a tired and lined countenance;
his once glossy black hair is grey, and he
looks every minute of his age. which is just
on fifty. But perhaps the most absurd of
the lot is that which portrays Marconi as
he was before he lost his eye—an experi-
ence which aged him 20 years. “Paint in
the warts,” said Cromwell to the artist:
the chief business of the newspaper artist
seems to be to paint them out —especially
if the owner is on the same side in politics
or isn’t a prisoner charged with some un-
fashionable crime.
The Governor had gone up to open the
Agricultural Show, and the crowd of local
Pooh Bahs which had congregated on the
railway station to receive him contained
a baker. The sheen of his glossy top-hat
and his frock-coat’s swinging skirts made a
vision splendid. Immediately the train
arrived the glorious apparition rushed and
attached itself to the vice-regal party. The
carriage of the local potentate who had
undertaken to entertain the party stood out-
side the station, and Governor and baker
headed a procession to it. A footman flung
open the carriage door and the Governor
stepped in. In the baker’s hesitation his
Ex. thought he saw a diffident host, so he
motioned the dough-banger to a seat beside
him. Off they drove, leaving the creature
who owned the carriage to follow in a
hastily-chartered cab. At his residence the
Governor’s host took the baker for one of
the vice-regal party, the Governor thought
him the host’s bosom pal. The cat only got
out of the bag when, after a convivial even-
ing, an uproarious baker reckoned it was
time to go home and set the dough.
The publication of Mrs. Clement Shorter’s
poems—she was Dora Sigerson before she
married the editor of the Tatler —reminds
a little Irish lady in Sydney of great doings
among the Sigersons and the Justin
McCarthvs in Cork and in Dublin at the time
Parnell all but got Plome Rule for Ireland.
Dora has grown from a tomboy, whose chief
delight was to ride the wildest horse of the
district, bareback, or in gentler mood to drink
in story and song of the days when the Red
Branch Knights governed the land, into the
brilliant girl who painted and sculped and
wrote with equal ease. Her great friend at
that time was Charlotte McCarthy, youngest
and prettiest bud of the Justin McCarthy
family. Charlotte’s hero worship was all
directed to Parnell, and the Sydney woman,
then a small girl, shared it. It was a dark,
soft Irish evening, and outside the old Vic-
toria Hotel in Cork thousands waited, the
meeting lit up by torches and burning bar-
rels of pitch. Presently on to the wide slate
ledge outside his window stepped the tall man
who spoke, so the girl thought, in the most
beautiful voice she had ever heard. Next
morning Charlotte McCarthy, waiting in a
small balcony that overhung the road along
which Parnell’s carriage must pass, dropped
a bunch of roses at the great man’s feet. The
Sydney woman remembers still the rare and
beautiful smile with which he looked up to
the flushed and eager girl above. A few
months later came the tragedy that probably
cost Ireland Home Rule and led *to —who
knows what?

No song there. ... Scat: No, there’s nothing of Value
in them. .. .S.K.T.C.: Try us with something differ-
ent .... Llednoc: Not much chance of rhyming “laws”
with “pours” in this paper. Try elsewhere
H. Adcock: Perhaps there’s a meaning in it, but
it’s not visible to the naked eye H.K.: Slap-
stick rhythm is no use. .. . J.B. (Melb.) : “The Old
Yacht” came in riddled with sea slugs.... T.G.: Go
’way (P.S.: Don’t return.) H.E.H.: Cut it down
by two-thirds.... Burrundie: You have some good
matter apparently. Try to write it just as.you would talk
it;... B.W. (Kensington): Spoiled in'the telling....
G.M.K.: It’s only a sort of second cousin to verse.
... .C.R.J.L.: Too many bumps. The \er.-e must
keep to some pretence of scansion.... M.8.J.: Cinder-
ella won’t d 0... . W.H.Q.: Not a bad first attempt;
but the phrasing is commonplace. .. .Wheeler K.:
Verse not good enough.... Chris F.: The lines are
too rough and the yarn itself carries the print of
too many feet—-or the feet of too many prints....
F.G.C.: Not much hope for a parody of a parody
which misses the essentials of the original and
sometimes jumps the rails C.D.C.: “Venus” wants
better clothing to make her attractive... .R.S.
(liurstville): You seem to have chosen a different
metre for each line... .Claude K.: The verse is all
ragged and jumpy . ... Mary 0. : Only a touch of
humor could have saved E.P. (Werris Creek):
No g00d... . Alpheus: “Bad Money” doesn’t ring
g00d... .<3,8.0;-: “Her Way” is a bit too slight....
N.T. (Clayfield) : Not enough in the “Lagoon’’....
Chirrup: It would be better for a little rhythm and
a few decent phrases. .. .Vic. K.: Not a winner by
furlongs. .. .8.C.M.: “The Old Gaol Hill” is too
obviously a parody of “Where the Dead Men Lie”
....Darius: The real feeling isn’t there. .. .J.H.:
“Night Fantasy” won’t do. .. .The P.: Goes too
far round to say it.... Sting: Vpu’ve a good sense
of rhyme and a rotten sense of metre. . . .A.C.M.:
You could make them a lot better than that....
A.F.T.: Not up. ... Cynicus: Not enough marrow in
the bones. .A.H.T.: O.U.T Herbert L.: Those re-
marks are rather commonplace.... Hotham: We
couldn’t miss the beauty of this: —
The poor Belgians, they hear the guns roar,
But soon they shall suffer no more ;
When the French bring new forces,
And food and horses.
Then they shall have a happy home,
' And through dear Old England roam.
.. ..Jimana: You want “a sylvan glade whereinto
lay.” Lay what? Don’t see how the “pipes of
Pan” would help you in a laying competition....
A.T.H.: Why drag in the eglantine? Prickly pear
is much more likely... .Wangi: “The Australian
Spirit” misses.. . .Olive P.: Just the usual common-
place.... W.8.H.: “Rum Jar” doesn’t quite make
a yarn... .A.R.: Yours:—
From apprehension’s dread abode,
Through murky glooms of doubts and fears
Along a crude uncertain road,
She walked mid fogs in earlier years.
A ray of supernatural light,
Lit up the uningeniotis night,
And superstition led the waj
To meditation’s brighter day.«
Yes ; and ours:—
The dusky radiance, somewhat tart
With perspiration gone amiss,
Flamed in the pale abysmal heart
And, pangless, bore a thing like this.
.... Patty M.: There is promise there; but get real
things to write about.... The Toad: Too solemn for
the ridiculous nature of the subject; and too frivol-
ous for the bitter truth behind it.... Henry K.S.H.:
No use....A.L. (Geelong): You’ll get there....
C.E.H.: “Wird of the Sea” blew into a basket....
Eni: Yarn without beginning, middle or ending....
M.C.M.: , The battle between the dingoes and tiger-
snakes should have been done to less solemn music. ..
G.F. (Abbotsford) : The water-spider doesn’t thrill -s.
.. . .F.E.W.: The metre jumps the rails too often. .. .
Harry S.: Not enough in “The Morning Salutation.”
. ...S.T.H.: Far too many words. .. .A. Jackass:
Lamentable R.S.Y.K. : “Wants” and “Glim” won’t
do. . . .H.F.K.: You only say the old things in the
old way... .Aspiration: Not much chance when you
* rhyme “wattle” and “jostle” in faint pencil.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)

DR. SHELDON’S GIN PILLS
Make Weak Backs Strong.
The pain I suffered with my
back and kidneys for over four
years was almost unbearable. I
was advised to try Dr. Sheldon’s
Gin Pills, and I am very grateful
to say that, after taking two
boxes, I got absolute relief, and
they seemed to suit my system
perfectly. My health has im-
proved out of sight, and if you
only knew how glad I am that
my health has reaped such
great benefit you would under-
stand my writing stating how
grateful I am to Dr. Sheldon’s
Gin Pills for how they have
cured me.
You may use this testimonial
if you wish.

YOUR OWN VALUE
Every woman ought to know her own value, and how much her health, hapidneKH
and general fitness for work or enjoyment matter to those about her. Mothers are
the frame upon which the work of the world is built up, yet how can a woman prove
a cheerv, helpful wife, a wise, kind mother or a sympathetic companion it she is out
of health, over-weary or dispirited? Headaches, backaches, depressed nerves, sleep-
lessness and kindred troubles invade and break up more homes than any human fo .
You drag through your work too tired to enjoy life and even too tired to sleep vU e »•
night comes.
It is not the outside things, such as money or success, that make life happy, hut
good health and abundant spirits. You may have drifted so far down that . yo "
you will never be strong again. But good, sound health is tor all. " ,t, ‘, J
kidnevs once more acting freely, these distressing symptoms you have endured so
long will vanish. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are now doing for others what they can
us easily do for you—make life worth while. Turn over a new leaf for health and
start with I»r. Sheldon’s Gin rills to-day. They are sold in air-tight, sealed glass
containers, price 1/C and 2/6.

Candlelight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE light has failed, to the young folk's
woe.
“What shall we do the whole long
night?
We’ll have to visit a picture-show,
For we can't put up with candlelight!”
Left alone in the big armchair
The old man dreams in the yellow glow,
Seeming to picture a vision fair
That smiles from out of the long ago.
He sees her now as she goes by
And stops at the foot of the cedar stair,
Looking back with a glance half shy,
The candlelight on her gold-brown hair.
Ah! those dear days of young Romance,
When all the world before him lay ;
When she stepped out a measured dance,
Now close beside him, and then away.
“Choose your partners, bowing low,”
So went the song of the old banjo,
“Up the middle and down the side,
Each man seeking a winsome bride.”
All richly clad in rose brocade,
So dear she was and fair to see,
It seemed to him there ne’er was made
A lady lovelier than she!
As down she bent in a curtsey low
His heart beat time to the old banjo;
“Naught care I in the world beside
If only this lady will be my bride.”
The waxen stems with their golden flowers
Made pools of light on the polished floor,
And swiftly, merrily flew the hours —
Loved hours that shall return no more.
The music ended, he led her out.
Arm-in-arm to a garden nook,
Where the great magnolias all about
Were witness to the vows they took.
Since that rare night of memories
The years have gone in sun and shade;
To dust are fallen those scented trees
And dust is the lady in rose brocade.
And yet she seems so near to-night,
She smiles from out the corner dim—
Is it a trick of the candlelight
Or has his dear come back to him ?
The shadow-lady curtseys low,
He hears the song of a far banjo:
Up the middle and down the side,
Each man seeking a winsome bride.
He takes her hand as in days of yore
And off they go, and down the floor,
Tripping merrily side by side,
Handsome gallant and lovely bride!
But when the young folk climb the stair
And tip-toe in to say good-night,
They find an old man in his chair
Dreaming his dreams by candlelight.

Asking Dad.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN a man unexpectedly discovers
that his beard is white under the
chin and that his hair, for some
reason or other, has suddenly grown grey
all over, then he begins to reflect. I don’t
know how those men feel who have been in
the habit of brushing, say, seven hairs across
their baldness for years, and happen to notice
one fine morning that tw’o are unaccountably
missing (they might have been missing for
some time, but that makes no difference
now), but men of this type are generally of
a cheerful or sanguine temperament —head
clerks or managers, or men in a mild way of
business in the city; with sisters or a sister
dependent upon them. (Our tribe invariably
die with their hair on, and pretty stiff at
that, no matter how grey. It’s a brave old
hair that belongs to our tribe.)
lam not touching the hairless. They be-
long to all dispositions—-from Randolph Bed-
ford to his opposite. Those I refer to are
principally young-old men, of any station in
life, who have been in the habit of shaving
their chins all their days. For some reason
or other—a long, rough voyage in the steer-
age, or a trip out back, or in New Guinea,
or a term in quod—their razors have been
put away; and then they discover, to their
sad surprise, that they are greybeards, lhe
mild, sad surprise must be something akin to
finding yourself, while still “comparatively
a young man,” a father-in-law, with the
prospect of becoming “grandfather” in the
near future.
This brings me to what I am really writ-
ing about. A young-old friend of mine had
two charming daughters married away from
him last year; and on the first occasion some-
thing set me wondering what it felt like —in
the “humbler spheres” of life, of course
to be proposed to by your future son-in-law.
I asked my friend the other night, and he
leaned back in his chair and put one leg
up on another, and rubbed his head —rather
ruefully, I thought. His was the baldness,
with hair all round, that goes with honest
work and a domestic disposition. Say a
small contractor in the building line. He
used to chuckle in his homely-humorous,
honest-small-contractor sort of way that none
of ’em seemed in a hurry to make him a
grandfather. Did he feel so old, I wonder,
when it came home to him! Even I couldn’t
realise him as a grandfather; we never can
—till our own time comes. Well, as I said,
I asked him what it felt like to be “popped-
to” by his son-in-law—or, rather, how the
young man did it; and he leaned back in his
chair, put one leg up on another chair and
rubbed his head. Presently he stretched him-
self and said: “Ah, well —suppose we take
a stroll up to the corner?” And I let it go
at that. We took the stroll, and had the
beers; and then we said “Good night!” and
went home. One of the girls then disen-
gaged told me that her sister’s boy “took dad
out for a walk.” Perhaps dad talked to that
young man in a quiet, plain, honest-small-
contractor sort of way. And perhaps he
didn’t. Anyway, I got nothing out of him.
I appealed to one of my publishers, but
that was a mere matter of business —he
knew I was after material for a new book.
He said that wffien his first son-in-law ap-
proached him for a private interview he did
it in such a nervously earnest manner that
he (that’s my publisher) thought the young
man was going to try to get him to bring
out a book of poems.
But that’s got nothing to do with the sub-
ject in hand.
No, I’m afraid that I will never know
exactly how it feels to be proposed to by
a prospective son-in-law until I go through
the experience myself.
Now, take the experiences of my literary
friend John Lawrence. He says that when
a likely young man is particularly and
almost pointedly respectful to him, and hap-
pens to be on hand to guide, with the great-
est solicitude and respect, his erring foot-
steps home on the first night of the month,
and to listen to the beer talking with some-
thing approaching reverence; and when that
young man happens to be coming up Law-
rence’s street next morning to touch his hat
with still greater and almost pathetically
apologetic respect to Lawrence as he passes
on his way to the office—when these things
begin to happen he concludes that his young-
est unmarried daughter (a dear, sweet, pretty
girl) might be able to throw some light on
the phenomena if she liked. Lawrence says
that such a show of respect in the street is
quite refreshing, altogether dissociated from
fool-admiration for his poems, and like a
breath from high Heaven after maudlin or
bar-room hero-worship. And it makes Law-
rence feel good, and clean and high-minded.
In like manner, when a charming girl, who
is on visiting terms w r ith the Lawrence
home-circle, begins to regard him pensively,
and to hang on to every foolish utterance
that comes from Lawrence’s lips (and they
are many), as if they were words of the
highest wisdom, and when she, in her pretty
feminine way, champions Lawrence against
his family’s lack of appreciation— then
Lawrence winks at his youngest son behind
his mother’s back, to that young grammar-
school gentleman’s disgust and indignation.
Lawrence says that when the time comes
you lay your hand firmly but gently and
kindly on the young man’s shoulder, and
talk to him seriously about the cares and
responsibilities of married life. You warn
him, above all, to avoid the Curse. You do
this because, of course, you know that he
knows that you haven’t. This is a sort of
hedging. You want to be certain that the
young man is quite sure that he and Alice
are suited to each other (in temperament,
you mean). You say: “Now. / know Alice,
and I know her mother, and,” etc., etc. In
short you go on exactly like the transparent
old humbug and hypocrite you are—and
which in most cases he knows very well you
are. It’s expected of you.
He says that, sometimes, if you re honest,
you’ll mention Alice’s and her mother’s little
shortcomings in the matter of temper, while
laying great stress on their higher qualities;
and you’ll give the young man a few 7 words
of advice for his future help and guidance.
“As if that ever does any good!” Lawrence
says.
Of course you don’t inquire into the young
man's habits, position and prospects. You
know 7 all about these things already, loud
be an idiot if you didn’t. Besides, your
daughters are mostly extremely communica-
tive to Dad (uncomfortably so at times),
and your sons’ volunteered information is
reliable.
And now 7 comes in a quaint story told me
by my landlady, a Hawkesbury River native,
who has just come up with a cup of tea.
There was a young fellow went to a farmer
to ask for his daughter, and for an hour
or so they talked of all things bucolic, with
frequent long pauses; but the chawbacon
couldn’t get it out. At last the farmer took
him to see his pigs. He always did; he
took them all out. The pigs broke the ice.
“Yis!” says this young fellow, “they’re fine
pigs, there’s no doubt about it. I allers said
they w 7 as the finest I ever seed in the dees-
tric, or—or anywheres! ‘ Kin I have yer
darter?” This young couple used to sit by
the fire for an hour or so on winter’s nights
without saying anything, till at last one
would sheepishly pick up a firestick, make
. what was intended to be a playful dig at
the other, and say, “I’ll burn yer!” And
that’s how 7 they courted in the “Oxbry
district in those days.
Ah, well! When my time comes I might
do just as Lawrence and others allege they
do; or I might just pat him on the back
and say: “Oh, that’s all right, old chap.”
I dun no.
Young father-in-law (that’s the newly-
made father-in-law) sits, if he happens to
be an intelligent, honest workman, and not
one of our unhappy brotherhood —he sits
on verandah or balcony, after the wedding
and the departure, w 7 ith tired legs up on
a chair, and smokes intermittently and pon-
ders comfortably on past, present and future.
He knew his mother’s and father’s tempera-
ments and lives; he knows his own and his
wife’s; he knows his daughter’s tempera-
ment. He thinks, with wffiimsical sympathy,
perhaps, of the little jolts and jars—they
will seem mighty big things—that his new 7
son-in-law will have to get over during the
next year or two. But he is content. May-
be a remaining son pauses to lay a hand on
Dad’s shoulder and says: “How goes it,
Dad?” Or a remaining daughter perches
for a moment, before proceeding to clear up,
on the arm of Dad’s chair, and lays her arm
about Dad’s shoulders, or pats Dad’s head
in silence. And maybe the smoke will get
into Dad’s eyes. But only for a little while
—mother will buck him up.
You mostly get on well with your father-
in-law. Except when he happens to drink
chronically and is a constant instead of a
periodical and pardonable source of anxiety
to you and your wife.
But blow the blessed drink for awhile as
I sit here, on my balcony, smoking and
fumbling, half unconsciously, with a gold
compass on my watch-chain, which belonged
to my German father-in-law, whom I never
saw, and feeling a strange sort of regret
that I never did see him! They say that
he steered by compass mostly, though in
one or two little things he took after his
future son-in-law.

A Triumph of Wonderful Healing after
13 Years’ Unsuccessful Treatment.
HOW terrible are the ravages of Eczema, and how great are the disease-destroying
powers of Zam-Buk are strikingly illustrated by the experience of Mrs. Jane
Moran, of 8 Reuss Street, Leichhardt, Sydney, who says:—“For thirteen years
I endured awful agony from a dreadful attack of eczema. The disease started in the
form of pimples, which quickly merged into each other and spread from the ankle right
up my leg to my back.
“It was terrible, and I could get no rest at nights. My skin was in a red-raw
condition, and the burning irritation was almost unbearable. Water would ooze out of
the raw flesh, and in a few moments the bandages would be saturated.
“The misery of the itching and burning pains nearly drove me mad. My life
became one continuous round of torture, and I began wishing that I could depart this
life and be free from my pain.
“I was treated in various hospitals and was under many doctors, but all proved
unavailing. They gave me remedy after remedy, but nothing would give me permanent
relief—only a little ease at the time of using.
“It was after trying every other remedy on the market, and spending pounds and
pounds with no beneficial results, that I determined to give Zam-Buk a trial. I was
pleased I did so, for I found Zam-Buk so soothing and cooling that I had the first respite
from suffering since I was attacked by the eczema.
“When I found that the awful itching and burning pains were subsiding, I went nearly mad with joy. Zam-Buk acted like magic
and in a comparatively short time the sore places died away, leaving in its place healthy, clean new skin. 1 was very pleased.
“I cannot speak too highly of Zam-Buk. It completely cured me of the terrible eczema by which I had been tortured for
13 years, so you can guess what I feel and think of Zam-Buk.
“The second time I used Zam-Buk was when a box of matches caught fire and bur;t into flame whilst in my hand, inflicting a
terrible burn. I was advised to go into hospital with it, but, instead, 1 used Zam-Buk again with the same magical results. In a few
days the inflammation was gone and my hand was quite healed. lam pleased to give my experience of this balm and shall always
use it myself and advise mv friends to do the same.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOUNG Challis’s pockets were full of
money. Back the day before from
three months’ chaining for Metcalfe,
lit as a jockey and rich, young Challis felt
gfood, and Buenos Aires looked mighty good.
t being the first day of the month and pay-
day for the railways, the importers, the
exiles in all professions and trades, the town
was full to overflowing. Challis remembered
this from the couple of months he was
allowed, when he first came out to look
about him and swot at blue-prints and Span-
ish at head office. A wise railway gets its ex-
pedition men afield as soon as it can. Buenos
Aires is altogether too kind to them. From his
brief breaking-in, Challis recalled that on the
night of pay-day the 30,000 British turned
out as one man, and that the reported busF
ness done in the city, reputable and disrepu-
table, was enormous.
He turned into Bartolome Mitre from
l'lorida, and stopped at San Martin. At
every corner the tide crossed him, a never-
endmg tide of faces; faces tired, sober,
drunk, half-way; faces dead and stupid,
quiefc and eager, and half-way; faces Span-
ish and English and half-way between those,
too. Out of every cafe some sort of music
came ; up and down the pavements the music
ot Spanish tongues lisped gently in his ears,
a pdthe musical undertone of all cities at
nightfall hummed in his grateful mind. It
was good—damn good. Three months of
sand and sun and gruelling work; nothing
but work and sleep and bad food
A finger touched his elbow; he turned
easily and healthily from his thoughts with-
out a trace of the townsman’s nervous sur-
prise. One of the thousands of faces in the
tide, one of the tired ones. Wavering, un-
certain eyes; deep lines and stains of some
degradation—a degradation that was not
drink or a usual so-called sin ; but something
different, some crime, perhaps.
“Well?” said Challis.
“Can you spare me a dollar? I am unfor-
tunately quite out of funds,” the man said,
simply, and with a queer dignity quite
foreign to such an interview; “if I can, I
will pay you back next week, but I doubt
very much that I shall be able to.”
The tag was unusual, if the accentless
’Varsity accent was not. Challis knew well
the pay-day touch ; a third of the faces in
the tide lived on it.
“Yes, I can do that,” he said; “come and
have a drink.”
“Thanks very much,” said the tired-look-
ing man; “yes, a cocktail would be a pleas-
ant change for me.”
They turned into Luzio’s, packed to pay-
day suffocation. Challis found a couple of
chairs and a dice-box, handed his companion
a dollar and ordered two San Martins with-
out throwing the dice.
“Well, what is it?” he said, when the
drinks came.
“What is what?” said the man, waking
from an abstracted gaze round the room.
"The trouble,” young Challis said, blush-
ing; he felt rather impertinent. His guest
isL.ii Kept mat curious aura of distinction in
spite of the nameless, smearing shadow on
his face. "It isn't drink, I think, or drugs,
or the usual things. Is it horses?”
“No.”
"Then what is it? Can I help at all?”
"No, you can’t help, thank you. I don't
know what it is. . It has walked on my heels
since I first saw Buenos Aires, nearly 20 years
ago. Some men are pushed under, and some
go under for a good reason; but I think a
great many just drift under, without reason
or excuse. It is they who stay under.”
Challis looked up from an embarrassed
watching of his fingers. In bis companion’s
voice there was a false note. The words
were dreary enough, but sensibility sharp-
ened by a three months’ expedition found
an insincerity, a hint of acting, in the
smooth sentences. The man was shabby,
noticeably .so, but he was quite clean in de-
tails ; he had none of the confidence-man’s
attributes and none of the cadger’s bonhomie.
The shadow of that somehow-evil distinction
gave the lie to his words; Challis felt that
something was, as usual, wrong.
“Have another drink?” he said, with the
end of the interview in liis tone,
“Yes, thanks.” It came and he drank it.
Ilis abstraction left him suddenly. He
turned to Challis and spoke, but without
looking at him.
“In the 20 years that I have lived in this
city I have eaten my fill of her fleslipots
and drunk deep of her strange sweetness.
When I first came she was the refuge of
crime, as she was when Spain first stole her.
From that, while my money dwindled. I saw
her grow into the power and magnificence
that she is. The palaces rose in Palermo and
Belgrano, and the gardens flowed over their
walls. Presently the theatres and the opera
came, the good caffis, the clubs and the great
shops. Florida’s jewels were better than
those of the Itue de la Paix or Tiffany. The
famous singers came; Argentine art and
letters lifted their heads. A throng of Eng-
lishmen came, building railways”—Challis,
who had risen, sat down again—“leaving
cheeseparing, rainy London suburbs for the
long sunshine, the Spanish music and the
charm. And now, it is around me and the
happier exiles, a completed city, full of
adventure and color, bright and young and
beautiful. I go down the dirty streets of
the old criminal refuge, the streets that I
have known for 20 years, and each time some
unnoticed gate opens on a patio that I have
not seen before, a cool, dark courtyard where
falling waters whisper in a green place in
the dust. If you asked me to dine with you
to-night, and let me choose my cafe, I could
take you to a place whose like you will not
find in Paris or London or New York. In
so many things beloved Buenos Aires keeps
the best in the world in her heart, in the
narrow streets at the core of it.”
The man’s voice rose and fell in a cadence
that filled Challis’s mind. If there were
false notes now, he could not hear them
The man spoke in the words of Adventure’s
own calling mouth. All the long dreams were
in his tongue; the long visions of Columbus
and Pizarro; the quiet musical voice made
a new vision of all the old ones round young
Challis. As he looked up in the short silence
he saw the man’s eyes resting strongly and
purposefully on him for an instant before
they faded into dulness again. What wo:
the evil shadow?
“I have nothing to do to-night,” Challis
said;'“dine with me and take me to your
cafe if you like.”
“All right. You will not mind if it is
not a cheap place?”
"No, that doesn’t matter to-night.”
Two more San Martins twinkled orange
shadows on the table, and Challis and his
friend went out. The tide of faces still
swept up and down the streets, and the music
still came out of the cafes into the night. At.
the corner they took the small Buenos Aires
Victoria and turned into Corrientes, where
the cinemas “not recommended for ladies”
and some "dance” halls affronted the night.
Far down, near the city boundary, the
coehcro stopped before the door of a private
house; here the tired man rang. They walked
through a quiet hall into a large patio on
whose red-tiled floor perhaps 10 tables glit-
tered in silver and white. Orange trees and
black cypresses in tuos stood about; all the
tables were full except the one to which
Challis walked. White shoulders and the
smooth voices of civilisation —Challis thought
of the last three months, the sand
and the bully-beef—high lights of jewels
and almond eyes; all this swept into
his consciousness to join the three San
Martins already in it. Somewhere, in
a garden near, a man was singing slow Span-
ish songs to a muffled guitar; the husky
sweetness of the voice crept in and out the
stranger’s talk. Caviar and Pejerey and
little fat golden birds from the cylindrical
spit over the charcoal fire came and went.
Yellow wine made gold shadows on the table-
cloth ; the stars in the velvet sky which was
the ceiling looked down; and the tired man’s
good talk went on and on. Challis listened
in a half-dream of naked arms and dark eyes
and wine; his friend was paying for his din-
ner. Paying in talk of .Tabez Balfour and
the big thieves who got away, of San Martin
and Mitre and the soldiers and poets, of the
great singers and the gamblers, of the Campo,
the estancias and the boundless wealth.
“In this house when I knew it before
my money went”—Challis felt a wave o|
deep pity go over him ; cocktails and yellow
wine are potent after a wowser camp—“l
have seen Vicenze and Walter Davis win and
lose again $BO,OOO in an hour. Sometimes
Carina would come over from the Opera
House before she took off the grease paint or
changed her frock, and”
One of the women left her companions
and came over to Challis’s table; she leaned
over him, opulent and charming.
“Does the schor wish to play?” she said
to Challis, ignoring his shabby friend. Challis
found a chair for her quickly, and poured
wine. The tired man, with a warning glance
at Challis. who seemed unsteady, said that
they did not wish to play—at least he did
not—he had no money. She ignored him
again pointedly, and sipped her wine, her
eyes on young Challis’s flushed face. The
diners were standing in groups while the
waiters cleared the tables away, bring l ng in
presently a large centre table. Challis
watched them, still in his half-dream, and
drank more wine. The people gathered round
the table; he heard the disc spin musically as
the tired man got up to go. Challis followed
him to the door.
“I say, old sport, you’re hot goin’, are
you ?”
"I am afraid I must, and I think you
had better come with me.” Through the
mists of the half-dream Challis caught again
for a second .that firm, hard glance that he
had seen in Luzio’s. T thought there had
been no gambling here for years; i am sorry
I brought you after your kindness.” A
waiter unceremoniously brushed the shabby
man out of his way without waiting to hear
his many apologies for what was the waiter’s
own fault. “Will you come with me now?"
he said dully, as if the encounter with the
waiter had been the last straw.
Challis thought it was a shame. This man
whose money was all gone (had to borrow a
dollar for his bed. poor ) was being
practically turned out of this chib, or what-
ever it was, because his pockets were empty.
And he had shown Challis a damn good time,
too. Well, he would see to it; with three
months’ pay in his pocket he ought to be
able to fix it.
“Listen ; you take this .$200,” he said; “we
can both play low. If you make anything
keep it. If you lose a bit it doesn’t matter.
Now. will you come back?”
“I thing you are wrong,” said the man;
“you ought to come away. And my luck
has been out for years.”
“Oh, come on, and try it again,” Challis
said impatiently, thinking of the pronounced
figure of the girl at his table. Obviously
reluctant, his friend followed him into the
patio again, nervous and distressed and need-
lessly polite to everybody.
The vellow wine and the white shoulders
bovnn again, and the disc hummed musically
against the voice in the garden. At first the
luck w r ent fifty-fifty, and some of the diners
went away. Presently Challis and his friend
only w r ere left with the white shoulders and
the almond eyes. The luck smiled ; Challis
was 900 dollars in. The luck frowned and
Challis got mad and tried to force it; and
at midnight Challis and his friend were
broke. 1100 dollars to the bad.
Fumbling into bed at the Phoenix, Challis
thought of the poor brute he had parted from
at the corner ; remembered hazily how sorry
he had been for the luck ; blamed him-
self for the whole thing; couldn’t forgive
himself. Well, Challis felt that he had done
one good thing: he had given the tired,
shabby man a night out to remember when
things got more than usually bad.
Seated in sorrow before a corpse-reviver
Challis was aware next morning of the mock-
ing eye of Harry Davenant.
“I saw you last night with the Vulture.
Were you plucked?”
“I went with a poor swine to a place”
“Far down Corrientes. near the boundary?
And did the poor swine borrow a dollar
first?”
“Good God,' yes! ' Why?”
Davenant laughed.
“The Vulture owns the Corrientes hell,
dearie, and runs all the pretty ladies of the
Iris Club as well. Have another drink?”

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.’’ Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of vour
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.

REGULAR water supply was of overwhelming importance to the Light Horse in Palestine, and the Lister
Engine assured it. The continuous sand-storms, “willy-willies” and dust could not penetrate the dust-proof
gears of the All-British Lister Engines, which were universally used for driving pumping plants from base
depot to the front line. In addition to being Dust-Proof, the Lister has Automatic Lubrication, Throttling
Governor, High Tension Magneto Ignition and is simple to operate. All sizes in stock. Petrol and kerosene.
