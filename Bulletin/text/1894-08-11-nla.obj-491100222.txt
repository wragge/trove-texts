“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY. N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy .
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. *
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
| an d has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the ela’ms of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, Tub
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red coveris equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far,North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Caligraph Writing Machine .
iff!
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
T.he Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

Among a heap of obsolete royal fictions
lies the pretence that a Queen’s Drawing-Room is
open to any respectable woman suffering from a
desire to crouch before her Sovereign. At some
remote period it was vaguely supposed and hazily
alleged that a monarch on certain days was
prepared to receive all sorts and conditions of
visitors under fairly easy regulations. No official
announcement has ever been made to the contrary,
because average respectable subjects might object
to hearing that they are unfit to enter the royal
presence. _ The Sovereign has simply bluffed ’em
off in an indirect manner by imposing abnormal
toilette expenses upon the devotees, and hiding
the original avowed purpose of the function behind
a blaze of diamonds. One of these days a strong-
minded matron, a clean, tidy, virtuous mother of
nine, bearing a certificate of respectability from
the parson, may demand admission to a Drawing-
Room. The Lord Chamberlain, or more likely a
policeman, will repel this honest loyalist, and
perhaps she will hold a public meeting, and—well,
revolutions have started from less tangible pro-
vocation.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by

titles of which are being forwarded to sufferers

Dear Bulletin, — A. purchased a horse
from B. Cash paid; receipt given. The horse
had been turned loose on a neighbouring run some
months previously (run the property of a J.P.)
A. bought the animal knowing he would have to
find and secure him. Searches unsuccessfully
twioe._ Squatter’s manager offered to run the
horse in for 10s. A. accepts offer. Horse run in.
Squatter refuses to allow removal, demanding .£3
for agistment. No arrangement had been made
between squatter and B. for any charge. A. seeks
advice from sergeant of police, who recommends
him to go to station and demand the horse. A.
does as directed. Squatter again refuses to give
up possession. Sergeant of police next gives A.
letter to squatter, directing him to deliver horse.
Squatter declines. A. seeks advice from the war-
den, and is told to summon squatter for the
animal. Does so. Case heard by warden, who
decides that A. must pay £3 demanded bv
squatter. Money paid ; horse delivered. War-
den then recommends A. to summon B. for the
agistment charge of £3. A. acts as advised. Case
heard again by warden, who dismisses summons
witnout costs, on ground that A. had no authority
from B. to pay the £3. Warden fully aware of
this at time he advises A. to summon B.—Yours,
Granite. [A hard case ; but A. should have pro-
tected himself before buying a pig in a bag. If
facts as stated, the warden’s conduct does him no
credit.—Ed. B.]

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bool making is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 11. 1894.
Treasurer Carter’s Tariff.
Victoria has closed its financial year with
another ghastly deficit of £665,000, and its
accumulated shortage now amounts to nearly
£2,000,000. The optimistic wine and spirit
merchant, whom Premier Patterson turned
into a Minister of Finance, decided last
year that the depression had reached its
lowest ebb, and framed his budget on the
assumption that a distinct improvement
might* shortly he expected. But the im-
provement never came, and instead the
depression grew darker and more doleful.
The revenue fell some £844,000 below
the estimate, and but for the frantic
efforts at economy, which were made dur-
ing the latter half of the year, the deficit
for the twelve mouths would have been
well on towards a million. The public
expenditure is now down about £2,200,000,
and the revenue £3,000,000 below the figures
of Gillies’ stupendous boom budget, but
while the expenditure seems to have reached
almost the lowest possible limit the revenue
keeps falling. No one, either, has any
reasonable theory as to where or when it is
going to stop. It has now got hack to about
the level of nine or ten years ago, in the
peaceful days before the boom madness came
upon the land, and even if it remains at
that figure it is difficult to know what is
going to happen. In those old days the
amount now available was more than enough
for all purposes, and under any ordinary cir-
cumstances it would he enough to-day. But
the circumstances are not ordinary. During
the last decade the Coalition Ministry
covered the country with little cockspur
railways which barely meet the wages of
the man who scares the goats off the line,
and made frightful additions to the public
debt to pay for them ; and it made billets in
the public service for its relatives and
friends, and their friends, relatives, and
remote acquaintances, who cannot now be
got rid of without payment of heavy com-
pensation ; and the land was dotted all over
with gaols and docks and breakwaters and
irrigation works and reclamation works ; and
120,000 immigrants were attracted into the
country within five years, over and above the
natural increase of population ; and taxation
was reduced ; and subsidies were granted in
all directions ; and everything was swollen
to a state of bloated and dropsical grandeur.
• # *
Then, when the inevitable fall came to
pass, a succession of weak-kneed Ministers
came and feebly pottered among the ruins.
Munro declined to make any serious effort
at additional taxation on the ground that
everything would presently come right; and
carried his big shortage forward. Graham
Berry came and did likewise. Carter
followed and also did likewise. But with
four huge successive deficiencies actually
accomplished, and a fifth one in prospective,
the Patterson Government has at last
realised the necessity of taking some more
than usually v gorous step. It has so far
proved itself a pitiable failure of a Govern-
ment, with no policy, no power of initiative,
and no capacity for doing anything great in
an emergency. Also, its members, indi-
vidually and collectively, are of the most
incurably Tory order, and have a deep and
holy reverence for capital in every form.
The land-tax, in Yictoria, is a miserable
device which produces barely £125,000 per
annum, but though various suggestions have
been made for the increase of this feeble
little impost, and for a more vigorous system
of collection, nothing has been done, or
seems likely to be done. The idea of levying
income or property taxes, after the plan
adopted in Maoriland, is about equally
abhorrent to the Patterson Cabinet, al-
though £1,000,000 per annum might easily
be obtained from this source. The dead
capitalist is almost as sacred in its estimation
as the live one, and various suggestions about
materially increasing the legacy and succes-
sion duties have been received, and dropped
witli a shudder. And when it was recently
suggested, in connection with the proposed
Credit Foncier scheme, that the Government
should issue, and lend out on mortgage,
£5,000,000 in State notes —a hazardous but
by no means hopeless expedient, and one
which could not possibly make the circum-
stances of the province any more desperate
than they already are—the dull, stupid
financiers of the Ministry received it with
horror.
« * »
To a Cabinet which dare not tax wealth in
any shape—which cannot meet its liabilities
and dare not repudiate—which dare not do
anything new and is too miserably stereo-
typed to know how to do it in any case—
which has practically no public lands to sell,
and consequently cannot resort to that
blessed expedient which helped so materially
to keep New South Wales afloat through
many years of Foreign-trade administration
—there is nothing left but to make one more
endeavour to screw revenue out of the poor.
And to this end Treasurer Carter has issued
a revised tariff which has been hailed by the
Foreign-trade organs of Sydney as the first
great step towards a Freetrade upheaval in
Yictoria, Except for the fact that Treasurer
Carter, being an importer and, consequently,
a Freetrader within his own narrow limits,
would gladly abolish these protective duties
which interfere with “business,” there is
no visible reason for this jubilation. The
new tariff is only a mean and mongrel ini-
quity, which reduces a few old duties,
abolishes a few more, and piles on a vast
number of new ones, avowedly for revenue
purposes. The material reductions are
mainly those upon luxuries consumed largely
by the rich, and the increases are mainly
upon those articles, which are used equally
by rich and poor. About the biggest reduc-
tion of all is in the duties upon champagne
and other imported wines. The duties on
imported brandy, whisky, and all other
kinds of spirits, are considerably diminished ;
and so are the excise imposts on the blue
ruin of local manufacture. This fatherly
yearning on the part of grog-merchant
Carter after the interests of the whisky
trade is eminently touching. The duties bn
imported beer are cut down ; likewise, to
a small extent, those on sundry articles
of clothing and machinery. And, on the
other hand, a considerable number of articles
which have hitherto passed free are to be
squashed by a ten per cent. duty. Many of
these are goods which cannot be manu-
factured locally, therefore the duty will only
have the effect of raising prices and pro-
ducing revenue, and is just as statesmanlike
a device as a poll-tax, or a charge of so much
per head for the right to remain alive.
* • *
Why this feeble and formless tariff should
be hailed as an instalment of Freetrade
passes the comprehension of man. Almost
the only definite feature about it is that it is
calculated to produce £167,000 per annum
more than its predecessor ; therefore, if it is
an instalment of the blessed policy of Free-
trade, and costs that amount more than did
Protection, there is room for awful fore-
boding as to what Freetrade will cost when
the whole of it arrives. But, in reality, there
is no question of any fiscal policy whatever
in the matter. The tariff which Carter has
evolved out of his eminently solemn and
respectable inner consciousness is merely
a heartless money-making device, con-
structed with a soulful regard for the
liquor connection, and with profound and
earnest consideration of the interests of Pro-
perty. For Victoria must either make
further retrenchments on an enormous scale
—which seems practically impossible con-
sidering how much has been already done in
that direction—or repudiate part, at least, of
its liabilities ; or else it must raise more
revenue. It is cursed with an elective Upper
House, based on a purely property qualifica-
tion, which cannot be “ swamped,” or made
amenable to the popular will by any lawful
means, and which objects strongly to the
taxation of wealth in any shape. It is
further cursed with a Lower House which is
filled with bitterly conservative bankers and
lawyers, and spirit-merchants and land-
boomers, and all manner of more or less
shady financiers. It has no Democratic
party worthy of the name, and no Democratic
press, and no vigorous public opinion to
exercise pressure on its dull and retrogressive
legislators; and since Higinbothamvanished
from politics and Berry flickered out and
became a mere extinct volcano, it has been
given over to a long series of dreary medio-
crities, each mediocrity being, if possible, a
shade more dreary than the one who went
before him. But the first beginning and prime
cause of all its troubles is its elective Coun-
cil, which has given to a mean little pluto-
cracy the power to block every Democratic
movement, and has entrenched it so strongly
that it can only be shifted by its own act, or
by revolution. Under the pressure of this
irremoveable incubus Victoria has travelled
steadily downward until it has struck the
lowest depth up to date in Carter, the wine
importer, and James Brown Patterson, the
butcher of Castlemaine. And if anything
lower lies beyond them, the outlook is melan-
choly beyond all power of expression.
Our Undemocratic Democracy.
We are accustomed to speak of the Aus-
tralian provinces as democracies, of their
systems of government as democratic systems
of government. In a sense, this is true ; in
the best sense, it is untrue. That is a demo-
cracy where every citizen has a voice in the
government. But in New South Wales, for
example, 260,200 citizens over 21 years of
age have no vote because they are women.
Of 352,000 males over 21, excluding abor-
igines, 30,260 are, taking the figures as
at Ist January, ’94, disabled by law—
viz., Chinese, 12,200 ; other aliens, 20,400 ;
lunatics, 1834 ; State-aided paupers, 2103;
convicts in gaol, 2069 ; fully-paid naval and
military, 957 ; police magistrates, 76 ; police,
1621. 23,685 have no vote because their
names are not on the electoral rolls, and
possibly at the recent election 5000 were dis-
franchised through change of residence.
The available voting strength was thus re-
duced to 293,055, of whom 89,513 failed to
vote, leaving 203,542 voters to represent
581,490 adult persons. But all the votes
cast for defeated candidates are wasted—
that is, the wishes of 105,999 voters are
disregarded, and only the preferences of
97,543 —47 per cent, of actual voters, 30 per
cent, of eligible adult males, 16 per cent, of
adult persons—are represented in Parlia-
ment.

Now, the rule of the majority is not
Democratic Government. “ Government of
the people, by the people, for the people ”
implies the equal representation of the
people in the governing body. In the last
resort, the decision of the majority must be
final, but till then the minority are entitled
to a proportional voice and vote. The pre-
sent system of ascertaining the wishes of
the people, even when perfectly applied,
deliberately silences the minority—who are
often only less considerable than the majority
—in the first stage of representation. A
Parliament elected by 100,000 voters may
act in direct opposition to the wishes of
90,000 —who have individually an equal right
and competence to record their wishes. But
this is not all. A question comes up for
decision in Parliament which divides the
representatives of the governing majority.
Possibly the representatives of 56,000 voters
may decide it without reference to the
wishes of 135,000, who, most likely, oppose
the decision —since 90,000 voted in the first
instance against the majority representatives,
and 45,000 for those who oppose the Parlia-
mentary majority.

The case of New South Wales is even
worse. Passing the question of woman
suffrage ; in any constituency 2574 males
are, on an average, qualified to be electors.
The average number actually on the rolls is
2344. The average number who voted is
1628. The average number who elected a
representative in Parliament is 780, The
new Parliament represents a minority of
voters, a minority of electors, and an im-
mensely smaller minority of adult men.
This is not representative government; and
it is only a bastard form of democratic
government. An attempt has been made to
classify the votes given to defeated candi-
dates, and to show that the wishes of the
voters were, to some extent, suited by the
success of other candidates with similar
general views. But such reasoning is fruit-
less and inconclusive. Tariff cries doubtless
exercised an influence ; but a multitude of
other causes co-operated to control every
vote. The plain fact remains that, on the
average, in every one of the 125 constitu-
encies, the man whom 780 voters wanted in
Parliament was returned, although 848
voters did not want him, but somebody else.
• • •
Under such a system there is no guarantee
whatever that measures adopted by Parlia-
ment represent the wish of the people. The
chances are they do not, since a majority of
the people have voted against those by whom
the measures will be carried. Only the
adoption of some plan' of proportional
representation can make every vote effective
—can give every voter a voice in the govern-
ment which he is expected to obey. To
utilise the contingent vote to secure an abso-
lute majority of votes for the successful
candidate is to utilise it to only half its
capacity ; though even that improves upon
a system which continually elects the candi-
dates of a minority to represent a majority.
Like everything that is new and strange, the
application of the contingent vote is very
generally misunderstood. Yet it takes away
no privilege : all that it does is to give an
additional privilege which cannot be too
highly esteemed by those who comprehend
that the true aim of representative institu-
tions is not to secure the rule of a majority,
but to give to majority and minority alike
their due share in the government.
• # *
It is possible that the inveterate sentiment
of locality will, for a long time, prevent the
complete application of proportional voting
to Assembly elections ; but there is no
reason why the system should not be at once
brought into operation to elect a Legislative
Council. In New South Wales that Chamber,
as at present constituted, is an anachronism
and a stumbling-block. Its members are the
nominees of a single man, the Premier of
the province for the time being, since in
practice he has the power of enforcing his
choice upon his colleagues. He has in
general nothing to consider but his own
whims and friendships and the exigencies of
his party, and he packs the Chamber with
the men who have assisted him politically
and financially. Yet this House has the
power to impose an absolute veto upon all
legislation which does not suit the class pre-
judices it so emphatically represents. Short
of absolute despotism, no more undemocratic
ruler could be created.
* • a
To elect a Legislative Council under a
system of proportional representation the
whole province would become a single con-
stituency, local divisions being entirely
abolished. The first result of this would be
to put the purely local candidate, the “road-
and-bridge member,” entirely out of the
contest. A hero only within his own narrow
boundaries, he would have no chance against
men whose names are everywhere household
words. These, not necessarily politicians,
but men who have become known in science,
in art, in literature, would sway only a
minority of votes in any locality. But, with
the whole country a single electorate, the
votes given in their favour would accumu-
late ; and the people would have a chance to
choose a Chamber representing the highest
intelligence of the community. Procedure is
of the simplest. If 300,000 voters had to
elect 100 members, all who received the
quota of 3000 votes at the first count would
be chosen. A second count of contingent
votes would enable other candidates to reach
the quota, and so on till all the seats were
filled. Thus every voter would have a share
in determining the composition of the
Chamber.
* * •
The application of such a plan, by raising
the quality and widening the basis of Parlia-
mentary institutions, would greatly contri-
bute to the value and stability of Govern-
ment. The election of the Executive by
Parliament, with due representation of
parties and a permanent tenure during the
life of Parliament, would prevent, in great
measure, that perpetual struggle for pay and
place which is a most demoralising influence
in our politics. But, as all life tends to
death, so all representative bodies tend to
become unrepresentative, and the people must
hold the referendum as a weapon in reserve.
It is, indeed, a cumbrous w'eapon, not to be
wielded lightly or rashly; but the mere
knowledge of its existence would serve to
make its use for the most part unnecessary.
And both philosophy and experience go to
show that the suggested changes in our
scheme of government, by enabling the
people to participate more fully in its opera-
tions, and by giving greater opportunities
for the advancement of the wisest among us
to the highest positions, will at the same
time promote the general progress of the
community and organise the worth already
existing to co-operate with the greatest effect
on public affairs—thereby realising the poli-
tical ideal which Mill and others have
fondly imagined.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
How the Constitution was Saved.
The fall of the Dibbs Ministry, ostensibly
through the refusal of Gov. Duff to appoint
seven new Legislative councillors nominated by
the Government, has given rise, in the Foreign-
trade press, to a unanimous declaration that
the country has again been saved. The atti-
tude of the shoddy organs is that the Dibbs
Cabinet, being a badly-defeated organisa-
tion, attempted to over-ride all precedents, and


to subvert the Constitution by swamping the
Upper House with its own creatures, and the
Governor, on high constitutional grounds, put
his veto on the outrage. As a matter of fact,
however, there was no attempt to over-ride
precedents, no veto, and no high constitutional
grounds whatsoever. In the first place, the
Dibbs Ministry was not defeated. The direct
Protectionist party is in a minority in the N.S.
Wales Assembly, and so is the direct Foreign-
trade party. Whichever of these parties can
secure the Labour-vote by timely concessions
will come uppermost, and until it was proved
that the Dibbs Government couldn’t, by swal-
lowing its alleged principles or otherwise,
secure the Labour-vote, it was not, in any legal
sense, a defeated Ministry. In fact, its situa-
tion was very much the same as it has been for
three years past ; it has held office for three
years by the grace of the Labour members, just
as the Parkes Ministry did before it; and
there was no evidence before the Governor to
show that it might not do so again. Secondly,
even if he had been defeated, the precedents
were all in Dibbs’ favour. Both in Britain and
Australia, the outgoing Ministry has an evil
habit of creating a few peers in its last hours by
way of rewarding its supporters. The instance
which bears most directly on the case, however,
was that of Premier Atkinson, of Maoriland,
who, when he and his party had been practi-
cally extinguished at the polls, and he was
merely holding office pending the arrival of his
successor, was allowed, the very day before he
finally retired, to shunt about seven fine
old crusted Tories into the Legislative
Council. In this case, Ballance, who
was then virtually Premier, though not
yet sworn in, protested vigorously, but
Governor Onslow held that he must follow the
advice of the existing Ministry; and even the
Foreign-trade press of Sydney expressed a mild
approval—or, at least, uttered no word in dis-
approval—of his action. The precedent was a
hopelessly bad one, and Dibbs, as a presumably
sane individual, must have been aware of the
fact; but the Constitution is made up of prece-
dents, mostly bad ones, and in the recent case
Dibbs’ action was strictly constitutional. As
for the Governor’s position in the matter, it
was feeble and eminently ridiculous. If he
believed the action of the Dibbs Government
t > be unconstitutional, it was his duty to put
down his foot on the entire list of nominations ;
if he believed it to be constitutional, then it
was his business to accept the whole list, other-
wise the pretence that New South Wales is a
self-governing province, so far as its own inter-
nal affairs are concerned, is a mistake from first
to last. Instead, however, he tried to strike a
feeble average between thetwo coursesbyoffering
to accept five nominations out of seven, and by
admitting the right to make five nominations
he entirely gave away the pretence that there
was anything unconstitutional in the matter,
and also gave away his own right to interfere
in any way. Under these hideously confused
circumstances the Government which repre-
sented a minority went out, and another
Government, which also represents a minority,
has come in. But, as for the Constitution, it
hasn’t been saved any more than it was before ;
and the only definite result is that the imperial
figure-head has asserted his right to encroach a
little further upon the self-governing powers of
New South Wales, and has been enthusiastically
supported by the Foreign-trade press in so
doing.
Sydney “ Telegraph's ” Victorian
“Merchant.”
The Sydney Telegraph, inspired by Treasurer
Carter’s alleged Freetrade budget, has been
interviewing “ a prominent Melbourne mer-
chant ” from whom it has extracted much con-
solation. The name and address of the “ mer-
chant ” are not given, nor are there any
particulars available as to the kind of merchan-
dise he deals in ; in fact, we have only the
Telegraph’s assurance that there is any such
person at all. Arid, considering how faithfully
he echoes all the paper’s sentiments, a great
many people will probably suspect that the
“ merchant ” was constructed for the occasion,
and has no existence of his own except when he
is being interviewed by the Telegraph. One
or two of his statements are interesting :
What is the advantage of a duty against the importation
of wheat when there is no importation? Only oats are
imported, as they cannot be produced in Victoria, so the
cabmen and all the peop'e who keep horses have to pay
extra for the imported outs, while the Victorian farmers
eet no benefit from the duty. Victoria is not the climate
tor growing oats.
It will probably stagger the Telegraph and its
“merchant ” to hear that Victoria grows nearly
5,000,000 bushels of oats annually, that the
quantity grown is steadily increasing, and that
the province actually exports this article in
considerable quantities. Therefore, the above
pathos about the oppressed cabmen is pure
bunkum and mendacity. The same merchant
contradicts himself badly in these two state-
ments :
The labouring population of Victoria is more Protec-
tionist than the population of any other part of the world.
• . . There has been a regular revolution (in Victorian
public opinion), and it has all been worked within the
past twelve months.
Then he bobs up serenely again :
Protection has this year driven from 25,000 to 30,000
men out of Melbourne.
Hayter has a vague idea that the population
of Melbourne has remained about stationary
this year, but probably the Telegraph’s
“merchant” knows better. Then he starts
out again:—
The protected industries of Victoria are all moribund.
Considering that the oats above-mentioned are
a protected industry, the “ merchant ” would
have been better advised if he had said nothing
on this subject. Also, he would probably have
done better if he had said nothing on any other
subject. Where on earth does the Telegraph
get that “merchant” who is always so con-
veniently on hand just when he is wanted ?
A Salt Job.
When the Victorian Government committed its
second “ sugar-beet bonus ” bill, a few months
ago, a suggestion was made in The Bulletin
that the salt industry at French Island and
elsewhere had a more legitimate claim to State
encouragement. Since then the French Island
operators have ceased their struggle to make
the salt business lucrative, thus adding another
chapter to the long history of financial failure
at that place. Many thousands of pounds
capital and much labour of hopeful men have
been wasted in the attempts to obtain a success-
ful salt-yield by natural and artificial evapora-
tion from the sea that washes upon the island.
It was regarded as the test spot where a trade
could be established if there were any fair
chance of money in the business. The chance
now appears smaller than ever—an important
fact to note in connection with the unblushing
job about to be perpetrated by the Victorian
Government. There is another salt-gatherer
holding the right to work upon 690 acres of
shore frontage on the outskirts of Geelong pre-
sent, which same tract of coast may be in
the centre of Geelong future. Here, like-
wise, money and labour have been expended
to no purpose, but, in the avowed hope of giving
new life to the failing management, the
Victorian Government has passed a bill to
sanction the sale of the 690 acres outright at
£1 per acre. Many members, of course, spoke
vigorously against the proposed sin. The
Legislative Assembly hasn’t been formed into
one great conspiracy for enriching the inevit-
able syndicate that will presently grab this
valuable freehold property. For instance,
Vale, M.L.A., said, “ The only conclusion he
could arrive at was that there was a job in-
tended to enable certain people to obtain pos-
session of the land, and the possibilities of an
enormous fortune in the future.” But the bill
passed its second reading all right. The
Government was asked to explain why a long
lease of the land at nothing a year would not
meet all the honest requirements of the salt
producers. On the security of a 90, or even 50
years’ lease, they could obtain all the extra
capital they could ever hope to tempt into this
unpromising enterprise, therefore the sale of the
land would plainly be tantamount to an admis-
sion that the deed was done, not for the benefit of
a salt trade, but for the benefit of parties
having ulterior designs in getting possession of
the sea frontage. The Ministry offered
no defence of their determination to alienate
the shore, although one of their supporters, J.
Harris, M.L.A., foolishly laid the matter bare
whilst trying to cover it up. Said Harris :
“ There were two gentlemen connected with
the affair, and they wanted to raise £2OOO more
capital, and they were told that if they got the
freehold they would get £lO,OOO more put into
the concern.” In Heaven’s name, why ? How
could the salt prospects gain by a freeholding,
instead of a leaseholding, of the land ? What
could be the object of sinking £690 of this new
capital in the purchase of a place which they,
as salt-producers, might occupy until the middle
of next century ? Possessing the fee simple of
their salt-works site, the salt-workers could
turn it to profitable account. The business
could be quietly abandoned as a final failure
and then—well, the land contains “ the possi-
bilities of an enormous fortune.” An amend-
ment in favour of leasing was defeated with
great slaughter. Then came a simple proposal
that the deed of sale should be saddled with “ a
provision that the land should only he used for
the purpose of making salt.” The Govern-
ment had either to vote for this, or to devour
their own hollow pretence of wishing to aid a
salt works. They ate their ghastly piece of
humbug like shameless gluttons. Patterson,
O’Loghlen, MTntyre, and the rest of them
voted for not forcing this condition upon the
purchasers. They now stand exposed as would-
be vendors of their country’s sea-shore to a syn-
dicate, at £1 per acre. The bill is not yet
through the House—indeed, the pertinent
amendment referred to was actually carried
against Patterson and Co. by the casting-vote
of Tom Bent. But the Government will do its
worst to sell those 690 acres without the re-
stricting condition, and if the age of miracles
were not past we might have seen Patterson
turned into a pillar of salt by an indignant
Almighty.

Debt.
Debt is the true emblem of immortality. It
goes on for ever and ever, and the ten per shent.
multiplies at simple and compound interest till
it is as incalculable as the sands on the sea-
shore. It is endless, boundless, sublime, in-
finite, and altogether unfathomable, and whither
it is leading the country no one even pretends
to know. But it is generally agreed that some-
thing must be done to alleviate its ravages, and
the Credit Foncier scheme, now being planned
out in Maoriland, is intended to lighten, in
some degree at least, the awful burden of local
liabilities. The following figures will show that
there is abundant room for such an undertaking.
Maoriland, it is estimated, is privately mort-
gaged to the extent of something over
£30,000,000. This figure relates to freehold and
leasehold mortgages only. The average interest
is estimated at 8 per cent., and at this rate
the province pays £2,400,000 per annum, and
keeps on paying it for ever, and yet doesn’t
shift the original liability so much as an inch.
In 25 years, at this rate, it pays away
£60,000,000 as interest upon £30,000,000, and
the debt still remains as ponderous, and as
irremoveable, and as capable of earning another
£60,000,000 of interest, as it was at the begin-
ing. Under the Credit Foncier scheme the
annual charge will be reduced to 5 per cent.,
and by a payment of £7 2s. per cent, per
annum, principal and interest will both be
extinguished in 25 years. In other words, the
province will pay a little over £53,000,000 in a
quarter of a century to get rid of both
principal and interest, whereas it now pays
£60,000,000 in interest only, and the original
millstone of £30,000,000 remains hanging round
its neck as heretofore. The borrowers will thus
save £37,000,000 in 25 years ; and as rather
more than half the debt consists of English
capital, the interest on which is absolutely lost
to the country, the saving to the community at
large will be about £500,000 a year for a quarter
of a century, and about £1,300,000 per annum
through all eternity afterwards. The interest
paid to the Maoriland capitalist is not an abso-
lute loss to the community at large, but the in-
terest paid to the English capitalist never returns,
except to be lent out again and to earn more
interest, and, so far as Maoriland is concerned,
it is as utterly and hopelessly gone as if it had
been shovelled into the Pacific. Any method
which will reduce the amount of this awful
tribute in the immediate present, and gradually
extinguish it in the future, is an unmitigated
blessing to a debt-ridden community, and the
dead statesman who bequeathed this great idea
to his country deserves to have a statue as high
as the pyramids erected over his bones, to keep
his name alive through all the coming genera-
tions.
Of an Injudicious Judge.
All Caul is divided into three parts ; but New
South Wales District Court Judge Gibson is
only divided into two. The Gibson section
may be about 40 years old; the Judge section
may be about 4. When the two sections work
harmoniously, the result is right enough ; but
when the coltish 4-year-old gets loose and
frolics around indiscriminately the result is
awful. Unfortunately, the mature Gibson was
off duty the other day at Broken Hill, when
there was a quarrel and a fight among a crowd
of miners off shift, and one man was brought up
charged with assault. Then, according to the
Barrier Miner, the immature Judge ruffled
his wig and spake : —•
These men behaved like a lot of brutes, yet they have
equal responsibilities with you and me, who are respect-
able members of society— their vote is as good as yours or
mine in the election of Parliamentary representatives.
These are the men who congregate together by fifties and
behave in this disgraceful manner—these are the men the
country has thought fit to give the enormous power of
the vote.
Just here, the presence of an infant Judge cry-
ing in the Court-room becomes painfully
evident. In the absence of nurse Gibson, he
hasdragged two non sequitur chairs to the Parli-
amentary table, and is proceeding to pull his
country’s lamp over. Some men “behave like
a lot of brutessome men “ congregate
together by fifties;” therefore Judge implies
censure upon the country which has given them
“the enormous power of the vote.” When
Judge grows older, The Bulletin trusts Gib-
son will teach him a little logic and something
of economics. Logic will show him that
there is no more connection between “con-
gregation by fifties ” and capacity to vote than
there is between wigs and wisdom. Mere
“congregation by fifties” is perfectly legal;
and, in the case of the Barrier miners, who are
herded together under the modern wage-system
to earn dividends for lawyers and others, it is
perfectly natural. Economics will show Judge
that the system of representative government
under which he is living is a system of govern-
ment by averages. When the community is
averaged it is found that each class in the com-
munity seeks its own interests. When the rich
are in power they make laws to suit the rich ;
when the middle-class are in power they make
laws to suit the middle-class ; if the poor
could possibly achieve power they would make
laws to suit the poor. Government by lawyers
would mean government for lawyers; and, in
order to secure government for the people, we
have government by the people. Only by the
consensus of the whole can the will of the
majority be equitably ascertained. And, on a
philosophic survey, it does not appear that any
class in the community has a moral superiority.
Brutality at the bottom of the social ladder is
more than balanced by vice at the top. Says
Rousseau :
Having found so many good people in my youth, why
do I find so few in my age? Is their race extinct? No ;
but I do got seek them in the same situation. I did
formerly among the “ lower classes,” where violent
passions predominate only at intervals, and where Nature
speaks her genuine sentiments. In more elevated stations
they are entirely smothered, and, under the mask of
sentiment, only interest or vanity is heard.
The quarrelling and fighting which Judge
Gibson condemns are brutal, but natural,
habits ; and it is an open question whether
their destruction is worth the loss of vitality
incurred in adapting the natural man to the
prim pattern of civilisation. Anyhow, nothing
can be clearer than the fact that we owe
the blessing of Judge to the ancestral
Gibson’s exceptional talent for fighting and
quarrelling. If some prehistoric Gibson, in-
stead of braining the other fellow with a big
bone, had let the other fellow brain him, there
would be no necessity for The Bulletin to put
the question whether, after all, the ethical
standard of “brutes” who “congregate in
fifties” and fight is not quite as high as that of
judges who deliberately condone theft when a
lawyer is the thief, or of judges who take
advantage of the political power with which
they have been trusted by the people in order to
plunder the people’s purse ? Here is a problem
in ethics for Judge to puzzle out when he has
learnt logic and economics. By that time,
doubtless, Gibson will have taught him dis-
cretion also, and he will see that it is not the
duty of a Judge to condemn manhood suffrage
in deciding an assault case ; that his office is to
administer the law and not to inveigh against
the Government ; that he has no right, in
punishing one man for a proven offence, to
insult others for unproven offences ; and that
the Judge who does these things nob only mires
his own ermine but also degrades the dignity
and lessens the esteem in which it is necessary
for the public welfare that Justice should be
held.
“ Drift, Dribble, and Bolster the
Banks!”
When the Griflilwraith took office in 1890, the
accumulated Queensland deficit was £969,000.
The Morehead Ministry proposed to balance
revenue and expenditure by a property tax,
which should take something of the burden off
backs and bellies and place it on wealth. The
new Treasurer, Mr. Thomas M'llwraith,
declared that no taxation was necessary, and
his cohort of journalistic sycophants proved
conclusively that with sucli a heaven-born
financier at the helm, credit would be restored
in a twinkling. The consequence was that the
loss on next year’s operations (1890-91) was
£334,431, and the unfortunate province has
been going down-hill ever since. Even when
Boodlewraith ejected an upright Judge and
assimilated the leader of the Opposition, things
failed to mend. The loss for 1891-2 was
£151,564: for 1892-3, £260,741 ; for 1893-4 it
was apparently .£58,467, though, as Mr. Hugh
Nelson’s two last half-yearly balance-sheets do
not agree, this amount must be left doubtful.
The accumulated deficit at June 30, 1894, was
either .£2,090,648 or .£2,140,648 (there is some
hanky-panky with a sum of .£50,000 advanced
to revenue by Treasury Notes, which pops up
in the December balance-sheet and disappears
in that of June). According to the Treasurer’s
statement, the accumulated deficit at June 30
was £295,608 ; though how he makes this out
puzzles earth-born financiers, since, on his own
showing at December 31, 1893, he had a credit
balance of £10,737, and he has lost £165,678 in
the interim, so that his debit balance should
be now only £154,941, Anyhow, this is clear ;
an accumulated deficit of over two millions has
been reduced to a nominal deficit of £300,000, by
(1) transferring £1,450,621 from loan account
to revenue account, and (2) by assisting the
revenue with £274,064, the proceeds of forced
sales of valuable land in large areas at 10s. an
acre. Authority to sell this land at such a low
price was given by a special Act passed in 1891,
which commenced “ Whereas certain Treasury
Bills have heretofore been authorised to be
issued, amounting in all to the sum of
£1,420,945, and it is desirable to make special
provision for retiring such Treasury Bills, be it
enacted,” &c. The plain purpose of this was
that the proceeds of the land sold should be
devoted to meeting Treasury Bills. The
Treasurer, however, took advantage of a per-
missive clause, and collared £274,000 to
straighten up revenue shortages ; and this year,
when it is illegal so to collar any more, he con-
gratulates the province in his Budget speech
that he has been able to apply no less
than £13,355 of further proceeds to the
reduction of the accumulated deficit. As
to the borrowing of the £1,450,621 slumped
into the revenue to make ends meet, the
Queensland Treasurer is simply adopting the
time-honoured expedient of bankrupt mer- f
chants who fly kites to keep the business afloat.
He has increased the public debt by nearly 1J
million and the annual interest on the public
debt by £58,000, and now comes forward to
advocate flotation of a fresh loan on the ground
that he can show a square balance ! And all
this time Queenslanders have been living hard
and working hard to increase wealth and popu-
lation. Since 1890 the population has increased
from 385,000 to 432,000. Since 1890 the total
imports have decreased from £5,066,000 to
£4,347,000. Since 1890 the total exports have in-
creased from £8,554,000 to £9,614,000. Figures
could not speak more plainly of hard times
and hard struggle. Excluding live stock, the
people who imported goods to thevalueof £l2los.
per head in 1890 could only afford to import the
worth of £9 15s. per head in 1893; the people
who exported goods worth £l7 3s. per head in
1890, exported the worth of £2O 12s. per head
in 1893. Yet with this surplus of income over
outgo, Queensland goes steadily to leeward
under the grand Government policy of Drift,
Dribble and Bolster the Banks ! The province
is eaten up with interest, throttled in the clutch
of the usurer. According to Statistician
Coghlan’s recent tables, in the two years
1891 and 1892, no less than £8,014,000 was
sent out of Queensland in excess of capital
introduced. That’s where the leak is. And to
stop it, Treasurer Nelson proposes more loans,
more interest and more leak! These considera-
tions enable us to understand how it is that in
Queensland, with a population of 400,000, a
debt of 32 millions, and an annual charge on
less than 3i million revenue of more than 1J
million interest, wages are so high, work is so
plentiful, and the countiy is so confoundedly
prosperous.
Wanted—Guarantors for Lawyers.
The latest case of a Melbourne “ solicitor in
trouble ” seems rather more humorous than the
average. Robert Knox Orme was summoned
to appear before Judge A’Beckett, at the
instance of the Law Institute, to show cause
why he should not be reprimanded for “mis-
conduct.” That is to say, the gentleman was
now coming up for his Honor’s reserved judg-
ment, the acts having been fully explained on a
previous occasion. They were hideously simple
facts for a Judge to go home and wrestle with,
to be sure, but it is not etiquette on a Judge’s
part to perceive anything cronk in a solicitor
until he has pondered the matter a long time.
The “misconduct” of a legal brother doesn’t
dawn upon a Judge in a hurry, even if it dawns
upon him at all, and then, as a rule, it doesn’t
dawn much. R. K. Orme, solicitor, pocketed
the sum of £3l 10s., “ paid to him for a specific
purpose.” With this sum he was instructed
to wipe off the balance of liability upon a time-
payment piano, Orme himself having advised
the payment of said balance, for reasons apper-
taining to a certain auction-sale. As soon as
he got the £3l 10s. for the purpose that he had
professionally recommended, R. K. Orme de-
voted it to another specific purpose—viz.,
his own bank - account. Then he drew
upon the £3l 10s., and did eat and drink
and enjoy himself until there was only
£l5 of it left to tell the awful tale. At this
time the bank suspended payment, but—mark
the judge’s words ! —“ he obtained the balance
on the representation, unfortunately true, that
it was trust money.” Whereupon R. K. Orme,
solicitor, spent the aforesaid balance. Mean-
time, the unfortunate piano was sold to an
unfortunate bookmaker, as an article which
had been relieved of all liability. The book-
maker found that the aforesaid debt of £3l
10s. was still outstanding, and had to pay it
off himself. When he applied to the auctioneer
for restitution, the auctioneer (insolvent) could
only refer him to the crooked solicitor: So
the bookmaker sued R. K. Orme in the County
Court, without any result save costs. Then he
proceeded against R. K. Orme on a fraud
summons, and still there was no result other
than more costs. R. K. Orme was not ordered
to pay up in instalments or go to gaol because
he pleaded absolute poverty. Clients seemingly
had ceased to feed his banking account, and he
left the County Court with his thumb to his
nose, metaphorically speaking. Then the Law
Institute actually became very cross indeed
with brother R. K. Orme— perhaps the book-
maker insisted upon “taking it out” of the
solicitor somehow —-and the appeal to Justice

A'Bbckett followed. The culprit’s comic
“ defence ” is shown in the following extract
from the A’Beokett judgment: —
Ormb had smrsrested that had the bank not suspended
payment ha have been able to get an overdraft
Sufficient to pay off this amount, but that did not affect
the deliberate appropriation of money to his own purpose
which was given to him for another purpose.
Stern justice had to be meted out to Orme for
his “misconduct.” “His Honor made an order
that Orme should pay the costs (Hee-haw !) of
this application ; that he be suspended from
practice for 12 months, and for an additional
period of two years unless ” —he paid these
costs as well as the -£3l 10s. which he had em-
bezzled. The learned Judge said “ misappro-
priated” for embezzled, and he did not say any-
thing about the costs incurred by the book-
maker in his fruitless proceedings to recover
the £3l 10s. The honour of the legal profes-
sion is easily upheld. Orme will be again
reckoned a worthy member of the cult at the
end of 12 months, if he can raise a few pounds
by that time. A business agent who misap-
propriated money entrusted to him for a specific
purpose, and who went to gaol as the result of
so doing, would be, by the Court’s admission,
quite good enough to enter the honourable pro-
fession of the law after doing his sentence.
Seeing that a character for honesty is not
necessary to members of this closely-
protected industry, it may occur to some
people that lawyers ought at least to
be “guaranteed” to the extent of a few
hundreds of pounds, even as a brewery or
drapery collector of accounts is guaranteed.
There should surely be a little protection for
clients. At present nobody can entrust a £5
note to a lawyer without entertaining a
suspicion that it might as well be rolled up into
a pellet and dropped down the sink-hole. The
Government requires a money guarantee against
the possibility of dishonesty in a civil servant,
and a civil servant is educated to a higher code
of honour than a lawyer is.
Probably the most frantic epistle which even
Parkes ever dug out of his inner consciousness
is the one which he heaved at the astonished
head of M'Millan in last Friday’s papers.
That peaceful little draper invited Parkes,
along with the rest of the Foreign-trade party,
to attend a banquet in honour of Premier Reid,
and this last straw broke the back of Parkes’s
patience. In the awful blast of his reply he
overwhelmed Reid with several tons of mud,
and having sized him up generally as an ass
and an impostor, he sent back the invitation,
intimating that a banquet to such a degraded
person was the fittest place for M‘Millan.
Which was evidently meant to intimate that
M‘Millan was only fitted to carry entrails to
a bear, and that Reid was eminently adapted
to have entrails carried to him by M‘Millan.
Parkes in his dotage is a truly lamentable
spectacle. When he threw up the leadership
of the Foreign-trade party three years ago, he
did it in the evident expectation that the party
would crawl before him on its stomach and
implore him to come back. When it did
so, and he flatly refused to come back, he
evidently expected that it would keep on crawl-
ing, and he enjoyed seeing it in a horizontal
attitude. Later on, when Reid, in a loose and
effusive moment at a banquet, offered to resign
the leadership to Parkes at any moment, the
old man simply grinned amid the fastnesses of
his hair and made no sign ; he was pleased to
see Reid flatten himself in the dust, and meant
to let him keep on doing it till he told the
wallowing object to get up. But at last the
Foreign-trade party found that it could get on
just as well without Parkes, and ceased wallow-
ing in the dirt; and since then the old man’s
fury has grown more and more awful, until at
last he can keep up the outward semblance of
decency no longer, and feels that he must jump
on little Cobden’s feeding-bottle to relieve his
feelings, or else burst. The next probable
move will be that Parkes will hold out the
wrinkled hand of friendship to Dibbs, and talk
in a husky undertone about a coalition, with
himself as Premier. Then Dibbs, who is also
a polite letter-writer of note, will probably offer
him the Postmaster-Generalship in their pros-
pective Cabinet, and Parkes will retire to his
home and concoct such an epistle as was never
seen before outside Chinatown. There are
immense possibilities in the situation, for the
hairy bard is evidently in such a state of mind
that he must do something.

Dear Bulletin, —The big church advt. which
Card, Moran dexterously contrived out of
Carnot’s death included an address in which
he calmly tied science, civilisation, morality
and a few other things to the coat-tails of St.
Peter. After drawing a fine contrast between
the civilised Christians and the barbarous
Saracens, he proceeded to glorify “ the Divine
mission ” of Joan of Arc, the saviour of
“Catholic France.” Now, if there was any
mission about the matter, that of the English
was plainly as divine as that of Joan, since the
English were related to Joan as cause
to effect. Without one there could have
been no t’other. But there is no more
warrant for seeking a theological ex-
planation of the trouble at Orleans than
there is for bringing a machine-god to account
for the defeat of Dibbs. Joan was simply a
hysterical girl, like the Enmore stone-thrower,
or the Salem witch-finders. She “ heard
voices ” —so did Deeming and lots of other
people in whose proceedings the Divine finger
has, so far, not been recognised. She lived in
an age of intellectual savagery, when grown
men believed in the Kingdom of Spooks as
devoutly as little children to-day believe in the
Black Man. Joan managed to convince people
that her particular Spook could knock out the
rival English Spook ; her hysteria generated
enthusiasm, enthusiasm bred confidence, and
voild tout. The French leaders hadn’t much faith
in her “mission,” and disregarded her orders in
battle ; but they were glad to make use of her
Spook. English carelessness, born of success,
helped the first defeat, and the knowledge that
Joan was a witch did the rest. If they had
only been able to hunt up a reliable witch to
barrack for their side with a Spook, France
might be an English province still. Of course,
this may be “the finger of God” again, for
England was destined to be Protestant, and
Protestantism never had much luck with its
Spooks, comparatively. When by-and-by the
English caught Joan, they were disgusted to
find what a take-in of a witch she was. But
the mischief was done then; so they consoled
themselves by doing for Joan. Her Spook ran
away and left her; so like a Spook.—Yours,
8.8.
Unwholesome Smellbourne is, for the moment*
the scene of a disheartening cant struggle
between two itinerant preachers. M’Neill,
the ’Murkanised Scotchman, has been over-
taken by Canon Carter, an exceedingly
Hinglish divine, who states, “ without con-
scious reference ” to anybody else, that the
other evangelist is calculated to “produce
disastrous consequences.” The chances are that
neither noisy M‘Neill nor the higher-toned
canon will personally produce any kind of
consequences worth mentioning, but the fact
that their religions are violently opposed should
enable a consequence to evolve itself from the
conflict. One is a rabid spiritual vaccinationist,
declaring that the fat patient who “takes
well ” obtains eternal happiness. The other
deprecates the vaccination of “ unawakened
sinners,” on the ground that it merely
brings them out in nasty sores without pro-
tecting them from damnation. Of these two
doctrines an anti-vaccinationist naturally pre-
fers the latter, although he doesn’t prefer it
with much enthusiasm. The “ Christianity ”
that admits of such a startling difference of
opinion in its professors is a doubtful religion
for any pupil to swear by. There must be
something radically wrong with a faith which is
declared to be the right faith under certain
conditions only, and something very absurd
about a slow repentance which, according to
the other man, is not genuine unless you rush it
through your immortal soul. If one sort of
Terewth be unsound, its blood relation is pro-
bably tainted with the same disease. By these
discordant yells of “Believe this!” and
“ Believe that !” the true unbeliever is re-
minded of Disraeli’s answer to the curious
enquirer: “Every wise man has a religion,
but no wise man says what it is.”
Morality is of two kinds—offensive and defen-
sive. Defensive morality sits at home minding
its business, making a happy fireside clime for
children and wife, and doing its best to pluck
the beam out of its own eye. Offensive morality
flaunts a Pharisaical phylactery in higiiways
and byways, pokes its nose into everybody’s
tater-patch, and not content with going to its
own peculiar heaven in its own peculiar way,
insists that everybody else shall copy its
snuffle. Mow, when Queensland Minister Tozer
was younger, he once got a very great fright ;
and ever since his public morality has been
most offensive. So when a football match was
played at Charters Towers on a recent Sunday,
he wired up :
This introduction of Continental method of public
sports on Sunday is notin accord with national senti-
ment, and has not the approval of the Government. It
must be stopped.
But public opinion on the Towers is divided
between two classes known as Tartars and
Littlejohnnycorkers; and, unfortunately, Tozer
caught a Tartar in John Marsland, who wired
back :
With exception of very few religious maniacs here,
public feeling entirely in favour of Sunday playing, which I
respectfully point out is strictly in accordance with law,
the concourse of persons being within their own parish.
As Marsland is a lawyer who knows his busi-
ness, Tozer reluctantly caved, stating :
Will not interfere further, but shall certainly recom-
mend such action as will prevent this and other public
grounds from being used in future for purposes so detri-
mental to the best interests of the colony.
Here, you see, Tozer saves Queensland the
trouble of thinking by deciding at once what is
and is not good for it. The ground in question
is expressly set apart as a reserve for athletic
purposes ; and as long as their sport is con-
ducted without disorder, the people of Charters
Towers have every right to choose for them-
selves whether they will enjoy recreation in the
open air or go to see an owl sitting on a dead
branch of the tree of knowledge and hooting
the same old hoot about the same old hell. The
Towers is so near hell all the week that no
sensible person will blame residents for trying
to dodge it on Sundays. But Tozer isn’t
sensible ; he’s swollen. Has anybody a pin ?
It is interesting just now to hunt up the “great”
Sj’dney dailies for July, 1891, and compare their
utterances then with those of the past week or
two. At that time a general election had left
th® Parkes Foreign-trade Government in a bad
minority as compared to the Protectionist
Opposition, but it proposed to meet Parliament
in the hope that, by introducing or promising
certain democratic measures, it would gain
enough Labour votes to keep it in office. Now
the general election has left the Dibbs Pro-
tectionist Government in a bad minority as
compared with the Foreign-trade Opposition,
but it proposed to skirmish in exactly the
same way for the Labour vote to beep
it in office. But, though the circum-
stances were the same, the Telegraph
and the Herald have been whooping in an
altogether different key. Then they implored
Parkes to hold on, and pointed out that he
couldn’t be officially acquainted with the state
of parties until Parliament met and he was
confronted by a direct vote of censure or
otherwise, and that it would be “unconstitu-
tional ” if he resigned until he was actually
thrown out. And now that Dibbs has been
proposing to take the same rather undignified
course, the same Herald and Telegraph
denounced him as an unprincipled grabber after
office and a shameless individual who wouldn’t
let go his billet until dragged off it by main
force. The Star has lately been digging up
these articles in which the Calico Jimmy brigade
was urged to hold on to the bitter end, and
publishing them side by side with the political
shrieks of the last week or two. The compari-
son is still another evidence that the late
lamented Ananias was an editor.
Not a ray of hope illuminates the Yic. political
outlook. The exchange of Patterson for
Shiels would merely place a vacillating, thin-
skinned, undiscerning word-spinner in the seat
of a time-serving, coarse-hided, impudent
blufler. Nor would the colleagues of the
younger man carry more respect than the
associates of the arrogant “old hand.” They
all belong to the House that has con-
nived at the escape of criminals and
laughed at the prostitution of justice, on the
pretence that all was for the best. Among the
few members who have boldly advocated decent
dealing with scandals, there is not one likely
to be chosen for a place in any new Ministry
unless the country makes a sweeping change in
the Assembly at next election. Which the
country is tolerably certain not to do. It has
§rown accustomed to the supreme stink of its
enate, and like the nasty fellow in the nasty
story it “ likes t’ould smell best.”
Here we Are—at Last!
New South Wales now knows the worst. It
has before it the first creation of the Freetrade
clown, and possibly the last caper of the Free-
trade pantaloon. The first Ministry of George
Houston Reid emerged into the light of
existence from the dim drawing-room of Burde-
kin, the millionaire. The first Ministry which
starts to tax out of existence the unearned incre-
ment of the land-monopolist is shown to the
door of its political existence by the flunkey of
a man who, above all, battens on land monopoly.
Hitherto G. H, Reid has been looked upon as a
dilletante politician, fond of a joke, fond of
lounging round in evening dress, and regarding
the serious work of politics through a distant
and rose-coloured eyeglass. His legislative
career had nothing to show for it but an Act for
Regulating the Width of Streets and Lanes,
which was probably a selfish measure inspired
by his own growing girth. He occasionally
wandered into Parliament from a Govern-
ment Hduse dinner and fired off a speech
which showed cleverness. He is known
as a good after-dinner man, but the
country has never yet had a chance
of seeing what he can do before dinner. Offered
the vacant leadership of the Freetrade-party,
he accepted, gave up evening-dress in the
House, allowed the eye-glass to fall into desue-
tude, and angled for the Labour-vote by simu-
lating a violent attack of Democracy. This
attack was accelerated by the total abolition of
700 solid plural club voters in East Sydney.
His rival, Parkes, treated Reid’s leadership as
a joke, and regarded his own position as that of
a nobleman who sends his butler before him to
secure sumptuous apartments at a hotel, which
butler, after going to all the trouble, is relegated
to the kitchen while his master takes possession
of the apartments. The people of New South
Wales have taken the joke seriously, and the
result is—the Reid Ministry.
* • »
It is difficult to say which is the most sur-
prising—the names of the Ministers or the
offices to which they have been appointed.
First comes Mr. Reid himself—Premier and
Colonial Treasurer, pledged to the hilt to take off
the specific and ad valorem duties and stick on a
land-tax to replace them as a source of revenue.
That’s a big contract, and it will be in-
teresting to watch him doing it. Brunker,
the cherubic, inoffensive ex-Minister of Lands,
inherits the mantle of Colonial Secretary
lately worn by the headstrong Dibbs. A mild,
benevolent, honest gentleman is Brunker. As a
stock-salesman, it must be a pleasure to any
sheep to be sold by him. As a Minister of
Lands, a success according to his old-fashioned
lights. In the office of Colonial Secretary, a
square man in a round hole. Young, Minister
for Works, is a nervous, hesitating man, who
has failed in two fields so widely divergent as a
butter-and-cheese agency and the Speakership
of the Legislative Assembly. He is one of
Parkes’ discoveries, and, unlike many of the
old man’s other finds, has the virtue of honesty,
tempered by stupidity. He owes his Minis-
terial life-breath to Parkes. Oarruthers—
Lands ! Probably the only experience the
dapper little lawyer has had with lands was in
connection with a building society. Another of
Parkes’ discoveries, he also cheerfully deserts
his creator for his rival. Gould —Justice ; a
Tory lawyer, a pillar of the Established Church,
and a political nonentity. It is impossible to
remember anything about him, as he has done
nothing memorable. He hasn’t even the nega-
tive virtue of having left anything important
undone, which he ought to have done. Pass on
to Simpson, Attorney-General, and here we
have a monumental example of extreme correct-
ness of deportment, combined with suavity of
temper, rectitude, and political and forensic
level-headedness. Here is a man who will
always do the right thing in the right way, and
whatever he does will appear right—even
though it were to eat peas with a knife. How-
ever, Mr. Simpson did yeoman service for
Democracy when the Upper House attempted
to steal the Royal metals in the Mining on
Private Lands Bill. He, with ex-Judge Man-
ning and others, frustrated the attempt of the
Upper House to perpetrate that robbery of the
people of New South Wales, and The Bulletin
is pleased to acknowledge the service. The
Vice-President of the Executive Council, Mr.
W. H. Suttor, arouses no enthusiasm, excites
no opposition. He is in the Ministry because
it seems impossible to govern New South Wales
without a Suttor and a deficit. Like the poor,
the Suttors are always with us. In the days
of. King James and Pious William, it was
reckoned diplomatic to have one son a Protes-
tant and another a Roman Catholic, so that,
whichever side turned up trumps, the property
confiscation made no difference. So we have
the spectacle of two Suttors, one a Free-
trader and the other a Protectionist, and
whichever policy comes uppermost, it only re-
sults in a change of initials to the reign-
ing Suttor. Sydney Smith, Mines and
Agriculture, resumes his old position. He
is a “ calm, inscrutable wirepuller ” in his
way, and has cleverly whipped up his men
more than once. He was a railway servant, and,
consequently, knows a lot about mines, and is
very strong on agriculture. However, he stuck
to his guns on the Eight Hour Clause of the
Coal Mines Regulation Bill, when Parkes and
M'Millan threw him over and office up at one
and the same time. Jacob Garrard, Public
Instruction, an erstwhile Protectionist, and
for awhile Minister for Public Works, a
strenuous, strident man, an O’Sullivan in
Scotch, who would have been a good Works
Minister, but in the Education Depart-
ment is as much at home as a French-
man in kilts. As an old trades-unionist
he may be expected to undo much mischief
done by his predecessors in the Technical
College line. “ Somebody must be last ”
Postmaster-General Cook, ‘late Labour-leader.
What shall be said of this appointment? The
P.M.G.-ship appears to be a sort of postscript
in ministry-making. It would seem as if,
in the agonies of Cabinet-making, someone had
remarked to Premier Reid, “Don’t spoil the
ship for a pennyworth of tar,” and Cook had
been called in as the pennyworth of tar. If
his call is to be regarded as a sop to the Labour
Cerberus, it will only make that animal ramp
round with jealousy and rage. Or can it be
that Single-taxer Cook is to be regarded as a
hostage to land-taxation ?
• # #
Anyhow, there’s the Ministry to which the
Government of New South Wales is en-
trusted for an indefinite period, and with
Parkes looming dangerously in the near future,
Dibbs, raw and hungry for the gore of the
Governor and the Governor’s new choice, and
the pledged labour league chain-gang anxious
to dbtablish its bona-Jides by voting agin some
Government, Mr. George Houston Reid
should not find it long before he again sits
opposite the ladies’ gallery on the Speaker’s left
hand, glaring at a Coalition Government
through a persuasive eyeglass, a sadder and a
thinner man.
Yarney Parkes, M.P., was vice-chairman
at the banquet given to his father’s (pro. tern*]

Ex-Chief Justice Alfred Stephen (N.S.W.)
will enter upon his 93rd year on 20th inst. He is
possibly the oldest living colonist.
A connecting-link with the birth of Mel-
bourne passed over last week at Hurstville, near
Sydney, in the person of John R. N. Batman,
aged 70 years, nephew of John Batman, who
shares with John Pascoe Fawkner the at present
doubtful honour of having founded the capital of
Victoria.
The Bulletin doesn’t marvel at the
agonised Parkes snapping wildly at M’Millan,
for M'Millan it was who, with Bruce Smith, first
put the political bit into Parkes’ mouth. The last
Parkes Ministry could not have existed a month
but for Bruce Smith rind M'Millan aforesaid,
who, remembering the sorts of people with whom
Parkes had allied himself a year or two before
(Garrett, Burns, Ginger Clarke, Abigail), refused
to take office unless practically allowed to nomi-
nate their own colleagues.
When Babbling Reid was first in office as
Vic. Minister of Defence, he had occasion to be
present at a review, where, it happened, a body of
N.S.W. lancers were also present, they being, as
visitors, placed in the position of honour. Reid
drove on to the ground, and making straight for
the most prominent detachment, which happened
to be the Northerners, he rose in his carriage and
told them they were a magnificent body of men,
and as his men he was proud of them, and they
were a credit to Victoria and a far superior body
of men to any that the other provinces could turn
out. Then he drove on as the Sydneyites smiled
audibly to themselves and the local swashbucklers
squirted tobacco-juice about to express their con-
tempt for their new boss.

Nellie Stewart’s reappearance at Sydney
Lyceum, on Saturday night, was a great occasion,
second only in popularity to the day of the general
resurrection. There was not a vacant seat in the
whole big house, or a vacant step in one of the
gangways, or a vacant spot of standing room any-
where whence one could catch the faintest glimmer
of Nellie’s back hair, or the top of her hat, or any
other part of her adorable person. The subject of
all this excitement looks as young and comely as
she did when she first became a celebrity, and she
has added certain quaint and graceful touches to
the rather commonplace character of Yvonne
which almost disguise its dismal ordinariness.
Her voice, too, was in good condition on Saturday
night, and even after the least attractive of her
songs the audience howled out a voluble encore.
The great heart of Sydney is evidently as true to
Nellie as it ever was. Even the fact that “Paul
Jones ” is only an average burlesque at the best,
and that the average burlesque is a very
long-drawn-out piece of fooling, passed alto-
gether unnoticed in the general enthusiasm.
As for Wallace Brownlow, in the character
of the clean-shaven pirate, Jones, Sydney
will postpone serious consideration of him
until he appears in some part which gives him
more room to let himself out. Miss Vi. Varley’s
Ghopinette is an altogether satisfactory little girl,
who only gets one chance in the whole show and
makes the most of it. This little lady’s brief skirt
pervades the opera a good deal, but the audience
would like to hear her voice oftener. Lauri is a
good substitute for Snazelle as Bouillabaisse, but,
as for the Insect, he is overshadowed by memories
of George Leitch ; there never has been another
Insect to compare with Leitch, and in all proba-
bility there never will be.
* * «
John Gourlay, as the Spanish Governor,
is the one unspeakable joke of “ Paul Jones,” and
he comes to the rescue just when the piece
threatens to get bogged in a morass of sentiment.
Gourlay has the last act almost all to himself and
makes it a wild, weird shriek of awful merriment
right to the end. Most of his doings are apropos
of nothing in particular save himself, and he
creates a general and very gratifying impression
that the play has got the bit between its teeth
and bolted. Tapley is tuneful and pleasing as a
red-haired character of no special importance, and
Howard Vernon disports himself in the unwonted
guise of a stout person who hasn’t much to do.
The chorus, the scenery, and all the fixtures,
fittings, utensils and appurtenances are excellent.
Next Saturday “Mdlle. Nitouche,” a musical
comedy of French origin, and the much-advertised
tahleaux-vivants, will fill the bill.
* * * *
Mr. Garner’s comedy co. debuted at the
Criterion with “Dr. Bill,” a comedy which has
long since been done to death in Sydney, and
wants a long rest for purposes of recovery. It has
been played by so many companies, and viewed
from so many moral and immoral standpoints,
that the man doesn’t live who could find anything
newer original to say concerning it. Mr. Garner’s
company tackles the piece with all the energy
which could be expected, which statement doesn’t
commit this paper to any alarming extent. Mr.
H. Diver, as Dr. Bill, is a capable and almost
brilliant comedian, and the rest of the co. supports
him about as well as the circumstances admit.
But, with the exception of Miss Hilda Fraser,
they are obviously haunted with an oppressive
consciousness that the glory of “ Bill ” departed
long, long ago. Therefore, The Bulletin post-
pones any serious comment upon them until they
appear in some piece which is a shade less
venerable and doesn’t weigh so heavily on the
spirits. “Friends ” on Saturday.

The “Lion’s Heart,” which began to
transpire on Saturday at Sydney Majesty’s, is one
long shriek of triumph for G. Rignold from first to
last. The massive Henry V. overshadows every-
body else. He is a lion-tamer by profession, and,
though he doesn’t actually tame any lions on the
stage, it is generally understood that he is pre-
pared to seize a crocodile by the throat at the
shortest notice and hurl it right across the
orchestra into the stalls, and that he constantly
grabs elephants by the hair and heaves them over
cathedrals and other obstructions. By dint of
padding and high-heeled boots and a robust up-
standing hat Mr. Rignold looks about seven feet
high, and nearly as much across. As for his
doings, they are stupendous. He wipes up the
stage with Albert Marsh, and when eight British
yokels try to restrain his fury he scatters them all
with one heave. He mops up most of New Cale-
donia with the prostrate form of H. Plimmer, and
he grabs the gorgeous deputy-governor and throws
him a distance of eight feet. When he isn’t
actually visible, it is generally understood that he
is somewhere in the background tearing up oak-
trees with his teeth and belting down rooky moun-
tains with a club. Altogether, he is a tremendous and
awe-inspiring circumstance. The balance of the
drama is composed mainly of a bogus French
c >lonel and his accomplice, who go about devasta-
te g the earth, and committing murder, perjury,
forgery, abduction, robbery with violence and
larceny as a bailee. Scot Inglis, as the colonel,
is a lovely and picturesque mash, and his uniform
reveals the hitherto-unsuspected fact that he is
even ahead of Ryley in the matter of legs; while
Albert Marsh is a plain and convincing villain
with two crooked extremities, and the manners
and customs of a clean-shaved Mephistopheles.

These two persons contrive between them
to get the ever-weeping Miss Watts-Phillips
sentenced to life-long penal servitude in New
Caledonia, where that lady leads a damp existence
'u cell 24 for six long years, and can be heard
moaning dreadfully through the keyhole. She
cheers up somewhat, later on, but is almost as
depressing in her cheerful moods as she is
while occupying cell 24. Finally, she turns
out to be the lion-tamer’s lost daughter,
who was stolen in infancy by the party with the
crooked legs, and after she has been torn from
her husband, and married to her own father, and
chased by soldiers through a tangled forest, and
nearly abducted by the colonel, G. Rignold comes
in carrying a dying fever-patient, who explains
everything, including the murder and the stolen
necklace, and all is well. Miss Emma Chambers
and Messrs. Fabert and Plimmer —the latter
gentleman being then somewhat lame through
having been assaulted by the aggressive lion-tatner
and swung round by the hair and pounded against
the furniture—have some vague connection with
tins effective denouement. When it is over, Mr,
Rignold retires, and roots up trees and shifts
immense rocks in a chastened spirit for the rest of
nis life.

Pastor Talmage, the bounding brother
from Brooklyn, has been holding forth throughout
the week with such brilliant results that at last his
show slopped over into Sydney Town Hall for
want of space elsewhere. His most successful
lecture was that on evolution, entitled “ Where did
we come from?” in the course of which he proved, to
his own entire satisfaction, that we came from some
place where a horrible Murkan accent runs wild in
the woods, and where an untamed preacher twists
himself into dreadful shapes by way of emphasis,
tannage doesn t improve noticeably on further
acquaintance. His cheerfulness is suggestive of
the ghoulish vitality of Count Fosco, and his
mode of reasoning is primitive, and consists
in laying down a statement with an aged joke on
0 P then smiling a cavernous smile and
suddenly wriggling his lean frame into six or
eight unearthly contortions which have no visible
bearing on the case. The Bulletin has come to
the conclusion that Talmage, as Trocadero in
Paul Jones,’' would be an unrivalled success,
and that the Rev. John Gourlay, if he lectured
on “ The Bright Side of Things,” would take
remarkably well. At latest, the eminent
“ divine ” was starting to contort his lean shape
in other Australian cities, beginning at Brisbane,
and gradually wriggling allround the continent.

That primitive youth, Barnwell, is doing
a second week in Melb. Royal gaol, for the benefit
of the toiling masses. Invitations to various
trades were issued by Mr. Coppin, and accepted
in a humble spirit by such as recognise the possi-
bility of going astray, and the advantages of being
hanged in consequence. “ George Barnwell,”
with all its tawdry sentiment and ludicrous
defects, has endured, and been endured, for about
150 years, so there was no reason why the haughty
bank-clerks of Smellbourne should have treated
Mr. Ooppin’s invite with contumely. They would
be none the worse for hearing Barnwell moralise
in cheap verse. Moreover, there are bank-
managers and other birds of prey who might
profit by the famous speech of the auburn
temptress upon vicious cause and effect. The
present writer admits to a sneaking regard for
this simple story. It has taught him to flee
from the tall lady who wants to weep upon
his shoulder, and he has decided not to murder
another uncle, come what may. The last-named
good resolution is the fruit of a gallows tableau
added to “ G. 8.” since the opening night. The
Bulletin’s original suggestion has been carried
into gruesome effect. After the muffin-bell has
summoned George to execution, the back wall of
the dungeon is rent in twain and a vision of the
law’s dread sentence appears. Young Majeroni,
with a rope round his neck, is beheld standing on
a dim platform beside a figure purporting to be
Miss Williamson, and the hangman awaits his cue
from the parson to jerk the lever. It is quite an
awesome spectacle, and nobody laughs. “Kath-
leen Mavourneen,” which followed “ Barnwell” on
Saturday, affords the further terrible picture of
Charles Holloway as an Irish villain. Holloway
is engaged by a superior monster to slay the
heroine with his fatal accent. Asa preliminary
effort he digs a grave for the young person,
but Sweeney arrives in time to wipe out
Holloway and all his guilty accomplices. At this
point the drama looks rather bad for Sweeney,
because his enthusiasm has carried him too far.
Then the heroine awakens from a previous dream
to the cheerful fact that she never married the
monster in big boots at all, and the gaping grave
and the wholesale homicide turn out to bo the
result of eating pickled walnuts in the first act.
These stage-dreams are becoming a disease.

To-morrow (Friday) the imperturbable
Sass makes one last final appearance, at the
Royal, in a mixed programme, devised for the
benefit of some local charity by an author who
has a comedietta to produce. On Saturday, the
only Darrell comes along with “The Crimson
Thread.” The ever-plucky George appears by
“ special arrangement,” because he never appears
any other way, and the existing company will
support him in his latest work, which includes
things never before attempted on any stage.

At the Alexandra they produced “East
Lynne ” on Saturday, according to threat. Also
the drooping hopes of the management were
revived by a rush of audience, and when Lady
Isabel expired she was placed upon the floor in
such a way that one of her beautiful limbs arrested
the wandering eye and held it fast. The limb
was not the least striking feature in Miss Lilia
Wilde’s acceptable performance, although it had
not been rehearsed and was quite unpremeditated
at the time. An unappalling landslip and an
apotheosis of little Willie are hurled into “East
Lynne,” but they will scarcely avert the inevi-
table for long. The end of Dan. Barry’s season at
the Alexandra seems fairly due. Daniel has
accomplished 20 dramas there, more or less, and if
he now retires on his laurels he may repeat his
difficult feat at some future time. The great art
in managing this theatre is to get away at the
right moment. Meanwhile, extensive alterations
of the Haleck interior and its approaches are
being talked about.

“ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, is not in high favour with
sassiety or the gods, but business on the ground-
floor has not slackened. Opinions as to the edu-
cational bearings of Paula’s domestic career are
so conflicting that no jury of 12 could knock out
an honest verdict if they retired to the refresh-
ment-room until the sun’s fire went out. On one
point, though, most people can agree. Pinero’s
play is a death blow to Ibsenolatry in English-
speaking countries. The narrow Scandinavian
philosopher has tried in vain to do what
this more worldly wise and poetic dramatist has
accomplished at his second attempt. Mrs. Tan-
queray, treated by the Northern egotist, would
have been twice as verbose, five times as un-
pleasant, and not half as convincing. There is no
question as to the genuineness of Pinero’s
object-lady. Also, there is no doubt that
she must have worried Tanqueray under any
circumstances. But, then, wives in general do
that. Tanqueray’s first venture, the marble pillar
of virtue, seems to have been an incentive to
suicide. The average husband saddens the life of
the women he thought he adored, and Mrs. Jones
occasionally puts arsenic in her tea because the
children have an unsatisfactory father. Where is
a suggestion of matrimonial success in this play ?
Mrs. Oortelyon says nothing about her late hus-
band, so we are at liberty to assume that she
worried him into his grave, in which case “ The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray ” is probably a defence of
free-love principles and an artful plea for good
old Brigham Young, deceased. Mrs. Brough’s
performance is always good and sometiipes better.
The other principals are likewise admired in their
respective parts, but admiration for Captain
Ardale is not very pronounced.

Two nights last week were honoured by
Mrs. John Madden’s entertainment at the Alex-
andra, in aid of certain charities. The entertain-
ment consisted of tableaux, and ballads, and an
act of “ Les Cloches,” by the Lyric Club. It gave
great satisfaction to the performers, and to some
of their nearest relations. For the stranger who
took the show in an unbiassed spirit it was a bitter
experience of the awful uses to which amateur
incompetence may be put by an amateur stage-
manager. This remark applies chiefly to the
operatic infliction. The tableaux were simply
inartistic, whilst the ballads ranged from pleasing
to dreadful—p. to and. A Miss Madden got down
to and.

An easy one, a very easy one, from apostle
M’Neill : “Do you think that I would go on,
night after night and week after week —very
likely shortening my days with the incessant
strain—if I thought there was nothing in it?”
No, M'Neill, emphatically no 1 There’s a lot in
it, beside the “satisfaction of doing good,” and
you can swear to that from the bottom of your
redeemed soul. There’s corn and oil and first-
class travelling, and, above all, the cheap notoriety
that the aforesaid soul hankers after, in it; other-
wise, old man, you would be shortening your days
among the squalid millions of London or New
York, instead of rushing round the world as at
present. You could give the same old gospel to
more ignorant people, in much less time and under
much more Christ like conditions, if you chose to
settle down in the Mile End Road, but you enjoy
newspaper reports and pious “receptions,” and
hysteria, and other etceteras that gratify your
rabid reverend passion. There is a lot in your
game for you, John M'Neill, except just when a
bigger showman crosses your track and knocks the
glory out of you pro tern. What is a M'Neill
beside a Talmage, who positively charges for
admission ?
At Poverty Point.
The tableaux-vivants to be displayed as pantomime
attractions by the Firm wiil create discussion in the ranks
of the W.C.T.U. and kindred pious combines if they are
as sparsely draped as some of the London shows, where
artists’ models pose as Ohloe, for instance, in glove-tight
skin-coloured coverings that resemble raw hide from the
“ front.”
“ H.,” to Tub Bulletin, from Melbourne; “The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray,” strikingly able as it is, will not live, in
my opinion, either as an acting play, or as pure litera-
ture. The grey hairs are apparent now, in representa-
tion, and because this drama is essentially one of
surprises. The audience has coarse-minded people in a
majority. They know the plot and characters before-
hand, and swear over all the delicate situations with
vulgar gaffaws. The play is too real. It may, in this
aspect, be compared to such an inferior work as the
extinct “Drink,” Warner’s Zola-Reade piece. All the
great dramas that claw the stage are artificial, nothing of
a photographic cast. Look at " Camille.” The unreality
saves it, makes it a work of art. Duse’s Camille is quite
angelic. Mrs. Tanqueray is a brutal transcript. Perhaps
it is not a fault, but it is a fact, that sympathy with her is
only roused in the last scene. However, powerful is not
a strong enough word for the play—as a galvanic novelty.
It left me as though skewered with a sword, all night.
Dear Bulletin, —Henry Irving has not yet been pre-
sented at Court. The great event mysteriously lapsed at
the eleventh hour, and the Royal Drawing-room floor was
not bestridden by England’s only tragedian, after all.
The answer to your question why actors are more royally
favoured than actresses, may not be far to seek.' A
woman is on the throne. —B.E.
Chief Justicess Madden’s waxworks have been the latest
Melb. big go, at the Alexandra. It was Tennyson’s
“[Dream of Fair Women.” There they lay, in the tableau
entitled, “ Beauties of the Harem,” after which came Dr.
O’Hara’s song of the Holy City, “Take me there, take
me there!” Unfortunately, the cast was not given, or
the chronicles of glory might immortalise the fair Zuleika,
the peerless Zobeide, the sweet Haidee, and the all too
toothsome Qulnare.
Mrs. Needle is Melbourne wax-worked. Perhaps fairer
play than that of the bloodthirsty newspapers.
Paradis: “ Melbourne will not have the society drama.
Going to the amphitheatre of the Princess the third night
of ‘Mrs. Tanqueray,’ 1 found the curtain rise on the
house only three-quarters full, and dress-circle not good.
After the thud-almost—of ‘Captain Swift,’a fine play
by an Australian, Williamson and Musgrove have allowed
society drama to go by the run, and it is remarkable they
did not attempt to lift even ‘Mrs. Tanqueray.’ No, the
Adelphi drama is safer, as a rule, or farcical comedy.”
Histrion: “ I think ‘Randolph the Reckless’ a bit hard
on the Melb. footballing mummers. None of them went
in because they liked it, and they acted quite unselfishly
for the fund. Whatever may be said about the public
rush, surely it is a noble thing, and an example to all
other professions, for the Thespies thus to stick together.’’
The Melbourneites think “Mrs. Tanqueray" is “Pink
Dominoes.” When Oapt. Ardale says to Eileen, Tan-
queray’s daughter, “Come into the garden for five
minutes,” there is a prodigious guffaw.
Belle Cole and Co. gave four concerts at Hobart Exhi-
bition Hall, the last one, a shilling all over the house, to
an audience of about 3000. This, contrasted with the
poor success of the Sapio-Urso people in their Tasmanian
season, is a striking argument in favour of popular prices.
The latter Co. insisted on tip-top prices (45., 3s. and Is.)
despite friendly advice, and came out on the wrong side
accordingly.
“ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” has duly shocked the
holy folks of Smellbourne. The Argus and Age are both
horrified at such immorality. The latter, in a notice of
stupendously ungrammatical silliness, says the play is
“ unpleasant ’’—stupid word. The Argus is most in-
dignant that such a wicked play should have soiled the
boards of a theatre in moral Melbourne. What exquisitely
crazy hypocrisy 1 The more so after the papers have
simply blubbered in delirious superlatives over the opera,
“ Ma Mie Rosette,” the plot of which is deliberately sug-
gestive.
Sraythe gives the antidote before the bane; Talmage
before Besant.
A baby, whose coming caused unusual commotion in a
well-known theatrical co., recently had a birthday, when
papa took the little darling behind the scenes and exhi-
bited her with exceeding pride.
The musicians in Melb. don’t do so badly, compared
with other show-people. For one thing, they stick so
well together, with their trade society. When the last
Montague-Turnerseason was dying out, at the Bijou, with
fearful waits of the drop curtain, the shiverers bn the
beggarly arrays whispered, “Tne band is making them
cash up.” How is it that actors have none of the
musicianly glue ?
Little Alma Grey, the clever four-year-old song-and-
dance artist of Melb. Alhambra, is the daughter of Alf.
Boothman.
In one Melb. theatre salaries are paid to the stage-
hands (extras and supers., not the artists) on Siturday
nights after the performance—the idea evidently being
that Sunday is a good day for sobering up.
Mr. J. P. Macdonald has partly recovered from his long
illness and began, last week, to put in a rather ghost-
like appearance in the front of Her Majesty’s (Sydney).
His numerous and enthusiastic friends are hereby warned,
however, not to touch the exhibit, which, though con-
valescent, is not fully recovered, and can’t stand too
much obtrusive cordiality just yet.
At “ Chief-Justicess Madden’s Grand Entertainment,”
n Melb., Madame Pinschoff (Elise Wiedermann) was hilled
to sing, but she did not, and hei place was taken—without
announcement—by a feeble amateur who could not secure
a recall even from a house packed with friends. Next
day Argus, Age and Herald had flattering comments on
Madame Pinschoff’s singing. In future, that lady is likely
to be as decided in her opinion on criticisms as her friend
Marshall Hall, who says she is the only vocalist in Mel-
bourne.
Arthur Leslie Boucicault, whose death in Sydney has
just been chronicled, has a daughter now in England
studying for the musical profession. Mary Boucicault
has a nice soprano and is the youngest of the three
daughters. The two elder ones marrned the Nuttings,
sons of Judge Nutting, and both are now in England.
Next month Lily De Alba, wife of the Italian opera
singer, proceeds against the Freehold Investment Co. for
£20,000 damages sustained in the lift accident. Madame
has never recovered from her terrible injuries.
Evangelist M'Neill continues to boom in Melbourne and
his success is likely to interfere with the Talmage show.
The voluntary collection one day this week amounted to
over £BO, a result as much due to Burke’s good singing
as to M'Neill’s rugged eloquence. High-churchman Rev.
Horace Tucker has organised an opposition show at South
Yarra, where the Oxford M.A. in surplice parades the
streets at the head of the choir.
It is the last straw that gives the camel
the hump.
Yic. Treasurer Carter and his pals quibble
recklessly about their consideration for the low-
paid men in Government employ. In his Budget
Carter cried aloud that the men at the bottom
were not touched, but this is only technically true
in re the public service, exclusive of railways. In
the railways, men getting 4| days’ work per week,
at 7s. per day, are retrenched at the rate of 5 per
cent., which is increased to 7 per cent. Five per
cent, off 31s. 6d. per week is a barbarism to which
even the immoral trams would not stoop. But
Patterson does it, with the gash in his face that
Melbourne papers call a smile.
Angus Cameron, M.L.A., who professes
to be a most enthusiastic opponent of payment of
members, and rode into N.S.W. Assembly on
that ticket, claims the Chairmanship of Com-
mittees (salary .£BOO a-year) as a matter of right.
Angus threw up his little Govt, billet to re-enter
Parliament, and as he opposes payment of mem-
bers, and yet can’t live on air, it would appear
that he had the Chairmanship in view all along.
In fact, it was generally understood long before
the election that if he and the Reid Government
both got in he was to have the billet. Therefore,
it would seem that Mr. Cameron, regarding
his own “screw” as safe, was merely ob-
jecting to the other people’s “ screws.” Now, the
Assembly ought to help him to live up to his
principles by either making the Chairmanship an
honorary billet, or by appointing some one else ;
or if it does neither Angus ought to live up to his
own principles by nobly repudiating the £lBOO,
and should refuse to put that amount in his hinder
pocket to steal away his character. Angus, by
the way, says that Reid thrice pressed him to take
the Chairmanship, while Reid says that the
Ministry hasn’t yet given “the slightest considera-
tion ”to the subject. This looks almost as if
Mr. Cameron had been pressing himself to take
the job, and mistook himself for Premier Reid in
the dark. Such mistakes do happen.
A short time ago The Bulletin affirmed
that Dibbs was bad, but Parkes was a thousand
times worse. It now recalls that statement and
affirms that both are a thousand times worse.
During the few days between the General Election
and his resignation of office the ex-Republi-
can ex-Premier was busily engaged in providing
for his friends and hangers-on. Light on these
various little jobs is being gradually afforded, and
it now transpires that Arthur Galton, Gov. Duff’s
Private Secretary (who has just resigned), has
been appointed at a high salary to complete the
“Official History of New South Wales,” which
sits like a nightmare on the chest of the suffering
province. Galton did not get along well with Duff.
He made himself useful to Dibbs; Dibbs would cut
off his right hand to spite Duff since the squabble
over the Council nominations—and there you are.
Dibbs, who owes his means of livelihood, his social
position, even his title, to the votes of the people
who believed his protestations and put him into
power, entrusts a national literary undertaking to
an academical person who has been a little over
a year in Australia, while there are at least a
dozen men in the province thoroughly qualified by
ability, by experience, and by public service,
to do the necessary work. This is what Australia
has come to after a hundred years of life and
growth ; she is openly told that for the writing of
her national history she must have recourse to the
recently-imported figurehead. Dibbs spits in the
face of Australian democracy, and a Guvment’Ouse
flunkey spurns us with his heel. It makes The
Bulletin very sick.

she is graceful and pretty, with a curiously naive
uplifting of the eyebrows as she talks. Her views
on drainage and on woman’s rights may be pro-
nounced, but she is the most womanly of women,
and daintily well-dressed.
The rejected Alfred Allen’s most poignant
regret is that he has been denied the opportunity
of challenging the intelligence of N.S.W. Parlia-
ment on the mellifluous English of his amended
Wood and Coal Bill. He maintains that certain
clauses and sections of it read as classically as
passages of Milton’s “ Areopagitica,” and that the
whole measure is couched in diction stately
enough for declamation in a university lecture-
hall.
Brian England, ex-metnber of the Bland
Holt Co., is heir to a large estate in Kent, and
has gone ’Orae to be reconciled to his father after
a separation of years. England was formerly a
navy-lieutenant, and has since been a sheep-farmer
in Maoriland, a cab-driver in South Africa, a
stoker on a steamer, barman in Melbourne,
journalist and actor. His grandfathers, on both
his mother’s and his father’s side, were officers of
the British army at Waterloo; his father com-
manded a regiment in the Crimea, and is men-
tioned in Kinglake’s big history.
Dr. Neild (the literary anatomist, who
sometimes, when he sits down to write, hardly
knows whether he holds in his band the pen or
the knife) has a wonderful collection of children’s
stomachs, which he has been gathering during 28
years as a vost-mortem expert. He has stomachs
of children of all ages—from before birth up to
five or six years—and keeps them as treasures in a
cupboard, along with his valuable first-edition
copies of precious books.
George Walstab, of Melb. Hbkald, was at
school (Merchant Taylors’, London) with the pre-
sent Bishop of Ballarat. One day, in conversa-
tion, Walstab mentioned the circumstance to
Thornton. “ Ah,” said the big-browed prelate,
“I remember you now—there were two of you,
brothers—George and Harry; George was always
getting into scrapes, and Harry wasn’t.” “ Yes,”
replied the old pressman, “ and there were two of
you also —Sam and Harry ; Sam was a prig, and
Harry wasn’t,”
George Houston Reid, the new N.S.W.
Premier, commenced his Australian career as a
clerk in the Treasury at Sydney, and thence went
as Attorney-General’s secretary to the law-offices.
During lunch-hour one day, the chief clerk en-
quired on his return “What that noise” was.
“Oh, sir,” said the messenger, “it’s the new

Douglas Sladen, says The Bulletin’s
correspondent, is about the biggest lion-hunter in
England. At a recent at-home at his flat one
might have rubbed shoulders with celebrities who
are seldom captured by anybody else. The reason
his parties are so frequented by men, is that he
won’t invite any but pretty women, and he intro-
duces people to each other, a most agreeable and
therefore quite un-English practice. The Sladen
is now allowing his hair to grow long, and is quite
Fabian-looking, to say nothing of artistic.
James Shaw has secured a 24th share in
the famous Londonderry and is nominated as the
first Mayor of Coolgardie. Shaw, ex-Mayor of
Adelaide, is one of the luckiest men in Australia.
He first made a pile out of the building of that
costly structure, S.A, Parliament House, and
then struck oil at Broken Hill. His chief virtue
is his gorgeous, all-round liberality; champagne
flows like water at his banquets, which are given
on the slightest provocation. He was Mayor
of Adelaide for three years, spent about =210,000
a year one way or another, and finished up
nearly stone-broke.
“Noosey Bob,” the N.S.W. man-butcher,
was being questioned, recently, by the manager
of a Sydney brewery on some particulars con-
cerning his lawful trade. “Now, for instance,
what drop,” asked the manager, “would you give
a man of my weight and build?” “Well,
squeaked the noseless hangman, as he surveyed
his supposed victim with a calculating eye, “I
should say that about seven feet would do nicely,
Mr. Manager. Yes, my God’’—warming to his
subject quite enthusiastically, and his little eyes
glistening—“seven feet! —and there wouldn’t be
a kick left in you, sir !”
Governor Duff is about the most unfortu*
nate and left-handed sort of Governor who has
ever struck Australia. Woe is stamped on
him and his belongings. The old man
offends the Scotchmen on New Year's Day—the
Southern Irish on the 12th July—the Frenchmen
because he didn’t wear the right clothes going to
a Requiem Mass. He hopelessly offends ex-
Premier Parkes, who politically ravens for his
blood, and he fights with ex-Premier Dibbs who
longs to pack him ’Ome. Up to date, Premier
Reid is the only person whom he has not offended.
The Duff mozzle is out, and the Duff mana is

Ex-M.L.A. Dickens professes to be more
than gratified at the result of the recent N.S.W.
elections, alleging that he will now be able to give
fuller attention to his private business, and adding
that, after all, his talents are more practical than
speculative or theoretical. It would thus appear
that Mr. Dickens falls fairly in with the tenor of
(he speech delivered at a bucolic banquet a year
ago in which the orator remarked: “Ye haven’t
the imagination, Mr, Dickens, of yer father, the
author of ‘Dombey and Son’ and ‘Little Dorrit,’
but when it comes to buying or selling stock or
judging a bit of good grazing ground ye show a
practical power that makes ye twice as valuable.
When evangelist M‘Neill was encouraging
a Melbourne audience to name any relatives or
friends who wanted praying for, a tallow-faced
saint on the front seats cried, “ Pray for my only
brother!” A dark, gruesome woman followed
this lead (the tallowy person was probably a decoy
lamb) by naming her “ only sister ” as a suitable
subject for rescue. Then a cheerful voice from
the rear shouted, “Pray for my only father 1”
M‘Neill hasn’t tried this disgusting gag since the
child of one father got off his joke. Stick the
needle of ridicule into a show
and the gas goes out of it. The M‘Neill bladder
is absurdly thin.
“As soon as you get outside my pad-
dock,” said the genial squatter, as the travellers
were making an early morning start, “ turn to the.
right, go three miles along the road, and you’ll
come to the next stopping-place. If you hurry
you’ll get there in time for a late breakfast.”
On they went, and about twelve o’clock, finding
no sign of the road, they determined to stop and
boil the billy. Then on they went again till dusk,
when they camped for the night. About eleven
o’clock next day they found themselves—just out-
side the paddock. The “ paddock ” was 45 miles

Parkes has now only one open barracker
in the N.S.W. press. But he is a powerful
barracker, as may be judged from the following,
which the other day appeared in the Fergusson
organ :
Bill Heyman is a J.P. at Mopunga, but he is better
known as a bankrupt butcher, and the rankest and
rottenest pretender to religion that ever disgraced the
most narrow-minded sectarian profession of faith that has,
in the history of human error and self-sufficiency, dis-
graced the Christian faith as taught by the man Christ
Jesus. We have denounced this “moral sarcophagus
whited with paint” as a disgrace to Mopunga as a man.
and a foul blot upon her escutcheon as magistrate, until
we are heartily sick of the subject; and would gladly give
this sink of moral nastiness an opportunity of obliterating
himself in a spell of destructive fermentation. But this
moral cancer is obtrusive. He talked at us in a railway
carriage last Wednesday, when we had just risen from a
bed of prolonged suffering ; and were so prostrated with
weakness, that we were unable to tell the whole car-full
of passengers what we desire them to know about Bill
Heyman. Alderman Zachary O’Hara will remember the
circumstance. In that cheerful manner of his, which is
in such exquisite keeping with his libidinous wink, and
the wide expansiveness of his belly-band, he expressed a
sniggering wonder as to what the editor of the Times
would do if we had not him to gird at weekly.
And so on. With such an advocate on tap there
is still hope for H. Parkes.

Wasted Money.
It is simply wonderful in an enlightened age like
the present, how people will waste their money on
useless medicines. There are thousands of suf-
ferers in this country from liver torpidity, indi-
gestion, kidney complaint, and biliousness, who
pay half-crowns for so-called “ cures,” when they
could get far better and safer results from half an
ounce of Epsom salts, costing one half-penny.
Of course, we know this chemical will not give
permanent results—neither will any of the many
advertised nostrums—but it will give temporary
relief and not injure the system, whereas the
disguised drastic purging mixtures sold by
many quacks will cause many serious diseases.
Clements Tonic does not cure or relieve disease by
purging. It is a natural tonic restorative, and
acts by stimulating the digestive and secretive
apparata to perform their proper functions. It
rebuilds wasted nerve, bone and muscular tissue,
restores strength to the debilitated system, excites
and permanently strengthens the power of con-
cupescence, and ensures a long, happy, and
enjoyable life, as proved by the experience of Mr.
Francis Barnes, Goulburn, N.S.W., who writes
on May 25, 1893: —For about the last twelve
years I have been suffering from a derangement
of the kidneys. The symptoms from which I have
suffered were pains across the loins extending up
the spine. In getting up in the morning I felt
so bad that I could hardly lace my boots, owing
to the severe pains from which I suffered in the
back. Hearing so much about Clements Tonic
and the benefit sufferers had derived from it for
the above complaint, I gave it a trial, and before
I had finished the tenth bottle, I am happy to say
I was entirely cured. My case is not the only one
that has come under my notice, as some of my
relatives and friends have derived great benefit
from Clements Tonic; lam only too happy to
certify to the above. Yours gratefully, Francis
Barnes, Goulburn, N.S.W. '


A Great Deal of Nonsense
has been written —and believed, about Blood
Purifiers.
WHAT
PURIFIES THE BLOOD?
THE KIDNEYS
PURIFY THE BLOOD !
and they alone.
If diseased, however, they cannot, and the blood
continually becomes more impure. Every drop of
blood in the body goes through the Kidneys, the
sewers of the system, every three minutes, night
and day, while life endures.
WARNER’S SAFE CURE
puts the Kidneys in perfect health and nature
does the rest.
The heavy, dragged-out feeling, the bilious
attacks, headaches, nervous unrest, fickle appetite,
all caused by poisoned blood, will disappear when
the Kidneys properly perforin their functions.
There is no doubt about this. Thousands have
so testified. The theory is right, the cure is right,
and health follows as a natural sequence.

The area of the bit of territory in dispute

The final adjustment of Chicago Exhibition

The Dead-Level Ministry 1
Dear Bulletin, —“Jim” Toohey, who
polled 12 votes at Tamworth, with a committee
numbering 38, did far better than a candidate for
another electorate, who boasted to the writer that
he had, in addition to the solid Orange vote, a
committee of 120, but when the numbers went up
polled only 6. —Mot.
Mr. Chanter, M.P., whose vote has been
mainly democratic, wishes it stated that he was
adopted by N.S.W. National Ass without his
knowledge or consent. So were a lot of other
people. The roughest thing on the Ass is that
not one politician in Australia dares openly
recognise said Ass as his godfather.
The one thing which the Patterson-Carter
crowd swore to do was to get the finances straight.
This was the beginning, middle and end of their
policy. And now they have made a worse muddle
of the public cash than even poor old Berry did.
A Ministry which can only do one thing and can’t
do even that has no excuse for existing.

distillery has been declared by vote : 389 inhabit-
ants were for the distillery, whilst 89 opposed it.
Of the drinking majority, 283 voters favoured the
idea of municipal grog-shops on the Gothenburg

for the wicked old pub. system, with its pimply-
faced capitalist in tow.
There is quite a probability that N.S.W.
Postmaster-General Joseph Cook, labour-member,
filling an ad interim chair, may yet direct the
military to suppress a shearing strike and com-
mand “law and order” to be maintained in a

Circular Quay. Ho w M’Millan enjoys the fore-
taste of this political happiness !
The Maoriland House of Representatives
proposes to shut clown on voluble legislators by
limiting the speeches to ten minutes when the
House is in committee, and to half-an-hour on
other occasions. This allowance is quite enough
for a brilliant man, and a great deal too much for
the ordinary bore. Any man can say more in
half-an-hour than any other man can remember.
The latest scheme is a land-grant railway
connecting Port Darwin with Adelaide. Length
of line, 1100 miles; estimated area to be granted
to the grabsters, 88,000,000 acres, or a-fourth of
the entire Territory ! S.A. Assembly will, no
doubt, emphatically reject the proposal, despite
the tempting bait of the expenditure of nine or
ten million pounds of foreign capital on the line.
Dear Bulletin, —What’s the kink in B.
R. Wise? Is it his University training, his here-
ditary class instinct, the sin by which the angels
fell, the curse of Reuben, or is he Parkes-bitten ?
Perhaps a conglomeration of the lot. He poses as
the democrat, and land-taxer and reformer.
“Instead of which,” he considers Parkes the
“natural leader of the N.S.W. Liberal party !”
If Wise doesn’t toe the mark within the next
three months he is for ever damned as a serious
politician. —B. B. B.
Premier Kingston has issued a proclama-
tion which, in effect, assumes S.A. control over
the disputed strip of land now under Victorian
jurisdiction. The S.A. Premier is the first man
in 40 years to face the difficulty and Patterson
must now do something. S.A. lawyers assert
that S.A. has legally an unanswerable case. In
fact, N.S. Wales, years ago, settled a similar
trouble with S. A., conceding her claims, which, as
in this case, were as to locating the 141st meridian.
Victoria has dilly-dallied for 40 years notwith-
standing reams of correspondence with S.A.
Kingston now proposes to force a settlement, and
wishes the matter referred to the Australian
Chief Justices, neither province to be represented
by counsel.
A late N.S.W. Parliamentary
candidate received two votes —his own
and his coachman’s. Close shave for
the coachman !
As showing the faith which
the Adelaide press reposes in the
impartiality of its Sydney corres-
pondents, it may be stated that neither
paper published the telegraphed clas-
sification of the new members of the
N.S.W. Assembly. In each case
men were cribbed from the Labour-
party to make the Freetrade ranks
appear stronger, but the dodge was
too transparent to deceive even folk
at a distance.
When N.S.W. Education
authorities ukased that State school-
teachers should take no prominent
part in political agitation, lovely
woman had not, to any aggressive
extent, started out on the war-path in
march of Rights, and so the decree
vas made applicable to male-teachers
only. But everything has moved
since that regulation was first made,
especially Woman, and the authori-
ties, alive to the fact that various
Female Rights committees number
many lady-teachers in their ranks,
are now about to include in the opera-
tion of the regulation the Woman
who won’t Keep Still.
The S.A. Upper House has thrown out
the Bill by which the Kingston Ministry docked
25 per cent, off its own official salaries. Most of
tho p 0 who voted against it wou i d gladly atteud
hanging of the Kingston Ministry, so they
p ro hably want to prevent that crowd getting the
cred it for an act of unselfish patriotism. A bill
saw 25 per cent, off Kingston would have been
much better received,
The Munro Government (Vic.) in 1892
raised the duty on imported woollens from 30 to
40 per cent., and as a consequence the bleeding
country paid only £76,000 in duty next year
against £121,000 under the lower tariff. Also,
during the first year of the high tariff, the price of
locally-manufactured woollen goods, which had
been steadily falling since 1876, reached the lowest
figure ever recorded in the province.

producing powers of electricity to private

reared the Juggernaut of capitalism, electricity
under State control may remedy this, but in
private hands will probably prove the rackarock

Mildura, Vic., has polled in favour of
locally establishing the Gothenburg licensing
system. The difference between the Gothenburg
system and prohibition is the difference between
good and bad liquor. Under prohibition you buy
the essence of eternal punishment from a hell-
keeper, and dispense with the law; under the
Gothenburg system you buy decent liquor that
lubricates the soul, dispensed by the law.

N.S.W. PREMIER REID—as he rinked a few seasons ago.
Caldwell’s (S.A.) emasculating Bill is a
step back towards savagery. If it is the
beast in one man that impels him to the
offences in question, it is no less the beast in the
other that impels him to requite brutality with
brutality. The “right-thinking person”—clamour-
ing for ferocious punishment of ferocious crimes—
thinks it’s the eternal fitness of things that’s got
into him, whereas it’s only the brute instinct of
retaliation, masquerading as a sense of justice.
Treasurer Carter’s 10 per cent, drag-net of
all and sundry unspecified articles has this to
recommend it; that it will prepare the way for
that “good time coining” when all imported
articles whatsoever will have to jump a barrier of
1000 per cent., and thus enable us to see if Aus-
tralia can really support its people. A country
necessarily dependent on any other for any of its
necessaries is bankrupt so far as nation-making
capabilities are concerned, however good a depot
for Mark-lane it may be.
The Sydney correspondent of the Age
points out that 150 candidates at the last N.S.W.
election would, under the old system, have for-
feited their £4O deposit, and, therefore, the
present Electoral Act has lost the country £6OO
in hard cash. By the same variety of logic, if the
£lOO poll-tax on each Chinese immigrant were
abolished, and 10,000 Chows arrived as the
immediate consequence, the Age person would
probably point out that the State had lost
£1,000,000 in one fatal act. Arithmetic, properly
applied, can prove a whole lot of things.
Sydney Daily Telegraph regrets Parkes
does not see that his day is passed. What short
memories are possessed by bobbers up and down
in the world of facts ! That is the paper which a
few years ago declared it had Parkes in his coffin
and that the duty of the country was to screw the
lid down tight without more ado ; and six months
afterwards it vehemently embraced the role of
putting Parkes on the pinnacle of power as being
the only man with the necessary intelligence and
influence for the post. Parkes knows that on the
morning his political horizon reddens, the entire
office will crawl around him on its knees.
The fallen Dibbs will be remembered chiefly
as the man who didn’t establish the Sinking Fund,
about which he boasted so inuch ; who made no
serious effort to enforce his Income Tax when it
was rejected by the Council; who didn’t dare to
establish a genuine system of Protection ; and who
didn’t abolish payment of members. Also, he will
be remembered, though rather less definitely, as
the man who didn’t pass that famous “compre-
hensive Banking Bill,” and who didn’t even get
started with his Local Government scheme. The
number of things which Dibbs didn’t do is almost
as remarkable as the number of things that Reid
is thinking about doing by-and-bye.
Messrs. Winter and Isaacs are introducing
a Distress for Rent Abolition Bill in Vic. Parlia-
ment. The bill is but the shadow of what it
ought to be, and only brings “democratic”
Victoria up to the level England reached years
ago—by exempting bedding and necessary wear-
ing apparel, to the value of £2O, from the grasp
of the landlord. Little Dr. Maloney has shown
true patriotism and self-sacrifice in allowing these
men to bring the bill in, knowing the temper of
the House against men of his stamp. He tried
for total abolition on previous occasions, but, of
coui'se, failed. How long will this detestable
class privilege, allowing any brute to take the law
into his own hands against the most helpless
people in the community, be allowed to endure?
Get rich, run up £lOO with your baker, and com-
pound for a farthing! Be poor, owe a week’s
rent, and it shall be accorded to you that Fat

The Geelong Salt Works job becomes more
hideous the more it is looked into. With Federa-
tion and Tnterprovincial Freetrade the manu-
facture of Victorian salt must come to an end,
anyway, inasmuch as the present duty of £1 on
solar salt from South Australia (where a warmer
climate assists the evaporation of sea water) is a
bare protection for the local article. To-day the
S.A. salt can be sold in Melbourne as cheaply as
that produced at Geelong, wherefore it is fair to
suppose that tropica! Bananaland may at any time
kill the trade in both the Southern provinces.
There is no future for the Geelong works. If the
Patterson Government persists in selling the fee
simple of 690 acres of coast for a “song,” the
secret of the transaction may presently reveal
itself in a substance very different to salt. Coal
has been suggested. If a deposit of coal lies under
these precious “salt” works, the new syndicate
will fix up a wharf and ship its sinful treasure
right from the pit’s mouth. Wanted, the names
of any Members of Parliament who expect to
benefit by passing this ugly Bill.
Excitable parti-
sans are now urging
“Toby” Barton,
Manning, and others,
to oppose the mem-
bers of the Reid
(N. S. W.) Ministry
when they go up for
re-election, upon tak-
ing office, and wipe
them out, and thus
“save the country.”
The Bulletin trusts
they will do nothing
of the kind. The old
crowd has been busy
saving the country
for a long while past,
and it is time to let
the new men save it
for a change. When
they have saved it for
a year or two the
previous lot will pro-
bably have an oppor-
tunity to come back
and save it some
more. Anyhow, it is
Reid’s turn to save
the country now; he
has long lived on the
assumption that he
could do it if he only
got the chanoe, and
this paper is so tiie 1
of hearing about his
abilities in that direc-
tion that it votes for
giving him the chance
at one® and having it
over. Moreover,
nothing breaks a
country up faster than
being saved too much;
it wants a rest now
and then.
The impression is abroad that O’Sullivan,
M.P. (N.S.W.), is about to swallow himself and
return from his Victorian travels a good free-
trader.
South Australia winds up the year with
a surplus of .£llOO, and to realise this amount
Treasurer Holder frankly admits that he has gon 1
down on his stomach to look with a microscope
for every possible stray copper, and has scraped
them in so industriously that he doesn’t know
where he will find another. The economies of the
Kingston Government during the past year would
make interesting reading. It has saved money in
pens, ink, paper, and envelopes ; it has economised
in paint and varnish and door-mats and cab-fares,
kept an eye on the consumption of gas, and
stopped a penny a day off the policeman, and has
cut down military pageants, and put the coal on
short allowance, and crawled on its knees to look
for a postage-stamp. But it has come out solvent,
and its labours are rewarded. Now that the
borrowing curse has come home to roost in real
earnest, it is a hard and dreadful thing to be an
Australian Treasurer.

What a tail our cat has got 1 Last week’s
ball, at Sydney, in aid of the N.S.W. Bene-
volent Institution (at which “ Bro. Kelso King,
F.P.S.G.R.C. A !” was unfortunately unable to be
present), was supported by all the Masonic autho-
rities, including (ye gods!) “the Supreme!
Grand !! Royal!!! Arch !!! Chapter.” A slab
from S.M. Herald report
At 8.30 p.tn. the trumpets sounded a fanfare ; 30 gentle-
men, consisting of master-masons, wardens and past-
masters, all wearing the light-blue regalia of their order,
raised their swords on high ; and the three orders, the
Mark Masons, headed by D.G.M.M. Bro. Donnelly Fisher,
the Royal Arch, by S.Q.P. Bro. T. F. H. Mackenzie, and
the Grand Lodge of United Freemasons, with P.G.M.
James Hunt, and finally the Deputy Grand Master, Bro.
T. E. Spencer, passed under the arch of steel, the swords
clinking in time with the march played. It was an im-
posing sight. The brilliant reds and blues, with the rich
bullion fringes and the numberless jewels, made an im-
pressive spectacle, etc., etc.
The rich bullion fringes ! The fanfare ! I The
swords on high!!! The ’ brilliant! reds and
bluest Apotheosis of garish rot! Has
naan really been crushed out of the condition
in which he loved to hang brass rings from bis
nose and paint himself blue? Does thebecoming
vanity of more or else pretty women in fal-de-rals
outstep the hideously tawdry and vulgar vanity
of more or less fat, ugly men, who hang over their
fat stomachs gilded gewgaws of the sort that black
savages tie to the tails of their tame tigers ?

Some scientist or other avers that no man
can tell a lie with his hand shut. It instinctively
opens and gives him away. It is further declared
that no average man can tell a lie and keep his
feet or his mouth steady. Also actor-man Baker,
when he personates the lying witness in the
“ Woman’s Revenge,” at Sydney Majesty’s, goes
on the theory that no man can tell a series of
awful whoppers and keep his head steady. The
moral evidently is that the witness’s feet should
be fastened with ropes to the bars of the witness-
box, and his head secured by tying his hair to the
ceiling, and his hands fixed with plaster-of-Paris
so that he can’t open them, and a porous-pi as ter
should be put over his mouth, and then he should
give his evidence through his nose. Under these
conditions it is quite plain that he can’t he.

A lady, aged 84 years, travelled from
Bathurst to Sydney to secure a bit of the copper
stripped from historic St. James’ spire. She was
married in the church in 182(5. She wrote to a
:Sydney relative to obtain for her a piece of the
metal, and receiving no response, came herself.
She wanted “some to keep for a souvenir J"
The recent
bloodshed in a
Southern stock
exchange seems
to have had its
origin in the ex-
wife of one of
the combatants.
This lady ob-
tained a divorce
and maintenance
under circum-
stances so aggra-
vating to the
respondent that
be found bis only
comfort in put-
ting the details
upon tho share-
market. A cer-
tain aged specu-
lator, tired of
this eternal tale
of woe, got into
the habit of amus-
ing himself (after
refreshments) by
enq dries as to
the lady’s health,
until at last the
ex - hasba n d
knocked his per-
secutor down.
W hioh excited
the chivalry of a
younger broker,
who protested
against the
stuushing of an
old man, and
started to fight
the other fellow
to a finish. The
stock exchange
committee, intua
sacred name of
law’n’order, fined
Corbett and
Jackson a “fiver”
apiece, whilst the
patriarch got off
with his original
smack.
Premier Forrest’s visit to Coolgardio
appears to have been not quite so dignified an
episode as was suggested by press reports at the
time. Tiie rejoicings opened with a reception of
the political pilgrim by seventy Coolgardiaiis,
mostly unsober, who wobbled forth from the
township on camels. Arrived at the meeting-
point, the reception committee drew itself
up in barbaric array and prepared to hiccup a
great welcome, but at this critical moment some-
body cried “ Whooshla 1 ” which, being inter-
preted, means “Camels, lie down 1” There-
upon the seventy ships of the desert dropped
into one unanimous attitude of prayer, and the
seventy riders rolled off and bit the dust, and
Forrest was received like a conqueror gazing at
the heaps of slain.
A similar lack of Vere de Vere repose charac-
terised the evening banquet. The brightest gem
in this crowning effort was a capacious oyster-pie,
built regardless of expense. After the toast of the
evening had been drunk 14 times without a pause
a local luminary (formerly of Broken Hill and
Sydney) mounted the festive board and danced a
digger’s hornpipe in the pie. Then he travelled
calmly up and down the banquet, dropping
oysters and undercrust from his savoury boots,
until another gentleman joined him. A joyous
destruction of crockery and glassware ensued, and
when Premier Forrest arose to return thanks for
Parliament he observed, with deep regret, that
many members of the representative assemblage
were sitting upon Uanc-mange. Having ex-
pressed a proper sense of wonderment at what he
had seen that day, the knight thanked his enter-
tainers from the bottom of his heart and with-
drew, leaving the bulk of the company to disperse
under the table.

“ Mrs. Chief Justice ” Madden’s “ Grand
Tableau Entertainment,” at Melb. Alexandra,
was stage-managed by a mixed committee, with
the Chief Justice in the chair. On the Saturday
previous to this superfine production “ Beau ”
Madden cast his eye over an afternoon rehearsal
of the tableaux from the centre of the dress-circle.
Mrs. Madden, rampaging about the stage with
Authority stamped upon her brow, would fix up a
group, and then one of the young ladies would
appeal for instructions to “ Sir John ” in the dis-
tance. Whereupon the great Judge usually
placed his head askew, and fired off suggestions
“a little more this way,” &c., until at last the
pictchaw pleased the august critic, and a chorus of
Toorakian belles cried, “ Sir John thinks this will
do nicely.” Nothing on the boards was half as
picturesque as the tableaux of Madden in the
dress-circle, nevertheless. Sometimes he grouped
himself as Apollo fondling a waxed moustache, at
other times he dimly suggested the Coronation of
George the Fourth, and, again, he would become
a reminiscence of plain J.M. filling the position
of referee at a scrapping-match. If they gave
rehearsals, instead of a settled entertainment, and
invited the public to come and see Madden bossing
the show, the privilege of paying to go in woulc,
be reckoned cheap at any price.
Mrs. Madden and cronies disposed of 1800 five
shilling tickets for the “charity” tableaux at
Melb. Alexandra.

Had Dibbs remained in office it was his
intention to dress the rank-and-file of the N.S.W.
forces in Imperial red. He “ didn’t see why those
damned fellows from England should wear all the

as mere women-traps.

Another chapter in the gruesome history
of bank-reconstruction was completed the other
day when a well-known Sydney character was
taken, in his 80th year, to a lunatic-asylum. He

The statue of Queen Victoria, given to
Adelaide by brewer Smith, was placed in position
by most irreverent workmen. Her Gracious was
hauled up by one rope round her neck and another
about her waist, while at one period of the pro-

A well-advertised Sydney clergyman and a
dozen other enthusiasses hold a spiritualistic
seance every Friday evening. The individual who
goes into the trance state, a well-known footballer,
is supposed to be controlled by a Red Indian chief,
and utters enough guttural gibberish to satisfy
all demands. So keen has the interest in the
matter become, that the services of a shorthand
writer were engaged to take down as nearly as
possible the sounds as they were uttered, and his
report has been submitted to Col. Bell, Murkan
Consul, who has consented to ascertain if the
dialect is genu-ine. The subject is an Australian,
and has never travelled abroad, and is, so it is
said, as much interested as the rest, in finding
out the genuineness or otherwise of his spook-

should be no more dependent on the condition of

Professor Tucker, of the curious coun-
tenance, was a witness for the Vic. Customs
Department in its attempt to prove a criminal
offence against Ovid’s “ Art of Love.” Tucker
considered the book indecent, but Dr. Bride, the
Melb. Public Librarian, and others were disposed
to regard it as a valuable classic which they would
not care to recommend to “the young person.”
So old Ovid is still to be sold in virtuous Victoria,
with the new recommendation that it is suitable
for gentlemen only. Let a girl distinctly under-
stand that a particular book is not good for her,
and she will never, never wish to read it.

Parson Talmage’s “ tabernacle ” was
burned to ashes shortly before he left New York ;
cause of fire unknown. One of his trustees now
explains how the combustion came about: —
“ That fire,” said Mr. Moody earnestly, “ was a provi-
dential dispensation. I think it was Christ’s way of help-
ing ns. He certainly did help us, I think. After I got
in the board we paid all our current obligations. We got
the Sage mortgage extended. We raised money by
popular appeal. We did all we could, and then Dr.
Talm »ge preached his farewell sermon. And then,” he
continued in a slow and solemn voice, 11 Christ said to us:
‘ Boys, you’ve done well. I'll relieve you of your
troubles.’ And then he burned the church.” As Mr.
Moody uttered these last words his voice sank almost to a
whisper, and his manner was intensely earnest. After a
pause of a minute Mr. Moody became more cheerful,
“ I don’t believe,” he said, “ that Christ believes in
running a church under a big debt. He called us to a
halt for that reason. I don’t believe Christ believes in
running a church with any debt. If he does, I don’t.”
That last sentence is evidently a serious warning
to his pal the Deity (“Boys,” &c.) that Moody
will only follow Him so long as He walks a chalk-
line. Moody feels that a church should be free from
debt, and if the Deity doesn’t feel likewise, He
ought to. If you want genuine, up-to-date blas-
phemy always apply to a shining light of the
church. *

tJnder the new S.A. vice-regal arrange-

local society can explain where Kinty recoups his
loss.
A week or so ago they had a really
exciting half-hour in Carlton (Vic.)
police-court. A peaceful-lookirig elderly
lady got into the box to complain of
the eccentric conduct of one .James
M'Dougall, and a wild-eyed person
answering to that name was inserted
in the dock to answer the charge.
M'Dougall, according to the lady’s
account, used to trot behind her in the
street and call out “Stop thief ! ” and
she asked the court that this conduct
should be discontinued. Just here
defendant got hold of the Bible and
hove it at the head of an adjacent
official, and delivered an impassioned
harangue which broke up the gravity
of the court. Then he started to sing
“God Save the Queen ” and to undress
himself in court, but the police rushed
him ere he got all his clothes off and
held on the balance of his wardrobe by
main force. Meanwhile, prosecutrix,
fearing the spectacle of an absolutely
naked defendant, had bolted and left
the case unfinished. Consequently,
there was a difficulty in deciding what
to do with the accused, but at last the
bench fined him ss. on general prin-
ciples, and gave him six hours’ gaol
for undressing himself in the sacred
halls of justice.

Evangelist M‘Neill’s babbles
mainly to bald-headed men at his mid-
day services in Melbourne Town Hall.
He is the bringer of glad tidings to
busted syndicators and insolvent
church - goers of all denominations.
They may be seen in the body of the
ball, beaming upon the smug* “jolly”
man, with the wiry dissenting beard,
who tells them to believe and be
saved. That’s the religion for Jones,
of Collins-st., and Bouncer, of Flinders
Lane. No nonsense about high prin-
ciple, and discipline of the dmind, an
all that moral philosophy stuff. “Sim-
ple faith ” is the commercial bald-head’s
“ dart.’’ It is easier to accept God
than to believe in banks, so after singing
the Doxology and showing themselves
out at the door, they walk briskly off,
with peace in their hearts, and an in-
tensified contempt for irreligious
honesty and fair dealing. They have
been “ strengthened ” by the stuff that
makes any decent worldling sick. The
business person who can taste M‘Neill’s
hogwash without vomiting is to be
regarded with much suspicion.
The idea ! When a Melb. bookseller was
prosecuted the other day for selling Ovid’s “ Art
of Love,” an alleged wicked book, three witnesses
—including James Smith, of the Argus, and two
M. A.’s—got into the box and swore that Ovid isn’t
a bit more immoral than some parts of the Bible and
Shakespeare. Now, when Josh. Symes says that
sort of thing on a freethought platform it is
blasphemy. In a court of law it is a literary
opinion.
TO PHYLLIS: AN ARSENIC EATER.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Sweet Phyllis, I don’t really care
That arsenic ’tis that makes you fair;
Far, far such trifles I’m above,
For I am also drugged—with love.
Ah, gay coquette ! your world, though wide,
Is not enough to suit your pride—
“ More moths,” you sigh with every breath :
And so you needs must flirt with Death.
Death, captivated by your charms,
Would fain embrace you in his arms,
The grim old spectre smites, but lo !
You are the fairer for the blow.
I hold you in my eyes, sweet maid,
Your head with coiled, golden braid,
Your lithe form like a triune Grace,
The deadly beauty of your face.
Your sweet prescription ! would I were
The patient whose relief your bear ;
In truth, sweet Phyllis, I am sick
And need you—love and arsenic.
If you should scorn me," maiden fair,
Grant me, at least, one parting prayer;
In kissing you let me death seek
And sip oblivion from your cheek.
If we should marry, ah, sweetheart,
I ask one promise on your part:
Don’t let me, by sad writhings rude,
Find your complexion in the food.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad rticle for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at
A NTHOKry HORDERN’S ?

FLETCHER’S PILLS and CLEMENTS
TONIC are the recognised household remedies of
the Australian colonies, and every designing
quack tries to trade on their reputation and re-
nown. This is the greatest proof of their merit,
and sufferers want to be particular to get the
genuine article as regret and disappointment are
sure to follow the use of the thousands of “ All-
failing” remedies so freely advertised. The repu-
tation and wide-spread use of Clements Tonic and
Fletcher’s Pills are the greatest proofs of their
appreciation by the public. If they were not as
represented they would have out of
memory long ere this; but instead their sale is
greater and they more esteemed day by day and
week by week, and this emphatically proves their
undisputed supremacy. Listen to no argument
from interested persons; demand the genuine
articles and TAKE NO SUBSTITUTE.

"VTOU, of course, want the highest quality of to.ie, action,

will lie in enforcing prayers and the reading of a

the arsenicised relatives and friends of the lady
had been prescribed bismuth as a sedative, and
Gaunson, it is said, will produce evidence that
arsenic is not always foreign to bismuth prepara-
tions. .

“ Loyalty ” has come to a pretty pass in
Tasmania. Gov. Gonnanston attended one of
the Belle Cole concerts in Hobart, and when the
last but one item on the programme was over,
H.E. arose and departed, accompanied by Lady
G. and suite ; whereupon the conductor (he of the
local Exhibition choir) hastily substituted the
National Anthem for the song promised per pro-
gramme and thus concluded the concert.

Dear Bulletin, — “J.R.” says,
aroma of coloured persons,_ that the “ characteris-
tic smell” of the negro is not present in the
Asiatic. This is true, but the characteristic smell
of the Asiatic is very much like the other, and is
not in the least disagreeable when you get accus-
tomed to it. And again, your unnamed corres-
pondent, on trousered women, cannot have lived
in the Punjab. Providence does not give the
beautiful limbs of a beautiful woman to be hidden
by skirts or baggy trousers. A Punditanee, Pun-
jabee, or Cashmere woman can be more graceful in
skin-tight silk pants than most of the angularities
or adiposities in corsets, skirts, and other com-
binations. The most beautiful Asiatic woman I
ever saw wore yellow trousers. And your unknown
leaves with a good woman four things: Her
religion, her honour, her lover, and her petticoat.
My good woman, just named, had the first three,
the third being myself, and between us we had no
petticoat—only trousers. My friend. Dr. Brigham
Brown, knows more about women than the writer
you quote —Yours, Brighan Scotty Wrinkled.

Apropos of a recent Sydney case in which
an apparently dead child came to life on being put
in its coffin. A Sydney asylum contains a woman
who, many years back, revived just as she was
being screwed down in her coffin. The shock of
that gruesome awakening necessitated her removal
and confinement, ever since, in a mad-house.

“It is considered necessary that a number

Up to the end of June of this year the

vellous transformation.
Dear Bulletin, —Here are the facts in re
the chief sources of Sydney poverty relief. There
is no systematic or united effort to prevent im-
position. The Labour Bureau only gives relief to
married people (the husband being registered on
the books as unemployed). Widows and widowers
are referred to the Benevolent Asylum; and
deserted wives likewise. Should a husband elect
to go fossicking through the Bureau, the wife is
not thrown on the Benevolent Asylum ; on the
contrary, she is rationed by the Bureau until such
time as he writes for the wife and family to be
sent up to him by the department, which has been
done in many hundreds of cases since “fossick-
ing” was started. At the same time, while draw-
ing from the Bureau, the wife may also be drawing
relief from the B.A. as well (the fault of the
system), having represented that the husband is
away looking for work, and omitting to mention
that he had been sent fossicking. When B.A.
finds the husband is out of work and in town it
certainly refers him to the Bureau on the chance of
its being able to place him on some job—and that’s
about all the reference that is made. The B.A.
has about 700 cases weekly and only one inspector
to enquire as to bona-fides, &c. The Bureau has
about 360 cases with four inspectors, who attend
to every ease once a week. What is wanted is
centralisation of relief, with all cases recorded and
classified for reference by subsidiary organisa-
tions. Where possible, relief should only be
given in exchange for labour. Mere charity
demoralises the recipient and increases the burden.
—Yours,
JESKI.
Bless you ! patriotic bart.,
Legislator sensible :
Whilst the country’s “ in the cart ”
You are indispensable
As the moon from oloudland dark
(Classic theme for penny verse),
So do you, O William Clarke,
Luminate the universe.
Had you carried out your throat,
Orator mellifluent,
’Twould have filled with mad r.'gret
Every constituent.
When you speak they whisper “ Hark !”• —
They were never critical —
“ Listen to Sir William Clarke 1”
Don’t he talk political!”
Few the things you had to tell
In a sense articular,
And your forte was doing—well—
Nothing in particular.
Still your mumbled crude remark,
Or your sentence blunderfull,
Coming from Sir William Clarke,
Sounded rather wonderful.
Therefore, patriotic bart.,
By your change of attitude
You have set a people’s heart
Pit-a-pat with gratitude.
Gay and joyous, like a lark
Loosened from a sparrow-net.
Toadies carol —“ Vote for Clarke 1
’Cos he is a baronet.’’
TO A BALLET-DANCER.
Diaphanous in tulle and gauze,
And lace, no doubt,
I must not look at you—because
Folks are about.
When on your toes you pirouette
And kick the “flies,”
I always use a friend’s lorgnette
To hide my eyes.
But for a lady’s hat I might
Drain pleasure’s dregs,
And now and then catch sinful sight
Of your—hem ! —legs.
But still, despite kind heaven’s care,
Which strikes me dumb,
I wish, although that hat is there,
I had not come.
My private thoughts a staid, black coat
Conceals from view,
It is much easier, I wote,
To see through you.
For, when your skirts go flutt’ring far
Up in the air,
I see not only what you are,
But what you wear !
Melb.

Beyond the Bars
(For the Bulletin)
“ Unto the poet's soaring soul
This earth is but a cage 1 ” he said ;
“ My spirit yet shitll reach its goal.
When this my feeble frame is dead.
I'll know tile secrets of the earth.
I’ll hold communion with the stars,
After my glorious glad new birth
Beyond the bars 1 ”
The barmaid thought that he was mad ;
She could not see the soul behind
Those glazed and drink-dimmed eves, yet sad
She felt for him who wished to find
Creation's secrets. So she spake
To one just stepped from off the cars—
“ May he be soon, for his own sake,
Beyond the bars ! ”
“ Only a wreck,” said he, “ who reeks
Of drink,” and turned and drank his fill;
Hi* goal was dross that commerce seeks,
His lore the wisdom of the till.
But that poor poet all unkempt,
He sought the loro that makes and mars.
For of high regions ho had dreamt
Beyond the bars.
The man and girl are underground,
Dead as the dirt that wraps their frames ;
No honour have their actions found ;
Forgotten even are their names.
The pu-t has his wish at last.
Fur Time has snatched him to the stars ;
His songs live on, though he has passed
Beyond the bars.

My Dear Moorabinda—
A huge Masonic ball, in aid of Masonic indi-
gence, came off very perkily at Sydney Town
Hall on 31st ult., altho’ the promised vice-regal
patronage wasn’t there, and the grand proces-
sion under crossed swords (rather reminiscent to
an unawed onlooker of the nursery game of
‘‘oranges and lemons ”) wasn’t headed by His
Ex. From a purely spectacular point of view,
the Governor’s defection didn’t amount to a row
of pins, for his worshipful substitute was a well-
known Sydney boniface of commanding presence,
in a gilded horse-collar and a jeweller’s shop-front
of signs and symbols, who evoluted to perfection,
and brought down the house. But a Governor
doesn’t strengthen his position by making pie-
crust of his promises at the eleventh hour; altho’
local ball-committees are getting used to the ting-
tong of the telephone at ten minutes to starting-
time, and a voice proclaiming in faint aide-de-
cainpish tones that His Excellency or Her Excel-
lency will not attend, having become indisposed
after dinner—no blame attached to the cook.
A rather depressing feature of the big Masonic
ball was that all the taking costumes seemed to
have got on to the ugly women, so I dare not
immortalise the garments that took my fancy •
there was a fair percentage of frocks that hit one
in the eye, as the French almost say. Imagine a
damsel in sanguinary scarlet even to her long
gloves—like Lonnen’s Mephisto. 1 Masonic in-
signia and jewels made the he-aspect of the floor
glitter like a pantomime-chorus, but the Nemesis
of Freemasonry seems to be that it is not until
brother Blank’s skull is sticking out of his hair
that he is eligible to “ wear a jewel on his head.”
The young and bewitching Mason is crudely orna-
mented, as a general rule, with a thing like an
empty handkerchief-sachet suspended where a
savage generally masses the whole of his ward-
robe, while his Masonic grandfather can’t move
for bullion and rheumatics.
A mummer, who sometimes arranges entertain-
ments for people who don’t know how, expressed
himself recently on the moral difference between
two leading Australian Govmentouses in the
matter of stage exhibitions. Only the other day
a charity programme was submitted to a high
official who, looking down the list, decided that a
ballet would liven things up, and asked the
manager if he could tuck one in any where. “ But,
of course, with no tights, if you please, Mr. '
Haresfoot—his Excellency don’t approve of ’em.”
On the disgusted actor-man saying that a ballet
without fleshings was impossible, the High Official
waived the point and said that perhaps a discreet
skirt-dance with opaque draperies might be
arranged instead. As it eventuated they had
neither leg-show nor peg-show on that eventful
evening—but as his Ex. stopped away just as
frigidly from the extremely Bowdlerised bill they
concocted in deference to his modesty as he might
have done if they had included Bartho in the
entertainment, the haggling went for nothing—
unless to advertise the fact that the most unpopular
Governor in Australia won’t look at Tottie Redlegs,
even through his fingers.
But at another and more palatial Guvmentouse
the showman who is commanded to get up an.
entertainment to amuse the Guv’nah simply has
the whole world to pick and choose from, and
never need shy at a clever turn because it is a little
cerulean. In fact, their Excellencies have sat out
one or two things that have even deepened to
indigo here and there, and yet nobody was
beheaded after the performance.
Five o’clock gossip has been drawing its inspira-
tion from the back-blocks recently, and everybody
has been tattling of the secret marriage of Mrs.
Pure Merino’s pretty governess with the coach-
man, who only had a promising pair of legs to
recommend him. As several more or less pro-
minent Sydney families are related to the well-
connected heroine, she is receiving much pity and
commiseration for her rash act, but I haven’t met
anybody yet who wasted any sympathy on the
bridegroom. And yet in the mating of white and
horny hands, I think the latter generally get the
worst of the deal in the lifelong sequel.
Sydney has its “chahut’’—practised by club
youths who go yelling along quiet streets at mid-
night-one man making a noise like a dog with
two tin kettles tied to his tail and, moreover,
keeping his aristqcratic eye out for any mischief
he may do in passing. But he is not always
allowed to hovl in peace. The other evening a
covey of youths, uttering their strange, weird cry
and kicking over the dirt-boxes as they progressed,
were making tracks for their club—a particularly
swell one. Imagine their surprise when they
were arrested on the step thereof and put firmly ,
into the lock-up for the night, no friend being'
available in the small hours to bail them out 1
They hoot pianissimo now.
Owing to unforeseen obstacles, I regret to say I
missed the At Home (dancing) given by the
students of Sb. Andrew’s College, the other Thurs-
day. _ By the way, as the college’s coat-of-arms is
a shield like a tea-tray with an open Bible flat-
tened out on it, a dance is the very last thing one
might expect from the collegians—unless the cards
went out in this wise : “To meet the daughter of
Herodias.”
That gifted actor, Mr. Sass, who looked on the
stage as if he had evoluted from a furled umbrella,
departed ’Ornewards last mail. Off the boards,
Mr. S. abandoned himself to botany and his
garden-Latin was a treat to listen to, although he
wasn t an infallible weed-christener by any means.
X remember hearing him discoursing of the rarity
and unusualness of a plant to which he gave a
blue blossom every ten years and a double-jointed
name and then looked round for applause. Where-
upon a still, small Australian voice said, un-
feelingly ; “Nonsense; it’s only a Queensland
pineapple plant!’’
The “Daffodil Dance” in aid of Sb, Francis’
Church happened in Paddington Town Hall on
2nd inst. in the presence of Mayor and Mayoress
Manning. The latter wore the most good-looking
gown in the room, and carried a well-built commit-
tee posey of daffodils and ferns. Whether it is an
actual kindness for a committee to handicap their
lady president with 71bs. or so of garden produce
from her entrance is open to controversy—but,
fi-i er a co,n pliment’a a compliment, even if
(like the handshake of the N.S.W. Sergeant-at-
Arms) it sprains one’s wrist. The Daffodil Dance
was a success of numbers; the wall trimming
(supervised by Mrs. Blankstone) was effectively
Irish' Had it not been for one or two unforgive-
able costumes and the bumpy music, the Daffodil
Dance would have shaped very well for an
eleemosynary outbreak.
Two more big public balls and then the season of
chanty hopscomes toan end. These final events are
the Boys’ Brigade ball early in Sept., and the
Hospital Saturday ball later in the month. By the
way, until women learn how to run transitory ball-
committees without having the Riot Act read over
them, I think they should be “sealed oysters’’ on
the suffrage question. Never a ball arises but
fc‘ ie i re i are wigs on the green over the preliminaries,
and the final resolutions are always arrived at in a
whirl of fur and_ feathers. At a recent meeting
on a forthcoming ball one old lady, who is
perpetually in evidence, grabbed a lot of books and
hurled them at the heads of her colleagues ! She
didn’t hit anything, of course, except the moral
that poor, weak woman will always carry her
point on the Aunt Sally principle— two shots
a penny, so to speak—when indignant Billingsgate
fails her.
Dr. Talmage (a “Murrikan” friend of mine
calls him a circus preacher) was interviewed in
Sydney the other day, and his replies were all
admiration-points. He likes his audiences. By
the way, I never met a showman yet who didn’t
like his audience when it was large ; I have always
found that responsive and ready audiences weigh by
the physical ton, not the intellectual oz. But what
interested me most was the goose-profiled D.D.’s-
gush about local femininity. “ One thing your
womanhood. It’s beautiful—right throughout
this city it’s beautiful! Your ladies of position
seem to be (he is a little guarded here, you per-
ceive !) more artless than any it has previously
been my happiness and good fortune to meet!”
And yet, when I was sitting under Dr. T., on.
the School of Scandal night, when well-dressed
and ever-curious Frivolity turned up and crowded
the dowdy nonconformist females (who generally
have a lien on itinerant sensations of this sort) 1
into the aisles, I detected as much swansdown-
povvder and perpetual blush of youth in the “art-
less ’’ visages turned up to the Doctor as I have'
ever seen at a ball. And even if he meant the
adjective metaphysically, I cannot curb my bound-
ing astonishment at the artlessness of a Sydney
woman, or any other woman for that matter,
where a man is concerned (and Dr. T. must look
at the world in the third person masculine). But.
it is certainly a waving ostrich-plume in Dr. Tal-
mage’s cap that he didn’t find out himself how
heavily our “artless ladies of position” powder
their noses !
The first production of “Paul Jones,” at the'
(it debuted at the old Royal), drew a
circle brimming over with artless ladies of position
, bent on sampling the beauteous Ryley’s successor,
Mr. Wallace Brownlow, who made "his first boh
to a Sydney audience as Paul Jones in suits of
clothes facsimiles of the luscious Marion Burton’s,,
■even to those historical pale lavender grey knickers.
—but what a falling-off was there, my country-
men ! They might have been chaff-bags on Mr. B.
for all the electricity there was in them.
Facially, our very latest baritone reminded me’
tormentingly of Florence Young. He is a
large and effective person, who talks like.
Renouf, hugs his stage-love in a Bowdlerised sort
of way that must be eminently gratifying to the'
i sometimes offish disposition ot Nellie Stewart, andl
who sings—but he was too ill to be criticised when
I heard him. Still, ‘he lacks the animal magnetism
of his predecessors ; neither are his eyes Byronio
nor his legs a poem. If you want my candid
opinion as to the probable effect of a long course
of Brownlow on Australian dress-circles, I must
say that I don’t think he will be worried with,
little pink notes beyond the ordinary fate of a
good-looking, upstanding he-actor. He is merre
the cut of the little tin god on wheels of a foot-
ball club than a boudoir deity. By the way, Mr.
Brownlow has a brother—Mr. Fred. Brownlow—
who fills a Govt, billet in Sydney, and is a light in
the Naval Brigade.
The feature of Nellie Stewart, Violet Varley,
and, of course, the noble army of chorus-girls was
the run of rouge to their physiognomies. Nellie
Stewart looked like a hopeless case of sun-burn,
and Violet Varley’s new fashion of painting a red
bar like a half-mask of stage blush across the
upper part of her pert countenance, will decimate'
the ranks of her admirers in front if she persists in
it. I think May Pollard sported the newest gown
—a sort of rainbow mingling with spasms of gold
insertion. The Stewart wore almost the same,
frocklets as of yore, if my memory serves me, and
danced her pas seal in Don Trocadero’s palace as
pokerishly as ever, too. The lovely and irresist-
ible Nellie deserves piles of superlatives over most
things she tackles, but the pleated skirt of the'
danseuse isn’t included, to my mind.
“ Paul Jones ” was perforated with more or less'
happy political allusions, and Lauri, who used to
barrack in the pantomime about “Freetrade with
uld Parkes up,” gave it out as his “ Paul Jones ”
opinion that Dibbs would return to office in two
years, a wild statement that was received with
'approving yells. By the way, I am told that one of
the newly-married Premier Reid’s first official acts
was to admit a perambulator into the Botanical
Gardens! Fellow feeling for the man at the
wheel, I suppose 1
And, talking of Mr. Reid, reminds me that he’
once wrote, a long time ago, in a lady’s confession-
book that his “idea of misery” was “Tight
boots.” Perhaps he had a dim, prophetic fore-
boding even then that Bibbs’ shoes wouldn’t
quite lit him.
The opening and shutting of N.S.W. Parlia-
ment on Tuesday morning, without the millinery
support of His Excellency, was mainly remarkable
for the garden-produce in the buttonholes of
M’s.L.A. One fat man sported a deep red rose,
and another fat newly-elected senator a large pink
camelia—defensive measures taken to tone down
their maiden blushes, I suppose. President
Lackey (lovely name for a man in a horse hair
wigand a point-lace tie !) should learn a new bow
against the real circus opening on the 28th inst.
when Gov. “Duff approaches the Chamber.” As
it is, President Lackey bobbing awkwardly to the
audience with one hand on his digestion fills me
with a horrible dread that he’s going to recite
“Casablanca!” By the way, the small attendance
of women who turned up on Tuesday shows that
plumes and hanky-panky, not the charms of
our spasmodic legislators, are the things that
attract the girls.
lam in receipt of the “Canada Waltz,” by J.
Edward Sykes, dedicated to Madame Kellermann,
and which I had the privilege of hearing the com-
poser play the other day. In a musician’s hand
the waltz is bold and tuneful a thoroughly
masculine composition which will well repay
study—but its technical difficulties make it a
sealed book to the noble army of strummers. And,
talking of waltzes, Miss Maude Fitz-Stubbs has
received an autograph letter from Gov. Robinson,
congratulating her on the artistic merits of the
“ Orlando.”
Society is afflicted with a new handshake almost
as uncordial as the kangaroo-grab. It is easily
engineered. You elevate your arm, and hook the
tips of your fingers lightly, but firmly, in the
finger-tips of your antagonist, who hooks you, too,
as if each were trying to make crochet of the other.
Then you separate by mutual consent, and the
erecting is over. Mind you, people who labour
under the impression that an honest man’s grip
ought to sprain the wrists of all his women-friends
may look obliquely at these finnickings, but, after
all, the less one squeezes and paws one’s fellow-
man the better for everyone’s glove-bills, and what
may be called the crochet-hook how-do has the
blessing of many light and tightly-gloved women.

Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, August 7.
On dit that the young wife of a prominent
Sydney politician, who eschewed matrimony fur
long enough, is already giving him shrill counsel
to stick to his profession and let unprofitable
politics “ rip.” How hubby must regret those
long, lonely years when he had no sweet partner
to stimulate and encourage his flagging energies !
At one of Evangelist M‘Neill’s meetings a
steward was trying to pack late comers into seats
already comfortably filled. Everyone squeezed
into as small a space as possible, except the occu-
pants of one bench who gazed straight ahead
without moving a muscle. Presently a gigantic
female pushed her way up the aisle to the official,
who, acting under the Evangelist’s directions, led
her straight to the rebels and whispered, “ Get in
there, mum, if you can ! ” The lady accepted the
invitation, and as the choir queried plaintively
“Is there room for Mary there?” the inmates of
the pew found themselves crushed beneath a
weight of at least 18 stone. The sweet voices
carolled on, “Yes, there’s room—Yes, there’s
room lor Mary there! ] And they sang the
blessed truth. All obstinacy had melted away,
and the obstructors were become meek as little
children,
A very happy Melb. family of fair means and
stage-stricken tastes recently exacted a promise
from Wallace Brownlow to spend a Sunday even-
ing with them. Their directions to the domestic
staff on that occasion were : “After Mr. Brownlow
arrives, we are not at home to anybody.”
The Chirnsides announce their intention of dis-
continuing the every Wednesday meet, on their
land about the Werribee (Vic.), when Gov. Hope-
toun goes away—they are kept up solely out of
friendliness for him. He delights in live game all
through; and the Chirnsides’ paddocks are well-
stocked with deer. These small Wednesday fields
are found to be far more enjoyable than the big
Saturday affairs, which always mean a drag over
half the country to be ridden, with a fox at the
end and a steeplechase thrown in.
The two women at present awaiting their trial
for murder, in Melbourne, are of widely different
dispositions. One is hoity-toity and hard to
please. She turns up her nose at the prison fare,
and says that she wouldn’t give her dog such food,
and that it’s a shame to infeult a lady with offal.
Her companion in distress feels her position
keenly, cries most of the time, and is humbly
grateful for every kindness.
A dame of the fallen Boomocracy betook herself,
in the thick of her troubles, to a suburb where
she “knew” no one. When the . clan was
struggling in deep waters, the neighbours called
on Iher to a woman, but were not admitted. Later,
when the crowning, catastrophe was. averted, she
returned all their visits, saying that those “ who
had wept wiffh her when 'she wept must now
rejoice when she rejoiced ! ” The distinguished
emigree still retains the “ gushing ” demeanour so
fashionable in “ dear Lady Loch’s ” time, and un-
bends to any extent m her happier moments.
Recently she announced oracularly over the after-
noon tea and cake, that a certain financial
institution would soon be on its legs
again, not yielding the profits of yore but
removing all just cause of complaint. "Another
interesting revelation was the identity of the fairy
godmother who provided funds for a notoriously
ill-timed health-trip. This came rather as a sur
prise, every one knowing that in the past the
magnanimous donor did not relish the assumption
that one title is as good as another if they both
sound the same. But it’s easy to forgive a
humiliated rival, especially when one doesn’t know
what the future may have in store for all of us.
The story of the vice-regal dame who encoun-
tered her erring brother in an orderly’s uniform,
recalls the prodigal relative, discovered long ago in
Melbourne by a neighbouring Governor. The
ne’er-do-well was living on husks at the time,
having severed his connection with the legal firm
which had employed him as a copying clerk. One
■of the partners was on the committee of a “ society
for utilising educated paupers,” and through its
agency had obtained the services of His Ex.’s
relative on such terms as to make him a cheap
investment, despite his frequent alcoholisms.
Moreover, the poor fellow wasn’t lazy, though he
groaned at every stroke of his pen like a galley-
slave at the oar, and upset the decorum of the
•office by his audible and thirsty reveries. “ Satur-
day there’ll be 12s. 6d 1” he would observe, “and
then (imitating the action of drinking) gollv—
gollier—gollieat!”
No one was more surprised than the Brand
himself when he was suddenly snatched from the
Burning and transplanted to gilded quarters and
the cushioned ease of a private secretary. Alas !
he didn’t live long after his promotion,, though it
wasn’t joy that killed him. To the last he was as
open-handed as when in his worst straits he sold

he often said to a casual acquaintance, “Sorry I

Gov. Hopetoun’s good-looking Private Secre-
tary, in addition to his other duties, acts as
mentor to his patron s youthful son and heir.
T-his urchin, like his mother, seems to lose his
presence of mind before the gaze of the multitude,
and on his rare public appearances has to be
prompted to take off hit cop, and furtively nudged
when the ococaslori demands that he sho dd
wreath his chubby countenance in smiles. “ Mr.
Ralston is so fond of .Lord Hope !” is a remai k
one hears very often. As most people grow more
horrid every year of their lives, no doubt young
Hopeful is a good deal less riley now than he is
likely to be 20 years hence.

The proposed appointment to N.S. Wales
Legislative Council of a well-known turfite (said to have
been recommended by Toby Barton of whom he is an
enthusiastic supporter) recalls that said turfite was first
heard of when a resident of Bathurst. For a wager of
£lO be carried upon his head an enormous pumpkin from
the Duke’s Hotel, in Howick-street, to the Melbourne
Hotel at Kelso (two miles), the conditions being ttrat he
was not to touch the pumpkin with his hands from the
time he put it upon his head until he took it off at the
end of the journey. He won the wager, and thereafter
settled in Sydney with the proceeds, where his straight-
ness and gameness have earned for him the foremost
position as a layer of odds on the Australian turf.

Why should honest owners with good horse-

winning tether after only two appearances at Victorian
head-quarters. His first Flemington appearance was in
the G.N. Hurdles, where he carried 9st. 91b. to victory
The following Saturday he was raised to list. 21b. ami
won. For the Caulfield Q.N., the handicapper seems to
recognise that his duty is to make certain of preventing
the horse from again scoring, and has treated him to 12st
71b. The obvious effect of this system is that every good
horse to clear rearing expenses must, after a few races be
sent to the stud. Why should this be ?

A fair crowd, partly inspired by curiosity and
partly disgusted at the one-sidedness and commercialism
of their own game, rolled up to each of the Interprovincial
Rugby matches on East Melb. Ground. The first match
was a remarkably fine exhibition of football and finished
up by Vic. winning by three points. Plante, three-
quarter back, a 13st. man, and Tough, who looked about
Bst., shared the honours for the victors, Lusk and Roberts
being the most prominent Sydneyites. The return match
was about as rough a game as was ever seen, and the
wonder is that no corpses were left on the field A

Of the many starting-machines now used on
N.S.W. racecourses, that patented by Tom Power, Rowley
Pickering's lieutenant on S.M. Herald, appears to gain
most approval.
Last week’s racing again proved the superiority
of the machine over the human article in the matter of
starting. The Sydney suburban courses are all giving it
a trial, and Randwick will soon be the only course on
which a straggling start will be seen, and where it will b$
necessary to fine the j'ockeys. That the “ big” club will
in the end adopt the machine is certain.

Upwards of a couple of thousand people wit*

Parish, who showed himself a second White. The Uni-
versity barrackers were much in evidence early in the
game, but the drubbing their team underwent quietened
even the bargee emulators towards the finish.

How is it that the Victorian Football Associa-
tion, while professing amateurism, permits professional
boxers to play in the clubs composing it? In all other
sports—rowing, running, &o.—a man who is a professional
in one is a professional in all. But this is an unfair rule,
and should be altered. For instance, a boat-builder is
declared a professional oarsman, though he may have
never sat in a boat in his life, and he is thus debarred
from running, boxing, or bicycling as an amateur.

After all, why should not professionalism be

The Maoriland Gaming and Lotteries Act
Amendment Bill provides that the prizes offered in horse-

trust the average board of deacons. But the word of a
board of bookmakers is as good as their bond.
Australia’s best-known metallician found him-
self, early on the morning of a big race-meeting, playing
hazard with somebody who had already won £BOOO from
him. “ Doable or quits?” (£16,000 or nothing I) said the
winner. “No,” replied the bookmaker, “but I’ll play
you for £4ooo—make it £12,000 or £4OOO ?” The offer was
accepted, and the bookie won. He continued to win, and
presently contrived to owe his friend only £lOOO. Then
he arose and wrote a cheque for that amount, since which
time he has played no more hazard.

It seems that the snuffling outcry against Rose-

of the “Nonconformist Conscience,” which is a sprited
duplicate of Jabez Balfour’s liver. G. R. Sims, in the
Referee, wants to know “ What right has a Noncon-
formist to a special Conscience? We don’t parade the
Church of England conscience, or the R.O. conscience, or
the Jewish conscience. But this self-advertising, smug,
sanctimonious, Nonconformist Conscience is perpetually
poking its nose into everybody’s business, and every-
body’s pleasure.” Unfortunately, too, it has, for some
years past, been religiously dipping its flabby paw into
everybody’s pocket. t , ,
At last Melb. possesses a Chow bookmaker, who

Wool and Produce Reports.
M‘Burney, Wallis & Co. report;—The appearance of
Western wool in our railway manifests is evidence that
another wool season is close at hand. The tone of the
local market is about equal to auctions last week. No
sales were held this week, and we have only private
transactions to base our opinion upon. Next week the
usual fortnightly auctions will take place, but wool offered
will be of the usual description for this time of year, viz.,
greasy oddments and scoured. Shearing in the West is
now progressing smoothly and rapidly, and from reports
the new clip should open up well. The admission of wool
free to America is still uncertain, but we have hopes that
it will be brought about, when an increase in prices here
must be the result. It is gratifying to know that several
of our large clips, which in past years have been shipped
direct to London, will be offered in Sydney this season.
Sydney, August 6, 1894.
Nrw Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.
report Wool. —The past week has been an exceptionally
quiet; one in the local market, but at the auctions fixed to
take place on Bth and 9th inst. some of the new clip wools
will be brought into the market, and this will assist, no
doubt, to impart a more animated tone to the trade. We
have already received into the store the first instalment
of the large Bogan clip, marked E. S. & 0. HALL over
WILLEROON, and this wool opens up in capital order,
comparing favourably with the growth of the same dis-
trict last year. Prom America, the latest news to hand
concerning the Tariff question is rather more hopeful, and
would seem to indicate the possibility of an early settle-
ment of the deadlock which has cropped up between the
Upper and Lower branches of the Legislature in this con-
nection.

whole lifetime to the study of herhal science. He

Proving Herr Rassmussen’s Remedies Genuine.
“Herr Rassmussen’s Press notices agree as to
the skill he possesses as an herbalist, and the bond
fides of his testimonials appear to be well estab-
lished.” —S.A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s labours have resulted in a
manner most gratifying to himself, inasmuch as
he has received the highest recognition of the most
important scientific authority in the world—viz.,
the Academie Parisienne des Inventeurs, France,
who have not only elected him as honorary corres-
ponding member, but also awarded him their gold
medal and diploma of honor.” —Flashes (Society
Paper), Brisbane, Q.
“ Herr Rassmussen, Ph.D., the well-known
Danish herbalist and botanist, has for the last 10
years carried on a very extensive herbal medicine
manufacturing business in all the eastern colonies,
principally bringing into use many Australian
medical plants.”—West Australian, Perth/

gained for himself a reputation in the medical
world of herbal science, and his name has become

PHYSICAL CULTURE.
A LEADING AUSTRALIAN PROFESSOR.
In the Cosmopolitan magazine for June, 1894,
Eugene Sandow, the modern Hercules, very truly
remarks : “ There is no easy road to longevity.
It is only by steady obedience to the laws of
health that old age may be attained, and by
judicious regimen that it may be prolonged.”
“THE WAY TO GET STRONG, AND HOW
TO REMAIN SO ” is the title of a prospectus
issued by Professor F. Loose concerning his well-
known “Physical Exercise Chart.” Professor
Loose, who is a disciple of the late Alexander
Maclaren, of Oxford University, the father of
modern gymnastics, was, for a number of years,
chief director of exercises prescribed for the
Queensland Police Force and the pupils (both boys
and girls) of the Grammar School and the State
schools in Brisbane. He is an expert gymnast,
and AN ACCOMPLISHED PROFESSOR OF
PHYSICAL CULTURE, and has closely studied
anatomy and physiology with the view of being
able to conduct the work of his classes on a scien-
tific basis. Coming, as it does, from such a high
authority on the scientific development of the
body, the following testimonial is of great value.
Professor Loose says : “ For the last twenty years
I have been following the profession of physical
culture, and during that time THOUSANDS OF
PUPILS have passed through my hands. Of
course accidents sometimes occur, even w hen the
greatest precautions are taken to avoid them.
In such oases I HAVE ALWAYS RECOM-
MENDED ST. JACOBS OIL, and I have never
had cause to regret it, for within a few days my
pupils were always ready to resume work. I am
not speaking with a limited experience. During
my residence in Queensland I never had less than
three thousand pupils under my charge-adults
and children of both sexes. I always keep a
bottle of St. Jacobs Oil in my house, and in oases
of stiffness or soreness I WOULD ASK FOR NO
BETTER REMEDY.” Professor Loose, whose
portrait appears above, is at present in Sydney,
where he contemplates settling. His address is
Kingscourt, Wigram-road, Forest Lodge.

doesn’t decrease competition for the men out of gaol.
The man who is kept idls in a gaol, and the man who
is kept idle in a palace are equally a loss to the
community. Even the man who is kept idle in a

suicide is hereditary or not. It is inclined to believe,
however, that death is more or less hereditary E.J.

loathe the song-and-dance kind of poem which gets up to

Stayton : Jordan, when he killed the woman, may have
been senselessly drunk from bad liquor sold to him under
the indirect auspices of the State. No premeditation was
shown, and it would appear that the negro, when sober,
was kind to the woman. The case is one for commuta-
tion. If the State hangs for such an offence, how can it
adequately express the sense which everyone feels of the
difference between Jordan’s insensate crime and (say) that
of poisoning for insurance-money ?
Dear Bulletin,— By publishing H. M.
Winthrop’s article you come perilously near open-
ing a discussion of a tabooed subject—“ the
meejum of exchange.” Shall we not have to
return to the old idea of payment by produce
instead of fixed value? Meaning, that internal
wages, rent, and interest, should be based on the
ratio of a yearly Government valuation of leading
products, and rising or falling as products rise or
fall in monetary value. International exchange
or interest to be fixed by a yearly congress of
representatives from civilized nations. Interest
rises sympathetically and promptly as products
rise ; it can only be dragged down, or smashed by
a financial crisis. The idea is crudely expressed
I know; but, with a continuous fall in the
monetary value of products, only by something of
this kind can accounts be balanced and smashes
be averted.—B.
Hardly any “ frame-holders” are now
employed on Sydney Daily Telegraph, which
is pretty well all put through the linotype
machine, with a saving estimated at »6SO per

cent, or over on the Telegraph’s capital o £

Under the heading of “ Our Cables, ’’
Melb. Herald pans out a column of puerile pad-
ding about “ two cat-like burglars ” being chased
over roofs by London policemen. It would have
its guileless readers believe that it paid 3s. 9d. a
word for something like 600 words of this petty
slush. “ And a marvellous chase it was ”
“quite phenomenal in the history of such doings,
in fact.” Booh!
Editor Bulletin, — My maximum load for
elephant, camel, and horse are for ordinary
marches—l 2 to 16 miles a day at miles an
hour, ;i or 2 days’ halt in the week. “Drome-
dary ” can call them “ extended.” In re the form
of the camel’s spine, if “ Dromedary ” can manage
to look at the skeleton of a horse, he will find that
it’s spine is also arched as well as that of the
camel; but the camel’s possible load is a question
of legs. The beast is loaded when lying on the
ground with all his legs doubled under him.
When he gets up, he first unfolds his hind legs,
and rises to his knees. Then the whole weight of
the load is on the fore legs, and it must be raised
by the extensor muscles and tendons of those two
limbs alone, Are a camel’s fore legs strong enough
to straighten themselves under a load of ISOOlbs.
plus the animal’s own weight ?—Unt.
T. B. Browne’s “ Advertiser’s A.8.C.” is
in the very first rank of the world’s newspaper
gazetteers and advertising directories. The edition
for 1894 contains nearly 1000 pages of tabulated
information regarding the world’s Press, with
several excellent maps and much miscellaneous
information. A hasty glance shows that Sydney
Echo and other defunct journals are still adver-
tised as alive, while several Queenslanders, now
two years old and more, are not noticed. The
Australian section needs editing up to date.
This is the day of big things ; therefore the
biggest tailor in the big city of Sydney is a person
of note. John Graham, whose premises are
located at 510 George-street, is that person, and is
proud of the fact. His warehouse covers 500
sq. yds. of ground floor space alone. He keeps
five cutters always at work, and has the biggest
staff of workpeople constantly employed in the
biggest work-rooms in Sydney, under his own per-
sonal supervision. He has 1200 patterns on view in
some of the biggest shop-windows in the city,
which are twice as many as can be seen in one
window anywhere else. Also, he has a vast stock
always on hand, which he warrants to be all fast
colours, the newest designs, and the best quality
generally. His location in George-street, just
opposite the new markets, is one of the most
central in Sydney, and the fact makes him feel
good. To counterbalance the obtrusive bigness of
everything else about him, his prices are about the
smallest going, and he offers to produce a perfect-
fitting suit, which will gladden the wearer right
down to his boots, for 555. Also, having been
established for 24 years, he is a patriarch among
tailors, and hopes to continue so.

was often as high as 3 per cent, against N.S.W. The
localisation of mining stopped all that. At present, Mel-
bourne is doing all the work of coining for Westralia.
The yield in ’93 was estimated at 110,8900 z., and Mel-
bourne Mint coined 97,7170 z. of it. The gold passes
through the banks, and they charge the miner for
shipping, insurance, and agency, and, in some oases,
exchange on top. The exchange is 1 per cent. By
establishing coining as a local industry, the miners would
get'more for their gold. But at what expense? The
initial cost of a Mint at Fremantle or Perth would be
£55,000. The annual deficit thereafter would be about
£BOOO, for Westralia could not charge much more than
6d. per ounce for coining, and if her yield were 200,0000 z.
p.a., and if she got it all to coin and charged Bd. an ounce,
the revenue would be only £6666. The gross Mint ex-
penses would be £15,000 p.a. for years. But a Westralian
Mint would bring the Golden West into the bounds of
civilisation. At present, traders there, who want to avoid
the ruinous exchange instituted by the banks, have to
keep a current account on it; then the gold they buy
they ship direct to the Mint, and have the proceeds col-
lected by their agents. Thus do they chisel the banks
which, under reconstruction, are the mainstay of God’s
earth.

Old James Service was not nearly so optimistic
at the last Commercial of Australia meeting as he was in
the joyous reconstruction period. Of the £7,000,090
advances of the “ old bank,” £3,000,000, he said, was
earning the full rate of interest, and the other £4,000,000
“was by no means lost.” This is eminently probable,
but even the possibility that a decent percentage of
£4,000,000 may be lost is a hair-raising contingency. But
the saddest official announcement which has yet been
made about the 0.8. of A. was Service’s lachrymose
statement that “ there was no conceivable circumstance
to prevent the depositors and creditors being paid in full
if the shareholders only acted together.” The inference
is that if the shareholders don’t act together the creditors
and depositors may not be paid. And there is nothing
said about the shareholders coming out all right whether
they act together or not.

The “ Australasian Rights ” Bill people—who
seek to grab and monopolise at public expense the water-
power of the Colo and Grose Valley, the only natural force
available for the cheap production of electric power for
the lighting of Sydney and its environs—talk, in their less
responsible moments, of ultimately clearing £200,000 a
year by the grab. As there are no railway jobs going
now, some of the big railway-contracting syndicates are
in full cry after this magnificent hunk of plunder, con-
cerning the possibilities of which the public are still per-
fectly ignorant. The gang reckons that it holds the
present N.S.W. Assembly in the hollow of its hand, and
rejoices exceedingly in the defeat at the polls of many
opponents of this splendid prospective robbery—which
by the way, has its parallels in Melbourne and Tasmania,
where similar, though less extensive, grabs are in progress.

That blighted monopoly, the Melbourne Gas

the difficulty with which the said div, has been raised,
the steady decline in consumption, the constant spread
of electricity, and the obvious fact that even a gas

of showing its confidence in the galvanised banks. A
number of M.sP. interviewed the Premier to ask him to
take bank deposit receipts at their face value in payment

AfcQ.N. Bank annual meeting, the chairman
regretfully observed that “ the bank, like other institu-

it has to pay depositors.” The Q.N. has evidently a per-

insist on slicing their £ of flesh from its palpitating
vitals. There can be no doubt that depositors would have
no place whatever in a well-considered scheme of bank
re-creation, and when they are hard-hearted enough to
refuse to do the happy despatch themselves, the banks
have a right to do it for them.

Melbournian : “ Circumstances have brought
under my notice the popular ignorance of law. Nine-
tenths of the people who mortgage imagine that the
security covers all the liability, simply because mortgages
are, as a rule, so much below value. Consequently, the
question has not arisen, till a period of awful depreciation,
as now. The common thing now is to see the Chapelly
association, of the Building Society Commytee, having
devoured the security, going beyond, and torturing the
victim under a wine press screw. Only once in a while is
there such a revenge as seeing the Y.M.C.A. in the hands
of the mortgagees. So M’Neill’s most gluttonous

An enormous consignment of British whisky,
at fourteen pence per gallon, including freight and
charges, was bonded in Melbourne last vear. No more
shocking evidence could be offered as to the present
quality of the local-made article. The importer pays cost
of shipment and 9d. a quart in extra dutv-tax upon this
cheap foreign poison, and still he finds it better value
than the stuff he can buy upon the spot. In other words,
a Victorian distiller can’t supply a whisky of similar smell
and flavour at nearly treble the price. There is no ques-
tion of special brand or Hinglish prejudice in a case like
this. The liquor is bought on its merits, and a fortune
sticks out for any Victorian firm that can imitate the
aforesaid fourteenpenny .(say a shilling, shippers’ price)

Half the old Zeehan and Dundas crowd, who
laid on much fat during the silver boom, are mostly dead-

the rest moon around the empty bars looking for nuggets.
A Grenfell (N.S.W.) correspondent sends some
most convincing samples of granitoid-looking quartz,
carrying heavy gold, from the local “ Young O’Brien"
claim, where, he says, Fitch and party are now sinking a
new shaft, Bft. x 4ft., to facilitate working. The reef is
showing 180 ft. in length, both at the roof of drive and
bottom—payable Stone all through. Samples sent are
from 180 ft. level; reef, 4ft. They have now 100 tons at
grass, and reckon it should average 2oz. Six tons are
being sent to Clyde works for trial. The locals are satis-
fied. The deeper they get, the better the stone.
“The Homeward Bound reef” (continues our cor-
respondent)—“depth, 400ft.—wentas high as soz. perton,
and No. 1, the prospecting claim, six men’s ground,
panned out £lO,OOO per man. Last stone crushed, from
380 ft. level, went HJdwt.; reef 6ft. to 7ft. wide. 24 years
ago one crushing paid the six men £l5OO each clear div. in
nine weeks. The present holders are said to be now on
2oz. stone. With practical miners used to sinking, and a
little capital to back them, Grenfell can be backed against
all the rushes for good, steady work.’’

vival, afford a fair show for men of pluck and dollars.
The Golden Point reef, Grenfell (depth, 150 ft., last lot
of stone taken out 20 years ago, ground sound), aban-
doned on account of very wet weather and the Gulgong
rush being on, yielded as high as 7oz. per ton, and should

There are rumours in London that there is a
hitch in the negotiations respecting the Great Boulder
mine, Westralia, which Zeb. Lane has got Colonel North
into. In doing this Zeb. performed a tour de force , for the
Nitrate King has hitherto fought shy of gold-mines. By
the way, North recently made nearly £BOO,OOO in one
Nitrate property deal, says a Bullbtin correspondent.
The name of Westralia, says Thk Bulletin’s
London correspondent, is still insufficient to charm cash
out of the hard-hit English investor; even parsons have
ceased to be_ allured by cleverly-worded prospectuses.
The Coolgardie Co. cannot go to allotment, as some of
the directors know what they are about and refused to go
on with insufficient capital. It is said now that the capital
Of Mawson’s was not fully subscribed, although the city
liars industriously spread the story that it had been over-
subscribed. Such is the state of the mining market that
I don’t think even Mount Morgan would float for a million.
Promoters killed the goose that laid the golden egg.
Next year Westralia will probably exceed Bal-
larat district’s yield for 1893 207,8170 z.
♦ * * ♦
_ Westralia’s actual gold-results, so far, are really
trifling, and it is only its mortgage on the future that
justifies gush. Knock two millions of ounces off Victoria’s
palmiest annual yields and the odd hundred thousands
beat Westralia’s present performance with ridiculous
ease. The last shipment landed in Melbourne included
the cream of the Londonderry, and all told it barely beat
a normal Bendigo or Ballarat yield for a fortnight.
H. W. Cheesbrough writes from Coolgardie,
June 15“ Let me give you some idea of what a small
local rush is like. Yesterday a man came in from eight
miles out, and showing some 7oz. of alluvial, applied for
a Reward Claim. His name was Bonnie, a very quiet,
decent fellow, and there is no doubt that he got the gold
where he indicated. Many put a coil on bluey and cleared
out straight away. After tea, excitement raged.
The bellman patrolled Bayley-street, and, with leathern
lungs, wildly announced the fact that ‘time was now on
the wing. Roll up, roll up! Teams are now leaving for the
new rush at the 8-mile.’ In ten minutes, out of high-
way and by-way, they did ‘roll up.’ Some carried their
tools and swags, others stacked their belongings into
carts which quickly appeared on the scene. And off they
went, 200 of them, straight away. They were followed
by a continuous stream of others, who poured on to the
new field all through the night. Other teams followed in
the morning. The country for miles round Bonnie’s
claim gleamed with camp-fires and bristled with pegs—
from the modest deal-peg, split off a box and carried
out, to a forest-king of hacked-about gimlet-wood.
About midnight some humorous individual announced in
an excited manner that ‘ there was another rush about
two miles South.’ A mob packed up and cleared out at
a sling-trot without more ado. All night until daylight
men argued and cursed and got up and walked about over
each other s legs. Next morning, after a hasty meal, the
country was tickled and scratched in every direction for
miles, but it responded not. Before midday there was a
pretty general cessation of work, and all hands inter-
viewed the prospector, to look at the gold. This
took a few minutes. Then there was another rush 100
yards to the eastward. Hundreds of frantic men crowded
round the spot and it was ascertained that one lucky
fellow had found a small lizard, which he carefully stowed
away in a matchbox. This raised their spirits a bit.
Afterwards a numerous party took possession of the
‘ Reward Claim,’ upon which a ‘school ’ was soon busy at
‘ two-up.’ Another party of humourists stuck a whisky-
bottle in the fork of a gimlet-wood tree, and whiled away
the time hurling chunks of quartz at it. Others returned
to the prospector and threatened to work across the
‘ Reward Claim ’ 50 abreast, and if gold was found it was
to be given to him. Failing the precious metal, he was
to be ‘ slung ’ so far into tbe lower regions that a 40-horse
power telescope would be required to sight him. How-
ever, general good humour prevailed, and it all ended in
sulphurous language, the great bulk of the ‘ rushers *
coming back to the town as hungry as hunters, and as
jolly as sandboys. And that’s how we do it at Cool-
gardie.”

The Day Dawn, Murchison, has cleared up
for 460 oz.—time and tonnage not stated.
• • • •
Editor Bulletin,—ln your issue of June 23rd,
Just to hand, you publish a letter in which the Murchison
is damned generally. Now, we have become quite
hardened to having our 3 to 15oz. per ton returns from
the New Chum, Star of East, Emerald, etc., mines pub-
lished in the Eastern papers under the heading of “Cool-
gardie Gold Returns,” and to being generally over-
shadowed by the newspaper padding of the Southern
Field, but we must now buck. Taking your correspon-
dent’s statements in order—Fever is not rife; Seven
doctors do find work, but what their earnings may be is
best known to themselves, for there is scarcely a case of
sickness on the field. Goods are not, nor have they been,
at famine prices, for during the time that I have been on
the field (six months) I have managed to live very com-
fortably for less than 20s. per week. The gold “ shoots ’’
are not “narrow” nor confined, one to a fissure, but are
much the same as on any other good reefing field in Aus-
tralia. The lodes are strong and make stronger at depth,
and the shoots extend in oases 200 ft. to 500 ft. in length.
Your correspondent coins a new expression to suit
his outburst, on the Murchison, by using the term
“bugholes ” in stone, and it can be very easily
seen that his whole knowledge of mining and of the
field generally is made up of pure hearsay, and that,
having heard of “vughs” and “vugholes,” he has
thought fit to alter the accepted rendering to the not too
sweet appellation of “bugholes.” The stone is entirely
the opposite to that described by your correspondent,
and is a very free, “sugary,” laminated variety, between
beautifully clean walls ; “slippery heads” are the usual
thing, and the gold is well distributed throughout the
body. This is the rule, the exception is to find rich
patches in “ buck ” quartz, and probably with a propor-
tion in the “ vughs,” but the statement that “ the know-
ing ones can collect nearly all the gold in shoots by
cleaning out the ‘bugs’ and then dollying” is as
utterly absurd as it is untrue. There are 15 to 20
different mines down to water-level, and there is
not one instance of a lode having pinched or deteriorated,
but 75 per cent, of them have more settled, larger
bodies with better gold. The fissure lodes are true and
persistent. Instances: Leviathan line, 1J miles long, 4ft.
to 6ft. wide; Light of Asia, 1J miles long, 10ft. to 14ft.
wide; Campagna, 1 mile long, 2ft. to 3ft. wide; Sailor
Belt, probably 2 miles long, 4ft. to Bft. wide ; Day Dawn,
6ft. to 18ft. wide over 1 mile ; and all proved to over 100 ft.
in depth, and payable.
The mining regulations are not lax, they are as
strictly enforced as the Warden can fix them, but owing
to the defective W.A. Mining Act there are many loop-
holes. The maliciously incorrect statement about crush-
ing returns “ running from 3dwt. to 4oz. 7dwt., and being
picked at that” is effectually rebutted by the returns
from the mills as under. In conclusion, in my opinion
the field requires no booming nor newspaper padding to
set it going, but when it receives a “ foul blow,” like your
correspondent’s letter, it simply makes us rise up like one
man and fire off the truth to you. What we do want are
batteries, and there is stone enough at grass to keep 50
heads going for two or three years. We are quite content
to have the field as it is, and don’t want to be boomed and
rushed “yet a while,” and the tale of the Murchison will
be told in the most fitting way in the near future by
ounces and dividends. Returns to date are
tons ozs. dwts. ozs. dwts.

“ Ifc was a near thing.”— Wellington’s first

“No good library is complete without
Ovid’s ‘Art of Love.’’’—Jambs Smith, of the
Argus,
N.S.W. ex -Judge Peter Faucett left
.£27,415 behind him. With the exception of 45100
a year to a sister in Ireland and 4560 a year to a
lady who had charge of his only daughter, and a
legacy of 45100 each to two nieces, he left the
whole of his estate to his “ daughter and her heirs
and successors ” absolutely. Whereat there is
much disappointment in ecclesiastical circles.
Everyone is surprised to see how well
ex-Premier Dibbs bears his sudden reverse of
fortune. But yesterday he might have stood
against the world, and to-day ha does stand
against it. There is not a feather ruffled in his
knightly coat; not the reflection of the shadow of
the likeness of the sign of the ghost of a droop to
be seen in his ex-Republioan crest. Though a
shattered political world has fallen in fragments
around him, the ruins strike him fearless—as
Horace beautifully puts it. Would it be treason
to hint that what gives strength to his mind, elas-
ticity to his step, and colour to his complexion, is
M—rsh—ll’s T—n—o N—rv—ne ?
When the Reid Ministry was being formed
the S.M. Herald sent a reporter to interview Mr.
H. Parkes, and Parkes told him—according to
the printed account of the interview—that he
would never take hoffice again. Then the old
man repented of the statement, and wrote to the
Herald to flatly deny that he had over made any
suoh hobservafcion. Consequently, either the
Herald reporter or Parkes is lying, and, as the
Herald doesn’t make the slightest attempt to
vindicate its own employee, it would seem that it
is quite willing he should be the liar rather than
that Parkes should be put in an awkward situation.
The average paper isn’t built that way. When a
wild-eyed politician makes reckless statements to
its reporter, and then wants to go back on them,
the average paper responds with a brick.
A sheep is a conscientious animal, and if
he gets a fair chance he will try hard to do credit
to his pastures and temporal masters. At an in-
credibly early age a sheep measures himself with
the universe, and calculates how best to apportion
the 24 hours so as to get the greatest amount of
wool on. Generally, he decides to devote 16 hours
to feed, eight to sleep, and all to fatten. But it’s
no use a sheep making good resolutions if his
owner won’t spend a halfpenny on dip to save
him from ticks and vermin. There are no flies on
a sheep sentimentally, but plenty trouble him
practically. How is it possible for a sheep to do
himself justice and grow smooth, long, lustrous
staple when he has to continually chase the root
of his tail in fruitless endeavour to bite the ticks
snugly planted there. It is nothing to the pur-
pose to say that the situation is productive of
Romeo and Juliet romance between a gentleman
tick and a lady sheep, or vice versa. Woolgrowers
don’t want romance these times ; they want wool
to reduce the overdraft with, and when a tick and
a sheep are crossed in love (as they alwavs are
crossed) the tender sheep pines away and frets ;
he gets thin and mournful, and all the yolk goes out
of his wool. On the contrary, if a sheep is well
dipped ho has no bad dreams, and grows as fat
and jolly as an alligator, while his wool is worth
twice as much as that of the weary animal who
has to wake up every five minutes and ask his
brother to scratch him. Now, Cooper’s Dipping
Powder, for which Harrison, Jones, and Devlin
are agents, is about the most effective in the
market, as is shown by the certified fact that the
sale increased by 1,140,170 packets last year. At
last Melbourne Sheep Show sheep which had been
dipped with Cooper secured 30 prizes. Sensible
sheep-owners who see these things will surely
ponder and dipper and Oooper.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies wiH» in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail.
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
r
r
&
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tified is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.

The Missing Lady.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ho seemed a Melbourne hunemployed, and
anxiously his eye
Shot glances up and down the street at all the
passers-by; .
From weary hour to weary hour he shifted not hxs
place, ,
He stared with awful interest at every woman e
face,
I saw him when the sun shone high above his hat-
less head ;
I saw him when it sank to rest in western glory
red; ... ,
And in the stormy early morn I felt a thrill of
pain
On finding him still watching there, and getting
wet in vain.
“ My friend,” I said, “the air is cold, you’re out
of luck, I fear : ,
Accept the wherewithal to buy a pint or two of
beer.” . ..
He took the proffered silver coin, and spat on it to
prove . ,
He bore no animosity—but yet he didn t move.
“My silent friend, this doorstep’s mine ; bleak
wintry breezes blow ; '
You must be chilly sitting here, it’s really time
Then, looking north and looking south, that
shabby stranger man ‘ .
Said, “ Don’t disturb a honest bloke wot s workm
all he can.”
“ I’ve got a job, and that’s a fact; I’m workin
here on spec.” .
(The kindly raindrops washed a track adown his
grimy neck).
“ Yersee, there’ll be some more reward for anyone
to win ,
Who spots that missing lady when she wanders
off agin.
“ Her folks ’ave paid to get ’er back a dozen
times, or more,
And if she’s there , or if she ain’t, yer never know
for sure. , ,
I mean to catch ’er on the ’op, and see er sate
restor’d
When next’ they advertise ’er with a ‘liberal
reward. ’
“ I’ve learned ’er ‘ full description ’ well, I know
’er age and weight, .
She’s bound to cross my bloomin’ path, so elp me I
soon or late;
And while the times is what they are, and other
trades is slack,
I mean to wait and seize my chance for takin of
’er back.”
So, like the raven, gaunt and grim, immortalised
by Poe, ,
My friend sits on the doorstep, whilst I daily
come and go
(He is also like the lilies which do toil not, neither
spin), .1*
Watching ever for the lady who will soon be off
agin.
Too many cooks spoil the policeman.
£ £ Smith, the pertinacious Melb. apothe-
cary, has declared against female franchise—-ho
“ does not like to see woman unsex herself.
But Smith is a strong supporter of the Upper
House. He rather likes to see men unsex them-
selves.
Dear Bulletin,— The bullock - driver is
rapidly becoming extinct, and it’s a pity. He was
the only genuine whole-souled type of man we
ever had in Australia. His oaths had the true
ring of the bush, and smelt of gum-leaves and
wattle, also of “Tartarean sulphur and strange
fire.” He never swore except at his bullocks or a
new-chum, and three of his curses went further
than 40 from anyone else, either with men or
bullocks. He got drunk, too, did this bullock-
driver sometimes, and then he made things
shift. He got the horrors sometimes, too, and
ran out naked, on all fours, to round
up his bullocks, barking like a dog, and he
has even been known when one bullock was miss-
ing to yoke himself up with the near-side poler
and, whip in hand, start off on a day’s stage ; bub
this didn’t occur often and didn’t last long, for on
such occasions it ended abruptly by a “trap’
yoking himself up with the bullocky and striking
a bee-line for the nearest police-station. Next to
cursing the bullocky was an artist with his fists.
He could and would fight, and he fought with or
without cause, whichever came first, with fre-
quency and fury. Well I mind the time two bul-
lockies met at a camping-ground at the foot of the
Moonbies at an old hut. Both unyoked together,
and both wanted to bake. Both got gum-bark
and put it on the fire together, and eight or nine
bullockies looked on in silence and suspense.
Each emptied out his flour and began to mix it
into a damper ; then both reached for the sjhovel
together, and the storm burst. Outside they went
and battered each other for 80 minutes and paused
for breath. Said one : “This won t get my
damper into the fire,” and began to pull his shirt
over his battered and blood-stained head. Ihe
other said nothing, and all went back to the hut,
and the dampers were cooked in silence. Yours,

THE PILOT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Trouble has again arisen through a certain clergyman
refusing to attend a pauper funeral. This is, apparently,
a revival of the trouble of 1892. —North Queensland
paper.
Said the pilot to the pilot: “Should a sinner
chance to die
And require a Christian burial as he seeks his
Home on high,
Let him first pay to the pilot all the dues he can
afford,
Let him grease the fatted carcase—for the glory
of the Lord !”
Said the pilot to the pilot; “ Let us make a com
pact sure,
Let us organise and make a bond that ever shall
endure;
Let us stipulate for carriages and wine and festive
board
Ere we do our sacred duties—for the glory of the
Lord !”
Said the pilot to the pilot: “It is really too
absurd
To think the shepherd goes afoot to see the sheep
interred ;
‘ As thy purse so shall thy days be ’ is a rule that’s
now ignored.
But, please Heaven, we’ll see it followed—for the
glory of the Lord 1”
Then the pilots swore a dreadful oath—by Peter’s
holy pate,
And by the sacred stipend and by the Gulden
Gate,
They would blast the poor defaulter witli un-
animous accord—
They would boycott him to Hades—for the glorv
of the Lord !
So, come hither with the carriage, and come hither
with the wine,
So, come hither with the dainties and let the pilot
dine;
When you’re on your last long journey and the
country’s unexplored,
Pray be careful, for your own sake—and the glory
of the Lord 1

The Dead Infant.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
All silent is the room,
There is no stir of breath.
Save mine, as in the gloom
I sit alone with Death.
Short life it had, the sweet,
Small babe here lying dead,
With tapers at its feet
And tapers at its head.
Dear little hands, too frail
Their grasp on Life to hold ;
Dear little mouth so pale,
So solemn, and so cold ;
Small feet that nevermore
About the house shall run ;
Thy little life is o’er !
Thy little journey done !
Sweet infant, dead too soon,
Thou shalt no more behold
The face of sun or moon,
Or starlight clear and cold.
Nor know, where thou art gone,
The mournfulness and mirth
We know who dwell upon
This, sad, glad, mad old earth.
The foolish hopes and fond
That cheat us to the last
Thou shalt not feel; beyond
All these things thou hast passed.
The struggles that upraise
The soul by slow degrees
To God through weary days—
Thou hast no part in these.
And at thy childish play
Shall we, 0 little one,
No more behold thee ? Nay,
No more beneath the sun.
Death’s sword may well be bared
’Gainst those grown old in si l ife,
But, ah ! it might have spared
Thy little unlived life.
Why talk as in despair ?
Just God, whose rod I kiss.
Did not make thee so fair
To end thy life at this.
There is some pleasant shore—
Far from His Heaven of Pride,
Where those strong souls who bore
His Cross in bliss abide—
Some place where feeble things,
For life’s long war too weak,
Young birds with unfledged wings,
Buds nipped by storm-winds bleak ;
Young lambs left all forlorn
Beneath a bitter sky ;
Meek souls to sorrow born,
Find refuge when they die.
There day is one long dawn,
And from the cups of flowers
Light dew-filled clouds updrawn,
Rain soft and perfumed showers.
Child Jesus walketh there,
Amidst child-angel bands,
With smiling lips, and fair
White roses in his hands.
I kiss thee on the brow,
I kiss thee on the eyes—
Farewell! Thy home is now
The Children’s Paradise.

“Five-Skull-Island,"
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was in Batavia I met him—at the Hotel
des Indes—the leather-visaged, stormy-voiced
P|in of a very powerful man. I shall call him
Thurston. He laughed when I spoke of Five-
bkull-lsland.
‘‘Where they found the five skeletons?” he
said. “ I see you’ve made the Aru voyage. Or
was it the Ke? Lived in Ke, once, myself! ”
“Yes ! Would he take anything ? ”
He would, and did—then did again, and ex-
panded.
“ You’re a young chap to have gone poking
down into that out-of-the-way corner. Not
trade, I can see ! Money to throw away, eh ?
Or is it science? Never mind! About this
I ive-Skuli business ! People here will tell you
i m the man that sailed a prahu single-handed
from Ke to Celebes. Well—l didn’t ! Six of us
if, ~the others stopped half-way —at Five-
fekull-Island. Don’t care if I tell you ! ”
And here—a little dramatised—is what he did
tell me.
• * •
“The wind at last !” said Thurston, and
sat up. “Take!”
wasn ’t beside him. The edge of dawn
made that clear enough, and the white man got
sleepily to his feet.
Gone for water, perhaps!” The bamboo-
joint-jars had been left beside the hole, and there
w'uu^k 11 * ound them. But he found no Take.
_ it-li the men amongst the pandanus, was she ?
° men were there ! Thurston rushed out into
ie clear again and looked to where the prahu
should have been moored. Well away nor’-west-
ward, a shadow upon the dimness showed him
where she was now,
Ihe deserted laughed— a fearful sound in that
portentous loneliness—and walked back to look
x/i 18 / • ’ not ex P e oting to find it. He didn’t.
Mechanically he lit his pipe. “Tight place
■iis tune, Jim Thurston !—unless you can hang it
ou t °T. Wa Ter ! Water? Why, they've got none !”
An*. 16 rushed to count the tubes at the hole,
there ! —forgotten in the sneaking hurry.
-thurston’s teeth snapped together with the sig-
nificance of this. He glanced at the fierce-faced
sun, already peering into a remorselessly cloudless
ether. “No rain 1 They must come back 1 But,
curse it 1 they’ve got my Winchester I”
* • •
Thurston had come to the Archipelago
with theories about the Child of Nature. Most
of these he dropped in Borneo, and the few he
carried with him to the Moluccas were fewer
still when he started again south-east. Down in
Ke, amongst the Papuans, he parted with them
all but one—but that one he took away with him.
He also took Take. Take was the theory—
savage fidelity bound in dingy brown.
Take had nursed him, fever-stricken; Take had
warned him of the intended raid upon his pearl-
shell; and when, for certain guns and gongs,
kerchiefs and axes, Take’s father would have
made her over to a Bali trader, it was under
Thurston’s wing the mop-headed damsel sheltered
herself. The white man’s Winchester was an un-
answerable argument. The Bali-man, minus
goods and girl, departed cursing; the KAman,
plus the goods, lay low for the girl—and Thurston.
Thurston, warned, took boat and brevet-wife and
faded away in the night.
Cohered, throughout, without a shred of metal,
and up-ended, fore-and-aft, like the Maori war-
canoes—the plank-built prahu of the made
steady westing for three days before the east
monsoon, but, then, for yet the other three that
should have sighted Bontong, she crawled with
sweeps _ across a poor half-hundred miles of
sweltering equatorial ocean, before —somewhere
between the Turtles and the Lucapins—this un-
expected islet had given water and salvation.
• * *
For three intolerable hours the parching
runaways toiled back over the half-dozen miles
they had run in forty minutes—the two big
Papuans grinning hideously as they sweated; the
Sassak pulling grim and silent; Sondur jerking
his head round every half-minute, with a curse, to
measure the distance.
Sondur was a Banda-man—part Portuguese,
part Arab ; and in Take, too, was Portuguese
blood —the rest Malay, with just enough Papuan
to crisp her hair and take the brightness out of
her brown. And Sondur, while the white man
slept, had caught the ear of beauty with a fairy-
tale. They would not kill!—unlucky, that, at
the beginning of a new voyage. But they would
leave this white hog snoring, and with his boat,
and pearls, and tortoise-shell they would sail away
north to Banda the beautiful 1 The rest were
“in it”—would she come?
She would, and did—and now, here she was,
going back to the “ hog ” who had believed in
her!
Low-water now. They tore the sponges from
the bottom as they scraped through the passage
in the circling reef. The island lay lifeless in the
glare, and silent, but for the surf-boom from the
windward side. The white man must be sleeping
still amongst the screw-pines in the hollow.
Quick !
The nutshell of a boat was dropped over, and
three men got in—leaving one of the Papuans
with the girl. The black man flopped upon his
stomach on the deck; Take watched the water-
fetchers dodging through the big, white boulders,
for the island was of coralline limestone—worn
away all round into a mushroom edge, that cleared
the surface, as the tide was now, by half-a-fathom.
From beneath this stony canopy slipped noise-
lessly out the white man. With a dozen strokes
he reached the prahu, clambered up by the rudder,
jumped inboard, and grabbed his rifle from the
top of the after-house, left there because —though
he understood well enough a normal musket —
the Winchester was for Sondur an awful mystery.
The Ke-man sprang up and stood ready for a
jump overboard. Take turned, found herself
looking into the rifle-barrel—shut her eyes, and
waited for execution,
Thurston lowered the piece. “Woman,” he
said, “for whom was this? Not for this black
beast —nor for the other? Nor for Amil the
Sassak? Sondur, was it?”
Take spat at him—the Fidelity by whom he
had sworn ! “ Ay, Sondur! Now, shoot 1”
The boat came off, deep-loaded now with men
and water. Thurston levelled at the Banda-man’s
head. “ Stay in the boat!” he said—“ all three !
Hand up the bamboos one by one 1” Sondur’s
pea-soup face went lead-colour. Without a word
he passed the water-tubes up to the black-man.
“ Ashore again, now—you three !” The levelled
rifle emphasised the order; they paddled to the
rock, clambered out, and stood there gaping,
while Thurston and the Papuan got the foresail
up. Take crouched upon the deck. “ What a
fool this man was. He was going to spare her
after all! and take her with him —herself and the
black man only!”
The prahu had no anchor down; the big mat
foresail canted her head round to seaward, and
Thurston steered her for the reef-passage, deepen-
ing now with the first of flood. Outside the breeze
came fresher and Take held the tiller while
Thurston and the black man swayed the mainsail
up and set the cotton-canvas jib. Then Thurston,
laughing a little, came aft, put down his rifle and
took Take suddenly by her plump, brown elbows.
His deadly eye told her—she struggled fiercely,
but in a moment, with a shift of one hand to her
cotton skirt, he had hove her overboard.
“ Swim back now to thy Sondur!” he called
after her as he kept the broaching prahu off the
wind again. Stooping then for his rifle, he held
the tiller with his knees and levelled at the
astounded black man.
“ Thou, too!” he said. “Jump, dog, jump
and the Ke-man jumped.
* * *
Said this unblushing buccaneer : “ Twas
an easy swim, but there was nothing on the place
to eat, and those limestone islands never hold
surface-water long. There’s your five skeletons
for you, right enough !”

London Daily Telegraph has a yarn from
its St. Petersburg correspondent vouched for as
true. S , a well-known venerable beggar, is
just dead. He was a millionaire manufacturer,
when he was seized, long ago, with what was sup-
posed to be mortal sickness. He went to one of
the German Spas to die. But he got well. Mean-
while, his wife had been acting Mrs. Potiphar
with the foreman. S came back. He
“ sacked ” the foreman. Then he gave directions
to his trusty employes for the business to be
wrecked. It was landed in the insolvent court,
and S started as a happy beggar.

A St. Kilda man, much bothered by
Chinese and Afghan hawkers, has caused a genuine
sensation amongst those who try his garden-gate.
On touching the gate-latch, connection is formed
with a strong electric battery. Not a hawker has
called for a week now.
Tramp comes to boarding-house keeper
and asks for a meal. Is told to cut a bit of small
wood and he’ll get a good one. Tramp looks
sorrowfully at 8.H.K.: “Madam, can an empty
sack stand?” B.H.K. thereupon gives tramp a
good meal, he soon devours same and starts for
the gate. Called back by B.H.K. to fulfil
the bargain, tramp remarks more sorrowfully
than before, “Madam, can a full sack bend?”
Continues his walk.
Buckhurst, an unintentional humourist,
hired South Melb. town-hall, the other night, for
the purpose of lecturing upon Poor Sick Victoria
to a crowded audience of 15 persons and a boy.
Buckhurst came prepared with 15 proposals for
increasing the wealth of the country and making
things boom again. Firstly, he would put a
penny tax upon every ticket of admission to any
kind of entertainment. That would give the
country an impetus, anyway. The education of
servant girls in thrift until they can each of them
buy 25 acres of land for olive cultivation is
another large plank in the Buckhurst platform.
He also advocates a trade in oil with China, the
putting of prisoners on the soil to “ prepare it for
honest men,” and the branding of all good
Victorian products with a State brand. This last
suggestion shines forth like Buckhurst’s repre-
sentative bell - topper. If all the eggs were
branded “ Laid in Victoria ” they would fairly
paralyse the London market.
“YOUR LIFE IS NOT WORTH A STRAW.*’
Not worth a straw, eh? Then it was worth just
nothing—nothing at all. Who has not used that
comparison a thousand times to express absolute
worthlessness? A straw? The wind blows it
away, fire burns it up, cattle tread it in the mud,
it rots by the roadside. What of it ? Who cares
for a straw ?
Yet this is exactly what a doctor recently said
to one of his patients, “ Your life is not worth a
straw.'’ How much is a doctor worth who will
speak so to one that trusts him, and has no hope
but in his skill ? For my part, if he were up for
sale at auction, I would bid one straw tor him—no
more. Even if what he said was true, he had no
right to say it. Such a doctor is more likely to
kill with his tongue than to cure with his drugs.
A woman tells the story, and she tells it well.
If it doesn’t sound like the truth, then I don’t
know what ever does. The dates and the facts
are all there, plain and orderly.
“In the summer of 1878,” she says, “I found
myself feeling tired, languid, low-spirited, and
weak. I felt as if some evil were about to happen.
My appetite was poor, and after eating I had
excruciating pain at my loins and sides. There
was a horrible gnawing pain at the pit of my
stomach, and a rising in the throat as if I should
choke. My head felt as though I had a ton weight
on it. Gradually I got worse, and for months
could take only liquid food. At night I lay awake
for hours altogether.
“Later on I suffered greatly from nervous
prostration. My legs trembled and shook so I
feared to fall. If a knock came to the door I
trembled from head to foot. I had frequent attacks
which began with palpitation of the heart and
sudden stoppage of the breath. At these times I
was speechless and helpless. They say I looked
like a corpse, cold and bloodless, rny finger-nails
and lips having turned black. After a while this
would pass off, leaving me weak and prostrate.
I got so emaciated and thin that I was only a bag
of bones, and so weak I had to take hold of the
furniture to steady myself as I crossed the room.
As time went on the nervousness and forebodings
of evil so increased that I feared I should go out
of my mind. The neighbours said it would be a
mercy if the Lord would release me from my
sufferings.
“In this condition I continued for over four
years, during which time I consulted five doctors,
but nothing they gave me did any good. They all
said my ailment was heart disease, and one said,
* Your life is not worth a strata.’
“In despair I gave up taking physic, as I felt
that nothing would save me. In May, 1882, ten
years ago, a lady (Mrs. Richardson) called at my
house, told me of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
and strongly advised me to try it. I did so, and
felt somewhat better after the first bottle; and by
the time I had taken three bottles I was completely
cured. From that to this I have had no return of
the attacks, and am so strong I can do any kind
of work. But for Seigel’s Syrup I should have
been in my grave long ago. 1 wish others to know
this, and will answer any who call or write.”
(Signed) Emma Wickenden (wife of William
Wickenden, gardener), Pembroke Villas, 123,
Moffat Road, Thornton Heath, March 17th, 1892.
So it turned out that her life was not only worth
a straw, but worth a whole golden harvest of health
and better days. Yet no thanks to the doctors.
Her complicated symptoms puzzled and alarmed
them, to be sure, but why? Is it not the doctors’
duty to understand such things ? Most assuredly.
Just as a lawyer should know the law, or a pilot
the rocks, tides, and lights of a coast. Had some
of these medical men known that Mrs. Wicken-
den’s malady was indigestion and dyspepsia, and
not heart disease, they might possibly have re-
lieved her. But, confused by the symptoms, they
were blind to the cause. We may well wonder if
there are many such doctors in England.
Oases like this show that the clear sight belonged
to Mother Seigel; and to her remedy hosts of
people in this country are indebted for physical
salvation when, in very truth, their lives seemed
as straws.
Remember, this was ten years ago, and the
malady has not returned, showing that the cure
was a permanent one.
A Tale of Vanderlin Island .
CHAPTER I.—O[?] MAPARUNGA, THE CANOE-MAKER;
AND WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW.
Maparunga was noted amongst his tribe as a
clever fashioner of canoes. His people were sea-
coast blacks of Carpentaria, having their abode
principally on the Sir Edward Pellew Group of
Islands. The canoes used by this people were not
the common kind of rude and hasty manufacture.
They were far more cunningly contrived. Sheets
of pliable bark were cut to a particular pattern so
that when pieced together they fitted harmoni-
ously into the shape of a really presentable little
craft. These strips of bark had to be sewn to each
other with currajong string and the seams next
rudely caulked; then, when an outrigger had
been fixed on, she was ready for inter-island
navigation, and could stand some rough weather,
too.
Now, Maparunga was a born shipwright in his
humble, aboriginal way, and could manage a
canoe after building it, and, moreover, could con-
ceal it in so dexterous a manner beneath the man-
groves, or up an inlet, as to look like part of its
surroundings. This accomplishment was one
often needed in the flight or pursuit of native
warfare, when to swim across a creek swarming
with sharks and alligators meant certain death.
As yet the whites of this generation had not
troubled the waters surrounding this lonely group.
In the days probably of Maparunga’s great-grand-
father a bluff-bowed ship had come there and
stayed some time, the crew boating about, sound-
ing, and using strange instruments. Finally,
they had gone away with, if the natives only knew
it, their island homes neatly charted and named
by that captain who earned a deathless name for
himself. Only the long, red island of Vanderlin
retained the name given by the old Dutch sailor
who saw it from a distance and called it Cape
Vanderlin.
But Dutch and English had gone and their
coming been forgotten in one generation, for black
tradition lives but from father to son. Even
the dusky Malays who once sailed their proas to
the coast fishing for beche-de-mer, and who fought
with the aborigines, had ceased their visits for
many years, and were almost forgotten. So
Maparunga, the canoe-maker, had never seen
anyone but men of his own race. True, he had
heard dimly of the whites from the natives of the
mainland, but they came not through the broad
fringe of mangrove swamps and slimy, oozy
creeks ; nor from the sea as Flinders had come ;
and Maparunga knew nothing of ships, save the
light, frail vessels he built so well.
Maparunga had his camp in the inlet that bites
into the middle of Centre Island. The camp was
on a beach of pure, white sand laved by a sea of
brilliant blue, so clear that fish and plants a
fathom or so deep looked as though one could lean
over the canoe side and grasp them. Behind were
low, abrupt hills, rock-crowned, with jungle half-
way up their sides out of which shot up here and
there a tall and beautiful palm.
The sun was declining, and Maparunga’s atten-
tion was drawn to the approach of his gin laden
with the afternoon’s hunting spoils. As he licked
his lips in anticipation, a shrill call from the
highest of the rocks behind him made him jump
up and look. A blackfellow—Nimpoo, of his
own tribe, and a friend of his —stood there beckon-
ing eagerly, and Maparunga hastened through a
native path in the jungle, up to the boulder-
strewn summit, and joined the other. There
Nimpoo grasped his shoulder and pointed north-
ward, and away past the jutting-out reef of
Craggie Island, on which the white surf never
stops from breaking, they saw a strange and
wonderful thing.
It was a great sea beast with white wings
coming steadily on between Craggie Island and
Yanderlin as though it was going to run right on
to the black bank of mud and mangrove that
marked the mainland.
Then Maparunga called to his wife, and she and
his children and all in the camp covered up the
fires with sand and ran into the jungle ; and all
the blacks watched the strange beast until it came
right opposite to where they were, but much closer
to the red rocks of Vanderlin Island, and then,
the strange thing from the wide sea where canoes
cannot go far, shut up its wings and stopped,
and the blacks watched it until the sun sank
behind them over the top of West Island, where
there is always good water and sometimes good
roots to eat.
“ When it is dark it will come over and eat us
up,” said the wife of Maparunga. “I shall stop
in the scrub all night.” And the others all said
the same except N impoo and Maparunga. They,
too, watched with the others until two lights
burned on the beast, and that was all they could
see of it. Then Maparunga and Nimpoo got a
canoe and went in the darkness to look at the

beast with wings. But they did not paddle straight
across, for they were cautious, as all of their race.
They went across the open sea between them and
South West Island; on by the dark mangroves
and black shadows where there are so many
creeks, where at night the alligators splash and
grunt in the mud. Still keeping their eyes on the
two lights burning on the beast, Maparunga, the
canoe-maker, and Nimpoo, his friend, paddled on,
not frightened at the strange noises they heard to
their right, for they were used to them. At last
they reached the southern end of Vanderlin Island,
and crept on close in shore until they were
opposite the beast, then they stopped and listened,
and heard men’s voices, and both guessed at once
that it was a great big canoe and no beast, for,
though they could not understand what was
spoken, they knew they were men like them-
selves that they heard. Softly they paddled out,
for it was a dark night, and went round and round
the big canoe, and heard men talking loudly, as
men talk before they fight. Then they went
straight back, across the open water, and not
round the long way by the mangrove shore ; for
they were much braver men now that they had
found out what it was.
For a long half century, ever since the En-
deavour had weighed her anchor, the silent
group had been unvisited and unseen by Euro-
peans. Now, a schooner had come down through
the lifeless Carpenterian sea; wherein there is
never a sail, and seldom a bird; and anchored
under Vanderlin.
Chapter ll.—What Maparunga saw on thb
Island of Vanderlin.
When the two natives arrived at their camps,
they reassured the others, but told them to keep
close, for the men might be bad men. Then, they
took some food in the canoe and started back in
the darkness to the island of red rocks. When
they reached there, Maparunga, who was so skil-
ful, hid the canoe so that no one could find it, and
the two went high among the rocks, ate their food,
and waited.
When the light came and the sun rose behind
Vanderlin, they saw men on the big canoe moving
about, and presently a little canoe, like their own,
only bigger, fell into the water, and men—more
than they knew how to count, came down the side
of the big canoe into the small one. Four of them
—they could count that number —sat by them-
selves, and four others, all alike, sat down one
after the other, and, putting out long paddles,
made the canoe move to the land.
Right below where the natives were hidden was
a sandy bea-rh, and to this the canoe came, turned
round, and the four men who sat together got
out, but the others stopped in the canoe. The
four men walked off together a little way along
the sand, and then they parted, and two walked
away from the other two, but only for a short
distance. After a very little while one man again
walked away from each of the two, and left them
standing turned partly away from each other.
Suddenly, the two men turned their heads round,
lifted one arm, and there was such lightning and
thunder came out of their hands that Maparunga
and Nimpoo were too frightened to look; but
they both heard a shriek like a gin’s come across
the sea from the big canoe.
When they looked up again one man was lying
on the sand, with blood coming from him like a
native who is speared, but the others all stood
■upright. Then two men went and looked at the
one fallen down; then they came back to the man
who stood quietly there, and said something to
him, to which he bent his head. Next, they
turned away and went back to the canoe; here
one of the men who had waited put some things
on the sand, and then four men came and carried
the dead man away, and they all went back in the
little canoe to the big one. The man who was
left behind watched them go, standing quite still
until the big canoe put up her white wings and
moved away towards the sea where there is no one
living. Then he lifted one hand, shook it, calling
out aloud, and turning away put both hands
before his eyes.
Maparungo and Nimpoo, watching the big
canoe, saw something white fall from it into the
sea. The big canoe turned round partly, _ a little
canoe dropped into the water quickly, men jumped
in, paddled off and, picking the white thing out of
the sea again, took it back to the big canoe, and
the big canoe went on, on, out of sight. Now,
although Maparunga and Nimpoo saw this, the
man did not, for when they turned to look at him
again he was sitting on a rock with his head still
buried in his hands.
This is the end of what Maparunga and Nimpoo
saw on the Island of Vanderlin; only that the
white man left behind made friends with them,
and lived with their tribe for many years teaching
them good things, until one day old Maparunga,
the clever maker of canoes, told him of the white
thing he and Nimpoo saw fall from the big canoe.
Then the white man got very sad, and when they
heard from other tribes that more white men were
living on the mainland beyond the mangroves, he
got them to take him up the salt-water river to
some friendly tribes who knewjthe whites, and who
took him on to his own people, for he never came
back. But to the day of his death old Maparunga,
the clever maker of canoes, looked out each morn-
ing to see a big canoe with wings coming from the
sea where no man lives, bringing his white friend
back again.
“ In a certain year, which I need not particu-
larise, I, Lloyd Broughton, then newly-married,
started on a long voyage in a schooner-rigged
yacht, owned by two intimate friends of mine.
On board were the two brothers Grenow, the
owners of the yacht, my wife and her brother.
We were out many months and visited Java, and
touched at several other islands in the Coral Sea.
Then, as my wife was anxious to see real savage,
uncivilised country, we made south to the north
coast of Australia, which we understood to be
then unsettled. This led us to the scene of my
crime and its expiation. If ever I loved a human
being I loved my young wife. But I am, or
was, of a morbidly jealous nature ; one of the
wretched self-tormentors of this world who seek
out doubts to construe and torture them into con-
firmation of their own vile and degrading sus-
picions. If any man who reads this does not
kno w ho w jealousy destroys a man’s best impulses
and changes his nature, let him humbly thank his
Maker.
“ Being so long on board together, this hateful
thing within me led me to suspect that my wife’s
affections had been transferred to the younger
Grenow. Now, as I, a dying man, solemnly declare,
there never was the slightest reason for such a
wicked thought. And I am confident to the day
of her death that my unhappy wife’s affection for
me was unaltered; even after my crime of mur-
dering the innocent man whom I wrongly sus-
pected.
“ Seeing then that no one but myself could have
suspected the delusion that I at last believed to
be the truth, my fatal outbreak of rage and
wrath excited an almost equal storm of indigna-
tion in the other three men. We were just then
sighting some part of the South Coast of the Gulf
of Carpentaria, a group of islands called the Sir
Edward Pellew Group. I had conceived the wild
idea that our purpose in visiting that lonely,
unknown part was to leave me on shore—desert
me, in fact, as opportunity offered. Nobody but
a man goaded by jealousy, who is, after all, a
madman, could have believed such a thought
could be harboured in the breasts of my wife or
my friends. In the end I was left —but, justly.
“My rage was so violent that they at last thought
me mad, and were about to confine me, when I
grew quite calm and insulted the younger Grenow
so grossly and vilely that I awakened in him,
his brother, and my wife’s brother, a mortal
hatred equal to my own. That night we anchored
close to a long, low island, with red, bare rocks
on it. Our arrangements were made, and the
conditions have been faithfully kept by all hut
me. I am murderer and perjurer—both.
“We were to proceed ashore and fight at sunrise,
the conditions agreed to being that, after the duel,
the survivor stayed on the island alone, bound
never to return to Europe if he lived. This was
what I insisted on in order that if I fell my adver-
sary should not return in the yacht with my wife.
“We landed, and I shot Grenow through the
heart at the first fire. I wonder his brother did
not shoot me, but the conditions were honourably
observed on their side, and I was left alive on the
uninhabited island of Vanderlin.
“No sooner was the deed done and I alone, than
the devil that had tempted me deserted me. At
once remorse opened my eyes to the hideous crime
of which I had been guilty. I had aspersed the fame
of the woman I loved best on earth, murdered my
friend, reduced myself to the condition of a worse
than outcast Cain.
“ From the depths of my anguish I was roused
by the timid approach of two natives; they were
friendly, and for years I lived with their tribe
expiating my offence in the miserably degraded
life of a savage.
“ I taught then what I could, toying to do some-
thing in return for my wasted life; but O, the
hideous agony of those years of lonely remorse !
One day old Maparunga, one of my rescuers,
told me that he saw a white object drop from the
side of the yacht and it was immediately rescued
by a boat. At once the conviction flashed across
me—a conviction I now know to be true —that my
poor wife, hearing of my fate, had sprung overboard
to try to swim to join me.
“ From that moment I could rest no more ; I
must go back, in spite of my vow, make full con-
fession of the injustice of my accusations, and die.
I was no longer fit to live, even amongst savages.
“ Hearing that white men were settling on the
mainland I persuaded the blacks to take me to
another friendly tribe, and so finally joined my
countrymen. In time I worked to the more
settled parts and earned enough to pay my passage
to London. Here I found some friends who re-
membered me, and from them I learned that I
was too late ; my wife died of grief before the
yacht reached home. I was doomed not even to
make such wretched expiation as I tried to, I
contrived to let the elder Grenow know of my
return, and he at once demanded the fulfilment of
the conditions —namely, that if the survivor broke
his oath and returned he should either give him-
self up a self-confessed murderer, or kill himself.
Since then he has sent me word to keep my
wretched life, but this I do not want. I am
writing this to send him as a proof of the wicked
injustice of my charge against his brother.”

Why Was I Born a Man?
“ How the proletarian must envy the sleek and well-
groomed horses he sees in Rotten Row !”— Reynolds'
Newspaper.
My lady’s poodle softly fares,
He’s fat and sleek and well;
My lady’s pony’s happy lot,
His sides a-glisten tell.
My lady’s flunkey’s swelling paunch
Is round and spick and span :
I view the pampered pack and ask—
“ Why was I born a man ?”
My lord hath many a lazy hound
To bark at will and bay;
My lord hath many a sturdy steed
And many an ass to bray.
My lord hath many a dainty pet
From distant Hindostan:
I view the fattened crew and cry—
“ Why was I born a man?”
I cannot fawn upon my lord
Or lick my lady’s hand,
I cannot whine or cringe and crawl
Among the menial band ;
I cannot run the fox to earth
Or lead the Derby’s van—
I can but curse my fate and say,
“ Why was I born a man ? ”
I sometimes doze awhile and dream
I’ll yet (as Buddhists say)
Re-incarnated find myself
Upon some future day;
With waving mane and satin skin
I’ll canter if I can,
Among my kin, and bless my stars
I wasn’t born a man.

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST PAVENO.
With Prefatory Note by Rolf Boldrewood.
Opinions of the Press :
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par. The •
author who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway
parts. ’ A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
jh •• t\Jq wr iter has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has* by many years’"experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer,
rr .' ’ nnocspsses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sidney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poo. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘A Cup of Cold Water’is, perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to .purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph,
July 15, 1893.
“‘The Last of Six and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co) This is a collection of short but
eranhic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of Tub
