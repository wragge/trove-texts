None so good as Scotland’s Best
THE very finest of whiskies are distilled in Scotland
—possessing a character that is distinct and
inimitable. And Dewar’s is the finest of them all.
Generations of endeavour to please those whose
palates are keyed above the average have resulted in
the maintenance of Dewar quality at a point which
is hardly conceivable of improvement.

HIS
BOOKS
Horse-lovers All
Australians have lost the reputation they
once had overseas as horsemen. The fact
is the generality of Australians never could
ride, as the great riders of the world under-
stand the term. The author of the first
of the books reviewed below saw this feat
performed at San Luis Potosi:—
Riding his horse, a charro chased a wild
mare, and when he had the chance he
jumped on her back. When she had unsuc-
cessfully tried every vicious trick in her
repertoire to shake him off, the charro
spurred her into a gallop,- and then called
his tame and splendidly-trained saddle horse,
which immediately came alongside the racing
mare, whereupon the man jumped grace-
fully back into the saddle.
In the nature of things Australians are not
cross-country performers of the class of the
English and Irish. The vast majority have
never been required to ride over a fence,
and so we have few steeple or even hurdle
events; and the idea of an amateur riding a
Grand National winner at Flemington, as has
often happened at Aintree, is too remote to
be entertained. Our ignorance of an art
which is regarded as nationally important
in England, France, Germany, Italy and
elsewhere is by no means a recent develop-
ment due to the growing popularity of cars
and city life. It was found as long ago
as 1914 that over 50 per cent, of A.I.F.
recruits, outside the Light Horse regiments,
knew nothing of riding or horsemastership.
It is safe to say that four young men out
of five at a Randwick meeting would fgll
off if put up in so much as a preliminary
canter; at an Irish meeting like Leopards-
town the same proportion would haV~e a
good chance of staying on, not only in the
preliminary but in the race. Yet Australians
are more interested in horses than most
people; they discuss them constantly and
read columns daily about their doings, and
to that extent they may be said to love
them. Whether they are sufficiently' de-
voted to read the excellent books which are
discussed below remains to be seen. There
is nothing about racecourse betting in them.
A Master Horsemaster
Aime Felix Tschiffely, author of Southern
Cross to Polar Star (Heiiiemann; 155.),
was inspired with the idea of riding from
Buenos Ayres to New York, a journey of
10,000 miles which includes deserts, icy
mountain ranges and tropical jungles. He
was given two unbroken Creole horses by
their breeder—Gato, 15, and Mancha, 16
years of age. ,
Creoles are the descendants of a few
horses brought to the Argentine in 1535
by Don Pedro Mendoza, the founder of the
city of Buenos Ayres. These animals, were
of the finest Spanish stock, at the time the
best in Europe, with a large admixture of
Arab and Barb blood in their veins.
All he reveals about the appearance of his
horses is that Gato was “a cross between a
bay and a dun,” that Mancha was “a pie-
bald,” and that they had “sturdy legs, short
thick necks and Roman noses.” The photo-
graphs show them with straight, rather loaded
shoulders (yet neither is at all over at the
knees), sloping pasterns, immense barrels,
shortish backs and powerful quarters. They
seem to be about 15 hands, or perhaps a
little less, and they' have heads like Clydes-
dales. In most of the photographs they
are holding their big heads up in an alert
manner. There is no indication that they
ever lost condition.
On the day before beginning his 20-houVs’
journey across the Matacaballo (Horse-
killer) Desert he gave them nothing to
drink (“I wanted them to be thirsty, and
therefore not likely to refuse a good drink
immediately before starting out”), and
with one precaution and another, added
to their native hardiness, he got them
across so fresh that “anybody might have
believed they had only just returned from
a short canter.” He rode them alternately
for the 2i years that the journey took, and
never gave either a sore back!
The author might be suspected from these
extracts of being a braggart, such as,
for some strange reason, almost every lone
wanderer, from Borrow to the young
Scot whose “To the Streets and Back”
was reviewed some time ago on this Page,
has been. Nothing could be further from
the truth. One of his chief charms is his
modesty. Everything is understated but
the capabilities of his horses. In spite of
its reticences his story is exciting, full of
information about the strange habits of
the half-savage people with whom he came
in contact, and of sidelights on their almost
unbelievable barbarities. But, above all, it
is a work for horse-
lovers. Gato and
Mancha were
turned out on an
estancia at the end
of the trip to
spend the rest of
their lives in luxury, and R. B. Cunning-
hame-Graham dreams in a preface of the
after-lives of these “immortals of the equine
race,” as he calls them.
I like to imagine their infinite celestial
home—for our imagination can but con-
ceive what we have known on earth, how-
ever sublimated —as a great prairie, with
the winds sweeping over the perennial
grasses, till they roll like waves. Pasture
shall never wither there, nor lose its suc-
culence. 'Water shall never fail.
And so on. A beautiful preface and a
beautiful book.
Hunting in the Victorian Era
G. J. Whyte-Melville, whose novels have
just been republished by London “Country
Life” at 6s. each, would have found little
in common with Mr. Tschiffely except h
passion for horses. It is doubtful if he knew
much about their material requirements,
though he knew all about schooling and
riding a certain type of horse. He was a
Guards officer, and many Guardsmen of his
day, though capable of galloping across the
mighty oxers of Leicestershire, would have
made a poor fist of physicking or even
grooming and bedding down a hunter. The
celebrated “Roddy” Owen, who, like Whyte-
Melville, was a soldier-jockey, and was
killed by a fall from a horse, is reported to
have said that he had never saddled one
of his mounts. Such jobs were reserved for
grooms in nineteenth-century England.
Whyte-Melville is one of the few first-
flight hunting men who have written really
well about hunting. His Riding Recollec-
tions, which deals with such subjects as
“Hand,” “Seat,” “The Use of the Bridle”
and “The Abuse of the Spur,” is still a
textbook for those who aspire to the
supreme heights of horsemanship. He is as
self-effacing as Mr. Tschiffely, never men-
tioning his own feats when he can use those
of others as object-lessons. The desire
for perfection which inspired some eques-
trians of-the Victorian era may seem a little
overdone to the present generation.
I remember seeing the famous Lord Angle-
sey ride his hack at that pace [a canter]
19 times out of Piccadilly into Albemarle-
street before it turned the corner exactly
to his mind.
It is only one instance of the “untiring
patience” with green horses which, as he
says elsewhere, must characterise “an edu-
cation that should be gradual as the moon-
rise.” Kate Coventry is one of the most
popular of his novels. Kate was a Bright
Young Thing of the mid-Victorian era, a
sad romp as a girl, and inclined to be fast
as a young lady. We soon find her in a
hansom with her cousin John. She lives
in Lowndes-street, and goes riding in the
Row, several hundred yards away— alone!
“Kate,” objects her aunt, “these morning
scampers are really quite uncalled for;
they’re spoiling your figure and, complexion;
it’s improper—more, it’s unfeminine.”
However, Kate continues in her daring
courses, and is introduced eventually to
Captain Lovell, handsome, a skilful dancer
—as he proves when he leads her out in the
“Colombetta” waltz—and capable of singing
a capital song, bift, alas, a reputed roue.
The story is based on her passing fancy
for this dangerous creature, and her realisa-
tion, ere it is too late, of the solid worth of
another. The novel is chiefly interesting to
present-day readers for its vivid descriptions
of hunting, first with a provincial pack and
later with the Royal Buckhounds. Carted
stags are still hunted around Ascot and
Aldershot in the manner described. Kater-
felto isn’t so good, chiefly because the
period is the middle of the eighteenth cen-
tury. The novelist had to rely on his
imagination and historical knowledge for
his atmosphere, and, anyhow, he evidently
didn’t know the West Country, where most
of the action takes place, as well as he did
the Midlands. There is an enthusiastic de-
scription of a day with the Devon and
Somerset which culminates with a picture
of “the noblest pack of hounds in Europe
clamoring round a stag at bay.” It will
exasperate opponents of blood sports to this
day.

The Mind of Noel Coward
Many people ask in bewilderment as they
leave “Cavalcade,” “What is Coward getting
at?” If, say,Wells had set out to glorify the
England of the past 30 years he might have
dramatised thie phenomenal strides that
have been made in education, temperance
and health—an»d particularly the health of
the children of the poor. Also the social
effects of the development of the motor-
car and mechanisation generally, and of

NOTE
THE DIFFERENCE
Those who have any doubts as to how they should vote on the Legislative Council Referendum on May 13th should
study the following facts. They should convince anyone that Reform of the Legislative Council is absolutely necessary
in the interests of future safety. If things are left as they are, and the Councd is not reformed, the next
Revolutionary Government, by further swamping the Council, could pass any socialistic legislation it desired.

is an amazing story of romance, mystery
and adventure, staged on an island of
the Pacific formerly the retreat of the
buccaneers. Whilst it is a wonderful
effort of the most imaginative of “Bul-
letin’’ and “Sydney Mail” writers, Harold
Mercer, the story carries a sense of stir-
ring reality in every paragraph. A com-
plete novel by this author, whose short
stories are well known, has long been
anticipated. “Amazon Island” lives up to
all the anticipations. Ready in May.

the constitutional revolution which resulted
from the rejection by the Lords of the
Education Bill (1906) and the Licensing Bill
(1908). Churchill would certainly have had
a lot to say about the navy which checked
the Kaiser at Agadir, and, all said and done,
won the World War. Coward ignores the
navy as completely as he does Parliament.
Imagine a pageant of Empire by Kipling,
or Galsworthy, or Chesterton, or Masefield.
One can’t say what these great men and
patriots would have put in, but it is easy
to say what they would have left out;
namely, almost all the incidents that have
been emphasised by Mr. Coward.
On the surface “Cavalcade” isn’t an intel-
ligent man’s outlook on a key epoch in
English history at all, but that of a Cock-
ney flapper. The author is concerned, not
with England, much less the Empire, but
with London. The only scene outside the
range _of Bow Bells—barring the visionary
ones at the front—is of a beach at some
such resort as Brighton. Stage performers
get most, attention. Not great figures like
Irving and Ellen Terry, whom mental adults
think of in relation to the stage of the
period, but Victorian musical comedians,
Edwardian beach-troupers and Georgian
cabaret-singers. It is as if a writer dealing
with the English stage in the third quarter
of the eighteenth century had dragged in
the contemporary equivalents of the
Crummies family and left out Garrick.
Exhibitions of mob emotionalism come
next. The funeral of Queen Victoria, with
the Marryot household in deep mourning
and much impressed by the fact that five
kings are following the corpse; the Mafe-
king and Armistice street revels, the departure
for the front of the C.1.V., with a band,
laughter, tears and the soldiers singing
“Auld Lang Syne” as the troopship
moves out—these are just the manifesta-
tions which the Stracheys of modern Eng-
land have been deriding for some time
past, but which a flapper would be liable
to weep over. The reception by a duchess,
which gets a long sequence to itself, is an-
other example of the kind of irrelevancy
that a flapper would think important. The
World War scenes nearly all consist of flap-
per’s-eye views—girls singing recruiting
songs at soldiers, girls kissing soldiers good-
bye, a W.A.A.C. lighting a cigarette for a
wounded soldier as she walks with the
stretcher-bearers through Victoria station.
Up to a point the film consists of a series
of familiar theatrical devices to start the
ready tear, mingled with amiable digs at
the comicalities of the Victorians and
Edwardians. Then the W T orld War
sequences begin, and a different note in-
trudes. The author is finding it impossible
to laugh any. more, and has begun to hate.
There is a tuneless jazz-moan towards the
end which goes something like this:—
Why is it that civilised humanity
Must make the world go wrong?
In this hurlyburly of insanity
Your dreams can’t last long.
And the chorus asks:—
Why, if there’s a God in the sky, why shouldn’t
He grin ?
The concluding sequences, with their shots
of blinded ex-soldiers, impoverished ex-
soldiers, revolutionaries and morons in
expensive West End restaurants are utterly
pessimistic and cynical. “Here,” jeers Mr,
Coward, “is the England that Englishmen
gave lives for in hundreds of thou-
sands! What do you think of it?” But
always when things get a little too lacerat-
ing, his sense of the theatre comes to the
rescue of the box-office, and he administers
a form of anaesthetic: “God Save the King”
rings out, or a Union Jack is flown. The
flappers get over their uneasy feeling that
something has gone wrong. “It’s all right,”
they tell one another. “He’s an Empire
man at heart.” He gets his happy ending
in that way. “All’s well with England!”
cry the flappers as they stream out, with
the triumphant strains of the National
Anthem blaring in their ears.
If that was the message Mr. .Coward set
out to deliver, then his manner of deliver-
ing it would imply that he has a mind as
empty as the minds of those who accept
“Cavalcade” as an “Epic of Empire.” But
he has a first-class mind. It is in particu-
lar a satirist’s mind. All his shows—includ-
ing by all accounts the latest, now running
in London—have been attacks on different
aspects of English society. So he is not
a patriotic dunderhead who has tried to
show one of England’s most important
epochs in a favorable light, and has
inadvertently dropped a series of bricks
by picking out for presentation episodes
which intelligent moderns consider either
funny or discreditable. In other words.
“Cavalcade” is a satire, and will be recog-
nised as such by future generations. Its
remarkable feature is the diabolical adroit-
ness with which it has been framed. It is
at one and the same time an orgy of Jingo
sentimentalism and an assertion of the
author’s anti-imperialism. He has got the
results he wants both ways. The feat must
be almost unique in the history of the
drama.
JOHN DALLEY.
The Freelance and the Slump
My experiences may be helpful as an
appendix to Henry Bateson’s “The Free-
lance and the Slump” (R.P. 26/4/’33),
Before the slump I had an Australian
connection. Certain publications reserved
pages for me in every issue.
Then things happened in a hurry! My
regulars cut my rate of payment or reduced
m.v space—in some cases they did both.
Others cut me out altogether and others,
either in spite of my help or because of it,
put up the shutters. There w-as nothing for
it but to try the other side!
I sought the cream of English literary
agents. When he agreed to handle my stuff
I thought my fortune was made, and in my
innocence I signed on with him for 12
months. It was a year wasted. He sold one
story for a tenner and, being bound to put
all my stuff through him, I had to give
him a story to handle which I had already
placed. He got his cut of 12 guineas which
he never earned.
When my sentence was up I went to
other first-flight agents. I also got a first-
flighter in New York. Then I sat back to
cash cheques. They never came! Instead,
they returned me MSS. which they said it
would be waste of time and cash for them
to try to handle. Sooner than commit
the MSS. to the flames I decided to give
them a fly myself. I sold one to “Atlantic
Monthly”; yea, I got a hundred dollars for
it, with exchange added. I sold others for
175, 60, 50, 110, 110, 130, 25 and 25 dollars.
Every one of them had exchange added;
every one had been rejected by agents, and
every one was bought as soon as the editor
saw it.
A writer must study his markets, and he
must remember the advice given me by a
consulting editor of a big group of Yankee
mags.: “Bear in mind the mental age of
the average mag. reader is about 14.” It
is well also to remember the advice given
by another overseas editor: “Never con-
fine yourself to the truth.” Mainly,
though, and always, it is necessary to study
by reading everything possible, to try to
gauge suitability, and never, never to grow
downhearted.
It is only waste of. time submitting an
ordinary “he-said” “shc-said” story over-
seas. As one prominent editor wrote me:
“Keep yourself to distinctive adventure stuff
which writers over this side can’t do. We
have thousands of writers here who can
do those conventional stories. If we want
to buy them we can get them at home and
we have no need to go to a foreigner for
them.” It is as applicable to others as it
was to me. Write distinctive stuff or stay
at home. And don’t run away with the fool
notion that Yank and English editors are
ignorant. They know that a man can’t
be killed by a cracking whip, that a boom-
erang doesn’t turn corkscrews and return at
a whistle, that newchum jackeroos don’t
ride outlaws at sight, that squatters’
daughters aren’t all beautiful, and that
50,000 sheep don’t run on 5000 acres. In
short, be original and sincere.

A Satchel of Books
Manuscripts, A Miscellany of Art and
Letters, is edited by H. Tatlock Miller and
published quarterly at the Book Sho'p, Gee-
long. The price of the latest (February)
issue is 2s. 6d. Its format compares favor-
ably with that of any art magazine now-
appearing in Australia or M. 8., and the list
of contributors includes such names as Myra
Morris, Beatrice Tyldesley, F. S. Burnell
and Ambrose Pratt. Mrs. Alleyne Zander,
whose exhibition has been in Melbourne and
now is in Sydney, has an article on “Modern
Art,” and there are some fine reproductions
of the work of Paul Nash, Hans Heysen,
Margaret Preston afid the late George Lam-
bert.
Kinri Carnival , by John C. Moore (Dent;
7s. 6d.). A collection of 15 “tales,” most of
which arc sketches of aspects of the writer’s
bi’ief life. “Alma Mater” is a vivid, amus-
ing and, in places, touching description _of
his school days, school friends and boyish
ambitions. “Young Fishermen” deals with
the catching of a pike by Colin, who figures
in “Alma Mater,” and “An Essay on Poets”
is also about English public-school boys. Mr.
Moore is one of the hundreds of clever young
Englishmen who are writing with charm
and distinction of style about nothing in
particular—a Beverley Nichols without the
bitterness.
The Lone; Journey, by Barbara Blackburn
(Cassell: 7s. 6d.), is a good, almost great,
love-story. Elinor, the heroine, is alive,
human and understandable in all her mani-
festations —as a gauche, lonely girl in the
country, as a shy virgin in London, as mis-
tress and as wife. She moves in a Blooms-
bury circle of writers and their friends —
undistinguished but intelligent people—who
arC interesting in themselves, and there are
some knowledgable chapters on the 1926
strike, but no parts of the book are so
interesting as those which show bow this
repressed and inexperienced young woman
fought for a measure of happiness and got
it. Elinor’s creator is a realist who won’t
say that she will keep her happiness; only
that she has a sporting chance.
And a Little Verse
A CITIZEN.
Honored am I whate’er befall,
And shall be till I die,
For of a city fair and tall
A citizen am I.
Who wanders through its radiant streets
Knows joy beyond all bounds;
Sojourning there alone he meets
Sweet silences and sounds.
Feet fetterless and elbows free
As, stayed by naught, he goes,
The fellowship and company
Of gracious trees he knows.
Since beauteous is that city, then,
Through crowded ways and days,
Honored am I, as citizen
Of it, to sing its praise.

SOLEING AND HEELING THE
CONSTITUTION.
Two cases lately before the Courts illus-
trate over again how badly our Federal
Constitution is in need of overhaul. It is
not at all surprising that it should be in that
need. In some respects the Constitution
was merely experimental. Thus no other
had ever, so far as the records show, given
the Federal authority power to arbitrate in
industrial disputes extending beyond the
limits of one State. Indeed all industrial
arbitration by public tribunals is experi-
mental; and hardly another country has
been tempted by our pioneering experience
to adopt it. But the business was quite
new in the ’nineties when the Constitution
was drafted; delegates were aware of the
evil of strikes but had little or no experi-
ence of the disabilities produced by what
can pass for arbitration. Had the Conven-
tion known as much about “disputes” as we
know to-dav—how they can be manufac-
tured for the express purpose of getting the
parties before the Courts—and had it
known of the confusion that would be
caused by the simultaneous operation of
Federal and State Courts, nothing is more
certain than that the Arbitration clause
would never have been inserted. And the
Constitution was less even than . experi-
mental in some of its details. It was in
some of them a compromise which satisfied
hardly anybody.
To do them justice the builders of the
Constitution never pretended that it was
the last word on the subject. It is quite
true that amendment was not made easy.
Besides winning the approval of an abso-
lute majority of each House of the Parlia-
ment, or (in the event of a disagreement
between the two Houses) of one House a
second time after an interval of three
months, a proposed alteration must be
approved by a majority of the electors
voting in each of a majority of the States
and also by a majority of all the electors
voting. In practice it has been found diffi-
cult to win these majorities. Yet the Con-
vention dared not make amendment easier.
We have to remember that this draft Con-
stitution had to go before the people of
each colony; and there was no hope for
an instrument which might be easily and
completely changed next month or next
year.
Yet it ought not to be difficult to get
alterations made. The usual explanation
offered hitherto for refusal to sanction
amendment has been that the people did
not fully understand what they were asked
to do, and therefore sought safety by voting
No and thus leaving things unchanged.
Now, that would be quite a good attitude
to take if the Constitution had not in any
respect been experimental, if it had not
been in certain details a compromise with
which nobody was very well satisfied and
if, above all, the results had been perfectly
satisfactory. But the results have been so
far from satisfactory that one State has on
a popular vote approved of secession by a
two to one majority and at least two other
States are looking in the same direction;
moreover, decisions of the Courts are again
and again showing that many of the powers
of the Federation are ill-defined, while in
other cases the division of powers between
Federation and States is in great need of
readjustment.
Of the two cases to which reference was
made at the outset of these remarks, one
came before the High Court and the other
before the Queensland Justice Douglas.
In the latter case a matter of income tax
was involved. The Constitution lays it
down that “trade, commerce and inter-
course among the States shall be abso-
lutely free.” There are no qualifications; no
wider or stronger terms could be used.
On this Quick and Garran say“ Absolute
freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse
may be defined as the right to introduce
goods, wares and merchandise from one
State into another, the right to sell the
same, and the right to travel unburdened
by State restrictions, regulations or obstruc-
tions.” Yet income tax may be levied by
a State, and it has been so levied that the
profit on goods manufactured in, say,
N. S. Wales and sold in Queensland may be
taxed twice, whereas the profit on goods
manufactured and sold in Queensland would
be taxed only once, apart, of course, from
the Federal impost. Justice Douglas gives
some relief to the inter-State trader; but lus
Honor’s finding does not bind anybody out-
side Queensland and leaves the position of
the inter-State trader even there still lately
undefined. In the other case the High
Court decided that a State peanut market-
ing' board could not prevent a grower in
one State from shipping to another State,
though, as the dissenting Justice Evatt
pointed out, the difficulty in defining what
the section dealing with the freedom ot
inter-State trade actually means is greatly
increased by the conflicting judgments of
the High Court itself. Such conflicting
judgments mean in effect that the High
Court is legislating for us; and, however
much else we may be prepared to concede
to the Court, we cannot give it that privi-
lege.
And this brings us back to the alteration
of the Constitution and the main reason
why hitherto almost every proposed amend-
ment has been rejected. The national psy-
chology has been wrong. So far from
there being safety iii the assumption that
things are best left alone, there is very
grave danger in it. The fact that there is
serious talk of secession should awaken every
good Australian to that danger; and every
good democrat should be aroused to it by
the other fact that sections of the Con-
stitution are so obscure that Judges who
have never been chosen by the people for
the job have, in effect, to legislate upon
these matters. It may be that the best
plan will be to hold a Convention to con-
sider what provisions should be amended,
so that a large body of proposals may be
judged together. Apparently there is no
reason why a number of them should not
be incorporated in the one bill, and sub-
mitted to the people for their single yes
or no; it is not the alteration which has
to be submitted but the “proposed law for
the alteration.” But whatever is done in
this matter —whether one proposed altera-
tion or many are submitted —it is highly
desirable that the people should entirely
reconsider their old attitude of obstruction
when referendum time comes round.
DEBTORS AND CREDITORS.
Uncle Sam’s financial affairs are in a state 1
of utter confusion; and Uncle Sam seems
to be in the same state himself. For some
months past it has been evident that strong
pressure was being put on the Government
to introduce a measure of inflation, and at
last bills began to show up in the Senate.
The Administration, however, had these
sidetracked in favor of one of its own,
carrying on the policy which it had begun
when it “went off” gold. It is explained that
the steps taken and proposed are for the
good of the world; but Senator Thomas, the
sponsor of the bill, probably told why they
were taken or proposed when he declared
that the latest bill would transfet from
one class to another class in the United
States value to the extent of almost
200 thousand million dollars. That is to
say, the debtor class, “particularly farmers,”
would benefit to that extent at the expense
of the creditor class.
And there you have the complete bone
of contention. Can you honestly so manipu-
late the currency that one class, the debtors,
get an enormous advantage at the expense
of the creditors? The question seeps to
have only one possible answer until one
asks whether the creditors will be any
worse off after they have suffered the great
cut than they were when they became
creditors. If a man borrowed 10 yards of
tweed from another, and if somebody then
got hold of the tape-measure and added 50
per cent, to its length, we should certainly
have a great deal of sympathy with the
borrower when he protested against having
to hand back 10 yards according to the new
measure; and in practice there is no dif-
ference between the case of this borrower
and that of the farmer-mortgagor—or of
any other borrower, for that matter.
To make a yardstick that will neither
greatly shrink nor greatly expand is the
outstanding economic problem of the age.
It is the problem of the price level, whose
fluctuations are directly responsible for more
of our troubles than all other causes put
together. Variations in the prices of indi-
vidual commodities there must be ; markets
will be affected by famine and plenty, by
new discoveries and developments, by a
hundred factors. But there must be some-
thing operating outside the supply and
demand of the goods themselves to produce
such great undulations in the general price
level as history shows. Assume that a
given quantity of all commodities handled
in Melbourne —metals and coal, jute,
leather, wool, agricultural and dairy
produce, groceries, meat, building materials,
chemicals, everything—cost £lOOO in 1911.
The same quantity of the same goods
would have cost only £B9O in 1904; in
1920 they would have cost no less than
£2480. Since then there has been a gradual
fall, at first comparatively slow and uneven;
lately faster and more regular: in 1929 the
cost would have been £1803; at the end of
last year it was down to £1367. The creditor
who in 1920 lent another person £lOOO
would, if he were paid back that amount
to-day, be able tq purchase with it as much
as £lB9 would have purchased in 1920; if
he lent £lOOO in. say, 1927, he would to-
day, if repaid £lOOO, be able to buy with it
as much as £133 would have bought when
the loan was made. There are reasons why
prices, of some commodities should first
have risen and then fallen; there is no
reason in the variations in supply and
demand of these goods themselves why
there should have been such a prodigious
movement over the whole field of com-
modities. There seems to be only one
possible explanation: there is something
the matter with the yardstick.
The practi cal question, of course, is what
can we do about it; and that is the hard
nut over which Prime Minister MacDonald
and President Roosevelt have had a pre-
liminary talk and which will try the teeth
of the international conference in June.
Two general courses will be open to. that
conference: one to find ways of escape
from our present troubles without much
regard for the future, the other to examine
our monetary standard and secure some-
thing more stable for the future, though in
the latter case it may still be necessary to
do other things in order to hasten world
prosperity. But it is doubtful whether
that condition can be achieved without
normality and confidence in the future;
and that demands something more than an
economic conference —it demands, for one
thing, an entire review of the Versailles
Treaty.
THE PEOPLE ARE THE DEVIL!
The Bulletin has no great love for the
Leg. Council which will be brought into
being in N. S. Wales if the referendum is
carried on May 13. The first members are
to be chosen by the present two Houses
sitting together, 15 of them for 12 years,
15 for nine, 15 for six and 15 for three years.
It is a pretty terrible thing that Donald
Grant and the 50 or so other gentlemen
whom Mr. Lang sent to the Council for the
pux-pose of destroying it should have the
right to elect members of a legislative body
to serve for the next 12 years. But what
is the alternative? If we do not accept this
proposal, if we vote No on the referendum,
then we shall leave matters as they are,
with these 50-odd gentlemen entitled to
remain in the Leg. Council not for 12 years
but for life; and we shall leave it open for
any Premier, if this 50-odd are not enough
to complete the wrecking, to add 50 more.
Equally we shall leave' it open to another
type of Premier to swamp the Council for
the purpose of introducing, say, Fascism.
To accept this scheme, to vote Yes, is
distinctly the lesser of two evils.
And, anyhow, the acceptance of this bill
does not bang the door and bolt it. If the
new Chamber is not satisfactory, the people
can change it. The Leg. Assembly will
represent the people, so far as any elected
body can do so; and it will be for it to
take the first step. If it disapproves of the
behavior of the Council, it can pass a bill
for the further reform or even the abolition
of that Chamber. The Council might and
probably would refuse to pass such a bill.
Then, if the Assembly was still of the same
opinion, it would pass the bill again. And
if again the Council refused or failed to
pass the measure, and if further efforts to
secure agreement failed, then the bill “shall,
at any time during the life of the Parlia-
ment or at the next general election bo
submitted by way of referendum to the.
electors qualified to vote for members oi
the Assembly.” The process is quite simple
and straightforward; within six months of
the Assembly deciding that the Council
should be reformed or abolished, a referen-
dum could be held and the business com-
pleted. It is exactly the same with all
other measures, except bills dealing with the
appropriation of revenue; wherever there
is disagreement between the two Houses
the matter can be settled by reference to
the people. We hear a lot these days about
“mandates from the people.” We may sus-
pect that for most of these things the
people did not give the Government a
specific mandate at all. Hitherto there has
been no way of testing it; and Govern-
ments have bluffed things through. This
bill, if accepted, will provide a means of
calling a Government’s bluff.
But why, then, do Mr. Lang and his
cohorts fight this bill? The reason is
obvious. Because they do not want the
people to be consulted about legislation.
Absolute proof of this was given during
Lang’s last term of office. He passed a bill
through both Houses to abolish the Leg.
Council. When it came up for assent, he
was told the law required the approval of
the people on a referendum. Instead of
welcoming the chance to consult the people,
as an honest democrat would, he appealed
to the Full Court. The Full Court said Yes,
that was the law. But he did not even then
go to the people and ask for their approval.
He went instead to the High Court. The
High Court said'Yes, that was the law. But
still he did not go to the people. He was
prepared, this great democrat, to go any-
where and to anyone rather than to the
people. He went to the Privy Council.
The Privy Council said Yes, that was
the law—you must go to the- people. And
now he is fighting this bill which provides
for the settlement of this and every other
dispute by an appeal to the people. In the
eyes of the great democrat of Auburn and
Ebenezer, the people are the devil, to be
avoided at all costs.
HOTELS. ASHORE AND AFLOAT.
Cheap cruises, in big steamers with all the
modern improvements, to interesting places
within easy distance of the great cities, Inn e
recently been offered to Australians for the
first time, though they have been available to
Britons for many years. They caught on
immediately, and the innovation has un-
doubtedly come to stay. It began with a
jaunt to Norfolk Island in the Strathaird,
one of the P. and O.’s magnificent 22,500-
tonners, and developed so rapidly that last
month four steamers were carrying trippers
to New’ Caledonia (one was booked to set
outffrom Sydney again on April 26 for the
New Hebrides); three are to leave in June
for Papua and thereabouts; others are to
visit those parts in August—in short, there
are to be cheap cruises for every season ot
the year. Overseas concerns introduced
them, but an Australian company joined
in, and long-unemployed officers, seamen
and stewards welcomed the work.
These cruises are giving pleasure to thou-
sands of busy people whom circumstances
have hitherto debarred from enjoying a
delightful form of travel in comfortable
surroundings. Another result which may
bo counted on is the broadening of minds
which are too apt to be insular, if not provin-
cial. But the new craze has put more 1
creases on the foreheads of the large class
of Australians engaged in catering for tour-
ists, hotelkeepers especially. Even Tas-
manians are beginning to wonder whether
the removal of the embargo on overseas
steamers carrying passengers from Sydney
and Melbourne to the Speck was such a
good thing, after all, since it led so soon to
their going into the cruising business. Cer-
tainly the Strathaird called in at Hobart
recently, packed from stem to stern with
trippers from Sydney and Melbourne, but
it carried them for prices which made the
Hobart hotelkeepers shiver. From Sydney
to Hobart and return via Melbourne six
days altogether, fares were 11 and 12
guineas in the first saloon, 7 and 8 guineas
in the tourist class; from Melbourne to
Hobart, returning via Sydney, eight days,
they were 13 and 14 guineas in the first
saloon, 7 and 9 guineas in the tourist class.
First-class return from Sydney to Hobart
in the subsidised Zealandia, 7000 tons, is
£8 10s. for a bit over three days and a half;
and this is a “reduced” rate. Fair average
hotel accommodation in Hobart costs 14s.
a day.
The Australian publican has had a gruel-
ling time during the slump. In many cases
he took a lease of his place for a long term
before the bottom fell out of the boom;
in all cases, owing to the increases in cus-
toms and excise duties, he has had to pay
a great deal more for his liquor while see-
ing his sales grow less and less. Naturally
those who conduct high-class establishments
depending mainly on visitors object to
losing customers to new competitors. They
look upon the pleasure craft as floating-
hotels with everything in their favor—no
ingoing, rent or annual license fees to pay,
no six-o’clock or Sunday closing law to
observe, no danger of being prosecuted fot
any of the multitude of breaches catalogued
in the Licensing Acts, and, in the case of
British ships, no arguing the point with
trade-unions, wages boards or arbitration
courts. They complain with bitterness that,
since the advent of the cruising steamers,
in which people may drink all day and
every day if they can cany it, and are safe
from the police if they can’t, irrational and
vexatious restrictions on shore hotels have
been more harshly applied than ever. A
private dinner was given in a private room
of the best-known of all Hobart hotels
by the directors of the Derwent Valley
Paper Pulp Co., who were boarders. They
entertained as guests seven or eight local
residents, presumed to be interested in their
enterprise, among them Attorney-General
Baker. About 11 o’clock, when the speeches
were over and the company was breaking
up, police descended on the premises ana
took the names of the Attorney-General
and Thomas Murdoch, M.L.C. The up-
shot was that both were charged at the
City Police Court with “having been on
licensed premises during prohibited hours.
Murdoch pleaded not guilty, and was
acquitted on the score of lack of identifica-
tion; but the man who administers this
idiotic law acknowledged a technical
breach, was convicted and ordered to pay
the costs; “in default, distress. The
licensee, who was charged with “having
failed to prevent Henry S. Baker and
Thomas Murdoch remaining on licensed
premises during prohibited hours, ’ was fined
£2, plus costs.
Great and successful efforts have been
made, especially in Victoria, to improve
the standard of Australian hotels. The
good work will be undone if, by the com-
bination of bad times and stupid enforce-
ment of out-of-date laws, reputable hotel-
keepers are driven out of business or are
obliged to depend on their bars alone. Ihe
incipient tourist trade, which, ng-ht-ly
handled, has such bright prospects, will
assuredly go to the dogs ; tourists wi 1 not
come to a country which has wiped out the
best of its hotels. Six-o’clock closing has
served its war-time purpose; it is an absu
ditv in time of peace, especially m summei,
when six o’clock is only afternoon. Eight
o’clock closing should be Permitted to
hotelkeepers who accommodate boaiden
and tourists, and held out as an induce-
ment to those who run beershops t<i -
prove the appearance and standing of then
premises.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
What Does Hitlerism Mean?
.-Never "'as. there more need for vigilance to
maintain political liberty and constitutional freedom
from Hitlerism.”— Mr. IF. F. Sheahan, barrister-at-
law, speaking against the Reform Bill at Petersham
(-V. .S'. I V. ),
Whatever the objections may be to Ger-
many’s new Government there is certainly
nothing unconstitutional about it. On
January 30 last President Hindenburg
directed the leaders of the parties of
national concentration (or as we might say
the anti-socialisation parties) to form a
new Government. At the time the coun-
try was being governed by emergency
decrees. Hitler could have gone on gov-
erning by decrees. Instead, he decided to
appeal to the people. The Berlin corres-
pondent of the London “New Statesman
and Nation”—a political opponent of Hitler
—had this to say about the result
(11/3/’33):
_ Th e rise in the Nazi vote from 11,737,015 last
November to 17,209,529 this week is indeed astound-
ing’, even in view of the record percentage—B9—of
electors who went to the polls. Hitler claims to
have awakened the “sleeping hosts” of those who
have not hitherto bothered to vote, and undoubtedly
the new four million since November voted for him
almost to a man.
Ihe issue of the elections was simply
Leninism—a policy remarkably like that of
Mr. Lang in its general features- —versus
national reconstruction. The final counts
nationalist groups with a majority
of 52 per cent, of all the votes recorded,
and the Lenin groups with about 30 per
cent. The Centrists (R.C.’s) and the
splinter” parties are anti-Soviet, and can
be relied on, broadly, to give the Govern-
ment the two-thirds majority which is
required under the Constitution to enable
it to implement its policy. The policy
boils down virtually to making the Father-
land safe from Bolshevisation. In practi-
cally all his speeches Hitler claimed that in
Germany the Jews were behind every
internationalist movement, and would have
to be got rid of. Einstein himself, the
brightest gem in Germany’s intellectual
crown, is a proselytising internationalist.
It is hard for a British community like
Australia, whose Jews have always been
amongst its best and most patriotic citizens,
to realise that many Jews in other coun-
tries are different. Frederick F. Ball, of
New York, contributed an article on the
subject to the “S. M. Herald” (24/4/’33)
I have watched them land, hordes of Russian
Jews, half-starved, furtive, hollow-chested, dirty.
Many of them just make a new ghetto in our eastern
cities, but the old psychology of craft, merciless
business methods and callous effrontery remain.
He told a story of two immigrant Jews.
One became “a splendid citizen.” The
other “got no further than a sort of half-
Polish ghetto in New York City”:—
He might well have been one of the 1 bulwarks
of constituted law and order in the land to-day—
if not in the world. As it is—he is Trotsky.
Modern Germany can’t afford to enter-
tain Trotskys unawares. It has just gone
through “fourteen years of abominable
Marxism” and its citizens are desperate.
Rightly or wrongly they believe that-
Jewish internationalists and socialisers are
largely to blame for their miseries, and
their Red menace is immeasurably greater
than that of any other white country. To
quote the correspondent of the “New
Statesman” again:—
Although the Nazi vote in Greater Berlin is up
from 720,613 to 1,031,045, the capital is still Red,
for the. Socialists and Communists polled 1,376,705
together.
When Lenin and Trotsky decided to wipe
Czarism out of Russia they adopted the
logical, if revolting, policy of exterminating
every Czarist they could lay their hands
on. They recognised that the old regime
had fallen just because it had overlooked
too many people like themselves. The
Germans say of their Jews, as Mr. Bail
does of the Jews of the U.S.A., that many
of them are anti-social and anti-national.
So we have the, to us, appalling and inex-
plicable spectacle of Jews of all kinds being
exiled lest the worst fate of all befall Ger-
many—namely, the fate which has befallen
Russia.. But this isn’t Hitlerism; for good
or ill it is Germanism. Hitler is not an
irresponsible tyrant; he is the instrument
which the German democracy has deliber-
ately chosen to do a job which he pledged
himself to do if he was returned to power
—♦
“The Government-by-regulation Trick.”
From Hugh Main, N.S.W. Minister for
Agriculture:—
With reference to the article published in
The Bulletin regarding the standards
gazetted for butter and margarine, several
of the statements made are incorrect.
When the Dairy Industry (Amendment)
Bill was before the House I stated that
“there is no intention to prevent the legiti-
mate manufacture of margarine. The busi-
ness of manufacturing margarine for the use
of pastrycooks can still be carried on as it
has been carried on for the last 30 or 40
years.” I also replied to Mr. T. J. Shannon,
M.L.A., as follows: “Margarine that is not
manufactured as a substitute for butter will
be allowed to be made.”
When the bill was before the House on
the second reading, I pointed out that cer-
tain margarine-manufacturing firms were
catering for the pastry trade and that these
would not be interfered with, and that there
were other firms, and I mentioned the names
of them, who were producing an article
which would lead one to suppose that it was
butter, and I indicated quite definitely that
it was proposed to prevent persons from
selling as well as manufacturing it: During
the last 12 months a definite effort was
made by certain individuals to make from
vegetable oils and fats which are introduced
from overseas a substance which closely re-
sembles butter in appearance, color and
flavor. This product is lacking in vitamin
content, which Australian butter is specially
renowned for, and the consuming public are
not receiving the same value when they pur-
chase margarine. The manufacturers have
definitely set themselves out to produce an
article which can replace butter, and are
able to carry out their plans because their
product is produced by cheap colored labor
in the form of imported vegetable oils and
fats.
No one has any objection to the manu-
facture of. a margarine for pastry purposes,
which is its legitimate use, but when it is
realised that a large number of our popula-
tion are directly and indirectly dependent on
the dairying industry, and that many of
our wheatgrowcrs have been forced, through
low prices, to change over to dairying, wholly
or in part, the great importance of preserv-
ing the local market for butter-producers is
evident to anyone who will consider the
matter from a national standpoint. The
Government has shown its interest in the
dairying industry by making large sums
available to enable dairy-farmers to extend
their herds and to increase production. This
has become imperative in order to absorb
a number of our unemployed, particularly
lads who, on leaving school, found no open-
ing in other directions, and yet we find
persons advocating that three small factories,
employing possibly from 150 t 0 200 people;
should be permitted to continue operations
to the detriment of our butter-producers.
Those factories, nine in all, which utilise
beef fat for the manufacture of margarine
for pastry purposes can still continue under
the standards which have been laid down;
but unless the factories utilising vegetable
oils comply with these standards the Gov-
ernment will take all necessary steps to
ensure that the law is observed.
And a few words in reply:—
Let’s cut out all the political poppycock
about protecting the butter industry, and
try to bring this gentleman back to the point.
The Bulletin's charge against Mr. Main
had nothing to do with the regulation el-
even the prohibition of margarine manu-
facture ; The Bulletin wouldn’t have the
smallest objection even to its prohibition.
Tiie Bulletin’s charge was headed “The
Government-by-regulation Trick.” and that is
what it was all about. In the Assembly
on Dec. 1, on the second reading of the Dairy
Industry (Amendment) Bill, this happened
(“Hansard,” p. 2549)
Mr. Shannon: “Is it intended to prohibit mar-
garine?’’
Mr. Main: “No. Margarine will have exactly the
same rights and privileges as it has had since the
1915 Act was passed. There are two forms of
margarine. One is manufactured from animal fat.
The. other is prepared from vegetable oils. Cocoanut
oil is extracted from copra imported from the islands
and made up into a form of fat.”
An Hon. Member: “Are you objecting to that?”
Mr. Main: “No. It will have just as much right
to be sold when the bill becomes law as ever it
had. There is no intention to depart from the
present law except that we are not going to allow
butter to be mixed with margarine.”
That was on Dec. 1; and on Mr. Main’s
representations the bill was passed. But on
March 14 this regulation was gazetted:—
Margarine shall not contain palm oil; and where
made from cocoanut oil, either alone or in combina-
tion with other vegetable or animal oils, shall
retain a readily appreciable flavor of cocoanut oil.
If Parliament passed a measure to that
effect, well and good; certainly The Bulle-
tin would not object to it. What it does
object to is that a Minister should get a
measure passed by representing that, as to
margarine, “there is no intention to depart
from the present law, except that we are
not going to allow butter to be mixed with
-margarine,” and, having got it passed, that
he should have a regulation gazetted which
absolutely violates his undertaking. This is
government by regulation, not by Parlia-
ment ; and the sooner Mr. Main’s colleagues
in the Ministry tell him that that sort of
thing must be left to their friends on the
other side the better for the reputation of
this Government.

Why Have General Elections?
Dear Bulletin— One of the many defects
of our accepted system of democracy is
the general election. Before an election,
Parliament is busy window-dressing; at the
election, each party makes promises which
there is no intention even of trying to carry
out; and after the election comes a happy
period of a year or more when cur repre-
sentatives, free from the fear of defeat at
the polls (for the memory of the electorate
is notoriously short), may give their entire
. attention to looking after their personal
interests.
Why not, therefore, do away with the
general election altogether? If, instead, the
various electorates throughout the Com-
monwealth held by-elections in rotation at
intervals of about a fortnight, the evils
attendant on a general election would be
largely avoided. Parliament would be
always to some extent before the country,
and would have to accustom itself to getting
on with its business under such conditions.
Foolish or unpopular legislation would
result in an immediate reduction of the
majority of the Government party, while
unwarranted obstruction on the part of
the Opposition would merely serve to
strengthen the Government’s majority. It
may be claimed that it is not a good
thing for a country to have “popular” legis-
lation; but does a country deserve better
legislation than it desires? And in any case,
is it a good thing for a country to have
legislation of the sort that this country
often gets under the present system?
If we review the history of the last few
years in Australia we find numerous
instances where such a system would have
minimised the niesses into which our Gov-
ernments have landed Us. The Bruce-Pages
would have looked to their policy of
bor row and bust a little more carefully if
a dwindling of their majority had warned
them that public confidence was waning;
Lang would have been much less confident
if there had been a fortnightly message
of disapproval from the ballot-box; and
Lyons and Argyle would at this moment be
given seriously to think.
The matter of cost is a powerful argu-
ment against the referendum; but the sug-
gested system, while having many of the
virtues of the referendum, would probably
be less expensive than the present system
of general elections. A small itinerant per-
manent staff could carry out the clerical
work of the by-elections with greater effici-
ency than is possible with the temporary
assistance available at general elections, and
the huge expenditure on “intensive cam-
paigning” would be greatly reduced.
Some safeguard, however, would be
necessary to prevent the formation of bands
of itinerant voters, and also of itinerant
candidates I —Yours, H. G. F.

The Polish Corridor.
“Tacitus”: Dr. Michael Kelly, of Westralia,
gives (B. 12/4/’33) such a spirited and belli-
cose exposition of the Polish claims to the
Corridor and other provinces now in
Poland’s posesssion that Bulletin readers
may like to know also the German point
of view regarding these disputed territories.
It would lead too far even to trace the
histoiy of this province of Pomorze, as
the Poles now prefer to call it; sufficient
to state that the original inhabitants were
a tribe of Slavs—not Poles —and that up
to the end of the eighteenth century Pom-
erania and West Prussia, apart from their
own dukes, had many overlords—Teutonic
knights, Poles, Swedes, Germans—until
finally they became an integral part of
Prussia. Under Prussian rule the country
prospered, and in 1914 the population was
nearly 70 p.c. German.
After the Great War the Allied Powers
recast the map of Europe, and to justify
the breaking up of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire and the redrawing of the eastern
frontiers of Germany the phrase “self-de-
termination of nations” was invented—every
little nation was to have its place in the
sun. Poland was resurrected; but, as
France wished to have a strong Power on
the eastern frontier of Germany, the
Polish frontiers were not drawn to contain
a purely Polish population, but countries
inhabited mostly by Germans, Ukrainians,
Little Russians, etc., were included. Not
satisfied even with this, the Poles took
Wilna, a Lithuanian country, in total disre-
gard of the League of Nations’ prohibition,
and are still in possession, in spite of
Lithuanian protests.
To give Poland a sea border, the Corri-
dor was created, thereby dividing Germany
and creating an open wound in its side.
The population being mostly German, no
“self-determining” plebiscite was taken;
the province was simply handed over to
Poland, with certain stipulations regarding
the German population, which stipulations,
by the way, the Poles have generally chosen
to disregard. Danzig, a former Hanseatic
and a pure German city, was created a Free
State under a High Commissioner, and
under direct protection of the League of
Nations. Special conditions and regula-
tions were laid down in the treaty to govern
the relations between Danzig and Poland,
and these are now the cause of constant
friction. Even as late as March 9 last the
High Commissioner, Dr. Rosting, had to
ask for intervention by the League against
a flagrant breach on the part of Poland.
In Upper Silesia a plebiscite was taken,
and by an overwhelming vote the people
decided to remain in the Reich. This did
not suit the Poles, so the Conference of
Ambassadors, presumably under French
pressure, allotted large districts of this rich
province to Poland, utterly disregarding the
plebiscite and the so-called “self-determina-
tion of nations.” Large provinces on which
the German people had to rely for their
food supply were thus arbitrarily severed
from the Reich and communications
broken between East Prussia and the rest
of Germany. The German Government
protested, but the Allies, flushed with vic-
tory. insisted, and forced the signatures to
the Treaty of Versailles.
The last decade has shown conclusively
that, the frontiers drawn in 1919 are unten-
able and require revision. The German
people desire to live at peace with the
world, and have proved it at Locarno by
agreeing to the permanency of the western
frontier. But they resent the injustice done
in fixing the present eastern frontiers of
the Reich, and eveiy German Government
since 1919. whether Socialist, Centre or
Nationalist, has resolutely refused to agree
to them. Fortunately the Treaty of Ver-
sailles provides for revision of frontiers
where necessary, and it is now up to the
diplomats of the four great Powers to find
an acceptable solution.

“Self-government” in New Guinea.
On May 9 the Mandated Territory of New
Guinea will be endowed with what the
Federal Government is pleased to term
“a measure of self-government.”
For some years after the Australian occu-
pation of the Territory control was in
military hands. Later it passed to a civil
Administration, appointed by and respon-
sible to Canberra only. The white inhabi-
tant outside the official pale had no say in
the conduct of affairs. With the increase
of the white population due to the gold
discoveries an agitation grew up for the
grant of a system of government wherein
these outlanders might share.
The reply of the Federal Government has
been the institution of what is known as
the Crown Colony system. The enabling
bill passed last year provides for the crea-
tion of an Executive Council and a Legis-
lative Council. The first consists of nine
members, eight of whom are to be Govern-
ment officials, and the other chosen by and
from the non-official members of the Legis-
lative Council. If this choice is not made,
the Federal Government may make the
appointment. Only the Administrator, who
is President of the Council, or his deputy
may submit questions to the Council for
decision or advice, and +he Council may
be summoned only under the authority of
the Administrator. The Administrator may
act in opposition to the advice or decision
of the Council, and is responsible for his
action only to the Federal authority.
The Legislative Council consists of the
Administrator—who is President—and the
official members of the Executive Council
plus seven non-official members appointed
by Canberra after nomination by the
Administrator. These members have a four-
years’ tenure of office, but may be removed
at any time by the Federal authority on
the Administrator’s advice. As in the Ex-
ecutive body, the Administrator presides
over the Leg. Council and has a. casting
vote in case of a tie. The Leg. Council
may not propose any measure in connection
with revenue or finance except with the
consent of the Administrator. All ordi-
nances passed must be approved by" the
Administrator and allowed or disallowed by
the Federal Government.
In short, the new system of “self-govern-
ment” is the old one of bureaucratic con-
trol with a lick of democratic varnish. The
official majority in both the Executive and
Legislative Councils and the overriding
powers of the Administrator ensure that
only the official policy shall prevail.
The Queensland Cancer “Cure.”
The committee appointed to watch the
progress of certain cancer patients whom
G. A. Roberts undertook to treat in Bris-
bane has unanimously reported that the
thing is a fraud and, in effect, that the man
Roberts is a rogue. Had the treatment
been only a failure there could be nothing
but regret. But there is a strong prirna
facie case that Cook or Roberts, as he has.
lately called himself, either knew that it was
valueless or did not take reasonable care to
satisfy himself that it was genuine; there is,
moreover, a stronger case still that he de-
liberately misled people into believing that
he was in a position to judge its worth. In
the prospectus of the co. formed in Brisbane
a year ago to exploit the “cure” it was
definitely stated that Roberts was for four
and a half years a student “at a leading
medical school in Adelaide.” Further,
the Brisbane “Daily Mail” printed what
purported to be an interview with the man
in which the claim was made that only
six hours separated him from his degree
in medicine. There is only one medical
school in Adelaide, and nobody answering
this description was at any time a student;
moreover, the committee finds that the man
knows practically nothing about cancer.
The Bulletin, having had what it be-
lieves to be the facts of Roberts’s career
laid before it, was strongly urged to call
upon the authorities to take action some
time ago, after the tests had been begun.
It believed, however, that, having been
undertaken, the inquiry should be con-
tinued, and that Roberts should be allowed
perfect freedom to make the tests a success
—if he could. Had they been in any way
interrupted, capital would certainly have
been made out of it. But the tests com-
pleted and the report presented to the
Government, action is demanded. It is
no offence to have failed to cure cancer.
That must be made perfectly clear. But
if it is not an offence to float a company
on such representations as this man made,
or allowed to be made, thereby giving many
most unfortunate people a false hope, and
possibly inducing some to delay that medi-
cal treatment which might have saved
them had there been no delay—if, we
say, it is not an offence to float a company
in such circumstances, then Queensland
criminal law is not the pattern which it has
been believed to be.
4
The New Cricket Rule.
Sitting in Melbourne the Australian Board
of Control resolved to add to the laws of
cricket in Australia one to the effect that a
ball which in the umpire’s opinion has been
“bowled at the batsman with intent to
intimidate or injure him” shall be a no-
ball, and if the offence is repeated (the
bowler having Been informed of the reason
of the no-ball) the offender shall be in-
structed to cease bowling and “such bowler
shall not again be permitted to bowl during
the innings then in progress.” This, of
course, is applicable only to play in Aus-
tralia; what the M.C.C. may do about it
remains to be seen.
That it should be deemed necessary to
make such a law is very greatly to be re-
gretted ; what the case calls for is an inquiry
into what has made it necessary. This rule
may do good; on the other hand it may
add to that ill-feeling which has so unfor-
tunately entered into the game. While the
causes are being investigated with a view
to their removal, all Test matches should
be dropped. Indeed, it would be advisable
to drop even the idea of sending a team
to England next year.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Uncle Sam is the latest to “go off gold,”
which means that his exporters will not be
quite so heavily handicapped as they have
been in foreign markets with depreciated
currencies. Lately when the Yankee dried-
fruit exporter, for instance, has sold 480
dollars’ worth of sultanas in England, all
he has really got has been about 350 dollars,
on account of the fall in' the gold value of
the f sterling. Now, however, he will get
nearly 400 dollars ; and there is joy in Cali-
fornia in consequence. But it means that
for the Australian sultana-grower competi-
tion will be keener. The rival milk-vendor
has watered down his milk and can sell
cheaper, too.
J. Bull reports a deficit of £32.000.000.
When the 1932 Budget was introduced the
Hoover moratorium was in force, and it
was anticipated that Uncle Sam would not
ask for the £29,000,000 due to him by Britain
that year; so no provision was made for it
in the Budget. But he held out his hands
for the £29,000,000, and now that both coun-
tries have gone off gold his bill will be
£51,000,000 this year—though it is hard to
see how it can be settled. “The deficit,”
says the grim Chamberlain, “will be met by
borrowing.” That is how Australian deficits
have always been met, though no Australian
Treasurer lias ever been known to admit it.
The British financial year closes on x\pril
5. Chamberlain presented his Budget on
April 25. If lie ever drifts into a self-pity-
ing mood, he must envy the way they do
these things in N. S. Wales. The Bavin-
shaws went to the country in 1930 without,
delivering a Budget—without even troubling
to get Parliamentary sanction for most of their
expenditure for the remainder of their term.
Lang, who arrived at the Treasury the first
week in November, didn’t bother either till
the middle of June —the last month of the
financial year. Then he hurled what he was
pleased to call a Budget at an uncompre-
hending House.
Clever women are not lacking in the Yic.
Labor movement, but they are never con-
sidered when there is a vacancy for a seat
that can be won. They are nominated at
long intervals, but only for Conservative
strongholds. Boroondara being one, Muriel
Heagney was graciously put up. She scored
little more than a fourth of the primary
vote, but probably no Trades Hall pet who
is reserving his energies for a soft snap
would have done better. Solicitor Trevor
Donald Oldham looks like succeeding Dick
Linton, now on his way to the London office.
One of the seven candidates was J. M.
Fowler, Perth’s M.H.R. for just on 22 years.
He bottomed the poll.
MONSIEUR: “Ah, my friends —you are very

They have refused the periodical request
that an open season be declared for ’pos-
sums and native bears. Previous Govern-
ments, Tabor and non-Labor, found the
granting of permission for the butchery of
Australia’s fast-vanishing native animals an
easy way of placating clamorous constitu-
ents. One result was that many thousands
of skins collected surreptitiously and hidden
before the lifting of the protection came on
the markets under cover of the open season.
Outback lawbreakers naturally took advant-
age of the situation, and continued their
activities when the permit was withdrawn,
confident that a complaisant authority would
sooner or later give them a chance to sell
the plunder without fear of penalty.
The war of the exchanges is more like
Dottyville than a sane world. One country
thinks to get ahead of its competitors in a
foreign market, and puts up its exchange
rate — i.e., waters down its currency; de-
clares, for instance, as Australia did, that
for the future 130 of its £s shall be worth
only 100 of some other country’s £s. This
means that when one of its exporters sends
away goods that sell for £lOO in another
country, he will get £l3O at home. Then
some competitor sees that the producers
in the first country arc selling for less than
they could afford to do if they weren’t get-
ting this extra £3O in their own currency, so
it waters down its currency, too —or “goes
off gold,” as they call it. It is like an old-
time suburban “milk war” in which rival
milkmen engaged in a watering-down com-
petition to enable them to undersell the other
fellow, until even a hungry cat would turn
the alleged low price down.
“The Government hopes to save £10,000 a year by
reducing the Upper House to 60 members. _ The
saving will come from a reduction in privileges,
such as gold passes.”

It was confidently expected by Queensland
Labor that most of the new electors in
Wynnum would vote for Donnelly at the
Assembly by-election, and no doubt they did.
But some of the old electors must have
weakened, for at the end of the second day’s
counting Donnelly’s general-election total,
3761, had increased only to 4004 —81 behind
Bayley, the Opposition man. Another 577
votes had gone to Argaet, of the “Queens-
land party,” and 164 to a Communist. It
was thought that Bayley would get _ most
of Argaet’s preferences; but there is no
certainty about preferences until they are
counted.
There is renewed talk of war between
Japan and Russia over the Chinese Eastern
Railway, but if the Mikado seizes the Soviet’s
link with Vladivostok Moscow will pro-
bably content itself with a verbal offensive.
It has little hope of staying the victorious
march of Nippon in Manchuria and North-
ern China. The Soviet imperialists have
their eyes on Southern China, where Com-
munism ha.s been embraced by 70 million
and is still spreading.
As sustenance payments haye dropped
£lO,OOO a week, it is suggested that the Vic.
unemployed-relief-tax may be reduced. Premier
Argyle is non-committal until he sees how
things pan out on June 30, and what chance
he has of getting any more loan money for
works. The more loan works the less sus-
tenance, and if the works don’t pay who
cares? While the relief tax was reduced 10
p.c. this financial year, a special income tax
varying from 6s. to 12s. 6d. per £lOO was
clapped on. The 6s. rate was applied to
incomes between £lOO and £2OO which had
escaped income tax.
Butler, now Premier of South Aus., drew
£3OO p.a. more than the ordinary member
as leader of the Opposition. Presumably his
Government is willing to continue the pay-
ment, but the difficulty will be to find the
leader. The Opposition is divided into six
A.L.P.’s, four P.L.P.’s, three Langsters,
three Independents and a single-taxer,
and the three Labor factions will have
no truck with one another. Lacey, some
time M.H.R. for Grey, and now one of
the A.L.P. members for Port Pirie, seems
to have the best chance of collecting the
£300; but it will be awkward if he starts
drawing it and is then repudiated by the
majority on his side of the House.
It is a poor heart that never rejoices.
The chairman of Queensland’s Wheat Board,
which refused an offer for the State wheat
crop that it was subsequently glad to
accept, and kept the farmers waiting months
for their money, claims that its obstinacy
has proved a godsend to the growers, since
the price of wheat has gone up at home and
abroad. Still, it might have gone down, and
in any case no tinpot board working under the
Commonwealth Constitution, which says that
“trade, commerce and intercourse among the
States shall be absolutely free,” has a right
to take possession of other men s wheat and
hold it, without their consent, for a rise.
It is asserted that the benefit to the farmers
from the increased price may amount to a
penny a bushel. How much a bushel they
had to pay on bank loans while they were
waiting for their wheat cheques is not men-
tioned.
The war of the exchanges has all sorts or
queer side-effects. To protect their own
market against the imports of countries with
watered-down currencies, various nations
have built up tariff walls which they
wouldn’t think of in other days; and when
Brown and Smith, who have been used to
trading with one another, lock themselves
up like that, there soon is trouble. At that
point nations begin dickering with one
another —you let in our fly-papers free and
we’ll let in your mousetraps free. The world
has reached that stage now. Britain lias
just made treaties with Denmark, Germany
and Argentina. The trouble is that, as soon
as the doors are banged as above-mentioned,
people start new industries to meet the
home demand; and when. the trade treaties
are made they see their new industries
squeezed out, and naturally there is a yelp.
That yelp is being heard now in England ;
it may even cause a political crisis.
Queensland’s Industrial Court has had to
deal with an application for deregistration
of the Liquor Trades Union. One Mitchell
was the applicant; lie said the union had
failed to admit him as a member when asked,
and lacking a ticket he had lost his job in
a brewery. The Court (T. A. Ferry and
W. J. Riordan) dismissed the case, stating
that it was not necessary for a worker to
have a union ticket if application for mem-
bership had been made. Touching the
alleged refusal of membership and loss ot
work, it maintained a stolid silence.
R. W. Gibbs goes to the helm of the Bank
of N.Z. at a time when it is just as well for
the bank that a Government nominee hasn t
to clutch it. On March 31 the Associated
Banks presented to Finance Minister Coates
a bill of staggering dimensions for compensa-
tion in respect of the recent exchange-boost-
ing achievement of the Government.
The High Court decision which cut the
ground from under the feet of the com-
modity-control boards which infest Queens-
land has set the Foregone Smiths thinking.
They won’t go to the Privy Council, but.
they hope to preserve a method of control
without infringing section 92 of the Com-
monwealth Constitution Act. This may take
the form of a permit or license system,
growers being free to market elsewhere, i 1
they wish, in voluntary co-operation. Volun-
tary pools are not affected by the High
Court judgment.
The A.W.U. gets heaps of abuse from
Langsters because it refuses to worship the
god of their idolatry, and from Communists
because it will not be dragged into their
crazy strikes ; but it keeps its end up. Drake
Brockman, J., reduced the wages of railway-
men on the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta line, to
11s. a day in some cases; and the militants
demanded a strike. The union replied that
it was for arbitration, and to arbitration it
must stick; but it would see if the reduc-
tions could stand. The High Court decided
that they could not, because the Act required
them to be made by at least two Federal
Arbitration Judges; in any case, they were
based on miscalculations. So the men are
to get the benefit of the old award. Had
they struck a lot of them would have got
the sack.
Vic. Minister Menzies has patched up a
partial settlement of the long-drawn-out
squabble between the Railway Commissioners
and the Harbor Trust as to who should
finance the overhead electrical equipment to
connect Port Melbourne station with the
station pier. Electrification of a quarter-
mile or so of line is to be completed at once,
and trains will run alongside steamers.
Menzies put it to the stiff-necked officials
that their dispute related to work that
had been done, as well as to the compara-
tively small part that needs doing, and they
were wasting time and temper. They could
renew their wrangle if they liked, but let
them finish the job first.
Australia still sends delegates to the
League of Nations Assembly, and even to
that useless debating society the Interna-
tional Labor Conference, though the annual
contribution and expenses are more than it
can afford. It will really have to stop send-
ing Assemblymen, if only to prevent them
getting into dangerous company and coming
back with the recommendation that we
should have a go at someone —the sooner
the better. The men of peace seem to be
mostly looking for lash over there. Benes,
the Czechs’ Minister of Foreign Affairs, is
the latest. Imitating, the Japanese, he. has
“defied the world to alter the frontiers” of
his li.ttle country“let those who desire
Czecho-Slovakia to yield territory come and
take it.” Czecho-Slovakia, like Japan, was
an original member of the League, and
Benes has hitherto been regard as one of
the leading pacifists in Europe.
Scullin, addressing the Sydney conference
of the Fed. Labor organisation, such as it is,
held forth with his accustomed eloquence on
“the need for constitutional reform” -
The methods of government must be simplified.
There can be no justification for 13 Houses of
Parliament, Seven Governors and the duplication of
departments. The Labor platform wisely- lays it
down that there should be one sovereign Parlia-
ment with delegated powers to State or Provincial
Councils. A referendum to amend the Constitution
would place constitutional reform on a higher and
broader plane.
Pity the gentleman didn’t go to Westralia.
when he was asked, and impress his views
on Labor supporters over there. His honeyed
tongue might have dissuaded some of them
from swelling the vote for secession, which
was staggering in some Labor strongholds ;
in South Fremantle, represented by McCal-
lum, now the second man in the Ministry,
there were 4000 ayes and 1800 noes. Lyons
said foolish things in Westralia —especially
when he dragged the King’s name into the
controversy and suggested what George \ .
would reply to the separationists —but lie
did put up a fight. Scullin, though he could
talk (as Swift could write) beautifully,about
a broomstick, never fights.
With his tongue in his cheek, Vic. Oppo-
sition-leader Tunnecliffe suggested the other
day that, instead of shifting the high school
for girls from Government House, St. Kilda-
road, where it has been temporarily located,
to a spare State school in West Melbourne,
a new building should be run up on part ot
Parliament House grounds, used as a public
garden. Education Minister Pennington re-
plied that, apart from the fact that £36,000
would be needed —an amount nowhere in
sight—no Government could touch the land,
which is under Parliament’s control. Tun-
necliffe knew that already. The incense
burned by Cain, his deputy, while Cain was
trying to win middle-class applause must
have gone to Tunny’s head.
“Butler, the new South Aus. Premier, says South
Aus. might vote as Westralia did; but he prefers

Government, if after the polling he is in a
position to support anything. The only Min-
ister to be opposed is Grobler, who sits for
Rustenburg in the Western Transvaal,
hitherto Dutch-Nat. to a man. His opponent
is Roos, so the contest should take on a
Tweedledum-Tweedledee aspect. The Union
has gained its first woman member, Mrs.
Reitz, wife of another Minister, having been
returned unopposed for Parklands, a Jo’burg
electorate.

“Schnorrer”: There actually is a settle-

colonists suggested by “000” (B. 19/4/’33).
After the pogroms in the Ukraine 30 years
ago Israel Zangvvill, despairing of the suc-
cess of the Zionist movement, broke away
and. founded the Jewish Colonisation Asso-
ciation ; a sympathetic British Government
provided territory in Uganda, where a Jew-
ish colony came into being, and several
settlements were made in Brazil and Argen-
tina. Zangwill approached Deakin, then
Commonwealth Prime Minister, for land in
the Northern Territory, but Deakin disliked
the idea of “racial settlements.” However, a
committee of Jews to help Zangwill had
been formed in Melbourne and the Victorian
Government took notice; the Jewish settle-
ment is near Shepparton and is noteworthy
for some fine orchards, although few of the
men who made them had any previous know-
ledge.
“Caballus” : Gordon hardly hit the white
when ho referred to Britomarte as a destrier
(B. 26/4/’33). The latter had vanished
from war long before the Stuart times; it
was a type bred for carrying the fully-
armored knight. It is probable that some
of our draught breeds are descended from
these heavy . horses, while the French Per-
cheron is said to be in all essentials a sur-
vivor of the weight-carriers that used to
waddle into battle with some thirty stone
of armored rider on their backs. The destrier
was rarely ridden save in battle—though
Scott has Marmion perched on a “red-roan
destrier” when he arrives at “Norham’s
castled steep.” Usually the knight rode a
well-paced jennet, a Spanish breed, or a
mule. The destrier was led by the squire on
the knight’s right hand—hence the name
( dextrarius).

“Felo” : Rarely in the history of England
has a High Court Judge committed suicide;
in the . long list of eminent persons to be
found in certain reference books who have
gone out by their own hand in Britain since
the beginning of last century there is no
mention of a legal luminary, though there
is one of a bishop. Now Justice McCardie
has gone and done it—a personage not less
esteemed for his law than for his humanness
and his humor. It is a queer reflection
that a man who had passed hundreds of sen-
tences for crime—he had been 16 years on
the Bench and though always a merciful
Judge he was none the less a firm one-
should himself depart by an act which, had
it failed of its intention, might have placed
himself in the dock.
“General Prac”: An authority on Materia

can hardly have consulted any intel-
ligent doctor about the drug employed,
Hyoscine is chancy stuff, and nobody can
predict the individual’s response to it. It
may produce sweet reasonableness and
placidity in one man, and in another a roar-
ins delirium, which ends not merely in n
refusal to answer questions but in a keen
desire to empty the premises out of the win-
dow. It’s no new thing, hyoscine. Dios-
borides, a Greek physician with Nero’s
armies, described the plant (related, by the
way, to the prosaic potato) which contains
the active alkaloid. It’s lethal, too, if over-
done. In 1910 a shambling little quack-
doctor in London named Crippen went to
the gallows for poisoning his wife with
hyoscine. Two-sevenths of a grain were
found in the remains, enough to kill a dozen
wives.

Ogpu official more
than another, it
is the sight of a
pack of cards. I
succeeded in
smuggling a pack
through the Cus-
toms at Lenin-
grad, and to re-
lieve the tedium
of the long rail-
way journey be-
tween Rostov and
Kiev four of us
risked a game of
bridge. We hadn’t
finished the first
rubber before an
Ogpu officer came
down on us, and
it was only the
intervention of
our interpreter,
who pleaded our
ign o r ance of
Soviet law, that
prevented what
looked like being
serious conse-
quences. It would
be a very fool-
hardy Tovarish
who would play cards on the steps of the
Supreme Court in Moscow.

“Marsh” : Touching these stock jokes for
new hands (B. 12/4/’33), the newly-joined
junior clerk at a wool-broking concern used
to be regularly dispatched to a neighboring
establishment for “the wool-saw.” The
youth rarely inquired the nature of the im-
plement and was apt to return with a parcel
weighing anything up to half a hundred-
weight. There was always keen anticipation
as to what the other chaps had put together;
the consignment generally comprised any-
thing from steel bands used in dumping bales
to old boots, with a piece of evil-smelling
hide thrown in as a flavoring. If any lad
inquired for what the tool was needed,
he was told that it was for sawing a bale
of wool in halves.
“Claverton”: A. G.
Stephens had one curi-
ous piece of luck, re-
lated in his “Queens-
lander’s Travel Notes.”
A young man visiting
London, he got an
order for a seat in the
Strangers’ Gallery of
the Commons, and
happened to find him-
self there on the mem-
orable night in 1893
when the ill-feeling
stirred up over Glad-
stone’s second Home
Rule Bill boiled
over, after a bitter
speech by Chamber-
lain, in a fracas on
the floor of the House.
Thus he was spectator
of a scene the like of
which has never been
witnessed in the
Mother of Parlia-
ments before or since.
Stephens recorded
that the distinguished
strangers were as
deeply pained at the
outbreak as the Prime
Minister himself, and
showed their feelings
by groans and hisses,
“but we in the undis-
tinguished gallery rose
and cheered ’em on.”
Furthermore, he inti-
mated that he would
never again be thrilled
by platitudes about the dignity of Parlia-
ment.
“Selma”: An ancient accusation, was re-
vorsed the other day, when a schoolgirl visi-
tor selected a. volume of Swinburne from our
bookcase and dipped into it. Noticing later
that she had discarded the poet for an
Edgar Wallace I inquired her opinion of
Swinburnian verse. “I don’t think I’d care
for him,” she said; “he seems to be a
weak imitation of Adam Lindsay Gordon !”
H: * s|: ' *
“Spasebo”: The Soviet propaganda film
“Turk-Sib,” which failed to impress the
Melbourne Office Flapper, turned out to be
equally abhorrent to local sympathisers with
the Russian proletariat. At a private screen-
ing in Melbourne trade-union leaders were
vocal in their disappointment. One remarked
that a Footscrav factory inspection had been
known to be more exciting, A leading
Red belonging to the intellectual wing of
the Movement declared that the musical
accompaniment was as disappointing as the
film. It was by that well-known proletarian
composer Ludwigovich Beethovenski.

“Oxmead”: Fifty years ago, more and
less, I was at school with two half-brothers,
Austen and Neville Chamberlain. There were
six years between them and their terms
didn’t overlap; and as neither enjoyed any
FULL OF CHARITY.
“When you’re drinking at the public-house, do you ever think
of the money I want for housekeeping?”
“Yesh, dear; but I (hic) forgive yer.”
distinction at games they remain very
shadowy figures in my memory. Yet each
was to fill a place in public life little inferior
to their father’s, although neither began (like
Joseph) as an advanced Radical. I have
often wondered if it helps or hinders a man
in politics to have had a famous father. Pos-
sibly it ensures him a good start, but after
that he must rely on his own efforts, and
comparisons are certain to be drawn to his
disadvantage. The Chamberlains got their
start and made good ; so did Winston Church-
ill. But W. H. Gladstone, though probably
a man of good average abilities, was never
a real political success; perhaps he couldn’t
live up to the standard which other people
set for him simply because he was the
G.O.M.’s son.

“D. J.H.” : When thieves tried the safe in
the Council chambers at Ingleburn (N.S.W.)
they bumped the ’phone, which caused the
shutter to ring at the exchange. The P.M.,
surprised at being rung up in the small
hours—it being a daytime exchange—thought
a rat must have banged into the instru-
ment, and hopping out of bed rang the muni-
cipal number energetically. This alarmed
the intruders, and they decamped with speed,
their job undone. A couple of weeks later
they made no mistake, and when the clerk
opened up next morning he found the safe
door blown to pieces and all the cash gone,
as well as his own revolver and some other
odds and ends.
“Moturoa”: “X.S.” suggests that stolen
false teeth would be unsaleable (B. 12/4/’33),
but —with regard to full upper dentures at all
events—there is no such difference in mouths
as he imagines. A city dentist attends patients
weekly at my country pharmacy, and regu-
larly takes home with him several repair
jobs, to be posted direct to clients when
completed. A woman called in to have her
plate eased. A glance convinced the tooth-
puller that two plates had been mixed; tact-
fully he suggested that the lady should leave
her denture for adjustment and call again in
an hour. Followed a feverish search through
the repair order-book. Mouths which were
known to be abnormal were discarded, and a
likely one was selected. The guess proved
correct. Client No. 2, on being ’phoned,
admitted that her plate had not been a good
fit since repaired, and sent it along. The
dentist industriously scrubbed and polished
the dentures, and later in the day they were
fitted to correct mouths to the entire satis-
faction of the proprietors thereof. But the
fact remains that each had worn another’s
plate for nearly a fortnight without either
being any the wiser.
“C.Q.”: A genuine adopted daughter of
John Pascoc Fawkner has been located.
A Court in N. S. Wales has, established
the lady’s claim beyond contradiction. It
appears that Fawkner’s will is still the sub-
ject of litigation, a Melbourne firm of soli-
citors having applied for an order on behalf
of the adopted daughter as late as 1930.
Fawkner divided his estate into 22 equal
parts and gave two parts of. the income to
the girl in question, who was aged 13 when
he died at 76. She was always with the co-
founder of Melbourne on his early-morning
walks and drives. She is Elizabeth Ann
Springhall, of Kuringai (N.S.W.), and is
the wife of a retired Sydney accountant.
She will probably be a feature of the cen-
tenary celebrations.
THESE HATS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I take uncommonly little stock
At social revels, shivoos or races
In the changing fashions of frill and frock
Or the mode of the hour in wraps and
laces.
Where the frolicksome flapper shows her
paces,
What matter though less and less appear,
’Twixt knee and ankle, of silk-clad spaces?
But where are the hats of yesteryear?
These Lilliput lids are a source of shock.
Of artistry they show no traces;
They fit as a winkle fits a rock;
They turn your thoughts to the fez that
cases
The Turkish head in its dour embraces ;
They hint at the banished nightcap drear
Or the tarn o’ shanter (cut down in
places).
And where are the hats of yesteryear?
Where are the bonnets would sway and rock
In tune with the wearers’ winsome faces?
The amorous brims designed to knock
The hardiest bachelors off their bases?
The Dolly Vardens—perhaps the aces
In all the milliner’s mingled gear—
With garden glories and spoil of chases?
Aye, where are the hats of yesteryear?
Girls, styles like these might have moved
the Graces,
And they who chiselled them, cold and
. clear,
To bitter protests and sour grimaces.
But where are the hats of yesteryear?

T. THE R.


“Lord Luvus”: In a fortune-telling case
in Melbourne a policewoman said that the
accused had told her never to have anything
to do with fair men as they were deceitful
and not to be trusted, that she would have a
trip to Tas., that there would be a train
accident but she would not be seriously
injured, and that her mother would die.
The clairvoyant also said that she could
see a fair and a dark man following the
policewoman about; and that was actually
a correct description of the two constables
who turned up later to make the arrest.
The fortune-teller was fined £lO. On the
same day Sir Oliver Lodge broadcast an
address in which he said he was in constant
communication with the dead and knew
a thousand intimate details about life in
tlie hereafter, including such questions as
whether the departed smoked cigars, drank
whisky or went to picture shows. Nobody
fined Sir Oliver a tenner. This shows the
advantage of a good education.
THE WRETCH.
“Not only has he broken my heart and
wrecked my whole life, but he’s messed
up my evening!”
“Strict Veg.”: The Karoola tourists wlio
visited Noumea recently had an unexpected
treat during their 24-hour sojourn in the
French colony. The authorities publicly
executed an Arab and a half-caste Kanaka
for the murder, 12 months previously, of a
white woman. The instrument used was a
guillotine employed in Paris during the
Terror. The spectacle was accompanied by
the lamentations of the natives and the in-
sistent reverberations of drums. Some of
the Australian spectators were so overcome
that they had to receive medical treatment
on their return to the ship. It almost
appears as if the event had been judiciously
timed to provide the trippers with an out-
standing tourist attraction. If so, it was
something like service.
“Shep”: The paragraph about Strathcona’s
Horse getting down on a waggonload of beer
(B. 5/4/’33) recalls a sudden raid on a
railway truck loaded with whisky by our
■draft starting off at Charleroi for home. We
knew the trucks that pulled up alongside
were for the Expeditionary Force Canteen,
and the red seals on the liquor truck dis-
closed its contents. Armed guards were out
and along the train almost before it had
stopped; but it would have taken tanks to
stem the rush on that particular truck. Back
rolled the big doors, and cases were passed
out, to he promptly scattered along our own
trucks, our train screening the raid from
official eyes. We steamed opt of the station
with ringing cheers and waving bottles before
the E.F.C. guards could organise a counter-
attack with reinforcements of the A.P.M.
and as many M.P.’s as they could hurriedly
collect. They were disconsolate at our pre-
cipitate departure, but they needn’t have
been; it saved the cigarette and tobacco
truck.
“Light Horse”: The British Army in
Egypt has lately been experimenting in sup-
plying cavalry in Sinai with food and water

by aeroplane. Something of the sort was
done in the case of the advanced trenches in
France towards the close of the war and
during the siege of Ivut in Mespot, but only
on a small scale. One regiment in the recent
instance was successfully supplied, the water
ration being one gallon per horse and a
pint per man, two ’planes being used. The
’planes were able to land, but how the water-
cans would have survived a drop remains to
be seen. At Ivut bags of flour and cases
of tinned stuff burst into fragments, even
the tinned stuff faring badly.
“Smallways”: I suppose the push-bike has
years of utility ahead of it in suitable sur-
roundings. but as an item in the streaming
modern traffic of con-
gested cities it strikes
me as a cruel anachron-
ism. At all events no
(Jovernment with a con-
science or a heart should
mount its boy employees
on bicycles and send
them forth to take their
chances in thorough-
fares packed with
motors, trams and
’buses; if they escape
accident of some kind
in the long run it can
only be by a miracle.
Yet the conservative
G.P.O. sticks to the bike
for its telegraph mes-
sengers, or a section ot
them, in Sydney. It s
a wonder there havent
been protests long be-
fore; is it going to take a death and the ver-
dict of a coroner's court to stir officialdom
out of its apathy?
“Nakhoda”: It may be necessary in the
future to give world fliers : refresher courses
in ethnology and comparative religion. Mrs.
Bonney’.s attempt to beat Amy Johnsons
record came to an unfortunate end when she
made a forced landing on the island ot
Baing Baing, near Victoria Point. A buffalo
crossed the lady’s path and, thinking it
might be a sacred animal, she tried to avoid
it. and irreparably damaged her machine.
The buffalo was probably a water buftalo,
and if it was under the care of a Malay, wno
would be a Moslem, or a Burmese, who would
be a Buddhist, he would certainly not. regard
it as sacred in the Hindu sense. However,
buffaloes, sacred or profane, are obstacles
to be avoided in any case. Mrs. BOnney
can consider herself lucky that the animal
did not turn and charge her. All the water-
buffaloes I have met suffered from acute
scenophobia, or untbforcignisin. One chased
me up a tree in Java," and then tried to up-
root the tree. The infuriated beast might
have kept me there indefinitely had not a
native youth about two kerosene-tins high
happened along. After punching the monster
on the nose, lie passed a string through its
ring and led it off as if it were a poodle.
“Hamer”: Winter has brought with it the
revival of that dull foolishness “endurance
dancing.” One Sydney management has
already tried the abomination, and with it a
combination of events, including pole-sitting,
long-distance talking, chair-rocking and hold-
ing a rod over a goldfish bowl; the cham-
pions of these intellectual and athletic pur-
suits whose. records it was desired to break,
live in America. The fishing event seems to
have been most dangerous; a girl who lasted
an hour longer than a male opponent _won
without seriously damaging a Chicago
lady’s record, but the male performer col-
lapsed, and, later on, his screams called
attention to the fact that he was smiting his
head against the floor. Struggling hysteri-
cally, he was carried to Sydney Hospital,
where he tried to go berserk amongst the
doctors. He was “kept under observation,”
according to the report. It might be a good
thing if all the participants in these events
were kept under observation.
* * v . *
“Alcibiades”: The British Labor party has
won adherents from some strange quarters,
among them Baron Ponsonby, who was re-
buked in tlie House of Lords the other day
for “that odd kink of mentality which makes
British Socialists always disposed to think
that their own country is in the wrong”—
in this case in the methods adopted against
Russia. Ponsonby is the son of a general
and the great-grandson of a Prime Minister
(Earl Grey) : liis first official job was that
of Page of Honor to Queen Victoria. He
went from Eton and Oxford into the diplo-
matic service. He married a baronet’s daugh-
ter and became private secretary to another
Prime Minister (Campbell-Bannerman).
Hardly the stuff, one would think, of which
uncompromising Socialists are made; but
you never know.
“■Petty Cury”: One of the brighter spots
of our English flying school was Robinson,
a casual sort who
had picked things
up quicker than
most of us, but
through sheer lazi-
ness never bothered
about his landings
and always had to
be assisted in by his
instructor - “Stag-
gers” we called him
—and the dual con-
trols. “Staggers”
decided that Robin-
son should make a
landing alone. On
their next flight,
“Staggers,” at 2000
feet, pulled out his
dual-control stick,
waved it in the air
for Robinson to
see, and threw it
over the side. A
moment or two
later he felt a tap
on his shoulder and
turned round to be-
hold a grinning
Robinson throw his
stick over the side
as well. “Stag-
gers” turned white,
blasphemed and de-
pinned his belt all
in - the one action,
and clutching his
parachute rip-cord
dived into space.
Robinson then pro-
duced a second
stick which (on
hearing rumors be-
fore setting out)
he had secretly hid-
den beside his seat,
and placing it in
the slot proceeded
to encircle “Stag-
gers” as he slowly
sank towards the
ground. Robinson’s
first solo landing
was an excellent
one.
“Kerys” *' The first wireless was installed
in our small street the other day and caused
much unfriendly comment. Everybody knew
IrSiXesSw not afford it. Mrs. Binks
assured the neighborhood that the ornate
cabinet and accessories were a present from
her rich uncle, who also paid the license
fee. The baker, butcher and grocer accepted
this information dubiously, but made no com-
ment. Not so Mrs. Naggs next door who
keeps a sharp optic on her neighbors
callers. We heard the result shouted to Mrs.
Binks yesterday on her return from town,
“Yef rich uncle, was here this afternoon
Mrs. Binks,” shrilled the voice >; he said
he’d call again to-morrer to collect the money
you owe him fer the wireless!”
“Runa”: Concerning these infractions of
ballot secrecy (B. 26/4/’33). In a small
Maoriland outpost there are four families,
all closely related. The head of one house-
hold stoo'd for Parliament not many years
ago and failed to.get in. That did-.not upset
him as much as the fact that out of the
votes recorded by his relatives six wai
against him. the polling results for that
small booth being for the first time published
separately. Five of his enemies remain un-
discovered. the only one who owned up to
putting a cross against him being his wite,
who viewed with disfavor the idea of run-
ning the farm while her lord was awaj.
“Cliirurgeon” : Attempting to
confute my defence of the use ot
Latin in medical prescriptions,
“Pawang” asks how many_ pre-
scriptions written in Australia are
made up abroad (B. 26/4/’33>.
The answer is —lots. Not an over-
seas steamer leaves Australia with-
out someone on board cherishing a
prescription which has to be made
u]i periodically. “Pawang dodges
one vital point of the defence. That
is that Latin is the accepted lan-
guage of the Pharmacopeia the
world over. To rename the noble
army of drugs in common use alone
would be a staggering job, and
there remains the question as to
what language “Pawang” would
like them renamed in.
“Dingiswayo” : There is more than
a whiff of romance in the story of
Stephanus Molife, who has just
died in Natal, allegedly at 115.
Stephanus, a Cape native, was cap-
tured by the Boers in the early
days of Natal, but escaped and be-
came a member of the Zulu army
which was broken by the Boers
under Andries Pretorius at Blood
River in December, 1838. The.
Zulus had previously massacred a
party, mostly women and children,
left by Pretorius under the care
of Piet Retief while, the Boer
leader was away treating with
Dingaan. The place of the mas-
sacro was named Weenen —the Place ot
Weeping —by the Boers, and is a national
day of mourning in Dutch South Africa, just
as the defeat of Dingaan, which swiftly fol-
lowed. is commemorated in Dingaan’s Day.
“Peltimber”: When miners first exploited
the deep spurs along the Wentworth River
(Yic.) they unearthed the remains of pre-
historic trees, often at a depth of 500 ft.
When first brought to light this semi-fos-
silised timber was soggy, but someone
discovered presently that lathes cut front it,
planed and dried, made first-rate razor-
strops. My mate, an old miner, still owns
one which has been in continual use foi
40 years, and is as good as ever. Before
making its acquaintance I used a strop made
of packing-case timber and the skim ot a
wallaby’s tail. My ten-and-sixpenny
bought strop is an excellent article ot its
kind, but not to be compared with these
home-made ones when, a perfect edge is
needed.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Asked if it. was a fact that, when he was in
office, £60,000 was available for any 10 Labor
.members who would leave the party, Mr. Lang said
that the sum was much more than that.
They left some murky scandals
Behind them when they went,
Dark happenings that were handles
For noisy ill-content.
Commissions sit till weary
And seek to get the hang
Of doings strange and eerie
Beneath the rule of Lang.
Yet be it to their credit
Remembered anyhow
(For he himself has said it) :
There were not even ten in
The ranks would leave their Lenin
For more than .sixty thou.
There may have been suspected

With garish fruit machines;
And, wliosoever’s fingers
The gamey pie were in,
A pungent reek still lingers
About those hares of tin ;
But, getting down to cases,
There were not half a score
Who’d cut their Labor traces
And o’er the floor go burling
For sixty thousand sterling,
Six thou, apiece, or more.
They left —but why remind them? —
A record black as ink:
A busted bank behind them,
A State on ruin’s brink.
No cause for wonder, ergo.

So many felt a tergo

But still, there’s no denying,
For honest pride they’ve grounds.

Could not rope in a dozen
With sixty thousand pounds!

The mystery that has hidden the fate of
Bert Hinkler* has been cleared up by the
finding of his body and his smashed 'plane
in the Tuscan mountains; he crashed in
thick fog when he had covered two-thirds of
the distance from London to Brindisi. It is
likely that the remains will be brought back
to Australia for interment; this country at
least owes Hinkler all the posthumous
honors it can pay him.
“Woondooma”: More than one London
paper has deplored the inability of Hinkler
to turn his achievements to better commercial
account ; it was perhaps his misfortune that
he was as modest and diffident as he was
bray„e and skilful. On his first memorable
solo flight from England to Australia his
Bundaberg friends planned for him a recep-
tion he could turn into money. They wired
him at Darwin to enter into no engagements
or contracts there, and they met him in
Bundaberg with the sure prospect of thou-
sands of pounds’ worth of easy money
(press, theatre, etc.,) and one of Australia’s
livest wires in the stunt-management line.
Bert stood aloof from it all; he “wasn’t
sure what he would do” ; he “hadn’t decided
whether lie would stunt at all.” And so
the chance passed. Hinkler collected a few
hundred pounds in gift-money at most; it is
doubtful if he netted anything from that
recoi'd flight.
Norbert Keenan, the new leader of the
depleted Nationalist party in the Westralian
Assembly, is Dublin-born and -bred; he went
to the goldfields in ’95 and practised at Cool-
gardie and Kalgoorlie, being elected Mayor
of the latter and then its M.L.A. before he
settled in Perth to become a K.C. Though
he has sat in only tln-ee Parliaments he has
been in two Ministries; he was Newton
Moore’s Attoi-ney-General and Jimmy Mit-
chell’s State Secretary, and he parted from
both leaders abruptly, robust independence
being his strong suit. He has made two' or
three trips to England to argue cases before
the Privy Council.
“Banjo” Paterson is the first of the
writers whose books have been published by
the new Endeavour Press to reach a second
edition, and “The Animals Noah Forgot” is
the book implicated.
The new Bishop of Gibraltar (which
covers all the Mediterranean countries) is
11. J. Buxton, who was a small boy in Adel-
aide when his father, Sir Fowell Buxton, was
Governor of S. Aus. in the ’nineties.
Harmer, then Bishop of Adelaide, was pro-
moted to Rochester, and Crawford, then his
chaplain, is now Bishop of Stafford.
Queensland has fallen into line with the
other States and made its Chief Justice also
its Lieut.-Governor; Queensland’s practice
was to give the job to the President of the
Leg. Council, but that’s not easy these days,
there being no Leg. Council to have a Pre-
sident. Since Bill Lennon died the position
has not been filled ; now, however, the Gov-
ernment has done the reasonable thing and
appointed C.-J. Blair. In the days when
he was a politician and Jimmy, he sat for
Queensland’s new Lieut.-Gov. BLAIR.

and played cricket and football, and was one

J. N. Bones, elected Mayor of Roma (Q.)
at 76, was born in Ireland and served in the
Bth (Royal Irish) Hussars. As a youngster
he was with Roberts in the dash from Kabul
to Kandahar. Roma first saw him over
40 years ago, and elected him Mayor for
the first time in 1901. Before that he had
volunteered for service in the Boer War
after raising a squadron of mounted infan-
try ; to his grief he was rejected, as he was
in 1914, so was fain to content himself with
civilian war work.
Cyril Rupert Joseph Ward, second baronet

Vice-Consul for Belgium, and King Albert
made him a Chevalier of the Order of Leo-
pold 11. Baronet Cyril married a Brisbane
girl, and is father of a family of six.
Dr. Spfingthorpe, who died in Melbourne
the other day, deserves to be remembered for
the great fight he put up in France and in
England against the British brass-hats’
efforts to get the death penalty adopted by
the A.I.F. in cases of “cowardice.” Spring-
thorpe, who had given almost lifelong atten-
tion to “nerve” study, knew that very many
cases of so-called cowardice, involving even
desertion, were merely temporary disturb-
ances, to which even the bravest and most
loyal were liable. Lord H'aig was among
those who pressed for the extension of the
penalty. He tried to convert Frank Anstey,
M.H.R., among others; but Springthorpe
had had a few words with Anstey before-
hand, and the field-marshal was told that
no Australian Government which agreed ro
such a proposal would live three days after
Parliament met.
The 51$ years’ service with the Postal
Department of the just-retired Arthur
J. Ryan, of Sydney, isn’t quite a record
(B. 19/4/’33). Fi-ed J. Matthews entered
the service at Clunes (Vic.) in 1873, at the
age of 121, and, after having climbed to be
District Postal Inspector, retired seven years
ago, having put in 521 years. Nowa-
days, the commencing age is 14 and the re-
tiring age 65.
The South Aus. Assembly recovers Harry
Crosby, whom the last Labor flood swept out.
Like scores of others in the central State,
Crosby learned to think on his feet in a
church “literary and debating” society (he
came from the same Glenelg society that gave
the world J. J. Virgo, of Y. Emma), and he
learned practical politics as a country store-
keeper. When he had made the modest com-
petence which is all the thrifty South Aus-
tralian asks, he got into Parliament and
seemed to be making straight for a place in
the front. When he fell out lie did a sensible
thing—he went into business again at his
old town of Gawler, where he might nurse
Barossa. He led the other two National-
Country candidates in.
The appointment of Lord Bledisloe as
Governor of Maoriland has proved an excel-
lent one. He has a sense of history, and
already has developed a vein of Maoriland pat-
riotism undreamt of by his predecessors. A free
spender, he purchased the locale of the sign-
ing of the Waitangi Treaty, and presented
it to the nation as a park. Now he is devot-
ing himself to the understanding of Henare,
and is succeeding almost as well as George
Grey, the only previous Administrator who
thought the study worth while. In circum-
stances that make the game appeal to his
strong sporting proclivities the Maori can
excel as a farmer. The G.-G. has' provided
the circumstances by offering the handsome
Ahuyrhenua (Son-of-the-Soil) Trophy to
holders of land under a development scheme
for natives. The Director of the Dairy Divi-
sion, who did part of the judging the first
year, said that nowhere in Maoriland had
he seen such marvellous cleanliness in
dairies.
Only about a week separated Professor
Dunbabin’s acceptance and; resignation of the
Vice-chancellorship of Tag; University, his
medical adviser having intervened with a few
warning remarks. Psychology Professor
Morris Miller, Litt.D., (Melb.), is the new
Vice. Among the many honorary jobs in
which Miller has done excellent community
service for a decade are the chairmanship of
Tas. Public Library and that of the Institu-
tion for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb; he has
also been at the head of the Mental Defi-
ciency Board. During recent months he has
been helping to clew Up the loose ends of
the Australian bibliography that John Quick
left unfinished.
The last survivor of Garibaldi’s English
Legion—-there were 1000 when they were
picked in 1859 —lives in Grey Lynn, a sub-
urb of Auckland, M.L.—Captain W. J.
Newby. He held his commission in the
British Army when he joined the Legion,
and was a graduate of Cambridge. After
his Italian experiences he migrated to M.L.,
fought in the Maori wars, and then took
up farming. Recently he celebrated his
100th birthday, when a surprise present to
the old chap, arranged for by his friends,
was a letter of congratulation from Benito
Mussolini.
Martin Carrick, who passed out at 72 last
week, had been a figure and a fixture at
Sydney Town Hall for close on half a cen-
tury. He entered the municipal service in
’B3; four years later he was selected by the
mayor of the period for orderly. Orderly
he remained, a trusted officer, a courteous
cicerone and a sort of major-domo of the
local Guildhall, while 30 successive mayors
abode their little hour and went their way.
Municipal officers must retire nowadays at
65, but an exception was made in Martin’s
case; liis long- and meritorious service en-
sured his billet as long as he should care to
fill it. And he died almost in harness, after
a very brief illness.
W. J. Kessell, the newly-appointed N.S.W.
Public Trustee, entered the Justice Depart-
ment when he left All Saints’, Bathurst, 40
years ago. He early showed a capacity for
handling men firmly while retaining their
liking and respect, and he l’arely made a slip
N.S.W. lately-appointed Public Trustee,
W. J. KESSELL.
in the conduct of a departmental problem.
The job of Under-Secretary for Justice came
his way when he was still young, and then a
long and critical illness intervened. He
succeeds chairman Payne, of the P.S. Board,
as Public Trustee.
Do Courcy Ireland, who kept his 88th
birthday at Heidelberg, near Melbourne,
last week, is a son of R.D., who was Vic.
Solicitor-General in ’SS-59, and Attorney-
General between ’6O and ’63. Coming to
Vic. when he was eight De C. followed his
dad’s calling, and for years practised at
Horsham.
A. C. Ahlston succeeds N. C. Harris (re-
cently promoted to be third commissioner)
as chief mechanical engineer of Vic. rail-
ways. His rise has been a rapid one; he
entered the department 25 years ago as an
apprentice fitter and turner. H. N. May
succeeds Ahlston as assistant c.m.e.
Colonel Brinsmead, who was so badly
smashed in Siam that he had to retire from
the job of Controller of Civil Aviation, has
been succeeded by Captain E. C. Johnston,
who had been carrying on in the interim.
Captain Johnston notched more than half
a dozen German ’planes in France with the
Capt . JOHNSTON, new Controller of
Civil Aviation.
R.F.C.; before that he had served with the
A.I.F. in Gallipoli. He joined the Civil
Aviation branch in 1921, and is one of its
most popular members. He is a Groper;
Senator E. B. Johnson is a brother.
George G. Reeve, who contributed many
historical pars, to The Bulletin, has died at
Windsor (N.S.W.), a town dear to his heart.
He was an authority on the family histories
of the early settlers. Reeve helped to found
the Henry Lawson Society, and. with a col-
league, wrote a biography of the poet, the
manuscript of which is at present in London
awaiting publication. His other passion was
Socialism, and he never tired of expound-
ing the views of Danny De Leon, the Ameri-
can founder of the Socialist Labor party.
He was a great-grandson of surgeon John
White of the First Fleet.
E. E. Roberts, who has relinquished the
job of gen. sec. of Vic. Cocky party after
holding it for 15 years, has earned a rest.
He was a veteran public officer when he
retired from the State service before the
war. And over 40 years ago he was chief
president of the A.N.A. Not having any
Parliamentary ambitions, he kept out of the
limelight himself while giving his best to
the organisation.
Sir Henry Royce, whose death in his
native England at 70 is reported, made his
name famous round the world as the designer
of the motor-car and aeroplane engines which
bear his name. His first job was on the Great
Northern Railway, and when only 20 he was
one of the engineers who pioneered the elec-
tric lighting of London and, later, Liverpool.
Going to Manchester as a mechanical and
electrical engineer, he became interested in
the motor-car, then in its infancy. He was
joined by Charles Rolls in 1907, and the
Rolls-Royce firm began the manufacture of
the cars of that name. Rolls was killed in
an aeroplane accident in 1910, but the firm
carried on with Royce as chief engineer.
He received a baronetcy in 1930.
Air Chief-Marshal Geoffrey Salmond started
military life in the Gunners, like his
brother John, whom he followed into the Royal
Flying Corps. After seeing much air service
in France lie'was transferred to Sinai and
Palestine, where he took command of the
R.A.F.C., in addition to the Imperial unit.
li'e planned the obliteration of enemy air re-
connaissance over the British lines prior to
Allenby’s great break-through which de-
stroyed the Turko-German forces. Light
Horsemen, who were always objects of affec-
tionate attention from enemy airmen bent
on destroying their horses, will recall the
peaceful atmosphere of that period after
weary months of harassment. Salmond was
only 55 when he last heard “contact” called.

On the basis of original sums assured, the
business in force at the end of 1932
(£215,682,709) showed an increase of
£1,342,033 over the twelvemonth. With
bonuses added the growth in the figure
(£263,451,027) was £2,752,910, thanks to
the low cost at which the society gathers
its income and manages its investments, the
satisfactory rate of interest earned, favor-
able mortality experience, conservative treat-
ment of the figures and solid nature of. the
assets. Out of takings over the last four
years, and after paying all legitimate claims
and exes, and declaring handsome bonuses
to policy-holders—there are no shareholders
—£280,811 has been written off the book
value of premises and other assets, £1,407,780
has been sent to the lay-by for contingen-
cies (now £2,008,076) and £340,000 has
been added t 0 the tax reserve (£350,000).
By setting aside large sums in addition to
the strong actuarial reserves the management
has helped to offset the effect of the statutory
cut in interest, etc., and the growth of taxa-
tion upon bonuses to policy-holders.
After making provision for interim
bonuses, etc., the surpluses available for dis-
tribution compare as follows :

1932.. 2,470,310 259,751 2,730,061
*Excluding interim bonuses.
The spring of £27,246 in the amount avail-
able last year was due to smaller provision
for contingencies (£5319 as against £748,851
in 1931). The tax bill (£822,230) was
£119,853 heavier. Also, the rate of interest
assumed in the Industrial section was
lowered from 3| p.c. to 3 p.c., which
involved the addition of £341,693 to the
actuarial reserves, the aim being mainten-
ance of satisfactory bonuses in the future.
Including £25,053 of interim bonuses, last
year’s distribution in the Ordinary branch
was 46.3 p.c. of the premiums on partici-
pating policies as against 45.8 p.c., 1931 ;
51.8 p.c., 1930; 58.1 p.c., 1928; 30.2 p.c.,
1914-18.
Combining the figures of the two depart-
ments £13,610,327 of new business was writ-
ten last year; this was £2,109,493 more than
in 1932. Surrenders (£1,728,162, including
£286,575 of bonuses cashed) were £321,920
lighter. The contraction of £362,672 in total
income (£11,248,325) resulted from a shrink-
age of £364,940 in interest, etc.; it should
not be long before the figures begin to im-
prove in this respect. Net premiums were
£7,061,219, an increase of £2269. Owing to
lighter provision for contingencies, £2,961,658,
or £448,785 more than for the previous year,
was added to the Assurance funds, raising
them to £86.258,112 at Dec. 31.
Of the Ordinary premiums the office allows
18.7 p.c. for exes., etc. Excluding taxes but
including contributions to the staff fund,
exes, took 11.9 p.c. of last year’s net pre-
miums plus consideration for annuities as
against 11, 11.1 and 12.7 p.c. for the three
preceding years. Of the year’s total income
(net premiums plus net interest) exes, took
7.7 p.c. as against 6.8 p.c. and 6.7 p.c. in
1931 and 1930 respectively.
As for interest, the office now assumes
that its funds will earn a uniform 3 p.c.
After deducting taxes, the net return was
a shade over 4 p.c. on the mean Assurance
fund in the Ordinary and a shade under
4 p.c. in the Industrial branch as against
4.6 p.c. and 4.7 p.c. respectively in 1931.
In the Industrial section incomings and
outgoings compare as follows: —

Of the slip of £36,790 in last year's income,
£3l 359 was on account of- interest
(£538,253). Again leaving taxes out of the
reckoning, and excluding fidelity guarantee
business, exes, took 27.1 p.c. of the net pre-
miums (£1.544,535) as against 24.8 p.c. m
1931. Owing to the lower rate of interest
assumed, the office allowance for exes, is
now 26.5 p.c. of the premium income com-
pared with 29 p.c. previously.

A growth oT £635,706 in deposits was accom-
panied by a contraction of £122,514 in
bills discounted and an expansion of
£507,301 in low interest-bearing liquid securi-
ties ; only £7371 was added to the book value
of advances. Also there was a cut of 1 p.c.,
more in some cases, in the charge made for
overdrafts. Certainly the price paid for
deposits has been lowered from 51 p.c. to
3 p.c. for 24 months’ and from 41 p.c. to 2
p.c. for three months’ currencies. Of course,
reductions applied only to new contracts;
still, as the old ones run out the pressure
will be relieved. The discount rate for local
Treasury bills (6 p.c. a couple of years
ago) has come down to 2f p.c., while call
money in London now earns as little as one
half of 1 p.c. or less. Moreover, most of the
bank’s business is in its home State, which
had a succession of drought years just before
the financial crisis arrived; and many pas-
toralists and others borrowed more than
their properties and stock, etc., are now
worth. So, despite a good season and a
better price for wheat, after making provi-
sion for bad and doubtful debts and other
contingencies there was a further contrac-
tion of £13,049 in the year’s declared net
earnings. These were no more than 2.3 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
combined), or 4.2 p.c. on the £1.250,000 of
capital alone, as against 5.3, 7.3, 11, 11.6,
11.1, 11.6 and 11.9 p.c. back to 1927. The
div. was kept at 4 p.c.; it had remained
steady at 10 p.c. for the dozen years to the
close of accounts in 1929; and over the same
period £750,000 of fresh capital, together
with £200,000 of share , premiums, had been
gathered.
The market prices the £lO shares paid to
£5 (the other £5 is a contingent liability
callable only in the event of liquidation) at
£5 125.; at this figure the return is 3.5
p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. The investor
who looks for a shade over 5.3 p.c. on his
money thus counts on a 6 p.c. div. The
visible backing is £9 3s. 6d. per share in net
tangibles; that is to say, capital and reserves
combined need net only 3.2 p.c. to show 6 p.c.
on capital alone. Improvement in net earn-
ings will largely depend upon further re-
covery of prices, especially wool and wheat,
and upon the use the co. is able to make of
depositors’ money and its own funds.

The growth of deposits appears to have been
mostly in current accounts ; according to the
Dec. quarterly averages 72.9 p.c. of the lot
was interest-bearing as against 73.9 p.c. and
75.1 p.c. for the corresponding quarters of
1931 and 1930 respectively.

Thus, when the books closed, £55 of every
£lOO of the public’s money was held liquid
as against £36 6s. three years ago. Alto-
gether the bank was holding only £3 2s. of
the public’s money for every pound of its
own. It is a very strong position, but if
means low earning power.

The scattering of loan funds produced such
a heavy crop of these finance cos. that thq
field became overcrowded, even during the
boom. This one set up in the motor-vehicle
hire-purchase business in 1923. Later it
threw off a subsidiary. General Investments
and Discounts, Ltd., in which it owns all
the £25.000 of capital, to handle t.-p. busi-
ness apart from automobiles. Shareholders
in the parent averaged 7.6 p.c. for the five
years to the close of accounts in 1930 But
with the arrival of hard tunes bad debts ex-
ceeded expectations, and the nature of the
business began to changeless than one-
quarter of the co.’s funds was used in the
motor trade a year ago ; also, properties hat
fallen into the co. s hands as mortgagee,
and it had to pay off the first mortgage on
others in order to protect its interests.
It all caused “considerable disquietude as
to the future” amongst a large number of the
shareholders, who asked the board to wind
up the business and return the capital or
so much of it as might be available, lhis
the board has decided to do, having come to
the conclusion “that the motor-vehicle hire-
purchase business offering m the future _wdl
not be nearly sufficient to keep, shareholders
capital or a substantial portion of it, fully
employed ” Shareholders will be called
together on May 31 to pass the necessary
resolutions. „ , .
Combining the figures of the two cos las,
year’s trading resulted in a profit of £2o-0
as against a loss of £10,955 in 1931. That
was after writing off all ascertained bad
debts. The sum involved was £20,10U, of
which £14,037, including £lO,OOO for doubt-
ful debts, was charged against the years
earnings, £4OOO against tluv general reserve
and the balance against the bad and doubtful
debts reserve, reducing it to £19,793 at Dec.
31 1932
The position as the parent’s sheet showed
it was as follows :

appears there were net tangibles with a book

The strength of the business lies mainly in
rapid turnover, and this has been made pos-
sible chiefly by good buying and by the suita-
bility of the site. Moreover, the co. handles
the less expensive class of goods to
which the public has now largely turned
its attention. Distributions to shareholders
climbed from 5 p.c. in 1922 to 15 p.c.
for the four years to the close of accounts
in 1930; they dropped to 10 p.c., and 7 p.c.
respectively in the two following terms, but
the figure* rose to 10 p.c. again last year.
So far as can be seen, which is not very
far these days, there is nothing to suggest
a recession in the co.’s earnings ; still, it is
very doubtful whether anything better than
10 p.c. need be looked for.
During the last half of the 12 months to
the end of February trade generally took on
a better tone; also prices were steadier, and
stocks therefore less troublesome, while a
little relief was gained from the reduction of
interest on the mortgage, and the manage-
ment kept a tight hold upon other out-
goings. The spring in gross earnings
(£163,979) was £11,455; exes. (£138,635)
took £4138 of the increase, owing to heavier
taxation. After handing the prefs. their
£BOO, there was enough to show 10.1 p.a on
ord. capital as against 7.1. 10.3, 20.8, 25.5,
26.2 and 22 p.c. back to 1927.
It is only within the last decade that the
co. has forged ahead. During that time it
bought the freehold _ of its George-street
premises, together with the business arid
freehold of its old friend and neighbor. W.
T. Waters. Another adjoining property,
Denison House, was bought, thus anchor-
ing goodwill, which was rubbed out of the
accounts in 1923. How the deals were
financed, and other things, are seen m tne
following comparison of balance-sheet figures t

Last year £14.500 was knocked off the mort-
gage and £4628 added to the book value of
freeholds, investments, etc., while only £2162
was tacked on to the amount coming to
sundry creditors. Stocks are £48,894 lighter
than they were three years ago, due partly
to the drop in values. The more or less
liquid surplus (£34,036. including stocks)
improved £4781 during the twelvemonth.
On the market the price of the pound ords.
rose to 455. 6d. in 1929 ; it fell to 235. two
years ago, and is now 365. The return at
365. is 5.5 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The
cover is 80s. 4d. in net tangibles. The well
protected prefs. seldom come on to the

This co.'.s earnings depend chiefly upon the
activity in suburban liome-building. For the
eight months to the end of February the
value of permits issued for the erection of
dwellings in greater Melbourne was £834,115
as against £333,790 and £2,789,382 for the
corresponding periods of 1931-32 and 1929-30
respectively. Hence the collapse of earn-
ings and the slight recovery in the figures
last year, when there was enough profit to
show 1,7 p.c. on capital, and 1§ p.c. was
distributed. It is plain that turnover
needs to liven a lot yet before satis-
factory returns on capital as it now stands
can be expected. At the moment it is doubt-
ful to what extent, if any, substantial im-
provement can be looked for.
During the decade to the close of accounts
in 1930 shareholders averaged 10.9 p.c.,
sweetened with a small capitalisation (2s. 6d.
per share) in 1924. Also. £30,576 of bonus
scrip was received on holdings in other cos.
This was added to reserves on one side and
the .book value of the holdings on the other.
The holdings, apparently in a kindred trade,
are not worth much to the co. these days.

improvement being £2331 over the twelve-

This drapery offshoot of Marcus Clark and
Co. —it trades largely on a t.-p. basis —has
had difficulty in getting into step with altered
trading conditions. During the 12 months
covered by the latest accounts the co.’s sell-
ing prices had to be further reduced, its
turnover continued to fall away and the
debts question, which has been complicated
by continued unemployment and the mora-
torium, remained perplexing. After paying
all exes, and providing for bad and doubC
ful debts, etc., the trading loss was £17,575
as against £7913 for the previous term. In
addition, £2625 was struck off the book value
of investments, reducing the item to £2375.
Thus reserves were lowered by £20,500, leav-
ing them £19,372 short of goodwill (£60,000),
which is not treated as an asset herein. The
Insurance fund (£5000) has not been
reckoned as a free reserve.
After allowing for pref. divs., profits aver-
aged 15.3 p.c. on ord. capital for the five
years to the close of accounts in 1929.
Meanwhile, the freehold was bought and the
premises were extended. To finance the out-
lay and carry more book debts £60,000 was
raised on mortgage and £20,000 of fresh
pref. money was gathered, making paid capi-
tal £200,000. one-half prefs. and the other
half ords. —the ords. are held by the parent.
Incidentally, the book value of the freehold
was written up £25,000. the amount by which
the valuation exceeded the purchase price,
and paper reserves benefited.

show it is as follows: —

gage (now £54,000), while £9164 was added
to the amount coming to trade creditors, and
the book value of stocks and debtors bal-
ances was reduced by £2-o6 and £(626
respectively. The drop of £2230 m invest-
ments, etc., is mainly on accQunt of the writ-
ing off The shrinkage in the more or less
liquid surplus (£46,958, including stocks)

Nothing could be more descriptive of freshness
than the phrase " Fresh as a Capstan ” because
"Capstans” sell so quickly and in such vast quan-
tities that whenever and wherever you buy them
you are always sure to get a freshly made
cigarette.
The popularity of "Capstans” is due to the famous
"Capstan” blend, which is different to that of any
other cigarette. It is this blend which accounts for
the fact that ten people smoke "Capstans” for
every one who smokes another brand. This means
rapid sales, and rapid sales mean freshness.

tions permit, credit buying can be expected
to revive, but it is not likely to be practised
on the same scale as in the past.
The pound prefs., covered by net tangibles
with a book value of 365. ld. t are offered at

been lowered to 5.8 p.c. by the statutory cut.
The question of giving silver a statutory
value is to be discussed at the coming World
Economic Conference. Some supporters of
the proposal suggest a ratio of 1 to 16 with
gold. This would be equivalent to over ss.
per ounce as against the present market
value of about Is. Bd. However, European
experience during the nineteenth century
shows that bimetallism will not work at a
fixed mint ratio unless all countries agree
to observe that ratio. The preparatory com-
mittee of experts to the World Economic
Conference says, “From the point of view
of commercial relations, with silver-using
countries, especially China, trade interests
would best be served, not by a rise in the
price of silver as such, but by a. rise in the
general level of commodity prices.” The
annual production of silver at Broken Hill
is about eight million ounces; at Mt. Isa, two
million ounces ; Tasmania, 450,000 oz.; West-
rali'a, 60,0000 z. A substantial rise in the
price would be an incentive for Electrolytic
Zinc to start up at Rosebery, where the ore
contains 7oz. silver per ton.
* * * *
The present output of lead concentrates
from the North, Zinc C'orp., South and Sul-
phide Corp. at the Barrier is 16,700 tons
per four weeks, equal to 163,000 tons of lead
annually. Though the Port Pirie smelters,
where the concentrates are treated, are cap-
able of turning out 195,000 tons of lead
annually, production during the last three
years has averaged only 154,900 tons. Thus
the present output of lead concentrates
exceeds the requirements of the smelters,
where 40,000 tons of concentrates is on hand.
The total stock of lead in metal and recover-
able from concentrates approximates 120,000
tons as against a normal stock of about
40,000 tons. Steps are to be taken to bring
production at Broken Hill into line with the
output at Pirie, which is governed by over-
sea sales; less than 7 p.c. of the output is
sold in Australia.

Following the closure of the Cobar Tunnel
(formerly Eskbank) colliery at Lithgow
(N.S.W.), the Zig-zag mine has been sealed
down after producing just over 2,000,000
tons of coal in 50 years. Thomas Sutcliffe
Mort bought the Zig-zag property (410 acres)
in the seventies of last century, but died
before production began. Then Thomas
Saywcll, and later his trustees, practically
controlled operations throughout. Associ-
ated with the pit, which took its name from
the famous Zig-zag railway near by, was J.
Haydon Cardew, the Sydney mining sur-
veyor; he linked up in 1888, and knew every
corner of the workings.
*s* jj*
In the Gunning district (N.S.W.) some
rich stone lias been taken out from a per-
sistent shear zone near the junction of
granite and slate. Four crusbings totalling
12 tons have yielded 420 z. of gold. A
battery is being erected. So far very little
alluvial has been found.

New Guinea Goldfields recovered 34390 z.

vial flats and 13990 z. from the mill. Exten-
sions to the cyanide section of the plant are
expected to be complete, by the end of
August, when the mill capacity will be 150
tons daily. Boring on the new alluvial areas
is in progress; the first tw T o holes were
blanks.
Cracow Gold’s sluicing proposition on tho
lower Watut, New Guinea, has proved to
be too low-grade even at the present price
of gold. An option has now been taken over
a dredging area, said to contain 15,000,000
cubic yards; this is to be test-bored. Aus-
tralian Gold Development is halving the cost
with Cracow Gold.

During 1932 the Chillagoe State Smelters
.(Q-) produced 2902 tons of blister, contain-
ing 2817 tons of copper, 20340 z. of gold and
51,9400 z. of silver. There was not enough
ore available to run the lead-smelting sec-
tion. The low price of copper restricted
the activity of gougers in the Cloncurry area,
from which the Trekelano maintained weekly
dispatches of 140 tons of 13 p.c. copper ore,
.and the Orphan 120 tons, assaying 32 p.c.
Queensland Quicksilver, Kilkivan (Q.),
has erected its sluicing plant on the Blood-
worth area, which is estimated to contain
800,000 c.y. of cinnabar-bearing wash. The
plant, which has a capacity of 80 c.y. per
hour, consists of two portable lOin. gravel
pumps and 120 ft. of sluice boxes. Opera-
tions will commence with the first heavy
rams. The cinnabar recovered will be

O n Gorge Creek lead, near Pentland
(Q;), shaft sinking has proved 6ft. of easily
sluiced wash, carrying from ldwt. to 3.sdwt
gold per c.y. at a depth of 30ft. Two lines
of bores, 400 ft. apart, are to be sunk to
test the continuation of the lead down-
stream. The area was first worked over 40
years ago.

A 270 z. 18dwt. gold nugget was recently
unearthed at Mount Leyshon. outside Char-
ters Ttowers (N.Q.). The find was made
near where the. Prince of Wales nugget
(1430 z.) was discovered some years ago.
One of the. most promising claims is Chap-
man’s, which recently crushed 11 tons of
brown stone for 19oz. of gold. Several other
crushings have averaged over an ounce.

A southern syndicate is running the rule

A deposit of ilmenite has been discovered
in a wash, 9ft. deep and 50 acres in extent,
at Cooroy (Q.). Quantities of the same
mineral are also known to exist along the
Coolum Beach near by.

Last three crushings from the Hercules
(Vic.) have been exceptionally rich —215 tons.
518 oz.; 224 tons, 588 oz.; the latest, and
best for five months, 212 tons, 6160 z. The
average for the lot is 2oz. I3dwt. per ton.
The total yield from the new reef is now
12,6420 z. from 6018 tons.

On the Dividend Gold, Tarnagulla (Vic.),
more efficient haulage and pumping equip-
ment is to be installed, and a battery erected.
The lode is 9ft. wide, assaying odwt. Some

markably rich; the Poverty yielded over-
£l,ooo,ooo worth of gold from a length of
200 ft. and a depth of 400 ft.

During the last four months three parties
crushed 127 tons from the Working Miners’
Hill, Creswick (Vic.), for 78oz. of gold. At
Spring Hill, 300 tons assaying 9dwt. has
been taken out. Both properties show
promise as largo low-grade producers.

The erection of the crushing and flotation
plant at Moonta (S. Aus.) is complete.
The job cost £BOOO, and will be paid for out
of the grant of £15,000 from the Common-
wealth Government. Ore reserves total
31,000 tons, assaying 5 p.c. copper, and
there ,are excellent prospects of additions.
The concentrates, expected to assay at least
25 p.c., are to be sent to Port Kembla.

At North Mt. Farrell, Tullah (Tas.), the
new galena lode which' outcrops on a creek
bank has been. proved for 250 ft., widths
varying from 6in. to 24in., and costeening

Scott, State mining engineer, has reported
very favorably on the new find.

At Beaconsfield (Tas.) a start has been
made to sink the main shaft from 80ft. to
180 ft., from which point it is intended to
crosscut to the lode, a distance of 70ft. It
is expected that the work will be finished by
the end of May. Development work on the
Tasmanian leases is in hand, but shortage of
water has prevented crushing.

Holdfast Gold has completed its diversion
tunnel on the Whyte River (Tas.), and is
now clearing the bed of timber. A suction
elevator will be used to raise the wash, and
will commence operations downstream.

There has been talk of amalgamation
between Lake View and Star and Great
Boulder Prop., whose leases adjoin at the
southern end of the Kalgoorlie field. During
1932 the Great Boulder Prop, increased its
ore reserves from 80,370 tons (assay
9idwt.) to 211,000 tons (assay Bidwt.). It
found ore assaying 16dwt. over a width of
27ft. on the 1650 ft. level, and lOdwt. stone,
width lift., on the 800 ft. level of the Edward
shaft. The co. has been considering the erec-
tion of a new 12,000-ton -per-month plant at a
cost of £BO,OOO, and results of the bromo-
cyanide and flotation methods as carried
out at Boulder Perseverance and Lake
View and Star have been closely watched.
Lake View and Star is now treating 42,700
tons monthly, and may be pleased to have
Great Boulder to draw upon, since its own
comparatively narrow lodes mean extensive
development ahead of stoping. Treatment
costs at Lake View are now 6s. per ton, the
lowest on the field, and about half the cost
that could be expected when treating 12,000
tons monthly. Great Boulder Prop.’s paid
capital is £175,000. At the end of Dec. 31,
cash and debtors’ balances totalled £162,765.
There was £24,286 coming to creditors, and
£39,549 was reserved for tributors.

The chairman of Edna May ( W.A.) claims
that, the co.’s Westonia derelict, which has been
worked for only a few months in the last
two years, ’is one of the best gold-mining
propositions in the West, provided it can be
worked on up-to-date lines. The manager
added that with an expenditure of £75,000
on the installation of pumping and treat-
ment plant, the show could produce 14,0000 z.
of gold per month. The Edna May lodes
were worked down to 500 ft. vertically, where
they showed signs of pinching. Certainly
there are blocks of ore in the flooded work-
ings above 500 ft.; but many believe that
it would cost more to extract and treat the
stone than it is -worth.

Ora Banda shares slumped badly in Adel-
aide on receipt of geologist Gibson’s report
that the show was too small for a co. Dis-
interested mining men who had a squint at
the property before Gijjson were not sur-
prised at his summing up, despite glowing
official reports. There are other ventures
similar to Ora Banda being boosted in the
West.

Broken Hill Prop, is crosscutting from
the 1500 ft. level of the Great Boulder and

plant on Hannan’s North Extended will be
in operation by the middle of the year.

pretty long odds; the last one is a doubtful propo-

premises. Now that some of the trade has gone
back to Queen-street, the market has lowered its bid
for pound shares from 18s. to 14s. 6d. over the last
few months. Net earnings dropped from 14.3 p.c. to
5 p.c. on capital over last five years; div. lowered

THE SOAP-BOX
Ad attempt to answer some of the questions asked by correspondents.
Is Federation Necessary ?
Didn’t we make a mistake in federating?
The tendency, it seems to me, is all towards
individualism; the Russian experiment has
done more damage to Communism than any-
thing else in my long lifetime. If the com-
petitive system is good for the individual
man, I begin to think it would be good for
the individual State. —0. S. M. (Vic.).
We are not going to defend this Federa-
tion ; to be satisfactory it will’ have to
undergo many changes. But surely the
failure of Communism hasn’t affected the
value of co-operation! Nobody thinks that
one ordinary man can make for himself
better provision for his widow and family
in the unfortunate event of liis early death
than a life office can make for him. Nobody
thinks because six people live in one house
there need be six doors to let them in and
out. Nobody thinks because there are six
houses in a street, all liable to be burned,
that each house should have its own lire
brigade. If we abolished this Federation
to-morrow we should begin to feel the need
of another the next day.
Imported Archbishops
You ask, apropos “importing ” an arch-
bishop, "Is it necessary to search abroad for
a suitable man?” Well, I’ll ask %ohy you
have on your staff the artist ,Frith —from
England, Was it necessary to go outside of
Australia for a new man? The plain fact
is Australia badly needs “new blood” —
people of ability, overseas experience, wide
views, etc., both in the church and in busi-
ness. This land of ours is very large, but-
thinly populated, and the isolation tends to
make the population short-sighted, narrow-
minded and one-sided—like the press. —
R. D. W.
That misses Tiie Bulletin's point. It
doesn’t object to people from overseas being
employed in Australia —doesn’t even object
to people from overseas being imported to
Australia. What it says should be avoided
is the introduction of men to the best jobs,
over the heads of men, native-born and im-
ported, who have been doing the poorly-paid
little jobs and learning how to do the big
ones. For the most part the men introduced
have had comparatively small jobs abroad
compared with those which other men have
done in Australia —and that applies parti-
cularly to imported bishops and archbishops.
As for Frith —oh yes, he came from England.
But The Bulletin didn’t engage him there;
and, anyhow, he wasn’t straightway
appointed archbishop of the staff.
The Gospel of Cheapness
You show how better machinery cheapens
production and releases men for other work,
but you defend the production of sugar at
£IS per ton when it could be imported for
£6. Surely those who compel the community
to spend three times as much as is necessary
for a commodity are on a level with those
who retain obsolete machinery to the com-
munity’s disadvantage. In both cases men
could be transferred to more profitable jobs
and the consumer would benefit by lower
prices. But you ask “How should we main-
tain our standard of living?” One would
think if we could buy more with the same
money our standard of living would be im-
proved ; 07' if we could supply our needs with
less cash our standard would not be lowered.
It seems foolish to refuse commodities at a
fraction of the price it costs us to produce
them. —M. A. W.
If we ought to import everything that
could be imported for less than we can
produce it for, where would we get the
money to buy anything with? Certainly we
could not grow sugar, because the- black-
labor sugar would swamp the market; and
we couldn’t make any machinery, because
the cheaper-labor countries would drown
those industries. We might grow wool and
wheat for a while; but if it is a proper thing
to allow our white sugar industry to be
killed by colored labor—if cheapness, in
short, is the only thing to be aimed at —
what could be said against importing
Chinese, Indian and other coolies to tend
the sheep and grow the wheat?
Machinery and Men
You don’t think machinery is the major
influence in unemployment. But how are
you going to “climb over” the following
typical facts, which are all the more potent
because of the gravity of the American
situation? In American flour-milling 32,000
workmen were employed 'in 1899 and only
24,600 in 1929, despite that 75 million more
bushels were ground in 1929 than 1899.
Whereas in 1900 70 man-hours were required
to produce one ton of steel, by 1929 the
number had been reduced to 13 man-hours.
In 1904, 1291 man-hours were required to
produce one automobile; in 1929 only 92
man-hours. To my mind those facts are
incontrovertible evidence that there is going
to be trouble if we cannot stimulate and
provide the wherewithal for increased con-
sumption.—W. A. B. (Q.).
If machines hadn’t displaced men, how
should we have got the labor force neces-
sary to produce the motor-cars? And if
machines hadn’t displaced men in the pro-
duction of motor-cai’s, where should we have
got the labor force required in the new wire-
less industry? Obviously mechanisation of
some old industries made new industries
possible. Mechanisation has various effects :
(1) it calls for construction of machinery
and production of power, and this partly
absorbs labor displaced; (2) it cheapens
production, and gives increased turnover, so
that, though in 1929 the making of a motor-
ear called for only 92 man-hours as against
1921 man-hours in 1904, probably 10 times
more men were engaged in this industry in
1929 than in 1904; and (3) it permits of
the building up of capital funds to finance
new industries and the purchase of new
goods. As for the wherewithal for increased
consumption, 7400 fewer men were em-
ployod in American flour mills, though 75
million bushels more wheat was ground.
.1 his means that (disregarding the cost and.
consumption of machinery for the moment)
the millers made more profit, or the opera-
tives got more wages, or the flour was sold
for less, or the farmers got more for their
wheat. The result was the same whichever
happened: there was more money to buy the
new goods which the 7400 men produced.
Money, however, doesn’t really buy things:
goods and services are exchanged for other
goods and services. That is why unemploy-
ment is always unnecessary and avoidable.
Until all our needs are satisfied, there must
be enough work for all in satisfying the
needs of one another. Unemployment is
simply the result of bad staff work, as they
would have said in the army.
A Twenty-four Hour Week
While a 30 -hour week for 44 or 48 hours'
pay will not solve the unemployment pro-
blem, there should be a fair chance of find-
ing such solution in a 24-hour week for
24 hours' pay. Better surely to have the
whole wage-earning population employed
half the time on half-pay than to have half
employed all the time on full pay, while the
other half lives on charity. — Clem G.
But why aim so low? If we employ men
for 24 hours a week they can live only on
a corresponding standard. They will want
a vast number of things which they will not
be able to get. Why not aim to give them
full employment so that they may have all
those things? The fundamental fact is that
we don’t buy goods or services with money:
we buy them with other goods and ser-
vices ; ’ and the maintenance of the com-
munity in full work is a matter simply of
arranging for the exchange of goods and
services. It would have been done long ago
if the politicians and the economists hadn’t
fallen down on their job.
Prices
The pound note in 1928 was equal to the
sovereign, The pound note to-day should
therefore be equal to about 80s., and we
should to-day be in just as good a position
financially as in 1928. By “ monkeying ” we
have had to bring in all sorts of legislative
palliatives, not one of which has restored our
finances or raised prices. You suggest
another palliative-—quite a just one—but it
ivill be equally futile in raising prices. Until
gold recedes in price to the 1928 level, or
we raise the price of the pound note to cor-
respond with the gold price , there can be no
relief. You cannot double the length of the
foot rule or the standard measure of value
without disastrous results, and the world is
beginning to realise this. — Sound Currency.
Hut, apart from every other consideration,
why 1028? What right has that year more
than any other to be the standard? Appar-
ently no other right than that it was the last
boom year. But there were years of greater
boom not so long before that. The wool-
average in 1927-28 was £24 19s. lid.; in
1924-25 it was £33 13s. lOd. —per bale, of
course. Why not, then, restore the 1924-25
levels? The N.S.W. Statistician takes 1911
as the basic year (average wholesale prices
for that year = 100). Compared with 1911
the sovereign in 1928 and thereabouts was
worth only about 11s. in purchasing-power.
The real trouble is that, whereas non-rural
commodities are mostly 75 p.c. more than
they were in 1911, rural commodities are
just about the same prices that they were
in 1911 —which is less than two-thirds of
what they were in 1928. It is to this mal-
adjustment of prices that we ought to devote
our attention —not to an attempt to restore
boom prices. Indeed, a general raising of
price levels wouldn’t do the primary pro-
ducer much good. His right is to have his
levels raised while a great many others are
left where they are.
Machinery and Profits
I hare read with interest your articles on
machinery and unemployment, and agree
with most of them. But under our present
system machinery surely gives power to cer-
tain individuals to acquire more than their
just share of the benefits arising from its
use. A few years ago 1 was associated with
a proprietary concern which with a pay-
roll of no more than 65 made a net profit in
one year of close on £30,000. Gan that be
justified ? —A. 11. (Q.).
Well, it might be. The Bulletin knows
a man who makes £5OOO a year just by writ-
ing books, and all he employs is a typist.
It isn’t at all certain that this typist is
entitled to more pay than another who
works quite as hard making fair copies for
authors who are never printed and make
nothing at all.
Australian Literature
You mention the number and variety of
good short stories now available in Australia.
Then why not establish a weekly or monthly
short-story magazine to relieve the conges-
tion? There is a steady demand for this
type of literature, and the thanks of writers
for the bigger market would be heard from
Gape York to the Lecuwin. — Gordon T.
(S.A.),
It is hopeless so long as the Federal Gov-
ernment allows overseas _ magazines to be
dumped in Australia. Copies unsold in other
countries —America especially—are landed
in Australia bv the thousands and sold below
cost. And it is the same with novels. When
the Australian writer can bring enough pres-
sure to bear on the politician to have this
practice stopped, a story magazine will be
forthcoming.
Creditors and the Law
How long, 0 Lord, hoio long, are we to
wait for those in authority to do something
worth while? And when are your own
financial experts going to give us some
practical advice? We have been told “Wait
for this and that” till we’re tired. Wc have
worked on, fighting droughts and overdrafts
and pompous bank managers, scarcity of
water, stench of dead sheep and rabbits, and
inability to provide proper food and a few
amenities to our dependants ; and we ask:
flow much longer? —M. 11. It.
The farmer has suffered, but he won’t do
himself any good by assuming that he is
the only sufferer. Thousands of city men
who thought they had built up very com-
fortable businesses have seen them evapor-
ate ; there is a man in mind at the moment
who thought he was worth £150,000 four
years ago, and to-day hasn’t a penny. As
a rule, the grazier can at least go on living
fairly well —in the old home, as a rule, and
with abundance of food. The city man who
is on the rocks is, in many cases, without
a home, and in most cases has to struggle
terribly for food. The farmer is in a way
really very lucky. While other men who
are insolvent are being abandoned, the
farmer has been selected for special treat-
ment : it is suggested that his creditors shall
forgiye him a part of his debt so that he
may remain in possession of the property
and have an opportunity to make it his own.
Apart from the doubtful method of mone-
tary inflation, the only way in which this
can be done is by persuading the creditor
to accept heavy losses. Hundreds of farmers
write in the same terms as this corres-
pondent. Do they honestly think that Gov-
ernments can take creditors by the scruff
of the neck and say: “Here, this man owes
you a pound. You’ll take 10 bob and call
it square”?
THE TAMING OF EBENEZER.

The most ambitious and successful musical
work by a local composer that present writer
has yet heard in Melbourne was George Ei »*
lish’s “Symphony in A Major, performe
by the composer at the Town Ha
on Saturday. There was nothing cheap
or commonplace about it. Jiinglisli
not belong to that tedious school o
Australian composers who conceal tnem
selves in gullies, take down bird noises,
string them together and call the result a
bush rhapsody, a method of composition
analogous to setting up a dictaphone in
Collins-street and calling the result drama.
The first two movements, Con motto esptes-
sione and Allegretto moderato vivace, were
full of lovely sound, but seemed to meander
a trifle. This impression might be altered
on a second hearing. The Adagio was grace-
ful and melodious. The last movement, oon
brio moderato, was fine, jolly, vigorous and
exhilarating. The forces of the strings, wood
wind and brasses were assembled tor tne
finale and flung at great speed at the fiist
subject. The composer received an immense
ovation.
The second part of the programme was
devoted to Verdi’s “Requiem,” composed m
memory of Allessandro Manzoni, the Italian
author, who died in 1873. He must havd
been a great friend of the composer of bad
and good operas, for Verdi never invoked
his muse with more sincerity. The horror
of the infernal shades is painted . with
dreadful intensity in a manner reminiscent
of “Aida.” The four tremendous chords
which announce the Day of Judgment are
enough to bring the most casual siriner to
repentance, and a prayer for deliverance
from the unquenchable flames deepens the
Impression of foreboding. The whispered in-
vocation, “Libera me,” causes a queer tight-
ening of the diaphragm, and the work closes
with the frenzied cry, “Domine, Libera me
de morte aeterna,” followed by the muttered
prayer, “Libera me,” again. Conductor Eng-
lish got splendid singing out of the choir of
the Postal Institute. Amy Castles still has
a voice which can give dramatic passion to
liturgical music, and A. C. Bartleman’s rich
baritone was on duty in the solemn passages.
Mezzo Elizabeth Galbraith and tenor Laur-
ance Barker, together with the baritone,
sang the best trio in the work with genuine
feeling.

A great deal of nonsense lias already
been written about Philip Hargrave, the ten-
year-old pianist from Adelaide. He has been
described as a genius, whose superb technique
and powers of interpretation leave the hearer
baffled and filled with inexpressible emotions.
Along with the desire to acclaim him as a
genius goes the desire to emphasise his child-
ishness, and on Saturday night at the Melb.
Auditorium he was presented with strings
of penny balloons. Stories are abroad that
at one "concert he had to be dragged off a
scooter in the interval to finish his pro-
gramme.
Mozart played the harpsichord at four, and
composed an opera, which was publicly per-
formed, at 12. The good people \vho want
to make a Peter Pan of Master Philip can’t
have it both ways. If he is able to plumb
the depths and climb the heights of Beet-
hoven he cannot be really interested in toy
balloons. A child plays with toys in order
to acquire knowledge and power. Master
Philip seems to be like one of those sports of
the evolutionary process w T ho can play ten
games of chess simultaneously when blind-
fold, or who can work out instantaneously
and correctly sums that take grown-up
arithmeticians hours of toil and reams of
paper. There are thousands of examples in
history. They appear to pack centuries of
experience into a few seconds, nobody knows
how, and to be born with a faculty that
ordinary people take a lifetime to acquire.
Actually Master Philip seems in one sense
./to be already a full-fledged virtuoso. He has
the usual colossal memory which goes with
the species. To-night (Wednesday) he will
play practically the same sort of programme
as Backhaus used to play. Whether he will
grow into a Backhaus remains to be seen.
On Saturday night, before one of the larg-
est houses that have ever stormed the Audi-
torium, he played Bach, Beethoven, Schu-
bert, Chopin and others in a white shirt,
short pants, socks and black shoes, and with
complete aplomb. He is a nice-looking, in-
telligent boy and he obviously liked doing it.
He forgot his audience when he started
playing an'd only remembered them when he
had finished. He naturally lacked the
strength to give full effect to heavy passages,
and if he plays the greater masters as he
does now when he is thirty it will not be
regarded as remarkable. He rattled through
his Schubert with ease and confidence and
in his Chopin displayed rapidity and control.
Those experienced showmen the Taits are
to be congratulated on their discovery.

For 'their third concert at Sydney Town
Hall the Spivakovsky-Kurtz combination pre-
sented a mixture of music that contained
something to suit almost all tastes. The
concerted number was the Beethoven D
Major Trio, a great but gloomy work into
which has been read by some German com-
mentators an esoteric significance. Piano,
fiddle and ’cello gave the mysterious strains
a dignified presentation. Pianist Jascha
Spivakovsky showed his virtuosity in Liszt’s
B Minor Sonata, and preserved it from its
inherent tendency to slop over. ’Cellist
Kurtz, who mingled Bach. Debussy and
Ravel in his offerings, handles the violin’s
big contralto sister like a master —his tone
brings back memories of Jean Gerardy.
Fiddler Tossy Spivakovsky got. most
applause, and probably he deserved it. He
played Sarasate’s w’himsical embroideries on
Bizet’s rococo “Carmen” music with appreci-
ative gusto.
“Petticoat Influence,” by Neil Grant, pre-
sented at Sydney Savoy on Saturday by
Doris Fitton’s Independent Theatre Players,
came as a disappointment to those whose
expectations, like those of this Showman,
had been raised by the organisation’s mas-
terly presentment of “Precious Bane.”
Saturday evening’s performance was loose
and ragged, and the voice of the prompter
was an almost continual monologue. The
play, which, deals with diplomatic intrigue,
is bright enough. Molly Brown and
Nancy Stuart Gurr acted well; Albert
Collins would have done better if he
had mastered his lines, and Messrs. Wynd-
ham, Dense and Burnell were not in-
spiring. William Hume and Madeline
Oakes filled minor roles capably. Doris Fit-
ton produced, and Don Finley was respon-
sible for the scenery.

Some of Clarkson Rose’s revue work is
very clever, but there is too much of him
in the second edition of “Twinkle,” at Syd-
ney Royal. For one thing, he should not
inflict a barbarous parody on people who
have done him no harm. Nor is there any
need for spoken introductions to turns
which have been heralded on the printed pro-
grammes ; some of these introductions are
long and dull. The show nevertheless has
many bright moments, especially when Olive
Fox, the comedienne, is on the stage. Miss
Fox’s work recalls the great days of the
’halls; she has the gusto of Marie Lloyd
without her vulgarity. Bernardi, the tenor,
sings beautifully, and the Australian ballet
is an increasingly important feature.

The New Sydney Ropertorians celebrated
the first birthday of their Kent-street play-
house on Saturday night. In the first half
of the programme the highest light was a
recitation of a condensed version of Poe’s
“Tell-Tale Heart” by William Rees. A
three-act comedy “Leonara,” in which Edna
Stynes and Arthur Spence distinguished
themselves, wound up the evening.

The Free-Lance Club (Sydney) had a
dramatic evening at the Y.W.C.A. hall last
Thursday, when several short plays written
by members were produced. The best was
a comedy by Jean Wedderspoon. “Masquer-
ade.” Miss Wedderspoon, Charles Saint and
Russell Oakes were the pick of the actors.

Large audiences are being provided twice
daily with two and a half hours of Freud-
ian symbolism by Jim Gerald at Melbourne
Tiv. If the Viennese professor could watch
the reactions of Gerald’s admirers he would
be able to dispense with the unsatisfactory
method of psycho-analysing dreams. All
the phenomena described by Freud are here
manifest in a waking and highly, respectable
audience of right-thinking citizens. The
entrance of the leading comedian reduces
the house to a state of hypnotic trance in
which it is as unconscious of its reflexes as
if it were fast asleep. Mr. Freud gives a
long list of symbols which patients substi-
tute for particular realities in their dreams.
The astute James confines himself to a, rela-
tive few, such as articles of underclothing,'
trousers, bedrooms, babies and the like, as
being more instantly intelligible to a prole-
tarian audience than pagodas, steeples,
zeppelins, serpents and suchlike unusual
things. Gerald elevates what Freud calls
distorted substitution to the rank of a fine
art. There is no word in the English lan-
guage that will not serve his turn and re-
duce his audience to a jelly of shaking
mirth. A sentence as superficially innocent
as a mystery ship, as apparently free from
germs as a" public drinking fountain and
as censor-proof as an Australian news
gazette will produce a state of audience-
hysteria comparable to the fourteenth cen-
tury epidemic of St. Vitus’ dance. James is
not a comedian. He is a natural psycho-
logist, as unconscious as his* audience.

That invincible lady Nellie Bramley is
still in session at Melb. Palace, and a season
that began in gloom and uncertainty is still
in full career in its 57th week, with the end
of the section well around the corner. Miss
Bramley’s latest boon to playgoers is that
ancient bromide, “Tons of Money.” The
Story of the impecunious young man who
comes into a fortune and decides to evade
his creditors by disappearing in a fraudulent
gunpowder explosion is so slender that the
blase critic is apt to stifle his yawns and look
intently at the nearest exit; but after Nellie
lias inadvertently blown up Frith while the
latter is engaged on experiments with high
explosives the fun waxes fast and furious
and the foolishness of the theme is forgot-
ten. As Aubrey Henry Maitland Allington,
Frith shows talents as an actor unsuspected
by those who have witnessed him in a long
succession of musicomedy parts where Frith
was Frith and the character he was supposed
to be portraying didn’t matter. Associa-
tion with Nellie, who is an excellent actress,
if overprone to make obvious appeals to the
gallery, has apparently done the ex-farce
merchant good. “Married and How” is the
duo’s vehicle this week.

The season of Gregan McMahon’s fine pro-
duction of “Too True to Be Good” was twice
extended at Melb. Garrick.
The Palette.
Milos Evergood, an Australian painter
who for the last 30 years or so has resided
abroad, has a show of his oils, water-colors and
pencil drawings at the Argosy Gallery, Sydney.
The gallery is small, the pictures are glassed
and Mr. Evergood’s style is broad. So far
as can honestly he judged in the circum-
stances some of his landscapes and still-life
studies are very effective compositions.
Some of them are catalogued as “unfinished,”
hut at close range they all look like that.
A picture entitled “Blue Vase (Dynamic
Symmetary)” seems to be intended to have
metaphysical significance. Present critic
caught no mystic message, but noted with
deep appreciation that the vase was sym-
metrical, a thing that seldom happens when
vases are drawn by impressionistic painters.
Six craftsmen of the chisel contribute to
the sculpture exhibition at Melb. Fine Arts.
With the exception of the late Bertram
McKennal’s one-man show in 1926 it is
the first bf its kind ever held in Melbourne.
All but a few of Ola Cohn’s pieces belong
to the Back-to-the-Congo movement. No. 66,
“The Witch,” who has a third eye in her
forehead, is a startling bit of illustration.
W. Leslie Bowles, A.R.8.5., is more ortho-
dox. His “Louis McCubbin. Esq..” is an
excellent likeness, but most of his work has
the irritating effect of having been seen in
line instead of mass. George Allen is a
modernist, inasmuch as he interprets human
beings in terms of the machine. His “Garden
Group” (cement) might have been conceived
by a motor-car designer, but his -bas-relief,
“The Race,” carries more of the suggestion
of violent motion than anything which deco-
rates the Shrine of Remembrance. Wallace
Anderson’s fat baby (No. 21) is crude but
unpretentious. Rodin, the greatest of modern
sculptors, summed up sculpture as “the art
of the hole and the lump.” Orlando Dutton
comes nearest to realising Rodin’s dictum.
His “A V.A.D.” and the pleasing “Head of
a Girl” may be a trifle too highly finished,
but they definitely suggest that he had
human beings in front of him instead of a
set of rules and regulations.
“D.E.P.”: The pictures by contemporary
British artists exhibited at the Blaxland
Galleries by Mrs. Allyne Zander are a
mixed bag. Many of the works are
familiar through reproduction in various art
journals, and it is often surprising to see how
little the originals are like the pictures we
conjured from those reproductions. Drapes,
which we pictured as glowing crimson turn
out to be green, rich browns and blacks
become pink and scarlet, green cabbages
change to purple, and so on. It is interest-
ing to see how the Lambert, a self-portrait
of the artist in Palestine, holds its own with
the modern English school. The exhibits
run the gamut from the near-sublime, John’s
“Canadian Soldier” and Phillip Connard’s
“Bayswater,” to the pointless-ridiculous, Ben
Nicholson’s “Fireworks” ; in between are an
excellent baby by Dod Proctor, an interest-
ing landscape by Tasmanian Derwent Lees,
atmospheric stuff by Nevinson and some de-
lectable little waves by William. Nicholson.
The Epstein bronzes are disappointingly ex-
cellent, particularly the study of the two
children. The etchings, engravings and draw-
ings show us a few points in technique and
craftsmanship. It seems a pity that no capi-
tals could be found for words like Melbourne,
Sydney and British on the cover of the
catalogue.
Vie. Salon of Photography is holding a
show of international camera pictures at
Melb. Athenaeum. An enormous number of
them hail from the vicinity of Hollywood,
which might be described as the Holy City
of the bulb-pressers; but there are also
Indians, Czechs, South Africans —in fact,
almost every nationality. The fast lens has
outed the old method of taking portraits,
when you put your head inside a yyce and
were told to look pleasant for an indefinite
period. The most interesting studies are
those in which the cameraman hasn’t
attempted to be self-consciously artistic. A
Knapp, Perth’s veteran photographer, sends
two effective pictures, and one of the finest
cityscapes, by W. Howieson, shows the
pseudo-Gothic pile of the Manchester Unity
building looming over Swanston-street.
Ralph Rex, of St. Louis, Mo., might be
classed as a modernist. His sole exhibit is a
heap of old chains, which at first glance could
as easily be taken for a string of sausages.
Frank Crozier, who rusticates at War-
randyte, brings a considerable amount of
rural charm to the metropolis in 27 oils at
Everyman’s, Melbourne. A large cartoon,
also in oils, shows Warrandyte in 2033. The
air is full of flying machines and a soldier
with fixed bayonet is guarding the sole re-
maining wattle-tree. It is a wonder the work
was not censored by the local Progress Asso-
ciation.
Roy Parkinson has received advice that
a number of his water-colors which were
recently sent to the U.S.A. have, been well
received by the critics. The pictures in-
clude studies of the Australian bush, with
gum-trees figuring prominently, and also a
sketch of jacarandas; these have created
great interest in Yankeeland.
Tired orthodoxy is the keynote of most
of Melbourne’s recent art shows. . Gladys
Owen exhibited some water-color views. of
Europe and Sydney in which convention
is insistent. In some of his paintings of
Sydney Harbor Robert Campbell shows con-
sideration for the susceptibilities of Melbourne
by emitting the bridge. In all of these
pictures the hand is the hand of Campbell
but the voice is very much like the voice
of Streeton. None of them says anything
new, blit they speak in a familiar language,
and there were red tabs on. a good half of
them when present critic visited the gallery.
“F.S.”: When Australian art-lovers look
at some of the examples of modern painting
they wonder how reputations are created.
There is one fairly simple explanation. A
Melbourne painter who held a show in Paris
received letters from several of the art re-
views—and by no means obscure ones,
informing him that if he ordered 20 copies
of their publication they would print a favor-
able criticism of his work, together with
some reproductions. If he objected to. this,
they said, he could write, his own criticism
or get a friend to write it and they would
print it. Another Melbourne painter had
several similar experiences in London. These
faked appreciations are repeated on the
boulevards and copied in other journals and
the artist finds himself famous. Add to this
the undoubted fact that dealers buy up
the whole output of unknown painters and
then deliberately boost them, and that the
average art-lover is quite directionless, and
the mystery looks less of a mystery.
“Cauboy”: Melbourne learnt to' its aston-
ishment the other day that Theo and Mrs.
Shall are still with it. The Viennese is to
be the star performer in a local company
which has obtained a lease of the new Gar-
rick. When the McMalionites have the stage
the Stallites will go on tour. Viennese com-
edies will be Mr. Shall’s specialty. The
manager of the new organisation, L. B.
Politzer, has had a picturesque career.
Twenty years ago he owned a.cafe in Collms-
street which earned the adjective “Bohemian
because it was frequented by artists, not
known to fame, who were then so hard up
that they used to pay for their meals with
pictures. Politzer called his cafe theßoule
vard. Mirror of Continental Life, but the
sight of this sign decorating the principal thor-
oughfare of the most moral capital in Aus-
tralia so shocked the city fathers that they
compelled him to remove it. The Boule-
vard occupied a basement next to tne pre-
sent “Age” office, and its walls were deco-
rated by Leason. Virgil and the French artist
Louis Foulet, who later lost both legs at
Verdun.

SHADOW SHOWS.
A more suitable title for “Rasputin and
the Empress” at the St. James’s would have
been “Yankees at the Court of Czar
Nicholas.” The American accents range
from So’thern to Bowery. Ethel Barrymore
doesn’t resemble the austerely beautiful
Empress, but she sounds like a cultivated
woman; one of her daughters has an agree-
able American, voice, and a younger one has
the rasping accent of a Yankee vaudeville
child. Lionel Barrymore, as the oafish
peasant Rasputin, talks as if lie belonged
to the same social class as the Empress.
He portrays a hairy old pantaloon who
spends much of his time chasing girls. The
scenes in which he overcomes Diana Wyn-
yard (Princess Natasha), and then hypno-
tises her so that he may wreak his lust on
the flapper Gra,nd Duchess Marie, would be
funny if they weren’t revolting. He exploits
all the mannerisms in this part that he did
in previous film parts, but he is such a good
actor that his obscene goings-on appear more
or less credible. John Barrymore—who is
also the John Barrymore of previous films
—plays Prince Chegodieff; “Paul” to the
Royal Family, whose intimate friend he is.
He presumably kills Rasputin later on, but
this critic was too bored with this dreary
re-hash of an oft-told tale to wait for the
happy dispatch. When the said critic left
Rasputin was still acting the moron on the
home front, and the Czar (Ralph Morgan)
had entrained for his military h.q. after a
farewell scene with' Ethel Barrymore which
couldn’t have been more agonising if hq had
been bound for the front line. The most
interesting features of the film are the
photography and the elaborate settings and
dresses, but for the reasons given above they
never create the illusion aimed at. It is
strange that Hollywood should persist in
these travesties on European Court life, but
not so strange as that Australian exhibitors
should be willing to import them.

The Regent has an enormous bill, as usual,
After some interesting shorts “Humanity”
proceeds to give medical ethics the boost of
a lifetime. Doctors, we learn, are like Test
cricketers; they put the game before the
prize. Ralph Morgan, as Dr. Macdonald,
senior, has spent years curing the poor
for nothing. His doctor son Bill (Alex-
ander Kirkland) is persuaded by a vamp-
isk Society girl to desert the family slum
for a quax-ter where the patients are in a
position to pay. Some of them are gang-
sters. In the U.S.A. a doctor who attends
a wounded gangster is obliged to report to
the police. Young Bill omits to do so, and
when the inevitable trouble with the heads
of his profession arises, Bill, Sr., nobly takes
the blame and opportunely dies —but not
before he has had the pleasure of learning
that Bill, Jr., has seen the error of his
ways, and is resolved to throw up his Park
Av. practice, and ditch selfish Irene Ware,
and live an upright life as benefactor to the
proletariat with winsome Boots Mallory. The
acting is uniformly sound, and there’s a sniff
in almost every line.
“Hot Peppex*” is as cynical as “Humanity”
is sentimental; as uproarious as “Humanity”
is quiet; as naughty as “Humanity” is
moral. In short, it is another McLaglen-
Lowe film with Lupe Velez to pxxrvide the
nudity sequences. McLaglen owns terraces
of speakeasies and a fleet of rum boats. To
him comes the unscrupulous Lowe intent on
plunder. McLaglen is made a fool of in
various ways, and his bellows of anguish
when he realises that he has been done
again cause the audience to bellow with
mirth as in past films. El Brendel, as Mc-
Laglen’s idiot chauffeur, also gets laughs
every time he opens his mouth. The action
shifts inconsequently from New York to
Paris and on to China, and the settings are
uniformly realistic,
* # #
A dangerous innovation has been intro-
duced into “Fighting for Justice,” Sydney
Haymarket’s current Western. Before win-
ning back the family ranch, Tim McCoy
drags Joyce Compton’s bolting horse-team
to a standstill. And she was merely racing
them: they weren’t running away with her
at all! If this kind of thing is allowed we
will next have Tim riding his white, tail-
flaunting mustang into Deadman Gulch and
shooting down the leering sheriff, only to
discover that he should have exterminated
the parson.
“The Crooked Lady” is an English mys-
tery film. Who is the crooked lady? The
picture doesn’t say. The plot concerns a
demobbed captain (Austin Trevor), down and
out, but almost certainly not a crooked lady,
though he does turn to crime at the sugges-
tion of his Cockney ex-batman. This Cockney
(Alexander Field) might be the lady, but
he seems to be there for no other purpose
than to supply the c-omic relief. The only
other criminal is Garstin (Edmund Willard).
I here are two ladies in it: Miss Sinclair
Usobel Elsom), whose priceless pearls the
captain pinches, only to return them and
reform when lie discovers she is his ex-
majors widow; and Miss Collinson (Ursula
Jeans), a detective. Neither is crooked
or e Y l “ n dinted. The captain retires to the
country and becomes a successful writer of
crime stones. Garstin and Miss Collinson,
cach seekmg' him from different motives,
f n ru X e ® epara i® ly out. He returns
, , 1S ? Collinson trom the
Aa. tanlly attentions ot Garstin.
Herbert Marshall and Marlene Dietrich
are the principals in “The Blonde Venus,”
at the Empire. The lady sacrifices a music-
hall career for Mr. Marshall, a struggling
scientist. His health fails and to raise
enough to send him abroad she returns to
the footlights. Enter Cary Grant, man
about town. Herbert learns of the affair,
orders her out of his life and secures their
offspring. Does she starve in the gutter and
come crawling back through the snow in the
sable cloak of repentance? Par from it.
She goes to Paris, recaptures her pre-nuptial
fame, and returns in a blaze of glory. The
bringing together of his parents by little
Dickie Moore is the only vestige of the old
melodramatic order.
Stuart Erwin is the star of “He Learned
About Women.” He has spent his adoles-
cence pottering around libraries. Suddenly
he comes into a fortune. In Yurrup jobless
girls are being- sold at auction. H'e invests in
a typist (Susan Fleming) and an ex-actress
(Alison Skipworth), and instals them in his
mansion. They set out to fleece him. Then a
go-getter gets wind of the human goldmine
and turns up with one of Alison’s early hus-
bands. And now Love enters Susan’s virgin
heart, and she enlists her feminine wit on the
side-of justice. The 70-odd minutes of tom-
foolery end with a stirring battle between
the male crooks and Erwin and an army of
soup-kitchen loafers. The acting is lively,
and Saturday night’s audience obviously
found the proceedings amusing,

Im-ho-tep, high priest of an ancient Egyp-
tian temple, falls in love with a virgin
priestess of Isis ; slie dies, but his love is
so' great that he dares to steal, from the
gods the Scroll of Thoth with which he can
resuscitate the young woman. He is dis-
covered, embalmed alive and buried with the
scroll. Such is the position when “The
Mummy” (Sydney Capitol) opens. The
mummy is inadvertently restored to life when
the tomb is opened over 3000 years later. His
love remains, and again he attempts to bring
the priestess back to life. Discovering, how-
ever, that her soul has been re-created in a
modern girl, he attracts her to him, and has
persuaded her to suffer death for his sake
when she is rescued by her lover. Boris
Karloff plays Im-ho-tep and Zita Johann is
the girl. An unusual film with a great part
for Karloff.
CITY MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE
SOCIETY, LTD.
54th ANNUAL MEETING
CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH.
The fifty-fourth Annual Meeting of the
above Society was held at the Head Office,
Hunter and Bligh Streets, on April 19, the
Chairman, Mr. George Crowley, presiding.
In moving the adoption of the Report,
Mr. Crowley said:—
In moving the adoption of the Fifty-
fourth Annual Report I think that, con-
sidering everything, the Society’s achieve-
ments for the year are highly satisfactory.
It has been a fairly anxious time for most
Financial Institutions in Australia. We are
so dependent upon overseas conditions, and
these have been anything but settled during
the year.
The market for our staple products has
been dislocated, the result being that local
dislocation took place in Australia. Sources
of income were dried up, and taxation, both
direct and indirect, seemed to be the only
evergreen.
Still, the Directors are happy to express
the opinion that they see daylight at the
end of the tunnel. If there can only be that
spirit of unity which characterised the Aus-
tralian people in previous trials there is no
question that we shall be out of our troubles
in an. appreciably quick time.
The main anxiety of every Mutual Life
Office is the safety of the funds of the
Policyholders. They have denied them-
selves for the benefit of their families, and
the investment of their funds has always
been a matter of deep concern.
It has been the practice of some Aus-
tralian Offices to invest the bulk of their
assets in Government Stock. There was,
as a matter of fact, keen competition
amongst two or three of them as to which
should lead the list of contributors. The
City Mutual Board, convinced that Aus-
tralia was borrowing much too freely and
spending much too lavishly and much too
unwisely, discouraged the practice by every
means in its power, both by advice and ac-
tion. Government Stock, however, seemed
on the face of it to be most immune from
fluctuation and interference.
It was found necessary a year or two
ago to reduce the rate of Interest from 6
per cent, to 4 per cent. It was also found
imperative to subject this income to Federal
Taxation, It is hard to say at present
whether some attempt will not be made in
the near future to still further reduce the
Interest rate to 3 per cent, or under, on the
plea that Australia’s burden is intolerable,
and that, as taxation point has been more
than reached, the redress will have to be in
some reduction of the principal sum.
A fairly large proportion of this Society’s
investments, almost 50 per cent., is in first
mortgage securities, carefully selected by the
Society’s trained officers.
That has been the policy of the City
Mutual for the past 40 years, and it has
been, on the whole, eminently successful.
Many thousands of thrifty people were
enabled to build their own homes, and, hav-
ing borrowed the money, were encouraged
to repay the amount by regular instalments
of principal and interest.
The additional protection of a Life As-
surance Policy during the period, in case of
the premature death of the breadwinner,
was in most cases availed of with satisfac-
tion to the policyholder and with profit to
the institution.
It was a consummation of the highest
principles of life assurance and, from the
viewpoint of the Society’s policyholders,
the record bonuses added year by year were
the best evidence of its success.
A fairly large proportion of the Society’s
present mortgages still represents this class
of business and, although the values, natu-
rally, have shrunk during the past few years,
the amount owing year by year has dimin-
ished as .well, ,
This class of business was satisfactory
from every point of view, both that of the
borrower and that of the Society. But, un-
fortunately, a few years ago came stupid
Government interference.
Instead of applications for loans being
granted on a safety margin of 40 per cent,
or 50 per cent., which was the Society’s in-
evitable custom, the Government of the
day freely offered loans with the dan-
gerously unsound margin of only 10 per
cent.
And what is more, having no income
tax to pay, either State or Federal, the
Government was able to undercut the City
Mutual and similar institutions by charging
a very low rate of interest, which left prac-
tically no margin of profit.
It would be, perhaps, a valuable object
lesson—if legislators are ever willing to
learn anything—as a guide for the future
to ascertain what loss has been sustained by
the people of the State in this ill-advised
venture.
The board, when considering its attitude
towards the distribution of the available
surplus as at the 31st December last, decided
to call for reports from its responsible
officers as to what reserves, if any, would
be desirable to protect the policyholders’
funds against any possible loss which might
arise in the realisation of the amount in-
vested in mortgage securities. After care-
ful examination, advice was received that
the Society’s present disclosed reserves are
more than ample to cover every possible
contingency that is likely to arise in the
future.
A BONUS FOR WOOL AND WHEAT.
I have for many years at these meetings
expressed strongly held views of what I
considered would be the best course for
Australia to adopt under the circumstances
existing at the time.
Australia’s stability has been largely de-
pendent on its export market. We are, in
the main, a primary-producing country. We
grow more than we need for ourselves,
and, until two or three years ago, our main
staples, wool and wheat, found a ready
world market at satisfactory prices.
Now, that is for the time being changed.
The prices we are able to obtain in the
world’s market scarcely pay for the cost of
production.
I say, with all earnestness, that indecision
and inactivity at the present time are dan-
gerous to the best interests of the Common-
wealth.
It might cost fifty millions a year to pay
the woolgrower and the wheat-farmer a
price which would enable them to keep
their heads above water. I should certainly
pay it for a couple of years, until the tur-
moil at the other end of the world is over.
For it will be over, let us make no mistake
about it, within that time, and matters
again get back to normality. That has been
the experience of centuries, and the world
is no less wise to-day that it was a hundred
years ago.
It is a matter for men with practical
knowledge to say what should be the price
level.
Even if it adds a hundred million pounds
to Australia’s debt, the value to Australia
can hardly be over-estimated. The issue
of wheat certificates and wool certificates
with banking negotiability will prevent any
undue expansion of credit, and the salutary
effect to the nation would be inestimable.
For one thing, it would mean a restoration
of confidence all round, which is what is
needed above all things at present, and it
would also mean a very material shrinkage
of unemployment, which is such a hindrance
to our advancement.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.
I sometimes think it would be a good
thing if we Australians occasionally detached
ourselves from the rest of the world arid
did a little quiet thinking.
I was reading the other day where a man
woi-king a machine —a triumph of modern
scientific development—was able to turn out
in one hour an amount of work previously
done by a hundred men in six hours.
Just think of it.
In a week—for the machine does not tire
—work is accomplished which previously re-
quired the services of a hundred men, and
probably those of an overseer or two as
well.
What a saving! Ah, yes, but what a
tragic disaster as well. Ninety-nine men
thrown on the scrap-heap, themselves and
their families.
Now, the jargon of the extremist—-for the
capitalist extremist is even a greater
nuisance and menace than his Communist
contemporary, and that is saying a lot—is
“the survival of the fittest.” The law of
the jungle.
The Nation must be the gainer by this
economy of labour, and to the Nation
surely these ninety-nine men and their fami-
lies are reasonably entitled, pending utilisa-
tion of their services in some other capacity,
to look . for sustenance without being
branded as “dole recipients.”
To my mind, there is nothing clearer,
and I am sure most thinking Australians
will agree.
UNITY ESSENTIAL.
It is a difficult and thankless task in these
stressful times to offer suggestions.
For nearly half a century I have been a
close observer of events —with never a tie
to any political party.
It is only fair to say that the men at the
head of affaix-s in Australia to-day are in
the main actuated by the motive,
the alleviation of distress and the augmen-
tation of the happiness of all their fellow-
Australians.
It is of vital importance to the Common-
wealth that we should be able to convert
our oversea obligations at a cheaper rate
than that which we are now paying.
And it is, therefore, in the highest degree
unfortunate that, at this juncture, when
matters for the first time in three years are
really beginning to look brighter, responsible
leaders of public thought in the community
should openly advocate a policy of universal
confiscation and universal disruption.
There can be no question about it that
the knowledge of this attitude being adopted
by a party which may quite conceivably
be in power in a couple of years was mainly
responsible for the recent failure of the
Conversion Loan in England.
Inflammatory talk of this nature should
be sternly discouraged. Confiscation and
disruption would, as they have done all
over the world wherever tried throughout
the ages, hit hardest the unfortunate people
on or under the bread line.
To quote from that eminent economist,
Sir Arthur Salter, in a recent remarkable
production of his, “Recovery”:—
“To di-ift into either chaos or Communism
is to fail in the specific task of our age,
Which is to reform —perhaps to transform—
the civilisation we know, not to destroy it
in despair at its defects, in hopes of we
know not what. A new civilisation might
indeed ultimately emerge—but it will not
be ours; and who can foresee after what
intervening disaster?”
By a universal recognition of the inescap-
able fact that sacrifices are needed and
must be willingly and cheerfully borne, Aus-
tralia will overcome its difficulties and lead
the way in world recovery.
The resolution was seconded by the
deputy chairman, Mr. G. E. Bryant, and
was adopted by the meeting.
The retiring directors and auditors were
re-elected, and the meeting closed with the
usual vote of thanks.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Hula”: My mate and I were holding up
the counter of the pub in Aloresby on one
of the hottest days last March, when in
strolled Old Bill. Bill had been prospect-
ing alone in the head-hunters’ bush, and
hadn’t seen a newspaper for months. “Well,
lads, what’s the latest news?” he inquired.
“Not much,” drawled the mate, “except that
America and Russia have joined in the fight
with the Japs and Chows, England’s scrap-
ping Persia, Lang’s still out and W.A.’s”
“Gripes! tell us somethin’ new,” interrupted
Old Bill. “That’s all been on the cards fer
a devil of a time. What’s this new barmaid
like?”
* * * *
“P.M.”: Another back-to-the-land move-
ment. I saw him on Warragul (Vic.) rail-
way station the other night, dressed in a
ragged shirt, dungaree pants, old sandshoes
arid half a felt hat. “Where’s the blankety-
blank bookin’ office?” he demanded, swag-
gering up to a porter. “Right here, lad.”
the porter replied. “Where do you want to
go?” “Back to the blanky boys at the
Lake Tyers abo. station,” was the reply.
“I’ve been three days in your blanky big city
of Warragul, and I’m off again to the
blanky bush!”
* * * *
“Pickwick”: Here’s a bit of horse-lore I
haven’t seen in print. One of my mares had
trouble at the birth of her first foal and, after
helping the youngster into the light of day,
we stood by talking for a few minutes. It
was then I noticed that each hoof had
five small fleshy stumps, something like a
human baby’s fingers. Even as we watched
they were slowly closing, and in a few days
they had healed into the foot.
* * * ❖
“Wobey” : Here’s a legend from the con-
struction days of the southern part of the
Transcontinental railway. A platelayer named
Smith died of sunstroke, and the ganger,
a stickler for propriety, made for the near-
est telegraph depot and wired headquarters
for permission to bury him. H'.Q. replied:
“Permission to bury Smith granted, but
make sure he is dead.” To which the ganger
replied: “Smith buried. Alade sure he was
dead. Hit him twice on head with fishplate.”
* * * *
“Hugh G.” : Of all vocations rattler-jump-
ing is the least easy. Unlike his predecessor
the swaggie, the modern nomad wants to get
somewhere —and, when he gets there, to go
somewhere else, usually as far away from
his present location as the railway and police
will permit. As an instance of the distance
covered by these Vanderdeckens of the track,
a fellow who presented his ration card
recently at Gyrnpie is worthy of mention. He
walked, in all his sooty glory, into the police
station at about four o’clock in the after-
noon. The sergeant took his card ; it was
stamped “Cairns” the previous week. “Do
you jump trains?” asked the sergeant. “No,”
replied the applicant. “Walk?” said the
cop sarcastically. “Yair,” said the sooty one
with a cheerful grin. The sergeant pitched
him his card. “Get going,” he said; “you’ll
be in Brisbane by sundown.” On one occa-
sion I jumped from Cairns to Brisbane in
nine days, and I don’t think I had 12 hours’
sleep in that time, what with waiting up for
rattlers, sometimes missing them, and the
time spent actually on the journey. Bur
that was a modest performance. In Bris-
bane “Snowy” received word that his mother
was ill. Leaving his swag in that city, by
jumping the mails he landed home in Mel-
bourne. spent a week there and was back
in Brisbane within three weeks.
“Dai R.”: Some strange footwear is seen
on the roads these days. An old chap I
met had replaced the worn-out soles of his
bluchers with neatly-cut galvanised-iron
ones, w-hich he had laced to the uppers with
copper wire. Inside he wore three thick-
nesses of felt cut from an old hat, picked up
on a municipal tip. He told me they were
“bonzer for walkin’ in.” Felt moccasins are
common, as also are those made from sheep-
skin (woolly side in) and layers of old tar-
paulin, while matilda-waltzers with one white
and one black' (or brown) shoe or boot are
an everyday sight. I have heard about a chap
who tramps round in two kippered-lierring
tins, but I think the man who told me that
had the dry horrors.
* ❖ * *
“Raeakiaki” : I claim to be one of the few
pakelias living who have heard a tamed tui
talking fluent Maori. A male bird —the female
rarely, if, ever, makes a good talker —he was
owned by a tattooed old chief living at a
lcainga behind Lake Waikaremoana, and was
so tame that he was caged only at night.
The tui ■ could deliver a dozen sentences in
Maori with great rapidity and it was diffi-
cult to distinguish his chatter from a
OH, THESE WOMEN!
“Jacky, what did you turn your poor old wife out for?"
“Oh, she bin gettern too pflash. Wantem build wind-break.”
human’s voice. The hairlike appendages of
the tongue had been neatly trimmed so as
to enlarge the glottis. His education had
taken ten months, and he had picked up
words very slowly, the old chief monoton-
ously repeating sentences and single words
to him for hours 1 at a time. At the end of
seven months, when he’d caught the knack
of the Maori lingo, his progress proceeded
rapidly, but he memorised no more than
the sentences I heard him rattle off two
years later.

“Jessamine Creek”: That yarn about the
drover who was carried into the middle of
Winton (C.Q.) by a mob of bullocks that
had rushed (B. 26/4/’33) seems a bit far-
fetched. Still, it recalls a happening in
which a parson acquaintance of mine figured.
We were aiming for Winton in a buggy when
we were overtaken by rain and hopelessly
bogged in the flat plain country approaching
the town. We camped for the night, but
early in the morning a roaring westerly
blew up, taking before it the parson’s
clothes, which he had hung under the buggy
to dry. It was just daylight, and in spite
of the cold he jumped from the blankets
and pursued his clothes, which soon reached
Winton and careered up the main street. The
shepherd was gaining and there was not a soul
about, so he persevered. Just as he fell on
his prey with a triumphant shout, the town
burst into life; the streets were filled as
if by magic with wondering inhabitants. He
had captured his clothing at the precise
instant when the pubs open and every citi-
zen springs automatically from his bed.
* * * *
“Kickero” : A Darwin jury made a pecu-
liar recommendation for mercy ip a recent
murder case. A lubra, known to the whites
as Alice and to her people as Mebong, had
as rivals for her favors a white dingo-poisoner,
William Tetlow. and an abo. named Jimmy
or Nallayarra. The abo. and Tetlow went out
together shooting geese. Mebong heard a
shot and, rushing out of Tetlow’s tent, found
him on the ground. “My bin losem brain,
shootem —wantum shoot you too,” said
Jimpiy. The other blacks kept the girl in
camp, as they feared trouble, but one night
she escaped and, crossing the river in a
canoe, brought the police to where the mur-
derod man’s body lay. Jimmy explained to
Constable Pryor that “gun was cranky fol-
low. Went off himself.” He had left the
body near a billabong, “as plenty alligator
there. They smell him and take him away.”
At the trial the jury made a recommenda-
tion for mercy on tiie ground that Tetlow
had contributed to his death by walking
ahead of an aboriginal carrying a gun. Most
old bushmen will see reason in it.
* * * *
“Sherwood”: Having had some curious ex-
periences with firearms myself. I am not
going to cast doubts on “Larrapinta’s” story
(B. 26/4/’33) of how he enlarged the cham-
ber of his rifle and the tumbler chambers of
his revolver with a: reamer made in the wilds
out of a steel rasp, forged into' shape on the
back of an axe with a knapping hammer.
But it must have been a difficult job. ’ To
forge the rasp into shape it would have to
be heated. The heating would destroy the
hardness of the metal.' and a reamer has to
be dashed hard. Similarly the rifle-chamber
steel is as hard as a diamond when it leaves
the maker’s hands, and if it were heated
like the rasp distortion would have to be
corrected and anew hardening process under-
taken somehow or other. Just as well, per-
haps, “Larrapinta” had not to fire that rifle
at the cacophonous myalls. It is odds on he
would have been the principal casualty.
“Ivooragai”: The beautiful Sturt pea,
whose peculiar-shaped purple and black
blooms bedizen the Darling country after
heavy rains, is noted for the vitality of its
seed. In places where not a specimen had
been seen for years and it w T as thought that
the desert gem had died out, a soaking rain
has been followed by the appearance of
numerous plants. The seeds have been
known to lie dormant lor 20 years and then
spring into life. This plant, now more
popularly known as clianthus (from the
botanic name, Clianthus dampierri) , was first
discovered by D. J. Harris Browne and not
•by Captain Sturt, as is generally supposed.
Dr. Browne, who died in 1904, was. the last
surviving member of Sturt’s inland expedi-
tion in 1844; he was a pioneer pastoralist
of South Aus., his home’ station being situ-
ated near Alt. Gambier. Alt. Browne,
beyond Alilparinka (N.S.AY.), is named after
him. In the same neighborhood are Alt.
Sturt and Alt. Poole, the latter named after
the second-in-command of the expedition,
who died there in 1845.
“Bluewing” : New York Zoo is finding out
what those in charge of many Australian
Botanical Gardens knew long ago—that the
wild duck, wariest and shiest of birds,
quickly discovers that there are places where
he is not only safe from enemies but is sure
of a free supply of food. The New York
institution has its regular contingent of visi-
tors from outside.; they are fed because they
prove an attraction. But within the last year
or so hordes of real brumbies, flying south
from the Canadian winter, have discovered
the good thing and are breaking their jour-
ney in such numbers that the food supply
cannot be kept up to them. It is impossible
to pick out the Zoo habitues from the ducks
that are just muscling in, and while the
management is trying to think of a way
out the tucker bills are mounting.

“Clio”: A giant spider, known in the
household as Alexander the Great, spun his
web just outside a ver-
andah window. He
worked at night, spin-
ning rapidly and uncon-
cernedly in the glare
of an electric lamp,
and usually had an
audience of interested
nature students watch-
ing his method of
weaving, and marvel-
ling at the dexterity of
his legs. As we were
assured by a spiderolo-
gist that Alexander
was harmless and un-
addicted to any but the
outdoor life, we left
him in peace, and pre-
sently discovered him
to be a wonderful
weather gauge. On
calm nights he would
spin slowly arid
thoughtfully, and the
finished web would be
a thing of beauty.
That m o a n t fine
weather. When Alex-
ander didn’t spin at all
it meant storm of rain,
and when one still
evening we saw him
suddenly’ begin to dash
round, unravelling'and
rapidly absorbing his
web,, we prepared for
the furious blow that

There were evenings
when Alexander left
his web hanging in a
disgraceful state, of
disrepair. This never
failed to indicate that

“The _ Lurcher”; Here’s an old English
poacher’s trick for catching a hare by hand
which is guaranteed to save the catcher from
■the casualties described by “Arebee” (B.
26/4/'33)v Instead of hiding behind a
,tree for the hare to gallop past, spot puss
on her form in the grass. Then, from 50
yards out, walk round the seated animal in
casual fashion, gradually lessening the radius
of the circle. If this is properly done the
hare will sit fast until the walker is almost
on top of her. Then, from behind, grab
swiftly with one hand, grasping the quarry
across the loins ; and the first stage of Mrs.
Beeton’s jugged-hare recipe has been passed.
“Sithee”: Touching the recumbent pro-
cesses of elephants (B. 19/ A /! 33). Kipling,
who had plenty of opportunities in India for
studying the beast at close range, besides
having Mulvaney and Ortlioris to consult
upon their habits and customs, writes some-
where that the elephant’s allowance of sloej
or rest is four hours per night. And In
takes two of them on each side.

“Cou”: We are often told that “goanna”
is a corruption of “iguana.” An old natural-
history book I possess says “goanna” is the
Singalese name for the common Indian water
lizard (Monitor dracama). The natives of
Ceylon and Southern India eat the goanna;
in taste, size and habits it very much re-
sembles our own monitor. It is thus pro-
bable that the name originally came from
India per camel-driver or remount valet, and
that the bushman has been speaking more
correctly than the professor. Originally this
species was dubbed monitor from an alleged
habit of warning people of the aplprbach of
crocodiles. Really the two reptiles live quite
amicably together.

“Plankton” :■ The giants of the spider arid
scorpion class ( Araclmida ) have no stings
or poison-claws, and are actually' marine
creatures. Fewer than half a dozen species
frequent shallow tropic seas, and'TacHypleus
gigas (commonly referred to as the “pan-
fish” or “saucepan-crab”) ranges from Singa-
pore to Torres Strait. The greater part of
Taclbypleus is protected by a large glossy
shield, roughly resembling half a large in-
verted saucer, with three simple eyes on its
surface. A smaller armored segment attached
behind is bordered with short movable spines;
and extending to the rear is a long, tapering,
rigid tail-spine, jointed at its base. The four
pairs of legs and the mandibles on the under-
side of the animal are all armed with pincers.
The gills are very similar-in ; structure to
rhe “lung-books” of spiders and scorpions.
BAD LUCK.
HORSESELLER: “I’d keep him if I could afford to — he’s almost human.”
UUNLIKELY BUYER: “What a pity he missed by a bit!—he’d have been getting the
pension for you if he’d been a man.”
Progression is usually effected by elevating
the hind part of the body and depressing the
tail-spine; these parts are next straightened,
causing the body to slide forward against the
resistance offered by the pointed tail im-
bedded in the ocean-bed. The creature can
also move by a series of short “swimming”
hops. The cleanliness of these crustaceans
is notable, no barnacles or other marine
growths appearing on their shells. Perhaps
they groom each other.

“M.L.C.”: The magpie-lark or mudlark,
with its smart black-and-white suit, should
be always welcomed as one of the farmer’s
best friends. It may be frequently seen in
marshy ground hunting for its favorite deli-
cacy-—the water snail that acts as host for the
liver-fluke parasite. The mudlark is one of
the four native birds that build their nests
of mud; the other three are the welcome
swallow, the white-winged chough and the
fairy martin or bottle swallow. The last-
named constructs a curious bottle-shaped
excrescence which juts out horizontally from
a cliff and must be of marvellous strength
to withstand the strain of wind and weather
and nestling's. These birds have a sociable
habit of building close together in colonies
of perhaps hundreds. Observers swear that
the nest-building is performed in a com-
munity spirit by a group of birds that con-
struct the entire colony—certainly the art
seems to demand the skill of a trained beak.

“Lagarto”: There is no need for “S.D.” to
froth at the mouth because Australians refer
to their crocodiles as “alligators” (B.
26/4/’33). They do so just as they call the
koala a bear, the dasyures native cats, Tas-
manian tigers and Tasmanian devils, and the
echidna a porcupine—following the custom of
their forebears, who tacked on to the animals
the Old World titles which seemed most appro-
priate. In any case the pukka alligator has
a much wider range than “the southern
States of the U.S.A. and China.” He is
plentiful in some of the West Indies and
far down South America, where he is known
as cayman or jacarta. No doubt, as “S.D.”
says, it is easy to distinguish the alligator
from the crocodile by the teeth, but at
close quarters with either there is usually
little time for zoological research.
“Geoloin”: Other animals will behave as
strangely as “Rokko’s” bulldog (B.
19/4/’B3) in the absence of familiar
sights and smells. Tramping along the
railway line towards Gladstone (Q.)
we saw a lengthsman’s wife in trouble with
, her milking cow, which could not be induced
to bail up. We tried' to help, but only-
made the r cow—and the woman —wilder.
She explained that - her husband always
milked the cow and had no difficulty, but he
had gone to town that day. My mate had
a brain-wave. “Put on your husband’s coat
and hat, and give it another spin.” She did.
The cow bailed up and was milked without
any more obstreperousness.

“Mulyan”: On outback cricket grounds
the twelfth man has more duties than car-

match at Harwood Island Clarence River

twelfth man out with a waddy. Then a
fielder, trying to stop a boundary hit, grabbed
a snake instead of the ball.* The latter
had rolled on to the reptile in the grass, and
it reared almost into the fielder’s hand.
While the wriggler was being killed the ball
was forgotten and the batsmen ran six.

“Wainui”: The old-time Maoris, though
they lived mainly for battle, had no initi-
atory ceremonies for boys' such as are to
be found among practically all other Poly-
nesian and Australian natives. A week or
so after birth' the purificatory rites of tua
and tohi were performed, the infant being-
baptised with water sprinkled upon its head
by a tohunga standing waist deep in a run-
ning stream. Thus was the nipper dedicated
to the gods, to Tu and Rongo, that he might
grow wise in the art of- fighting and diligent
in the pursuits of peace. Throughout his
boyhood he was instructed by his elders in
fighting and hunting, and he became a mem-
ber of the taua or war party automatically
when he was deemed sufficiently skilled.
Later he would be tattooed, but the common
belief that this signified his admittance to
the ranks of the warriors has no founda-
tion. Boys from eight to ten were not, as
Colenso has declared, tattooed; moko was
never performed until the skin had
toughened, and long before that the young-
ster was carrying patu and mere.

“Akeake”: There’s a lot more in this
feathered weather-prophet business than most
people credit. Living in Maoriland, I spent
two years studying the shearwater, the
sparrowhawk and the grey warbler; and as
a prophet of summer conditions the grey
warbler has all the meteorologists beaten
out of sight. Whenever he nests high up
it’s a sure sign off a warm and pleasant
summer; but if his nest' is low, you can
bank on a good deal of rain and frequent
cold southerlies. Once, to my knowledge,
the birds weren’t unanimous, some building
high and about the same number low. That
summer was an odd mixture of fine, sunny
days and short cold snaps. The sparrow-
hawk isn’t as trustworthy or far-seeing, but
when he screams on a fine day wet weather
generally follows. Mrs. Shearwater is just
a modern flapper; she minds the home dur-
ing the daytime, but goes gadding about from
dusk till dawn. She hasn’t an ounce of
meteorologic knowledge. Not so the boy
friend. A shy fellow, he kicks up the devil
of a shindy whenever stormy weather is in
the offing, and it’s not often that his warn*
ing turns out a false alarm.
* * * *
“Homby” : “Owie” as a place-name termi-
nal is more common in S. Aus. than “up”
is in its western neighbor. For example:
Coobowie, Winnipowie, Minlacowie, Canowic,
Allsowie, Tooowie, Maracowie,
Danowie, Orriecowie, Sublimowic, Edoowie,
Bimbrowie, Saltowie, Caltowic, Wepowie,
Marcowie, Soakowie, Windowie, Telcowie,
Willcowie, Tarcowie, Willsowie, Condowie,
Terowie, Farrowie—but I’d better stop.
Many of these are little more than camps,
and possibly some of them have faded from
the map since my day, or have been buried
in the desert sand. I have been told by
both whites and blacks that the terminal
means . “place of good spirits.” If that is
so it is a misnomer in most cases, or my
taste needs cultivation.

“Waranbini” : In days of old Binghi sel-
dom went abroad without an ever-smoulder-
ing firestick, usually carried by his gin.
Wherever he stopped, if only for a few
minutes, the stick was placed on the ground
beside him, with a few twigs on it to keep
it burning. It went everywhere with him,
even when he was fishing in a bark canoe,
being planted on such occasions in a dump
of sand at the bottom of the boat. Binghi
could roast his fish there if he wanted to,
with no more wood than a white man would
use to boil a billy. The abo. is a canny
handler of fire. When hundreds of hunters
used to wander about, most of them with
the pipe stick in .attendance, through long
grass and dry litter, I never knew one to
set the bush alight if he didn’t want to.
Grass fires occurred every summer, but none f
of the accidental outbreaks could be proved "
against black brother.
AUTUMN’S AMBER ROSARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With summer gone, the wind like a lone
wolf wanders
Over the grasses, beaded soakingly,
And the great grey clouds, the low-hung
autumn raiuclouds,
Are not more grey than he.
A straw-sweet scent is left in the pale
bleached grasses;
The summer has drunk their green with
her greedy lips,
Leaving these ghosts with the flare of the
autumn banners
Over their wispy tips.
With summer gone the gorse-bush is strung
with yellow.
There are tawny leaves where the black-
berries’ beady jet
Hung clustering, and mushrooms studding
the paddocks
With the mornings, pearly wet.
With chrome and flame for music. Autumn
flushes
Her gleaming cup with one great burst
of gold,
To flood the leafy earth with a passing-
splendor
Until her amber rosary be told.

YOUR CAREER
Unless you have been specially fortune-favored, the success of your
career, so vital to your whole life, is going to depend primarily upon
your own efforts. There may be factors over which you can have no
control, therefore it is the more necessary that you seriously grapple
with those you can yourself govern. Naturally, money must enter into
your plans for to-morrow, but action must be taken to-day if you are
to succeed.

EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY
(PANSY-STREET, ROSEVILLE) ART.
This exhibition of the latest work oi
Masters Erie and Roy Simpson and theii
gifted sister Muriel (aged 10) has been
ignored hitherto by the parochially-minded
ignorami of Sydney; yet its merits are
crystal-clear to cultured persons in touch
with recent developments in up-to-the-minute
art. Efforts were made to add to the col-
lection (Avhicli is housed in the toolshed at
the back of the Simpson domicile) at least
one representative Ginger Meggs. The
heroic use of primary colors, the unconven-
tional draughtsmanship, the mystic sameness
and lovely oneness of the designs—these out-
standing-qualities of the Meggs school have
long been recognised by the leaders of the
Pansy-street cult s However, the “Sun”
refused to take the risk of unleashing any of
its treasured originals. Applications for
the loan of a Fatty Finn and/or a Peter
encountered the same fate.
The gem of the collection is unquestion-
ably Master Eric Simpson’s “Mum.” The
figure is seated in an attitude of repose, not
to say exhaustion, the A r ast back being
pathetically bumped, and the somewhat bul-
bous head bowed over the feet, which are
dinosaurian in size and form.
Spectacles and a cloche hat
(or it may be a cricketing
cap) are impressionistically
indicated. The concept is
daringly carried out in puce
and green, these being the
only colors the artist had in
his paint-box at the time the
sitting was given. The price
asked is £l5OO, but a firm
offer of Is. might Avell secure
it for one of our great gal-
leries.
Master Roy is Roseville’s
leading protagonist of im-
pressionism. So far has he
progressed as regards light-
ening his palette and broad-
ening his technique, such are
his qualities of nervous and
harmonious grace and un-
obtrusive power, that, but
for the labels on his master-
pieces, it would go hard with
sympathetic critics, blurb-
writers, gossip-hounds and
others who essayed the for-
lorn hope of stating exactly
what any given Avork from
his brush was intended to
represent. “The Lawn-
mower” is a classic case in
point. At a first examina-
tion it suggests a wombat.
Again it might be meant for
a railway station or a Manly
ferry-boat. The artist’s
father —a boor and illiterate
diehard —took it for Mrs.
Simpson’s mother.
Miss Muriel’s keen sense
of the plastic possibilities
of paint, which she applies impartially
with hand, frock and brush, is in-
stanced in “Ponto,” a side view of a flat,
blackish, four-legged object seen against a
glorious background of Prussian blue. The
thing’s eye—if indeed it be an eye—is car-
mine. A veritable orchestration of color.
The profound subjective concept of this
chromatic harmony is obvious to the writer,
but he is precluded by the provisions of the
Copyright Act from giving it away. The
price asked is a paltry £864; yet, up to the
present, believe it or not. none of our gal-
leries has attempted to acquire it. Shame,
shame on those responsible for thus refus-
ing to make our great Australian collections
representative of the vital art of our time!

RADIOPHONE TALK TO TANGANYIKA.
The “Sunday Moon” Makes History.
On Tuesday last, at 8.391 p.m., the “Sun-
day Moon,” ever to the fore in epoch-
making journalistic achie\ r ements, once again
made radio history. From his busy editorial
room the chief executive of this great paper
spoke for the first time to the manager of
the Tanganyika “Times,” Mr. Nga. What a
thrilling moment! It makes the brain reel
ro think that this modern scientific marvel
can annihilate distance with such consum-
mate ease; that for the first time since
primitive life Avallowed in the silurian slime
a human voice should have sped in the cul-
tured diction of a great Australian literary
figure from Sydney to Tanganyika! Wonder-
ful !! And noAv for the illuminating con-
versation which transpired, when the civil-
ised world stood still, as it were, -and
listened: —-
Editor: “Good morning! What is it like in
Tanganyika to-night?”
Mr. Nga: “It’s afternoon here.”
Editor: “Well, what is it like, anyway?”
Mr. Nga: “It’s hot.”
THE BOSS: “So it’s yer birthday, Dave!
Well, take arf an hour hoff and ’aVe
a dip in the water’ole—if the cows ain’t
drinkin’.”
Editor: “Marvellous, it’s quite cold here. Er—er.
Are they feeling- the depression in the native
kraals ?”
Mr. Nga: “Our natives don’t crawl,”
Editor: “I said, how’re things there?”
Mr. Nga: “Oke,”
Editor: “H’m. Would you tell our readers what
it feels like to talk over 8000 miles to a great
newspaper executive?’’
Mr. Nga: “Can’t hear you.”
Editor: “Have you any message for our readers
as to the ‘Moon’s’ enterprise in making this
epoch-making conversation passible?”
Mr. Nga: “No. Buzz off.”
Editor: “Good night.”
Mr, Nga: “It’s dav, I tell you.”
S.W.K.
THE IDEAL HOLIDAY RESORT.
Those Melbourne hikers and seasiders
always pick the wrong place for their
picnic.
The right place is under their noses. Why
not enjoy a real holi-
day on the Flinders-
street railway sta-
tion ?
A holiday in such
circumstances might
be the height of
bliss. The holiday-
maker wouldn’t be
harassed by ants,
blowflies, mosquitoes
or snakes. He could
sit at ease and watch
frantic people catch-
ing or missing trains
instead of sitting on
a damp beach watch-
ing men from Dotty-
ville doing the same
with fish. Wearying
of this he could have
his hair cut or corns
deleted; he could
write letters, read
books—or even buy
them—at the book-
stall, buy cigarettes,
flowers, fish, cake,
anti-bilious pills and
toothpaste, have his
boots cleaned, drink
exotic drinks and
eat more fruit and raisin bread. Satiated
with these pleasures, he might do the rounds
of the penny-in-the-slot machines and the
threepenny machine which turns out the
patron’s name neatly embossed in alu-
minium. He would be dry (underfoot and
overhead) all day.
And romance might arrive by the 9.15
or some such train. From time immem-
orial lovers have arranged “meets” under
railway-station clocks. The girl usually
arrives first. What a chance for a daring
Romeo who is already on the spot! What
of it if a smack in the face from the girl
or a punch on the nose from her tardy swam
should eA T entuate? You might have had the
same experience at a conventional holiday
resort.
Anyhow, you will know where to find me
next Christmas.

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.
Winter is on us and we are on the dole.
There is talk accordingly of the family
having to live under canvas, in which case
we shall be able to say
with Shakspeare “Now
is the winter of our
discon-tent.”
We are living in
Darlinghurst, but have
not yet seen any
“s n o w.” However,
local merchants de-
clare that there will
soon be a fall. Any-
how, it’s about time
the cost of the stuff
came down.
Of course, it’s not
winter in other parts
of the world. Things
are reported to be very
hot in Germany.
We are troubled
over the overcoat ques-
tion again. Our last
became so thin that
we wore it as summer
underclothing. Now
we are trying to raise
funds for a new one
—a second-hand one we mean. The next-
door bailiff is willing to exchange his second-
best for our radio, but he doesn’t know yet
that the landlord has a double mortgage on
the thing or that the valves have been
pawned. Anyhow, the time-payment people
are coming for it on Friday.

When I was an unthinking hoy
They bought me a balloon.
I blew it up with childish joy —
And broke it all too soon.
I laughed; but, now Em old, I see
It wasn't any joke.
That bust balloon resembles me:
/ get puffed up; then broke.

DRAMA.
A scream: of horror rends the dark;
A shuddering shriek assaults the ears;
A woman’s soul lies stripped and stark,
And close the satyr’s visage leers.
His loaded stick he now uprears,
The frightful blow’s about to crush her;
“Die, miserable gyurl!” he sneers.
“Back stalls? This way,” observes the usher.

AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE PROPRIETORS.
We have examined the above Balance-sheet with the books of the Bank in London and with the
Returns received in London from the Branches in Australia and New Zealand. We have verified the
Cash Balances, Loans at Call and Short Notice, Bills of Exchange, Investments and Securities held in
London. We have obtained all the information and explanations we have required, and, in our opinion
the above Balance-sheet is properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of
the Bank s a.nairs, according to the best of our information and the explanations given to us, and as
shown by the books in London and the Returns from the Branches.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
GOOD GRASS ON POOR SOIL.
“G. J.A.S,”: Before breaking up virgin
country to introduce other pastures," the
farmer should ask himself if it will produce
anything as good as what he is about to
destroy. Many years ago a neighbor in
South Westralia, bringing his seed-drill home
through a bush paddock, left it in gear, and
what super, remained went through. In a
week or two there was a bright green strip
of native grasses, notably trefoil, on which
the sheep fed in preference to any other.
I had a bare paddock of ringbarked coun-
try on which all undergrowth and fallen
timber had been cleared up. It was 700
acres of gravel and ironstone ridges and
sandy loam gullies and flats, and produced
mainly silver grass; the carrying capacity
was poor. I requisitioned an old seed-drill,
with undergear and partition board removed
and grain openings blocked, and applied
561 b. of super, to the acre in the early .spring,
covering as far as possible the whole of
the paddock. The result was astonishing.
Where only silver grass seemed to exist be-
fore, trefoil and other grasses grew in abund-
ance. In late spring 1200 ewes and lambs
were turned in where only about 150 dry
sheep had been run previously. With the
resultant healthier class of seed and heavy
stocking this paddock never reverted to its
original poverty. Using an ancient seed-
drill, lightened as described so that two
horses may move quickly, many acres can
be covered in a day. One outside hoe or
disc should be left on as a guide.
Where our sub. clover paddocks include,
say, a fifth of unbroken natural feeding
ground, no sign of clover scour appears
among the lambs. When they are all sub.
clover, the removal of a flock showing scours
to an adjoining paddock of natural grasses
cures them in a few days, and they can
then be put back on the clover.
CROPS ON MALLEE SANDHILLS.
“Glenfield”: In the undulating country of
the north-west Vic. Mallee the sandhills once
stood to the cocky in dry years ; but during
the last two good seasons the flats have
yielded the heavy crops; the hills for some
reason have produced no growth. It was
common to see a six- or eight-bag crop on
the flat gradually fading off on the hills to
about a bag on the hilltop. During the early
stages of growth the seed, after germinating
well, refused to stool on the hills and gradu-
ally developed to thin, spindly plants.
This may be attributed to wind ero-
sion during the ’29 drought, when the hills
were depleted of humus. Perhaps the best
way to rectify this is to leave the hills
when fallowing and sow them heavily with
oats and super. After a good root system
ami leafy growth have developed, graze them
right off with sheep ; their manure and the
subsequent dry roots of the oats will restore
the humus and so enable the hills to stand
up to us again in the coming dry seasons.
This should also combat drift in the pad-
docks.
GRADING OF LAMBS.
“GG6”: There can be no doubt about
the advantages of an Australian Meat Coun-
cil on the lines of that in Maoriland (B.
5/4/’33), but in some respects conditions
in the two countries differ. This is parti-
cularly the case in the important matter of
export lambs. In Maoriland these are cross-
bred or Doiyns types, so closely resembling-
each other in conformation as to give the
impression of all being turned out of one
mould. In Australia, in addition to cross-
breds, a quantity of merino lamb is mar-
keted. Merino lamb is second to none in
quality, but it differs considerably in appear-
ance from the crossbred article. The mixing
of the two in the Australian export is re-
sponsible for most of the complaints about
the irregularity of our product.
The obvious remedy is to grade our lambs
into, classes, one for crossbreds and one for
merinos, each, of course, being graded into
qualities in its own class. The British
public, on whose predilections the success
of marketing our produce depends, would
probably have to be educated to the merits
of merino mutton and lamb. That, of course,
is still another of the jobs for which it is
proposed to institute the Australian Meat
Council.
PREVENTING RICKETS.
“J.A.S.”: This bone disease of young
animals is generally attributable to defi-
ciency of lime and phosphorus in the ration.
But it can develop, despite a plentiful supply
of minerals, where animals, especially dogs
and pigs, are housed in badly-lighted build-
ings and get little sunlight. Chickens,
notoriously subject to rickets, can be reared
to maturity indoors with absence of sunlight,
provided cod-liver oil. which is a prolific
source of the essential vitamin “D,” is fed
regularly. Good results have been obtained
by feeding small quantities of this oil to
pigs, foals, calves and dogs. But there
should be little need in sunny Australia to
have recourse to this somewhat expensive
vitamin “D” supply.
In advanced cases of the disease, one to
two tablespoons of cod-liver oil fed daily
to calves, pigs, foals, etc., may effect a cure.
Phosphorus, one-fortieth of a‘grain, and cal-
cium phosphate, one dram, given twice daily
to two-months-old calves, and proportion-
ately for other animals, has also proved
efficacious. But rickets must be regarded
as hard to cure and comparatively easy to
prevent. Prevention may be effected by a
well-balanced ration (including lucerne
wherever possible) : sufficient minerals in
the form of licks or top-dressed pastures,
and buildings erected so that full advantage
is gained from sunshine. Attention should
be paid to the dam's mineral and vitamin
supply in the months before the youngster’s
arrival.
COWS WITH MILK FEVER.
“Setren”: “Salmon Gums’s” treatment of
milk fever (B. 29/3/’33) is all right except
for the bicycle pump. No dairyman these
days should be without a milk-fever outfit:
a small pump, rubber tubing, a cylinder
tilled with cotton-wool that has been soaked
in carbolic oil and two needles. I find
Condy’s crystals handy and keep a supply
in the box. together with the tapes, cut in
•suitable lengths.'
If a man keeps his eye on a freshly-calved
cow, he can often ward off an attack. The
first symptoms are, usually, ceasing of rumi-
nation. dejected appearance, lowered head,
mouth slightly open and dribbling. The cow
takes no interest in the calf and mopes in
a corner. Give at once a drench (there are
several reliable makes on "the market) in a
beer bottle and proceed to pump her bag, after
stripping the teats. Tie the ends and leave
her quiet; this will often stop her going
down. After 12 hours, give her a second
drench and a box of damp bran, which will
prove a laxative, as the drenches are purely
a blood medicine. Leave the calf with her
until she is all right: it helps to get the
air out of the bag again.
In the event of, the cow being down and
lapsing into coma, do not attempt to drench,
as the animal cannot swallow and it is
liable to run into the lungs instead of the
bowels. On no, account allow her to lie on
her side. Keep her propped up in the
natural position by means of bags well-
stuffed with straw, etc. If the weather is
cold and wet, cover her with bags. If there
is no improvement after five hours, remove
tapes, repeat the pumping and gently rub
and knead the udder for five minutes.
SOIL SALINITY.
Interesting and important soil surveys
have been carried out on five Murray Valley
irrigation settlements by four Australian
scientists, J. K. Taylor, F. Penman, T. .T.
Marshall and G. W. Leeper, at the instance
of the C.S.I.R. The areas, aggregating 9300
acres, are scattered over about 60 miles of
typical malice country in the vicinity of
Swan Hill (Vic.), ranging from Goodnight
(N.S.W.) in the north to Kangaroo Lake
(Vic.) in the south. Considerable decreases
in cropped area have occurred on one settle-
ment (Tresco), and a proportion of each
has been rendered unproductive by an ex-
cessive increase in soil salinity. Six soils
belonging to five types have been defined and
given the names Murray sand, Tyntynder
sand. Tatchera sand, Tatchera sandy loam,
Vinifera loam, Nyah clay loam.
Salinity is the main problem. The investi-
gators, who describe their researches and
set forth their conclusions in a C.S.I.R.
bulletin, found that “the productivity of all
five settlements has been lowered to some
extent by excessive salt accumulations in
the soil.” But they consider “that the saline
areas can be confined to the present limits,
and that there is no' reason to expect any
extension ; salinity may indeed be restricted
if sound irrigation practice is followed.”
As for the development of further irri-
gable land, “no unavoidable danger attaches
to the irrigation of the higher country in the
Murray Valley between Swan Hill and Good-
night, but south-east of Lake Boga evidence
shows a significantly high salt content at
shallow depths in the lower land, and at
greater depths in the rising ground. The un-
certainty of dried-fruit production under the
adverse climatic conditions, and the suscep-
tibility of citrus to salt injury and water-
logging, emphasise the conclusion that it is
not advisable to develop further the red
sandy soils of this district.”
DIPPING SULTANAS.
“Ivilkivan”: There are three dips in use
on our irrigation areas. The hot caustic
dip was universal until recent years. There
is a definite brown tinge in fruit dried by
this method, and until English requirements
dominated the position results were voted
satisfactory. The light color needed for Eng-
land (described as the color of an English
sovereign) cannot be obtained with caustic
soda. The solution used is simply caustic
soda heated to 195 deg. and strong enough to
crack the skin of the berry.
The poor prices realised a few years back
prompted inquiries. One reason advanced
was that our sultanas were inferior in
appearance to Smyrna fruit. There were at
that time in Mildura (Vic.) a number of
Greek refugees from Smyrna. A Greek
committee was formed, and the cold dip,
based on Smyrna practice, came into vogue!
Steve Mansell, one of the largest individual
growers in Australia, took it up with
enthusiasm and still uses it. But Smyrna
methods had to be modified a great deal to
suit Australian conditions. The dip pro-
duced fruit of a very light color, but had
several drawbacks; the time inquired for
drying was too long, more plant was
needed, and very often the fruit dried with
an objectionable green tinge. The solution
is made up of lib. carbonate of potash to
2gal. of water and 1 pint of olive oil to
25ga1.; the period of immersion is much
longer than in the hot dips, from two to five
minutes. The chief advantage of the dip
is that the skin of the berry is not cracked,
which makes for better keeping.
The dip now in. most use, and which all
growers are asked to adopt as .the Austra-
lian standard dip, is a cross between these
two. It is quicker than the cold dip and pro-
duces fruit of a light amber color especially
suited for export. Rain in the drying period
darkens, but does not spoil it, nor is there
any stickiness after rain, as with the caustic
alone. The solution is 2ilb. carb. potash, and
1-j pints olive oil to 50gals. of water, with
caustic soda added till slight cracks appear
on some of the berries and the bloom is
removed from the fruit. The temperature ih
177d0g. to 182 deg. This dip was exten-
sively used in the harvest just completed and
has produced long lines of high-quality fruit
DATE-GROWING IN AUSTRALIA.
“Hod el Usbeg”: My comment (B.
15/3/’33) dealt with it as a commercial pro-
position. Reference was made to the fact
that occasionally palms were found to fruit,
so the instances quoted by “Campagnus”
(B. 19/4/’33) and others were superfluous.
But one swallow doesn’t make a summer.
If date-growing is to be established as an
industry, as suggested by some people, the
palms will have to be grown by the thousand
in close proximity to each other. They will
have to be tended and hand-fertilised if good
results are to be got. Although wind may
fertilise a palm or two at Dead Man’s
Creek, it fails to do so in the vast groves
of those parts of the world which have been
marketing dates from time immemorial. At
white man’s wages the cost will be consider-
able, and to that must be added the price of
hand-picking and packing, also at Australian
rates.
“Hop Scrub”: For the growing of dates
there are required a long hot summer ; a
mild winter with rare and light frosts;
absence of rain in spring when the fruit is
setting; neither rain nor heavy dew in
autumn when the fruit is ripe. Then irri-
gation water must be available, with not
over 3 per cent, of alkali in it. Given these
conditions the palm isn’t particular about
soils—witness its range from the Euphrates
to Arizona and California. The good horti-
culturist’s standby—a well-drained sandy
loam —would probably give the best commer-
cial results. California’s Coachella Valley
is a centre of scientific date-production by
“white” Americans. They plant 40 or 50
palms to the acre. The plantings are all
from offshoots which have commenced to
root, and 'are carefully chiselled from bear-
ing palms of the best varieties, hardened off
for a while, then transplanted to a frame of
wood with a canvas roof. The soil is cov-
ered with fresh stable manure a foot deep,
flooded with water and allowed to steam for
a week; then the offshoots are planted.
A year later they go into their permanent
place. Pollination is a hand job; but dry
pollen will retain its vitality for years in
case of necessity. And any of the related
species, such as the canary palm (Phoenix
canariensis) and the cotton palm (Washing-
tonia filfera), will provide suitable pollen.
To ensure success commercially it would be
necessary to import offshoots, preferably
from California or Arizona.
WEIGHING BEEHIVES.
“Orn” : It is often of advantage to know
at what rate the honey is coming in. Bee-
keepers frequently have a hive on scales, so
that they can keep the record, but scales
are costly and exposure rusts and damages
them. Moreover no great standard of accu-
racy is required. This year I fixed up a
simple contrivance, which served me satis-
factorily.
The material consists of a 10 x 2 hard-
wood plank about Bft. long, a piece of angle-
iron 12in. long, and a piece of scrap iron to
act as weight. The hive rests on one end
of the plank, and the plank rests on the
angular part of the angle-iron, which is
placed alongside the hive and about 2in. from
it. The other portion of the plank partly
counterbalances the hive; the scrap-iron
weight is placed on the plank and moved
along till all is in balance when the plank
is level. The only variable factors are the
honey going into the hive, which may be
taken to act in the centre line at the dis-
tance of that centre line from the angle-iron,
which would be about Din., and the distance
of the scrap-iron weight from the angle-iron.
Hence if 31b. of honey is added to the hive,
there are 27 units added to the downthrust
on that side. If the scrap iron weighs
271 b., it must be moved 3in. further away
to counterbalance this 31b. increase of honey,
or lin. per pound. If any other weight is
used, the distance will be different but. quite
constant for every pound increase, and easily
■tested by placing a known weight on the hive.
Hence the distance measurement from day to
day gives the weight.
It was a.surprise to me on the West Coast
of Tasmania to find 151 b. of honey coming
in on one day, but the extractor confirmed
• the figures.
DON’T WORK IT TOO FINE.
“J.W.W,”: Says J. T. Ramsay, the Vic.
potato expert:—
It is not necessary or desirable to work the soil
down too finely [for potatoes], as in the event of
heavy rainfall it is liable to run together and become
so closely set as to necessitate the whole of the
ploughing and cultivating being gone over again.
These remarks hold good for more crops
than potatoes. They are applicable to beans
more, perhaps, than to any other crop, owing
to the peculiar way beans come through the
ground—necks first, and heads afterwards.
Certain kinds of soil, chiefly those with
a fair admixture of clay, do run together and
set hard after rain, forming a cake on top
which is very hard for young plants to pierce.
In the case of beans where the necks have
come through, but not the heads, the crop is
lost unless it rains again soon, or there is some
means of watering, because the baby plants
with this caked soil set hard round their
heads cannot live long. They simply get
strangled, as the soil can’t he worked (except
on a very small scale) for fear of breaking
their necks off. Liberal mulching in this
case, if done in time, will save the beans.
OVERHAULING THE INCUBATOR.
“A.G.8.”; Poultry-keepers want some
early chickens, and now is the time to over-
haul incubators. Wicks should be renewed
and lamp fonts thoroughly cleaned, by boil-
ing if possible; burners should be included
in this treatment. Fonts should be perfectly
dry before oil is put in the lamp. All the
hot-air radiation pipes should be gone over
and cleaned thoroughly, and a stove brush
should be applied briskly to the flues over
the lamp. If you have a hot-water machine,
tank and supply pipes ought to be tested
and taps overhauled. The top regulator of
the machine has perhaps shifted and the ris-
ing cap may have got out of plumb. See
that these are working correctly. Thoroughly
disinfect the interior; a solution of perman.
of potash in water is simple and satisfac-
tory. See that the capsule in the machine
gives a sound when you shake it, and place
the pin on it correctly. Egg trays should
be scrubbed with soap and hot water and
any scraps of shell adhering removed.
Trim the wick to get a rounded flame,
light the lamp, and, after placing the ther-
mometer in position, test the machine for
at least two days to detect any unevenness
in Its funning. Air vents should be ad-
justed just as in hatching you have found
best In some machines there is rather a
surfeit of air at the commencement of the
hatch, and perhaps a vent can be closed and
opened later. If the egg tray runs in jerkily
a little blac-klead should be rubbed on the
runners, so that it will move in and out
without vibration. The weather having
turned cold, don’t put cold eggs in the in-
cubator running at 103 deg.. or the yolks may
break. After running it for the test time,
open up and allow it to cool before the eggs
are introduced. See that your moisture tray
is in position. The machine will not work
satisfactorily in too close a room nor if

RAILWAY SLEEPERS ON THE FARM.
“G.R.McK.”; Four years ago I bought
100 Oft. sleepers at Is. 3d. each; carriage
from line (six miles), 6d. each. Sawing
them in halves, I used them for posts in a
sheepyard; but they had to be capped with
a solid rail to get the necessary height, as
they were sunk 18in. in the ground. Split-
ting the full rail, I used them also in making
fowlyards. Sawn to suitable lengths, they
made excellent blocks for floor joists. This
I was able to do with first-class sleepers.
I have recently purchased 100 second-
class sleepers as they lie (on the line) at
6d. each, and, being much closer, carriage
was only 3d.; but add a man with a
horse to draw them within loading distance,
and another man to help load them (this
with the earlier and better-class sleeper was
done by the railway), the cost runs out
at about the same. It was possible with
the first lot to saw within an inch to an
inch and a half; with the second lot a saw
would not look at any part. Splitting them
to make 2in. planks is impossible, so I
intend to use the last lot for culvert cross-
ings and for a blacksmith’s shop. By sink-
ing- a trench Ift. deep and bedding in 4in. to
6in. of concrete, I should have a job that will
last.
Summing up, I have often wondered if
they are worth while. In fencing they lack
the height necessary, except as strainers,
and will break bits as fast as you put them
in. In building sheds iron is almost as
economical and more easily worked. Cul-
verts are really their long suit.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
1 have the offer of a line of merino ewesj
they are well bred but have been mated with
Romney rams for the past two years. As
l went to breed merino lambs from them, 1
am anxious to know if the lambs will shoio
any trace of the longwools. I have been
told they wi11 —5323.
The best authorities on this subject
(known as telegony) have proved that there
is no ground for the belief that the progeny
is affected by earlier matings. There should
be no danger in buying the merino ewes and
using merino rams with them.
What is considered the best implement for
renovating, lucerne, particularly where there
is grass?— sl9o.
The efficacy of any particular type of im-
plement in cultivating lucerne depends very
much on the condition of the ground, and
the destructive effects will depend on the
severity of treatment. The rigid-tyned type
of implement was adopted at Werribee, but
later experiments did not disclose any bene-
fits from cultivating lucerne beyond reduc-
ing the amount of grass in the first cut.

Is there any method of preserving hessian,
bagging and cloth from rotting and decay, if
the color and consistency of the fabric are
not greatly altered, such fabric not coming
in contact with food or animals? —5170.
Hessian and bagging are low-grade jute
materials, and very difficult to preserve.
They can be given coatings of boiled linseed
oil or good whitewash containing resinous
or gluey ingredients, but these dressings
render the materials only fit for hangings,
etc., and spoil them for use as flexible fabrics.
Cloth may? be preserved to some extent,
according to its quality, by waterproofing
with chemicals or treating as mentioned.
Atmospheric changes, heat, damp and dust,
as well as movement, all act disastrously on
woyen materials, so that they eventually
perish even if they are not used very much.
How to make axle grease? —s339.
Any fat, dripping or tallow can be used,
but it must be clean and free from salt and
gritty particles. Clarify by pouring boiling
water over it and, when it has cooled, by re-
moving and scraping the cake of fat; do this
two or three times, as impure fat has a
destructive action on metals. Then take
eight parts of fat by weight and two parts
of powdered blacklead or best graphite, and
melt together. Keep stirring until it cools
to retain the lead in suspension. Store in
covered tins or jars.
Recipe for a harness-dressing used in the
army—called dubbin, I think?- —5313.
Tallow, lib.; beeswax, 60z.; black pitch,
40z.; common castor oil, 31b.; paraffin wax,
41b.; oil of citronella, |oz. Melt all together
in a pan over a closed fire, except the citron-
ella, which add on cooling. Stir well, as it
melts ; store in covered tins. Beware of its
inflammability when making.
I have a profusion of the scented vari-
eties of lavender and musk grouping. Could
I distil scent from these plants far home
use? Would the same process be used as in
the distilling of verbena and rosemary ? —
5183.
Lavender can be produced in much the
same way as in the distillation of verbena
and rosemary. Musk, however, falls into a
different category; it is best prepared by
means of the enfieurage or fat-extraction
process. Full particulars can be obtained
free on application to the Curator, Tech.
Museum, Harris-street, Ultimo, Sydney.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Valerin”: When your tank goes dry
clean out the silt a.s soon as the teams can
get on to it, and if time permits add a few
hundred yards to its cubic capacity; one
large tank is better than all the small ones.
And clean out drains thoroughly; after a
prolonged dry spell the ground absorbs a
high percentage of the fall before water
begins to run.
“Junee” : Feeding sheep by throwing hay
on the ground is wasteful; they run all
over it looking for the heads on the straw,
and more than half is lost. Building racks
or mangers is too ‘costly. Try doubling the
length of wide-gauge netting into a "vee” and
string between posts sufficiently high to pre-
vent sheep passing underneath. Put hay
into this; the sheep will pick out the straws
and waste is negligible.
“Nuchum”: When standing a line of fence
posts, it is a good idea to place a clod the
size of a chestnut on top of each post. These
clods are easily seen from a distance, and
the job of lining and levelling the tops of
the posts is very much simplified.
“Cooramin”: The first part of a bucket
that wears out is the bottom. The thing
can still serve for a while—as a stable
bucket for carrying feed to the manger, for
holding ashes, picking up potatoes, bagging
grain, and many other purposes—if you cut
out a bottom from a piece of inch pipe and
fasten it in with strong clouts.
“Kingscote”: Old fern hooks or similar
tools can be turned into good spreader holders.
Break the blade off short, leaving the tapered
tubular part that goes over the wooden
handle, and with the aid of a small forge
draw the remainder of the blade into a shape
that will just go through the link of a
chain. Punch a hole through the end of the
nose thus formed so that a pin or wire can
be put through to prevent chain coming off.
A wooden spreader can now be fitted into
the tube and secured with a screw or nail
through the hole in the side of the tube;
two tubes of course are required for each
spreader. A set lasts a lifetime, and
where leading chains have to be used they
save both time and temper.
“Bismfifk”: If you intend scalding a
3001 b. pig and a large tub is not available,
dig a hole as long as the pig and about a
foot deep, lay corn-bags in the bottom and
over the sides. Put the pig in, cover
him with bags and pour the water on him.
Be careful he doesn’t lie two long in the
same spot or the water will burn him. In
a .little while take him out and scrape him.
“The Breaker”: Stockholm tar can be used
with success when a scum appears on horses'
eyes. Force a liberal smear of tar up under-
neath the top eyelid ; it doesn’t pain, and
will cut away the thickest of scums.
“Jumbuck”: When going through the
sheep for blowfly trouble, look out for a
missing horn. Horns pulled off in a fence
often bleed, and if the place is struck the
maggots are generally well down in the
cavity.
“Grey Box”; This is my way of render-
ing beeswax from old combs. Soak for 24
hours in clean cold water, place in bright
kero.- or petrol-tins and melt, using, plenty
of water. When melted, .strain through a
piece of sound chaffbag, previously wetted,
and allow the liquid wax to set. Wrap the
residue in the bag, tie and reheat, using
plenty of water again. Keep poking it with
a blunt stick; when almost boiling, take
from the fire, anfl place where a small screw-
jack can be used. Place a square of wood
in the tin, the jack on top of this, and screw
down ; leave till the wax sets. Scrape off
all dirt, same with the strained block; re-
melt in a clean bright tin, allow to cool
slowly and scrape off dirt again. Result, a
very fair sample of wax.
“Seed Drill”: Don’t throw’ away the old
wire mattress. It makes a first-class screen
for sifting ashes, gravel and so on. Just
stand it on end and throw the stuff against
it with a shovel.
“Woorinen”: People who complain that
Australian handles for axes and other tools
break too easily can overcome this by soak-
ing the handles in raw linseed oil before
inserting them. After breaking an average
of an axe-handle a month for a while wo
tried this; the handle so treated has been
in for four summer months and i.s as good
as new, if not better. The local hardware
man sold me a rake nearly two years ago,
remarking that he could afford to sell it
cheap because I would soon be back for a
new handle. Painting the handle a few
times with raw oil has kept it unbroken and
in perfect condition.
“E.11.M.”; Before sowing seeds in boxes
work boxes with a strong disinfectant to
keep away insects. Seeds should be watered
before they are covered with soil and should
not again be watered until they have germi-
nated. If water is sprinkled on the soil
covering the seeds, the pores will be closed
to the air necessary for proper germination.
“Pasp.”: Damp some sand with kero-
sene and sprinkle thin lines of it between
the row’s of onion seedlings. The onion fly
dislikes the smell of kerosene.
“The Breaker”: Draught horses suitable
for farm work have come into their own
again ; Western Queensland is being combed
for them. At a Hughenden sale all those
offered were quickly sold, prices for un-
broken draughts reaching £37. Men from
the north-coast cane areas were the princi-
pal purchasers, one buyer alone intimating
that he could place anything up to a thous-
and head of draughts. With plentiful sup-
plies of mill molasses and cane chop-chop
available, it costs little to feed Dobbin up
there.
“A. J. 8.” ; Touching that sale of 7000 cattle
(B. 29/3/’33). At Goulburn (N.S.W.)
municipal yards on November 23, 1916,
Leslie Wheatley sold 6250 store cattle for
£52.031 55.. averaging £8 6s. 6d. per head,
and for cash. The sale started at two o’clock
and the 6250 were sold and delivered by
six o’clock.
“Beefo”: Prospects for cattle-breeders are
not bright in Queensland. One of the meat-
works has just announced its prices for the
season: Bullocks, first-grade, 13s. per
1001 b.; second-grade, 11s.; rejects, Bs.; con-
demned. ss. Prices quoted might have been
acceptable w r ere they for delivery on the'
hoof, but, they are for frozen weight,
delivered at the works.

I am anxious to acquire a knowledge of
navigation sufficient to be valuable to one
desirous of venturing to sea in small boats.
How should I go about it? —5268.
Better consult the principal of a nautical
school. The amount of knowledge needed
would depend on the extent of the contem-
plated voyage. Short trips off the coast
would require a knowledge of the compass
and its errors, and of local conditions, such
as set of current. In the case of extended
voyages you would need to know how to find
latitude and longitude—for which a sextant
and chronometer or a good watch would be
necessary—and to be tolerably familiar with
chart work.
How to stop wheel-wobble in a Citroen
car?— ssos.
The toe-in of front wheels should not
exceed a quarter of an inch. Also, see that
front axle is not bent upwards, causing
wheels to be closer at top than bottom.
What about wear in your steering-box?
This should be checked over; and take care
that pressure in front tyres is equal, and
that tyres and wheels are balanced. In addi-
tion, look to the front spring anchor-bolts;
looseness here will often cause wheel-wobble.
Did any of the parties concerned in the
Harry Mor ant (“ i’he Breaker”) case in
South Africa turn Queen's evidence? What
happened to the three accused? Was their
commanding officer disrated? —s2l2.
None of the parties concerned turned
Queen’s evidence. Morant, Hancock and
Witton were condemned to death. Morant
and Hancock w r ere executed by shooting at
Pretoria. Witton was sentenced to im-
prisonment for life, but after serving a short
time in England was pardoned. The late
Colonel Lenehan, commanding the Bushveld
Carbineers and Commandant of the district
where the shootings occurred, was cashiered
for neglect of duty, but was later reinstated
by the Federal Government.
Oil pressure on my car, as indicated by
the oil-gauge on the dashboard, falls off
somewhat after the engime has been running
for a while. Cause? —s3s4.
When the engine is cold the pressure wili
be higher until the oil thins down. Maxi-
mum pressures will be indicated at given
speeds when the engine is cold and the oil
thick; minimum pressures when the engine
is hot and oil becomes thin. Always adjust
the oil pressure when the engine is hot and
running at about 25 m.p.h. car speed.
(1) llow is an automatic refrigerator
controlled? (2) What measures arc usually
taken to safeguard the cylinder head when
restarting the compressor? (3) Books deal-
ing with the subject? —s32l.
(1) Usually by a thermostat and an auto-
matic electric control for stopping and start-
ing the compressor motor according to the
variation of temperature in the cold room,
together with an automatic expansion valve.
These thermostats are so constructed that
when temperature rises to a certain point
an electric contact is made, thereby starting
the compressor motor. After the' tempera-
ture has been reduced sufficiently, the ther-
mostat makes another contact which stops
the compressor motor. (2) There is an
automatic valve in the compressor head
which opens when the compressor com-
mences to operate. (3) A chapter is devoted
to automatic compressors in “Handbook, of
Mechanical Refrigeration,” price £4 Is. 6d..
from Dymocks.
(1) Cause of and (2) treatment for in-
growing toenail? —5363.
(1) Years of unsuitable footwear, especi-

Cut with a sharp, curved manicure scissors
wherever cutting gives relief, moisten with
methylated spirits and press in plenty of
powdered alum all round the nail. Do this
twice a day; it is a cure, and will bring
complete relief within five days. Give weekly
attention, and be careful to have well-fitted
shoes.
When whip-plaiters speak of “cutting on
the round” what do they mean? Can
st> ands for an B ft. whip be cut along the
6a wu or f rom side t 0 side °f a hide? —4642.
When cutting the strands for a whip, the
piaiter trims the skin into a rough oval
shape by cutting away the rough belly por-
tion shoulders, etc. Then, using a sharp
penknife, with his thumbnail as a guide, he
cuts round and round the hide until he
\ o? st , rancl lon S' enough for his purpose.
-An Btt. thong needs strands about 12ft. long,
so cutting strands straight along the back
or Iron} side to side would be useless. The
short strands could, of course, be spliced

very discolored. Best way to restore it to
its original brightness? —s397.
Wash well: in hot soapy water containing
a litrle washing soda, and use a brush if
there is any raised or indented work. Pour
hot water over it, and stand aside to dry.
Make up a paste of whiting and methylated
spirits, and rub on the pewter with a
woollen rag until the mass is dry and falls
off ; finish with a silk cloth.
Composition of hydraulic-brake fluid ? —

ing of one part denatured alcohol and one
part chemically pure castor oil.
How many species of albatrosses frequent
Australian waters and how can they be dis-
tinguished? Which is the largest? Do they
nest in Australia? —sl6s.
Most of the species found in the Southern
Ocean appear in Australian seas during the
winter from Brisbane south and west to
Geraldton ("W.A.). The Wandering Alba-
tross ( Diomeda exulans) is the largest; its
first plumage is dark brown with a white
face, but it becomes whiter as it grows older,
till it is entirely white except for black
tips to wings and tails. Span from tip of
one wing to tip of the other is between 10ft.
and lift. Smaller forms, known to sailors
as mollyhawks, may be distinguished by
dark coloration of the wings, extending
right across the back. Four kinds are
common in Australian waters; one, the
White-capped Albatross ( Diomeda cauta),
nests on Albatross Island in Bass Strait—
the only locality in Australia where alba-
trosses are known to breed. The two species
of Sooty Albatross ( Phccbctria ) also visit
Australian waters. They are slenderer
and swifter than the other kinds, dusky in
color, with a white ring round the eye.
(1) Do cockroaches lay eggs? (2) How
long before they are full-grown? (3) How
long do they live? (4) Best way of getting
rid of them? —5205.
(1) Yes, in a horny case or capsule,
varying in size and shape with different
species. In some capsules there are 16 eggs,
in others up to 40. (2) The common large
brown cockroach develops from egg to adult
in about one year; in certain other species
several years may be required (3) Not
definitely known; as several egg capsules
are laid it is probable that the adults live
for some months. (4) Best method of con-
trol is thorough cleanliness and removal of
all foodstuffs from their reach. Boracic
acid pow'der alone, or boracic acid powder
one part, mixed with about five parts of
starch, dusted into their haunts and hiding
places with a small hand bulb insecticide
duster, will settle them.
Some time back I read where the N.S.W.
Government had passed legislation to remit
municipal rates on house property on which
the owner icas receiving no rent. What
cases of hardship would come under that
provision f —5025.
There has been no such legislation. Gener-
ally speaking, councils are extending the
greatest possible latitude to ratepayers and
deal sympathetically with authentic cases of
hardship. Many councils also are accepting
payment of rates by instalments.
What amount of child endowment is pay-
able in N.S.W. to a man with wife and two
children, the wage being £3 10s. per week?
—5244.
It depends on the “family income” for
the 52 weeks preceding the lodgment of a
claim. Full endowment of £l3 p.a. for the
second child may be paid if the “family in-
come” during the 52 weeks did not exceed the
amount of the basic wrnge over the same
period.
. Gan a girl in a Queensland training hos-
pital transfer to a hospital in N.S.W. with-
out forfeiting the time spent in training,
and do the exams, she may have passed
count? —5275.
No; part-training as a nurse in another
State cannot be recognised by the N.S.W.
Nurses’ Registration Board; she is required
to complete the full period of training in
N.S.W. And before commencing training in
N.S.W. a girl must hold an educational cer-
tificate recognised by the N.S.W. Nurses’
Registration Board.
(1) Any firm in South Aus. or Westralia
making straw envelopes for packing pur-
poses? (2) Any other lines which could be
manufactured in this class of business? (3)
Approximate amount of this product con-
sumed in South Aus. P—5215.
(1) Straw envelopes have been made in
South Aus. this season by a wine firm for
its own use. If experiments are successful
it may undertake manufacture for others.
(2) It’s a matter of market development.
(3) Production figures are not available, but
the demand for straw envelopes has de-
creased in recent years. The. case trade in
wines has fallen, and corrugated cardboard
has superseded straw in medicinal and other
packings.
Recipe for icecream to be manufactured in
an electric refrigerator?- —5015.
Assemble 1 quart milk, 3 dessertspoons
cornflour, 4 teaspoons vanilla or other flavor-
ing, -Jib. sugar, 2 eggs and \ pint cream.
Set the milk on the fire to become very hot.
Beat eggs and sugar together, add the corn-
flour slightly blended with cool milk, stir
all well, then gradually add the heated milk
Cook over water (in a double boiler) until the
mixture thickens, then remove and allow to
cool. When cool, add the flavoring and the
cream, which should have been wdiipped in
the interval. Place in a thin basin, stand
in a larger basin, place pieces of ice in
the space between the two basin sides' and
stand the whole in the coldest part of the
refrigerator until of the right consistency.
We read that Captain Phillip, R.N., first.
Governor of N.S.W., was made a rear-
admiral of the Blue in ISOI. What is this
rank ? —5240.
In the middle of the seventeenth century
the British fleet was divided into three
squadrons, distinguished as the Red or
Centre, commanded by the admiral; the
White or Van, commanded by the vice-
admiral ; and the Rear or Blue, commanded
by the rear-admiral, each having a distinc-
tive ensign. From this followed the division
of officers of flag rank into admirals, vice-
admirals and rear-admirals of the Red,
White and Blue respectively, Red taking the
senior place and Blpe the junior. In 1863
these distinctions were abolished, the white
flag with the red St. George’s Cross being
definitely selected as the flag for admirals.
Meaning and origin of the word “Chari-
vari”?—sl2o.
It is a French term of uncertain origin,
used for a wild uproar caused by the banging
of pans and kettles, mingled -with hissing,
groaning and shouting, expressive of dis-
approval of the people against whom it is
directed. It was originally a regular wed-
ding custom in France in the Middle Ages,
but later it was used Only at unpopular
weddings, particularly for widows or
widowers who remarried too soon. The
term has been taken as the title of various
satirical papers, and is used as a sub-title for
“Punch.”
Huppo.se a man of 44, without experience,
passes the N.B.W. exam, for toicn and shire
clerks, what chance has he of obtaining an
appointment? —49o2.
It all depends. There are 320 local-govern-
ment areas. Recently the municipality of
Nowra filled the vacancy of town clerk, a
position carrying nearly £5OO a year. It
had 72 applicants, arid selected a man with
no previous experience as a town clerk or
in a town clerk’s office. Many local-govern-
ment clerks entered the service, after secur-
ing their certificates, without any previous
experience ; and before the depression came
there were not enough men to fill the posi-
tions offering. There are now more appli-
cants than there have ever been before. In
addition to this councils are economising and
carrying on with as small staffs as possible.
How to renovate or top-dress a cement
path which is cracking' badly? —4s69.
A concrete path which has been badly
cracked cannot be successfully repaired
except by removing broken material and re-
constructing another path to a slightly higher
level than the original. If the cracking is
not too severe, a serviceable job can some-
times be made by treating the surface with
a mixture of two parts of fine sand to one
part of cement and sufficient water to make
a creamy consistency. This mixture should
be well rubbed into the cracks, previously
cleaned, and the path kept damp for from
seven to ten days.
What was “breaking on the wheel?’’--
5207.
A mode of inflicting the punishment of
death, used by the Greeks and Romans and
in Western Europe until the end of the
eighteenth century ; the victim was extended
on beams joined like an X, and his bones
were broken by blows with an iron bar.
The body was then placed on a wheel, bent
round, with arms and legs behind the back
and head turned up to the sky. The culprit
was then left to die; his sufferings perhaps
continued for 24 hours. The punishment
was abolished in France in 1789 and in
Prussia in 1811.
What was the Black Hand Society? How
did it get its name? —3840.
It was a society formed by Italians in
New York for purposes of blackmail and
extortion. They chose their victims mostly
from among the poorer of their fellow-
countrymen, and signed threatening letters
with a representation of a black hand clutch-
ing a stiletto. In May, 1914, the police
arrested several of the criminals and the
gang was dispersed.
Who teas Griselda in fiction? —4749.
The heroine of a folk-story, versions of
which are to be found in the works of
Boccaccio, of Chaucer and Petrarch. She
was a very beautiful peasant girl who was
wooed by a marquis. She became his wife,
and to assure himself of the worth and
stability of her character he put her to the
severest ordeals, through all of which she
passed successfully.
In music what is a symphony? What com-
posers employed this form of musical expres-
sion icith success? —sl3o.
A composition in sonata form for orch-
estra. originated by H'aydn and developed
by Mozart and Beethoven. Symphonies by
these and lesser contemporary masters gener-
ally follow the old classical sonata form-
four sections. In symphonies by Liszt and
Elgar movements follow without a break.
The principal symphonists since Beethoven,
including those who use the continuous
form, are Schubert, Brahms, Liszt, Tschai-
kowsky, Richard Strauss, Dvorak Parry and
Elgar.
Recipe for a good toothpaste? —s4B2.
Shredded white Castile soap, 4 drachms;
heavy carbonate of magnesia, loz.; precipi-
tated chalk, _ 30z.; oil of peppermint, 10
drops; glycerine, loz.; enough rosewater to
make a stiff paste. Mix the magnesia and
peppermint_ together, add dry ingredients,
then glycerine, and work up with sufficient
rosewater to desired finish.
Where did belief in the pre-existence of
the soul originate? What religious bodies
subscribe to the doctrine? Names of any
philosophers who believed in it? —4879.
The doctrine that man’s soul had an
existence apart before it became united to
the body is Eastern in origin, and in the
East it is generally associated with the doc-
trine of the transmigration of souls. Thus
it is held by the Buddhists. Plato also
upheld it. unless his observations on the
subject are to be regarded as purely symboli-
cal. Philo Judaeus also taught the doctrine
of pre-existence, and from him it was
adopted by Origen. It was condemned at
the Council of Constantinople. The belief
in pre-existence is countenanced by such
as Kant. Schelling, the younger Fichte,
Lessing, Schopenhauer and Jean Reynaud.
Does Anybody Know?
Meaning of “cooranbong,” an aboriginal
word ? —5411.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
In Melbourne the former “pony” course
Ascot is having two consecutive Saturday
fixtures. Clubs which resent the raising in
status of what used to be called “unregis-
tered” racing object, but objections are use-
less. Last Week-end most of the V.R.C.
committeemen were at Ascot • among them
was Alan Currie, the vice-chairman, who
saw his Equator filly Torada beaten out of a
place in the Juvenile Handicap, captured by
J. E. Smedley’s colt Hostile, a son of the
1928 Doncaster Handicap winner Simeon’s
Fort.
Though bred in the purple, Hostile brought
only 25 guineas as a yearling. H'is dam, Val-
teaii. is by Valais and runs back to a sister
to Emir, who proved such a fine stake-
earner for Ernest Clarke. Punters took
6 to 4 about Hap, who belongs to F. W.
Purehes, of Portsea and Patron fame; these
days Parches docs little betting. Hap is
small in stature, and the owner rightly
regarded her as overweighted at 9st. 71b.
She was never in the hunt. Copy, bred and
owned in Adelaide, led into the straight; but
Hostile and Kunopia passed her in the run
home, Hostile scoring gamely by a long
neck. Kunopia started at 20 to 1; he is
by Pantheon, and belongs to Frank Godby.
Two successive races at Ascot went to
trainers who had long experience in West-
ralia. Smedley, owner of Hostile, left
Groperland many years ago ; he did well in
Sydney a few years ago with Black Duchess.
E. B. McKeon, who landed the second divi-
sion of the Trial Handicap with Winchman,
is a more recent pilgrim from Westralia.
The greatest galloper Ernie ever handled
was Tarquin. He holds Winchman on lease
from Telford, who purchased the dam,
Clarissa (imp.), at the dispersal sale of the
late R. M. Hawker’s stud in South Aus.
Clarissa had Winchman as a foal at foot;
he is by Bold and Bad and did not sport
silk as a two-year-old.
At Ascot £5OO was hung up as prize-
money for the principal event. Such liberality

at an off-meeting is appreciated by owners
and has tended to popularise the course,
Punters declared strongly for Steve Murphy’s
candidate Harding. At the A.J.C. autumn
meetings, Murphy had tantalising luck, Maid
of Orleans having to strike her colors to
Hall Mark in two valuable juvenile races.
Fortune is continuing to frown on Murphy
and his principal jockey, Skidmore; colliding
with other horses at the start of the Five
Hundred, Harding lost a lot of ground and
Skidmore broke one of his stirrup-leathers,
The tribulations of Skidmore culminated
in suspension, for throe months for having
caused interference to Nuka Hiva when rid-
ing White Sail, the favorite, in the first
division of the Essendon Handicap, for 14.2
ponies
Harding is by Heroic. That stallion also
was represented by Eminere. Such heavy
support came for Eminere that lie 'shortened
from 8 to 1 to 9 to 2. Overhauling Belabbes
a short distance from the judge’s box, Emin-
ere scored by a length' from Belabbes and
Dunlora, two rank outsiders, who dead-
heated for second place. Belabbes belongs
to Marcus Burke, whose father, T. M. Burke,
won a Newmarket Handicap with Quintus
and a V.R.C. Grand National Hurdle with
Coybeau. Cousens, the owner-trainer of
Eminere, got a big price from Poison
for Malurys, runner-up to Salitros in the
A.J.C. Derby of 1920.
* * * *
After the fine sport at Randwick the
racing at Canterbury Park on Saturday
seemed dull. Still backers were on the spot
to a much greater extent than at Randwick,
and it was a dejected McShortodds w 7 ho
shouted his formulas after the successes of
Voyager (5 to 4), Foxhunter (10 to 9) and
Penny Hunter (5 to 2) in divisions of the
Maiden Welter, and of Craigavon (5 to 2)
in the Park Stakes. Then Wee Warrah,
winner of the Flying Handicap, was co-
favorite - at 9 to 2, with N.E.F., the runner-
up- Ro’gerson, who led from start to finish
in the Canterbury Handicap, was favorite
at 7 to 2; second favorites in Accepted (3
to 1) and'Polydorus (5 to 1) captured the
divisions of the Highweight Handicap, and
another second favorite, Australian Belle
(5 to 1), closed an imperfect day for the
ringmen by coming with a victorious run in
the Ashbury Handicap after seeming to be
hopelessly out of it. Still, the losers wouldn’t
lose a «reat deal They bet too cautiously
at “the°smalls” for that
It is useful at Canterbury to remember
the horses-for-courses maxim. Rogerson
generally runs well there; so do Accepted
and Polydorus; and Australian Belle had
shown that she likes the track. But the
neddy with a preference for a particular-
course is always liable to be downed by a
newcomer. Such was the fate of N.E.F.
in the Flying Handicap. Wee Warrah, his
conqueror, came from the “pony” courses;
he is a three-year-old bay colt by Magpie—
Valais Queen and an improving sort.
In his last three races at Canterbury
Dunerc has given the impression that, with
a better run, he would have been first instead
of merely getting a place. His supporters
were of that opinion after Wee Warrah’s
Flying Handicap, hut perhaps appearances
were deceptive. Diamond de Rouge certainly
liad an unlucky run in this race. If lie has
recaptured his fine two-year-old form, some
of these suburban handicaps should be easy
for Diamond de Rouge.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Penchiff, the Bulgar, outwrestled Walter
Browning at Leichhardt on Saturday night,
and won on points. He returned Brown-
ing’s rough stuff with interest, bringing
blood from the bigger man’s hand, mouth
and nose before making him yield to a
short-arm scissors hold in the fourth round.
More biting, kicking and punching than
wrestling were seen in the fifth. In the
sixth Browning scored with a Boston crab,
and the spectators expected the usual draw
to be declared: but it; was not to be. Pen-
chiff earned the decision, anyway, but it
probably made no difference to his share of
the takings.
Footbrawl
Good weather and huge crowds greeted
the opening of Vic. League football season
last Saturday, some 33,000 going to Carlton
Oval, where the home side entertained South
Melbourne. South had skinned the Com-
monwealth for stars, and had almost half
its team made up of other-Staters. These
played well, and but for over-impetuosity
might have gained the day. Only in the last
quarter the Southerners ran away to a 15-
point lead. The Blues’ steadiness and ex-
perience stood by them, and they slowly
hauled the others, to win by 4 points—B7
to South’s 83. Gill, Green, Crowe and
Davey did most for them; South’s best were
Reville, Meitzcke and Pratt. Another close
game thrilled 15,000 barrackers at Victoria
Park, and furnished a gate of £424. Gee-
long often beats Gollingwood on this ground,
but this time couldn’t quite manage it. The
’Woodsmen were playing five new men, but
it was only the steadiness of the older
battlers that saved them in the last quarter
.—’Wood, 99 points; Geelong, 89. Beveridge,
Edmonds and Carter shone for ’Wood; Todd,
Metherall and Collins for the Pivot. Haw-
thorn rushed St. Ivilda in the last quarter
and suatched a 2-point win—79 to St. K.’s
77 • Footscray downed its old enemy Essen-
don by a goal—77-71. Last year’s pre-
miers. Richmond, put it all over Melbourne
with 96 to 64, and North Melbourne and
Fitzroy fought a ding-dong struggle to a
draw, 79 all.
* * * *:=
“Hotham” : The operation —or non-opera-
tion—of the “Coulter law,” which forbids
the Victorian Football League clubs to make
more than fixed payments to players, con-
tinues to arouse heartburnings. At a League
meeting the other night two delegates indig-
nantly repudiated the rumor that their clubs
had offered a country player £lOO and £5 a
week to play in Melbourne. It was explained
that though the young man had left the coun-
try hurriedly to play with one of the clubs,
the suggestion that he had been heavily paid
to do so was a Langism. Delegates gener-
ally expressed their sympathy, one going so
far as to affirm that the League should be
protected against such insinuations.
* * * *
“Lilywhite”: The V.A.F A. is hot on the
trail of anyone transgressing the dogmas of
amateurism. It hoofed out ’Beckett for
taking money for playing with the Aus-
tralian XI, and he had to repent in the
equivalent of sackcloth and ashes. Lately it
pounced on Lindsay Hassett, the Victorian
cricketer, because he had accepted ss. a day
for playing with a State team against Tas-
mania. H'assett threw himself on the mercy
of the Inquisition and the auto-da-fe will not
come off.
* * * *
Both the Rugby codes in Sydney got well
into their stride on Saturday. The Rugby
Union staged the semi-final of the knock-out
competition, which this year has been placed
before instead of after the premiership tour-
nev A great go between North Sydney and
Randwick on the former’s ground resulted
in Randwick winning by 14 (3 tries,
a o-oal and a penalty goal) to 5 (a con-
verted try). The Northern forwards, who
were expected to win on the wet ground,
could not smother the fine Randwick back
division, which rose superior to conditions.
it Manly University pipped another favor-
te fo. thc final, Manly being beaten 1541 by
the students, who scored 4 tries and a
o-nfii to 9 tries a n.g. and a con-
verted^goal Here again, the backs decided
the issue. \ . .
The second round of the League premier-
ship (the first was decided on Anzac Day)
saw the premiers, South Sydney, win again,
the adversary being this time North Sydney,
and the scores 14-10. The Northerners made
a -rand fight of it, and only a great final
rally, capped by a sterling try by C. Quin-
liven brought the premiers home. As it
was, each side scored 2 tries, but Wearing
and Jones kicked four goals between them
for the winners against Schiemer’s two for
North Sydney. Other results were: Western
Suburbs 19, Balmain 19; St. George 18,
University 15; and Eastern Suburbs 22,
Npwtmvn ff
* ’ * * *
“Hooker”: Evidently the Rugby Union
folk in the western districts of N.S.W. are
sticklers for good form. The local Union
has this year passed a rule that any player
late for a game shall be. fined £l. The Union
is to be congratulated on having a member-
ship capable of finding a pound for the
luxury of being late, for, by all accounts,
quids are as scarce outback as in Sydney,
Time was when laggard players were pun-
ished by being dropped from the team, and
that was thought a searing sentence. Now
they don’t seem to care a hoot—they can
always join the Rugby League.
* * *
“Breakaway”: A feature of the N.S.W.
football season to date is the secession of a
number of notable Union players to the pro-
fessional ranks. In one or two cases this
has been due to pique at non-selection for
South Africa, but in others it has been a
case of no help for it to men keen on keeping
up their game. In the country towns tho
League code is often the only one followed.
Thus we see such a Union stalwart as
Hemingway, the University, N.S.W. and
Australian winger, stripping for a League
side in Scone, while one or two of the G.P.S.
cracks of last year have gone to the League
instead of treading the usual path to the
Union clubs. The purists may raise eye-
brows, but that matters little. Hasn’t even
the mightv Johnny Wallace, Rugby Union
captain of Oxford, Scotland and Australia,
turned out for a League team in the N.S.W.
backblocks ?
:J: * =!*
“Gate”: With the selection of the team
for England due in June, the Australian
Rugby League players have none too much
time 'to brush up condition. The opening
rounds of the N.S.W. competitions in Sydney
indicate that some of the cracks are short
of a gallop, and as selection largely depends
on being tit to meet Queensland in Sydney a
month from now there is hard work ahead.
In Brisbane the Queensland been
playing its matches for over a fortnight. The
two States are to meet in Queensland after
the touring team has been chosen, and the
combination will sail from Sydney on July 4
* * * *
“Yarker” : The English Rugby League has
been quick to seize the chance of establish-
ing its game on the Continent afforded by
the refusal of the British R. U. authorities
to re-admit France to the international fold.
A strong move is afoot to win the French
Union over to the professional code, and two
.representative North of England teams are
to play a couple of games in France. I he
French Union has also been invited to see
the final of the R. L. Cup played at Wembley.
For a couple of years or so this match has
been staged in the South of England in the
hope of its finding favor with the R.U. and
Soccer public there. So far the propaganda
has fallen flat, hut the French visitors may
bite.
* * * *
The British Association Cup, the blue
ribbon of the Soccer world, was won this
year by the old Liverpool club _ Everton.
Manchester City was the opposition, the
“Toffoomakers” getting home by 3-0. There
were 92,000 spectators at Wembley, _ This
is Evorton’s second win, the first being in
1905-06. Manchester City’s only victory was
in 1903-04.
... * *
The N.S.W. Soccor side made a horrible
mess of Queensland in Brisbane, winning
by 10 goals to 4, a huge score in the round-
hall game. It might have been larger if
the visitors had gone all out. for the home
side was hopelessly outclassed.
(Continued on page 30.)
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: The decision of the Inter-
national Tennis Federation that a harder
ball must be used throughout the world, com-
mencing from January 1 next, will oe
received with satisfaction by Australian ana
joritish players, who use a harder ball tnan
America or France. • The variation in uii -
ferent countries makes a lot of difterencr
to visiting players, and was given by tne
Americans as one of tlie explanations tor
failing to strike form right away when in
Australia recently. A notable case is tnat
of Coehet, who is a rabbit at Wimbledon
with the harder ball, hut a different proposi-
tion with the French article on the hard
courts across the Channel.
* * * - *
“Cash Amateur”: In addition to banning
open tournaments for professionals ana
amateurs, the international tennis author’
lies have confirmed the decision of tne
Davis Cup committee that no reinstated pro-
fessional shall be allowed to take part m
Davis Cup games. This was made hast year
when Italy hastily reinstated Gaslini as an
amateur and then rang him into their Davis
Cup team. Whitewashed players may, how-
ever. take part in other international tourna-
ments provided they are qualified otherwise.
“Cash Amateur”: Reported that Coehet
has for some time been engaged on making
a tennis talkie. Presumably he lias accepted
payment therefor, and, if so, it would seem
that he has endangered his amateur status.
Bobby Jones was professionalised when he
made a golf picture for the movies, and what
difference there is between golf and tennis in
this respect is hard to see. The French are
sticklers for amateurism in sport, and it will
be interesting to see if they take any action
agiainst the indispensable Coehet. __
“Cut Shot”: As expected, the proposal
that net-cord shots should count as
and be played again, has been opposed
by most of the European tennis organisa-
tions. Delegates have been. instructed to tins
effect at the annual meeting of the Inter-
national Tennis Federation. The proposed
alteration is a manifest absurdity, seeing
that it would tend to still further minimise
the element of luck which rule-hounds are
doing their best to eliminate from every
game in spite of the fact that it adds to their
attraction.
(Continued on page 30. )
The 41st. battle between the N.S.W. Great
Public Schools for the Head-of-the-River
title came off on the Parramatta on Satur-
day. The big event, the eight-oared race for the
Rennie Trophy, was taken by St. Josephs,
victorious last year. North Shore Grammar
was second, nine feet away, and Sydney
Grammar third. Sydney High School
whipped in. The race was a fine one. At
100 yards from the line Shore looked cer-
tain winners. Their final effort faded and
St. Joseph s, magnificently stroked by G.
Elias, caught and passed the leaders in the
last 30 yards. This is Joeys fourth win
in the series, which began in 1910. Ihe first
fours for the Yaralla Cup were won by Syd-
ney High, stroked by F. Gray. Scots Col-
lege got away with the second fours, with
R. J. Trimble facing the cox.
* " ‘ ,
“Bouragr : Even those who hold the
Board of Control in grateful remembrance
for the great work it did m cleaning up the
international side of the game m its early
days have been staggered by its latest step
in fatuity. It has adopted and recommended
to Marylebone a new rule making the umpire
sole judge of what constitutes bowling at
the man instead of the wicket. .In effect
the unfortunate official will have to decide
wdiether a bowler_ is chucking them down
with intent to intimidate the batsman and.
if so, to call no ball. If, in the officials
opinion, the offence is repeated, the bowler
may be ordered to stop bowling. ihe rule
is impossible of application. No umpire on
earth can read a bowler’s mind and on a
bad wicket—or a good one either, tor that
matter—decide at once that there is evil
intent there. Such a rule will give the fat-
headed sort of umpire a deadly weapon
which may lead to all sorts ot unfortunate
happenings. A conscientious man will hare
yet another mind-racking anxiety added to
the stock he carries to the wickets with him
already. As to the type _of bowling aimed
at it may be safely stated that it will pass
almost at once. Any attempt to introduce it
in England on the fines exploited m Aus-
tralia last season will be quenched in a general
storm of indignation. People with shoi
memories might recall what happened m
England less when Bo.es

A CHANCE FOR LANG
“What a chance for Mr. Lang,” says ‘‘The
Barrier Miner,” referring to the Referendum.
According to the famous Broken Hill daily
Mr. Lang and his supporters, if they want to
abolish the Upper House, should vote “Yes”
with all their strength. If this bill is carried,
the consent of the Upper House will never
again be required for its abolition! The first
time Labor gets a majority it can pass an
abolition bill and then carry it by a referendum
within three months! AIL. abolitionists- ought,,
to ponder over this advice from Broken Hill.

“Preston” : Tlie Victorian Football Asso-
ciation is feeling the pinch of the hard times,
which is accentuated by the ever-increasing
prestige of its wealthy League rival. rve
cently it decided to raise admission fees to
help club revenues, for most clubs are losing
on their matches. As a sideline, clubs
have been permitted to run raffles on the
grounds for all sorts of things from a pound
uote to a pair of scanties. Now the police
have intervened; at Prahran they took the
names of all and sundry concerned m the
flutter.
“Fitzcray”: Last week a proposal that the
Vie. League cancel its ban on playeis desn-
ing to join up with the Association was nar-
rowly defeated. An alternative motion that,
the ban be lifted from all but the first dis-
trict. teams was passed, however, and it is
now up to the Association to do a bit ot
back-scratching.

“C.A.”: The V.A.F.A. has caused, a stir
bv protesting against the granting of
the use of Melbourne Amateur Sports
Ground to professional bodies. The ground
is a Government grant vested in trus-
tees and was instituted for the use ol
amateurs only. For some time it has
been leased for professional football, and the
lease is to be renewed in spite ot the ip-Ot
that the amateur body, with some I*6o
registered players in Melbourne, has asked
for at least partial use of it. The Minister
in charge is to be worded on the matter, but
the amateurs will probably be fobbed off. In
Sydney the same thing occurred in con-
nection with the Sydney Cricket Ground,
founded for amateur sports but leased for
a long period at one time to the professional
Rugby League.
# # * *
“Rover”: The N.S.W., Austrlian footballers
have received an invitation to send a team to
Queensland just before the start of the Aus-
tralian “carnival” at Sydney in August.
Whether the trip will be made depends on
the funds likely to be available and the
Bananalanders are to be asked to supply an
estimate of net receipts. If possible, the Ma
Staters should go up, for a couple of games
against Queensland would be a useful trial
run for the State side.
* * * *
“Birkenhead Park”: The departure of the
Wallabies for South Africa has been marked
by one piece of good fortune —this is being
written before they play in Vic., so I touch
wood. None of the 30 chosen last season has
been incapacitated, though they played to
the end of the 1932 period and in preliminary
games this year. Australia’s only experience
of South African football was in 1921, when
the Rugby Union was rebuilding in N.S.W.
—it had gone to tlie wall in Queensland and
Victoria—after putting up the shutters dur-
ing the war. The visiting ’Boks licked
N.S.W. 25-10, 16-11 and 28-9. A Sydney
metropolitan side was also beaten 14-8. That
’Bok team won 15 of its 19 matches in
Maoriland. Each side won a Test; the
third was drawn.
* * * *
“Maroon”: Reference to the sporting
action of the South African Rugby Union in
footing the bill for the playing outfits oE
the Wallabies (B. 26/4/’33) makes me wish
something of the sort prevailed in the ama-
teur code when Queensland and N.S.W.
clashed in annual encounters with each other
or the All Blacks. In those days club
players found their own outfit, while all the
baksheesh stuff representative players, got
was a State guernsey and a pair of stockings,
the player finding all the rest, including
boots and pocket money. Fares, housing
and washing were paid for by the Union
acting as host. Daily cash allowances were
rigidly banned. Yet, somehow, the most im-
pecunious of us managed the trips to N.S.W.
or Queensland and M.L.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: The infant South Australian
Rugby Union starts its first competition sea-
son this week with five senior clubs, and
others are forming. The new Union is for-
tunate in that it has four grounds available,
three of them being leased by the clubs, while
the other is to be allotted for practice to the
landless club, Waratahs. University can do
its training on the Uni. Oval, so the handi-
cap of proper training areas which the Vic-
torian Union experienced on its revival some
years ago will not hamper the progress of the
game in Adelaide. Inter-State matches are
the next question, and Victoria is expected
to come into the picture here.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Sec.”: Players of games are notoriously
shaky about rules. Golfers must be awarded
the silver putter. There is some excuse, for
them, for the laws of the Royal and Antient
are as full of traps as an Act of Parlia-
ment. One of these caught J. A. Pickup, of
Queensland, after tying with another for
the Goodna Anzac Cup. A band was playing,
and Pickup and his partner stood aside at
the eighteenth to listen to the music, and
so let contestants behind them pass through.
Later he discovered that the pause infringed
rule 2 of the special rule for stroke compe-
titions, and though his card had been handed
in and accepted by the committee, Pickup
withdrew from the tourney.
* * * *
“Fitzroy”: Rockhampton, where once the
only pastime was the annual race week, com-
plicated by Calcutta sweeps and hazard at
night, is nowadays wholly given over to
golf. The other day. the town was flung
wide open for the Rocky golf club’s first
tourney, and the nobility and gentry from
surrounding dorps and even Brisbane flocked
in. The chief item was the C.Q. “open.”
This went to J. Taylor, who returned a card
of 163, eight strokes better than A. K.
McLeod, who ran second. The girls were
not forgotten, either, there being five events
on the programme for them.

“Divot Digger” : One of the best-situated
of recently-formed N.S.W. golf clubs is Gos-
ford. Its Victoria Park course is practi-

cally in the town and is picturesque in its
surroundings of mountain and forest. Nine
holes are in use at present, but the club,
which numbers some 60 members and 50
associates, and has spent close on £2OO on
the course, hopes later to extend it to full
length. The official opening is to come when
the" greens and fairways have shaken down.
*** * *
“Brassey” : Not to be beaten by Victoria,
N.S.W. has produced a promising kid golfer
who is a left-hander, Davies, who joined
Cammeray as a junior a month or so ago.
He was given a 18 handicap, but the prun-
ing-knife had to be applied from his. first
few rounds. He capped all by finishing 5
up on par in a competition from the 6 mark;
his stroke rounds were 33-33. If the young-
ster keeps this up he will extend Williams
one of these days.
* * * *
“Ca’ Canny”: The N.S.W. Golf Council,
which has been hanging off charging admis-
sion fees to matches for fear it might
be taxed on the takings, recently referred
the question to the income-tax authorities.
The reply is, in effect, that profits derived
from charges made for watching golf after
expenses have been deducted are taxable at
company rates. The exemption at present
granted to golf clubs is only relevant in
respect of revenue derived from members
only The department adds that “it is under-
stood” that the said revenue is derived from
members only. At that showing the exorbi-
tant green fees charged by some clubs to
visitors are taxable —if so, loud cheers ; the
rate ought to be 100 per cent.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin” : Britain won its first match
in the Davis Cup European zone comfort-
ably enough, beating Spain at Barcelona by
four matches to one. Austin and Perry took
all their singles events, but Perry and
Hughes were downed in the doubles. '' itii
Germany, England was considered a probable
winner of the European zone, leaving Aus-
tralia on one side, but the elimination of
Prenn from the German team leaves the
Hitlerites without a hope. Australia was
to have engaged in a gallop with the Eng-
lishmen in the English liard-courts cham-
pionships at Bournemouth this week before
meeting Norway in this country’s opening
Davis Cup tie.
sj: $ * *
“Cut Shot” : Australia is represented by a
couple of women players in the English
liard-courts championships now in progress
at Bournemouth. Mrs. Crawford is the
official banner-holder, while Miss Wilson, one
of the best of the N.S.W. country players,
is appearing as a freelance, permission hav-
iug been granted her by the Australian
authorities to act as offsider. A pity the
dashing Joan Hartigan could not make the
trip, for the field is an international one,
including, as it does, Helen Jacobs, of
Yankeedom, and Madame Mathieu, the
French cliampionette.
“Goy” : The more one considers the idiotic
elimination of Prenn from the German Davis
Cup team, because he is of Jewish descent,
the more unfortunate does the happening
appear for Germany. Prenn and Von Cramm
were the most formidable couple in Europe
last season, and won the final of the Euro-
pean zone. With a bit better luck they
would have beaten America for the right to
challenge France for the Cup. Both downed
Shields in the opening singles and Yon
Cramm had the match point from Vines in
the third when he threw it away.
Car and Cycle
“Montlhery”: It is likely that Australia
may yet see the aero-engined Enterprise (B.
26/4/’33) in action on Lake George in an
attempt on Malcolm Campbell's motor-speed
record of 272 m.p.h. Wizard Smith, who.

for the full length will be necessary, tena

Miscellaneous
“Blade” • G.P.S. rowing so obscures the
race for the King’s Cup that people in
Melbourne and Sydney are indifferent
to the fact that the blue ribbon of Aus
tralian rowing will be battled for at Bns
bane this week. All the States except West-
ralia will be represented, the Gropers being
excused the trip across the continent, as
Queensland is when the venue is the Swan
River. On paper. Victoria, last year s winner,
looks the most formidable of the crews. This
will be the ninth inter-State race to be held
on the Brisbane River since the inter-State
series began in 1878. Victoria has won foui
times and Tasmania twice with Queensland
and South Australia credited with a race
apiece. ...
“Shrewsbury” : In July next America is
staging an international regatta for eights
on the Long Beach course in California,
which was used for the rowing events at
the Los Angeles Olympiad. In addition to
inviting the Cambridge University crew it
is hoped that the Italian Olympic eight will
compete. The U.S. navy will boat a crew,
as will Yale, Cornell, Washington and Cali-
fornia. It is too late in the day to think of
sending a crew from this side, but, by all
accounts, one would have been welcomed.

“Aigburtli”: The star turn in English
cricket this season will be provided by Aus-
tralia’s old friends the eullud gemmen from
the West Indies. The side is skippered by
Grant the captain in Australia, and that
great ’batsman George Headley will again
be the batting attraction. Constantine will
be co-opted when possible, though the Lan-
cashire League club which employs him will
not guarantee his release, even for the lests.

“Gregory Terrace” : Brisbane is to have an
additional sports arena. The City _ Council
is laying out a new area in Victoria Bark,
where the municipal golf links and tan-ride
have proved a great success; there will be
three ovals for cricket, football anu other
sports. The big park was once a bare waste
given over to stray cows and wandering
lovers.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre of Queensland
Distinguished Social Life.
After having had a week to sort them
out, what impressions of this year’s Anzac
Day remain with us? Hitherto for a good
many years the Sydney demonstrations have
left this Letter only sad and rebellious. The
blare of trumpets could not drown the cry
of workless Diggers who were losing hope;
the smile of welcome to old mates could not
cover the of remembering homes
where want had gained the victory. A week
ago this Letter almost persuaded itself that
the best place on Anzac Day was either at
home or at some League of Peace meeting.
It took 55 minutes for the procession to
pass any point; and not five of them had
slipped by before one realised that somehow
this year things were diffex-ent. Ah yes,
there wei’e still a few broken boots and
shabby coats; but for the most part the
marching Diggers, well dressed again, held
themselves as proudly and confidently as they
did even in those first wonderful weeks after
the home-coming.
The day broke grey and chill, but not too
grey or chill for those who would keep vigil
with the Anzacs in that last half-hour before
the immortal storming of Gallipoli. Eight
thousand men and women and children were
in Martin-place for the service at dawn—hun-
dreds of them were there gathered about the
Cenotaph an hour, two hours, before. A
bugle note like a spear of light cut through
the grey, the Governor placed the wreath
from the Australian Legion. Then came Ihe
Lord’s Px-ayer murmured by thousands of
lips. There was comfort and a feeling of
security in it against the powers of war,
the powers of evil.
The really touching bit of the day’s pro-
cession was when that great company of sol-
diers swept into Martin-place. The bands
were silenced, the marchers’ heads were
bared, the lines of eights divided, and, four
on each side of the flower-decked, wreath-
hung memorial to their fallen comrades, the
Diggers passed—-twenty thousand or more of
them. Twenty thousand or more, the flesh
of them walking through Martin-place, bxxt
on what far fields and hillsides was the spirit
of each keeping tryst!
Up into King-street they stepped, some, of
the Diggers and Anzacs not so old-looking
as the sentimentalists about silver hair
would have us believe —-how could they be
when many of them slipped into soldiering
in their teens and early twenties? In the
Domain a long-drawn murmur of. sympathy
surged on the arrival of the long line of cars
bearing the disabled men, many of whom
would never again march in any procession.
Eighty thousand people were massed around
the barriers, on the slopes, even seated afar
off in the boughs of trees, praying with
fervor, singing with a spiritual exaltation,
with a faith as persistent as the Eternal
Mercy, “Lead, Kindly Light.” Another side
of Sydney, the gay, the irresponsible!
The Country Women’s Association is only
11 yeai-s old, yet its membership is shaping
towards the 15,000. It has assets to the
value of £68,334; last year it raised £14,000
for its activities and establishments, and
gave £9OOO t-o charities. Most flourishing
sign of all, it has 103 younger sets. The
Q.W.A. was deep in its yearly conference
last week, and these are some of the high
lights of its .success plucked from an amaz-
ing record of good service to the woman out-
back.
More than 260 branches were represented
at- the councils in the auditorium of David
Jones’s, and the 300-odd delegates who signed
the roll came from every comer of the State,
from Victoria and from Queensland. Mrs.
Matt Sawyer, State president, was in the
chair, and went about her job with a neat-
ness and dispatch that wouldn’t be amiss
in Geneva. Mrs. Graham Mylne, president
of Queensland’s C.W.A., spoke in an inter-
esting and concise manner of the work in
that State. An important outcome of Mrs.
A. Ross’s (Glen lunes) suggestion is that
a sort of Fascist semaphoring with the right
hand is to be adopted by N.S.W. as its form
of salutation. This is already the C.W.A.
greeting in the northern State. Mrs. Hubert
Fairfax was another speaker who claimed
the ear, but it was the treasurer (Miss S. F.
Warby) reading the satisfactory financial
statement who sounded even as the coo-ing
of doves to the assemblage, especially when
she got to the bit about the general income
and expenditure account showing a surplus
of £533 for the year.
Mention was made in recent cables of the
English wife of the Russian Commissar for
Foreign Affairs, M. Litvinoff. The lady is
a daughter of the late Sir Sidney Low, who
came of a somewhat remarkable Hungarian-
Jewish family. His father, Maximilian Low,
fled from Hungary with Kossuth and settled
in England with his numerous offspring.
One of his daughters was editress of the
“Queen” when that paper was nearly as great
a power in the land as Queen Victoria her-
self ; another was a Raphael Tuck artist of
note; a son (brother of Sidney) was on a
now-defunct paper, the “Globe,” and mar-
ried a daughter of Colonel Valentine Baker
after that gallant soldier had lost prestige
through a scandal of sorts with a girl in a
railway carriage. Another son, Herbert
Low, came to Australia and linked up with
the “Argus” and later with the ‘ S.M.H.,
with which paper he had a lawsuit and
lost it. He died some years ago in Sydney.
Madame Litvinoff is a charming young Yid
who married her husband in London. Her
father, Sidney Low, was a Balliol (Oxford)
man and a barrister, a lecturer at London
University, a sometime editor of the “Stand-
ard,” and a prolific writer on constitutional
and historical subjects.
The scheme for helping the kiddies of the
Far West to better health which the Rev.
Drummond and his wife, started is gaining in
popularity. The Far West Ball in aid of general
funds brought over 500 dancers to the.Blax-
land Galleries the other night. This is one
of the pet philanthropies of the Governor
and Lady Game, and they both came along
to take the bobs of the five debs. (Oh, no;
nothing to do with rattling a collection-box.)
Mayoress Hagon’s black lace frock threw into
relief the blue and gold brocade of Lady Game
and the wine-red velvets worn by Mrs. Drum-
mond, who was with her husband the official
receiver of the night. General Ivan Mackay
and his wife, the Moncrieff Barron couple,
Dr. Elma Sandford Morgan, the Grammar
School Dettmanns and the General Herring
pair were among the bright crowds dancing
and bridging the affair to success. Leonie
Bond was the secretary: Mrs. H. T. Armi-
tage the treasurer.
When broadcasting station 2UW sought
the perfect radio voice no fewer than 600
aspirants en-
tered for the
com petition.
Gradually the
GOO were win-
nowed down
to 60, the 60
to 20, and
then the list-,
eners-in ha d
the last say.
Overwhelming-
ly they de-
cided in favor
of Mrs. Hope
luttor, the
iady of this
picture. Be-
fore her mar-
riage, Mrs.
SuttOr was
Hope Mayne,
and in her
very early
flapper days
she acted with the Titheradge girls under
the direction of their famous father, who
was almost a fanatic in his devotion to
faultless pronunciation and clear enuncia-
tion. More recently Mrs. Suttor has been
known for her work with the old Repertory
Society.
Without doubt the Victoria Leaguers put
on the best-dressed party of last week. But
even good clothes and the Australia Hotel
background couldn’t make a dashing func-
tion of it. It was a nice friendly affair with-
out any hard varnish, and the speeches by
Padre Micklem, Miss Macarthur Onslow and
the Sheldon lady were interesting because
they spoke of the work of the League, which
they all know thoi’oughly. The principal guests
were Lady Allardyce and Mr. and Mrs. Han-
bury Tracy. Mrs. H. T. is a daughter of the
late Chief-Justice Darley, and she and Lady
Allardyce are members of the League’s cen-
tral council in London. Admiral and Mrs.
Napier from England and Doctor Micklem’s
wife were other importants in the afternoon.
Violets seemed to he the popular flower;
bunches of them were fastened to the furs
or coat lapels of innumerable women. During
Race Week it was lily-of-the-valley that cap-
tured the sex’s fancy.
The women’s committee of Sydney Grammar
had the excellent notion of holding its annual
dance oil the night of Boatrace Day. Hundreds
of Grammarians, young and middle-aged,
gathered in the Blaxland Galleries, hung with
the school’s hlack and gold ribbons, and head-
master Dettmann and his wife held quite a
little court. There was nothing partisan,
however, about the younger set of Prince
Alfred’s. They decorated the ballroom of
the Automobile Club, where their regatta
dance was held, with the colors of the nine
G.P.S.’s.
Last Saturday Rose Bay Golf Club was
turned as nearly as possible into a bit of
Japan, with Japanese flags and lanterns, bowls
of iris and chrysanthemum, when Japan’s
Consul-General and Mrs. Murai held a recep-
tion in honor of their Emperor’s birthday.
The invitation list included naval and mili-
tary heads, political, civic, banking, railway,
shipping and merchant brass-hats. The aca-
demics were not overlooked, and Consuls
were present by the dozen. The spoken
tongue must have been even more varied
than at Mrs. Staal’s party for the Spivakov-
skys, when no fewer than seven languages
were going at the same time. There was
no saki served at the Japanese party this
year, rather to the regret of the women
guests, who love handling the little saki
cups, but the sight of the pretty little niece
of tlie Consul’s lady leading off the dance
with the Admiral —she in her national dress,
he very upstanding in all his trimmings—
more than compensated.
Australia and Maoriland are always being
told how much better things of the stage
and art are done at the other end of the
world; and when we refuse to develop the
inferiority complex we are liable to be told
that we are bumptious know-nothings. At
last week’s Royal Academy 14 paintings by
Australian artists (Charlie Bryant had the
full allowance of three) were hung. On the
stage Maoriland is a winner. Hear the
critic of London “Truth” :
I confess to finding it hard to write with any
sort of restraint about Miss Marie Ney’s artistry in
this play (“The Lake” at the Westminster Theatre],
Her playing of a most difficult part has tremendous
sincerity and power, and is, without exception, the
finest piece of acting I have seen a woman give in
the last ten years.
Marie is a product of Wellington (M.L.),
and won her stage experience in Australia
with Allan Wilkie and Marie Tempest.
“The Chatterboxes” are a group of ama-
teurs who have been playing for charity for

To - night
(Wednesday)
and to-morrow
the company
is putting on
“S m i 1 i n'
Through” in the Aslifield Town Hall. John
Ryan is the producer, and Rene Perkins,
the subject of this Raymond Sawyer photo.,
the secretary.
This Letter will never again receive greet-
ing from its old friend Martin Carrick at
the Town Hall. His day’s work began before
six o’clock in the morning, and often mid-
night saw him still on deck. He had served
under 30 mayors.
There was a peculiarly alluring green
tropical fruit on one of the stalls at the
District Nursing fete in the Town Hall the
other day. Asked what it was called the
lady behind the stall said, “Well, we call
them Jacks —of course, it’s not their proper
name —and they’re lovely to eat, but when
you’re eating them it’s best to hold your
nose.” This Letter is wondering ever since
if they’re the fruit that gave playwright
Turner the hint for the “Man Who Ate the
Popomac.” Custard apples, persimmons and
pomegranates were heaped on the stalls
flanking the entrance to the Town H’all, and
here hung grapes of a plumpness unbeliev-
able.
The stall presided over by Lady Game
(she w r as sensibly tied up in a holland apron
during its arranging) had tiers of corncobs
and pumpkin and melon in their rich autumn
toning, leading up to masses of chrysanthe-
mums, zinnias and roses. Mayoress Hagon
and daughter Margaret helped here, as did

Warrawee was all roses, and Pymble mostly
autumn leaves.
The Town Hall wasn’t crowded, but those
who were there looked as though they had
come prepared to spend. The Governor
opened the show, whose riches had been
drawn from Moss Yale, Camden, the Moun-
tains, Epping and Canberra. Police Com-
missioner Childs, who in his off-time is appar-
ently a successful gardener, sent roses ; from
Government House came bowls of cut flowers

Last Saturday about 80,000 of Sydney s
normally sane citizens shouted and shrieked
and trumpeted themselves into a frenzy. 1
was Boatrace Day, and all the vantage
points along the Parramatta were swarmni,,
with fathers and mothers, .. sisters and
brothers, aunts, uncles and girl wnds o
the different crews. On the watei there
was every sort of craft from terry to c|noe,
all laden with more barrackers for High
and Shore, Joeys, Grammar and Scot.
Every man, woman and clnld ,^P ort(
the colors of one of the G.l .S. s. ana
these were a blur of gaiety under the. leaden
sky, for the day was grey and. rain-washed.
There were stamping and cheering and roai.
along the mile and a half rowed by the
eights, and just the last bit of the ™ before
Joeys finally drew away from Shore the
earth on both sides of the river from Walkei
Hospital to .Cabarita was nearly rent
asunder by the raging tornado of excitement
The frocking of “Petticoat Influence, the
Independents’ production at the Savoy last
Saturday, was equal to that of any J. C. \\ il
liamson show. Heroine Molly Brown wears
three creations in pink, salvia red and spring
leaf green. The first was princess style and
clung like a limpet till just above the knees,
when it billowed forth a souffle of chiffons.
A great chou of the chiffon frothed at the
high waistline, and a little be-ruclied shoulder
cape and pink velvet shoes were finishing
touches. In the second act the red aftei-
noon frock was worn with a small size m
forage-cap millinery and black velvet gloves ,
in the third the quiet waters of achievement
(the lady had landed her husband a Gover-
nor’s job in some Pacific island) are sug-
gested by the cool green of her long slim
raiment. Nor was Nancy Stuart Gurr, the
other girl in the boil-over, left behind as far
as looks or clothes are concerned. She was
first superior in green, next agitated m dano-
dil yellows and thirdly reassured in white.
An interesting feature of the exhibition
of British contemporary art has been the
series of lectures. Christopher Perkins
Thea Proctor and Gladys Owen have all
said their say to a galleryful of appreciative
listeners.

uniform, placed his wreath upon the Shrine shortly
before 11 o’clock. Assistant Defence Minister
Francis, the naval and military heads, Premiei

musical programme. Anzac Day lunches were gnen
at many churches and church halls. All day Brisbane
echoed to the tramp of marching men; many of the
women were in black.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
A White Man on Rossel Island
“Gad” (from Rossel Island, alongside
Papua) : I share this tropical island with
about 1200 natives and four whites. The
whites are my employer, his wife and two
children, who live some 12 miles away; so
I see them only about once a month. Once a
month also I see the skipper of the schooner
which brings our mail.
Of the 1200 natives with whom I share
the island I am most concerned with Dali,
lie is my cookboy, and I chose him because
I fancied he was the sort from whom one
could extract information. I pictured Dah
standing behind me at mealtimes, telling me
the history of Rossel Island, and talking
about native customs, and supplying handy
conversational phrases in the Ideal tongue.
But in respect of these matters Dah is dumb,
for he is a sophisticated savage who has
been to Port Moresby 'and has been in a
motor-car. He can tell the time by a clock
—within an hour or so. And he speaks
English (actually he understands about three-
quarters of one per cent, of Avhat you’re
talking about, and slightly less of Avhat he’s
talking about). So now my conversation
Avith Dah is confined to such remarks as
“Yes,” “No” and “Kai-kai.”
Apart from Dah, I come in principal con-
tact with 24 plantation boys. For 51 days
in the week my duty lies in seeing that these
fellows work. To simplify matters I work
Avith them. It saves a lot of urging. I sit
in their midst with a knife and scoop copra
out of the nuts, just as they do; or I go
out with a hook-knife and cut grass Avith
them; or assist in the picking up of nuts.
You can do these things in the tropics and
be healthier for it.
For 54- days in the week my 24 plantation
boys occupy nearly all my conscious moments.
If they fall sick I have to guess what’s
wrong with them and feed them the appro-
priate medicine. If they develop sores (and
they can develop ghastly-looking sores) I
apply ointments. I issue tobacco to them and
see that their tucker is properly drawn out
over the appropriate period, and generally
am boss, father and physician in one. They
are, of course, grandsons of cannibals, but
hardly any tradition of what they did in a
golden olden age lingers with them.
On the afternoon of the sixth day in every
Aveek my boys fold their smoke paper (they
cannot, they have discovered, “smoke” The
Bulletin), tobacco and betel-nut in little
native, baskets, and silently steal aAvay. Over
the hills, along beaches, through scattered
jungle paths, they wend their several Avays
to homes and villages to spend the week-end.
In this phase they pass beyond my ken. I
have no idea at all what a Rossel boy does
on his week-ends, hut I suspect that the
background of this life is peopled mostly by
those almost phaOtom-like creatures who
flit every now and then across the edge of
my . vision—the women of Rossel. They go
entirely unornamented. Their heads' are
shaven. They add nothing to what God gave
them save a brief pandanus-leaf skirt. They
are entirely unmoral, from our point of view,
but when in the neighborhood, of the island’s
one Avhite bachelor they generally make a
concession to modesty by taking a wide
detour.
These people possess a language of their
own which, so far, no white man has ever
mastered. It has never been expressed in
writing, and. like all unwritten languages, is.
I imagine, in a constant state of flux. I
can learn Avords, but I doubt whether I
shall ever learn the language. Yet the effort
must be made; for whatever story these
people have to tell is expressible only in
their own tongue.
It isn’t all fun to wear a crown. The
Queen of England saw her first taikie only
a foAv Aveeks ago.
Woolwortlis, who run the English sixpenny
shops, say that over 90 p.c. of their goods

But taxes cut deep into profits—£946,ooo
was set aside last year to pay them.
Maoriland’s richest under-the-water acre is
known amongst fishermen as the North Reef,
and is 16 miles beyond Taiaroa Heads. The
reef was discovered some 28 years ago, and
for years it cropped £lOO a day in gropex*,
kingfish. bass and bream. At first it was
inaccessible in rough weather, but the big
powerful launches of to-day can face weather
that the old whaleboats could not look at.
Aboxxt half a million pounds’ worth has been
landed from the North Reef and the going
is still good.

A master baker tells the Maoriland Dairy
Boai-d how to help the hard-hit cow-keeping
industry. He, suggests that legislation be
introduced making compxxlsory the use of fxxll-
cream milk in equal quantity with water for
mixing with floui-, thus setting up an annual
demand for 1,000,009 gallons of milk in M.L.
alone, equal to 15,000 tons of butter. The
moi-e nutritious bread would, he thinks,
justify an extra Id. on a 41b. loaf.

Thei-e are not many manufacturing cos. in
Britain these days that- pay a 124 p.c. div.,
but Nairns, who make linoleums,. and who
joined Meggitt’s to cari-y on the business in
Axxstralia, is one of them. They reported at
their meeting in England that “the pros-
pects of the Aus-
tralian subsidiary arc
distinctly brighter
than they were a

The Duke of Saxe-
Cobxxrg Gotha, who
fought oxx the Gei--
man side in the war,
has been staging
with the King and
Queen at Sandring-
ham. This is the
first time such a
visit has taken place
since the war. The
Duke is “the old
Queen's” grandson—
Victoria, of coxirsc,
being “the old
Queen.”
A correspondent at
New Orleans tells a
story of a New Zea-
lander, whose name
is said to be Lowell
Yerex, who had a re-
markable experience
in a war that has
been going on in
Honduras (Central
America). He was:
in the Nationalist
forces, in command
of a flight of four
flying-machines. A
rebel bullet hit him
in the face, blinding
his right eye and
fracturing his skull; yet, thus terribly
injured, he flew -the 25 miles to a base hos-
pital, and landed safely.
What a V.C. is worth —the actual medal —
depends to some extent on-whose it was; but
the pretty regular price in London is £25
to £3O. One, gained at Delhi in ’57, was
sold lately at the latter figure. Also, in
London, almost at the same time, two Strad.
violins were sold—one (1725) for £2300;
the other (1714) for £BOO.
“Klondyke Bob” (Robert Henderson),
whom scores of Australian visitors to Van-
couver have met, the discoverer of alluvial
gold on the Yukon (1896), has just died.
He didn’t make a fortune.

Ernest White, owner of Bluff Downs
(N.Q.), and well known for the high-class
beef cattle he breeds, is going to get first-
hand information about zebus. He has left
for Texas (U.S.A.), and intends putting in
some time on a ranch where the zebu types
are said to have given satisfaction. If the
owner of Bluff Downs is satisfied, he intends
to import bulls and cows. But the Govern-
ment will be in first, having purchased 17
of the breed.
The newest air service in the Southern
Hemisphere is between Melbourne and Laun-
ceston (Tas.), calling at Flinders Island on
the out and at King Island on the home jour-
ney. The round trip will be completed in

is the head of the co., which has bought the
Southern Star, a 10-seater, began his flying
career in 1912 with No. 2 Squadron, R.F.C.;
he went to France “at the outbreak,” and
was one of the not-very-many in Australia
who were in the heart-breaking retreat from
Mons. His co.’s hangar is at Essendon;
they have been doing general taxi work fox-
six years.

“F.R.” (Hollywood) : Eily Malyon, who
came to Australia first with -‘The Witness
for the Defence” and “Lady Frederick,” is
here in Hollywood, in pretty constant de-
mand for austere aunts or slightly sinister
housekeepers. An Australian I see floating
round is Arthur Shirley, as handsome as
ever, despite Anno Domini. He has had
trouble with the immigration authorities,
and spent some time languishing in a gaol
in company with negroes and deadbeats. If
we had a Minister at Washington, that
would be a subject to take up diplomatically.
Jan Rubinx and his wife, Adele Crane, were
amused lately at receiving cuttings from
Australian papers announcing their divorce.
The fact is they are regarded with some
scorn as the least unstuck couple in Holly-
wood. Jan has a high position in the
“colony” axid is genei-ally leading some high-
class orchestra. Adele’s voice is still de-
lightful.

Japan, with her abundant and cheap elec-
tric power, has made great strides in the
establishment of plants for the electrolytic
refining of metals. She now has six electro-
lytic copper works, with a total annual
output of 76,400 short tons of copper and
320,0000 z. of fine gold; two plants are pro-
ducing electrolytic zinc, their aggregate out-
put being 4000 tons per annum; the produc-
tion of other metals is lead, 4000 tons; tin,
1000 tons ; bismuth, 50 tons ; magnesium, 50
tons.
There have been some remarkable develop-
ments in flotation since Vincent Potter-, of
Block 14, took out the first patent in 1901.
It is now possible to float, in stages, four
or five separate minerals fi-om the one ore,
making excellent recoveries in all cases, and
to prepare concentrates of a wide range of

non-metallic minerals. In America 36 mil-
lion tons of ore was treated by flotation in
140 plants during 1931. The principal re-
agents used were lime, 113 million pounds;
sulphuric acid,. 11 million pounds; copper
sulphate, 3,000,000 pounds; coal-tar oils, 6.5
million pounds. On many _ plants the re-
agents used do not exceed 51b. per ton. Tin
oxide is about the only important metallic
mineral that cannot be satisfactorily floated.
Still, by the use of oleic acid, from 1 p.c.
tine ore a 25 p.c. concentrate can be made.

“Pingalapa”: Modernisation is threaten-
ing one of the most picturesque adjuncts of
the gorgeous Bast and other places, like South
Africa, which have imitated its invention of
the rickshaw. Coventry reports having re-
ceived large orders from Japan for motor-
fitted rickshaws, .which are now being turned
out. With the motor-rickshaw an accom-
plished fact it would seem a new name must
be found for if. The full name of the old
two-wheeled gadget is “jinricksha,” which is
literally translated “one-man-power-vehicle.”

An American firm has been compiling statis-
tics of the amounts .spent by motorists. Two
thousand repair tickets collected from many
service stations showed that for every dollar
(4s. 2d.) spent by drivers lOd. went on lub-
rication. Body and glass work stood at 7|d.;
front-axle attention, brake and steering
adjustments the same. Battery recharging
and repair cost 5d.; so did washing and
polishing. There was 24d. for radiator
attentions, and the balance went for motor
and chassis repairs.
“Playback”: The Hollywood version of
Noel Coward’s “Cavalcade” has Britishers
in every speaking part. Diana Wynard,
Irene Brown, Prank Lawton, Una O’Connor,
Ursula Jeans and Merle Tottenham were
brought from England, and Clive Bi-ook and
Herbert Mundin were engaged in Hollywood,
where they live. Frank Lloyd, the director,
is a Scot who once lived in London, and
■Reginald Berkeley, who adapted the screen
play from the Drury Lane stage presenta-
tion, is an Englishman. The 3000 extras
are chiefly English, Canadian and Australian.

“Barangkali”: In the last two years
efforts have been made in different parts of
the world to discover an efficient and cheap
method of using rubber for road construc-
tion, but the results have not been strikingly
successful. Much of the work has been
sponsored by the Malayan Government, in an
endeavor to increase the demand for the pro-
duct. Twelve or fifteen months ago a small
experimental section of roadway was laid
in the busiest part of Kuala Lumpur, and
so far has stood up to the traffic, and is
still in excellent condition. Singapore is
laying a section of its busiest street with
a rubber-asphalt mixture; for, even with
rubber at. its present low figure, the Straits
Settlements Government is convinced that a
pure rubber pavement would be too costly
and is experimenting with a mixture of pre-
vulcanised latex and asphalt, spread in a
continuous carpet over the road, with half-
inch chips of stone scattered over the mix-
ture and rolled in.
“Bulantum”: liabaul, New Guinea, had
a memorable function when the Common-
wealth Bank building was opened in 1921.
A dance had been arranged and a lot of
trouble was taken with the preparations.
For some mysterious reason, the dance floor
seemed very sticky; also, after supper, many
who had sampled the huge bo,wls of claret
cup became suddenly indisposed. It presently
transpired that native servants had dressed
the floor with icing sugar and placed boracic
acid in the claret cup.

“Gilbert de Sleuth”: Touching civil ser-
vants who have levanted with the goods (B.
12/4/’88), in Adelaide, some 50 years ago,
the Public Trustee one day walked into the
office of the Attorney-General and asked if
there were any countries which did not have
extradition treaties with the British Empire.
The unsuspecting official informed his col-
league that there were plenty, naming most
of the South American republics. A few
days later the Public Trustee’s wife’s dress-
maker, a most attractive young woman with
red hair, left on a holiday, and within a
week of her departure the Public Trustee
had also taken his annual leave, ostensibly
to go to Sydney. H'e was never seen in
Adelaide again; neither was the dress-
maker, and the auditors found the depart-
ment short of thousands of pounds of trust
money. But in a South American republic
which had no extradition treaty with the
Empire a man bearing a strong resemblance
to Adelaide’s missing official presently took
up his residence, together with a beautiful
red-haired wife, and they became prosperous
ranch-owners, evidently fully satisfied with
the assurance that they could not be brought
back to face the music.
London is discussing a new aerodrome
which Central Air Ports, Ltd., talks of erect-
ing at a cost of six millions high up over,
the heart of London. It would spread itself
for nearly 150 acres over the roofs of St.
Pancras and King’s Cross railway stations
and the adjacent buildings. It would bring
aeroplanes right into the stations of the
railways which feed the north of' England
and Scotland. Models and plans of the air-
port have been completed and a bill drafted.
The air station has been designed so that
’planes would be able to take off and land
no matter which way the wind might be
blowing. In the centre would be the han-
gars, cafes, waiting-rooms and hotel, leaving
a wide space all round for the ’planes to
land or take off.
Females have kept their factory jobs
better than males during this depression. In;
the boom year 1927-28, in N. S. Wales, 755
of every 1000 persons employed in factories
were males and 245 were females. In 1931-
32 (to June 30 of last year) the proportions
were 720 males and 280 females. During
these bad four years 42,688 males lost their
jobs and 7720 females.
One of the newest international organisa-
tions is the Container Bureau. It is de-
scribed as “the first attempt to set up inter-
national collaboration of means of trans-
port in order to secure efficient exploitation
of rolling stock, speeding up of traffic and
reduction of costs.” The container is the
demountable body of a railway truck or road
motor, which can travel both by rail arid
road. The container is widely used in the
United States. Over 8000 arc in use in
Britain, 3000 in Germany and lesser numbers
in other countries. In the past con-
tainers in use have varied in type and dimen-

sions, which involves loss of time in tran-
shipment and increases cost. The Bureau
hopes to secure standardisation throughout
the world.

Canada is the latest country to see tbe
importance of close State supervision over
food exports. A new regulation has been
made that each day’s salmon pack shall be
marked by indenting the can to show the
species of salmon (“S” for sockeye, “C” for
cohoes, “P” for pinks and so on) ; further,
“canned salmon that are found to be fresh,
firm, well-packed and in good merchantable
condition shall be approved and a certificate
marked ‘A’ issued therefor” —to accompany
shipping documents. When a parcel fails to
get a certificate, before it may be shipped it
must have “permanently attached an addi-
tional end cover on which there shall be
clearly embossed, in letters at least 3-16ths
of an inch in height, the words ‘Second
Quality.’ ” And the word “Canada,” if it
is embossed on the tin, must then be sub-
merged by a strip proclaiming the fact that
the goods haven’t got a certificate from the
department.

Mr. Gritchett Walker, Plain Bill Dailey’s
heau ideal of an Under-Secretary (and one
• f the latest C.M.G.’s), is one of the three
sons of Rev. James Walker, M.A.. of Oxford,
iu 1843 headmaster of King’s School, Par-
ramatta. He died in .1854, incumbent of the
old-fashioned church of St. Luke, Liverpool,
and was buried in the cemetery of that sleepy
town. Other brothers are the N.S.W.
Public Librarian and the Assistant-Superin-
tendent of Telegraphs. [l7/1/’9l.]
The Hon. Patrick Jonah Perkins, the
Queensland brewer, who has been nearly
drowned in about IS separate shipwrecks
and collisions' at sea, was nearly drowned
over again the other day while bathing at
Southport. He was carried out into the
Pacific, and if he had been anyone else there
would have been no assistance nearer than
San Francisco, but being the undrown able
Perkins there were two men at hand who
fished him out. Whatever Perkins’s end may
be, he will certainly die in a dry state. Even
if the captain of an Orient steamer throws
him overboard off the Cape of Good Hope,
with an anchor tied to him, it is three
chances to one that he will find the Hon.
Patrick in Australia before him, and two
chances to one that the Hon. Patrick will
have sold the anchor back to the company
at considerably over its value. [l7/1/’9l.]
At Bundaberg I met an old German
colonist who was present in the Court House
at East Maitland in February, 1851, when
Major Crummer, the P.M., presented a brass
plate and an address to “Jackey Jackey,”
the aboriginal of Kennedy’s Cape expedition
of 1848. Had that black not been with
Kennedy the whole party would have van-
ished without leaving a trace behind them.
And this reminds me that Jackey’s native
name was “Galmarra” (a composer of
songs), that he came from the Patrick’s
Plains tribe on the Hunter River, and finally
killed himself with rum at Newcastle. Also
that the Queensland Government Botanist,
Mr. Bailey, has named a Russell River
(N.Q.) grass Paspalum Galmarra, in
of that heroic savage, who was far more
entitled to a monument than Burke. Jackey
saved Kennedy’s papers and the lives of the
two men (Carron and Goddard) who sur-
vived out of 12, while Burke’s folly caused
the death of seven men and did no good to
anybody. [26/2/’9B.]
Christmas is over, and the tough, cold,
cheerless, ungainly Christmas fowl has
ceased from troubling for another year.
Once every 12 months there flits across the
mental horizon a species of spectral ostrich
—a long, lank, leathern bird, with blue legs
covered with a shiny incrustation like
smashed cockroaches, and a broken tail that
hangs down like the blown-up banner of a
defeated army; and it is the purpose and
business of this torn and routed animal to
diffuse peace on earth in a general sort of
way, and goodwill towards men. He is
generally bought about a fortnight before
the day of execution, and in the interval he
fasts and shrieks in the yard, and gallops
round in the vain search for a way of
escape. Every now and then the peaceful
inhabitant, lurking in the shadow of his
hash-fortress, is roused by a dissonant howl
that seems to come from the sink at the back
of the washhouse, or
else there goes forth
a long and fearsome
cry like the crash of
a falling star, and in
either case he knows
that the Christmas
fowl is enjoying it-
self in its own
gently unobtrusive
way, and is waiting
for the great change
and the ensuing re-
surrection. At other
times he observes a
glazed and filmy eye
looking gloomily out
from the recesses of
the ash-bucket, and
a faded, tattered
Pompadour comb
shaking in the
breeze, and he recog-
nises- by these signs
that the fowl is pros-
pering and getting
ready to be . a joyous
and fragrant deli-
cacy. In between
its other occupations
the bird usually goes
out and fights with
the dogs and cats,
and generally it
winds up, through
the mercy of a bene-
ficent Providence, in
being stolen by some
passing Chinaman,
to whom it becomes
a curse, a vexation
and an eyesore,
while its legitimate
owner is left to dine
on blasphemy and
cold ham. Occasion-
ally, however, the
spectral songster re-
fuses to be embezzled
and turns up in a
cooked condition on
the table, and then
the most reasonable
way to meet the
difficulty is to stand
with one foot on a
chair and hold down
the boiled and stuffed
incubus by putting
the other hoof in the plate, after which it is
advisable to welt the alleged victual with
an adze. For our own part, we spent several
of our earlier years in the mining industry,
and the experience which we then acquired
in blowing up rocks with dynamite, and
blasting tons of hungry quartz, has done us
good service in our combats with more than
one old and hide-bound emblem of Christmas
festivity. The methods of killing this escaped
albatross are various; one is to grasp him
by the head and shake him convulsively in
the air, and another, and an easier device,
is to guillotine the dejected article of food
—after which he usually escapes into the
house without his head, and rushes madly
all over the furniture, and is ultimately
found with his corpse jammed among the
-spoons. His business, when he is dead, is
to disseminate joyous hilarity, and to im-
plant the seeds of good fellowship in the
human soul; he is an indigestible object
that falls with a dull, sickening thud on the
bright places of cookery 7 and gnashes his
teeth as he rolls, and even after he is eaten
he leaves behind him a memory of a huge
blazing fowl that. rushes with a whizz and
a hiss through a land of dreams. He is
no visible good in his deceased state, and he
is no good when he is not deceased except
to dig up large -areas of ground and look
for worms. Possibly he was meant as fire-
wood, but somehow the world has resolved
to consider him in the light of an article of
diet, and it refuses to recognise how in-
famously it has been deceived. [lO/l/’9l.j

The suburban press is a fearsome institu-
tion, and sometimes achieves notable results.
The suburban press of Melbourne all but
destroyed the Government and bankrupted
Victoria at the beginning of the sittings of
the third session of the Federal Convention.
It was a Sydney scribe who made the dis-
covery. He wandered into the refreshment-
room at Melbourne House of Assembly and
called for whisky-and-soda, tendering a shil-
ling. The coin was refused, and it was
explained to him that the Government had
resolved to treat the press engaged during
the sittings of the Convention purely as
guests. Everything was to be free. The
indiscreet journalist mentioned the fact to
himself in the arctic privacy of his own
room, and the news went forth. Browning’s
rats were nothing to it. Pressmen swarmed
up from cellar and down from attic. For-
gotten scribes of past decades emerged from
their Caves of Adullam; dipsomaniacal scrib-
blers hurried to the scene of conflict; the
very churchyards yawned, ana
dead journalists gathered their
bones together and rushed to
represent at the Convention
papers published in Hades. And
the Government acted right
royaly—for one week. The
rarest vintages of France were
at the disposal of ragged paru-
graphists; cigars of the most
fragrant, appallingly Cuban
brands were provided, and gold-
tipped cigarettes, at five shil-
lings a dozen, were pocketed by
the handful. But when some
70 scribes scrambled for fish
costing three guineas a plate,
and arrogantly refused to be
denied ; when they poured cham-
pagne into the finger-glasses,
and lit big aromatic cigars with
gild-edged menus, and carried
home roast birds-of-parad(se for
the regalement of the landlady,
the Government sadly, but
firmly, put its foot down, and
announced, more in sorrow thap
in anger, that the orgy was
over and the Convention’s free
counter-lunch closed down. As
it was expressly explained to one com-
plaining journalistic dead-beat by the official
in charge: “No Government could stand it.
Why, if we went on like this Victoria would
be up the spout within a fortnight. As it
is » [l2/3/’9B.]
Everyone remembers the.cantankerous little
tenor, Dimitresco, the Roumanian, who was
here with Simonsen’s last company, his wife
being the attractive contralto Madame
Lablache. who sang Carmen so well. Dimi-
tresco left the stage in the middle of the
last scene of “Carmen,” at Melbourne Opera
House, through a disagreement as to tempo
with Lombardi, the conductor, and he played
a like prank in Sydney. But such tricks
seem to be concomitants of getting on, for
Dimitresco is- now a star of the London
Italian Opera, Covent Garden, under Signor
de Lago. [lO/l/’GI.J

crowd of little Macs, sat before him and con
stitufed an admiring and appteciat \

Silver is on top at
tlie moment as a fashion-
able metal. Every high-
toned family owns at
least one “silver-table,
and no dressing-room is
considered up -to - date
unless the owner can
afford to have her hair-
brush bristles backed by
silver, while her luxu-
rious lord and master
must jerk his razor-
strop out of a new-
patent silver stropcase,
or the very servants
would sneer at him as
a hopeless plebeian.
Also the woman who
heats her curling-tongs
at the kitchen gas-stove
can’t expect to be on
visiting terms with the
superior person who
boasts a silver curling-
stove in a hammered
metal velvet-lined box.
This is where the newly-
married score heavily,
because all these things
are generally added to
them in the wedding-
present grab. If the
silver craze continues
and spreads into the
guest chamber, prudent hosts will have to
chain down all small portable articles m
the spare bedrooms. |a , /J/w .,

LOVE IN A COTTAGE.
We sit in the dusk with each other
(For candles are eightpence a pound),
And I hear of the letter from “Mother,”
And how Mrs. McLean has “been round”;
How the pretty new hat she was flashing
Was cheaper than Mary’s by far;
How the woman was here for the washing,
And how big our chrysanthemums are;
How bread has gone up in a hurry,
And “the man” says that coals will be
dear,
And that she doesn’t like me to worry,
But the winter will shortly be here;
How she blistered her hand in the baking
(I must kiss it to banish the pain....)
Blessed Lord! am I sleeping or waking?
For I’ve seen the old fellows again.
I met them to-day in the city—
All three of them — liappy as kings ;
And their talk was unhampered and witty,
For they know not the prices of things.
Con pays (it is true) at the laundries,
But that is his only expense;
All Roley’s disbursements are “sundries,”
And Mac. lights his fire with the fence.
They are wealthy just now —gold and glory
For nearly a day they have known ;
“Some ass has accepted a story,
And Con takes his oath it’s his own.”
And Mac. sold a picture^—“‘Behold Him!’
Charles Xerxes McKenzie, R.I. !”
“The rottenest tripe!” “So I told him—
That’s all that the beggars will buy.”
Dead, dead are those seasons of clamor,
When the world was untrammelled and
young,
And every new girl was a glamor
That lived to be painted and suiig.
Was it worth it, to give up the turban
And lead a monogamous life,
For the joys of a villa suburban
And a file of accounts for a wife?
Eheu —what’s the finish? — fugaces!
(I never did Latin at school),
I am fresh from the sight of their faces,
And I’m sorry—that I was a fool.
For the worst ways of life are the clearest,
And the man that pays rent is an ass;
And I wish I had never.. . . what, dearest?
Yes, you gave me the bill for the gas.

THE PAGAN.
THE SHOE.
Battered and worn on the wayside lay
A shoe, unseen by the busy throng
Of passers who, through the dusty way.
From morn to eve had hurried along.
The sight of that shoe to me had brought
A host of fancies, merry and sad.
Of a heart that struggled and toiled and
wrought,
With never an hour of its life made glad:
Of a joyous and happy and winsome maid.
With mind all free from thought of guile:
Of a soul with sin’s black sorrows lade,
Of a face that ne’er was lit with smile.
Had the shoe been worn by any of these?
Was the wearer of it young and fair?
The answer is one, I hope, will please —
It was torn from the hoof of old Browns
mare.

1 SUPPOSE a man likes to talk about his
landlady just as he does about his rheu-
matics or his liver. Only, of course, there
is no cure for a landlady except moving;
and then you only get another one. That
is, no doubt, how Bolger knew the fellows
to get hold Of When he struck his big idea.
Not that I myself was ever a man to
complain. As a matter of fact, that is my
complaint. I’m too good-natured to kick.
But when I found myself talking with men
like Blabbs, who reckoned that his landlady
was so mean with the food that her boarders
used to stand on the landings sniffing
enviously at the food-smells that came from
next door, and Smugsby, who lived next door
and used to growl that it was unrefined and
overcrowded, I would weigh in with a bit
of my own now and then. That’d be when,
after paying for the best in the house, I
would be shoved into some little back room
because one of the chaps who knew how
to grumble had roared about the draughts
in it.
When Jenkins gave me a ring asking me
to go to his office, I found them all there —
or a good few of them. It appeared that
sending for me was a sort of afterthought,
with an idea of making up weight.
“All of us know how unsatisfactory board-
ing-houses are,” explained Jenkins. “We’ve
struck an idea for a co-operative boarding-
house which will do away with the grasping
and overbearing landlady.”
“It’s a splendid notion,” said Figgers, to
whom the charge of threepence for a hot bath
was worse than a floating kidney. Figgers
is an accountant. “I’ve gone into the mat-
ter,” he mentioned. “With ten of us I’ve
reckoned that it will work out to one pound
three and elevenpence ha’penny per week
each—that’s allowing for rent, salaries, light
and everything. Take these figures”
Jenkins checked him as he started to refer
to the sheaf of papers he had in his hand.
“We’ve got nine,” Jenkins said, “and we
thought you would like to make the tenth.
We each put in a small sum for capital; pay
our share each week. We take a suitable
place, furnish it and run it according to ouv
own ideas with a small management com-
mittee. The place is our own, and we can
run it on our own lines.”
“When there are tough chops for break-
fast,” said Grimble, with a touch of enthu-
siasm, “we can hold a general meeting and
put the management committee out on its
ear.”
“But you’ve got to have a landlady of some
sort —a manageress or something,” I said.
“Jenkins has a lady in view,” said Figgers.
“Nellie McGaw,” said Jenkins.
“Jimmy McGaw’s wife?” I exclaimed.
“Yes. Jimmy’s deserted her; left her
without a bean in the world —or nearly so.
We’ve got to do something for the poor
woman.”
It was astounding news to me. Jimmy
McGaw always seemed to be fond of his
wife. A pleasant chap, Jimmy, in spite, of
his habit of asking you to have a drink
and then borrowing enough to pay for it and
a bit over.
But he had bolted, it seems; and Mrs.
McGaw had come with a tear-wet handker-
chief to Jenkins because he’d happened to
be concerned with her husband in one or
two ventures. Jenkins is a big flabby chap
who likes to regard himself as being full of
soft sentiment, the same as a good many
fellows who know pretty well how to look
after themselves. When a trouble like Mrs.
McGaw fell upon his hands, it was in keep-
ing with his character that lie should form a
limited company to take her off them.
Still, there were points about the scheme
which appealed to me, particularly just then,
my landlady having again shifted me tem-
porarily into a room at the back of the
house, this time because some painting was
going on in that part. “Mr. Thomas is made
sick by the smell of paint, and I knew you
wouldn’t mind making a change for a time.
You are always so obliging, Mr. Stodgers,”
she had said. That’s the sort of thing land-
ladies did to me.
Mrs. McGaw is a pretty woman, and
seemed amiable and bright—what I’d seen
of her. A scheme that would help her out
of her difficulties likewise appealed to me;
so I told them they could count me in.
“I can’t understand about Jimmy,” I said.
“He is such a likeable chap.”
“He’s a precious young scoundrel!”
growled Jenkins. “But it’s understood that
nobody is to speak harshly of him to Mrs.
McGaw. She might make some remarks
about him herself, but she won’t stand any-
one else doing it. That’s something you’ve
got to admire about her.”
Mrs. McGaw thanked us so prettily for
what we proposed to do for her that I think
we were all pleased with the arrangement.
“I hardly realised there were so many noble
men in the world,” she said, tears in her
eyes. Of course we all tried to look as
noble as possible. “It will not be my fault
if I don’t make you all very comfortable.
My boarding-house will be the most home-
like one in Sydney,” she said.
“There will be a management committee
to help you,” said Jenkins, not liking, I think,
the way she took possession, as it were.
“Myself, Mr. Figgers here, who will manage
the accounts, and Pieman, whose knowledge
of catering will be useful. I will act Avith
you in making the preliminary arrange-
ments.”
Possibly some of us were a bit envious of
Jenkins over this job of going about with
the attractive Nellie McGaw; but, although
the big fellow started with enthusiasm, he
had a worried look shortly. We were begin-
ning to think he was merely indulging in joy-
rides when one day he took us out to see
the place he had chosen —a fine house,
remarkably cheap, of which we thoroughly
approved. Jenkins made the arrangements
tor the lease and went round to fix matters
with the furniture people. The actual choos-
ing of the furniture was left to Nellie; and
when Jenkins saw the lists of her selection
he was perturbed.
“My dear lady,” he remonstrated, “this
is going beyond the limit. The idea was
that the furnishings should be comfortable
but plain.”
“Well, so they are in the bedrooms,” she
retorted. “Those expensive things are for
the drawing-room. All my life I’ve wanted
to have a beautiful drawing-room.”
She said that so appealingly that Jen-
kins squirmed.
“That’s all right as far as I’m concerned,”
he said. “But there’s the committee, you
know.”
“Oh, but the committee will agree to any-
thing you say! You’re the really big man
in it,” she appealed.
A few bob a week didn’t matter to me;
and I had to chuckle when I got to know
what Jenkins was going through. It was
chaps like Figgers who raised the row about
the bob or so extra on the furniture account.
Figgers hated to see his carefully prepared
calculations put all awry. But there was a
bigger row when Jenkins had to explain that
there would have to be a further call upon
the shares.
“You can blame me if you like, gentle-
men,” he explained. “Y’see, there are a lot
of details for the house for which I thought
it best to give Mrs. McGaw the money.
Well —she didn’t get them. I think she is
right, in a way, in her contention that we
don’t want our manageress, who will also
be our hostess, to go about like a dowd.
We want her to look”—
“You mean to tell us,” said Figgers with
bitterness, “that Mrs. McGaw spent the
money— our money—on dress?”
“That’s what it amounts to,” admitted
Jenkins awkwardly. “I couldn’t very well
chase about with her buying pots and pans
and cutlery, so I gave her fifteen pounds”——
“And she spent it on clothes!”
“Not altogether. There were some shoes
and a hat. Of course, I explained to her
that it would have to be treated as an
advance against salary.”
“My opinion of you, Jenkins, is that you’re
a damned fool!” said Figgers. “What about
that new tie of yours? I shouldn’t wonder
if she bought you that! You’ve got pretty
finicky with your appearance the last couple
of days.”
As a matter of fact lie had; and he went
red as a turkey-cock over the reference to
his tie.
They carpetted Mrs. McGaw, who hap-
pened to call in—for some more money—just
then; but I think it was greatly with the
idea of showing her that Jenkins wasn’t the
only pebble on the beach. Mrs. McGaw, how-
ever, was not a bit abashed.
“A woman can’t be happy if she has to
go about in old-fashioned clothes,” she ex-
plained sweetly. “And I’m sure you gentle-
men want me to be happy in my work, just
as I want to make you all happy. You
wouldn’t grudge me a small advance to fit
myself for the position. Would you, Mr.
Stodgers?” she cried, appealing to me.
“Go for your life!” I said heartily.
Figgers and a few of the others looked
at me as if I were a traitor.
Everybody acclaimed our boarding-house a
success when we moved in. Mrs. McGaw
had agreed to run the place with the aid of
a general and a girl; and on the face of
things she did it very well. The food was
so good that, as a matter of skite, we started
taking our friends out to sample it —each
was entitled to two guests a week. It was
something to show off the exquisite dinners
that Mrs. McGaw managed.
It was unfortunate that on one particular
night there happened to be eight guests pre-
sent, and none of the usual savory odors
coming from the kitchen regions. We were
all—or most of us—waiting in the drawing-
room (we’d become rather proud of it) when
Mrs. McGaw made her appearance.
“Are any of you gentlemen handy with
the tin-opener?” she asked.
We had soup, cold salmon with vegetables,
and some custards and fruit. It appeared
that the cook-general was having her after-
noon off and the girl had been called home
because her mother was ill. The grins on
the faces of our visitors, who had heard
about our fare, were hard to endure. I know
if tliere’d been any of my friends there. I’d
have taken them and given them somethin?
to eat.
As it was, I was in a good mood when
Mrs. McGaw called me aside.
“Oh. Mr. Stodgers,” she said, “I’ve made
arrangements to go to see the pictures to-
night and I’m in a frightful hurry. You’re
so good-natured—l’m wondering whether you
would mind helping me with the washing-
up?”
“Mind!” I replied eagerly.
As a matter of fact, washing-up with Mrs
McGaw appealed to me as likely to be quite
a pleasant job. Near the kitchen she 'took
an apron from a cupboard and fastened it
on me. It thrilled me.
“You mustn’t risk staining your good
clothes, she said. “You can wipe-up, and
the job won. t take more than ten minutes.
You don t know how I appreciate your will
mgness, Mr. Stodgers!”
Disappearing mysteriously, she left me
standing in the kitchen. I was expecting her
back again, when a sound made me turn.
It was to see Blabbs, dressed up like myself,
m an apron.
“Where’s Mrs. McGaw?” he asked. “I
heard her voice.”
She s gone. I promised to do the wiping
up for her.” 1
t P rom i se< i to do the washing-up!
I thought she was going to do the rest We’re
a fine pair of mutts, we are!”
We didn’t feel any more pleasant over it
because, looking out of the window when
we heard the door slam, we saw Mrs McGaw
going out—witli Figgers ! '

Still Figgers didn’t have it all liis own
way either. We applauded, as an indication
of her zeal on our behalf, Mrs. McGaw’s
plan to go to the markets once a week aiul
get the vegetables and fruit. When she said
that if one of us was prepared to go with
her it w T ould help, there were several volun-
teers. She chose Figgers —in consideration,
she said, of his knowledge of accounts. He
was quite proud of himself.
The time for the second market trip found
him waiting impatiently for her.
“Oh, Mr. Figgers,” she said, coming to
him suddenly, “I’m so busy this morning!
Do you think you could manage to go by
yourself this once? You could do as well as
1 would myself.”
After that had occurred a couple of times
Figgers brought the matter up before a
general meeting. He reckoned that he was
doing more than his share. If we wanted
someone to go to the markets every week,
lie w*as of opinion we should take turns
about.
“It was all right as long as Nellie was
going with you,” said Jenkins nastily. “And
that was a thing I was going to bring up
myself. The way you’re taking Mrs. McGaw
out to the pictures isn’t right. You’re a
married man, even if you are living apart
from your wife. If she hears of that, she
may make a rumpus, and we don’t want, any
scandal attached to this place.”
“You mind your own business!” retorted
Figgers hotly.
“My business, as president, is the good
name of this establishment,” said Jenkins.
“Poof!” snorted Figgers rudely. “You’re
a great deal more interested in”——
“There’s the good name of Mrs. McGaw,
as our manageress, to be considered,” Jen-
kins went on. “If any fuss is made by your
wife”-
“Well, Mrs. McGaw is married, too,” Fig-
gers persisted. “So if you’ve got any
ideas”-
“Mrs. McGaw,” said Jenkins solemnly,
“will probably divorce her husband when the
time arrives. It would be the right thing
for her to do in regard to the blackguard!”
That w;as the first open sign of strain in
our boarding-house. But after that the habit of
snarling became more in evidence, and it
wasn’t confined to Jenkins and Figgers,
either. We discovered one of the difficulties
of co-operative boarding-housekeeping when
Jenkins, in a definite clash with Blabbs,
threatened to pay him the value of his share
and expel him; and Blabbs said he had just
as much right to stay in as Jenkins had.
Nellie, supremely oblivious of the bickering,
was pretty impartial with her favors, I must
say. After the washing-up incident I dodged
any special attention; if she made a fuss
over Blabbs, it was pretty sure to be because
she wanted to make a trip to see some friends
living at Cronulla, and his ear was useful.
It was so with the others. The trouble was
that each, as he was dropped, became a bitter
critic of the conduct of the place. Boarders
have the grumbling habit and naturally can’t
lose it all at once.
It was at a monthly accounts meeting
that the first real bombshell was exploded.
“I charge the management committee with
not playing fair to us!” Blabbs thundered.
“They’ve allowed soft feelings in regard to
Mrs. McGaw to influence them in trying to
screen her. I say this —the money that was
paid out hy the committee for the grocer
never reached him. The bill is unpaid still
for two months! There are other bills the
same way. In the meantime, Mrs. McGaw
buys herself a new dress or a new hat almost
every week. We’re living in a fools’ para-
dise ; and, if we’re going to pay our debts,
we’ll have to ante-up a good deal more each
week than we were told would be necessary.
I demand that Mrs. McGaw should be
brought in to the meeting to be questioned.”
In spite of the opposition of Jenkins, Fig-
gers and Pieman, Blabbs had his way, but
Nellie’s pleading eyes and tearful promises
caused Blabbs’s supporters to desert him
basely. Yet there was no doubt whatever
that every one of Blabbs’s charges had been
proved.
“There’s no doubt she’s a bad manager,”
said Jenkins to me later; “and you can’t pin
her down. Such a sweet little woman, too!
It makes my blood boil to hear her attacked
as she was this afternoon ; and I feel I’m
partly responsible—for having placed her in
the position.”
“Well, how about poor Jimmy McGaw
now?” I asked. “With her habits she must
have made life pretty tough for Jimmy. No
wonder he was always in trouble!”
“A man has no right to marry unless he
is in a position to pay for. his wife’s little
peculiarities,” retorted Jenkins. “As I can!
Her husband’s simply a blackguard; and I’m
advising Nellie to take steps to divorce him
straight away.”
“Oh, you are, are you?” I remarked, and
left him staring into the garden.
There was an outcry from the men who
had considered that our boarding-house was
going to be an economy; and one or two
began to talk about breaking away. I
threatened to do that myself if, in the cause
of economy, the girl was abolished. I remem-
bered that washing-up. It seemed, however,
that we had definitely got on the lines of
straight running at last. There was also
talk, there being plenty of room, of getting
in a few extra boarders “to spread the over-
head expenses.”
I came home one evening, a little late, to
find the house in a strange darkness. As I
let myself in I saw a candle flickering on
the hallstand, and the open doors showed the
same feeble gleams from adjacent rooms. I
glanced into the smoking-room, where the
candle on the mantelpiece showed a stranger,
who nodded affably.
I met Blabbs going down the stairs.
“Dinner on yet?” I queried.
“There’s no dinner,” he said, grinning mali-
ciously. “The gas has been cut off.”
“Cut off!”
“Yes, and the electric light, too.”
“That’s unlucky!” I exclaimed. “Just
when we’ve, at last got a uew boarder!
I saw him in the smoke-room.”
“New boarder! That’s a bailiff. The
furniture people—he’s here either to get the
arrears or to repossess.”
“Good Lord!” I ejaculated. “Why, the
definite understanding”
“Was that Mrs. McGaw would be handed a
definite sum weekly and would have to meet
everything out of that. It was a fool idea,
adopted because you weaklings sided with
her when she was insulted by my idea of
paying accounts direct by cheque. Now you
see the result ! Well, I’m washing my hands
of it. I’ve got my trunks packed, and I’m
leaving.”
“Leaving?”
“Tabley and Pulsit have gone already,” he
said.
The rats were leaving—the ship was sink-
ing, then. I found Jenkins in his room,
pacing the floor.
“It looks like the end,” he said glumly.
“Perhaps it is better that it should be so.
If the others won’t spar up, I’ll have to
square the debts off myself.”
“You can rely on my share,” I said. “But
where’s Mrs. McGaw?”
“The poor girl—she doesn’t understand,
you know; she’s so ashamed that I think
she’s shut herself in her room. I tell you
what I’m going to do, Stodgers. I’m going
to marry her!”
He spoke of it as if it. were the supreme
sacrifice.
“You can’t. She’s got a husband.”
“She can get a divorce, can’t she —restitu-
tion order, and all that! And I can make
some arrangements to keep her going till
she’s in a position to marry me—manufacture
a position for her, if necessary'. Somebody’s
got to look after the poor little thing; and.
although I never anticipated getting mar
ried —thank God I’ve got money!”
“You’ll need it,” I said.
He did not seem to notice. I followed him
unthinkingly as he moved off.
The sound of Nellie’s gay, rippling laugl
struck us with astonishment.
At a corner in the corridor we met lie’’
and with her was a young man carrying suit
cases.
“Jimmy McGaw!” gasped Jenkins.
“Yes, Jimmy has come back!” cried Nelli,
excitedly. “He had to leave me, you know—
he was broke; but lie’s got a good position
in Melbourne, and lie’s come over to take me
back. And I’ll know now how to appreciate
a good husband, after being browbeaten and
badgered as a landlady!”
“Brow’beaten and badgered!” exclaimed
Jenkins.
She saw his hurt look and held out her
hands impulsively to both of us.
“You meant to be kind; and I’m grate-
ful!” she cried. “Still I have had to put up
with a good deal!”
“Well, I’m damned!” groaned Jenkins, as
he watched them depart.
Tamar Gulls.
All night they cry,
Like little children whimpering in the cold.
All night they, fly,
Mourning the sun’s lost gold.
Out over orchards of apple-trees,
Then riverwards through the night—
Seemingly ridden by great unease—
They wing in their ghostly flight!
But when the rose
That dawn flings over Heaven’s parapet
Opens and glows,
The gulls no longer fret:
Like children freed from a dreary school
They gladden the morning hours ;
As o’er blue shallow and dimpled pool
They scatter like wind-blown flowers !

NORMA L. DAVIS.
Over the Sea to Spain.
Perhaps they may count me a beggar here.
With never a roof for the wind and the
rain;
But there is the sea with its wave-lashed
pier,
And over the sea lies Spain.
And there am I held by a title high,
As befitteth the lord of a broad demesne;
For there is my, kingdom, and here am I,
With only the sea between.
And what if the sea be deep, be deep,
And what if the sea be wide?
Some day I shall float in my own fair boat,
And sail to the other side.
A certain man in the city I meet
As he steps to his car at the kerbstone
there
From a solemn house in a stately street—
You w'ould know him rich by his air.
He gives me a finger or two to hold.
Or only a passing nod deign:
He does not know of my title and gold,
My castle and lands in Spain.
But what care I for his bonds and stocks?
No solemn house in the city for me!
His are the ships that lie in the docks,
But I have a ship at sea.
And what if the land be far, be far,
And what if the sea be wide?
Some day I shall sail with a favoring gale
To a port on the other side.
And now while I lie on the sea-beach here,
With the fisherman yonder mending his
seine,
I know that only the sea sweeps clear
Twixt me and my castle in Spain.
I can see the sun on its airy towers,
And a white hand beckon from oversea;
I can smell the breath of the rosy bowers
Where somebody waits for me.
So content do I walk in this world of men
To which by an alien name I am known;
But how it will gape in wonder when
Don Carlos comes to his own!
Be never the land so far, so far,
Be never so broad the main,
There’s a ship on the sea that belongs to
me,
And over the sea lies Spain.

THE PUPILS OF
BERNARD CRONIN
STORY-WRITING
PARAGRAPHS
ARTICLES
The training Mr. Cronin gives his pupils
is a masterpiece of practicality. Question
and practice include not only work on the
subject-matter of each lesson but also speci-
fied original work to be submitted for criti-
cism and comment. The criticism is given
fully and in detail on the MS. itself, and
in comprehensive personal letters of advice
throughout the Course.' It is the most help-
ful form of training because its foundation
is the pupil’s own work, his (or her) own
thought, expression and presentation. The
pupil is shown not what another writer
might do but what he himself can do—and
he is trained to do it.
The following letters give some idea of
the method and its results.
A New South Wales pupil writes:—
“I have already received about £3O for
stories and articles. As writing is a pro-
fession with all the initial difficulties and
setbacks of most professions, together with
a few of its own, and I, regard myself as
still serving my articles, I do not feel that
I have anything to grumble about. I have
to work at night, often after a long and
tiring day, which is a big drawback. Still,
£3O is- a profit of just 200 per cent, over
your very moderate fee for the Course.
“I doubt if I should have sold a line
if it had not been for the. splendid training
Mr. Bernard Cronin gave me. I had been
rejected so many times that I was on the
point of giving up, and would probably
have done so had I not obtained your
prospectus and decided to take the Course.
“Apart, from Mr. Cronin’s exceptional
experience and thorough understanding of
the art of story-writing. I think the best
features of the Course are his candid criti-
cism and extraordinary patience. The be-
ginner needs both in large quantities, and
Mr. Cronin' certainly supplies them. I
am very grateful to him for the kindly,
patient way he led me along the literary
track—and also for the hard knocks he gave
me when I deserved them.”
A N.Z. pupil writes:—
“My story ‘Leavings’ gained first place
in the ‘N.Z. Tablet’ , short-story competi-
tion from 140 entries from most parts of
New Zealand. The prize is £5/5/-. This
is the one I submitted with Question and
Answer for Paper nine and which you said
I should place if I persisted.”
A Victorian pupil writes: —-
“I am pleased to say that I placed ‘The
Cub’ with the ‘Australian Journal.’”
Another Victorian pupil writes: —
‘“The Leader’ has accepted one of my
stories.”
A West Australian pupil writes:—
“My story ‘Bread Upon the Waters’
appeared in March 2 issue of ‘The Queens-
lander.’ ”
In the past few months nfany similar
letters have been received. At the third
lesson Mr. Cronin tells his pupils whether
it is worth while going on. That accounts
for the early successes of those who do
go on.
Copies of “Writing to Win” and “Writing
for the Newspapers” are sent free to those
interested.
Write to Mr. Cronin at 398 Flinders Lane,
Melbourne. It will save time and bring a
more helpful reply if you say what your
aspirations are and what your writing ex-
perience has been.
PELMANlSM—MentalTraining
A Practical Course for
Practical Men and Women.
pELM'ANISM teaches you the Science
of Living.
Nature has given you a brain. The
education you have received in the ordi-
nary way has given you knowledge of
various subjects, and the experience yon
have gained in after life has added to
that knowledge.
But Pelmanism trains your brain and
shows you how to apply that knowledge
and expedience in the best possible way.
That is why it is so popular. It is
what people have been wanting for a
long time. To-day the Pelman Institute
enables you to ’obtain this scientific
mental training at the lowest possible
cost and with the least amount of
trouble and exertion.
Practical Psychology
strides have been made in
recent years in the science of Psy-
chology. The mind —its nature, its
actions, its weaknesses, its impulses"—
is being studied as never before. The
results of these studies are to be found
in Pelmanism, which is a working course
in Practical Psychology directed to the
needs of the average man and woman.
The present Pelman Course is based on
30 years’ intensive study and practical
experience. The experience embodied
in the Course has been gained as the
result of dealing with the difficulties,
failings, fears, aspirations and ambi-
tions of many thousands of men and
women belonging to practically every
known Profession, Trade or form of
business —including the important busi-
ness (housewives note!) of the Home.
Great pains have been taken to keep
the Course- as simple as possible, and
in this aim the Institute has been
entirely successful. The Course is what
it is intended to be —a practical Course
for practical men and women who, in
the majority of cases, have to earn their
own living. This is explained very
clearly in “The Efficient Mind,” a copy
of which will be sent, free of charge,
to every reader who uses the coupon
printed below.
These Defects Conquered
TT is necessary for everyone who washes
1 to “get on” in life to keep in mental
training. When your mind is “out of
training,” all sorts of symptoms appear.
Here are a few of them: —
Forgetfulness
Inability to
Concentrate
Procrastination
Depression
Timidity and
Shyness
Mind-wandering
Brain Fag
Indecision
Lost Confidence
Pessimism
Boredom
Unfounded Fears
And there ate many more. These
are not permanent defects, but if
neglected they will become more serious
and more deeply rooted, with very mis-
chievous consequences to your business
and social life and to your prospects
and happiness. They are signs that
your brain wants training and toning
up. Pelmanism gives you this training
and this toning up. As a result of
taking the Course, these defects and
weaknesses will disappear. You will
find them “fading out,” and after quite
a short time your mind will recover
its normal strength and natural tone.
Thousands have proved this already.
Qualities Developed
pELMANISM not only helps you to
overcome these defects but it de-
velops what might be called the Plus
(+) qualities of the mind. That is to
say, it strengthens those faculties which
are characteristic of tjie scientifically-
trailed mind ahd which are of the great-
est value in all the affairs of life.
Some of the qualities which Pelman-
ism develops are :
Concentration
Observation
Judgment
Initiative
Courage
Reliability
Strength of Will
Cheerfulness
Self-confidence
Organising Power
Driving Force
Presence of Mind
Resourcefulness
Determination
Self-control
Salesmanship
Creative Imagination
A Reliable Memory
It is tlie possession of these qualities
that gives to any man or woman wliat
is known as Personality, and you can
develop them yourself by practising
Pelmanism for a short time every day.
You need not devote a long time to it —
say half an hour every evening for the
next three months. You will find at
the end of that time that you have ih-
' creased your mental stature, that you
can do. better work, that your brain is
clear, that you can master difficulties
which formerly baffled you—and master
them with ease.—that you are more effi-
cient. that you have qualified yourself
for better things, that you are much
happier in yourself and that you will be
living a fuller, more interesting, more
eventful and more creative life. And
as so many people have found, this
improvement will be reflected in in-
creased income-earning power.
Pelmanism is a sure -way to success
if you will give it your loyal effort,
your honest endeavor, and a regular and
definite amount of time until you have
completed the Course. A sustained effort
over a period of but a few weeks will
yield you dividends that will last you
your wdioje life through.
The Key to the Magic Door
“DELMANISM,” says Dame Sybil
Thorndike, “gives mind-exercise
scientifically, and because its principles
are scientifically based, it not only im-
proves, but
actually di s -
covers, qualities
that would
otherwise have
remained dor-
mant. We all
wish for Suc-
cess, to be up-
lifted from the
mediocre, bu t
many never find
the key to open
the magic door.

Pelma nis m, I »a™e Sybil Thorndike,
am convinced,
is the ‘Open Sesame’ that smoothes
away all difficulties, giving a mental
clarity and alertness that sees oppor-
tunities and uses them rightly.”
Sir Herbert Barker
NOTH Ell well-known advocate of
Pelmanism is Sir Herbert Barker,
the eminent specialist in Manipulative
Surgery, who sends the following mes-
sage td every reader
who wishes to suc-
ceed in life.
“The world,” he
says, “owes an
enormous debt of
gratitude to the
inventors of the
Pelman System for
discovering a
means so easy and
pleasant, by which
the Nation’s men-
tal equipment can
be brought to its
very highest pos-
sible pitch of effi-

“I know of no other method to com-
pare with it.
“Benefit Beyond Computation”
“I am convinced that benefit beyond
computation can be secured by all-*—'
whether the student be nineteen or
ninety—who will follow the directions
given in the Course.
“It is impossible to speak too highly
of it. Pelmanism might make a new
world.”
