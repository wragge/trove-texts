LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
Painters’ Corner, St. Paul’s Cathedral.
C<T. PAUL’S has its Painters’ Corner, as Westminster Abbey has
its Poets’ Corner. In St. Paul’s Painters’ Corner is in the crypt
at the east end of the south aisle. Here, in the recess shown in our
picture, is the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren —marked by a tablet
bearing the epitaph which is repeated over the portico of the north
transept, Si monumentum requiris, circumspice. Nearby lie many
of England’s famous painters and sculptors, among them Reynolds,
Landseer, Lawrence, Benjamin West, Turner (who on his death-
bed had expressed a wish to be buried near Sir Joshua), Sir Edgar
Boehm, Lord Leighton and Sir John Millais and many others.
The bust on the left of our view, taken during the Queen’s reign,
is that of Francis M. Holl; the figure of the child beneath a canopy
is part of the monument of Randolph Caldecott, the water colourist
and illustrator.

BUNYIPS AND SUCH.
Douglas Stewart’s latest collection of
poems, The Dosser in Springtime, carries
the publishers’ statement: “Obtainable
in London from Angus and Robertson,
Limited, 48 Bloomsbury Street.” It looks
like nothing more suspect than a quiet
advt. for itself which the firm is no
doubt perfectly entitled to work in. What
it actually means is that A. and R. are
getting away—or at any rate trying to get
away—with a considerable traffic in
bunyips, lizards, crows, old iron, bill-
posters, opals, magpies, rivers, rock
carvings, dossers, mountains, bats, goats,
dwarfs, scholars and other presumably
prohibited exports, including the statue
of a bishop.
Unfortunately the export trade in books
—and above all books of poetry—con-
tinues to be all one way. It is not only
highly unlikely that A. and JL will be
getting claims for overtime and overwork
from 48 Bloomsbury-street; it is highly
likely that London won’t hear of The
Dosser till it’s as old as he is, and it isn’t
half that age yet. And that may be rated
rather a pity, because there is at least
vitality in this cargo of bunyips, etc., and
vitality isn’t exactly overwhelming in the
cargoes that now come.
So maybe it’s best to forget about
Bloomsbury-street and consider the cargo
confiscated under the Bunyip and Opal
Act and held for home consumption. A
number of things then begin to hit the
purchaser with a rush. The already
noted vitality; the originality; the
variety ; the imagination ; the fancy ; the
verse technique; the laughter. Because
of its rarity in poetry, that last should be
first* The Muses, poor dears, have all
become solemn souls. And no wonder.
Look at their latter-day suitors, especially
the versiferators; wherever did you set
eyes on such a lot of stuffed owls? Who
could think, looking at their white,
strained faces, that Chaucer, roaring with
laughter, has been known as the Father
of English Poetry? Who could think
that even Milton laughed? It isn’t done
any more —not in poetry.
The Dosser laughter is of the kind that
calls for whole poems to show it; to
show it properly would call for all the
laughter poems in the book. For it is
not the laughter of quip or jest, but the
laughter of the spirit. It is the laughter
of outlook. With an exception or two,
the tritest way to describe these poems
would be to call them amusing. What
they provide—and what is the mainspring
of themselves —is enjoyment. Part of
“Lady Feeding the Cats” may convey it
sufficiently:
Shuffling along in her broken shoes from the
slums,
A blue-eyed lady showing the weather’s stain,
Her long dress green and black like a pine in
the rain.
Her bonnet much bedraggled, daily she comes
Uphill past the Moreton Bays and the smoky
gums
With a sack of bones on her back and a song
in her brain
To feed those outlaws prowling about' the
Domain,
Those furtive she-cats and those villainous toms.
Proudly they step to meet her, they march
together
With an arching of backs and a waving of
plumy tails
And smiles that swear they never would harm
a feather.
They rub at her legs for the bounty that never
fails,
They think she is a princess out of a tower,
And so she is, she is trembling with love and
power.
As she moves to go “They turn their
battered heads in condescension”:
She smiles and walks back lightly to the slums.
If she has fed their bodies, they have fed
More than the body in her; they purr like
drums.
Their tails are banners and fountains inside her
head.
With the setting in much the same
locality above the ’Loo, a little of “The
Bishop” (statue) may come in with the
same purpose:
here is a man as broad as the sun, shining
bn all the people.
No one has heard his mouth of bronze open
for groan or curse
. As an ambulance rushed a child to be born or
a corpse went by in a hearse;
No one has heard him stamp on his plinth with
a harsh metallic foot
As Sarah staggers to William-street before the
wine-bars shut; >
No one has heard him shudder and clank when
free at last from the ship
Bill goes rolling to Palmer-street with a bottle
parked on his hip.
....high on his perch the bishop stands, serv-
ing whoever needs:
He and the saintly peanut man are above the
battle of creeds.
Those specimens may serve something
of the purpose of showing also the
originality and the variety. In regard to
this last it might be felt that it is carried,
in one respect, a few pages too far:
those pages containing “The Breaking
Wave,” “Old Iron” and one or two
others ; this because they are not in mood
or character with the rest, which wouldn’t
matter if the rest were merely an assort-
ment of poems; they constitute, how-
ever, a unified whole. An impres-
sion stays that —because Stewart would
be as well aware of those sobering breaks
as the reader must be—the poetic strays,
waking echoes of his early lyrics, were
deliberately or subconsciously put in and
placed as they are for the sake of
variety ; to avoid monotony. If that was
the idea, it was quite unnecessary. There
is variety enough in the structure and the
contents of the lively, laughing poems
without the contrasting slow movement of
the others.
That, of course, is not a criticism of
the few different poems as poems;
which must be particularly, emphasised
regarding “Old Iron,” a most powerful
product of the imagination, gaining a
force of dramatic strength from the fact
that the spring of it is just some old iron
in a seascape ; nothing near so obviously
promising as a Grecian urn. Nobody is
likely to wish “Old Iron” out of the
way,; but the fact stands that it is a bar
in what constitutes the flow of the book,
the nature of which flow is stated com-
pletely in one of the poems, “The Stolen
Mountain”:
No rise tonight he’d tell us,
Never a trout he landed:
We knew what flapped in his creel
When he came home empty-handed.
That man who hooked a mountain
And the bend of the creek as well
And the bullfrogs groaning like trombones
And the frogs that shrilled like a bell
Hooked also “The Bunyip”;
Gold and red the gum-trees glow,
Yellow gleam the ferns;
The bunyip in the crimson pool
Believes the water bums.
The little frogs, they call like bells.
The bunyip swims alone;
Across the pool the stars are laid
Like stone by silver stone.
A lady walks across the night
And sees that mirror there;
Oh, is it for herself alone
The moon lets down her hair?
One other quality should have been
listed: a quality of characterisation, on
the particular nature of which the bunyip
himself might well put in a word:
What did I do before I was born, the bunyip
asks the night;
I looked at myself in the water’s glass and 1
nearly died of fright;
Condemned to haunt a pool in the bush while
a thousand years go by—
Yet I walk on the stars like stepping-stones and
I’ll climb them into the sky.
This —and it goes for the rest of
Stewart’s contraband fauna —is com-
pletely dramatic characterisation. The
bunyip (it still goes for them all) does
not talk as he would if he was Mr.
Stewart ; he talks as Stewart talks be-
cause Stewart has become bunyip. As
a contrast:
Morning and evening
Maids heard the goblins cry: '
“Come buy our orchard fruits,
Come buy, come buy;
Apples and quinces,
Lemons and oranges,
Plump -unpecked cherries,
Melons and raspberries,
Bloom-down-cheeked peaches,
Swart-headed mulberries....”
Delightfully fruity, but entirely Miss
Rossetti herself telling a pretty fairy-
story about goblins: no goblins, even in
the fruit-barrow profession, ever said
anything of the sort. Nor, in Stewart’s
view of any of them, would
Fish say, they have the Stream and Pond ;
But is there anything Beyond?
in which the fish leave their brook to
become Brooke, Stewart’s bunyip, gur-
net, etc., stay where they belong ; and,
moreover, they know. The difference is
that between the non-dramatic and the
dramatic mind; between the Rossetti
goblins and Yeats’s fierce young woman;
Drown all the dogs,” said the fierce young
woman,
“They killed my goose and a cat.
Drown, drown in the water-butt,
Drown all the dogs,” said the fierce young
woman
the difference between Brooke’s in-
credibly uninformed Sunday School shoal
and Caliban declaring “No more dams
I’ll make for fish” or Ariel singing
Where the bee sucks, there suck 1:
In the cowslip’s bell I lie
There’s a" touch of Ariel’s nimble-
ness of fancy in Stewart’s mind ;
enough of Caliban to know a bunyip
when he hears one ; and clearly enough
of poetic imagination to, in the highly
authoritative prescription, make “familiar
objects be as if they were not familiar.”
C. M.
"Coast to Coast."
Coast to Coast, 1945, Angus and
Robertson’s anthology of the year’s best
short stories,, contains the following
selections:
“That ’42 Flow,” by Ken Levis; a
.comedy about beekeeping,,- humorous
realism in a setting of “trees, bees,
flowers and water.”
“The Pelican” and “Stiff Luck for the
Colonel,” by Cecil Mann: one a comedy
about a wowser who, seduced by the
devil in the shape of a pelican into fish-
ing on Sundays, becomes acclimatised to
life as sensible men live it in a small
town ; the other both comic and tragic—
a remarkable story of a Great War
veteran precariously maintaining his in-
tegrity in peace-time. Since both are
gamblers, the Colonel could be compared
with the Gordon C. Harday of Lawson
Glassop’s We Were the Rats. Glassop’s
is the more comic figure, Cecil Mann’s
the more profound ; and both writers are
rarities in that they portray the Digger
not as a sociological puppet but as a
human being—and a man.
“The Little Axe,” by J. D. Woods:
murder in a bush .town. Somehow it
seems to derive from O. Henry rather
than the Australian picaresque tradition
of Lawson’s Steelman and Smith yarns.
There seems to be an American saloon
atmosphere about Woods’s pub, and the
“wow” ending is certainly the typical O.
Henry mechanism. “Wow” endings are
usually poor art —mere trickery instead
of the natural development of character
—but the criticism hardly applies in this
case, for the characters are themselves
tricksters, making the snap-ending plaus-
ible. The landscape is Australian, also
the hard, realistic comedy.
“The Pleasure House,” by Norman
Lindsay: comedy of adolescence, printed
in last year’s Christmas Bulletin and
shortly to be published in book form
as an episode in a novel entitled Halfway
to Anywhere. R. G. Howarth wrote
not long ago that Norman Lindsay’s
Saturdee should be compared with Tom
Sawyer; the present commentator re-
read both books and found —we are all
inclined to underrate Australian writing
—that as a novel about boys (as distinct
from fiction for boys) Saturdee was
the better of the two: for, after the
realistic opening chapters, Mark Twdin
wandered off into melodrama about
Injun Joe. Halfway to Anywhere is in
the same vein as Saturdee.
“The Casey Country” and “Gant and
His Horses,” by Brian James: two from
Cookabundy Bridge, the collection that
won this year’s S. H. Prior Memorial
Prize. If there is a flaw —or, rather, a
limitation —to he found in Brian James’s
writing as a whole it is a lack of
dramatic excitement. Scenes of passion,
drama, tragedy are shown in the light of
a matured and mellow philosophy, so
that if one gains in wisdom one loses in
intensity. The drama is not immediate.
“The Casey Country,” humorous and
deeply pathetic, is told in this character-
istically quiet style; what could be a
dramatic novel compressed into a remi-
niscence. “Gant”—the moment when
that harsh man weeps for his dead horses
—leaves nothing to be asked for in the
way of drama.
“Uncle Patrick Was a Scholar” and
“Monday’s Washing Day,” by Margaret
Trist: light comedies. “Monday’s Wash-
ing Day” is a domestic sketch extracting
humor from such terrifying objects as
corsets, piles of laundry and softly-boiled
eggs; “Uncle Patrick,” though slighter
in construction and though Grandfather
demands “What’s the harm in a cock-
roach?” goes a little deeper into the
strata of the mind: for in both Grand-
father and Aunt Bridie, who discover
under the house a trunk full of books,
there is revealed a wistful yearning after
culture.
“Speak to Me,” by Marjorie Barnard:
a delicate, sensitive story linking a deaf
and dumb boy’s need for communication
with the attendants in a hospital with the
similar need in the surgeon’s son, who
died a prisoner in Malaya. A crystallisa-
tion of the universal human experience—
the isolation of the individual, the need
for speech—the story has a cold, melan-
choly quality, at once precise and evasive,
like the poetry of Eliot’s Four Quartets.
“Now, Then, Uncle Ted,” by Roderick
Finlayson: a hilarious comedy of New
Zealand, with an excellent study of
Maori who competes with Uncle Ted
a mad carnival of false generosity. T 1
“Uncle Ted” stories, loosely woven in
novel form, have recently been acceptec
for publication by Angus and Robertso
J. H. Melville’s “The White Rooste
and A. P. Gaskell’s “The Pig an
Whistle”—both also included in Coast
Coast —are a further proof that Ne
Zealand prose writers have come to grip
with their own earth. Melville, subtle i
thought and construction, deals with
retired proofreader searching for life anc
finding it unexpectedly ferocious. Gaske
has an out-of-the-way portrait of a pur
tan who burns down a pub.
“Dim. Carnival,” by Phil Freedman
concerning soldiers and girls in war-tim
Melbourne. Open to the criticism tha
it’s social history rather than art, th
people types rather than individuals. Bu
well done of its kind.
“Tank-Sinkers,” by Frank Dalby Davi-
son : the plot, in its essentials, is an old-
timer —a father’s long ride through the
bush to his sick children —yet it reads
convincingly. There are quietly faithful
portraits of bush characters: the Lawson
and Tom Collins tradition, rather toned-
down.
“Under the Bridge,” by J. K. Osborne:
a macabre, sombre story, with an excel-
lent description of fishing at night.
“Rub With a Circular Motion,” by
Myra Morris, and “Tinbilla Was Proud
of the Mostons,” by Don Edwards; the
countryside and country towns. Myra
Morris has a smart salesman, a yearning
maiden and some notable wowsers; Don
Edwards a family with seven strapping
sons who rule the roost in Tinbilla until
another family of the same impressive
dimensions comes to the district.
“The Break-up,” by Isabel Knox:
comedy of small girls and a most delight-
ful schoolmistress. There is something
very distinctive in Isabel Knox’s school-
girls ; in a feminine, more delicate way
they’re as amusingly alive as the urchins
of Saturdee or the hapless youths of “The
Pleasure House.” As if Katherine Mans-
field —sacrificing a little poetry for the
sake of a richer realism —had let herself
go and laughed. It is broadly humorous
writing afid yet, as one would say of
Chekhov but not of H. E. Bates and cer-
tainly not of Hemingway, aristocratic.
“The Enthusiastic Prisoner,” by E. 0.
Schlunke: one of those Italian prisoners-
of-war who seem to have given Schlunke
endless delight and who have infused into
his writing a life and spontaneity it
needed. Schlunke’s earlier stories, though
always pleasant, often seemed to be
written from a viewpoint about three
miles distant from the subject, as if he
was describing something seen through a
telescope. The Italians come bouncing
up right in the foreground of his later
work, like a form of spontaneous com-
bustion.
“Insurrection at Karrapoon,” by
Harold Thirkell: comedy of a deter-
mined small boy who does what all right-
minded boys have dreamed of —shoots at
the schoolmaster with a pearifle.
“Jellicoe,” by “Standby”; the out-
standing story from Little Known of
These Waters, a collection dealing mostly
with (the small ships that carried supplies
to the troops in New Guinea. A writer
who knows the sea and knows seamen.
Dealing directly with the man of action,
“Standby” is never likely to appeal to the
arty-crafty who prefer their war stories
in hysterical italics, but “Jellicoe” would
find a place quite naturally in “Black-
wood’s Magazine,” among Kipling’s
stories or even among Conrad’s.
“Father Clears Out,” by James Hack-
ston: Hackston’s “Father” has appeared
previously in Coast to Coast and many
times in The Bulletin. An Englishman,
hopelessly at sea in Australia, he’d make
an interesting contrast with Steele Rudd’s
“Dad.” Hackston is now preparing a
collection of the stories for publication
in book. form.
“Mike,” by John Fountain: a story of
the A.I.F. in Middle East and Greece,
distinguished by its fineness of style and
the clarity, balance and keen perception
of its portrait of a disciplinarian. Take
in the beautiful landscapes among the
snow and its pictures of action and
disaster and it may be -regarded as a
minor epic of the Greek campaign ; in
which it is fitting enough that the central
figure should be a brave but somewhat
muddled individual.
Three prizes, each of ten guineas, are
offered by Angus and Robertson for one-
act plays suitable for performance by
schoolchildren. The prize-winners and
other worth-while entries will be pub-
lished. Closing date March I, 1947.

Facts about the cost of the Transcontinental
railway ?
The railway was completed in October, 1917,
and the capital cost at June 30, 1918, was
£6,899,000. Further capital additions from time
to time brought the total cost at June 30, 1946,
to £9,265,000. This amount was made up of
£2,622,000 from revenue account, and £6,643,000
from loan account. Of the latter amount,
approximately £5,300,000 was borrowed from
the Australian Notes Fund and the balance
partly from other Commonwealth Trust Funds
and partly from the public. The greater portion
of Notes Fund moneys lent to the Treasury
for this purpose represented profits derived from
interest on investments. These loans were sub-
ject to interest at rates varying from 3£ p.c.
to 41 p.c. per annum, and a sinking fund of
10s. p.c. per annum was provided. When the
Note Issue was handed over to the Common-
wealth Bank in 1920 debt to the amount of
approximately £3,428,000 in respect of the East-
West railway was redeemed from the accu-
mulated profits of the Notes Fund. The balance
of the debt forms part of the public debt of
the Commonwealth, which matures at various
dates and is being redeemed in the ordinary
way through the National Debt Sinking Fund.

Which is the, longest stretch of straight railway
line in the world ?
The perfect straight across the Nullarbor Plain
on our Trans-Australian railway; it is 300
miles long. Prior to its construction the record
was held by a stretch of 205 miles on the
Argentine Trans-Andean railway from west of
Junin to the vicinity of Villa Mercedes.

Some information about the “Stinking
Roger”?
Tagetes minuta or Tagetes * glandulifera,
“Stinking Roger” or “Wild Marigold,” is a
native of South America but is naturalised in
many of the warmer parts of the earth. In
South Africa it is often spoken of as a parasiti-
cide for cattle, but no confirmatory controlled
experiments have been performed. The flowers
are used in the Argentine for stomachic,
aperient, diuretic and diaphoretic purposes and
in the treatment of gastritis and indigestion
Their use is, however, said to be somewhat
dangerous. In Australia, as is said, the juice
has an irritant effect on the eyes and skin,
and persons cutting the plant commonly develop
a form of dermatitis from the sharp seeds. The
plant, when eaten by dairy cows, taints milk
and butter severely. It is a rapid grower and
free seeder, and has been declared noxious in
most parts of the Union of South Africa. In
Australia it causes much trouble, and was
reported from the plant research station,
Palmerston North, New Zealand, in 1937 as
a potentially serious weed in that country.
Another plant, Tripteris clandestina, has also
been referred to as “Stinking Roger,” but the
former-named plant is the one more generally
known by this vernacular name.

Facts about Bren-gun carriers converted for

(1) Are rustless steel bolts as effective as
brass bolts in boat building and what are their
tensile strengths? (2) What will dissolve cello-
phane without injury to any component ?
(1) Rustless steel of the right variety is
equally good. Two types—l 2 p.c. to 14 p.c.
chromium steel or 28 p.c. nickel steel—are
excellent. Naval brass has a tensile strength ot
about 29 tons per sq. in., while steels vary
from 25 to 55 tpns per sq. in. When using
steel in small-craft construction it is important
to keep the steel away from other metals so
that bi-metallic corrosion may be avoided. (2)
Cellophane is a pure cellulose film, and the
only solvent for cellulose is a solution of copper
hydroxide in a strong ammonia and known as
cupf ammonium.
Brief Answers.
D.H.J.: Opals are usually cut with a metal
disk diamond saw, ground with carborundum
and polished with tin oxide and then rouge.
Very little pressure is used in the final stages
of polishing. A book on the subject is The
Art of Gem Cutting, published by Mineralogist
Publishing Co., Portland, Oregon, U.5.A...
H.M.: The most serious causes of the extinc-
tion of the Tasmanian abos. were their ruthless
massacre by whites, the ill-treatment of then
women by whites, influenza and the loss of
their hunting grounds. After their removal to
Flinders Island many died of melancholy and
homesickness, while the assumption of clothing
caused colds and chills that resulted in death.
P.M.J.: Unless he has a contract with the
hospital for such service, the doctor is entitled
to a fee of £1 Is. for administering anaesthetic.
G.P.T.: The Larmar car is manufactured
by the Larmar Engineering Co., Ingatestone,
Essex, England, and is sold by the sole con-
cessionaires, Hall’s Car Sales, Ltd., Odeon-
parade, Finchley, London... .C.D.: The book

matter J. 8.: Contact Mr. A. Morgan, Dis-
trict Irrigation Officer, Agricultural Centre,
Kerang R.G.S. ; (1) Radio Aid to Detection
and Ranging. (2) M. Bidault. Other questions
answered later A.P.: There are no fact?
available on the food value of the berries of the
ornamental cedar, but the seeds of the white
cedar are poisonous for stock. In general
all seeds have at least some food value, so il
the stock are eating them and no apparent
harm is being caused, then they are probably
deriving some benefit... .H.M.A.: Watervale,
S.A., is on the River Wakefield, and is one
of the loveliest spots in the valley. Abo. names
that would fit are Billabourie, good place near
water; Liaweena, near the stream; Omaroo,
near shade; Gubbanoo, beautiful view

Some are simply horrible.
Andy the atom, despairing, sat down
Hard on his proton and set up a wail;
Stories he’d heard of an atom’s renown
Shouldn’t be longer allowed to prevail.
Atoms had perished, but Andy well knew
Just what had happened all over the place;
Monsters had split all his brothers in two,
Andy himself was the last of his race'.
Atoms won’t suicide ’less they are told,
Custom decrees that it’s not circumspect;
Splits without leave are considered too bold, ,
Laws of tradition forbid them bisect.
Father of atoms, Democritus, heard
Whimpers where Andy lay airing his grief;
Slowly he whispered to Andy a word,
Wept as he watched Andy split with relief.
Centuries' later, when peace was restored,
Pilgrims assembled where they had descried
In an old garden, remote, unexplored,
Apple trees growing where Andy had died.
One of the pilgrims, a woman, repined,
Reached for an apple, her strength to restore;
“Wait,” said a man, “can’t you call to your mind
Something like this has once happened before?”

THE SEAFARING SMITH
BY RODERICK FINALAYSON
ONCLE Ted says “Jake, we’ll get
Pete to make a whipholder for
the new whip I bought at the
saddler’s.”
“Thought you only went in there for
a tin of harness rivets,” says Jake.
“Ah, nothing looks classier on a smart
turnout than a nice long whip well-
mounted, Jake,” says Uncle Ted. “And
Pete’s the man for any sort of ironwork,
even though he did spend most of his
life at sea.”
They drive over to Pete’s place in the
still afternoon of a Tidal Creek autumn
day, when the blue and gold dragonflies
are rising from the femleaves and hover-
ing almost motionless over the roadside
pools. Pete is dawdling about his smithy.
“Hallo, Ted,” he says. “How’s things?”
Uncle Ted says everything’s fine. He just
wants a whipholder made for the gig.
Pete says he can do that all right, but
just now he’s making a chisel for old
Bill up the road. “You know Bill —rides
that big roan mare?” Uncle Ted nods
gravely.
In the corrugated-iron shed the forge
fire shines cheerfully on the great anvil
in the middle of the hard earth floor and
on the vyce-bench by the wall, on piles
of scrap iron and on draperies of cob-
webs, on cartwheels and calipers and
heaps of horseshoes and tools and odd-
ments of all kinds in a glorious higgledy-
piggledy. Everything’s covered with a
grime of cinders and irondust, and every-
where is iron, and more subtle but more
prevalent than the smell of smoke the
smell of iron.
PETE shuffles about —looking for a
nice piece of steel, he says.
As he handles various lengths of metal
he strikes them with a little hammer to
ring out their differing musical notes,
“Here’s a fine piece of steel,” he says.
He draws his fingers along its length, he
feels the silky texture of its end grain, he
holds it to his nose and savors its special
smell. Jake reckons he kisses it.
'“Well, that’s half the job done and
I’ll leave it at that,” says Pete. “Now
let’s see this new whip of yours, Ted,”
he says, going over to where the pony
is hitched and leaning heavily on the side
of the gig while Uncle Ted shows off his
new whip. “Ay, nice whip,” says Pete,
while he screws up one eye and twists
his mouth and makes queer sucking
sounds, mentally measuring the whip-
handle and seeing where it’s to go on the
frontboard.
Jake likes the look of big, bulky, lazy
Pete. He’s a man - '
well palt middle-age
and he has a big
nose and mouth that
give him somehow
a kind look. His
rather loose, saggy
skin is tanned dark
and tough by the sun
and saltwater. Jake
thinks it makes him
look like a happy
old elephant. And
through the lobes
of his big loose ears he wears thin
gold rings that Jake admires and envies.
After he has pictured the whipholder
in his mind he asks Uncle Ted to give
him until the end of next week and he’ll
have it made. He says he’s pretty busy
just now, which makes Jake grin.
Uncle Ted says that will be O.K. And
then Pete insists on his visitors staying
for a cup of tea.
Pete lives in a squarish house with
brown painted weatherboards and a red
iron roof and a verandah along the front.
There are chairs of odd kinds on the
verandah —an old-fashioned American
rocker, two or three cane-bottoms, one of
which is fairly sound, a bench with a
wired-on back, and a horsehair sofa
horribly bumpy in some parts with the
springs poking through other parts. At
one end of the verandah there are two
pieces of dusty white coral, and by the
steps two great fluted seashells.
Pete goes to the front door, leans
heavily inwards with his hands on the
doorposts as though he would hke to
push the house down, and shouts,
“Visitors, Mum! Bring out the tea —and
plenty cakes!”
Somewhere from the back of the house
a strange squeaky voice answers, Jake
can’t hear what. Pete grunts, satisfied,
and flops on the verandah steps. Jake
sits on the edge of the verandah. Uncle
Ted chooses the best cane chair by the
wobbly green-painted table.
“Have some passion-fruit,” Pete says,
pulling wrinkled ripe fruit from the vine
that grows up the verandah posts and
tossing them to Jake. Pete pulls out a
twist of tobacco and offers it to Uncle
Ted, who says he has just filled his pipe,
he’ll smoke that first. And he relights
his almost empty pipe. Pete and Uncle
Ted argue vaguely, lazily, without heat,
about “the Gov’ment.” They come to a
deadlock. “What are you talking about?”
asks Pete. “I was referring to the
Gov’ment in the old country when I was
a lad.”
“Oh,” says Uncle Ted.
PRESENTLY “Mum” comes out with
plates of cakes and scones and bread
and cheese. She’s a dark woman like a
Maori yet somewhat
different. Her skin
is lighter, lemon-
colored almost. Her
hair is sleek, black
and straight, and
pulled back into a
big “b u n.” She’s
huge, and dressed
in a long, loose
blue gown she
looks bigger still, but there’s nothing
ungainly about her. She walks grace-
fully, majestically. Below the hem of
her gown her dusty bare feet shuffling
softly along the verandah boards look
as though they were never cramped in
shoes. She didn’t look up or speak at
first, but when she can’t avoid looking
at Uncle Ted and Jake she rolls her head
in a comical shy way and says something
with a girlish giggle that makes it impos-
sible to understand. Then she hurries
away and comes back with enamel bowls
of tea —strong, hot and sweet.
“That’s all, Mum,” Pete says, and she
pads softly off to the bacly of the house
again, giggling as she goes. From the
kitchen comes a happy shrill singing and
the rattle of dishes. On the verandah
the cakes are eaten, the big brown
earthenware teapot is nearly empty.
“Won’t your missus ever eat with us?”
Uncle Ted asks. “She goes off whenever
I drop in here.”
“Oh, she likes it best that way,” says
Pete. “Comes of being brought up in the
Islands, I guess. Never quite know why
I married her if it comes to that.”
“Pete met her when he was a sailor
in those parts,” Uncle Ted tells Jake.
“Didn’t you, Pete?”
“Ay, that’s right,” says Pete. “Comes
of running away from my father’s smithy
as a lad. Anyhow, I was on the old
Tubai at the time, the usual Island
schoqner, y’know. Sailed out of Papeete
with supplies for some of the outer group
and, by hokey, what happens? I go down
with some flaming sickness, not the usual
fevers y’know, but something no one can
guess what. Looked like I’d conk out
and old Cap Sorenten went and dumped
me ashore at Maruvai. Just the usual
kind of place you find everywhere in
them seas —reef, nasty rocky lagoon, and
a bunch of coconut trees. I remember
an argument I had with the agent there,
something about brandy or rum. What
was it now?” He pauses and scratches
over his left ear,
“But you were dying,” Uncle Ted cuts
in. “Tell the boy here how the trader
looked after you. Or was it the trader’s
daughter? Ha, ha!”
“Wasn’t talking about the trader,” says
Pete. “Trader’s name was Blare. Little
Cockney bloke.”
“Kept a funny sort of store, didn’t
he?” says Uncle Ted.
“Ay, that’s right,” says Pete, looking
surprised. “Funny was no name for it.
Look, I tell you there was things in it
out of the Ark. Honest, I seen things
that was made when Queen Victoria was
only a piccaninny. There was the store,
just the usual palm-thatch hut under the
coconut trees, stuck up on poles away
from the rats and the landcrabs, away
there in the Pacific Ocean, and you go
inside and there’s flyspotted cards of gilt
brooches with the old-time royal family
on them in tintype colors, and ladies’
belts with the elastic part moulded away
but the big glass-diamond buckle left, and
gents’ cream garden-party pants all water-
stained. God! and false hair and glass
eyes, blue and green, and pink scent-
bottles with the scent all dried out of
tjiem. Seemed he never sold a thing.
And why?”
“DECAUSE of them Holy Willies,”
E 3 says Uncle Ted emphatically.
Seems it’s a game, Jake thinks. Uncle
Ted has heard all this before and he
wants to hear it again like a kid with a
favorite story.
“Ay,” says Pete, reflectively, after a
pause, “Them Holy Willies! Y’see,
way back in the eighteen-hundreds some
queer brand of missionaries came and
converted the natives of Maruvai and
went on to fresh mission fields. They
left a native deacon in charge—old Jona
as he was called. By hokey, it wasn’t
long before the old rascal was running
the whole show. Everything them people
naturally wanted to do was wrong, and
everything old Jona wanted them to do
for him was right. And that was the
state of affairs when I was dumped there.”
“But why couldn’t the trader sell his
goods?” Jake asks, thinking he may as
well take a hand in the game.
Uncle Ted takes his chance to explain.
“Old Jona made the people grow bananas
when they weren’t working for him, and
the mission schooner came and took the
bananas and left American canned food
and cotton gowns and mission tracts in
payment. So how could they buy from
the trader?” says Uncle Ted crossly, as
though Jake should have had the sense to
know all this,
“Am I telling the yarn or are you?”
Pete asks patiently when Uncle Ted
comes to a pause. “Well, you couldn’t
blame poor old trader Blare for always
getting drunk, could you?” Pete goes on.
“Blare brewed oceans of banana booze
—gave him the jimjams.”
“Didn’t they sell decent liquor in the
pub there?” asks Uncle Ted.
“Pub? Pub? Weren’t no pubs on
Maruvai. Didn’t I tell you them Holy
Willies had charge of everything?” says
Pete. “Talk about puritans ! Down there
a man had to sleep in a different village
from his wife.”
“You didn’t tell me that before,” says
Uncle Ted. “That’s very strange. I don’t
see how they could manage at all.”
“Of course there were rumors that old
Jona kept a bit of good liquor hidden
away’” Pete says, disregarding Uncle Ted.
“But surely the trader would get away
from such an unprofitable place,” Jake
persists. •
“Didn’t Pete tell you? The Agent
wouldn’t let him go,” says Uncle Ted.
“No, he didn’t,” says Jake. “So there
was an Agent there, too?”
“Ay,” says Pete. “Blare was in debt
for fines, taxes, customs dues as old as
his ’stock, and so on. Resident Agent
wouldn’t let him go without he paid up.”
“How could he pay if he never sold
anything?” says Jake.
“Ah, that’s just it,” Pete agrees.
“All that part of the story should have
come before,” Uncle Ted interrupts
knowingly.
Pete glares—and goes on. “Never did
see a man more lonely than that Agent.
By hokey, he was a lonely one,” says
Pete. “Y’see, in his position he couldn’t
mix with the natives social like —though,
mind you, they said he had ways and
means. But, anyway, he couldn’t mix open
like and friendly. And he couldn’t mix
with the trader, so to speak. Y’see, Blare
had let himself down pretty low always
being fined and in debt. And getting the
jimjams. Besides marrying a native
woman.”
“Oh, he married a native, too?” Jake
says.
“Of course, didn’t you know that?”
says Pete.
“Well, you didn’t say,” Jake replies.
£ < D LARE was the next loneliest man
D i ever see,” says Pete. “Always
sprawling under a breadfruit tree with
banana booze jimjams blubbering about
dear old London and could I tell him
was it a king or a queen in Buckingham
Palace now. Can you beat it? The only
two Englishmen within thousands of
miles, and there was one in his buttoned-
up white tunic with his brand-new white
topee setting on the office table beside
him shut up in his Residency on the
“Hill,” which was about 20 feet higher
than the rest of the island. And there
was the other on the beach in dirty
pyjamas dreaming of his beloved sover-
eign. And that old kanaka Jona the
real ruler of all he surveyed.”
“But there was you,” Uncle Ted re-
minds him.
“Ay,” says Pete. “And me likely to
become the third loneliest man I ever see.
Me going and letting old Jona marry me
to one of Blare’s halfcaste girls.”
“Oh,” says Jake, “you didn’t tell us you
married one of them.”
“You muddle me all up. That part
should have come first,” Pete says.
“It’s what he’s been telling us about all
the time, isn’t it?” says Uncle Ted. “How
he come to meet his wife.”
“Don’t know what come over me,”
says Pete, “The illness must’ve weakened
me somehow.”
“Or perhaps it was the trader’s bad
booze,” suggested Uncle Ted.
Pete has a far away look in his eye.
“Funny thing,” he says, “but y’see it was
the first bit of home life I had since the
day I run away from home. And her
waiting on me and cooking me special
little treats to make me strong again,
y’see. And she weren’t bad-looking in
them days.”
“Aha, that was it,” says Uncle Ted.
“A nice little Island peach in nothing
but beads and a whatcha-mecallem doing
the hula-hula at you under the tropical
moon. Can’t you imagine the gay old
dog, Jake?”
As if Uncle Ted had touched a spring
Pete jumps up on the verandah and,
making out that he’s twanging a guitar,
he chants with immense gusto, “Hu -la!
Hu -la! A /-eel” He rolls his eyes, and
with astonishing ease he wiggles his fat
tummy under his thin black shirt, to
Uncle Ted’s great enjoyment and Jake’s
admiration and surprise. From the
kitchen comes shrill laughter.
But as soon as Uncle Ted lets out his
loud guffaw Pete, just as suddenly as he
jumped up, slumps down again on the
steps with a grin.
“Crikey, no,” he
says quietly. “She
wore down-to-the-
ground gowns like
you see her in now.
But I’ll admit her
waist was slimmer,
and she had some
playful ways. No, I
reckon it was tha
other thing—a man
wants a home some-
time. Y’see, I never
did court one or
more of them
Island girls. Plenty in Papeete for me.
But marry one of them? By hokey! And
there I was, and old Jona trying to make
me go sleep in another blooming village
—unless he got a few dollars handout.”
“But Pete got away,” Uncle Ted tells
Jake.
“Too right I got away,” Pete says.
“When the Tubai called in again about
three months later, by hokey, I hopped
aboard mighty quick. Of course I had
to take her with me,” Pete adds. “And
that finished my sailing days. I wasn’t
going to settle on no little island like
poor old Blare and end up on the beach.
So I came here to Tidal Creek, where I
guessed I wouldn’t feel the winters too
chilly in my old bones. Being a sea-
faring man I naturally thought I’d like
a little farm. And being ray father’s son
I end up with the old forge .fire,”
UNCLE Ted says well, they’ll have to
be getting along. He and Jake thank
Pete for the nice afternoon tea, and they
wander down the garden path past the
cannas and ginger plants and peach-trees
to the gig. In the house “Mum” is still
singing, unseen.
“You won’t forget the whipholder?”
Uncle Ted shouts from the gateway.
“Ay, next Wednesday—or Friday at
the latest —or anyway as soon as I can,”
says Pete, waving reassuringly.
As they’re driving home Uncle Ted
says “There you are, Jake, just what I’m
always telling you. Look at poor old
Pete saddled for life with that big fat
old woman. Look how she landed him.
They’re all the same.”
“I think she’s nice, and she’s good to
Pete,” says Jake.
“Landed him with a houseful of squall-
ing brats you mean,” says Uncle Ted.
“Now they’ve grown up and deserted
their old man. I ain’t got none to worry
about, thank God!”
“Well, she can cook pretty good cake,”
Jake says.
“Pretty good cake!” says Uncle Ted.
“You should’ve seen the cake I used to
bake.”
“Well,” says Jake, “you don’t have
cake now like old Pete.”
“I could bake better cake tomorrow —if
that’s all I wanted to do,” says Uncle Ted.
After a while Uncle Ted makes some
fancy flourishes with his whip and laughs
quietly to himself, thinking of Pete caught
like that. Just to visit Pete and drag the
story out of him again always cheers
Uncle Ted immensely.

RUSSIA’S HALF-FORGOTTEN BARGAINING.
Stalin’s “no-danger-of-war” statement
may have caused “intense relief and
pleasure in Britain, America and Russia,”
as has been claimed, if only because as
stated by Leslie Gould, financial editor
of the N.Y. “Journal-American,” “the
one country that threatens the peace of
the world is Russia,” but there was a
noteworthy caution in the opinions ex-
pressed in newspaper comment both in
America and Britain. London “Times”
found it “particularly welcome in view
of irrefutable evidence of the manu-
facture of naval, air and land forces’
equipment by German factories in the
Russian zone.”
One reason for the caution in apprais-
ing the statement could probably be
found in “the knowledge of the Soviet’s
willingness as recently as 1939 to make
an alliance with the Nazis in order to
achieve what they consider to be their
destiny.”
That half-forgotten bargaining between
Stalin and Hitler has been refreshed in
memory by the discovery in Berlin of
.“secret files of the Reichschancellery”
giving “details of the negotiations and
of the agreements reached.” Frank
Gervasi, reviewing them in “Collier’s,” de-
clares “they tell an ugly story. There is
little in them to inspire Anglo-American
confidence in the objectives of Russian
diplomacy.
“The position taken in 1939 and 1940
by the Soviet is of utmost importance as
a guide to Russian imperial policy. Ger-
man betrayal of promises made to Russia
does not mitigate the fact that the Soviet
tried to secure from Hitler what it has
already obtained and continues to seek
from the Allies. Had Hitler met all of
the Soviet’s conditions, according to the
captured documents, the U.S.S.R. might
have become a partner in the Italo-
German-Japanese Tripartite Pact which
had begun as a Rome-Berlin alliance
against the Comintern!
“The negotiations began when Hitler
discovered Russia’s failure to secure a
pact with Britain and France. Hitler
sounded out Stalin, and the latter, like
Barkis, was ‘willin’.’ Hitler informed
Stalin that he was prepared to recognise
the Soviet’s ‘primary interest from the
Baltic to the Black Sea,’ and Stalin con-
sented to receive a German diplomatic
mission.
“There was considerable and sharp dis-
cussion of ‘spheres of interest’ and a
non-aggression pact was finally signed on
August 23, 1939. The Soviet ‘sphere’
was defined as including Finland, Estonia,
Latvia to the Dvina River, eastern Poland
to the right bank of the Vistula and
Bessarabia. Stalin insisted on the reparti-
tion of Poland.”
Gervasi quotes an analysis by Ribben-
trop on the Russian reasons for accepting
the pact:
(1) The Soviet Government was freed of
the fear of an imminent German attack,
(2) a war in the west would weaken the
capitalist Powers and create a condition
favorable to the further spread of Com-
munism, (3) at a pen stroke the Soviet
Union got a free hand in the Baltic States,
and (4) Russia’s never abandoned claims
to Bessarabia, key to penetration into south-
eastern Europe, were fulfilled.
In September there was another treaty
redefining “spheres of influence.”
“Lithuania was placed wholly in the
Soviet sphere and Germany got the
Polish district of Lublin as compensa-
tion.” In November, 1940, Molotov was
in Berlin for “further talks.” “Hitler
and the Soviet Foreign Commissar dis-
cussed the whole range of Soviet interests
from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and Der
Fiihrer told Stalin’s emissary that Great
Britain was ‘substantially defeated’ and
that in the subsequent liquidation of the
British Empire, the interests of the
U.S.S.R. should be directed toward ob-
taining an outlet to the ‘warm open sea’
via Iran to the Persian Gulf. Molotov
said he didn’t believe the time was yet
ripe to make any definite agreements
along those lines but added that ‘in due
course’ the Soviet would be prepared to
discuss the problems further.
“Molotov then demanded to know why
the Soviet had not been invited to take
part in the discussions which led to the
so-called Vienna Award of August, 1940,
whereby Transylvania was assigned to
Hungary. This was the first real clash
of Russian and German imperial in-
terests. Hitler replied that he didn’t be-
lieve that the Soviet was primarily con-
cerned in the matter.”
Molotov asked “whether the German-
Rumanian ‘treaty of guarantee’ was
directed against the Soviet. ‘There is no
—Dublin “Opinion.”
DILEMMA IN THE KREMLIN.
“It’s getting more and more difficult to remain an enigma.
reason for fear on the part of the Soviet.’
Hitler told him, ‘in view of the excellent
relations between our two countries and
the recent settlement [concession of Bes-
sarabia and northern Bukovina] irj, the
Soviet Union’s favor.’
“Molotov then asked Hitler what the
German position might be in* the event
the Soviets negotiated a similar treaty
with Bulgaria. Hitler’s irritation with
Molotov’s insistence on the importance
of Bulgaria in the Soviets’ scheme of
things in the region of the Dardanelles
was obvious.
“Molotov then raised the pay-off ques-
tion —that of the Dardanelles. Russia,
he told Hitler, had ‘often been attacked
through this strategic waterway and
couldn’t be satisfied merely with paper
guarantees in the future.’ Hitler was
non-committal.”
Thereafter there was a steady deteriora-
tion in the German-Russian relationships.
Hitler began to lay the basis of propa-
ganda in Balkan and Turkish countries
to prepare the way for the support of
those nations of the German invasion of
the U.S.S.R. The Turkish Ambassador
to Berlin was informed that “Russia’s
price for adherence to the Axis was (1)
the recognition of Soviet ‘security in-
terests’ in the Black Sea, (2) military and
air bases in the Dardanelles and the
Bosphorus and (3) establishment of a
Soviet military mission in Ankara.”
It was on the Russian demands for a
controlling influence in the Dardanelles
that the German-Russian pact finally
broke down.
Gervasi thinks it “obvious from an
examination of the records that Soviet
policy concerning eastern and south-
eastern Europe today is identical with
the one pursued in 1939-40 in the negotia-
tions with the Germans. This is evident
in Soviet acquisition of Finland, incor-
poration of the Baltic States in the Soviet
Union and acquisition of eastern Poland
as well as in the system of alliances
negotiated with Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia, and in the degree of
control the Soviets exercise over the in-
ternal affairs of Rumania, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Austria and Germany.”
There is some justification for the belie!
that no matter what Stalin or his associ-
ates may say on any given occasion the
Kremlin has not yet lost sight of the
aims it had in view in 1939.
TO GUARD THE BRITISH LIFELINE.
With Britain offering India her free-
dom and Egypt the withdrawal of British
troops, American observers have looked
for a new pattern in British strategy for
the defence of the Empire. They have
found it in the new importance of
Palestine bases and a wide-flung network
of Mediterranean strongpoints, and in a
renewed insistence on the establishment
of friendly relations with countries whose
geographical position gives them a stra-
tegic importance in British eyes.
Frederick Kuh, writing in the Chicago
“Sun,” finds that “it is the aim of creat-
ing a counter-
weight to Russia
that puts its
stamp on British
foreign policy
everywhere.
Britain is relying
on a future
regime in an in-
dependent India
which is certain
to choose Britain
rather than
Russia as an ally.
And when British
troops have left
Egypt it will be
Egyptian conser-
vatives, mostly
big landowners,
who remain in
authority there.
Britain will va-
cate no chair on
which Joseph
Stalin might sit
down.”
He thinks that
“The hub of
British - Russian
rivalry is in Ger-
many. Whoever
prevails in Ger-
many will in the
long run, and per-
haps in the short
run, control
Europe. Germany
is ‘up for grabs.’ Into which orbit she
drifts is all the more decisive because the
old balance of power in Europe is gone.
“It was by this system of checks and
balances that Britain, standing just a little
outside and occasionally shifting her
weight from one side to the other, held
the lever. Today the Soviet Union is the
strongest factor in Europe. To redress
this Britain is leaning toward America.
Instead of poising midway between the
U.S.S.R. and the United States,
has chosen American partnership.”
On the importance of Germany as a
“rampart of British defence,” William
Henry Chamberlin is in agreement. Writ-
ing in the “Wall-street Journal” he
claims that “the time has passed when
Britain could think of defence as begin-
ning at the white cliffs of Dover.. She
must watch her present occupation zone
in Germany. Whatever may be the
American decision about future occupa-
tion policy Great Britain would scarcely
feel able to withdraw from the line of
the Elbe until, and unless, there is a
corresponding Russian withdrawal from
Eastern Germany. Space is a valuable
consideration in an age of air and
mechanised warfare.”
New York “Times” correspondent
Mallory Browne believes the British
planning is well advanced. He points
out that “it is often said ‘the Russians
have got the advantage of us ; they know
exactly what they want and have their
plans all laid to get it.’ The assumption
is that the democracies in the West don’t
know what they want, and if they did
they wouldn’t know how to go about
planning to get it. But Britain today
believes in planning, not only for things
like foreign trade and finance, but for
diplomacy and strategy as well.
“The trouble is that Russia also be-
lieves in planning on a big scale. Its
plans include nothing less than a Com-
munist world. And to begin with, Mos-
cow has very precise plans for Com-
munising and extending its influence over
the countries all along its borders. The
result is that Britain’s plans for the
security and defence of the Empire come
into sharp conflict with Russian plans,
not just at one point, but at a grow-
ing number of points all the way from
Gibraltar to Singapore and beyond.
“For the moment,” says Browne, “the
clash is sharpest in the Middle East.
Under the surface in the Middle East is
oil. And underlying the concern in Lon-
don over the situation in Persia, in
Palestine, in Egypt is strategy. Oil and
strategy may not be synonymous, but
they are inseparable so far as the Middle
East is concerned.
“Britain’s plans for defence of the vital
oil interests in the Middle East as well
as of the Empire lifeline of communi-
cations through the Mediterranean Sea
and the Suez Canal out to India and
Australia come up against the Soviet
Government’s plans. Instead of try-
ing to sit tight on bayonets Britain is
trying to base its strategy, in the Middle
East and elsewhere on the friendship of
the various Governments and peoples.
“It is withdrawal from Egypt that ha?
made the Palestine issue so crucial. For
Suez must be defended, and for that bases
will be needed not too far away. The
southern plain of Palestine and Trans-
jordan offers such a military and air base.
It is only a couple of hours’ flying time
from Suez and only three hours or so
from the oil fields in Irak. How to replace
the naval base at Alexandria is less easy.
Haifa will help and will be utilised, for
it is the Mediterranean terminal of the
oil pipeline from the Irak fields. It is
also scheduled to be the terminus of the
pipeline from the American-controlled oil
fields in Saudi Arabia.
“Even more important than Haifa is
Cyprus. The island is well situated to
guard not only the sea approaches to
Suez but the exit from the Dardanelles
and the Aegean. It has a good natural
harbour, Famagusta, and good terrain for
the development of airfields. It is certain
to be well developed. But already the
Cypriots are restive ; Left Wing influence
is growing. Britain will have to plan
boldly and act quickly if it is to forestall
the development of popular resentment.
“The British, while they are deter-
mined to hold on to their strategic points
in the Mediterranean and the Middle
East as long as possible, realise they must
make other plans drawn to a much
larger scale. The next war will require
nothing less than continents as bases, and
Britain is planning its strategy on this
global basis. South Africa will be

needed, and the route around the Cape
must be built up in case the Middle East
goes and Suez is indefensible. Gibraltar
itself causes some concern, though not
immediately. At the other end of the life-
line Singapore is being reassessed. From
India come reports that the Russians are
waiting for the British to leave India to
begin their pressure-from-within tactics
in Afghanistan, doorway from the
U.S.S.R. into China. As a possible
counter the British are supporting Tibet’s
claim to independence from China and
angling strongly for a treaty giving
Britain rights to certain bases in Tibet,
These are all things for the future.”
Another N.Y. “Times” man, Sydney
Gruson, also sees Palestine as “the key
to the new strategy” and linked with it
“a whole series of island and mainland
air and naval establishments stretching
from Malta all the way down to Aden
and Kenya crown colony in British East
Africa.
‘ “Additional protection of perhaps a
temporary nature has been provided by
the establishment of British military rule
in the captured Italian colony of Libya
with its naval and air base facilities at
Benghazi and Tobruk. Britain’s actions
have been prompted by the danger to her
if Benghazi and Tobruk were in un-
friendly hands —and she will fight any
settlement that threatens her position
there.
“The southern half of the Middle East
strategic picture has not been filled in
as the Mediterranean end. Still, the
possibilities are well known. At the
southern end of the Red Sea is Aden with
its facilities for the fleet, and across the
Gulf is the arid, unattractive territory of
British Somaliland suitable for air
bases. Kenya, the Crown Colony of nearly
a quarter-million miles stretching from
the Indian Ocean to the borders of the
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, is ideally located
for a powerful base that could provide
a watching point for all Middle East
communications.”
Dictatorship’s Twin.
From Britain come intimations of an-
other demonstration that economic plan-
ning centrally administered cannot five
with the freedoms basic to a democracy;
that economic planning requires that
there be in the hands of the adminis-
trators authority which is not only un-
questioned but unquestionable.
When the Government instituted bread
rationing it was criticised by sections of
the British press. Officials of the Gov-
ernment denounced the critics and sug-
gested that counter measures might be
necessary. The important thing is that,
an official can hint at reprisals on critics.
There are two main ways in which
men can register their questions about a
plan. One of the ways is financial. In
case of a Government, they can refuse
to lend it their savings. This difficulty
is not hard to meet. It was easy for
the Government in Britain because it
had only to continue war-time controls
over capital. Nevertheless one of its
first acts was to make control more
secure by nationalising the Bank of Eng-
land, at the same time bringing private
banks more securely under control.
The other way in which men can
register their opinions is to speak them
or write them. It would be silly to
suggest that in any near to-morrow free-
dom of the press will disappear in
Britain. It would equally be idle to
neglect the fact that curbs on the press
have been suggested by a Government
which controls finance and production
and distribution of key materials.
Recently there has taken place among
Americans of liberal mind a change of
attitude toward Russia. Sincere men
who were loath to believe the critics of
Russian dictatorship have seen that the
Russian idea must suppress freedom, not
only of its own people but also of
peoples over whom Russia can claim
domination. Many believe that the un-
wholesome features of Russian policy are
because of some peculiar quality in the
Russian rulers, that in other places, under
other conditions the attempt to impose
a plan will have more wholesome results.
We can see no evidence that they are
right. In Germany, Italy, Russia and
Japan the attempt at planning produced
dictatorship. There are ample grounds
for believing that the attempt to effec-
tuate the plan and the tyranny of dic-
tatorship are inseparable twins. It is true
that the peoples who tried planning had
little tradition for self-government. The
British, who have that tradition, may
find a compromise that will allow plan-
ning in a free society. The omens are
otherwise. —“ Wall-street Journal.”
“United States of Europe”?
Mr. Churchill’s suggestion in his speech
at Zurich that the "sovereign remedy”
for the “tragedy of Europe” is “to re-
create the European fabric —to build a
kind of United States” based on “a
partnership between France and Ger-
many” so that they could “take the lead
together” sounded much more hopeiul
than possible. London “Times” re-
garded it as another example of
Churchill’s “special skill in dropping into
the waters of international relations
stones whose ripples last long and travel
far,” but posed the question whether “the
remedy he prescribes is one to which
Europe will submit,” The “Times”
thought it would be generally “admitted
that there are few signs of it.
“Even in Western Europe there is little
to suggest that the unity so much spoken
of is on the way. In Eastern Europe
there is developing a unity of another
kind, to which clearly the rest of the
Continent, were it ever called upon to
do so, would not readily assent.”
“The conception of a United States of
Europe is not new. But the version of
it Churchill recommends seems novel, at
least under that name, and to many
dangerous under any name. Many will
see in his speech a call not for a United
States of Europe but for a United States
of Western Europe. That, indeed, is
what takes the speech out of the realm
of truisms into that of controversy.’ If
Russia came into his projected Council
of Europe, he said, then all indeed would
be well. If there was any chance of
Russia coming in on Mr. Churchill’s
terms, it might be retorted, then all would
be unnecessary. The speech was, in fact,
based on the assumption that Europe is
already irrevocably divided between East
and West. This is the peril of his argu-
ment and of its enunciation at this
moment.”
As the “Times” saw it “the call was
given a still more challenging turn by
the inclusion of Germany within the
unity he postulates. He speaks as a man
of unique experience, uniquely respected,
but he speaks as a man without responsi-
bility for his country’s policy. Those who
now bear that responsibility are not be-
hind him in idealism.
“British policy has not yet despaired,
and cannot yet afford to despair, of
averting the division of Europe and the
world into two. It has not yet despaired
of making Germany, not a factor in the
balance of East against West or of West
against East, or a pawn divided between
the two, but a united State which, under
joint control, will strengthen and embody
the unity of the controlling Powers, and
it cannot be assisted by the impli-
cations that will be read into the
speech .at Zurich. So long as the
purposes of unity and conciliation
can be maintained, British policy, while
always preserving the unity of Europe as
a conception and even looking for a
United States of Europe as the eventual
ideal, cannot work for such a United
States of Europe as Churchill must be
taken to have meant.”
Referring to Churchill’s belief that “the
first step will be to form a Council of
Europe” the “Times” claimed that “the
first practical steps of British policy must
necessarily be more humdrum ; and they
may prove to be best directed along the
path of economics rather than of politics.”
It thought “the most practical steps which
Europe is taking today towards greater
unity may well be represented by the
Franco-British economic agreement, the
progress being made towards economic
union between Holland and Belgium, and
the project for setting up an Economic
Commission for Europe. The most effec-
tive next steps will be the opening of
exchange and intercourse with eastern
Europe and, above all, the Soviet itself
in the urgent tasks of reconstruction.”
It would be time to consider the Chur-
chill suggestion “if British hopes of main-
taining a wider unity in Europe were to
prove ultimately and unmistakably vain.
But it remains to be seen whether French
opinion will be prepared to tolerate, even
from Mr. Churchill, the suggestion that
‘the first step in the recreation of the
European family must be a partnership
between France and Germany,’ and Ger-
many today is in no position to offer
partnership to anyone, still less a part-
nership that acknowledged and ratified
her own division between East and West.”
The Danube Blockaded.
Russia is seeking sole control of trade
along the Danube, realising that such
command of that vital artery would bring
with it the virtual overlordship of tne
whole of central and eastern Europe.
The “World Report” says that “the
political and economic independence of
70 million people is caaight in the con-
flict over the future of\ the river” and
the N.Y. “Herald Tribune’ sees “freedom
of navigation of the Daimibe developing
into a very tight diplomatic tussle be-
tween the U.S. and Russia.”
The Danube winds for 1750 miles
through six countries. Russia hopes for
the creation of a Danubian sphere of
economic influence —the river would
carry the agricultural and industrial pro-
duction of all that vast region to Russia,
and carry Russian exports in return, to
the exclusion of trade with' countries
outside of Europe. The U.S. wants free-
dom of trade along the river.
“Russia now rules the Danube!;” claims
the “World Report”—“a million Red
Army troops garrison the countries on its
banks from Austria to the Black Sea.
Russia is meeting Western pressure for
free trade by insisting that the regulation
of trade is the business of only the
Danubian countries, including hearself.
Russia became a Danubian country in
1940 when she recovered Bessarabia, a
province at the Danube’s mouth awarded
to Rumania after World War I, In the
U.S. view, this river frontage does not
give Russia the right to dominate the
Danube.”
Russia “has bottled up the trade which
once flowed upstream to the West,” but
is faced, herself, with problems in a
serious lack of river craft.
“The U.S. is ready to bargain with
tangible assets if the Russians are willing.
These assets include both ships and ship-
building facilities. Some 700 ships, about
one-third of the Danube River shipping,
were moved upriver before the advancing
Red Army toward the end of the war.
The Linz shipyards, among the biggest
builders of Danube boats, are within the
U.S. zone in Austria. Russia is seeking
a share of these ships and of the output
of the Linz yards through a demand for
a 50 per cent, interest in Austrian ship-
ping companies. This demand is not
new. Through similar demands, Russia
already has obtained a half-interest in
Hungarian and Rumanian firms.”
[lt is interesting to note the N.Y.
“Herald Tribune’ report that Russia
varies her demand for a 50 per cent,
interest in the shipping companies with a
claim for sole ownership “as, a German
asset under the Potsdam agreement.”]
Meanwhile, says the “World Report,”
“the economic recovery of six countries
depends to a large extent on a revival
of Danube traffic upstream with the West
as well as downstream to Russia,
“Czechoslovakia is in desperate need
of imports, but two-thirds of her Danube
fleet is being used to carry supplies
for the Red Army. Czech industry suf-
fers from the loss of petroleum and wheat
which once came up from Rumania.
Austria cannot hold out much longer
against Russia’s demands unless she gets
from the West the supplies vital to her
industrial and economic recovery. Russia
now controls the Austrian oilfields and
also keeps the Danube closed to the
700.000 tons of agricultural products im-
ported annually by Austria from Hun-
gary, Yugoslavia and Rumania before
the war. Rumania and Hungary both
leased all their port facilities and ships to
companies in which Russia has a 50 per
cent, share. Russia also gets 50 per
cent, of the exports of both countries.
Under this arrangement Rumania,
once the biggest shipper on the
Danube, loses Western markets for
1.630.000 tons of petroleum and grain
annually and lacks the 250,000 tons of
goods imported each year from upriver
countries. Hungary can no longer swap
|600,000 tons of coal and grain with the
West yearly for 400,000 tons of
machinery and industrial equipment.
Yugoslavia gets from Russia some
petroleum and industrial materials,
but not enough to make up for the loss
of the 218,000 tons of imports she got
from the West in 1936. Bulgaria, with
ports on the Black Sea, depends less on
the Danube for her trade with the West
than do other European countries. Up-
river countries, however, will miss Bul-
garia’s tobacco until Danube trade is
free.”
The “World Report” concludes that
“some arrangement must be found soon
if the Danube’s west-bound trade, norm-
ally three times the east-bound volume,
is to be recovered. Eastern Europe
looks to this recovery for political and
economic independence.”

Switzerland was peculiarly appropriate for
the launching of, a call for a United States of
Europe. Common interests, a common culture
overriding diversities of language, and common
dangers were able to make out of the cantons
of Switzerland a confederation, so that today
it is a State united yet multiple, homogeneous
yet diverse, and with a record of peace unique
in Europe. But if the history of Switzerland
as a confederation offers this example, her
history as a State among the other States of
Europe also proclaims the difficulties. Clinging
ever more firmly to her neutrality, Switzerland
has proved herself least ready of all the States
of Europe to unite with her neighbors in com-
mon enterprises. If Mr. Churchill’s United
States of Europe ever comes into being,
Switzerland will hardly be a founding member.

Soviet satellite States at the peace conference
are goose-stepping on Molotov’s command
with expected precision, but beneath that ex-
ternal discipline and obedience there is a sur-
prising restiveness. One cause of the discomfort
is the constant public humiliation inevitable in
puppet relationships. Poles, Czechs and Yugo-
slavs are extremely proud peoples. Because of
their long histories as subjects of foreign rulers
and more lately as victims of German tyranny,
they now are almost morbidly sensitive about
national freedom —especially the outward forms
and symbols of independence. So they don’t
find it easy to goose-step at the conference.
Molotov, if he wished, could minimize this
humiliating relationship in public. Instead, he
ticems to rub it in. When he reverses his tactics
in the middle of a meeting he nearly always
succeeds in confusing not his opponents but his
satellites. They may be faithfully following the
old party line, making last-ditch speeches, when
Molotov switches to a new line. Then, shame-
facedly, they must vote the opposite way to
their fiery declarations. Under the Soviet-bloc
system satellites are moved as pawns in a
diplomatic and military game for the benefit
of imperial Red power, which not always —
indeed rarely—profits the satellite. Ludwell

The Italian and Austrian Governments de-
serve congratulations on their agreement over
South Tyrol. The agreement provides equality
of cultural and economic rights for all inhabi-
tants of South Tyrol; frontier traffic is to be
made easier, and provision is made for customs
privileges in the exchange of local product's.
It is a sobering comment on the extent of
Allied division that this — agreement, the most
practical and sensible product of the Paris con-
ference so far, should be due not to the Allies
but to the .initiative of two ex-enemy States.
The agreement provides an object lesson which
all Allied Spates can study with advantage.
It is a practical recognition of three simple
facts. The first is that no State can reason-
ably hope to Ret all it wants. The second is
that something less can still be worth having,
and can be worked for and accepted with no
loss of dignity and prestige. The third is that
the best way of gaining something, once the
hope of gaining' all has been renounced, is not
to indulge in extravagant claims or denuncia-
tions, but to approach the other party and see
if business can be. done. Other States—Rumania
and Hungary, tomame one combination only—
might do well t(T ponder it. —London “Times:”

AFTER NUREMBERG.
Its members —British, American, French,
Russian —taking turns to read out the
monumental finding, the International
Military Tribunal at Nuremberg at last
made an end, on October 1, of the most
spectacular, perhaps the most momentous,
trial in history. All that was left was the
hanging of those surviving leading figures
of the Third Reich who were sentenced
to death—Goring, Ribbentrop, Keitel,
Kaltenbrunner, Frank, Rosenberg, Frick,
Streicher, Sauckel, Jodi, Seyss-Inquart
and, when they catch him, Bormann —
and the serving of their prison terms by
Hess, Doenitz, Raeder, Neurath, Schirach,
Speer and Funk, unless such change as
may be releases them.
Of the indicted 22 (Bormann in-
cluded) the only ones to go unscathed
were Schacht (banker), Papen (poli-
tician) and Fritsche (political propagan-
dist). One witness testified that he had
seen Bormann caught in an explosion
which must have killed him, but the
Tribunal no doubt had good reason for
persisting in its belief that Hitler’s close
associate was still alive. Hitler himself
(actually on no better evidence) and
Goebbels the Tribunal presumed to be
dead, and Himmler—a criminal if ever
one walked —was known to be dead.
Those untried ones have no present
bearing on the great trial but may have
for history. The Tribunal having
measured out proportional punishments,
history will probably ask what would
have been the lot of some of the accused
if the admitted arch-criminals had also
been before it. If hanging was the worst
that could be done to Hitler, Goebbels
and Himmler, how would some of the
lesser criminals then have fared?
Until the complete finding can be read
the seeming anomalies cannot safely be
questioned. As well as the accused in-
dividuals, various German organisations
were named in the indictment, but of
these the German High Command and
General Staff were excluded by the
Tribunal from the charge of criminality.
Despite that, the military leaders Keitel
and Jodi were sentenced to death, though
the naval leader Raeder was not, nor
was Raeder’s successor Doenitz. Even
more extraordinary, the politician Neu-
rath, found guilty on all counts, escaped
the extreme penalty.
The trial has been badly reported
in cables, but, subject to correction
in the light of the Tribunal’s con-
siderations, it would seem that soldiers
in the next war might as well die on the
battlefield as be strung up afterwards.
The hanging of Keitel, in particular,
reads like a return to the early Roman
humanities, except only that he may not
be dragged through Nuremberg behind
a chariot. Perhaps the complete finding
of the Tribunal will show some better
justification than has appeared in the
necessarily skimpy reports, but death for
the soldiers and prison for the admirals
smells of Russian influence. It was not
predominant in other cases; the Soviet
Judge, a major-general, was for hanging
Hess on the ground that Hess was “an
informed and willing participant” in
aggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia
and Poland —yes, Poland.
The Tribunal was occupied for more
than 10 months on its unprecedented
mass trial; since November 20, 1945.
Even that was not the actual beginning.
In Berlin a few days more than a month
earlier the accused had been formally
indicted. Before that again, on August
8, 1945 —the Black Day for Germany in
1918 and the old A.I.F. helped to make
it so —the Charter under which the Tri-
bunal was to operate, drawn up by the
leading four of the near-victorious
Allied Nations, had been published. A
commission was already at work amass-
ing evidence and shaping the case
for the prosecution. A still more im-
portant date historically was October 8,
1942, when President Roosevelt, in
America, and Sir John Simon, in Britain,
declared that “individuals proved to
be responsible” for war crimes, “either as
ringleaders or actual perpetrators,” would
be brought to trial; one of the main con-
siderations in the insistence on uncon-
ditional surrender.
In time the whole proceedings will
themselves be up for trial, before the
Bar of History. The verdict then will
depend, above all, on whether or not
the effect in the two main purposes —
deterring the launching of war, or mon-
strous inhumanity in war—is lasting.
Only if one or the other of those pur-
poses is served will history be able to
find the proceedings as justified as they
seem now, though even if the end is
failure the eventual finding surely must
be that the road to hell was never paved
with better intentions. The attempt, at
least, will be honored as something both
high-minded and inevitable.
In the historical—distinct from the
mock-moral contemporary—view, it may
be held that in some aspects Nuremberg
was more a continuation of the war the
trial reviewed than a new chapter in the
advance of humanity. The contemporary
newspaper screaming for the blood of the
miserable condemned, the exultation at
the spilling of it, may be written down
as nothing other than a carry-over of
war’s own ingeminated bloodlust.
That nothing could be too bad for men
found responsible for the unutterable
horrors that victory uncovered in Ger-
many may be beyond question, but a
better justification in the historical view
will probably be that, whatever considera-
tion might be their possible due as
criminal human beings, the accused had
the benefit of fair trial; hence the
protracted proceedings. On the fairness
of the trial history can have no doubt.
The prosecution was based practically
entirely on captured German documents,
the vital ones bearing the signatures of
one or another of the accused. The
Tribunal was presided over by a British
Lord Justice, than which there could be
no further remove from partisanship.
That was demonstrated in the first week
of the trial, when Lord Justice Sir
Geoffrey Lawrence, in ruling out a sen-
sational speech alleged to have been made
by Hitler, with Goring getting up on a
table and dancing agreement with it, sar-
castically cut to shreds the American
prosecution’s mishandling of documents.
That established a standard meticul-
ously followed. Thereafter the trial,
allowing for usual prosecuting forensics,
proceeded, as one of the very few un-
biassed observers reported, “without any
trace of bitterness or vindictiveness.” As
well, the defence was not restricted by
any canons of relevant evidence; a de-
parture which served the dual purpose of
giving the accused the opportunity—
which some took —of trying to justify to
their beaten people Hitler, themselves
and the war, and of putting on record
documents irrelevant to the trial but most
important as history.
There —in history—the accused and
condemned and the whole trial will be-
come one of the most vivid, perhaps one
of the most significant, acts in the end-
less drama of human progress. For,
whatever effect it may have in the in-
tended purposes, the Nuremberg trial
does represent some advance for
humanity. Woe to the vanquished is a
cry as old as the world, but this has beefi
at least an attempt at something different.
Based on justice, it has been an attempt
to establish justification of international
law. It is justified also by the fearful
thing that war has become. America’s
Harvard University has figured out that
902 major wars occurred between 500 b.c.
and a.d. 1918; that, counting the cost,
the number of countries involved, the
number of combatants and the casualties,
what is called World War I was seven
times as large as the other 901 combined ;
and that, on the same basis, World War
II was about four times as large as
World War I, Add all the horrors ex-
posed at the Nuremberg proceedings ; add
the bloodlust perpetuated in the horror
press, the horror radio and newsreels;
add what civilisation must be in for if the
atomic bomb and far worse things in the
hatching get loose. It is certainly time
something was done if humanity, or at
any rate civilisation, is to survive.
So, if its effects are lasting, the Nurem-
berg trial should figure in history as one
of the greatest events in humanity’s
chequered progress. The place itself,
Nuremberg, will stand as a terrific sym-
bol. Probably it was chosen for the trial
in imitation of Hitler’s theatrical use of
the railway carriage in which the other
German-made war, and his own service
as a corpdral, ended. History will glance
at that. It will note the irony of
Nuremberg’s having been the scene of
Nazi rallies; it will note that the Hohen-
zollems were a Nuremberg family. From
beyond that again, from the distant past,
history will recall the gruesome piece of
mechanism that used to be shown to
visitors —the Iron Maiden in the Rath-
haus; “After a night spent in her presence,
the doomed man was compelled to touch
the cold lips of the Iron Maiden with his
own; the figure opened, revealing a
number of long spikes, into which the
prisoner was forced; the folding doors
then closed, and when life was extinct
the body was dropped through a trap-
door into a pit beneath.” If that does
not satisfy the bloodlust, Nuremberg has
another:—
a yet more horrible Jungfrau
set up against a wall of the town. She was
seven feet high and her long arms bristled
with knives, which, when her attendant
executioner touched her foot with his own,
closed upon her prey, cutting the body into
a thousand pieces.
That should amply serve the mood
of today.
History may find other things to note
regarding Nuremberg. One, that it was
the home of as great an artist as the
world has known, Albrecht Differ; and,
let it be hoped significantly, that the city
in which what may be the most moment-
ous of all trials in history was held
evolved from a solitary watch tower on
a hill. It may have been tomorrow’s
beacon light, or at any rate a warning
that the most important thing in the next
war is not to lose.
Touch and Go.
Since the first Commonwealth Parlia-
ment was chosen there has been nothing
sillier in the way of election reporting
than the stuff served up to Sydney
people on the night of September 28, and
on ensuing days. It is a question whether
radio or newspaper reports were the
sillier. In each case “Labor” bias stuck
out a mile.
When only a fraction of the votes had
been counted these radio and newspaper
oracles awarded the victory to “Labor,”
giving it 48 seats in the House—one
fatuous organ presented it with an in-
creased majority. The return of ail
the “Labor” Ministers was proclaimed,
and the doom was pronounced of
Dame Enid Lyons (Darwin), A.
G. Cameron (Barker), Allan Mc-
Donald (Corangamite) and C. F. Ader-
mann (Maranoa). Actually these Opposi-
tion members are going back with greatly
increased majorities. This is true of
nearly all the other Opposition members
except the one casualty, J. A. Guy (Wil-
mot). The experience of Mr, Menzies
in Kooyong was typical. In 1943 he
failed of a majority On the first count
and had to go to a third, which gave him
a lead of 315, the number of effective
votes being 78,241. This time he had an
absolute majority of 17,000 over two
opponents, one a Communist who lost
his deposit. On the other hand the vote
of each of the 49 “Labor” members
elected in 1943 slumped, in some cases
disastrously.
Even while “Labor” radio and writing
boys were mistaking hopes for facts,
three “Labor” Ministers were a prey to
desperate anxiety. Mr. Forde, the Army
Minister, whose 1943 majority in Capri-
cornia was 6799, saw it being transferred,
by boxes from almost every polling place
away from the towns, into a tragic
minority. Mr. Frost, the Repatriation
Minister, who, when the last of 29,199
votes had been counted in Franklin
three years ago, found himself 5191 to
the good, was having a neck-and-neck
struggle with a dashing young airman,
C. W, J. Falkinder. Mr. Scully, Com-
merce and Agriculture, going to the
ballot box with agreeable thoughts of
1943, when he had an absolute majority
of 9072 in an effective poll of 47,736,
went to bed wondering how he would
fare when preferences were distributed.
At the same time, Mr. Smith (Wake-
field) knew that he was a gone coon, and
apprehension was the portion of Com-
rades Haylen (Parkes), Morgan (Reid),
Bryson (Bourke), McLeod (Wannon),
Hadley (Lilley), Mountjoy (Swan) and
Lemmon (Forrest). Only less disturbed
were Comrades Fraser (Eden-Monaro),
Williams (Robertson), Fuller (Hume),
Conelan (Griffith) and Barnard (Bass).
As the week wore on, it seemed pos-
sible that counting of primaries and dis-
tribution of preferences would result in
a repetition of the 1940 position sardoni-
cally reversed. In 1940 there were 36
Lib.-C.P., 36 Labor and two Independent
Ms.H.R., and the Senate contest gave the
Menzies Government five States. On
Friday the Senate count pointed to a
“Labor” victory in five States (though
there was a chance for one of the
Liberals in Tasmania) and the party had
gained the Wilmot seat. But it was
still behind and struggling in 12 elec-
torates and only slightly ahead in three
others; and appearances were that it
might have to meet the new Parliament
with 37 pledged Ms.H.R., and thus be in
a minority of one on the floor of the
House when it conducted Mr. Rosevear
back to the Speaker’s chair; 36-35-2.
From this ignominious position prefer-
ences will probably save it.
Sydney newspapers and those of their
readers who are morons or mugs are
addicted to believing what they wish to
believe; and when it seemed to them
that the Opposition parties were losing
heavily the familiar barrage of jibes and
sneers was directed at Mr. Menzies. It
was set down in print, and the ungenerous
rubbish passed from lip to lip, that Mr.
Menzies had brought about his side s
defeat, and that it could never expect to
win while he remained leader. In point
of fact, in his policy speech and in his
strenuous campaign in the constituencies
—and there has been none more strenu-
ous in the history of Commonwealth
politics—Mr. Menzies put it all over his
opponents. He obliged the Prime Minister
to abandon his churlish refusal to cut
taxes; at the eleventh hour “Labor” was
reduced to advertising that it would “make
prompt and substantial tax-reductions.”
Indeed, wherever Mr. Menzies spoke
he improved the prospects of his own
men in doubtful electorates and weak-
ened those of Ministers and other mem-
bers of Caucus in electorates not previ-
ously regarded as doubtful. And his
trail through the six States is littered with
the lost deposits of Communists. To
Communist insults, threats and missiles
he stood up with stoical composure,
whereas Mr. Chifley, Dr. Evatt and even
Mr. Cal well and the rest of the Catholic
“Labor” members concealed themselves,
as it were, in hollow logs.
The country press was an asset to
Mr. Menzies and Mr. Fadden. Ignoring
the fact that Rockhampton had been
“Labor” for upwards of 30 years, the
Rockhampton “Bulletin” came out
fearlessly against Mr. Forde, and was
a main factor in his defeat. How ignoble,
by comparison, was the showing of the
Sydney daily and Sunday press! While
professing to support the Opposition, it
allowed writing boys whose “Labor”
sympathies were unconcealed to put it
forth that the Opposition couldn’t win.
One of their dodges, based on
the knowledge that Australians dislike
being on the losing side, was to assert
that bookmakers (all “Labor” nowa-
days) were offering lavish odds against it.
These writing boys were also permitted
to advance the claims of their “Labor”
pets, particularly Mr. Daly in Martin and
Mr. Fraser in Eden-Monaro. The lead-
ing opponent of Mr. Fraser was Denzil
Macarthur-Onslow, an able young Aus-
tralian with a fine record in peace and
war. His record and his rank were
ignored, and all the daily and Sunday
papers conspired to boom Mr. Fraser,
who is just a newspaperman with a
copious issue of the current cant. In the
result Denzil Macarthur-Onslow will
probably be defeated, whereas a “build-
up” in the style reserved for bookmakers
and other “sports” who remained on the
home front during the war and became
wealthy by dubious means would have
ensured his election.
In other days, when the Sydney press
had real political influence, such as the
Melbourne “Age” still exercises, generally
in the interest of Labor, electorates like
Parkes, Martin and Robertson could not
have gone to Mr. Chifley’s party. They
never did go to “Labor” in the time of
Heney, Courtney and Dr. Ward. With a
morsel of the courage shown by the
editor of the Rockhampton “Bulletin"
and the editors of other country
papers, these electorates, and Watson,
too, could have been wrested from their
“Labor” members ; and in that case Mr.
Menzies would now be forming a Gov-
ernment.
One point of the Liberal policy did
cost Mr. Menzies votes, though it is no-
thing to his discredit or that of his party.
He came out for universal training. Mr.
Chifley did not join issue, but blithely
asserted that the next war would be
fought by “a few scientists.” The anti-
conscription wing of his party, equally
mindful of votes and with a record of
having opposed not only conscription for
the defence of the northern islands, but
conscription for the rescue of the sur-
vivors of the Seventh Division taken in
Java and the Eighth Division lost in
Singapore, flatly opposed the Menzies
proposal, and obviously it got the votes
it was after.
In war and peace alike, opposition to
any form of conscription is a vote-
winner. It was so in 1916 and 1917,
and again in 1943, when many
parents, while willing to kill Hitler
and Hirohito with their mouths, re-
coiled from the prospect of condemning
Willie and Alfie to assist in the consum-
mation ; and, with a Russian war talked
of, their objections revived. These people
are not peculiar to Australia. They exist in
every country, and Lincoln had a peck of
trouble with them during the Civil War.
“Labor” will go back to Canberra still
a Government in name, but with gaps in
the Cabinet and on the benches in the
House and with, recollections that should
chasten it. Its improved position in the
Senate matters nothing, since it was
already in control. If it has the real in-
terests of the country at heart, it will place
defence above party and rout the Com-
munists in the industrial field, as Mr.
Menzies has routed them in the political
field. It has, for the second time, beep
denied the Constitutional powers it
sought, except in respect of the social-
security question, which, after all, was
only eyewash. In the time remaining to
it it can be useful to Australia if it sub-
ordinates the party to the nation; but
this can scarcely be expected. _

"the World Recedes."
In May a twin-engined U.S, Navy
bomber, a Lockheed Neptune, made
trial trip from the Atlantic coast to the
Pacific Slope, Brooklyn to Burbank, in
9 hours 28 minutes. Last week, with a
crew of four and a load of 85,0001 b., it
was flown non-stop from Perth (W.A.)
to Columbus (Ohio), via Northam, Alice
Springs, Cooktown (9 hours 45 minutes),
Milne Bay, Bikini and Midway, 11,237
miles, in 55 hours 18 minutes. The
planned destination was Seattle, but
headwinds and dense cloud with icing
prompted the diversion.
When Commander Davies and his
three companions descended at Colum-
bus Mr. Forrestal, Secretary for the
Navy, was waiting with a D.F.C.
for each of them. While their Nep-
tune was making the Pacific passage
he took occasion to announce that
his country had sent a strong fleet
to the Mediterranean, which, of
course, washes the coasts of Moscow-
threatened countries, “to back up our
occupation forces, protect American in-
terests and support American policy in
that strategic area,” and that the strong
fleet would remain there. Previously the
U.S. Navy had drawn pointed attention
to its plan for mooring “more than 300
fleet reserve merchant ships in Cathlamet
Bay, Oregon.” Not to be behindhand,
the' U.S. Army Air Force pointed out
that “by flying across the Arctic Circle
it is only 4900 miles from Moscow to
Detroit”; and after the Neptune’s
achievement a U.S. Army Superfortress,
carrying 10 men and a total weight of
65£ tons, travelled 9500 miles non-stop
from Hawaii to Egypt, by way of Alaska,
the North Pole, Greenland, Britain,
France, Switzerland, Italy and, of course,
the Mediterranean, in a little under 40
hours.
The significance of all this can scarcely
be lost on. Comrade Stalin, unless Com-
rade Stalin is one of those bluffers who
are incapable of realising that their bluff
has been called.
The Popularity Stakes.
An impartial observer reading the Syd-
ney daily papers on the two days imme-
diately following the Federal election,
and listening to the moans of a few
disgruntled Liberals, could scarcely be
blamed if he went away with the impres-
sion that the aforesaid papers and the
moaners had hoped to win the election
purely on the popularity or glamor or
oomph or something of Mr. Menzies.
“It is clear,” shouted the “Sun,” “that
the Australian people will not accept Mr.
Menzies as a national leader.” “At any
rate,” spluttered “S. M. Herald,” “Mr.
Menzies proved unable to overcome the
handicaps of a personal unpopularity.”
And the moaners lapped it up. A shake
of the head, a pursing of the lips and
sort of snarl, “Aw, we’ll never do any
good while we got that Menzies,” was
their contribution ; dutiful little echoes of
the little minds that wrote the press
rubbish. These very papers and these
very moaners couldn’t praise the very
same Menzies enough before the elec-
tion. His policy speech and his sub-
sequent speeches, his courage in the face
of a Communist larrikin mob in East
Sydney, his capable handling of inter-
jectors were reported and praised, and
the moaners-to-be, as anxious as Sydney
dailies to be on what they thought was
the winning side, went round talking
about “Good old Bob.”
About the only conclusion any im-
partial observer could reach is that, if
the Liberal party wants to come up for
the next elections with a leader who will
be popular in the eyes of the Sydney
dailies and the moaners, it had better
make a choice between Mr. Jack Davey,
the winner of the next Beach Girl con-
test, Vic Patrick and Bernborough. Even
then, Bernborough should be warned
not to lose a race in the meantime.

Before and during the election cam-
paign the cry was heard from both sides
that there should be more members at
Canberra, and it has increased in volume
since. The mildest concrete proposal is
that the number of Senators should be
increased from 36 to 48, and the number
of Representatives from 74 (the voteless
N.T. man excluded) to 100.
Section 7 of the Constitution says “no
original State shall have less than six
Senators,” or be deprived of equal repre-
sentation with the other original States.
Section 24 says the number of
members of the House “shall be, as
nearly as practicable, twice the number
of the Senators.” Increasing the number
of Tasmanian Ms.H.R. would be
rather ridiculous considering that Tas-
mania has only one-twelfth the popula-
tion of N. S. Wales. It would be equally
ridiculous to deny Senators of their own
to communities like New England and
the Riverina, each of which has a greater
population than Tasmania, when that
small State would have eight. Different
thoughts as to increased Senators for
Tasmania would arise if New England
and the Riverina were separated from
the unwieldy State which, if present
trends continue, will before long have
three-sevenths of the population of the
Commonwealth.
Unfortunately the Constitution imposes
barriers to this very natural and desirable
development. It is provided in section
124 that “a new State may be formed
by separation of territory from a State,
but only with the consent of the Parlia-
ment thereof,” and that “a new State
nfey be formed by the union of two or
more States or parts of States, but only
with the consent of the Parliaments of
the States affected.” The “buts” con-
stitute apparently insuperable obstacles
SOS CASE.
“In 1943 Minister Scully’s wheat-and-sheep electorate of Gwydir (N.S.W.) gave him
an absolute majority of 9072 in an effective poll of 47,336. On Monday, with 42,624
primaries counted, he was 1120 behind; and the preferences were in small parcels.”
until they are removed by Constitutional
amendment.
It is not so in the U.S.A., where the
admission of new States is an easy and
continuous process. Before long the
territory of Alaska will be admitted as a
State, though the population is only
80.000, and that of New York nearly
14.000.
There is a case for increase of Federal
members, but it should be connected with
and conditional upon the creation of new
States: two at least in what is now N. S.
Wales, and one at least in what is now
Queensland. Under existing conditions
an increase would merely bloat the
already exorbitant power of N. S. Wales,
of the cities and of the “Labor” Caucus,
which, as the election returns show,
draws most of its support from the sea-
board,
Australia already has 609 members, of
whom 80 are Ministers; nearly as many
members as, and more Ministers than,
Britain, with its 48 million people. Cer-
tainly Canada has 866 members, but 96
are nominee Senators. In Ontario, with
nearly 4,000,000 people, there are only
90 provincial members, whereas in Wes-
tralia with 490,000 people there are 80
(nine of them Ministers), all paid on a
more lavish scale.
It is alleged that no Commonwealth
party with 40 or so members in the House
can furnish 19 good Ministers, and this is
painfully true. But in existing circum-
stances why should there be 19 Minis-
ters? The increase to 19 was a question-
able war-time expedient, and during the
war and since some of the 19 have been
abroad most of the time.
Short Memories.
In its treatment of the Nuremberg trials
the yellow press is showing itself at its
worst. As usual following the lead of
Moscow in demanding more executions,
it is immune to the grimly comic side of
the Russian demands.
As the shouts for Hess’s execution, on
the ground of his complicity in the
atrocities committed in Poland, ring
round the world not an editor seems to
have risen to recall that at that very
time Moscow was assuring the world that
they were not atrocities. In fact, Hess
was a Russian ally right up to the
moment he escaped from Germany—on
May 10, 1941.
Nor has any editor remembered that
Molotov said the British blockade would
be broken with Russia’s help because it
was starving German women and
children after the rapes of Poland, Bel-
gium, Holland, Denmark, Norway and
France, the bombing of British civilians
and the drowning indiscriminately of
women and children at sea. No one has
revived the painful fact that at Christ-
mas, 1939, after the Germans had com-
mitted their bloody arson in Poland,
Stalin cabled New Year greetings to
Ribbentrop, assuring him that the friend-
ship of Soviet Russia with the German
people had become “cemented in blood.”
Also left in oblivion is the remembrance
that in November, 1939, Stalin declared
Britain and France to be imperialist
aggressors, and offered all “proletarians”
a “firm base” in Moscow from which to
work if they cared to turn “imperialist”
war into civil war.
And there has not been one appropri-
ate recollection of the fact that die Rus-
sians who are now clamoring for more
German blood conducted, through their
Communist party, a propaganda which,
during the dreadful bombing of Lon-
don’s East End, told the suffering British
people that they were being mangled
only because their capitalist and im-
perialist Government would not save
them by a “negotiated” peace. A
“negotiated” peace with Russia’s ally and
spoilsharer of Berlin, there being then,
in Moscow parlance, “nothing to fight
for.”
The plain truth behind all the outcry
is that it arises not so much because the
German wretches are murderers. The
generators and makers of most of the
noise would have allowed them to go on
being murderers and torturers to the
end- of their days without protest had
they confined their operations to Britons,
French and Scandinavians. What then-
ferocious denouncers hold against them
is that they went too far; started killing
Russians.
"Black" Wool.
It was here remarked (B. 11/9/’46) that
“every boss of every union connected
with the pastoral industry” would seize
upon the high prices for wool at the Syd-
ney auctions as an excuse to demand
higher pay, shorter hours and anything
else he could think of. There is no
satisfaction in reporting that it began
much sooner than expected. The Com-
munist-led Clerks’ Union opened the
ball with the usual cheeky Communist
demand: that all clerks employed by
Dalgetys at Sydney should be forced to
join the Commo outfit, that the company
should undertake not to encourage the
forming of any other clerks’ union and
that company and Commo-led union
should at once confer on a new award.
Presently the Commo-led union de-
clared Dalgetys’ wool “black.” Thereby
it stopped loading on three wool ships
- at a time when the trade is desperately
anxious to clear every bale possible to
make way for incoming clips and new
purchases by export buyers. Dalgetys
rejected the Communist attempt at dic-
tatorship and reminded the clerks that
an application for an award was before
the Arbitration Court. There the posi-
tion stood at the week-end, when the
Sydney wharves were idle (“No Satur-
day work”!) and Victoria was about to
have a complete railway and tramway
stoppage.
Meantime, reports on the close of the
first London wool sales since the war
showed such premium values ruling at
the opening that Yorkshire had to sit
quiet while Continental buyers made it a
welter. English purchasers came well
into the market towards the close, when
values settled down, and probably got a
larger proportion of the final week’s
offerings than anyone else. The wool,
of course, is coming out of the war-
time surplus, and Australian lots with
any claim to quality sold well above
J.O.’s reserve. Not more than 1 p.c. of
the offering had to be taken up by J.O.
The good prices held, although Ameri-
cans were out of the market, a ruling
of their Office of Price Adminis-
tration practically stopping them from
buying Dominion wools at current values.
This may not last, since there are hints
that American buyers are in rebellion
against the limit put on their activities.
Thus, with high prices for its chief
product ruling at home and abroad, with
an urgent necessity to ship wool out of
the country as rapidly as possible, and
with a grand chance to re-establish some
part of its national economy, Australia
finds Communists once more obstruct-
ing its road back to post-war normalcy.
At the election Communist candidates
fared worse than ever before —they all,
with one exception, lost their deposits,
and the exception’s primaries were re-
duced by two-thirds. Given a second
chance to protect the nation against
strikes, threats and “black” bans, Mr.
Chifley will doubtless go on smoking the
pipe that made so sudden a disappear-
ance from his election advertisements.
£29,000,000 for "Works."
For what is possibly the first time in
history, an Australian Premier with
£29,000,000 to spend on “works” in a
year has admitted that he may not be
able to get rid of it, snags being lack
of manpower and material. Ip other
respects Sydney’s Mr. McKell, the
Premier concerned, runs true to form,
for he intends to spend by far the most of
the cash on city “works.” Of course the
Commonwealth polls have revealed that
“Labor” is, in the main, a city party.
The McKell decision was very sketchily
reported in the daily newspapers, but of
the listed items the country gets these:
Soldier-settlement, £3,500,000; water
conservation, £1,700,000; forestry,
£500,000 ; soil conservation, £120,000 ;
agricultural education, £150,000; roads
and bridges (mainly country), £575,000;
total, £6,545,000. The balance of the
£29,000,000 is to be spent on suburban
railways, suburban housing, Sydney
Harbor, Government tourist establish-
ments, hospitals and the like. There was
a vague mention of improvements to
Coff’s Harbor. Nothing was said of the
grand McKell plan, heard of frequently .
in the immediate past, of fine new city
buildings for Government departments.
Presumably the details have been reserved
for publication when “Labor” goes
to the country, as it will have to do early
next year.
This “Labor” programme is for a year
in a State which has suffered two disas-
trous droughts, with heavy losses of crops
and stock (12,600,000 sheep alone), in
three years, whose surface and under-
ground water supplies are diminishing,
whose soil is failing at an alarming rate,
whose forests are approaching extinction
and whose country dwellers are making
for the city in a steady stream. There
is evidence enough to scare the daylight
out of anyone with vision as to what is
happening in rural N. S. Wales. But you
can’t scare these “Labor” politicians,
whose minds are so busy with lotteries
and horse- and dog-racing and other de-
vices for making the community (in the
words of the old “Labor” objective) “en-
lightened” and “self-reliant.”

CARRERAS LTD.—OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
w
POLITICAL Points
Five years ago last Monday Forde was
sworn in as Army Minister. The P.M.
with the shortest period (July 6
to July 13, 1945), he is the second man
who has held the office to lose his seat.
He came in for Capricornia on Decem-
ber 16, 1922, when Hughes entered upon
his representation of North Sydney. Billy
is still there ; Franky has become one
with Nineveh and Tyre.
Dedman is first favorite for the suc-
cession to Forde as Deputy P.M., and
that should mean to Chifley when
Chifley steps down. Deddy’s “most im-
portant disqualification,” according to a
Melbourne “commentator,” is a “some-
what dour personality.” That was no
disqualification in the case of Fisher,
three times P.M., or, as to Queensland,
in that of Forgan Smith —though Forgan
could always unbend a bit. But on the
score of intellect and service to the party
Dr, Evatt has vastly superior claims, and
it will be a rotten thing if he is rejected
on flimsy geographical grounds. The
early party leaders had no deputies, but
No. 1 and No. 2 (Hughes) in the first
Labor Administration, Watson’s, were
both from N. S. Wales, and No. 1 and
No. 2 (Isaacs) in Deakin’s third Adminis-
tration were both from Victoria. More-
over, when Bruce fell in 1929 Latham
and Gullett, leader and deputy leader
respectively, were also Victorians.
Dr. Evatt’s second v and third referen-
dum proposals faileci through adverse
votes in Queensland, S.A. and Tasmania,
although Yes majorities in N.S.W., Vic-
toria and W.A. outweighed No majorities
in the other States. He is doubtless
moodily reflecting on the fact that one-
fifth of the votes were informal. Still,
as a champion of the Small Nations he
can scarcely complain at this triumph of
the Small States —but when in Paris or
Washington he will choose to forget it.
After the election the strikes! No
Saturday work on the Sydney wharves ;
a clerks’ “black” ban on the loading of
wool consigned to Dalgetys; no Vic-
torian trains or Melbourne city trams
on Monday, and prospects of “a general
upheaval,” hailed by a Mr. Flanagan, of
the Ironworkers’ Federation, witlh an
offer to bet that “60,000 or 70,000 Vic-
torians” would be out of work this week.
All the unions concerned are, of course,
Communist-led, and they fear nothing
from the “Labor” Governments con-
cerned, Mr. Chifley, for his part, having
returned to smoking his election-banned
pipe.
Sitting as arbitrator, Judge Book, of
Melbourne, decided that the 77 acres of
the Ascot racecourse, owned by John
Wren, the executors of- Benjamin Nathan
and others, should go to the Housing
Commission for £142,648. The Housing
Commission’s valuation was £117,000;
that of the owners £174,000. At £142,648
the price of each dwelling site in Ascot
will go up from £255 to £287. The Com-
mission proposes to erect 400 flats, 100
villa-pairs and 50 individual villas and
shops to house 2500 people. Ex-service-
men who have been deprived of building
blocks by official valuation are regretting
that they couldn’t have gone in for pony-
racing and trotting.
In a wild whoop of enthusiasm when
the election counting had barely com-
menced, Misinformation Minister Calwell
crowed that “Labor” would be in office
for another 10 years and would win the
1949 election “more sweepingly” than
“we have done this one.” A week later,
when Army Minister Forde was among
the sweepings and Frost and Scully
looked like joining him, N.S.W. Premier
McKelly raised Calwell’s bid, with a
prophecy that the party would govern
for 50 years. These amateur beermug-
readers should watch their step. In 1940
Hitler promised that his empire would
endure for a thousand years. He was
just 995 years out.
Queer things happened on the night of
September 28, among them the misdirec-
tion of a ballot box in a Sydney con-
stituency and an unusual increase in the
number of postal votes in South Aus-
tralia. And there was so great a dis-
parity between House and Senate figures
in Victoria that Old Digger Brand was
moved to thoughts of asking for a re-
count. Senate figures should be a pretty
exact reflection of House figures, but
they never are. It is as easy as winking
to cast postal and absent votes and the
whole business needs critical examination.
The People’s Printing and Publishing
Society, Limited, first directors Sharkey,
Miles, Wright, Chandler and other Com-
rades of—er—credit and renown, is
calling for capital from the faithful.
Twenty thousand shares are offered for
public subscription ; they may be “non-
dividend-paying or p.c. dividend-pay-
ing, according to ' the desires of sub-
scribers” ; and “it is confidently antici-
pated that the great majority of intend-
ing members will take up non-dividend-
paying shares.” Come on, suckers!
One distinguished ghost must have
pulled a long face at the' Nurem-
berg trials a wraith by the name
of Wellington, who, when Bliicher
proposed to. kill Napoleon, remarked:
“You and I have played too dis-
tinguished a part to become execu-
tioners. Let the monarchs do it, if they
wish it done.” But Wellington’s policy,
of course, was old-fashioned. It merely
brought to Western Europe its longest
peace on record and made a lasting friend
of France, for centuries regarded by
Englishmen with the same disfavor as
Germany today.
“S. M. Herald” had it that “A. M.
Blain (N.T. Independent) seems certain to
be defeated.... Mr. Blain is a Govern-
ment supporter.” From the first count
in Alice Springs and Darwin the
game p.-0.-w. was in a strong posi-
tion, since he was expected to
gain 70 per cent. of Murray’s
(Official Labor) preferences and his
nearest opponent, Wallman, needed nearly
all of them to win. As for his being a
Government supporter —the whole Cau-
cus would go down with shock if the
forthright Digger said one good word for
Labor. His castigations of the Govern-
ment over the D’Alton appointment to
Wellington (N.Z.), its preference to
Vesteys and its socialist replanning of
Darwin made even Ward writhe in his
seat. #
Victorian Judge Stretton, whose report
on bushfire prevention gave the Dunstan
Government a headache, has come. out
with another indictment, equally grave
and outspoken, and as vividly phrased.
Grazing in mountainous forest lands, his
Honor finds, accelerates soil erosion,
affects water-catchment efficiency - and is
a recurrent cause of bushfires ; and ex-
isting measures of regulation are ineffec-
tive. The Kosciusko area has been
severely over-grazed ; the Hume Weir is
endangered and, since 1939, forest fires
have been deliberately and unlawfully lit
to serve the interests of the incendiarist,
usually a grazier who wants quick grass
for his cattle before he moves on to fresh
pastures. In Gippsland there is scarcely
a major river which is not suffering the
effects of man-made erosion; and the
Orbost district, the most fertile of all,
has “the infamous distinction of a total of
169 fires.” “The*State,” the Judge adds,
“could well afford to pay a staggering re-
ward in purchase of a means which would
rid us of this prime pest.” He recom-
mends that grazing should be directed by
the Forests Commission, subject to direc-
tions from a land utilisation authority.
In 40 years of Commonwealth referen-
dums Westralia has been on the No side
only three times —1911 (Legislative
Powers and Monopolies), 1926 (In-
dustry and Commerce and Essential Ser-
vices) and 1937 (Aviation and Marketing).
The Ayes had it, in nearly every case by
very large majorities, in 1910 (Finance
and State Debts), 1913 (Trade and Com-
merce, Corporations, Industrial Matters,
Railway Disputes, Trusts and Nationalisa-
tion of Monopolies), 1919 (Legislative
Powers and Monopolies), 1928 (State
Debts), 1944 (Post-war Constitutional and
Democratic Rights, alias Dr. Evatt’s
Fourteen Points) and in 1946 (Social
Services, Organised Marketing and In-
dustrial Employment). In between, in 1916
and 1917, the West polled majorities of
94,069 to 40,884 and 84,116 to 46,522 for
recruitment of the A.I.F. by conscription,
which would have required Constitutional
amendments, A unique record.
A Tasmanian, Alfred Charles Seabrook,
was the first to change his name by deed
poll in the hope of securing a political
advantage, a quaint stunt peculiar to this
country. As Seabrook he was Franklin's
M.H.R. for seven years, 1922-1929,
whereupon disaster fell on him. Altering
the S to a C, he came out for the Senate
in 1934 —and just saved his deposit.
A Mr. Sheehy, “Labor’s” Dairy-Pro-
duce Controller, is back from Britain
with the report that the food position
there is “still unsatisfactory—certainly
more so, in my experience, than in
France, Denmark and Switzerland.” As
evidence of good faith Mr. Sheehy men-
tions that his weight is down 151 b. It is a
wonder Mr. Murphy, the Food Con-
troller, and Mr. Dedman, the Minister,
didn’t wait for Mr. Sheehy’s report be-
fore coming out against the Food-for-
Britain Appeals. Their surly opposition
didn’t prevent Mr. Dedman being returned
for Corio or the other Mr. Sheehy getting
in again for Boothby (S.A.). Supporters of
the Food-for-Britain Appeals, while hav-
ing Archbishop Mannix as a champion,
are obviously a minority, but a most
worthy minority.
The one thing wanting at the Nurem-
berg trial was the appearance among the
men charged of those who signed up with
Hitler (dead) and Ribbentrop (to swing)
in August, 1939, and thus let slip the dogs
of war. The same men gave the signal for
the invasion of Finland and eastern
Poland in spite of all their engagements
under the League of Nations, of which
their country, Poland and Finland were
all members. They rounded off their con-
tribution to the frightful ironies of history
by instructing the major-general they sent
to Nuremberg as a Judge of their erst-
while partners to declare that Hess should
hang because, for one thing, he was a
party to the war of aggression on Poland.
Brooding on the 1934 Commonwealth
elections, at which the other side won all
the contested Senate seats, Lang and
Graves, then the Big Fellow’s instrument
in controlling the Sydney A.L.P. execu-
tive, drew up a plan for 1937, based on
the fact that there had been 193,612 in-
formal votes —193,612, and only 1,273,700
electors voting. The plan was to run a
ticket of A-candidates —Amour, Ashley,
Armstrong and Arthur. There were no
doubt scores of Labor men better quali-
fied, except alphabetically, but the
planners shrewdly judged that scores of
thousands of ignorant or careless people
would again vote down the ballot paper.
They did, and the A-ticket, being placed
first, prevailed. Amour, Armstrong and
Ashley are still in, with Arnold to keep
them company. Arthur, scrapped in 1943,
stood as an Independent and lost his
deposit. In N. S. Wales at any rate, it
is better for an aspiring “Labor” Senator
to be born lucky—that is, an A man,
sweet with the party —than rich.
Since the A-Senator oracle was worked
groups of candidates have had to draw
lots for positions on the Senate ballot
paper, lone-hand candidates coming in
after the last lot grouped. In N. S. Wales
at least, it is a decided advantage to draw
first position, and every ungrouped can-
didate —there have been 17 at three elec-
tions —has lost his or her deposit. In
1943 a group of unknowns headed by one
Peter Pollack polled 101,245 of 1,278,2-5
effective No. 1 votes, and this time a so-
called Protestant People’s party will poll
a greater number, perhaps 120,000. Yet
every P.P.P. who stood for the House lost
his deposit.
Maoriland Labor is to have its general
election next month, and Scully will figure
in it. By blurting out that Scully had
agreed to let Maoriland have Australian
wheat at ss. 9d. a bushel for four
years, Minister Sullivan did Scully a
power of harm in Gwydir and brought a
spot of trouble on his own Government.
Maoriland wheatgrowers were soon heard
saying that if the ss. 9d. arrangement
hadn't been waved in their faces (the
price may be less than ss. 9d., Sullivan
now says, with Scully yet to be heard
from) they wouldn’t have consented to
take 7s. Id. a bushel for their own wheat;
and their state of mind is fierce. Their
vote is not as important as that of their
opposite numbers in Australia, but it is
numerous enough in some electorates to
embarrass a party which, on the evidence
of by-elections, has been losing ground.
When its thoughts don’t turn to Gov-
ernment lotteries, registered s.-p. shops
or night “trots,” Victorian “Labor” is a
whale for culture. Under the new cur-
riculum Government dominies have
been instructed to teach art to their
pupils. “How am Ito do it?” one teacher
said. “I believe in art, but I have no
knowledge of it. Does the department
want me to pretend to know something I
don’t know?” If he had been a politician
he wouldn’t have asked such a question.
From time to time Ward has been
heard to say that the forces in uniform
were mainly Labor-unionist; 90 per
cent, was his estimate in an expansive
moment. Strange that his electorate,
East Sydney, should have made such
a poor showing when votes of
members of the forces were counted
in 1943. In N.S.W. electorates sel-
dom or never “Labor” and with very
small proportions of resident unionists
they numbered 10 per cent, or more
7335 in Warringah (75,619 elec-
tors), 6885 in Richmond (56,946 electors),
5216 in Calare (52,268 electors), 5664 in
Riverina (50,394 electors), 5482 in Hume
(54,701 electors); but there were only
4928 in East Sydney (57,954 electors).
What detained so many of Ward’s con-
stituents?
The “Tribune,” Sydney’s Commo rag,
seeking solace for its poor showing at
the polls, gloated that the Australian
people had “steam-rollered the anti-
Labor parties” and had given Labor “even
more strength than it had gained in the
1943 sweep.” Arithmetic has never been
a strong point with Corns. The same
paper boasted that 3000 of its members
had manned the polling booths on Sept.
28. The total of votes polled by the
comrades in N.S.W. was below 21,000, an
average of seven per “worker,” including
his own vote.
Doidge, M.P., who was one of Beaver-
brook’s men in Britain before he returned
to Maoriland and entered politics, has
been asking pertinent questions about the
Moscow legation. He said it cost £26,000
in 1945, is costing £30,000 this year and is
to cost nearly £40,000 next year, and de-
clared that Maoriland had got nothing in
return for the expenditure, not even in-
formation of the Maloney order, though
one of the staff of 13 had returned.
Somewhat embarrassed, the P.M., Peter
Fraser, said something about setting up
a committee “to appraise the work of
the legation.” He was silent when another
Opposition member, Goosman, pointed
out that, in addition to running expenses,
£10,650 had been charged up to the tax-
payers for furniture and food for the
Moscow joint, the Workers’ Paradise be-
ing short of both requirements.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”: Funny how in these days oi
shortages the most prosaic things can
suddenly acquire a scarcity value. The
doormat has always been accounted one
of the humblest articles about the home,
so humble in fact that it has become a
term of contempt for the type of man
who allows himself to be pushed about
and trampled on without protest. Coir
mats are imported from India, and dur-
ing the war years imports shrank to
vanishing point. I was dimly aware of
this and had noticed that the mat which
my (youngsters forget to use when they
tramp into the house with muddy boots
was looking old and worn, *but yesterday
a placard in a chain-store window
brought it home to me. Drawing atten-
tion to a batch of doormats it proudly
proclaimed “Today’s Scoop, Just in!”
I went into the shop and found the mats
selling like hot cakes. In contrast with
the war-time shortage of the humble
bootwiper, Australia, thanks to queues.
Government forms and restrictions, has
never before had such an abundant crop
of human doormats.

“Bo”: He sat in the barber’s chair
next to me, and when the music on the
radio ceased and the announcer said “You
have just been listening to the march
‘Pomp and Circumstance,’ ” he expressed
some forceful views on plagiarism.
“That’s as brazen a thing as I’ve heard,”
he finished. “We’ve had a gramophone
record at home for donkey’s years—
‘Land of Hope and Glory,’ sung by
Clara Butt; it’s exactly the same as that,
note for note. Who did the pinching?”
I reflected then that a composer kicks
over no ethical traces by pinching from
himself. Edward Elgar composed a set
of six patriotic military marches for the
coronation of Edward VII. The first of
these, the one in D Major, struck im-
mediate popular favor. It is in two parts,
the second of much greater melodic con-
tent than the first. On hearing this
second part the King exclaimed “That
tune will go round the world!”—a
prophecy that was speedily fulfilled. Ten
years later Laurence Housman set the
second part of the march to words, the
song becoming “Land of Hope and
Glory”—an air that is second only to the
“National Anthem” as a tune of empire.

“Norther”: A Queensland divorce case
hit the headlines when it was alleged that
the respondent’s mother had written a
letter claiming that she had been
approached by a barrister who had said
that for £125 he could get a judge to
hear the case in secret. The trial judge
very properly hit the roof and promised
to get at the truth or otherwise of the
allegation. But what really made me
and a few mates sit up was the de-
scription of the petitioner; Basil
Laurence Mossman Schnitzerling, kan-
garoo-shooter.

“Clooter”; It gladdens my ancient soul
to see that modern youth isn’t quite
destitute of adventurousness and initia-
tive, and that the official mind can still
be dazzled by effrontery. The gladness
this time comes from an account of how
a 19-year-old lad from Melbourne, some-
how accoutred in a U.S. military uniform
with Australia war correspondent badges,
got accreditation from Aust. Army Public
Relations as a correspondent for some
English and Canadian aviation magazines
and for an Australian one which he
“planned to establish.” Thenceforth he
travelled the Orient by ’plane and war-
ship, went to England as a guest pas-
senger on Royal naval craft and re-
turned to Australia by air through the
good offices of R.A.F. Public Relations.
How far his odyssey may have run is
doubtful. It ended when Melbourne
police arrested him on a charge of carry-
ing an unregistered Japanese revolver.

“Findy”: It’s time somebody protested
against the tyranny of the telephone, so
here goes. Call unexpectedly on a busi-
nessman and you are kept cooling your
heels in the passage for anything up to
half an hour. If you have no appointment
his staff regard you with the greatest sus-
picion and are doubtful whether you
should be admitted to his presence at all.
Yet if you ’phone him you are probably
put through right away, interrupting a
personal caller whose business may be
much more important than your own.
Conversely, you have managed to pene-
trate the holy of holies and are fairly
launched on putting your case, when the
’phone rings. Immediately your listener
seizes it with a mumbled apology, the
bloke on the other end of the wire has
“ Don't worry , Mum —he ain't.one of us.”
his undivided attention for a few minutes
and you have to start all over again. This
may happen two or three times in the
course of your interview, and your lis-
tener takes it as a matter of course, yet
if the ’phone caller had come along in
person he would still be waiting im-
patiently outside. It’s all a part of the
subjection of man to the machine. Few
people seem able to ignore the peremp-
tory challenge of the ’phone bell. I’m
thinking of forming a society for the
ignoring of telephones. I’d give more
details, but.l have to stop now. My
’phone’s ringing.

“Mick o’Pick”: In a chemist’s window
at Carlton (N.S.W.) a well-known brand
of toothbrush hangs from a tripod, and
affixed by clips to the bristles is a short
length of rope, at the end of which are
suspended two house bricks. This was
effective enough to stop most passers-by,
but some local wit capped the display by
inserting a card on which was written
“Bricks by courtesy of the Housing Com-
mission.”

“Wongajong”; In the days when
Bulletin poets and artists foregathered
at Snudden’s “Star” Hotel, Kathleen,
Audrey or Gladys served the beer in
pewter tankards. There was something
about those tankards that made Snud-
den’s beer particularly pleasing to the
palate; it had a taste of its own, quite
different from that of the beer served in
a glass container. How many pubs these
days serve hops in a pewter mug?
“Don’t be silly, mister,” growled 1 one
publican to me when I made the request.
“I haven’t seen a pewter mug for
years and years. The last I had was
pinched the year Wotan won the Mel-
bourne Cup.” Inquiries at other beer
houses brought forth the same response—
pewter tankards are definitely a pleasure
of the past. One barmaid—she was very
young and dumb, I will admit—did pro-
duce a nickel-plated receptacle which she
insisted was genuine pewter. I have
never discovered the scientific reason for
the attraction of the pewter. Anyone
know?

“Conda”: Any naval lookout can ex-
plain “Philp’s” disappearing blue light
(B. 25/9/’46). In day-time or bright light
the centre of the eye, the fovea, is the
most sensitive part, and it registers the
image of an object viewed directly. At
night the fovea loses its sensitivity, be-
coming in dim light totally blind. The
image is then registered on the outer
edges of the retina. A ship dimly sil-
houetted on a far horizon disappears if
stared at directly, so lookouts are
trained to shift the eye right, left or 10
degrees above to bring the target into
view.

“Macnell”: The Navy had a picnic 36
miles out from Sydney’s North Head
when permission was given to engage a
1000-ton merchantman chock-a-block
with poison gas and ammunition, to be
sunk in 150 fathoms. Sniffing around
the target for an hour while the tug
labored on at six knots, the “enemy’s”
course, speed, inclination and range
were qfiecked and plotted by radar a
hundred times before scuttling charges
opened her to the sea. Frigate Conda-
mine got in first, and lobbed her opening
broadside 100 yards over at a range of
four miles. The next whacked her full
amidships, and in rapid salvos the four-
incher hit her repeatedly. Arunta came
up astern, but got off only three broad-
sides before the merchantman cocked her
bow skyward and slid quickly under.
Naval gunnery was proved as efficient as
at the height of the scrap a year over,
and the Sydney “Daily Telegraph” re-
porter aboard Arunta proved that the
__ standard of his sheet’s reporting similarly
~ had not altered. He made the target a
“9000-tonner,” and sank it in “1200
fathoms”; Arunta and her four-point
sevens hit it with “two shells of a six-
inch broadside,” and though at the time
of the destroyer’s last shot the target’s
stern was hanging at an angle of 70
degrees 100 feet below water, “another
six-inch shell ploughed into its stern.”
Condamine didn’t rate a mention.

“Weff”; He stopped me at the Quay
end of Pitt-street. “Excuse me a second,
brother,” he said with the practised ease
of the professional street cadger, “but
do you happen” “Hold on,” I
parried. “We’ve met before. You’re a
radio mechanic from Melbourne. You’re
out of work and broke. Your wife and
kids are starving down south. I met you
ten years ago in Barrack-street. You
caught me for two bob then. Still at the
old game, eh?” The knockback would
have bowled over the average pavement
biter, but not my friend. “Oh boy, oh
boy!” he flashed back, “What a
memory! I wish I had one like it. I’m
always geting into a ‘blue’ for bailing the
same bloke up twice. Tell me how you
do it.” Well, we all have our weak spots,
and one of mine is the pride I take in
being able to remember people. I found
myself in a pub with the cadger telling
him grand feats of memorising. It cost
five bob what with drinks and a handout
for my audience.

“Lao-dah”: If Australian manufac-
turers want their goods to become popu-
lar in China they will have to employ
competent translators for their trade-
names as well as designers for their
wrappers. It’s no use putting up a new
line in cosmetics for the ladies if you
wrap it up in a color that betokens
mourning or has other unfortunate
memories. The transliteration of trade-
names is an even more difficult proposi-
tion. Either characters which explain the
contents can be selected or characters
which have similar sounds to the words
as pronounced in English. But a
character with a similar sound may have
a meaning for a Chinese which is far
from complimentary to the product indi-
cated. When I asked my Chinese tutor
to Chinify my name he took a long time
about it. Finally he selected three
characters which more or less gave the
English sound and meant “Virtue-wis-
dom-rightness.” If he had wanted to play
a trick on me, such as some European
once played on a Chinese tailor in Foo-
chow, he could have selected three char-
acters with the same sound but with a
very different meaning without my know-
ing any better. The Foochow tailor, an
incredibly fat man, used to sit proudly,
naked to the waist, under a shop sign
that read “Jellybelly, Foreign - style
Tailor.”

“Tip”: I really have no desire to shoot
“Jobber” (B. 4/9/’46) or any other of
the “brutes who wear elastic-sided
boots.” But I do wish to tell him that
such boots are known to all who wear
them as “Romeos.” And as for their
being “well-tailored”! The description
would make any old “snob” swallow his
wax thread, bristle and all; “bespoke”
is the correct word. “Bespoke Romeos”
are comfortable and unprocurable in this
era of streamlined, shapeless monstrosi-
ties called shoes.

“Bozo”: In a Brisbane cockfighting
case a constable said the defendant threw
or pushed one bird towards the other. I
saw a number of these cockfights in
France in 1917, The set-up was a small
stadium with seats tiered up behind each
other around a space about 12 feet
square. In this space about two feet off
the floor was a wire enclosed cage about
six feet square and four feet high, with a
small hinged trapdoor on top at two ends.
Amid much babble two owners or trainers
would enter with a game rooster and
gently lower the steel-spurred birds into
the cage at each end. The cocks had long
bodies, comparatively short legs, were
well feathered and not our accepted
game fowls. The owners or trainers then
retired to handy seats and the betting re-
commenced. For a few minutes the fowls
would appear to ignore each other and
stroll about picking imaginary grain from
the floor. Then one would stretch up,
arch his neck and crow. On the other
crowing they would advance on each
other warily and the battle was on. They
would fly at and over each other, each
trying to drive the needle-sharp spur into
neck or body joint of the wing ; and it was
uncanny the way each knew the danger
of going down on the side with one wing
outstretched. As soon as that happened to
one the other was immediately on top of
him, pressing and pressing till that wing
was broken or dislocated at the body
joint, the while making picks or spur
thrusts at the jugular vein. The victor
was merciless and when he had killed his
opponent he crowed with all the strength
left in him. On my first visit I noted
that the bird which crowed first in two
events lost, so I put my money on the
silent one for the third contest, only to
be sorry I did not back the grouter. It s
a crook world, A bloke can’t even pick
winners in fowls,

“Sun-gazer”; A radio serial features a
private investigator who is invariably one
jump ahead of Scotland Yard, despite the
fact that listeners are a jump ahead of
him. When an episode concluded with
the fellow being bashed and left hang-
ing by the neck I felt it was only what
he deserved, and hoped the serial had
come to an end. My hopes were dashed
by the narrator’s opening next evening.
The hero had been rescued, “cut down
before death could take effect” and
“rushed to the best throat specialist in
England.”
* * * *
“A.C.T.”: That overworked word
“doover” (B. 18/9/’46) in my experi-
ence meant any mechanical aid from a
picklock to a bulldozer; a prepared posi-
tion such as slit trench, pup tent or
shelter half, mia mia, gunyah or make-
shift sleeping place. Highbrows gave the
word’s origin as French “ctceuvre” (not
“hors d’ceuvres” because it was only re-
motely applied to eats —only when they
were makeshift). Intelligent etymologists
offer “doofer,” short for “Do for now” or
“Do for the time being,” “doover” for the
most part being something temporarily
serving the. purpose till the right thing
turned up. Another story derives it from
a Sapper Duvier, in a Tommy engineers
outfit, who had a genius for improvisa-
tion, among his inventions being a type
of still extensively employed in making
moonshine in Mediterranean theatres of
war, jungle juice in New Guinea. Cer-
tainly the Junglejuicer was always chris-
tener the Doover with a capital D, when-
ever I struck it from Moresby to Morotai.
I never heard the Yanks use “doover.”
There is a verb “to doover.” It means
muckin’ about.
THE FORTUNATE ISLES.
“Since the Channel Islands were generously re-
stocked by Britain after the privations endured under
Nazi occupation, they are enjoying a period of luxury
unknown in England. ‘Sold Out’ notices and ‘No
Cigarettes’ placards are unknown, and prices are
ridiculously low.” — Cable.
They had their time of travail, dark and dread,
Of all that most they valued dispossessed,
The German flag a-flutter overhead,
The Nazi yoke upon their shoulders pressed.
Long years they bore and suffered, sore
distressed.
But now the wheel has turned, and you’ll
remark
In English eyes the Islands of the Blest
Are Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark.
Calm, sheltered lives for centuries they led,
And now they’re through the term of trial
and test
There’s none will grudge their being better fed
And better off, it seems, than all the rest
Of Britons. Surely they deserve the best
And brightest dawn after a night so dark,
Those dwellers in the Islands of the Blest,
Jersey and Guernsey, Alderney and Sark.
Doubt not they’ve whips of butter for their
bread,
While steak-and-onions on the board attest
Where herds of high-class kine the pastures
tread;
And salads, scientifically dressed
Are munched with eagerness and downed
with zest;
And sturdy peasants carol like the lark
In these the latest Islands of the Blest,
Jersey and Guernsey, Alderney and Sark.
Here’s to the folk by Fortune’s smiles caressed,
Where come no commissariat cares to cark,
Where fags await the customer’s request
And no-one is for income tax assessed,
The dwellers in the Islands of the Blest,
Jersey and Guernsey, Alderney and Sark!

“Got a cigarette paper?”
“Jason”; The day after the first raid
on Darwin we were about to shift to our
gun positions for an indefinite stay. We
had mounted our tractor and were wait-
ing to move off when we noticed and
were fascinated by a small tube of metal,
shining as it lay half-buried in the sand
between the ammo, trailer and ourselves.
Booby traps and the cunning of Tojo
had formed a major part of such dreams
as we had been able to manage on the
uneasy night of the 19th, and we had
soon convinced ourselves that the
minute the trailer wheel ran over the
thing we would “go up” and probably
take the rest of the gun park with us.
Just as we’d decided to toss to see who
was to be the mug to shift it our sarge
dismounted and came around to speak to
us. On his way he kicked “it” aside. When
we recovered we prayed that the Yank
bandsman who travelled in our tractor
to a concert two nights before was still
lamenting his lost mouthpiece and had
not brought any spares.

“C.R.0.”: Among the R.A.F, radar
instructors sent out to “learn” us “radio-
location” was “Tich,” a corporal, and
therefore a man of some standing in his
own estimation. But “Tich” never got
far. He barely made five feet four inches,
and at his very first appearance on
parade he created something of a sensa-
tion when, in his best parade-ground
voice, he bellowed “Righto, youse blokes ;
get felled in. The whistle’s went.”

“Qwert Yuiop”; How and when did
the potato get the brief and hearty name
of “spud”? Some learned folk have sug-
gested that it derives from the initials
of an educational body founded in the
early days of last century for improving
food standards, the “Society for Preven-
tion of Unpure Diet.” Others claim it as
the Erse name invented for its ancestors
introduced by Raleigh from Virginia.
Others again that it, or something like it,
was the original monicker given it by the
Indians and that “potato” grew out of a
combination of “pot” and “eat” to indi-
cate that it required cooking to make it
digestible.

“X.S.”: The long arm of the law
stretched out the other day in Mel-
bourne. A Russell-stree* detective found
a 14-year-old record of an unpaid £lO
fine, or six weeks, against a Chinaman.
He remembered a claimant in a case four
years back who bore the same name as
the defaulter. A couple of days later
he recognised his quarry in Little Bourke-
street and haled him off to headquarters.
As he entered the watchhouse the Celes-
tial dived into his pocket and produced
a tenner. “Me pay,” he said, smiling.
They let him go.

“Zake”: The joker who, paid at line-
age rates, tries to pad out his pars with
large slabs of quotations is an old friend ;
but at getting money for nothing he isn’t
in it with the “world-famous authority on
affairs of the heart” who distils his tripe
for the benefit of callow ’teen-agers in
my morning rag. Miss Sixteen writes
him a harrowing 25-line letter imploring
advice on the boy troubles that are re-
ducing her to a shadow of her former
self. The sage sends her into the empy-
rean with 3} lines which say exactly
nothing. Another quarter-witted bobby-
soxer pleads in 40 lines to be told how
to restore to her affections the pimpled
gallant who has callously transferred his
burning passion to a pig-tailed soaker-up
of ice-cream sodas. The Solomon-like
wisdom is contained in 8-| lines. Who
would fardels bear along the Inky Way
when such cops as these, are to be picked
up? Me for the Bobbysoxer and the
“A talking dog told me that one. Rude, isn't it?"
Boneheaded —but wait, I forgot. Wouldn t
the penning of these flappers’ letters to
yourself make any “adviser” reach for
the razor blade or the prussic acid after
a few months of it?

“Camsa”: Day after day, it was re-
ported, stones came flying through the
windows of an Adelaide schoolroom.
Students and teacher would immediately
scatter to find the culprits, but without
success. Class was moved to another
room, but the incidents continued. Class
went out under the trees and lessons pro-
ceeded without interruption, but the
stones flew again as soon as class returned
indoors. Police were called in, the school
surrounded and a patrol of cyclists
helped. With the police in the school-
room, stones continued to crash; one
boy showed a scar, another limped. At
last a Sherlock Holmes among the police
tumbled to the explanation. A search of
the boys’ desks disclosed 10 dumps of
ammunition. The whole class was in the
racket to escape lessons. When the
teacher’s back was turned the stones flew.
The police, having solved the mystery, left
judgment to the headmaster.

“Stanus”: R.A.A.F. Discrepancy Re-
ports (B. 18/9/’46)? One very bulky file
reached our unit after travelling around
most of Australia and the Pacific islands.
The C.O. decided to handle the matter
himself, and his minute read; “This
report now has 27 minutes, the discrepant
item being valued at 4s. 6d. At twopence
per minute it probably represents a
record low cost-per-minute in the pro-
duction of D.Rs. That distinction having
been achieved, I now recommend that
further waste of time and postage be
avoided by write-off at Public Expense.”
As it failed to bounce, minute 27 must
have struck a responsive chord some-
where.

“South Steyne”: Mrs. South Steyne
and I were enjoying afternoon tea
when the front door-bell rang violently.
Opening the door, I
was confronted by
two policemen, a ser-
geant and a young
copper. “Do William
and John South
Steyne live here?”
barked the sergeant.
“Yes,” I answered.
“What’s the matter?”
“I wanta see ’em,”
went on the sergeant.
“I’ve got a report
about ’em. Destruc-
tion of council pro-
perty, smashing the
new dressing-shed in
the oval, destroying
swings and slippery
dips, ripping down
fences and damaging
the war memorial.”
“Come in, sarge,” I
said, at the same
time calling out to
the wife to bring
Bill and Jack. As
the coppers seated
themselves Bill (4)
and Jack (3) were ushered into the
presence of the law. The sergeant took
a lot of convincing that the infants were
• really the William and John he was seek-
ing. A gang of young vandals had run
riot in the local park the day before, and
my nippers had been innocent bystanders,
The usual muddle-headed female had
noticed their presence and, they being
the only ones whose names she knew, had
passed the information on to the police,
“Bozo”: “Spinifex” (B. 25/9/’46) on
the subject of Army Disposals reminds
me of all the cooking utensils now being
“released” to gadget-hungry housewives,
if they are lucky enough to beat buyers
from hotels and cafes. It is an amusing
thought that the very spoons once wielded
by greasy babblers to dole out goldfish
and dehydrated spud in jungle messhuts
are perhaps now being used by white-clad
chefs dishing out desserts to diners at
exclusive hostels.

“Max”: I met my friend the Eminent
Alienist coming down the stairs from an
exhibitipn of neo-vorticists, a dread-
ful display of wasted paints, canvas and
paper. “Hullo,” I said, “I didn’t know
you patronised this sort of thing.” ‘ I
come every year—wouldn’t miss it for
anything,” he said; “I always' like to
know where my next patients are coming
from.” Art critics may help themselves
to this new angle-on-motives, as they
probably put it.

“Pontius Penwiper”: On the day be-
fore the opening of the cricket season I
was anxious to know what were the
grade fixtures for the next day, up to
then unannounced; another wish was
to learn the details, of an accident I had
seen and whether the chap the ambulance
had hurried away was alive or dead;
moreover, the judgment in an equity
action, which would establish an impor-
tant precedent, whichever way it went,
was something else I wished to know.
What I did learn from my papers was
“Got a cigarette paper?”
that the visiting English cricketers enjoyed
eating bananas, and that some more
ghoulish murders had taken place in
U.S.A.; and not a word was said about
the legal matter, though there were
several qourt references mostly concern-
ing drunks and damsels of easy virtue.
One no longer expects news from modern
papers, but some day someone is going
to give the existing rags a shock by start-
ing a real newspaper with roundsmen to
cover all the news instead of merely the
sensations.

“L.H.P.”: So Australia is to have a
visit from Canada Lee, a negro actor in
“Othello.” He is not .the first of his
race to play the Moor m Australia. In
July, 1880, at the old Queen’s Theatre,
York-street, Sydney, we had a season by
Hacket Coalhurst, a negro tragedian,
billed as “the Ira Aldridge of Australia.”
Aldridge was a negro actor of some
repute in the ’sixties on the London stage.
Mrs. Kendal played Desdemona to his
Moor. Coalhurst played “Othello” very
well, and his support included J. P. West
dago), Harry Leston (Roderigo), Kale
Douglas (Emilia), and Alice Deorwyn
(Desdemona), One of Coalhurst’s bits
of “business” was where in one of the
scenes he had to say “Your hand, Des-
demona,” He made a point of opening
his hand and making the lady place her
hand in his. The audience, quick to see
the contrast, always applauded, Coal-
hurst also figured in “The Slave’s
Revenge,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and
other plays at the Queen’s,
* * * *
“Kalgurli”: From the early days of
Kalgoorlie the pie-stall was an in-
stitution at which, towards midnight,
people from all sections of the com-
munity might be found scoffing a
pie or lapping up a plate of soup.
War killed the business, but recently a
returned soldier applied to the council
for permission to open a stall. The re-
quest was turned down on the motion of
two publicans, who contended that pie-
stalls attracted “undesirable persons.”
The resultant newspaper controversy
rather overshadowed the Federal elec-
tions. Pie-stall advocates said that the
only “undesirable persons” they had
encountered at the stall were drunks
from the pub. One correspondent quoted
reports purporting to show that pie-
stalls were a menace to sobriety and
good government in Timbuctoo. The
fight is still raging.

“Maski”: If hangman Pierrepont is
dissatisfied with the 10 guineas a head
and ail found reported as the wage for
his mass job at Nuremberg, he could find
consolation in the list of payments for
public executioners that used to be shown
to tourists visiting the Rathhaus there:
For flogging a prisoner, 20 kreutzers;
putting on the thumbscrews, 1 florin, 30
kreutzers; branding one criminal, 5 florins;
keeping up the tire, making the pincers
red hot' and applying them, 5 florins;
breaking a prisoner on the wheel, 6 florins;
hewing off one hand, 3 florins; hewing
off one finger, 3 florins; cutting off the
nose and ears of one person, 3 florins;
taking a dead body from the wheel, bury-
ing it or flinging it into the pit, 9 florins.
That wasn’t the only survival of the days
of torture exhibited in Nuremberg; un-
less the bombing destroyed it, a sight that
Pierrepont can view there with fellow-
feeling is a very realistic statue of a bag-
pipe-player.

“Fitz” remembers:
The parsing of John Barr (B. 25/9/’46)
reminds me that when 1 joined The Bulletin's
editorial department (as an office boy) 30 years
ago S. H. Prior was editor, Barr associate-editor,
Edmond leader-writer, Arthur H. Adams ran
“The Red Page” and David McKee Wright
vetted short stories and verse and wrote
reams of prose and poetry. Ernest O’Ferrall
(“Kodak”) covered' the theatres, subbed
various pages and wrote inimitable drunk
stories. Jbhn Bede Dailey was in France
with the A.1.F., and Fred Kirby was con-
tributing political articles and running the sport-
ing pages in his stead. Harold Burston was
assistant financial editor under S. H. Prior,
and Margaret Cox-Taylor (“Vandorian”) wrote
the “Woman’s Letter.” Edmund Fisher, writer
of that classic “The Billiard Marker’s Yarn,”
was Melbourne literary representative. All are
gone to their long rest except Fred Kirby, now
a “S. M. Herald” court reporter. My first
recollection of John Barr is- of John and
“Kodak” carrying Frank Morton, who had
“passed out” one perfect beer-drinking day,
down the stairs at 214 George-street. John
and “Kodak” occupied the same room and it
was my job to take tea around to the editorial
staff. “Kodak,” who had the appearance of
a mild curate, drank it by the gallon. John
would politely accept the cup I placed on his
desk, pick it up, walk to a window and pour
the brew into the lane beneath. “Kodak”
would protest at the waste and offer to drink
it himself. Barr would reply, “If you want
to drink two cups you can pay for two cups.
I pay for the pleasure of throwing the stuff
out the window.” This went on for some
time until one day John growled, “Take it
away; take it away, or you’ll be turning me
into a writer of drunk stories like ‘Kodak.’ ”

“Hist”: Those bamboo signets with
which Nip soldiers were provided (B.
25/9/’46) had a parallel in the 1914-18
war, Turkish soldiers in Palestine carried
small brass signets, inscribed with Arabic
symbols, which we concluded were used
to sign for pay, or to satisfy that crav-
ing for signatures which is universal
among Q.Ms. I still have a couple
which I souvenired in a Jacko hospital
after the capture of Jericho. Sight of
them recalls the stench of the place, which
was full of dead and half-dead typhus
cases.

would have knocked the factious dogs on the head,
to be sure, but I was not vexed.’ , ,™
.— Boswell’s Life of Johnson •
Keep up your peckers and your chins, good
You’ve no occasion to look glum and daik
If you recall the old philosopher’s
Emphatically sensible remark.
Albeit disappointed and perplexed,
He wouldn’t have it said that he was vexed.
When Whigs maintained their hold on power,
he said, , , ,
He, as a Tory, stubborn, staunch and stern,
Would cheerfully have knocked them on the
head
Without the least compunction or concern.
But, whatsoever guerdons they annexed,
’Twas stupid to suggest that he was vexed.
The proof? He never slept an hour the less
Howe’er elections went, or missed a meal
Or weakened in appreciativeness
Of well-cooked mutton or of prune-stuffed
veal,
Or even docked himself presumably
Of half a cup of his belovM tea.
Public affairs vex no man, he’d assert.
No form of Government, he told his pal
Boswell, could do a thing to help or hurt
The welfare of the individual,
Which made it foolish to seem vexed about
Whigs staying in or Tories stopping out.
Keep up your peckers, sports who’ve lost your
tin
Now Labor’s once again to office won.
If you can hoist your whack of victuals in
And sleep as soundly as you’ve ever done
It’s clear enough, sustained by Johnson’s text.
You can rebut the charge of being vexed.

THE SERVICE MAN
The Underground in Borneo.
“Ek Dum”; In October, 1945, it was
customary to see the streets of Australian
cities lined with tearful or cheering
watchers as prisoners-of-war from Singa-
pore and Siam came home. In October,
1946, it is sometimes difficult to believe
that there ever were any prisoners-of-war,
especially the thousands who lie dead in
Borneo.
There has been a general election. In
the general election gallant commanders
whose names should be in every school-
book, and who stood for East Sydney,
Eden-Monaro and Hume, were forced to
drop their military ranks lest home-keep-
ing electors should be prejudiced against
them on the ground that they fought
heroically for their country and, in fight-
ing, showed qualities of leadership which
raised them to the command of thousands
of men. It appears to be accepted even
by Liberal organisers that service to the
country is something better forgotten, an
opinion in which the “Government” con-
curred emphatically, and also very wisely,
since wherever the issue of war raised its
head “Government” candidates faced
anxiety and sometimes defeat.
Borneo was the p.-0.-w. grave. But so
little has the disaster impressed itself on
the minds of the public that a Sydney
jockey’s funeral created more interest
and hysteria than the loss of all the
tortured of Borneo.
Yet the deaths of the thousands in
Borneo might have been avoided. Con-
ditions which ruled in the camps reveal
looseness of control and ease of access
which would have made an attempt at
rescue well worth while, at almost any
stage. Such an attempt was urged on
“Labor” time and time again.
The first Eighth Division p.-0,-w.
section sent to Borneo was known as
“B” Force. It was organised into H.Q.
and three battalions. It left Singapore
on July 8, 1942, and arrived in Sandakan
on July 18, taking up its quarters in an
internment camp at the Eight-Mile peg
before being set to work on an aerodrome
near the Government Experimental
Station.
It found Borneo in a state of captivity,
having capitulated, in accordance with
orders, without bloodshed, on January 19,
1942. Heads of Government depart-
ments had been at first ordered to remain
at their posts to secure the recall of fire-
arms and otherwise to prepare for Jap-
anese assumption of authority. The other
civilians (90 or so) were interned on
Berhala Island, near the mouth of Sanda-
kan Harbor. Within three weeks most
of the British officials had been sent to
the island.
Those left behind were Mr. O. Mavor,
manager and chief engineer to the San-
dakan Electric Supply, who was confined
with his wife to the powerhouse bunga-
low ; Mr. Phillips, manager of the 8.N.8.
Trading Company, who was allowed to
remain and carry on his business (he had
a Malay wife); Dr. P. J. Taylor, a
member of the Legislative Council; Dr.
Stookes and Dr, Laband, a German-
ic wish refugee dentist. The last two were
confined to the hospital. Dr. Taylor was
allowed to remain at home with his wife.
Escape Plans
The “B” Force and a party known as
“E” Force, which was sent first to
Kuching and then to Berhala Island,
from the first envisioned and planned for
the chances of escape or rescue. The “E”
Force had not left Singapore until April,
1943. It was under command of Major
Fairley, but in accordance with the Jap-
anese policy of isolating men from their
officers Major Fairley was left at Kuch-
ing. There the force remained in the
p.-0.-w. camp for eight days before be-
ing sent to Sandakan in a small boat, via
Labuan. It was disembarked at Berhala
Island Quarantine Station on April 21, ’43.
While at Kuching, three sappers of
the 2 /6th Field Co. who had decided on
an escape plan before leaving Singapore—
Keating, Marshall and Jensen —began
their preparations. They made contact
with forestry officials in the civilian
camps. One of these officials, Mr. G.
Brown, gave them information about two
possible escape routes one south
through the Celebes, one through Kuda
and Jolo Islands to the Philippines.
Brown also gave them a letter of intro-
duction to his Malay houseboy, Apostel,
in Sandakan. The Three Musketeers of
escape now talked over their plans with
Lieut. C. A. Wagner, 2/18th Battalion,
Intelligence Officer of the “E” Force, who
spoke Malay.
Contact with the mainland and “B”
Force was established so soon as Berhala
was reached. This was achieved through
members of the British North Borneo
Armed Constabulary, *who were function-
ing ostensibly under Japanese command,
but actually to a large extent under clan-
destine orders from the Governor and
the prisoners. It was found that arrange-
ments for escape attempts in “B” Force
were well advanced, largely through the
initiative of Captain L. Matthews, a South
Australian, company commander in “E”
Battalion, and Lieuts. R. G, Wells and
A. G, Weynton.
Dr. Taylor’s Gallantry
These arrangements had developed
from a series of events centring, in par-
ticular, in the gallantry of Dr. Taylor
and his devoted wife, and in general in
all the free civilians, together with a few
Chinese, Indians and Malays; heroes all.
First contact with Dr. Taylor was made
by Lieut.-Col. Shepherd, S.M.O. of “B”
Force, and Lieut. Sligo, R.A.N., who re-
joiced (mildly) in the title “Canteen
Officer,” but who was really Intelligence
Officer, “B” Force. They were allowed
to go into town by a Jap guard to ask
the doctor for medical supplies. The
Japanese command was annoyed at this
laxity, but the damage was done. The
canteen was withheld for two or three
weeks by way of reprisal. During that
period Lieut. Sligo died of dysentery.
Captain Matthews took over his duties as
Intelligence Officer.
Somewhere about the end of July, 1942,
Lieut.-Colonel Walsh, still in command of
“B” Force, asked for permission for
officers to go gardening outside the camp
perimeter, on the ground that they needed
the exercise. This request was granted.
At first the Japs made the mistake of
allowing the officers out without guards;
and this they had cause to regret. The
officers promptly made contact with the
corporal in charge of the police station.
Corporal Arbin, a Dusun man, who
offered at once to establish communica-
tion with Dr. Taylor and with Berhala
Island.
In August, on the plea of vitamin de-
ficiency, Captain Picone, of “E” Bat-
talion, “B” Force, obtained permission for
a party to gather nuts for the purpose of
extracting palm oil. This gave Matthews
and a small party, including Lieuts. Ewin
and Esler, a chance to make further con-
tact with Taylor, who supplied them with
drugs, and with the governor of Berhala
internment camp, Mr. Smith.
Still another channel was established
when Lieut, Wells took permanent charge
of a wood party, which was detailed to
supply the powerhouse with fuel. Here,
through the offices of Dick Maginal (who
had previously introduced Corporal
Arbin), contact was made with two very
loyal Chinese, Ah Ping, in charge of the
powerhouse engineroom, and Wong, who
worked at the Government Experimental
Farm. Wong spoke perfect English.
By the end of August, Matthews’s style
was cramped by a more rigid supervision
of the officers’ garden party. Wells hav-
ing greater freedom in his wood-hunting
activities, Matthews took him into his
confidence, and Wells became 2/i.c. In-
telligence. Their difficulties were not
light, nor were they lessened by the
presence in the camp of a half-caste
Chinese whom they knew to be acting
as a Jap spy.
However, through Constable Arbin,
communications with Taylor and the
governor were maintained weekly, partly
in cypher. From Maginal were obtained
a crystal detector and a pair of head-
phones ; from Apostel, the servant of Mr.
Brown of the Forestry Department, two
radio tubes ; and route plans of the elec-
trical and telephone lines of Sandakan
were got from Ah Ping.
Presently Wong and Apostel made
available data about inland trades and
conditions and forestry-survey maps of
British North Borneo. And Alex Funk,
a Eurasian, formerly overseer of the
P.W.D., whom Arbin had brought into
the conspiracy, gave Matthews a .38 re-
volver and supplied him with details of
the activities of a number of Chinese in
Sandakan. These Chinese were in con-
tact with Filipino guerrillas in Batu
Batu Island in the Sulus. A mass of in-
formation from working parties was also
collected.
Meanwhile Dr. Taylor had become the
head and front of the organisation outside

WHAT EVERY MECHANIC
SHOULD KNOW
Now, young mechanics, please
beware,
And exercise the greatest care
To use the very best of light
And so avoid an oversight;
For just imagine how it feels
To find you’ve left out half the
wheels—
A thing like that cannot arise
When "OSRAM” lamps the
light supplies.
the camp. He was a quiet, small man
from Yass (N.S.W.), the last who would
be picked at sight in the street as the
leader of a desperate venture.
By paying in his own money and forg-
ing drug-store entries when carrying on
his authorised practice of selling medicines
to the natives, Dr. Taylor was able to
obtain small medical supplies for the
p.-0.-w. He maintained regular weekly
traffic with the camps through Corporal
Arbin, whose duties brought him into
Sandakan once a month, sending out
atebrin, quinine, various M and B pre-
parations, ether, sterilised bandages,
iodine and chemicals for radio batteries ;
also priceless, though meagre, cargoes of
surgical instruments and occasional food'
for the seriously ill. And he made himself
a centre of organisation and information
for the benefit of the prisoners, so that
he and his devoted wife, who did all the
clerical and cypher work incidental to his
operations, were in hourly peril of dis-
covery and execution.
Finally Dr. Taylor organised the col-
lection of a fund from trusted Europeans
and natives, placing the money where it
would be available to p.-0.-w. in case of
escape. A staunch and generous con-
tributor was Mrs. M. Y. Cohen, the
wealthy owner of a Sandakan store. Not
satisfied with this, the doctor arranged
for the feeding of A.I.F. men in San-
dakan jail, through Dr. Stookes, who had
access to the jail. He even established a
sort of underground fiscal system, induc-
ing wealthy Chinese in Sandakan to ex-
change Australian £1 notes into dollars at
the pre-war rate of 6.40 to the £l. He
personally subsidised the rate to bring it
to seven dollars to the pound. From
each £1 two dollars was deducted by
camp authorities for the purpose of buy-
ing blackmarket food for the hospital and
canteen through the good offices of the
wood party.
It is a commentary on Canberra’s grati-
tude that, so far. Dr. Taylor has been
allowed to carry the cost of this organisa-
tion, though he is broken in health by the
privations and torture which he after-
wards suffered as the reward of his
heroism. The British authorities have
seen to it that he has been awarded a
decoration. The “Government” at Can-
berra has not even expressed its thanks
to him on behalf of the nation or to his
devoted Chinese and Malays. It is a
disgrace to the Commonwealth.
Digger Prisoner Commands Police
The Berhala Island communications
were managed through the loyal police.
Arbin, on his weekly visit to Sandakan,
carried the mail. With the help of four
gallant Indian warrant officers of the
force —Jamadara, Curaiaman, Yang-
salan and Ojaga Singh—weekly notes
were passed from Sept., 1942, till Janu-
ary, 1943, when civilians were transferred
to Kuching. Major Rice-Oxley, normal
British Commandant of Police, was thus
able to establish his clandestine command,
and to issue orders from time to time for
co-operation with Matthews and Wells in
the event of an Allied move towards tak-
ing Sandakan —a move which the lightly-
guarded and isolated nature of the area
suggested as possible at any time.
Most of the communications from
Berhala were written by the governor in
person, and weekly radio news summaries
were sent to him from the camp. The
civilian internees provided two money
contributions for the use of the camp
hospital. When Major Rice-Oxley was
sent to Kuching, he officially transferred
control of the police to Captain
Matthews, A.1.F., who reopened com-
munication with Berhala three months
later in April, 1943, on the arrival of
“E” Force.
The coming of this access of prisoners
lent a new zest to operations. Its presence
was first notified in a note from Captain
Steele, 2/i.c. Matthews and his men
acquired some new radio parts. News
of the A.I.F. in general was regularly
exchanged, and when, six weeks later,
the “E” Force was brought to the main-
land and set down some distance from
“B” Force lamp signalling was used to
keep up communication.
Building a Radio
Hitherto there had been only distant
contact with Mr. Mavor through his en-
gine-room manager, Ah Ping, and his
chief engineer, Ah Kong. Early in
April, 1943, the need of various electri-
cal equipment made it urgent that Mavor
should be approached more directly,
though this risked the lives of himself
and his wife. Ail communications were
made in cypher. Mrs. Mavor acted as
code clerk at the Mavor end. Lagan, a
Chinese, supplied Mavor with details of
Japanese movements and m.-g. posts,
which he obtained while working for the
Jap police as a detective.
The camp wireless had been built up
piecemeal. Maginal had given the origi-
nal parts in October, 1942. Corporal
Arbin produced a condenser and a tele-
phone receiver. NX68389 Corporal
Rickards, 2/3 M.A.C., who had a con-
siderable sum of money, bought radio
parts from Sergeant W. Wallace, who
was working on the aerodrome and who
obtained them through a Chinese named
Ju Ming. Lieutenant Weynton, with the
help of Rickards and Corporal Small
and Mills, built the set, which was put
into operation on November 4, 1942 —
a great day for the troops.
A special chemical rectifier, using test
tubes supplied by Sergeant McDonough,
10 A.G.H. dispenser, was used to con-
vert the camp A.C. to D.C. Low tension
came from primary coils. It was a
pretty ingenious job, a source of com-
fort, and at the same time a source of
anxiety. Distribution of news, and the
long night watches which were entailed
in getting it, were shared at first by
Weynton and Rickards, but later fell on
the shoulders of Rickards alone. After
Rickards became ill the set was handed
over to Weynton on May 15, 1943, and
Weynton became the dispenser of all that
was known of the Great Outside.
By April, 1943, the more ambitious
project of building a transmitter was in
the air; and it was in connection with
this that Wells approached Mavor in
April, 1943—and not in vain. In the
succeeding months power-transformers
were made by Mavor and his Chinese,
with other equipment to prison-camp
specifications, and with other needed
equipment. And Mr. Phillips, of the
8.N.8. Trading Co., provided other parts.
These were passed on by Ah Kong to
Ah Ping, and by Ah Ping to Wells, who
began the construction of the trans-
mitter, though it was never completed.
A.I.F. Manages Powerhouse
Meanwhile, map knowledge of Sanda-
kan and its routes had been obtained,
largely through Corporal Arbin and
Warrant-Officer Ojaga Singh, together
with well-tabulated information from
Australian truck-drivers working in the
town.
But audacity surely reached its
limit in the persuasion of the Japanese by
Matthews to allow Sergeant Stevens to
work at the power station. There he
acted as a centre for the collection of
news, and arranged for the boosting of
electrical-supply voltage by Ah Ping
during the camp hours of radio recep-
tion. He also arranged a little sabotage.
The Japs are, no doubt, still wondering
what happened to one of their steam-
shovels and to a valuable Fordson trac-
tor.
{The rest of the story will be told next
week.)
After a 24-day hearing at the Central
Police Court, Sydney, Major Charles
Hughes Cousens was committed for trial
at the Criminal Court on November 18 on
a charge of treason. Whether he will be
sent for trial is, oddly enough, for the
N.S.W. —not Commonwealth —Attorney-
General to determine. During the week
evidence for the defence was given by
Lt.-Commander Henshaw, U.S. Navy,
who had been flown to Sydney from
Japan. Commander Henshaw said that
Major Cousens had written double mean-
ings, more so than any other p.-0.-w., into
his scripts, and that, in the presence of
the Japanese, he was always completely
composed, “always an officer and a
gentleman.” In committing Major
Cousens for trial, Mr. Farrington, S.M.,
said:
I have a doubt that prosecutions of this
nature can be brought in this State, but it
is not my province to resolve that doubt.
A higher authority can do so, or it may be
that the Attorney-General may decline to
file a bill. Having decided at the close
of the evidence for the prosecution that
there was a prima facie case, and assum-
ing that I had jurisdiction to embark upon
the inquiry, it now remains as to the
action to be taken by me under Sub-
section 6 of Section 41 of the Justices Act.
The authorities lay down that it is for the
jury to ascertain the truth or falsity of the
evidence given by the witnesses when there
is a conflict of evidence, and it is then
the duty of the Justice to act in terms of
paragraph B of that sub-section.
Major Cousens was granted bail (£500)
by the State Full Court.

Three members of the crew of The'
Truculent Turtle, the U.S. Navy bomber
which broke the long-distance record by
flying 11,237 miles from Guildford (W.A.)
to Columbus (Ohio), graduated together
from Annapolis Naval Academy in 1937
and worked together on many occa-
sions during the war. They are Com-
manders T. D. Davies (the skipper), E.
P. Rankin and W. S. Reid. The last two
were on Pacific service for most of the
war, as was Commander R. H. Tabeling ;
Davies put in most of his time operating
over the Atlantic from a station in
Brazil. At Guildford their ’plane had as
a close neighbor the Aries, which had
just broken the England-New Zealand
record ; a veteran with many records and
nearly a quarter of a million miles to her
credit. During the Turtle’s long flight,
half-way across the world, which beat
the previous best non-stop effort by
3321 miles, the four men ■ took
turn and turn about as pilot, navigator
and wireless operator, the odd man out
taking the chance to snatch some sleep.
The four Americans made many friends
in the West, and, as they were speed-
ing on their way, they flashed a message:
“Thanks to Civil Aviation ; all friends ;
great co-operation.” Sole Australian on
the record-breaking trip was a young
kangaroo, a gift from the Perth Zoo.
Claude Dixon Gibb, back in his native
Adelaide on a visit from Britain, has gone
a long way since he went abroad on an
Angas Scholarship in 1924. He’s chair-
man and managing-director of the C. A.
Parsons Tyneside engineering concern,
and was director-general of weapons pro-
duction and chairman of the Tank Board
under the Ministry of Supply. Gibb
gained his M-E. degree at Adelaide ’Var-
sity, his first practical experience with
Gibb and Miller at Port Adelaide, and his
Hawkesley Gold Medal from the Insti-
tute of Mechanical Engineers, and his
war-time service in munitions production
earned him a knighthood. Still on the
bright side of 50, he had two years with
the A.F.C. in World War I.
Major-General C. E, Weir, a Maori-
lander, has been appointed to the Im-
perial Defence College. During the
absence of General Freyberg, in hospital
with wounds, Weir was in temporary com-
mand of the Maorilanders in Italy, and
later commanded the 46th British Divi-
sion. A native of Otago, he was chosen
at 21 to go to the Royal Military College
at Woolwich. Returning to M.L., he left
again with the Second Expeditionary
Force and was the youngest brigadier in
M.L. forces. He won his D.S.O. in
Libya and added a bar to it at El Ala-
mein.
Warren Austin, successor to Stettinius
as permanent American delegate to the
United Nations Security Council, is a
68-year-old lawyer Senator from Ver-
mont, and thus a Republican. Before
America came into the war he was advo-
cating discussions with Britain on the
nature of the post-war world and sug-
gested something along U.N.O. lines.
Today he looks upon the United Nations
as the cornerstone of U.S. policy, but
deplores the whittling down of American
armed forces since the Japanese sur-
render, pointing out that in order to
carry out its pledges the nation must re-
main strong.
Pulteney Grammar, Adelaide, gets a
new head with the appointment of W. R.
Ray. Ordained in 1936, he’s a 8.A.,
licentiate of theology, and former rector
of St. Peter’s, Glenelg. Ray was also in
charge of Koolunga mission, and has been
assistant chaplain and housemaster at
St. Peter’s College for the past six years,
and chaplain of the C. of E. Boys Home,
Walkerville, since 1944. Pulteney Gram-
mar, one of our oldest schools, will cele-
brate its centenary next May.
Passed on at Brighton (Vic.) at 88, Rev.
Frederick Charles Vian, whose lectures
Sidelights on the Bushrangers were based
on his knowledge of the Kelly gang.
His brother-in-law, W. Gould, also a
parson, officiated at the wedding* of Mrs.
Kelly to George King at the Primitive
Methodist Church, Benalla, in February,
1874. One of the witnesses who signed
the register was Ned, then 20 years old.
He was the only one of the quartet of
the principals who signed his name. The
bride, bridegroom and other witness
(Skillion) scrawled a cross.
Wilfred Thomas Haslam, new Director
of Works in S.A., is a Tasmanian who
served his articles as an architect before
World War I, then enlisted in Sydney
and went to France with Ninth Engineers.
After discharge from the A.I.F. he joined
the Commonwealth Department of
WORKS DIRECTOR.
Works and Railways, and by 1930 was
architect in charge of Commonwealth
Works in Sydney, supervising such jobs
as the building of the Commonwealth
Bank’s head office. In 1936 he was sent
to Java and Singapore to study tropical
design, and the outbreak of war found
him in Melbourne with the Defence De-
partment as liaison officer on defence
works. He first came to S.A. in 1940
to build the Finsbury and Salisbury
munition plants, and when those jobs
were finished he was put in charge of
Allied Works Council projects in
the Northern Territory. Haslam,
diagrammed here by Coventry, admits to
rolling an undistinguished bowl, and is
proud of his energetic daughter, who has
won diving championships in Adelaide.
Rupert Bunny, who, on his 82nd birth-
day, sees the whole of the Latrobe Gal-
lery in the National Gallery in Mel-
bourne, given over to his works, was
never a gum-tree artist. He was a
Parisian of the Parisians, though the choice
of that Mecca of the arts was largely
accidental. Born at St. Kilda, the son
of a Ballarat lawyer who became
a Judge, he was destined for civil en-
gineering but hadn’t gone far at Mel-
bourne Uni. when he chucked it for
architecture. Then Folingsby opened the
art school at the National Gallery and
Bunny threw up architecture for painting
and became a fellow student with Phillips
Fox, Bertram Mackennal and John Long-
staff. At 20 he left Australia for Europe
on a brief visit which extended to half
a lifetime. While Streeton and Long-
staff were making names for themselves
in Australia Bunny was making his in
Paris. His early pictures were all in the
French academic tradition and they found
their way into every salon. He was the
first Australian to have two of his paint-
ings bought by the Luxembourg. He re-
turned to Australia in 1911 but went
back to France shortly after. When his
wife, the daughter of a French colonel,
died he came home to Victoria and has
stayed there ever since, quietly painting
and composing music—he has this sister
interest, as well as a love of good wine
and good food. The kindliest of men, he
has helped many young artists in their
first steps,
Oscar N. Diamond certainly earned
his recent award of the D.F.C., for grand
work right at the beginning of the
Jap war. He carried out two night
attacks and sank a 10,000-ton transport,
then he blew up the railway line near
the Thailand border. On one flight one
engine was out of action and the aircraft
severely damaged, but Oscar got it home.
From Sumatra he continued the good
work, and, after a bombing raid on Jap
sea forces approaching Palembang, his
aircraft was again damaged and he
crash-landed on the aerodrome after
the Japs had taken it. He and crew got
into another Hudson on the strip ; it had
six inches of propeller tips missing and
their attempts to get it off failed.
Diamond then led them back through
paddy fields under Jap fire. After 10
hours they reached Palembang, but in the
end were captured. Diamond was at
Mukden when Hirohito turned it in.
G. A. Osborne, M.A., Dip. Ed.,
appointed chief inspector of Victorian
primary schools in succession to W, H.
Ellwood, M.C., has had a long career in
the teaching service. He was placed
first in the entrance examination for the
Teachers’ College, won the Gladman
teaching prize in 1905, the Dwight prize
for theory and practice and two degrees
in education. He spent six months in
Canada and U.S.A., under a Carnegie
scholarship, investigating educational
practice in those parts. He was appointed
inspector from the headmastership of
Mildura High School and knows the Vic-
torian education system inside out.
Died at Gundaroo (N.S.W.) at 77, Mrs.
J. B. N. Osborne, whom old-time theatre-
goers knew as Maud Jeffries, a leading
light of the Australian stage at the turn
of the century. Maud was bom in Mis-
sissippi and played in the U.S.A. and
London before Wilson Barrett made her
his leading lady in such successes as “The
Silver King,” “The Lady of Lyons” and
as Desdemona and Ophelia. She was the
original Mercia in “The Sign of the
Cross.’’ Barrett brought her to Australia
in 1897, and after a season in London
with Beerbohm Tree she came to this
part of the world again with Julius
Knight and played in a long string of
plays, including “The Eternal City” and
“Monsieur Beaucaire.” In 1906 she
married a member of the Osborne
pastoralist family who had done a bit
of strutting on the boards,' and retired
from the stage, her only appearance
thereafter being in a charity per-
formance of “Pygmalion and Galatea”
in 1910. Maud Jeffries was a cap-
tivating beauty, and on one occasion
when she was touring in W.A. her man-
agement wanted to put on a Sunday show,
Maud was appointed a committee of one
to interview the bearded Minister,
“Mulga” Taylor. A Sunday show was
against , all precedent in Perth, but
“Mulga” couldn’t resist the stunning
woman, and the show went on.
Brisbane contributors to the last Com-
monwealth loan were entertained by the
aerobatics of a small silver speck about
10,000 feet above the Brisbane River.
The speck, with a 540 m.p.h. power dive,
TEST PILOT.
materialised into a Mustang. The pilot
was Wally Rae, who has just been handed
his bowler hat by the R.A.A.F. after six
and a half years’ service. He’s flown
2650 hours in 34 types of aircraft—in-
cluding Spits, Kittys, Mustangs, Hudsons,
Mitchells, Mosquitos, Catalinas and
Liberators. Wallace Alexander Ram-
say Rae left the Ma State when he was
16 to go jackerooing in Queensland for
the Australian Pastoral Co., and was
managing one of its stations when he
joined the R.A.A.F. early in 1940. Under
the E.A.T.S. he went with the first batch
of trainees to Rhodesia and thence to
Coastal Command in England on Hud-
sons, Libs and, for a time, Catalinas.
After a turn at Dakar and a spell on
instructing in England, he crossed the
Atlantic on the Queen Mary and was
one of the first Australians to fly Libera-,
tors to Australia from America. Since
then he’s been mainly test-flying all
manner of single-, twin- and multi-
engined aircraft and has tested most
of the R.A.A.F.’s Liberators. He
hasn’t scratched a ’plane yet. A brother,
Group-Captain Ron Ramsay-Rae, joined
the R.A.F. in 1931, was a p.-0,-w. for
three and a half years after being caught
in Singapore, and is now C.O. of the
R.A.F. station, Lechonfield, in Lincoln.
C. K. Gamble, promoted to vice-
president of Standard-Vacuum Oil of
New York, is well known in Australia.
He spent 14 years in this country, the
last seven as chairman and managing
director of Vacuum Oil. During the war
he was up to his neck in work for the
American Red Cross and the A.C.F. and
took a leading part in raising funds for
the relief of victims of bombing raids on
Britain.
Gerald Stokely Doorly, master mariner
and pilot, has crowded a lot of writing
as well as maritime adventure into
his 66 years. Born in Trinidad, the
son of a canon, he was apprenticed to
sailing ships from the training ship Wor-
cester. He did trooping and hospital-
ship work during the Boer War, was
third officer on the Morning, which went
to the relief of Scott’s Antarctic expedi-
tion of 1902, commanded 24 steamship
vessels in 14 years, transported ML.
troops in the Great War, was torpedoed
in the English Channel, and after the war
was over landed in Fremantle with a
sheaf of stories about the life of a trans-
port commander which started publica-
tion in The Bulletin in the same week.
Since 1925 Doorly has been in the Port
Phillip Pilot Service, and has published
The Voyages of the Morning, The Hand-
Maiden of the Navy and Songs of the
Morning. He is president of the Ship-
lovers’ Society of Victoria, whose
magazine, the Dogwatch, exhales the
salt breath of the old windjammer
days. Doorly met a companion sea-
dog in Captain Stanley Batt the other
day, and recalled a set of verses by Batt,
“The Sixty Milers,” which appeared in
The Bulletin 25 years ago. They are
being reprinted in the Christmas Dog-
watch.
Into the silence:
At 75, in Melbourne, Amy Grace Godwin
Smith, elocutionist. Much of her work was
done amongst hospitals, and doctors sent
patients to her for correction of speech impedi-
ments.
In Sydney, S. W. Jackson, one of Australia’s
leading naturalists. Born in Queensland, he
spent much of his life in remote parts of tne
Commonwealth in search pf rare specimens or
plant and animal life. Birds were his special
hobby.
In Melbourne, at 66, James Thomas Collett,
for 18 years head gardener at Flemington race-
course. His nurseries and hothouses and his
floral pictures, especially his annual Cup Bay
exhibition, were a feature of the course.
In Melbourne, at 80, Norman Bayles,
M L.A. for Toorak in the State Assembly tor
14 years. A solicitor, he was an excellent
tennis player in his young days and an ingrati-
ating personality, though never much of a poli-
tician.
In Melbourne, at 83, Dr. A. L. Kenny,
surgeon and leading Catholic layman. Bom
in County Galway, he was educated at Xavier
College, Melbourne, and graduated from Mel-
bourne University. He was a private chamber-
lain to the Pope and held the Papal order of
Knight Grand Cross of St. Gregory the Great.
He was a Fellow of the Royal Australasian
College of Surgeons.
At Buenos Aires, Captain W. Dawson,
skipper of Shaw, Savill and Albion Co. s vessels
trading between Maoriland and Britain. JOin-
ing the co. 40 years ago, he commanded the
Otira, Akaroa and Tainui, and at the time or
his death, the Tamaroa, which carried thou-
sands of troops during the war.
At Timaru, M.L., at 73, Francis Joseph
Rolleston, Attorney-General and Minister ot
Justice and Defence in the Massey Admims-
tration. He represented Timaru from 19—
till 1928 and was Mayor of the town for seven
years.
In Adelaide, at 72, Israel Krantz, formerly a
leading storekeeper at Broken Hill. One so
is a doctor in Melbourne, another in Adelaide.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
The spring racing carnival will be
marked by functions which promise to
hit the high spots. Sir Winston and
Lady Dugan have issued invitations to a
ball on Cup night to meet the Duke and
Duchess of Gloucester, as this will be
their Royal Highnesses’ final visit to Mel-
bourne before returning to England.
Lady Murdoch, president of the Victoria
League, has already called a meeting to
discuss plans for the ball to be held on
November 1 (Derby eve) in the St. Kilda
Town Hall under the patronage of the
Governor, Sir Winston Dugan and Lady
Dugan. This will be the first ball held
by the league since 1937. Mrs. Leslie
Moran heads the sub-committee which
will be responsible for the decorations ;
Lady Gullett and Mrs. Russell Grim-
wade are in charge of supper arrange-
ments, and Mrs. Robert Hamilton and
Mrs. N. Hill are in charge of publicity.
Felicity Harrison is sharing the duty of
ticket secretary with Hazel Leonard.
Mrs. Guy Bakewell, who has done out-
standing work for the Victoria League,
is honorary secretary for the ball and
Frank Ellis is honorary treasurer. Tickets,
one guinea each.
In brilliant sunshine the Archbishop of
Melbourne and Mrs. Booth' and the
Council of the Archdiocese entertained
1400 guests at a garden party in the lovely
grounds of “Bishopscourt.” Guests had
an opportunity of seeing the sturdy blue
stone building which has housed the
head of the Anglican church since Mel-
bourne was raised to the status of a city.
The Archbishop and Mrs. Booth were
assisted in dispensing hospitality by their
three daughters, Joan, Margaret and Pat.
In the official party were the Lieut.-
Governor, Sir Edmund Herring, who was
accompanied by Lady Herring, the
Lord Mayor, Councillor Ray Connelly,
the Dean of Melbourne and Mrs.
Langley, Advocate of the Diocese and
Mrs. Rigby.
Wandering around greeting friends
were Prof. W. E. Agar and his wife, the
latter wearing a navy-blue suit with gold
ornaments and small matching hat. With
Commander Buchanan, R.A.N., was Mrs.
Buchanan, her ensemble of lime-green
wool featuring the new waist-length cape.
With her father was Mary Cooper, who
chose a grey tailored suit with pastel-
blue blouse and a halo of pastel flowers.
Wife of Air Vice-Marshal Jones wore
all-blue outfit with a small floral hat;
Mrs. Claude Couchman donned a frock
of leaf brown and a matching hat. A
picturesque figure was the Moderator of
the Presbyterian Church, Rev. C. J.
Riddle, in knee breeches, silk stockings,
buckled shoon and frills of lace falling
from the sleeves of his cut-away coat.
Jill Lambert, sun-tanned after her holi-
day in Brisbane, returned just in time for
husband Raymond’s recital in the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. The pianist, who is
chief study teacher at the Melbourne
Conservatorium and a member of the
University Examiners’ Board, has acted
as accompanist for Marjorie Lawrence
and Joan Hammond, and will shortly
leave for Maoriland to accompany Joan
Hammond on her tour. Jill is the only
daughter of Mrs. T. J. Ryan ; her late
father was for some years Premier of
Queensland. The Lamberts have three
children, and all show musical talent.
The gala opening of the French
Fashion Show held in the Myer Mural
Hall was the highlight of the week’s
doings. Although the clothes worn by
the visiting mannequins were breath-
taking in their loveliness, there was plenty
of competition from the women guests,
who cheerfully paid up their two guineas
to help the work of the Queen Victoria
Hospital. Almost beating Carole, Nicole,
Pacquerette and Monique at their own
game were the lovely youngsters seen at
the show. Shirley Watts’s deep burgundy
satin gown had the skirt corded at the
waistline to make it more bouffant, while
Gloria Myslis’s gown of eau de nil crepe
was made shirtmaker fashion with gold
buttons and belt; she wore matching
suede gloves.
President of the Q.V. Hospital,
Lady Brookes, was an arresting
figure in gleaming oyster-grey satin and
ropes of pearls, while Mrs. R. H. Hamer,
secretary for the committee, chose a pat-
terned frock of green and black on a
white satin ground. Keeping a watchful
eye on her younger set, who did the
ushering, Mrs. Wallace Mitchejl wore a
long flowing cape of hyacinth blue crepe,
heavily embroidered in white beads at
the shoulders, over her white sunray-
pleated gown. Valda Normoyle, of Syd-
ney, was in white with touches of blue
embroidery; Dorothy Fraser wore a
white fox cape over her white gown ; Mrs.
John Langley, just back from England.
chose a black gown and three-quarter-
length ermine coat; she was with her
sister, Lady Gengoult Smith, also in a
black ensemble.
This portrait by S. A. Gray is of
Angela Fink, daughter of Mrs. Doris
Fink, of Domain-road, South Yarra. For
three weeks from next Saturday she will
be the gentle Susu, serving maid to Shen
Lo, in the world premiere of Australian
Russell Oakes’s Chinese play, “Enduring
as the Camphor Tree,” which will be
presented at the Little Theatre. Angela
is one of the busiest young women in
this city. Not only has she an interesting
job with the Kodak Company, and is re-
hearsing for the play, but every Satur-
day morning she attends at the library
she herself organised at the Children’s
Hospital for the children at the Rheu-
matic Heart Clinic. Angela began this
good work almost a year ago, and enjoys
every minute of it, because she loves
books and children. Angela belongs to
a public-spirited family; her mother is a
life member of the Children’s Hospital
Board and drives for the R.A.C.V. Sister
Meryl, who is M*s. Eddie Cohen, was a
captain in the A.W.A.S. during the war.
A happy party was given by the
R.S.S.A.I.L.A. in the Returned Nurses’
clubrooms at Anzac House to say “thank
you” to Miss Lola Luxford, who was the
founder of the famous Anzac Club in
New York. It was originally started in
her own apartment in 1941, when a
group of Miss Luxford’s friends gathered
to entertain Australians. Before it closed
25,000 Australians had passed through
the club. Miss Luxford and her friends
arranged theatre and night-dub visits for
them as well as sight-seeing tours. The
guest-of-honor was attractive in a slimly-
cut black wool frock which was worn
with an amber-toned jacket in which she
pinned a spray of cream tulips; her
natural-straw Breton sailor hat was
finished with loops of ribbon and veil-
ing. Miss Luxford was received by the
senior vice-president, Mr. N. D. Wilson.
Other speakers who expressed gratitude
for the work she had done included Air
Minister Drakeford and Air Vice-
Marshal Goble. Mrs. Drakeford sported a
small toque of chartreuse corded ribbon
with her grey pin-striped suit; Mrs. Roy
Chambers chose a midnight-blue en-
semble with wine-toned accessories.
Matron-in-Chief of the R.A.A.F, Nurs-
ing Service, Miss M, I. Lang, Dr. New-
man Morris, chairman of the Australian
Red Cross, and Consul-General for the
U.S.A., Richard Boyce, were others who
extended the glad hand. Miss Luxford
is on her way to Maoriland to visit her
mother, Mrs. Adelaide Luxford, at
Hawkes Bay.
Good wishes have been showered on
Joan, younger daughter of Mrs. Finn, of
Toorak, and the late Dr. C. N. Finn, since
she announced her engagement to Capt.
Geoffrey Ryan, A.A.M.C., only son of
Mr. H. P. Ryan, of Elwood, and the
late Mrs. Ryan. Joan’s fiancd is attached
to the Heidelberg Military Hospital. Joan
and her sister Paddy have been in the
Department of Munitions for some years.
Engagement party is awaiting the return
of Patricia, sister of Geoffrey, from a
holiday at Kosciusko.
From Sydney
The Governor of New South Wales
and Mrs. Northcott have promised to be
present at the ball of the A.A.M.W.S. on
October 24, in the Trocadero. As well as
making this a great financial success for
Legacy, the A.A.M.W.S. want to make it
a grand reunion of people who are out
of the Service, and those who are still
serving. It is named A.A.M.W.S. Victory
Ball.
The flowers that bloom in the spring
smiled from all the sarden borders at
Randwick last Saturday, and all the
flowers that have ever bloomed in Nature
or in the milliner’s window bordered, fes-
tooned, or, like Cortez, silent upon his
peak in Darien, stood at gaze upon the
women’s hats. Thousands of Sydney
women seem still to be in the coupons,
judging by the dress parade on Derby
Day. Trig tailored suits (and you know
how they make the little pink book look),
tailored coats cuddling fresh as paint, silk
frocks, silver fox capes, and the object
that last year seemed as extinct as the
dodo —the umbrella—squirmed, wriggled,
pushed between stands and ring, posed
prettily for the press photographer, or just
stood in idleness waiting for “the dinkum
oil.”
Governor of New South Wales, Lieut-
General John Northcott, Mrs. Northcott
and daughter Elizabeth were at the meet-
ing. In the Government House group
were the L. A. Robbs, Sheila Collett and
Captain Tony Findlay. Mrs. Northcott’s
black frock was caped in silver fox. Miss
Northcott’s suit was in one of the shades
of misty blues so popular this season.
Greeny yellows and reds were recurrent
color notes. A few plastic shoes dared the
weather, and bare legs were rare.
The sky was the only dull thing about
the meeting. Lucky ones had just sim-
mered down after the excitement of col-
lecting £5 10s. for five bob place invest-
ment on Gold Caste when there was the
blood-pressure-raising moment of Shan-
non’s near-win after his bad start in the'
Epsom. And if you couldn’t get into the
lunchrooms or the public oyster (and what
is a public oyster? The family is
generally quoted as silent and retiring)
bar, you needn’t have gone hungry ; there
were hot dogs to eat alfresco.
Pretty and pictorial Sue Other
Gee’s highcrowned postillion hat in
black exotic straw had its ostrich
plume sweeping across the back of the
crown to end on the right shoulder.' With
this went a trigly-tailored * black coat.
Mrs. Bill Adams was very attractive in a
yellow-and-brown printed silk frock,
bolero style. Her small hat worn off the
face had flowers in the same toning. Mrs.
George Hill’s wide black hat was a souffle
of pink chiffon knotted with narrow
ribbon velvet, Mrs. Keith Morris’s
petunia-shaded straw hat was ruched
about the crown with blue-grey tulle.
Sheelagh Cassidy and Joan Allen were in
the picture. Sheelagh’s hat cascaded with
greeny-grey hollyhocks, and her printed
silk frock had a mink coat for company.
Tall and fair Joan wore a sort of beret
effect in pink and white candy-striped silk
that was a colorful finish to her blue-grey
suit.
Mrs. Ernest Watt’s hutsman’s red coat
was a bright splash. Her large black hat
was shovel shape and tied up with yards
of black veiling. With her peri-
winkle-blue suit Mrs, W. Parsons
wore a shell-pink ostrich-feather hat.
Accompanying her were daughter
Mrs. Adair and Melbourne visitor
Kathleen Anderson. Wives of four
doctors seen together were Mrs. George
Duncan, Mrs. Honner, Mrs. Maxwell and
Mrs. J. Coen. Mrs. Alec McLeod and
Wendy Playfair were two smart sisters.
Mrs. Alan Potter and Diana Scott-Waine
flashed .shades of red. A red rose caught
centre front of Marie Fagan’s smooth
brow was trimming to her off-the-face little
hat. Mrs. Millard Hagon’s beige suit was
a swirl of fine pleats and Mrs. Shierlaw’s
large and unusual hat was of striped silk.
Everybody knows the Mervyn Finlays
of Drummoyne. The gardens of their
home, Brackley House, are famed for their
lovely blooms; father is one of Sydney’s
best-known legal men, and daughter
Barbara earned a commission for herself
in the war years, becoming Captain
Barbara Finlay of the A.A.M;W.S. in
charge of occupational therapy, first in
Goulburn, then South Australia and now
at 113th A.G.H. Now Barbara has an-
nounced her engagement to Lt.-Col.
Robert Alan Campbell Muir, of Mel-
bourne. The colonel served in the Middle
East and New Guinea and has recently
relinquished his command in the North
Celebes. Before the war he was military
A.D.C, to the former Governor of
Queensland, Sir Leslie Wilson. Norton

Last week Sydney theatregoers of 40
or so years ago turned back their
memories to those gala first nights of
lace and feathers and real silk and satin.
News of the death of Mrs. Jimmy
Osborne at Gundaroo reminded of the
nights when as the radiant and lovely
Maud Jeffries she held Sydney en-
thralled at Her Majesty’s with romantic
plays such as “Resurrection,” “Monsieur
Beaucaire” and “The Eternal City.” It
was while in this company she met her
husband, who, one of Australia’s best-
known society beaux, was a good enough
actor to play on the professional stage.
After her marriage Mrs. Osborne
was rarely seen in city ways. She en-
joyed country life, delighted in her gar-
den, and grew glorious roses. Miss
Jeffries first came to Sydney with Wilson
Barrett, and after nearly 50 years her
charm still lingers with those fortunate
enough to have seen her.
In a pool of white light the Queens-
land State String Quartet grouped about
the piano at whiclvHephzibah Menuhin
sat and played with the greatness which
has been hers since childhood. The
programme to which a thoroughly
musical audience listened with close atten-
tion was on the heights; Brahms Quintet
in F Minor, the F Minor of Cesar
Franck and Dvorak’s Quintet in
A Major—real musicians’ fare. The
men of the quartet are first violin Ernest
Llewellyn, second violin Harold Taberner,
’cellist Don Howley and viola player
David Powell. The second concert of
this chamber music group was on the
same high plane as the first.
For the opening concert the pianist
dressed her slender prettiness in white.
The skirt was full and flowing, the tight
little bodice finished with a black velvet
ribbon. Her fair hair brushed back from
her forehead fell shining to her shoulders.
Hephzibah, who is Mrs. Lindsay Nicholas,
is staying at the Wentworth with small
son Kronrad. Mr. Nicholas and other
son Marston came to Sydney during the
week-end.
A diverting sight at the “Spring
Frivolity” at the White City Clubhouse
on October 9 will be the serving of their
favorite dishes by Dr. Laborinho (Consul
for Portugal), Neville Harding (former
Lord Mayor), Mr. V. Raghven
(Assistant Indian Trade Commissioner),
Dr. George Mackaness, Reg. Wil-
loughby, R. A. Broinowski, John
Smuts and Dr. Fleischman. The function
is the first public appeal made by the
Food for Babies Fund and Good Samari-
tan Association since the outbreak of
war.
A new tenor was introduced to Sydney
at the Royal Art Society’s at-home, last
week. He is Paul Miskell, the quality of
his voice is magnolia-smooth, and he is 19.
Ron Jackson, well known to radio
listeners, raised his baritone, and Sonja
Hanke, a very young daughter* of the
portrait painter, showed her paces as
a pianist. There was a male quartet
who finished up a rousing perform-
ance by singing “Waltzing Matilda.”
Artist Nevil-Smith proved himself all
things to all men and played accom-
paniments for everyone. John Frith
did lightning sketches. President Erik
Langker and his smiling wife wel-
comed the guests. It wasn’t one of these
“Won’t go home till morning” affairs.
There was coffee and a general exodus
before 11. Solicitor Aubrey Halloran
announced the winner of the Wynne
prize.
The second annual ball of the New
Zealand Club of Sydney, will be held in
the Sydney Town Hall on October 16,
and on this occasion the president, Mrs.
E. Hempton as Matron of Honor, will
present a! number of debutantes to Mr.
Barclay, High Commissioner for New
Zealand in Australia, and Mrs. Barclay.
The proceeds from this function will help
to furnish and equip the R.A.A.F.
Memorial Centre.

That
Miserable Minority
Although nearly 500,000 more votes were
cast in this election, Communists polled
thousands less than in 1943.
Yet this miserable minority not
per cent, of the total vote has, by its
control of executive positions in certain
trade unions, destroyed our markets in
the Netherlands Indies, threatened our
trade with China and Malaya and deprived
Australian industry of £30,000,000 of
export orders.
The vote of confidence in the present
Government signifies the people’s approval
of the campaign that Labor has conducted
against the Communists within the unions.
The public also welcomes the recent defeats
of Communist officials in trade unions as
a definite step towards industrial peace.
Now, the lifting of the ban that still
threatens our export trade would he a sub-
stantial contribution to full employment in
the future.

War merely interrupted development of
the big chain organisations, of which
Coles is the oldest and largest in the Com-
monwealth —it has 80-odd branches, of
which over 70 are in N. S. Wales ‘and
Victoria. And the general economic back-
ground of “full” employment and the
swelling volume of merchandise are en-
couragement for them to keep on expand-
ing.
Last term Coles bought two large
properties, one in Perth and the other in
Melbourne. Portion of the Perth premises
has been occupied by the co. as its main
store in W.A. since 1932 ; the Melbourne
purchase comprises a three-storeyed build-
ing fronting Queen- and Little Lonsdale-
streets. Also plans for rebuilding and/or
refitting many of the co.’s stores, includ-
ing the ones at Brisbane and Perth, are
to be proceeded with when official sanc-
tion is obtained and labor and materials
become available. A new link was forged
into the chain at Castlemaine (Vic.) just
before the close of last accounts, and the
branch at Albany (W.A.), which has been
closed for four years owing to stock and
transport difficulties, is soon to be re-
opened.
To finance this programme, and carry
more higher-priced stock, shareholders
will be asked to assist. The amount,
nature and terms of the new issue, per-
mission for which has been deferred by
the Capital Control Board, have not yet
been announced. The last issue of scrip,
215,250 £1 ords. in 1939, was at par. It
lifted paid capital to the present figure
of £1,441,515 in 150,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 1,291,515 ords. The market heavily
discounts its prospects by pricing the
ords. at 84s. or thereabouts. The investor
at 84s. who looks for only 3.5 p.c. on his
money counts on a one-for-three new
issue of ords. at par.—it would bring in
£433,838—and the div. remaining at I'2 p.c.
When the books closed finances were
in good trim:

The year’s addition of £196,506 to free-
holds reflects the property purchases al-
ready referred to. To meet the outlay,
wipe out the overdraft (£92,387 at previ-
ous balance) and strengthen cash, etc.,
by £140,891 the board went outside for
an extra £170,022, of which £100,631 was
raised on mortgage. The reduction of
£95,880 in stocks is a reminder of the
current shortage of goods. The contrac-
tion in the more or less liquid surplus
(£455,738) was only £78,462.
Last term all the co.’s stores reported
steady improvement in sales over the
whole trading period. On the average
sales are now about 30 p.c. above the
1939 level. Demand still runs ahead of
supply for many lines, some of which
have been sold within a few hours, and
sometimes minutes, after they were placed
on the counters. Lines still in short
supply are clothing, underwear, stationery
and paper products. Ample deliveries of
locally-produced toilet goods and arti-
ficial jewellery are reported, while hard-
ware, .glassware, confectionery and toys
are coming forward in increasing Volume,
and so are lines imported from Britain.
The spring in last term’s net earnings
was £30,655. That was after setting aside
whatever was considered necessary for
taxation, allowing £80,857 (down £13,088)
for depreciation, and includes £25,548
(approx, same as previous year) added to
property depreciation reserve (now
£299,998). The £227,520- of profit was
enough to pay the pref. div. and show
16.7 p.c. on ord. capital as against 14.3,
12.5, 12.6, 17.7, 16.9, 22.1 and 24.4 p.c.
back to 1939. A couple of points were
added to the div., making it 12 p.c. The
average distribution over the last five
years was 10.9 p.c., compared with an
average of 18 p.c. for the preceding quin-
quennium.
It needs to be remembered, however,
that the present demand for goods is
abnormal. Prospects of a substantial re-
duction in the present high level of taxa-
tion are not bright, while costs generally
are still rising, and the upswing may be-
come sharper before it begins to recede.
For one thing, the relatively lower-paid
dilutee war-time staffs have just been re-
placed by returned servicemen, whose
senior status calls for higher remunera-
tion. Still, the current year’s earnings
should be better than the one on whose
heels it treads.

Latest is the co.’s best showing for the
last 16 years, or since the borrow-and-
bust boom of the 1920’s faded out, and
slump was followed by a drift of the
shopping public from the Valley, where
McWhirters is, to the Queen-street end
of the city. The present spate of buying
is abnormal. It represents the immedi-
ate post-war rush of a market that has
been partly starved of goods for the last
half-dozen years, and which has plenty
of money in its pockets. And during
the war Brisbane retailers enjoyed a
stronger sellers’ market than did retailers
in the southern capitals.
Here are percentage changes in aggre-
gate turnover of a dozen leading depart-
ment stores in Brisbane, compared with the
corresponding period of the previousyear:

1944- . . + 7.6 +lO.O + 1.0 0.3 + 4.5
1945- .. +15.8 +25.2 +24.3
On the basis of these figures turnover
for the first three quarters of 1945-46
was about 73 p.c. above the 1938-39
level. The lift is due partly to higher
prices. Merchandise, including imports,
continues to come forward in increasing
quantities, though supplies are still far
short of their full volume.
Last term the spring in the co.’s gross
earnings (£309,039) was £50,340. After
setting aside £70,000 (up £10,000) for
the taxgatherer and allowing £10,992 (up
£534) for depreciation, exes. (£237,616)
took £44,196 of the gain. That left the
net result £6144 stronger at £71,423, or
13.9 p.c. on capital as against 11.8, 10.5,
9.4, 7.4, 6.3, 6.7 and 5.8 p.c. back to
1939. The div. was kept at 1\ p.c,, and
the prop for capital was strengthened by
£30,173, making it £227,188, or twice
as strong as it was a decade ago.
Exactly how long the buying wave can
be expected to retain its present strength
remains to be seen. Demobilisation, now
nearing completion, has been responsible
for much of this strength. Still, the lag
in building favors maintenance of a
strong demand for all descriptions of
household furnishings and equipment,
and the general background of “full”
employment and a more generous supply
of merchandise is also encouraging so
far as retail turnovers are concerned. On
the other hand, as demand eases and the
volume of goods increases competition
will get more of an edge on it, and at
the same time the upswing of costs
generally can be expected to sharpen,
while there is little prospect of any sub-
stantial relief from the heavy burden of
co. taxation.
Financially the co. is well equipped
to take immediate advantage of any
opportunity that offers, as the strong hold-
ing of cash, etc. (up £94,354), shows:
1940. 1942. 1945. 1946.
Paid capital.. £550,000 £550,000' £550,000 £550,000
Overdraft ~ 117,697 85,273
Creditors .. 33,837 33,667 34,319 65,886

Cash, invest-
ments, etc... 3,266 2,723 100,920 195,274
The drop of £21,960 in stocks last
term reflects the difficulty in obtaining
adequate supplies of merchandise. The
moderate level of book debts (up £10,884)
suggests that the year’s livelier turnover
was mainly on a cash basis. The more
or less liquid surplus (£408,005) was
£37,318 stronger than at the previous
balance.
At the ceiling price of 245. 6d. the f.-p.
pound shares, covered by 28s. 3d. in net
tangibles, return an attractive 6.1 p.c.
on a p.c. div. basis.

This co., put off the stocks at .Sydney
at the end of 1936, turns out standard
and high-grade axminster carpets from
locally-spun yarns which compare favor-
ably with the best imported carpets of
similar classification. Owing to slow
arrival of plant, full production was not
reached until 1940; meanwhile demand
had run ahead of output. But before
the co. could get properly into its stride,
war-time restrictions limited supplies of
both raw materials and output of carpets
and rugs for civilian purposes, and some
of the looms were switched to weaving
fabrics for defence purposes. For the
same purpose worsted-spinning plant was
borrowed from John Vicars and Co., and
returned about a year ago, when weaving
on defence account ceased.
Still, earnings have continued to ad-
vance. Shareholders got into the pic-
ture in 1940 with 5 p.c., and have had
annual distributions averaging 6.5 p.c.
since, with satisfactory margins. With
an eye To post-war development 190,729
new £1 ords. were issued and called to
2s. 6d. in December, 1944. That made
issued capital £300,000 in £1 shares, of
which £135,169 is in hand, leaving
£164,831 to come. The new money is
wanted for extension of the main
premises, including erection of a dye
house, and purchase of additional plant,
now on order. Official approval to go
ahead with building was recently re-
ceived, so it should not be long before
the balance of the uncalled capital is
asked for.
Although shortage of materials and
labor continued to hamper output, net
earnings stepped .up £3703 last term,
reaching £13,331, or 9.7 p.c. on paid
capital. That was after setting aside an
extra £2177 for the taxgatherer (£7478)
and allowing £3836 (up £400) for depre-
ciation. The div. was lifted from 6 p.c.
to 1\ p.c., and the £3348 that remained
reduced the amount of capital unrepre-
sented by tangible assets to £457. That
leaves out of the reckoning a depreciation
reserve of £30,618. A strong demand
awaits the co.’s products, and prospects
of a still better showing, especially after
the new plant is installed, are encourag-
ing. Much, of course, will depend upon
what happens in connection with costs,
mainly wages and hours.
Finances are in good trim:

£72,500 in 10s. shares), which is treat-
ing the beach sands at Byron Bay
(N.S.W.), netted £19,731 ( = 27.2 p.c.) for
the year to June 30 last. This compares
with profits of £14,489 and £622 for the
two preceding years. Shareholders get
10 p.c., same as for previous term. When
the books closed cash, Government secu-
rities, stores, etc., totalled £52,836. In-
cluding the div., liabilities amounted to
£13,109. Property, plant, etc., figures at
£60,988. A statistical blackout is main-
tained over treatment and recovery
figures. Capital expenditure during the
year was over £14,000, mainly in con-
nection with new excavating equipment,
which is expected to work the sands
more efficiently at lower cost by produc-
tion of a higher-grade concentrate.

Roma North Oil Co. was formed in
Melbourne in 1932 to hunt for oil in the
Roma district (Q.), and it acquired shares
in cos, operating on the Roma field and
at Lakes Entrance (Vic,). Attention was
soon switched to gold, and for some years
before the war the co. was prospecting
leases adjoining Golden Plateau, at Cra-
cow (Q.), Here insufficient ore was dis-
closed to warrant installation of a treat-
ment plant. Now the co, has accepted a
cash offer of £7500 from Golden Plateau
for its Cracow assets, and should, the
board says, “again become interested in
the object for which it was formed.”
Hopes are that prospecting for oil on the
Roma field will soon be resumed, this
time by the Federal Government. The
co.’s 10s. shares recently sold at Bd, each.

The end of the old Briseis mine, at
Derby, Tas. (B. 25/9/’46), has been
hastened by recent falls of overburden
and drift .which submerged the drainage
pump and some elevators, A gravel pump
and some other plant have been salvaged,
but there is now only about six months’
work ahead, which is expected to yield
not more than 100 tons t.o. Meanwhile,
mine assets are to be sold, if suitable
prices can be obtained. The mining area
in Malaya to which Briseis’s activities are
to be transferred has not yet been con-
solidated.

North Kalgurli, Ltd., treated 108,423
tons ore last year for 22,68 loz, fine gold.
Throughput showed an increase of 17,000
tons and the yield 43120 z. on that for
the year before. Mining costs were
12s. lOd. a ton (up 2d.), treatment
12s. lOd. (up 4d.). Net profit was
£60,348. Dividend of Is. 3d. absorbed
£37,812, Principal development during
the year was on the eastern side of
Nos. 2,5, 6 and 8 levels of the North
Kalgurli block, and at various levels in
the Kalgurli holding, where at No. 14
level ore averaging 12.5dwt. over a width
of lift, and length of 122 ft. was opened-
up ; and at No. 10 level 7.sdwt. ore over
a width of 6ft. and length of 232 ft. was
exposed. In another part of the same
holding a drive on the Australia East
lode opened up B.sdwt. ore for a length
of 103 ft. over the unusual width of 23ft.
Capital expenditure over the next few
years is likely to be on a larger scale
to make up for backwardness of war-
time development. The main haulage
channel is to be transferred from the
North Kalgurli to the deeper Kalgurli
shaft. This changeover is expected to
cheapen handling of increased ton-
nages,

“O.B.”: At Blue Spec, Pilbara field
(W.A.), development during the eight
months to end August last is claimed to
have given valuable information and to
have suggested adoption of a vigorous
working policy. Something is said about
ore widths, head values, good antimony
and improved pyritic concentrates and a
little is added about costs. Shareholders
would like to know more about metallur-
gical problems, total quantity of gold
banked, and what prospects there are of
earning more than interest and amortisa-
tion charges on the Government debt
will call for.

ward, and on which the co. holds an
option. Preliminary drilling to a vertical
depth of 800 ft. has shown “encouraging
results,” indicating that a large tonnage

“Goldie”;
About converting an old car engine to air
compressor (B. 4/9/’46), I recently took a
15 h.p. motor to a machine shop to be made
up, and the engineer had some good ideas on
the subject. After converting to two-stroke,
he made use of his welding plant to fill up
the depression in the cylinder head, leaving
just enough space to allow the inlet and exhaust
valves to rise fully. Then he built up the
tappet shaft to open the inlet valves all the
way on the downstrokes; the exhaust valves
open when the upstrokes are half the dis-
tance, and close when the pistons reach point
of balance. This compressor delivers 80 to
90 cu. ft. free air a minute, a handy size for
a single jackhammer of the right type. The
engineer informed me that he made up a
T-model engine to drive on two cylinders,
while the other pair compressed air, but a
large receiver was necessary. Incidentally, the
’hammer we use is a wet type, around 451 b.,
and we favor using a decent rig for stoping
and driving. A suitable and inexpensive plant
for working a small mine has always been
difficult to obtain. Cost of a brand-new outfit
would be prohibitive to prospectors in many
instances.
Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN, SIR NORMAN
E. BROOKES. TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF AUS-
TRALIAN PAPER MANUFACTURERS LIMITED
AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING HELD
ON 30th SEPTEMBER, 1946.
It is most interesting to study the develop-
ments of our Company which are, to a con-
siderable extent, an index of Australia s indus-
trial progress. .
In 1930 our total annual production ot
boards and papers was 39,000 tons. In the
year preceding the outbreak of war this had
risen to 92,000 tons and in the year under review
our corresponding production was 112,500 tons.
We reached a peak in 1942 of 131,000 tons.
Over and above our production of boards
and papers we made 3)3,670 tons of pulp dur-
ing the past year at Maryvale.
During the same 16-year period the costs of
our basic raw materials have been rising steadily.
For example, coal in 1930 cost in New South
Wales 19s. 9d. a ton as compared with 355. Id.
today, and corresponding figures for Victoria
increased from 265. Bd. to 445. lOd. Imported
kraft pulp has risen from £ll ss. a ton to £33
and may even go higher.
Whilst the broad outlines of post-war world
affairs are still unclear, your Board feels that
the courage and initiative which the Allies,
including Australia, displayed during the war,
and particularly during that period when the
clouds of disaster rose on our horizon, must be
continued and intensified. We must have faith
that commonsense and compromise will prevail
in spite of the present out-of-balance position
between the rapid increase in scientific know-
ledge and the use of this knowledge for the
benefit of mankind.
Progress is dynamic. To endeavor to remain
static means an inevitable retrogression and a
loss of our ability to contribute to the com-
mon fund of well-being.
RAW MATERIALS.
After the surrender of Germany and the
consequent reopening of the Baltic Sea, we
were able to obtain certain tonnages of pulp
from Scandinavian countries, particularly
Sweden. These countries are struggling under
difficult production conditions, largely owing to
the shortage of coal. We are thankful that" we
have been able to obtain our minimum require-
ments of chemical pulps so far, although at
very much higher prices than pre-war. We
are now drawing smaller quantities from North
America following the cessation of Lend-Lease
and Mutual Aid which provided such valued
help during the war years.
With the increased consumption of newsprint'
by the newspaper companies of Australia and
the almost complete cessation of export pack-
aging overseas for the fighting services, our
collections of waste paper have improved.
PRODUCTION.
As you will note from the Directors’ Report,
our total output of paper and paper board was
less than in some previous years, mainly owing
to the grave difficulties that we have experi-
enced because of the shortage of coal and also
partly because of several unfortunate outside
industrial disputes.
The main trouble has been in our Victorian
Mills’, and particularly at Fairfield, Melbourne
and Broadford. You will realise the nightmare
that the managements have endured when I tell
you that for over three months now the coal
requirements of these three mills have been
unsupplied except for a period of three days.
This has necessitated the use of partially dry
firewood, such sawdust as we could purchase,
and fuel oil, at heavy extra cost and much extra
labor.
Meanwhile, after thorough investigation we
have decided that we must make ourselves as
independent as possible of black coal from
Nefr South Wales. We have purchased a large
interest in an area near Bacchus Marsh, and
are engaged in the urgent removal of over-
burden with a consequent development of an
open-cut mine for the winning of raw brown
coal. We expect to obtain some relief before
the end of this year, and complete relief by
the middle of 1947.
DEVELOPMENT.
Last year we gave you an enumeration of
the first stage of large-scale additions to our
plant.
We added that improvements are also being
made to several of our machines in order to
provide maximum production from existing
plant.
Subject to the difficulties inherent in the
present position in the supply of structural
materials and of skilled staff and men, this
programme is proceeding urgently.
As the picture of the post-war unfolds, we
are adjusting our programme accordingly. For
example, we have now decided to erect another
paper machine at our Maryvale Mill to meet
the increasing demands for certain types of
paper mainly in the southern States of the
Commonwealth.
Last November we announced officially in
Brisbane that the Company was investigating
the economics of the erection of a board
machine to supply Queensland requirements.
These investigations are nearly completed and
a further announcement will be made at an
early date.
Our continuous survey of possible and prob-
able developments has shown clearly that' large
extensions in the use of some of our products
are certain to occur as soon as_ sufficient sup-
plies of paper and board are available.
In addition to playing our part in the
provision of the extra paper and board re-
quirements for these extensions and new de-
velopments we have decided in conjunction
with other interests to help in the development
of the further use of these products.
Your Board is fully cognizant of the in-
creased capital cost involved as compared with
1930-39. As implied in the earlier part of this
address, it is almost a truism when one says
that a world,,war inevitably means inflation
and higher costs, as defined by currency units.
Your Board has decided after all necessary
thought and consultation that its programme
of progressive development is amply justified.
RESEARCH.
We are increasing the research facilities and
the number of men engaged on this work. We
appreciate that research cannot be confined to
what are known generally as the physical
sciences, such as chemistry, physics and metal-
lurgy. Research into the social sciences, into
the relations between man and man, into all
that appertains to the creation of better under-
standing between all those engaged in industry
is just as vital as —if not more so than—research
in subjects within the scope of the material
sciences.
PERSONNEL.
The total number of the staff and employees
of your Company is now approximately 4300.
About 1000 of those employed left the Com-
pany’s service to join the fighting forces. Many
have already rejoined our service. We have
done our best to welcome them back and to
help them towards readjustment quickly and
satisfactorily. A number of other returned
men have joined us, and we have welcomed
them also.
With our large construction programme, we
shall be giving employment directly and in-
directly to many more people.
FINANCIAL.
(a) The Year’s Results.-— The net profit for
the year was £227,312, after providing income
tax of £190,732. Depreciation and amortisation
of buildings and equipment amounted to
£341,184; this includes an amount for the
amortisation of special equipment installed to
meet war-time requirements, and also for the
writing down of buildings, plant and equip-
ment installed at high cost during the war
period.
The profit for the year is substantially less
than in 1944-45. The fundamental reason is
that w-e were unable to produce as much as in
the previous year for reasons explained earlier.
(b) Price Control— ln our comments under
this heading at last year’s Annual Meeting we
urged that there should be a removal of price
control in some directions, but that protection
should be accorded to the wage earner so that
he should not pay increased prices for his
necessities. We referred particularly to the
black markets, aifd to the dishonest outlook
which some members of the community had
adopted as a result of price control.
I would mention one other point which is
serious and detrimental to Australia’s future,
namely, that price control tends definitely to a
reduction of efficiency by the removal of incen-
tive. From our own experience we can say
quite specifically that one of the most difficult
things that we have had to do under price
control is to prevent the growth of the attitude
of mind that costs do not matter because prices
and/or profits are fixed.
We offer the fullest co-operation with the
Government in a rapid exhaustive review to see
how far these serious effects on the economic
life of Australia can be reduced.
(c) Post-War Finance.—At last year’s Annual
Meeting we mentioned that the issue of deben-
tures by this Company was the first step only
in connection with the financing of our post-
war programme of expansion. Shareholders
have received notice of a special meeting to
be held immediately after the close of this
Annual Meeting in order.to pass resolutions
approving of the increase in the nominal capital
of the Company from £4,600,000 to £10,000,000.
I have already made statements in the Press to
the effect that the Company has secured Gov-
ernment consent to this increase of the Com-
pany’s nominal capital.
POLICY.
Shareholders will be interested to know that
during the six years ended June, 1945 that is,
in the period covering the war —this Company
paid by way of income tax On profits the sum
of approximately £1,087,000, and this is exclu-
sive of several hundreds of thousands of pounds
paid in Pay Roll, Sales and Land Taxes.
We must not forget that the dividends paid
by this Company are again taxed in the hands
of the recipients.
It was essential for the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment during the war period to raise large
sums of money to meet wartime requirements,
but now that the war is over it must surely
be possible for the levels of Company taxation
to be substantially reduced. This is one of
the important directions in which industry can
be assisted in meeting post-war conditions
generally and in planning its developmental
work.
I cannot do better than repeat what was
said last year;
“Excessive taxation is also inconsistent with
an inventive, robust private enterprise assist-
ing, in a maximum degree, to the provision
of full employment. It destroys the essential
driving urge to achievement on the part
both of employers and employees, and
makes difficult the continuous overhaul and
improvement of machines and technical
equipment, without which Australia will be
unable to keep in the van of industrial
progress.”

SUNDRY DHOWS
AN OUTSTANDING PLAY.
In the last four or five years Sydney
has had an abundance of lightweight
plays, and it has been left to the “little”
theatres to provide fare with some sub-
stance. The “little” theatres are inclined
to stick to Shakspeare, Shaw and Ibsen,
which is good within limits. But it is no
impertinence to Shakspeare to say that
if the theatre is to remain alive —“flesh
and blood” in the real sense —some
variety is needed. The best plays, old,
new, native and imported, should be
asserted as often as possible.
Recently there have been promising
signs. Sydney Mercury Theatre presented
plays by Gogol, Lope de Vega and Von
Kleist; Strindberg’s “A Dream Play”
was recently put on by the Independent
Theatre ; and the Metropolitan Theatre
is now showing Molnar’s “Liliom” at St.
Peter’s Hall.
Produced by May Hollinworth, the
acting is of a high standard throughout,
and the direction is intelligent. And the
play itself is important —a skilful com-
position of fantasy, humor, pathos and
realistic perception blended with rare
art.
Entitled “a legend in seven scenes and
a prologue,” “Liliom” is the story of a
disreputable Hungarian “barker and
bouncer” who marries a servant girl, for-
sakes his dubious profession, ill-treats his
wife and sponges on her relations, drifts
into serious crime and then suicides to
escape arrest. The same story has been
told many times. But Molnar tells it with
a simplicity which is disarming and mis-
leading—for it veils a quiet art.
Each scene, in its way, is a little gem.
Liliom’s wife, Julie, confessing her love
to Liliom after he is dead; Liliom
rudely repulsing the offer of Mrs. Muskat,
his erstwhile employer and mistress, when
he hears that he is to become a father.
although he has been about to go back
to her a moment before ; then, left alone,
shouting the news out into the night;
Liliom and Ficsur, lying in wait for a
robbery and gambling for their prospec-
tive spoils ; the policeman discussing nay
and conditions while Liliom lies on the
point of death; and, finally, the fantasy
at the end.
Molnar’s use of fantasy has his con-
temporaries puzzled, and for a time
“Liliom” —the best of his plays—was
under a cloud. After the death of
Liliom Molnar transports him to a kind
of qnte-room to heaven, a transportation
foreshadowed by a conversation between
Liliom and Ficsur, the criminal.
They are discussing the possibilities of
murder, and Liliom says “In the next
world —when I come up before the Lord
God —what’ll I say then?”
Ficsur: The likes of you will never
come up before Him.
Liliom: Why not?
Ficsur; Have you ever come up before
the high court?
Liliom: No.
Ficsur: Our kind comes up before the
police magistrate—and the highest we ever
get is the criminal court.
And sure enough, when Liliom dies,
he finds himself arrested by heavenly
policemen, facing a celfestial police
magistrate. But the fantasy is interest-
ing not only for its own sake but in the
impact of the fantasy on the story itself.
There is a clarification of the issues:,
pathos, sentiment and realism. Liliom
remains, in many respects, Liliom.
David Cahill took the part of Liliom,
and played it very well. At the first night
at St. Peter’s Hall the lighting was some-
what sombre, striking in itself but ob-
scuring the actor’s personality. At a
special preview the hall was smaller and
more was seen of him. As an actor
Cahill can stand the limelight. Julie was
played by Lynn Murphy with a quiet
dignity, naturalness and restraint, A fea-
ture of the play is the number of excel-
lent minor characters. Marie, Julie’s
friend, was charmingly played by Lola
Sweeney, though she was probably meant
to be more lumpy and stupid—a clown.
Her admirer, Wolf Berkowitz, brought a
brilliant character study by Kevin
Brennan. Frederica Shaw, as Mrs, Mus-
cat, improved as she went along. And
the criminal Ficsur was • excellently-
played by David Saxby. Ficsur, slightly
drawn as he is, is an excellent specimen
of his type. Ugly, slouching, almost half-
witted, but dangerous. His bon mot —
usually addressed to some respectable per-
son, “I don’t want to talk to you ; you’re
too common”—places him, almost auto-
matically, as a clown. And his deadliness
is revealed dramatically latqr.
It is really staggering to see a play of
this quality in a tiny hall at Darlinghurst
while the big professional theatres show
only trivial and meaningless potboilers.
There is no question as to where the
better entertainment is to be found.
Two Quintet Concerts.
The two concerts given by Hephzibah
Menuhin and the Queensland State
Quartet afforded sharp contrasts in styles
and treatment. The first was devoted to
the quintet for piano and strings in F
Minor, by Brahms, the Cesar Franck
F Minor and the Dvorak A Flat Major—
all of them by composers cast in the
school of classical romanticism. The
Brahms work combines poesy and drama
and obviously bears the influence of
Brahms’s idol, Beethoven; Franck’s
quintet is a lovely example of ensemble
writing, calm and almost devotional;
Dvorak’s work is a product of the com-
poser’s introduction to American Indian
music. Miss Menuhin always had the
keyboard under perfect control and the
strings under Ernest Llewellyn were more
than satisfactory.
The second concert was devoted to
works of modern composers: the quin-
tet of the Hungarian Dohnanyi, sensuous
and delicate; of Ernest Bloch, volatile
and strongly Hebraic in character with a
beautiful middle andante movement;
and Elgar’s little-heard work, the essence
of refinement and scholarliness. Each
piece was treated on its merits, but the
five players did their best work in cap-
turing in turn the serenity and the high
dramatic sequences in the Elgar work.
A Schramm Recital.
In his recital at the Sydney Town Hall
Paul Schramm proved that he was
equipped at all points to deal with Beeth-
oven’s Sonata in F Minor (the Appas-
sionata). He missed nothing—the emo-
tional storm of the beginning, the peace-
ful middle movement and the passionate
climax. Liszt’s “Ricordanza,” “St.
Francis Walking the Waves” —the latter
legend effectively suggesting the power
and surge of the sea —and some Chopin
short pieces that everybody knows and
loves rounded off as attractive a one-
man concert as has been heard in Sydney
for many a moon.
Rupert Bunny.
At 82, Rupert Bunny has had the dis-
tinction of being accorded an exhibition
of his life’s work in his own lifetime by
the Victorian National Gallery.
There is a nostalgic effect about one
section, which dates from the period when
the artist came under the influence of
the French impressionists—the results
were hung in Sydney in 1924. They
were all French landscapes seen from
unusual angles and in strange and livid
colors, which came much more natur-
ally from the subject matter than in most
of Bunny’s paintings. The artist had
momentarily abandoned his academic
training acquired under Folingsby at the
National Gallery in Melbourne and
under Jean Paul Laurens in Paris. It
shocked the local critics much more than
any modernist show of recent years and
they cried that Bunny had besmirched
art.
The pictures look innocuous enough
now, however, and they are far more
attractive than his huge ecclesiastical and
allegorical pictures with their looseness
of observation, or the portraits—particu-
larly the statuesque one of Melba which
is scarcely a living portrait of that vital
woman.
There is little of Runny in the exhibi-
tion ; there is no coherent line running
through it. He was a very susceptible
artist and there are evident suggestions of
David Davies or of Longstaff and
Phillips Fox —both were his fellow
students in his early days in Melbourne.
His nude woman with a rose is in the
authentic National Gallery tradition.
“Moonlight,” a view of a canal and
houses dimly seen in the twilight, is a
more original observation, as are
“Etaples” and jthe simple “Sea Weed
Harvest.”
* * * *
The decorative impressionism of John
Banks, shown in a Memorial Exhibition
of his paintings at the N. S. Wales
National Gallery, is best illustrated by his
Oriental pieces, such as “Tokyo”—a
charming piece of color blendiqg—and
an untitled study of three Japanese
women. With subjects nearer home the
artist’s technique seems to go astray. An
unconvincing surfing scene, dated 1937,
has a promising blue and white sky, but
a stretch of cold “painty” surf; “Sea
Symphony,” although better balanced, has
essentially the same faults. Instead of
perception and poetry. Banks seems to
have substituted decoration, and his hit-
or-miss method produced limited results.
His “hits,” at best, are striking, while his
“misses” run to such improbable land-
scapes as “Oval Opening,” a jarring com-
position of trees, patches of green and
multi-colored seas. , “Fisher Folk of
Holland,” with a fine gleaming wet street,
is much nearer the mark.

Les Turnbull’s oils and watercolors, at
Murdoch’s Art Salon, Sydney, are
mainly remarkable for their illustrative
qualities. There is a good deal of greasy
paint in the oils, but despite that disad-
vantage “Sketch from Lindisfarne, Tas-
mania,” has a striking water effect, blue in
the distance, then light-blue and white.
Another sea-piece, untitled, is remarkable
only for its crude coloring. On a large
canvas, the artist seems to find it hard
to sustain any intensity. There are several
amusing sketches among the watercolors.
* * * *
Max Ragless has his annual outbreak
of bold color at Melbourne Athenaeum.
“Red Boatsheds” and “Wilpena Creek”
have their points, but the harshness of
Ragless’s pigment makes some of his
scenery look like paper.
* * * *
Thomas H. Bone, director of art edu-
cation in S.A., belongs to the orthodox
school of watercolorists. An interest-
ing section of his exhibition at Melbourne
Assembly Hall are the buildings of his-
toric value, ranging from Governor
Latrobe’s cottage, Jolimont, to the origi-
nal Henty home at Portland.
* * * *
Bruno Simon, at Kozminsky’s, was a
pupil of the famous French sculptor,
Maillol, who was a pupil of the great
Rodin. Some slight evidences of these
exalted teachers may be apparent in a
nude study of a woman, but most of the
other pieces are in the fashionable mode
of abstract design. It has been carried
into a set of chessmen which are no
improvement on the traditional little
figures that have been fingered by
thousands of players.

Shannon at 5-to-4 on, was one of the
warmest favorites on record for the Epsom,
and failed, but his performance will be re-
membered as one of the gamest seen in that
"‘u handicap His chance was ruined by a
nosr start He was left standing flat-footed
well behind the line, and another horse, Scotch
Gift was facing completely in the wrong direc-
tion When Shannon did get going he was
fully 50 yards behind the tail of the mam
bunch. It looked a hopeless chase. However,
Munro went after them, Young Veilmond
meanwhile setting the pace, leading Puffham,
Glencrag, Dowborough and other lightweights.
Shannon was with the tail-enders as they turned
for home. Down the straight it was Young
Veilmond, close-pressed by Puffham in front,
while coming from the rear, Blue Legend and
Shannon passed horse after horse. The four
crossed the line in a grand finish; Blue Legend
(E Fordyce), half a head to Shannon, same
distance to Young Veilmond and little more
to Puffham. • ,
A four-year-old son of the Metrop. winner
Waikare and the David mare Dalarosa, Blue
Legend is a small black entire of almost weedy
appearance. Apparently one who comes to
hand quickly on a light preparation (he has
had only four races since winning the Don-
caster in April), he won his Doncaster on a
holding track, on which runfting the mile took
1.40. Consequently he was regarded somewhat
as a wet-weather horse, but he ran the Epsom
in 1.36*. Shannon won in the same time
last year and must have registered better time
in running second this year.
With his mount pulling hard and Denali
setting a muddling pace in front, Munro was
forced to fide an unorthodox race on the
Derby favorite, Flying Duke. Given his head,
the colt raced into second place behind Denali
at the mile and went clear three furlongs from
home. It looked all Flying Duke as they
turned into the straight, but near the distance
Concerto challenged and outstayed the favorite,
winning by a half-head. Breasley, on Mono-
gram, waited too long for his pet run bn the
rails, but shifted out in time to bag third
money, a trifle of £5OO. The winner’s cut' was
£3928; second, £lOOO.
A bay colt by Midstream from Sweet
Harmony, Concerto is raced by Mesdames
G. and J. Fleming, of the family which bred
the colt. Ridden by W. Cook, Concerto
started at 33 to 1 and paid better than that
on the tote, Prince Standard being the more
fancied representative from the Lewis stable.
Blue Legend, incidentally, also carries a lady’s
colors; those of Mrs. H. Field.
Having won a barrier trial by a dozen
lengths and done a track gallop of three fur-
longs in 35sec., Temeraire was reckoned a
3-to-1-on chance for the Breeders’ Plate, and
so proved to be. Under restraint', he won
by eight lengths from Set Purpose and Altairian,
the clock stopping half a second short of the
minute. Ridden in his fii;st race by W. Cook,
who had not previously won a Breeders’ Plate,
Temeraire looks every inch a good ’un.
Through his sire, Felcrag, he traces back to
Carbine on the male side, and the pedigree
ef his dam, Gilt Lady, also has an infusion
of that great blood. The colt is trained by
F. T. Cush, an expert with youngsters.
Holders of doubles vouchers for Blue Legend
—Good Idea, with one leg safely home, were
further elated by the Marconigram gelding’s
good effort in the 12-furlongs Colin Stephen
Stakes. Good Idea (E. Fordyce) won easily,
followed home by Chaytor, Russia, Silver Link
and Craigie in that order. Fordyce made it
a hat-trick by winning the Squatters’ Handicap
on Monmouth, with Crusader and Buzz Off
in the places. ,
The much-boomed Quadrant was so popular
for the 10-furlongs Trial Stakes that the call
was 14 to 1 bar one, but, securing a last-minute
run on the rails, Briscoe brought New Cash-
mere through to just catch Sun King and Rotten
Row, with the favorite nowhere. In the seven-
furlongs Kensington Handicap Gold Caste
(V. Faggotter) accounted for Lakshmi Vallis
and Persian Prince. The books had the winner
at fifties, but he paid 121 to 1 on the tote.
Run this year on the second day of the meet-
ing—Monday—the Gimcrack Stakes was won
by the Agincourt-Phoeb’e filly Nechi; a solid
performance, with the Dark Lover filly Virtue
two lengths away and another four lengths to
the Manitoba filly April Pride. The Shorts
(six furlongs) saw the Ajax filly Chaperone
return to her best form, winning by four
lengths from Warspite and Earl Pentheus, her
time, 1.10, equalling the track record held by
Soho and Gold Salute.
What a ’ great thing beaten Shannon was in
the Epsom, was shown by his defeat of Flight
and Magnificent in the mile George Main Stakes
(w.f.a.); a five-lengths win in 1.341, which cut
three-quarters of a second off the Randwick
and quarter of a second off the Australasian
record. Always well forward, Shannon, ridden
by Munro, raced clear away in the straight. The
Metropolitan went to Cordale (G. Moore) from
Chaytor and Good Idea a repetition, with
Blue Legend’s Epsom, of the Doncaster-Sydney
Cup double. Good Idea, cut out at the start,
bumped a fair amount of trouble.

Making his wins 14 in a row, Bernborough
was well tested by Attley in the Melbourne
Stakes at Flemington on Saturday. For a
turlong in the straight it looked as if Attley
was going to hold him. Bernborough took
time and evident effort overhauling the Porto-
nno tpur-year-old; was under the whip in the
struggle that ensued, and did not assert his
superiority until much too close to the post
tor the comfort of those who had laid 6 to 1
on.
Quite a fuss was made about the testing
atterwards, but actually it was one of Bern-
borough’s most outstanding wins. The four
black legs of the big bay having carried him
to success at every distance at' every course
in three States at which he’s been tried, in
handicaps as well as special-weight races, he’s
now expected to go bounding past anything.
In the Melbourne Stakes he was giving Attley
31b.; the distance was one mile; and, leaving
Shannon out' of the reckoning, Attley had
proved himself the best miler in the country.
It would have said little for the whole of
current form if such an evident good one
hadn’t been capable of making the test severe.
Finally, it took Bernborough only a couple
of his great bounds to break clear a length
“Hop on here — it's the safest spot on the course.
and a half ahead as they crossed the line, and
he was going away from Attley at the end.
•It really looked a splendid performance;
whether there was any actual ground for doubts
about it next Saturday’s Caulfield Stakes will
clear up. The Caulfield Stakes would be a
perfect test if Attley joined issue. It’s a nine-
furlongs event, with Bernborough 9.4 and Attley
9st. on the w.f.a. scale.
In the meantime it might be unsafe to
trust too much to “paper” figuring in assessing
Bernborough’s Caulfield Cup chance. With
his 10.10 he ,will then be giving Attley 211 b.
instead of 31b., but Bernborough carried 10.11
when he won over 11 furlongs in Brisbane,
and Attley will not be helped by having to
go half a mile further than he was beaten at
on Saturday. Weight alone is not so important
to a horse of Bernborough’s almost Clydesdale
construction as it is to most. With a big field
the Caulfield Cup will be tough, and the
weather will have a lot to do with it; but the
Melbourne Stakes run was certainly not very
sound ground for feeling that Bernborough
won’t be amongst them at the finish.
The same might be true of the Stand Handi-
cap, won by Gallant' Gentleman from Knockar-
low and Arduli, with a whole string of Cup
hopes nowhere. At Caulfield Cup weights,
Bernborough would probably have cantered it
in.
Joystream, in beating Amelia, Queen of the
Fairies and a good field of other three-year-old
fillies in the Edward Manifold Stakes, took
three seconds longer than Bernborough cover-
ing the mile. Even so, it was the best Oaks
trial to date. Star Act downed Gotham and
Meadower in the 10-furlongs event for three-
year-old colts and geldings; Meadower looked
unlucky. The Maribyrnong Trials went re-
spectively to Moonbeam (Midstream-Suffragette)
from Jalna and Miss Golea; and the Blank-
Delvino colt Variation, who defeated Dumfries
and First Thought. Both winners scampered
the 41 furlongs in 55Isec. Azores easily
won from Reynard and Krallis in the Hurdle.
* * * *
The Chatham colt Conservator easily
accounted for the small S.A. Derby field;
Money Moon and Lord Chatham in the places.
Including 10 wins, Conservator has been
placed in 15 starts. He and Bold Beau are
going to make the Victoria Derby very hard
for any other contenders. Bold Beau looks
safe enough for next Saturday’s Caulfield
Guineas.

With Hammond hitting up 131 (retired)
and Hutton, Washbrook and Compton
also showing good batting form, the
Englishmen had some easy practice
against a Northam (W.A.) team in one of
the extra games put on because the visi-
tors arrived ahead of time. Declaring
at six for 409, they disposed of Northam
for 123. and 71, Edrich bagging six for
20 and twice taking two wickets with
successive balls. The Northam bowling
was only fair, but nevertheless Ham-
mond’s driving looked right up to his best
and very promising for the more solid
games now coming up.
For Combined XI v. England at Perth
on October 17 K. Meuleman and lan
Johnson (Vic.), B. Dooland (S.A.) and
S. Barnes (N.S.W.) have been included.
Enthusiasts will have to dig a little
deeper into their pockets to see this
season’s Tests. The new prices are 3s. 3d.
to the ground (previously 25.); grand-
stand ss. lid. (45.).

The 74,000 who turned out for the
V.F.L. “grand” final on Saturday thought
it was to be a “barrier to post” affair for
Melbourne when that team jumped to a
five-goal lead early in the piece. By half-
time, however, Essendon had pulled the
lead down to three points by cool, steady
play and the crowd got ready for excite-
ment. Excitement arrived, all right, but
not for Melbourne supporters. The Dons
swooped on the ball, booted it through,
swooped on it again, booted it through,
swooped on it again—but why go on?
Melbourne was swamped in a sea of
Essendon marks and kicks, and by three-
quarter time it was all over, Essendon
having kicked 11.8 to 1.1. At the end
the Dons had 22.18 to 13.9, the record
score for a final, and their eighth premier-
ship.
In addition to gate money throughout
the season, which was pretty good, the
V.F.L. will cut up £35,132 from the five
final games, which drew an aggregate
attendance of 346,233. A replay semi-final
put an extra £6670 into the kitty. There
are people in the Victorian bush and up
in Riverina optimistic enough to hope the
League will spend some of the cash on
fostering the game outside the city.
The V.F.A. premiership went to San-
dringham after a ding-dong game with
Camberwell on the St. Kilda ground, the
scores 14.15-13.14 at the finish and the
30,000 crowd well pleased.

With rounds of 75, 69, 69 and 76, H.
W. Pickworth, the Manly (N.S.W.) pro.,
won the Australian “Open” on the Royal
Sydney course, two strokes ahead of the
champion little amateur, Alan Waterson,
of Moore Park. In a big field, N.S.W.
golfers generally outclassed inter-Stata

Hattersley’s record round of 68.

Queer folk, the Russians. With the
Oslo Games in mind, they were sent an
invitation 12 months ago to join the Inter-
national Amateur Athletic Federation.
No reply. Then, a few days before the
games opened, Moscow broadcast that a
team was on its way, and presently it
turned up, complete with officials.
Stretching a point beyond all precedent,
the federation allowed them to compete,
London “Times” commenting: “No more
friendly or sporting gesture has ever been
accorded a nation.” It was made clear
that it wouldn’t be done again; but a
worse federation headache is the fact that
Soviet Russia grants money payments to
any highly successful athlete or player of
games irrespective of his status as an
amateur.

Though at a disadvantage in height,
reach and weight, Alan Hall made his
fight with Eric Macready at Leichhardt
one of the best seen for a long time in
that fortress of stoush, Macready’s
physical superiority was enhanced by
speed, and he beat Hall beyond question.
With snappy lefts and an occasional well-
placed right, Macready was a hatful of
points ahead at the end of the ninth
round. The Melbourne featherweight’s
subsequent efforts were effective —he had
Macready bleeding from the nose and
right eyebrow in the tenth —but not
effective enough.

Another fine bill was presented at
Sydney Stadium; George Pitt v. Roy
Treasure, lightweights, and Kev Mc-
Carthy v. Frank Taylor, welters. A bril-
liant boxer, Pitt is another from Mel-
bourne, and has an unbeaten record in
25 fights. He soon found Treasure, a
southpaw, an open target for right leads,
and got home with many, winning the
first eight rounds beyond question. There-
upon Treasure attacked strongly, but Pitt
still outboxed him, and Wallis’s decision,
a draw, was hotly questioned. McCarthy
and Tayfbr really fought a draw, and
spectators showered coins into the ring as
tokens of appreciation of verdict and
fight. The management came to light
with extra cash for all four pugs.

Shaken Confidence
Business confidence in many parts of
the world, especially in the United States,
is not in a healthy state. In that country
human psychology is rated as a prime
factor in the economic and social be-
havior of the population, and the mental
condition of millions of Americans is
exciting newspaper and political comment
in a way that is inclined to accentuate the
original condition of the mass mind.
There is actually speculation in the
United States as to when the next depres-
sion is likely to hit the country, and ap-
parently the kind of depression feared is
not that of the production type now
almost everywhere evident, but of the
employment type so sharply familiar to
American citizens all through the period
from 1929 to the outbreak of war.
An astonishing situation, in view of
all the factors suggesting high employ-
ment and production for at least five
years to come. By the standards which
were known before the 1939-45 war
there are most of the conditions present in
the United States for a stretch of great
industrial activity. Shortages of hous-
ing, automobiles, furniture and a hundred
other things are acute, and the nation is
possessed of record spending power. In
the majority of key U.S. industries in-
dustrial activity could be maintained at
a high level for several years without
pushing the export trade to any extent —
certainly markets in devastated countries
need not be worried about if the short
view only is to be taken.
One reason' why sections of the
United States are fearful of another de-
pression is that the country never felt
the impact of war to the extent that other
English-speaking nations did—a false
atmosphere of prosperity prevailed in
many £laces : —and speculation and black-
marketing were far more evident. The
Stock Exchanges themselves went through
an intemperate boom based on expecta-
tions of inflation, the huge amount of
“sucker” money that accumulated and
the genuine belief that American industry
should experience a period of un-
paralleled prosperity as soon as recon-
version had been achieved.
Prices of uncontrolled commodities
soared and the cost of living generally
rose steeply, exceeding the inflation in
British costs for many things. Labor in
the United States has been quarrelling
with the proprietary side of industry
since the beginning of the year, and pro-
duction has suffered badly. In this un-
happy atmosphere price control was
weakened in July last, adding to eco-
nomic squeezes and jitters. Manufac-
turers are now showing losses or reduced
profits as a result of production cuts
and rising costs based on labor or fuel
difficulties. Just before the end of the war
it was believed that there would be abun-
dant production long before 1946 ended
and that, with excess-profits tax removed,
company earnings would be exceptionally
high.
Industrial strife in the United States
and the consequent failure to realise
either production forecasts op profit esti-
mates has been one reason for the col-
lapse in share prices on the New York
Stock Exchange. False prices no doubt
existed in some cases on ’Change, but it
required a real jolt to expel the hot air
in quotations, after which something like
panic selling started. The principal jolt
without a doubt was the production
failure in the country and its various con-
sequences.
The greatest danger to confidence in
the world today is industrial unrest. It
exists in Australia and other countries as
"I find this easier to handle than gelignite.”
well as the United States. The fear of
a depression that will ultimately
bring unemployment can be traced
back principally to wage-earners them-
selves, since it is their behavior
which, destroying production, is also de-
stroying confidence. It may be that
profiteering has been indulged in by sec-
tions in the United States to a greater
extent than here. But if American Labor
is sincere in its desire to improve its liv-
ing standard, to bring prices of essential
commodities down, it will get on with the
job of increasing production in the
greatest possible degree. It has not such
heavy taxation to pay as in Australia or
Britain, and the incentive to produce
should be fully alive. As things stand the
example set by the United States in in-
dustrial matters is a depressing influence
throughout the world. It has actually de-
pressed the Australian and London Stock
Exchanges, though that is probably the
least of its ill-effects.
Business confidence is a very valuable
thing. It is almost synonymous with
business incentive. Without incentive we
fail industrially, and that is the position
which threatens the United States and,
in hardly a lesser degree, Australia to-
day. In the midst of a huge demand for
most essential types of commodities
Labor is jockeying for all kinds of bene-
fits, at the same time striking at the very
machinery of production from which
economic wellbeing is derived.
The cry during the 1929-33 depression
was: “Poverty admidst plenty.” The ac-
cusation in it was that national con-
trollers of economics would not provide
the finance to allow wage-earners to earn
money with which to buy the bountiful
production of goods that was then poss-
ible. At the present time we have
“riches amidst scarcity”—or that is how
the picture appears on the surface. Wage-
earners as a body in nearly every country
—Russia and defeated countries excepted
perhaps—have more money than ever be-
fore, but there is a grave dearth of goods
and services principally because of in-
adequate efforts on the part of wage-
earners. Millions of wage-earners in the
world today are saboteurs of their own
social security. In Australia, at any rate,
they are completely incapable of improv-
ing their economic lot without increas-
ing production for the whole nation. And
that they are fully able to do without
straining a muscle.
Strange conflicting forces are at work
in the world. The economic set-up is one
full of inflationary possibilities. But at
the same time lack of business confidence,
due chiefly to labor difficulties, is reducing
the value of shares and capital goods,
while increasing, if anything, the price
of consumer goods and living costs.
Australia and America have before
them at the moment the prospect of great
prosperity if their peoples will only pull
together in a rational way towards a
rational objective. Until the necessity
for this is generally recognised wage-
earners will fritter away their war-time
savings through rising costs and tempta-
tions to spend on frivolities in the absence
of the houses, the furniture and the
motor-cars that they really desire. These
savings, it must be recognised, are in-
herently inflationary in their character to
begin with, but it was generally hoped
that war-time improvements in produc-
tion technique would offset excessive war-
time creation of spending power. Instead
of that happening the production rate has
fallen sharply the other way.
The situation generally is astonishing.
Allowing 12 months from the end of hos-
tilities, there should by now be vigorous
production in countries like Australia and
America. It may be that the silly season
will end as inexplicably as it began.
There is certainly nothing to be confi-
dent about, for Labor or for anyone else,
in the way things are going at the present
time. Because of its excessive and often
untenable demands for “social security”
Labor is frightening an important part of
the time being. The nationalisation of
Empire cable and wireless communica-
tions is still being criticised in Britain.
The Commonwealth Government pur-
chase of the A.W.A. telecommunications
service took effect from October 1, and
the company is to increase its nominal
capital by £1,250,000 in anticipation of
compensation. Directors propose to
capitalise the compensation received, but
Government shares (500,001) will have no
participating rights. While the bill was
being discussed in the Federal Parlia-
ment Mr. Fadden claimed that something
like £1,500,000 was to be paid for tele-
communications (the Beam and similar
services). If all the compensation is to
be handed to shareholders in the shape
of bonus shares, it would seem that it
is actually to be more than £1,000,000
but not more than £1,250,000, nearly all
the present capital having been issued.
Shareholders will be told the actual posi-
tion at the meeting on October 21. The
bonus shares will carry no voting power,
thus leaving control with the Common-
wealth Government. It has still to be
explained to what use A.W.A. proposes
to put the money it will receive. Pos-
sibly it will be invested in Consols for
the time being.

The rise in the dividend of Electrolytic
Zinc from an all-round 9 p.c. to 11 p.c.
follows the increase in the London price
of the metal since war-time contracts ran
out and a slightly higher rate of treat-
ment of zinc concentrates. The co. buys
concentrates from Broken Hill and also
mines its own ore at Rosebery (Tas.).
Before the war Electro. Zinc’s contract
with the Barrier mines provided that, in
the case of rising prices, 60 p.c. of the
increased revenue went to the mines and
40 p.c. to E.Z., which buys and treats the
concentrate and sells the metal. When
the price falls the reverse applies until a
minimum is reached, after which any
further fall is borne by E.Z. That was
the explanation made by the late Colin
Fraser in 1937. Zinc production in the
Commonwealth is now roughly 20 p.c.
greater than in the three years immedi-
ately preceding the war, and in those
years Electrolytic Zinc’s dividends aver-
aged about 16 p.c. The average price for
refined spelter just before the war was
little, if anything, higher than the pre-
sent controlled Australian price of
£l7 12s. sterling, while the prevailing
London price of £5O sterling is more
than double the pre-war price. In 1944-
45 60,179 tons of zinc bars was exported
from the Commonwealth—about three-
quarters of the year’s production. But
that must have included banked-up ship-
ments —local consumption of zinc at the
present time is a good deal more than a
quarter of production, and is probably
nearer to half. In 1945-46 total exports
were 48,179 tons, which compares with
44,617 tons in 1938-39. Production costs
in Tasmania are now higher than before
the war, and taxation is very much
heavier, but Electrolytic Zinc should now
be earning a high rate of profit, and the
recent div. increase would seem to be
fully justified on present conditions. Even
at that the co. and the Barrier are sub-
sidising the Australian price ceiling to
the extent of about £1,000,000 a year on
zinc alone—there would be at least that
much more in the production of refined
zinc in the Commonwealth if world-
parity prices were charged to the Aus-
tralian consumer. E.Z. ord. and pref.
shares have a ceiling price of 695. with
recent sales at 635. 6d.

Box 4088, G.P.0., Sydney.
An inbred fear of what Caucus might
say apparently stops the Chifley Govern-
ment from giving any taxation conces-
sions to industry. Companies pay tax at
the highest war-time rates still, even
though Britain, Canada, New Zea-
land and the United States have
given relief in respect of company
taxes, the United States wiping out
excess-profits tax from the beginning of
1946. In Australia during 1944-45 factory
workers were receiving money wages
approximately 40 p.c. above the pre-war
level. In the war period the average
profits of manufacturing companies fell
22\ p.c., according to Commonwealth
Bank statistics. And the person receiving
dividends from manufacturing companies
would pay a heavier rate of taxation than
the person receiving wages. There is no
rebate of company tax when dividends
are taxed in shareholders’ hands. The
Government’s whole taxation policy is
thus out of plumb. It prefers to give
tax concessions to the forces of spend-
ing instead of to the organisers of pro-
duction. The results are becoming really
very serious. Because of the weight of
war-time (company) tax and private-
company tax many businessmen are not
bothering to extend themselves fully.
They have fuel difficulties, stupid labor
problems and raw-material worries, so
they don’t think it worth making extra
trouble for themselves only to pay more
money to the taxation commissioner at
the end of the year. A sad position, but
one in which Chifley and Co. have had a
large hand. This country urgently needs
production of all kinds, but it won’t get
it so long as the envies and greeds of
sections are pandered to at the expense
of essential minorities. All Australia
would be the better for it if industry
could see some reasonable prospect of
deriving benefits from greater production.
But apparently Canberra Labor is con-
tent to see the country’s productive capa-
city decline to a level similar to that of
Soviet Russia. And that is precisely what
most Communists would like to see.

Explanation by Canadian Finance
Minister Ilsley in his Budget speech:
To-day the ordinary corporation income
tax is 18 p.c., and there is also a minimum
tax on all corporate incomes of 22 p.c.
under the Excess Profits Tax Act, making
an aggregate flat-rate tax of 40 p.c. In
addition, the excess-profits tax takes 20 p.c.
of any income in excess of 116 f p.c. of
standard profits. The proposal we are now
making is to reduce the flat-rate tax from
40 p.c. to 30 p.c., and to make it all
corporate income tax rather than an aggre-
gate of the two types of tax.
I had hoped to announce the repeal of
the Excess Profits Tax Act in its entirety
as from January 1, 1947. After careful
consideration the Government has reached
the conclusion that the Act should stay
on the statute books for another year
unless provision is made at the next session
of Parliament for its earlier repeal. How-
ever, we are proposing that it be further
amended in such a way as (1) to make it
apply solely to corporations, thus releasing
from its provisions all partnerships and sole
proprietors; and (2) to reduce the rate of
tax applicable to excess profits from 20 p.c.
to 15 p.c.
It will thus be seen that in Canada a
company may earn 16f p.c. in excess of
its pre-war profits and still pay only Bs.
in the £ tax. In Australia a company
earning 15 p.c., on its invested funds,
would pay 6s. in the £, plus an additional
6s. Bd. in the £ on two-thirds of the 15
p.c. (only 5 p.c. of the profit being exempt
from war-time company tax). No relief
has been granted to Australian companies
since the highest war-time rates were
imposed.

“D.A.”: One reason why the Menzies
Government failed to get a majority at
the elections seems to have been that
the people as a body were mentally in-
capable of accepting a proposition that
showed a clear-cut road back to produc-
tion and prosperity. For them, “war”
and “war” politics were still on. Used
to deceit, passing the buck, muddle,
waste, disrespect for the law, shirking of
responsibility, political abuse of finance
and back-door methods of doing so many
things—after five years of circumlocu-
tion, many citizens regard an offer of
good democratic government as a con-
fidence trick. There were doubts about
ability to provide family endowment
for the first child, doubts that tax
reductions could be made without up-
setting social-security “plans.” It is beyond
the capacity of the public mind to grasp
the extent of the Chifley Government’s
present expenditure in ways that are no
use to the nation and actually hinder pro-
gress. Expenditure of £5OO million or
£6OO million a year, especially when a
great deal of it comes from bank credit,
is too astronomical a figure for many to
comprehend, and taxation on lower in-
comes, though irksome, is not the frus-
trating thing that it is when incomes rise
to £7OO a year and more. Some wage-
earners have had many things to offset
higher taxes during the war—overtime
and similar earnings—and nearly all have
been living in a false atmosphere of “full
employment” and plentiful money that is
confusing and deceitful. Many voters
preferred to remain in this humid, dopey
atmosphere to stepping out into the brisk
air of reality and industrious enterprise,
with both immediate rewards and “social
security” in proportion to individual
effort and individual contribution, and
with taxation reduced to the cost of effi-
cient administration. War-time bureau-
cratic controls have fuddled the public
mind and sapped initiative, and at the
same time have made living so complex
that it requires an effort of memory to
recall the simpler, saner, more productive
existence.

It seems that the rubber industry is to
be one of the first to see post-war over-
production. The London-controlled price
of 14d. sterling a pound, it is generally
conceded, would collapse under open-
market conditions; but it is claimed in
some quarters that the British Govern-
ment should protect merchants holding
stocks, as well as Malayan planters, in
view of the low price allowed to be
charged when the commodity was scarce.
It seems that Britain will guarantee the
Malayan industry 14d. until Dec. 31, but
already it is selling rubber to America
at under 12d. Papuan growers have not
been allowed to ask world-parity prices
for rubber during the war, and if world
parity is now going to fall it is only right
that the industry should receive stabilisa-
tion assistance for a period at least as
long as that in which prices were held
down by Commonwealth Government
action. Koitaki is one company operat-
ing in Papua ; there are others, as well as
individual planters.

Australian Consolidated Industries Limited
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Ladies and Gentlemen,—
Before referring to the Report and
Balance Sheet for the year ended 3 Ist
May last, I wish to present the follow-
ing apologies;—
First of all, 1 much regret the un-
avoidable absence of our Chairman,
Major-General H. W. Grimwade, who
has had the misfortune to meet with a
slight accident and is confined to his
home.
Mr. F. J. Smith, being unable to
leave Sydney, sent his apology.
Mr. A. E. Smith, Director and
General Manager, is at present in Lon-
don on the Company’s business, and I
believe that his visit will be beneficial
and profitable, as his previous visits
have been.
Mr. Garnsworthy has retired from
the post of General Secretary of the
Company after creditable and distinc-
tive service of 45 years. The Directors
invited him to a seat on the Board to
fill the vacancy caused by the death of
the late E. Norton Grimwade, and his
long experience will be of value to the
Company. He is also undertaking
special duties allocated by the Board.
The Balance Sheet and Accounts
have been in your hands for some days
now, and you will have noted upon
reading same that, for the year ended
3 I st May, the Parent Company earned
a profit available for dividend of
£330,550 compared with £349,771 for
the previous year. From the year’s
profits we paid 7 p.c. per annum on the
Ordinary Shares and 9 p.c. per annum
on the Preference Shares, absorbing
£329,787, both dividends being at the
same rates as were paid the previous
year. *
The financial year of each Subsidiary
Company ended on 31 st March last.
Notwithstanding that for 7J months of
this period hostilities had ceased, manu-
facturing difficulties showed no abate-
ment. In fact, the position generally
deteriorated—-coal particularly. For
the last 13 weeks we have only re-
ceived one half week’s supply of coal at
Melbourne Works. This position has,
naturally, seriously affected the output
and caused loss of trade to our valued
customers, in addition to our own Com-
pany. Notwithstanding that, produc-
tion and sales of Australian Glass Manu-
facturers Company Pty., Ltd., have
doubled since 1939, but continually in-
creasing production costs have been re-
flected in decreased earnings which are
now much less than they were in
1939.
Under existing conditions, retarding
the issue of building permits and the
scarcity of labour and materials, our
usual policy of development is consider-
ably restricted, but, just as soon as in-
dustrial conditions permit, very im-
portant manufacturing developments,
which have already been decided upon,
will be proceeded with.
Like all other industrial enterprises
which are created to serve the com-
munity, the measure of such service is
governed by the industrial conditions
prevailing from time to time.
The evil effect of excessive taxation
on industry generally has been so much
ventilated of late that I hardly need to
make further reference other than to
support the opinion that the lightening
of the tax burden will result in the
establishment of further industry and
consequent increased production, which
is so essential to the interests of indus-
trialist and worker alike.
The Company’s Shares are widely
held. We have 7050 Shareholders, and
the Company employs just the same
number of people.
Since our last Annual Meeting we
have welcomed back the 1400 of our
employees who volunteered in the dif-
ferent war services, and to whom we
have paid out £106,100 for loss of
wages due to such service. Our
thoughts and deepest sympathy go out
to the relatives of the 66 who will not
return.
I consider we are justifiably entitled
to be proud of our achievements, and
I trust that all those interested in our
various activities, the benefits of which
are widespread, will continue to make
their contributions.
I congratulate the management and
Staff for their sterling efforts in the
face of unprecedented difficulties
throughout the period. We appreciate
very much their successful and tireless
efforts in the Company’s interests
during such adverse conditions.
Mr. L. L. EVANS, in seconding the
motion of the Chairman for the adop-
tion of the Report and Balance Sheet,
said that, now the war is over, it is
hoped that the Company will be able
to make its usual progress in regard
to new enterprises.
It was moved by Mr. SYDNEY JONES
and seconded by Mr. M. H. REILLY
that the two retiring Directors,
Sir Alexander Stewart and
Mr. T. C. Alston,
be re-elected Directors of the Company.
It was moved by Mr. M. A. CUMING
and seconded by Mr. G. O. SIM-
COCK that Mr. S. G. Garnsworthy be
appointed a Director to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of the late E.
Norton Grimwade.
Mr. G. O. SIMCOCK moved and Mr.
M. H. REILLY seconded the motion for
the re-election of Mr. A. G. Hooke,
F.C.A. (Aust.), of the firm of Messrs.
Hooke & Graham, as Auditor to the
Company.
A Vote of Thanks to the Directors
and Management was moved by Mr.
L. L. EVANS, who expressed apprecia-
tion for the results obtained. The
motion was seconded by Mr. SYDNEY
JONES and carried by acclamation.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bo”: The lone street of Emuville
drowsed in the midday sun. The figure
draped against the verandah rail of the
Fencer’s Arms came slowly to life at
sound of a human voice. Looking up, he
observed an individual on a bike. “Could
y’ tell us where the store is?” the cyclist
asked. The tired one took nearly half
a minute to collect his thoughts. “Ain’t
got no store in this township, mate,” he
said at last. The other stared. “No
store!” he repeated. “But, dammit, y’
must have —y’ got two pubs.” The other.
now almost awake, groped for his pipe
and began to fill it. “Can’t help that,
mate, but there’s no store. Y’ see, it’s
like this. When they struck gold out
along the Fiddleback this joint boomed.
We soon had two pubs an’ a store. When
the field petered out things got crook
an’ it got that way in the end that the few
people left here couldn’t go on supportin’
two pubs an’ a store —so the store had
to close, that’s all.”
* * * *
“Notaden”; Asleep on a bough, heads
lifted in automatic imitation of a broken
branch, tawny-brown in plumage-pattern
for greater inconspicuousness, the pair
of frogmouths who use the old blackbutt
across the road as a day-dormitory might
seem the most stupid and unenterprising
of birds. At dusk they wake and glide
silently into the night, big eyes alert and
wide hooked bills ready for any unwary
insect, to return at first peep of dawn for
another long sleep. But they do not
always doss down in the same place on
the tree. There seem to be quite definite
rules in the matter, based apparently on
wind-direction. In a south-east or north-
west breeze they use a narrow fork on
an almost horizontal branch, facing into
the wind with lifted heads touching the
upper limb. In a cold westerly they go
upstairs to where a gnarled branch curves
sharply to provide a sheltered bend. Re-
garding south winds, they seem to hold
different views and often sleep apart, one
upstairs in the westerly bedroom, the
other 30ft. lower down on the south-
easterly fork, sometimes on its upper side.
But, once settled in, they don’t move
even should the wind change during the
day. One hundred and forty-five con-
secutive rainless days have prevented me,
so far, from stickybeaking on their wet-
weather procedure.
* * * *
“C.E.”: Mum, clearing the dinner
things, paused to glance at her lord,
slumped wearily in his chair. “Aren’t
you go in’ back to the harrowing, Dad?”
she asked, “Aw, I dunno, Mum,”
came the sleepy drawl. “Seems I’ve
done so much walkin’ after them
flamin’ harrers this past week I’m clean
done up. Think I’ll take a spell an’
see if I can get a fish f’r tea.” Dragging
round languidly, he collected his tackle
and departed. “Got a couple, Mum,”
he beamed, stamping into the kitchen two
hours after dark. “Fished up t’ the two-
mile before I got a nibble ; then hang me
if the first bloke didn’t get away. Bit
later I landed a beaut. Not big, y’ know,
but awright. Then about dark I got an-
other in that hole above Bandy’s
Crossin’.” “Bandy’s Crossing!” gasped
Mum. “But that’s seven miles upstream.
Y’d have to walk back, too.” “Yair,”
grinned the old bloke, “an’ what made it
further was goin’ over t’ Tubby Cox’s, t’
show him me catch.” Proudly, Dad
tipped out the fish. “There’s no doubt it
does a bloke good T have a spell frum
work sometimes, Mum,” he boomed
heartily. “Now I’ll be fresh ’s a lark t’
tackle them harrers again in the mornin’.”
* * * -•*
“Hanko”: The stout bloke from the
sleek-looking car stumbled across the
clods till he got within hailing distance.
•“Hey,” he yelled at us. “About this darn
cattle-track you calf a road ; does it lead
to a usable highway or doesn’t the
blasted thing lead anywhere?” “Yair,”
said the boss, and he jiggled the tractor
into action and sputtered away in a mist
of blue smoke. When I looked back the
fellow was still standing ankle-deep in
the ploughland. He appeared to be striv-
ing to think.
* * * *
“Plankton”: “Dronestung’s” 10 miles
as a bee’s working range (B. 11/9/’46) is
too far by two to three miles. The life
of the worker bee after emergence from
the cell has three phases. The first fort-
“See the ‘Zoo' on its collar? We better take it back”
night is occupied with nursery jobs plus
air-fanning; next 10 days of general hive
and guard duties are varied with explora-
tory flights; then busy days as a
regular outside forager. Even if lucky
enough to escape accidents and
enemies the bee’s career is a short
one, unless she was born late in
the season. Her wings become worn out,
and she lasts at most a month, generally
three weeks. Queens may live to three
years, but evidence deterioration after the
first year: as for the drones, the colony
eliminates them without ado when
summer days are waning. Also, in the
event of conditions unfavorable to swarm-
ing the drones may be destroyed.
♦ * * *
“Sir Spen”: Motoring from Inverell to
Yetman (northern N.S.W.) early one
morning, I met a chap walking along with
a bridle on his arm. He beckoned, and I
pulled up. “I don’t suppose,” he said,
“you noticed a bay saddle-horse back
along the road. I’ve been walking since
sun-up and can’t find a trace of the
beggar. Got out of the horse-paddock
last night. Don’t know how, but he did.”
I hadn’t noticed such a horse, and said so,
suggesting at the same time that perhaps
I could give him a lift home. The offer
was accepted. On arrival at his home, I
was invited to inspect the homestead
improvements, in which my host obvi-
ously took particular pride. Thus we
came to the stables. There in a stall
nibbling at some hay was the missing
horse, a saddle on its back, but no bridle
on him. “Well, I’ll be damned,” ex-
claimed my host. “1 must have put him
in there last night, come in this morning
and took the bridle off, and then gone
looking for him.” He, was known locally,
I heard later, as “Forgetful Mick.”
m * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Wilson’s Pro-
montory, Victoria’s rugged and most in-
accessible national park, which was used
during the war as a training ground for
commandos, was a week or so ago
handed back to the Lands Department by
the Defence authorities. Those of us who
know “The Prom,” its gum-clad slopes,
sweeping beaches, curving bays and
übiquitous vistas of wild ocean dotted
with innumerable islands, know that no
place in the southern State compares with
this 22 miles-long peninsula for scenic
grandeur and contrasts. Yet, in pre-war
years, except for a few tourists coming
by road to the chalet at the north-east end,
the mountainous headland was visited
only occasionally by fishermen and odd
yachtsmen. Save along a rough bridle-
track following the granite-bound western
coast to the lighthouse at the southern
extremity, the gum-scented forests and
shores are accessible only to men of the
commando type. Once a mate and riiyself
took four hours to travel across the moun-
tainous neck—two miles it is measured
on the chart —from Refuge to Sealers’
Cove, and my mate was a piner from the
west coast of Tassie, used to undergrowth.
« * * *
“Esk D.”: Dad Ramswool comes fum-
ing from the creamery. “Those blasted
cats! ” he explodes. “The place is over-
run with ’em, an’ they’ve got in an’ sent
the cream flyin’ agen. I’m goin’ t’
wooden the useless lot of ’em.” “But,
Dad” protests Mum. “Aw, it’s no
use tryin’ t’ stop me,” Dad growls.
“They’ve killed all the birds wot useter
keep the caterpillars orf the veges an’
the sheds are full of mice they won’t
chase.” Just then Tommy rushes up at
a barefoot canter. “Hey, Dad,” he yells
excitedly. “The old black tom”
“Yair?” prompts Dad, “Up t’ more mis-
chief, I’ll be bound.” “Well, Vs just
dragged a big brown snake still twitchin’
from under the sleep-out,” says Tommy.
A vindictive gleam flashes from Dad’s
eyes. “There, wot did I tell y’?” he de-
mands. “Harry, git me a bag an’ we’ll
round the cats up an’ drown the lot. The
[unmentionable] pests —even encouraging
snakes about the place.”

“E. 2”; Mullins had no difficulty in
getting a couple of helpers for the grass-
hay harvest; the days were hot and dry
and the stuff cut in long rolls of rye-
grass and clover. It was raked into rows
and cured perfectly, with still no signs of
rain. For a whole week, with the sweeps
pushing great bundles up to the stacks
and Mullins scanning the sky anxiously,
the weather held and the harvest was
covered, and there wasn’t a mouldy straw
in the stacks. Next day the downpour
started and continued intermittently for
a fortnight. His neighbors enviously con-
gratulated Mullins on his luck. “Luck! ”
echoed Mullins. “It’s the first year in
twenty that I didn’t lose half me hay
through rain spoilin’ it, Y’d hardly call
it luck me promisin’ meself I’d switch
from cows t’ sheep next year if the har-
vest didn’t turn out better than usual.
Now,” he moaned, “I s’pose I’ll have t’
keep on milkin’ f’r the rest o’ me days.”
* * * *
“Betcha”: The difference between a
dog and a fox digging out rabbits is that
while the dog usually starts the job from
the burrow opening, a fox rarely wastes
time on useless work. He digs straight
down above the nest of bunnies, and his
tell-tale hole, sunk to a depth of
twelve to fifteen inches, is common
enough. Then out come nest and all,
if the youngsters are still in the nest
stage. Have heard it argued that Johnny
often uses his ears as well as his nose
in locating the bunnies, and after watch-
ing an old dog listening intently over a
burrow where kittens were found I agree
that he may sometimes pick their where-
abouts by the grizzling of the litter.
Strangely enough, one often finds fox
and rabbits living in the same burrow,
the bunnies sleeping in the smaller shoots.
One can understand the ginger bloke’s
attitude to the house-sharing scheme,
but it beats me why bunny doesn’t bother
shifting to less nerve-racking quarters.
* * * *
“Goldie”: On rich gold, we were
plagued with sightseers, newchum
prospectors and go-getters. The go-
getters pitched some pretty tales
and wasted a lot of our time, per-
sisting even after being told flatly that
we weren’t in the market for blocks of
land, pine forests or dubious investments.
The boss finally hit on a solution. When-
ever he recognised the symptoms pre-
paratory to a longwinded blast of sales
talk he’d eye the go-getter squarely and
say “Look, mister, I’ll bet you an even
fiver you don’t sell me anything.” It
worked like a charm.
* * * *
“Atlanta”: Clancy the overseer had
been drinking “red ned” for a week and
had reached the stage where he threat-
ened frequently to do away with himself.
For that purpose he borrowed old Steve’s
repeater, loaded it dramatically, and
placed it conveniently at hand until the
fateful moment should arrive. Steve
viewed proceedings tolerantly, hoping
only that the overseer wouldn’t add
murder to suicide, with himself as the
victim. The day he mustered the weaners
Clancy stayed at home with his grog, his
threats and the repeater. Steve came
back at noon and as he breasted the
kitchen a shot cracked flatly from within,
followed almost immediately by a second.
Steve dropped his bridle and rushed in-
side, knowing already what he’d find.
Empty bottles lay on the floor and
Clancy sprawled on his bunk, the rifle
across his chest —but he wasn’t dead.
Close to a hole in the far wall was a
piece of cheese and around it lay a heap
of dead mice, picked off as they sallied
forth for the bait.

“S.G.”: In training for a fight and
doing fairly solid road work, I found
myself getting a? little stale and, after
some pondering, decided to try a new
route in the hope that a change of scenery
might be helpful. I’d hardly got started
the first morning when a couple of spur-
wing plovers launched a dive-bombing
attack and for a few minutes I was duck-
ing and dodging and shadow-sparring at
a rate hitherto unattained. Back home
a thought struck me, and every morning
afterwards I went looking for the plovers.
Yes, they brought me out of the staleness,
put freshness and sparkle into my work
and I had the fight won before I went
into the ring. Vic Patrick never took
such a beating in his life.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: We were working in
the Hamley Bridge (S.A.) transhipping
yards when he yelled “Look out!
jumped from the ramp and shoved a big,
fair-headed young bloke out of the way
of a rake of trucks that had been kicked
off the shunting engine. The bloke picked
himself up and looked at Mat as the big
fellow, white with the closeness of it,
growled “Why don’t y’ watch out, y
silly dope?” The rescued one gave
Mat a strange look and went off about
his work without a word. “Musta scared
him dumb,” grunted Mat. About 11
o’clock that night we’d just turned in
when there was a knock on the room
door and in came the fair-headed cove.
“Look,” he said, eyeing Mat severely,
“thanks for knockin’ me out o’ the road
o’ them trucks t’day. But y’ had no right
t’ call me a silly dope in front of all them
fellers. Hop your frame outside.” Mat
sat up in bed, “Gripes,” he mumbled,
“why didn’t y* pick me then?” “I don’t
kick up a row in front o’ mobs,” said
the visitor. “It ain’t their show % Come
on, hop your frame outside an’ I’ll show
you who’s a dope.” Mat got out. So
did I. “You stay there,” Mat ordered.
“Didn’t y’ hear him say he don’t like
crowds?” So I sat in bed while the pair
of them went out into the dark and
deserted street and had it out. They were
good friends afterwards, but neither ot
’em would ever tell anybody who won the
fight, though they had the marks of it
all over them. I don’t know even now.

“Colonial Cove”: Actually the rabbit,
domesticated or wild, was not a native ot
Britain; originally it came from Spain.
It is thus a hot-climate animal and so.
when liberated in Australia, found exactl)
the country that suited it. In Britain
its numbers were kept within bounds b'
natural enemies: the fox, the stoat ani-
the weasel. Also rabbits bred for gene-
rations in captivity lost the capacity or
fending for themselves when restored to
the wild ; becoming accustomed to living
in hutches, etc., they lost the idea ot
digging a burrow, a necessary protection.
This in itself constitutes the difference
between the tame rabbit and the wild,
although both are physically identical.
So if odd rabbits did escape from early
importations they probably perished
quickly from sheer inability to acclimatise
themselves.
COASTERS.
Salt rime along the railing,
And grease and grime below,
Off-shore they pounded, trailing
Black smoke from funnels low;
To coastal harbors sailing
From Sydney ip the flow
Of morning, or the failing
Red sunset’s afterglow.
With stocks for those who trade in
The needs of Bush and Town
Their holds were deeply laden
And safely battened down —
New ploughs for farmers, laid in
Some foundry of renown,
And for the rural maiden
Her long-dreamt wedding gown;
And liquids, packed in cases
With stencilled signs, they tfore;
These sometimes, too, the traces
Of recent ullage wore;
For broaching small disgrace is
With them who toil longshore
In hot and thirsty places,
Where sweats Sir Stevedore.
That Argo’s trip, returning,
No freight romantic brings;
Main profits of its earning
Were pigs—which have no wings!
They carried coals for burning
And maize and homely things
A bard —for beauty yearning—
Oft sees, but seldom sings.
The Captains—little caring
For wines or choice cigars,
And on coat collars wearing
Few decorative stars,
All sea discomforts sharing
With mates and frowsy tars —
Had learned in long seafaring
The moods of winds and bars.
Their salty crews, enlisted
From all the ends of earth,
Sun-tanned and hairy fisted,
Found rum and rowdy mirth
Whenever chance assisted
The rusty tanks to berth;
Their minds were rarely misted
By thoughts of home and hearth.
With cranks and shafts complaining
Through gale or calm or haze,
So passed the coasters straining
Along our waterways;
So went the shipmen, gaining
Their bread in strident days,
With no wight entertaining
A dream of fame or praise.
VICTORIA.

“B. A. Ker”; Greg hadn’t taken an
inventive fit for over a month when he
found the photo, of an Indian palace in
a travel magazine. . We old hands recog-
nised the symptoms as soon as he got out
his tee-square and compasses. The session
lasted long after we’d turned in, and it
ran as a serial. A week later Greg allowed
us to view the result of his deficient sleep
—a palatial aviary completely planned
from arched doors to domed roof. Then
the construction began, with our sleeping
quarters as the workshop. For weeks
we cursed the genius while trying to
snatch a few winks between his bashings
with a hammer and his raspings with a
saw. After that there came the fumes
of paint and enamel. Then finally the
hour when Greg triumphantly announced
the structure complete. And what a
structure! Undoubtedly an aviary fit
for the most princely of birds. Now the
inventive one is engaged on a more
knotty problem: how to get an aviary

“Old-timer”: With a friend from the
coast I was sitting on a log watching
the old Murray roll by and yarning about
nothing in particular when a big cod,
defunct and floating with its white belly
upward, went slowly past. A pelican
winging steadily upstream eyed the
corpse indifferently and went on ; a couple
of minahs shot out of the gums in a
half-circle, shrieking madly, and then
withdrew ; a blue crane crossed the river
without a second look at the dead fish,
which presently passed round the bend
out of sight. “Well,” remarked my
friend, an observant cove, “these river-
water birds must be different from the
sea-water ones. A dead fish like that
would have been hidden under a cloud
of squawking gulls and terns, and if you
like to swap an albatross for that pelican
the albatross would have fallen on that
fish like a shot,” Are river birds more
particular?

“Lower Tops’!”: Chasing emus on
foot (B. 18/9/’46)? Tell “Bozo” my boy-
hood apprenticeship running down quail
on Bass Strait islands trained me for this
sort of chasing. Although a salt-water-
minded bloke, I once took a run inland,
out beyond the Darling. On a station
there I was one day piloting a horse in a
sulky when a big emu came circling up
within a ship’s length to have a quiz at
either me or the cart. Well, I set off
after the big fowl; I’ll never forget it,
belting that horse mile after mile across
those huge plains. Just as I was be-
ginning to gain ground the horse dropped
dead, so I took after the big bird on foot.
I never ran so fast; in fact I didn’t know
I could. Then just as I got my hand on
the tiring bird a terrific bushfire —it had
been caused from the sparks flying off
my boots —caught us up. The perspira-
tion I shed put it out.
* * * *
“Bennie”: In various parts of Northern
Australia one often hears about the black
kangaroo. It seems to be a very elusive
animal. The only all-black native animal
is Bernard’s wallaroo ( Macropus bern-
ardus), though other wallaroos are some-
times so dark as to look almost black at a
distance. In the early winter the males
are a glossy black all over ; in the summer
they revert to a deep brown. Bernard’s
wallaroo keeps to the roughest parts of
the northern scrubs, and is very agile. It
was named after the director of the Perth
Museum, Bernard Woodward.
* * * ♦
“Narrin”: I was struggling through the
porcupine clumps on a dazzling slope of
splintered quartzite when a bronzewing
pigeon flew out almost at my feet. Her
nest was a little heap of dead mallee
leaves gathered on the bare pink-white
rock in the spiky lee of a porcupine. Two
hundred yards away, at the summit of
the hill, was a thin scrub of dwarf mallee.
Beyond that, down the far slope, were
dense tangles of pine and blackoak, and
yet the bronzewing had deposited her
two white eggs on the ground. There is
a theory that the crazy nests and un-
camouflaged eggs of the topknots and
bronzies are pointers to the fact that,
until recent times, these birds nested in
holes or hollows. If this is so it is also
likely that birds who have abandoned an
old nesting habit may try a variety of
new nesting sites before an ideal is
“ Cripes, you Were lucky, mate! How about buying a lottery ticket?”
reached. It’d be interesting to know if
the offspring of my ground-nester will, if
they escape foxes, crows and hawks, in
their turn nest on the ground either be-
cause of inherited tendency or some
vague memory of the home of their in-
fancy. The dangers, however, are so
many that it’s unlikely that the trick will
be perpetuated—at least for more than
a couple of generations.
* * *
“Screwball”: Wandering through the
lightly-wooded, low-rainfall country
around the Westralian goldfields it
struck me that the country is
similar to that of the north-east
African plains, haunt of the wild
Guinea fowl; which raised the natural
question,- why haven’t we tried them
here? When at home the birds live
for eight or nine months of the year
without water, and their favorite nourish-
ment appears to be the white ant; the
food and drink supply problem should,
therefore, present no worries in Wes-
tralia. Perhaps the experiments with
rabbits, foxes, sparrows, etc., have dis-
couraged trial. Rather silly birds, they
are easily shot or trapped. Natives of
the eastern Sudan place a conical net
under one of the trees where fowl con-
gregate in the heat of the day. Follow-
ing the shadow of the tree they
manoeuvre in front of the entrance to
the net; then the trappers leap out and
yell. The birds go straight in the desired
direction every time.
* * * *
“Prop”: The little pine-tree stands
above the creek, its roots protected by a
coping of slate, the same stone that lies
all about, dull red and deep, sullen
brown. But the pine-tree’s private pave-
ment has been varnished so that the
colors of the slate show through, rich
and warm and living. You pick up a
piece and find the varnish dried on it to
a hacd finish, glossy smooth and glassy
“ Hadn't you better undo his collar, mister?”
clear. Not believing that any conven-
tional fairy could make such a workman-
like job, you try to discover the secret,
but beyond a few colorless drops of
sticky fluid among the pine leaves there
seems no explanation. However, a closer
examination reveals, clustered along the
leaf-bearing twigs, hundreds of tiny
aphides, each one a brown that exactly
matches the bark. To make them harder
to see they are usually grouped along the
shaded side of the branch, away from
the sun. A lens shows the insects in the
usual position: sucking beaks buried
deep in the bark; some of them have
drops of honey exuding from pores on
their backs. If you search the twigs until
you find where a sizable drop of the
sticky fluid has run down and accumu-
lated you may taste the tucker of the
pine-tree—a grade A honey, sweet and
fragrant. Then you wander off, think-
ing what a damn’ fool an aphis -is:
equipped with a very efficient extracting
apparatus for pinching the tree’s tucker,
he wastes the best and greatest part of it,
simply because his way of life is so in-
active that his body can’t use the energy-
filled sugar. The ants benefit from the
waste, but there are countless thousands
of pine-trees, most of them feeding
thousands of aphides, and the sweetness
spatters down to varnish the stones be-
low. The waste, however, is only ap-
parent, for with the next shower of rain
Nature will take the precious materials
back into circulation again.

“Zake”: It is a peculiar fact that the
only bird which inspires in the bush dog
a feeling of trepidation, even panic, when
it comes to close quarters is the crow —er,
pardon, raven. The kookaburra might
unleash a full-blooded laugh in his ear
and Bluey will merely yawn. The
butcher-bird or the peewit may hop
aboift even on his kennel and evoke no
particular response from the tyke. Even
the aggressive magpie doesn’t awake in
him any particular animosity or fear.
But let the fowl in the funereal topcoat
utter his raucous complaints too close
to him and the grin on Bluey’s dial will
be immediately replaced by a look of
intense uneasiness. Perhaps the dog,
along with his human cobber, has come
to associate the sable pest with death.

“Yalcogrin”: For good clean fun and
laughter, collect a copy of the “Saturday
Evening Post” for April 30 and dive into
an article on “Following the Fleece.”
Meet the American shearer. He drags
his sheep on to the board by the right
hind leg, and after peeling off the belly
proceeds to tie its hind legs to discourage
kicking during subsequent operations.
Our scribe put the stopwatch on a Texan
“gun,” who “completely shore” a plain-
bodied crossbred in four minutes and a
half. The picker-up—bright lad —
also acts as tally clerk. Before taking the
fleece off the board he gives the barber
a brass token “for one sheep,” and as
these slowly accumulate the shearer can
trade them back for multiple tokens of
five, 25 and 50. Shearing rates are what-
ever the shearers can gouge out of the
contractor, or as little as he can hire
a team for; in fact, anything between
five and 15 dollars per 100.

“Gravelsnatcher”; I had abandoned
hope of getting cured of rheumatism
when an old acquaintance
suggested that I place my-
self in his hands on the
understanding that he
would waive his fee if my
case failed to respond to
his treatment. While he
reclined in the shade of a
tree I, acting on his in-
structions, excavated a
hole large enough to con-
tain my body lying down.
This I filled with twigs, to
which I set alight. Before
the coals were dull my
practitioner then placed
over them, in the hole, a
layer of eucalypt leaves,
and instructed me to lie
down on them —naked, of
course. Then he placed
leaves over me, and finally
filled in the hole with sand,
leaving only my head
above ground. In that
oven I lay and sweated
while the eucalyptus fumes
rose and nearly suffocated
me; and from it I
emerged without a trace of the crippling
complaint. My medical friend expressed
satisfaction at the result, and his fee —an
ounce of tobacco and an old knife —
seemed reasonable enough. I’ve been
free of twinges ever since. In their place,
or thereabouts, is an abiding respect for
an old abo. tribal “doctor” who knew
the healing properties of eucalyptus, and
how to apply them.

“Billy See”: I, too, like “Dusty

music being capable of coaxing a serpent
from its lurking place until at a bush hike

“Chuck”: Sam left for work at day-
light and returned at dark so, wanting
his assistance for a few hours, I called
round early. With the job finished, we
were returning, when we ran into the
camper just below Sam’s hut. He was
pulling up a night line. “Hey, aren’t there
any fish in this river?” he called, as we
drew opposite. “Plenty,” I assured him.
“Why?” “Well, I’ve had a line in every
night for over a week,” he complained,
“and the bait’s always gone, but I’ve
caught nothing.” “Current must wash
y’r bait orf,” Sam chimed in. The bloke
nodded. “Ever do any fishing here?”
he asked. “Me?” sniffed Sam, “Gripes,
when’ve I got time t’ fish? Anyway, I
got no line.” “Might’s well pull mine up,
I s’pose,” mourned the camper. “Aw,
g’on, don’t be a squib,” urged Sam. “They
might start catchin’ any time.” We rode
on. “That’s the trouble with young blokes
nowadays,” he scowled presently. “Ain’t
got the sense t’ stick at anything long
enough t’ be any flamin’ good.” And, go-
ing into the hut, he carefully scraped
into the fire the bones of the fresh two-
pounder I’d found him bogging into qt
breakfast.

“Blime”: Pat is an unconventional
bloke whose delight in doing things differ-
ently has developed nerves and muscles
above the average. I’ve seen him put his
nag through its paces while facing the
animal’s tail, and I’ve paid up when,
after shinning a tall branchless gum, I
watched him turn at the top and shin
down again head first. Was with him
the other day when he ran into a road
gang putting in a “chinaman” over a
deep gravel-pit. With a dry bush spar
already across the pit, the gang were
gathered around puzzling ways and means
of getting a heavy eighteen-foot log into
position. “Carry it over,” Pat suggested.
The gang boss snorted derisively.
“Sling it on a shoulder an’ walk over
the spar, eh? Bet a quid you’ve never
seen the man that c’d do it.” Pat dragged
a boot off his nag’s neck, and with
muscles standing out like lumps of gran-
ite, he lifted the twelve-inch log and got
a shoulder underneath. “Awright, hold
up your end, an’ pay her out,” he called,
stepping out on the spar. Half way over,
the two men on the land end wobbled
badly, and a third jumped to their assist-
ance. Pat dropped the log into place,
and was climbing his nag again, when
the gang boss handed up a quid. Pat
waved it back. “Two things I ain’t never
come down to,” he drawled as he turned
away. “Pinchin’ pennies from kids, an’
takin’ money orf blokes that’s helpless.”
OCTOBER DAWN.
Behind the tumbled towers
Of Dandenong’s dim range
Some deep-down glory flowers,
Some mystical sky-change
Possesses heaven wholly;
And stars and planets fail
As dawn’s white peacock slowly
Spreads out his silver fail
#
With fire in every feather,
While far and far away
The hilltops all together
Catch up the coming day.
Each bird begins his matin,
The folded mists unfurl.
The sea is smooth as satin
And luminous as pearl.
Her spires half-veiled in slaty
Sea fog and vaporous damps,
Once more the smoky city
Turns out her thousand lamps.
Westward once more returning
Defeated night goes down,
The golden waves of morning
Break over Melbourne Town.
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DONT WORRY.IM SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Classing.
“Murrawong”: “R. Ney’s” hints on
classing are more theoretical than prac-
tical (B. 18/9/’46), and his statement
that “a classer should make his lines and
class to them irrespective of changes in
flocks” seems absurd. For instance,
taking a merino clip and disrsgarding
rams, lambs and odd lots, suppose the
first wool came from four-tooth and six-
tooth wethers after a good average sea-
son. If the bulk of the wool was of shafty
medium quality one could expect the
fleece lines to pan out on a ratio of eight
bales AAA (64/66’s well nourished —
average 4in. staple), three bales AA (same
quality and length, heavier condition),
three bales 888 (60’s warp), one bale A
(short 64/66’s).
If the next mob brought in should
comprise old ewes with lambs at foot,
how many bales would the classer get
from them to match the preceding lines?
He probably wouldn’t get a bale out of
500 ewes to match any one line of the
wether wool. Age and strain of rearing
a lamb would be reflected in the length,
character, fineness and condition of the
wool, which would be shorter, finer,
thinner and lighter and could differ in
color and vegetable content because the
sheep were running in different paddocks.
Classed as a flock, without relation to
the wethers, the ewes might be expected
to pan out eight bales AAA (70/64’s
bright, sound Sin. staple), three bales A
(short-stapled fleeces), three bales Ist
FLC (tender fleece), one bale B (doggy,
run-out fleeces). .
If the order of shearing were reversed
the result would be the same. If the
AAA standard of the clip were set by the
ewes, the classer’s hardest job would be
to find a sufficient variety of brands for
the wether wool. Brokers have indicated
that AAAA or more on a bale is a nuis-
ance. In merino classing an even length
is more important than quality or con-
dition. Topmakers’ wools, which com-
prise the great bulk of the Australian
clip, allow each line a fair range of
quality—64/70’s is a common type—and
even a variation of 5 p.c. in yield between
two fleeces in the same bale is not a
grave fault. It makes for difficulty in
valuing, but after scouring the variation
has disappeared. Nothing will make a
2|in. staple match a 4in. staple.
Experienced classers know that each
flock has to be classed according to its
characteristics. In one mob quality and
length may be even, and the biggest vari-
ation may lie in condition. In another
varying lengths of staple may be the
dominant feature, and length—not con-
dition—will form the chief distinction be-
tween lines. Some sheep may come from
a river frontage of black soil and trefoil.
Others may have been in a paddock of
red sandy soil and grass seed. Although
the wools may be similar in length and
quality, the lines won’t match because
of the different color of tip, the possi-
bility of dusty backs from the red soil,
heavier skirting of burry fleeces from
one paddock and seedy necks from the
other prevent the interlotting of the
skirtings, bellies, etc.
Galvanised Burr.
“J.8.H.”: The harassed Queensland
grazier has for the last few years been
too engrossed in immediate difficulties —
droughts, flies, soil erosion, bushfires,
strikes, etc., to worry much about what
new menace Nature might be preparing.
It is time that we began to act against
“I’m in a hurry , boss. Mum Wants me to help her wring out the clothes."
galvanised or “blue” burr. I have noted
with alarm over the last ten years the
steady increase of this menace in some
of Queensland’s richest grazing lands.
One of the hardiest plants I have en-
countered, droughts seem to benefit
rather than check it. On one particular
place where drought has ruled for three
years the pest has increased its hold, the
absence of any other kind of plant life
probably helping it along. A good sea-
son, with very little stocking, seems the
only natural way to check it, the native
grasses then being able to choke it back.
Where the burr has had a good start and
is really thick the native grasses will not
grow thickly enough to check it.
The only effective control is by fire.
At the present wage rate it is hardly
practicable to chip and stack it. Easiest
way is with a flamethrower when the
plant is as dry as possible, then allowing
the paddock a long spell.
The value of the burr as a sheep
fodder is practically nil. Sheep can, and
will if very hungry, eat the young burr
when there is only a single stalk out of
the ground with only a few prickles on
it; when the plant has developed into a
small shrub, however, it is almost im-
possible for a sheep or any other animal
to eat it. I’ve seen sheep die of starva-
tion in a paddock liberally coated with
galvanised burr. If not checked it
will become as great a menace to the
pastoral lands of Australia as was the
prickly pear.
Artificial Fertilisers.
Robert Howie: Where do opponents
of chemical manures get the idea of
“forcing” a crop? A plant needs a mix-
ture of the various soil elements, and,
other conditions being favorable,' it grows
as well as the shortest-supplied element
permits. To improve the crop increase
the amount of the limiting element.
Whether this is accomplished with arti-
ficial or organic manure is a question of
cost only. There is no such thing as
“forcing” a crop; the process is one of
enabling.
Here in W.A. the anti-fertiliser argu-
ment reads rather oddly, because in most
districts you could produce enough com-
post for one acre only by cropping two
acres with super.
What is “natural” manure, anyhow?
Why is organic phosphate from Nauru
called “artificial”? Some factories pro-
duce nitrogen from the air. So do the
bacteria that feed legumes. The point is
not that the bacteria do the job more
naturally but that they do it cost free.
H. F. White (B. 4/9/’46) says he
has never found authentic records of
continued plant, animal and human
health and reproduction under continued
fertiliser practice. Let him look at any
well-run Westralian grazing property.
Poor condition and sterility of stock,
lack of quality and quantity of pasture
growth, as well as soil erosion, are all
more prevalent on the farm that is
starved of super.
Machine Milking.
“Rooster”: The removal of the cups as
soon as the flow ceases (B. 14/8/’46) is a
contributory factor in stopping mastitis,
but the most damaging effect comes from
over-pressure. It’s surprising how-many
farmers allow pressure to exceed the
necessary figure for comfortable milking.
The result is that the rims of the cups
bite into the base of the teats and have
the same effect as the application of a
tourniquet. The teat canals become in
time atrophied and corrugated ; inflam-
mation follows, generally extending into
the udder. '
A close and regular check on the pres-
sure gauge is always necessary. The
average comfortable figure is midway be-
tween the minimum and maximum read-
ings. A low pressure will cause the cups
to fall, an avoidable circumstance which
not only damages the cups but gives the
cow a nasty fright, making her afraid of
machines. There is no excuse for either
low or high pressure, since all milking-
machine plants are fitted with regulators.
Other factors are often overlooked.
North winds invariably bring dust.
Small particles lodge in the overlapping
surfaces of the sliding valves. This means
a small intake of air on the upstroke—
and reduced pressure. Valves should be
cleaned daily and a fresh smear of
graphite applied. Another fault is apply-
ing the cups on wet teats. This tends to
cause bubbling, with consequent irrita-
tion.
Can’t agree with the suggestion of boil-
ing rubber parts in a caustic soda solu-
tion (B. 28/8/’46). No doubt caustic soda
is an invaluable cleansing agent, but
boiling rubber tends to shrink it, so that
the parts must be forcibly stretched back
over the cups. Taut rubbers are as bad
as high pressures. The only way to
cleanse rubber parts without damaging
their flexibility is to dismantle them
daily, wash excess fat off with warm
water to which is added a small quantity
of hydrogen peroxide, then hold it under
the steam jet, thoroughly dry and replace
on the cups immediately.
Weed Killer.
“Myrrhee”: Using the coal-tar deriva-
tive, sodium dinitro ortho cresylate, in
weed-killing experiments at its Werribee
State Farm, Victorian Department of
Agriculture found that a concentration of
1 in 80 applied at the rate of 100 gallons
to the acre completely disposed of cape
weed, Bathurst burr, shepherd’s purse,
radish, mustard, nightshade, chickweed
and thistles. A partial to complete kill
was made of fat hen, hog weed, sorrell,
marshmallow, burr medick and barley
grass, and a complete leaf kill, followed
by recovery of the plant, of dock,
plantain and hoary cress. Above-ground
portions of hoary cress were destroyed by
a concentration as low as 1 in 120. Crop
plants unaffected by the spray are flax,
wheat, oats, barley, peas, onions and
grasses. Susceptible crops are poppies,
beans, lucerne and clovers, and in the
seedling stage, rape and cabbage. The
effect of the spray on hoary cress sug-
gests a possible means of control, as no
plant, however tenacious, can withstand
repeated destruction of its leafage.
Cementing a Tank.
“Hydro”; First clean out the inside
thoroughly, taking care not to enlarge
small holes or weaken rusty spots. After
cleaning make a wash of neat cement and
water about the consistency of thick
paint and give the whole of the inside of
the tank a coat of this. Now begin at
the top and fill up all corrugations with


HAPPY RELIEF
FROM PAINFUL
BACKACHE
If backache and leg pains are making
you miserable, don't just complain
and do nothing about them. Nature
may be warning you that your kid-
neys need attention.
The kidneys are Nature's chief way
of taking excess acids and poisonous
waste out of the blood. They help
most people eliminate about 3 pints a
day.
If the 15 miles of kidney tubes and
filters don't work well, poisonous waste
matter stays in the blood. These
poisons may start nagging backaches,
rheumatic pains, leg pains, loss of pep
and energy, disturbed nights, swelling,
puffiness under the eyes, headaches
and dizziness. Frequent or poor kid-
ney action sometimes show there is
something wrong with your kidneys
or bladder.
Don't delay. Ask your chemist or
store for Doan's Backache Kidney Pills,
a stimulant diuretic, used successfully
by millions for over 40 years. Doan's

improving the quality of leather.
Herds protected by D.D.T. gained
32 per cent, more weight than un-
treated animals, and the milk supply
was increased by from 10 to 25 per

Preserving Farm Timber.
“Pat O’Day”: The decay of hardwood
timbers when used for shed and fence
posts, foundation blocks, etc., is usually
because they are set in position when
green. Therefore, seasoned wood should
be procured. A good method is to well
char these timbers from the bottom ends
to five or six inches over ground line and
then coat them with hot tar, allowing
this to set hard before placing the posts in
position.
A whiteant preventive is to clear all
stumps, roots and dead wood from the
building site, and plough the ground 6in.
deep where the building is to be erected.
The floors should be 24in. above the
ground, capping each support with tin or
galvanised-iron, projecting and turned
down at least 2in. all round.
Tobacco Seed Beds.
“Nick”: Where tobacco seedlings are
grown in open beds, as on irrigation
farms in N.Q., it does not pay to allow
the beds to dry out too much. The idea
of withholding watering so as to harden
the plants is justified only if beds are
under cover; when grown in the open
the plants are actually being hardened
all through their growing period, and
they absorb a lot of water. If allowed
to dry the plants wilt and expose the sur-
face of the bed to the sun’s rays. This
tends to kill off all the shallow-feeding
roots and causes long, troublesome tap-
roots. By keeping the beds well watered
a strong, vigorous stand of plants is
obtained.
If the bed is thoroughly soaked just
prior to lifting the plants each will pull
easily and bring with it a good lot of
soil on the roots. Make certain of lifting
only big plants; small ones will cause
trouble later on through having to be
reset. Now that the preparations con-
taining D.D.T. are available it is a good
plan to spray all the beds before lifting,
and this should last for at least two to
three weeks. Always water the beds after
plants have been lifted.
Hints for the Farm.
“Mr.”: Aim to prevent bloat by giving
the cows some dry feed before putting
them on young, green lucerne or succu-
lent, wet pasture ; place a straight iron
bit in the mouth of a susceptible cow
(kept in position with a halter), to prevent
it bolting its feed. In moderate cases
a dab of Stockholm tar on the back of
the tongue, will give some relief, helping
the animal to “belch.” If in a bad way,
puncture the paunch from the left side
with trocar and cannula, inserting the
instrument in a downward and forward
direction to its full length. Then with-
draw the trocar, holding the cannula
firmly in position to allow the gases to
escape.
“Bill C.”: Always remember to keep
beans well watered during the warm
months; it greatly increases the yield.
A spray of arsenate of lead will deter
possums or wallabies from eating the
plants. Two highly-recommended new
sorts are Wellington Wonder and Tweed
Wonder (bred by N.S.W. Agricultural
Department) for planting any time.
Hawkesbury Wonder, a bacteria and
blight resistant variety, and Staley’s Sur-
prise can be relied upon when sown in
late summer,
“Hist”: To cut ensilage out of a pit
or stack after you have knocked your-
self up using axe, broadaxe or hayknife,
try the gadget invented by a Cowra
(N.S.W.) man. Flatten one end of an
old crowbar, drill two holes in the
flattened face. Bolt on about 18in. of
old chaffcutter blade with the business
edge downwards —and there you are.
“F.L.”: Celery should be grown
quickly, and requires rich soil and warm
conditions. Stable manure worked deeply
into the soil makes a good bed, in which
the seedlings may be put out in shallow
trenches. Blanching by drawing the
leaves together and tying cylinders of
cardboard around the stalks takes about
a week. The plant thrives best when the
ground is kept moist.
“Myrrhee”: Risk of potato moth is
greatest when the weather is hot and dry,
particularly late in the season, when the
tubers need protection by covering with
about 4in. of soil thrown well around
the bases of the plants. At harvest, bag
the potatoes immediately after digging
and remove from the paddock as soon as
possible. If this isn’t convenient, cover
the bags with sacks. Don’t use potato
tops for this purpose ; they are very likely
to introduce the grubs to the clean tubers.
“Lub”: Asparagus does well in deep,
loamy soil, which is better trenched to
18in. and plenty of decayed vegetable
matter added. The crowns, one- or two-
year old preferred, are planted at a depth
of 6in., and no tips should be cut the
first year. Compost applied to the bed
in August each year is beneficial, and
the life of a well-cared-for bed may be
20 years or more. Ours, of Connover’s
Colossal, has been going strong for years,
and yields heavily for three months, be-
ginning in late September.
“E. 2”: Taints of certain kinds of vege-
tation in milk, cream and butter occur
when cows, have, access to the plants an
hour or two prior to milking. When
taint appears the best thing is to trace the
objectionable vegetable and confine the
herd’s grazing of it to an hoyr or two
after milking. In some seasons certain
kinds of clovers are notorious offenders,
but if milkers are yarded early the
“strong” flavor is a great deal less pro-
nounced.
“Sarina”: Runners of melons and
other vine vegetables should be nipped as
soon as they reach a length of 4ft. to
6ft.; sweet potato vines shouldn’t get
beyond 2ft. Dwarf beans should be
nipped as fast as they grow new tendrils.
Don’t think nipping the ends or tops
discourages the growth of plants. Actu-
ally it promotes branching and “bushing
out,” and the yield is invariably doubled.
“5.A.R.1.”: A mistake many new
gardeners make is to leave mature vege-
tables too long. Get them out of the
garden as soon as ready; leaving them
on the plants exhausts the latter, where
peas, beans and tomatoes are concerned,
and/or encourages insect pects. It also
delays the planting of a new and different
crop,
“W. Court”: I’ve been using that
dingo-poisoning trick of “S.G.’s” (B.
4/9/’46) for the last 15 years, but against
wallabies attacking sugarcane when grass
is scarce on the hills hereabouts. Mol-
asses and arsenic is what I put on the
wallaby trails. They’ll also take poisoned
molasses from meat-tins laid about the
fields after you’ve given them a go at
unpoisoned molasses.

Employment Vital in
Mr. O. D. A. Oberg
Post- War Planning
“Probably the most important phase of our post-
war planning is the matter of employment,” said
Mr. O. D. A. Oberg, President of the Australian
Council of Employers* Federations.
“Our obligations to our servicemen did not end
when they were brought home. From devoting
their thoughts and energies to the specialised
training of war, they cannot be expected to step
straight out of national service into civilian
employment,” he continued.
“Many of the younger ser-
vicemen have never known any
other occupation than soldier-
ing, and to lay the foundations
of their own and the commu-
nity’s future welfare, they must
be given vocational training.
“Others, who have spent many
years away from their former jobs,
must be offered the chance to
bring themselves up to date in their
trades and professions. At the same
time, returned servicemen have the
responsibility to adjust themselves
as rapidly as possible to the re-
quirements of civil life.”
Rehabilitation Costs Money
“All these plans require the en-
ergising power of money,” said Mr.
Oberg, “and the Second Security
Loan is the means of providing
that necessary and vital power.
“The necessity fully to subscribe
loans for rehabilitation and recon-
struction is basic for provision
against changing conditions in the
post-war period.”
Mr. Oberg said that by sound
finance, both employers and em-
ployees would guard against the
possibility of lower incomes in the
transitional period. “Employers,
having regard for development in
the years ahead, must think now of
the changes and improvements so
necessary for economic sufficiency.”

Fourteen years ago, Mr. B.
Hitcher, of North Perth, suffered
the amputation of a leg as the
result of a motor truck accident.
Faced with the problem of support-
ing himself and family, he took to
storekeeping.
From behind the counter of his
I small but prosperous grocery store
I in Forrest Street, North Perth, Mr.
I Hitcher told the story of how he
i was able to further benefit himself
and many of his customers through
Commonwealth Bonds.
Bond Sales Helped Win War
“When war broke out,” Mr.
Ritcher said, “I had a patriotic
desire to help Australia, and it
occurred to me that I could
play my part not only by buying
Bonds for myself, my wife and
two daughters, but also by as-
sisting the War Loans Organi-
sation to sell Bonds.”
“No harm to your business?”
queried the Commonwealth Inter-
viewer. “On the contrary,” smiled
Mr. Ritcher, “customers have since
expressed their appreciation of my
advice because they find themselves
much better off as a result.”
Mr. Ritcher produced a journal;
“This will give you some idea of
the applications for Bonds taken by
me in this shop and credited to the
North Perth district,” he said, run-
ning his finger down the column.
Bonds Best Place for Savings
“During the war,” continued this
keen loan worker, "most people
found themselves with a cash sur-
plus owing to commodity shortages.
Rather than buy unwanted articles
of doubtful value, I saw no better
place for my money than in Bonds
at increased interest rates over
that being earned in the bank, and
as I knew I could cash my Bonds
at any time, I bought them with
all the surplus cash I had.”
“Are you still recommending
Bonds to your customers?” Mr.
Ritcher was asked.
“Of course, I am,” he replied,
“goods are still in short supply and
prices are high. So I tell my cus-
tomers to put their money into
Bonds now, and then, later on,
they’ll get much better values. It’s
just good business, I say, because
those Bonds will be earning better
than bank interest all the time.”
Two Advance Subscriptions
“And while you’re here,” Mr.
Ritcher continued, taking a slip
from his journal, “this is the name
and address of a customer who
wants to make an advance sub-
scription to the Second Security
Loan.
“And you’d better take my own
advance subscription, too.”
Plans for the Future
“My ambition has been to rebuild
this store—that is, when building
restrictions are eased,” said Mr.
Ritcher, discussing his plans for
the future. “I have got it both
ways,” he added, laughingly. “I
believe in making my money work
for me, and the interest on my
Bonds will certainly purchase many
bricks for my new building.”

An Inspector of Nuisances
By F. L. COMBS
AT bottom Lem Slipper’s was a
simple nature. His strength and his
weakness was a passion for justice,
and he was most concerned for the
justice that ought to be done to Lem
Slipper.
He had no particular trade, nor was
he handy ; he was, however, enterprising,
and tried many things: a market garden
(a failure), a bit of auctioneering (a flash
in the pan), a wood and coal business
(ruined by those cows his suppliers), a
butchery. The butchery, perhaps, de-
serves a paragraph.
Lem got his meat from a cocky and,
going from door to door, sold it two-
pence a pound cheaper than did Paka
Puki’s two tradesmen established in that
line. There were matters such as inspec-
tion and a licence that Lem had failed
to fix up. The local tradesmen (his own
words) made a dead set on Lem, and
Constable Gillick was compelled to nip
Lem’s meat round in the bud,
Lem set afoot an agitation. He began
by standing in front of S. O’Brien’s
Family Butchery in the main street
(“Only Prime Ox Beef and Best Wether
Mutton”) and handing out leaflets which
told the pitiful story of the graft'that
had been too much for him.
When S. O’Brien returned from the
Cri. Lem accosted him and handed him
a leaflet. S. O’Brien read it and asked
for another to put up in the shop. These
ju-jitsu tactics were too .much for poor
Lem. He passed the leaflets on to his
eldest son, a growing edition of himself,
and went off to A 1 Peters’s barbering
saloon to engage in a furious discussion
as to whether the shooting season for
ducks began on May 1 at midnight or
on May 2 at dawn.
Now, Paka Puki has its good points.
It will put up with a lot from a man who
is down, and even do something for him
if it is not too much trouble.
What, then, could Paka Puki do for
this wrong-headed, obstructive idiot of a
Slipper now that he was down and out?
It so happened that the inspectorship of
nuisances in the Borough fell vacant, and
eight councillors, all of whom disliked
Lem more or less heartily, voted him into
it and raised its emoluments by £25 a
year.
LEM proved the best inspector of
nuisances Paka Puki had ever had,
and also the biggest nuisance. He was
fearless, zealous, energetic and interfer-
ing. He loved authority, particularly
when legal powers went with it, and,
forming a plan, he set about cleaning up
the town.
He tackled Smedley’s Crisp Crust
Bakery first. The Crisp Crust’s back
premises were interesting. The floor was
bored with a dozen rat holes. When you
entered you heard a hasty scurrying.
Hardly had the agreeable warmth of the
oven reached you when from every hole
you saw gleaming eyes watching you.
The rats, having recovered from the
slight alarm caused by an intruding
stranger, had come back to reconnoitre.
Midge Smedley, a little man, had become
used to the way things were. He would
sometimes permit lads with pea-rifles to
come into the bakery and get what sport
they could.
Lem Slipper came down on Midge like
a thousand of bricks. Midge, a weakling,
yielded ; whereupon, Lem, placated as he
always was by anyone who gave soft
answers, put in half a week at the Crisp
Crust concreting the rat runs and patch-
ing the floor.
But the next thing Lem tackled caused
friction. It was a general clean-up of
the backyards of all business premises.
Here was something wholesale which in-
volved the handling of some awkward
problems, including three ’councillors.
The councillors ignored the officious little
squirt, the blooming little upstart, till Lem,
over the reluctant hand of the Town
Clerk, served them with notices.
S. O’Brien, a shrewd man and a cool-
headed one, tidied up his back premises
without waiting for a visit from Lem.
He knew what the new inspector thought
of him.
Then, as the biggest challenge to his
official probity, Lem tackled the Mayor.
He was the only man who ever got the
better of Am Mills, and Arn, with the
three councillors already mentioned, de-
termined to end his tyranny. At first the
plan was to sack Lem Slipper at the
eagerly awaited end of his first year of
office, but nothing so simple could be
done. There was the risk of an action
for wrongful dismissal, and there was
also a faction headed by old Sam
Turton. Sombre Sam said “The man is
only doing his job.”
The alternative plan was drastically to
reduce Lem’s salary. It was done by six
votes to four. Now at last Lem had
something he could sink his teeth into.
At first he carried on an acrid campaign
in the paper. Everyone enjoyed this for
a week and then became tired of it.
O UT Lem was versatile. He took to
attending the fortnightly meetings of
the council, heretofore an unheard-of
thing; for over a decade the council had
deliberated without a solitary spectator,
the only evidence of a non-official pre-
sence being the knocking of the hind leg
of the Mayor’s retriever on the floor as
he dealt with the particular kind of
nuisance that afflicts even the least fas-
tidious of dogs.
Now here was the council’s own hire-
ling, their inspector of nuisances, watch-
ing them from 8 p.m. till 10 or 11 p.m.
with an unblinking and vindictive stare
and frequently taking notes of what they
did. Next day there would be an account
given of what Mills and his crowd were
up to at A 1 Peters’s or at Sim Burgoyne’s
stables. The press (one editor and one
reporter) was annoyed, too, because after
every council meeting they received
letters from Lem Slipper amplifying
and/or correcting their slipshod reports
or criticising the civic policy pursued by
the council.
What came of it? What would one
expect to come of this indomitable pur-
pose of one man with nothing better to
do than to harrass the days of ten very
busy men? Judicious go-betweens were
chosen ; Mrs. Slipper was privately in-
terviewed. This surprising woman, it
seemed, preferred that her husband
should have one real job rather than
give his time disinterestedly to those
noblest of causes, justice to the subject
and honor in public life.
This is how from being an inspector
of nuisances whose fidelity to duty
was beyond reproach, Lem Slipper
became caretaker of the racecourse at
twice the salary, plus house. At the race-
course he is disliked, but appreciated, for
no one can deny but that he and his
living image, young Lem, have taken up
the slack of all sorts of things his prede-
cessor let slide.
The rats, too, are glad Lem has gone
to the racecourse; they are back at the
Crisp Crust Bakery thicker than ever.

Discussing the case with some of his
legal friends at the end of Quarter Ses-
sions after his client, “Knockem”
Wrottan, notorious underworld figure,
had been sentenced to 10 years’ hard
labor for armed robbery and attempted
murder, Mr. Snootie, K.C., confessed that
he was becoming uneasy about “Knock-
em’s” chances.
“The fact,” said the eminent Gent
One, “that seventeen witnesses swore
they saw him fire at and wound the
watchman, combined with my client’s*
boast from the dock that if his ‘rod’
' hadn’t jammed after he’d fired two shots
he’d have filled him full of lead, may
well raise doubts in the juiy’s mind as to
whether the accused is as innocent as he
may seem. Also, his admission that he
‘flogged’ some of the stuff he pinched to
a ‘fence’ could possibly mean that the
jury might even cpnsider that he could
not entirely be exonerated from the
charge of robbery. If I were a betting
man I don’t think, at this stage at all
events, that I would be prepared to lay
more than moderate odds on his being
acquitted.”
Interviewed by a representative of the
‘Daily Twister’ last night at the Stadium,
Joe Hardclock, manager for the pro-
minent lightweight Home Nelson (you
remember he recently changed his name
by deed poll from Manny Rosenstein)
said that, taking everything into con-
sideration, he wasn’t building on too
many hopes that his client would take
the title from the champ., ‘Gorilla’
Gardiner.
“Mind you,” said Joe, “I don’t admit
the champ.’s any better than Home. He
isn’t. But he’s stronger, his ringcraft’s
superior, he’s got a longer reach, better
stamina, and he’s a born fighter, whereas
Home’s purely and simply a boxer, as
you could see by the way he couldn’t take
the toe-to-toe stuff tonight when ‘Gorilla’
went berserk in the second round. Never-
theless, we’re hopin’ for a points verdict.
Now you’ll excuse me for a bit—l gotta
go an’ see the Stadium quack an’ find out
if Home’s come to yet.” t
Commenting on the one-man exhibi-
tion he has been holding at the Dauber
Galleries, Radcliffe Ratbagge, the sur-
realist artist, said it was rather early yet
to finally determine whether it had turned
out a financial success. One visitor at
least had seen the exhibition; the artist
remembered this distinctly as the visitor
had stood in front of his masterpiece
“Love in a Tannery” and couldn’t stop
laughing ; this afforded definite proof that
he was vitally interested —and it was only
interested people who bought good paint-
ings. Still, although none of the rest
of the canvasses had been bought either
and the exhibition was now closed, he
thought his chances of buying a yacht
and a Rolls Royce from the proceeds of
the exhibition, while riot altogether ex-
tinguished, could not now be considered
quite as bright as they had been.
“Yes,” said the amateur* fisherman, as
he began excitedly hauling in his line,
“this one feels like a sixteen-pound
snapper—probably closer to twenty
pounds, I’d say, by the fight he’s putting
up. Be ready with the landing net,
Charlie, but don’t try to get it under him
until I’ve got him right alongside the
boat. He’s coming up now much easier
than I expected—skulldragging him in so
quickly I’ve probably drowned him.”
He peered anxiously over the side as he
hauled in the last few yards of line;
then he sat down and began taking the
mass of seaweed off the hook. “I
wouldn’t exactly say I haven’t hooked
that twenty-five pounder, Charlie,” he
confided to his cobber, a faint hope re-
flected on his face. “I’ve still got to find
out yet what’s under this stuff!”

In Papua
Anyone who suggests that Santa Claus
is a myth should visit Papua—if he can ;
most ’planes and the few ships that come
here are flat out bringing Government
officials said to be necessary to imple-
ment the new order.
We have the Production Control
Board, although I don’t know what it
controls except the funds of the producer
compelled to sell his produce to it.
And now we have a new one, the
Shipping Directorate. What its function
is is not yet clear, but the ships it con-
trols have been handed over to the old
pre-war firms who act as agents—on a
cost-plus basis —and freights and fares
have been pushed up 20 and 40 per
cent, respectively. The local producer
knows, from pre-war experience and the
present elaborate set-up, that freights and
fares will have to go much higher to
balance expenditure against revenue. The
alternative is a subsidy. That will prob-
ably be Mr. Ward’s solution.
In pre-war days the best that this Aus-
tralian Territory could do was a loan
of £40,000 yearly. Purposely, it was not
always availed of. Now one department
only—Native Affairs —will absorb more
than that amount. And Native Affairs
is the smallest of Lord-knows-how-many
more such departments.
In pre-war days, when this country
was producing 10,000 tons of copra and
1800 tons of rubber, the whole business
—supplies out and produce in, together
with accounts and all relevant details—
was handled by not more than 10 men
attached to the local commercial firms.
And in those days our shipping and
realisation costs were a fraction of what
they are today.
We haven’t a vote and we don’t pay
Australian income tax but we cling to
the idea that we are Australians. Still,
we get a lot of fun in realising that the
laugh is on the Australian taxpayer. —

Darwin Homes
“Territorian” (B. 25/9/’46) states that
“Houses built [in Darwin] before the
war were cool, airy and conditioned to
tin climate.” I’ll not deny there may
have been one or two such houses, but
in the main Darwin houses of my ex-
perience were anything but cool and
airy, and I’m blessed if they had been
set in beautiful gardens.
Around Parap and other places the
houses were built close to the ground
and the main building material seemed
to be corrugated iron. There are very
few modern buildings in Darwin a
hotel, a bank and about half a dozen
houses; the rest are mainly dumps.
“Territorian’s” winges are symptomatic
of the reaction of most people to any-
thing new. Until the change is com-
pleted it is never any good, but when
it is accomplished he and others like
him wonder why and how they ever
endured the old conditions.
Darwin needs planning and developing
with modern scientific housing. Obvi-
ously the Goverhment should do it—
previous owners had long endigh to try.
Incidentally, the best design for a N.T.
home I ever saw was 200 miles from
Darwin —on the banks of the Daly river.
—Darwinian (N.S.W.).
Victorian Local Government
Melbourne’s Lord Mayor recently an-
nounced that it would give him very
much pleasure to see “Victoria’s 200
municipalities boiled down to 12 regional
councils.” The only reason advanced by
him was that London’s County Council
has prepared a plan for rebuilding Lon-
don, and that Melbourne’s development
is hindered by the multiplicity of coun-
cils and councillors.
The argument sinks at the first step.
London is being rebuilt because it has
to be, having been badly knocked about
in the last six years. No Victorian towns
have suffered war damage, and their
steady development lies in the hands of
those citizens who are most closely con-
cerned with their progress. In any case
there is a Town Planning Authority for
Melbourne metropolitan area.
The whole proposal indicates a danger
to local government. The issue is not
whether reasonable uniformity and har-
monious relations between public authori-
ties shall prevail in a given area—such
benefits can best be secured through
voluntary co-operation. It is a question
of whether the administration of local-
govemment affairs shall be taken away
from citizens who have a thorough and
intimate knowledge of the small com-
munity they serve, and vested in a coterie
which cannot possibly know or care
about more than a fraction of its ad-
ministrative area.
Generally speaking, few bodies do
better jobs in this country than the muni-
cipal councils. They are kept up to the
mark by the. close pressure of their fellow-
townsfolk, who can approach them indi-
vidually when grievances are to be aired
or suggestions made for improvements.
But what chance would the residents of
any suburban street or country hamlet
have of securing their civic rights if their
sole “representative” was a personally un-
known member of an all-powerful
“regional council”?
Better the occasional lapses and paro-
chialisms of suburban and provincial
councils than the evils resulting from the
autocratic and remote control of regional
councils and the like.-—D. J. G. (Vic.).
Back-door Socialism
Queensland’s Labor Government has
given birth to a remarkable infant in the
shape of the Co-operative Societies’ Bill.
Under its provisions any seven people
may form a trading co-op., vested with
power to “take over” the buildings and
resume the land of any existing business
undertaking, subject only to the Minister’s
approval. Needless to say, it is claimed
that such Ministerial approval will only
be forthcoming where it is “in the public
interest.” And who decides what is the
public interest? Why, the Minister—or
Caucus.
It is also explained that there is to be
no confiscation. Only the buildings and
land can be “acquired,” the victim being
permitted to keep his stock, plant and
even his trading name. Thus an ob-
streperous fellow like Peter Dargin would
be allowed to carry his block, chopper
and meat to the nearest spreading chest-
nut-tree and resume business, perhaps
applying for accommodation under the
Government housing scheme.
Even Ministers seem hazy about the
thing. Although the great majority of
co-ops. distribute their surpluses to cus-
tomers, the emphasis is here being placed
on profit-sharing among employees—
which, incidentally, the Bill does not
specifically provide for, merely fixing
a maximum rate of dividend. It- is
claimed that the legislation will remove
the wicked profit motive and relieve
sweated workers so that industrial unrest
will disappear. Somebody pointed out
that the recent strike (Queensland’s worst)
started in a co-op. factory and extended
to others, the chief sufferer being the
publicly-owned and -controlled abattoir.
But the spectacle of “the workers”
whacking up the profits is being played
for all it is worth.
Few people fail to admire the accom-
plishments of co-op. enterprises all over
the world. One thing the successful ones
seem to have in common is their sturdy
independence of Government patronage
and their triumph over adversity. In
other words, the requisites for success are
initiative, enterprise, honesty and hard
work—exactly the same as those needed
for successful private enterprise. But this
Queensland idea is blatant back-door
Socialism, brought down with the evident
objective of placating those who howl
for the implementation of “Labor policy!”
— J. A. Spence (Toowong, Q.).
Army Doctors
While I sympathise with “R.M.0.” (B.
11/9/’46), he should remember that he
was not enlisted in the A.I.F. to gain
clinical experience. As a medical officer,
he was required to use his ability in what-
ever appointment senior medical officers
determined. At any rate he was at least
fortunate in being able to follow his
profession while in the Army. Foot-
sloggers, sappers and sigs. had to aban-
don their professions and trades for the
best part of six years.— Pubserv (S.A.).
For Publishers
The other day I bought a thin paper-
covered story book for my six-year-old.
It was a job with five
large colored plates, but ran to only 12
pages. The price charged by the Mel-
bourne bookshop was eightpence. When
I glanced at the back cover I found that
it was printed in Great Britain, and that
the price in that country was 2|d.
I’m not complaining. There are, no
doubt, reasons for the high price charged
by the Melbourne bookseller. But if a
really excellent little book can be printed
in England to sell at in that coun-
try, then Australian publishers should be
capable of producing something at least
as good technically and with stronger
local appeal for sixpence or less.
Unfortunately, Australian publishers
seem unable or unwilling to turn out
children’s books at a price below that of
their handicapped overseas competitors.
If they don’t soon do so, they’ll lose the
advantages they have gained during the
past five or six years.— Wusslean (Vic.).
Literary Supplements
“Obelist” (B. 18/ 9/’46) will be glad to
hear that his idea of reprinting classics
in the press has been successfully tested.
Some years ago an Adelaide daily ran
Oliver Twist as a serial. Schoolchildren
were invited to write essays on the
current instalments, and weekly prizes
were awarded.
Finally the heat-winners were asked
to sit for examination under test con-
ditions and were required to write an
impromptu imaginary “interview” with
Oliver—the prize, a job on the newspaper
staff. Ultimately two girls were
placed and both have justified their
appointments.
Thousands of readers were introduced
to Dickens for the first time. Hundreds
of youngsters were encouraged to try
their ’prentice hands in literary ex-
pression. Teachers were assisted in what
probably is their most difficult task, and
a good time was had by all.. The thing
is capable of endless modification, and is
the most practical attempt I have seen to
raise the standard of reading matter
delivered at our doors for family con-
sumption.—N. W. S. (S.A.).
Books and Children
Contrary to “Tom” (B. 18/9/’46), most
young Australians do prefer comic strips
to decent books. I don’t claim that the
younger generation neglects good litera-
ture entirely, but I’ve yet to meet the
kid who would read Grahame’s Wind in
the Willows in preference to “Buck
Rogers” or “Superman.”
“Tom” bases his argument that “there
is rarely a book of good literary value
left on the shelves of a children’s library”
on the war-time years when comic strips
were as rare as cigarette papers are
today. Profuse reading of the Yankee
“bovril” is a stage through which almost
every average youngster passes without
ill effects.
Incidentally,' I know of a case in
which the so-called corrupting literature
did more good than harm. A young
country lad, whose parents lived miles
from the nearest school, was being taught
with the aid of correspondence lessons.
He got along admirably until it came to
reading, and his worried parents were
advised to try him on comic strips. With
the cartoons as a guide, the youngster
soon got over his trouble and, although
he still likes the worded sketches, he is
now an ardent reader of Treasure Island
and kindred literature.
But why blame comic strips on
children? I’ve noticed plenty of adults
turn to the strip as soon as they buy a
paper.— The Falcon (N.S.W.).
Trees, Drought, Erosion
“Atrax” (B. 4/9/’46) states that
Queensland has a statute, requiring land-
owners to obtain official sanction before
ringbarking trees on their holdings, which
is not enforced.
That law applies only to land held
under leasehold tenure. It is enforced —
“And these are our before and after models .”
by the Lands Department. Permission to
ringbark timbers of no commercial value
is granted, subject to a 10 p.c. restriction
for shade. The owner of freehold land
can do what he likes with his timber.
But every endeavor *is being made to
preserve the millable timber on Crown
lands. To read “Cadaagi” (B. 18/9/’46),
anyone would think that the Forestry
Departmentwa^doin^nothin^owards
re-establishing depleted forests. Actually
it is replanting thousands of acres as
well as buying many properties carrying
millable timber which were sold by the
Crown years before it was dreamed that
there would be a shortage.
There are still millions of acres in
Queensland which have never been ring-
barked. The proportion rung is a mere
bagatelle to what is not rung. There are
also millions of feet of good hardwoods
and cypress pine in the Carnarvon
Ranges, north of Roma and Mitchell,
which will remain in reserve until good
access is provided.
“Atrax” implies that trees prevent
erosion, but that only applies in hilly to
mountainous country. In the flat coun-
try which forms the greater part of
Queensland the great bulk of the timber
is of no commercial value. The ring-
barking of such useless timbers increases
the body of grass which binds the soil
much better than tree roots. Grass, also,
does not take so much out of the ground
as trees, both in nourishment and water.
Consequently rung country stands up to
a dry spell much better than green
timbered country.
This brings me to “G.A.B.’s” article
(B. 18/9/’46) on droughts, which are
mostly man-made by overstocking. And
overstocking, as I know, is defended by
landowners, large and small.
To the man with large areas, hand-
feeding with grain or any other fodder
is not economical, nor is it possible at
present to obtain fodder for large flocks
of sheep or cattle. The only solution
is understocking, which is being practised
already by a small minority of owners
who have discovered that they can obtain
as much wool off 10,000 well-grown and
well-fed sheep as they got off 15,000
under - grown and under - nourished
animals. These men have also discovered
that droughts cause them very little worry
or losses compared with their neighbors
who overstock in an attempt to make
money quickly.
During the last month I have met two
sheepowners, both from drought-stricken
western Queensland, who state that their
sheep are still fat and losses practically
nil because they are lightly stocked. They
gave heed to the old bush saying “Over-
stock, no profit ; understock, full profit.”
The biggest cause of erosion is not the
wind, but heavy storm rains washing
away the top soil which has been ground
to a powder by overstocking. It is the
most difficult form of erosion to prevent,
particularly on large holdings, because
the areas are too big for any preventive
measures except understocking.—L. C.
(Q-). " ’
Road Safety
The rising tide of accidents on roads
in N. S. Wales indicates that the stage
will soon be reached where two people
are killed every day. In the six months
to July 31, 1946, there were 6551 acci-
dents, resulting in 4974 injured and 308
killed —as to nearly 50 p.c., ■ killed at
night.
Road-accident figures have increased
all over the world since the war ended.
A U.S.A. survey disclosed that the ratio
of night to day fatalities is even greater
there than here, and it was found that
one of the major causes was poor road
visibility. Now nearly £100,000,000 is to
be spent on 50,000 miles of roads, and
millions of new and improved light fix-
tures are to be installed.
Proper road lighting can mean a.
tremendous difference to the night-acci-
dent rate, as can the installation ot
scientific anti-glare lights. Isn t it tune
something similar was done in Australia


Honors and Awards
While the system can never be perfect
—many heroic deeds are unseen and
therefore remain unhonored, and so many
deeds are performed in battle that the
number of awards must be far less than
the citations submitted some reforms
are overdue. For instance, the announce-
ment of. awards might be speeded up.
The news of a decoration has an elec-
trifying effect on morale, but it is
usually received when the campaign is
over. Furthermore, when periodical
awards are being prepared, a C.O, tends
to omit a soldier whom he has already
recommended for an immediate award.
Should the immediate fail to be approved,
the soldier has also lost his chance of
a periodical. We might well adopt a
modified form of the American policy
of allowing a divisional commander to
award a limited number of decorations
without reference to higher authority.
Some C.Os., anxious to maintain the
high status of an award, underwrite the
citation. Others, not less anxious to be
fair, have the ability to produce a brief
citation which brings out the nature of
the gallantry with great vividness and
effect. The answer might well be for
the G.O.C. to investigate personally all
recommendations submitted from within
his division, and for him to write the
citation which goes on to higher authority.
Without trying to undervalue the im-
portance of good staff work, I suggest
that there should be a clear line of
demarcation between decorations awarded
for gallantry and decorations awarded
for planning—no matter how brilliant the
latter might have been. The D.S.O. and
M.C. should be kept exclusively for per-
sonal gallantry in the field, and a new
decoration should be created for those
whose staff work and planning call for
special recognition.
Finally, each citation should mentio
the number of previous occasions o
which the soldier has been recommendec
for an award. A “near miss” in an
earlier campaign might well be the de
ciding factor when a borderline case i
being considered. — Peter Mike (W.A.).
Interim Air Force
The announcement that the strength
of the Interim Air Force has been fixec
at 15,000 is very interesting when taken
with Air Board’s statement tha
W.A.A.A.F. disbandment has been post
poned to December 31.
Originally the strength of the interim
air force was to be 20,000, so recruiting
must be going father badly. Is it any
wonder?
Who would want to join some
thing for two years with no guarantee o::
a place in the permanent air force? Tha;
sort of a job is only likely to appea
to those who cannot see what they want
in civil life or who have no confidence
in their own ability to hold a civvy job
If the Government wants to make certain
it gets all the misfits of the war-time
R.A.A.F. it is going the right way
about it.
Why an interim air force, anyway?
It would be much better to enlist 10,000
on a permanent basis, selecting the best
material available so that there would be
something solid to build on. The finest
types are not going to join a service
without a future and it’s common know-
ledge that most of the best men have
left the R.A.A.F.— Recco (N.S.W.).
The Merchant Navy
“1.A.C.” (B. 25/9/’46) is more fortu-
nate than he thinks in being persuaded
from joining the merchant service while
young enough to take up a more worth-
while career.
The difficulty in finding replacements
for retiring masters and officers is
mythical—usually supplies are too plenti-
ful because of the practice of carrying
apprentices for cheap labor in overseas
ships. I’ve yet to hear of a ship not
sailing for want of an officer of any
department or rank.
The Australian merchant seaman
doesn’t study for “tickets.” There is no
incentive—becoming an officer often re-
sults in a drop in income. As third in
command I’ve sometimes drawn less than
cooks, firemen and others. Also an
officer is subject to more discipline.
Training in other countries is on a
small scale. In pre-war days Germany
led with seagoing school ships in which
every aspect of the job was taught with
Teutonic thoroughness. Finland had a
sailing fleet manned by apprentices who
paid a premium for every voyage. The
U.S.A. brought in a training scheme
during the war, when it changed from
an almost shipless country to the owner
of the world’s greatest fleet —it will be
interesting to see if the scheme is con-
tinued. Britain has a few training estab-
lishments, mostly more expensive than an
officer’s career warrants.
Heaven forbid that Australia should
man ships with future officers only! It
would overflow the labor market, and I
cannot see the Commo.-controlled sea-
men’s union letting the shipowner get
away with *it. — Tackline S. (N.S.W.).
After the Show
Lud Mayor Connelly, of Melbourne,
has been urging a “Brighter Sunday.”
He might devote some of his energies to
working for a Royal Show at which
people will not be stung,
A child showed me a balloon, worth
about threepence, for which he had been
charged half-a-crown. Another showed
me an imitation diabolo made of rags
and paper for which he had' paid three
shillings. And there were bitter com-
plaints about food.
People who went in for the most
expensive dinner came out minus 4s. and
still hungry. You don’t expect to get
fish at an agricultural show, but you
would expect to get fruit. You can get
“Frankforts-an’-rolls” at any time of the
night in Melbourne, but they were un-
obtainable at the Show at 10.30, and a
cold pie and cup of tea cost one and
threepence until supplies ran out. Break-
fast for animal attendants and stable
boys was 3s. 6d., if they could get it.
It is the fairs and markets, at which
you can get magnificent food, that make
the gaiety and brightness of Europe. The
only bright thing about the Melbourne
Show was the beer, which seemed to be
exhaustless. —Q. Q. (Vic.).
These Bureaucrats
While “T.P.M.” and fellow-bureaucrats
(B. 11/9/’46) are busy polishing their
haloes, I would like to add a footnote to
his letter telling of the overtime worked
gratis by Federal public servants durin
the war. ' ,
It was recently reported that one of th
public service unions had applied t
the Government for pay for overtim
worked by its members “voluntarily
during the war, and was likely to receiv
it ! — Eagle (Q.),
Diggers* Homes
Why are civilians entitled to 50' pe
cent, of the Government houses erectec
in this State? While the soldiers were
away civilians had ample time and oppor
tunity to secure suitable dwellings, anc
the number who tenanted servicemen’s
houses in their absence would be more
than covered by an allocation of 25 per
cent.
It’s a bitter pill indeed for the returnee
soldier when he sees men who did no
join the services moving from their war-
time dwellings into new State houses
while ex-soldiers wearily pound the pave-
ment in search of shelter for their
families.
Another glaring injustice to returned
men is the ruthless land-grabbing cam-
paign of the Housing Commission. This
has deprived intending builders of all the
most suitable sites and, incidentally,
opened a lucrative field for another
pestilence—the land-racketeer.—V, A. M
(N.S.W.).
“Bo” and Borers
I am an admirer of “Bo” ; no matter
the irony and fun, he shows the Bolshe-
vik in barebone coloring. But in his post-
mortem on the sudden death in Moscow
of a recent Soviet Ambassador at
Ottawa “Bo” reported the deceased “full
of holes, caused by borers with which
the victim became infected while travers-
ing the Californian redwood belt.”
Californian redwood is the one wood
the borers always pass up, just as they
very often pass up your excellent jarrah.
—Junius (Alamo, California).
Our Future Scientists
The statement, quoted by “Screwball,”
that “the Empire is faced with a lack of
scientific leaders” was not made, as he
asserts, by the chairman of the CS.tR.
In a country which did such magnificent
scientific work in the war (and “Screw-
ball” was, right in putting the Empire as
No. 1 of the four leading scientific
nations), there can obviously not be a
lack of leaders ; one has only to think
of Dale, Hill, Robinson, Sidgwick, Tizard,
Egerton, Appleton, Mellanby, Oliphant,
Watson, Watt, Chadwick, Cockcroft,
Florey, and a score of others, who could
readily be named, to see how wrong it
is to suggest any lack.
Where there is difficulty is in finding
adequate numbers of first-class and ex-
perienced young men to fill the high posts
under the leaders. We have a leeway of
six years to make up during which so
many potential scientists were perforce
drafted into other lines *of work. The
shortage makes itself particularly felt
when people like ourselves look to Britain
to help us fill some of our own senior
posts. This, however, is a very different
matter from implying that there is a lack
of leadership of a high order, despite
such serious losses as Rutherford and
Bragg.— Research (Vic.),
“Screwball” (B. 18/9/’46) deals very
capably with the shortage of scientists
till he comes to the question of employ-
ing German experts. He asks “What
real difference is there between the man
who dropped the bombs and the man
who made them?”
Morally there may not be much dif-
ference, but the question is not one of
morals. What makes all the difference
in the world is whether the bombs are
made for us or against us. We have no
objection to the use of German formulae
“They must he feeding her too much grit, Rupert—
that's another china one."
or blueprints either in medicine or
mechanised warfare. What real differ-
ence is there between the inventions and
the brains that produce them? The
brains are on offer. Shall we secure
them or make a present of them to
potential enemies?
If any German scientist could show
the answer to influenza or atomic bombs
he would be welcomed with open arms
in any capital city he chose to visit, his
dossier notwithstanding. So why not give
jobs to his countrymen with lesser but
still valuable credentials? — Pilate (S.A.).
Culture
Cultural standards cannot be gauged
by numbering the public libraries
throughout the land —people may fre-
quent them and still be uncultured. In
fact, ( culture consists not in the extent to
which people are acquainted with litera-
ture but in the extent to which literature
influences opinions and behavior.
Classical literature, the most fruitful
source of refining sentiments, is a barren
field to those who don’t know how to
read discriminately and profit from their
reading—those who derive enjoyment but
not lasting benefit. It is one thing to read
for present pleasure and another matter
to reflect and govern behavior in accord-
ance with the sentiments one accepts.
The influence of classical literature on
individual culture is, or should be, strong.
Literature which gains classical eminence
is distinguished in that it exemplifies and
commends to the reader the desirable
social qualities of courage, kindliness,
courtesy, co-operation, justice, industry,
sympathy and humor, qualities which the
individual must develop in acquiring a
cultured personality.
There is a pitiable type of person who
speaks affectedly of celebrated writers and
pretends a close acquaintance with their
works, yet reflects in his personality no
refinement of ideas and manners. Such
a person is either insincere or has fallen
into the error of believing culture to be
ability to discourse on literature in
familiar terms; actually, it is the intel-
lectual benefits which derive from.>an ap-
preciative study of literature. — Blue (Q.).
“Sentiment in Business”
I doubt that there’s much sentiment
in business (B. 25/9/’46). Trot out the
competition and bang goes the sentiment.
“Samson” has given his trade to certain
shops over many years, but if another
fruit shop opens up over the road and
it sells better oranges, what would he
do? If he is honest with his desires and
his stomach, he will buy the better
oranges from the rival shop. If he
doesn’t, he is displaying a brand of
loyalty akin to prejudice, not sentiment.
If he goes back to his old cobber after
shopping with the-newcomer he’ll get a
very cold reception, thus proving that
there is no sentiment in business) There
is only sentiment born of years of friend-
ship through dealing with the same
people. Take your support away and
make the whole affair entirely one of
business, with the customer dealing only
he gets the best, and warfare is
declared at once. Eve Merritt
(N.S.W.).
Schistosomiasis
Recent alarmist statements concerning
health-risks to Australian troops in Japan
from schistosomiasis—usually mis-spelt—
can be heavily discounted. Prevention
and treatment of the disease are
thoroughly well understood and pro-
phecies of certain death within five or six
years for those who contract it are utter
nonsense.
Its primary cause is a fluke which has
completed its larval stage in certain
species of water-snails just as does the
sheep fluke. The snail is infected by free-
swimming larvae hatched from eggs
passed in the body discharges of a human
sufferer. Some six weeks later infective
free-swimming forms develop to
maturity, escape from the snail’s body
into water, and penetrate the skin of any-
one with whom they there come in con-
tact. Reaching a blood vessel they are
carried eventually to the liver, where they
become fully adult.
Human schistoso-
miasis is widely spread
in Egypt, Africa, tropi-
cal South America,
China and Japan, Cal-
cified eggs of the
present - day parasite
have been found in the
kidneys of an Egyptian
mummy over 3000 years
old. The three species
produce somewhat dif-
ferent effects. The
Japanese-Chinese one,
known also as Kata-
yama disease and
Yangtse fever, affects
particularly the liver
and spleen; the others
mainly the bladder and
intestines.
If reinfection is prevented, treatment
with tartar emetic, in which the antimony
is the effective agent, clears up the great
majority of cases. This also cleans up the
eggs in carriers and renders them in-
capable of infecting water. To avoid in-
fection, only filtered water should be
used for bathing, and if it is necessary to
enter possibly infected water all exposed
skin must be protected by canvas or other
close-woven material. Water-snails can
be got rid of by a mixture of powdered
copper sulphate and fine sand sprayed as
a dust over the edges of streams and
ponds.
After the 1914-18 war it was found that
a number of returned Diggers who had
been infected in Egypt were still carrying
larvae, and also that certain Australian
water-snails were suitable for continuing
development of the parasites passed by
them. Careful tracing and treatment of
every infected man enabled the risk to
be overcome. As yet, no focus has be-
come established in the Austral-Pacific
area, and the splendid work of the
A.A.M.C. through the war years pro-
vides sufficient guarantee against such a
disaster in the future. — Galenus (Q.). '
* ‘Standardisation’ ’
An economist, Professor Hytten, has
recently criticised the Standardisation of
Railway Gauges Bill, saying that it would
impose a financial burden on the country
of £BOO,OOO a year for interest charged
against the Railways Department con-
cerned and £BOO,OOO a year against the
Commonwealth Government. The pro-
fessor allows that there would be a sav-
ing of £50,000 per year for elimination
of transfer costs at break-of-gauge points
in N.S.W., Victoria and South Australia.
The correct figure is £105,000 a year.
I can list 15 arguments for standardisa-
tion, the most important being the eco-
nomic advantage of “fluidity”—the free
movement of rolling stock to meet such
special demands as harvest gluts,
droughts and the like. It applies also to
passenger trains, such as the Spirit of
Progress, at present idle 69 "p.c. of its time.
With a unified line between Melbourne
and Sydney and used about 14 hours daily
it would double its earning capacity. With
a “fluid” system and the elimination of
the idle-truck problem at breaks of gauge
the railways could get 20 p.c. to 25 p.c.
extra use from their rolling stock, with
a corresponding increase in revenue. —
G. B. (N.S.W.).
The Farmer’s Pay
“H.L.” (B. 25/9/’46) would have
carried more weight had he not admitted
that he had been in turn a dairy-,
poultry-, wheat- and sheep-farmer. Ob-
viously he has still to try fruit-growing.
I suggest that when he has made his
fortune at it he visit the Wimmera, where,
in the larger towns, he will find compara-
tively young retired farmers enjoying
their bowls. “H.L.” has not explained
why, if such long hours are worked, the
farmer sticks to the job. The answer, of
course, is that it pays him.—ADAM
(Vic.).
