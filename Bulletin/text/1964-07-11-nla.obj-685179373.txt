LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
DECIMAL CURRENCY
Sir,
In less than another two years the
whole of Australia will be stunned by
the consequences of our decimal cur-
rency experts' planning, if they continue
unchecked. I recently thoroughly examin-
ed all aspects of this important subject
and I now assert, without fear of contra-
diction, that the very foundation of our
new currency, the 1960 report of the
Decimal Currency Committee under the
chairmanship of Mr Walter Scott, is a
shockingly inadequate document which
did not provide satisfactory answers to
any of the important questions asked by
the Federal Government and also fail-
ed to disclose overwhelming evidence
against the proposed $(10s.)-cent system.
The only active support I could find for
the new currency units came from those
few people who considered Australia
must break its strong traditional currency
link with Britain regardless of cost.
Most of the conversion costs are hard
to identify, but nevertheless very real,
and Mr Scott and his experts must be
condemned for not attempting to pro-
vide any estimate of the total. My con-
servative assessment is £2OO million plus
the serious weakening of our all too
meagre defence structure. With so many
urgent projects delayed through lack of
finance it is surely ridiculous to need-
lessly squander such a large amount of
money to gain the greatly exaggerated
benefits of decimal currency. The major
portion of our conversion costs, prob-
lems, inconvenience and confusion can
be eliminated by adopting a system
which retains our present pound with
easily understood decimal divisions
catering for the needs of all sections of
our community. Commonsense plan-
ning would also almost abolish the costly
two-year dual currency period.

LAUSANNE EXPOSITION
April to October, 1964
announcement of improved pay and con-
ditions for the Defence Forces, one of
the measures advocated by The
Bulletin, should do much to improve
morale, but whether recruitment will be
sufficiently stimulated in consequence
remains to be seen. I believe not; for,
to say the least, it seems unrealistic to
rely on voluntary recruitment at a time
of full employment and in the face of
pressures on manpower resources of a
buoyant and expanding economy.
Compulsory national service is the
realistic alternative. It could be made
politically palatable if approached in a
totally new way (new for Australia but
not for many other nations which have
successfully adopted it). Selective it must
be, but the crux is that all the barriers
which hitherto have separated the Regu-
lar from the National Serviceman must
go. The two must train together and
serve together in the same unit wherever
that unit may be needed, at home or
abroad. There must be no more segrega-
tion, with the National Serviceman con-
fined to home defence second-line units,
and in fact, regarded bv the Regular as
a second-rate sailor, soldier or airman.
Provided national service is continuous
and for a period long enough (say, two-
year minimum) to enable the National
Serviceman to give a reasonable amount
of trained service after completing his
recruit and specialist training, there is no
reason why he should not serve efficiently
and effectively alongside the Regular,
even abroad.
Under this new conception of selective
national service, overheads formerly
associated with separate command and
training structures, for National Service-
men would not be required, and costs
should thus be no greater than under
voluntary recruitment. Granted it in-
volves major policy amendments to the
Defence Act; but what an earnest it
would be to our neighbors and allies
of our determination fully to contribute
to our defensive alliances.

CATHOLICS AND CONTRACEPTION
Sir,
For every Catholic in Australia there
are about three non-Catholics. Even if
most Catholics don’t hold with contra-
ception, most of the rest do. Articulate
Catholics, of whom there are a few, will
tell you that contraceptive intercourse is
wrong in itself, irrespective of its con-
sequences. Articulate non-Catholics, of
whom there are fewer, are mostly of the
opinion that contraception is in the same
moral case as the exploding of dynamite,
right if its consequences are beneficial,
wrong if they are harmful. Articulate
Catholics, in reply, will reach for their
copies of Augustine’s “De Nuptiis et
Concupiscentia” (see at 1.xv.17) and
Aquinas’ “Summa Theologica” (see at
Ila Ilae, Q. 154, on sins of lust) and
thereafter demonstrate, in five or six im-
peccable syllogisms, that their opponents
have corrupt consciences.
Even among our betters it would by
now probably be agreed that contracep-
tion is no more harmful to health than
is the drinking of tea. Admittedly, if
Catholics are right, the practice of it in
this life will possibly result, for some
people, in a most unpleasant hereafter;
but no one pretends that it is detrimental
to health or property in the same way
as are assault, rape, drug addiction,
robbery and other practices which author-
ity rightly attempts to suppress. More-
over, our society is made up of people
with diverse beliefs and tries to give its
members as much freedom to go (if they
wish) to the devil, as it is compatible
with the preservation of other people’s
life, health and property.
This being so, is it not unneighborly
of some Catholics to try to prevent both
their co-religionists and everyone else
from practising contraception, by sup-
pressing, somewhat Irishly, the very men-
tion of its technicalities? In my under-
graduate days medical students were not
taught about contraception at all, and a
medical graduate who was my contem-
porary at that institution owns to having
felt some bitterness when fumbling hope-
lessly in general practice to fit a dia-
phragm for the first time. The Australian
Consumers' Association, too, has been
remarkably silent about the excellent and
very disturbing (British) Consumers’
Association report on contraceptives
(A 12/6 to members of Consumers’ Asso-
ciation, London) following the “Catholic
Weekly’s” admonition to its readers last
July not to support ACA if it distributed
information about contraception.
To be sure. Catholics are perfectly free
to believe that contraception is wicked
and that it is wicked for anybody, irre-
spective of his religion. But thev are not
free to deny others the opportunity of
practising it if they wish by preventing
the dissemination of information.

Sir,
With reference to the article (13/6/64)
on “The Bishop and the Pill”. Accord-
ing to the hierarchy, “the Church has no
power to revise the laws of God”. But
are not Catholics revising laws of God
when they take means to prevent heart
attacks or cure death-dealing diseases by
securing the attention of doctors? Are not
these afflictions the laws of God? Any-
how, to get down to tin tacks, what
earthly difference is there in preventing
semen from taking effect by using the pill
or using the rhythm method which is
advocated?

THE AULF CONFERENCE
Sir,
Though Richard Hall’s report of the
Australian Universities Liberal Federa-
tion Conference (20/6/64) would have
given the reader a generally accurate
impression, there were several factual
errors which should be corrected. The

most serious relates to the motion calling
for recognition of Red China. The Con-
ference defeated this motion after it had
been amended to provide for the rights
of Taiwan. According to the officially
recorded minutes of the Conference the
motion thus amended was finally de-
feated 12-6.
Melbourne would also like to disso-
ciate itself from the comments on the
Attorney - General’s speech. Far from
giving a run-of-the-mill exhortation to
“young” liberals, the Attorney-General
discussed the basis of his philosophy of
the Liberal Party as a “free thought”
party which proved to be extremely pro-
vocative and interesting. We feel sure
that the comment does not represent the
opinion of the vast majority of people
who attended the dinner.

Sir,
Our thanks go to The Bulletin for
its excellent write-up and analysis of the
Australian Universities Liberal Federa-
tion Conference. Unfortunately, there
was, through an unfortunate mistake in
our own Press statement, an inaccuracy
—the motion in favor of the “Two
Chinas” policy of recognition was in
fact defeated. We also feel that none
of the delegates would agree with you
that they were insulted by Mr Snedden's
speech or that it was a faux pas.

OXFORD
Sir,
Ross Campbell’s masterly picture of
life at Oxford in the early thirties
(20/6/64) provides a wealth of interest-
ing material. I, for one, found that Mr
Campbell's experience fitted rather easily
into the general picture which I had
formed of Oxford. There was the exces-
sive use of servants, the pursuit of
knowledge for its own sake, the brilliance
and wittiness of University personalities,
the originality of the pranks, the rather
monastic attitude to sex and, over it all,
the peaceful dignity of that ancient town.
I agree with Mr Campbell that the
Oxford education fails to equip graduates
with the best training for immediately
earning a living, but I consider that it
does train them to do something more
important—and that is to think. Un-
doubtedly this is acquired at most uni-
versities, but Oxford is pre-eminently
occupied with its pursuit and develops
it to a finer degree.

CADET CORPS TRAINING
Sir,
Listening to question time in the Housj
of Representatives, I noticed that the!
main reason given for not increasing the!
establishment of the Cadet Corps abov s ‘
39,000 is that the Regular Army woul|
be required to supply more instructors;
etc., which would further deplete it. Thi
attitude appears to be without foundation
in view of the importance of cadet train-
ing for these reasons—it is the only con,
tact the regular forces have with the
youth of Australia; proper trainins'
would, without doubt, induce many
cadets to join the Regular and Citizen
Forces; it inculcates discipline into out
youth (never more necessary) and their
physique is greatly improved; it is of
immense value in character building and
in training leadership; and, apart from
valuable military instruction, it assists the
youth of Australia to be good citizens.
There are many thousands of boys
eligible and keen to join, but they cannot
do so because of the restricted establish-
ment.
The permanent Navy, Army and Air
Force would only be required to provide
instructors and organise schools during
school holidays for school masters and
others suitable as Cadet officers.

SIG. MORO
Sir,
In your Business and Finance section
of June 20 you state in an item on
Italy: “the Socialists under Signor Moro
and the Christian Democrats under Sig-
nor Colombo . . .” The Socialist leader
and Deputy Prime Minister is Sig.
Nenni; Sig. Moro is Prime Minister and
leader of the Christian Democrat Party.
One hopes that your economic comments
are sounder than your political facts.

THE TIBETANS
Sir,
Your interesting article, “A Long Way
From Lhasa” (20/6/64), prompts me to
draw the attention of your readers to
the fact that there is a Tibetan Friend-
ship Group in Australia. At the moment
it is concentrating on securing interest
in and help for the Young Lamas’ Home
School at Kailash, Dalhousie, in the
Punjab, India. The director is Mrs
Fredi Bedi, MA (Oxon), and the school
provides education in English and Hindi
for Tibetan lamas to help them adjust
themselves to their new life and at the
same time maintain their spiritual func-
tions among their own people.
The school now depends upon volun-
tary aid from well-wishers. Anyone who
would like to help can do so through me.

National Notebook
New Works
We believe that the Elizabethan Thea-
tre Trust has commissioned com-
poser Peter Sculthorpe and writer
Patrick White to do an opera, based on
the story of Mrs Frazer, who was ship-
wrecked off the Queensland coast in
the last century, lived with Aborigines
and was taken back to civilisation by
an escaped convict. The director of the
Elizabethan, Mr Stefan Haag, says that
although the work has been commis-
sioned no definite plans have been made
for it.
The Trust has entered into a less for-
mal arrangement with Robert Helpmann
and writer Kenneth Cook, and, once
more, Peter Sculthorpe to prepare a
musical drama on the Eureka Stockade.
Mr Helpmann returns to Australia from
London next month and Mr Haag said
that the Trust hoped to “keep him
busy” in Australia for some months so
that he can get together with Mr Cook
and Mr Sculthorpe.
Mr Haag said that the
Trust had been looking
around for a composer
who seemed to have a
good theatrical sense, and
in Mr Sculthorpe they
felt they had found one.
Mr Haag, who has just re-
turned from overseas, said that every-
where opera seemed to have reached an
impasse and there was a grave shortage
of good plays—“although that is a
perennial”. Perhaps, Mr Haag said, the
future of the theatre lies in what the
Germans call “total theatre”, in which
the elements of drama, dance and music
are combined.
Spectator Sportsman’s Friend
A cushion which keeps beer cool while
you sit on it had us sufficiently
intrigued to inquire further from its
Sydney distributor, Mr Scott Barrett.
“Cold cans of beer keep that way for
up to a week when encased in foam
rubber,” he informed us. “Capitalising
on that we created a cushion which
might be termed the spectator sports-
man’s friend. Although of course it’s
equally good for yachting or picnics.”
Exactly a foot square and 4in. deep,
the cushion is a two-tone job in white
and grey. Slide fasteners on two opposite
sides slide open to reveal the three holes
that take the beer (or soft drink) cans.
Handles on each side make it portable
to picnics and football matches. “But,”
we queried, “don’t the cans make for
hard sitting?” Not a bit of it, we were
assured. “In fact the cushion is more
comfortable with the cans than with-
out.”
New Zealand Invasion
telegrams and toheroa soup, the
New Zealand publishing company,
A. H. and A. W. Reed, opened their
Sydney office last week. Before the
opening, The Bulletin went along to
the new offices of the company where we
found A. W. Reed, the present managing
director, helping to decorate the place
with painted plastic replicas of Maori
wood carvings.
Several Reed publications, including
books on rugby and cricket, some
children’s publications, books on New
Zealand’s birds, beetles, fauna and
history together with a few on Maori
culture and a sprinkling of Reed’s
best-seller Barry Crump were spread
around the walls.
“There is a need for a cultural ex-
change between our two
countries,” Mr Reed said.
“It is important that our
destinies should become
more closely knit.” At
the moment, Mr Reed’s
main interest is in Poly-
nesia. “There is a des-
perate need for education there and
neither Australia, because she is more
concerned with Melanesia, nor anyone
else is doing anything about it.” Mr
Reed plans a series of educational publi-
cations which will be distributed
throughout the Pacific Islands.
Mr Reed, who is the author of more
than 30 books (150 if you count the
children's books), said his company had
always concentrated on the promotion
and publication of New Zealand authors
and artists. Founded in 1907 as a “mail
order religious and Sunday School sup-
ply house”, the Reed company branched
out into general publication in 1932 with
its first book —“The Letters and Journals
of Samuel Marsden”. Since then it has
become the largest publishing house in
NZ turning out books, records and sou-
venirs.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Brinkmanship ’64 and...
fFHE unprecedented appointment
of General Maxwell Taylor,
(See Profile, p. 36), Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to succeed
Mr Henry Cabot Lodge as US
ambassador in Saigon, coupled with
the general’s reputation as an ag-
gressive soldier, led to some hasty,
and mercifully incorrect, conclu-
sions about American policy in the
Indo-China area.
General Taylor, unlike some of
his subordinates, is not one of the
up-and-at-’em boys who think that
the alternative to defeat in South
Vietnam is to win in North Viet-
nam. On the contrary, he under-
stands that revolutionary warfare
fought according to the principles
laid down by Mao Tse-tung and
General Vo Nguyen Giap, the
brilliant Viet Minh leader, who
defeated the French at Dien Bien
Phu 10 years ago, must be
mastered, and that the place to do
this is not in North Vietnam, but
in the ricefields, the jungle, and
especially in the hearts and minds
of the people of the South.
During his first visit to Vietnam
as a special emissary for President
Kennedy in October, 1961, General
Taylor appreciated that the Viet
Cong would not be defeated by
military measures alone. His re-
port laid special stress on grass
roots techniques in the villages and
hamlets, on land reform. He called
for security for the villages and for
a new deal, including education,
medical care and for some material
satisfaction of rising economic ex-
pectations. It was not Taylor’s
fault that things went wrong. Be-
fore he died with his hands tied
behind his back in a weapons
carrier in the streets of Saigon last
November, Ngo Dinh Nhu, Presi-
dent Diem’s headstrong brother
and the regime’s eminence grise,
had made a mockery of the Taylor
plan by the mass creation of
“strategic hamlets” which failed to
provide security, or social benefits,
and became breeding grounds for
the Communist Viet Cong.
General Taylor now goes to
Saigon to take what amounts
almost to personal command. He
was chosen from an astonishing
list of candidates, including Dean
Rusk, the Secretary of State, and
Robert McNamara, the Defence
Secretary. This is, in itself, a
measure of Washington’s apprecia-
tion of the difficulties ahead and
also of the consequences of failure,
not merely in South-East Asia but
also in Latin America and Africa,
where Peking’s formula for revolu-
tionary warfare is readily applic-
able.
By proclaiming that the United
States believes South-East Asia to
be worth the risk of a major war,
President Johnson has made it
clear that General Taylor will get
the tools he needs to do the job—
if it can be done. This is not
escalation but more of a note of
warning to Hanoi and Peking
against it.
The situation in Laos is some-
what different. Having established
by its photographic mission over
the Plain of Jars that the North
Vietnamese have introduced troops
and military equipment into Laos,
thereby violating the Geneva
Agreement of 1962, and having
itself violated the agreement since
by its strafing attacks against Com-
munist gun positions and other
targets, the United States has re-
moved all pretence from its policy
here. It has also indicated that the
price for further Communist mili-
tary gains is war.
fTVHERE are immense and demon-
A strable dangers in this policy.
While some Americans profess to
see a weakening in Peking’s tone
since this exercise in brinkmanship
began, it is not easy to read any such
conclusions into Marshal Chen
Yi’s statement that “the Chinese
people absolutely will not sit idly
by while the Geneva agreements
are torn up and the flames of war
spread to our side”, or even in the
warning that went with his renewed
call for a Geneva conference that
‘ should any people mistake this for
a sign of weakness and think that
they can do whatever they please in
Indo-China, they would find it too
late to regret”.
If Communist China and North
Vietnam do intervene by all-out
assault, the United States and its
Western allies do not have the con-
ventional means to stop them, at
least in the initial stages. And to
use the Bomb, though it might be
militarily expedient, could be
politically disastrous, especially in
those areas most susceptible to
Maoist revolutionary warfare.
Yet to have accepted de Gaulle’s
alternative and to have attempted
to negotiate the neutrality of the
entire Indo-China area now was
impracticable to say the least of it.
the United States
might like to see South-East
Asia achieve genuine neutrality and
independence, the 1962 experiment
in Laotian neutrality has ended all
hope that such a solution can be
manufactured from near defeat, or
that South-East Asian Communists,
whether they call themselves Viet
Minh, Viet Cong, or Pathet Lao,
can be persuaded to set aside their
military successes in the common
weal.
In its own strategic interests, and
as an ANZUS and SEATO ally
heavily dependent on the preserva-
tion of US military strength in the
West Pacific, Australia had no
alternative in this difficult and
dangerous situation but to increase
its modest military and economic
aid to Vietnam. If there is no
cause for quarrel in this, we do
have real cause for concern, how-
ever, that Canberra, like Washing-
ton, has failed to explain the
common goal in the Indo-China
area.
Some see in the Taylor appoint-
ment and the general American
military hustle-bustle an unqualified
exercise in Dulles’ brinkmanship.
It is not. The vital difference be-
tween Brinkmanship ’54 and Brink-
manship ’64 is that Dulles did not
subscribe to the possibility of
peaceful co-existence and Johnson
and Rusk do. Washington no
longer thinks of creating free world
“bastions” on China’s South-East
Asian periphery. It will be more
than satisfied if its efforts do lead
to a conference table where genuine
neutrality for Indo-China may be
negotiated from a position of some-
thing like equal strength and not
from the brink of defeat.
This is an objective that South-
East Asia and the rest of the un-
committed world might be expected
to welcome. If this is our policy
we should spare no effort to make
it known.


...the Long Haul
THE Tokyo Conference and its
aftermath have made it seem
likely that Indonesia’s confrontation
of Malaysia will last a long time.
Indonesia clearly does not want a
settlement, except on terms mani-
festly unacceptable to Malaysia.
Why should Indonesia want a
settlement? The Soekarno Govern-
ment stands to gain internally from
a more or less permanent state of
tension with Britain and Malaysia
and the costs of confrontation’s
harassing tactics are not great. In
terms of the number of British
troops it can tie down and, more
important, of its internal propa-
ganda value, confrontation is pay-
ing off, even though Malaysia is
far from being crushed.
Since Tokyo there have been
signs that confrontation will be
stepped up and it is hard to know
whether this is merely another in-
stance of threatening noises or
something more dangerous. Indo-
nesia may still have some strong
cards to play, particularly in co-
operation with the clandestine
Communist organisation of Sara-
wak. It is quite conceivable that
young Chinese Communists, armed
and trained by Indonesia, will be
able to establish a “liberated area”
in some part of rural Sarawak before
too long. This would make it
necessary for Malaysia’s allies to
put a good deal more men and
money into the job of defending the
new State.
T>UT even so it is most unlikely
** that Indonesia will be able to
pull off any major break-throughs in
the next year or two. After all,
Indonesia cannot afford to be too
provocative. It would be risky for
it to provide air cover for its “volun-
teers” on Malaysian soil, or, for
that matter,' to bring in a much
increased number of regular troops
under that label. For this might
make it politically possible for
Britain to retaliate. And in a major
“conventional” war Indonesia is
certainly no match for Britain. Of
course, it is possible that one or
the other side will miscalculate and
so bring about an escalation of hos-
tilities, which neither wants. If this
should happen sparks would fly in
all directions for a short time. But
even then the conflagration would
probably soon be stopped by US
or UN intervention, well before
either side had been able to strike
a decisive blow—after which we
would, presumably, be back to
confrontation as usual.
However, it is more likely that
Indonesia’s harassment of Malay-
sia will continue much as it has
before. There may be more border
raids and sporadic penetration of
Sarawak and Sabah, more encour-
agement of subversion in selected
communities in these territories, and
more dynamite charges near public
buildings and railway lines in
Malaya and Singapore. But harass-
ment is likely to stop short of
the point at which Britain could
afford major retaliation. And it
could go on in this way for five
years. Eventually, however, one
side is likely to give way. Will it
be Malaysia? It could be if one
of three things happen:
© The Tunku’s Alliance Gov-
ernment could fall as a result of
demoralisation even though most
present indications are that con-
frontation works the other way.
© Britain might eventually tire
of the burden of Malaysian defence.
In that case Malaysia could well
conclude that it must find accom-
modation with Indonesia, even if
on humiliating terms, or
• Malaysia might be brought
to its knees if the Americans con-
ceded defeat in Vietnam and Laos.
Equally, Indonesia might be first
to yield if any one of three things
happen:
• A major economic crisis
which might cause Soekarno once
again to seek US loans in return
for which he would have to make
substantial concessions to Malaysia.
• If anti-Communist Army
officers, who may well dominate the
politics of succession after Soekarno
goes, seek a rapprochement with
the West, including Britain and
Malaysia.
• The downfall of the Soekarno
Government brought about by Army
officers worried over the President’s
tolerance of the Communists.
Which way things will eventually
go is anybody’s guess. But mean-
while we are probably in for a long
period of tension and momentary
alarms. It is going to be a test of
nerves. While it is easy and right
to feel incensed by Indonesian
aggression against Malaysia, the fact
remains that many things will
happen in Asia in the next few
decades which we will dislike and
find ourselves powerless to change.
Aggressive nationalism of the
Soekarno variety is something we
will have to learn to live with, even
while we join in resisting its
excesses.
If there is one thing the ’fifties
and ’sixties should have taught us,
even to the point of cynicism, it is
that there are no short cuts. For
those who think there are let them
remember Suez. While this country
should support those of its neigh-
bors which have as much right as
any country to live in peace, and
while it should look to its own
defences and to its arrangements
with its allies, it is nevertheless well
to remember that the rest of the
world is not as indignant about
Indonesia as we are. While many of
the Afro-Asian countries show un-
mistakable signs that they are fed
up with Indonesian intransigence
and blackmail, Djakarta’s diplo-
matic position remains reasonably
strong —made clear last week when
it was announced that Indonesia
would be allowed to compete in the
Tokyo Olympics after all.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE COMMONWEALTH
Menzies in London
A change in priorities ...
FROM ALAN REID IN LONDON
Sir R. G. MENZIES
Political realist
is a certain symbolism in the
fact that Prime Minister Sir Robert
Menzies this time abandoned the
tradition of going first to London and
then on to Washington, and instead
visited Washington first.
It was a recognition of a change in
priorities. To Menzies, a political realist
and in some ways a 19th-century romantic
who is a Queen’s man to his boot heels,
Washington and the United States have
become more important than London
and the Commonwealth. If Australia
ever got into trouble with its neighbors
and it is deeply involved in the two
trouble spots of South Vietnam and
Malaysia its lines of communication
and supply across Asia to London and
the United Kingdom would be pre-
carious. It would have to look across
the Pacific.
And at the other side of the Pacific
is not the England to which Menzies has
emotional attachments, but the United
States, which is the non-Communist
world’s power centre. As a practical and
astute politician, Menzies may feel
emotion but respects power.
For Menzies the present meeting of
Commonwealth Prime Ministers in Lon-
don is probably the formal end of the
Commonwealth as he once knew it and
as he envisaged it as a younger, more
optimistic man. He is going through the
hoops, dutifully talking about the re-
construction of the Commonwealth and
giving it a modern look more appro-
priate to a more modern world. But
there is a mechanical quality about his
performance.
Whatever its defects, he is loyal to the
parliamentary system of which he is a
product. He feels that he has little in
common with those among the hotch-
potch of Prime Ministers who represent
political systems which are the antithesis
of parliamentary democracy. Nor can
he have much real enthusiasm for the
concept of the Commonwealth as a kind
of superior Colombo Plan arrangement,
with the various participants helping
each other with technical and develop-
ment assistance.
Menzies’ large, impressive figure will
be physically present at the Prime
Ministers’ Conference next week, but
politically nowadays, as distinct from
emotionally, he is more at home in
Washington than in London. Menzies
still has his loyalties to Britain and to
such parts of the old Commonwealth
in which parliamentary democracy con-
tinues to survive. He demonstrated this
when, as head of the Australian Govern-
ment, he committed Australia to support
of Malaysia in the Malaysian-Indonesian
dispute and thereby backed Britain,
which had already pledged support to
the new Malaysian State.
But he is too capable a politician to
let sentiment cloud judgment. He
recognised that while Britain and Aus-
tralia could make interim decisions it
would be the United States that alone
was in the position to make the final
decisions. It was for this reason that
he went first to Washington to try to
safeguard what he considered:
• The narrow self-interests of Australia,
and
• The wider concept of the right to
independence of a Commonwealth
country like Malaysia that is seeking
to preserve parliamentary democracy.
Menzies safeguarded Australia’s self-
interests by getting from the Johnson
Administration a renewal of the assur-
ance that in the event of Australian
forces getting involved in a major war
in the Malaysian dispute the United States
would regard the mutual defence pact
between Australia and the United States
—Anzus—as applying in the Malaysian
area, including Borneo, where Australian
forces are deployed in a dangerous
trouble spot.
To some extent Menzies is the middle-
man between the United States and the
Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Con-
ference. President Johnson authorised
him to tell the Conference that the
United States will honor its commitments
to South Vietnam, even at the risk of a
direct collision with Red China.
Menzies will probably not state the
position as bluntly as that. But he will
leave the Conference in no doubt about
the United States’ determined attitude.
SECTS
The Nazis and the Students
A question of free speech
From a Sydney Correspondent
need publicity and could not
” thrive without it,” Mr Brian Raven,
the commandant-general, stormtroopers,
National Socialist Party of Australia,
told The Bulletin in a letter we pub-
lished on June 27. Since then, some of
the stormtroopers, but not Mr Raven,
received more publicity when they were
charged in Sydney Central Court on
June 27 on various counts, including
possessing gelignite and unlicensed fire-
arms, passing worthless cheques and
breaking and entering.
The NSPA got a lot of space in the
June 30 issue of “Honi Soit”, the Sydney
University students’ paper. “Honi Soit”
published an interview with the “leader”
of the party, Mr Arthur Smith, a state-
ment by Smith that there were 35 paid
members of the party within the Univer-
sity., a piece by the British Nazi, Colin
Jordan, and an editorial.
The editor wrote: “Particularly offen-
sive have been the ‘standover tactics’ used
by Jewish groups within and without
the universities to prevent the publica-
tion of Nazi policies in student news-
papers.” He went on to say: “But if to
prevent this (the NSPA coming to
power) we have to abandon the ‘right
to free speech’, hackneyed slogan though
it may be, we may find ourselves merely
substituting one equally authoritarian
regime for another.”
Subsequently Professor Julius Stone,
Challis Professor of Jurisprudence and
International Law at Sydney University,
wrote to the editor of “Honi Soit”. The
letter was considered at a meeting of the
Students’ Representative Council on


July 2. The meeting was addressed by
two Jewish students, and subsequently
the SRC requested that the next issue of
“Honi Soit” give equal prominence to
anti-Nazi replies.
The incident raised two points:
whether any publicity for the NSPA is
good publicity and where does “Lreedom
of Speech” begin and end.
The president of the SRC, Mr Michael
Kirby, says his personal view is that
publicity given to the NSPA will serve
eventually to expose what palpable non-
sense its views are. He said the coun-
cil had no way of knowing whether there
were 35 members of the NSPA within
the university.
Professor Stone said he believed that
freedom of speech existed essentially in
“the market-place of ideas”. “When
American whites call Negroes ‘scum and
rapists’ they are not exercising freedom
of speech but are committing a verbal
assault,” Professor Stone said. “Their
speech is the equivalent of an Indian
war cry. When you abuse someone for
characteristics over which he has no
control you are adding nothing of value
to the world of ideas and are not exer-
cising freedom of speech. I think we
must always make this fundamental
distinction.”
TRADE UNIONS
Training the Unskilled
Still a chance for McMahon's plan
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
At first glance the rejection by a
Trade Union conference in Mel-
bourne last week of the Department of
Labor and National Service’s scheme for
training unskilled workers looked like a
slap in the face for Labor Minister Mr
W. McMahon who is at present over-
seas. But while it could be that union
restrictive practices were behind the re-
jection, at least the conference kept the
door open and a compromise might be
reached before the Minister returns.
With this object Mr H. B. Bland, Sec-
retary of the Department, is to have
talks with ACTU and Metal Trades
Union representatives later this month.
In the meantime he is studying counter
proposals put to him by the Melbourne
conference.
The Government's proposal, which
Mr McMahon outlined in April and the
employers have endorsed, is aimed to
overcome future shortages of skilled
tradesmen (it doesn't purport to remedy
the present acute shortage—in the metal
and electrical trades at the end of May
there were 8025 vacancies for skilled
labor against 962 registered for employ-
ment in those trades).
Under the scheme, selected unskilled
workers would receive six months’ in-
tensive training in industrial colleges
followed by two years’ subsidised on-the-
job training. But the unions say this
would lead to the eventual elimination
of the apprenticeship system, and also
they object to the scheme's basic
assumption that there is a shortage of
tradesmen either generally or in par-
ticular sections of industry.
Employers have already pointed out
that the real intention is to supplement
the apprenticeship system, not destroy
it, so there is obviously a good case for
a full exchange of views on this aspect.

EDUCATION
The Teachers’ Elections
No longer a simple affair ...
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Mr H. E. BOLTE
and a nominee. ..
Dissension descended on Victoria’s
schools this week as the Chief Elec-
toral Officer mailed out ballot papers to
26,000 teachers and trainee-teachers in
the Government service. (About 10,600
temporary teachers are ineligible to
vote.) Until July 27 the teachers
will vote to elect their representa-
tive to the Teachers’ Tribunal. The
successful candidate would get £3500 a
year to sit with a Government nominee,
under an independent chairman, to de-
termine the salaries, conditions and
classifications of all teachers employed
by the Education Department. To many
teachers it was a far more important
ballot than the one which returned
Henry Bolte's Government recently.
Ahead of the ballot papers came a
stream of tickets, leaflets and paid
advertisements which pointed to a major
struggle—and the zeal and finance to
wage it. This was an election in which
all seven candidates carried a union label
from one or other of Victoria's three
teachers’ organisations the Victorian
Teachers’ Union, the Victorian Second-
ary Teachers’ Association and the
Affiliated Teachers' Union.
The VTU, with 23,000 members in
the primary, high and technical schools,
is the biggest of the three. The VSTA
covers the high schools and has about
3200 members, not counting trainees.
Some high school teachers belong to
both, but there has been considerable
friction between the two unions. This
stems from the fact that, in general, only
the VTU is allowed by the Tribunal to
appear before it.
Moreover, since its inception in 1946,
a VTU man, and a primary teacher to
boot, has sat as teachers’ representative
on the Tribunal. The VSTA, which
aspires to professional status for the
graduates who make up a large number
of its members, considers that the whole
system is loaded in favor of the numeri-
, cally stronger primary teachers. In a
nutshell, the VSTA wants higher load-
ings for graduate qualifications than the
VTU has been prepared to press for, or
the Tribunal to award.
As the third force, the ATU, with be-
tween 1200 and 2000 members, covers
not only teachers in all branches of the
State service but has members in the
Catholic and private schools as well.
The VTU and VSTA keep aloof from
the trade union movement, but the ATU
is affiliated to both the Melbourne
Trades Hall Council and to the DLP.
In its salary claims the ATU is even
more radical than the VSTA.
The last election, three years ago, was
a simple affair. The three unions each
backed a candidate and the VTU man
beat the combined totals of the other
two by three to one. He was Mr Doug
Brown, one-time president of the VTU,
who has won election to the Tribunal
six times in a row. This time, however,
another well-known VTU figure is also
standing—Mr George Lawson. The
VTU has endorsed both and has issued
two tickets. One shows Brown (1) and
Lawson (2), while the other shows
Brown (2) and Lawson (1).
The VSTA is running its president,
Mr R. O. Desailly, who in the polemics
with the VTU last year described the
Tribunal as “an unjust, incompetent body,
unfit to control the conditions of teach-
ing in this State”. The other four can-
didates are all members of the ATU,
which is the only group to issue a ticket
numbered 1 to 7. It is giving first pre-
ference to Mr J. W. Barry, head teacher
of Violet Street State School, Bendigo.
Leaving the trainees aside, there are
12,000 primary teachers entitled to vote,
as against about 4000 secondary and
2000 technical school teachers. The
preponderance of the primary teachers
has enabled Mr Brown to score his easy
victories in the past. He is expected
to win again, but if he goes down it will
be to the other VTU man, Mr Lawson.
As a technical schools classifier, Mr
Lawson should get a solid vote from
this group. Although the VSTA is not
recommending preferences these will
favor Lawson rather than Brown. The
latter has the image among secondary
teachers of being obstinately committed
to the primary teachers, from whose
ranks he came.
As a minor theme, Lawson and Brown
represent the Left and the Right wings
of the VTU respectively. Lawson is
undoubtedly the most Left-wing candidate
in the field, and this is why the ATU
has put him at the bottom of its ticket.
Brown, however, as a Right-winger,
draws support not from Catholic teachers
but from an influential Masonic network
among the senior teachers. The politi-
cal color, however, in this election is
only pastel-hued.
The final twist to the tangle comes
from the 7000 or so trainees who are
entitled to vote. These represent over
25 per cent of the electorate. None
has voted in such an election before, and
most are presumably uncommitted. Both
Brown and Lawson have put out pro-
paganda specially aimed at the trainees.
Some doubt the propriety of college
principals and lecturers issuing leaflets
of this kind to their students.
THE ANNEXATION CRAZE
feuLletin
80 Years Ago: July 12, 1884
evidences which have been
afforded by recent cable-advices
that these Oceanic regions, so long
slighted by the Powers of the old
world, have at length come definitely
within the scope of political consid-
eration seem to occasion some un-
easiness.
It is only since Sir Thomas Mc-
Ilwraith made his sensational grab
at New Guinea, and by so doing
attracted the eyes of all the civilised
world in this direction, that there has
been any trouble. Following closely
upon that attempted stroke of policy,
the ambitions of the Presbyterian
missionaries in the New Hebrides,
struggling to curb the growing pre-
tensions of the French, because be-
hind, or in front of, the French
came the priests, opened a fresh
trouble.
If the counsels which would lead
us to exhibitions of greed and jeal-
ousy prevail now, it is quite prob-
able that even our present progress
and prosperity will be checked and
marred by not long-deferred hostili-
ties, and that our future, in lieu of
being calculable and assured, will 'be
determined by the proverbially un-
certain arbitrament of a war.

LOAN COUNCIL
The Unhappy Premiers
Playing havoc with State budgets
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Tn contrast to last year when the Pre-
miers went home happy from the
mid-year Loan Council meeting, this
time they departed decidedly angry.
Having asked for £326 million for pub-
lic works and housing, at one time they
looked like getting only £283 million
and in the end, after heated debate, only
managed to get the Commonwealth to
lift this by £7 million to £290 million.
This was £lB million more than last year
but against this the Commonwealth re-
fused to repeat last year's supplementary
allocation of £2O million special assist-
ance to increase employment. As only
£ll million o £ that allocation had been
used for public works, the net increase
on last year works out at only £7 mil-
lion.
The Commonwealth was not moved
by prolonged arguments that because the
rise in the basic wage would add £lO
million to the cost of works the increase
was insufficient for the States to finance
as much real work as last year. It took
the view that the overall strain on avail-
able resources, particularly labor, pro-
duced by spending even the amount
offered could have dangerous repercus-
sions on prices. On the picture of in-
flation possibilities drawn in the Govern-
ment's economic survey this looks right,
but as that survey took a somewhat
fatalistic attitude towards rising expen-
diture in the public sector, Canberra's
views seemed subsequently to harden o
taking action to cut expenditure an
these could, and should, color th
coming Budget.
If the Loan Grant means the State*
will have to cut back their works pro
grammes, the increase of only £22 mil
lion to £341 million in tax reimburse
ments can hardly fail to play havo
with State budgets. For, in effect, thi
increase is only one of £l3 million be
cause of the £2O million special alloca
tion for employment 'last year. Abou
£9 million went to bolster up the ordi-
nary revenues of the States. They won
have that to play with this year. More
over, as the £1 rise in the basic wag
has not been taken into consideration it
fixing this year's tax reimbursements (bo:
will only be taken into account in 19 65'
66), in default of substantially reducin;
their expenditure estimates they will
clearly be faced with heavy deficit
financing this year. The Premiers pressec
the Commonwealth hard to get the basic,
wage rise written into tax reimburse-
ments this year but met a blank refusal!
The Premiers have the alternative to
increase State taxation to help parti
their deficits and doubtless the Common-
wealth, which is probably cooking up
some substantial tax increases for \l\
own Budget, is content that this should'
happen. However, the emerging
is of the Commonwealth Government'
most probably budgeting for a surplus
and the States running into heavy defi-
cits. The supreme irony of this situa'
tion is that while the rise in the basic,
wage will be forcing the States into;
deficits, the Commonwealth in its turn
will be collecting a large slice of the'
States’ wages outlay in Federal taxation'
to help its surplus.

50 years of airmail on Shell
Australia’s first airmail and airfreight was flown
in a Bleriot monoplane using Shell fuel. Today,
Shell powers the jet mails.
A French stunt pilot, Maurice
Guillaux, flew Australia’s
first airmail and freight in
July, 1914.
Guillaux used Shell exclu-
sively on his pioneer flight,
being refuelled from 4-gallon
tins at landing points en route.
In 1964 in aviation as in
motoring Shell still sets
the pace and is a major
supplier to Australian and
overseas airlines. Melbourne/
Sydney flights now take just
over an hour and pre-depar-
ture fuelling from tarmac
hydrants takes a matter of
minutes.
Today, just as Guillaux was
in 1914, Australian aviation
and the Austral-
ian motorist
“can be sure of
Shell”.
This month a commemorative flight by a Victa aircraft
over Guillaux’s original route will mark the 50th anniversary
of Australia’s first aerial mail.
Special postage stamps depicting the historic Bleriot are on
issue at Post Offices while anniversary flight folders are also
available at a cost of 2/- each from Box 954 H, G.P.0.,
Adelaide, South Australia.
Across the Tasman, the university
students’ International Student Con-
ference also turned to Aborigines. Meet-
ing in Christchurch, it considered a
motion from the Nigerian delegation
which condemned the Australian Govern-
ment's lack of action and pressed for
constitutional revision to remove dis-
criminatory clauses. The Conference,
which is non-Communist and included
delegations from Africa, Asia and
Europe, passed the motion by 53 votes
to nil, with one abstention. Australia
and New Zealand were among the
majority.
Meanwhile Sydney University students
and staff have set in motion a scheme
which may well focus the world spot-
light on Australia. Their plan is to
charter a fleet of buses after the style
of the American freedom riders, and
tour northern New South Wales and
Queensland during the summer vacation.
In co-operation with local Aborigines,
they hope to demonstrate against depriva-
tion of civil rights on Government
settlements, and to conduct sit-ins where
Aborigines are denied the free use of
public facilities. Conscious that the
American and Australian situations are
not similar, they nevertheless have seen
the effect that world publicity can have
on democratic governments. Now, it
seems, it is Australia’s turn.

Clubs’ Association favoring the intro-
duction of an off-course totalisator. The
report contained the usual blab with
figures showing how the lack of TAB
was killing country racing. There was
also the expected assertion that SP book-
making was rife in country towns.

A cascade of protests followed, and

indignant documents under the noses of
TV viewers. The statement about the

with the usual pat on the back for the

The Goldwater Convention
“I nearly died," said Governor Scranton, “I couldn’t believe it ..."
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
One of the most frightening aspects
of Senator Barry Goldwater’s
potential Presidential candidacy is
that no one —including Goldwater him-
self —knows exactly where he stands on
the vital issues confronting the United
States and the rest of the world.
His supporters in his native south-west
like to think of him as a kind of rough-
riding political cowboy, and his cam-
paign literature makes great use of this
symbolism. Unfortunately, part of the
cowboy’s image is that of a trigger-happy
individual who shoots from the hip, and
only later finds out what the shooting
was all about. Certainly Goldwater pro-
jects this image in his off-the-cuff re-
marks, which are usually considerably
toned down or even reversed when he
is prevailed upon to think them through.
Midway in the recent Republican pri-
mary campaign, when the anti-Goldwater
Press (which is the great majority) was
emphasising his consistent inconsisten-
cies, his backers hired a high-priced New
York public relations company “to
straighten Barry out”. The first thing
Madison Avenue did in undertaking this
formidable assignment was to instal a
computer in the office. Into this elec-
tronic marvel they fed all Goldwater’s
conflicting statements on Cuba, Vietnam,
the Federal income tax, civil rights,
poverty and the eastern seaboard.
Out of the flashing, beeping maw of
the computer came a bland melange of
gooey remarks which were sufficiently
ambiguous to be released as a “state-
ment of principles” moving Goldwater
much closer to the middle of the road,
and to his acceptance by the more
respectable wing of the Republican Party,
than he appeared to be when he first
popped off.
The latest survey conducted by the
Associated Press before this edition
went to press showed that Senator
Goldwater could rely on more than
700 votes at the Republican Con-
vention which starts on July 11. A
net gain of nine in Illinois and one
in North Carolina boosted his total
of committed, instructed, pledged or
favorable delegates to 705. This is 50
more than the 655 needed for the
nomination if none of them stray,
Associated Press said.
Senator Goldwater’s closest pur-
suer. Governor Scranton, had 141
delegates. Of Senator Goldwater’s
total, 118 are committed by primary
election laws, 257 are instructed by
State or district conventions, 62 are
personally pledged to him and 268
say they favor him but are not pledged.
Goldwater personally disliked the
Madison Avenue treatment and the effort
to gloss him over. One of his strengths
is his disarming candor and bluff Western
honesty. Furthermore, he is not a man
who thinks in precise terms about any-
thing political; he has said that he thinks
vagueness is a virtue. In his own mind
he is not being inconsistent when he
reverses or modifies or gives a new slant
to a statement he has already made. He
frankly admits, on occasion, that he
cannot remember exactly what position
he took up in the past, but he does not
hesitate to declare that, whatever it was,
it squared with his general philosophy of
conservatism.
But it is the initial impact of Gold-
water's verbal six-shooter that is felt by
the public at large, and not the belated
explanation and/or denial. Lately his
apologists have been accusing the Press,
particularly the eastern Press, of deli-
berately misquoting and misconstruing
his ad-lib remarks. They have accused
the eastern Press of large-scale hatchet
work in the recent close Republican
primary election in California, despite
the fact that only a small fraction of that
State’s population is exposed to the views
of eastern newspapers.
Recently the “New York Herald-
Tribune”, traditional mouthpiece for the
international-minded Eisenhower-Eastern
wing of the Republican Party, ran an
article by its London columnist, John
Crosby, which went so far as to say that
“most Europeans are scared out of their
wits by this nut”. Rather strong lan-
guage about a man whom the news-
paper and the entire eastern Republican
faction might well have to support,
willy-nilly, if he should capture the
Republican nomination at San Francisco
—an entirely likely possibility.
But it is not hard to understand why
Europeans —and the “Herald-Tribune” —
feel that way about Goldwater. I think
that most Americans feel the same way.
It is the off-the-cuff Goldwaterisms which
have scared thinking people everywhere.

• On Vietnam: A suggestion to “de-
foliate” the jungle cover by using small-
yield nuclear weapons. When anguished
cries arose throughout the Western world
over any thought of using nuclear wea-
pons, Goldwater backed down and in-
sisted he had not advocated their use.
He added that his remarks had been
taken out of context by the Press.
• On Foreign Aid: Goldwater de-
clared in 1960, in a prepared speech,
that “one of the most, important things
for Congress to do is to stop foreign
economic aid'’. The “computerised” ver-
sion, released during the primary cam-
paign, of Goldwater's views on foreign
aid states: “Foreign military aid and
technical assistance are valuable
adjuncts to our overall programme of
mutual security . . . but foreign econo-
mic aid is too often used as a crutch
rather than a means of instilling self-
discipline. By scattering our aid pro-
grammes among nearly 100 different
countries we are diluting the total
impact.”
9 On eastern politicians, Press and
people: “Sometimes I think the eastern
seaboard should be sliced off and set
adrift.” This quotation appeared in the
fervently Republican weekly magazine
“Saturday Evening Post”. However,
Goldwater later denied saying it.
• On Civil Rights: In a book printed
under his signature, “Conscience of a
Conservative”, Goldwater said: “I am
firmly convinced not only that integrated
schools are not required but that the
Constitution does not permit any inter-
ference by the Federal Government in
the field of education.” On a nationally
televised interview programme, “Meet
The Press”, Goldwater said: “I think that
when a Federal Court hands down an
edict that a school district has violated
the decision of the Supreme Court, then
I think it is incumbent upon the Federal
Government to enforce that edict.”
9 On the Federal income tax: Gold-
water has frequently endorsed suggestions
for the abolition of the income tax
system in speeches and interviews. How-
ever, the computerised version of his
present stand is this: “Our present tax
burden is onerous, often inequitable, and
in need of reform.
But abolition is the
answer to nothing.
Such precipitous
action would create
very serious and
damaging results to
the whole business
of running the Gov-
ernment.”
• On President
Johnson’s anti-pov-
erty campaign: “We
are told that many people lack skills and
cannot find jobs because they did not
have an education. That's like saying
that people have big feet because they
wear big shoes. The fact is that most
people who have no skill have no educa-
tion for the same reason low intelli-
gence or low ambition.”
(It is noteworthy that this evidence of
Goldwater’s attitude towards the poor
has not been repudiated. It is also note-
worthy that it was these remarks, uttered
to an audience of industrialists at the
Economic Club, that convinced Gover-
nor William Scranton of Pennsylvania he
had to enter the fight to stop Goldwater
from becoming the Republican candi-
date. “I nearly died,” Scranton said
later. “We all say things and make mis-
takes. But he was reading this from a
prepared speech. I couldn’t believe it.”)
• On the United Nations: Goldwater
once favored withdrawal of the United
States from the UN ... “I have come
to the reluctant conclusion that the Uni-
ted States no longer has a place in the
United Nations.” But his most recent
remarks were along these lines: “I be-
lieve the United States should make the
fullest possible use of its membership in
the UN. The UN is not all it should
be. Even so, it's a useful forum.”
• On the Social Security system:
During the New Hampshire primary
campaign early this year, Goldwater
commented, jn answering reporters’
questions: “I would like to suggest one
change, that social security be volun-
tary.” But during the California primary
campaign he denied advocating a
voluntary social security system, adding:
“Anyone who says I am against social
security lies.”
• On the Negro vote: In 1961 Gold-
water said: “The Republican Party has
not attracted Negro voters. It is time
to admit we cannot get them and other
minorities as a block ... so let’s quit
trying specifically to get these groups.”
Two years later Goldwater had veered
round completely: “I’ve never said for-
get the Negro vote or the Italian vote or
any minority vote. Go after them.”
The important thing to remember
about Goldwater's personal appeal is that
it is essentially emotional rather than
intellectual. The handsome, unaffected
man from Arizona
has the same kind of
magnetism for the
Right wing, includ-
ing the lunatic fringe
of John Birchites
and similar far-out
cranks, that Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt
had for the Left
wing, including the
Communists and
other radicals of his
day.
I attended a Goldwater rally in Madi-
son Square Garden last May, when
Governor Rockefeller's campaign for the
nomination was at its crest and appeared
to be succeeding. This was enemy terri-
tory, and not a single New York Repub-
lican politico was on hand to lend en-
dorsement to the Senator. Nevertheless,
the huge auditorium was completely
filled with cheering, singing, yelling parti-
sans—some of whom paid as high as
1000 dollars a seat. Total admissions,
all of which went into the Goldwater
campaign fund, exceeded 70,000 dollars.
I was struck by the emotional fervor
of the crowd, most of whom were
dressed in Ivy League fashion and looked
as if they had station-waggoned to town
from the lush suburbs of northern West-
chester, Connecticut and New Jersey.
When the tall, tanned Senator strode on
to the stage bedlam broke out. Banners
waved for fifteen minutes as well-bred
voices shrieked “We love you, Barry.”
Lovely young “Goldwater Girls” in ten-
gallon hats and cowgirl skirts acted as
ushers and went vocally mad, Beatle-
style, at the sight of their political hero.

A little white ball can affect your Company’s dividends
A game of golf may not appear to have much bearing on the profitability of an
industrial organisation...but the efficiency of a company depends on the efficiency
of its executives and staff. People, particularly creative and administrative people,
produce better in pleasant environments, with adequate recreational facilities. In
Mackellar County there are facilities for golf, tennis, bowls, fishing, swimming,
surfing, sailing, cruising, bushwalking...in fact, every avenue for healthy, happy
personal relaxation. This is just one of the extra benefits Mackellar has to offer the
industrialist. The location of your new plant in this, the most virile development
area in Australia, could be very profitable...take a good look at Mackellar.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

MACKELLAR COUNTY

It reminded me forcibly of the Roosevelt
rallies of the ’thirties. Obviously Gold-
water has every bit as much political sex
appeal as had FDR, and which no
American politician has had since.
Just who are the people, other than
the exurbanites I saw in Madison Square
Garden, who have flocked to the Gold-
water banner? They constitute a coali-
tion whose strength is still to be tested,
but which may be formidable, of the
very rich, the very reactionary, the very
elderly (but. some of the very young
university intellectuals), the very ambi-
tious, the very disenchanted and the very
susceptible.
The most vocal and most troublesome
of all the Goldwater adherents are the
John Birch Society fanatics and their
affiliates. Goldwater has never repudi-
ated the support of “the radical Right”
as Rockefeller and Scranton have done.
He has taken issue with certain wild-
eyed tenets of Birch faith such as the
accusation that Eisenhower is a dedicated
Communist. But he has also remarked
that, “from what I've seen, the Birch
people don't seem to be extremists. Birch
members are generally impressive, intel-
ligent people. They are the kind we
need in politics.”
The Birch element applauds Barry
Goldwater loudly when he talks about
“getting tough with Cuba” —or Khrush-
chev, or the Chinese Reds, or the Viet-
cong. But they are embarrassed when
someone brings up the subject of Gold-
water's Jewishness. There is, of course,
a strong anti-Semitic flavor in the Birch
Society, as there is in all the extreme
Rightist groups. They do not like to be
reminded that the Senator's family name
was originally Goldwasser, that his
grandparents, Mike and Sarah, emigrated
from Europe to California during the
gold rush and arrived in Arizona with
pedlar's packs on their backs. Some-
where along the way the name was
changed and the Episcopalian faith re-
placed Judaism as the family religion.
Barry Goldwater's reaction to talk of
his Jewish ancestry is good-humored. He
tells of the time he applied to play nine
of the eighteen holes at a restricted
country club in Arizona “because I am
only half-Jewish.” He also enjoyed
columnist Harry Golden's remark: “I
always knew that the first Jewish Presi-
dent would be an Episcopalian.” Gold-
water can afford to laugh. He has never
suffered any discrimination in his native
Arizona, where his family owns depart-
mental stores and much real estate; he
was actually a founder of the restricted
golf club he jokes about.
Goldwater makes a great appeal to the
segregationists, both of the South and
the North. He openly opposed most fea-
tures of the Civil Rights Bill before
Congress and voted against it.
He is, of course, the only avowed

candidate of either party to take such
a forthright stand. He is steadily gain-
ing support from “hidden segregation-
ists,” particularly in Northern cities and
suburban areas, who are reacting in fear
and trepidation from the excesses and
violence engendered by the “Negro revo-
lution” and the upsurge of civil rights
demonstrations.
Goldwater’s undercover support—
which caused much embarrassment to the
professional pollsters and other sooth-
sayers in the California primaries—is a
factor which may have great influence in
the Presidential campaign this year,
should he become the Republican can-
didate. There is no doubt that the
ordinary citizen, when quizzed by a poll-
taker or even a close friend, is reluctant
to admit admiration for Goldwater. But
his actions in a closed election booth
are not subject to such inhibitions.
Goldwater’s adherents and financial
backers express confidence that the
number of secret Goldwater supporters
is greater than anyone realises. They
claim that their mail proves it.
Goldwater owes much of his support
to the “oillionaires” of Texas and other
industrialists with
vested interests.
They hate labor
unions, the Federal
income tax, and
Federal spending,
particularly on fo-
reign aid. Instinc-
tively they feel that
Goldwater is o fl;
their side, regardless
of how much he
waters down o r
reverses his statements of outright de-
votion to their causes.
Goldwater would seem to be the man
many Republicans have been talking
about for years—“a true conservative,
not a me-too Republican imitating the
Democrats.” His slogan, “A change,
not an echo,” reflects this widespread
yearning, particularly in the business
community, for a no-holds-barred battle
with the liberal elements of the country,
be they Republican or Democratic. The
defeats of Wilkie, Dewey and Nixon
are supposed to have occurred because
they were “aping the Democrats”.
Goldwater’s non-intellectuality, his
adolescent approach to complex prob-
lems, his unsophisticated hobby (he is a
ham operator who identifies himself on
his home-made radio transmitter as just
plain Barry) appeal as a refreshing
change to Americans who always mis-
trusted the polished Bostonian style of
John F. Kennedy.
Goldwater has attended the normal
number of schools for a wealthy Ameri-
can, but is not notably an educated man.
He fell behind his classmates in the
public high school he attended in Phoe-
nix, Arizona, his birthplace. He once
boasted that he “never read a book but
never missed an issue of ‘Popular
Mechanics’.” His parents sent him to
Staunton Military Academy, an upper-
class institution specialising in rich men's
problem children, where he became a
good soldier but not a notably improved
student. He attended the University of
Arizona, whose academic standards are
not of the highest, for one year, but
quit higher education altogether to enter
the family business.
As a junior executive in the Goldwater
store he was soon known as a practical
joker who sent live mice through the
pneumatic tubes to the secretarial pool.
Eventually he rose to the top of the
company. He became a clever mer-
chandiser. He is proud of his coup in
introducing “antsy pants” to Arizonian
posteriors. These were men’s shorts
decorated with likenesses of huge red
ants.
His job gave him enough income and
time to indulge in his outside interests,
such as ham wireless, aeroplane flying
and photography (he is a member of the
Royal Society of Photographers). His
family were Demo-
crats, but he entered
politics after the war
as a Republican.
He entered the Sen-
ate in 1952, where
his friend line s s,
warmth and candor
soon endeared him
to most other mem-
bers of America’s
most exclusive club,
regardless of party
affiliation. He is probably the most
popular man personally in the Senate.
Goldwater may or may not ever be-
come President. But, in the great
American political tradition, a whispering
campaign has been started against him.
It is in the category of Harry Truman’s
alleged fondness for bourbon whisky and
John Kennedy’s supposed susceptibility
to the opposite sex. In the case of Gold-
water it is gossip about “emotional
instability”.
Washington columnist Drew Pearson
wrote recently that Goldwater’s wife
Peggy had admitted in a magazine article
that her husband had suffered two ner-
vous breakdowns. Goldwater had become
highly irritable and difficult in his deal-
ings with close associates and the Press
during the latter stages of the primary
campaigns this year, the columnist noted.
Pearson was apprehensive that a man so
highly strung might be entrusted with the
power to drop the atom bomb. How-
ever, Goldwater’s nervous breakdowns
turned out, on investigation, to have
been minor bouts of fatigue which
cleared up after hunting and fishing holi-
days in his beloved Arizona wilderness.

OUT AND ABOUT
The World of the Rayner Sisters
Folk stories for today’s sophisticated little folk
By CHARLES SRIBER
660 OME c^’^ren threw jelly
babies at us today. Now that’s
something that’s never happened
before. It’s the influence of The
Beatles. We could tell by the squeals.
We’ve never had squeals before either.”
Betty Rayner and her sister Joan had
just finished their performance in the
vast, proudly municipal town hall in a
Sydney suburb. They stood on the stage
in their dirndl skirts and floppy
blouses, beaming at the straggling rem-
nants of the 700 vocal moppets who had
just attended an Australian Children’s
Theatre presentation.
“They were the noisiest children we’ve
ever had,” Joan said.
“Don’t worry, dear,” her sister re-
assured her in a no-nonsense voice,
“they'll be back to normal in no time
now The Beatles have gone. It’s just
a question of getting them to react as
individuals. It’s the group reaction we
had today.”
Their final item had been a French
folk song with dance and mime. The
sisters had tossed around realistic hens,
attitudinised about the stage while they
beamed and beefed out the song for
the packed audience.
Performances put on specially for
children can be suspect. It just isn’t
sufficient to point out that the small fry
have been carried away by it. Kids
can become rapt over strictly AO TV
fare.
rrffiE Rayner sisters firmly eschew sensa-
tion. Their aim is to introduce child-
ren to theatre by way of simple, bustling
material. Many of their items are dra-
matised folk tales in which they use
simple make-up and costumes that might
hardly fool the more sophisticated
children of today. They have an in-
domitable quality that takes one back to
simpler times. Their costumes appear
to be studied examples of what children
themselves might wear in a dress-up play.
I arrived in the middle of their second
item which appeared to consist of two
apple-cheeked, slightly rotund characters
chasing each other around a blue, non-

ese tale, “The Tongue-Cut Sparrow”. .1
watched the children's reactions. During
the dialogue they became restive. One
small boy pulled out a realistic toy pistol,
drew a bead on Betty Rayner and said
“Pawooo!” Two moppets with knowing,
precocious faces walked hand in hand
up and down the aisle. Pigtailed little
girls gazed fascinated, the boys sat on
their hands, rocked back and forth and
began chattering until teachers and
escorts shushed them.
But when the two were in action the
kids grew silent. They watched the
model sparrow flutter, laughed while the
“husband” was scolded.
The next item, a Chinese tale invol-
ving the use of traditional puppets and
rapid change of character, had them
really sitting forward. The wife-stealing
despot was strictly a “baddie”. The
puppets, authentic and colorful, brought
squeals of delight.
At the show's end the kids—average
age around eight—gave an ear-splitting
ovation. How much of it was repressed
spirits effervescing was anyone's guess.
“We’ve been doing this for longer
than we care to remember,” Betty Ray-
ner told me. “Actually our father might
have prompted it. He was a black and
white artist. Did work for The
Bulletin. Fred Rayner his name was.
D’you know, he bought the first sketch
David Low ever sold? Back in 1893.
“Actually, our eldest sister Mollie was
the first to go into theatricals. She had
left New Zealand for London. Joan
followed and enrolled at London Uni-
versity to study as a social worker.
Mollie was playing in ‘The Women’ at
the time —the only non-American in the
cast.
“I came over and we trained with the
old Greenleaf Theatre in South Ken.
Now this was run by people associated
with Ted Shawn and I’ve always felt his
influence dominated the group and we
got something of it.
“We came back to Australia —our
family had moved to Sydney—and
started the Little Theatre of Youth. But
there was no awareness of children’s
theatre. We had to play to adults.”
basic desire was to play to child-
ren. They went to the United
States and toured extensively. “Ameri-
can children are very satisfying to per-
form to. They are so unselfconscious.
They'll write you letters and it never
worries them that words are misspelled
or the writing scrawls all over the page.
I think Australian children are more
group-conscious and that’s one thing we
don’t agree with. I remember when I
was a child I used to come up with
some idea and Joan would ask me,
‘Whose idea is that, yours or mother’s?’
and if I said it was mother’s she would
round on me, ‘Well, never mind that.
Think for yourself, that’s the thing!’
“We’ve always believed in individu-
ality. We found the United States
fascinating. We nearly became Ameri-
can citizens, you know. We toured all
over but performed mostly in the eastern
and middle western States. Then we
would tour the south and up into the
mountains collecting folk lore. We got
a lot in the New England States too.
“We were in America when the war
broke out. We came to Australia in
1940 and then returned, but when the

call went out from Britain for enter-
tainers, we had a little talk and decided
to offer our services.
“There’s a great similarity between
playing to troops and playing to child-
ren. No, I think troops are more diffi-
cult. You see a child will react spon-
taneously. A serviceman is concerned
about how his reactions will appear to
his mates. He looks to them before
reacting. It was the toughest thing we’ve
ever attempted and it made us even more
determined to encourage individual
thinking. It's a terrible thing when the
group idea dominates a person.
“In fact, those troops were very simi-
lar to 12-year-olds. They have the same
interdependent attitude.”
The sisters have toured Europe and the
Far East as well as the United States.
One gets the impression that they travel
with the protection of the convinced and
dedicated and that otherwise surly offi-
cials wilt before their beaming faces and
make their paths easy.
They founded the Australian Child-
ren's Theatre with their own capital.
Over the years they have prospered
financially and established a head-
quarters at Kew, Victoria.
Here a full-time secretary is kept busy
answering letters and arranging tours for
the company. Besides themselves, the
sisters sponsor tours by other artists and
have brought out such world-known
people as the Hogarth puppeteers and
Viennese dance-mime artist Cilli Wang.
“ACT House will be a heritage for the
children,” Betty said. “Make sure you
don’t write it with fullpoints; it becomes
confusing that way. We publish song
books, two so far, and answer letters that
come in from all over the world. We
recently had a request from Malta asking
when we were going to visit Valetta.
People want to know how to make pup-
pets or masks—so many things.”
The sisters tour in a caravan and this
is their only permanent residence, so
making contact with them isn’t easy.
They estimate they have played to close
on two million children in Victoria,
South Australia, Tasmania and New
South Wales over the past three years.
They frequently give two shows a
day, usually with the blessing of the
local education authorities, and the
children pay 2s. each to attend. “But,
of course, many children can’t afford
2s. and we perform for them without
charge. Our bookings are arranged by
secretaries in each State. This particu-
lar tour will last four years.”
What do they do in their leisure time?
Betty smiled through her make-up.
“Spare time!” The idea was patently
amusing. “We have very little spare time.
When we do we usually go to other
people’s theatres.”
All performances are limited to one
hour. Props are few and they believe in
calling on the children's imagination.
Educationalists have praised their work
and many schools use their material in
elementary drama development.
While they claim to be against talking
or acting down to the children, there is
little of the truly sophisticated about
their performances. Their world is
strictly “folksy”. Characters are bucolic
rather than urban. The world of elec-
tronics and spaceships might never have
come into being as far as they are con-
cerned.
Whether the child feels any conflict
between this never-never world and the
bustling cities in which they live is
something else again. Certainly the sis-
ters feel no qualms. They have em-
barked on a mission and after years and
years of developing it they have the
cheerful conviction that their road is
the right one.
“If you wanted to sum up you might
say our credo is something we learned
in the United States —Circulate money!
Organise on your own feet! Move
fearlessly!”
Clearly, in the world of Joan and
Betty Rayner fears have no place. One
emerges to the world of prowlers,
souped-up cars, mayhem and Beatles
just a little frightened. But which is
the reality in the children’s minds is
something for the psychologists. I cer-
tainly wouldn’t know.

One-Way Ticket
from New Guinea
But the “Malaita" goes
north full
By ROY OLLIS
Eric Thomas is a cheerful, friendly
man who first went to New
Guinea in 1932. ... “I was an
accountant with Bulolo Gold building
their second dredge.”
He was also “with Oil Search in vari-
ous drilling areas and my last tour was
as camp manager for ninety men. Oh,
and I’ve done a bit as a bookie's clerk.”
Eric and his wife Lurline seem to me
typical of the free-and-easy Territorians.
They are not very ready with prepared
statements but they know many places
and people and events and developments,
so my interview with Eric was made up
of many little chats on deck or over a
beer.
“Why are you leaving?”
“For me it's easier. 1 have no pro-
perty there or other essential interests.
I’ve spoken to everybody on this ship
and they all say New Guinea is becoming
less and less attractive to Australians, and
that if everybody up there now could get
out without financial loss that 95 per
cent of the whites would do so.
“Jobs are going begging. I know of
several good jobs vacant now that a few
years ago would have been snapped up.
They’ve remained vacant despite repeated
advertising.
“I know of one employee found guilty
of a serious misdemeanor recently. Six
months back he’d have been sacked and
gaoled, but in the present crisis he was
pardoned and retained simply because
he’s an experienced employee whom
they know would be almost impossible to
replace today.
“People are leaving partly because of
a loss of confidence in New Guinea and
partly because life there is no longer
the fun it used to be. Mainly the latter
in my camp.
“Education of children is another
cause, and, of course, there’s the alarming
increase in rape to worry parents of
young girls.
“Health knocks a lot of people out,
up here.
“Also I know many chaps who’ve left
simply because the wife refuses to stay.
“New Guinea has been very good to
me. I’ve got a grand horde of friends,
and I leave with mixed feelings.
“I’ve got no set plans for Australia.
Might buy a business, or a small hotel.
I've been in the hotel business before.
“Really I suppose I am leaving be-
cause the native set-up is not too good
now. I wouldn’t be surprised to see
violence there more-or-less soon. John
Broomfield says this new cry of ‘Killim’
might not mean ‘murder’ but just ‘stop’.
In pidgin you say ‘Killim’ if you want
to stop an engine or put a lamp out. But
in Moresby I’ve heard natives coming
out of the pubs at closing time shouting
‘Murder the European’. There's nothing
ambiguous about that.”
“I heard that, too. Only in Moresby.”
“ Yes, Moresby is worst. Centre of
administration.
“The change has been sudden. The
manager of United Bakeries, Tommy
Turner, told me when native drinking
started that bread consumption dropped
by 1000 loaves a day and has never
recovered.
“Banking friends tell of natives who
had always been ‘deposit’ men until
native drinking, and suddenly they were
making large withdrawals, for themselves

and masses of mates. And that’s despite
the new higher wages.
“These boys like a fight, you know,
and beer makes them brave. Maybe it’s
only the beer yelling out ‘Killim’ but
unfortunately it’s catching on. It could
be being organised, but nobody’s been
killed yet.
“And sentences lately have been too
light. Three months each for rape or
attempted murder.
“Did you notice that ship's wash-boy
at Lombrum? He was walking up the
street with a parcel of shirts when a free-
for-all fight started. I saw him carefully
put down the shirts, wade into the fight
for a few good hits, then walk away,
pick up the shirts carefully, and carry
on with his errand.
“Old P. J. McDonald said to me when
I was going—he’s the chap, over 70 now,
who refused to leave his plantation for
the Japs and simply stopped there as
manager and protected his place—PJ
said to me, ‘I stopped when the little
gorilla characters had it, but I won’t stop
to be misused by these natives. You’re
right to leave’.
“Without exception one's friends agree
that to leave is wise. And they envy
your departure. The only man who
tries to talk a man into staying or return-
ing is his boss.
“A fair go for the natives is vital;
but no more vital than a fair go for the
Europeans.”
“What will happen if the whites do
leave?”
“If they all left there would be chaos.
People in Australia don't understand
natives but it’s a fact that a boy can
know how to do something and be paid
to do it, but unless there’s someone
there to tell him to do it and get him
started then it simply won’t get done.
“These people go home for the week-
end and have some emotional upset or
too much betel nut and on Monday
morning they have forgotten every mor-
tal thing they ever knew about their job.
They might have been using a machine
for six months and then suddenly they
don’t even know what it is, let alone how
to use it.
“How would it be if that happened to
the Prime Minister?
“People unfamiliar with natives simply
cannot credit it.”
“The same thing has happened to me
in Africa,” I said.
“There you are, then. If the whites
left, all production would stop, all public
services finish. The best we could hope
for would be a quick and fairly smooth
reversion to savagery.
“Or, if the whites do not leave, then
the ones left here will be subject to
native tyranny like the Dutch in Indo-
nesia.
“When this new parliament of theirs
sits, nearly all the natives expect they’ll
assume immediate control of all Euro-
pean possessions: cars, homes, shops. A
sort of Cargo Cult come true.
“Only a handful of them understand
what’s meant by acquiring political con-
trol and some of this handful are already
marked down for the chop. Everyone
knows that.
“The mass here don't want to make
laws; they want to take cars and radios.
And they will. If twenty men walk into
your house and take your radio, what
can you do? Law will collapse.
“It’s nothing new. It’s happened in
other countries and the people who’ve
been raped or robbed are simply dis-
missed as the price of present-day ‘pro-
gress’.
“Lurline and I simply don’t want to be
there when it happens—and it will hap-
pen to a greater or lesser degree. It's
started already. The pattern is clear
and the tempo is fast.
“I hope Australia's going to offer
something better. You never know
though, do you, these days? Not rape
and all that but there’s some things just
about as hard to take and they go on
forever.
“Anyway, we'll see. For us, New
Guinea is finish true. But I did get a
re-entry permit before I left. Just in
case.”
Throughout all this, sturdy old
Malaita prepares for Voyage 190
back to New Guinea. Burns Philp
assure me she will carry a full comple-
ment of passengers.

the face of Email you know best
Most Australians will recognise a
product or two here! Yes, that is your
refrigerator. And that is the range you
plan for your new home. Yes, your
washer, heater, television set, radio,
your coffeemaker. You can spend some
time just enumerating the brands that
are Email!
All these are products of Email. They
are all well known and demonstrate a
proud record of service and efficiency.
But the interesting thing is that they
are only one facet of the Email story.
Way and beyond the consumer products
activities that are demonstrated here
are the many Email interests that range
from power distribution apparatus to
cleansing the very air we breathe.
This wide diversification of interests,
that is so typical of Email, works for
Australia in many ways. It means
shared skills and resources for each
Email Division. It offers financial
stability and strength. Here then is the
promise and realisation of Email's
policy—a policy of finer products and
continued growth.

Down to the Last Doorknob
" We will not prostitute ourselves to
create an aesthetic nightmare"
By JAN SMITH
IN fine white shirt and bow tie, Harry
Seidler looks like a visiting American,
interchangeable with nine out of ten
Americans who have come here to con-
vince us that what this country really
needs is a good chain of laundromats,
supermarkets, method theatre or “Play-
boy” bunnies.
But Mr Seidler's business is housing
and building. A Viennese Jew who
came to Sydney via Canada and South
America in 1945, he can't remember a
time when he wasn't going to be an
architect, and recalls supervising from
Vienna's footpaths the new Government
flats of the post-depression 'thirties.
Seidler left Vienna for England in
1939, and on the day Churchill came to
power, says Seidler wryly, he was in-
terned for 20 months. He was later ship-
ped to Canada as a reasonably desirable
colonist, studying at the Universities of
Manitoba, Toronto and finally at Har-
vard with Walter Gropius, whom Seidler
regards as his major formative influence.
A Seidler house is all Seidler. “I may
sound autocratic about it, telling people
what to have, down to the last doorknob
and cushion, but we discuss it first and it
always works out well,” he said. Tough
clients, far from being a hazard, are a
welcome challenge to his belief that an
architect's function is to translate a
client’s taste.
“We will not prostitute ourselves to
creating an aesthetic nightmare,” Seidler
explained.
With preliminary discussions of cost,
there is no chance of the householder
running out of money once the roof is
on. “If they have something they want
to dispose of from their old house, I’ll
even sell it for them,” said Mr Seidler
generously. If they won’t sell, he will
try to incorporate it into the new decor.
Seidler admits with some amazement
that he is still on speaking terms with his
old clients, who include his mother and
an uncle. “It’s a legend in architecture
that people don’t speak to you after
you’ve built them a house, which is un-
derstandable, because a house is such a
personal thing. A person who wakes up
every morning in a bedroom he hates is
naturally going to blame the architect.”
Most architects have a contract clause
with safeguards against clients with
second thoughts, but not Seidler.
Seidler will never forsake the small
private house. “It requires extreme
aesthetic discipline,” he explained, a neat
way of indicating that, in most cases,-
individuals are more watchful of their
pennies than big corporations are of their
pounds. One of his latest jobs was a
£3OOO house at Lurline Bay for a fire-
man and his wife.
Lend Lease House, overlooking the
Quay, is one of Seidler’s major public
buildings. A lift with sides of woven
metal rises to the tenth floor, where Seid-
ler's office looks out, under aluminium
louvres, to the crenellated tops of Gov-
ernment House and surrounding park-
land. The walls are white and seagreen,
but to Harry Seidler, who is red-green
color-blind, they are a little different.
For critical decisions, he consults his
wife, an associate architect for the last
four years. “She's very good at making
quick decisions,” Seidler said. “One
glance and she can tell what needs
doing.”
Seidler is probably our only architect
to issue books about his work large,
lavishly-illustrated glossies with English,
French and German texts. It is not
entirely a record for self-congratulation.
“I wish you wouldn't keep looking at
that,” he said, flinching away from a
photograph of twin concrete humps
which form garage roofs for a cliff-
hanger home in Parriwi Street, Mosman.
Oeidler also lists among his early mis-
takes a tendency to favor American-
style white weatherboard and too much
glass. “I didn't realise the climate re-
quired different living conditions. Aus-
tralians have a reluctance to built-in
heating, and in winter the weatherboard
homes became freezers. I also found
timber and paint deteriorate quicker
here. The only thing that really endures
is masonry.”
Changing the subject, he turned to the
wall of photographs—ski lodges, Aus-
tralia Square, Blues Point Tower, bush-
land retreats and harborside units —most
of them built in the teeth of municipal
or private opposition.
His first battle was with Kuring-gai
Council over a house for his mother
which later won the Sulman Prize.
“Mother’s house was my first all-out
statement of modern architecture,” said
Seidler, indicating a picture of a kind of
framed box on legs. “Being in North
Turramurra, out of the elite area, it
didn't matter about its not being in
brick.”
A second battle, with the same coun-
cil, hinged on whether a glass wall was
a wall or a window. “They’re getting
more cunning now,” Seidler said. “They
don't object to the look any more, but
they put lawyers on the council to think
up trifling regulations about widths and
angles to prove we’ve infringed them.
That's how all politicians start, you know,
by getting on local councils.” The prac-
tice had led, he said, to architects placing
what amounted to an unofficial boycott
on certain councils, Woollahra being the
worst offender.
These early victories, he feels, have
opened the way for better planning, but
our basically social nature is at the
bottom of the present troubles. “People
won't consider their neighbors, or the
general look of their street,” he said.
“They live three feet away from each
other with picture windows, and every
house is exactly the same distance from
the front fence.” Seidler hates fences.
Seidler is also against ribbon develop-
ment, which puts large buildings and
shopping centres on main interstate and
arterial roads. “Farmer’s at Gordon is
a particularly bad example,” he said.
“Businessmen and councillors up there
have this 1920 s idea that more people
come into a store if the front door faces
the street.” Already, he said, traffic
congestion at this point was becoming
serious.
The asocial kink was also responsible,
said Seidler, for our reluctance to
encourage harborside planning. There
was far too much talk about individual
rights, and letting a person erect sky-
scrapers in unsuitable places, all based
on the erroneous idea that a person could
do what he liked with his own property.
“What’s done in reinforced concrete
can't be undone in a hurry,” he added.
Today his greatest torment is Austra-
lia’s apathy about planning and the in-
trusions of ill-informed municipal bodies.
“The only thing I can think is that they
actually like authority,” he mused.
Public wrath gave place to private
dreams when Seidler talked about his
new house at Killara —his third Austra-
lian home. His first home, which was
also his office, was with his parents at
Point Piper, where he worked for ten
years. After his marriage to Penelope
Evatt in 1958, they moved to a pent-
house suite at Seidler's Ithaca Gardens
at Elizabeth Bay.
The block has the singular advantage
of being highly private and inaccessible
—“it's aesthetically divorced from every-
thing else" —allowing for complete free-
dom of expression.
With the new house Seidler hopes to
achieve a perfect union of infinity and
intimacy, to suggest space without sacri-
ficing privacy. “There used to be a
vogue for open-plan houses with a bath-
room in the middle and everything else
running together,” Seidler said, “but
that's not the answer.” His own answer
is still on the drawing-board.


OVERSEAS
A Showdown in
Mississippi?
The Klaus come marching in.. .
From GODFREY HODGSON in Washington
showdown may come at any time
now in Mississippi, notoriously the
hardest and most violent of all the
Southern States in its determination to
resist the slightest break in the pattern
of racial segregation and white supre-
macy.
Hundreds of white and Negro stu-
dents, girls as well as boys, are moving
into the State from other parts of the
country to help local Negroes to register
as voters.
Thousands of white Mississippians
have joined organisations sworn to stop
at nothing to scare the Negroes and
their friends out of their voting cam-
paign.
The Justice Department in Washing-
ton this week ordered the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to hunt for
three of the registration workers who
are missing. They are Andy Goodman,
aged 20, and Mickey Schwerner, aged
24, both from New York; and James
Cheney, a 22-year-old Negro from Mis-
sissippi. Goodman and Schwerner
arrived on Saturday from Oxford, Ohio,
after going through a week’s briefing
on the facts of life in Mississippi with
the first batch of volunteers at a “free-
dom school” last week.
A fortnight ago they drove to Phila-
delphia, Mississippi, to see the ruins of
a church burnt down by armed whites.
They were stopped by local police,
gaoled on a speeding charge, fined, re-
leased and escorted out of town at 10.30
at night. They have not been seen or
heard of since.
Their burnt-out car was found and
civil rights workers and officials in
Washington fear the worst. Two hun-
dred sailors and eight helicopters were
sent to join in the search on the personal
order of President Johnson. Thirty
to 40 Negroes have been beaten, and
perhaps five killed, in Mississippi this
year. Yet there is little the Federal
Government can do.
The Governor of Mississippi, Paul
Johnson, is thought to be privately
anxious to prevent violence, though he
succeeded Ross Barnett thanks to a
vehement anti-Negro campaign. He has
ordered his State troopers to help the
FBI, but the Federal Government can
only act where breaches of Federal law
are alleged; murder is not a Federal
crime.
Many local policemen in small Missis-
sippi towns consider the preservation of
white supremacy as their main duty, and
cannot be counted on to put down
segregationist violence—if indeed they
are not guilty of it themselves.
There is also ominous news that the
Ku-Klux Klan is moving into Missis-
sippi. In the past Mississippi was so
much the strongest bastion of segregation
that Mississippians joined the ostensibly
more respectable White Citizens Coun-
cils instead. But in the past few weeks
there have been reports of Klan acti-
vities all over the State. One night a
few weeks ago in an apparent demon-
stration of strength the Klan left its
trademark by burning fiery crosses at
the same hour in 60 different counties.
The Klan is also openly taking the
lead in the resistance to desegregation in
north Florida. In St Augustine, where
Dr Martin Luther King himself is lead-
ing a campaign of non-violent demon-
strations, the Sheriff, Mr L. O. Davis, is
a violent segregationist and is believed
to be a member of the Klan.
Several dozen members of the Klan
have infiltrated a local group called the
Ancient City Hunting Club, and it is
these Klansmen that the Sheriff has
deputised to help out his tiny police
force.
In the much larger nearby city of
Jacksonville, the Klan has held a “Kla-
valcade” openly, 300 strong, in hoods
and robes last month; and a lawyer from
Atlanta, J. B. Stoner, who is one of the
leaders of the Klan there, has been
openly whipping up segregationist feeling
in the town.
It is more accurate to speak of the
Klans, rather than the Klan, since there
are several rival factions in different
States, united by their hatred of Negroes,
Jews and Catholics, and by their tradi-
tional mummery and secret violence that
has come down from the period after
the Civil War.
rpHE original Ku-Klux Klan was found-
ed as a joke by six young veterans
of the Confederate Army in Pulaski,
Tennessee in 1867. Within months it
had spread like wildfire as a secret
society to intimidate the newly emanci-
pated Negroes. With the elaborate
rules, fancy dress, and outlandish ter-
minology characteristic of the fraternal
orders of the time, it was led at first by
the “respectable” elements of Southern
society. One of its first chiefs was the
beloved General Nathan Bedford For-
rest, a chivalrous hero of the Civil War.
Very soon, however, it was taken
over by backwoods sadists, who flogged
and lynched white enemies as well as
Negroes who voted Republican. It was
first disbanded by the respectable leader-
ship, and then outlawed by the (Re-
publican) Government. By the end of
the ’seventies, with white supremacy
firmly restored, the Klan was dead.

It was revived in 1915 by a scoundrel
called W. J. Simmonds, a preacher and
a travelling salesman, and vastly ex-
panded by an advertising man called
Edward Young Clarke and a dentist
called Wesley Evans, mainly as a
financial racket, but with new overtones
of anti-Semitism and Protestant bigotry
added.
At the height of its influence in the
19205, it had a million members, con-
trolled the legislatures of several States
in the North as well as the South, and
made fortunes for its organisers. It
collapsed as quickly as it had spread, by
the late 19205.
The third stage of the Klans began
almost as soon as World War II ended.
It seems to have been an almost spon-
taneous response to Supreme Court
rulings supporting Negro equality, given
a boost by those who used it against
union organisers, and taken up by local
fanatics of low intelligence.
The nominal head of the Klan is an
ex-rubber worker called Robert Shelton,
who lives in Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
where he has done well as a car sales-
man through his political connections.
Another powerful group is in and
around Atlanta, where the present boss
is called Calvin Craig.
Most sources agree that there are not
many more than 50,000 actual members
of all the rival Klans in the whole of
the Deep South. Only a small fraction
of these actually perpetrate the beatings,
murders, and bombings that the KKK is
notorious for. The pattern is of a hand-
ful of fanatically violent toughs, backed
not so much by the rest of the member-
ship as by the apathy or silent approval
of the white majority as a whole.
In Mississippi, for example, there are
moderates and liberals. Some have
spoken out with great courage, like Pro-
fessor James Silver, of the University of
Mississippi. He has just published a
book called “Mississippi: The Closed
Society”, describing how most Mississip-
pians have been intimidated into accept-
ing that segregation is the only way and
that all those who oppose it are Com-
munists.

which several hundred brave young
Americans are venturing this hot

Four-Star
Ambassador
Not just another General ...
A Profile
General Maxwell Taylor, who is
going to South Vietnam to replace
Mr Henry Cabot Lodge as Ameri-
can Ambassador and Proconsul there at
the height of another South-East Asia
crisis, is not just another general.
He has been a fine fighting soldier:
but he is also perhaps the most brilliant
of the new breed of political generals
produced here by the cold war who
have to be strategic intellectuals, alliance
diplomats and Presidential counsellors
into the bargain.
In Saigon Taylor will be carrying out
on the spot two fundamental lines of
American policy which he had as much
to do with shaping as anyone else. One
is the overall master strategy of “flexible
response” which has replaced the Dulles
doctrine of “massive retaliation”. The
second is the policy of trying to restrain
Communist pressure on South-East Asia
with the maximum of firmness and the
minimum of direct American military
action.
Since 1961, when he returned from
the retirement which he had sought after
bitter disagreements with the Eisen-
hower Administration, Maxwell Taylor
has been one of the half-dozen most
influential men in Washington, first as
President Kennedy’s personal military
adviser and, since the summer of 1962,
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the top military post at the Pentagon.
He has been a member of the inner-
most circle of Presidential advisers on
grand strategy and the all-important
frontier where military and foreign
policy meet, on a level with men like
Robert Kennedy, McNamara and Mr
George Bundy all of whom volun-
teered for the job in Saigon.
Yet in a city where most of the great
have their partisans and even generals
play the game of politics and public
relations, Taylor has been out of the
gossip and the headlines. He is every
inch the professional soldier, erect and
correct, quiet and shy.
He was born in Missouri in 1901 and
graduated fourth in his class at West
Point, the American Sandhurst. He re-
turned to West Point, first to teach
French and Spanish in his late twenties,
and again after the war as superinten-
dent, the job from which Robert E. Lee
went to his brilliant and tragic career.
He was always marked out as a high-
flyer, and as an extraordinary linguist
he saw service in Europe, Latin America,
China and Japan in peacetime.
He now speaks French, Italian, Ger-
man, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and
Mandarin Chinese. When war came he
was one of those who built up the
American airborne divisions, and then
he commanded one of the most famous
of them, the 82nd. He was in Sicily,
Italy, in the Arnhem operation and in
the Ardennes.
After these excitements came a quiet
interlude at West Point and then Taylor
started a steady climb to the top. He
was the first US commander in Berlin,
Deputy Chief of Staff in Washington,
commander first of the Eighth Army
then of the whole war force in Korea.
In 1955 he reached the top: Chief of
Staff of the Army.
What he found when he got there he
described in the book he wrote after
his resignation in 1959. He called it
“The Uncertain Trumpet’’. It was an
angry book. Taylor found himself out-
voted and frustrated at every turn as
Army representative among the Joint
Chiefs and his book was in part both
an outburst of that frustration and
special pleading for the Army.
"Dux it was more than that. Eloquently
logical, it was a devastating assault
on the strategy of massive retaliation.
Instead it argued that the US should
be ready even if it meant a vast
additional burden of arms expenditure
—to fight any kind of threat at any
level of force. This was the doctrine
of flexible response, indistinguishable
from what is sometimes called the “Mc-
Namara strategy”.
Taylor’s aides shrug off the question
whether or not he was the originator of
the new thinking. Certainly before
Kennedy became President, Taylor was
already preaching that we were entering
an era of mutual deterrence by two
great nuclear Powers and calling for
forces that could meet Communist
aggression at every level as an alter-
native to reliance on the increasingly
implausible threat of Armageddon.
His ideas seem to have grown out of
his experience. Thus, his opposition to
committing American land forces on
the continent of Asia comes from what
he saw in Korea —and from professional
forebodings about using regulars in
terrain where they could be bogged
down. He attacked the doctrine of
massive retaliation because he saw what
it was doing to his Army when he was
Chief of Staff: the money was going to
General LeMay’s Strategic Air Com-
mand, and the Army’s equipment and
morale were running down fast.
Taylor and President Kennedy had
met only once, at a dinner in Boston
some years before. Someone recom-
mended Taylor for an inquiry panel and
it was then that he so impressed Robert
Kennedy that he was taken into the
White House. Soon his advice was
being asked on every subject.
It was in October, 1961, that his
recent involvement with South-East Asia
began. In that month he was sent with
Walt Rostow, of the State Department,
to Vietnam to see how the war was
going. The report they brought back
was top secret; but it is known that the
liberal professor was for stepping-up the
war even to the extent of air raids on
North Vietnam, while the professional
military man favored a subtle mixture
of political and military policies, with
the South Vietnamese doing as much of
the fighting for themselves as possible.
During President Kennedy’s lifetime
Taylor played an important role. A firm
advocate of military strength, he avoided
professional bellicosity: for example, he
played a crucial part in the passage of
the test ban treaty by overcoming the
suspicions of senior officers who might
otherwise have testified damagingly
against it.
After President Johnson came into
the White House, Taylor became more
and more involved with South-East
Asia. He has made several trips out
there and accompanied McNamara on
his important journeys earlier this year.
Whether he will find himself fighting
another war at the end of his career
he was to have retired this autumn
does not depend on him. His record
shows that, like a true professional, he
is not looking for a fight, (ofns.)

FORUM
A Catholic Case
for the Pill
The purpose of marriage is the
good of society ...
By a Roman Catholic Priest
Non-Catholics are often annoyed by
the apparent unwillingness of the
spokesmen of the Catholic Church
to put all their cards on the table. Fre-
quently they feel that they have been
treated like small children who are still
too young to know the facts of Catholic
life. More and more Catholics appear to
be feeling and expressing the same re-
action to the generally high-handed dis-
regard for frankness on the part of
official and semi-official spokesmen of the
Catholic Church, especially in NSW.
The general tone of the recent edition
of “Four Corners” which dealt with the
Catholic Church's attitude to the pill
was one of tension, apprehension and
subtle evasion. Many Catholics were
quite disturbed by the performance of
Fr Jeremiah Hogan, SJ, the Professor
of Moral Theology at Canisius College,
Pymble, the training centre of the pres-
tigious Jesuit Order. One could have
expected a clear-cut statement of the
“status questionis”. However, Fr Hogan
was hesitant, unconvincing and wily; he
made the objections of the Catholic
Church to contraception sound ludi-
crously inadequate. Both Fr Hogan and
Mrs Woodburn—the second panelist—
gave the impression that they were being
questioned about the secret activities of
the Mafia and that on no condition were
they going to implicate themselves one
way or another. They were not too
sure of some of the details of the local
ecclesiastical party-line, but they were
making very sure that they did not step
out of it. <
It is a principle of practical moral
theology in the Catholic Church that
when there is some real doubt about the
lawfulness or otherwise of an action the
penitent has the benefit of the doubt.
What is annoying many intelligent Catho-
lics is the refusal of local Catholic pub-
lications and spokesmen to acknowledge
any doubt with regard to the use of the
anovulant pill. Various Catholic spokes-
men exude in their respective analyses
of the morality of the pill what appears
According to the author of this
article, a Melbourne priest, the Roman
Catholic Church has as yet no official
attitude to the use of The Pill; that
opinion is still in the process of for-
mation. His article is an attempt to
state “what could be a Catholic case
for the use of the anovulant pill to
avoid conception. It could be the
arguments are not sound . . . but if
they have no other effect than elicit
more convincing arguments than have
so far been presented by the oppo-
nents of the pill (in this country),
they will have done some good”.
to be an incorrigible certitude about its
use to avoid contraception being evil.
What they have failed to do so far is
communicate something of this monu-
mental certitude to intelligent Catholics.
Quite a few Catholics find the argu-
mentation on which the convictions of
these men are based singularly uncon-
vincing. If it were simply a question of
theological exposition Catholics would
not be so disturbed. But the claim is
made over and over that nature itself
dictates that the use of the pill to avoid
conception is evil. It seems that there
is a group of theologians in NSW who
share an infallible insight into the dic-
tates of nature, an insight not afforded
to the Continental theologians, e.g., Rev.
Louis Janssens, who advocate the use of
the pill, nor to many Catholic lay people
who are willing to recognise a valid
argument if and when they see it.
The conservative theologians of NSW
would explain and charitably excuse the
opinions of the Continental advocates of
the pill in terms of their being inflicted
with a variety of philosophical “-isms”,
notably existentialism. They would point
out that ecclesiastical speculation in NSW
has been mercifully free of these un-
fortunate trends and consequently the
limpid atmosphere of the theological
climate here allows us to see that" the
doubts suggested by the likes of Janssens
are merely chimerical.
The issue is, however, even for a
Catholic, still debatable. The “authorita-
tive” statement of Bishop Carroll,
Auxiliary Bishop of Sydney (“Catholic
Weekly”, June 4), gave many Catholics
the impression that there was and could
be no debate. Yet a report in the Bris-
bane Catholic paper (“The Catholic
Leader”, June 11) which significantly
has not appeared in “The Catholic
Weekly” quotes the secretary of the
Holy Office, Cardinal Ottaviani, in rela-
tion to local Church authorities and
statements on the pill: “. . . in general it
is not pleasing to the Holy See that one
or other local authority express doctrinal
concepts on debated questions, which
rather require central direction, since
they can display opposing attitudes and

a divergence of opinions and since in
these matters, especially in doctrinal
matters, it is necessary to preserve unity
of thought and expression. Therefore,,
it is necessary rather that the supreme
teaching authority of the Church speak
out on such grave and debated questions,
which cannot be left to the views of the
individual, be he a cardinal or a bishop”.
It is not difficult to understand the con-
fusion of Catholics. They have read
reports of statements made by prelates
and theologians overseas justifying the
use of the pill to avoid conception; yet
nearly all discussions of the issue by
Australian prelates or theologians con-
demn its use out of hand. Among such
condemnations we have those of three
of the leading theologians of the Arch-
diocese of Sydney: Dr James Madden,
Professor of Moral Theology at St Pat-
rick's College, Manly; Fr Jeremiah
Hogan of the Jesuit College at Pymble
and Fr Wilfred Radford of the Seminary
of the Marist Fathers at Toongabbie.
Fr Radford's article “Morality and the
Pill” appeared in “Harvest”, a glossy
little publication of the Marist Fathers.
Fr Radford insists on the immutable
character of the moral principles of the
natural law. What are these principles?
Three basic ones would be:
(i) That any power or faculty must
be used in accordance with its purpose.
(ii) That the good of the human race
cannot be subordinated to the good of an
individual.
(iii) That as a result of the absolute
value of a human person, one human
person cannot be used as a means to
any lesser end or purpose.
Fr Radford seems to imply that the
advocates of the use of the pill are
somehow undermining or denying these
immutable principles of natural law
morality, and that the only way that the
principles of natural law (and therefore
Christian) morality can be preserved is
by adopting the theological conclusion
he reaches. Indeed, nearly all the
Australian theologians, who have ap-
peared in print condemning the use of
the pill, seem to make their application
of the moral principles co-extensive with
and all but synonymous with the prin-
ciples themselves.
This insistence on principles has been
an aspect of Catholic theological and
philosophical writing that non-Catholic
intellectuals and philosophers have found
most mysterious. Often they cannot find
out what these principles are; very often
they agree with them when they do not
find out what they are, but they do not
find them the panaceas for solving philo-
sophical and moral problems that the
conservative Catholic philosophers and
theologians find them.
And here is the central difficulty. The
advocates of the use of the pill do not
deny the moral principles of natural
law. They do not claim that human
nature changes. But they do think that
our understanding of human nature and
our understanding of the purpose of the
various powers and faculties can and
does change.
It is possible that the Church has not
fully understood the purpose of the
various aspects of or elements in mar-
riage. Perhaps there are distinctions yet
to be made to give us a fuller under-
standing of this extremely complex insti-
tution. The idea of the development of
the understanding of human nature and
even of Christian teachings is one which
is quite acceptable to the Catholic
Church. Few will deny that the purpose
of the institution of marriage is the good
of the human race, i.e., the human society.
Few would deny that this is perhaps
the primary purpose of the institution
of marriage. Far too often, however,
Catholic theologians make no distinction
between the institution and the act of
marriage. Mr Ginnane drew attention
to it in “Four Corners’’, but seemed
unaware of its significance. The Catho-
lic theologians insist that the primary
purpose of the act of marriage, i.e., inter-
course, is the procreation of children.
This is so amongst animals, for the act
takes place amongst animals only when
conception is, in principle, biologically
possible. It seems strange, therefore,
that amongst human beings, where for
at least 24 days out of 28 conception is
biologically impossible, that the con-
ception of children should be the primary
purpose of the act of intercourse. As
a general rule, therefore, it would seem
that the conception of children is neither
the primary purpose of the couple in-
volved nor of the biological process.
MThat is the primary purpose of the
act of marriage? It could be what
can be called the good of the domestic
society.
The Catholic Church recognises these
three spheres or levels involving human
beings: the human society, the domes-
tic society, the individual person; the
Catholic Church also recognises a hier-
archy amongst them. The purpose of
the institution of marriage is the good
of the human society and violations of
the institution, e.g., clivorce, must be
considered in the light of the good of
the human society.
If the purpose of the act of marriage
is the good of the domestic society, its
main function will be to create and
maintain the atmosphere of love which is
of the essence of the domestic society.
In other words, it is possible that the
Catholic Church has not yet developed
to the full its teachings on the act of
marriage. Some writers have pointed out
that when St Paul speaks of the love of
husband for wife, he makes no mention
of the purpose of this love as being for
the begetting of children. He speaks
of it as a giving of one person to another.
One cannot read Ephesians V, 22-33,
without being struck by the predomi-
nance of the physical aspect of Paul's
concept of the love of husband and
wife.
It could be that, for St Paul, the essence
of married life consists in the giving of
one to the other, their being “two in one

flesh”. This physical giving of one to
the other as a symbol of and a cause
of the unity of spirit or of marital love
cannot be off-handedly relegated to the
position of a secondary purpose of the
act of marriage.
The natural purpose of the act of
marriage should always fulfil this func-
tion as the symbol and cause of married
love. It is seldom that it can be the
cause of the conception of children.
This is not to relegate the conception of
children to a merely unimportant aspect
of intercourse. Certainly the conception
and successful rearing of children is inti-
mately dependent on the matrix of
marital love, and marital love cannot
achieve fruition when there is a positive
and total exclusion of one of its fruits,
viz., offspring.
Tt is rather significant, moreover, that
the Catholic Church requires, for the
validity of a marriage, only the ability to
complete the marriage act. It does not
require the ability to generate offspring.
In other words, impotence invalidates a
marriage, but sterility does not. What
is required, therefore, as the essential
for the constitution of the domestic
society is the ability to be “two in one
flesh”. If the ability to perform the act
of marriage and not the ability to beget
children is what is essential to constitute
the domestic society, it is difficult to see
how the begetting of children can be, in
the view of the Catholic Church, the
primary purpose of the act of marriage.
Surely this canonical legislation of the
Church implies that the primary pur-
pose of the act of marriage is the expres-
sion and creation of love.
When celibate theologians write about
marriage they tend to neglect a number
of aspects of it that are of basic import-
ance to the people involved in the
domestic society:
• That an atmosphere of love is
necessary for the proper development
of children:
• That the physical act of love is
necessary as a symbol of marital love
and as an increment to it.
The celibate theologians often speak
of the physical act of marriage simply
in terms of pleasure, as if the pleasure
were somehow a permissible sensual in-
dulgence for married people. This,
surely, is more than slightly Manichean.
There is, moreover, a strange ambiva-
lence in the Catholic attitude to the
essential part played by the physical ex-
pression of something that is primarily
spiritual. In sacramental theology, the
Catholic Church insists against many
Protestants on the need for the external
expression of the spiritual aspiration,
especially in the theology of the Mass.
This physical expression is in accord, it
claims, with the material-spiritual com-
plex which is man. Yet there does not
seem to be the same concern for this
in the sacrament of marriage and theolo-
gians and confessors will advise “con-
tinence” (the word seems quite inappro-
priate in the light of the teaching of the
Church in the sacramental sphere) with-
out any apparent misgivings about the
possible damage to the other values in-
volved in the good of the domestic
society.
There is also a strange unreality in
the advice of these theologians who, no
doubt, would otherwise be experts in the
casuistry of “occasions of sin”. In the
protection of their own celibacy they
would know that there are limits that
are well away from the reality beyond
which they dare not venture with im-
punity. Yet these same theologians
piously advise “continence” to two people
who are very much in love and who have
to sleep in the same bed seven nights a
week!
If, therefore, a married couple already
have as many children as they can
reasonably afford —and not only in the
economic sense —to rear, would the ar-
rival of another child be contrary to the
good of the domestic society? If they
avoid having another child by abstaining
from the act of marriage, and thus im-
pose strain upon each other when they
are already under strain, would this be
against the good of the domestic society?
If the good of the domestic society
demands that the married couple avoid
children, and that they also continue to
manifest and develop their mutual love
in intercourse, are all means of avoiding
conception justifiable?
The Catholic advocates of the pill
would say No! And here is the crucial
point. If the Catholic Church does
allow the use of the pill as a means of
avoiding conception it will not be alter-
ing its “traditional” teaching on contra-
ception.
Some conservative theologians have
claimed that there is no basic difference
between the use of condoms and other
mechanical devices on the one hand
and the use of anovulants on the other.
These same theologians speak of the
use of anovulants as “direct sterilisation”.
(It is worth noting that in his statement
in 1958 Pius XII did not say of the use
of anovulants, “this is direct sterilisation”
but “there is question here of direct
sterilisation”. In other words, he left, in
the technical subtlety of Vatican pro-
nouncements, some room for discussion.)
Sterilisation, however, in the usual medi-
cal and moral use of the word, signifies
destruction of tissue or at least the
destruction of the functioning of an
organ.
T\ the use of chemical or mechanical
contraceptives, human tissue is
destroyed or its function is destroyed.
The life process is interfered with. This
is precisely the evil that the Church
condemns. On the moral principles
enunciated by the Catholic Church
there can never be any justification
of this method of avoiding concep-
tion. This is “contraception”! The
purpose of the male gametes is quite
distinct from the act of intercourse and
the purpose of this tissue is the good
of human society. The tissue cannot be
destroyed directly to cater for the specific
good either of the person or of the
domestic society, because this would in-
volve the subordination of the human
to the domestic society. But is the same
reasoning validly applied to the postpone-
ment of the release of the ovum from the
ovary? As far as medical science is
aware, the ovum is not in any way dam-
aged or destroyed, nor is the function
of the ovary destroyed. The release of
the ovum is delayed; the release mechan-

‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too

This procrastination is like a disease

— the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder — so takes more

ism is suspended. But surely this is not
sterilisation, for we do not speak of the
suspension of the functioning of the brain
and other faculties during, for example,
an anaesthetic, as sterilisation.
It is worth noting here that some of
the Catholic conservative theologians in-
dulge in a technique for which they
would be severely reprimanded if they
were reading for Philosophy I in any
Australian university. They call the use
of anovulants by words that are already
charged with moral or emotional over-
tones, and thus load the scales of the
argument or discussion in favor of their
solution. Surely two of the essential
problems are:
• Is the use of anovulants an instance
of contraception?
• Is the suspension of the release of
the ovum an instance of sterilisation?
The conservative theologians call the use
of anovulants “contraception” and/or
“sterilisation” and then ask the ques-
tions:
• Is this form of contraception per-
missible?
9 Is this form of sterilisation justi-
fiable?
These same thelogians are only too
ready to brand their opponents with
“muddle-headedness”.
If it does appear, after analysis and
discussion, that the purpose of the act
of marriage is the good of the domestic
society, and if the use of anovulants is
not sterilisation but simply the postpone-
ment of the release of the ovum, the
use of anovulants to avoid conception
will be justifiable on Catholic and natural
law moral principles.
Tn outline the teaching of the Church
would then be stated:
• The primary purpose of the insti-
tution of marriage is the begetting and
education of children. Its purpose is the
good of the human society. A conse-
quence of this would be that the institu-
tion cannot be used in a way that will
subordinate the good of the human
society to the domestic or personal inter-
ests, e.g., divorce.
• The purpose of the act of marriage
is primarily to maintain and to increase
the atmosphere of love that is essential
for the begetting and successful rearing
of children.
9 For the good of the domestic
society and also for the good of the
human society it is sometimes required
that parents avoid conception. This
cannot be achieved by the destruction of
tissue that has as its only purpose, human
conception, i.e., neither male nor female
gametes or organs may be destroyed.
Conception may, however, be avoided,
by using the safe period or, when
necessary for the good of the domestic
society, by extending the safe period by
the use of anovulants.
If this did become the policy of the
Catholic Church there would be no
aspect of this policy which is not in full
accord with what the Church has already
taught. Moreover, this policy would be
justifiable in the light of the “immutable”
principles of natural law.
As medical science progresses many
of the problems concerning the pill will
not be of great practical concern. If
a pill is developed which wdll-allow the
accurate prediction of the fertile period,
then Catholics would be content to im-
pose “continence” for that period. This
degree of “continence” and this degree
of “sacrifice” would then be part of the
pattern of married love; it would not
become, as is demanded in some cases
now, a substitute for it.
There would still remain the unusual
case of the husband who is often away
from home. If he already has as many
children as he can rear with reasonable
care and his visit home coincided with
the fertile period, will the Catholic
Church allow the use of the pill on the
principle of the good of the domestic
society?
The Catholic Church has not decided
yet!
This is why it is remarkable that so
many theologians want to rush in and
impose their views with complete finality
on an uninformed and uncertain laity.
Surely Catholics can be told three basic
facts of the situation:
• That this is a new situation, a new
problem.
• That there are important theolo-
gians on both sides.
• That the Church has not made an
official pronouncement yet, and then left
Catholics to follow their own conscience
on this matter.
Until the Church decides or until the
theologians are morally unanimous, it is
inappropriate and even unjust for theolo-
gians to seek to impose a view as if it
were an incorrigible dictate of nature or
of the Church!


Around Melbourne
O, THE OPULENCE OF O!
T7<or weeks now our newspapers
have been carrying full page
advertisements: “CHANNEL O
OPENS AUGUST 1. THE MOST
EXCITING NIGHT OF 1964.” Just
the other day a weighty parcel arrived
in the mail. It opened to reveal a
splendid desk clock and pad, which
bore the message: “CHANNEL O
IS ON THE GO.” This is to counter
at all times the people who are rude
enough to chant “Dial O for Nought”.
But there is no question that Mr
Reg Ansett and his Austarama TV
have been very much on the go.
Channel 10 in Sydney, Channel 10
in Adelaide, and Channel O in Bris-
bane won’t open for business until
next March, yet he is bravely giving
himself eight months alone in the
new network; nobody to help with
the outlet costs.
Nor is that all. Over two months
he won permission from the Control
Board to start telecasting 12 hours
a day, and this he has done. It was
a crafty idea to get everyone des-
perate for O, even back in the early
months of May and June, and make
them pay their 50/- or so to have
their set converted for the new
channel.
So in the pre-opening months,
whenever we have turned on our sets,
O has been there. There have been
no commercials, no news sessions,
no election comment, just non-stop
programmes of documentaries
supplied by such people as Pan-
American, Shell, BP, and all sorts
of travel films, and many a winner
from the Cannes Festival. Oh, to
coin a phrase, those documentaries
have been restful, fascinating, and
many of us are pondering the thought
that we should make use of this sort
of twilight zone, because Channel O
could never be so wonderful again.
Last week the wraps came off and
the TV press was invited out to
Nunawading to see the wonder of it
all. Actually the studio is a long
way out, over 13 miles from the city,
in the new-cultural-population-explo-
sion-area, not that far from Waverley,
where the VFL is building its new
home. The location did not meet
with the approval of the TV writers.
However, the first sight of ATV-O
was most rewarding. HSV-7, in South
Melbourne, originally was a paper
store. GTV-9 in Richmond was the
old Heinz factory, where they used
to make the soup and the pork and
beans, but here, high on a hill-top,
was something opulent, shining and
solid. It was the Reg Ansett Hilton,
no less. It still needed the finishing
touches of Mr. Ansett’s heliport, the
swimming pool and the bistro, but
it looked very good just the same.
Len Mauger, the general manager
and former station manager of
ATN-7, Sydney, was there to greet
us. He told us that up to August 1
Austarama would have spent £3
million. Just possibly it was already
the best equipped station in Australia.
indeed, for some of the old
hands from the senior TV stations,
it was a very hard morning. The sort
of equipment they dreamed of acquir-
ing, say, 10 years hence, was now
being unpacked at O. There were four
studios, two large, two small. The
large studios, to the untrained eye,
each looked about the size of Madison
Square Garden with all the right
push-button machinery for flying in
scenery.
The floor was level to 1/1000th of
an inch and equipped to take up to
16 cameras. Did ATV have 16
cameras? It was unlikely they would
use 16 under such circumstances,
but the channel DID have 16, accord-
ing to Mr Mauger.
We looked at the special viewing
booths for sponsors, the green room,
a special comfortable room, where
performers could pause for medita-
tion before going on the air, and we
looked at the audio-mixing panel,
the equipment which could handle
up to 48 microphones on the floor.
The scenery store, beautifully
placed between all the studios, looked
just like a Qantas hangar.
I won’t bore you with a complete
rundown of equipment, but these
items are worth mentioning. There’s
a semi-automated programme control
unit worth £65,000. This means that
a whole evening’s entertainment can
be set up beforehand. Then with just
one man to press, the buttons, the
whole business can keep rolling like
a pie-making machine. There are
three large videotape machines and
two outside broadcast vans.
The whole place is wired for closed
circuit television. This means that
from their offices the executives can
watch what is going on at any time in
any of the four studios. Yes, Big
Brother and all his little brothers are
watching at ATV.
As for programmes, there will be
a heap of westerns like “Bonanza”,
semi-westerns like “Rebel” and “Ivan-
hoe”. There will be Phil Silvers and
Leonard Bernstein with the New York
Philharmonic. We have been offered
the TV scoop of the year, sole rights
to the Davis Cup at Cleveland, Ohio,
and we can only hope, for Mr Ansett’s
sake, someone we know will be play-
ing in it.
At this stage ATV has lined up
no really big names in the Bert New-
ton or Digby Wolfe class. The only
home-produced programmes we have
been told about are “Go”, a teenage
show compered by Alan Field, a
British comedian, a children’s show,
sporting shows and shows on news
and public affairs. So far there is
nothing that could be described as
Australian and, alas, no locally pro-
duced drama is in sight. It is still
early. Perhaps all this will come with
the O and 10 network.
But at this stage would it be out
of order to re-quote Mr Ansett from
the “Sun News-Pictorial” of April 6.
1963: “We plan to use 58 per cent
of viewing time and 75 per cent of
our outlay a year showing Australians
—and the rest of the world—what
Australia has to offer viewers. There
won’t be any cheap old American
movies. Channel O will give viewers
what they want; if they want westerns
we’ll give them westerns, but they’ll
be filmed in Australia, using Australian
situations, actors and writers.”
As Barry Humphries might have
said: “O, when will we see the Aus-
image?”

REVIWS
THEATRE
A Season of Experiment
The drama of the absurd
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
75th Anniversary Festival of Con-
temporary Drama. Sydney Uni-
versity Dramatic Society. Union
Theatre. Sydney.
A publicity notice for the SUDS
Drama Festival announced that at
some time during the Gala Opening
Night a “Happening” entitled "The
Aeroplane Crash” would take place,
which was “expected to take the guests
by surprise”. This “Happening”
occurred about half way through a cock-
tail party given as a curtain-raiser for
distinguished guests. At one end of the
reception room a curtain was drawn
back to reveal a mock aeroplane crash,
and students dressed as ambulance men
appeared with stretchers to carry off the
supposed victims. The “Happening'
went unnoticed by most of the large,
animated gathering that crowded the
big reception room.
At the Edinburgh Festival last year,
during a debate on “The Theatre of the
Future”, a nude girl was wheeled across
a balcony in a wheelbarrow. This
“Happening” upset the city fathers of
Edinburgh. If the point of a “Happen-
ing” is to shock, then the Edinburgh
one was a success, but SUDS appears to
have produced a damp squib.
A nude girl in a wheelbarrow appear-
ing in the middle of a learned debate;
a crashed aeroplane in the middle of a
cocktail party: these could easily be
scenes from a drama of the absurd.
But then they would be part of the
meaning of the play.
To attempt to introduce into real life
the sort of incongruous events that
occur in these plays, reveals a most
extraordinary muddle about the nature
of art. The distinguishing feature of the
avant-garde drama is a revulsion against
realism. It is not trying to imitate life,
but to create an imaginary world which
will illuminate the real world. An ex-
panding corpse in the living-room, a
pet elephant in the back yard: these are
metaphorical. If, for example, anyone
is inspired by “A Resounding Tinkle”
to go round putting elephants in people’s
back yards, they will probably create a
disturbance, but they will certainly show
that they have entirely missed the point
of the play.
A play, unlike a cracker, has a mean-
ing, and, if it is to attract an audience, it
must give some pleasure. Understand-
ably, the cracker aspect of the avant-
garde drama appeals particularly to un-
dergraduates. It seemed to me that the
whole Festival programme was designed
as an exercise in assault and battery,
rather than as a presentation of the
plays. Perhaps it will be thought that
I am judging student productions too
harshly, but 1 can say cnly that, although
I have enjoyed reading a number of
these plays, I found attending this Festi-
val a gruelling ordeal.
Most of these avant-garde plays are
witty and many of them are farces,
though usually “black” farces. A light
touch is needed, above all else.
“THhe Zoo Story” by Edward Albee
A seemed to me the best play in the
Festival, and Arthur Dignam's quiet per-
formance as Jerry, the suicide, the best
piece of acting. Albee’s wit, mastery of
language, excellent sense of timing and
ability to handle large themes, which
have been so much admired in “Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf”, are also dis-
played in this earlier work. It is pro-
duced by Harry Leventhal.
But all the other productions, although
they contain a few good performances,
are marred by crudities. The sets and
lighting are clumsy and unimaginative,
the sound effects noisy and distracting,
the wit labored; and, as a result, it is
impossible to sort out the weaknesses of
the plays from the ineptitudes of the
productions.
Ten plays by different authors, even
though the plays are short, is far too
ambitious an undertaking. Far better
to have presented a few plays with
understanding and skill.
Why has SUDS preferred quantity to
quality? I think a clue may be found
by looking again at the “Happening”.
Unlike a play, a “Happening” has no
meaning. It is merely a gesture, de-
signed to shock. It seems to me that the
whole Festival is such a gesture. In-
stead of taking each play seriously as
a work of art and attempting to present
it with imagination and artistry, the
students seem content to hurl the plays
at the heads of the public with gleeful
defiance. The only trouble is that the
public for the most part keeps its heads
well out of the way.
And yet a few weeks ago it was
almost impossible to get in to a lunch-
hour production at Grace Bros, Chats-
wood, of N. F. Simpson's avant-garde
play “A Resounding Tinkle”, put on by
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust for
suburban housewives. Which suggests
that there is an audience for avant-
garde drama if it is well done.
Perhaps the best way for student
dramatic societies to improve the stand-
ard of their productions would be to
hire professional producers. It seems
a pity that all this energy and enthusi-
asm should run to waste for lack of
proper direction.

Murray Walker and lan Burn. The
Argus Gallery. Melbourne.
Tn the past Melbourne dealers have
only accepted the exhibitions of
those young artists who were prepared
to meet the expenses involved. They
did not, until recently, seek out artists
and offer direct help in the form of a
retainer and exhibition facilities. The
South Yarra Gallery, Gallery A, and the
Argus Gallery are all now offering
various help to painters in return for the
sole right to deal in their pictures. In
this city where patrons are loath to sup-
port young, unacclaimed talent the most
realistic course for the artist is to have
a gallery obliged to sell his work.

at the Argus Gallery are Murray
Walker and lan Burn. Neither of these
aspires to be regarded as the most ad-
vanced artist in the town. References
in their paintings indicate their greater
interest rather in the painters of 1914
than in those of the immediate past or
present.
The subject matter of Walker’s land-
scape vignettes is the wild garden of the
idyllic mountain property on which he
lives. Here he is surrounded by goats,
dogs, wheelbarrows and trees. These he
sees joyfully and paints in intense color
on to white canvas. Melbourne painting
needs a happy colorist and decorator of
canvas such as Walker. At present his
watercolors, in which the paper, seen
through the transparent paint, unifies the
picture, carry more conviction than the
oils. In these the tone and intensity of
the color and drawn details do not al-
ways relate to the space created. Dedi-
cation to painting can rectify these faults
and it is such dedication which is the
great virtue of lan Burn.
This young man (born 1939) had his
first exhibition last year. It comprised
nudes and portrait drawings in pencil
and silver paint, and St Kilda beach sub-
jects in black or colored wash. Many
young artists are content to show their
ideas for paintings in full-scale oil
sketches. Burns is not. His current
work shows that he is concerned with re-
solving paintings from drawings and oil
sketches of sunburnt, sprawling beach
people. It is likely that Burn’s work will
evolve slowly. We must wait and see.
JAMES MOLLISON
Princely Taste
European Painting and Sculpture.
David Jones Fine Art Gallery.
Sydney.
“T find," said Sir Kenneth Clark, “my-
A self going to the Wallace collection
oftener and with more pleasure than
to any other London gallery, simply
because it is an harmonious whole.”
Thus princely taste is elevated, because
of its unity, above the compromise tastes
of a gallery committee. Something of
this unity of taste, admittedly expressed
infinitely more modestly than at the
Wallace, is evident in the collections of
antiques, objets d'art, sculpture which
Robert Haines brings together from time
to time at David Jones.
A collector himself, concentrating
mainly on European painting and sculp-
ture, Mr Haines, nevertheless, has a keen
sensibility for Thai, Cambodian and
Kmer carving and bronzes. During a
recent visit to South-East Asia he was
able to assemble and bring out of
Thailand a group of very high quality
pieces. His method is to have a plan
but to grasp buying opportunity when
and where it arises. To knowledge of
the antique market in Europe he adds a
rare capacity to assemble objects dis-
parate in time and culture, yet dis-
tinctly groupable through a common
claim to be considered works of art in
their own right. Only in exceptional
circumstances do gallery directors in
Australia have the opportunity to show
their hand in organising shows to reflect
this kind of taste.
Of this collection some pieces
—antiques, pottery, furniture, sculpture,
notably the beautiful portrait busts of
Jacob Epstein and a superlative Greco-
Roman head from Epstein’s own private
collection have been seen before, but
their quality is so high that they require
many visits to appreciate fully. Apart
from some recent Greek abstraction,
figurative painting commands attention.
Liseux, Despierre, Philip Sutton, Jean
Marchand, Dufont, Giulio and Emilio
Greco exude French-Italian elegance.

rpHE Frank Sinatra-like Steve Lawrence
A is a belter in a rather old-fashioned
mode, engaging our attention by a re-
lentlessly brisk driving home of the lyrics.
On “Academy Award Losers” he is well-
served by a number of sentimental dit-
ties which missed gaining Oscars: any
recording which features Cole Porter,
Jerome Kern, Arthur Freed and George
Gershwin, all at or near their best, is
scarcely to be ignored. The conventional
Billy May orchestrations are at their
best when least obtrusive, as in an excel-
lent “Long Ago and Far Away”, from
“Cover Girl”, Charles Vidor's memor-
able '4os musical. By the way, what-
ever happened to Steve Lawrence's for-
mer partner, the bright and silky Eydie
Gorme?
From the steady pop level to Ella
Fitzgerald's exalted plateau is a consider-
able distance. “Stairway to the Stars”
consists of a series of classic re-pressings,
mostly from releases of the 19305, in-
cluding several numbers featuring Chick
Webb, the immortal crippled bandleader-
drummer. The title number, “Five
O’Clock Whistle” and “Undecided'’ were,
of course, three of her greatest hits, and
it’s extremely convenient to have them
together on this disc. One of the most
notable features of these renditions going
back a quarter of a century and more is
the discretion of the accompaniments,
something a good many contemporary
vocalists might take note of. Too often
nowadays there’s a grim battle between
singer and orchestra in which neither
side emerges the victor. I doubt if 1964
will bring a more nostalgic LP than this
one.
Peggy Lee’s “In Love Again” is a
Jekyll-and-Hyde record. One side, en-
titled “Light and Lively” on the sleeve,
seems strained, forced, and often ugly:
“heavy and deadly”, I would say. The
star, with that cool voice like toothpaste
being squeezed slowly out of a tube,
has tried to force her style and the re- ;
suits are uncomfortable, to say the least.
But on the reverse, rather uninvitingly
called “Lush and Lovely”, she is herself
again, the most cerebral of the pop sing-
ers, an accomplished musician, antisep-
tically polished and assured. The ar-
rangements, played by a smallish combo
headed by Max Bennett, are subtle and

CHARLES HIGHAM
FILMS
Rorke’s Drift
Zulu. Director, Cy Endfield. Prince
Edward Theatre. Sydney.
“»Tulu,” directed by Cy Endfield, a
Hollywood expatriate in Britain, is
the story of the battle of Rorke’s Drift,
a disastrous engagement in which a
small British force fought off wave after
wave of Zulu tribesmen. It is a film of
admirable intentions, capably directed
and acted, but it remains in the mind
as a handsome Battle-piece.
Endfield has obviously fought against
the false glamor of war. He tries to
show it at its most bloody and un-
romantic; he scrupulously avoids taking
sides. There is no glory after the
battle the “victorious” British survivors,
tired, dirty and disgusted, face the task
of clearing away the heaps of dead.
But there’s no denying that screen
bloodshed isn't nearly as nasty as the
real thing; that those dapper red
uniforms inspire an unwilling surge of
jingoistic patriotism; and that you can’t
help taking sides when a few are pitted
against a great number. When I saw the
film, the revelation that the Zulus had
guns as well as spears brought forth
an angry murmur in which the word
“Unfair!” was almost audible.
The script is spare, the acting under-
stated —the officers and NCOs are calm
without seeming petrified, the other
ranks not too effusively comic. The
camerawork is nice-looking but un-
imaginative: the successive Zulu attacks
are photographed monotonously from
the same angle.
The film begins with a long, splen-
didly photographed Zulu wedding dance
which is quite irrelevant. Equally irrele-
vant are the characters of the Swedish
missionary and his daughter, who merci-
fully disappear halfway through the
film. Certainly Jack Hawkins gives a
colorful performance as a shaggy man
of God whose reaction to danger is to
get roaring drunk and bawl discourag-
ing Biblical quotations, but he and his
daughter (Ulla Jacobson, a- very dull
girl) are a pair of stock characters
totally at odds with the realistic in-
tention of the film.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUSIC
Cluytens
Fifth Subscription Concert (Red
Season). Melbourne Town Hall.
rFHE happiest of chances helped to
make this the finest concert we have
had for years. At the last moment
Andre Cluytens was forced to cancel
the Fourth Orchestral Suite of Bach,
and play in its stead the G Minor
Symphony of Mozart. There was no
soloist a rare delight and the
balance of programming was struck,
with the Mozart, superlatively well. The
Mozart, “La Mer” of Debussy, and the
Symphonie Fantastique: to find another
such programme we would have to go
back many years, until we remembered
that early visit of Klemperer which gave
us this same G Minor Symphony, the
“Consecration of the House” Overture,
and the Fourth Symphony of Bruckner.
Cluytens, whose success most people
could have predicted, gave the Berlioz
a stupendous performance. This, too,
was largely predictable: his touch for
French music is to the last degree fine
and sensitive. His timing is beautifully
nice, his shading of nuance and
dynamic so minutely contrived that there
is never a trace of effort or contrivance.
And, underneath this opulent concern
for the top line and surface of the
music, he watches without cease the
passionate and sometimes eccentric
heave of the lower parts, so that every
effect calculated into them by Berlioz
produces its true emphasis of that long,
nervous, upper melodic line.
If a performance is ever memorable,
then this one was: the more so for us
in Melbourne, coming as it did at a
time when our orchestra is under fire
because of its staffing troubles. Cluytens
was, it is true, betrayed by an execrable
passage from the little clarinet in the
fifth movement, and by the near de-
fection of the flute at the entry to the
coda of the first movement. But these
two things were, on the closest analysis,
the only signs of any orchestral weak-
ness.
With the Berlioz, then, Cluytens had
a literal triumph. But it was the suave
razor-edge of the G Minor Symphony
of Mozart which really laid open his
capacity as a conductor; and here, I
think, he deserved almost every word of
praise except the last and highest one.
His performance was wonderfully in-
stinct with a sense of the importance of
metre —so metrical, in fact, that we were
able to enjoy one of the most unusual
pleasures, the pleasure of hearing a
conductor who obviously understands
what Chopin meant by tempo rubato —a
firm, even pulse in the bass, measuring
against itself the slightest oscillation of
strict time in the treble. Then, Cluytens
played the work in its original scoring,
without the smooth and mellifluous
clarinets —a mark of sympathy and
understanding in any conductor. His
tempos were not only accurately main-
tained, but chosen with care and with a
keen judgment—maybe a trifle fast in
the slow movement, but still a true
andante, very grave, very apt to the
character of the music. Tact and con-
summate elegance informed the whole
performance, in short: and its only fault
was that this elegance, in the last resort,
seemed now and again to be cultivated
for its own sake.
This should not be read as an attempt
to cut down the level of Cluytens’ ex-
cellence, for it is an exception which
could only be taken to a conductor of
the first rank. But it was there all the
same, in the careful sanding and rebating
of each phrase, the reductions of dynamic
which went just that fraction over the
mark, and which took with them the
fine edge from the sforzando chords
which are Mozart’s only points of
emphasis in the whole symphony. These
brusque punctuations, so native to the
texture of the first and last movements,
must remain sharp and curt: to smooth
them over, as this performance did, is to
give the classical frame and temper of
the music too high a gloss of sophisti-
cation.

The Lure of Buried Gold
Long John Silver rides again
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Treasure Island. Robert Louis Steven-
son. Nonesuch Press. 445. 9d. Also
Dent. 13s. 3d.
“(y a chili September morning, by the
cheek of a brisk fire, and with the
rain drumming on the window, I began
‘The Sea Cook’, for that was its original
title.” Thus Robert Louis Stevenson
described how he sat down to write the
most marvellous adventure story ever
put on paper. He worked fast and with
a sort of inspired eagerness. The first
15 chapters flowed from his pen in as
many days, while his imagination swept
him off from the mist-sodden moors of
Braemar to the Admiral Benbow Inn, to
the quays of Bristol, to the tilting deck
of the Hispaniola and, finally, to Trea-
sure Island, the immortal island of boy-
hood dreams floating on the blue bosom
of the Spanish Main. Above the beat-
ing of the rain he heard the minister tap-
tap-tap of Blind Pew’s stick, the croaking
of Long John Silver’s parrot crying
“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”, the
buccaneers roaring “Fifteen men on the
dead man’s chest Yo-ho-ho and a
bottle of rum!”, the clash of cutlasses,
the thunder of surf on empty sunlit
beaches.
“It was to be a story for boys”, said
Stevenson. “No need for psychology
or fine writing ... No furniture for a
scholar’s library but a book for winter
evenings, when tasks are over and the
hour for bed draws near.”
And what a book it is! I would
prosecute with the utmosV rigor of the
law any parent who fails to provide his
young son with a copy of “Treasure
Island”. Fortunately such Draconian
severity is hardly necessary for, after 60
years of changing tastes, “Treasure Is-
land” remains one of the most popular
of all best-sellers. Apart from recent
editions of Ballantyne’s “The Coral Is-
land” and Meade Falkner's “Moonfleet”
it is almost the solitary survivor in print
of the host of books by Ballantyne,
Henty, Talbot Baynes Reid, Everett-
Green and others once devoured by
generations of Victorian, Edwardian, and
Georgian schoolboys.
Tlow is it that “Treasure Island” retains
its perennial appeal in this science-
fiction age? After all, to young people
the essence of romance is that it should
inhabit the regions of the perilous and
little-known. Our own world has shrun-
ken and yielded up many of its mysteries.
Years ago Walter de la Mare lamented
the lost lands of his childhood—“those
wild, icy, bear-infested haunts of Aurora,
the North and South Poles. They have
followed the unicorn not into extinction
but, far worse, into disrepute. Power-
stations multiply in darkest Africa. The
lion amid his harem sits to be snap-shot-
ted by a naturalist . . . The haunts of the
gorilla will soon, it seems, be dumb . .
Once it was a cruise to the Dry Tor-
tugas on sea-biscuit and salt pork, now
a voyage in an air-conditioned capsule
to Venus. Instead of pirate doubloons
there are rare minerals to be raped from
distant stars, bug-eyed monsters and
galactic dictators to be fought. But for-
tunately it seems that a child’s sense of
wonder needs more nourishment than
scientific gimmickry. The weakness of
science fiction is its inhumanity. You
can imagine yourself to be Davy Croc-
kett or Blackbeard because, though they
belong to far-off places and times, they
have one foot in the real recognisable
world still around us. A child’s imagi-
nation is tethered to things, not concepts.
How can you be a green-haired Martian
if you don’t know whether green-haired
Martians even exist at all?
But pirates did exist, they did bury
treasure, fly the Jolly Roger, cut throats
and sink ships. And the heroes and
villains of “Treasure Island” are not
only human beings—such as you and I
might have been if we'd been lucky
enough—but, as human beings should
be, they are the masters of their own
fates. They sing, carouse, laugh, fight,
behave nobly or wickedly because that
is the way people do behave. They sail
over the seven seas; they are not fired
across them like bullets by someone
pressing a button. Their destiny de-
pends on their own courage and skill,
not upon the calculations of a computer.
Like the characters in all good adven-
ture stories the voyagers to Treasure Is-
land belong to a world that is familiar,
but not quite familiar. They stand on
the mystical threshold between fairyland
and reality, not —like so many heroes
of outer space—on the border between
sense and nonsense.
Tt is always tempting to bewail the
A disappearance of the good old, un-
sophisticated, manly, “take that, you
black-hearted villain”, boys’ book of yore.
However, it must be admitted that not
much of the 19th-century outpouring of
adventure stories would be worth sal-
vaging today. A few Hentys and Bal-
lantynes perhaps. An enterprising pub-
lisher might make a sounding of the
market with a couple of paperbacks,
like the recent edition of “Moonfleet”.
Meade Falkner was no Stevenson. He
had little of the master's rattling pace
and vivid economy of language, but
“Moonfleet”, with its fine evocation of
18th-century life on the Channel coast,
its smugglers and hidden treasure, is one
of the best examples of its genre.
Ballantyne’s “The Coral Island”, re-
printed in 1953, also deserves its sur-
vival, though it bears many marks of

the old moral and instructional tales for
young people that reached their apogee
in the interminable prosings of “The
Swiss Family Robinson”. In fact it is
the cloven foot of didacticism, appearing
in so much 19th century children’s
literature, that would make the books
intolerable reading for young people
today. Straightforward adventure is
timeless. Lectures on the evils of the
slave trade, the therapeutic value of
saltwater bathing and the enormous
moral advantages of being a British lad
are not.
One of the splendid virtues of Steven-
son’s books is that they contain scarcely
a scrap of practical information about
anything. Stevenson admitted that the
Hispaniola should have been a brig but
he made her a schooner because he had
no idea how a brig was sailed. But I
would defy anyone to learn much about
navigating a schooner as a result of
accompanying Captain Smollett, Squire
Trelawney and their crew of desperadoes.
Treasure Island has pine trees, malaria,
sea lions, tropical swamps and freezingly
cold nights. But who cares? No prosy
explanations stop the sweep of the nar-
rative. We see all the characters two-
dimensionally through the eyes of young
Jim Hawkins, and we learn all we need
to know about them. Long John Silver's
tallow face, glittering eye and soft voice
tell us at once that he is evil. We know
that poor, shaggy old Ben Gunn is crazy
from the moment Jim sees him darting
goat-like through the trees. And no
writer ever excelled Stevenson's simple
directness of expression. Take this des-
cription of the end of that grim ruffian
Israel Hands: “He rose once again in
a lather of foam and blood and then
sank again for good. As the water
settled I could see him lying huddled
together on the clean, bright sand in
the shadow of the vessel’s side. A fish
or two whipped past his body. Some-
times, by the quivering of the water, he
appeared to move a little, as if he were
trying to rise. But he was dead enough,
for all that, being both shot and drowned,
and was food for fish in the very place
where he had designed my slaughter”..
“Treasure Island” was Stevenson's first
published novel and, magnificent though
some of his later books are, I don’t
think his inspiration ever ran quite so
pure again. “Kidnapped” runs it near,
and I remember how delightedly I cut
my historical teeth on “The Black
Arrow” some time before I could digest
the majestic banquets of Sir Walter
Scott. But “Treasure Island” remains
unique. Stevenson, of course, did not
invent the buried treasure mystique.
From it he distilled the classic adven-
ture tale in the English language. I
envy every boy who has yet to sail with
Jim Hawkins to Treasure Island.

Tf children chose awards themselves,
A many adults would be in for some
surprises. I do not think they would have
selected “The Green Laurel” (this year’s
Children's Book Award winner) out of
the books this year, despite the stylish
writing. One can understand grown-ups
liking it; one can also understand why
children might not. Endorsed for the
age-group “10 upwards”, it has a heroine
of 11, which automatically rules it out
for anyone older.
Lesley's father develops a chest com-
plaint and has to go to hospital, so the
family sells the train which they have
been running for children at country
shows, and move to a dreary housing
settlement near Sydney. Lesley’s friend-
ship with wealthy Meredith becomes
strained and she is drawn into a circle
of migrant children. From this point,
opportunities are missed all round. Ste-
fan is invested with the odd character
and slight madness that prejudice gener-
ally accords “the foreigner”. Although
one feels that the author would have
liked to bridge the gulf, she falls back
too much on misconceptions and mis-
understandings about refugees.
The climax, when Stefan is wrongfully
suspected of wrecking the new library,
falls flat. When the villains turn out to
be some youngsters who have never
appeared in the book at all, one feels
let down.
Most children would probably prefer
the runner-up, any day. “The Roaring
40” is a real adventure story, also for
from 10 onwards, and even if Nan
Chauncy has already won the prize three
times, 1 would give it to her again. It
has a mystery, a Long John Silver sort
of villain, ?. lost ship and a found boy.
Badge joins his father and big Vik
Viking in prospecting for a mythical
nugget in the wilds of south-west Tas-
mania. They don’t find gold, but they
do find a shipwrecked child who is re-
stored safely to his uncle. It is admit-
tedly slightly improbable, but who cares?
It is the sort; of stuff imaginations expand
and feed on. There are also good illus-
trations by Annette Macarthur-Onslow.

A special acknowledgement is due to
Oxford for their child-proof transparent
covers featured on both these books.
“Threat to the Barkers” is for the 12-
up group and is a basically exciting, if
rather long-winded, account of how two
boys succeed in bringing some sheep
thieves to justice. The prolific Barker
family, who live on the land, won Joan
Phipson the award for the “The Family
Conspiracy” two years ago. There are
drawings by Margaret Horder.
“Fires and Firemen” is a documentary
with plenty of black and white photo-
graphs, warmly dedicated to Australian
Fire Brigades. Children of all ages will
love it.
“Storm-Boy” will appeal to the many
who like animal stories. It is about a
youngster who lives with his father
Hide-away Tom in a humpy on a deso-
late beach in South Australia where his
only friends are an Aborigine, Finger-
bone, and Mr Percival, a pelican he has
rescued. The big bang of this story is
a shipwreck during a fierce storm when
the sailors are saved by Mr Percival’s
skill in flying out a rope to them. The
pelican achieves fame, only to die by
the gun of a vindictive duck-shooter.
(Drawings by John Baily.)
Eight-year-olds will also enjoy meet-
ing Jamie and his dog Fran again in
“Jamie’s Discovery”. The tale of how
Fran is lost and then found in an under-
ground cave covered with ancient Abori-
ginal drawings fizzles out too much to-
wards the end. The illustrations are by
Geraldine Spence.
“One Sunday Morning Early” is that
rare find, a book of verse for children.
Some poems, like “Jets” and “Wonderful
Things”, have a good youthful zest,
others just don't seem to come off. The
illustrations by Noela Young are attrac-
tive in a rather old-fashioned way.
There was no award this year in the
Picture Book section. “Flip the Flying
Possum”, by Noela Young, was “com-
mended.”
Among the Australian books, some of
the best drawings of all are by Elizabeth
Durack. However, not only the unfor-
tunate title but the strangely un-Austra-
lian cover of “The Courteous Savage”
may have excluded it from the award
list. I hope it wasn't the unvarnished
presentation of the white man's inhu-
manities to the Aborigines or the time-
less legendary manner in which it is
told. Yagan was a Swan River tribes-
man who greeted the first settlers with
friendly dignity. But misunderstanding
gradually occurred between whites and
blacks, ending in Yagan’s terrible death.
It should help young readers to a better
understanding of the Aborigines.
Which brings me to some new books
which were not eligible for the awards,
not being by Australians. Otherwise,
most should have won hands down. “The
Cat in the Hat” books are the most
significant invention for beginners since
the alphabet. Children not only learn
to read without tears, they discover
right from the start that reading is fun.
What if parents do find it all baffling!
The kids don't. The words are crazy
and madly repetitive, the rhymes are
nuts and the drawing like nothing that
ever was, except, perhaps, for a vague
resemblance to something strayed out of
a witch’s brew by Goya or Bosch.
Following American Dr Seuss’s earlier
books with a deliberately-limited vocabu-
lary, there now comes his “ABC”. It’s
as sanely insane as its predecessors and
the illustrations from the “Zizzer-Zazzer-
Zuss” (an animal) to the “Tuttle-Tuttle
tree” are just as appropriate.
“Robert the Rose Horse” is another in
this series, but slightly more advanced.
It contains 183 different words. Robert
the farmhorse joins the police and
catches the bank robbers. He is also
cured of sneezing, but not before he has
blown the drawings by P. D. Eastman
all over the pages.
From this, the child could soon gradu-
ate to “Nessie the Mannerless Monster",
aided and abetted by Gerald Rose's
glorious pictures. Tired of being a legend,
Nessie rises to the surface of the loch.
She longs to have the Duke of Edin-
burgh say, “There’s a bonny lassie!” but
is greeted by scientists who cry, “Im-
postor! You are impossible!” After many
adventures with more rhyme than reason,
Nessie is made vice-regent and returns
to her loch, complete with crown.
Finally, the latest addition to the
Pageant of Knowledge series, “The
Living World of History”, is as good as
its name and does present history in a
lively, easily-digested, colorful, capsule
form. Australian children will pounce
on Burke and “Mills”, no doubt a
misprint, but I can't agree with calling
Aborigines “undersized” and “among the
most backward races extant”. This pro-
bably came from one of those old refer-
ence books which came from still older
reference books from the time when we
still shot ’em or poisoned them off like
rabbits.

First, is the rugged real-life adventure of
early Antarctic exploration in Alfred
Lansing's version of Sir Ernest Shackle-
ton's second expedition which has thrilled
generations of boys and girls. As the
years go by the endurance of Shackleton
and his men seems even more amazing.
Stranded on an ice-floe in polar regions,
their ship crushed by moving ice packs,
without benefit of modern equipment—
no quick-drying nylon clothing, no snow-
cats, no aircraft, not even radio (the year
was 1915) —with only three open boats,
sleds and dogs, unwieldy clothing, scant
shelter, and their own amazing courage,
they had either to push on or perish.
Food salvaged from the ship was supple-
mented mainly by seals they hunted, and
seal blubber was used as cooking fuel.
The nearest civilisation, a remote whaling
station, was hundreds of miles to the
north, across endless ice and treacherous
sea. Yet, incredibly, by good judgment,
luck, and above all endurance, they were
able to drift on ice, sail, and finally to

walk to their rescue. Shackleton, a
remote, but self-confident man, stubborn,
tough and at times unpopular, became
a legendary leader in getting all the
party to safety.
From the Antarctic to the Arctic and
an historical story of Iceland just before
Christianity was to turn its Viking popu-
lation from wild, bloodthirsty warriors
into men of peace. Henry Treece, who
has a particular interest in Celtic history
has set the violent saga in the 11th cen-
tury AD. Njal was an older statesman
who had kept his lands and his life by
wisdom and generosity. Whereas most
other landowners would fight and kill
for their rights, Njal relied on mediation
and the justice of the Althing, the court
of law. But for the most part the
civilised legal structure of the community
was ignored and the most insignificant
incidents, often inspired by wicked and
beautiful women, would set off yet
another wave of blood-spilling ven-
geance. There was so much killing that
scarcely a good man was left on Iceland.
About now the first missionary arrived
from Norway and sowed seeds of peace
and reason. The burning of Njal and
his entire family with their homestead
was the culminating act of vengeance
which shamed the population into settled
peace. This is a story for hardy 11-14
year-olds, with a taste for history, and
no thoughts of emulating its heroes’
savagery.
After the violence of “Njal”, “Kati in
America” is a very tame dish. Kati, a
“with it” Swedish girl, visits the USA
with an old-fashioned aunt in button-up
boots. Though her American adventures
are mainly with young men, she does
take time out to observe local customs
with Scandinavian eyes. No use being
a Plain Girl in the States, she decides;
only the pretty ones have any chances.
Luckily, Kati is pretty and quickly finds
a handsome young college man to show
her and auntie the sights. But neither
the young man’s looks nor his prospects
can induce Kati to stay—suddenly dear
Stockholm seems more appealing.
Though our heroine is 22, the book is
juvenile enough for young Australian
teenagers. The pretty water-color illus-
trations are a charming feature.
“Jacob’s Ladder” is a story for girls of,
say, 10-14, but so well-written that any-
one could enjoy it. Set in an old town
on the River Severn in the west of Eng-
land, the story is about two schoolgirls
who love exploring; their most important
discovery is a secret staircase probably
dating back to Reformation times. This
is more than an adventure story. It is
a subtle study of relationship between
friends, dawning awareness of responsi-
bilities, and other moral issues. The
two heroines, their cat McTweeney, the
vicar, and the girls’ parents are all very
real.
Also believable is “Malay Island”, a
warm and touching story of adventures
shared by three boys aged about 11, one
Malay, one Chinese, one English. They
share an island —their very own—not
far off-shore to which they travel by
canoe. Among their treasures here are
a hide-away hut and a pet monkey.
One day they are dismayed to see strange
men landing on their island, and burying
a large box in the sand. Richard, the
English boy, is all for getting to the
bottom of the mystery; Kitchie, the
Malay, is for leaving well alone; Wong
says: “We go away, this no good place
to be now.” But Richard’s insistence
and the loyalty of the other two involve
them all in more adventure than they
had wanted. Clive Dalton has a sym-
pathetic feeling for Malaya and the
various races who live there.

Ane of my boarding-school tasks was
to issue books from the fiction
library several times a week. I well
remember some of the authors and some
of the books which were greatly in de-
mand by girls of fifteen to seventeen at
that time. There were waiting-lists for
Galsworthy, Clemence Dane, Georgette
Heyer, Geoffrey Farnol, a boys’ school-
story called “David Blaise”, an early
war-time biography called “Anthony”,
Baroness Orczy and Zane Grey. From
my parents’ shelves I chiefly remember
reading at that age Kipling, Jane Austen,
William J. Locke, J. B. Priestley, Arnold
Bennett, Susan Ertz, Algernon Black-
wood, Jerome K. Jerome, “The Seven
Pillars of Wisdom” and “The Witch of
Endor”. My father swore by a “new”
writer called Faulkner —1 found him too
difficult.
The three books in review are written
for the age-group I have been discussing.
There is a spate of such books now —I
do not know whether this links up with
the increasing sophistication of the best-
seller; with the teen-age cult, or what-
ever. I don't know if it is a good or a
bad phenomenon. I have written one
book for this market myself. The recipe
seems to be instructional rather than
romantic, but in the sense of Romance-
Love Interest a certain amount of tepid

courtship is allowable. There are affini-
ties, surely with “novels with a moral”
of an earlier time, for the main idea is
that together with entertainment the
young person shall learn something of a
place, its people, historical background,
physical nature, etc. The sheer endear-
ing nonsense of Georgette Heyer's “stap
me” rakes and beaux is “out”, and with
it the biased and/or snobbish gallantry
of Scarlet Pimpernels. True escapism
is out in large capitals. Good taste and
excellent illustrations are usually in.
Parents, librarians and teachers ought
to have few concerns as to the “suita-
bility” of what their young charges are
reading.
Of these three books here, “Time of
Trial” might conceivably fill a fraction
of the gap left by something like Cle-
mence Dane's “Bromme Stages’’. It is
set in London and Suffolk in 1801. The
heroine is the daughter of a socialisti-
cally-minded reforming bookseller. After
many vicissitudes —collapsing tenements,
mob violence, disloyal brother, involve-
ment with smugglers, separation from
the medical student she loves, father
gaoled for sedition —she marries at last
and her brother (who has joined the
army) seems likely to marry a farmer's
charming daughter (emerging rural
middle-class). The book is uneasily
poised between adventure and romance
and is too short to develop its themes
(but long as these books go). It teaches
an amazing amount in its 216 pages.
Dickens took volumes to teach as much
and Clemence Dane . . . ah! Clemence
Dane.
“Ride a Northbound Horse” is more
especially a boy’s book. It is shorter,
narrower in range—just an orphaned
13-year-old boy driving the family ox-
cart away from Alabama, where his
people died of a fever, towards Texas.
He meets rogues and friends and at last
joins a team of cattlemen bound for
Kansas. He earns the respect of Big
Cav and his men and outwits a villain.
In short, he grows up. It is good history,
credible (the boy does manly deeds but
not impossible ones), and is the best of
the three books here; shapely, relevant
and enjoyable.
The worst book is “Save the Khan”—
sequel to “The Cossacks”, which was the
1963 winner of the Older Children Sec-
tion of the “New York Herald Tribune”
Spring Festival Award. “Save the Khan”
is a cruel book which deals with struggles
for Siberia between Tartar princes de-
scended from Genghis Khan and their
wars with the “White Russians”. It, too,
packs huge amounts of information into
a short space and much of the informa-
tion is revolting. No responsible school
librarian would buy a manual on fighting
with flick-knives. Nothing more expen-
sive than some old stockings or rope is
needed for the contest called “skull-
cracking”. The Tartars discouraged
their elite from practising the “sport”
because its protagonists usually ended up
concussed, dead or insane. It was good
enough for the elite to watch. And good
enough as a courtship present was a little
tree on each of whose spiky branches
was impaled (through its blinded eyes)
a living bird—pretty! the whole tree
fluttered. (Admittedly the princess re-
jects her suitor, such gifts being old-
fashioned, and, anyway, she prefers
another.) Admittedly, too, the “hero”,
Daritai, is put out when his father
punishes a seditious general by pouring
boiling pitch over him—it was supposed
to be a mock-battle. But the point is
that “goodies” and “baddies” are alike
part of this cruel, long-past society, and
although they get their deserts it is within
the framework of the revolting culture in
which they live.
This alleged children’s book is one of
the very few volumes of any sort which
has ever come into my house which I
would withhold from my own children.

leopards, horses that talk,
sophisticated 12-year-old twins and
a great religious leader are only some of
the characters that will delight readers
—eight to 14 bracket —in the following
books.
Foremost, because of its unusual back-
ground, fine camera work and splendid
presentation, is “Cranky”. Told briefly,
giving a clear picture of little-known
Central Australia, it is chock-a-block
with photographic plates of Jeff, his
aboriginal pal Bill, and Cranky, who is
not really cranky, but just a baby camel
homesick for his mother. If the book has
a fault it is that it is too abbreviated.
One feels it should be enlarged and that
it could become an Australian classic. It
contains fine material for television and
overseas markets.
From overseas come “The Israeli
Twins” —another of the famous “Twins
Series” —and Gillian Tindall apparently
knows the land she writes of intimately,
as she presents, through Rachael and
Aaron, a vivid picture of life as it is
being lived in modern Israel, not for-
getting its ancient past.
For those who revel in fantasy and
the fantastic, Muriel Hooper has animals
and inanimate objects conversing
believably—with humans in her “The
Company at the Mill”, an amusing but,
at times, quite serious book suitable for
the imaginative, and on second thoughts
perhaps even more for the unimaginative,
child.
Fantasy again in Meta Mayne
Reid’s “With Angus In The Forrest”. An
exciting adventure story with an Irish
background in which a girl of the present
moves back into past ages to unravel a
mystery. With remarkable ease the
author slips across the factual and into
the land of magic, where a trefoil tree
blooms and where the mysterious Angus
talks in riddles about a Forrest and a
girl in blue. This is an intriguing book
beautifully written and with a special
brand of Irish subtlety.

A TEST OF RELIABILITY
lt/fR Harry Firth, after his 7000-
mile winning drive in the recent
motor reliability trial over “the
roughest roads in four States”,
summed up his experience as being
“just like driving to work”.
One wonders what he would have
made of the first Australian road to
run outside the County of Cumber-
land which William Cox began to
build just 150 years ago in July,
1814.
Lawson, Blaxland and Wentworth
had crossed the coastal range of the
Blue Mountains a year before.
Governor Macquarie, at the end of
1813, sent G. W. Evans, Deputy
Surveyor, to confirm their reports.
He had extended their exploration by
nearly 100 miles westward and, round
Christmastide, .he had discovered the
Bathurst Plains and the Macquarie
River.
At the end of April, 1814, Gov-
ernor Macquarie wrote to Lord
Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary,
that he intended to mark Evans’
route by a road; and when this road
should be “completed to admit of a
provision cart passing over it”* to
traverse it himself, taking with him
Oxley, the Surveyor - General, and
“two or three intelligent persons” to
help him assess Evans’ first “hurried
report”.
This lighthearted promise he did
not find easy to carry out for want
of competent men with requisite
courage, but eventually Cox, magis-
trate, builder, dictator and magnate
of the Hawkesbury, who was famous
and popular with the convictry for
his humanity as an employer, volun-
teered for the daunting assignment
and, luckily for historians, kept a
diary of his operations.
Cox was not the man to waste
time. On July 7 he said goodbye to
the Governor in Sydney. Four days
later he was out at Windsor “con-
verting a cart into a caravan to sleep
in as well as to take my personal
luggage, which was completed on the
16th”. On July 17 he left his home
at Clarendon, and by July 23 had
cut the approaches to the ford in the
steep banks of the Nepean near
where the railway line now crosses,
and had brought his men and equip-
ment across the river facing the bleak
foothills of the awesome, winter-
swept and nameless ranges through
which he was to carve a 20-foot-wide
road, cleared and stumped, with
gullies bridged, “so that a four-
wheeled carriage or cart may pass
over it without difficulty”, and
equipped with depots for food and
water along the way.
He must have looked with some
misgivings at his array of men and
equipment for this task: Captain
Hobby, his old friend of the New
South Wales Corps, Richard Lewis,
his superintendent whose name is on
Lewis’ Ponds; in all “thirty well
inclined handy men who had been in
the colony some years and accus-
tomed to field work” and who had the
prospect of freedom ahead if they did
not die on the way.
They climbed, cutting and grub-
bing, rolling over rocks, bridging
deep ravines, beset by sickness,
plagued by tools that turned on the
edge. The weather was cold and
bleak. They had to survey their
track and plot their course as they
went. But by September 3, the
tunnel through the trees had opened
behind them to admit passage of their
carts as far as the heap of stones
which next year Macquarie called
Caley’s Repulse.
By October 3 they had reached
Wentworth Falls and built the first
building in the Blue Mountains
proper—the famous “Weatherboard”
of later years —a shelter 17ft x 12ft,
“gable ended, all weatherboards, with
a door at the east end”.
Then remained the inland range
to be crossed, the swollen Cox River
(named in his honor) and the wide
Fish River to be bridged, and on
January 21, the 101 \ miles of high-
way from the Nepean Ford was
finished well enough to allow the
Governor with his wife and ten
historic followers to travel to the
West and back by horse, cart and
carriage from the Nepean in seven
days actual travelling each way with
one day’s rest on the river near the
foot of Mt York which the Governor
christened the Cox, to hold the first
divine service west of the coastal
range on April 30. Thus was accom-
plished the first “reliability trial” on
an inland Australian road.
On May 7, Macquarie raised the
British flag on the river called after
him and gave the name of Bathurst
to the first township founded in the
West, watched by possum-cloaked
Aborigines.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Forced Into Awareness
Onset of the new financial year last week presented inves-
tors with the usual share of knotty problems as they
attempted to assess investment policy for the year ahead.
A major problem is whether the buoyancy of last year will
carry through to the end of 1964-65 without financial curbs,
setbacks to export income, cost-wage inflation and outside
political influences.
One of the modern factors to contend with is the forecast
of a “long drawn out struggle with Indonesia” intoned by
Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman as background music to
the recent revival of that well-known play “Brinkmanship”,
with Lyndon B. Johnson (a former understudy) as a new male
lead.
Even if some people are unhappy that the French, still with
a big stake in Indo-China, should point it out so bluntly, there
is a growing recognition that settlement in areas like Vietnam,
Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia will have to be settled by
negotiation with the Asians having some say in the matter.
The Western powers seem to be realising they cannot tell
everyone what they want and expect all parties to behave like
good little boys, or else. The sensible attitude, naturally, is
that these problems will be settled with the least consequences.
Unfortunately, the businessmen in Britain, US and Aus-
tralia often are too preoccupied to understand the proper signi-
ficance of the restless, expanding populations in Asia. Old
remedies are not necessarily the best, and predictions of future
events inevitably must be hazardous and sketchy. So, how
does all this fit into business planning and investment pro-
grammes?
The attitude of most people
is to let someone else take care
of it and go on operating as if
the problem does not exist. This
is regarded as the sane thing
to do, as a necessary avoidance
of ulcers or a complete mental
breakdown.
While this may be logical to
those who remain untouched,
for the time being, by the prob-
lems in Asia, the businessman
who is contacting these people
and seeking to promote trade
relations could quite easily assist
also in promoting understanding
as well as minimising ignorant
misconceptions.
This does not suggest that
salesmen should try to sell tran-
quillisers on Vietnam battle-
fields. It does recognise that, in
the midst of all the South-East
Asian disturbances, salesmen
from the US, Germany, France,
Japan and Britain are actively
pushing their wares, regardless
of political shades.
Commonwealth Payments to the States
The Loan Council held its meetings in Canberra last week.
The graph above shows Commonwealth Government alloca-
tions to the States from 1959-60 to 1963-64 ( estimated ).
Each State’s total is made up of direct financial assistance
(including works and housing) and tax reimbursements. The
total for 1964-65 will be about £783m. Loan Council policies
are discussed in “Economics Anonymous” on page 55.
If Australia disregards Asian affairs in its political and
business planning, it may well rue the day; because her in-
come now is tied up very heavily with trade with Japan,
wheat sales to China and an expanding market in other Asian
areas.
Planning in 1964-65, therefore, should involve more than
a casual look to the north.
Tied Loans Defended
and Attacked
just concluded United Nations Trade and Development
A Conference made it quite clear that most developing
countries heartily dislike getting their economic aid by way
of tied loans. They hate any semblance of control from donor
nations.
These objections, of course, can scarcely be expected to
halt the tying process in its internationally-employed tracks.
Often a lending country is not to be blamed for wishing to
bind a recipient only to purchase particular goods and services
from itself.
The virtues, or otherwise, of the system are again being
vigorously discussed by Australian businessmen as more trading
opportunities disclose themselves throughout Asia.
Local debate was touched off by Mr W. J. Austen in his
chairman’s address to the Metal Trades Export Group. He
had especially in mind trade with India and Indonesia.
Mr Austen pressed for Government reconsideration of a
policy which so far has refrained from using tied loans any-
where. “The offer of tied loans
to certain hard-pressed countries
would not only create goodwill
on their part but would gain ex-
port trade for Australia which
we have no hope whatever of
getting under present condi-
tions,” he argued.
Loss of business does not fol-
low because Australian products
“are not wanted, in some cases
desperately, but they cannot be
paid for in hard cash for the
present.”
The alleged merit of goodwill
was quickly denied by the
Associated Chambers of Com-
merce of Australia in their June
15 issue of “Canberra Com-
ments”. “While it is true that
this type of loan could be useful
in opening up new markets it
could not fail to be construed
as a commercial device for
export promotion and this
would be obvious to the receiv-
ing country,” runs the news-
letter’s argument.


A telling point is the addition: “Moreover, if all donor
countries were actively to pursue this policy it would not be
long before Australia would feel the effect of such action . . .
Australia and other smaller donor nations would soon find
that trade which they had previously enjoyed with the less
developed countries would be re-directed to the financially
stronger donor nations. It would be unlikely that Australia
could match the loans that, say, the United States, West
Germany or Japan could make available.”
A sounder basis for market penetration, the Chambers
of Commerce suggest, is provided by private investment in
the form of join ventures, which also possess the advantage
of by-passing import restrictions.
The prime case against tying loans may well be that “from
the borrowing countries’ point of view, purchases made under
tied loans can be expensive since the recipient is denied the
right of buying from the cheapest source.”
The issues must be quickly faced in Australia and a keen
sense of the appropriate method for any particular aid-
receiving country developed. Competition will be very keen
over the growing Asian market. Aid and ordinary commercial
transactions need to be directed at the standard of living,
not at increasing the burden of debt and financial dependence.
CRA Endows Japanese
Scholarships
HThe Bulletin has often emphasised the necessity for more
-*■ Australians, including businessmen, to obtain a knowledge
of Asian languages. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia is now
taking practical steps to facilitate this.
The company has already urged the Prime Minister and
State Premiers to extend opportunities for studying Japanese
in the schools. On discovering that the University of Mel-
bourne will include Japanese in Arts courses as from 1965,
CRA has decided to endow a series of scholarships.
Three will be awarded on matriculation results, one on first-
year results and one scholarship becomes available each year
for four months’ post-graduate study in Japan. Other Aus-
tralian companies could well follow such a lead.
Tighter Control
on Takeovers?
"VTow that it has been revealed by Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Mr Reginald Maudling, that Rootes, UK,
was required to give a specific undertaking to limit Chrysler’s
shareholding after the 30 p.c. takeover offer, there will be
more pressure for official restraint on overseas takeovers of
Australian companies. The New Zealand Government already
has announced it is considering the introduction of legislation
to require government consent for takeovers.
The subject has been a touchy one for Australian Treasurer,
Mr Harold Holt, and he obviously will want to tread warily
now that he is so close to Prime Ministership. Official policy
has always been to encourage overseas interests by “gentle
persuasion” to permit Australian capital to participate in local
projects, preferably up to 50 per cent.
The policy has worked reasonably well, and the Treasury
has always indicated that reasonable consideration would be
given to remittance of profits to overseas holders. But the
power still remains with Exchange Control to restrict such
remittances, particularly if the country's overseas reserves are
in a bad way^
If the gentle persuasion technique has worked in assisting
overseas companies in the development of Australia, it is not
always to the credit of Australians. Overseas interests had
the foresight (and the money) to take the long-term view in
investing in this country. It has been said before, and bears
saying again, that there is not always sufficient encouragement
in Australia for local interests to start a new project. Over-
seas groups have no difficulty in raising funds from the local
institutions, or by way of debenture issues, because it appa.
rently is accepted that they have greater know-how, more
experience, etc.
There are obvious immediate advantages to the locals,
through increased employment, establishment of a local in-
dustry, and a saving on imports. But the fruits of such invest-
ment, projected into the long-term, requires the remittance of
possibly ever-increasing dividends which must be matched by
export earnings.
How’s Your Credit
Rating, Mac?
apparently penetrates barriers other than tariffs,
Wheat to Red China is OK because of credit status, but
foodstuffs to allies in Singapore is no good if credit rating is
poor. Britain sells buses to Cuba on a high credit rating,
backed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (equiva-
lent of our EPIC). But vehicle chasses to Indonesia are not
so popular.
Vehicles in Indonesia, of course, may end up carrying troops
to the battle in Borneo, but Leyland buses might carry only
tourists to fighting areas.
lan Potter To Open
Perth Branch
HPhis paper has made frequent reference to the rapid expan-
sion that is going on in Western Australia. On August 3,
further evidence of this growth will establish itself—lan Potter
and Co., giant Melbourne stockbroking firm, will open a
branch office in Perth.
This is surely a sign of the State's growing financial status
and a good omen for its continuance. True, two other Mel-
bourne broking firms, A. C. Goode and J. B. Were, already
have offices there, but the famous “Potter" stamp must surely
be the final seal of approval. (Were's office has been estab-
lished since January, 1955, and Goode’s opened last May.)
The tentacles of Melbourne's brokers are slowly but surely
spreading. Those with the biggest spread are the three already
mentioned. All have branches already in Sydney, Brisbane
and Adelaide. Goode and Were have correspondents in
London, while Potter runs an office in Canberra.
Of the 60-odd firms on the Melbourne Stock Exchange,
only two or three others have interstate branches. About
another three run offices in centres like Geelong. Dandenong
and Wangaratta. The rest operate mainly in Melbourne’s
financial hub —Collins and Little Collins Streets.
Stanford Survey Published
In Book Form
Stanford Research Institute’s report, “The Development
of Australia”, was examined by The Bulletin in a series
of four articles under “Economics Anonymous” between
January 11 and February 1 this year. Many readers at that
time inquired if it was possible to obtain the complete report.
They will now be pleased to know that it has been published
as a book, without any abridgement or alteration, by Ure
Smith of Sydney and is available in bookshops at 395. 6d.
The original report, commissioned by the Australian Develop-
ment Research Association, was largely circulated privately,
although some copies were made available at £3.

Loan Council’s Big Question
State Governments holding out itchy palms
Seldom in Loan Council history has
the economic background been better
or the national till so full as it is for the
July meetings this year. In these cir-
cumstances not even a Federal Treasurer
anxious to preserve this pleasing state of
affairs by restraining the itchy palms of
the States could have expected them to
be satisfied with much less than their
full demands for public works money.
Yet, if the Premiers had read the
Federal Government’s survey of the Aus-
tralian economy, they will have known
well enough without further lecture from
Mr Holt that by settling for a little less
than their full demands they might in
consequence be better off before the end
of the year than if their public works
spending were simply to match the avail-
ability of money. The simple question
they had to ask themselves was whether
the total hand-out for capital spending in
the public sector would put a strain on
resources likely to upset price stability.
The economic survey itself underlined
just how delicate a question this is at this
juncture, and how the preservation of
price stability is pretty much in the lap
oFthe gods, resting more on the way
people are likely to behave than on
official confidence in sufficient contain-
ment of income generation.
The survey's main hope is that the
present cautious attitudes of investors
and consumers will persist and so con-
tinue to ease the strains imposed by
over-flowing investment funds and in-
comes on resources and prices. Comfort
is taken in its view that at present there
is “not much” to suggest any “marked”
change in these attitudes and also in the
“precautionary” steps taken thus far (the
calls to special deposits and the slight
leverage on interest rates) to ward off
the inflationary possibilities.
“If, however, demand were to run to
extremes and costs and prices started to
climb,” the survey goes on, “the present
high liquidity could easily become a
source of renewed inflation. The large
volume of deposits in both trading and
savings banks could be drawn on heavily
to finance greater spending or increase
lending outside the banking system. With
this there could be substantially increased
use of bank overdraft limits. The recent
cautious attitude of the Australian public
towards borrowing and lending might
then give way to the pursuit of capital
gains and quick returns with a rising
volume of funds going into the less
secure forms of investment.” That is
plain enough.
The survey gives the right reasons why
demand and investment could run to
extremes. These are well enough known
to readers of The Bulletin. But as
well as hoping for the best view on the
propensities to save and spend, perhaps
the survey places a little too much reli-
ance on offsetting factors, such as that
farm incomes “may” not increase next
year. Also on some of the suggested
safety values —“a part of any rise in
earnings is, of course, taken in taxation,
a part goes in the repayment of debt,
and a further part might be saved”.
On other safety valves it is more realis-
tic. For instance, “competition is
active”. Equally, on the supply side,
the high level of overseas reserves will,
as the survey suggests, enable us to
supplement resources with higher imports
without danger to the balance of pay-
ments “for the time being”. (A good
qualification considering how quickly a
record level of reserves was eroded in
1951 and forced the Government to im-
pose import restrictions in March, 1952.)
Again, there should be no difficulty
with plant capacity—“so far there has
been little to suggest that equipment or
materials for production are short any-
where”, but “considerable additions will
have to be made”. These are proceeding.
It will be a question of whether labor is
there to use them.
No bones are made about the labor
shortages. Taking everything in, “it does
not seem that much additional labor can
be expected to come from the existing
work force (even from overtime, which is
already high) and attention therefore
turns to the prospects for getting more
new labor”.
In relation to the jobs likely to be
offering, the survey doesn’t find the pros-
pects all that hopeful. This is the most
intractable element in the whole econo-
mic position.
Thus “it appears at this stage that
labor conditions are going to be tight and
that competition for some classes of
labor could be strenuous”, says the sur-
vey, which then goes on to depict the
likely consequential “over-familiar” sort
of dis-economies and their contribution
to inflationary pressures and the growth
rate alike.
Its picture of these is rather frighten-
ing and because the labor situation is
seen as so intractable, the general con-
clusions of the survey could prove to be
over-optimistic.
While it may be that the vital require-
ment is “to keep demand growing but
without running to excess and to foster
a determination by all to keep price and
cost increases in every shape and form
down to a minimum”, it is easier for the
authorities to say this than realistically
to expect the business community to do
other than follow its noses.
T>ast experience shows that if it is
A sniffing inflation, the business world
in particular and the community in
general will start discounting inflation by
making the necessary dispositions.
So one wonders whether the Govern-
ment has erred not only in projecting
this “hope-for-the-best” view but also
in painting the threat of inflation in such
plain terms. It might have been prefer-
able to give some clues to possible future
anti-inflationary action on its own part,
such as cutting back Government expen-
diture or even “mopping up” excess de-
mand through higher taxation. This
would have resolved at least some doubts
about the possible extent of price in-
creases.
Instead the Government admits it is
caught in the vortex of higher spending
commitments with little relief in sight.
Thus it says, “defence expenditure has
been lifted and in all branches of public
authority spending commitments are
undertaken which inevitably grow,
largely because the community and its
need for services are growing. Some
slowing down of the increase may (only
may) be possible. The total, neverthe-
less, is certain to rise considerably”.
That is the most disturbing factor in
the whole equation and it is up to
Governments, both Federal and State,
to try to do more about it.


“CROESUS”
More Sophistication in Money Markets
Is a commercial bill market coming?
VTeither Rome nor the London dis-
count market were built in a day,
nor without misadventure. But this
thought has not inhibited discussion in
local money markets of the feasibility
of building a market in fine commercial
bills into the sophisticated process of
Australia’s finance machinery, and now
both the Reserve Bank and the Treasury
are to have a hard look at the possi-
bilities.
Promoters of the idea don’t seem to
be very concerned that “fine” commer-
cial bills have never been part of the
local scene and that the nearest we have
got to them are bills on trading banks
for the finance of our overseas trade.
Although it took an age for London
to perfect the “fine” commercial bill
developed largely on foreign trade bills,
in the context of its position as the
world's leading international money
centre, apparently it is thought we can
institute “fine” bills here overnight to-
gether with an apparatus of acceptance
houses and get going right away—pro-
viding the Reserve Bank gives the nod
that it will act as lender of last resort
as it does in the case of the short-term
money market.
Dealers in the official short - term
money market would be only too pleased
if the Reserve Bank gave them the nod
to add commercial paper to their port-
folios, always, of course, with the same
lender of last resort backing from the
bank. Indeed, this would be the logical
way of developing such a market here.
London discount market is a good
■*" precedent for giving them the dual
role, and in any case they are the only
people with the necessary expertise in
this country, albeit their experience thus
far has been largely in short-term bonds
and, more recently, Treasury notes.
Moreover if a separate market were
to be developed in commercial paper, it
is more than likely that these same people
would be in it from the beginning in
other guises.
In some respects their interest in
creating a commercial bill market coin-
cides with that of the monetary authori-
ties and the trading banks. This is
mainly because one would expect such
a market to cut into the volume of
business done in the inter-company
borrowing market, which now canalises
perhaps up to £2OO million (estimates
vary from £lOO million up to this figure)
of commercial lending business avenues,
not only out of their sight but also out
of the sight of the authorities and the
trading banks, on whose overdraft limits
it is to some extent backed.
Doubtless many companies who now
borrow and lend between themselves for
short terms would, given the existence
of commercial bill market facilities,
prefer to use bills in preference to deal-
ing direct with other companies, especi-
ally as it would minimise risks and pro-
bably, for borrowers, have the advantage
of reducing interest charges.
One of the intriguing features of the
financial scene since the ceilings of the
official short-term money market were
lifted in February, at the persistent re-
quest of the market, is that the volume
of funds held by the market has never
looked like rising to it. It can, perhaps,
be inferred from this (coupled with the
success of the experiment in allowing
the trading banks to take 90-day fixed
deposits) that there are stricter limits
than perhaps the market imagined to its
own attractiveness as a temporary home
for idle money, especially of industrial
concerns.
Though one cannot be too certain, it
looks as if much of this idle money would
continue to by-pass the official short-term
money market while it can hold only
Government paper.
Thus if the short-term money market
is to expand its business much further,
one essential condition could well be
that it be allowed to hold commercial
paper. Indeed, as the flush of liquidity
in the system ebbs, as it seems bound to
do, one would expect a sizeable contrac-
tion in the volume of money housed by
the market failing the extension of its
business to commercial bills.
This also has implications for the
monetary authorities for whom the
development of the official short-term
money market has provided a much
needed stiffener for the bond market, as
well as giving it a further, even if
strictly limited, running guide both to
idle money flows and short-term interest
rates.
For one thing, it shows that the limits
of stiffening the bond market through
this medium may well have been reached.
Again, it shows that to get a fuller pic-
ture of idle money flows and their true
impact on short-term rates, means must
be found to bring their dispositions out
in the open.
It may be that the inter-companv mar-1
ket would continue to thrive alongside!
a bill market and so deny the authorities!
a sight of many dispositions of such
money, but the experiment of offering
a commercial bill market alternative!
might be well worth their while trying. ,
The real question may well be whether
we have the right setting for the creation
of such a market. Certainly the exis-
tence of a well-established official short-
term money market is a very useful basis
on which to build a bill market.
JJowever, it must be recognised that
the introduction and establishment
of fine commercial bills would pose
many problems, not least of these being
that they would be entirely novel. The
development of commercial bill markets
in other countries, especially Britain, has
been a very slow process in circum-
stances very different from ours.
For instance, the London discount
market, which now plays such an impor-
tant role as a thermometer of the short-
term interest rate temperature in London,
largely developed on the basis of foreign
trade bills arising inter alia from the
finance of a large part of world trade in
sterling—that is, by bills drawn on Lon-
don.
International trade bills played a very
minor, almost negligible, role until recent
years. But now the market's main stock-
in-trade is largely Treasury bills.
The short-term money market in
London is a dual one, handling both
Treasury bills and “fine” commercial
bills; that most of the commercial bills
are foreign trade bills; and that internal
trade bills play a minor role. (They
have never been a significant feature of
British commercial life.)
In contrast, as matters stand at the
moment in Australia the short-term
money market is only officially allowed
to hold Government paper. We are not
an international money centre financing
trade between foreign countries, so there
is no supply of foreign trade bills to
furnish a market. So far as our own
overseas trade is financed by local bills
it is done by the trading banks. If a
commercial bill market were to be estab-
lished here on the basis of internal “fine”
trade bills, we would have to introduce
this type of bill backed by acceptance
houses of the necessary standing to make
them acceptable to an official market.

THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA
Australian Meat for the World
Our largest dollar earner looks to the East
Meat, which ranks third on our list
of exports, is the most important
dollar earner. The recently concluded
meat agreement between Australia and
the US, which limits the amount we can
supply, has not affected exporters who
have found alternative markets in
Europe. They say the industry’s future
is buoyant in view of increasing meat
consumption throughout the world.
Australia, an important figure as a
meat exporter, has a bright future despite
the American limitation. The industry
is producing at near record levels and
exporting more than ever before.
The largest importer of our meat is
still the US, which, for the first ten
months of this financial year, had taken
167,624 tons of beef and veal and 15,224
tons of mutton and lamb.
The UK is the next largest importer,
and for the same period it had taken
19,648 tons of beef and veal and 15,940
tons of mutton and lamb.
Japan, a promising future market, is
third with imp rts of 3872 tons of
Australian beef and veal and 14,810 tons
of mutton and lamb.
The American meat agreement limits
imports of Australian meat to 242,000
tons in calendar year 1964, 251,000
tons in 1965 and 260,000 tons in 1966.
In each succeeding year there will be an
increase corresponding to the estimated
rate of increase in the US meat market
—at present about 3.7 p.c. a year.
These conditions will be reviewed
every three years, the first review taking
place no later than October 1, 1966.
The American Senate Finance Com-
mittee’s approval of a bill to impose
rigid import quotas on meat which could
force the US Government to cancel the
voluntary agreement with Australia is
unlikely to be enacted. US Government
officials say it would be harmful to
America’s trade relations and President
Johnson is believed likely to veto any
meat import legislation.
Apart from a lapse in 1960-61, Aus-
tralia’s livestock slaughter figure has been
steadily rising since 1959-60 when 4.96
million cattle and calves and 33.17 mil-
lion sheep and lambs were consigned to
the world’s tables. In 1962-63 5.88 mil-
lion cattle and calves and 33.99 million
sheep and lambs were killed.
With the increased killings has come
increased actual meat production. Car-
case weight of beef and veal, which stood
at 751,580 tons in 1959-60, rose to
904,380 tons by 1962-63. On present
levels of production it looks as though
this figure will be exceeded in the 1963-
64 financial year.
Weight of mutton and lamb has risen
steadily although not as markedly as
beef and veal. In 1959-60 573,333
tons were produced; in 1962-63 the
figure was 594,002 tons.
Total meat production in Australia has
risen from 1,425,707 tons in 1959-60 to
1,614,006 tons in 1962-63. Current out-
puts indicate 1963-64’s figure will exceed
that of the previous year.
Exports, too, present a brighter picture
today than they did five years ago. The
table below gives exports of fresh and
frozen meat in tons.
Year Beef Veal Mutton Lamb
1959- 183,850 3048 32,037 26,460
1960- 132,003 2012 37,087 28,778
1961- 198,567 2605 48,711 16,696
1962- 257,368 3404 61,045 25,274
1963- 203,906 2971 49,383 17,036
(9 months)
The American meat quota which limits
imports of Australian meat to 94 p.c. of
the average for 1962 and 1963 calendar
years has not affected exporters’ sales
figures. One exporter said: “Normally
the American market would have taken
care of our exportable surplus, but this
year it has gone to the UK where
attractive prices have warranted large
consignments.
Although European countries are not
at present a major market for Austra-
lian meat, exporters feel they could grow.
A Greek trade mission to Australia, for
instance, said in May that we should look
for an increased mutton market in
Greece.
The possibility of America entering
the European meat market, say exporters,
is doubtful unless the US Government,
directly or indirectly (by means of a
promotion campaign) subsidises the
move. US Secretary of Agriculture,
Orville Freeman, however, says Ameri-
can beef can now undercut European
prices by 4Jd. to BJd. per lb and
American shipments could reach 200,000
tons a year.
Australian exporters, on the other
hand, say America will have difficulty
selling in Europe, where our beef and
that from the Argentine is readily
accepted while American beef is not in
heavy demand.
They see great potential in Japan as a
major market for Australian meat. With
its present high prosperity level Japan
is consuming larger quantities of meat
and Australia can expect to contribute
a larger share.
“In five or ten years it could become
as important to us as America. Of
course, we will have to contend with
New Zealand, at present our main com-
petitor in the East, but I think we will
be able to command a substantial share
of the market,” said an exporter.

Higher Taxes?
Mr Holt has tricky task to avoid them
T>rospects for tax increases in the next
Federal Budget were given a nudge
last week when the Treasurer, Mr Holt,
indicated a £som. increase in Common-
wealth spending commitments to the
States for 1964-65.
Coming on top of higher defence
commitments, the Treasurer will have to
perform some pretty tricky juggling to
avoid any tax increases, despite buoyant
tax receipts reported for the year just
ended.
Mr Holt would be happy to be a
benevolent Treasurer at this stage of his
career, but increased Government expen-
diture and other commitments must set
the policy. If there were scope for tax
concessions, Treasury fears of inflation
would be a deterrent,
★ ★ ★
Oetailers won’t be happy about sug-
gestions of sales tax increases, but
higher public spending capacity (inclu-
ding the £1 Federal basic wage increase)
could help to offset this.
Mark Foy’s, the Sydney and subur-
ban retailer, continues to compress its
city activities and gain income by letting
some of its city space.
The city furniture store has been con-
verted to offices which are rented to
business people, and the car park has
been let to a vehicle distributor while,
at the main Liverpool Street store, the
top two floors are being let.
It is interesting to conjecture if other
city retailers will follow this rental trend
and concentrate on their suburban
stores, where car parking facilities are
swaying public custom.
Mark Foy’s, after a very difficult
period of reorganisation, could become
an interesting retail investment again,
but the benefits of the reorganisation
have yet to be translated into figures.
For someone who wants to take a
punt on the company’s success, the ss.
shares, if obtainable around 75., could
represent a likely “spec”. But patience
is required.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Debenture Holders’ Sorry Plight
Reid Murray “Series Three ” vitally different
rpHOSE people holding the “Series Three”
debentures of Reid Murray Accep-
tance are in a sorry state. Their issue
was the only one of nine which was not
guaranteed by the parent company, Reid
Murray Holdings. As a result, they may
not be entitled to rank equally with the
others as regards the return of their un-
fortunate money.
This situation was revealed in Mel-
bourne last week by the joint Receivers,
Mr C. J. Waugh and Mr E. H. Niemann.
The case will be taken before the
Supreme Court, which must determine
whether “Series Three” security ranks
equally or after that of the other deben-
ture issues.
If it does, then they stand on current
estimates to receive £55 for every £lOO
that was originally invested. If not, this
figure recedes to a paltry £3.
Of course, if the Court decides against
them, then the £52 difference on each
debenture will be distributed among the
holders of the other eight issues. These
people are at present owed £25,378,309
and the “Series Three” holders
£3,743,250, both plus interest.
Why is it that this one issue was not
backed by a guarantee from the parent
company? The answer lies in the fact
that to have done this the parent would
have been compelled by law to publish
an up-to-date set of accounts in the
prospectus. This was issued on October
1, 1959. The parent balanced on August
31, so the accounts were far from ready
at the time of printing. The issue was
made, therefore, without the guarantee
that was carried by the eight others.
Unfortunately, the prospectus did not
emphasise to the “average person” that
there was no guarantee, as in the case
of the first two issues. Unless those in-
terested were prepared to plough through
the small-print legal jargon of the statu-
tory information at the back, they were
stepping in unawares.
Admittedly, the document did not say
that Reid Murray Holdings was guaran-
teeing, as the others did in bold print,
but this hardly amounted to actually
pointing out the vitally different terms
under which the issue was to be made.
Even if the difference had been pointed
out, the issue would probably have been
fully subscribed anyway. At the time,
the Australian economy was buoyant,
Reid Murray was trading profitably and
actually went on to announce a profit
record of £1.4 million for the year to
August 31, 1960.
Holding Their Fire
TVlaybe the irate group of Southern
Motors shareholders who walked
out of the annual meeting in July last
year will have their demands met in the
near future. Their walk-out was in pro-
test after the chairman, Mr R. G. Wil-
liams, would not accept a motion put
by Mr J. B. Sparks, as it was consider-
ed “completely out of order”.
The main demand of the motion was
that the board honor its undertaking,
given in 1960, to make a bonus issue.
In June that year the directors did say
that a bonus was “under consideration”
but, as things turned out, the Govern-
ment’s economic measures, announced
later in the year, necessitated that the
board defer such consideration for
awhile.
And their decision was a wise one.
In the year to April 30, 1961, the first
effects of the squeeze reduced the earn-
ing rate from 59.7 p.c. to 54.8 p.c. But
the full effect came in 1961-62 when the
figure crashed to 21.4 p.c. Last year a
recovery was made to 40.3 p.c. The
results for the year to April 30, 1964,
were announced recently and the pros-
pects of a bonus issue are now consider-
ably enhanced.
On capital increased by a one-for-three
par issue during the year, earnings rose
from 40.3 to 43.2 p.c. Dividend will
again be 17i p.c. Taking last year’s
balance sheet as a guide, this means that
paid capital at April 30 last of £306,000
will now be heavily outweighed by re-
serves in the vicinity of £650,000.
So the opportunity for making a bonus

l's there again with prosperity running
high at present. However, as there is
a lot of talk going around Melbourne
on the possibility of Government mea-
sures being taken against the booming
motor industry, directors are undoubted-
ly holding their fire at present. As one
of the city’s leading Holden distributors,
an increase in sales tax could again have
devastating effects on profitability.
Another Bite by Geo. Weston
Although the chairman of George
Weston Foods Ltd told shareholders
in his recent annual address that the
takeover of W. Thomas and Co. (WA)
Ltd virtually completed the company’s
pattern of operation for the milling and
baking industries, within days another
acquisition was announced.
This was of Poultry Farmers Co-op
Society Ltd, operating the Red Comb
Flour Mill in Brisbane. Red Comb is
the major flour exporter in Queensland.
Perhaps Tasmania is not very strongly
represented in the Weston scheme of
things, but otherwise its coverage of
Australasia looks pretty complete.
The chairman (Mr A. G. Parker)
tilted at the Press in saying that “contrary
to certain Press references arising from
the recent takeover battle in the industry
in Melbourne, our biscuit interest in Bris-
bane, Melbourne and Sydney continues,
as in previous years, to increase its share
of the market reflected in increased pro-
fits.”
George Weston feels it prudent to
allow time for consolidation and inte-
gration of fine various new interests be-
fore seeking listing on Australian Ex-
changes, shareholders were informed.
Nearly 20 p.c. of issued capital is already
held by institutions and residents of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand.
The mills have been working to capa-
city, but the milling industry faces prob-
lems in the export market now that the
Russian order is fulfilled and the UK has
restricted imports to 55,000 tons this year.
Group turnover was £23.5 million in
the year to December 31, 1963.
Q’ltl Can Diversifies
T>esults in the first three-quarters of
the current year to June 30 have
convinced directors of Queensland Can
Co. Ltd that it would have another
record trading year.
Diversification has been achieved by
the highly - successful production at
Rocklea of four and five gallon tin-
plate drums and pails, and the manu-
facture under licence from New Zea-
land of stainless steel mufflers, which will
fit nearly every make of car.
The ss. shares with tangible assets of
9s. 3d. at last date of reckoning sell f or
around 13s. 9d. where the yield from
10 p.c. dividend is 3.6 p.c.
They are listed only j B
Brisbane and Melbourne.
Dividends From the Gully
VI/’ith the gradual decline of profits
from Victorian gold-mining activi-
ties and the yearly drop in the number
of the State’s producing mines, last
week’s announcement from Wattle Gully
provided a ray of hope for this once-
booming industry. The company is to
pay a dividend of Is. a share after a
three-year absence of dividends.
The last payout was Is. in 1960. Back
in 1950 it was as high as ss. 6d. This
figure declined to nil in 1954, then re-
covered gradually to 4s. 6d. in 1959
before being omitted again in 1961, 1962
and 1963.
But the most significant point about
the dividend resumption is that profits
are being earned again. Loses of £926
and £31,497 were made in 1962 and
1963 respectively from operations at the
mine at Chewton, near Castlemaine
(Vic.).
More Records for Gibson K.
Kelite's latest acquisition
should lift profit to a record in
1964-65. The Melbourne-based chemi-
cal manufacturer and hot-water engineer
has bought an 80 p.c. interest in Com-
mando Products of Adelaide.
Commando manufactures various
types of water-treating equipment. It is
a leader in its field in SA and distributes
to other States and New Zealand.
Gibson K’s announcement implied
that the move would improve earning
rates. This should not be hard, as the
deal was financed by surplus cash and
did not involve any share issue.
Gibson’s result in 1963 was a record
—£94,124 equalling 17.4 p.c. on capital,
from which 10 p.c. went out as dividends.
The interim report for the December half
said sales and profit had touched new
records.
The extent of the improvement for
1963-64 will depend largely on the tax
charge—last year it was much lower than
normal because of deductions for invest-
ment allowances, export promotion and
the pre-acquisition losses of certain sub-
subsidiaries.

26.5 to 22.2 p.c. on capital increased by
a one-for-four bonus during the year.
Net result was approximately £471,000
after providing £485,000 for tax and
£225,000 for depreciation. The com-
pany has considerable outside share-
holders, which at least partly explains
the large tax provision. (Their interest
this year in the gross profit was
£112,000.)
A doubling of the stock provision to
£50,000 before arriving at the profit
figure is indicative of the company’s
prosperity.
Bushells has averaged 23.2 p.c. earn-
ings in the last five years, compared with
steady dividends of 10 p.c. The bonus
of last March was the first capital benefit
since listing in 1958.
The 20s. shares deserve being ranked
on a 2.5 p.c. yield (price 80s.). They
are not easy to pick up in quantity.
E. Anderson’s Special Report
Tn view of the concern over the halving
A in price of Eric Anderson (Consoli-

following enormous bad debts, the com-
pany has reported on trading for the four
months to April 30. Result was a profit
of £55,117, after taking into account all
known contingencies.
In the year to June, 1963, the com-
pany reported a profit of £230,191, but
appropriated £llO,OOO to a provision for
doubtful debts. In the six months to
last December, the company announced
a trading profit of £73,350 after £63,500
write-olfs. Then after an exhaustive
survey of debtors’ accounts it wrote off
a further £213,294.
At this point Eric Anderson said the
debtors’ accounts were being vigorously
followed up, and a substantial amount
could be recovered to improve the com-
pany’s position in the future.
The company declared last week it
was in a sound position to redeem de-
bentures for the next nine months, and
the board was concentrating on financial
budgeting beyond this.
Dividend last year was cut from
10 p.c. to 8 p.c.
Investors are being understandably
wary of this stock, particularly as rather
vague takeover negotiations fell through
recently.
Takeover Unlikely
TTopeful investors should discount any
early possibility of Transport Speci-
alties (Aust.) Pty Ltd being taken over
once it is publicly listed. The directors
intend to retain a majority holding in
the company’s issued capital.
Mr T. P. Wagner, managing director,
told The Bulletin last week that take-
over possibilities had not been considered
by directors and that their move was
being made only because they wished to
keep a substantial interest in the com-
pany they had built up.
The facts are that without this major-
ity holding the company would probably
be taken over quick smart. Its main
function is to supply components, mater-
ials and equipment for the transport and
trucking industries. These activities are
centralised near its head office in Gee-
long Rd, Brooklyn (Vic.), which is only
five minutes’ drive from the New Foots-
cray Rd transport centre.
At this centre the company serves
many customers, including such well-
known firms as Ansett, Brambles, Mayne
Nickless, Thomas Nationwide Transport
and Yellow Express. To any of these,
Transpec, as it is commonly known,
could provide a ripe little opportunity
to reduce maintenance costs.

Seeing that there are so many big
transporters down there, a veritable battle
for the company could easily take place
some day, but not in the near future
unless the directors decide to let a take-
over occur themselves.
This is a float which certainly de-
serves, and will get, heavy over-subscrip-
tion, especially as our transport industry
is currently booming at record levels.
Together At Last!
The merger between Melbourne’s Croft
Bank and Cranbourne dairying com-
panies had long been entertained by in-
vestors. When Metropolitan Dairies took
over Victorian Dairies a year ago, the
rumors again ran rife until Croft Bank’s
chairman, Mr J. J. O’Loughlin, said he
knew of nothing to support them.
The newly merged Croft Bank and
Cranbourne will be the third (capital-
wise) biggest Melbourne dairying group,
running after Metro and Model Dairy
Industries.
There are many reasons why a merger
has always been at the back of investors’
minds. Croft Bank has five directors.
Cranbourne has the same five plus one.
Both have ss. shares which ha’e been
selling around 14s. 6d. on the market
and on which both lots of shareholders
are currently receiving 124 p.c. in divi-
dends. Cranbourne was first listed in
1954, a year before Croft Bank.
Last year, Croft Bank made £67,000
on paid capital of £381,000, equalling
an earning rate of 17.8 p.c. Cranbourne
made £69,000 on £373,000, equalling
18.6 p.c. The merger protects both in
that it would not be very nice to be
the odd man out if the other was taken
over by one of the bigger dairies.
Investors have always kept the share
prices reasonably in line. If one dropped
too low, then it could possibly be sub-
ject to a profitable takeover by the other
through a one-for-one share issue, and
so the prices soon came back into line.
The merger is, of course, on a one-
for-one basis so there is nothing in it
for either group of shareholders, except
protection against one of them being
taken over.
Goodrich Comes Good
Ampol Petroleum Ltd will collect
about £75,000 in dividends from its
41.8 p.c. investment in B. F. Goodrich
Australia Pty.
Goodrich lifted profit in the last
calendar year by more than 50 p.c. to
about 12.8 p.c. on the £3 million capital,
and is paying a maiden dividend of 6 p.c.
The company was registered in Octo-
ber, 1958, and produced its first tyres
in January, 1960.
“Genuine” Profit by M. Simmons
TAirectors of Mick Simmons (Hold-
ings) Ltd, Sydney sporting goods
retailer, declared in their interim report
for the half-year to April, 1964, that the
company made a “small but genuine
profit”.
This curious phrase was a reference
to their statement in last year’s annual
report that from investigations made by
the new management (under Sir Arthur
Warner, chairman) it was obvious the
company had been operating at a trading
loss for a number of years.
In the year to October 31, 1963, a
trading loss of £57,597 was registered,
but additional sums were written off
stocks and debtors. Before that year a
small loss of less than £2OOO was re-
ported for 1961-62 (under the old
management) and a profit of £14,625 in
1960-61.
The last dividend paid was a 3 p.c.
interim in 1960-61, and directors have
not recommended an interim this year
because of the uncertainty of trading
results for the final half.
Benefits of the reorganisation would
not be felt until the next financial year,
according to the interim statement.
A debenture loan of £75,000 from in-
stitutions was repaid at the end of
April, without any overdraft increase,
which is an encouraging sign for
shareholders.
The ss. shares currently languish at
2s. 6d. on the market.
More Copper From Mt. Isa
Tn the production year to June 21,
1964, Mount Isa Mines Ltd lifted
copper production by 7.9 p.c. to a
record 70,895 tons.
Lead bullion production was almost
unchanged at 59,400 tons, and zinc con-
centrate output fell 13.6 p.c. from 57,952
to 50,083 tons.
The company’s financial year ended
on June 30, and results will be published
in September.

Doubts on Tliiess
that Brisbane contracting and
coalmining group, Theiss Holdings
Ltd had made a loss in the year to
June 30, and that this makes the
£350,000 registered unsecured notes im-
mediately repayable, triggered off a price
slide the next day to 4s. 4d.
Directors had said in the interim re-
port mid-April that although a loss (of
unstated proportions) was incurred in
the December half-year, they expected
this position to be reversed by June 30,
The notes in question are £98,400
8 p.c. notes repayable December, 1964,
£12,500 8 p.c. repayable December,
1967, and £239,100 8i p.c. repayable
December, 1970.
Their immediate redemption should
not throw the stock market into such a
panic, for at the beginning of June
Thiess raised £500,000 overseas with an
interest rate of 5$ p.c. (note the saving
in interest). Less fortunately, it was
forced for reasons of liquidity to sell
300,000 20s. shares of its 770,000 share-
holding in Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Coal
Pty at a premium.
The actual amount of the year's loss
is difficult to determine until claims have
been negotiated, and in the meantime,
shareholders will be plagued with doubts
as to the value of their investment.
The large number of contracts in hand
(over £36 million), the remaining in-
terest in extraction of coal from Moura,
and the Australian dealership for Toyota
motor vehicles should be kept in mind.
Those who sell in haste may repent at
leisure.
Mort’s Dock Keenly Priced
Shareholders of Mort’s Dock and
Engineering Co. Ltd will soon re-
ceive a 7s. second instalment of their
capital return.
The company went into liquidation
early in 1959, and 4s. was returned in
October, 1960.
Mort's Dock collected £365,000 from
the sale of 15 acres at Woolwich to the
Army, in addition to £241,409 from the
sale of nine acres in September.
Net funds available are £433,000 in-
cluding £BOOO deposit. The 7s. capital
return will absorb £341,229. The re-
maining freehold property (H acres on
Woolwich Road) is valued at £33,550,
but negotiations are proceeding for a
sale above this figure.
Recent transactions at a few pence
above 9s. for the 16s. shares show the
market has calculated very finely. There
is not much margin for extra expense in
the liquidation.


Fibro Supplier’s Outstanding Position
What price is justified for James Hardie shares?
By ROGER RANDERSON
1 yield to no one in my admiration of
James Hardie Asbestos Limited,
adopting the view of an experienced
friend that it is “one of the most profit-
able, progressive and efficient enterprises
of substantial size in Australia”.
From small beginnings as far back as
1888, the substantial Reid family has
guided the company and kept it ahead
of all competitors. Results for the year
ended March 31 surpassed expectations
and were simply excellent.
James Hardie is well known to Aus-
tralian home-builders because it makes
most of the asbestos cement building
sheets (“fibro”) used in this country.
In addition, the company is one of the
most important suppliers of pressure-
pipes, electrical conduit, brake-linings
and thermal insulation equipment.
The immediate outlook in the three
main fields where the company sells its
products—home and other private con-
structional activities, automotive and
railway industries, water, sewerage and
other public works—could scarcely be
brighter.
New products are steadily being
brought out following constant research,
economies are being effected by in-
creasing automation, and directors have
recently given a rough outline of long-
term plans for expansion in most
States, and also in New Zealand.
An important source of strength is
the company’s association with Turner &
Newall of the United Kingdom, which
holds a 40 p.c. interest in the £1,800,000
capital of James Hardie's subsidiary,
Hardie-Ferodo Pty Ltd.
The recent agreement that Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. will join James
Hardie in operating their thermal insu-
lation divisions as a joint venture is a
similar new development.
\Tevertheless, one is bound to review
the evidence on which the market has
recently been placing a very high valu-
ation on the 52 p.c. of James Hardie
shares which the public holds directly,
and on the shares of Hardie Holdings
Ltd, which tightly holds the remaining
48 p.c.
James Hardie is in the process of mak-
ing a one-for-four issue at par—the first
recourse it has had to shareholders for
capital since 1937.
Shareholders prior to this had re-
ceived a remarkable series of bonus
issues. These accounted for all but
£841,928 of the company’s capital of
£3,330,982 before the current cash issue.
The bonus issues were one-for-two in
each of the years 1948, 1951; one-for-
ten in 1954, and again one-for-two in
1955 and 1959.
Paid-up capital will be rounded off to
£4,200,000, by the allotment of fractions
together with 36,273 £1 shares to the
staff retirement fund, after allotments to
shareholders.
With the old £1 share standing at
more than £6, market dealings have been
taking place at more than £5 for a
“right” to subscribe £1 direct to the
company, and such dealings will con-
tinue until almost the end of this month.
“Speculator” indicated in his diary
last week that he had been put out by
the fact that “rights” to the new issue
had fallen from their opening price of
£5 15s. He covered himself by selling
his holding at a small profit.
Many investors, however, are inter-
ested to know whether recent prices for
the shares and “rights” are justified.
TAirectors had given encouragement to
the market by their final dividend
distribution of 82 p.c. on June 25, mak-
ing 13i p.c. for 1963-64, compared with
the 10 p.c. paid regularly for the pre-
ceding eight years.
One p.c. of this year’s dividend (paid
from 5.23 A reserves) was tax-free, but
2} p.c. was a bonus payment—and
directors have not committed themselves
to paying more than 10 p.c. on the
increased capital for the current year.
Dividend yields are low with the share
priced at £6 or more. The yield would
be less than 2\ p.c. from a 131 p.c.
dividend, and less than 1 f p.c. from a
10 p.c. dividend, although the earnings
yield of 41 p.c. is more satisfactory.
One needs to feel that higher divi-
dends, or a bonus issue with similar
effect, are a reasonably early prospect, in
order to discount the future to this
extent.
What guidance on this investment
aspect can we glean from the recent
accounts?
James Hardie seems to have earned
£937,452 in 1963-64, which is £226,451,
or almost 32 p.c., more than in the
previous year.
However, the chairman, Mr A. Thyne
Reid, warned his fellow-shareholders
that it would be imprudent to expect
last year's rate of growth to continue.
Adjusted profit represented an earning
rate of about 28.1 p.c. on capital, and,
after payment of dividends, left a sur-
plus of retained earnings amounting to
£512,456.
Depreciation charged before arriving
at net profit was £144,979 higher at
£1,724,409; and provisions for Austra-
lian and New Zealand income taxes
were £212,175 higher at £1,293,363.
VI/hile I share the general belief that
' James Hardie’s profits are stated
conservatively, I cannot subscribe to
fabulous estimates that are frequently
made of the company’s “true” earning
rate.
It is fairly clear that depreciation
charged is greater than the Commis-
sioner allows for Australian tax pur-
poses, but the fact is that the company’s
plant is subject to severe wear and tear
from abrasive raw materials.
Furthermore, provision for rapid
obsolescence is necessary in all com-
panies such as this which are introducing
innovations and improving their manu-
facturing techniques all the time.
The directors claim that their depre-
ciation charges are “realistic and pru-
dent”, and they are probably nearer the
mark than our legislators.
Depreciation in excess of allowable
deductions for income tax goes part of
the way to explain seemingly excess
provisions for income tax.
A further reason, often overlooked,
is that an undisclosed part of profits
comes from New Zealand operations—
and company rates, including an excess
retention of profits tax, are higher there.
Reference to the table tends to sug-
gest that there may have been an
under-provision of about £234,000 in
1960-61. Over-provisions appear to have
occurred of £400,000 in 1961-62 and
of £179,000 in 1962-63, and one sus-
pects an over-provision in the recent
year.
Although Mr A. Thyne Reid stated
that most of the accumulated funds at
balancing date had been absorbed by
payments for income tax, raw materials
and dividend, the company seems to be
raising capital well in advance of capital
requirements.
A note to the balance sheet shows
capital commitments “not elsewhere pro-
vided” at £601,099.
Proceeds from the new issue will
amount to about £869,000, but in addi-
tion the company seems to have an

A marked reduction in mortgages has
occurred in recent years, although
£1,090,000 of 8 p.c. first mortgage stock
was still outstanding at balancing date.
The issue, despite the fact that the
company has in recent years built up
its cash and short-term deposits to
£1,929,366, seems to suggest reduced
reliance in the future on external bor-
rowings and greater reliance on share-

Brick Industries v. Rio Tinto
feeling persists that the chairman
of Brick Industries, Mr R. I. Hamil-
ton, took things rather too lightly at the
annual meeting in Melbourne on June
26, when he told shareholders that the
company was not worried very much
over competition from Rio Tinto Brick
Pty Ltd, a newly-established subsidiary
of CRA.
As The Bulletin of June 27 (p. 69)
pointed out, the subsidiary has entered
the brick-making industry in no paltry
fashion, and should be turning in profits
which will augment CRA's result this
year.
In supporting his statement, Mr Hamil-
ton pointed out to a questioning share-
holder that Brick Industries was currently
producing about 117 million bricks a
year compared with Rio Tinto’s 25 mil-
lion. To say that these figures did not
cause much worry seems rather bold.
It is obvious that a battle could be
imminent, especially if demand begins
to fall.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
AGC as the H-P Leader
Only one dividend increase in last nine years
Last week we looked at the Bank of
New South Wales, so it is appropri-
ate this week to look at Australian
Guarantee Corporation Ltd, the “hire-
purchase” company in which the bank
holds a major interest.
The Bank of NSW acquired in July,
1957, 2,490,000 ordinary 20s, shares at
325. 6d. each. Today this holding
amounts to 13,280,000 ordinary ss.
shares currently valued by the market at
16s. 7d. each.
Dividends from this investment would
have in the 1962-63 year amounted to
£498,000 —about 15 p.c. of the disclosed
net profit of the bank. The current divi-
dend yield on cost would be about 12.3
p.c. tax-free.
Although the “other finance” group
of the Sydney “all ordinary index” may
not be a very good indicator of the trend
in price of the hire-purchase companies’
shares because of the weight of W. R.
Carpenter, it is interesting to look at the
graph of this particular index.
During 1963, it rose from a low
point of around 564 to about 680. It
was then pushed up to 718 in February,
but fell as low as 615 in May. It has
now recovered to the 660 level.
It is interesting to look at the per-
centage fall from the 1964 high point
of the index and the seven larger hire-
purchase companies included in this
index.

On the basis of “Outstandings”, there

of comparable size to Australian Guaran-

parison it is proposed to include the next

General Credits 7/6 5/11 6/7 21.2 12.3
It is now desirable to examine the
current prices in relation to dividends
and earnings. Unfortunately, two of the
stocks have made new issues to share-
holders since their last balance dates
and this makes any guess at the likely
earning rate very difficult.

In fairness to Associated Securities and
Finance Corporation, it must be said
that if they can maintain the previous
earnings rates on the new equity capital
raised, they would be the cheapest stocks
(apart from lAC) in terms of earnings
at the present time since the former
would be selling at a 7.8 p.c. earnings
yield and the latter at a 7.5 p.c. earnings
yield.
Presumably the market is anticipating
a fall in the earning rate of between
12 p.c. and 20 p.c. That is, if we believe
that the market does in fact price stocks
solely on the basis of current or antici-
pated earning rates.
On the other hand, one could be
forgiven for feeling that the dividend
yield might be of more significance in
pricing these stocks. Looking at the five
stocks which balance on the same date

same period, dividend yields and earnings

Even with these figures before you,
it is very difficult to see any basis for
valuing a “hire-purchase” company’s
shares. Looking at the trend of net
profit before tax to average total assets,
it is difficult to see where future growth
is likely to develop particularly where
the company concerned is already highly
geared.
In the following table we again confine
the figures to the five companies because
the change in balancing dates of some
of lAC’s subsidiaries make it difficult !'•
adjust the 1963 net profit to an appropri-
ate annual basis and General Credit’s
performance has been quite indifferent:—

(a) Ratio of borrowings to shareholders' funds.
While the limiting figure for gearing
seems rather indeterminate at present,
we could assume that so far as AGC is
concerned a ratio of 6 would be quite
possible, having regard to the ratios of
the others.
This would mean that total assets
could be increased by at least £l5 mil-
lion without any necessity to increase
ordinary capital. Assuming that the
1963 rate only could be earned on this
increase, earnings per share could rise
from 13.2 pence to 16.1 pence, or by
22 p.c.
In the case of the other companies, it
is difficult to feel confident that the
decline in the rates shown in the above
table has been halted. Even if we
assume that the return would be 3 p.c.
on new assets and that maximum gear-
ing will be achieved as soon as each new
issue of equity capital is made, it is
difficult to see the new equity capital
earning more than 14 p.c.
This suggests that apart from AGC we
can only expect per share earnings of the
companies to decline once maximum
gearing is reached and they are obliged
to make new share issues.
Issues at a premium will delay this
situation, and it must be admitted that
in some companies there is possibly room
for some cost saving in the general ad-
ministration.
With the foregoing in mind and having
regard to current prices, it seems that
Australian Guarantee Corporation repre-
sents the best value for money today
amongst the hire-purchase leaders. How-
ever, there has been only one increase in
the dividend payout over the last nine
years and the impression is given that
this occurred only because of the bid
made by Associated Securities in Janu-
ary, 1962.
It remains to be seen whether any
further increases take place if the earning
rate continues to rise as suggested. The
adjusted earnings per share have nearly
doubled since the low point was reached
in 1959-60 and dividends per share have
increased by only one-third.
Scope, therefore, exists for further in-
creases and unless some action is taken
Australian Guarantee Corporation could
lose ground in terms of the market price
of its shares to the other companies who
may need to make ordinary share issues
well before AGC has the same need.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Not Yet Out of the Doldrums
Nock and Kirby’s higher sales lift profit
A substantial increase in group sales
brought an increase in profit for
Nock and Kirby Ltd, Sydney speciality
hardware retailer, during the six months
to February 29, 1964.
Expenses also rose. Both Beard Wat-
son and Co. Ltd, the furniture and fur-
nishings subsidiary, Norlin Products Pty
Ltd, the manufacturing subsidiary, which
performed unsatisfactorily in 1962-63,
showed improved results in the first half
of the current year.
Profit in the last year to August 31
slumped from £133,455 to £21,679, and
dividend was cut from 8 p.c. to 5 p.c.
The earning rate was only 1.9 p.c. on
capital, so reserves filled the gap be-
tween net profit and the pay-out to
shareholders.
The 5 p.c. dividend rate is continued
with an interim payment of 2\ p.c., al-
though directors did not indicate whether
earnings for the February six months
covered this.
Since the half-way mark (February 29)
sales have continued above last year’s
figures but have disappointed directors
by not being as buoyant as in the first
half of the year.
Nock and Kirby began as an iron-
monger in George Street, Sydney, in
1906. The company became publicly
listed in 1955, after a placement of 10s.
shares at ss. premium.
In November, 1958, it made a one-
for-four par issue, and in February,
1959, it took over the business of Beard
Watson by an issue of 714,530 shares
and a cash payment.
The chairman (Sir Norman Nock) has
complained in two years’ reviews of the
high cost of land tax and rates on city
properties, describing them as the major
uncontrollable expense for the company.
In 1962-63 they totalled approximately
£lOO,OOO.
In the interim report a further refer-
ence was made to the heavy burden of
land tax, which bore no relation to trad-
ing or profit figures.
While it could be argued that Nock
and Kirby made a good deal in taking
over Beard Watson, because it gained
355. 6d. worth of conservatively valued
assets for each 255. paid out, unless those
assets are fully profit-producing they are
only a financial burden.
During 1962-63 abnormal stock write-
downs were necessary for Beard Watson,
and as sales volume was lower than in
the previous year and management prob-
lems developed, a loss was incurred by
this subsidiary.
A positive step to revitalise the Beard
Watson business was the move into
the contracting carpet and commercial
furniture and furnishings field. Outstand-
ing carpeting contracts were obtained for
the new P & O building, and the new
Reserve Bank.
It is understood that the Beard Watson
city property is for sale, if a reasonable
price can be obtained. There is a branch
store at Gordon, where Beard Watson
was followed by Farmers.
On August 31, 1963, freehold proper-
ties at cost and valuation, less a provi-
sion for depreciation on lifts, sprinklers,
etc., were shown at £2,471,853. Proper-
ties were revalued by £BOO,OOO in 1959-
60.
There are Nock and Kirby branch
stores at Wollongong, Warrawong, New-
castle, Liverpool, Campbelltown, Parra-
matta, Seven Hills, Bankstown, Fairfield,
Penrith, Hornsby, Ryde and Maroubra
Junction (opened in October, 1963). The
Dee Why Nock and Kirby and Beard
Watson stores will open shortly. The
Penrith store will be completely re.
modelled by July.
Nock and Kirby has a 25 p.c. holding
in Outboard Marine Australia Pty, the
rest being held by Outboard Marine Cor-
poration of Canada Ltd. It distributes
Johnson and Evinrude outboard motors
and Pioneer chain saws.
It also has a 51 p.c. interest in the
Valor Co. of Australia Pty, making
kerosene appliances, and Highway De-
velopment Pty, a Victorian development
and investment company.
While the credit squeeze, particularly
as it affected home building, was an
obvious reason for the difficulties of
1960-61, no such uncontrollable factor
(other than growing land taxes) could
be blamed for the poor trading perform-
ance in 1962-63.
To follow the example of the chain
variety and food stores in their system
of merchandising and display, and their
policy of property sale and lease-back
might extricate the Nock and Kirby
group from its present doldrums.
On recent performance the 10s. shares
are worth no more than the market
price of 9s. Id., but shareholders who
see the net tangible assets backing of
25s. 9d. per share justifiably resent dis-
posing of their holdings at this price.

As the company is headquartered in
London, all figures presented here are in
sterling currency.
The company acts as general mer-
chant, manufacturer, warehouseman, rum
distiller and general agent, with branches
in Queensland and the Northern Terri-
tory at Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, the
Gold Coast, Mackay, Rockhampton and
Townsville.
Subsidiary companies are Tunleys Pty,
manufacturer of jute and printed calico
bags, Caledonian House Pty, maker of
shirts and clothing, Holsum Products
Pty, food packer and processor, and
H. A. Manahan and Sons Pty, retail
store.
The year to January 31, 1964, brought
a trading profit of £81,459 after tax of
£73,513 and depreciation of £35,024.
It compares with the previous year’s pro-
fit of £78,229 after £59,963 tax and
£34,415 depreciation. Both profits ex-
clude capital profits from the sale of
investments and fixed assets.
Sales of the parent rose by 12.3 p.c.
to a record, but higher wage costs and
difficult handling conditions cancelled this
out. On August 1, 1962, a voluntary
group of independent grocery retailers
set up under the name “Foodland”, the
better to cope with competition from
the chain retailers. Now this group has
201 members and 165 associate members
in NSW and Queensland.
Maximum benefit will not be obtained
until the group operates from low cost
warehouses.
The company took possession of the
first part of the Rocklea building at the
end of March, and food and tobacco,
confectionery and stationery are opera-
ting from there now. The balance of the
warehouse, including drapery, wines,
spirits and bottling departments and the
administrative offices, should move from
Eagle Street to Rocklea in October.
To finance the new warehouse, acquire
a freehold property in Sydney for Hoi-
sums, and to improve group liquidity,
Thomas Brown obtained a new unsecured
loan in November, 1963. It is for
£375,000 at 61 p.c., of which half was
received in November and half on
June 1, 1964.
Turnover for the April, 1964, quarter
showed a satisfactory increase. A
vastly improved service is expected after
establishment of the new warehouse, with
consequent economies and better profits.
The company envisages erection of
modern warehouses at certain branches
in the future. Installation of electronic
data processing equipment on a rental
basis in March, 1965, should aid profita-
bility.
The 20s. sterling shares are listed in
London, Brisbane, Sydney and Mel-
bourne and currently bring about 39s.
(Aust.) to yield 3.9 p.c. They have
limited appeal to Australian investors.
A one-for-three issue at 30s. (Aust.)
per share was made in September, 1961,
but the stock is primarily an investment
for income.

BANKERS AND TRADERS’ INS. CO. LTD
Premium Record, but Profit Falls
A loss on underwriting severely affec-
ted the result produced by Bankers
and Traders’ Insurance Co. Ltd for the
year to March 31, 1964. Group net
profit fell from the record £163,167 the
year before, to £104,176 after reducing
tax provision from £85,962 to £15,961.
Claims were heavier in all depart-
ments, but particularly in the motor
vehicles, third-party and workers’ com-
pensation sections. Fire losses were
generally much higher, and the company
shared in the Townsville sugar fire.
Of course, the insurance industry as a
whole, both in Australia and overseas, is
greatly concerned with this trend in
losses. It is not peculiar to Bankers and
Traders.
Premium revenue moved up from
£2,348,363 to a record £2,472,821, and
investment income rose from £163,742
to £177,825, also a record.
The company was set up in Sydney in
1921. It has branches now in all State
capitals and 30 sub-branches throughout
Australia, and branches also in Singa-
pore and London.
Burns Philp and Co. Ltd has a sub-
stantial interest in Bankers and Traders,
and the two companies have two com-
mon directors.
Directors told shareholders that during
1963-64, the organisation was strength-
ened in Australia by the establishment
of a new branch (at Burnie, Tas.) and
overseas by a branch in Malaysia.
Investments as at March 31, 1964, were
in the books at cost (less investment
fluctuation) (£3,003,238 compared with
£2,699,271 the year before. The latest
figure included £1,194,207 shares, de-
bentures and notes of listed companies,
which had a then market value of
£2,068,927.
Provision for unexpired risks has
grown from £946,269 to £996,475, and
unadjusted claims and reinsurances out-
standing rose from £1,297,883 to
£1,343,815.
The company has always been highly
regarded, partly because of the Burns
Philp association. Cash issues to share-
holders have been made occasionally,
with long intervals between calls.


A one-for-fcur issue of 20s. shares at
par in September, 1956, was not fully
paid until six years later. A one-for-
five issue at 40s. premium in September,
1963, was fully paid by March 31, 1964,
bringing issued capital to £600,000.
(There were a few calls in arrears, so
paid capital at balance date was
£599,449.)
The shares have been as high as
£5 15s. this year, but have fallen to 85s.
since release of the 1963-64 profit. The
income return at that price is still only
2.9 p.c. and the prospects of com-
pensation by an early capital benefit are
rather remote. The shares have limited
appeal.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Paying Attention to Curves
Some ventures of a layman chartist
Stockbrokers were probably behind
the times a couple of years ago,
but some of them have been desperately
trying to make up the leeway since.
The topless fashion had only been in
(or is it out?) a few weeks before one
Sydney broker was offering portfolio
revues! Perhaps Mary Broker had
been called in for consultation and this
was her recommendation. If this is to
be the fashion, I suppose I should be
selling Berlei and buying Katies. It’s all
very romantic, though share charts with
their curves are much more in my line.
In fact, the Anderson Meat chart that
I"d been studying offered more than a
few curves. Its price had formed a
beautiful triangle around the 20s. mark.
The trend of turnover behaved properly
by showing a steady decrease. The
breakout from the triangle was on high
volume and there was the traditional
pull back. What more could a layman
chartist want?
By the time I'd absorbed all this, the
price was on the rise again and my
purchase of 400 shares was at an
average of 21s.
To confirm the findings of the chart,
directors have apparently told employees
that they’ve just finished a very good
year. Perhaps the interim report, say-
ing that profits in the first half of the
year were lower than those in the com-
parable period last year, threw the in-
vestor off his balance. It's to be re-
membered that the great bulk of the
1962-63 profit of £113,000 was earned
in the first half-year. So it’s well on the
cards that last year’s earning rate of
19 p.c. will be topped this year.
Another company, Treloar Enter-
prises, which made the portfolio this
week, has the same earning rate. But
here the similarity between Treloar and
Anderson Meat ends. Instead, we can
draw a parallel with Protector. Both
have small capitals and both are relative
newcomers to the Stock Exchange.
However, each company is the largest
in its own respective industry—Protector
in protection safety equipment and
Treloar in nozzles and couplings used
in the bulk handling of liquids.
Profits in both cases have com-
pounded at about a 50 p.c. rate each
year. In the case of Treloar, an earning
rate this year between 25 p.c. and 30
p.c. does not seem to be unduly
optimistic following last year’s 19.7 p.c.
Once again the purchases got beyond
control and I went over the £lOOO debit
mark. So 1 had no choice with the
Pioneer Concrete rights but to sell them
at 3s. 6d. A forced loss of £lO could
well have been a profit in due course if
I had the money to take up the rights.
The need for liquidity also made me take
a small loss of £3 on the Besser V. (Qld).
A sale that ended on a happier note
was the 500 Western Titanium at an
average price of 10s. 6d. The profit of
£3l more than outweighed the earlier
losses. In this case it was simply taking
a profit after the quick rise. My con-
fidence in the tin market still remains.
Although the General Services Ad-
ministration (which controls the Ameri-
can tin stockpile) has released 15,000
tons for the first six months of the year
to boost normal production, total world
supply could only just match world
demand. The annual deficit must there-
fore be currently 30,000 tons. As the
GSA intends to offer no more than
20,000 tons per annum, the world price
of £stgl23o could rise even further.
Aggravating the situation is that a list
of the major producing countries is
interchangeable with a list of major
trouble spots in the world today
the Congo, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand.
Thus Tableland Tin still looks very
good. Although ore dredged in June was
lower, the recovery of 90 tons of tin was
most respectable.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
2000 Pioneer Concrete rfs, 3/6 £333
500 Western Titanium, 10/6 ... £256
500 Besser Vibrapac, 9/4 £228
BOUGHT
400 Anderson Meats, 21/- £438
500 Treloar, 11/6 £295
These transactions leave the account
in debit to the tune of £322.

SHARE OPTION TRADING
BECOMING POPULAR
The buying and selling of options on stocks
and shares has long been a significant invest-
ment activity in England and America. Until
recent times Australians had paid little atten-
tion to the various methods of using Put and
Call Options to achieve profits and, at the same
time, to safeguard their investment decisions.
One simple example of how you can profit
from option trading is . . . You arrange an
option to buy some likely shares (say within
three months). If, as you anticipated, the
shares rise in value at some time during this
period, you will then exercise the option. This
means that you obtain the shares at the lower
price prevailing when the option was arranged.
Thus you profit to the extent of the value
variation.
On the other hand, should the shares not
rise as you expected, or even fall in value
during the option period, you will let your
option expire. All it will have cost you is the
small premium paid for the option. You will
not have lost on the falling price of the shares.
The various methods of how people profit from
Put and Call Options are explained in a

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Reserve Price for Wool Gains
Significant Support
Ex-politician-grazier condemns auction system
rpHE Australian Growers’ Wool Market-
ing Committee has enlisted the sup-
port of another big woolgrower, Mr
C. W. Russell, of Dalby, Queensland.
Mr Russell heads family pastoral com-
panies running some 30,000 sheep and
20,000 cattle on the stations Buckingham
Downs, Logan Downs and Jimbour
House in Queensland. He was a Coun-
try Party MLA in 1947-48 and MHR
(Maranoa) from 1949 to 1951. He is
a director of a number of companies in
secondary industry.
The Australian Growers’ Wool Mar-
keting Committee works for a reserve
price marketing scheme for wool and
enlistment of men of the calibre of
Russell is significant. Broadly speaking
(and it is a pretty broad generalisation)
smaller growers favor reserve price mar-
keting; the big squatters favor the present
free auction system.
If enough big men come in behind a
reserve price idea then the industry will
get that form of marketing because these
men are big in the sense that they own
perhaps ten to 40 times the number of
sheep of the average woolgrower.
News that Russell is now on the side
of reserve price marketing will hearten
the many thousands of small growers.
He joins L. A. Simpson (20,000 sheep)
of Oaklands, NSW, although to be pre-
cise Simpson supports the Australian
Growers’ Wool Marketing Committee
without actually belonging to it.
A word of explanation about this Aus-
tralian Growers’ Wool Marketing Com-
mittee is perhaps needed. Headquartered
in Canberra, its chairman is Mr Alan
W. Campbell who is managing director
of the Queensland Primary Producers’
Co-operative Association Ltd.
It should not be confused with the
Australian Wool Board Marketing Com-
mittee which, just to add to the possi-
bility of confusion, includes a Mr
D. A. S. Campbell, a big Sydney wool-
buyer and a former chairman of the
Australian Council of Woolbuyers.
Alan W. Campbell is sometimes con-
fused also with Alan J. Campbell, a
Queensland grazier, former Queensland
Country Party Chairman and chairman
of the board of “The Countryman”
newspaper.
Having sorted out the Campbells and
the committees we now return to Mr
C. W. Russell. He is at present in London
and on behalf of the Australian Growers’
Wool Marketing Committee has issued a
statement that he has found general
agreement in Europe that without price
stability wool promotion is a waste of
money.
The Growers’ Committee asked him
to make an investigation into aspects of
marketing in Europe on its behalf. His
views coincide with those of L. A. Simp-
son, which have appeared previously in
these pages.
Although Russell does not specifically
attack the Wool Board and the Interna-
tional Wool Secretariat, his views do not
coincide at all with the promotion ideas
of these bodies. He said in his statement
that his investigations had convinced him
that Australia should introduce a reserve
price plan without delay.
He believed that constantly fluctuating
wool prices tended to swing manufac-
turers away from wool and towards
synthetics.
New Zealand and South Africa had
reserve price schemes, but the full bene-
fits, for the manufacturing industry par-
ticularly, would be felt only if Australia,
the biggest producer, also participated.
In the UK, Italy and France he had
discovered people with an idea that a
reserve price scheme might mean an un-
reasonably high price. But after he had
explained just what a reserve price
scheme would mean, the resistance had
changed to enthusiasm.
The manufacturers now realised that
it would not be an attempt to exact a
price, but an attempt to safeguard the
industry against the recurrence of price
collapses that were not capable of being
rationally explained.
The present free auction system, said
Russell, provided no means of arresting
a falling market. The futures system,
claimed by some to act as a hedge against
a prices fall, actually tended to cause
market falls.
Distant futures were usually lower
than short-dated ones and this, in itself,
anticipated a lower market which had
the effect of bringing the market down.
Russell said it was unfortunate that
some Australian woolgrowers appeared
convinced that an acquisition scheme
would be a desirable, or possible, alter-


native (Bulletin, July 4). He believed
that with a reserve price scheme the
Australian woolgrowers would have the
“best of both worlds” and would avoid
the risk of possible socialisation.
All this will be grist to the mill for
the 50 delegates to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference which meets in
Canberra on July 16-17 to consider the
report of the Australian Wool Board
Marketing Committee.
This committee has been investigating
wool marketing and, in particular, four
separate systems—the free auction, re-
serve price, acquisition, appraisal. But
is there a division of opinion between the
Wool Board itself and its own Wool
Marketing Committee?
Going on the brief announcement of
Wool Board chairman, Sir William
Gunn, when he arrived back in Sydney
from the world textile conference in
Berlin, it appears that there might be
just that.
Sir William said: “It (the marketing
report) may be the committee's recom-
mendation or a modification of it.”
Until this statement by Gunn nobody
really seriously canvassed the idea that
the report would be anything but the
report of the Marketing Committee. The
fact that the board would present it, on
behalf of the Marketing Committee, was
regarded as a mere formality.
Why did Gunn say what he did?
With the July 16-17 meeting only a
week or so away it may be unwise to
speculate too rashly. But a significant
thing happened about six weeks ago.
Mr G. D'Arcy Chislett, the economist
of the Australian Woolgrowers’ and
Graziers’ Council, said, among other
things, that there was “no reason to be-
lieve that the Marketing Committee’s
report would be different from previous
reports on a reserve price scheme”.
In other words, Mr Chislett appeared
quite confident that the report would be
“thumbs down” on a reserve price.
Mr Chislett may have let the cat out of
the bag.
The Australian Woolgrowers’ and
Graziers’ Council (the Graziers for
short) represent half the Australian Wool
Industry Conference and, again broadly
speaking, they have indicated they favor
retention of free auction.
Gunn, without going too far, has in
the past let growers know that he be-
lieves some changes in marketing are
necessary, and it should not be forgotten
that he was president of the Queensland
Graziers’ in the Joint Organisation
referendum of 1950. The Queensland
Graziers’ were the only State body of
their association to favor reserve price
selling.
Is it likely that Gunn now believes the
Marketing Committee has not gone far
enough towards recommending market-
ing changes and that he will try to get
the Wool Board to modify their report
to that end? It could be.
The other possibility—that the Mar-
keting Committee has gone too far —
hardly stands up. To get the thing in
its right perspective the make-up of both
the Wool Board and the Marketing Com-
mittee needs to be studied—the per-
sonalities involved also.
The Australian Wool Board: Sir Wil-
liam Gunn, D. von Bibra, P. Mcßride,
A. Beggs (all Graziers); E. A. Green,
F. R. Howell, C. D. Renshaw (the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation officially supporting reserve
price): A. N. Armstrong (Commonwealth
Banking Corporation); D. A. S. Camp-
bell (woolbuyer); S. S. Nevile (textile
manufacturer); A. L. Senger (Depart-
ment of Primary Industry).
The Wool Board Marketing Commit-
tee: Messrs Nevile, Renshaw and Camp-
bell (Board members); G. W. Docker
(Elder Smith, Goldsbrough Mort); S. C.
Burston (Graziers).
Federation men —the smaller wool-
growers (broadly speaking, as some are
individually quite big woolgrowers)
claim they are heavily outnumbered on
the Marketing Committee and not quite
so heavily outnumbered on the Wool
Board. On the Wool Industry Confer-
ence they have 50 p.c. representation.
Whatever the report recommends
many woolgrowers will want to know,
and would appear entitled to know, if
and how this report differs from the
report framed by the Marketing Com-
mittee.
If the Wool Board does, in fact,
modify it they will want to know what
the modifications are.
“Big Bill” Gunn also on his return
announced that both he and the chair-
men of the Wool Boards of South Africa
and New Zealand would in future be
taking a much closer look at the activi-
ties of the IWS throughout the world.
This will do much to restore Gunn’s
popularity with critics who have claimed
the IWS has been using woolgrowers’
money (per medium of the promotion
levy) for an international champagne
party. With this closer supervision they
will at least be able to get a better idea
of where their money is going.
Whether it works out that way, or
whether it is an example of Gunn’s flair
for politics will be known in due course.
The Commonwealth Government has
now officially given its seal to the in-
creased levy (about 275. a bale) and a
lot of money, about £ll million a year
for the next five years, is ear-marked
for promotion. How and where the
money goes is another thing the wool-
growers are entitled to know in precise
detail.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
"Woolly Thinking”
on Marketing
Sir,
In investigating the recent fall in wool
prices, Mr Lawrence Simpson (“Man on
the Land'’, 27/6/64) has discovered that
UK wool stocks fell 16 p.c. between
January and March, and has inferred
that UK wool buyers (are they the only
offenders?) have ‘'manipulated” price (a
conspiracy seems to be implied) by re-
ducing their purchases.
I wish to advance an alternative and
much simpler interpretation—that de-
mand for a product tends to fall when
price rises, including the demand from
people holding stocks. When such people
feel that prices are at or near their peak,
and will soon decline (as many felt about
wool prices early this year) they decide
they will let let stocks run down, to be
replaced later.
In a competitive market it is gener-
ally accepted that this behavior has a
stabilising effect on prices—if the “bears”
who reduce stocks prove to be right, and
prices fall, they will be re-entering the
market to replenish their stocks at a time
when they are most needed. Of course,
if their hunch was wrong, they lose
money.
In effect, stockholders who follow a
sensible policy of adjusting (manipula-
ting?) their stocks are performing the
same valuable stabilising function as that
envisaged for a “reserve price” authority
—they are running a “buffer stocks
scheme”. * +
There is a large number of UK wool
buyers, which makes the organisation
of a UK-wide “pie” at least difficult,
though not impossible, and there is a
much larger number of buyers from
other countries, which would make it
difficult for the UK “ring” to dictate
world prices.
If other buyers disagreed with the UK
“manipulators’ ” assessment of future
wool prices, their demand would prevent
any considerable drop in price, and yet
a considerable fall occurred; perhaps,
then, they agreed that prices would fall,
and did not step up their buying to offset
the reduction in UK buying.
Thus we are led to Mr Simpson's
real discovery—that prices will fall if
there is general agreement that they are
likely to fall, and in this case there was
some cause for such a belief.
Pies undoubtedly exist, but it is im-
portant to remember that a reserve price
scheme would not prevent them —they
could still operate whenever prices were
above the reserve.

“Not Good Public
Relations”
Sir,
The chairman of the International
Wool Secretariat, Sir William Gunn, was
reported on June 24 as having said:
“From now on we do not intend to dis-
close the size of our budget (that is, of
the IWS) let alone the individual break-
up. We are running a commercial orga-
nisation and we must run it on commer-
cial lines.”
The IWS can be regarded as a public
company to which it is comparable. Sir
William Gunn and the IWS should be
obliged to publish a report and balance
sheet just as all public companies must.
Vital information of importance to IWS
competition with synthetic manufacturers
need not be disclosed. This obligation
rests with the Australian Wool Industry
Conference.
Gunn's attitude on the question of the
IWS budget is a reflection of the Secre-
tariat's disregard of its responsibilities.
The same applies to the AWB. Gener-
ally speaking, the IWS and the AWB
project an ugly image in the minds of
many Australian farmers because of this
disregard. If it wants to ensure continu-
ance of fund provision, the IWS should
give some thought to public relations.
To say, as Gunn said recently, “We are
not in a popularity contest” is not good
PR.
Certainly many farmers may not be
able to see the long-term implications of
broad AWB and IWS promotion policies
which are probably sound but to the
practical farmer mind may seem extra-
vagant and irrelevant. The onus then is
on the body backing a policy, be it the
AWB or IWS, to show, by close and
sound reasoning, that to the best of its
knowledge the policy will mean fruitful
promotion—that the promotion should
stimulate demand for wool.

Flock of Wild
Sheep
for Research
VlTest Australian sheep men last
month were excited by the
news of a flock of sheep that have been
running wild with a herd of goats.
While they certainly would not win a
Royal Show ribbon, their history makes
them truly fascinating. They were once
Merinos, used for station mutton in the
rugged cattle country of the East Kim-
berleys. But that was 36 years ago when
there more than 300 of them.
The country has whittled down the
numbers, and the law of natural selection
has retained in these few a hardiness that
is exciting to Kimberley people, Agricul-
tural Department scientists, and even the
Wool Board who want to know more
about them.
Agricultural Department pastoral ad-
visor Henk Suijdendorp says the flock
has great possibilities for improving
sheep throughout the north-west, where
the lambing rate is a disheartening 30
p.c.
He says the super-Merinos have an
excessively plain body and are “very
forward in body condition” with very
little wool. In layman's language that
means they are a lot bigger and a lot less
woolly than their temperate cousins.
Ewes weigh anything up to a hefty 1201 b.
“The nearest thing I have seen to
these was the Dorper, the mutton Merino
of South Africa,” says Suijdendorp.
The department has known about the
mavericks for some time, and plans to
bring them during the spring to Abydos
Research Station, in the spinifex coun-
try, 90 miles inland from Port Hedland.
The last outside ram joined the herd
38 years ago, so the sheep are severely
in-bred. This accounts for their poor
wool. The plan is to cross-breed them
with domestic sheep in the hope that they
will pass on their remarkable ability to
survive heat and drought.
Balloons as Bird Scarers
npHE flying of synthetic rubber “Neo-
prene” balloons has been remark-
ably successful in controlling the depre-
dations of sparrows and other small birds
upon farm crops.
The 100-gram balloons have a diame-
ter of 2ft. 6in. when inflated. After
being filled with hydrogen they are flown
at a height of 60 to 100 ft. from 8 to 10ft.
masts which ensure that they remain well
above the crop in wind.
They usually fly two or three days
before requiring refilling and appear to
be effective over an area of about 100
yards square.
