Half our sales come from
replacing our competitor’s
dry copiers.
"'tiMmnammT' — i
rtTV
Mr. Burning
welcomes
comparison,
One reason:
Our Bruning dry copier
makes copies twice as fast,
often at half the cost.
The toughest way to make a sale is to
displace a competitor’s product. Yet the
Bruning 2000 bumps Brand “X” off the
floor in half the sales we make.
Why? Because we prove that the
Bruning 2000 makes copies twice as fast.
Furthermore, we prove that it often makes
| these copies at half the cost.
So when prospects see how Mr. Bru-
\ ning’s wonderful copying machine de-
livers copies for as little at 3.5 pence
per copy (including materials and de-
preciation for volume purchasers), they’re
halfway sold.
And when they sec that they can copy
documents from cheque size to 11 inches
by any length, and that they can buy,
rent, or lease the Bruning 2000, they’re
completely sold.
Like to see the Bruning 2000 electro-
static copier in action? The Bruning man
is eager to demonstrate it. Solo, or against
any brand you’re now using. You’ll find
him in the ’phone hook under Bruning
or Addressograph Multigraph in all capi-
tal cities. Or write Dept. A, P.O. Box

STC Australian Pentaconta Crossbar
PABX introduces entirely new refine-
ments to executive levels of telecom-
munication. Streamlined, automated,
the system creates a climate of extreme
efficiency and simplicity and reflects
these attributes to each caller into the
system.
Handling of local, national, or inter-
national calls by the executive supplies
a significant example. By pressing the
button on the front of the telephone,
such calls can be held while another call
is made either internally or outside seek-
ing information. The button provides the
means of transferring incoming calls
internally without recourse to the push-
button Pentaconta switchboard. Top
level executive contact with the tele-
phonist is via the same button on the
telephone, as is immediate access to an
outgoing exchange line.
This is merely one of the many out-
standing features of the STC Australian
Pentaconta Crossbar PABX.

National Notebook
Heavily Booked
TTqchhuth’s “The Representative”
A A opened a few nights ago at Sydney’s
Old Tote with the heaviest advance book-
ings the tiny theatre has had. The theatre
was booked out for the equivalent of
more than a week of the season, which is
limited to six weeks. After Sydney “The
Representative” is already booked for a
Brisbane season but that may be all.
With a cast of 13 it is not likely to follow
jn the successful path of “Who’s Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?” which had, of
course, only four players.
The Old Tote regards all the 13 actors
as leading players and would not feel
inclined to send a nucleus to other States
and have the cast brought to strength
with local actors. It appears impossible
to get into the new Canberra Theatre
Centre and just as unlikely that another
theatre would be available in Sydney for
an extended season here.
Apart from the large cast, “The Rep-
resentative” is an expensive proposition
because of the unusually high royalties
paid to the author, who may have a
message but who is not prepared to send
it at cut rates.

gYDNEY’s fun fair, Hyde Park, has had
another small slice taken out of what
remains of its grass. It had seemed at
the moment that the destroyers had
moved out to Centennial Park to do their
worst there, but they, apparently, still
have some time and energy for Hyde
Park.
The new depredation is a plot which
at the moment is fenced off but which
has outlined on it the strange legend
Girls’ Brigade, 1940-1965” and a map
of Australia. Come the spring and this,
if one can judge from the seedlings, will
be blazoned forth in the City Council’s
favorite near-weed mauve and white
alyssum.
If the Girls’ Brigade wishes to adver-
tise that it is 25 years old, why can’t it
pay to do so like everyone else?
Fable for Our Times
Jn London, two Australian con men
have been getting rich pickings from.
New Zealanders with a skilful betting
swindle. Orthodox warnings have had no
effect. The tricksters continue to claim
their victims. Perhaps what is needed is a
latter-day Aesop’s fable entitled “The
Kindly Kangaroos and the Credulous
Kiwi’’:
Once upon a time, a tourist Kiwi was
in the entrance of New Zealand House,
London, thinking what a spendidly
glazed aviary it was, when a Kangaroo
offered to show him the sights of the city.
For over a week, the Kangaroo did,
shouting the Kiwi drinks and introducing
him to Sheila-Birds with gorgeous plu-
mage. When the Kiwi tried to buy him
a drink or a meal in his turn, the Kanga-
roo always refused. “Anything for a
Kiwi,” he would say. So the Kiwi was
charmed when the Kangaroo introduced
him to his equally generous Cobber
Kangaroo. He was double-charmed when
he watched them share a camel-choking
wad of winnings. He .was trebly charmed
when they invited him to take advantage
of an arrangement they had with Horses.
He had no qualms about staking £25,
especially since the Kangaroo said the
bet was on credit.
Sure enough when he met his generous
friends next day, he found that they had
again been able to persuade a Horse to
win for them. There was-a slight snag,
said the Kangaroo. Since he had been
betting on credit, it was now necessary
for the Kiwi to establish with the Pom-
mie bookmaker that his credit was good,
at least to the amount of his winnings.
“An old Pommie custom which just
proves what crazy animals these Pom-
mies are,” said the Cobber Kangaroo, as
he wrote out a cheque for £l3OO, the
amount of his winnings. They made it
clear that they would all be going to-
gether to collect their winnings and then
on to the biggest Kangaroo-Kiwi shivoo
of all time. So the Kiwi wrote out his
cheque to cash and handed it to the
Kangaroo who said that he and his cob-
ber would just hop outside for a taxi,
and why didn’t the Kiwi take a perch.
Gratefully, the Kiwi did, wondering
how it could ever have come about that
some Kiwis disliked Kangaroos. Five
minutes passed, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
20 minutes. Suddenly, the Kiwi uttered
his distress call and hopped outside. As
he looked in confusion at London’s one-
way traffic, he wished as he never wished
before that he could fly.
When he got to his bank eventually in
a taxi, the Manager Owl was very wise
and very sympathetic. But the Kiwi’s
nest-egg was lighter by £950, the amount
of the cheque he had made out. He was
not consoled when the Manager-Owl in-
formed him that the Kangaroos had
tricked other Kiwis in the same way and
that the Scotland Yard Bloodhounds were
doing their best to trace the Kangaroos.
The moral of this fable is: Kiwis may
allow Kangaroos to shout drinks but they
must not allow them to talk to Horses
on their behalf.
Joy Bells
Tt was hard to tell who was more
A nervous at Joy Nichols’s welcome-
back-to-Melbourne Press reception—the
clutch of young reporters interviewing a
local star most of them obviously hadn’t
heard of before, or the star herself who
was soon made aware of the fact by
some of the awkward questions.
Then, for us slightly oldsters, it did
seem hard to realise that it was all of
19 years since her farewell show with
brother George at Sydney Tiv. And for
her they have been first vigorous, then
slowing-down-in-tempo years until now
she talks of herself as a wife and mother
as much as she does of the entertain-
ment star.
Now she has a 13-year-old daughter,
Roberta, and three-year-old twins,
Richard and Victoria. It was a keen-
eyed Roberta who pointed out to her
mother that few American stars would
get the big receptions at the airport and
later at a Lonsdale St restaurant that
she was getting after such a long absence
from both the local scene and any sort
of limelight.
The passed years, motherhood, 12
years in America plus the wary caution
of most of the reporters seemed to cause
her to draw herself up into a slightly
more grande dame stage character than
any of us old fans would have imagined
possible. Brightly she held court on pas-
sing entertainment fads, American

fashions, and what a “big thrill” it was
to be back at last.
It was only when she began mingling
with the slightly older radio and TV
identities with longer memories that she
grew back more into the more carefree,
semi-larrikin character that is still just
below the surface and very much a part
of her. Then she tossed in bits of
mimicry, a few verbal joshes, posed
spontaneously for a photographer as she
dangled an oyster precariously on a
toothpick and seemed glad of the chance
to look back a little over all those years.
“I was too young and didn't realise
what was happening when I became such
a quick success in England —at the
Palladium and on the BBC within
months of arriving there,” she said. “I
rather took it for granted and didn’t think
much of what was going to happen in
the years ahead. Not that I have any
regrets at all oh, no.”
She also insists that she has no regrets
about leaving all that in England in 1953
to go to the US with her American
husband, Wally Peterson, who had
trouble getting follow-on parts in
England after his lead in the production
there of the musical “Oklahoma”.
As she tells it, her biggest troubles
have been purely accent ones. “When I
first went to England the BBC told me
to hang on to my Canadian accent,” she
recalled. “Then, when I went to live in
New York they thought I sounded ter-
ribly British. Now, as I’m talking more
with Australians again, 1 feel I’m sound-
ing more Australian too.”
She has returned to play the lead in the
comedy “Instant Marriage” which will
start its Australian season at the Mel-
bourne Tivoli on August 7. The play is
a broad mixture of play and vaudeville
and about a girl trying to find a marriage
bureau and, mistakenly, getting involved
with a strip joint where they are only
interested in getting her to disrobe. “I like
it because the character could have been
me,” Miss Nichols said. “And it’s a lot
of fun something like Gracie Fields
would have done.”
No one dared mention the word
“comeback” but everyone got the impres-
sion that today, at 38, with marriage,
motherhood and a sort of crazy-quilt
career behind her, nothing would be
more real beaut for Joy Nichols than a
dinky-di big stage success.
Hollywood on Higham
member of The Bulletin,
Charles Higham, is visiting Holly-
wood. On page 25 his interview' w'ith
Mae West appears. Miss West rarely
gives interviews these days. Higham
managed it by telephoning her before he
left Sydney. These days Miss West
accepts only international calls.
However, while Mr Higham has
been turning his quick eye and sharp
pen on Hollywood, Hollywood has been
watching him. Hedda Hopper’s column
recorded his arrival:
“Charles Higham, a very hep reporter
from Australia, who loves pictures, is
here for a visit. I had a fun hour with
him and Bob Vogel, my Metro pal who’s
been there for 20 years. One of our
favorites at MGM was the late Frank
Whitbeck, who was mad for animals,
especially elephants. Higham told me
about watching him arrive in Australia
with a son of Leo the Lion in a 750-
dollar rosewood cage. Frank wanted the
beast to be comfortable.
“Vogel ,told this one about Whitey
Hendry, Metro head of police for many
years. There was so much stealing going
on, he asked Louis Mayer for more
guards. Louis told him to get as many
as he needed. He hired 30 more and
during their first night of duty a grand
piano was stolen.
“Higham knew all about Australia’s
Sir Edward Hallstrcm and his haunted
castle. Told me not to miss their Gold
Cup race.”
Charles Higham’s Hollywood will
appear in The Bulletin of July 31.
The Coming of Spring
A Manner of Reply to Bruce Dawe
T> AGGED, waiting for birds to cross
the sky,
The Snipers crouched in ditches, scrub
and mud.
“Our guns will bring the spring,” the
Snipers cried,
“The spring can only come with bombs
and blood.”
And one cold dawn they heard the far-
off cry
Of spring, of flying geese and quail and
duck.
“Hurry and kill,” they said, “before
spring comes”
And rose up from the mud and threw
their bombs.
Spring stirred the paddy-fields and many
died.
And some of us, forlorn and foolish
tried
To stand against the Snipers when they
struck.
“But look, our guns have brought the
spring,” they cried.

WOULD SALARIES RUIN PARLIAMENT?
ffijiulLetCn
80 Years Ago: July 18, 1885
The result of payment of Members
of Parliament in New South
Wales would be precisely what it has
been in every other country where
payment has been tried. It would give

tural ones far removed from the

iem of non-payment what is the re-
suit? Is it not notorious lhat profes-
sional and business men in Sydney,
who are at no expense in attending
Parliament, sit for far-away elector-
ates with which they have little in
common and slender sympathy? And
there is worse behind. For these bar-
, t
r.sters, attorneys, and traders if they
draw no direct income from the pub-
lie, draw ten times the amount in-
directly in the way ot business. 1 he
amount of grist brought to their var-
ious mills by the M.L.A. after their
names is enormous. What wonder,
then, that these men bandy bald
platitudes by the hour against pay-
ment of members a measure which,
by supplying local candidates to dis-
tant constituencies, would rob them

BETWEEN CULTURAL EVOLUTION AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Our Man in Malaysia
The expulsion of Alex Josey
T'he Malaysian Government’s ex-
pulsion from Malaysia of The
Bulletin’s correspondent, Alex
Josey, is not only a humiliation of
a respected journalist and a slur on
The Bulletin, it is also a serious
threat to the freedom of the Press in
the Asian democracy with which Aus-
tralia is most closely associated for
whose integrity indeed it has been
fighting. It is a saddening confirma-
tion of Alex Josey’s statement in The
Bulletin of June 19 that “frank and
objective reporting from Malaysia is
LEE KUAN YEW
not being made easier by recent out-
bursts from the Government back-
benchers. In Parliament recently they
demanded that the Constitution be
reviewed regarding fundamental liber-
ties. They want a national newsageney
to be set up ‘because foreign cor-
respondents twist Malaysia’s image
abroad’. They want the Government
to declare Dennis Bloodworth of
The Observer’ (London) and myself
persona non grata”.
The Bulletin has a clear con-
science in this matter. It is pro-
Malaysian to a fault, it is as sympa-
thetic to the Tunku as to Lee Kuan
Yew, it recognises that on almost
every significant world question
Malaysia’s and Australia’s views are
identical. In the light of this we have
examined our past reports on Malaysia
and Alex Josey’s in particular, and
we know that all of them were written
and published in good faith. There
was, it is true, one regrettable sentence
about Malay traditions in one of Alex
Josey’s articles for which he apologised
unreservedly, but that is all. (See his
story on page 14.) His most recent
article in The Bulletin which led to
his expulsion was a balanced and
moderate report on Malaysia’s racial
tensions. Readers both in Australia
and Malaysia are urgec to turn back
to it on page 37 of the issue of June
19, 1965—and decide for themselves.
Yet it was this article that led to
the most violent polemics in the
Malay Press. The lawi language
“Utusan Melayu”, for example,
screamed “Lies! Lies!” and wrote: “A
number of leaders in Singapore wish
to ask what type of freedom does the
bearded journalist want. Is it the
freedom to write articles about one
race and describe them as pirates and
robbers while we ourselves do not
know about the background of his
own descent? We are not surprised,
said the leaders, that Alex Josey was
expelled bv the Burmese Government.
And it is not surprising that foreign
journalists are expelled bv a number
of governments in Africa and Asia.”
They demanded his expulsion and in
due course got what they wanted.
The Josey case is not an isolated
one. Last year there was a similar
demand for the expulsion of the
British journalist Dennis Bloodworth
of “The Observer”, London. He was,
as Alex Josey revealed for the first
time in his June article in The Bul-
letin, summoned from Singapore fo
Kuala Lumpur by the Acting Prime
Minister, Tun Abdul Razak the
Tunku was again overseas and
warned about his reporting. Blood-
worth then offered his resignation to
the Foreign Correspondents’ Associa-
tion which refused to accept it and
passed a vote of confidence in him.
The same association has rightly pro-
tested against Alex Josey’s expulsion
and described it as “a grave threat
to the profession in Malaysia”.
There are obviously special circum-
stances that must be taken into account
when discussing freedom in Malaysia.
The country is at war with Indonesia
and no country at war allows or ever
will allow complete freedom of the
Press to people who attempt to under-
mine the war effort. But by no stretch
of the imagination could Alex Josey’s
articles be said to undermine the war
effort; if they did The Bulletin
would not have published them. Again,
Malaysia has critical racial problems,
especially between the Malays and
the Chinese. But if Josey wanted
to foment racial war, why would he
TUNKU ABDUL RAHMAN
submit his articles to The Bulletin
which is read by only a small minority
in Malaysia and which again would
not publish articles of that kind?
Whatever Alex Josey’s offence
assuming for the sake of argument that
there was one—there would surely in
a democratic country like Malaysia be
a more sensible way of handling it
than by an expulsion in the manner of
dictatorships like Ghana or Indonesia.
The Josey case will stand as a warn-
ing to any foreign journalist in
Malaysia that he would be wise to
engage not in journalism but in public
relations for the Government. In the
end no one will believe any story that
comes out of Malaysia What does
Malaysia gain from that?


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE PRESS
My Expulsion from Malaysia
The inside story
LEE KUAN YEW CHAIRED BY HIS SUPPORTERS.
By ALEX JOSEY
On July 6 I received my two-week
notice to “leave Malaysia, and thereafter
remain out of Malaysia”. No reasons
were given, but the following day the
Government put out a statement which
said that my expulsion order was made
because “it was conducive to the good
of Malaysia”.
Next day, Tun Abel Razak, Acting
Prime Minister, said the Government
had given the matter careful thought.
In fact, he said, the Cabinet took time
to go into the question. When he was
asked if the Tunku had been consulted,
Tun Razak replied: “Well, it was the
Government's decision and ours is a
collective responsibility. That decision
stands.” There is no appeal.
I have lived in Malaysia 17 years. I
could have applied to become a Malay-
sian citizen. I have never pretended to
be anything other than a British
journalist. I have practised my profes-
sion for nearly 40 years. I am a founder
member and past president of the Singa-
pore Union of Journalists. I am a founder
member of the Foreign Correspondents’
Association of South-East Asia.
When Tun Razak was asked the
reasons for my expulsion he alleged that
i had “interfered” in the internal politics
of Malaysia whilst not being a citizen
of Malaysia. Tun Razak alleged I had
also indulged in activities which wefe
not conducive to the racial harmony of
the nation, and had repeatedly abused
the privilege I enjoyed in Malaysia as
a foreign correspondent.
The first time I knew about these
very serious allegations, which I deny,
was when I read them in “The Straits
Times”.
In a short statement I put out at the
request of the local Press, shortly after
I got the order to quit, I stated that
because of my long experience as a'
foreign correspondent in South-East Asia,
I had been employed in a part-time
capacity from time to time to assist
Singapore's Prime Minister in Press
relations when Mr Lee Kuan Yew travel-
led abroad in Europe, Asia, Africa, New
Zealand and Australia. The Central
Government knew this.
Now for the behind-the-scenes aspect
of the story. First, it is significant that
my instructions to leave the country
within a fortnight came while the Tunku
was away in London, ill. The quit-order
followed directly from a secret meeting
of Malay extremists in the house of
Inche Senu, leader of the militant Malay
Youth Movement. Balding Senu, no
youth, is Minister for Information and
Broadcasting. Dato Syed Jaafar Albar,
fanatic secretary-general of UMNO
(United Malays National Organisation),
was among those present. They passed
four resolutions.
One called upon Tun Razak, acting
Prime Minister, not to talk to Lee
Kuan Yew, Singapore’s Prime Minister.
Another demanded my immediate expul-
sion. This placed Tun Razak in a diffi-
cult predicament. He was under specific
orders from the Tunku to see Mr Lee
to try to ease the tension between
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Razak
had to decide whether to obey the Tunku,
the moderate, or Albar the extremist.
Tun Razak decided to compromise. They
probably taunted him, as the Malay
Press had done, that I had written in
The Bulletin that the freedom of the
Press would be all right in Malaysia, so
long as the Tunku was in charge.
Razak saw Lee, but he agreed to
order me out. Apparently unable, or
unwilling, to resist what is clearly mount-
ing pressure of the ultras, Tun Razak
began again to refer darkly to Malaysia’s
“enemies within”. He urged the Malay
Youth to stand firm, be calm, and await
instructions.
All this is history repeating itself. A
similar situation arose last year when
the Tunku was away. Albar then
demanded expulsion of Dennis Blood-
worth of “The Observer”, a veteran and
objective South - East Asia reporter.
Bloodworth lives in Singapore. He was,
as I wrote in The Bulletin last month,
summoned by Razak to Kuala Lumpur
and warned about his future reporting.
“Lies! Lies! Alex Josey Lies About the
Tun,” screamed “Utusan Melayu”. “Alex
Josey insults the Tun,” declared the Mini-
ster for Information and Broadcasting.
But Tun Razak never denied what I
said, because he knew it was true.
Albar decided to fix me when he read
my long profile of Lee Kuan Yew in
The Bulletin in 1963. In that article
I exposed Albar as an extremist and I
revealed what no reporter had printed,
that after the PAP defeated all UMNO’s
candidates in Singapore’s elections, Dato
Albar publicly burnt Lee's effigy at a
rally held in protest against the success
of the non-racial PAP, in democratically
Civil Rights...Waiting for Justice
“It is the Commonwealth’s view that
the minimum wages and conditions of
the Cattle Station Industry Northern
Territory Award should as a result of
these proceedings apply equally to
Aborigines as to other Australian
workers” this flat legal statement to
the Full Bench of the Conciliation and
Arbitration Commission in Sydney on
Friday by the Melbourne Queen’s Coun-
sel, Mr A. E. Woodward, could well be
decisive in the historic claim for equal
pay for Aborigines in the cattle industry.
When the hearing of a claim by the
North Australian Workers’ Union for
equal pay for Aborigines had opened
two days earlier there was little sign
of history being made. A band of 30
university students and Aborigines had
tried to inject drama into the occasion


weaning Malays away from their com-
munal organisation, of which Albar is
the boss. Albar branded these progres-
sive, urbanised Malays, traitors to their
race and religion.
UMNO demanded my expulsion then
on the grounds that I had insulted the
Malays when I wrote, in explaining the
difficulties of intermingling, that the
Malays had no culture comparable to
four thousands years of Chinese culture.
(Who has?) In passing, in four or five
words, I, perhaps foolishly, mentioned
the Malays’ history as pirates. Coming
from a race of pirates I thought no
harm: I certainly intended none. Sir
Francis Drake is still a hero to the
British.
At that time the Tunku was in
Kuala Lumpur and he was then strong
enough to contain the extremists in
spite of a month-long bitter Malay-
language Press campaign against me, in
which he, in the end, was included for
defending me. He would, when he saw
me, chuckle and greet me with, Hullo,
you old pirate . After the 1964 general
elections, to show that all was well, the
Tunku kindly invited me to play golt in
a competition he organised to celebrate
the return of the Alliance to power I
managed to get a couple of games with
T„n PavoL tUo coJl ThA
Tun Razak the same weekend. The
Tunku and I were photographed together.
So far as he was concerned the inci-
dent was over.
Now UMNO have revived it, following
their objection to the recent June article
rn The Bulletin in which I tried to give
both sides of the argument in Parliament.
That, of course was what UMNO did
not like. In the Malay Press, which is
controlled completely by UMNO lead-
ers, I was accused of being a tool of
Lee. I was accused of writing the article
in The Bulletin at his behest in order
deliberately to create racial disturbances.
They said that, by reporting what PAP
leaders said in Parliament, I purposely
aimed at provoking the Malays into
attacking non-Malays. Now The Bul-
letin is hardly the place to do that, if
that is what I wanted to do, which, of
course, I do not. Most Malays cannot
read English. Less than 1000 copies of
The Bulletin are sold in Malaysia.

While I was being told to get out, the
Tunku, in London was announcing that
he would be having talks with Lee Kuan
Yew when he returns to Malaysia. In
“The Straits Times” the Tunku was
quoted as saying he wanted to “smooth
things over once and for all .
Whether the Tunku will, in fact, be
allowed by UMNO to have talks with
Lee Kuan Yew is another matter. UMNO
is the basis of the Alliance Government,
and Dato Albar is the boss of UMNO
and is at the crest of his personal power,
He has a great deal of experience at mob
oratory. He came to Malaya thirty years
ago from the Celebes: he is of Arab
extraction. In Malaya he toured the
villages selling medicine. He became a
religious teacher. It was a short step

Central Government will never be pos-

Singapore.
This is an open challenge to the
Tunku’s leadership and his policy of
tolerance and moderation. As I see it,
if the Tunku resists the extremists and
is displaced, then Lee Kuan Yew’s posi-
tion in Singapore would become uncer-
tain. If Lee lost control of Singapore
(and he would if he lost the confidence
°f tbe Chinese to defend them), the
- Communist Pirfv MaUva’s
Malayan communist Party, Malaya s
oldest political organisation, oriented to
Red China, would move in.
If, on the other hand, the Tunku stands
firm, cleanses UMNO of the extremists,
reshuffles his Cabinet, he and Lee to-
gether could make Malaysia work. Aus-
tralia has a vested interest in the con-
tinuance of Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore,
No further-Left party would permit

with a demonstration in chilly Phillip
Street, outside the court. But the only
tension was that of the TV crews, des-
perately stage-managing placard bearers.
Inside, the Sydney solicitor, Mr A. T.
Brodney, appearing for the union,
quickly spelt out the significance of the
case. “The decision that we are asking
the Commission to make here is a basic
one for the Aborigines. It is the very
foundation of the whole of the Aboriginal
problem, and the variation which we
seek will provide a starting point, a
groundwork, upon which other proper
and urgently desirable activities can be
built.
Mr Brodney told the President of the
Bench, Sir Richard Kirby, the Deputy
President, Mr Justice Moore, and Senior
Commissioner, Mr J. E. Taylor, that in
one very real sense the case was not
about Aborigines. It was about “the
whites of Australia, and is now the
occasion for the white people in Aus-
tralia to stand up and be counted in a
significant matter”.
Specifically, the union was applying
for the deletion of the clause in the
award making Aborigines exempt from
its provisions, and to include domestics
almost without exception Aborigines
—in the award. Mr Brodney made it
clear that the union was against any
proposal for gradual introduction of
equal pay: a proposal whkh in fact was
put, but not spelt out, by Mr Woodward
for the Commonwealth, and which was
put and spelt out by Mr John Kerr, QC,
for the employers.
“We say as to being done, it should
be done now; and as to instalments, we
say no again, to be done at a single
prescription.” For Mr Brodney it was
a matter of a station owner employing
an Aborigine and paying him the pre-

scribed award rate. Anything else was
not only wrong in principle, but would
do nothing at all to help the Aborigines,
Mr Kerr, on the other hand, submitted
as his main case that, while the award
could be changed to make it clear that
any worker who “can and does”, the
work should be covered. Aborigines as
a group should remain outside the award.
Summarising the reasons, he said: “It
is in the public interest, and particularly
in the interests of the Aborigines, for
them not to be forced into a competitive
labor community.”
If the Commission was to reject his
main argument, as an alternative he
suggested that the award should include
minimum rates “fixed on a realistic
work-value basis for certain well-defined
categories of workers”.
Mr Woudward bound his statement of
principle that Aborigines should receive
full award coverage at equal rates wish
the proviso that they be “spaced” within
the period prescribed for the award
variation to operate”, which probably
would be over about five years.
It is on the issue of timing that Mr
Kerr, and, for that matter, Mr Brodney,
differs with the Commonwealth proposal,
During the hearing Mr Kerr made much
of “the peril” and threat to employment
of some 1500 to 1600 Aborigines directly
employed in the pastoral industry (“the
really major point at which the
Aboriginal people are at the present time
being assimilated”) that equal pay now
would bring. He painted a picture of
cattle stations as “quasi-settlements”.
In the course of drawing in this
picture, Mr Kerr showed the station
owners as the agents the only agents
in most of the Northern Territory—of
Government social service and education.
The Commission was told that there are
only 12 Government schools not to be
considered by normal standards, Mr
Kerr warned with 253 pupils.
“It may be a sad thing to contemplate,
but it is difficult for us at this end
of the table to see, in any of the planning
which now exists, any real hope for
people of 10, 12 or 13 years of age,
by the time the school system reaches
them, getting any real education that
would make a difference.”
Government settlements, Mr Kerr
claimed, were an unhappy alternative.
“The idea of going to a settlement is
faced most reluctantly by Aborigine’s on
station properties, first because they
are in their tribal country, and secondly
because they are living a life to which
they are adjusted. Going into a settle-
ment is a step back. Once it happens
and you get a handout for not working,
there is a tendency, so my instructions
indicate, for the person concerned to
go backwards. He is no longer a part
of society.”


ALP
Holt’s Quiet Campaign
Regaining the initiative
Labor Party forces opposed to the
ruling Victorian ALP junta are now in
the piquant situation of doing all possible
to see that the Victorians persist with
demands to regularise Unity Tickets at
next month’s Federal Conference in
Sydney.
The Victorian who is the focus of anti-
Unity Ticket forces in the State, former
ALP president Mr R. W. Holt, last week
was doing everything he could to see that
the ruling junta is not able to accom-
plish its plan to retreat on the issue.
However, more important than his
publicised exchanges with the Victorian
Executive is Mr Holt’s quiet campaign
in ALP branches to rally opposition.
The message is being carried of the
domination of the Executive by the
Trades Union Defence Committee.
It is being castigated for what it is
a secret, Communist - influenced cell
within the ALP, with a modus operandi
as powerfully manipulative as the now
ALP-hated industrial groups ever were.
But Mr Holt and his supporters arc
about a wider task than attacking the
TUDC. They hope to demonstrate to
Federal Executive meeting in Canberra
at the end of the month and later to
Federal Conference that they have the
forces in Victoria that are not only
capable of replacing the present junta
but are representative of Labor.
One group Mr Holt is staying well
clear of are the supporters of Senator
Kennelly’s call for a rapprochement with
the DLP. He is, as one Labor observer
said last week, “ready to deal on even
terms with the Jordan group at the
Trades Hall but he will not hear of any
kind of amity with the DLP or
Groupers”. If Mr Holt, himself a long-
time implacable opponent of the
Groupers, did deal with those who want
to see the return of the DLP to the
Labor fold there is no doubt that he
would antagonise all but NSW and Tas-
mania on the Executive and Conference.
There is little doubt that Mr Holt and
his supporters will formally lay com-
plaints either to the Federal Executive
or Conference or both about the Vic-
torian Executive. It is understood that
these complaints will be backed by new
disclosures about the ruling group.
After the first jubilation among the
moderates at the news of the Victorians’
intended climbdown, it has been recog-
nised by some that, as things now stand,
the Executive still maintains the initiative:
although it has forfeited hopes of a
major victory, it still has the advantage
of seeing the current ineffectual line on
Unity Tickets maintained.
If this does in fact pass unchallenged,
The Liberals and the IPEC Brush-off
From ALAN REID in Canberra
The Menzies Government can un-
doubtedly produce technical argu-
ments to justify its punitive use of a
Customs power to enforce a civil
aviation decision that IPEC, an Ade-
laide freight-carrying company, should
not enter the interstate air freight
business in opposition to Government-
owned TAA and privately-owned
Ansett-ANA. But whether it can
justify what it has done and is doing
on political and philosophical grounds
is less certain.
The reasons I have been given why
the Government refused IPEC per-
mission to import five DC-4 freight
aircraft for operation on interstate air
routes (after the High Court had
ordered the Commonw'ealth to issue
the company with an operating
licence) are:
1. The Government is committed to
a two-airline policy.
2. If IPEC were given its import
permit there would be a prolifer-
ation of airlines.
3. Another carrying company al-
ready has in an application
similar to IPEC’s to import
planes.
4. It is certain that at least one
more, probably two more, freight-
carrying companies would put
in applications if IPEC’s appli-
cation was successful.
5. Proliferation of airlines would
affect adversely airline econo-
mics and disturb the economic
stability of the whole Australian
internal airways industry.
6. Some of the new airlines would
not be able to survive in this
highly competitive and highly
capitalised industry.
7. Before they went to the wall they
would undoubtedly experiment
with austerity passenger flights
with seats unbooked, and a plane
leaving only when it has a full
load, as is done by some opera-
tors in the United States.
8. The Australian public has de-
monstrated that it does not want
this type of flight but wants fast,
comfortable, comparatively noise-
less transport in the most mo-
dern aircraft.
9. The Commonwealth probably
does not have the power to pre-
vent companies operating auste-
rity passenger services, if they
have the planes to carry through
the operation and meet Com-
monwealth safety requirements
as laid down by the Civil Avia-
tion Department.
10. The Government would not be
able to prevent a decline in Aus-
tralian air travel standards,
though it would continue to have
the almost unlimited powers it
now has to enforce air safety
measures.
However good these arguments are
technically they do not hold water
politically or philosophically, as I see
them. The Menzies Government’s
two-airlines policy was evolved to
maintain competition. But now the
Government is invoking this policy to
restrict competition.
Some of the other Government ar-
guments seem to me to have also
been thought through hastily and in-
completely. What if there is a pro-
liferation of airlines and some of them
go to the wall? The High Court has
ruled they are entitled to licences to
operate interstate air freight services.
If they can raise the money to get
the planes and it does not seriously
damage Australia’s overseas funds
position (and there has been no sug-
gestion that this is at the back of the
veto on IPEC), why should private
companies not be entitled to chance
their arms in the private enterprise
sector of civil aviation and go broke
if their judgment proves mistaken?
If they want to fly irregular
austerity passenger flights similar to
those in the United States, is that
really damaging to anyone but them-
selves?
Surely it is better for the public to
decide, after trial, that it will not travel
on cheaper unscheduled flights than
for Government to tell it arbitrarily,
and perhaps mistakenly, that it does
not want to travel on them.

the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,
Mr Whitlam’s, recent proclamation at
Newcastle “that the relationship between
the unions and the ALP is by far the
most important issue facing the ALP
today” will be as so much tinkling brass,
The likelihood of this issue indeed being
confronted if the Victorians press on
with the Unity Ticket motion was the
best possible justification for a meeting
between NSW Communist officials and
members of the TUDC, reported to have
taken place in Melbourne last Tuesday
week.
The Communists, who first sensed
real trouble when they heard that the
Victorians were taking the extreme step
of dropping Mr Holt from his place as
president on the officers’ ticket at the
last conference, are believed to have told
the TUDC that they were inviting the
reinvolvement of the ALP in union
affairs by the Unity Ticket move, and
urged them to drop it.
TEACHERS
Chalking Up
Softer line for Mr Bolte
Despite attempts to join the two main
teachers’ organisations for action against
the Teachers’ Tribunal, the Victorian
Teachers’ Union and the Secondary
Teachers’ Association are driving in
completely different directions.
The VTU, with its majority of primary
teachers and a very rebellious minority
of high and technical school teachers,
is sticking solely to having the recent
award reheard. The VSTA is deter-
mined to reform the tribunal itself, and
has promised another stopwork meeting
if the Government refuses to give some
ground.
Before the VTU had a chance to carry
out its mild threat to ballot its members
on a stoppage, the Teachers’ Tribunal
agreed to hear more submissions. The
tribunal, however, restricted new sub-
missions to any “anomalies” between the
Victorian award and NSW scales.
On the same day that the tribunal
yielded, the VSTA conferred with the
Minister for Education, Mr J. Bloomfield,
on reform of the tribunal. The official
release from the meeting was non-com-
mittal, but it seemed possible that some
negotiations might be made so long as
the Government moved reasonably
quickly. Unless the Government makes
some offer this week, there will be another
stoppage.
Unrest has never been so widespread
in Victorian schools as it is now. If it
spreads to the usually uninformed elector-
ate, Mr Bolte may have to take a softer
and franker line on education.


TRADE
Reversed
Scissors
Imports’ fantastic height
Record imports in the last two months
have failed to shake the Government’s
guarded faith on balance of payments
and reserves prospects. In Trade Mini-
ster Mr J. McEwen’s view r reserves are
there to be used without import re-
strictions.
Last year’s imports bill topped the
fantastic height of £1451 million or
£268 million more than the previous
year’s record, not yet fully reflecting
the downswing in export prices nor
drought-affected export volume. Exports
held up very well over the year to bring
in £1317.8 million, only £63.4 million
down on 1963-64*s £1381.2 million.
The reversed scissors movement in
overseas trade left an adverse visible
balance of £133.2 million for the year, a
net deterioration of £330.5 million on
the previous year’s favorable visible
balance of £197.3 million. When net in-
visible imports, which will probably be
not less than £225 million (excluding
net undistributed income) are brought in,
the true current account deficit for the
year should be nearly £350 million,
which was the estimate one gave in
April.
In face of this huge deficit we can con-
sider ourselves fortunate that overseas
reserves fell by only £156 million from
their year-end record of £854.1 million
on June 30, 1964. Looked at rather
hopefully, this could mean that capital
inflow came to the rescue to the tune of
about £2OO million during the year. But
we will have to wait some months for
confirmation, which, at this level,
would give a capital inflow' result about
the same as in the previous year. The
big question is the likelihood of a fall
in capital inflow this year the signs
are ominous—in the face of a fall in ex-
ports and exceptionally high imports.
On the score of capital inflow, we
should be cautious in interpreting the
fact that reserves actually increased in
June despite the £18.2 million visible
trade gap, and what must have been a
very stiff bill for transportation and in-
surance outgoings on the massive im-
ports for the month. On the surface, it
would seem that capital inflow' increased
substantially in June and achieved its
highest level for the year in the June
quarter. However, estimates of net ap-
parent capital inflow can be deceptive
because in these circumstances payment
for a substantial quantity of imports
could well have been deferred in the
last two months. When made it could
take a belated toll on reserves.

“Tribune” and Vietnam
The “enemy” troops
This map, published in the July 7 issue
of the Sydney Communist weekly
“Tribune”, in which the area marked
black where Australian troops are serving
in Vietnam is classified as “enemy-
occupied” territory, would bring immedi-
ate action if the DLP’s Senator Frank
McManus had his way.
At a meeting in the Morwell RSL Hall,
organised by the Committee for the
Defence of Australia, Senator McManus
last week told an audience of 600 that
Australia was, in effect, at war. A state
of emergency should be declared so that
plans to frustrate Australia’s efforts to
defend South Vietnam could be dealt
with. He listed the Youth for Peace,
and the Save Our Sons movements, and
the Union of Australian Women as Com-
munist front groups active in trying to
prevent Australia from facing its
responsibility in South-East Asia.
Other speakers at the meeting were
Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes and Mr Owen
Harries of the University of Sydney. Mr
Harries was critical of university teachers
who talked “semi-sophisticated academic
clap-trap” about South-East Asia. He
pointed out the absurdity of the position
of those educated Australians who
applauded the views of Walter Lipp-
mann, whose basic proposition was that
America should get out of Asia and leave
it defenceless. He also made a strong
attack on the statements of Professor
May, of Sydney University, and Dr
J. F. Cairns: the latter was “very selec-
tive in his use of the American White
Paper on Vietnam”, quoting only a small
section which suited his preconceived
attitudes and ignoring the rest.
Mr Alec Robertson, a member of the
“Tribune” editorial committee, later in
a statement to The Bulletin said the
legend and the wording at the side of
the map of South Vietnam in the July
7 issue were included in error,
Mr Robertson said the contents of
the map—showing the greater part of
South Vietnam occupied by the National
Liberation Front and only a small frac-
tion controlled by the United States
forces—were “unquestionably correct”.
“However, the legend with its refer-
ence to ‘enemy-occupied areas’ does not
represent ‘Tribune’s’ view but the view
of the authors of the map.”
He did not say who the authors were.

Western Australia’s crayfishing indus-
try depends for its profitability on the
full utilisation of its equipment during
the fishing season and freedom from
maintenance in any season. Its boats
need to be free from corrosion. That's
why Engineer and Marine Services
Pty. Ltd. used high-strength aluminium
marine alloys in building the “Lady of
Fatima” for De Sousa & Company.
Of all-welded aluminium construc-
tion, “Lady of Fatima” has been
champion boat on both fish and cray-
fish every year since 1959. The boat is
a self-contained unit and crayfish and
prawns are caught, processed, flash-
frozen and packaged on board. Alu-
minium ensures essential cleanliness,
because there's no rust to stain goods
or equipment. Draught is reduced and
docking is easier. Maintenance costs
are slashed.
Of course, there’s more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco's years of
experience in research, testing, design
and improved alloys . . . years of prac-
tical application which can be summed
up in two words: know-how. So, when
you add technical skill and expertise
to aluminium's inherent qualities,
achievement is the natural result.
Australuco's engineers and techni-
cians, backed by the world - wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium in all phases
of Australian industry.

PUBLIC SERVICE
Shaking the Group
Money and friction
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
The Commonwealth Public Service
Arbitrator, Mr E. A. Chambers, late Jast
week averted likely regulation strikes in
key segments of the Public Service.
Mr Chambers decided in Melbourne
to hear 30 work-value claims 1 from eight
Public Service unions in groupings
the first 18 of the claims (13 from the
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association and five related claims from
the Federated Clerks’’ Union) on August
10.
The Arbitrator rejected views put to
him at a statutory conference in Mel-
bourne two weeks ago; one from the
Public Service Board suggesting the
claims be heard jointly, and the other
from one of the eight unions asking for
separate hearings.
Suggestions of regulation strikes, which
effectively cripple a department, came
particularly from Taxation. At a general
meeting in Sydney two months ago
Taxation officers suggested the union
order a regulation strike. Had Mr
Chambers decided to hear the claims
jointly, a regulation strike might have
taken place.
The Public Service Board has been
pressing joint hearings of the claims with
a view to an all-up assessment of the
Third, and, overall, perhaps the most
important of the four-tier service. The
board has told the Arbitrator that if the
claims were heard jointly about 2000
officers would get increases by amalga-
mating salary ranges as part of the re-
organisation of the Third Division.
“This,” said the acting Federal sec-
retary of the ACOA, Mr Stan Imer, “was
pure blackmail, and we weren’t interested.
The board has a statutory responsibility
to organise the structure of the service
in an efficient way. If it feels the changes
it proposes are justified it should have
introduced them, regardless.”
These moves are the latest and most
crucial phase in Mr Wheeler’s reform of
the entire structure of the 171,000-strong
Commonwealth Public Service. Mr
Wheeler embarked on this reform soon
after he became chairman of the Public
Service Board in 1961. However, Public
Service unions have long been suspicious
of moves for reform. When Mr Wheeler
formulated his campaign within six
months of coming to his board post from
the position of treasurer to the Inter-
national Labor Organisation in Geneva,
he did so with the knowledge that in the
mid-’fifties the board had been forced to
shelve plans for a review of positions
currently occupied by 42,000 public
servants in the Third Division.
Last week’s claims, which flow directly
from the engineers’ case determined as
long ago as 1961, and which had wide-
spread effects on public service wages,
are bolstered both by traditional sus-
picion and fresh friction between the
board and increasingly activist Public
Service unions.
A major point of issue between the
Public Service Board and the unions is
that the board is using arbitration, not
for its wage-fixing purpose, but as the
agent of the structural reform Mr
Wheeler envisages.
“When we attempted to negotiate with
the board directly for salary increases
in June for the whole of the admini-
strative and clerical structure, the board
refused to negotiate,” Mr Imer told
The Bulletin last week. “The board
defended the current salaries as being
correct. By contrast, this seems to suggest
that there is some need to review the
whole salary structure. The board
obviously wants the Arbitrator to white-
wash it. They’re using a tactical device
to avoid facing up to work value claims
which my association feels are inade-
quate.”
PARLIAMENTARY SALARIES
To the Tribunal
A questionnaire for Queensland
members
The first step of a three-man indepen-
dent tribunal into Queensland Parlia-
mentary salaries came late last week
when it asked parliamentarians what
salary they considered they deserved.
The tribunal also asked, in a 19-point
questionnaire sent to Queensland’s 78
parliamentarians, whether they believed
their salaries should be lifted automatic-
ally as the economy improved. Last
week the committee met twice and
decided that details of the questionnaire
be not released to the Press. However,
a copy of the questionnaire studied by
The Bulletin contained three sections —
one each on salaries, allowances, and
evidence.
In the evidence section, politicians
were asked if they wanted to give evi-
dence before the tribunal in public,
camera, or partly in camera. Another
question asked if politicians wanted to
give evidence on August 2,3, 4, 10
or another date. This means that the
committee plans to start hearing evidence
next month.
One very interesting question in the
list of 19 asked State politicians if they
felt an “adequate” salary would encour-
age “suitable” people to enter politics.
The salary tribunal is expected to
advertise soon asking people who wish
to give evidence to write to the com-
mittee. Last week the tribunal decided
that the hearings would be open to the
public and the Press. That is, unless a
politician wanted to give his evidence
in private. <

SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Walsh’s Corner
One gerrymander for another?
The new Labor broom in South Aus-
tralia is rapidly sweeping itself into a
corner. The Government has introduced
legislation for long-awaited electoral re-
form, but its proposals could effectively
replace the Playford gerrymander with
the Walsh gerrymander.
The Government is seeking to increase
membership in the House of Assembly
from 39 to 56, while keeping country
representation at its present level. For
the Upper House, it wants electoral re-
distribution based on that for the Lower
House, with all Assembly voters enrolled
for the Legislative Council. To over-
come deadlocks between the Upper and
Lower Houses, the Government’s Bill
provides that where the Assembly insists
on a Bill in two successive sessions with
a space of 12 months between each
passing, it may be presented to the
Governor and become law without being
referred to the Legislative Council. The
Labor Party regards the measures for
the Upper House as a step to its eventual
abolition.
NEW ZEALAND
Up in the Air
Buying F-III's?
The New Zealand Government has
rebuked its air chief —Air Vice-Marshal
J. G. Morrison—for advocating the buy-
ing of 18 American F-III aircraft for
the RNZAF.
The annoyance was not against the
buying of American aircraft, but be-
cause the Air Vice-Marshal spoke out.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Jack
Marshall, said the air chief’s comments
were “premature and unhelpful and
shouldn’t be discussed in public”. He
made it clear that such ideas should be
made to the new Ministry of Defence.
However, New Zealand’s Vice-Ad-
miral, Sir Peter Phipps, who is about to
retire, found himself in a position to com-
ment: “I think it improper for any servant
of the State to try to influence Govern-
ment decisions this way,” he said, and
then proceeded to give his ideas on how
New Zealand defences should shape.
Air Vice-Marshal Morrison’s state-
ment came after a visit to Europe and
the US and, viewing his line-up of ageing
and obsolescent aircraft which are NZ’s
defences, apparently decided it was worth
risking political ire to get action.

The Pucka Recruits
Training for that fox-hole
By SAM LIPSKI
According to a widely cherished and
rarely challenged piece of Army
lore the Regimental Sergeant
Major, apart from being omni-
scient, omnipotent, and übiquitous, is
also a tough bastard with a heart of gold.
Lack of long acquaintance makes it im-
possible to pass judgment either way on
Warrant Officer (Class 1) Wood, RSM of
the Second Recruit Training Battalion at
Puckapunyal. But on day 1 of week 2
(the training week begins on Thursday)
RSM Wood clicked his pace-stick shut
and spoke realistically about the new
national service:
“Now this is deadly serious. If I get
a bloke here and he isn’t taught correctly,
do you know what will happen? If he
ends up in Vietnam or Borneo or some-
where, he won't last a day. He'll get it
for sure. Now, I mean that. If my son
was going off to war, do you know what
I would do if I wanted to get an idea
about his chances of coming back alive?
I’d take a look at his NCO. I’d speak to
him and I tell you what I’d have a
fair idea.”
Discussing my impressions of the
NCOs I had seen in action during the
previous three days, I mentioned that re-
cruits had told me how generally pleased
they were with their instructors with
one exception. That one used streams
of obscene language to insult slow-learn-
ing recruits, he constantly expressed de-
light at the prospect of punishing every-
body with extra duty, and treated them
as “naughty children”. Before I had
finished RSM Wood smiled and reached
for his notebook. “Yes, I know exactly
who you mean. I’ve got his name and
I’m checking on him. If the reports are
true, then this fellow will be out of here
so fast he won’t know what struck him
and minus his stripes. We’ve got no
room for blokes like that.” For a mo-
ment I was nonplussed. A corporal, as
most trainees who served in the old
national service scheme recall, was by
definition a mindless soldier who shouted
pointless obscenities, insulted trainees
and often took delight in punishing them.
And in a way we did not begrudge him
this one pleasure. By the time the system
had been going for a few years the Re-
gular Army NCOs had become cynical,
and completely worn out. With rare
exceptions they hated their work and
they hated the “Nashos”. The hate had
a twofold effect. Either they became
“little Hitlers” or they went along with
every “lurk” instead of training they
would spend the morning sitting under
the trees away from the camp on the
other side of the hill, for as long as we
trainees, equally cynical, kept them sup-
plied with cigarettes. The possibility that
in the new national service scheme
someone will be demoted or transferred
for what was fairly widespread and ac-
cepted behavior under the old scheme
is the starkest way of explaining the
real difference between them. The rela-
tionship between the instructor and his
men, between the Regular Army and the
recruits —this will determine the use-
fulness of the scheme.
The reason for the change in outlook
is not hard to find. It is not that the
present RDI (Regimental Duties Instruc-
tor) is a new brand of soldier, in many
ways he is very much the same but
that he is operating in a quite different
set of circumstances. First, there is the
bald fact that the Australian Army is
at war on two fronts. You become quick-
ly aware of it at Puckapunyal.
The Commanding Officer of 2RTB,
Lieutenant Colonel W. D. Jamieson wel-
comes recruits by telling them that with-
in 12 months they might be “sharing a
fox-hole in Vietnam”. A fumbling re-
cruit is told: “Watch it, soldier. Don’t
hold your rifle like that; you’ll lose your
toe and deprive the Vietcong of the
pleasure!” An officer reading the morn-
ing paper remarks, “I see we’ll be send-
ing more troops to Vietnam. After all,
Dr Forbes has said it’s highly unlikely
that we will be”.
The instructors, officers and other
ranks alike, are therefore more than
happy to train recruits for an already
over-taxed Army hungry for manpower.
And finally, there is the noticeable
uplift in morale which national service
has meant for the Army. Until very
recently morale was low, in some cases
dangerously so. The failure of the earlier
national service and the pitifully run-
down condition of weapons and equip-
ment left many regulars bitter and
frustrated about pay, about condi-
tions, about the shortage of men, and
above all, at the seeming lack of concern
by Government. Now the Army is big
news, money is being spent not
enough according to many Army men —
and whatever is being spent on national
service is creating a chain reaction right
through the Army.
Whatever the reasons for the change
in attitude by Regular Army personnel
towards recruits, the reasons for the
change in the attitude and type of
recruits seems less clear. To see a cor-


poral going out of his way to explain a
lesson to a recruit, patiently and with-
out viciousness, may at first seem like
a minor revelation but there are some
obvious explanations. But how do you
explain the almost complete lack of
serious resentment on the part of recruits?
After all, they were chosen by lottery,
they do have to give up two years of
their careers, and within 12 months they
may have to be prepared to give up their
lives on the face of it an awesome
prospect at the age of 20.
Yet, surprisingly few of the recruits
have expressed anything negative about
the Army at all. Both officers and NCOs
expected resentment and are somewhat
taken aback that they have hardly come
across it. One company commander said
that out of some 320 men in the com-
pany only one had protested. “We’re
being trained as cannon fodder,” he had
told officers. NCOs have spoken with
some wonder about the willingness of
recruits to learn to accept discipline, and
to work hard. After a week there had
not been one charge in a battalion of
1350 men. It seemed too good to be
true.
But in speaking to a dozen recruits
this general acceptance of their position
seemed to be the rule. One recruit, who
had worked as a waterside worker for
a month before being called up, com-
plained about the loss in wages it would
mean for him, the fact that he was con-
scripted (“I reckon you should only fight
if you want to”) and the fact that he
might have to go to Vietnam (“I’d be
willing to fight in Malaya but not up
there”). The Army chaplains have come
across only isolated cases of homesick-
ness and have also been struck by the
willingness and enthusiasm of the trainees.
Speculation on this point among
senior officers centred on the theory
that the general public had been ahead
of the Government in favoring the call-
up. Some pointed to the Gallup Poll
findings which indicated a majority of
young people in favor of the scheme.
This, they believed, came from a youth
made more aware of current affairs and
Australia’s weak defences by the mass
media, especially television. Few were
prepared to speculate on the possibility
that this willingness to accept possibly
had something to do with the nature of
the first intake. Coming from all States
except Queensland, the recruits include
a disproportionately high number of
white-collar workers, especially bank and
insurance company clerks. Too ready to
accept the “company policy”? It will be
interesting to compare the general reac-
tions of future intakes which will
include large numbers of university stu-
dents, technical school students, and
apprentices, all temporarily exempted.
Apart from the high number of bank
and insurance clerks (this is the conclu-
sion of officers who have made only
tentative inspection of the figures; there
is no exact breakdown as yet) there are
some other unusual features about the
recruit battalion which would make it an
ideal and ready-made social laboratory.
All recruits, of course, are 20. None
remembers the Second World War; they
were nine when the Korean war ended.
Some 50 per cent are expected to have
reached the Intermediate Certificate or
its equivalent, a figure somewhat higher
than that in a regular Army intake.
If the figures for the general popula-
tion hold true, one in every four recruits
was born outside Australia.
While they can be proud of their
physical fitness, considering the high
rejection rate, they have little to boast
about when it comes to teeth. According
to Army dentists, only 10 per cent were
dentally fit meaning that they
required no extractions or fillings. The
other 90 per cent required 4640 fillings
and 1086 extractions figures which
seem to confirm the dental profession’s
poor opinion of Australian teeth care.
As a group these first recruits look taller
and heavier than their national service
counterparts of a decade ago. Certainly,
they march far better in their first week
than at least one “nasho” battalion I
recall. (“Nasho” is a taboo word at
Puckapunyal now, as is “conscript”.
“Recruit” is preferred.)
“Nashos” no more
Training, both in the content and
approach has, understandably, changed.
But basic training is basic training. So,
although a 12-week course is being
taught in 10 weeks and some wasteful
periods are probably eliminated, the aim
of those first weeks remains the same.
Whichever way it is expressed, it is to
make a large number of civilians with
varying backgrounds and expectations
conform to the discipline of a total
institution. To do this, the Army
naturally teaches drill, and imposes its
strict routine from morning to night.
Again, the parade grounds echo to the
Gregorian chanting of platoons drilling
alongside each other inevitably by
numbers. Again, the corporals of today
unconsciously repeat the self-same
cadences of their instructors who in-
herited them in turn from theirs, and so
it goes.
The .303 is missing, replaced by the
SLR (the Australian version of the FLN);
the khaki web belt and gaiters are now
black, and minus brass; the clothing issue
is jungle green rather than khaki for
everyday wear, and the shirts seem to
fit better. But the underpants which seem
to have been first made up for the Sudan
Expeditionary Force and which surely
even they must have marvelled at,
remain.
Perhaps the most marked change from
the old programme is the new emphasis
on “Character Guidance” to which more
than 20 periods will be devoted. They
will include discussions about Christi-
anity, sex, and science and religion.
Explaining the need for such an ap-
proach, Father McKeown told recruits
that since the Korean experience the
Western armies had been shaken by the
knowledge that only one-third of their
prisoners had been able to withstand the
Communist brainwashing and imprison-
ment without breaking either physically
or mentally. The third who had come
through intact were usually those with
strong religious beliefs. Thus, the Army
is encouraging the work of padres in a
way it never has before. The lectures
are compulsory, as are some church
parades during the week. But those who
have objections can obtain exemption by
seeing their commanding officer privately.
This is an advance on the old National
Service Church Parades, where one of
our corporals became known for his
breadth of vision, “Righto, C of Es on
the right, RCs in the middle, PDs on
the left and all you agnostic bludgers
what don’t believe in God can pick up
papers.”
Privately, some officers have expressed
their doubts as to whether the character
guidance lectures provide the right way
to prepare soldiers to face an ideo-
logical enemy. They believe the time
could be better spent with recruits learn-
ing more about Asia, about the Chinese
and other Asian brands of revolutionary
Communism, and about the nature of
brainwashing techniques.
The changes in the physical appearance
of Puckapunyal and the physical sur-
roundings for recruits have been widely
reported. True, a large £2-million build-
ing project is under way, “rehabilitated”
huts have replaced the old ones, the mat-
tresses are foam-rubber, there are wash-
ing machines and drying rooms, stain-
less steel kitchens and a large bar, cafes
and ice-cream slot-machines.
All this needs two comments. First,
because so much of the expansion was
done in a hurry the first intake (and pro-
bably the second) will have to suffer the
irritations resulting from a crash pro-
gramme—mud in the new huts because it
lies yellow and slushy on all the roads,
problems with catering for some 2000
personnel, and the pressure on military
equipment and facilities generally. (Thus
some of the SLR rifles issued to recruits
had to be checked last week because of
faults in the barrels.)
Secondly, the understandable public
interest in the physical conditions of the
recruits should not allow anyone to forget
the physical conditions of the men on
whom the success or failure of the first
10 weeks of basic training really depends
the corporals who act as instructors.


So He Went Up To
See Her Sometime
Mae West in a courtesan’s dream of pure white
From CHARLES HIGHAM in Hollywood
The Ravenswood stands four-square
on North Rossmore in Hollywood,
a massive apartment building sur-
rounded by leafy, smog-dusted streets.
Mae West is said to have bought it when
she first moved to Hollywood in the early
’thirties; the biddies already in occupancy
protested at her presence there, so she
upped and obtained the building, turning
them out in the process. But a few had,
apparently, been allowed to return. Go-
ing up in the lilt, I saw an elderly spinster
peer accusingly at the copy of Mae West s
autobiography I carried in my hand.
Can she write at all? the woman said.
She can indeed.
The door of Apartment 611 was open-
ed by Paul Novak, former Mr California,
a sad-faced man with shoulders like
bullock-yokes and a surprisingly light,
soft, educated voice. He had once been
in a stage show “Mae West and her
Adonises” and for years had been her
devoted companion, protecting her from
the occasional Fan Who Remembered,
the Watusi generation who wanted to
convince themselves she was still alive,
and since a “Show” magazine article
she was said to have bitterly disliked
the Press.
- As I stepped into the hall, I saw a
coat of arms with the initials MW
woven into the cloth, and the words
“This is My Life”; to the right was the
living-room, a courtesan’s dream of pure
white: white settees and chairs, white
carpets, a white piano, white frilly lamp-
shades. Behind me I could see a blonde
head turning, slowly, in one of the
hall mirrors; the star was doing a last-
minute rehearsal.
Then, on Mr Novak’s arm, coughing
discreetly, she came in. She wore a brown
lace an( j w hjt e negligee sweeping
the fl oor behind her in a kind of train,
Her h a j r was pj[ ec j U p on ber head like
an 18th-century wig, curls falling around
her earS- She wore strange, dark blue
spectacles in white frames, each lens
punctured all over with innumerable tiny
holes through which the eyes could not
be seen. Her cheeks were astonishingly
fresh and youthful. Only the vertical
lines running up from the mouth, the
cross-stitching on the chin, disclosed her
age (she was born in 1893). And yet it
was, at first, hard to recognise her; it
was several minutes before I became
wholly convinced I wasn’t talking to an
impersonator, or perhaps to an automa-
ton rigged up with false hair, wax
flesh, and a clockwork mechanism pump-
in© inside the chest . . .
She began by talking about her one,
lifelong obsession: of all things, to con-
quer the might of a lion. “Ever since I’d
first seen one as a child I’d wanted to
command one,” she said. “When I’d go
on tour I’d see the mayor, then I’d head
for the local zoo. When I made ‘l’m No
Angel’ there was a scene in which a lady
lion-tamer conquers the beasts in a
cage. They wanted to use a stand-in. I
said, ‘l’ll do it’. They wouldn’t let me
but I insisted. The designer did up a
long ermine military cape that covered
me all over. But just as I was about to
step into the cage something made me
take off the cape. I realised afterward
that if I’d worn the cape into the cage
the lions would have mistaken me for
some kind of an animal and torn me to
pieces . . .
“When I stepped into the cage I could
see the lions’ beautiful eyes turning up-
ward to the plume in my cap. It fascinat-
ed them. Then I cracked the whip. O!
I tell you I never felt such a thrill! I
felt such a wave of power, dear, that
I can’t even describe it . . . the beasts
began their act . . .
“I didn’t find out until afterwards that
the studio had had men with guns post-
ed all round the cage during the scene
in case one of them made a move
toward me ...”
She had begun, she said, as a play-
wright, on her mother’s suggestion, after
she had started successfully writing gags.
“One day I was riding along 10th Avenue
near the Hudson waterfront when I saw
this woman coming by with a sailor,
wearing a shabby black tight-fitting dress.
But she was wearing the most beautiful
hat of bird of paradise feathers on her
head. And then I thought of the story
. . . how a girl ensnared a sailor who
bought her a beautiful bird of paradise
hat ...”
She wrote the play on old envelopes,
scraps of paper, in pencil, and took it
to a famous director of the time, Edward
Eisner, who had directed great stars like
Julia Marlowe and Maxine Elliott on
the stage. She read him the play because
he had left his glasses at home. She said:
“And at the end he cries out, ‘By God!
You’ve done it! This is it! And you! I’ve
directed the greatest! But you! You’ve
got something a quality I’ve never
seen in any other actress! You’ve got so
much sex there!’ And 1 says, ‘Where?’
And he says, ‘All over you!’ And he
says, ‘What shall we call the play?’ And
I says, ‘SEX!’ And he says, ‘By God, if
only we dare! What a title!’ And I goes
to the backer and I says, ‘l’ve got this
show and I’m calling it “SEX’7 And he
says the same thing as Eisner. And we
go ahead. And the posters go up every-
where! SEX! SEX! In big letters, all over
New York! But the newspapers wouldn’t
advertise it!
“They said they’d use it if we put
other words with it, like ‘The Fair Sex’,

or ‘The Opposite Sex’. But not ‘SEX’.
Oh no, dear ...”
Next she had written her homosexual
play, “The Drag”. “I’ve just written it up
as a novel,” she said. “There’s this
handsome guy who’s the son of a judge.
And there’s this good-lookin’ girl whose
father is a famous doctor . . .
“The family wants to arrange a mar-
riage, to link the two families. But this
judge’s son associates with a lot of those
kind of people, if you understand my
meanin’ . . . then another man comes
into the picture, an architect working on
an estate . . . and this husband goes for
the architect guy . . .
“O I tell you it’s so subtle! So clever!
And at the end there’s such a tragedy, a
murder ...01 won’t spoil the novel for
you, I have it typed up in there with
one carbon and it’s goin’ to the publisher
soon . . . it’s so thrillin’, dear . . .
“I played it out in New Jersey ... I
hired a little hotel where the gay boys
could come and have fun . . . they could
dress up just as they pleased ... in drag
. . . I’ve always felt people do as they
want, sex-wise . . .
“The audience would go out of the
theatre with sympathy for those kind of
people . . . and as they’d go out they’d
even act that way . . . bank presidents!
Businessmen! But I tell you the play
never reached Broadway . . . they were
afraid of it, dear'. . .”
She said she had begun writing her
own scripts when she came to Holly-
wood because the censors would have
threatened her if she hadn’t introduced
her special brand of humor into the
writing. “They’d run my pictures through
the projector at the studio and they’d
say, ‘My God! That has to go!’ So I’d put
in w6rse lines for them to cut! Then
they’d leave the not-so-bad ones in!”
She said that the studio on one occa-
sion had tried to do its own script for
one of her pictures, “Every Day’s a Holi-
day”. But after six months the writer
had failed to come up with a suitable
screenplay. Then she had heard the
composer for the film playing a minor
number on the piano, “Mademoiselle
Fifi”. Immediately she had felt “the
forces” spiritual powers just above
her head dictating the story of the
picture, about a character called Fifi.
She rattled the outline off to the studio
bosses in 12 minutes. “A girl came in
to take down the whole scenario. But I
had to ask her to put her note book
under the table, it would have interrupt-
ed the forces if I had seen her writing
. . . I dictated it in 45 minutes . . .
“You know, I’ve followed spiritualism
for years . . . there’s this man Kelly . . .
he’s lived at my beach house I’m just
having new marble flooring put in —■
and he’s given readings for 60 people
... he saw Pearl Harbor before it hap-
pened and he told Carol Channing years
ago she’d have a hit in a show with the
word ‘Dolly’ in the title . . .
“He’s taught me so much . . . you
know, this head of yours —” she pointed
at her own “is just a television set
or a radio receiver . . . my ideas for my
pictures would just come into it out of
the air . . . when you die you come out
of your head as a glorified body . . .
you think you’re in New York or Lon-
don and you’re there, dear . . . just there
in as long as it takes you to think about
it . . .
“You know, Kelly taught me so much
. . . how to receive the psychic power by
making your mind a blank , . . now
that’s hard enough to do for a minute
. . . but for hours ... I didn’t know I
was a psychic but Kelly has developed
my powers ...”
She noticed I was glancing at the por-
trait behind her, a picture of herself,
nude, sprawled down on the side of a
bed . . . “The picture was done by
Gladys Henzel,” she said. “And that
nude statue over there by Gladys Lewis
Bush ...” Her face, warmly alive and
radiating an electric charm and kindness
that, all through the conversation, had
been deeply moving and disturbing,
glowed at the things success had bought
her. She took me in the next room, where
her famous bed, photographed on the
cover of her book, stood white and flank-
ed with mirrors, the initials “MW” at
the top of the great canopy. “I have a
comeback in mind,” she said. “Mr
George Cukor oh you know him?
He’s a wonderful man is planning a
story about spiritualism with me in the
leading role of a medium . . . goodbye
dear ...” And Mr Novak, with a sad
smile, showed me out.


AROUND MELBOURNE
Pushing Through Solid Mink
Opera - from Peche Melba to La Stupenda cocktail
/Comparisons may be odious but it
was downright irresistible to com-
pare the return of Joan Sutherland
with the return of Nellie Melba. The
pattern was so much the same. Joan
Sutherland came home after 14 years.
Nellie Melba returned after 16.
There were many similarities. In
1902 money was scarce, there was
an appalling drought. Madame Melba
herself expressed her shock at the
view from the train of dead cattle
and sheep.
There was similar horror 63 years
ago at the price of tickets. At the
Town Hall on September 27, 1902,
tickets were 55., 10s. 6d., 215., 30s.
and 455. Overall average was 20s.
“The Argus” printed columns of
classified ads put in by the scalpers
and others pleading for tickets. For
five concerts in Melbourne and four
in Sydney Madame Melba received
£21,000. Seeing that a working wage
in 1902 was 255. to 30s. it’s an in-
teresting exercise to work out the
value of that money today.
Seats on opening night at Her
Majesty’s were 10 guineas and seven
guineas. Regrettably, we cannot give
you an odious comparison on Miss
Sutherland’s earnings.
Madame Melba came down from
Brisbane by train. It was like the
triumphant return of Pompey and his
legions. At every station there were
cheering crowds. On opening night,
according to “Table Talk”, the Town
Hall was festooned with lights as if
for Royalty, with the name MELBA
picked out in colored incandescent
bulbs. The crowd already was
gathering by 6.30 p.m. By 7 p.m.
there were thousands outside and
mounted police had to make a way
to the steps. At 1 I p.m. they were
still there, hoping wistfully to see the
diva, but they never did. She came
in a back way.
Madame’s opening song was the
Mad Scene from “Lucia di Lammer-
moor”. “Table Talk” reported: “For
half a minute before she appeared no
one even breathed. Then the ap-
plause broke out. She wore an ex-
quisite gown of pale straw color, no
ornaments but a single chain of pearls.
She lay her hand on heart as if to
stop its wild beating. Melba sang.”
On July 10, 1965 by 7 p.m. there
were hundreds outside the theatre. The
chief guest was the Acting Governor-
General and the Governor of Queens-
land, Sir Henry Abel Smith.
The scene in the foyer was extra-
ordinary, just like Melbourne Cup Day
with everyone trying desperately to see
and be seen. And remember at Flem-
ington how the crowd all take posi-
tions up the grandstand steps? They did
this here up the dress circle steps, with
distinguished ladies staring down at
other distinguished ladies through
opera glasses. To get through the
foyer was a dreadful task. One has
to experience the extreme difficulty
of pushing through solid mink.
The first glimpse of Joan Suther-
land was on stage, sitting with her
hand over heart. Was she, too, wor-
ried about wild beating?
In 1902 “there was such a scene of
enthusiasm Melbourne never before
witnessed.” “The Herald” said, “The
audience was electrified and did not
desist from ever recalling the artist
until encore after encore.” The first
encore was “Home Sweet Home”.
Then, said “Table Talk”, com-
menced a procession of attendants,
each bearing a beautiful floral trophy.
“At this fresh token of affection the
control under which Madame Melba
had held her emotion was broken
down and with hands pressed to her
eyes she rushed from the platform.”
The flowers more than covered the
entire platform. They were in the
shape of hearts, harps, wreaths,
boomerangs, in baskets and one
beauty was made to the shape of the
ladder of fame, labelled HAIL
AUSTRALIA’S QUEEN OF SONG
1886-1902 with an electric star on
top. It was from Miss Nellie
Stewart.
At “Lucia di Lammermoor” 1965
also there were scenes of enthusiasm.
They stamped their feet until the
future of the dress circle sounded
quite ominous. They shouted bravo.
The Mad Scene was interrupted by
an ovation which lasted for three
minutes. One gentleman in tails and
decorations stood up and wildly
waved for everyone else to get up and
cheer. (That ' was another thing
about opening night. Gentlemen were
asked to wear white tie and decora-
tions. One in 10 did. The rest wore
black tie). At the end of the Mad
Scene there were 16 curtain calls. At
the finish there were 20 curtain calls
with slow handclaps and hollers for
an encore, but there w'as no “Home
Sweet Home”.
The flowers nearly, but not quite,
covered the stage. There was a circle
of vermilion Cooktown orchids from
Sir Henry Abel Smith. Joan Suther-
land did not run from the stage, her
hands pressed to her eyes. She put
out her hands in entreaty, she threw
kisses with both hands and she gave
one of Sir Henry’s orchids to each of
the principals, and her husband, the
conductor. After all, he too, was on
the stage.
It all finished at 11.25 p.m. Miss
Sutherland received Sir Henry and
his party in her dressing-room. In
her dressing-room she had a small
copper statuette of the Madonna of
Monserrat and a red rose.
She said that singing in Spain one
night she had a shocking bronchial
throat and she croaked all through
the first act. Her dresser gave her a
rose and a statuette dedicated to the
Madonna. After 15 minutes, her
throat was clear. That Madonna
statuette had been around ever since.
What else? For Madame Melba
there was Peche Melba. Now at the
Southern Cross there is the “La
Stupenda” cocktail, a combination of
drambuie, cointreau, aurum and cham-
pagne with orange peel.
Apparently after three of those one
does the Mad Scene.

Getting to the Top
Why do men climb mountains?
This week is the 100th anniversary
of the first ascent of Switzerland’s
the Matterhorn by Englishman
Edward Whymper. As part of the cele-
brations Sir John Hunt, the conqueror
of Everest, will make his first journey
up the Matterhorn. As he explained to
Kenneth Harris in London, he has so far
avoided this mountain, “mainly because
there are always too many people on it”.
However, for the centenary celebra-
tions the Matterhorn is likely to be as
crowded as Martin Place in the lunch-
hour. The party is expected to be about
60 and will include BBC and Swiss tele-
vision cameramen who are organising a
live programme on the ascent which will
be televised on Eurovision.
Harris: Sir John, why do men climb
mountains?
Hunt: For lots of reasons. Some of
the deeper ones are difficult to diagnose
and describe. When Frank Smythe was
asked why he climbed mountains he
used to say, “Life is at its best when
risked”. When Whymper was asked, he
spoke of “mysterious impulses which
cause men to peer into the unknown”.
Most climbers don’t care to analyse their
motives in this way.
In my case it began when I was a
child of 10, before I was old enough to
think about it. My father used to climb
mountains before I was born; he had
met Whymper. My father was a soldier
and was killed in 1914, when I was four.
My mother used to take us to Switzer-
land during school holidays after the
Great War, to some of the places they
used to go together. I have a photo-
graph of myself in 1921, roped to a
guide on the Upper Grindelwald Glacier;
I can remember the thrill of exploration
I had on that well-worn tourist spot 43
years ago.
I climbed my first high mountain, the
traverse of Piz Palii, when I was 15.
From that moment there was no question
about it: I had to go on. I didn’t think
out the reason why till long afterwards.
Once you have climbed a mountain,
of course, you become aware of other,
more obvious attractions. The physical
stimulus of the act of climbing; the
curious and exciting psychological sense
of elevation as you move up; the sense
of satisfaction in the application of tech-
nique; the relaxation of tension and rest
after supreme physical effort. And some-
times, the view from the top.
I don’t know, really, which is the more
satisfying—the view from the top or the
view from the valley. The view looking
down on where you climbed from
occasionally leaves you feeling very
anxious about the prospect of getting
down again. One the whole, I prefer
the view from the valley after you have
returned, with the accompanying thought
“I have been there”. Aesthetically speak-
ing, the best views are usually to be
found half-way up.
Do you climb into something or out
of something? Is it challenge or escape?
Like all profound experiences it is a
paradox: both challenge and escape.
There is certainly an element of escapism
in most climbers. I climb partly to get
away, for a time, from the life of the
city and some of the values of con-
temporary living. But there is the
reality even in the escape. You climb
to discover things about yourself. To
be on your own, to be with yourself,
facing yourself in situations of stress
and danger, is one way to do it.
And I climb to get away from people
in the mass. I have never climbed the
Matterhorn, mainly because there are
always too many people on it. I hope
to make good this omission this month,
the hundredth anniversary of its first
ascent.
Quite what a mountain does to you is
difficult to express in words. You are
most aware of it when you are on your
own. It cuts you down to size and makes
you feel small. It is like the thought of
being alone in the middle of the sea,
or dense jungle or a desert place. It
both attracts and frightens.
There’s a difference between what you
feel about mountains and what you feel
about climbing mountains?
There may have been once, and for
some there certainly always is a dif-
ference. For me, no longer. I have only
to see—or even to hear about a mountain
—to want to get up it. It has a great
deal more to it than the prospect of a
further horizon, which makes a man
want to reach a high piece of ground
or the top of a tower. For any moun-
taineer, I believe, this is so.
They present a challenge: “Can I
climb that ridge, or that wall?” or “It
looks as if there’s a possible line up that
face”. And to borrow a phrase from a
striking book title about the jungle, the
mountain is neutral. It is neither friendly
nor hostile. Its combination of scale,
steepness and colossal calm indifference
compels you to feel respect, even awe.
But the metaphysics of mountain-
climbing is not the conscious attraction;
at least, only when you are on your own
in the mountains, or climbing “solo”.
Most people feel more the human side
of it. Climbing with companions creates
a wonderfully close relationship, of co-
operation and sharing, which is rarely
found in everyday life. To tackle a hard
climb is a test of each individual’s intel-
lect, experience, will, guts and skill. But
each is dependent on the other; not only
for achievement, but for mutual security
and survival.
Is there any fundamental difference
between climbing a mountain in Cumber-
land or Derbyshire and climbing
Everest?
Oh yes! Except in unusual conditions
a climb in England is on rock, and, as
a problem, far harder than you could
tackle on Everest. It’s a matter of the
scale of the climb and the height above
sea level. The highest mountains are
almost certainly more snow and ice than
rock climbs, and the latter element is
far easier; it must be so, or you could
not get up it at high altitude. The
problems peculiar to high altitude climb-
ing are oxygen lack, cold and wind, and
sheer scale; or rather a combination of
these.
On Everest, for example, you need to
take several breaths to stoke up enough
energy for one step. And you need a
rest every dozen steps or so, even though
the going is relatively easy. At this rate
you may climb at a speed of some 300
vertical feet an hour. A fit climber can
ascend similar ground, at alpine or
lower altitudes, at between 1500 and
2000 vertical feet an hour —six times as
fast

climbers on an “excessively severe” first
ascent of a British rock climb may
spend many hours climbing as little as
300 feet, owing to the sheer technical
difficulty.
But there are the psychological con-
ditions of climbing at high altitudes to
be reckoned. The combined effect of the
rarefied atmosphere, prolonged risk and
discomfort, make people edgy and awk-
ward. You’re inclined to be intolerant,
to see things out of proportion. You
can become very selfish get peevish
if you don’t think you have had your
fair share of the food; get a “fixture”
about someone else’s personal habits
things which you would laugh at any-
body for noticing, let alone resenting, in
normal conditions.
Physiological wastage and deterioration
are very marked in a man at 25,000 feet
and above. The sheer effort of getting
out of a sleeping bag, of putting on boots,
of cooking, require an immense effort
of will let alone the climbing.
Is mountaineering really all about the
facing of fear?
No. The facing of fear is involved,
inevitably. But that isn’t the only motive.
Most men who climb mountains don't
do so because they are driven by a
neurotic obsession with the need to face
their own fears. Though, as I said to
you earlier on, they find they have to
do so, time and again, in the process of
climbing mountains. But as I also said,
a very powerful motive is the comrade-
ship which comes from sharing a risk,
which reduces your fears.
I would say another one is the exercise
of judgment in the face of danger—the
opposite of foolhardiness. It may require
more moral courage to abandon a climb
than to go on.
Some years ago in the Caucasus, near
the summit of a 17,000-foot peak and
with most of the technical difficulties
behind and below us, a climbing party
of which I was a member decided that
the objective dangers of continuing to
the top were such that we should turn
back—only 600 feet below our much-
desired goal. It was a hard decision, but
this happens frequently to every moun-
taineer.
We went back to base. Our Russian
friends were amazed that we had turned
back and, I think, because we freely
admitted it. For me, accepting that a
situation is too big for me, and deliber-
ately acting on the decision to bow to it,
is moral victory.
You see, to my mind it is not getting
to the top of Everest that matters in
life—it is why and how you try to get
there. And sometimes it is better not to
get to the top of a mountain at all. The
victor on a mountain is the man who
can conquer his own ambitions if need
be.
Thrice Mayor of
Melbourne
The last dyed-in-the-tiveed romantic
By J. C. KAYE
Mr Harold Macmillan is said to
be the last of the Englishmen
who literally put tongue in
cheek while awaiting reactions to a story.
By the same measure, Sir Gengoult
Smith, of Toorak, in Melbourne, may be
the last Australian who lifts one knee
and strikes it with his fist as he exclaims
“By Jove!”.
Sir Gengoult, three times Lord Mayor
of Melbourne, who has just announced
his retirement from the City Council after
44 years of continuous service, is a man
raised in the mould of the ideal English
gent. One brackets him at once with
Lord Casey.
At 75, Sir Gengoult has the bowler-
and-cane panache of the English cavalry
officer. His sft. Bin. figure is trim; his
sandy-grey hair is combed back; his
moustache, grey too now, is correct;
his clothes are expensively quiet.
He is, of course, a dyed-in-the-tweed
romantic.
Harold Gengoult Smith was born in
Collins Street, at the eastern or Paris
end. His father was Dr L. L. Smith, a
physician-politician who spent 40 years in
the Legislative Assembly, kept 30 race-
horses at Caulfield, and had his own
stables behind the Collins Street building.
The Smith home, long demolished, was
on the left side, looking down the hill,
almost opposite the Melbourne Club.
Before Dr Smith took it over it had
been used as Government House.
Dr Smith was not quite of the upper
crust. He was later to be referred to
as “that eminent advertising practitioner
of the healing art”. But he did well,
with an income of well over £lO,OOO
a year, sat 30 people at a time to dinner,
and owned 700 acres in the Beaconsfield
district, near Berwick.
Young Harold Gengoult, one of four
children, remembers going into the big
dinners, dressed in an Eton suit, until
turned out with the ladies as the port
arrived. He remembers Beaconsfield
and the tragedy that occurred there
when one of his two sisters was killed
by a falling boulder.
He and his brother Louis (to be killed
in the First World War) and his other
sister Louise (who became Mrs Jimmy
Dyer and founded the Lyrebird Press in
Paris) used to ride out to Beaconsfield
from the Collins Street stable yard.
Young Harold went to school at St
Patrick’s, on Eastern Hill, for a while
because Dr Smith thought that State and
Catholic schools gave the best education.
Then he went on to Melbourne Gram-
mar, riding there each day and leaving
his nag at the school stahles. He
accepted that he would be a doctor. He
also yearned, as a school cadet, to be a
soldier.
His father died in 1910 leaving, among
other estate, properties in Collins Street
now worth a fortune, but not then so
impressive.
Harold was in Edinburgh, near the
end of his medical course, when he got
a few hours’ notice, through a friend,
of the coming declaration of war. He
left the dinner table to write to London
his offer to enlist. He became a cavalry-
man in a British regiment, Second
Dragoon Guards, Queen’s Bay Regiment.
He thinks he was the first Australian to
enlist in that war.
Instead of making cavalry charges, he
became a captain in a topographical unit,
plotting the flashes of enemy guns. He
was shot down from the air once, and
wounded twice. When he returned to
Melbourne from Edinburgh and Glas-
gow with medical degrees, he put up his
plate in Collins Street like his father
before him, and lived there a bachelor
life. He was good looking, and his hair
and moustache were thick.
Ten years after his election to the
City Council in 1921 he was chosen as
Lord Mayor at a meeting marked,
according to “The Age” of the time,
“with scenes of intense excitement”.
Again according to “The Age”, “much
bitterness had been introduced into the
contest”. His opponent was Councillor
J. J. Liston, a man closely associated
in the Melbourne mind with both the
liquor trade and the Victorian Football
Association.
Preliminary skirmishes went rather
against Smith. When he was chosen by
15 votes to 14 “there followed a moment
of incredulous silence”.
As Melbourne’s first bachelor Lord
Mayor (and there has not since been
another), Dr Harold Gengoult Smith,
41, found his life transformed. People
began to ask how to say his name and
were told to say “Zhang-goo”. Some
said “Goo-goo” instead. Mothers with
eligible daughters crowded close.
The new Lord Mayor became chair-
man of the Melbourne Centenary com-
mittee, preparing the celebrations for
1934. Here he showed considerable
verve. He thought of the idea for the
England-Melbourne Centenary Air Race

while reading a magazine story about
the annual Monte Carlo car rally.
The race was a sensational event of
1934, and Sir Gengoult Smith, re-elected
as Lord Mayor for a third term for that
year, was at Flemington Racecourse to
welcome Scott and Black when they were
driven in triumph from Essendon. Sir
Macpherson Robertson, the confection-
ery magnate who had put up £15,000 for
the race, read the victors a home-made
and rather long poem.
A deep and lasting love came into the
Lord Mayor’s life in 1932 when he went
to open an art show and saw Cynthia,
20, daughter of Mr (now Sir) Norman
and Mrs (now Dame) Mabel Brookes.
The wedding at St Paul’s Cathedral,
Melbourne, in December, 1933, was a
2000-guest job.
Sir Gengoult and Lady Smith, the envy
of town, took up residence at “Raveloe”,
a white mansion in Domain Road, South
Yarra, on Toorak’s edge. They had two
children, Marion, to whom the Duke of
Gloucester stood godfather, and Norman,
to whom the present Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies, did the same office.
The Smiths, in 1958, marked the 25th
anniversary of their wedding by re-
newing their marriage vows. There was
nothing Sir Gengoult would have wished
for more than for another 25 years whh
his wife. But she died in 1961.
As a civic figure, since his lord
mayoralty, Sir Gengoult has continued
to make news.
He has been a strong spokesman for
what many people would call the Old
Guard. He detests modern art and long-
haired pop singers, and one way to make
him blaze is to ask him whether the
Beatles should have got the MBE.
May he be around for a long, long
time! Melbourne has not so many
genuine and colorful people that she
would not miss him.
WINES TO BUY
The Lost
Child
The three Cs , and now a Rose
By CELLARMASTER
Why are Roses the bastard children
of the Australian wine industrv,
scorned by the public, ignored
by the eating and drinking societies,
buried in the obscurity of forgotten price
lists? They_ inspire the Italians, fulfil the
French, please the Portuguese, and reign
in Spain. In the United States they enjoy
tremendous status.
The trouble in Australia is, I think,
that they were originally made too sweet.
It was felt that they would be drunk by
those people who prefer wines with a
trace of sugar still in them and, until
recently, this remained the attitude.
There was one notable exception, Linde-
man’s Grenache Rose, which was made
always dry with typical grape flavor and
character, and it is interesting to note
that this wine is considered a commercial
success.
In my opinion, Roses should be quite
dry. Australia has the ideal climate for
them since nothing could be more
delightful than such a wine on a hot
summer’s afternoon, at a picnic, or on
a boat. They should be refreshing,
mouth - cleansing, and have delightful
flavor, delicacy and crisp acid. There-
fore, sweetness is an anomaly and con-
tradicts the basic requirement and
eventual fulfilment of the wine.
Recently I have tasted two wines
which I felt were in this direction. One
was Seppelt’s Rosetta. It used to be
rather heavy in character, had a slightly,
almost porty nose, and was quite a sturdy
young thing altogether. But today the
wine is much more true to type. It has
delicacy, good balance and is almost
quite dry, a very considerable improve-
ment upon the previous style.
The other was in Western Australia
where I recently had the great pleasure
of tasting the most outstanding Australian
Rose I have yet drunk. It is made by
Jack Mann of Houghton Wines as a
special. A very eminent person appar-
ently sought this style of wine in Aus-
tralia and couldn’t find it, so he asked
Jack Mann to make him some.
Jack Mann is a delightful character, a
gentleman and a wine enthusiast if ever
there was one, even after 44 successive
vintages. He lives for the three Cs, he
says, Chablis, Cricket and Christianity,
though he is not quite sure about the
order of the first two. The Houghton
winery is immaculate, one of the most
charming I have seen in Australia, with
row upon row of oak in beautiful con-
dition, polished brass bolts on the cask
doors, orderliness and efficiency every-
where, softened by respect and feeling
for the tradition and mystique of wine.
Jack Mann casually tosses off bons mots.
On modern labels: “They can adorn the
bottles on the outside, I will adorn them
on the inside.” On my comment about
the burnt character on the nose of the
West Australian reds. “Burnt character?
You’re being too polite, that’s the famous
Swan Valley stink”! His judgment of a
great friend’s wine from another State:
.“The reds never mellow; they go around
wearing his (the maker’s) frown.”
His Rose is quite remarkable, being
made from nine parts Cabernet to one
part Malbec. It has lovely balance and
delicacy with a soft fruity quality, finish-
ing quite dry with no trace of residual
sugar. A beautiful wine —to me, an
outstanding achievement, and I am look-
ing forward to seeing this when it has
a little more bottle-age, since I feel this
would develop even further.
I do suggest that, if other wine-makers
adopt this pattern in making these wines
drier, the long anticipated arrival of
Roses to predominance in the selling
charts will occur.


OVERSEAS
Britain Turns a Corner
The end of the Left
By ANTHONY HARTLEY
It is increasingly said in Great Britain
these days that there has been a
change in the “mood of the country”
a change which, however, remains ill-
defined in our own minds and the con-
fusion of which is fittingly symbolised
by the fact that the main public opinion
polls have, in the last fortnight, given
totally opposed results. Individual
changes there certainly are. Some
familiar landmarks in British political
and intellectual life are disappearing. The
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, for
instance, in its conference held at the
beginning of June gave every sign of
imminent dissolution. One delegate re-
marked that they were no longer “a one-
more-push campaign”, and some of the
discussions made it seem as if they were
no longer a campaign at all. What with
council members being called “police
spies” and recriminations over an anar-
chist attempt to break up the Easter
march, it looked as if one chapter in the
history of British liberal, and not-so-
liberal, protest were closed.
Of course, it was inevitable that the
Labor Government’s decision to hang on
to the British independent deterrent
should deal a death blow to CND. All
it can now do is to lose the Labor
Party some votes, and its supporters are
hamstrung by fear of “putting the Tories
in”. This is the end of one more pro-
gressive “campaign”—the most evocative
of them all—and one wonders whether
there will ever be anything to replace it.
The present rising tide of criticism on
the Left wing of the Labor Party of
Government support for American policy
in Vietnam seems mild enough compared
with what Mr Gaitskcll had to put up
with from the adepts of the “Ban-the-
Bomb” movement. Mr Wilson has
altered the whole line of the foreign
policy adopted by Labor in opposition
with hardly a murmur from the Labor
Left. As one Left-wing Labor Member
of Parliament put it on leaving the
chamber of the House of Commons after
hearing Mr Wilson speak on defence
policy: “If Gaitskell had made that
speech, I’d have torn him limb from
limb, but as it’s Harold . . .” The
impotence of the Left within the Labor
Party could hardly be better illustrated.
And perhaps, despite the recent Oxford
“teach-in”, the relatively small number of
choices open to this country at present
is beginning to sink into the public mind.
Of what use are brave words about “an
initiative” over Vietnam or “a stand
against American policy” when it is to
America that Mr Wilson has to turn
when he needs help to save the pound?
How can he wish the US to withdraw
from South-East Asia when he himself is
committed to a confrontation with Indo-
nesia over Malaysia? The bitter fact is
that power over the machinery of British
government does not mean power over
events, and the British public is now
learning the lesson that a change of
government does not dispose of prob-
lems. With the same party in power for
13 years, this was something that a large
section of the electorate and especially
the young electorate had forgotten.
Before last October’s election many
British intellectuals used to talk as if it
was sheer Conservative incompetence
that was preventing the righting of
Britain’s balance of payments, the
modernisation of British industry, the
social integration of our immigrant popu-
lation and the solution of the whole
range of intractable problems with which
Great Britain is faced. Now it is begin-
ning to be appreciated that the flaws in
our economy and society are not some-
thing that can be put right by gimmicks,
and even that much-courted figure, the
young married technologist, must realise
that he cannot have an American stan-
dard of living before Great Britain attains
American standards of productivity. And
productivity in this connection is not
just better planning and replacing rich
men’s sons by technocrats on company
boards. It also involves harder work on
the ' part of many people and some
change in ways of working and living
by many more —including a large pro-
portion of the industrial labor force.
Tn other words, there is a growing
A realisation in the public mind that our
present problems are not to be solved for
us by the remote figures in Whitehall
and Westminster, but rather demand a
large number of individual efforts up
and down the country. The effect of this
realisation could be healthy, but one less
heartening result of the present situation
is a growing disillusionment with political
parties and political solutions.
But a greater scepticism in the elec-
torate will be of use if it discourages
political parties from playing the fool.
Too often since the war both Britain’s
main parties have attached exaggerated
THE LAST MARCH?
importance to measures which had no
obvious relevance to an always poten-
tially serious economic situation or to a
position in the world that has not yet
found a new equilibrium. The Con-
servatives with their introduction of com-
mercial television or the Labor Party
with their nationalisation of steel were
essentially wasting time their own
which was bad, and the nation’s which
was worse. Now, to use the words of
Shakespeare’s Richard 11, time wastes
them, and, as the Orpington and Leyton
by-elections showed, neither great party
can rely on what were once the most
solid elements of support it possessed.
The parties will have to do better in
future, govern more intelligently with
less of an eye to party-workers and more
attention focused on the ordinary voter.
What is true of the parties is also
true of “movements”. The course of
events has shown the profound irrele-
vance of CND and its programme for
the world we live in. And there are signs
that this has not gone unobserved by
the generation now leaving the schools.
There is a reaction away from “brave,
lost causes” towards a more empirical
realism and a tendency to reject the
rather hectic sentimentality which has
been the prevailing note of British move-
ments of protest over the last 10 years.
This verdict, though it might do less
than justice to genuine idealism, is
justified by political results. For the
end-product of a decade of CND-type
protest is a Labor Government that has
decided to keep Britain’s deterrent,
further restrict Commonwealth immigra-
tion and is just as keen as its predecessor
on keeping in line with the US. By any
standards this is a failure, and one which
must make intellectuals reflect on
whether a country that has yet to
cultivate its own garden can be a suitable

lever for starting a world-wide reform

All of which suggests that once again
a cycle has gone by, and that intellectual,
social and political life in Britain may
well be increasingly dominated by a
growing reaction against the mood of
the late ’fifties and early ’sixties just as,
after the war, there was a strong reaction
against the mood of the ’thirties among
young intellectuals a reaction to be
found, for example, in the novels of
Kingsley Amis.
Mr Wilson’s government is acting as
a catalyst for a type of scepticism, which
would probably have made its appear-
ance anyway, but whose emergence has
been hastened by disappointment with
what had been proclaimed as a new
departure. Thus Mr Wilson’s hundred
days has indeed been a turning point,
though not precisely in the way he
intended. His government has, however,
inculcated a useful political lesson: that
the necessities of government do not
change with the alternation of parties.
And if cynicism is the immediate re-
action to this tardy revelation, that only
gives the measure of the divorce from
reality during a decade that saw the rain-
bow constructions of liberal idealism
undergo dazzling proliferation. There is
little left of that iridescence in mid-
-1965, but we are not necessarily the
worse off.
University
of the Air
From ROLAND HUNTFORD
in Stockholm
Tme University of the Air has long
been discussed among pedagogues
and broadcasters as a possible
tool of adult education and a relief to
overcrowded lecture rooms. Swedish
State Radio appears to be the first to
have tried it in practice. They are now
engaged in an experimental course in
political science which leads to a single
“credit” that will count towards a degree
at a Swedish university.
The course lasts two terms. After the
first term 825 listeners sat for the exam-
inations and 600 passed. A peak listening
time was allowed, and programmes were
broadcast between 6.30 and 7.5 p.m. on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
University teachers prepared the scripts
and produced the programmes, which
took the form of half-hour lectures, with
a five-minute period at the end to answer
questions sent in by post.
Public interest was surprising. A text-
book specially written for the course was
quickly sold out, and a second edition


issued. More than 6,000 listeners
registered with the Institute of Political
Science at Stockholm University. There
were several thousands more who had
not matriculated and were therefore
excluded.
At all events, those who followed the
Swedish Radio university courses were
in two classes: listeners with the matricu-
lation examination, who could take a
degree, and those without it, who could
not. The first were expected to work on
their own, but the others were helped
with study circles.
These were arranged mainly by the
“ABF”, the powerful and rich Workers’
Education Union. Originating at the end
of the last century as a political instru-
ment, it has acquired respectability with
the years and in fact represents culture
in most of the smaller towns of Sweden,
where it maintains well-equipped adult
education institutes with libraries.
Together with the “ABF”, the Swedish
State Radio experimented with tutorial
techniques in conjunction with their
broadcast lectures. They were supple-
mented by tape recordings of additional
explanations and local school teachers
were employed to lead seminars.
These study circles have their own
examinations which lead to a diploma in
political science. But those who sub-
sequently matriculate will be allowed to
count it towards a degree course at a
university.
Swedish Radio, encouraged by the
results, proposes to repeat the course
next year to give those who failed an-
other chance, and allow the many f o
start who missed the original broadcasts.
Conventional lecture-room techniques
cannot be used on the air, and the
Swedish Radio producers have been feel-
ing their way towards suitable methods.
The textbook issued for the present
course makes the point that radio lessons
need new approaches, particularly on
the part of pupils, and suggests some of
them. But they remain suggestions, for
it is all very experimental, and listeners
are the guinea-pigs.
At the moment the most probable pur-
pose of the Swedish University of the
Air seems to be that of filling leisure
time, which is considered here to be one
of the most urgent problems of the im-
mediate future. Adult education is re-
garded as a good filler, for it helps to
give a purpose to existence, and it
satisfies a national reverence for
academic learning. But the present ex-
perimental stage has shown another, and
possibly more important, application.
Forty blind listeners followed the course.
The Swedish Radio helped them by
speaking the textbook on to tapes. Per-
haps the real future of the University of
the Air lies with the education of the
handicapped.
New Attack on English
Gilding the golden image of Dr Verwoerd
The English language, already a wast-
ing asset in South Africa, is again
under attack from Afrikaner
Nationalists. This is not an attack as
before, using slogans like “the language
of the conquerors in the mouth of the
conquered is the language of slaves” or
“the enemy’s language” as its weapons.
Such crude, frontal attacks have now
been replaced with the subtler method
of questioning the progress and future
of Afrikaans in South Africa.
It is three years since the language
question last raised its tenacious head.
Then, in a speech to the Nationalist
student organisation, a professor of
anthropology stated loud the ultimate
dream of Afrikaner Nationalists: “I
envisage the time when Afri-
kaans will become the official
language in the Republic.” The
Broederbond, the secret society
behind Nationalist politics of
which the Prime Minister re-
cently admitted he was a mem-
ber—has always aimed at abol-
ishing English as the other
official language.
After a few ripples of sympathy in
the Government Press, silence closed
over the subject, for 1962 was not a
year in which to begin a campaign for
ousting English from its legal position.
Sharpeville was still a searing memory.
South Africans were leaving the country
in thousands, and few immigrants came
to replace them.
Abroad, Scandinavians were organising
boycotts of South African goods and
there was a rumble of threats from
African States meeting in Lagos.
At the United Nations, South-West
Africa was a passionate issue. There was
talk of a naval blockade, and the Re-
public was lightly armed.
But 1965 is quite another era in South
Africa. The Nationalist Government is
sleek with a surplus of votes and money.
There is no shortage of arms and im-
migrants. Threats now serve only to
draw whites together and to gild the
already golden image of Dr Verwoerd
as the strong savior of white South
Africa. Most English - speaking South
Africans have willingly, if cynically,
placed their future in his camp.
With such consensus in the country,
the time for launching an anti-English
campaign is now, and 1966, the Re-
public’s fifth birthday, for which nation-
wide celebrations are already being
planned, could well be judged the proper
time for making Afrikaans “the first
official language”. The signs—small per-
haps—that the campaign is under way,
are there: teachers in the Transvaal refuse
to have their cheques made out in English
every alternate month; a Broederbond
professor makes a plea in a teachers’
journal for prayers to be said in the
“mother tongue”, and adds that “if a
person were unilingual ... the use of
the language would be better, purer and
clearer”.
Someone complains that an attendant
in a game reserve cafe was unable to
speak to her in Afrikaans; a former
Cabinet Minister calls for, and gets, a
volkskongress to investigate the state in
which Afrikaans finds itself. What, in
fact, is the state of Afrikaans in relation
to English? Nature, propa-
ganda and unwritten codes have
already made a fiction of bi-
lingualism. Afrikaners, with
their higher birthrate, now con-
stitute more than 60 per cent of
the white population. In many
country towns and villages
English is a dead language. Four
years ago only 128 out of 3000
pupils in the Orange Free State knew
“some” English and of these only 26
knew it well. Nothing has happened
since then to alter the situation.
In the business world the Reddings-
daadbond, the Afrikaans Chamber of
Commerce, soon puts its mark on
any business that remains aggressively
English-speaking. Teachers of Afrikaans
have never had so many businessmen
scholars as today. All pretence of
bilingualism in the Civil Service has been
abandoned. Letters and circulars now
unashamedly go out in Afrikaans because
of the inability and unwillingness of the
majority of Government servants to
speak and write reasonable English. A
prison official giving evidence in a Pre-
toria court some time ago was unable
to translate “the cat walked under the
table” into English.
The Minister of Justice, Mr Balthazar
Vorster, plans to make it compulsory for
all lawyers and barristers to be proficient
in Afrikaans. Architects already have
to write their specifications for Govern-
ment work in that language. If the pro-
cess continues and there is no fore-
seeable reason why it should not the
only remaining entrenched clause in the
Constitution will quietly have been done
to death without the trouble and publicity
of having to gain a two-thirds majority
in Parliament to vote English out of
official existence, (ofns)


VIETNAM
The Viet Army
A fter seven weeks of the five-month
1 monsoon season, which favors the
Victcong and which is expected to see
their greatest offensive of the war,
military observers here are convinced
that Vietnam Army morale must be
bolstered decisively and at once to avoid
a debacle.
Gallant little soldiers they may often
be, but the Vietnamese have been losing
about 1000 men a week in ambushes.
Following classic ground war rules,
the Vietnamese have been easy targets.
They stick to their redoubts or lumber
about the roads.
Is there no way to improve matters?
There is too much dependence on mech-
anical aids leave it to the Air Force
and not enough human imagination
at work among Vietnam top brass. Viet-
namese soldiers should be given more
basic instruction than can be gained in
three months: exhausted Vietnamese
soldiers and officers should be regroup-
ed, rested, retrained and replaced by
Allied troops; more should be done to
build Army recreational centres and
hospitals.
Undoubtedly, the war could not con-
tinue at all. if it were not for an Ameri-
can air effort that is supremely bold
and expert. Time and again, disaster on
the ground has been avoided by air in-
tervention and will be again. Vietcong
prisoners have testified to huge guerrilla
casualties from air strikes. But the war
cannot be won in the air, as everyone
realises here.
Air support can bolster the morale of
troops but overdependence on it saps
efficiency.
INDONESIA
Army v. Reds
grows between the Indonesian
-*■ Communists and the Army. Recently
General Nasution. the Defence Minister,
ordered his 17 military commanders to
publish and distribute an army news-
paper to counter Communist newspaper
influence in their regions. At the same
time the Minister for the Army, General
Achmad Yani. rejected a suggestion
from Mr D. N. Aidit, chairman of the
Indonesian Communist Party, that
political party commissars should be
appointed to army units. There is also
strong army opposition to Communist
hopes of arming peasants and workers
to “fight British imperialism”.
This suggestion came from the
Chinese Prime Minister, Chou En-lai.
General Nasution has said that Indonesia
will not start an open war. There is
little doubt that she would suffer heavily
if she did. The Indonesian Air Force
and Navy could be neutralised by British
planes and ships in probably little more
than 48 hours.
Recent attempts by Indonesia to
infiltrate Singapore’s defences one of
nine Indonesian prisoners said his mis-
sion was to blow up a power station
could be aimed at forcing the Malaysians
and the British into heavy retaliation
against Indonesian island bases that ring
Singapore. Retaliation could then be
condemned as “imperialist aggression”.
British policy- is to remain strictly
defensive, to deal severely with attacks
when they come and show the Indo-
nesians that aggression does not pay.
INDIA
“A Sell-out”?
"Oritain’s success in bringing about a
cease-fire between the armies of
India and Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch
is being lauded by many rational voices.
But a touch of frostbite seemed to
threaten this bud of Indo-Pakistan accord
at the start, when the Indian Home
Minister, Mr Nanda. chose the day after
the announcement of the Kutch agree-
ment to reiterate in the bleakest terms
India's attitude towards the Kashmir
dispute. There is a marked uneasiness
in official circles about the likely popular
reaction to the agreement.
The English language newspapers of
the capital are as one in commending
it. But in the Hindi papers of the Hindus,
and also in one or two ot the Urdu
papers of the Muslims, the agreement
is being condemned as a sell-out. Editor-
ials declared that “Wilson has fooled
Shastri”, that Britain has favored
Pakistan and “tricked India again”.
The feeling is widespread among
Indians that the Pakistanis should have
been driven out of Kutch by some
glorious feat of arms, as they were
driven from the crags above Kargil be-
side India’s military supply road to
Ladakh.
Mr Shastri has five weeks before
the monsoon session of Parliament opens
—to allay these fears and demands.
IRON CURTAIN
Escapees
npHERE is a steady trickle of Polish
refugees across the Baltic to Den-
mark and occasional defectors among
Czechs and other inland satellite citizens
on Scandinavian cruises arranged by the
East German State shipping organisation.
Asylum is generally granted, but the
Danish authorities have found increasing
difficulty in deciding cases, because the
legal criteria laid down are based on a
conventional definition of persecution.
However, refugees no longer complain
of the knock at midnight and the threat
of arbitrary sentences. In their place
is an insidious pressure to conform.
The Communists have evolved a caste
society based on an intricate scale of
official ratings for political reliability
and conformity of speech. This has led
to corruption and to something closely
resembling protection rackets.
111-paid officials are more and more
open to taking bribes. People who want
a good reliability rating can generally
obtain it by paying the proper tariff.
East Germans are lynx-eyed in guard-
ing their borders, but the Poles have
recently begun to tighten their arrange-
ments, and the Czechs have strengthened
their electrified border fence.
UNO
Women
United Nations is now working on
a declaration on women’s rights for
the Economic and Social Council this
month.
The draft spells out in some detail
what should be done to ensure that
women attain equal political rights, rights
in the matter of education, economic and
social rights, civil rights and, in par-
ticular, family rights and rights in regard
to nationality. Provision is made for
special care and attention during preg-
nancy and after confinement, including
paid maternity leave and the right to
return to former employment.
The declaration stipulates that women
shall get equal pay for equal work. The
commission was told that the relevant
convention initiated by the International
Labor Office has now been ratified ny
48 countries (not including Britain). But
there are difficulties in its application.

FORUM
Castrating Sex Offenders?
The Scandinavian experience
From ROY PERROTT in Copenhagen
Is there a more effective answer to
serious sexual crime than longer gaol
sentences? Some Members of Parlia-
ment in Britain are now urging Britons
to consider some of the less conventional
Scandinavian methods of dealing w'ith it
—in particular, their use of the tech-
nique of castration.
In the House of Commons recently
Mr David Ensor, Labor MP for Bury
and Radcliffe, asked the Home Secretary
whether he will inquire into the possibility
of using castration for persistent sex off-
enders who are potentially dangerous to
the public.
If the suggestion were accepted, there
would be a fair body of experience to
draw upon from the Scandinavian coun-
tries and Holland. Voluntary castration
has been available there for many years
within the penal system and in some
cases outside it for private citizens with
severe sexual problems.
The only country which has used com-
pulsory castration in recent times, for
mental defectives as well as certain crim-
inals, is Nazi Germany. Provisions for
compulsion exist on the statute book in
Denmark, but they have never been used
and will shortly be abolished. The legal
position in Britain is ill-defined. There is
nothing on the statute book about castra-
tion; but the general sense of the law is
that any mutilation is against public pol-
icy, and it seems that any surgeon who
performed the operation, even w'ith the
consent of the patient, w'ould run the risk
of criminal proceedings. The position
seems to be the same in Australia.
One of the authorities on the use and
effects of castration as a part of social
policy is Dr Georg Stiirup, w'hose w'ork
w'ith criminal psychopaths at the Hersted-
vester detention institution, near Copen-
hagen, has won wide respect for its effec-
tiveness and humanity. Here castration is
only one factor in treatment, in some
ways a last resort.
As medical superintendent, Dr Stiirup
has charge of about 170 abnormal crimi-
nals. In intelligence their range is equal
to that of the normal outside w'orld. But
their deficiencies of character and con-
science make it inevitable that, without
treatment, they would continue to fall
foul of the law.
Their criminal backgrounds are varied
they include several murderers, thieves
(big and small-time) and defrauders.
About a quarter are sexual offenders, in-
cluding rapists, child-molesters, self-ex-
posers, and pederasts (homosexual acts
between adults are not an offence in Den-
mark). Most them are the so-called
hard cases which other prisons have been
unable to handle.
Dr Stiirup’s achievement has been to
demonstrate that psychopaths of this sort
are not a lost cause, as they were once
regarded, fit only for entombment. Of
the 1,500 who have been in custody here
in the last 25 years, about 1,000 now
manage to live peaceably in society, 100
are in hospitals or elsewhere, and only
400 are in custody in this and other es-
tablishments.
The method here is a compromise be-
tween the need to protect society - from
men who don’t know how dangerous they
are, and Dr Stump’s ambition to re-
generate them and restore them to society
as soon as they are deemed fit for it.
Within the walls Stiirup has created a
community with a high degree of freedom
and relaxation. As he sees it, -only this
allows his inmates the chance to unlearn
their stubborn anti-social patterns and
feel and behave like self-respecting citi-
zens.
This puts at least half the responsibility
for getting out on the prisoner himself.
He must do his best to learn reasonable
social attitudes within the walls, to res-
pond to the psychotherapy which varies
from several hours a week downwards,
according to each prisoner’s needs.
A report from a detention centre
for criminal psychopaths
Stiirup has always insisted that there
must be no degradation of inmates (“the
sentence is enough”), and he believes
that it is chiefly the aggressiveness of most
prison systems which produces a long-
term belligerent attitude in the prisoner.
Before he took over here the guards'were
armed at night. For 20 years they have
carried nothing, not even a baton; in this
time there has been only one severe
attack on a prison officer.
The prison routine is notably unre-
pressive. Stiirup likes to grant as much
trust as possible as part of the redemp-
tive training. The inmates are locked in
their cells only during the dark hours.
In the daytime they work in the prison
workshops, largely unsupervised, though
the door is locked.
Stiirup goes on experimenting with ex-
tensions of freedom. A few inmates are
' allowed out in the daytime, without
guard, to work in factories near by: they
are on parole to return in the evening.
In one block about 20 inmates live almost
as a self-regulating community. There
are no guards, the doors ase locked at
night, but have glass panels, and the
prison wall is only a few yards away.


Question:
Can a simple
accounting machine
from Dundee, Scotland
find true happiness
with a complex
computer system?
Of course they’re happy with com-
puters. NCR accounting machines,
cash registers and adding ma-
chines are built to compile input
data while they do their daily job.
They write down every detail of
each transaction in computer-ese;
on punched cards, punched paper
or optical tape. No translation is
needed, so a costly extra step is
saved. At the end of the day every^
thing can be run off by computer
right away. And in no time, man-
agement has a clear sharp picture
of the day’s business activities
sales analysis, inventory control,
expense and purchase distribu-
tion, and so on.
Yes, NCR accounting equipment
is genuinely happy with complex
systems, because NCR thinks in
terms of total business systems
all the time. And with unequalled
experience in addition to the. com-
plete range of business equip-
ment, NCR offers any kind of
business, however large or small,
a total system tailored exactly to
its requirements.

The time an inmate spends here has
been gradually cut down from four years
in 1935 to the present average of two
and a half years. In some instances, where
the crime was extreme or notorious, the
Court echoing public opinion has
had to reject Stiirup’s recommendation
for parole. One man who committed a
double murder during a bank robbery is
still here after 12 years, though for some
time he has been one of the most eligible
of the trusties.
With many of the persistent sexual
criminals special difficulties arise. Their
deviations often go so deep that they are
not readily susceptible to analysis, given
limited time and staff. In some cases,
such as child-molesters, whose compul-
sions are usually so strong that the fear
of prison is no effective deterrent, it is
harder to recommend early release.
It is in these cases that Stiirup consid-
ers castration to be a rational answer. It
gets the inmate released in about a third
of the time he would normally spend
here say within two years, against the
usual six or seven, and society need be
less afraid of him.
/Castration is selectively used, and with
a genuine concern for the inmate con-
cerned. About 10 a year accept it. Stiirup
says that he would not use castration
purely to protect society and certainly
not for first offenders. He recommends it
only when other therapy appears un-
likely to work and when the man feels
that in the outside world sexuality is
“just a frightening torment to him.”
When castration is offered to an inmate
care is taken to explain all aspects of it
to him and he has an indefinite time in
which to decide. Because of the circum-
stances the offer is clearly not without
some subtle pressures; but every effort
is made to minimise this. In fact, about
a third of the cases to whom it is offered
reject it. Their decision is accepted; they
simply stay longer in custody and, when
they get out, they cling to their “tor-
ment” and not infrequently succumb to it
again.
The surgery takes about 15 minutes.
The testes, including the cells that pro-
duce the male hormone, are extracted
through an incision in the groin. Out-
wardly the genitals are only slightly
changed: There is certainly nothing like
the wholesale mutilation apparently vis-
ualised by the more rabid advocates of
castration for criminals.
Since it is never offered to anyone im-
mature or under the age of 24 the physi-
cal changes in a castrate' are said to be
slight. About a third of them, Stiirup says,
can still manage intercourse; but since
most of the compulsion has gone the
castrate can usually choose to avoid its
illegal forms.
Some of the castrates put on weight,
some who were balding get a new growth
of hair. Their voices do not change.
The castrate is released about six months
after the operation, after he has had
time to adjust himself to it. In the early
stages some complain of lassitude and
lack of initiative, Before long, one is
assured, most settle down and find a new
peace of mind.
I spoke to two pederasts, shortly due
for release after castration. Both said
they were glad they had accepted it. It
is hard to say how far their contentment
was due to self-persuasion. One of them,
who had served several prison sentences
for his offences, had postponed his de-
cision to accept because be believed him-
self in love with another inmate.
Only about a third of the castrations
done in Denmark have been associated
with the prison system. The larger num-
ber is mostly composed of patients in
mental hospitals. There are also a few
others, including priests, teachers, and
others who have chosen castration as the
only solution to the peculiar torment of
being a public figure or man of strict
conscience with, for instance, pederastic
inclinations.
As a crime preventive it shows results.
Only 2 per cent of castrates commit
another sexual offence again after release,
compared with 40 per cent of non-
castrates.
The system, of course, has its critics.
Many analytical psychiatrists feel that
castration is quite unacceptable on moral
and medical grounds, even in the well-
meaning and enlightened context given it
by Stiirup. They suggest that an inmate’s
acceptance of castration cannot be truly
voluntary: he is simply using the surgeon
in a masochistic way to carry out a
terrible punishment for his own guilt.
However disguised, they would say, it
is still an act of revenge by society and
it would be morally harmful to the public
to have to condone it.
Some critics contend that not enough
is known about the castrate’s state of
mind to be sure that desexing has helped
him; and that, until we do, the use of
surgery is a side-track to be approached
with caution, (ofns.)

Letters to the Editor
Antarctica
SIR. —One of the points that I would like
to add as a result of reading John
Bechervaise’s excellent article on the
Antarctic (8., July 3) is that in an organ-
isation such as ANARE influenced over
so many years by that very much above
average leader Dr Philip Law it is inevit-
able that offspring should be expected.
This expedition, which returned this year
from Heard Island, having sailed the
10,745 miles in its own privately
chartered 63-foot schooner Patenela, was
in a way the natural product of those
years of preliminary exploration coupled
with the formation in this country of a
cadre of experienced Antarcticans. Our
successful ascent of Mawson’s Peak on
Big Ben and subsequent scientific ex-
plorations in many ways were related to
those works accomplished by the pioneers
and certainly would not have been pos-
sible had there not been available and
very willing the men necessary for our
sort of private venture.
One of the motivations that caused me
to fashion the expedition was the realisa-
tion that as the peace proceeds so does
the need for the country to offer its youth
what Tennyson has called “a moral
equivalent to war”. The spread of adven-
ture training, the establishment of the
Outward Bound movement and the Duke
of Edinburgh Award are clues to the
realisation of this need. Let us perhaps
to the list of Antarctic potentials of
industry and tourism add that of privately
led scientific adventure with Common-
wealth or public support. It happens in
New Zealand.

Liberals' 3 Corners
SlR.—What utter rubbish your Queens-
land correspondent writes in “3 for the
See-saw” (8., July 3) which comments
on the recent Liberal Convention’s firm
decision for some three-cornered contests
at future State and Federal elections.
“On the surface, it (the decision) had
many of the ingredients which led to the
split of the ALP in Queensland in 1957.”
What are these ingredients? Your corres-
pondent makes the silly statement, but
doesn’t bother with any facts. In fact,
the ingredients are totally different. The
ALP was then one party, the Country
Party/Liberal Coalition is now and
always has comprised two separate
parties with conflicting organisational
interests. There is now preferential
voting. There was not in 1957, and any
analysis of the 1957 vote will show that
even on a 60 per cent exchange of prefer-
ences from one Labor group to the other
(a reasonable enough anticipation in the
then circumstances) the ALP would not
have lost.
“There seems no doubt that the Liberal
Party is making an all-out bid for sole
control of the Queensland Parliament.”
On what authority does this preposterous
allegation rest? No statement by any re-
sponsible Liberal, nor any decision by
any Liberal Executive, Council or Con-
vention, has ever given the slightest basis
for claiming that the Liberal Party will
seek “sole” control of the Queensland
Parliament.
CHARLES PORTER
General Secretary,

SIR.—In your report “Quislings” (8.,
June 12) it could be inferred that Mr
Bruce Kekwick wrote a letter charging
the political leadership of the State
Liberal Party as moribund, etc., in his
position as the State Vice-President of the
Party. Although Tasmanians pride them-
selves on their individualism and very
often personalities come before Party, I
can assure you that Mr Kekwick for
the last year has held no executive posi-
tion in the Party nor have we any evi-
dence that he has withdrawn from Party
membership as he promised to do. In
fact he is a delegate to the forthcoming
State Council and no doubt will be stand-
ing for one of the offices.

TV Newsmakers
SlR.—Your Sam Lipski is to be congratu-
lated on his thoughtful appraisal of the
TV Newsmakers (8., July 10). There is,
no doubt, more that could be said, there
always is on any subject, but nobody
would doubt Mr Lipski’s sincerity or
his capacity for shrewd observation.
There is one point, however, on which
I would like to make a comment; his
figures on comparative audiences on a
“fairly typical” night. “Typical”, of
course, is a matter of opinion, but, even
on the figures given, other facts are quite
relevant. The audiences are not neces-
sarily watching in the sense of looking
and assimilating, the surveys don’t show
that.
Furthermore, it is shown that the com-
mercial station audiences contain a large
proportion of children who were watch-
ing the preceding programmes. The big
majority of the ABC audience, however,
actually switch on at ABC news time, as
the movement of the ratings clearly
demonstrates, and contain, furthermore,
a larger proportion of adults. This is
merely to set the record a little straighten

Sutherland-a
Shot in the Arm
By JOHN CARGHER
Lucia di Lainmennoor. Donizetti. Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne.
The Sutherland - Williamson - Inter-
national - Grand - Opera - Company
could and, with luck, should prove
the shot in the arm opera in Australia
really needs. After only one performance
it is too_ early to make predictions, but
last Saturday’s opening production of
“Lucia di Lammermoor”- legitimately
raises our hopes that the season will
produce more than just a shadowy set-
ting for the undoubted box-office star
at its head.
“Lucia di Lammermoor” is one of the
best of the so-called bel canto operas.
The success of Donizetti’s early operas
inspired Bellini, whose style improved on
Donizetti’s by adding dramatic and
lyric emphasis to the melodic line which
at the beginning of the last century was
restricted (in Italy at least) almost totally
to showing off the agility of the great
voices then prevailing. It is greatly to
Donizetti’s credit that he, in turn,
accepted the innovations of the younger
man to produce superior operas incor-
porating these improvements. “Lucia di
Lammermoor” is a perfect example of
this development, and the fact that later
composers went much further in the
same direction is quite immaterial. The
myth that the bel canto operas are
musically worthless was exploded years
ago, in spite of what certain die-hard
critics still say.
The anachronism of “Lucia” for
English audiences is the spectacle of Sir
Walter Scott’s highland characters having
their fling in Italian. Somehow, Edgardo,
Enrico or Arturo don’t fit into kilts, and
the Scottish element is therefore quite
rightly played down. The story is one
of typical Gothic romanticism. Lucia is
tricked into marriage of convenience by
her brother Enrico through the means
of a forged letter purporting to show the
infidelity of her lover, Edgardo. On her
eventful wedding day she not only
murders her unloved husband following
Edgardo’s unexpected arrival after she
has signed the marriage register, but
also goes mad in opera’s most famous of
mad scenes. In true grand opera fashion,
her lover then commits suicide. All this
was set by Donizetti with considerable
dramatic skill into a major work which
has definite musical continuity. Lucia’s
mad scene has risen to prominence not
through its florid vocal writing, which
has often been equalled, but for its
histrionic aptness which gives an
emotional impact to'the music absent in
other pieces of this type. Donizetti also
uses an early form of leitmotiv,
pioneered by Bellini in “La Sonnambula”
quite independently of Weber who
showed the way to Wagner in Germany.
The production of the Sutherland-Wil-
liamson-etc. season is a good one, though
on a traditional, unimaginative level.
Scenery and costumes are bright and
realistic, the protagonists move in pre-
dictable directions at the right time, and,
to make the stepping into the past even
more realistic, there are long delays
between scenes while the audience sits
in darkness, if not in silence. Neverthe-
less, how much better this than the inept
meddlings of inexperienced producers
with avant garde ideas, which place
“Fidelio” on the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
“Boheme” on the Rock of Gibraltar and
“Faust” in the Museum of Modern Art.
(Elizabethan Theatre Trust, please note.)
Having thus a pedestrian though un-
objectionable setting the ultimate success
of the opera depends on its musical side
and in this the success last Saturday was
as close to ultimate as we are ever likely
to see here. Joan Sutherland was, if
possible, an even better Lucia than we
have heard on record. Obviously, she
has refused to rest on her laurels, but
has worked hard to meet the one criticism
which has been justly levelled at her:
her poor diction. In spite of occasional
slips at emotional moments when all
consonants disappear, there is now little
fault to find on a point which I would
not raise at all, had it not been a bone
of contention in the past. In fact, I must
admit to both pleasure and astonishment
at some of those rolling Rs which are
so necessary to the true beauties of the
Italian language. As for the only other
fault in Miss Sutherland’s singing, which
has been the cause of comment, mainly
by record reviewers, the faint hooting
quality in the middle register: this is
admittedly present on stage but to a
very much lesser degree. Obviously,
this aspect of her singing is unduly
exaggerated in the process of recording.
The rest of the cast should not be
expected to reach Miss Sutherland’s
Olympian heights, but they were worthy
of any average, or even above average,
SUTHERLAND IN THE MAD SCENE. LUCIA DI
LAMMERMOOR.
international opera house. John Alex-
ander is by far the finest tenor we have
heard here in opera for a generation.
Tall, handsome and a fine actor, he has
an even voice without any break in
register, which only misses greatness be-
cause of natural limitations. There is no
tremendous ring which would put him
among the heroic tenors and he has not
the Italian dolcezza. His is an excellent
all-purpose tenor.
The baritone Cornelius Opthof is not
known to me by reputation, but his
inclusion in the season is amply justified.
He has a fine ringing voice, if a little
dry, and he uses it intelligently. Un-
fortunately, his Enrico was not quite
villainous enough, causing the dramatic
balance to suffer. The same can be said
of the surprise success of the evening,
Clifton Grant. In spite of a poor
presence and some abominable English
vowels, this young singer from a local


television chorus fully held his own
vocally against the formidable array of
international voices pitted against his.
His part of Raimondo is a lengthy one,
and in this production most of its' usual
cuts have been restored, as well. The
only other artist who must be mentioned
is Andre Montal, who acted and sang
Arturo in a fashion which made his
murder by Lucia totally understandable.
What of Richard Bonynge? Perhaps
as conductor he accented the tum-ti-tum
parts of the score a little too much at
times, but then Donizetti wrote tum-ti-
tum music and it’s a little late to find
hidden subtleties in a score 130 years old.
More importantly, he carried out the
impetus of the music well and there was
no slackening of pace which, while giving
the artists time to linger on the beauty
of the voice, can bring only boredom
to the audience. The orchestra which
he has assembled is as good as can
reasonably be expected for operas of this
type, and the occasional faulty intonation
may charitably be put down to first-night
nerves.
All in all then, “Lucia di Lammer-
moor” was an auspicious start for the
new opera season, and if this standard is
kept up, Mr and Mrs Bonynge may yet
convince Australia that opera is a good
night’s entertainment and to hell with
culture.
THEATRE
Controversy
The Representative. Rolf Hochhuth. Old
Tote Theatre. Sydney.
Baby Want a Kiss. James Costigan.
Ensemble Theatre, Sydney.
How did it happen that the Nazis were
able to get away with the murder of
five or six million Jews?
Since the war a vast amount has been
written by and about the victims and
survivors of the extermination camps
and their persecutors. But it has often
been remarked that literature, as distinct
from memoirs, does not seem able to
deal with the great catastrophic events
of our time, such as Nazi genocide and
Hiroshima.
“The Representative” is a very
ambitious attempt to deal with the failure
of Europe to stop the Nazi killing of
the Jews. Rolf Hochhuth obligingly
transfers a large share of the burden
of guilt on to the shoulders of the then
Pope, Pius XII.
Others beside Hochhuth, both Catho-
lics . and non-Catholics, have criticised
Pius XII for not speaking out for the
Jews. One argument maintains that the
Pope was wrong in thinking that a
pronouncement from him would have
made things worse, not better, for the
Jews. A second argument, from higher
moral ground, holds that the crime was
so monstrous that the Pope should have
protested, no matter what the cost.
“The Representative” is a presentation
of the first, rather less interesting, view.
Unfortunately, the play has a weakness
very common to thesis plays: the
dramatist has not really managed to
write the argument into his play, but
only his conclusion. He elaborates the
argument for the prosecution, but skimps
on the case for the defence.
The chief protagonist is Riccardo
Fontana, a young Jesuit of aristocratic
family, who is attached to the Papal
Nuncio in Berlin. He hears a first-hand
account of the daily gassing of thousands
of Jews from Kurt Gerstein, a member
of the German Resistance, who leads a
double life as an officer in the SS. (Gers-
tein was an historical person.) From
that point on it becomes Riccardo’s mis-
sion to persuade the Pope to intervene
on behalf of the Jews.
In a climactic scene Riccardo con-
fronts the Pope and demands his inter-
vention. The character of the Pope is
one of the greatest weaknesses of the
play. It is almost a caricature and indeed,
as played by Alexander Hay in this pro-
duction, it is a full-blown caricature.
Cold, posturing and weak, he is shown
as caring more for the power and wealth
of the Church than for ordinary
humanity. Even if the historical Pope
were like this, which is widely denied,
there were good arguments for his
policy, which should have been presented
in the play.
Riccardo, having failed in his mission,
defiantly pins a Star of David to his
soutane and has himself deported to
Auschwitz with a group of Roman Jews
who are Catholic converts.
In discussing the play it is impossible
to confine oneself to the stage version
performed at the Old Tote. This is,
necessarily, only one-third of the length
of the original text. It seems to me that
the original play could well be com-
pressed to acting length, but this would
involve a complete re-writing. In his
adaptation for the Old Tote John Clark
has had to content himself with selected
scenes.
The result is that the scenes them-
selves are long-winded and yet the play
seems thin, because so much has had to
be left out. But the really disastrous
mistake was to have omitted the last
scene, in which Riccardo refuses the
escape contrived for him by Gerstein
and dies at Auschwitz, while Gerstein
himself is arrested. By ending where it
does this production leaves the audience
in mid-air.
Although “The Representative” serves
to remind us of the suffering of the
Jews, it does not really contribute any-
thing to the discussion of the behavior
of Pius XII. In fact, because of the over-
simplification of the issues, the play
becomes tedious, in spite of a careful
production by John Clark and the
generally high standard of performance.
In “Baby Want a Kiss”, James Costi-
gan was apparently unable to decide
whether he wanted to write an avant-
garde satiric comedy criticising the
American way of life, or a spoof on an
avant-garde satiric comedy criticising the
American way of life. By attempting to
do both he has produced a somewhat
muddled play.
As a satire on the American way it
is not nearly as funny nor as pointed as
Albee’s witty and savage play, “The
American Dream”. But as a satire on
the plays of Albee it is very amusing.
Chuck Faulkner as Emil and Barbara
Wyndon as Mavis seemed a little uneasy
in their roles when I saw them, but
Brian Young obviously enjoyed himself
as the bewildered Edward.

Decoy Not Trap
Trap for a Lonely Man. Robert Thomas.
St Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
Everything about this play is ingeniously
misleading. The title of the French
original was “Piege”, which can mean
decoy as well as trap. It’s a decoy rather
than a trap story, and the lonely man
has been tacked on for mystification.
Psychology does not come into it.
The true thriller has suffered from
the inroads of television, but this is not
a true thriller. It’s Grand Guignol in
modern dress. I think it would have been
far better to discard the up-to-date back-
ground and stage it without apology as
a period piece, transferred to the gas-
light, or even an earlier, period. This
would have meant doing without one
latter-day detection device which plays
a minor and unconvincing part in the
last scene, but would have made the
general implausibility more acceptable.
It could have turned a mildly intriguing
and fairly clever whodunit into a thunder-
ingly good melodrama.
The cast obviously felt the same.
Whenever any member tried to take his
role seriously we were immediately aware
of strain, whereas, each time there was
a piece of full-blooded buffoonery or
cloak-and-dagger work, the spark jumped
the footlights. This left the impression
of an under-rehearsed show, which in
fact it may not have been.
The action cannot be told, since every
detail of the plot could become a clue
to its solution. The main ruse that keeps
it going is the disappearance of a wife
shortly after her honeymoon, and the
arrival of a woman who, to the con


sternation of the husband, claims to be
his missing Elizabeth. This kind of idea
has produced many a first-rate “Maigret”
episode. What makes it unlike “Maigret”
are the old-fashioned poisonings or
would-be poisonings, and the somewhat
too far-fetched schemings which, as the
audience sees it, involve a whole platoon
of villains corrupted by a couple of
Lucifers.
- ?a S
Moira Carleton’s direction has vivid
moments but lacks tempo, especially in
the first act in which the husband’s
frenzy provides the chief interest. Donald
MacDonald and Alan Lander, two
Sydney actors, play M. Corban (the
deserted spouse) and the cure, with too
little variety in one case and wrong
emphasis in the other: This odd man of
God does not wear his soutane with the
dignity, false or proper, which is
demanded. Sydney Conabere’s police
inspector does not project a dominating
personality, but manages some nice
shadings. Judith Arthy is the claimant,
better in her sinister aspects than in the
feminine ones which are needed to
balance them. Kenric Hudson, the vaga-
bond-cum-painter with a vital piece of
evidence, comes out best of all. In this
part he could not go wrong
The onlookers enjoyed it.

FILMS
Utter Madness
Seance on a Wet Afternoon. Director, Bryan
Forbes. Savoy Theatre, Sydney.
First shown at the Sydney Film Festival,
this strange, atmospheric film repays a
second viewing. Though on the surface
a thriller, it probes much more deeply
into the human heart, and relies on the
creation of a mood rather than on ac-
tion for its effect. Based on an oddball
novel by Mark McShane, the story deals
with a suburban spiritualist medium and
her devoted, long-suffering husband who
engage on a kidnap plot. But the film,
developing with deceptive quietness, re-
veals the woman’s motives and her mad-
ness: the rational beginnings of her
mania loving memory of a dead
child, faith in her own extra-sensory
powers have grown into a monstrous
obsession that even her husband is un-
able to withstand.
Bryan Forbes, deliberately avoiding
the obvious melodrama, directs “Seance”
at a slow, almost dreamy pace which
only rarely loses its hold. (An unsuccess-
ful sequence with the kidnapped child’s
parents can be blamed in some part on
the really awful drama-school acting of
the two players involved, although Nan-
ette Newman as the mother manages
some quite touching moments later at
the seance.)
Forbes’ direction and the generally
distinguished camerawork by Gerry Tur-
pin are occasionally repetitive, but the
long sequence of the delivery of the ran-
som money (shot without dialogue) grips
like a vice, and could be used by any
budding director or photographer as an
object lesson in the use of film as a
visual medium.
Kim Stanley gives a virtuoso perform-
ance as the obsessed medium: except for
the few terrible moments in which she is
forced to face reality, she is cushioned in
schizophrenic calm, and her final retreat
into complete lunacy involves no scream-
ing or gibbering she sinks into mad-
ness as into a feather bed, with sensuous
relief. Richard Attenborough as her
husband adds another remarkable
characterisation to his distinguished re-
cord, and even makes one almost over-
look the plot’s basic weakness the
improbability of his utter acquiescence
in a scheme that he knows to be insane
and wicked.
These two players so dominate the film
that the other characters are mere sha-
dows, except for Marian Spencer (the
kidnapped child), who comes across
strongly not (thank goodness) as a lov-
able cherub but as an argumentative,
smart-alecky, thoroughly believable
little girl.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUSIC
Alien Species
Musica Viva Subscription Concert. Vienna
Octet. Sydney Town Hall.
An addition of wind players to estab-
lished chamber music forms invites the
composer to a corresponding expansion
of range, while also constructing a greater
number of pitfalls to be overcome before
his work can be considered as musically
successful. The already countless textural
possibilities of the string quartet (per-
haps best illustrated in the works of
Bartok and Berg) are even further aug-
mented by the integration of these in-
dividual wind timbres. Invariably, their
particular destroying flaw can be directly
related to an overall inability in reconcil-
ing what are two completely alien instru-
mental species.
The Vienna Octet, by choosing to per-
form the Mozart Divertimento in D
Major and Beethoven’s E Flat Major Sep-
tet, demonstrated the possible solutions
to this intriguing musical problem. Mo-
zart overcame the difficulty by creating a
unifying tension between the separate
groups. Of the devices employed to bring
about this cohesion, the technique of
“call and answer” phrases was by far the
most frequent and effective. It was here
that we gained the first opportunity to
enjoy the immaculate phrasing and dy-
namic control of this amazing group of
players. Each passage was painstakingly
moulded in the Mozartian manner, and
its complementary came, not merely as
the counterweight, but as a fresh and
subtler emphasis to the original state-
ment.
Viennese blood must certainly have
warmed at the provincial and then ele-
gant treatment of the two Minuettos of
the Divertimento. The first, a “Laendler”,
was approached with a fitting air of
peasant heaviness. In contrast, the second
was accorded the lightness and grace of
a classical Minuet, a well-founded read-
ing when we realise that the Trio section,
with its bassoon and horn duet, looks
back to the mannered times of Handel’s
suites.
Those who would like to fully analyse
his music are continually baffled by
Beethoven’s staggering capacity for the
compounding of both structural and
thematic ideas. This ability to create a
credible whole from seemingly irreconcil-
able elements is well demonstrated in the
Septet Op. 20. So skilful is the interweav-
ing of the clarinet, bassoon and horn
parts with the strings, that when the work
is performed with the meticulous atten-
tion to detail which the Vienna Octet
gave, these instruments seem to emerge
not as individuals, but as contributors
towards a combined texture. Thus Beet-
hoven has achieved through confluence
what Mozart achieved through the ten-
sions of contrast.
The Septet is an expansive work which
allows each performer to display both his
technical and expressive capabilities.
Alfred Boskavsky’s clarinet-playing was
delightfully agile and clear, his pure tone
often blending with the harmonics in
which the ’cellist so frequently indulged.
Although he showed a tendency towards
rough bow changes, the leader, Anton
Fietz, left little doubt as to the position of
the seat of power. European tradition
requires that each member of a chamber
group look to the leader, not only for
tempo but for phrasing and dynamics as
well, and one feels that this admirable
practice was theTactor which contributed
most to the incredible precision and con-
sequent vitality of the performance. Out-
standing among the string players was
the bassist, whose tone was as sonorous
as his old French-style bowing technique
was fascinating.

vels in its popular saccharinity. It is a
virtuoso work par excellence, never
played badly.
Well, it wasn’t like that at all! Paul
Serebryakov,' the ABC’s current visiting
celebrity, is indeed unknown to us. He
has spent much of his working life teach-
ing and as director of the Leningrad
Conservatorium, hence had little time to
become known as a pianist outside the
Soviet Union. But he turned out to be
no brash young pianist; he is a true
pianist, of the old school, with flowing
white mane and both the appearance
and the manner of a seasoned musician.
When I was in my teens, Rachman-
inoff was our idol; he was very hand-
some, had the romantic look of an “art-
ist” and, unlike most great pianists,
even had beautiful hands. At the stumpy
hands of Serebryakov, the second piano
concerto was revealed as much more
than an agreeable confection. It is
undoubtedly a little too long for its
content, but in this performance it
emerged as an organic whole, rhapsodic
rather than dramatic. Serebryakov’s
playing was of a remarkable clarity,
enchanting in his stylish acceleration dur-
ing the lovely slow movement, almost
dancing through the solid accents of the
final Allegro.
The pianist's performance, transform-
ing something known as rather ordinary
into a musical experience, would have
failed without the orchestra’s meticulous
collaboration. Dixon led them in such a
way that the pianist was correctly sup-
ported at every move, and the balancing
of forces was all one could wish for.
In the concerto, every section of the
orchestra was near-perfect. For the rest
of the evening, Dixon could be reason-
ably satisfied with his orchestra’s pro-
gress; they sounded better than they
had under Dorati’s baton, but a few
weaknesses remain. Weber’s “Euryanthe”
Overture, treated as pure music rather
than as part of a theatrical entertainment,
will no doubt receive some attention
and be tidied up before it is repeated.
The woodwind section, of which each
member is absolutely first-class, failed
to sound like a true ensemble this even-
ing, a failing that was rather obvious
during Beethoven’s 7th Symphony.
I admire Dean Dixon and, at pre-
sent, our orchestra, but I was not alto-
gether satisfied with the Seventh. The
slow movement played andante rather
than allegretto was simply glorious and
the following scherzo was absolutely
right. In Dixon's reading, however, the
first and fourth movements did not seem
to have any logical connection with these
middle ones. They were played with a
teutonic rigor and the kind of dramatic
emphasis that one might expect from a
Furtwangler and that, this warm sym-
phony can well do without.

BOOKS
Warwick Fairfax’s Philosophy
By G. STUART WATTS
The Triple Abyss: Towards a Modern Syn-
thesis. Warwick Fairfax. Geoffrey Bles.
565. 6d.
It is always moving to read the literary
harvest of a lifetime of serious reflection
upon the great issues of thought, life and
death, particularly when, as in the present
case, it is the effort of a liberal, scholarly,
highly cultivated and deeply religious
mind. Indeed, in reading this book, I
envisaged its author as the first of a line
of Australian Anglican lay theologians
comparable with those who have con-
tributed so much to the intellectual activ-
ity of the Holy Orthodox Churches. This
appreciation of the many fine qualities
of Mr Fairfax’s book should be borne
in mind when I register disagreement
with him on many points.
Mr Fairfax is a' distinguished Austra-
lian. a member of a well-known journal-
istic family, who was educated here and at
Oxford, and has had a wide experience in
intellectual, artistic, and practical fields.
He has written two. plays, which have
been performed in Sydney; and I may say
at once that the brief section on aesthetics
is one of the best things in the book. He
is at home in the spiritual classics of both
East and West; and his honesty (even
where, as I believe, he is confused),
sincerity and humility at once arouse and
secure interest in and attention for his
proposed synthesis of personal, cosmic,
and religious insights, even if one finally
rejects it.
I attempt a brief summary of this
work before I offer some criticisms. In
the theory of knowledge which is out-
lined, consciousness is directly inspected
and, following Indian thought, five
aspects are specified: experience in time,
and of space; desire; intention, or will;
knowledge; energy or power.
In discussing consciousness, Fairfax
criticises A. J. Ayer and John Anderson
for their “persistent attempt to evade
direct awareness of mind or thought”
in their respective treatments of Descar-
tes’ Cogito, ergo sum, “I think, therefore
I am”. Unlike William James and Ander-
son, who treat consciousness as a relation
between mind and its objects, Fairfax
views it as the individual’s voluntary
transcendence of the objective series of
related things and his sharing in a subjec-
tive movement towards cosmic unity.
Later, he argues that the very exis-
tence of relations between things implies
an “awareness”, a “truly mystical and
non-material relation” between them
which, in its turn, implies “a mystic
Wholeness within and beyond the cos-
mos”. So far as knowledge is concerned,
it is the “immaterial” mind, or the self
whose inner essence or source of
energy seems to be immaterial, which
knows. The soul is in the region of super-
consciousness, and plays the principal
part in directing the whole organism.
But the “object” known is not, as we
would suppose, the thing known; it is the
union, to some extent, of a knower and
the thing known. Thus the known object
is not strictly “in the mind” or, indeed,
“in the thing”.
Questions about behavior and its rea-
sons or motives lead Fairfax to consider
psychology and ethics, where he reaches
the conclusion that standards and values,
being meaningful, point to a synthetic end
or absolute good in which the individual
has the privilege of sharing. From this
emphasis on unity it will be readily seen
how close is the resemblance between
Fairfax's outlook and that of Hindu
Brahminism.
Discussing physical theories of the
universe, he maintains that immaterial
mind is energy, spirit is “completely
abstract energy”, and God is the source
and creator of energy. Classical Chris-
tian doctrines are supported by citations
from the sacred books of other religions
A close resemblance between
Fairfax’s outlook and that of
Hindu Brahminism.
as well as the Bible, and receive a “new
look” here and there by the importation
of theosophical terms such as “etheric
body” (instrument of one’s particularised
life force), “astral body” (vehicle of one’s
feelings and personality), and “reincar-
nation”, which the author is “more than
inclined to believe possible”. Extra-sen-
sory perception (telepathy, precognition,
clairvoyance, etc.) is treated as a fact
and is used to explain various incidents
reported in the New Testament.
This brief sketch, I fear, conveys
little or nothing of the author’s careful
and scholarly presentation of his case,
or of the deep religious convictions which
inspire it. At a time when so many theo-
logians are engaged in “demythologising”
and “secularising” the Gospel, it is re-
freshing to find a Christian thinker
courageous enough to challenge the world
from a definite doctrinal standpoint in-
stead of performing logical acrobatics to
attract and interest the indifferent masses.
WARWICK FAIRFAX
I turn now to a few criticisms among
the many which could be offered. If
Anderson did say, as Fairfax alleges,
without giving the references, that he
would like to banish mind from philo-
sophy, then essays like the remarkable
“Mind As Feeling” (in which Anderson
presents a carefully worked-out theory
of mind) would supply a clue to what he
meant: a strong disapproval of certain
rationalist theories of mind which make
a scientific account of mind impossible,
and/or an attempt to stress the fact that
it is the task of psychology, not of philo-
sophy, to discover and discuss the content
of mind and to contrast with its pursuits.
Further, Fairfax is not fair to Ander-
son on the latter’s treatment of Descartes’
Cogito. The point is that, while the utter-
ance of any statement could be said to
imply thinking, it does not imply that
the speaker is “a substance whose whole
essence or nature consists only in think-
ing”; this was the main target of Ander-
son’s attack.
Fairfax’s misunderstanding of Ander-
son’s ethics is serious; he wanted scientific
ethics, centring in objective qualities (love
of inquiry, love of beauty, benevolence,
etc.) possessing freedom, progress,
creativity, in themselves, not aiming at
them as goals. The study of mandatory
morality, with its “dull-witted dis-
sertations about duty”, would be a
secondary study in such a subject.
I should also very much like to know
where the “powerful arguments and
strong evidence” for reincarnation are to
be found; I know of none.
What, oh, what, is “an absolute cer-
tainty” which is “supra-logical”? Flow can
we bring “into the light of reason truths
which are beyond reason”?
What is the unformed, unlimited Sub-
ject which, uncaused, yet causes; which
is baseless, yet the basis of all; without


attributes, yet bringing forth all attrib-
utes?
Why treat as a serious thinker the self-
styled “God, the Truth Absolute”, Meher
Baba, whose disciples eagerly await his
breaking silence (he hasn’t spoken for
years) to proclaim his godhead to all
men?
Why place such emphasis upon the
discredited Design Argument for theism,
or treat telepathy, etc., if confirmed
scientifically, as necessarily supernatural-
ist? Or cite a biblical passage regarded
by all scholars as spurious (I John 5:7)
as a proof-text of the Trinity?
It is questionable whether a synthesis
between philosophy and religion is pos-
sible or desirable, because of their very
different natures and tasks. But if such
a thing did come about, it is safe to
predict that it would be undermined at
once by further philosophical speculation!
“In the Centre of Things”
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
No Love Lost. Patricia Rolfe. Macmillan.
3°s.
Admirers of Patricia Rolfe’s short stories
will welcome her first novel, a highly
diverting and briskly written chronicle
about Australian expatriates in London.
It has the acid-drop flavor, the ironic de-
tachment and the deliciously delicate
ear for conversational nuances that mark
all her best stories. Many of her char-
acters' are oddities but they never topple
over into caricature. Any Australian who
has ever lived and worked in London
will recognise them. I’m sure I could put
a real name to at least a few of them,
though I must say that, seen through
the prism of Miss Rolfe’s imagination,
they seem somewhat richer and more
entertaining than they did in propria per-
sona.
The novel’s central character, how-
ever, is Victoria Gatacre, a healthily
normal and ingenuous young woman
from the sheep-lands of Gundi Gundi.
She’s like hundreds of others who take
off every year after being photographed
lunching at Romano’s cabined with
one or-two friends in a one-class liner
and armed with a decent, but not rashly
over - generous, bundle of traveller’s
cheques. Vicky's experiences in London,
and her progressive disenchantment with
the seedy people with whom she gets
herself involved, form the theme of the
book.
Vicky’s romantic illusions centre on
Allen Carpenter, a middle-aged literary
mediocrity and an expatriate since the
19305. He is an unendearing, run-down
character who suffers from pyorrhoea as
well as general gutlessness. But to Vicky
he represents the heroic age of the Inter-
national Brigade. Auden, Isherwood and
Co. (“Tell me, when you were in Spain
did you ever actually meet Hemingway?”
she asks, as he rests his greying head on
, her sturdy young diaphragm). Carpenter
wants to be left in peace and wallow in
his failure. Vicky is determined to drag
him off to a Greek island to drink wine
with the peasants and write the great un-
written book. It is all very exhausting for
poor Carpenter.
Round Vicky and her reluctant lover
Miss Rolfe assembles an entertaining
crowd of figures, Aussies and Brits, whom
she brings to life with acidulous expertise.
The Earl’s Court Cowboy, dispensing
“vino” and thunderous platitudes at the
exiles’ parties, is more or less a stock
character. So are the nice energetic girls
from Pymble and the station homesteads.
Where Miss Rolfe scores is in her pic-
ture of the rat-baggier side of expatriate
life in London, among the artists and
writers who have simply failed to make
it, but who are doggedly dedicated to
the proposition that they must remain
“in the centre of things”.
Among them we meet Edgar Gribble,
of the oyster eyes and grubby suede
waistcoat, a failed poet and literary con-
man who is obsessed by the fear that his
acquaintances will find out that he is not
homosexual. Elsie Birdwell (we all know
PATRICIA ROLFE
her ) is the professional Aussie who burns
gumleaves at parties, recites “The Sick
Stock Rider” at the drop of a wide-brim-
med hat and gets on BBC Television on
the Queen’s Birthday. Elsie suffers a
macabre and Waughish fate, being burned
to death when her hair catches fire from
the smouldering gumleaves; she is cre-
Sand
You can make castles of it, construct
The flying buttresses, gold cannons,
where
Wind beats down from the sad Pacific—
Make the tall walls elegant and straight,
Carve slits to watch through as the army
comes
With stealthy tread across the white,
ribbed sand.
Set on the top a thin and tossing flag—
Let it crack bravely like a gun’s report
Snapping straight, its linen pressed by
breeze
And put the writhing seahorses down
On the drawbridge made of bits of wood
from a ship—
Dig out a moat for the sea to gurgle in.
And finally, when at dusk after a day of
labor
You are alone, stand naked in the centre,
The only time you can be a warrior—
Braving the sea’s clashing shields to ride
You down, your gawk arms raw, a
rusted spade
Clutched in your hand, and a drum of
heat
Rapped in your chest till the bold green
quiets it.

But they do eye you. Animals don't.

mated to the accompaniment of “Waltz-
ing Matilda” and a TV newsreel salute.
The Brits are chiefly represented by
Vicky's fellow-workers, the two battered
but indomitable ladies who edit the
“Gentlewoman” magazine, and by a
writer and mistress who live on a high
intellectual plane in one of the uglier
parts of Bedfordshire amid a litter of
untended children, inedible food and
copies of the “New Statesman”.
It’s all great fun for a while, so dif-
ferent from life in Pymble or Gundi Gun-
di. But Vicky never really makes much
contact with ordinary everyday London.
When disenchantment sets in she is quite
ready to go home. We see her last (or
first, actually, for the whole story is a
long flashback) on her honeymoon on
the Greek island she was always prat-
tling about. But not with Allen Carpenter,
who has finally got around to killing him-
self. Vicky’s husband is a handsome,
clean-living young man from the bush.
The whole business was water off Vicky’s
back, though she’ll go on talking about
the fascinating episode of her life in
London for the rest of her life.
“No Love Lost” is an excellent book.
Patricia Rolfe writes with elegance and
wit, and she is much too experienced
to fall into the traps of pretentiousness
that beset the paths of many first novels.
A Sydney James Joyce?
By PETER GOUGH
The Fear. Thomas Keneally. Cassell.
275. 6d.
A couple of weeks ago, as I flicked
over the pages of the annual of an Aus-
tralian Catholic seminary, I was taken by
surprise at the sporty, Rugby League
conviviality that charged its format.
However, on deeper reflection, such an
atmosphere is far from surprising, since
the rich, Irish content of Australian
Catholicism is more concerned with the
material structure of the Church and the
common interests of men than with the
spiritual subtleties of speculative theolo-
gians, saints and mystics.
It was at this time last year that Mr
Thomas Keneally in a most talented first-
novel, “The Place at Whitton”, wrote
about this same seminary, not in the day-
to-day terms of young men who love
sport and happen to be studying for the
priesthood, but in that other-world con-
frontation of sin, grace, prayer, vice and
charity.
And now attention is again drawn to
Mr Keneally with the current publica-
tion of a second novel, “The Fear”, the
story of an eight-year-old Catholic boy,
Danny Jordan, growing up amidst the
adult problems that were set in violent
motion by the peculiar circumstances of
Australia-at-war in the 19405.
Although Thomas Keneally draws
elaborately on a rare capacity for des-
criptive insights that project with colorful
pictures the mundane events of suburban
and country households, nevertheless the
fascination that Keneally holds for Aus-
tralian readers lies in his deep sense of
tragedy and the cold proximity of sin,
death and darkness.
Initiation into the horrors of death
strikes early upon Danny Jordan with the
violent deaths of two young friends
through the mishandling of a high ex-
plosive. This shadow of death looms
again on the impressionable mind of
Danny as his next-door neighbor, the
mother of one of the dead boys, suicides
and takes to the grave with her the only
remaining child, the sick and crippled
Joseph.
But it would be false to portray Ken-
eally in the obsessive garb of a writer
hacking away at a black gloom. The Irish
blood of his forebears and his earthy
Australian conscience free him from any
sickly introspection of characters. In
order to dispel any wavering doubts on
that score the following makes worthy
evidence:
‘‘Father Mullaly downed the last of
his smahan, shook his head, both deliber-
ately.
“‘You know/ he said softly, ‘I was
a late vocation to the priesthood. I’d
spent five years training horses in New-
bridge, County Kildare. And when God
in His boundless wisdom called me, there
was many a pallid little seminarian from
sod huts in Cavan, or some such barbar-
ous place, traipsing to my door in that
damned cold seminary in Carlow, trying
to make me a :otal abstainer. But I
always yelled in their faces, ‘Vinwn quod
laetificat cor hominis!’
“ ‘Vinum . . . ?’
“ ‘Wine,’ declared the priest, ‘which re-
joices the heart of man. Wine in this
case being a generic term covering Clon-
mel whisky. Have another drop, Finnie
Gavan?’ ”
In manner of summary, there seems
small doubt that Thomas Keneally is
one of the most exciting events to arrive
on the Australian literary front. The
great passion that he bears in his heart
for words to express man in his ephem-
eral and eternal gropings gives rise to
high hopes that what James Joyce did
for Dublin, in a fashion, Thomas Ken-
eally will articulate for Sydney.

Castro and the CIA
By J. R. FLYNN
The Bay of Pigs. Haynes Johnson. Hutchin-
son. 51s.
Haynes Johnson conducted intensive
interviews with the Cuban exiles who
participated in the ill-fated Bay of Pigs
invasion of Castro’s Cuba in April of
1961. He also drew upon the resources
of the Washington journalist, namely,
“informed” sources and Washington
gossip, in an attempt to piece together
the full story of how the invasion was
planned, how it was fought, and how the
captured invasion force was finally
ransomed. The result is this book.
“The Bay of Pigs” affords us some im-
portant new facts. But it is marred by
certain omissions which seem to reflect
the author’s likes and dislikes. To cite
the facts first. Johnson presents impres-
sive evidence that the plan to use the
Cuban exiles primarily as a conventional
invasion force, rather than as guerrillas,
was formulated by the CIA
before Kennedy came into
office. Since this was one
of the most obvious blun-
ders that led to the defeat
of the exile forces, it can
now be said on Kennedy’s
behalf that he inherited this
aspect of the ClA’s plan
rather than approving it as
a change in tactics.
Also relevant to Ken-
nedy’s culpability is the
question of whether or not
he was exposed to the case
that could be made against
the whole invasion project. Other
journalists, for example Tad Szulc of
the “New York Times” and Karl Meyer
of the “Washington Post”, assert that
Senator Fullbright warned Kennedy of
the dangers involved in a full-dress meet-
ing on April 4, 1961. Ftfilbright had
earlier stated his case in a memo. John-
son, relying on the word of his inform-
ants, denies that Fullbright spoke up on
April 4.
Those who have dealt with Washington
informants know how difficult it is to
establish their reliability. My . own
“authoritative sources” assure me that
Fullbright put his case to Kennedy in-
formally at an earlier date. However,
whether Fullbright argued with the Presi-
dent or not, he did send him his memo.
Johnson omits any discussion of the
Fullbright memo and in general tends
to exonerate Kennedy.
The question of how difficult the exile
force would have found it to establish a
government raises the question of Castro’s
popular support within Cuba in April of
1961. And here we encounter the second
set of Johnson’s likes and dislikes; that
is, he admires the men of the exile in-
vasion force and he despises Castro. We
get only indirect hints that Castro en-
joyed widespread popular support.
Perhaps more important, the reader,
assuming that he catches the hints that
Castro enjoyed real popular support at
the time of the invasion, is left with an.
inexplicable dilemma: why was Castro
popular? It is foolish for those of us who
have been disillusioned by some of
Castro’s actions, the failure to hold elec-
tions, the censorship of the Press, etc.,
to pretend that he did nothing that
needed doing in Cuba. Johnson refers to
the welfare programmes that won Castro
popular support only tangentially; for ex-
ample, the roads Castro built to link the
depressed Bay of Pigs area to the rest of
Cuba are mentioned only
because they were the
battlefield on which
Castro's forces and the
exile forces fought. The
chief thesis proposed to
explain Castro’s support is
that the youth had been
brainwashed.
Some of Johnson's at-
tacks on Castro seem a bit
far-fetched. Twice we are
told that when Castro
rounded up suspects after
an air attack signalled the
beginning of the invasion
effort instituted a “reign of terror'’.
The indictment seems to come down to
this: 200,000 people were rounded up;
they were not segregated by sex and age;
5000 of them were put in a movie
theatre with only two bathrooms. There
are many solid criticisms one can level at
Castro but there is no need to be so silly.
No doubt, if Castro had segregated chil-
dren from adults, he would be charged
with brutally separating children from
their parents. Two bathrooms seem
pretty much par for a movie theatre and
Castro had better things to do with his
militia during the invasion than to set
them to constructing toilets.
This is an informative book essential
to all serious students of the" Kennedy
Administration and the Cuban invasion
decision, but readers would do well to
balance Johnson’s account with that of
other journalists, for example, with
Szulc and Meyer’s book, “The Cuban
Invasion”.

“Do not judge others , or you yourselves will he judged ” (Matt., Ch. 7, V. 1.)
By PETER GOUGH
Brendan Dineen had slept for eight
long and peaceful hours. It was
only the gross roar of the rising-
bell at St Kevin’s College, Dublin, that
jolted him out of his deep sleep. In a
bitter mood, he poured scorn on the
audacity of the spiritual writers in
describing the seminary, bell as the vox
Dei —the voice of God. But on a Dublin
mid-February morning, he thought, this
was stretching the cause of theology a
bit too far.
There was nothing he could do, how-
ever, except get up and dress. He left
his bed slowly and unsurely and, in an
uncertain step, like a sick man, switched
on the light. But Dineen was far from
unwell, and, in fact, at twenty-six was in
superb health. Now out of bed and on
his feet, Dineen felt more sure of him-
self. He threw his pyjamas aside, and in
a flurry of arm jerkings he quickly
donned a T-shirt and three grimy
sweaters. A muffled yawn followed,
and then the routine of trousers, socks
and shoes.
He was beginning to feel more at ease
with his surroundings. The poky room
of single bed, chair, table and wash-
basin had been his life for the past six
years, far removed from his spacious
room in the family home at Malvern,
Victoria. But Brendan Dineen felt no
grouch as he grabbed his shaving brush
and rubbed some cream over his bristled
face. He smiled within himself—it was
just another day at St Kevin’s.
As his mind started to turn over, the
Reverend Brendan Dineen, a deacon of
the Holy Roman and Catholic Church,
began to feel happy with his lot. In
four short months, mid-June, he would
be ordained in the college chapel to the
eternal priesthood—the goal of his long
seminary labors.
It was, however, a short-lived consola-
tion. The startling toll of the five-minute
bell swore out that he had to move
quickly in order to make his place in
chapel on time. He grabbed a ragged
surplice as he left his room and walked
briskly down the long grey corridor in
the direction of the senior chapel.
Dineen was not alone. Doors along the
corridor were opening and closing, and
young seminarists of varied abilities and
inclinations, at least for these few
desperate minutes, shared the common
aim of being in chapel on time.
At 6.28 a.m., Dineen and the 250
seminarists of St Kevin’s knew only one
thing was required of them: to be in
chapel on time. At last reaching the
entrance to the chapel, Dineen weaved
a path to his back stall on the gospel side
of the church. In the luxury of his own
position, Dineen permitted himself a
furtive glance to the Dean’s Prie-dieu at
the back of the chapel. The Dean,
Father Hackett, was present and his eyes
were roving those present. Anyone un-
lucky to be absent without permission
would be expected to report to the Dean
and give an account of himself.
For the third time within 30 minutes
the scream of the bell sounded through
the college on this cold and sleepy
Dublin morning. A weariness came
upon Dineen and his mind surrendered
to a cosy half-sleep. The morning
prayers lasted for five minutes. After
morning or community prayers, the
college timetable made an allowance for
25 minutes of private prayer or medi-
tation.
The litany was still being garbled as
a slightly stooped and aged priest ambled
slowly out to say mass. Dineen, seeing
that Father Murphy was to celebrate, at
once warmed to the occasion. Father
Murphy was held in high regard by
Dineen. The old priest taught philoso-
phy, and Dineen had attended his classes
during his first two years at St Kevin’s.
Philosophy was hardly Dineen’s cake.
And all the scholastic crap that Father
Murphy espoused on essence and
existence left him cold. But Dineen knew
his man, and had immediately recog-
nised Father Murphy as a friend. After
all, it was rare to find an Irishman inter-
ested in cricket.
Another Day
The silence that ran through the
chapel after community prayer shook
Dineen out of his drowsiness. After six
years the routine had become part of
him. and already he was aware that
meditation, the love-child of the spiritual
writers, was expected of him. Dineen
was not unprepared for this spiritual
confrontation. The previous night he
had decided to go to the root of the
spiritual life, and this morning he would
meditate on the Holy Trinity.
In a slow movement he lifted himself
from his kneeling posture and slumped
back into his choir-stall. Dineen was
now a familiar sight to those opposite
him: his arms heavily planted on the
rests, and his head buried deeply in his
raised hands. The Trinity. And his
opening thought was highly orthodox:
“One God and Three Persons”, but that
was all.
Now the mind of Dineen left the
spiritual realities of God and the Trinity
' and gave way to the ease and sunshine
of the Gold Coast. There and then he
decided to spend his first holiday after
ordination at Surfers'. It was a consoling
thought; the sort of experience that
makes you feel cosy and contented—
the world was not such a bad place, and
at that moment he knew he would find
happiness in the priesthood.
A sacristan carrying a lighted taper
walked briskly to the main altar and lit
two candles. This was a signal to the
duty prefect that the time for meditation
had ended and the community mass was
about to be celebrated. The cue was
taken, and immediately the prefect
rattled out the great names of the saints:
“St Peter,” said the prefect. “Pray for
us,” faintly responded the seminarists.
A half smirk crossed Dineen’s face
as he recalled many an informed talk
with Father Murphy on the great sum-
mer game. They had even exchanged
cricket books. Philosophy had never
once been mentioned in those pleasant
hours spent together by the fire in Father
Murphy’s room. Dineen could under-
stand the Irish hating the English, but,
he held, cricket should be kept out of
such things.
It was a most orderly ceremony. The
seminarists stood for the gospel, and
then knelt and sat during the proper
times. And apart from a faint ringing
of the sanctuary bell on a few occasions,
the privacy of all present was strictly
observed.
There was, of course, a slight ruffle
as the seminarists received communion.
But, even here, there was as little fuss as
possible. The distribution of com-
munion was so regular that Dineen re-
ceived the Lord and was back in his
place without a single thought passing
through his head.
Mass had ended before Dineen re-
covered his senses, but there was no hesi-
tation on his part. It was all so familiar,
the habit acquired over the years. He
left chapel immediately and hurried to
his room to make his bed. There would
be a ten-minute breather before the
seminarists assembled for breakfast.
Dineen became happier with the thought
of food. He was, as usual, feeling
ferociously hungry.
★ ★ ★
Father Hackett gave a nod to the
senior prefect and breakfast was finished.
The rough screech of 250 chairs being


pushed out-and-in was the next move in
the ritual of St Kevin’s refectory.
All the seminarists stood as Father
Hackett said the prayer after meals: “We
give Thee thanks Almighty God for all
Thy benefits Who lives and reigns forever
and ever.”
And the students, including Dineen,
now happily bloated on porridge and
bread, gave a hearty “Amen”.
This brought to a close the summum
silent in m— the great No talking
was permitted among the students at
St Kevin's between evening prayer and
breakfast. It was an old monastic
custom to help the monks keep their
thoughts fixed on the eternal verities.
But the “Amen” put an end to silence.
And the din of 250 voices made a knife-
like incision through the cold and still
Dublin morning.
These few and carefree minutes were
most popular with Dineen. And the
climax was still to come: the first deep
draw of the day's first cigarette. Dineen
was already fondling a cigarette in the
pocket of his soutane as he made his
way to the refectory door, and in his
first step beyond the refectory he juggled
a lighted cigarette into his eager lips.
But in this, Dineen was only one of the
crowd most of the students ~ were
smoking as they left breakfast.
The seminarists started moving around
the quadrangular walk. It was a favorite
haunt with St Kevin's men; traditionally
the conversation was light and the
smoking heavy. Dineen scored as an
honors man on both counts, but his
reputation did not achieve good Irish-
Australian relations: the Irish were
forced to admit that Dineen was the
greatest bummer of cigarettes in all Ire-
land.
In the flurry of groupings, Dineen
found himself flanked by an off-beat pair,
Shannon and Carlin; both were con-
sidered to be outside the St Kevin's
mould, and the college council was said
to be disturbed by their avid interest in
the theology of the Ecumenical Council,
an event that Dineen had totally ignored.
But Dineen had long heard, and be-
lieved, the worst: Shannon and Carlin
were intellectuals. The two Irish semi-
narists gave Dineen open smiles of greet-
ing. They seemed amused at the idea of
walking with the Australian. And, by
way of recognition, Dineen made some
common remark about the weather.
“Brendan,” said an animated Shannon,
“I was just telling Carlin about Graham
Greene’s latest triumph.” There was
only a faint simulation of interest regis-
tered by Dineen, and he did not speak.
“Mr Greene,” continued Shannon,
“should at long last be acclaimed by the
Catholic body as our great theologian.”
This sort of talk, Dineen thought, has
■nothing to do with me, since it is belly-
ache drivel. But Carlin at his right
seemed highly amused with Shannon’s
remarks. At this point, Dineen, against
his wiser judgment, blurted out: “But
Greene is a novelist, not a theologian.”
“But this is where you are wrong, my
dear Brendan,” said a flushed Shannon.
“Scholastic theologians like yourself re-
fuse to look beyond the manuals.”
Shannon was excited, but enjoying him-
self, since for him this kind of conversa-
tion was the spice of life. Carlin was
doing as best he could to restrain his
laughter.
“I feel,” Shannon, full of himself,
continued, and speaking across to Carlin,
“that Brendan holds the last theological
nuance was written by his beloved
Aquinas.” Now Dineen was more sure
of himself, and determined not to say
another word. He did, however, greedily
take a cigarette and a light from Carlin,
and then, back to his old confidence,
he flushed these two intellectual bastards
right out of his system.
After making two rounds of the walk
and smoking two cigarettes, Dineen gave
a meaningless mutter, and broke away
from Shannon and Carlin. Already he
felt much better as he headed for the
doorway that led to the corridors.
And lounging at the entrance, he
noticed the vividly florid Kelly domina-
ting a small cluster of seminarists; im-
mediately Dineen became a target of
Kelly’s rich Cork tongue. “If it isn’t
the Reverend Brendan Dineen,” laughed
Kelly, playing to-the crowd. “All the
long way from sunny Australia.”
This exuberance of Kelly aroused the
seminarists, and the prospect of fun at
Dineen’s expense made them puff on
their cigarettes even more furiously. “I
noticed, Brendan,” Kelly continued, “that
you were walking with the erudite ones,
Carlin and Shannon.”
Dineen laughed at this but did not
reply.
“I have my suspicions,” smirked Kelly,
“that our distinguished scholastic from
the land of the kangaroo has been swap-
ping theological syllogisms with our
noted Irish scholars.”
A raucous laugh echoed from the
group. “Kelly,” said Dineen, feeling at
his top, “stop growing shamrocks out
of your backside.”
Kelly, turning around to the crowd,
feigned sadness.
“My dear Brendan,” he said. “Six
years in this land of saints and scholars,
and you still use the horrible expression
backside.
“Backside,” he repeated. “As one of
the Queen's worthies, my dear Brendan,
the correct usage should surely have been
bottom .”
It was accepted by those present, most
of all by Dineen, to have been an epi-
sode rich in humor. And, in fact, the
thought crossed Dineen’s mind that if
Kelly had not been given a vocation

from above, he would surely have made
a fortune on the stage.
Dineen was beaming as he walked
through the wide doorway that led into
the long corridor. And as he moved
around the group of seminarists at the
opening, Kelly leant across and placed
a friendly arm on his shoulder, and gave
him a cigarette. All this was a real boost
to Dineen and there and then he mused
that he was probably the most popular
man of his class.
The elation still lived as he nearly ran
into the duty prefect clutching a sheaf of
letters. Already the mail had been
sorted and Dineen was handed a bulky
letter. A quick glance told him that it
was from his mother at Malvern. He
thrust the letter into the pocket of his
soutane and continued along the still
bleak corridor. Time was on his side
and, as he turned left and into the toilets,
his right hand reached for his pocket and
pulled out the letter.
The envelope was quickly torn open,
and the pink pages of Melbourne sport
jutted out. Now Dineen became a man
with a purpose and, as he entered the
first vacant cubicle, he was already scan-
ning the black-on-pink headlines.
★ * ★
“What does it profit a man if he gains
the whole world and yet suffers the loss
of his soul?” These words roared
through the chapel as the portly spiritual
director, Father Dillon, rumbled out his
text for the weekly spiritual conference.
The long lectures during the day in
moral and dogmatic theology, plus scrip-
ture and canon law, had been difficult for
Dineen, since in the midst of these sacred
studies he had written a lengthy screed
to his Dublin travel agent with arrange-
ments for his return to Australia. This
agent had long decided that his health
would not return until Dineen left Ire-
land.
Many long and serious hours had been
spent by Dineen over the manner of his
passage home. He would, of course,
return by way of the ’States. A week on
the beaches in Florida, and then the
long flight over to California. It would
be a busy time for Dineen on the West
Coast since he was to stay at a rectory
in Hollywood, and film stars, like sport-
ing personalities, had a fascination for
him. A number of the less - married
stars attended the parish in which he
would be resident.
“The wages of sin is death.”—Father
Dillon bellowed his voice into the four
corners of the chapel, but the seminar-
ists were long immune to his shock
treatment.
In the matter of preaching, Dineen had
his own set views. Two major issues,
he claimed, confronted the Church: Sex
and socialism. The sex question had
first been brought to his notice in a
Catholic newspaper. A venerable Aus-
tralian bishop had said that many girls
lost their virtue in motor cars. At first,
this statement had made little impression
on Dineen. And, in fact, it was his
opinion that the aged bishop was over-
playing his cards.
But Dineen changed his tune after
reading that 50 young Catholic boys and
girls from a Dublin university had
jostled themselves into a public tele-
phone box. This had come as a rude
awakening, and there and then he deter-
mined that there must be no compromise
on the evils of sex. Anyway, his mind
was now perfectly clear: bishops knew
more about these things than the public
was willing to admit.
Dineen held no brief for either the
rich or the poor. It was simply that he
found the rich much more interesting
than the poor. And as a man of habit,
Dineen was intent on following his inter-
ests. But socialism distressed him,
since it rocked the boat. After all, he
maintained, the rich were happy and
contented with their lot. Dineen saw
no problem to society coming from the
rich. In his view, there was an easy
solution: the poor would have to pull up
their socks and become happy.
Already, in the sacred eloquence class,
Dineen had preached such views to the
seminarists. It had been a memorable
occasion; a rowdy Left-wing splinter
group had howled him down. Dineen
was in no way disturbed; he was fully
aware that a priest in the parish pulpit
can say anything and get away with it.
These reflections of Dineen ended with
the assertive ring of the college bell. The
conference was now within seconds of
its dying moments. Father Dillon made
one final bid to the seminarists: “And
if a man gives so much as a draught of
cold water to one of the least of these
here, because he is a disciple of mine, I
promise you he shall not miss his
reward.”
There was now an eager exodus from
the chapel to the refectory. Dineen was
experiencing the symptoms of many an
English mum: he badly needed a nice hot
cup of tea.
* ★ *
After tea and recreation the students
went to their cold rooms for evening
study. Dineen wound a heavy blanket
around his ample body, and flopped into
his chair. The thought of opening a
text-book never entered his mind. There
were a few glossy travel brochures on
his desk and he flicked over the pages;
his attention, however, was minimal. It
was simply a case of trying to kill time.
But the quiet of his room was swiftly
broken. A sharp knock on his door was
followed by the quick entrance of the
duty prefect. Dineen was told to report
immediately to the Dean. This news

was received with a childlike fear, and
the physical reaction hit by way of a
heavy sickly" pounding in the pit of
Dineen’s stomach. A dozen questions
and anxieties rushed through his mind as
he gingerly made his way to Father
Hackett’s room.
After a nervous knock on the Dean’s
door, and being told to enter, Dineen
found himself looking down into the
chubby face of Father Hackett. “I’m
glad to see you, Mr Dineen,” said the
Dean, without offering a chair.
“Mr Dineen, your ordination to the
priesthood,” queried Father Hackett.
Dineen had enough control to say no-
thing, but he did register a faint smile.
Father Hackett, Dineen determined,
must show his hand. “Well,” said the
Dean. “It is only four months away.”
Things began to clear for Dineen;
apparently there was nothing disturbing
to come from Father Hackett. “I simply
called you,” said a now smiling Dean,
“to let you know how happy the college
authorities are with you.”
VTow Dineen was perfectly at ease. He
was in control, and intended to
keep it that way. The tactic to this end,
he decided, was obvious: he would not
say a single word. “My advice,” said a
fatherly Dean, “is to take it easy until
ordination.”
Dineen condescended to look moder-
ately pleasant. “These days in Austra-
lia,” the Dean mouthed in intimate con-
fidence, “the Irish priests don’t become
bishops.”
Bishops—Australian or Irish—were
not among Dineen's hobbies. But he
tried to look knowledgeable as the Dean
made his confidence. “We Irish,” con-
tinued the Dean, “are not disappointed.
It is only natural that Australian-born
priests are now getting the mitres.”
“A mitre,” thought Dineen. “What's
that?”
“St Kevin's,” said a now earnest
Father Hackett, “is hopeful that you,
Mr Dineen, will get us a mitre.”
Dineen became intrigued, and deter-
mined to look up mitre in the Catholic
encyclopedia.
“Thank you, Mr Dineen, that will be
all,” concluded a happy-looking Dean.
A faint smile issued from Dineen as
he lowered his head and left the room.
It was clear, thought Dineen, that Father
Hackett was losing his grip on things,
but fortunately, he laughed, that was not
his worry.
In the approach to his own room,
Dineen noticed that the duty prefect’s
door was open. The prefect was not in
his room, but an opened packet of
cigarettes was noticed by Dineen on the
bare table. Dineen nipped across to the
table and took a cigarette.
Now back in his room, Dineen decided
to call it a day, and skip night prayers.
He threw off his clothes and swiftly
donned his pyjamas; then followed a
jerky cleaning of his teeth, and the sharp
click as he turned out the light.
It had been a long day, he thought, as
he pulled the many covers on the bed
about him; within minutes he was asleep.
Almost at once, he fell into a dream that
projected him into the college chapel.
The students were assembled for prayer.
Then Dineen heard the voice of the duty
prefect: “Our holy patron, St Brendan
Dineen.” And in pious unison, all the
students took up the holy response:
“Pray for us.”
A smile creased Dineen's face as he
rolled over to his right side and broke
the dream. The sleep of the Reverend
Brendan Dineen was now deep and un-
troubled. It was the happy sleep of a
just man, a man who can look at his
conscience face-to-face.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Thoughts on Pig Iron
TJave iron ore companies been cutting
their throats by progressively re-
ducing their prices in a bid for long-
term Japanese contracts?
Viewed objectively, it could be said
that the Japanese are better horse
traders and that Australian suppliers
might have achieved a better deal. But,
with so much at stake in terms of capital
investment, the iron ore in a firm Japan-
ese hand is better than a non-productive
heap of over-burden in the bush.
The Japanese, well versed in inter-
national trading, banded together in their
buying; Australian companies under-cut
their fellow competitors in an effort to
obtain contracts spreading over long
periods. Without long-term contracts, of
course, the Australian developers could
not possibly justify the huge capital out-
lay to mine the ore because they are
committed, in many cases, to building
harbors, townships, etc. in remote areas.
In round figures, the total iron ore
contracts look tremendous at around
£l3OO million. Will they look so good
in 10 or 20 years’ time? The negotiated
price per unit for recently signed con-
tracts has dropped from around 24 cents
a unit c.i.f. for West Australian iron
ore to an average of about 19 cents a
unit.
No one imagines that such large con-
tracts can be written at the current world
price on the open market. There are
some, however, who argue that Aus-
tralia’s reserves are being sold too
cheaply in terms of world supplies.
Prior to the Australian discoveries of
iron ore, studies of world natural re-
sources indicated that the rapid in-
dustrialisation of various nations was
running ahead of new discoveries of raw
materials, thus suggesting that nations
like the US would soon be forced to
mine low-grade ores or seek supplies
from outside sources. If the US, Russia
and China start seeking additional
supplies, buying competition could be
keen. Long-term contracts, therefore,
are double-edged because the buyer
ensures his supplies.
At this stage it appears that the
sudden discovery of huge iron ore de-
posits in Australia’s north west (claimed
to be the third largest in the world)
heavily tips the scales towards a surplus
of supplies. Hence the rush to obtain
long - term orders. Reinforcing this
attitude is the belief that further dis-
coveries in Australia could be revealed.
If we are talking about the long term,
it is necessary to remember that the jaws
of industry should consume iron ore even
more avidly in 10 or 20 years’ time.
Should cost structures keep rising
steadily in that period, today’s prices will
look extremely cheap, especially when
exports at prices fixed in 1965 must off-
set imports of other goods at 1980 price
levels. Mount Newman’s contract ex-
tends. 22 years to 1991, starting from
1969. Mount Hammersley’s contract
extends to 1982.
Accordingly there has been agitation
for the local treatment of Australia’s
iron ore deposits so that they are brought
to the stage of pig iron before being
shipped abroad to the steelmakers.
Mr J. McEwen, who assumed the
mantle of acting Prime Minister during
Sir Robert Menzies’ trip abroad, said
recently that Australia wanted industries,
not just holes in the ground. He was
referring as well to the large bauxite
deposits now being developed in Aus-
tralia. These he was anxious to see
processed into alumina and eventually
into aluminium. Similarly, iron ore
could be up-graded into iron pellets or
J. McEWEN
into pig-iron and increasingly into iron
products, he said.
The amount of money added in value
to such raw materials, of course, would
put hundreds of millions of pounds on to
Australia’s export cheque. This is no
idle thought when overseas loans need
to be serviced in the future, because
Australia must, in turn, earn money
overseas to pay for the dividends and
interest remitted on such investment
capital.
Overseas groups which supply capital
to Australia (distinct from the iron ore

London and Wall Street put up
a mild show of cheerfulness last
week. Close observers in both places
still wondered how long the slight
elation could last. Apart from
domestic economic issues, America
must once more cope with widespread
questionings over the course of the
Vietnam war. Nearer the industrial
bone, Britain, during this present
week, awaits a fresh set of external
trade figures.
Most world exchanges seem to be
enduring a considerable thinness in
trading. Europe, naturally, is deeply
influenced by the latest dissension
about the Common Market; all
financial centres have again to be
concerned with the possibilities con-
tained in US desires to re-examine the
world monetary system.
A fair amount of the uplift in New
York and London proceeded from
largely technical corrections. Wall
Street brokers especially started to
favor insurance, airline and oil stocks
displaying low price-earnings ratios.
Chemicals, food, brewing and drug
issues are also gaining recommenda-
tion as being generally independent
of overall economic movements,
Post-July 4 holiday trading opened
with a distinct rally, which, however,
could not be fully sustained through-
out the week. Turnovers, though, did
hold reasonably well and Friday saw
quite a flurry. Institutions have come
a little further into the market. More
optimism may perhaps be generated
by the April-May-June international
payments surplus—the first in almost
eight years.
London gave a positive early kick
after the Government’s three parlia-
mentary defeats, yet there’s not very
much buying pressure behind the up-
ward movements. Volumes remain
depressed. Some prevailing high

tion. Individual gains among leaders

groups) have complained in the past
that Australians winge about the dangers
of overseas ownership but bleat like
sheep when the supply is cut off. It is
true that Australia cannot have it both
ways. The major problem is the method
by which that capital is introduced and
the cost of servicing it.
Everyone agrees that Australia must
obtain overseas funds to develop the
huge mineral deposits now being un-
covered. Yet a thought must be spared
for the need to finance or refund that
overseas money. The more Australia
obtains by way of export return the
better the net result. For, if Australia
gains £l3OO million from exports but
finally must remit considerably more in
capital profits, dividends and interest,
the nation could be worse off —par-
ticularly if Government loans must be
raised overseas to offset a run-down in
international reserves, and thus create an
added interest commitment.
None of this is to decry the short-term
benefits that accrue to a nation through
the introduction of overseas capital,
including the advantages of job creation,
circulation of money and tax revenue.
But Mr McEwen is on sound national
ground when he insists that greater
benefits should be sought by processing
raw materials as far as possible. The
proviso is that the processing does not
make the raw material too expensive for
overseas sale. Also, the processor would
need to be locally owned as far as
possible. It poses a few thoughts for
BHP.
Accountancy Now
A further contribution to the current
debate on the education of account-
ants begins on page 65. The Bulletin
feels there should be little need to justify
some recent concentration on this subject.
Accountancy, beset by new techniques,
by computers and by management de-
mands, must be brought to a position
of satisfying contemporary standards, as
must a great deal else in Australian
business.
Many within the profession itself see
this and urge the necessity of reform.
To the Chartered Accountants’ Third
Australian Congress in Adelaide, Mr
A. B. Campbell felt compelled to say:
“Accounting has today reached a critical
stage in its development both here and
abroad. This is largely due to its failure
to develop accounting principles suf-
ficiently widely accepted for both account-
ants and the users of accounts to be able
to rely on them and which would also
permit meaningful comparisons to be
made between different businesses.”
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Mr Callaghan Talks
Credit and Costs
With some glances at interest rates
what Mr B. B. Callaghan, the
A new managing director of the Com-
monwealth Banking Corporation, told
The Bulletin on his visit to Melbourne
last week to meet the business com-
munity, the matter of additional credit
provision for drought-stricken farmers
has not yet reached the urgent stage and
criticisms of the Reserve Bank for
allegedly taking a parsimonious line are
unwarranted. Mr Callaghan was speak-
ing before Mr McEwen made some
observations on the subject, after a
Cabinet meeting last week, to the effect
that the Government was' in touch with
the Reserve Bank which, he said, was in
close consultation with the trading banks
to ensure proper consideration for the
needs as they arise. At the moment this
looks to be a red herring which, accord-
ing to Mr Callaghan, certainly hasn’t
originated in any deterioration in the
relations between the Reserve Bank and
the trading banks.
Against this, the new chairman of the
Australian Bankers’ Association, Mr H.
McE. Scambler, said later in the week
that restrictions on trading bank advances
would have to be relaxed if advances to
drought-stricken borrowers were not to
result in the reduction of lending to other
sectors of industry. He seemed to regard
present Central Bank restrictions as
already working in this direction and
considered that its quantitative restric-
B. B. CALLAGHAN
tions were not sufficiently flexible to
allow for the necessary adaptation of
lending to meet changing circumstances.
However, in Mr Callaghan’s view, the
problem was one for the future rather
than the present, because farmers,
monetarily speaking, are still fairly liquid
and being adequately catered for.
Demands for additional credit, he said,
would not rise appreciably until farmers
had to face up to the financing of re-
stocking. In the meantime, several
sources of working capital, including the
trading banks, of which some were more
intimately concerned with rural credit
than others, were open. Mr Callaghan
pointed, for instance, to the accumulated
savings of farmers after several good
years, the sales of stock necessitated by
the drought, and the deferments of pay-
ments of capital and interest to the
Development Bank, of which he was
general manager (the first, in fact) until
his recent appointment to the Common-
wealth Banking Corporation following
the death of Mr E. B. Richardson.
Withdrawals for working capital re-
quirements could be a partial explanation
of the weaker trend in savings bank
deposits, he said, in answer to a question,
stressing that the Development Bank has
probably been most helpful up to this
stage in alleviating the position of many
farmers with outstanding loans. The
bank has about £25 million of its £73
million loans in rural industries at 4£
p.c. and under extended terms of repay-
ment. These often include liberal repay-
ment holidays to meet individual cases
for developing properties. This sort of
rural credit is, of course, quite distinct
from loans by the rural credits depart-
ment of the Reserve Bank, which are
confined to finance for the various mar-
keting authorities.
Mr Callaghan said he had no clues (or
at least is not giving any) on the possible
forward commitments of the trading
banks for financing imports. I was
hoping to get an indication from him on
how long the upsurge in imports was
going to last (the figures indicating a
record month for imports in June, at the
huge total of £134.5 million, were
announced the following day). This
would have been most useful, but per-
haps the Commonwealth Trading Bank
is hardly in as good a position as the


private trading banks, with relatively
heavier import financing components in
their advances, to give a reliable guide
on this.
As he saw it, imports coupled wfith
the demand for advances from local
sources would, among other things,
necessitate a monetary policy being kept
very flexible. It was pretty obvious that
there would have to be continued tight-
ness in credit policy. He thought it un-
likely that any reduction in bank over-
draft rates was on the cards in the fore-
seeable future. However, it was not his
province as managing director of the
Commonwealth Banking Corporation to
talk about what Dr Coombs, at the
Reserve Bank, might or might not do.
“Nugget” lived in a separate building
down the street from the Commonwealth
Banking Corporation and the only com-
mon member of both boards was the
Secretary of the Treasury, Sir Roland
Wilson. I gathered that his calls, on
foot, anyway, on Dr Coombs were in-
frequent.
I posed the question whether there
was likely to be any increase in the rate
of interest on savings bank deposits (now
3 V p.c.) in the light of the recent slow-
ness in new deposits and the big gap
of three-quarters p.c. between the current
rate and that on trading banks fixed
deposits (now 4} p.c.). Mr Callaghan
refused to bite on this, but did say that
in his view the current malaise in savings
bank deposits was probably temporary
(I don’t necessarily agree with that). So
far as the gap between savings bank
interest rate and the fixed deposits rate,
the important thing to remember, he
said, was to maximise the flow of money
into the banks in the pursuit of monetary
control. That, of course, is fundamental.
An aspect Mr Callaghan seemed to be
most concerned about, apropos a possible
increase in the interest rate on savings
deposits, was on the score of the Cor-
poration’s expenditure. He said the
Arbitration Commission's latest increase
in wages was going to put the Corpora-
tion up for an extra £290,000. This was,
for the moment anyway, a bigger prob-
lem than how thb slump in savings bank
deposits was going to affect housing
finance and subscriptions from the
savings banks to Commonwealth loans
this year. At any rate, even with the
massive resources behind his Corpora-
tion, Mr Callaghan showed himself as
alive as any businessman Eve talked to
recently on the subject of rising labor
costs.
He didn’t say how much the Corpora-
tion’s wages bill had increased since he
joined it in 1961, but it has probably
followed the general trend. Perhaps the
best rough measurement of how wages
generally have risen in the last four
years is the official index of average
weekly wage rates, which reflects not
only award wages but also results
obtained by labor in the open market.
In the last four years the index has risen
just on 20 p.c. in manufacturing industry,
that is from 140.2 to 168.0 (for all in-
dustries the increase is slightly lower,
from 141.7 to 169.4 p.c., or an increase
of 19.5 p.c.). In the same period, it is
worth noting, the consumer price level
has increased by only 5.7 p.c.
It would seem that this index gives a
more realistic measure of wage increases
than that cited last week by the Victorian
Employers’ Federation. The VEF said
labor costs had risen by 11 p.c. in this
period, a figure it obtained by adding
together last year’s seven p.c. increase
ip the basic wage, the 2i p.c. estimated
increase from annual leave and long ser-
vice leave awards, and the latest li p.c.
The VEF failed to include the 10 p.c.
increase in margins in 1963 and the spurt
in over - award payments. Without the
latter one can’t arrive at the real answer,
which is that wages have risen by about
five p.c. a year since June, 1961.
Taking the position of the trading
banks as an example, the latest H p.c.
increase in wages, plus possible increases
in company tax, pose a big headache in
the attempt to maintain profit margins
without increasing charges or prices.
CROESUS
David and Goliath
Is a reserve price the answer?
'VTational causes are often won or lost
in Melbourne. Nobody is more
aware of that, perhaps, than men from
north of the border with designs to re-
shape the order of things in Australia. So
when Sir William Gunn swept down
there one day last week to convert the
Victorian branch of the Australian Pri-
mary Producers Union to his reserve
price scheme for wool, he had all his
demagogic plumes flying in the manner
of the full-blown politician he aspires
to be. The oak panels of the Presbyterian
Assembly Hall in Collins Street can sel-
dom have resounded to such a Knox-like
proselytising performance. Here was
Goliath.
Against his tirade the quietly reasoned
argument and delivery of a David in the
person of Mr R. W. Macarthur-Onslow,
also down from the north with many
solid pebbles in his sling and doing
battle with Sir William, was but a whis-
per against the wind which some of the
delegates told me they couldn’t even
catch over the microphones (never very
kind to quiet speakers in this hall). It
wasn’t surprising, therefore, that, even
though Sir William failed to convince me
his reserve price scheme was necessary,
in the end he won the day with a body
which was not far from the flour-
throwers at Hamilton a year or two back
demanding "marketing" before “promo-
tion . It still bears Sir William a grudge
in that so far it has not succeeded in
getting representation on the Wool In-
dustry Conference. Sir William did not
miss the opportunity to assure the audi-
ence he would now do all he could to
get the APPU represented on the con-
ference.
I got the impression of a steamroller
in action and flanked by PR men know-
ing where it, for the moment anyway,
was going. Exuding confidence, Sir Wil-
liam said it would take him only five
minutes to dispose of any opposition
arguments in the way. Where he ulti-
mately intended to push the industry
was left in the air. He was always care-
ful to insist, though, that nothing would
be done without the industry’s approval.
He was not a dictator, though he some-
times wished he were, he said, sotto
voce.
It seemed to me Sir William left the
reserve' price proposals wide open to
criticism by making no secret of the fact
that his ideas on the future of the wool
industry were very flexible. I wondered
rather if he wouldn’t, given the chance
by the acceptance of the reserve price
scheme, eventually run the industry off
the rails or into the Government sidings
of appraisal or acquisition. Not that the
majority of small growers in the assembly
hall audience w'ould necessarily object to
the latter.
Mr Macarthur-Onslow thinks these
professions of “flexibility” suggest Sir
William himself must have reservations
on the likely effectiveness of the reserve
price scheme. Before this audience Sir
William was obviously not going to play
down his faith that the reserve price plan
w'ould achieve its object. However, he
was very frank in admitting it would not
solve all the problems of the Australian
wool industry and also that it would take
some time to get it working properly,
since the authority’s staff would have to
be built up and gain experience.
How strong, then, are Sir William’s
ow r n doubts on the scheme? He won’t
commit himself to professing the scheme
is a first step to appraisal or acquisition,
yet stresses that the Wool Board’s market-
ing committee is even now r examining

alternatives to the reserve price scheme.
So obviously, quite apart from other
reforms which could be achieved without
scrapping the free auction system (some
of these were recommended by the Philp
Report three years ago, which came out
against a reserve price scheme), for Sir
William the reserve price scheme is not
the complete answer.
He denied there was any connection
between the reserve price and these
“other” reforms. Some of the latter, such
as bulking small lots and research into
several other things, he stated, were al-
ready being explored by the Wool Board.
So was the acquisition by the authority of
lots of three or less bales and of badly
classed clips of under thirty bales.
Sir William’s performance on this
occasion did nothing to shake my view
that he and his reserve price cohorts have
done little more than to ask the wool-
growers to accept the plan on trust with-
out solid supporting evidence that it
would secure them higher returns for
their wool and less price fluctuation. On
this occasion he made great play of the
gains received by wheatgrowers under
the stabilisation plan (“where would the
Australian wheat industry be today with-
out it?” he asks rhetorically) —and also
of the fact that the world wool-using
trade had come out strongly in favor of
the scheme on the grounds that it would
produce more stable prices for wool.
Surely one has to be suspicious of this
presumed duality of benefits. Sir William
argues that the wool users on the other
side of the world are quite happy, as he
put it, “to absorb higher prices for wool
in their profit margins,” providing the
rises are modest ones from year to year
(say not more than sd. a lb., he said).
The argument is that, as the cost of raw
wool in the £35 suit would be only about
£2, there would be ample scope for
absorbing higher prices for wool. But
textile makers are not philanthropists.
Also, their other costs are likely to con-
tinue to rise.
Is it not most probable that, in sup-
porting the scheme, most overseas wool
textiles manufacturers would be harbor-
ing the thought that it would mean not
only smaller fluctuations in price but also
lower average prices? If they could invent
some scheme for us which would prevent
prices rising, say in situations of short
supply or exceptionally high demand,
they would be in favor of that also. They
and Sir William put great stress on the
fact that synthetic prices are falling. So
it would seem they are also hoping that
the reserve price scheme will lead to
lower wool prices, not merely that it
would make them steadier. Personally
I am most suspicious of professions by
textile manufacturers that a reserve price
would benefit Australian woolgrowers.
I cannot gainsay the theory of how
reserve price would affect the market, as
Sir William said the appearance of the
authority as a buyer would tend to give
other buyers more confidence in bidding
on a falling market. By instilling this
confidence, the quantity of wool which
the authority would have to buy would
be minimised. The examples he gave of
the small proportion of purchases by the
authorities in South Africa and New
Zealand to the actual quantity they bid
for illustrate the point. I accept that. But
what happens when the market is well
above the price at which the authority is
efnipowered to bid?
In those circumstances the reserve
price machinery is useless and would
have no influence on the scale of price
fluctuations either way. As an example,
Mr Macarthur-Onslow said that, in a
recent period, the price of 64s fell con-
siderably more in South Africa, which
operates a reserve price system, than wool
of the same count fell in Australia under
the free auction system. I am therefore
left with the impression that the reserve
price system is only useful if wool prices
are knocking around the floor level. As
the very essence of the scheme as stressed
by the Wool Board is that the reserve
priqe would be fixed at a conservative
level, this leaves one wondering if Sir
William isn't simply chasing a chimera.
He makes the point himself, in fact, by
laying so much stress on the compari-
sons. In those countries the amount of
wool bought by the authorities has been
infinitesimal compared with the huge
quantities sold.
So it comes down to this: In the in-
terests of Australia’s biggest export
industry, which has gone from strength
to strength independent of governments
as long, nearly, as white settlement in
Australia itself, is it necessary that a
mountain of government and wool-
growers’ money (£BO million has been
suggested as the required figure, split
5-to-3) now be enlisted and a bright new
bureaucracy created to shore up the mar-
ket against a hypothetical depressed
situation? To my way of thinking, defi-
nitely not. After the findings of the Philp
Report issued only three years ago, I am
abashed that the legions are surrendering
to Gunn’s fire without more of a fight.

Hiring Cars Nationally
An industry plus price-cutting
A fight to woo the average motorist
and the large-fleet user is just begin-
ning in Australia’s car hire industry. The
four main contestants, all of whom
operate nationally, are Kays, Avis, Hertz
and Budget. The latter two are recent
entrants to the field. The former, after
years of operation, are now well estab-
lished. All of them have set their sights
high and a minor price-cutting war has
developed.
Who will win is anybody’s guess.
Kays, Avis and Hertz are offering attrac-
tive rates with the emphasis on pick-up
and delivery service. Budget, on the
other hand, is stressing an absence of
pick-up and delivery which, it says,
eliminates a lot of overhead and enables
it to offer, on two vehicles, no daily
rental charge.
Car hire in Australia is a relatively
new industry. The present-day structure
has only recently been developed and
has closely followed American lines.
After the Second World War there was
a natural shortage of cars and many
'small hire firms operated. However, with
increasing affluence and increasing local
motor vehicle production, emphasis on
the immediate post-war customer
chiefly the joyrider—lapsed. Instead of
the pleasures of motoring being stressed,
the greater convenience and the savings
of car hire assumed more importance.
On the commercial side, renting of
trucks and vans is a growing business.
Avis, Kays and Hertz all offer com-
mercial vehicles for rent. Avis is the
most recent company to offer such
vehicles with plans announced last week
for the hire of 15 cwt vans to two-ton
table-top trucks. The service is designed
specifically for businesses but Avis
expects good demand from the private
citizen as well.
Eric Mclllree, chief of Avis Rent-A-
Car, one of the first companies in car
hire on a national basis, says that, when
he first started Avis in Australia, no cars
were hired for the first four days. “Then
they started in ones and twos and now
we operate on a national basis with nearly
1800 vehicles.”
Kays, probably the largest car hire
firm in Australia, has about 900 rental
cars and 2000 lease cars on its books.
. Hertz executives were not available in
Sydney for comment. Budget Rent-A-
Car, the recent newcomer to the industry,
at present has about 100 cars nationally
but sees almost “limitless” expansion.
A comparison of daily rates at this
point is interesting:
Daily Per Insurance
Car rent mile (daily)
Avis Morris 850 15s. Is. 13s. 6d.
Holden Sedan 10s. is. 13s. 6d.
Kays Morris 850* Is. Is. 10s. Od.
Holden Sedan* 255. Is. 10s. Od.
Hertz Morris 850 20s. Is. 13s. 6d.
Holden Sedan 355. Is. 13s. 6d.
Budget Morris 850* nil Is. 13s. 6d.
Holden Sedan 255. Is. 13s. 6d.
The asterisk indicates a minimum
daily mileage of 30 miles is payable.
Rates for Volkswagen 1200 and Falcon
sedans are similar to the rates payable
for Morris 850 and Holden sedans
respectively.
From the above table it will be seen
that there is little competition as far as
mileage rates and insurance are con-
cerned. The daily rental charged seems
to be the deciding factor. The big dif-
ference between Kays and Budget, which
offer the two lowest rates, is that while
Kays will allow the driver to pick up a
car in, say, Sydney, and drop it in
Melbourne, Budget makes an extra
charge for return away from the point
of pick-up. That is, if the car is collected

An interesting facet of the industry is
the car lease business. Kays, the first into
this field, says it now has 2000 cars on
lease, mainly to business houses with
large travelling sales staff. Avis, which
has only recently entered the field, now
leases about 150 cars. Leasing is appar-
ently a growing business and extensions
of these activities will come quickly.
Avis also operates what it calls term
renting. Under this plan cars are rented
by the week for three months up to 12
months at Is. per mile, with a minimum
of 1000 miles a month (Is. 6d. a mile for
luxury cars). The cars are delivered,
registered and insured and are fully
maintained during the time of renting.
Why hire a car? Companies in the
business feel they must grow as the
population grows. But not just because
population is expanding. Two of the
reasons advanced for increasing car hire,
especially in city areas, involve cost and
parking.
An executive of Kays in Sydney said
the increasing number of home units in
residential areas was placing parking
space at a premium. “When it’s hard to
park in the city and there is limited
parking space where you live, it doesn’t
pay to own a car which may have to
stay out in the street or which, because
of crowded city parking conditions, may
stay in the garage at home. For this
reason hire cars are becoming more
attractive to the motorist.”
A talking point in the car hire in-
dustry lately has been the concession
granted to Avis of hire at airports in
Australia. Both Kays and Avis held an
authority under the Airports (Business
Concessions) Act to operate car rental
services at Commonwealth airports for
a three-year period which expired m
June, 1964. At the expiration of these
contracts tenders were called for the
right to operate for a further three years.
Avis was awarded the concession on
the basis of submitting the highest tender.
Granting of the concession to Avis did
not negate any other car hire operator’s
right to deliver cars to Commonwealth
airports for clients who had prearranged
delivery.
Kays has claimed, since the concession
was granted Avis, that hiring charges for
cars at airports have been increased and
that Avis has been granted a monopoly.
Avis says charges were, in fact, lowered
and that it does not have a monopoly
since other car hire operators have the
right to make' prearranged deliveries to
airports.
“We do write more business than any-
one else at airports,” said Eric Mclllree,
“but then we pay for the right to do so.
Our airport hiring charges are exactly
the same as those that apply at city
depots,” he added.

The University and Accountancy
A first degree and professional competence
By A. A. FORSTER
The major weaknesses in both the
Vatter and the Martin reports lie
not so much in the broad canvas of
their ideas as in their express and implied
detailed prescriptions for the future of
the whole of the accounting profession.
They were certainly not the subject of
extensive research, nor do they neces-
sarily reflect the relevant expertise. Once
you leave generalities and the broad plan,
substantially what you have are the views
of two men two men who, however
eminent and capable, reflect, in the ex-
pression of their views, the formative
influence of their backgrounds and
environment. The backgrounds and en-
vironment do not include experience
with a fully-staffed operation of the kind
involved in a full-scale professional-
standard course in accountancy, a self-
contained first degree course with all of
the related'administration, and the large
numbers of students necessarily involved
in such an operation. The one man who
had most to offer in terms of knowledge
and experience of the practical realities
of this kind of operation was overseas
at the time the Vatter report was being
put together.
The questionnaire lying behind the
statistical data, which is a part of the
Vatter report, reflects the foibles, pre-
dilections and the preconceptions of
those who, in a sense, directed that
operation from within the Australian
Society of Accountants. The compromise
form had a number of patent defects,
but none so serious as lay in the concep-
tion of the original task. There was no
time, and little inclination, to consider
carefully the desirability of change or of
modification. The statistical data in the
Vatter report is not therefore very help-
ful. It is, in some respects, defective as
a basis for drawing conclusions about
the really relevant questions. But, then,
these are unimportant defects, in the
final analysis, for that data is only loosely
related to the views and personal recom-
mendations of the author. The statistics,
as data, grace the report and provide
an air of verisimilitude for the per-
sonal viewpoint of a likeable, capable
accountant-academic. The statistical data
gaily flutters down like a paper snow-
storm over a victory parade along Broad-
way and Times Square, lending a
pleasantly bemusing character to the
whole.
The Vatter report should now be put
aside as having served its purpose in
stimulating the discussions about changes
in the pattern and content of accounting
curricula which have been going on
within the universities. Yet the report
has an importance and significance going
beyond its influence as a stimulus to dis-
cussion within the universities. In one
sense it may be said to mark the end of
an era which commenced with Dicksee
in 1903. It not only marks the end of
the ancien regime ; it opens up a period
of struggle between strongly contending
schools of thought, and that not merely
between the pure theorist at one end of
the spectrum and the pragmatist at the
other. In this situation the Vatter report
is the catalyst. It is also, from outside
the universities, an instrument of policy;
a reflection of both a power and an in-
fluence which may call for a further and
more careful evaluation as the transition
proceeds from the ancien regime to a
meritocracy in the accounting profession
m us ra ta.
One of the additional sources of in-
fluence, and one which may well prove
decisive on the campus, is the (UK) Hale
Report on University Teaching Methods
(1964, HMSO). This report takes a stand
which is quite opposed to a most im-
portant aspect of the American view-
point—Vatter’s idea of the frosting first
and the cake afterwards, an idea that
is suggested also by the Martin report
when it recommends that there should
be, first, a broadly based programme
followed by a specialised professional
training at graduate level. We simply
cannot afford this .type of two-bite, two-
course approach in terms of our avail-
able resources. The Hale report is quite
specific here and recognises that “. . . it
is important that the first degree course
should give a preparation for profes-
sional life which does not depend for its
value on the addition of a post-graduate
course . . .” (para. 364).
xhere are broadly three types of ap _
proach to the implementation of a first-
degree course with an accounting major,
More than one university in Australia,

finding itself starved of funds and other
resources for such a course, perforce sets
priorities as to what it can best do by
way of a compromise. The thinking
behind some aspects of the Martin report
is that of the fund-and-resource-starved
university. In the USA, universities
developed earlier and more rapidly than
in Australia. With the accounting pro-
fession one of the later starters, the
prospective chartered accountant has
found that he needs to add to his first
degree course at least two years of part-
time study to qualify for his profession.
The thinking behind some aspects of the
Vatter report is that of this American
pattern.
The third and, in my view, the most
advanced approach is exemplified by a
university which, whether by foresight
and good planning or by fortunate cir-
cumstances does not matter, finds itself
with adequate resources, both to plan
and to carry out a full programme of
studies within a first-degree course; a
course which equips a man for his pro-
fession and needing only the detail of
practice and the experience to form and
shape his judgments. In this respect
Australia, in at least one instance, has
led the way in university accounting
curricula. Professor Vatter, however, in
some important respects, would have us
revert to the American pattern.
Then, apart from organisational
changes, there is discussion about the
content of courses. Australian academics
have indicated some of the ways in
which such a change or revision is desir-
able. They are, however, neither re-
sponsible for the Vatter interpretation
of their views nor involved directly in
shaping the Vatter plan. I should imagine
that each of the ten Australian univer-
sities will make up its own mind, quite
independently.
On the question of course content,
there is a tendency to sacrifice funda-
mentals to fashion, to exalt theory for
, its own sake without troubling to give
it the operational meaning which alone
justifies its place in a first-degree course.
The qualities of insight given by opera-
tions research make it one of the most
useful of the newer management tools
strongly favored for a place in the
quantitative methods which are to form
such an important part of the new cur-
ricula. Another candidate is operational
auditing the scientific review and ap-
praisal of internal operational efficiency.
Both of these management tools are
precisely twenty-five years old.
On the assumption that all entrants to
a professional school of' accountancy
would first have acquired, at a junior
college, a thorough grasp of the basic
theory and techniques of accounting,
they need then a much more thorough
training in the law as it affects account-
ing for the rights of parties, to be pro-
vided with all of the material at our
disposal for the promotion of more
efficient financing, and all of the insights
we can provide into the processes of
rational business - investment decision-
making and management.
Tn opposition to the Vatter report, or Mr
-*• Brian Quinn's version of it, I would
say that you should not remove much of
the law content from the basic course,
but should rather change and strengthen
it, giving greater emphasis to the history
and the development of law, its role or
function in our society, and the prin-
ciples which are relevant to the practice
of accounting. You do not need a heavy
injection of mathematical models and
organisational theory qua theory; you do
need to convey to undergraduate students
the beneficial insights these methods and
concepts can provide.
What needs emphasising is that the
accountant functions in two principal
areas. There is the ordering of trans-
actions the statistical and analytical
side of his work, which also demands,
for its efficient performance, a most
thorough knowledge of many areas of
the law. Related to this, there is the
interpretation of transactions and events
for decision-making purposes and as a
basis for communicating to various
special-interest groups. We certainly
should provide useful insights for the
undergraduate student in the account-
ancy specialisation by drawing on the
most recent work done in the actuarial
field, in games theory, in the area of
statistical aids to decision-making, and
in the area of other social sciences con-
cerned with organisations and with be-
havior theory.
A large and important part of the
work of the accountant involves the
expression, in a system of records, of
the effect of the relationships between
parties, and the effect of transactions
within the framework of those relation-
ships. The law of contracts, of trusts,
of partnerships and of corporations, and
the all pervading influence of taxation,
are a few of the relevant areas of law
which need treatment in greater depth.
One of our most urgent needs is a
department of commercial law which
could provide not only an important
cultural strand in terms of history and
philosophy but which might remove
present weaknesses in the coverage of
wide areas of the law for example,
those concerned with finance, with
mortgages and securities generally, with
money-lending, and the law relating to
commercial credit transactions in both
domestic and international trade. Here
are weaknesses which lie at the very
heart of accounting. The evidences of
them may be found scattered through
the institutional examination questions of
the past where they have posed, for
solution, quite impossible situations
which simply do not allow of a solution
which is valid in terms of the relevant
law.
What do these views mean in down-to-
earth terms? If one takes the present
commerce degree at the University of
NSW as a benchmark for the profession,
it would mean a revised first-degree
course in the accountancy specialisation
associated with the parallel introduction
of a more general commerce degree with
an Arts emphasis combined with a strong
managerial or business administration
strand. This move would clear the way
for an accountancy specialisation that
would serve the profession in the same
way as Law and Medicine are now

served by the universities. Such an
accountancy specialisation could be then
re-drawn; strengthened in its coverage
of concepts, theory and principles;
strengthened in its coverage of the
relevant law, philosophy and ethics; but
with a scaled-down economics strand in
lieu of the present three-year sequence.
I see the whole issue as one of
priorities in relation to the allocation of
scarce resources and, for that reason,
would regard* such a degree course as
concerned primarily with establishing
appropriate standards of competence for
the issuance of a certificate for public
practice—placing the accountant in pub-
lic practice on the same footing as the
doctor and the lawyer. This is the first
essential step, and one which our present
means would allow. The leitmotif of
such a first-degree course lies in its aim
of producing an educated person: a
person who takes with him from his
university some share of the riches of
his cultural heritage and, added to that,
a fundamental professional competence.
He needs then only the maturing in-
fluence of experience to sharpen skills
and to shape a capacity for sound judg-
ments. The graduate, thus equipped, will
certainly not fall back into that class of
people who are cynically observed to
secure their professional training “on the
job” —at the expense of pauperising
the nation’s investors and creditors under
the protection of substantial indemnity
policies.
LETTER
Reports Misread?
Oir:
lt is regretted that Mr A. A. Forster
(8., June 26, p. 65) has not read the
Martin and Vatter reports, or Mr Quinn’s
article, more carefully. He has con-
veniently misconstrued all three, e.g.:
1. Who suggests the training of all
accountants should be in the hands of
the universities? Both reports specifically
direct attention to the possibilities of
tertiary institutions (including Institutes
of Technology, which Mr Forster
ignores) doing this. The Institute of
Chartered Accountants suggest in their
submission to the Martin Committee that
university education will be the basic
professional examination entrance quali-
fication in the future.
2. The Martin report, Vol 11, p. 28,
says, “. . . Many (accountancy) subjects
lack analytical content and have no place
in university undergraduate courses”;
and on p. 29, “. . . the proposals (of the
Chartered Institute) would enable the
professional content of university courses
on accounting to be further reduced,”
So much for Mr Forster's scathing words
on Mr Quinn’s statement of fact that,
some accounting subjects meet university
criteria!
3. It is interesting to note the
similarity of treatment in accounting sub-
jects in both the Vatter report and the
recently established economics and
politics faculty of Monash University.
Mr Forster suggests the universities are
ignoring the Vatter report; in terms of
subject matter they can afford to ignore
it (subject to 2 above), but the Vatter
report is written for the professional
bodies.
4. As to the numbers studying for
Commerce and Economics degrees, the
Martin report shows, Vol. I, p. 79,
“part-time students, 3719”, and p. 59,
“full-time students 2456” total 6175.
Is to state this as “6000” an error of
fact and interpretation? There are over
10,000 other students studying accoun-
tancy.
5. Do “these proposals (Professor
Vatter’s) represent an attempt to secure
a more commanding position and control
of the profession”? Control by whom?
Professor Vatter? Really, Mr Foster!
6. What is new about the introduction
of public exams? The accounting bodies
and the Accountants’ Registration Board
(NSW) have been holding them for you.
7. No one but Mr Forster suggests
that the Martin and Vatter reports con-
stitute a package. However, since they
were researched and released almost
concomitantly, it is of value to compare,
as several articles and papers have done,
their conclusions.
8. Mr Forster believes on balance
that the amalgamation of professional
bodies to date has been beneficial. I
can see no part of Mr Quinn’s article
predicting or favoring further amalgama-
tions within the profession.
9. If restrictions on entry are “related
more to expediency than professional
purpose”, perhaps Mr Foster can tell
us what is the basis of such expediency?
What is wrong with a professional body
proclaiming well in advance, as the
Chartered Institute has done, that it
intends raising its entrance standards?
There are many genuine problems ro
be overcome before any of the Vatter
or Martin Committee recommendations
are implemented. Constructive thought
and comment is required by all members
of the profession. Finance, as Mr Forster
suggests, is one of the big problems.
The interpretation which Mr Quinn’s
article provoked suggest that Mr Forster
is one, to use his own phrase, “whose
thinking is moving in a pattern reminis-
cent of the mediaeval guilds”.

A Messy Reid Murray
Full repayment of some debentures?
A lthough Reid Murray debenture
holders were thrown further into
the dark by the news of fresh doubts
over the ranking of the nine different
issues, the receivers actually indicated
that capital distributions were not as far
distant as was thought. The application
for a Supreme Court hearing has cleared
the way for an initial distribution. If
the Court finds that each of the nine
series ranks equally, an immediate return
of £25 per £lOO can be made. In the
meantime, the cash on hand is earning
£5OOO in bank interest every week.
The receivers have indicated that the
Court application could also clear the
way for the completion of all distribu-
tions within three years. Combined with
the news of an early initial return-this
should be of great value to debenture
holders. Complaints of the past few
months have centred more on “how soon
are we going to get some money” rather
than on “how much are we going to
get”.
Actually these new doubts over the
ranking of debentures will prove quite
a headache for the Court and the
receivers, especially the latter if the
former decides to uphold the doubts.
Originally, the Court had only to rule
on Series Three, which had not been
guaranteed in the same manner as the
other eight. It seems that money was
accepted from the public in excess of
the maximum provided by the trust deed.
Series Three was involved in this, too,
thereby putting six of the nine issues
in doubt. The Court has been asked to
decide whether moneys subscribed be-
yond the authorised limit rank equally
with money subscribed before the limit
was reached.
If the answer is negative, then the
receivers have to sit down to the
mammoth task of working out which
certificates were issued before the limit
and which were issued after. The
position will be complicated by the re-
payments and conversions between one
issue and another. At a. rough guess,
they estimate that more than £l2 million
of debentures could be adversely affected
if the Court should decide that there is a
difference of ranking.
If there is a difference, the eventual
total return of the untouched certificates
should be much greater. (It was estimated
a year ago at £75 or more, depending
on the ranking of Series Three.) If it is
decided that a further £l2 million does
not rank equally, all the more will be
available for the three unquestioned
series (First, Fourth and Ninth) and the
holders of certificates issued below the
authorised limit on the other six series.
Even more will be available if it is
decided that none of the Series Three
certificates rank equally.

• Electoral roll data for 800,000 electors.
• Technical College and Apprenticeship Examina-
tions and Junior Public Examinations (including
notification to candidates, processing of marks
and analyses of results for about 27,000 candi-
dates a year).
• A variety of technical and scientific work.
The ICT SERIES ISOQ range was announced in a simultaneous world-wide release on September 29, 1964.
Only eight months after this announcement, the equipment was installed and fully operational in the Data
Processing Branch of the Queensland Treasury Department.
This computer was manufactured and assembled by ICT in England. After undergoing extensive quality
control testing and trial operation it was despatched from England by air on Saturday, June 12, and
delivered to the Treasury Building in Brisbane on Monday, June 14. It was fully operational within 72
hours of delivery.

There are no indications of a price
recovery at present, although prices are
unpredictable. In 1964-65 the world
market price fell sooner and more dras-
tically than expected earlier in the year.
In July last year the price was down to

in February. It now stands at £stg2o
a ton.
Directors say raw sugar production
for the current season is expected to be
“somewhat” higher than the 697,000 tons
achieved last year. However, because of
unfavorable weather conditions, produc-
tion will fall well short of the planned
tonnage. Directors say, apart from a
normal half-yearly dividend from- Ready

sugar helped offset the profit fall.

indicate that in 1953-54, average over-award
payments in industry amounted to 10% of
the award wage. Today the figure has risen
to as much as 30%. In another ten years,
the extra percentage may well climb to
50%.
Over-award payments are made for only
one reason: to get good men who can pro-
duce well. Productivity is the key to indus-
trial success.
Yet the best man, however much you pay
him, is limited by the efficiency of the
equipment and procedures he works with.
This is particularly true in industrial weld-
ing.
We are proud of our welding machines
and electrodes. Yet we believe the most
important thing Lincoln Electric does for
our customers is to help them get maximum
welding productivity. This comes only from
using welding equipment and procedures in
the most efficient way.
In helping our customers determine how
to raise welding productivity, the man from
Lincoln draws on our organisation’s world-
wide knowledge, on our continuous research
and development work, and on the experi-
ence we have gained in becoming Aus-
tralia’s largest manufacturer of arc welding
equipment.
If welding is important in your operations,
you have the right to expect this sort of
help. It is included in the cost of machines
and electrodes. The man from Lincoln is
ready to offer it.
THE LINCOLN ELECTRIC COMPANY
SYDNEY • MELBOURNE • BRISBANE • ADELAIDE • PERTH • NEW ZEALAND
based G. H. Reid has announced that
1964-65 will produce a heavy loss be-
cause of difficulties on the US Navy pro-
ject. In 1963-64, its first full year on the
public list, a 10 p.c. dividend was paid
from a profit of £67,000. No dividend
will be paid for the latest year.
The loss was attributed to delays which
were outside the company’s control.
Directors expect a substantial improve-
ment in the general situation now that the
Monier group has taken sponsorship. The
group took over management from its US
partner, Paul Hardeman, following the
report of a 20 million dollar loss by the
latter in 1964. Hardeman was unable to
contribute further capital funds to the
joint venture.
However, in the light of the bad per-
formance so far and an apparent con-
tinued rise in costs (especially wages),
shareholders can only view dimly the
news that further contract work on the
project is to be undertaken. The con-
tracts cover another 16 months’ work on
the second and third stages the first is
still uncompleted.
Reid directors expect the new con-
tracts to return a satisfactory profit and
predict a return to profits in the current
year. The question is, how big will this
predicted profit be? That is, assuming that
a profit will be made. No doubt directors
were expecting profbs when they con-
tracted to stage one of the project. Such
was not the case, however, as share-
holders have painfully discovered.
Well Abel
A bel Lemon Holdings Ltd, importer
and wholesaler, increased profit by
nearly 50 p.c. in the year to March 31
its second year as a pub'ic company. Pro-
fit rose from £61,713 to £91,271, while
earning rate jumped from 17.6 p.c. to
26.1 p.c.
The profit rema'ned after substantially
increased provisions for tax (£74,605
compared with £ 46.674 the previous
year) and depreciation (£20,429 as
against £17,226). Dividend is held steady
at 10 p.c. with a final payment of 5 p.c.
The ss. shares, currently selling for
around 9s. 6d., are mid-way between the
year’s high of 10s. 6d. and low of Bs. 3d.
They yield 5.4 p.c. from the dividend and
14.1 p.c. from earivngs.

annual report he says sales for the year to
April 30 were slightly higher than in the
previous year. Turnover to December
last year was almost exactly the same as
in the corresponding period of 1963.
However, sales in the last four months
of the year improved and contributed to
the small rise in profit (from £241,408 to
£245,539). Itemising the group’s activi-
ties, Mr Dunlop says trading in the
wholesaling of paper and board was
again keenly competitive.
Forward orders in paper and stationery
do not indicate any slackening of demand
in the next few months, Mr Dunlop says.
Sales of machinery for graphic arts rose
in both Australia and New Zealand and
remain an important part of the com-
pany’s operations. Profit of the W. Nevill
and Co. subsidiary was affected in the
first half of the year by the move to
Alexandria (Sydney) but showed an
improvement in the second half.
Edwards Dunlop shares, at their pre-
sent price of 405., are exactly double par
value and yield 5 p.c. from the dividend,
which has been held at 10 p.c. for eight
successive years.
Rapidity Repeated
TI/lelbourne-based Robert Hutchinson,
the flour and feed milling group, has
once again proved to be the financial
world’s most speedy and comprehensive
reporter. The results for the year to
June 30 were delivered to the Stock Ex-
change at 5.30 that night after the books
had been ruled off just before five o’clock.
This was an even better effort than last
year, when the report did not arrive until
the next day (July 1). Despite this im-
provement, the report still contained a
detailed few paragraphs on trading acti-
vities, quite apart from the actual figures
pertaining to profit, tax, etc.
Rising costs and adverse seasonal fac-
tors took their toll obviously. Profit rose
from £94,000 to £104,000, compared
with the much sharper rise from £66,000
in the previous year. Earning rate, up
slightly at 23.7 p.c., provides adequate
cover for the maintenance of last year’s
maiden 10 p.c. dividend.
Dearer Fizz

losses by non-return and also suggested
that there could be a price adjustment.
Now Mr H. W. Cottee, chairman of
Cottee’s, has indicated that Sydney people
may soon pay higher prices for soft
drinks. He said in Sydney, where Cottee’s
largest soft drink market exists, that busi-
ness' was “very tough”. Directors are
hoping that the advent of British
Tobacco into the soft drink field (it owns
a majority interest in Shelleys Drinks in
Sydney) will bring about a more realistic
approach to pricing. There has been no
real adjustment in prices since 1953 in
some sizes of bottles.
Mr Cottee said soft drinks represented
a large, although not the largest, part of
the company’s turnover. However, des-
pite problems in the soft drink field,
directors were confident of the future.
He also revealed that, due to a short-
age of passionfruit pulp for several years,
the company has begun a passionfruit
growing project in Kenya with the co-
operation of the Kenya Government.
Not So Hot
Mount Isa dispute was the “unfore-
seen circumstance” which reduced
the profit of Melbourne-based Draffin
Everhot in the year to March 31. In-
creased copper prices, along with other
general expense increases, lowered the
result from £49,000 to £47,000. Divi-
dend has been returned to the basic 10
p.c. rate, after a 123 p.c. payout last
year which included a 23 p.c. 40th birth-
day bonus.
Had profits continued to rise, as was
expecred, the higher payout may very
well have been maintained. As it is, the
reduction seems more in regard to the
prospects of the current year than
1964-65 earning rate came back only
a little from 26 p.c. to 24.8 p.c., provid-
ing a very wide cover.
Sales in the first quarter of 1965-66
have been lowered by a slowing-up of
purchasing power as a result of what
directors claim to be tightening building
finance. In addition, severe drought in
some States has reduced the demand
which would normally be expected from
such areas. Some of these difficulties are
expected to be offset by the introduction
of a new electric range.
So the outlook for the current year
is far from satisfactory. Nevertheless,
there should be no trouble as far as the
10 p.c. is concerned. Earning
rate is high enough to withstand a sub-
stantial impact before a dividend cut has
to be entertained.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
The Envy of Investment Bankers?
Boral's takeovers and capital profits
VTo doubt many investors and others
' have read at least one of the
numerous books about Wall Street and
the United States financial scene which
have been published since the end of
World War 11. It would be quite possible
for them to see some similarity between
the remarkable deals done by the USA
investment bankers and corporations and
the recent activities of Boral Ltd. The
interim report of last March would only
have confirmed this similarity, as it con-
tained a statement that a capital surplus
of “approximately £4.8 million” had been
made during the six months. Despite the
glamorous aura, Boral’s shares are
currently selling at 225. 6d. Although
they have been as low as 21s. 9d. this
year, the present dividend yield is the
highest for nearly four years.
While there can be no doubt that the
deals which Boral has pulled off over the
last twelve to eighteen months have been
highly successful (and probably Aus-
tralia’s embryo investment bankers are
properly envious), the basic activities of
the company still seem to bulk very
large so far as the balance sheet and
profit statements are concerned. A full
description of these activities would now
fill as much space as is normally covered
by these articles in fact, I have seen
one “brief” description that ran into
more than 2000 words. But for a
succinct and undoubtedly factual descrip-
tion the take-over offer for Albion
Quarries has no equal: “The principal
activities of Boral are the refining of
crude oil and the sale of refined products
and through subsidiary companies it
holds a substantial investment portfolio
and is engaged in the petrochemical in-
dustry, coal mining, light engineering,
road surfacing and gas making and dis-
tribution.”
From pages 20 and 21 of the 1964
annual report, it appears that the “Boral
Group” accounts for about £8.6 million
of total capital (net current assets plus
fixed assets) out of the £36.4 million for
the whole group. Investments accounted
for not less than £12.9 million. The
remaining £14.9 million covers Petro-
chemical Holdings, the Hebburn Col-
lieries, Gas Supply Corporation,-Huddart
Parker and Mount Lyell Mining and
Railway Co. In other words, 24 p.c.,
35 p.c. and 41 p.c. represent the pro-
portions so far as the assets are con-
cerned.
Unfortunately, similar information is
not given in the annual report so far as
the profit breakdown is concerned. We
can, however, deduce a very rough
relationship between the parent com-
pany’s trading profit, the subsidiaries’
trading profits and the investment income
of the group over the last four years.
Because of its rough nature, only the
percentages are given:
1961 1962 1963 1964
Boral's profit 69.1 49.4 44.7 20.6
Subsidiaries 29.1 42.3 45.7 62.3
Investment Inc. 1.8 8.3 9.6 17.1
The 1964-65 year has already seen
some major changes and the paid ordin-
ary capital will be further increased by
the shares which are to be issued to
acquire the Melbourne quarry com-
panies, Albion and Reid’s. This latest
acquisition will mean that paid capital
will rise by at least £762,000; it will then
be 3.7 times as large as it was five years
ago. The interest in the Mount Lyell
Mining and Railway Co. has been sold
to Consolidated Goldfields. So outside
of some substantial interests in other
companies via the investment portfolios,
the group has now been reduced to a
position where there is fairly close
integration. The marked exception is the
Hebburn group, for there would seem
to be no clear relationship between oil
refining and coal mining except that they
both produce fuel. The Petrochemical
group is dependent on oil refining for
its feed stock. The Gas Supply group
will market liquified petroleum gas pro-
duced in oil refineries. The quarry com-
panies will supply aggregate to be mixed
with bitumen supplied by Boral.
TThtE record over the last nine years
seems to be quite good so far as the
return on capital is concerned, though
the period from 1957-58 to 1961-62
seems to have been a rather erratic one.
The percentages are as follows: 1955-56,
27.5; 1956-57, 28.9; 1957-58, 18.1;
1958-59, 21.1; 1959-60, 30.4; 1960-61,
20.8; 1961-62, 16.4; 1962-63, 21.5;
1963-64, 21.4.
There is, apparently, every possibility
that, given the markets for its products,
Boral should be able to earn at least 20
p.c. on its operating assets in the future.
The wonder, therefore, is why the com-
pany should continue to hold a sub-
stantial investment portfolio which pro-
vided an income of only 3.9 p.c. on
market value at June 30, 1964. The
obvious answer would, of course, be
that capital profits are just as valuable
as dividend income and the £4.8 million
profit made this year is equal to 37 p.c.
of the book value of the investments at
June 30 last. The counter to this answer
is that such deals cannot be made
regularly (and if they were the Tax Com-
missioner would become interested).
Basically, the Boral takeovers have
been directed towards ensuring markets
for the refinery products. So investors
should look mainly to the results from
the Boral group rather than the more
spectacular “deals” which have been the
subject of so much Press comment in the
last nine months. The fields in which
the group is active are now very com-
petitive, but this should not worry a
company which set out to compete with
the international oil groups nearly 20
years ago. There seems no doubt that
about six months ago many people
thought that Boral’s shares were worth
30s. They are now selling 25 p.c. below
this figure. As this fall is much more
than the general market fall, the shares
could be considered undervalued, but
the addition of more than three million
shares to the market would certainly
account for the depressed price.
On the face of it, the dividend, even
on the increased capital, is well covered.
Although the general manager is against
bonus issues, there are some prospects
that this dividend could be increased in
the future. However, it is difficult to
see any direct benefits to shareholders
from the substantial capital profits which
have been made during the 1964-65 year.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Slow Path to Recovery
Mark Foy's battles on
TV)R\vard planning of Mark Foy’s Ltd,
city and suburban retailer, took a
severe blow when the company was re-
jected as the main tenant of a new
shopping centre to be built at the near-
city suburb of Burwood. The rejection
followed three years of planning and
negotiation.
In fact, as the chairman explained,
draft lease agreements were in the hands
of the company’s solicitors when the
directors were informed that they had
been outbid for the site.
Directors had considered it the prime
site in the Sydney metropolitan area, but,
having missed out, immediately brought
into effect the second phase of forward
planning—the establishment of a number
of small fashion and home furniture
stores in suitable areas. They say the
profitability of these types of stores has
already been demonstrated to their satis-
faction. The first two of these stores
should be opened in the second half of
the current year and more sites are under
investigation.
The task of the present board has not
been easy since a reshuffle in control,
early in 1962, saw the then chairman and
managing director, Mr H. M. Macken,
replaced by an outside director, Mr
A. V. Hancock, as chairman. Since then
Mr Macken has spearheaded a vigorous
campaign to regain control of the com-
pany.
He was narrowly defeated at the
annual meeting in 1962, and again in
1963. After a respite in 1964, Mr
Macken returned to the fray at this
year’s annual meeting, held early this
month, with the nomination of his
nephew as a director and with the in-
tention of increasing the size of the
present board from seven to nine. Despite
vigorous campaigning behind the scenes,
Mr Macken and his supporters were
defeated by a substantial majority.
The present board, which includes a
large number of executive members, took
office at an extremely difficult time
when the effect of the 1960 credit
squeeze was still being felt widely, and
business in the southern end of the city
area was dying off rapidly.
However, it tackled its problems with
vigor and imagination, and, in order to
increase the return from the main Piazza
store, took the drastic step of closing
down retail operations on the top two
floors of the main store and leasing the
space for offices. In addition, part of
the basement area, adjacent to the under-
ground railway entrance, was closed and
leased to a restaurant chain.
The nearby car park was leased to a
car distribution group and the Target
Woollen Mills manufacturing subsidiary
was sold at a substantial capital profit.
Liquidity was improved by negotiation
-
of a long-term loan with a life office, the
balance of which has only recently been
drawn on.
The board made no hasty promises of
recovery and, in fact, warned that the full
effects would not begin to be felt until
the current year. Events seem to be
bearing them out.
Profit in the latest year to February
28 came out at £75,831, strengthened by
the income from rented space. This
profit, equal to 11 p.c. on capital, is the

best result since the £135,514 earned in
1960-61. The 1963 profit of £115,005
was boosted by a dividend of £54,000
from a subsidiary.
Despite the loss of £41,093 incurred in
1962, dividend payments have been con-
tinued, although the 12} p.c. payments
in 1962 and 1963 were met wholly or
partly from reserves. Profits during the
past two years have covered the distribu-
tions last year’s eight p.c. by more
than £16,000.
The company’s liquid position is
healthy, with short - term borrowings
largely replaced by the long-term loan.
Cash and other liquid items are more
than adequate to meet any sudden drain
on funds.
Stock has been carefully controlled
and in the light of the difficult trading
conditions and the reduced selling area
at the Piazza store is down from
£1,092,057 to £1,025,170. Trade debtors,
however, are up from £457,545 to
£512,298.
Directors can justifiably be pleased
with the latest year’s results, yet there
is still no room for complacency. The
income from rented space certainly acts
as a buffer. But improvement in earn-
ings must now come from retailing
operations and this will not be easy to
achieve.
The removal of the city bus section
may improve business activity at the
Piazza store, although disconsolate
traders in the southern end of the city
wonder whether the move has been made
too late to be effective. Only time will
tell.
The shares are currently selling a
little below par. Prospects of immediate
capital gain are slim. The shares could
well be locked away.
BROLITE INDUSTRIES LTD
Many Colored
ss. shares of Brolite Industries
Ltd seem attractive as a long-term
proposition at present. At the time of
writing, they are fetching around 235. on
the market and yielding a low 3.2 p.c.
from the 15 p.c. dividend. This price is
not historically high although, by the
same token, the shares were as low as
16s. back in 1960. (Actually, the price
was 325. but this was before the face
value was split from 10s.) High point
since 1960 was reached last year when,
as ss. shares, they, touched 335. 6d.
Ironically, the low price of 1960 was
reached despite the fact that the 1959-
60 year saw a record profit of £129,000
(since surpassed) and a gigantic earning
rate of 51.8 p.c. (still the record). Divi-
dend was held steady at 15 p.c. The
low price prevailed because, since forma-
tion in 1950, no issue had been made to
shareholders. Thus, despite the excellent
growth record of the group, the shares
were considered good for income pur-
poses only.
The following three years changed all
this. In 1960-61, shareholders received
a one-for-four par issue. In 1962-63 the
shares were split and an asset revaluation
enabled a one-for-four bonus issue to be
made. Dividend was held at 15 p.c.
throughout and still stands at that rate
today.
Earning rate, of course, came back,
but never gave a less than two-fold cover
for the dividend. It was 36.4 p.c. in
1960-61, 40.4 p.c. in 1961-62, 35 p.c.
in 1962-63 and recovered last year to
36.2 p.c. Although this situation was
basically a result of capital increases, the
credit squeeze had some effect on pro-

TOP PRIZE
WINKER POR
TWELVE YEARS
Since Its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
- throughout Australia and in Europe,
East year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
Unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green-bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It ik one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

fits. In 1960-61 they came back from
£129,000 to £114,000, then grew to
£126,000 and £136,000 before reaching
a record £140,000 last year.
The current year will see another
record profit and a higher earning rate.
In the first six months to March 31,
profit rose to £78,000. No comparable
figure is available for the previous half,
yet it seems the full year’s result will
come out at around £150,000 to
£160,000 equal to an earning rate of
something like 40 p.c. after deducting
preference dividends. The interim report
announced a steady half-yearly dividend
of 1\ p.c. on the ordinary capital.
Shareholders are now waiting for
another issue. Earnings are high, the
future looks good, and the accounts
could stand it. In fact, the group could
be described as rather under-capitalised.
Ordinary capital of £375,000 is out-
weighed more than twice by reserves of
£884,000. Preference capital is only
£60,000 and there are no long-term bor-
rowings on the books whatsoever. How-
ever, past history shows that an issue
is not necessarily imminent, in spite of
these factors. Therefore, any purchase
should be made only with the medium
or long term in view.
The table shows steady current assets
growth coupled with slow current lia-
bilities growth, giving a favorable over-
all trend for working capital. Fixed assets
have doubled in four years, largely
because of the 1962 revaluation. Intan-
gibles have been well written back.
Capital, reserves, etc., have been men-
tioned above and, to repeat, offer promise
for the future. Depreciation seems low
in relation to fixed assets. Tax is normal
and shows a jump last year in line with
the increased company rate despite only
a small profit rise. Earning rates and
profits are, of course, enviable, while
the downward slide in dividend yield
reflects the transition from an income
to a capital growth stock. The big drop
in 1963 share prices is accounted for
by the share split.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Two Divisions of Share Market
And the first-ever debenture buy
Tf the Stock Exchange decided to
break the share market up into
sections again, might I suggest two basic
groups—the Potter section and the non-
Potter section. Or, to give the sections
their full title, the Sir lan Potter section
and the non-Sir lan Potter section.
Had this proposed division occurred,
then it would be the Potter section that
would be holding my interest this week.
Already in the portfolio is the little com-
pany, Eglo Engineering, floated by the
men of Potter a few months ago.
Although the market price of about
ss. 9d. was less than a shilling above
the issue price, the stags were busy in
there. In fact, already one quarter of
the public issue has been turned over.
Given a better market atmosphere, this
promising little stock would have come
on around the 7s. 6d. level. Even in
this market, it should get there
eventually.
The same cannot be said about Mr
Whippy. Or at least that’s what the
market felt initially when the shares,
placed at 7s. 6d., came on at ss. 9d.
Newly listed companies have generally
undergone some sort of capital recon-
struction before an issue is made to the
public. In the case of Mr Whippy, the
reconstruction resulted in an asset back-
ing of 2s. Bd. Shareholders thus paid
4s. lOd. for goodwill.
What does this goodwill represent?
The company has only been on the road
for two years and in that time has shown
an average earning rate of 12 p.c. on
the present total share capital.
Such a picture frightened me away
from subscribing to the float. But when
the shares came on at ss. 9d., 1 figured
they could run up toward their issue
price. I bought 400 at ss. 9d.
My next purchase, also from the
Potter section, was £2OO of Ford 1\ p.c.
debentures. Out of the hundreds of
transactions made in this column, this is
the first fixed-interest security purchase.
Let me assure readers it has not quite
yet got to a stage of desperation.
It is worth bearing in mind that this
debenture issue is guaranteed by the
parent company, the Ford Company of
US, whose latest profit was double the
issued capital of BHP. Surely such a
debenture issue compares with the listed
CSR and BHP debentures which sell on
a 7 p.c. redemption yield. On this basis
the Ford issue has got i p.c. start, so
it should mean a fairly hefty market
premium when it is listed.
To square the accounts I sold off the
1000 Hanimex shares at 15s. 6d.
Although that’s above my average pur-
chase price, brokerage made its presence
felt and a loss of £l5 w 7 as incurred.
Much more serious was the loss of £43
on the 400 R. and N. Statham covered
at 10s.
After finishing these transactions I
decided to look more closely at that
letter from Amalgamated Chemicals
which I mentioned last week. In so
doing, I realised how vague it was.
First, the simple statement that “sales
for the first five months of 1965 are up
on the comparable period of 1964” may
well be misleading if it includes sales
for subsidiaries not acquired until after
May, 1964. This applies equally to the
statement: “Group profitability is ex-
pected to be not less than last year.”
And just what does it mean when it
is said that debtor collection has im-
proved on last' year? As no actual sales
figures are given, we do not know how
bad or good debtor collection was last
year. As the point is made in the letter
that comparison of debtors and stock
figures are only valid when they are com-
pared with turnover, why then are not
actual turnover figures disclosed? Too
many question marks for me!

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Wool Debate in Victoria
Gunn rides high once more
Tf the Committee for the Retention and
Improvement of the Free Auction
System of Wool Selling is to make head-
way in its campaign against the reserve
price proposal, then it needs to talk more
about improvements and less about re-
tention. This is the lesson which it
should take to heart after the first clash
between the committee’s leader, Mr R.
Macarthur-Onslow, and the Wool Board
chief, Sir William Gunn, at the special
meeting of the Victorian wool section of
the Australian Primary Producers’ Union
in Melbourne.
In a few, not particularly well-
informed, circles it had .been suggested
that the APPU would join forces with
the Retention and Improvement Com-
mittee in opposing the Wool Board’s
reserve price plan. An added incentive
to the APPU would have been its failure
to gain admission to the Australian Wool
Industry Conference. Yet when the
chips were down the APPU delegates in
Melbourne voted 59 to 37 in favor of
supporting the reserve price plan.
They listened patiently to both Mr
Macarthur-Onslow and Sir William
Gunn (there were no fireworks). While
the APPU men are, with pretty good
reason, still unhappy about the Wool
Industry Conference shutting the door
on them, they are accepting the situation
for the time being anyway.
The interest was in the clash between
Sir William and Mr Macarthur-Onslow.
It was hardly a clash. Gunn won every
round.
Mr Macarthur-Onslow, albeit a fine
man, nevertheless was at a disadvantage
on the podium. He read his speech
straight from the typescript, his voice
was difficult to hear at times, he had
difficulty with the microphone, and he
missed at least one glorious opportunity
to follow a lead from the floor on the
general effect of Government 'participa-
tion in primary produce marketing. The
best he could do in reply to this question
was to say that he did not know much
about that.
Gunn, on the other hand, was at his
cockiest and he can be a very cocky
fellow. He cracked jokes, he bullied,
and he came armed with masses of
documents and brochures for the statis-
tically minded. He must have started
out knowing full well that, despite his
sincerity, Mr Macarthur-Onslow stands
for just about everything the APPU does
not.
It is a strong organisation in many
ways. It has probably the best organisa-
tional structure of any primary producer
organisation in the country, yet it has
always been a noticeably “agin” body.
Why this is so is not easy to analyse.
Originally, perhaps, it might have had
something to do with the farmers of
Irish extraction who belonged to it, but
this hardly applies today. Today it is

a mixture of big producers who, in many
cases, are rebels from the Graziers’ As-
sociation, and medium to small men who
quite often maintain cross-membership
with other organisations.
It is a matey group and it devotes a
good deal of its activities to farming
experiments and research activities. It
contains a number of active farming
theorists, big and small, and it maintains
sections in all divisions of primary pro-
duction. It is probably stronger in dairy-
ing than in woolgrowing and is definitely
stronger in Victoria than in any other
State. Partly due to its theorists it has
long advocated an appraisal type of
system for wool marketing far more
radical a method than the Wool Board’s
reserve price scheme.
The APPU gives a distinct impression
that it regards the reserve price scheme
as a first step to something more radical.
So in this sense Mr Macarthur-Onslow
was starting way behind scratch. To win
them over he would have had to talk
strongly in terms of improvement to the
present free auction system. The fact
that he, and his friends, think the
present system is a fine thing is just not
good enough. The APPU does not. The
APPU wool section did add a rider to
its endorsement of the reserve price
plan. It suggested that woolgrowers
should have the opportunity of review-
ing it in five years’ time at another
referendum. This, in a way, means that
if the APPU is not in the Wool Industry
Conference in five years’ time, then it
will fight against the plan. But the
chances are that it will be either in the
Wool Industry Conference or that it will
have merged with the Victorian Wheat
and Woolgrowers’ Association.
This does not mean that the APPU in
Victoria will have buried itself. Far from
it-
What is envisaged is a new body called
the Victorian Farmers’ Union. It is quite
possible that the APPU will be the
dominant force in the new body. Plans
for this are under way, but have had
some rather severe setbacks.
Yet shadows in these things can some-
times be seen where there are none. The
rejection by the Wool Industry Con-
ference and the effect it was supposed
to have is a case in point.
There is need to make a precise defini-
tion in relation to this APPU vote. It
was not a vote by the all-embracing Aus-
tralian body of the APPU, nor of the
entire Victorian APPU. It was a vote
by the wool section of the Victorian
APPU. The structure of the APPU is
such that it would be extremely unlikely
for the APPU as a whole to follow any-
thing but the lead of this group. It can
be taken as yet another victory for Sir
William Gunn. He is really riding high
now.
Once, not so long ago, Gunn was a
dreary speaker. Today he is about as
adroit a speaker as can be found in this
country. He is definitely better than
most in Federal Parliament and he is not
far behind Menzies.
In a way, Mr Macarthur-Onslow’s flat
delivery actually helped Gunn in that it
permitted him, sensing the meeting was'
becoming bored, to boldly turn a quite
serious question into a spark of humor.
Example: Are you aware, Sir William,
of what wheat stabilisation has actually
cost the wheatgrower? (Not a bad ques-
tion really, if the recent sales to Red
China are excluded.)
Gunn: Turn it up. I’ve met a lot of
wheatgrowers and all I know about
wheat is that when it rains up my way
I’m going to put some wheat into the
ground myself.
Jingling Johnnie and His Mates
A guide to shearers’ slang
By JOHN ARMITAGE
A ustralian outback history is rich
with the development of slang
peculiar to Australia. Surely the richest
source of this slang has been the outback
shearing sheds.
In days gone by, hairy-arsed learners
were few in shearing sheds of the
Darling showers country. Cunnamulla
guns were held in great contempt, as
was the babbler. Ding dongs were
plentiful; so were Jingling Johnnies. A
greasy ate loblolly for breakfast and
spread cocky’s joy on his brownie.
Generally he wore a Jacky Howe to
work and tied his dungas with bowyangs.
Unintelligible talk perhaps, but never-
theless fascinating. So fascinating, in
fact, that the Australian Language
Research Centre at the University of
Sydney has made a study of it. The
Centre has released Part 1 of an
occasional paper, “The Terminology of
the Shearing Industry”, by J. S. Gunn.
The paper, in booklet form, covers shear-
ing shed terminology from A-L.
The paper includes, of course, such
well-known and rather mundane terms
as bellies, board boy, broomie, cast for
age, clip, expert and many more. What
is more interesting is the collection of
words and phrases which are genuinely
shearing shed terms, though little known
now outside the industry.
I don’t remember when I last laughed
so much over a phrase of genuine Aus-
tralian slang as I did when I read
“hairy-arsed learner”. Thinking about
it more deeply, its meaning is simple.
According to the paper, it is applied to
a man who has probably shorn hundreds
of thousands of sheep in his day, but

whose skill has been much reduced by
age or infirmity.
On the other hand, the terms “ding
dong” and “Cunnamulla gun” are not
so quickly understood. Ding dong
describes the ultimate in cadgers; as a
shearing friend once said to Mr Gunn:
“A bludger who bludges off bludgers”.
Cunnamulla gun is a derogatory term for
a flash shearer whose best shearing and
big tallies are made at the pub in town
- in other words, a boaster.
Babbler is an abbreviation of babbling
brook, rhyming slang for the cook —a
much-maligned person with many nick-
names. Mr Gunn says most of these
are mere labels and would now be used
irrespective of his skill, yet they reflect
poor cooks rather than good ones.
Examples are: bab, baitlayer, black-
smith, cook-coo, crippen, doctor, dough
spoiler, greasy look, poisoner, Sally
Thompson, and water burner.
Greasy refers to a shearer. He’s
called that because his skin becomes very
greasy from the oil in a fleece. His
shearing clothes are called greasies, an
appropriate name for clothing impreg-
nated with this grease. The loblolly he
eats for breakfast is really porridge,
sometimes it’s called burgoo. The cocky’s
joy he spreads on his brownie is treacle.
Brownie, of course, is bread baked with
fruit and sugar.
A Jacky Howe, which a shearer wears
when he is working, is a sleeveless flannel
singlet cut nearly to the waist under
the arms. It was named after a famous
hand-shearer who, it has been claimed,
established a world record of 321 sheep
shorn in 7 hours 40 minutes at Alice
Downs, in Queensland. Dungas is a
more modern term referring to shear-
ing pants; bowyangs were cords used to
tie below the knees. Bowyangs kept the
leg ends down, preventing rough burry
sheep from rubbing against the shearer’s
skin.
A Jingling Johnnie, an alliterative
term which is a basic form of slang,
originally referred to a swagman or bag-
man. In many districts it was also an-
other term for a hand-shearer. Mr Gunn
says the link is obvious. Many of the
old shearers carried their swags from
shed to shed and no doubt their shears
and billy cans jingled as they walked.
The paper is crammed with fascina-
ting pieces of Australiana. Take, for
example, “from the breezer to the
sneezer”. This refers to the long blow
made by the shearer in shearing a sheep.
The shearing handpiece starts at the tail
and is moved up the backbone to the
top of the head, almost on to the nose,
hence “breezer to sneezer”. What could
be more Australian than that?
Even Jimmy Gibbs rates a mention
in the paper. Shearers still talk about
“doing a Jimmy Gibbs”. Mr Gunn says
Jimmy Gibbs was almost a legendary
figure, renowned for his big shearing
tallies and reputation as a lover. Known
as the greatest “slave” of them all, while
others had a spell on the hour Jimmy
was said to up-end a waterbag with one
hand, scratch or relieve himself with the
other, and. feel for a barebelly sheep
with one bag-booted foot.
To “do a Jimmy Gibbs” is to shear
furiously near the end of a run and to
rush to the catching pen to get a bell
sheep. A bell sheep is the last sheep
shorn by any shearer in any run of the
day. It has to be clear of the catching
pen before the bell goes, indicating the
end of a run. Mr Gunn says this is a
matter of timing; a shearer likes to get
a difficult bell sheep because he can then
take his time with it in the break that
follows.
Standards for Farm Machines
NFU takes up the cause
npHE bewildering array of specifications
in various types of machinery used
on farms is no help to the man interested
in purchasing new equipment or replac-
ing worn parts.
Take chain saws, for example. Some
are rated in US horsepower, some in
British horsepower, and some in Con-
tinental ratings. They are all different
and they make comparison of per-
formance very difficult.
The same thing goes for fuel con-
sumption, with the important differences
in litres, US gallons and imperial gallons.
It could be said that the average city
man, using a motor car, has the same
problem. But not quite. For the farmer
the margin of costs can be a vital factor
in his profit or loss for the year. The
performance of his machinery makes up
a significant part of his costs.
These matters can be related, of
course, provided you know the formulae
and you are good at figures. The
majority of farmers, however, usually
go on the say-so of the salesman and
that is not always as accurate as it
should be.
There is good work going on at
present in this field and farmers may
soon expect to see the results. The Inter-
national Standards Organisation is at-
tempting to create universal standards
for a wide range of farm equipment.
These include dimensions of knife sec-
tions, discs and square axles; screw
threads for nozzles and all categories of
dust sprayers; methods of lubricating
agricultural machinery with particular
regard to grease nipples; study of fixing
points for harrow spikes, cultivator
blades and binder knives.
Some 40 countries are participating in
the work of the International Standards
Organisation, including Australia, USA,
Canada, Britain, Russia, Japan and
South Africa. The National Farmers’
Union of Australia is taking a close view
of the proceedings and makes regular
contact with the Australian Standards
Association.
NFU president, Mr A. F. Havard, says
that, while the work must necessarily be
slow and will be spread over a number
of years, it should be obvious that it must
eventually pay off in real dividends for
cost-conscious farmers.

75?
Nobody was expecting it for another
ten years. Even BMC were a little sur-
prised when their designers came out
with something so revolutionary, yet so
positively good to look at.
REVOLUTIONARY SUSPENSION ~
It has a completely new idea in sus-
pensions, a fluid and rubber system
that absorbs every road shock and
eliminates pitch or sway or bounce. It
keeps the car flat—even on the tightest
bends. The name they gave this sus-
pension is ‘Hydrolastic’* and they
coined a phrase ‘it floats on fluid’ to
let people know about it.
EAST-WEST ENGINE UNIT
To save space the engine unit (combin-
ing engine, gearbox and transmission)
was placed crosswise at the front of
the car. This gave superb road holding
because the car had front wheel
drive and all the weight of the engine
,was directly above the wheels that
steer and pull the car along.
AMAZING SPACE AND COMFORT~
Another result of putting the engine
east-west (and of having the road
wheels at the very corners of the car)
was an amazing amount of interior
space. The car has more leg room and
hip room and elbow room than any
car we know short of a luxury
limousine (and the most comfortable
seats). But the outside length was kept
down TeOrcould
squeeze into impossible parking gaps
and slide neatly through exasperating
traffic jams.
AND PERFORMANCE TO MATCH
As if these advantages weren’t enough,
the designers managed to build amaz-
ing performance into the car: more than
75 m.p.h. and 45 m.p.g. And, with the
cornering advantage of front wheel
drive and Hydrolastic* suspension it
proved faster point-to-point than others
with twice its horsepower. Seek it out,
now, at your nearby BMC dealer.
