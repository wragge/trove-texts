ONE OF THE WORLD’S SEVEN WONDERS, THE GIANT’S CAUSEWAY
'T'HE Giant’s Causeway in County Antrim, six miles from Portrush, is one
of Nature’s geographical mysteries, and besides giving inspiration to many
legends has caused much scientific speculation and argument. The “Honey-
comb” shown here consists of 40,000 stone columns, is only a small- part of
this unique natural phenomenon, which is one of the most surprising and
beautiful sights in Northern Ireland. The stone structure, which is of natural
origin, consists of tiers upon tiers of almost perfectly cut piles of basalt,
rising majestically above one another like the pipes of a gigantic organ.
The visitor is astonished by the symmetry and regularity of the hexagonal
columns; one would think they had all been cast from the same mould
or finished oft by the same hand. There are more legends about the Giant’s
Causeway than would fill a fat volume, and one is not surprised to hear
that it has been numbered among the seven wonders of the world.
The north-west coast of Scotland was once the scene of a violent volcanic
action, and the subterranean disturbances found a vent along a line from
the Isle of Skye to Northern Ireland, the effects of which may be traced
through the Isles of Staffa, Mull and Islay. A great quantity of liquid basalt
was ejected to the surface, which, on cooling, contracted into a myriad
hexagonal and pentagonal columns of various tones of yellow and red. The
Giant’s Causeway, which may be reached via the Antrim coast road through
the magnificent Glens of Antrim, is a sight for which it is alone worth making
a journey to Northern Ireland,

CENSORSHIP.
When Mr. Justice Martin had the
author of Love Me, Sailor standing be-
fore him handcuffed -like a common
criminal, when he committed the author
to jail during the unpleasant interval
between conviction and sentence, and
when he imposed on the author a term of
three months’ imprisonment with a fine of
£lOO and on the publishers a fine of £5OO
he profoundly shocked the entire com-
munity of art and letters in Australia.
In the last six months Victoria has had
two trials in which -obscenity was the
issue. The first was an appeal by a
Viennese solicitor against a previous con-
viction for having imported obscene
literature -and obscene illustrations. The
second was the double trial of Robert S.
Close and Georgian House.
The first case was tried by a Judge
without a jury and evidence was taken
from artists and experts that the books in
question were not pornographic. With
regard to the illustrations the Judge took
the enlightened view that what could be
described verbally was equally capable
of being described visually, and as
Casanova’s memoirs were available to the
public in Australia there was no reason
why visual descriptions of them shouldn’t
be available also. He expressed himself
as astonished at the previous proceedings
and quashed the conviction.
The Judge who tried the first case is
a cultivated man who had heard of
Casanova and may have read him. The
jury in the second case were average
citizens who possibly had. never read a
line of Shakspeare since the expurgated
editions of their schooldays. They were
ordinary men-in-the-street who, presum-
ably, would not be shocked at reports
of rape or assault in the dailies and yet
cannot tolerate the same sort of thing in
a novel.
There is not one great artist or great
writer of the past, from the authors of
the Old Testament to Shakspeare, or from
Titian to Renoir, whose works would be
passed by an average jury. In the
first case a Judge who is much more
enlightened than the average jury, and
who took the opinion of experts, dis-
missed the charge. In the second cate no
literary man was asked if the novel
alleged to be an obscene libel was, in
fact, a work of art, and the Judge took
the view that Close (who actually
was setting down a bitter and puritanic
concept of life) had merely indulged in
“salacity” for the purpose of “large
sales.” In fining the publishing house
(which has given magnificent support to
Australian poets, critics and novelists and
has never, like some other firms, pushed
Australian work aside for cheap overseas
reprints) the Judge said only that it was
one of those entities which “has neither
a body to kick nor a soul to damn.”
The Court of Criminal Appeal, by wip-
ing out the prison sentence on Close and
by reducing the fine on Georgian House
to £3OO, has done something to restore
confidence of writers and artists in the
judiciary, the function of which, in the
literature of a civilised community, is
surely more than to see that the literature
is palatable to children and innocuous to'
morons and perverts.
But the law which the Judges are
compelled to administer, and the
whole procedure of censorship in
Australia, must obviously be altered.
Australian writers have been tempted
to laugh when literature has suffered
the bludgeonings of policemen who,
like the immortal detective-sergeant
iof the Vice Squad in the We Were the
Rats case, have never heard of Shelley
and do not know Shakspeare’s Christian
name; and there may be something
comic (“There is nothing so ridiculous,”
said Macaulay, “as the British nation in
one of its periodical fits of outraged
virtue”) when one of the world’s classics
is banned by some preposterous clerk of
the Customs Department; but when an
outmoded English law dating back to
1727 can be dragged up to send authors
to jail the true danger of censorship be-
comes clear. Whether or not a jail
sentence is imposed all attacks by censor-
ship are, essentially, an assault on culture.
Culture must be judged by men who
know all that the term implies. It has
always been a fundamental prin-
ciple of British justice that a man should
be judged by his peers, and in the Close
case the peers of the man who was sent to
prison are his fellow-writers. To be
judged by average citizens whose ac-
quaintance with literature is probably
confined to the quiz sessions of the
A.B.C. is a travesty of justice. It is most
unlikely that one of the 12 well-inten-
tioned men empanelled would be capable
of differentiating between the positive and
objective approach to his subject of the
man who wrote the book and the nega-
tive approach to the same subject which
we see in every issue of the Sunday
papers which specialise in reports of rape,
divorce and murder and yet sell on every
bookstall, or in the purveyors of porno-
graphic postcards.
Some plan must be adopted by the
Commonwealth or all the State Govern-
ments on the lines suggested in The
Bulletin in Red Page and Plain English
articles whereby books against which a
complaint has been made cam be sub-
mitted to a board of literary and uni-
versity men who have a proper knowledge
of the world’s literature and of contem-
porary standards of freedom in England
and America, and who are capable of
deciding whether the author’s intention
was pornographic or artistic. Such a
board does, in fact, exist to deal with
books banned by the Customs. Its'opera-
tions, if any, are conducted in a
highly undesirable secrecy, but it
provides a nucleus from which could be
developed the only possible form of
censorship which would be tolerable to
the profession of letters and which would
not be a disgrace to Australian civilisa-
tion.

"Forgotten Island."
Captain P. G. Taylor’s Forgotten
Island (Shakespeare Head), the record of
his survey flight from Mexico to Aus-
tralia, is told with simply-expressed forc-
ible writing based on observation and
experience. He employs something of
the technique of the fiction-writer. There
is continuous narrative, with good
character-depiction of his Catalina crew,
suspense and other essentials of fiction
while recording actual travel, auto-
biography and adventure.
The book had its origin in Taylor’s be-
lief in the importance of an alternative
southern flying route to the Hawaiian
line from Acapulco, in Mexico, to Clip-
perton (“Forgotten Island”), the Mar-
quesas or Tuamotus, Society and Cook
Islands, thence to New Zealand and Aus-
tralia, Though nothing reliable was
known of surface winds and weather on
the long eastern leg of this route, he be-
lieved that as the line’s greater length
was tropical and far from the influence
of large land masses, it would have wind
and weather Advantages over the present
northern route. For ferrying war air-
craft (survey was begun in 1942) and
for post-war air communication the new
route’s importance was emphatic.
The pioneer found objection after ob-
jection raised to his plan —no aircraft to
spare, preoccupation with the war in
Europe and fear that America might con-
sider the survey a bid for post-war air
supremacy —but, striding on 100-league
boots in Transport Command from Lon-
don to Washington, to Canada and back
to London, he smothered them all. Pre-
cisely how he did it is not quite clear,
but the impression received is that finding
a lone pinnacle of rock in the Pacific
would be tarmac stuff compared to that
course through the red-tape maze.
When his Catalina eventually flew over
Acapulco, picked crew of four aboard
and the Pacific below him, Taylor saw
“the first really tangible evidence of the
fact that we had shaken off the shackles
which had held us for so long.”
Plans for expeditions seem to appeal
to the boy in us as much as their imple-
mentation, and there is something of
Robinson Crusoe’s raft-building in the
preparation of the Catalina for her long
flight. Weight was reduced to the mini-
mum. Superfluous fittings and equipment
were scrapped. Fuel-tanks were added
along her belly, rubber dinghies for
emergency landings and fishing on coral
atolls, fresh food, canned food and con-
centrated food for emergency; fish-
spears, strong anchors, sextants, smoke-
floats and presents for Polynesians,
With his craft loaded and wallowing,
ready for deserted Clipperton, Taylor
summarises the purpose of his flight:
To discover whether a route by the S.
Pacific to Australia could be developed,
•and if so to select islands and sites upon
it. To observe and record meteorological
conditions and their influence upon the
passage of aircraft this way. To investigate
health and medical aspects of places visited.
To examine and record natural and other
resources of these islands relevant to their
use as bases. To report upon anything
likely to influence the future use of this
region as an airway. „
Clipperton Island is a lonely atoll
which was inhabited 45 years ago by a
ba‘nd of phosphate-diggers, whose story,
briefly told, reads like another Pitcairn
Island. And though his romancing is
somewhat flowery, when the flier returns
to his element there is some fine descrip-
tive writing. The Catalina, a few hours
out from Mexico, meets) a storm:
The black wall comes in towards us,
hung with a shroud of streaming water.
She smashes into the torrent and splathers
it shrieking .back at the screen, roaring
harshly at the hull. I ride some violent ,
movement, seeking to control it through
unexplainable insinuation that comes
through my body to eyes, hands and feet.
Rate of climb goes soaring, and there is
a breathless feeling as the claws of the
cloud-base grasp the wing and try to
drag us up. Bouncing and flicking her
wing-tips, she shakes off the grip of the
cloud and breaks through to a dark cavern
of clear air. The tearing of water sud-
denly ceases.
Though at times the pilot is obscure to
a landlubber, there is no dearth of
description throughout the rest of the ad-
venture. The book is at its descriptive
best when describing a hurricane that
rears great ridges of water right over
their tiny island, and the Catalina, given
up for lost, flies herself like a kite on her
mooring-line.
Until the U.S. base on Bora Bora,
near Tahiti, is reached, the clew are en-
tirely self-dependent, and Taylor pays
generous tribute to his navigator, engineer
and wireless operator, particularly the
first; perhaps because, as navigator of
Kingsford Smith’s Altair on her return
crossing from Australia to California in
1934, Taylor is fully aware of the diffi-
culties of pioneer navigation when the
point of arrival is literally a point of rock
in a vast emptiness of ocean.
Taylor went on to survey all his land-
ing-points after Clipperton mainly with-
out incident, and finally set his craft
down on Rose Bay, Returning to Canada
to hear how far the promised base-con-
struction at Clipperton had progressed,
he found the gear-loaded Dakotas still
earth-bjound and his island and whole
project in danger of being forgotten,
snagged again in the miasma of diplo-
matic discussion.
Whether, as the pioneer hopes, the pigs
and gannets of Clipperton Island will
hear the roar of trans-Pacific aircraft is
yet to be seen. He seems to have pro-
duced a sound route for their passage ;
he has produced, with the helpful assist-
ance of an exceptionally fine lot of photo-
graphs, a very readable book.
Kings from Backstage .
A reader who, in theory, would take up
arms for King Charles any day of the
week against thq, Roundheads is likely
to raise his voice in lamentation at certain
chapters of Philip Lindsay’s Hampton
Court (Meridan Books), What is Philip
Lindsay, of all people, doing writing of
Cromwell as “that laughing giant” and of
Charles as “this truly pathetic king”? :
This is a truly pathetic king who limps
after his shambling father... .Devoid of
humor, with the exaggerated dignity of a
man whose body ridiculed dignity with its
five feet two inches, its red nose and weak
legs and with a stutter that made him
savagely determined to prove his superiority
and divine birth even at the cost of his
head, he was a most unhappy creature.
This is, of treason. Philip
Lindsay gives the impression that he has
been energetic in research, but is he not
making too much of the facts he has
unearthed? That suspicion remains. Too
much is made of that red nose. It
cdruscates through the chapter like fire-
works. And perhaps, up to a point, that
is what it is: a fact overemphasised to
shock and astound and make Jacobites’
flesh creep.
More than pyrotechnics, nevertheless,
lies behind the incisive and emphatic
quality of -Philip Lindsay’s portrayals of
historical characters. It is hardly sur-
prising if he sometimes seems to hate or
love has characters to excess,, for they are
portrayed with warmth that they
seem like living people.
Sub-titled “A History,” Hampton
Court in its original intention is designed
simply to bring to life the stones of that
palace for English and overseas visitors:
who built it, who altered and rebuilt it,
who lived in it. But because, from the
time Henry the Eighth took it over from
Cardinal Wolsey until George the Third
made it “a home for private families
given apartments by grace and favor of
the king,” Hampton Court was the play-
ground of English royalty, the book in-
evitably expands into a pageant of the
kings and queens and their associates.
And because Philip Lindsay has the
novelist’s eye for significant defail, for
the quirks and oddities of character, the
pageant expands into a series of dramas
and comedies, intimate, seen from
backstage. . __ t
Henry the Eighth, rushing into Wol-
sey’s palace with his maskers, has
been met before —in a scene from
Shakspeare which Philip Lindsay has
expanded into an opening chapter.
But you would not learn from so discreet
a play as “Henry VIII” that the gentle-
men of the privy chamber maddened the
king with their laziness and gossiping and
that they, in turn, were maddened by
regulations:
That they shall not onely give their
continuall and diligent attendance in the
said chamber, but also leave harkening and
enquiring where the King is, or goeth, be
it early or late; without grudgeing,
mumbling, or talking of the King’s pastime;
late or early going to bed; or anything
done by his grace, as they will avoyde his
displeasure.
We meet in Hampton Court a King
Henry who, watchful, suspicious, uneasy,
commanding every one of his servants to
turn informer on his fellows, is very
different from “the romping, overgrown
boy usually depicted in books or on the
stage” and who, incidentally, Philip Lind-
say believes was free of the disease which
some historians have inflicted on him.
We meet Anne Boleyn in a nightgown
made of black satin and edged with black
velvet and lined with black fur which
cost, even in those days, £lOl 15s. Bd.
We meet Queen Mary not only burn-
ing heretics but, more humanly, speaking
in a voice “rough and loud, almost like
a man’s, so that when she speaks she is
always heard a long way off.” Queen
Elizabeth, flirting with Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester, comes to life on the
tennis-court'of the palqce:—
Once wherl he was playing tennis with
the Duke of Norfolk on the tennis-court
which still stands in our palace grounds,
she ‘washed and, when he grew sweaty, he '
took the kerchief from her hand and wiped
his face as casually as if he were her hus-
band. Whereupon Norfolk, in rage at this
insult to his queen, swore that Dtldley was
saucy and threatened to hit him with his
racket. “Here vpon rose a great treble,”
we are told, “and the queen offendid sore
with the Duke.”
The pageant comes down through the
Stuart period and, if Philip Lindsay
seems to have strayed into the wrong
camp in the days of Charles the First, he
makes amends in his lively and affec-
tionate portrait of Charles the Second
and his richly-colored account of the
women of the Court, based on Lely’s
pictures.
Even when that extremely dull fellow
William the Third comes to Hampton
Court the . book remains human. We
were not told in the school history
books that William was nicknamed
“Mr. Caliban”, by the lady who
afterwards became Queen Anne nor that,
at table, he believed in the divine right
of kings to all the green peas. But Philip
Lindsay quotes the Duchess of Marl-
borough on these refinement! of charac-
ter, and William, if still something of a
boor, becomes instantly alive:
“I give an instance,” she wrote, “of his
worse than vulgar behaviour at his own
table when the Princess dined with him.
It was in the beginning of his reign, and
some weeks before the Princess was put
to bed of the Duke of. Gloucester. There
happened to be just before her a plate of
green peas, the first that had been seen
that year.' The King, without offering the
Princess the least share of them, drew the
plate before him and devoured them all.
Whether he offered any to the Queen 1
cannot say, but he might have done that
safely enough, for he knew she durst not
touch one. The Princess Anne confessed,
when she came home, that she had so much
mind for the peas that she was afraid to
look at them, and yet could hardly keep
her eyes off them.”
Queen Anne’s reign brings Alexander
Pope into the narrative, and, seeing the
poet as a “goblin” in a world bathed
in that luminous dawn, or twilight, ot
a Watteau or Fragonard painting, PhiUp
Lindsay tempts one to re-read “The Rape
of the Lock” with a freshened interest:
a service which offsets some unkindness
to Wordsworth in a later chapter.
The book ends with an examination of
Hampton Court’s ghosts, but to sum it
up, since it is anything but ghostly, it is
better to turn back a few pages to the
times of George the Third where Dr.
Johnson writes to the Lord Chamberlain
asking for rooms in the palace—a request
that was refused —and where, if no Bos-
well can be brought into the picture,
“yet one famous figure does step in his
perfect breeches, his well-creased coat
and semi-starched cravat for a moment
into Hampton Court; for m one of the
apartments here Beau Brummell wooed
and failed to win Julia Storer, daughter
of a maid of honor and the niece of Lord
Carysfort.” That is how the people do
make their entrances in this book, they
“step” in, colorful in their period cos-
tumes, alive beneath them.
The Bushman’s Handbook: H.
Lindsay (Angus and Robertson), itie
author, certified an experienced bushman
by lon Idriess, was a bushcraft instruc-
tor in the Army. He tells how to find
water in unlikely places, how to make
food out of improbable objects, includ-
ing hornets’ nests, how to light a fire with-
out matches, how to make a shelter.
Everybody who proposes to get lost in
the bush should carry Mr. Lindsay m
the knapsack.

Who was Malthus and what was
the doctrine he expounded ?
Thomas Robert Malthus was an
English clergyman whose “Essay on
the Principle of Population” attracted
great attention near the end of the
18th century. He held that population
tends to multiply faster than the
means of subsistence, and that when
this occurs the lower or weaker classes
must suffer from lack of food. There-
fore, unless the increase of popula-
tion is checked by prudential re-
straint, poverty is inevitable; and the
multiplying of the population will be
checked by poverty, vice, or some
other cause of suffering.

Soak the skin in water for 24
hours; then carefully scrape the back
to remove all flesh and fat. Make
up a curing liquor of 4oz. powdered
alum, 2oz. common salt to Igal. of
water and soak the skin for 48 hours.
Wash and again scrape the back.
Make up another liquor minus the
salt, and soak for 24 hours. Then
wash thoroughly and hang to dry
away from the sun and wind. When
the skin is almost dry smear a little
vegetable oil on the flesh side and
then dry right, off.

Why is it the custom now to pre-
cede suchy words as “hotel” and
“historical” and other words com-
mencing with “h” by “an” ?
It isn’t. The use of “an” in place
of “a” is confined to words com-
mencing with a vowel sound. In the
past the “h” in such words as
“historical,” “hotel” and “humble”
was regarded as silent, and “an”
was a permissible precedent, but
nowadays “hour” and “honor” are
about the only words in common
usage in which the aspirate may be
disregarded.
In a Sydney suburban garden I’ve
had poor results from broad beans;
what is the best way to handle them ?
Well dug, heavy soils will give the
best results. If the soil is light or
semi-sandy it should be helped with
plenty of cow manure applied at
least three weeks before sowing seed.
Frequent hilling-up is essential to keep
surface roots covered. Seed can be
sown up to the end of August
(although earlier sowing is preferred),
6in. apart with 3ft. between rows.
Quicker germination will take place
if seeds are soaked in warm watef
for half an hour before sowing, and
in very dry weather keep the drills
well soaked. Lime regularly about
the base to control snails and slugs,
and when flowers show top-dress with
rotted manure or superphosphate.

Most great racehorses are at their
best between 3 and 5 years old
and up to 6 years old for
Sprinters but there are notable
exceptions.
Geldings for example sometimes put
up outstanding performances when
younger or older than the average
such as Amounis, who won the
Caulfield Futurity Stakes as a 7 year
old and the Caulfield Cup as an 8
year old and Mollison, who won
£26,249 in stakes as a 2 and 3 year
old and then faded out.
Ajax, High Caste, Peter Pan, Heroic,
Eurythmic, are four instances of
famous horses who were great as 3
year olds, great as 4 year olds, and
great as 5 year olds.
Unlike racehorses, whisky never
enters its prime until it is over 5
years old. Not until then does it
attain fine bouquet and mellow
flavour. Corio Special is aged for
over five years (more than double
the minimum set by Commonwealth
law).

The Sweetness of Honey
By
Geff
Bingham
NED always whistles Friday morn-
ings, more so Fridays than any
other morning. Watch him today,
pumping water from the well be-
cause the tanks are dry. It will he dry,
too, on the road today, with the big bus,
and’ the dust will fly up about it, from
the Garland’s Point stop, through Wirril
Creek, and into Coolbucca.
But Ned does not care. He whistles,
more for the thought of dust than you
might imagine, and all through his slap-
up wash he whistles until his ears and
nose begin to shine faintly in the early
dawn, until the soap dribbles through into
his mouth and he must cease whistling,
open it and blow, puffing it away, and
the wash is finished, and Ned is into his
good clothes.
Plum sports coat, blue coat-shirt and
grey slacks, and in them, or anything for
that matter, Ned is a great fellow.
When he swings his bus into Garland’s
Point, most of the shopping crowd are
waiting. „
“Hullo, Ned!” Dan Paynter says.
Dan is thinking of big schooners in at
Coolbucca. Ned rarely answers them.
He is busy enough putting on Mrs.
Wright’s stroller for the baby. In at Cool-
bucca you will see Mrs. Wright shopping,
and occasionally she will stop to talk to
a friend, and after a time she will bend,
and touch the mite, whilst the other
woman will observe, knowingly, “Ah, it’s
always a trying day in town for them,
dear,” and young Mrs. Wright will say,
significantly, “The Clinic, you know.
That’s why I always come —the Clinic” ;
and the other one will nod, and say, as
knowingly, “Ah, yes, dearie, the Clinic.”
THERE isn’t, however, only Mrs.
Wright’s stroller. There is a honey-
tin to be filled at Mat’s Honey Farm, on
the way; only sixpence a pound, and
straight from the comb, Mat, with his
white hives standing on the hill for all
to see.
Ned ties the tin so that it will not
bounce on the way. Then he puts the
suitcases —ports they call them, import-
antly—on top of the roof, well tied and
clamped to the slim iron railing about it.
There are all sorts of ports, saggy ones
and baggy ones, all worn, and none new,
but a day would bo needed to spend de-
scribing them. It was just that you al-
ways knew Mrs. So and So by her port,
for after a time they took on some of
the character and characteristics of their
owners. Ned knew them well enough
for the times he had put them up there,
and taken them down again, for that
matter, and yet he thought little about
them.
He doesn’t say “All in” jovially, as you
might expect, for there are notes to,be
made in his book, and petrol to be got
from the bowser. Old Garland serves
Ned well enough if he watches him. Old
Garland, with his white hair and giggles,
seems innocent enough if you were to
go by his pink face, but others have been
caught, going only three miles on a hypo-
thetic five gallons, and that is why Ned
watches old Garland, and why no one
talks to old Garland, although they talk
enough amongst themselves.
“Cattle is still getting bogged,” one
says, and another says “Lost our silver
Jersey that way this week,” and they
really aren’t very sad about these matters.
They seem to relish the farm gossip, even
that which adversity produces. The old
women are quiet enough, with their
patient looks on their faces, looks that sit
back amongst the old wrinkles, quietly,
having been put there with years of resig-
nation and calm acceptance of change
and decay, and new life.
BUT Ned is starting-up the engine,
and the young ones pile in, hoping
all the seats aren’t taken, and Ned looks
at the seat behind him, but by tacit agree-
ment it is not filled, and that makes Ned
glad. He pushes the starter, spurts a
goodly cloud of white smoke from the ex-
haust, huffs it into gear and movement,
and everyone is off, into Coolbucca for
the day, with the best driver on the road,
bar none. Everyone knows Ned’s driving,
how he clears corners easily, and is never
too close to another vehicle, and is never
drunk what’s more, which is what cannot
be said for some drivers.
Ned likes to hear the gears change as
he goes up the hill towards Wirril Creek.
He likes the bloodwoods beside the road,
them with their rearing, their clear trunks,
and then the roof, as you might call it,
over the road, and cooling it. He never
wants to come to the end of this portion
of it, you might think, by the quiet look
on his face, but he does. Oh, yes, even
when he stops for a single staring pas-
senger whose baggy port must go with
the others, he hurries to settle it into
place, jumps to his seat in the trembling
bus, and off he goes with a remarkable
changing of gears.
Now he slows the bus, enough almost
for the engine to die, and the conversa-
tion to be heard.
“Butter coupons! We never used them
until this year. What with the dry
weather, and the cows going off, we just
had to use them.”
“Well, it’s the worst we’ve seen, any
winter or summer, and it’s going to get
worse, my Bill says.”
NED doesn’t hear this. He is looking
at the small shack beside the road,
at the oranges which are shiny-balled
lamps on a green tree, the passions which
spread and tumble over the old railed
fence, and hide their purple knobs. To-
day he can just catch the smell of the
wistaria over the ridiculously small
verandah, but he brushes his slight obser-
vations aside, and looks for better things,
and the conversation, meanwhile, is
partly suspended, dying down to a hazy
hum, a drowsy almost-nothingness.
Most eyes are fixed, if deliberately
casual, upon the small shack cottage, and
well they might be, for just when Ned is
afeared she might never come, there is a
bursting-open pf that dry brown door,
and an emergence of bustling beauty.
She is there, richly rosy in the face, a
scarlet bandana flaunting on her black
hair, and her equally black eyes peering,
then gleaming from beneath both. Her
lips rival the oranges, her green jumper
the leaves of the passion, and her white
skirt only outlines her buxom full lines.
She waves a hand to Ned, to let him
know she is coming, and then she turns
inside for a moment, to kiss Ma, perhaps,
and with a skip and a run she is at the
gate.
She has a port, but only a small one,
just to fit in with that wee cottage. Ned
takes it from her, not knowing whether
to stare down at it, or up at the beauty,
so he does a bit of both.
“Well, Ned,” she says, loud enough for
the bus to hear, so that it might not be
accounted private conversation. “How s
the old thing running today?”
Ned answers “Well enough, Maisie,”
and they both make towards the bus, but
it is easy to see Ned is fairly agitated.
Nevertheless he has that bag up there
in a second, and is back into the bus.
“Whooo-r-r-r! ” goes the engine, and it
is alive and trembling until the whole bus
trembles, quivers, roars louder, and
charges along the road with a merry
changing of gears and a hubbub of talk-
ing, everyone greeting Maisie, and a few
of the boys chiacking gently, but Maisie
is bright and impartial to all, with a
special smile for Mrs. Wright and the
baby, and after that she sits back in the
seat behind Ned.
Ned is happy now. He cares not for
the white whirl of dust, swirling along
the side of his old-woman bus, rippling at
her skirts. He does not see one blood-
wood or one ironbark, or any tree or
bush, for that matter. He drives carefully,
and he is thinking, but not about ports
and the shopping that will be done at
Coolbucca. At Wirril Creek he stops
automatically, and some get out to stretch
their legs, whilst the new travellers laze
up from the post-office where they have
been waiting this half-hour.
“Hullo, Ned!” they all cry heartily,
and Ned nods to them collectively, takes
their bags individually, and enlarges the
pile on the top. Children run up, clutch-
ing envelopes in their hands.
“Dad says he wants a new spring for
the Chev., and to tell the man at the
garage it’s the same side and wheel as
last time, ’cause he knows Dad’s car.”
This is all in one breath, a monotone,
and Ned takes this envelope and that
order, all ports and passengers, and he
roars the bus into life, waiting only a
moment for all to settle, and with a half-
look at Maisie has that great vehicle
lumbering up the street.
They pass the post-office, and it is
lazily askew, its notice “Post Office”
awry as the rest of it. A face peers from
the window, a face whose eyes, it is
alleged, has X-rayed sealed letters these
15 years, and little it is it does not know,
that face, and when Ned passes, and his
bus, it is keen and quick enough to see
the look that Ned has just flashed at
Maisie, and its left eye screws a little so
that it is a wink, slow, lazy and askew as
the building.
Ned collects a kerosene-drum to be
filled with linseed-oil, and 10 sacks to be
taken to Anthony and Sons, grocers, of
Coolbucca, and he has just about all
orders for the trip, so that they are off,
finally, first on to the bitumen, and then
back on to the dust again.
THE clouds roll merrily from the kind
old bus. They rush away into the
trees at the side of the road, and whiten
them, and the bus actually purrs, as
though it were really younger than its
many years, and quite happy to be tak-
ing everyone to Coolbucca for their
weekly shopping.
Ned, over the wheel, is king of a
kingdom, and surely enough everyone
regards him as such. They might have
their companionship with High-ups, or
a good milk cheque at the end of every
month, and even have babies, like Mrs.
Wright, but here Ned is what you might
call the cynosure of all eyes. Even if
their regarding of him is casual it is none-
theless respectful.
“Ned’s got her running, now,” they
say, or “Ned handles the old girl well,”
and strangely enough it is the young men
who always call it the “old girl,” which is
what she really is, of course, an old girl
today with 30 children on her lap, al-
though the notice says distinctly “Licensed
to carry 24 passengers.”
There is another notice, too, “Fares
must be paid on alighting. Have your
money ready.” These two notices con-
firm, in some way, Ned in his kingdom,
but his joy, today, is not because of
kingship, or drivership, but because of
Maisie who is behind him. He could
burst into song, were he not so shy. He
remembers in a moment John Charles
Thomas, and could, himself, set the whole
bus wondering with a rich wild voice
singing “Rolling free as the breeze, what’s
to stop me and why? I can live as I
please. O-pen Ro-ad. O-pen Sk-y!”
Sure enough the road before him is
open, the fields too, sweeping, dry and
brown down to Coolbucca itself. The
sky is open, curved above him, light steel
for a hot day. Then what is to stop him?
How Maisie would like his voice, but
because he cannot really sing like John
Charles Thomas, and because he cannot
sing at all, he grips his wheel, turns the
corners swiftly and carefully, revving to
complete the swinging curve, and all is
well. , „
That is, until the nonchalant fellow
hails him with a lift of an index-
finger. There is only one word, that “non-
chalant,” to describe this young fellow
and his raised finger, and Ned, for all his
independence, has to obey a finger lifted,
and he pulls the bus to a stop, whilst the
young man walks across.
“My car,” he says, “has broken down.
How far is it to the next town?”
“Three to Wirril Creek, back there,”
says Ned. “And ten to Coolbucca
ahead.”
THE young man places a pursing
finger to his lips. His face suddenly
brightens. “Coolbucca, of course,” he
half cries. “I know a Clyde Reynolds
there.”
The bus is silent, hushed. All know
Clyde Reynolds, who is a sort of Mayor
of Coolbucca Shire.
“Hop in,” says Ned, briefly.
The young man hops in. Ned’s plum-
colored sports coat, his blue shirt, his
grey slacks pale away in their beauty be-
fore the splendid blue of the young man’s
double-breaster. Ned has never had a
cool white collar, and a quiet tie, such
as these, nor shoes that seem not to catch
the dust, always remaining black and
polished, smooth and unworn. Maisie
sees all this as the young man seats him-
self beside her, and Ned almost misses
the gear, but not quite. He is a little
unpoised, and even grits his teeth, slightly,
although not enough to be detected.
Ned • thinks a lot as the bus shoots
along. He thinks of Coolbucca being ten
miles off, and how two can become
acquainted in that time, or less. He
looks in the mirror above him, and sees
Maisie conversing with the young man,
although, to be sure, she seemed a bit
cold at first. Ned is undecided as to
whether or not that was a tactical move
on her part. He is fairly depressed as the
miles pass, and plunges, literally plunges,
a foot on to that accelerator, and he does
not notice the speed, or the fact that his
engine is heating. ~, ,
“The old water’s boiling, Ned, shouts
a knowledgeable youth, from the back.
Ned sees that and stops the bus. He
curses a little, which is unusual for Ned.
The knowledgeable youth unseals the
radiator-cap whilst he pours in the water
from a square petrol-can. Then they are
off again, and Maisie has not looked at
him in all that time.

Another “Caterpillar” Diesel Tractor unit with cable

“Caterpillar” units will handle 750,000 cubic yards to
fill in this area.
eLk WENTY-FOUR "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors are speeding the construction
ot the £5,000,000 Kingsford Smith Airport at Mascot, New South Wales,
shifting 9,000,000 yards of material at the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons per week.
Kingsford Smith Airport will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, covering
an area of approximately 2,000 acres, with runways up to 10,000 feet long and 300
feet wide to accommodate the world’s largest air liners.
The diversion of the Cook’s River into Botany Bay, one mile south of its present
outlet, by cutting a channel 600 feet wide by 24 feet deep and miles long,
calls for the moving of 2,500,000 yards of earth. The balance of the 9,000,000
yards of material to be moved will be made up in raising the ’drome level by 9 feet
and filling in the existing river. No less than 6,000,000 yards will come from
the dredging of Botany Bay and 500,000 yards from the nearby sand dunes. The
bulk of this work will be done by "Caterpillar” Diesel D 6, D 7, and D 8 Track-
Type Tractors with cable-controlled Dozers, and No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders.
Operating in loose sand and on swampy ground under the most gruelling
conditions, the "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, with their rugged construction,
tremendous power and easy mobility, give the maximum of sustained traction
power, with the minimum of fuel consumption that makes "Caterpillar” a byword
for economy. Fitted with all-weather seals and filters that shut out the abrasive sand
and protect vital parts, replacements are reduced to the barest minimum.
To maintain the rate of excavation and increase output as the urgency of the job
demands, "Caterpillar” Diesel Traction and Earth-Moving Equipment help speed
still one more national project to a successful conclusion, economically and on time!

CRISIS FOR J. BULL.
As they did long before
Britain’s (and our own) dollar-
shortage troubles were at last ad-
mitted, responsible sources in
America are again rather
gloomily picturing the future of
J. Bull & Co.
“U.S. News and World Re-
port,” basing comment on
current information from Lon-
don and Washington, goes so
far as to declare that “A big
blow-up, maybe national bank-
ruptcy, keeps coming closer to
Great Britain in spite of all that
is done to check it.”
As another typical example of
what can be fairly called friendly
solicitude —it goes without say-
ing that Chicago “Tribune” is
whooping its head off with joy
over its vision of a finished Em-
pire—N. Y. “Times’s” able
London correspondent Herbert
Matthews reports the British
Commonwealth a§ now in “a
period of crisis.”
Practically all American com-
ment has tended to take, on J.
Bull’s behalf, a more serious
view of the South African elec-
tions result than may turn out
to be warranted. Matthews sees
it, in relation to the British
Commonwealth, as betraying
“the already existing weakness
in that remarkable and unique
world organisation.” It came, he
points out, “in the midst of
grave argument over new com-
mitments by the heart of the
Commonwealth, Great Britain,
toward Western - Europe. The
European Recovery Programme
and Foreign Minister Bevin’s
Western Union of Britain,
France and the Benelux coun-
tries are causing a tug-of-war
in which this country [Britain]
is being pulled in opposite direc-
tions.”
In the practically general
American view South Africa is
one more break in an ominous
disintegration; coming “after
shattering post-war blows that
saw India lost to the Empire,
although split into two new Do-
minions of the Commonwealth,
in which they remain only on
trial. Ceylon, too, from a colony
has become a Dominion. Burma
insisted on independence outside
the Empire, although she is still
dependent economically and in
other ways. Links to Egypt have
been weakened almost to the
point of disappearance,” and
“the whole vast colonial empire
in Africa now stands endangered
by the loss of British dominance
in the Middle East and by South
Africa’s threatened defection. In
addition, the native thrust to-
ward national freedom is shak-
ing control not only in Africa
but all the way from the Carib-
bean to Malaya, while the
Chinese hover hungrily around
rich Hong Kong.”
Touching on Britain’s eco-
nomic troubles, the N. Y.
“Times” man reports; “The
sterling area is threatened, and
if it breaks down through
American action or inability to
maintain itself that will be the
end of the British Common-
wealth.”
Looking at this economic
aspect, “U.S. News and World
Report” comments: “The British
cannot earn money fast enough
to pay expenses. Debts are
going unpaid and creditors are
putting on pressure.
“Troubles of a deep-seated
sort continue to pile up for
Great Britain. The net of these
troubles is that Britain, after all
that she has done, is unable as
yet to arrest the trend toward
national bankruptcy. On the
surface, the people are en-
couraged by more food and
clothing, but the country is run-
ning through its bank balances
and using its borrowed funds
just to keep going from day to
day. At the same time big
creditors, including India, are
demanding that the British pay
more on account. Now politi-
Chicago “News."
A LION’S LIFE.
cal developments in South Africa
threaten to pinch off an import-
ant source of gold for the
British. Britain, as a result, is
becoming more and more hard-
pressed financially.
“Aid from the U.S., as things
are going, is not to be enough
to solve Britain’s problems. The
U.S. already has extended one
$3,750,000,000 loan, which is
used up. It has sold
$5,618,000,000-worth of surplus
property to Britain for
$650,000,000. The U.S. has
taken over most of the British
relief burden in Germany. It
has taken over defence costs in
Greece and Turkey. Now the
British are scheduled to receive
around $1,324,000,000 in Mar-
shall Plan aid before the middle
of 1949. Canada, in addi-
tion, has loaned Britain
$1,300,000,000.”
Britain’s deficit for 1948, “if
the present trend continues,” will
amount to over £500,000.000,
“or more than twice what the
Government estimated last
March.” The Marshall Plan aid,
to be spread over a 12-month
period, will be “only enough to
cover British needs for about
eight-and-a-half months at the
present rate of spending.”
On top of that is Britain’s
staggering load of debt: “To the
U.S. Britain owes a total of
$4,575,000,000, which consists of
the British loan of $3,750,000,000
in July, 1946, $650,000,000 lent
at the same time to settle the
British lend-lease account with
the U.S. and about $175,000,000
still to be paid on a loan from
the Reconstruction Finance
Corp. in 1940. To the Empire
countries and others that accept
pound-sterling for goods and
services Britain owes
$13,292,000,000, on the basis of
$4 to the pound.”
Thus “in just a few years
Britain has changed from the
financier and creditor of the
British Empire into its heavy
debtor,” and “full payment of
the sterling debts iS considered
an almost hopeless task.”
Finally, “U.S. News and World
Report” quotes some responsible
experts as' holding that “The
only solution is for Britain’s
creditors to scale-down the debt
by about half and for the U.S.
to pay off the remainder. In re-
turn the U.S. might obtain much
greater access to Empire mar-
kets and investment areas. Such
a solution,” it states, “is to be
talked about increasingly during
the coming months as Britain’s
financial problem, becomes more
and more acute.”
Against all this, the quoted
N. Y. “Times” man points to
the strength still represented by
the British Commonwealth,
which he sees as “in some ways
a world Power equal to the
United States or the Soviet
Union. Its strategic importance,
aside from the fact that the sun
never sets upon it, lies in its
weighing the balance on the side
of the United States and Wes-
tern democracy against the
Soviet Union and its satellites.”
Even so, the London Confer-
ence is seen as taking place “in
circumstances graver than any
since Britain became an imperial
Power in Elizabethan times.”
The main business there, in these
U.S. views, is “to see what can be
done to prevent the dry rot
from spreading.”
As to the “solution” suggested
by “U.S. News and World Re-
port”—smacking of Britain being
a sacrifice to U.S. economic ex-
pansion—the N. Y. “Times”
man answers: “If the United
States, through conditions!
attached to E.R.P., were to try
to break up the sterling area or
in any way force Britain to
choose between the Common-
wealth and Western Europe,
Britain would choose the Com-
monwealth. That goes for de-
fence problems connected with
the Western Union, too. By tlie
Brussels Pact Britain is com-
mitted to closer defence arrange-
ments with Western Europe, but
she intends to accompany them
by strengthening Empire de-
fences at the same time.”
Time Versus Joe.
With a partial system of com-
pulsory service endorsed last
month by Congress—the. Presi-
dent, as nominal Commander-
in-Chief, empowered to call up
all needed to overcome deficien-
cies in volunteering—time is
reckoned to be so much on the
U.S. side in preparing for any
war that may break that if the
Kremlin means to start anything
it must do so soon.
Every month now is held to
be making the U.S. and the
Western European Union more
secure, and hence making peace
also more secure.
Even before the big rearma-
ment and compulsory-service
decisions the U.S, was rated
capable of striking severe, if not
decisive, blows inside the Soviet
Union. But, as Walter Lipp-
mann recently pointed out in
N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” the
U.S. three months ago “had not
mobilised the reserves it [now]
has in its stockpiles, nor taken
the measures to replenish and
enlarge its reserves for a sus-
tained and increasingly severe
assault.” From now on, “month
by month the American striking
force will grow more powerful.”
On the other hand, though
the Soviet Army is- considered
capable of overrunning the near-
by countries of Western Europe
and the Middle East, “the cost
of such an adventure,” in this
view, “is certain, is known, and
is prohibitive.”
The real key to the whole
thing is that the U.S. has the
atom bomb and Russia hasn’t.
The Soviet Army is hence “in-
capable of defending Russian
territory against destructive
attack,” both by atomic and
other bombing, “and it is alto-
gether impotent for a serious
attack against the United States.”
It means that, while war or
peace may be in the balance for
most of this year, peace should
be secure thereafter; and if the
Kremlin does start anything in
the meantime it will take a
thorough hiding.
A Mistaken Man.
Benes, of Czechoslovakia, has
been named, in an article already
quoted here, as the man who
“sold” Roosevelt his belief that
Stalin’s personal word for any-
thing was safe.
It was Roosevelt’s personal
tragedy to be disillusioned about
that in his last weeks, and Benes,
in the general disillusioning
forced on him since then, is even
more a figure for tragedy. It is
pointed by Benes’s view of his
country’s future, expressed in a
few sentences from the last in-
terview N. Y. “Times” corres-
pondent C. L. Sulzberger had
with him before his fall;
“This country [Czecho-
slovakia] cannot live without
the Occident and this must never
be forgotten. Our best trade
connections are and must re-
main with the Western World —
Europe, England and America.
It is impossible for us to exist
only on trading with the East.
In 1938 only 3 per cent, of our
trade was with Russia. Now
under the present circumstances
\i.e., before his country was
bound hand-and-foot as a Soviet
satellite] it may rise to 15 or
even 20 per cent. But even
though 20 per cent, would
represent enormous progress,
that would still leave us 80
per cent. dependent upon
other customers. For this
reason those who think we will
suddenly turn around and re-
verse our situation are nonsen-
sical. In the same way our cul-
ture is Occidental. It is ridi-
culous to think that we would
turn our back upon the West.
This country and its people are
absolutely democratic and we
will remain so, come what may.”
Nothing could have been
more tragically mistaken —for
the time being, at least. As
London “Times” editorially
commented on his fall:
“Tragedy has accompanied Dr.
Benes most of his life. Twice
he has joined in the liberation of
his country; and twice he has
seen it lost to the ideals for
which he and the two Masaryks
stood.” And, completing him
as a ready-made central charac-
ter for a dramatic tragedy: “All
the elements in Dr. Benes’s
policy which had apparently
made for strength and safety—
his reliance on the Soviet Union
and his partnership with the
Communists at home —became
in the last resort a source of
weakness.”
Plays in Pubs.
It seems as far in culture as
in mileage from the trough-swill
of Australian pubs to the regular
play-producing company well-
named “The Taverners,” putting
on plays in pubs in England.
A London “Times” report re-
cords that they have now been
operating for 10 years: “It is
true that they have been exiled
from the bar-parlor during the
war; but the work nevertheless
was not interrupted, and regi-
ments, civil-defence units and
similar gatherings had the bene-
fit of the entertainments previ-
ously offered, and now offered
again, to the frequenters of
licensed premises.”
The “Times” having lately
run a lively correspondence-
discussion on the cutting and
alterations to the text in the
Laurence Olivier film version of
“Hamlet” (for instance, chang-
ing the old word “lets” to its
modern equivalent “hinders,”
and be hanged to metre), the
“Times” critic is able to work

off a nice touch of caustic:
“The Taverners proceed, it
would appear, upon an opposite
principle to that of the film pro-
ducers who think it necessary to
revise the text of Shakspeare
because, in an age of universal
lawn tennis, an audience of mil-
lions cannot be expected to guess
the meaning of a ‘let.’ They
think that if any poetic English
is unfamiliar to the man at the
bar, it is only necessary to give
him a chance to hear it and he
will soon get the hang of it.
Possibly a pot of ale at the elbow
provides just that stimulus to
intelligence that the plush and
darkness of the cinema deny;
however it is, the proved popu-
larity of the company shows
that the method works.”
The World’s Food.
“The promise of excellent
harvests in Europe and North
America,” London “Times” edi-
torially comments, “gives some
hope that world food scarcity
may be a little eased as this year
ends.”
It adds that “Grain supplies
next year may reach or even be
above what they were before the
war; and in some countries,
such as France and Italy, where
bad weather had a disastrous
effect last year, the recovery may
be dramatic.”
That, however, won’t catch up
with world population, which
has increased by 10 per cent,
during the period of general
shortage. To give one example
quoted by the “Times”: India’s
addition is 4,000,000 every year.
Support For De Gaulle.
London “Times’s” Paris cor-
respondent and the “Times” it-
self have scarcely been over-
sympathetic to De Gaulle ; hence
a special significance in recent
comment by the correspondent
in a featured article headed “De
Gaulle’s Challenge”; “General
de Gaulle’s movement, founded
a little more than a year ago
as an all-party rally for patriotic
Frenchmen, has had extraordi-
nary success. Without a daily
party newspaper, with limited
funds, and without direct repre-
sentation in Parliament (for
although there is a Gaullist
group in the Chamber, it is not
an organised and unified party),
the movement has today more
support than any other political
grouping in the country,”
In the “Timesl” man’s still
somewhat chilly view “the
General’s programme, at least to
British minds, is arid enough.”
Still, he admits there is strong
French support for the De
Gaulle aims of revising the Con-
stitution and reforming the
electoral law. Above all, he
adds, the General’s programme
“represents to the ordinary
Frenchman the final and inevit-
able resort should Communist
tactics turn to violence. If the
French Communist leaders re-
ceive orders to bring about civil
war, or if an international war
breaks out, then there is little
doubt that most Frenchmen
would turn, in many cases thank-
fully, to General de Gaulle as
the defender of their lives and
liberties.”
In this view the prospects of
the General’s taking control de-
pend on what happens on the
Com. front between now and
the French elections in October.
Meanwhile, the prevalent belief
is that “the Communist stock
is slowly but significantly sink-
ing.” The correspondent con-
cludes: “It is hard to imagine
the Communists in the Gov-
ernment again. In spite of
great support in the country,
their own performance here [in
France] and that of their col-
leagues abroad have sent them
into a political exile to which
there is no visible end.”
BOUQUETS FOR J.B.
In the midst of the almost in-
credible mass of hate-Britain
propaganda published and
broadcast in recent months in
America on the Palestine mess
—much of the outburst sound-
ing like the erupting of a bad
conscience—there was at least
one American voice raised on
John Bull’s behalf: Kermit
Roosevelt, with a counterblast
in N. Y. “Times” to a Dr. Alvin
Johnson’s communication hoe-
ing into Bull.
“Why,” Kermit Roosevelt
wrote, “does Dr. Johnson not
mention that American dollars
paid for the weapons with which
the Irgun invaded the Arab city
of Jaffa even before the mandate
ended, or for the bombs with
which were booby-trapped the
bodies of the British sergeants
kidnapped and garroted by the
Irgun last summer?
“Dr. Johnson does not ap-
prove of imperialism. Neither
do the Arabs. Who is the im-
perialist in Palestine? The
Arab, who has lived there for
centuries? Or the Zionist com-
ing there from another continent
to establish, by forced immigra-
tion and by arms, his political
domination over the land of
another?
“To claim that ‘we bailed
Britain out in two world wars’
is to assume that we had no
stake ourselves in either. Who
bailed out whom in the period
between the fall of France and
Pearl Harbor?
“The writer calls Britain ‘a
nation up to its neck in the
blood of a republic.’ That is an
easy flight of oratory. It was
harder to do, as the British did,
the dull day-to-day work which
alone made possible the exist-
ence of the so-called republic of
Israel. Bitterness and fighting
over that State threaten the con-
tinued existence of the Jewish
national home which Britain
promised and labored to pro-
vide.
“What other people [except
the British] would have en-
dured the murder of their sons
and the vicious slander of their
motives by Zionists without a
widespread increase in violent
anti-Semitism? A British rabbi
recently admitted; ‘There is
more anti-Jewish prejudice in
England now than ever before.
Much of the increase can clearly
be traced to the trouble in
Palestine and the attacks on
Britain by political Zionists in
other lands.’ If the United
States were subjected to similar
provocation can we be confident
that an American rabbi would
be able to report simply ‘more
anti-Jewish prejudice’ in the
U.S.?
“I find the people I talk to,
in the West, the Middle West
and even the East, Jews as well
as others, profoundly disturbed
by the blatant way in which
partisan domestic politics have
directed our [U.S.] Palestine
policy. Many who are sincerely
concerned with the improvement
of inter-faith relations feel those
relations have suffered their most
severe setback in years by the
open exercise of, and surrender
to, Zionist pressure. They pray
that the worst may not be yet
to come.”
Replaced Persons.
Up to now the 11,000,000 dis-
placed persons in Europe at the
end of the war have been cut
down —mostly repatriated— to
about 850,000.
These can’t be repatriated, pre-
ferring almost anywhere to the
countries they came from, but
they may now be steadily dis-
posed of. A Palestine settlement
could see most of the Jews
among them looked after, and
the U.S., ending much backing
Washington “Post
“SAVE THE HOLY PLACES !”
and filling, is to take 200,000
(mainly Balts “with an agricul-
tural background”) in the next
two years.
Meanwhile Britain has been
taking a surprising number—
according to figures quoted by
George E, Sokolsky in N. Y.
“Sun,” 325,000 already “and
continuing to admit them appa-
rently at the rate of 40,000 a
year.”
Sokolsky also states that
Britain has solved the problem
of preventing such immigrants
settling into minority-community
groups. This, by mixing them
“without regard to origin, by
employing them not in groups
but as individuals.” Their em-
ployment is “so organised that
the English language becomes
the common tongue among
them, as it is the language of
their environment. In fact, it is
so arranged that they speak only
in English, and even before em-
ployment they are taught the
speech of their new country.”
That “Showdown.”
To dispel finally the confu-
sion created by the Kremlin, for
propaganda purposes, choosing
to “accept,” a little time back,
the very blunt U.S. “showdown”
Note as an “invitation” to talks
on differences, David Lawrence,
as editor of “U.S. News and
World Report,” gives the official
American Government version
of the Note :
“It was a warning. It was
a move to prevent any inci-
dent from being provoked at
Berlin, Vienna, Korea or else-
where that could lead to sudden
war. It was a means of making
clear to Russia in implicit words
that in the United States, poli-
tical campaign or no, the
American people stand together
and their forces will not be
driven out of Berlin, Vienna or
Korea by pressure or provoca-
tion no matter who is elected
President in November.
“But when such a clear state-
ment, written in the most
cautious way, was viewed by it-
self, the fear arose inside the
American Government that it
might be misconstrued by the
Russians as possessing a sort of
cockiness of spint or even as
belligerency. The decision was
made, therefore, to put at the
end of the Note a paragraph
concerning the possibility of dis-
cussions. The United States in
other words, said the door for
discussion was wide open,” But
the sense in which it was wide
open was tor “an honorable re-
treat or revision of policy by
Russia.”

Soviet Germans. What sort of
guesswork goes on about practically
everything beyond the “iron curtain”
is indicated by the guesses at the size
of the so-called Soviet “German
army.” The guesses, states N. Y.
“Times” military writer Hanson W.
Baldwin, range from 18 divisions
totalling about 350,000 men down to
18 battalions, or as few as 20,000 men.
“Some experts,” Baldwin adds, “give
more credence to the lower than to
the higher figure and believe that, so
far at least, these troops are being
used primarily as labor battalions.”
* * * *
Pronunciation of Israelis. —Citizens
of Israel, when they get the place
going, are to be called Israelis, and
on how to pronounce that word the
dictionary expert Dr. Wilfred Funk
has plunked for “Iz-ri-uhl-is,” with
the accent on the “Iz” and all the
vowels short. Rabbi Isidor Hoffman,
attached to Columbia University, goes
for “Iz-ray-el-ees,” with the accent
on the “ees,” which, he says, is how
the word would be pronounced in
Hebrew.
* * * *
Sackings Pending. —One thing that
helps enormously to put sting into
American Presidential electioneering
is the vast number of people depend-
ing on the result either to hold or to
get jobs. So if the dire predictions
against Truman are right there’ll be
a whale of a lot of sackings of
people on the public payrolls, N. Y.
“Daily News” reporting the President
as “loading the Government up with
such people at the rate of 500 a day
when last we heard, for election pur-
poses.”
* * * *
Immigrants for Israel. —There’ll still
be plenty of headaches in Israel even
if it’s all settled as an established
State or nation, one of the first being
accommodating further population. A
correspondent of N. Y. “Times” re-
ports: “It is known that even Israel
leaders are worried about Israel’s
ability to absorb rapidly a large num-
ber of immigrants. They abhor the
possibility that, after spending years
in Fascist concentration camps and
Allied displaced-persons’ camps, they
might again have to enter camps in
the Promised Land.”
* * ♦ ♦
Compulsory Armies. —“U. S. News
and World Report” finds that of the
world’s 54 countries that keep up
military establishments, 48 use some
form of compulsory service. The
U.S. will make the total 49 if the
President uses the recently-conferred
power to fill volunteering deficiencies
by compulsory call-up.
* * * *
Trade With Franco. —It looks as
if nations, as much as individuals,
can be prime snobs. Thus, while
Spain is a political leper to them,
virtually all of the 16 nations in the
Marshall Plan (a “Journal-American”
article states) actually have mutually
beneficial trade relations with Franco.
J. Bull, for instance, is not above
eating some £2,500,000-worth of
Franco oranges.
* * * *
Palestine Peace Troops. —The real
test of U.S. sincerity on Palestine
would come with a call for troops
to keep the peace there. The sym-
pathetic N. Y. “Times’s” chief Euro-
pean correspondent, C. L. Sulzberger,
quotes “a high British officer and a
United States diplomat from the
Middle East” as both telling him
they believed “five divisions of troops
would be necessary to keep the
peace.” The snag in that is that the
country providing such a force would
have to be put on a war footing at
home, and the American “No!” to
that would make the Australian
referendum “No” sound like a twitter.
* * * *
U.S. Free Enterprise. —A London
“Times” special correspondent sees
the main fear of Americans as “the
fear of a threat to the American way
of life,” which “means first and
foremost free enterprise and the capi-
talist system, where the fundamental
liberty is the liberty to rise in the
world by one’s own exertions and
where equality means equality at the
starting-point but' no nonsense about
equality between winners and losers
once the race is on. An advertise-
ment displayed outside many Ameri-
can churches invites people to come
to church on the ground that ‘re-
ligion has always stood for progress.’
The identity of progress and free
enterprise is an axiom for every
American.”

SOCIALISTS' NEMESIS.
If Mr. Chifley—now in London comport-
ing himself like a rich uncle with wads
of sterling—is preparing to follow Pro-
fessor Copland’s recent, dollar-borrowing
advice, does he seriously think that, in
order to meet export deficiencies, he can
buy into the approved dollar-borrowing
fraternity without incurring any obliga-
tions to abolish, for instance, the loafing
in handling of cargoes in Australian ports
and on the coalfields —loafing which is
imperilling the shifting of the Queens-
land sugar crop, holding up transport of
wheat from the interior and decreasing
the value of every pound we want to con-
vert into dollars?
Maybe any such external results will be
slower in appearing than the effect of the
coal shortage and the strangling of the
shipping and other transport services
upon Australian industries and house-
holds. In at least three States public
revolt is rising against regulations
—probably unenforceable at law and
certainly provocative beyond all bear-
ing—making * criminal the use of coal,
gas and electric power in excess 1 of cer-
tain amounts or beyond certain periods—
regulations which are an insult to users
who must pay increasingly for fuel and
light under Government control whether
the services function or not.
“The honeymoon is over,” said Mr.
Chifley a few months ago to the Mac-
quarie district A.L.P. A few weeks later
he told some more “Labor” supporters'
at Lithgow that the decline in produc-
tion, if not cured, would bring Australia
to “economic disaster.” Every State
dependent on N.S.W. coal is now rationed
with essential fuel, which must
gradually cause a falling-off in industrial
employment quite irreconcilable with any
prospect of stimulating Australian in-
dustry by migration from overseas.
New industries, waiting impatiently to
come here, according to Canberra, can-
not function, it seems, unless they
organise their own coal supplies from
abroad also.
The dislocation, industrial and social,
of which our present sufferings are only
the beginning, is the direct result of:
Deliberate and malicious Communist
sabotage, unchecked by the Chifley Gov-
ernment, in the coal,' waterside and ship-
ping industries, sabotage pursued with the
object of producing social anarchy, and
encouraged by Canberra’s policy of
appeasing militant unions.
The gross failure of the 40-hour week
to substantiate any of the promises made
for it —even contentment in the workers
supposed to benefit from it.
The deterioration of Government ad-
ministration, intruded into the industrial
sphere, through its inability or unwilling-
ness to cope with widespread indiscipline
and defiance of authority by certain unions.
The serious inflation of costs and prices,
which, as Melbourne employers say, are
now “going up in a lift,” while wages,
chasing them, are merely “walking up-
stairs.”
While, according to one of. the new
Conciliation Commissioners, no adult
male anywhere in Australia is working
for pay so low as the basic wage, the way
in which the basic wage has recently been
“walking upstairs,” chasing cost of com-
modities in the lift, can be seen from this
story of the average basic wage in the six
capital cities, and the rises are now com-
ing bigger and faster:, —

From 1941 child endowment for all chil-
dren after the first under 16 was ss. a
week, and since 1945 7s. 6d.
This trend is a reflection of the in-
flation gaining ground throughout Aus-
tralian economy. Restriction of industrial
activity under the drastic fuel rationing
can only increase this tendency with com-
pounding effect, as it develops, upon un-
employment and the decreasing value of
money. Now, brazenly the A.C.T.U. is
pressing for a 245. increase in the basic
wage. There may herein be described,
perhaps, one reason why Mr. Chifley
hastened to throw responsibility for price-
control —after the referendum defeat —
upon the States. It was becoming un-
manageable anyway.
One of the leading inter-State shipping
companies has described his industry as
“hove-to in a fog.” Increased freight
rates, serious enough, are not meeting the
loss caused by the drag on activity im-
posed by the 40-hour week, strikes, limi-
tation of working loads and the blocking
of ports by ships which virtually cuts the
merchant fleet by half. “More ships,”
Ministers cry. But, says “Jobson’s Invest-
ment Digest,” more ships are not the
answer:
Indeed, more ships would put an in-
creased strain on port resources and result
in more delay. The waterfront bottleneck
is due to the deliberately slow rate of
work by waterside laborers.
“No nation,” it declares, “can afford to
operate a slow and inefficient transport
system in competition with the rest of the
world, particularly Australia in view of
her lengthy trade-routes.”
While the “gutless wonders” of Can-
berra try to disguise the truth that their
whole post-war planning programme for
socialisation and central control is falling
in a heap, economists on both sides of the
world are rising to attack it. In Mel-
bourne Professor Copland told the Vic-
torian Economic Society at the end of
June that “full employment” was, in
effect, a misnomer and a fraud, being
rather'“employment far below industrial
capacity,” and that:
The very high level of export incomes
has been allowed to spill over into the
economy, creating monetary pressures of
really colossal proportions... .With the
abandonment of price-control by the Com-
monwealth and the cessation of a number
of subsidies [the disguises of the malady]
there is little doubt that a considerable
rise in retail prices will take place in the
next year and a half. Thus the policy
adopted by the Australian Government has
not either checked inflationary pressure or
resulted in an expansion of production suf-
ficient to meet the accumulated demand.
That goes part of the way. Much
more emphatic are leading English
economists, successors to- the mantle of
Lord Keynes—Prof. D. H. Robertson
(Political Economy, Cambridge), Prof.
Lionel Robbins (Economics, University of
London), R. H. Harrod (lecturer
Economics, Oxford), and Prof. John
Jewkes (Economics, University of Man-
chester) —whose unanimous denunciation
of British Socialist post-war planning has
been republished by the Victorian Insti-
tute of Public Affairs. The call for the
“social security” they endorse, and they
admit the increased scope for Govern-
ment responsibility thereby entailed. But
Government planning of the current
Socialist pattern, concerning itself not
merely with the total level of industrial
activity, but with the kind and quality of
things produced, with “targets,” with
national and social priorities, and detailed
control of investment, prices and finance
—this they declare anathema; it puts
initiative in a straitjacket, and it must fail
through sheer administrative inability to
direct such a system successfully.
The fatal flaw, these economists hold,
in total planning lies in concentration of
power and decision in a few hands.
A mistake by central planning com-
mittees can thus have catastrophic con-
sequences for the whole economy. A single
miscalculation, an error of commission or
of foresight, a failure to reach the antici-
pated “target” in a basic item —coal or
steel throws all “programmes” out of
gear. Private business has its own way
of meeting these crises. But Governments,
as experience shows, will until the last
moment keep hoping against hope for a
turn in the tide rather than take the arduous
or unpopular course. There are, after all,
no direct penalties for failure by Govern-
ment officials.
It is inconceivable that any democratic
system can operate effectively unless the
great mass of economic decisions are left
to individual consumers and producers act-
ing within the price framework.
Harrod pleads for the reintroduction of
the “beautiful mechanism” of the free price
market as soon as'possible. It “has the
power of stripping away all padding, of
distinguishing the more urgent requirements
from the less urgent, the immediately
necessary from the postponable.”
It is nearly 10 years now since prices
in this country (as in Britain) were free
to move of their own accord in response
to competition and demaiid. The free
price market carries out exactly what the
Government planners are attempting to
do, but infinitely more efficiently, more
delicately, more accurately. These
economists ask: “Does anyone seriously
think that any self-respecting people with
a spark of independence are for long,
under conditions of peace, prepared to
acquiesce in handing over their
sovereignty of choice to a few Govern-
ment officials?”
These economists are entirely in accord
with those opponents of Socialist plan-
ning in Australia who have insisted that
freedom from controls and rationing can
come only through freedom of individual
enterprise to increase production, and
that, if the Government is sincere in its
professed aims, this is the course it must
follow.
There is no evidence that the Chifley
Government has any intention of doing
so —of abating its iniquitous taxation,
reducing its own wasteful expenditure, or
insisting on discipline in the unions to
which it allows every licence to lay waste
industrial effort. Unquestionably the
community will, as a result, suffer miser-
ably. The prospects of its eventual re-
covery depend on its understanding
clearly why it is suffering.
Promise and Performance.
Affecting a confidence he cannot feel,
and resisting the temptation to say “Now
is the time for all good mugs to come to
the aid of the party,” the “Labor” can-
didate for Kogarah, a Mr. Oxford, spoke
in this strain last week:
We have been agreeably surprised that
the women in the electorate have not been
influenced against “Labor” by gas and
power cuts.
A fatuous statement to make, even if
Mr. Oxblood believed it. Fatuous, be-
cause in the face of such recent warn-
ings as the loss of the Coogee seat, 1 the
smashing defeat of the prices-and-charges
racket (in Kogarah, as in other places)
and the widespread defiance (also in
Kogarah, as in other places) of the com-
pulsory-voting law inflicted on muni-
cipal electors, the party cannot afford,
even in appearance, to entertain the fancy
that people who voted for it in the past
will stand anything from it always. But
the thing should read “We shall be agree-
ably surprised if the women in the elec-
torate have not been influenced against
‘Labor’ by gas and power cuts.”
There are more women than men in
Kogarah, and indeed in all residential
suburbs. The referendum vote in the
Kogarah subdivision of Barton, Dr.
Evatt’s constituency (Hurstville, which re-
turns his Russia-mad brother, is another
part of it), was 4588 for “Labor” and
5842 against. There had during the
previous week been a gasmen’s strike
against an award delivered by one of Dr.
Evatt’s conciliation commissioners, and
in Kogarah and elsewhere many women
who had to boil water and cook meals
with paper and bits of wood in back-
yards, exposed to bitter blasts, caught
colds and ’flu. Indignation at the effects
of this union ' larrikinism, of which no
warning had been given, and at the threat
of a repetition, published in a report of
Arbitration Court proceedings the day be-
fore the polling-day, must have “in-
fluenced” the vote.
The “gas and power cuts” to which
Mr. Oxford referred so blithely are
“Labor’s” winter gifts to the people and,
by official reckoning and Oxblood rea-
soning, will still be in operation, without
shaking the loyalty of the feminine heart
that beats for “Labor,” when the
Kogarah women go to the poll again.
For they and their sisters in other
“Labor” electorates don’t really mind
these deprivations when weighed against
the advantages —such as pensions for
Assemblymen, thumping increases in
their pay, more and bigger lott’ries and
the general advancement of the Booze
and Betting interests —that “Labor” has
brought them.
True, these ladies can’t be said to like
being restricted to gas for meals only and
to “two lights,” especially where there
are stairs or a houseful of children ; nor,
with wood, coal and coke unprocurable,
do they relish having to do without gas-
fires and radiators and to see their old
people cold and miserable, and perhaps
doomed to shiver their lives away or die
in their sleep, as did four poor old crea-
tures when the gas spurted from left-on
jets after the May strike. Neither
do they rejoice at being obliged to walk
or stay home and freeze because they
can’t ride, or to consider the possibility,
probability or certainty that their bread-
winner will be thrown out of work be-
cause fuel has given out or because
essential materials can’t be got from hard-
hit Victoria or South Australia. But they
take these things with resignation, their
faith in “Labor” undiminished, rather
than embarrass the struggling McGirrs
and Evatts and the miners and wharf-
laborers and gasmen —obedient servants
of those Communists to whom Mr. Mc-
Girr and Mr. Chifley never say an un-
kind word, and whose Moscow lords the
younger Evatt extols —much less vex
these worthies with complaints. Or so
Mr. Oxford professes to think.
Mr. Oxblood didn’t mention the men
of Kogarah. Perhaps he doesn’t expect
the men to be as complaisant when mark-
ing their ballot-papers as he says he ex-
pects the women to be.
Those of the men who are returned
soldiers can scarcely be in the mood to
take out their Digger hats and throw
them aloft when they reflect that N.S.W.
“Labor’s” sole remembered contribution
to the war effort was the Act setting up
the Sydney Turf Club, a body with such
powers and “Labor”-supported ambi-
tions that it straightway entered upon
a vast resumption and building pro-
gramme, being supplied with bricks
from the State brickworks and no
dashed nonsense about common de-
cency or even printed • regulations.
Nor can these servicemen feel ex-
uberant when they recall “Labor’s” soli-
tary contribution to recovery, the
measure conferring pensions (and con-
tinued to widows) on retired or defeated
Assemblymen, two-thirds of the expectant
beneficiaries being “Labor” and none
with any record of combat service against
Hitler or Hirohito —pensions more
liberal, even in the cases of two-Parlia-
ments men, than those doled out to war-
wrecked servicemen and war widows.
Neither can the Kogarah men be.
moved to delight when they compare
“Labor’s” treatment of the houseless, and
of those pigging it in sheds, garages or
rooms (“with use of kitchen,” that
hateful thing to women) with its sell-out
to the Booze interest embodied in the
Liquor “Reform” Act. Promised for
years, and expected by the innocent to
strike at tied houses, the unsavory enact-
ment gave legislative sanction to the
breweries’ vast' vested interest in the
retail side of the Trade and set no limits
to extensions. On the contrary, it pro-
vided for extensions by taking away from
people who for half a century have re-
fused to have drink-dens in their neigh-
borhoods their prescriptive right of local
option. In the result there has been an
outbreak of applications for transfers of
licences, increasingly granted, from seedy
over-pubbed places to places with few
pubs or with publess traditions and proud
of them. Every applicant has his own
“building programme” and doesn’t care
how many people transfer of licence and
“programme” doom to join in the heart-
breaking search for decent accommoda-
tion.
A fortunate incarnation of the Booze
and Betting interests under a fancy hat is
Azzalin Orlando Romano, formerly
Romano Orlando Azzalin, who made
money hand over fist during the war,
though towards the end the American
Army authorities cramped his style a bit.
Romano figures in the telephone-book
as proprietor of a Sydney restaurant —the
one on which the Americans belatedly
frowned —and a farm (“Alicia”) at Baulk-
ham Hills, and, according to the press that
calls him “Rom,” he recently paid £16,000
or £17,000 for a mansion. Also he bought
a pub at Wagga, part of which —the pub,
not Wagga—had been “destroyed by a
fire.”
This was stated by a man from “the
Department of Building Materials” (a
“Labor” creation, separate Minister and
all) when Romano, together with an
architect and a builder, was “charged with
having committed breaches of the Build-
ing Controls Act.” In pursuance of the
favors extended to the Booze and Betting
interests, Romano was authorised to
spend £25,000 on “alterations” and took
leave to spend £50,000. None of the
parties prosecuted appeared. Builder and
architect were fined £25, Romano £5O.
Fifty pounds for an outrage like that,
when many of the men who saved the
Romano hide remain in desperate need of
house-room! And it is not as if this
naturalised Italian were a new hand at
driving a flash car through Australian
law. During the second war with Ger-
many, charged as Romano Orlando Azza-
lin, he was fined £5OO, plus penal tax, for
having “knowingly and wilfully under-
stated his income” for 1935^36 —he re-
turned it at £1998, when it was actually
£11,959.
In his “policy” speech, read 15 months
ago, Mr. McGirr made these promises,
among a multitude of others:
“Ninety thousand modern homes in the
next three years.”
Increase of the standard of living and
reduction of the cost.
“Assistance in the home for mothers and
housewives.”
No more Bunnerong blackouts: “The
Government does not intend to tolerate
them any longer.”
Prosecution “with the utmost rigor” of
any Communist or Liberal who “breaks
the law.”
“Resolute dealing” with stoppages in
industry they will be “most rare.”
“Immediate action to improve and ex-
tend the whole of our transport services.
Safer and speedier transport with the
highest degree of seating comfort....
New noiseless trams. A thousand new
buses on the roads in the quickest possible
time. Speedier trains and fnore of them.
Stepping-up of the construction of
trucks.”
“Increase of coal production by 3,500,000
tons per annum.”
“Elimination of all delays in the settle-
ment of ex-servicemen on the land.”
All these promises, and many more, have
gone down the wind. The N.S.W. soldier-
settlement position, after six years of
“Labor” gassing at Sydney and Canberra,
was curtly summarised by the State
Auditor-General: over 12,000 qualifica-
tion certificates issued; titles issued to
117 settlers ; 37 others in occupation with-
out titles. Of the 90,000 dream homes,
the McGirr Minister of Building Materials
claimed to have found 14,414 at the end
of 14 months; the Water Board could
find only 12,173, of which 1369 were in
Bankstown, the McGirr electorate;
Kogarah, apparently, was “not in the
race.” As for “resolute dealing” with
“stoppages” and prosecutions (“with the
utmost rigor”) of Communist lawbreakers
—the rest of the fustian writes its own
condemnation —it is not in “Labor’s”
nature to be resolute with workstoppers
or rigorous with Reds. “Labor” is scared
of all the gang—scared stiff.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Labor" and Recruiting.
If the Citizen Training Scheme (to which
hundreds of volunteer officers are de-
voting their time and enthusiasm, though,
many of them are fresh home from five
or six years’ war service) does not fail
completely it will not be the fault of
the Australian “Labor” party, the Federal
Government and particularly the Sydney
McGirr Government.
A campaign is being openly waged in
some unions and in such bodies as the
Communist-influenced Canberra Trades
and Labor Council against enlistment
in the new force. In New South
Wales the Railway Department and
the Road Transport Department have
forbidden their employees to enlist,
and though this has been public for
some time, there has been no comment
from Mr. McGirr or even from Mr.
Heffron, who elected to be Civil Defence
Minister during World War 11. Neither
have Ministers at Canberra expressed the
views which they should have expressed
either on the behavior of sections of
their own party or on Mr. McGhr’s sullen
transport bodies, which at present can
scarcely transport a cupful of cold water
—last Sunday they had no trams and only
a handful of trains and buses running.
Mr, Chambers, indeed, when he opened
the recruiting campaign, sounded as if
he were reading in his sleep, and without
his teeth, a script which he had never
seen before, about a subject which
he had been induced to dignify with his
approval by some taskmaster standing
over him with a castor-oil bottle. And
if any youngster was moved with an urge
to enlist after hearing the sorry effort it
must have been generated from his own
steam and not from Mr. Chambers’s,
since the latter produced none.
General Blarney’s remark that the
attitude of the New South Wales Gov-
ernment shows a “great lack of sense of
national responsibility” is an understate-
ment. It is actually a direct incitement,
whatever the intention behind it, to men
not employed in Government depart-
ments to shirk their duty.
The State Government has no responsi-
bility for deciding how the country shall
be defended and who shall or shall not
serve. That is the Commonwealth’s func-
tion under the Constitution, and State
Governments, as much as private firms,
are subject to Commonwealth law as it
affects defence. That law prescribes that
no employer shall refuse an employee
leave for training purposes.
If, therefore, Mr. McGirr’s Govern-
ment insists on continuing its present atti-
tude, the Commonwealth Government
should enforce the law and prosecute the
appropriate New South Wales Ministers
and their Mr. Hartigan.
If it does not, or even fails to ask for
a salutary penalty, it will never again be
able equitably to demand the punishment
of any private person or concern obstruct-
ing voluntary enlistment.
With Coal from Durban?
With acknowledgments to the singer of
“With Coal to Callao”;
The chairman of the Joint Coal Board, “with
the concurrence of my colleagues,” and pre-
sumably the assistance of their “public relations
officer” and one or more of their “35 typists,”
has had a stab at explaining why the “policy”
of “giving the everything they ask
for,” with free clubs, concerts, art galleries,
swimming-pools and football togs on the latest
programme, has failed to deliver the goods.
The gentleman, who gets £5OOO a year (“my
colleagues” draw £2500 a year apiece), can
find “no single reason for the chronic shortage
and the immediate critical shortage,” with its
deadly consequences in three States and the
recurrent threats of £5OO. fines to rebellious
housewives, hut he allows that “production
did not increase as and when expected.” He
claims that “the board and the responsible
Commonwealth and State Ministers” (all, of
course, “Labor”) “took all possible steps to
impress the seriousness of the position upon
the Miners’ Federation,” but “production did
not improve.” Naturally; the “all possible
steps” fell short of threatening Communist-
controlled workstoppers, absentees and go-slow
artists with even one per cent, of the punish-
ment thought out for wives brought to the
verge of breakdown and old people shivering
in an icy winter and in danger of dying
miserably for lack of warmth.
Poor stuff, this Coal Board bulletin. Tolerable
only because it was so ladylike that any of the
35 typists might have dashed it off, and be-
cause it was devoid of the cheap and nasty
bluster to which Fuel Minister Ashley and
Premier McGirr have descended in the fallacious
hope of masking their feebleness. Mr. Ashley,
who knows a great deal more about the racing
game than he knows about any of the matters
on which he blithers as Minister, has not fol-
lowed up his baseless assertion that “the num-
ber of men engaged in the N.S.W. coalmining
industry declined from 24,494 last year to
17,600 this year.” Mr. McGirr, unable to sub-
stantiate his claim that output in 1947 was over
two million tons more than output in the best
U.A.P. year, has produced another set of
figures in self-deluded support of his contention
that the miners are “doing very wonderful
work.” One extract: —
Output in 1940 totalled 9,619,000 tons,
whereas output in 1947 was 11,685,000
tons.
Nothing about the increase in mechanisation
or the swelling of 1947 production, such as it
was, by two factors inoperable in 1940, open-
cut mining and Saturday work, surface and
underground, at double pay. Nothing about the
10 weeks’ strike in 1940, a vile Communist strike
against “the imperialist war.” Nor any quo-
tation from “The Australian Coal Industry,”
a standard work written by two Melbourne
University lecturers, who have set it on record that
during the years 1940-45, inclusive, “there were
nearly 11 times as many working days lost in
N. S. Wales per ton of coal raised as there were
in Britain.” They mentioned also that during the
1940 crime “Mr. Menzies visited the coalfields
and addressed the men, an example which his
successor found himself unable to follow.”
So has Mr. Chifley and so has Mr. McGirr.
It looks as if the Victorian Government
and the Sydney County Council too will be
driven to importing South African coal “at
£5 or £6 a ton,” whether the Board and the
“responsible” Ministers like it or lump it. This
will be a foul disgrace to “Labor” and the
Communist-bossed Miners’ Federation.
Compared with richly-endowed N. S. Wales
the South African coal measures are small,
and the quality poor. And “all the mines are
in the interior, none being near the coast”
(in N. S. Wales they are pretty well all near the
coast), and the miners are 95 per cent, colored
(South African Year-Book). Yet, whereas
N.S.W. output (gross) was only a trifle more
last year, with open-cut mining, mechanisation
and “back-Saturday” shifts, than it was in 1924
(11,618,200 tons) and 1925 (11,396,100 tons),
the average for seven years, 1921-27, being just
on 11,000,000 tons (N.S.W. Official Year-Book),
South African production went from 11,710,000
tons in 1934 to 22,740,000 tons in 1945, and
there has been a steady annual increase since.
It will be dreadful to have to admit that the
Kaffir is a better and more faithful coalminer
than the lordly Australian, but so it will be
written down if South African offers of coal
are accepted, as Indian tiles have been and
Asian cement may be. And it will make
pestilent nonsense of the McGirr boast that
“by careful planning, intelligent co-ordination
and sincere effort” his crowd “has so improved
the economic position that progress is actually
racing ahead of itself.”
A Century After Leigh Hunt.
“Now, the moment people wake in the
morning,” they wonder whether the gas
is on or not, and housewives flutter
anxiously to the kitchen with their minds
in torment about the breakfast and mur-
mur unladylike words at the faint plop
and hiss from the jet.
“Now, we hate getting up and hate
shaving,” and shudder because there isn’t
enough gas for a warm shower and peer
owlishly at the sun and at the morning
paper skewered on the rose-bush and pity
the poor paper-seller and wonder what
new calamity of the coalmines the news
will tell of.
“Now, breakfast is fine,” or it would
be if the radiator was on. The missus
cries because she can use only one gas-
jet at once and just knows the boys will
miss their school bus. And the baker
comes with his hands blue and looking
as if he had never slept and we feel for
him and would like to offer him a cup of
steaming tea, but we have no sugar,
and, anyway, the missus has only one
gas-jet and it dying of malnutrition.
“Now, sounds in general are dull,” and
people sit in the public conveyances and
huddle in wraps and cloaks, not being
properly warmed by the semi-cold break-
fast, and envy people on the coalfields
who have ample coal and gas and elec-
tricity and beer and dog-races and days
off and can be sure of a stout, hot lunch
to warm them. And an ostentatious
gentleman, sans cloak or muffler, boards
the tram and expands his chest and blows
and pretends it is hearty weather, and
everybody would like to rise and kick
him.
“Now, riders look sharp, and horses
seem brittle in the legs, and old gentle-
men feel so,” and everybody pities the
poor tramguard, who must grasp the freez-
ing stanchion with one hand and walk
along the slippery footboard and risk his
life and still be a good unionist and vote
“Labor” at the next election.
“Now, clerks in offices envy the one
near the fireplace,” or rather would envy
him if there were a fire and sneak out be-
times to an inn and try to seduce the land-
lord into serving hot rum. And the noon
editions come out, and there is great talk
of no coal and worse to come, and people
gaze longingly at the oil-burners on sale
in the shops and would buy them if only
they knew where to get the oil.
“Now, playgoers get cold feet [albeit
not so cold as the feet of the politicians]
and the streets are comparatively
silent; and the wind rises and falls in
meanings” ; and homecoming toilers wait
long for public transport and then go
home through the gloom to another
cheerless night, and the husband steps
cautiously into the house and pecks the
missus, not sure whether she is to be in a
rage or in tears, and, finding her quiet,
says, “Now, there’s my little woman.”
And the little woman says “Shush!”
and with a gleaming eye picks up her cold
electric iron as a ring comes at the door-
bell. She hefts the iron and edges towards
the door, saying, “Now, if only this is
an inspector to see if I’m using gas! ” But
it is only the neighbor to beg a little
methylated spirit with which to start the
Primus stove, and the two go chattering
to the kitchen. Now you know the tea
will be later than ever.
In Bradman's Birthplace.
A young countryman with four years’
war service goes with a Christmas present
for his girl, who is sporting the engage'
ment ring he gave her, to the “very
select guest-house” in which she is em-
ployed as “typist-receptionist.” It is at
Bowral (N.S.W.), and is almost as famous
as Bradman to “Labor” politicians and
other fashionables, more famous to those
whom coarse-minded people characterise
(sometimes incorrectly in point of identi-
fication) as “reffos.”
Being a plumber, the young country-
man is naturally a mere caller at “the
very select guest-house,” privileged to
enter because of his known engagement to
the “typist-receptionist.” He goes to her
room, knocks at the door and opens it
There on the bed is the “typist-recep-
tionist,” clothed, ringed and flustered, for
she has with her a flash city chap, also
clothed and flustered. The indignant
swain makes for the city chap, bangs him
severely, chases him out of the girl’s
room into his own, pummelling him all
the time, and finishes the job in the “ex-
tensive grounds,” leaving the city chap
with “blooded nostrils,” a black eye and
the beginnings of a thick ear. Then,
meeting the girl, he slaps her face as a
sign that the engagement is “off.”
Surely no heinous offence in a country
where all manner of blackmarketeers and
racketeers abound and, when caught, are
let off with fines. Exactly just what any
young fellow of spirit would do anywhere
in the same circumstances. But this
young fellow had to face two charges of
assault and bear the cost of expensive
proceedings in the court of first instance
and at Campbelltown Quarter Sessions.
Here a K.C. prosecuted for the Crown
and another, with a junior, appeared for
the defence. The jury’s verdict was “not
guilty” on both counts.
One of the witnesses was Samuel Biber,
a Sydney furrier with horn-rimmed
spectacles and a nose like Abraham’s
rock. This worthy, whose son was a
member of the party—the son had to
correct “accidentally false” evidence —
said he had thrown two sauce-bottles at
the plumber. He denied a suggestion by
Shand, K.C., that he had had a successful
bankruptcy, but admitted having gone to
the Bowral police-station “with Gollan
the member of Parliament” (“Truth” re-
port) and seen the sergeant. Not, he
said, to demand the plumber’s arrest but
to ask the sergeant “to examine the posi-
tion and see the serious injuries done my
nephew.” The sergeant’s account was
that the elder Biber had called with “Mr.
Gollan’s solicitor” and demanded “the
arrest of that thug”—who had “quite a
good character.”
There are two Gollans in the Sydney
Parliament, unrelated. One is Liberal
M.L.A. for Parramatta, the other “Labor”
M. for Randwick. The latter, a
patron of the Turf, made his money in
the dead-meat trade before retiring to
pursue his other interests, and there is a
pleasing legend in Randwick that he kept
a buffer. Be this as it may, one Gollan
or the other should bring the matter up
in Parliament, if only to clear himself.
Neither can afford to rest under the sus-
picion of having brought political influ-
ence to bear so that a returned service-
man might be placed in the dock because
he administered a richly-deserved thrash-
ing to a lout who —except for the unanti-
cipated sequel—knew what he was about.
No Soldiers Need Apply.
By means of its veto the Building
Workers’ Industrial Union continues to
sabotage the ex-servicemen’s training
scheme, and the R.S.L. —its own steps
painfully slow —has finally induced the
reluctant Dedman to consent to “receive
a deputation.”
A month ago there were in Melbourne
700 trainee ex-servicemen bricklayers and
carpenters, 40 per cent, or more efficient,
awaiting jobs, which in turn were await-
ing the trainees. There are today nearly
2300 in the same category waiting in
N. and another 1100 have grown
tired of waiting since the beginning of
this year and dropped out. The president
of the R.S.L. in N.S.W. says the 8.W.1.U.
“has no intention of allowing more men
to be trained.”
The real cause of the stalling of the
training scheme was given in the Repre-
sentatives two months ago by Holt, of
Victoria, in exposing Dedman’s prevarica-
tion in support of the union in the matter.
Holloway, who followed Holt, admitted
the impeachment and said “there was no
cause for a continuance of the situation.”
He went as near as a Minister could go
to giving the lie direct to a fellow-
Minister. He promised he would get
Dedman to accompany him to see the
committee and get the wrong righted.
Nothing has happened. Dedman con-
tinues to bleat about “shortage of
materials,” the union’s manufactured ex-
cuse, but has at length agreed to talk it
over with the League, after Le has taken
time “to get his mind clear on a few
points.”
Meanwhile the Victorian regional train-
ing committee reports that “placement of
ex-servicemen building tradesmen is
nearly impossible,” and in both States
mentioned the R.S.L. declares the train-
ing scheme to be on the point of collapse.
All because an aggressive union executive,
which regards with distaste the admission
of ex-servicemen as such to the building
trades, insists on blocking the Govern-
ment scheme.
The allied Plumbers’ Union in Mel-
bourne recently refused to allow dilutee
tradesmen (sorely needed by the Mel-
bourne gas companies to assure adequate
gas services) in the companies’ mainten-
ance and installation departments.
The exclusion policy, aimed at main-
taining shortage of skilled labor, could
not be more clearly expressed than by
these unions’ tactics.
Even more remarkable than the per-
sistent avoidance of action by Dedman,
the Minister who once boasted of his Re-
habilitation Act as “the ex-servicemen's
charter,” has been the astonishing com-
placency for weeks past of the R.S.L, For
shabby dealing towards young discharged
soldiers this treatment by the Chifley
Government would be hard to beat.
More "Local" Government.
Undaunted by protests from all who be-
lieve that local government means local
government and not government of
locals by strangers,, preferably with
“Labor” tickets, Sydney’s; Mr. Cahill goes
on his merry way amalgamating shires
and councils and establishing bigger and
better bureaucracies. The new munici-
pality of Shoalhaven, on the N.S.W.
South Coast, was proclaimed in the
“Government Gazette” of June 23. It in-
cludes the old shires of Clyde and Cam-
bewarra and the former municipalities of
Nowra, Berry, Ulladulla, South Shoal-
haven and Broughton Vale —the prime
mover in the swallowing of the old coun-
cils being Nowra.
In previous Big Council outcrops the
procedure followed in choosing pro-
visional aldermen has been to leave the
matter to the councils being absorbed ;
but this time Mr. Cahill has evolved a
better method, Shoalhaven’s provisional
council has been chosen, or nominated,
or elected, by one man —Mr. Cahill.
The old councils mustered 54 aldermen;
the new one required 16. When he
looked over the 54 Mr. Cahill was appa-
rently unable to find more than 14 fit
and proper men for the new body, so
he went outside the old councils for the
other two. These selections had at
least shown in the past that they were
interested in local government and that
they wanted to be aldermen; the only
trouble was that the electors had pre-
ferred someone else. Only last December
W. P. McDonnell offered his services as
alderman, and the ungrateful ratepayers
placed him 11th in a field of 13. Mr.
Cahill has now come to the rescue. It is
to be hoped that Mr. McDonnell’s: new
responsibilities will not interfere with his
duties as president of the Nowra A.L.P.
Mr. McDonnell’s team-mate, A. J.
Clancy, has also in the past been treated
unchivalrously by the electors; not so
long ago he contested a by-election.
'There were four other candidates, and,
despite the efforts of the 28 people who
voted for him, Mr. Clancy came fifth.
That little injustice has also been recti-
fied by Mr. Cahill.
Strangely, perhaps, there are people on
the South Coast who are not pleased with
this method of choosing Shoalhaven’s
provisional council. They have been told
that it really does not matter much, as
there will be a municipal election next
December, and if they don’t like the pre-
sent team thqy can easily throw it out.
But someone down there has been read-
ing the Local Government Acts, and
points out that if Mr. Cahill feels so in-
clined he can postpone the reckoning-day
until 1950, when the triennial elections
fall due. And reckoning-days are not at
all popular with “Labor” at present.
Whither Hanlon?
A strange air of harmony prevailed in
Brisbane Trades Hall the other night
when G. M. Dawson (Carpenters’ Union)
got on his feet and said, “In my 15 years’
association with the Trades and Labor
Council I had to wait until now to find
the leader of the Government coming
along to us and so sincerely expressing
his views on such an important matter.”
The '“leader” was Premier Hanlon, the
“matter” prices-control, and in this the
Communist Dawson and Premier Hanlon
were one —in defeat —since both advo-
cated a “Yes” vote in the recent refer-
endum.
After they had heard the Premier allege
that “people who urged that Common-
wealth prices-control should be lifted had
now changed their tune,” the audience
(<Continued on page 14.)

CARRERAS LTD. OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
proceeded to elect the T. and L. C. execu-
tive, whereupon another victory for
harmony—or something—was recorded:
President, G. M. Dawson (Communist);
v.-p., M, O’Brien (A.R.U., striWe-leader);
treasurer, F. O’Brien (of the Commo-run
Sheet-metal Workers); A.C.T.U. delegates,
M. O’Brien (the same) and A. Macdonald
(Communist, Ironworkers). Other charac-
ters elected: T, Millar (Miners), Hanson
(Painters), Neumann (Meatworkers), Nolan
(A.R.U.), Englart (Wharfies).
As nice a little bunch of “mimicking
Molotovs” as any Australian Premier ever
laid eyes upon. This occurred only a
few days after the same crowd, through
Macdonald, had announced “big strikes
ahead” and “a bitter struggle likely very
soon,” and only a couple of months
after they’d staged a strike which cost
Queensland at least £2O million in cash
and untold misery and ill-feeling; it
occurred while the State was suffering
heavy losses on its Sugar Coast from the
same Communist conspiracy and in other
directions through its inability to get
urgently-needed essential material from
the south—shortages deliberately created
by the fellow-conspirators of the Brisbane
mob.
Before Queenslanders could properly
appreciate the spectacle of Hanlon among
the wolves, the Queensland A.L.P. execu-
tive next day decided “to organise indus-
trial groups to combat Communist in-
fluence among unions.” Even Mr. Han-
lon must find it all a bit puzzling.
POLITICAL POINTS
Back in London, after a brief visit to
Berlin, Chifley said it was “most im-
portant” that the Western democracies
should remain there, and promised
R.A.A.F. assistance in the merciful cam-
paign against the Communists, who have
added baby-starving to their black record
of butchery. That is better, and better
still would be announcement that Aus-
tralia will, if necessary, send a force to
Malaya to protect the Australians —tin-
miners and rubber-planters, one of whom
is “missing”—menaced by the murderous
Asiatic allies of Communists in this
country, and will in the meantime reim-
pose the ban on Communist organisations
and their printed offal.
Over the statement of Malcolm Mac-
Donald that “Communists are planning
a violent revolution to capture control
of Malaya,” a Sydney paper ran the head-
line “Malay Revolt Feared.” No “Malay”
revolt is feared. Those who aim at
“government of the people by murderers
for murderers” (to quote Ramsay Mac-
Donald’s son again) are in the main
Chinese—the same Chinese whom Sydney
Communists extolled in 1942 as unem-
ployed liberators, unused by the effete
British for their own evil purposes', and as
thick as thieves with “Australian” Com-
munist leaders before and since. The
“Straits Times” of June 22 publishes a
letter from a Kedah Malay, Melayu
Jati, addressed to a member of the
Malayan Democratic Union, which closes
with the words “We, the Malays, are
quite content with ‘British imperialism,’ so
please leave us in peace.”
Three major fires in Sydney, where the
firemen were “out” on Monday, have
this year destroyed, respectively, large
stocks of raw cotton, woodpulp and
rubber. All strategic materials, and the
first two involve dollar expenditure for
replacement. Curious —very curious.
The Q.P.P., described as “agent for the
Liberal party in Queensland,” has rushed
in with the announcement thdt it intends
contesting “the majority of the new
Queensland Federal seats” next year,
apparently irrespective of what the
Country party thinks about the truly
rural ones. This as a sequel to R. G.
Casey’s Queensland tour—Casey is the
Liberal party’s president. He ought to
carry a few gags with him when he goes
among his excessively vocal followers.
Casey had a renascence of wonder
when he visited the Blair Athol coal-
field :
At least 200 million tons of first-class
steaming coal, 50 to 90 feet thick, lying
just under the surface... .An unbelievable
sight, one of the wonders of the world.
Another wonder is that, though dis-
covered a half-century before Casey,
nothing was ever done about it.
The sixth death from gas-poisoning
since gas and coal strikes interrupted the
Sydney gas supply occurred at the week-
end. At this rate the toll of the roads
will soon fall to second place.
Dr. Evatt was heard from at the week-
end, urging “the workers” to be good
boys and declaring that “industrial stop-
pages” were “unjustifiable.”
It is up to the workers to make sure that
production is not cut down by a single
unnecessary stoppage.
And not a word about “streamlined arbi-
tration,” which, as administered by a
host of Commissioners, mostly Trades
Hall worthies, was to have ensured “full
production.” At least, that was the
promise.
Mackenzie King has stated in the
Canadian, Commons that he will not
appear again in Parliament as Prime
Minister. He is going out after the party
convention beginning on August 5. The
veteran has been P.M. for over 21 years
and Liberal leader for 29 years. The
Australian Liberal party must be green
with envy at the stability of the Canadian
show.
Ashley is making all sorts of noises
about petrol rationing having to be con-
tinued until the end of 1949. Of course,
it’s pure coincidence that continuation
will keep fuel-board employees in their
jobs until after the Federal election.
A money-spinner since Federation, the
Post Office reports a loss of £783,000 for
the year to June 30, when the prodigals
ran wild. It could have happened only
under “Labor,” with the ancient and
complacent Don Cameron as P.M.G.
Tasmania’s “ ‘Labor’ Government” got
an Assembly majority of one (15-14) for
four months’ Supply, but the bill came
back from the other shop with an inti-
mation that Supply for two months would
be voted conditionally on the “Govern-
ment’s” undertaking within that period to
go to the country. In other days this
manoeuvre would have been resented
throughout the island, but circumstances
within every Tasmanian’s knowledge have
placed the Council in an unassailable
position. That of “Labor,” as Premier
Cosgrove recognises, has not been im-
proved by union-boss threats of strikes
unless the Council backs down.
A new form of criminal has appeared.
Refused permission to use a gas bath-
heater at his Adelaide boardinghouse,
gas being officially “off” because of
N.S.W. coal strikes, a Perth man took
soap and towel to a hotel and there took
a hot bath, “a practice unusually preva-
lent just now,” the prosecuting policeman
said apropos of the charge: “unlawfully
taking a bath in a hotel.” The accused,
saying he had been dirty for a fortnight,
pleaded not guilty, and the hearing was
adjourned until today. The desperate
character should have headed for the
N.S.W. coalfields: plenty of coal, gas
and hot-water there.
Fadden, always at his best on taxation
matters, astonished a women’s meeting in
Brisbane with a few choice items:
Five shillings in the £ on wedding-
rings; 2s. in the £ on a £lOO wristlet-waccn.
Tax-free soap for racing greyhounds; 2s. in
the £ on baby-soap, and, coming to the men,
Is. 9£d. a pound on tobacco; 9d. a bottle
on beer. On matches sales tax is 2s. in the
£, plus Bd. a dozen excise.
The ladies were all of opinion that
Chifley should break it down, but Fadden
knows him better than that.
A Melbourne man, Kennedy, in the
chair at a meeting of clerks, accepted a
motion criticising the union leadership
and objecting to an increase in fees :• —
Some of the union rules are tyrannical
and oppressive, having been drawn up in
conformity with the practice observed in
other unions with Communist officials.
Communists control the Federated Clerks,
so Kennedy was fined a pound. There-
upon Lovegrove, the Victorian A.L.P.
man, said his party would ask Dr. Evatt
to bring “this gross abuse of industrial
laws” before the Arbitration Court,
adding that if the “Government” failed
in its duty to protect unionists against
such treatment they would “desert
‘Labor.’ ” Many of them, convinced that
“Labor” will take anything from Red
ruffianism, have deserted “Labor”
already.
Coal “control” in Britain is not the
one-sided thing it is here. Thirty-two
miners: concerned in a strike at Craghead
Colliery were cast in damages, £l2B, by
a Durham Court. The prosecutor wa.s
the National Coal Board. A Bodlington
wheeler left his job, pronouncing a pony
unfit for work. He was sacked by the
N.C.B. after a vet. had certified the pony
fit. In this country there is a £5OO fine
for an overwrought woman who turns
on the gas in a prohibited hour. Noth-
ing, except “amenities,” for the lout who
refuses coal for gas.
Those pessimists who despair of Aus-
tralia’s future as a nation should take
heart. A people who can stand what we
are standing now could stand anything.
Getting an extra 3,500,000 tons of coal
should be no trouble to the Premier who
was going to build 90,000 houses in three
years. Campaigning in Kogarah, he
forebore to mention how many of the
90,000 have been built there.
The Communist-bossed Miners’ Federa-
tion is trying to tempt Mt. Isa (Q.) men
away from the A.W.U., and the A.W.U.
is reminding them that Miners’ Federa-
tion members pay 12 times as much in
dues and levies as do A.W.U. men.
There are about 2000 Queensland miners
in the Communist-bossed show. Their
“contributions” in nine years, £50,000.
Lost, stolen or strayed—the McKenna
“free-medicine” scheme; compounded in
the Canberra departmental laboratories
of approved Socialist nostrums;
promised, delayed, distilled, repromised,
postponed, debated, enacted, finally pro-
claimed, rejected and entirely ignored by
the public. Lately revived, and, after
vivisection and “liberalisation,” shorn of
some penalties and freshly sugar-coated,
resubmitted (but still without takers) at
“a very full conference” (says its still
proud but pained author) “covering all
aspects.” Now disappeared from view
again. Anybody within the next month
discovering its whereabouts and restor-
ing it undamaged to its owner will be
rewarded with a liaison-officer job in any
selected department, except that of Labor
and National Service, and a free trip
abroad with dollar expenses.
In Westralia, at least, the Boy Scouts
have come out against the Eureka Yobs
and are trying to have them thrown
out of the National* Fitness movement.
It is a riposte for the suppression of the
Scouts in all Communist countries —in
Czechoslovakia “Communists moved into
Scout headquarters on Feb. 24, and
when the leaders refused to announce
affiliation with the Communist youth
organisation they were placed under
house arrest, nor has anything been
heard of them since.” So Baden Powell’s
successor. Lord Rowallan, in the U.S.A.
for a meeting of the National Boy
Scout Council, reported in May.
The Unknown Warrior rates two
minutes’ silence. Sydney wharfies stopped
for 15 minutes as a tribute to the memory
of their senior vice-president, Barney
Mullins, M.L.C. Barney was a “charac-
ter,” and no Communist, but casual
passers-by would have been more im-
pressed if the wharfies had worked for
15 minutes and given the proceeds to
Barney’s next-of-kin.
Up to July 1 more than half of the
512 “recruits” attracted to the Chambers
militia were officers and n.c.os'. who
were already in the show before the
recruiting “campaign” opened. A slight
improvement on the Liberian army, in
which every man is a general.
The Joint Coal Board has voted
£lO,OOO of tax-money for an art gallery
to bring “culture to the coalfields.” In
fancy it can see coalminers forsaking
Saturday nags and dogs to gaze enthralled
at watercolors. Nobody else can.
Calwell, unnecessarily embarrassing
our White Australia policy, is sending
back to his homeland a Sumatran pearl-
diver who joined the R.A.N. in the late
war, and, transferring to commando ser-
vice, put in 199 days behind the Japanese
lines, emerging a non-com. He can’t get a
job in Broome because, as president of the
Indonesia-Malay Association, he has been
successful in getting “full employment”
at full rates of pay for Malay divers. The
eviction of this Sumatran crusader
coincides with the return of Macßall
from the East Indies and South-east Asia
with the report that his “goodwill mis-
sion” was “successful.”
There is no more reason why the Swiss
shouldn’t have an admiral, having no
navy, than that we shouldn’t have a Coal
Board.
From the N.S.W. Blue Mountains come
rumblings of discontent with the One Big
Council thrust upon unwilling residents
a few months ago by the Local Govern-
ment Cahill. Complaints this time are
coming not from the ratepayers—they’ve
been against it all along—but from coun-
cillors, who are finding they simply can-
not cope with the work of their over-
grown foundling. By 12 votes to three
they have asked that the whole thing be
forgotten.
Australia seems to be in the middle
of an outbreak of American evangelists.
The latest one to visit Sydney made one
pertinent remark: “This business of the
State Lottery is like the Devil; it is
strangling the community.” Not quite
correct. Strangling suggests brutality ;
choking with false hopes would be nearer
the mark.
Female Comrnos are just as expert in
talking rot as the males of the species.
In Brisbane a Mrs. Kath Bacon, “national
organiser of the Eureka Youth League,”
spoke of immigrant Balts as “the dregs
of Fascism, people who will break our
strikes, people who are working for
‘spuds’ on our canefields.” Mrs. Bacon
must know, as everyone else knows, that
the Balt cane-cutters are paid full award
rates, which would be small fortunes to
their fellow-countrymen left behind in
the Soviet-dominated homelands. Con-
tinuing her attack on these new Aus-
tralians, Mrs). Cured-Pork claimed that
“the peoples of South-eastern Asia would
make better immigrants” and that “skin-
color meant nothing.” She’ll have a job
convincing Queenslanders of that.
The downhill “movement”:
Communists and fellow-travellers are now
in full control of the Victorian railwaymen’s
union and the Brisbane Labor Council. At
the State conference of the A.R.U. resolutions
against Soviet propaganda in the union
“Gazette,” and for a secret ballot on
reaffiliation with the A.L.P., were howled down
and defeated. Boss Brown and his confederates
then distributed the offices among themselves,
and the same thing happened in Brisbane with
Healy (ex-McCracken) in the saddle. Mean-
time Williams, the Communist boss of the
coalminers, arrived in Melbourne and received an
effusive welcome from Clarey of the A.C.T.U.,
who was one of Cain’s “Labor” Ministers; the
two are shown grinning, as if through horse-
collars, in an “Age” photo. As things are, it
looks as if “Labor” will wake up some morning
and discover that the “movement,” stalled
through sheer lack of spirit, has been stolen.


STEAMROLLER STRIKES TROUBLE.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Plop”: According to the map given
me by the estate-agent, my wife, the
baby, pram, dog and myself were stand-
ing on “Monmouth-road.” I steered
around the bluegum in the centre of the
track and we moved on. Further up the
slope the pram shed a wheel and the
baby’s lip quivered in the threat: “Just
watch out if I don’t get home by six,
that’s all.” Onward—and upward—on
three wheels, with the air getting rarer
and the wife on to her second issue
of blisters: paying rent for our present
flat began to seem the ideal way of spend-
ing the rest of our lives. Onward and
upward—the map, as confetti, was strewn
back for a quarter of a mile —we pro-
gressed by dead-reckoning, and I con-
soled myself With the thought that I
would be able to find south when the
Southern Cross came out. Suddenly the
scrub cleared and the rebel Monmouth
joined a fine macadamised road, but,
without a signpost, I still hadn’t the fog-
giest idea of where we were. Then my
wife noticed a place with beautiful lawns
and tall white gates bearing the goldleaf
legend “Paradise.” We had made it at
last!

“Becks”: With Sydney citizens pro-
testing against the threatened invasion of
private homes by “inspectors” from the
gas and electricity authorities, one woman
“Representing Beauty Soaps, Ltd. Hold the pose—
it’s worth a guinea !”
has already been bashed by a bogus in-
spector using the regulations as an ex-
cuse to gain access to her house. Years
ago in Adelaide a shady bird of my ac-
quaintance made quite a racket of that
sort of thing. He wore a small medal-
lion with the letters “A.E.5.,” which
stood for Adelaide Elocutionary Society
or something similar. His ruse was to
knock at a door, show the badge and
say he had come to test the meter. Think-
ing he was an official of the Adelaide
Electric Supply Company, most house-
wives would admit him. If they were
lucky all they lost was the ten bob he
collected for “adjusting the meter.” For
the others—well, perhaps the visits some
of the houses received from burglars a
few nights after “the meter-man” had
called were just examples of the long
arm of coincidence.
* * * ♦
“Jacky-Jacky”: Scanning the white-
fellow papers that have just reached our
settlement, I notice with relief that re-
porters have given up calling the Russian
and Yugoslav gentlemen involved in a
recent difference of opinion M. Stalin
and M. Tito, preferring the Anglo-Saxon
“Mister.” This, to my mind, is an im-
provement. Taking into consideration
the changes in European manners since
the Russian Revolution, the decline in
the use of the French language in diplo-
matic correspondence and the fact that
very peculiar manners are in vogue in
the U.S.S.R., the use of a Gallic handle
seems to be somewhat anachronistic. I
might, as I mentioned only yesterday to
my lubra, as legitimately call myself
Monsieur Jacky-Jacky. But even the use
of “Mr.,” to my mind, appears incorrect.
Stalin and Tito are, properly speaking,
nicknames, the former meaning steel and
the latter being an obscure Slavonic pun
on the Croatian gentleman’s fondness for
the familiar “thou”—something very like
a Sydney radio comedian’s use of the
catchcry “ ’Ow are yer, mate! ” given a
sort of ideological polish. And since
nicknames are usually given unvarnished
one does not refer, for instance, to
“Mr. Bluey and Mr. Curley”—l suggest
the gentlemen’s names should be pre-
sented in full, with Mr,, for preference ;
or, if a foreign word must be resorted to,
what’s wrong with the rugged Slavonic
simplicity of Gospodin —a word, inciden-
tally, which sounds suspiciously like
Gunga-Din to Anglo-Saxon and abori-
ginal ears?
* * * *
“Strop”; An Adelaide church displays
on a blackboard the subject of the follow-
ing Sunday’s sermon. A recent caption
was “Love or Lust?” To me that seemed
rather strong meat, and other minds must
have thought likewise as the newspaper
advertisement was bowdlerised to read:
“Affection or Infatuation?”

Bosun’s Mate”: Ships’ Names Com-
mittee has scored again with H.M.S.
Reclaim, the Navy’s latest submarine
rescue and deep-sea salvage ship. To
replace the ex-German salvage vessel pre-
viously doing the job, new ship’s
equipment will include decompression
chambers for divers, to prevent “bends,”
compressor gear for deep salvage and the
new underwater bolt-firing guns which
shoot bolts through a wreck’s iron-plating
like bullets through cactus. A plate can
be bolted over a hole in a few minutes.
Reclaim will be based on Portsmouth

“Zake”; One inevitable aftermath of
the Oliviers’ visit will be that Suburbia
will break out into a violent rash of
amateur theatricals. The last big epi-
demic followed the
Dion Boucicault N -
Irene Vanbrugh
season of the
’twenties. I was
pooled, in my inno-
cent youth, into
attending one of
these Thespian
horrors. It was ope
of the early “prob-
lem” plays, the
counterblast to the
melodrama that
had ruled for so
long. Everyone in
it was supposed to
be blase, but the
melodrama which
was actually pro-
jected was even
more evident* than
that displayed by
the old-time villain
who walked side-
ways like a crab
and stroked his 10-
in c h moustache
while he was
threatening fore-
closure of the
mortgage. Came the second act, and
Reggie entered the living-room and
registered consternation at seeing the
twisted body of the just-murdered
Deirdre crumpled on the floor. Well-
restrained anguish crossed his face ; then
he resumed his dead-pan expression. He
was about to tear at his synthetic hair
when he suddenly thought better of it;
then in the best —or worst —amateur
stylo he flung out an arm, and with his
other clenched fist brushed at a vagrant
tear. “My beloved!” he declaimed. “You
are safe in death! But what am /to do?”
As the “corpse” was composing herself
into a more comfortable position on the
floor a voice boomed from the side of the
hall: “Straighten her out before she goes
cold or you’ll have to order an S-shaped
coffin! ”

“Clooter”: The British are at long last
trying to clear away the dead-wood of
ancient laws and bring about a general
reform of the statute-books. Among
other things listed for repeal are an Act
“Guess what! I learned how to multiply today.”
of George 111 which allowed Thomas
Macklin to dispose of art treasures by
lottery, an Act of Henry VIII to naturalise
children of three Englishmen born over-
seas, an Act of Charles II for the attainder
of “several persons guilty of the horrid
murther of Charles I, an Act of Queen
Anne to supply Boston (Lincoln) with fresh
water and a George I Act slapping a duty
of 2d. on every pint of beer sold m
Edinburgh. The bill for repeal and re-
form was presented by the Lord Chan-
cellor and covers the period from 1235
to 1800, from an Act of Edward II pro-
viding that nobody be “molested for the
death of Piers de Gaveston” to a George
111 one for the watering of Piccadilly,
and it is proposed to rid the statutes of
all enactments which, by common agree-
ment, are “inoperative.” Our own statutes
could probably do with a bit of a clean-
up, though what with a growing bureau-
cracy and a Commonwealth Government
committed to Socialism-by-legislation it
looks as though the first half of the 20th
century will close with Australians
floundering in a swamp of laws, rules,
regulations and forms.

“Bullen Mouth”; Melbourne, which
takes its football so seriously that some-
thing like 100,000 citizens turn out every
Saturday to watch the six V.F.L. matches,
is beginning to think that liquor-bars will
have to be banned from football-grounds.
Twice this year serious brawls have
broken out, and twice football officials
have blamed the booze. A couple of
Saturdays ago police had to form a guard
around the umpire’s dressing-room at
Carlton when about 500 yahoos gathered
round with threats and abuse. Mcßrien,
secretary of the V.F.L., saw a combina-
tion of the 40-hour week and booze as the
cause. “Youths get drunk at hotels on
Saturday mornings. Then the pubs close
and they make for football-grounds, and
because of the surprising amount of
liquor available at booths there the
grounds are rapidly becoming the
rendezvous of undesirable louts.” Any-
how, the V.F.L. is to share control of
ground liquor licences next year, so it
will get its chance to ban the stuff,
* * * »
“Ray Whiting”: At the mounting of
the guard the C.O.’s scowling dial was
always at the orderly-room window, and
if there was the slightest bit of slovenliness
we heard about it loud and strong. One
evening a bloke got one “up the spout,”
and at the bang the face at the window
vanished with amazing abruptness to the
accompaniment of an ominous crash
inside. The bullet, we learned later, had
whizzed around the orderly-room in a
ricochet. No, not off the C.O.’s skull,
only the typewriter.
* * * *
“Dong”: Years ago, on that whiskered
recreation of trying to detect from a
person’s face and its owner’s general
appearance what kind of a man he is,
“Furor Scribendi” used four pages of
our school magazine. He exhorted us to
take up the practice and, from memory,
he wound up with something like this:
....If you indulge in this pastime,
wherever you go on the steps up the ladder
of life, you will gain not only interest,
but a free and magnificent insight into
human nature which will serve you for ever.
Well, I’ve stumbled about half-way up the
ladder, a confirmed dial-scrutiniser all the
way, and must now report that the whole
scheme is a fizzer. Take yesterday’s ex-
perience. While I stood in our butcher’s
a very likely subject entered, looking as
if he owned the place. He toted a Hom-
burg and a yellow brief-case, wore a pin-
stripe suit with no shine at the back, and
with trouser-cuffs in perfect repair.’ Of
course I could class him: “Successful
man, very probably chairman of directors
of this meat company, with everything at
his fingertips and with of
commerce unlimited. ” I was wrong ; he
was merely a customer. He said that he
wanted some steak “for a pie,” but when
asked what type he was hopelessly con-
fused, Blushing, and with the prestige
I’d given him hanging in rags, he blurted
out: “Well, I know it’s pot porterhouse—
that’s got bones in it.”
* * * *
“Den”: Instead of following the craze
for painting of slums (B. 16/ 6/’4B), why
don’t our artists put on canvas some of
Australia’s old colonial homes? Whoever
turns to this field will produce work his-
torically valuable and make for himself
an enduring niche. In a few years it may
be too late. Many characteristic speci-
mens disappeared in the last 20 years;
others are certain to follow.
* * * *
“Bohemian”: Henry Kendall con-
sidered Adam Lindsay Gordon (B.
7 / 7/’4B) was entitled to “a royal place
within the Temple of the Beautiful.” A
poet may write about a pig-sty in classic
verse or soar “beyond the sunset and
the baths of all the western stars” in
doggerel. Gordon had the mind of a
great poet, despite the fact that he wrote
“How We Beat the Favorite” and other
verses that sounded only a minor key.
No other Australian poet has ascended
so high—when the mood was on him.
One poem may make a poet’s reputation,
though popularity is no test —how the
mob lapped up “The Sentimental Bloke''!
New Zealanders have gravely assured me
that Bracken’s “Not- Understood” was
the greatest poem in the world. “Odus
Pokus” lifts Gordon to the highest peak
of Olympus.

“Eureka”; They breed them tough in
Waterloo, one of Sydney’s industrial
suburbs. Half a dozen kids in a side
lane were picking on one boy. “What’s
the trouble?” I asked him. “They called
me a cissy,” he said. “So he is,” the
juvenile gang-leader chirped up. “He’s
thirteen and no teeth knocked out!”
* * * *
i “Old Firm”: Movie ad. in a metro-
politan paper —circa 1917 —would have
made modern Hahllywood publicity boys
sneer themselves to death. Sole boost
for a contemporary cinematic attraction
at a leading theatre was: “This picture
has a great reputation.” The H.P.Bs.
have amassed a few thousand high-
powered superlatives since then.
* * * *
“Vic”: A cable mentioning that a 27-
year-old Westralian, Peter van Notten-
Pole, had succeeded to an English
baronetcy reminded me that the young
man’s father was for many years a resi-
dent of Toodyay. He was Arthur Chandos
Pole, and he had a vineyard in the Deep-
dale district which he called Eumalga.
Eumalga wines were highly reputed in
my boyhood. He died —after abandoning
the Toodyay property, marrying late in
life and re-establishing himself as a vig-
neron at Glen Forrest, up in the ranges
above Perth —about seven or eight years
ago, having abandoned all hope of ever
succeeding to the title. Pole was a great
chap and a hell of a good mixer. His
chief public distinction in Toodyay was
that he once nominated for a road-board
election, forgot to vote for himself—
and got nary a vote. This must be an
Australian record.
OMAR KHAYYAM AT THE RACES.
I sometimes think that never smells so rank
The turf as where the racing stirrups clank,
That nowhere else is such a fertile field
For what you might describe as hanky-pank.
This well-appointed course, so neat and grand
And picturesque as visioned from the Stand,
Could it but speak, what tales it might unfold
Of all the rigs and ramps upon it planned!
For all the zeal our sporting prophets show
In picking prads whereon to risk your dough,
The problem’s always left for you to solve,
Whether their choice is meant to win or no.
Some, swift to start, are missing at the close.
And ’mong the watching crowd, one may
suppose,
Is one of whom a cynic would suggest:
“He knows about it all. He knows. HE knows!”
The equine champ you’ve planked your brass
upon
Gets somehow interfered with, and anon,
Like froth upon your schooner’s brimming
top v
Before you get it to your lips, is gone.
A well-marked card whereon to bend my brow,
A wad of notes to speculate, and thou
Beside me in your brightest and your best,
Away we go to beat the books. But how?
The steeds no question make of fast or slow,
But slow or fast, as suits the rider, go;
And he who bellows “Three to one the field,”
Bethink, there isn’t much he doesn’t know.
Sooner or late, sure as the crack of doom
It comes, the horse that we were bidd’n assume
A sure and certain moral takes the knock
To let another make a punch—for whom?
And on the air we hear an angry shout,
Nor need to wonder what it’s all about.
An ebullition from a hundred throats,
A devastating roar of “Rub Them Out!”

“JUDGE COLT
PRESIDING”
In the turbulent cow towns of the early west “Judge Colt” was the only respected law, and a
quick trigger finger the only insurance against an early grave on“ Boot Hill”. Forever associated
with those roaring days is the famous Colt .45 single action revolver first patented in 1833.
From that time on, most Westerners carried one, and many a notorious figure of those days is
remembered for his skill in its use.
Two cardinal rides for good gun sport... a well kept weapon ... and
consistent sporting ammunition ammunition bearing the i.c.i. brand.

“L. de Rideau”; “Pitt St.” remarks on
the social snobbery at the Olivier open-
ing in Sydney (B. 7/7/’4B) that “if
Literature and the Arts were represented
on the first night nobody noticed it.” It
was just the same, if not more so, in
Melbourne. But passing Glen’s in Collins-
street one wet and windy midnight I
noticed crouched on a campstool and
huddled up in blankets, keeping a 26-hour
vigil for the official handout of coupons
to attend “Richard III” at the Princess, a
figure which has been familiar to me for
a generation. I saw the same figure a
few weeks later in the queue for
“Hamlet,” the Olivier film production,
at the Athenaeum. It belonged to Beres-
ford Fowler, the Melbourne producer
who has kept the Bard’s flag flying for at
least three decades in hundreds of Shak-
spearean productions in obscure little
halls.

“Findy”: Our Army is a small one
now, but the red-tape is still there in
abundance. Last week an officer was at
long last demobilised. His wife,' with a
thought to her depleted linen cupboard,
asked him to bring home a couple of the
excellent Army towels that are now doing
good service in thousands of Australian
homes. The procedure is quite simple ;
the departing soldier just collects the
towels from the Q-store and the cost is
debited in his paybook. At least that’s
what this departing soldier had been told.
He breasted the store counter, made his
request and two towels were produced
from a rack. “That’ll be so much,” said
the Q-store wallah, “and four coupons.”
“Coupons!” protested the officer. “I
thought that business was all over.” “It
is for civilians,” said the Q-bloke, “but
not for us. We haven’t got any instruc-
tions yet.”

“Jasby”: “P.P.’s” joy at finding a
restaurant Which serves mustard would
have seemed ludicrous a few years ago,
but today it is quite understandable. A
joint I frequent more on account of its
proximity than for the quality of its
cuisine seems to have more than its quota
of shortages. Sometimes it is the milk
that has run out; other times sugar.
Recently Col of the sweet tooth sought
to overcome the difficulty by taking along
a small paper package of sugar. He
sugared his own tea and doled out a
modicum to the rest of us at the table.
There was a small quantity over, so when
he was leaving he carefully wrapped it
up and was about to pocket it when the
waitress pounced and accused him of
pinching the cafe’s sugar. Col protested
it was his own, but she’d heard that tale
before. Another waitress supported her
and called in the manageress, who de-
manded the return of the stolen sugar.
“It’s mine,” protested Col, “Look around
you. There’s no sugar in the place except
this. That’s why I brought it in.” Light
dawned. “Sorry,” said the manageress.
“I’m getting mixed up. I was thinking
this was a no -milk day.”

“T.F.”: What kind of mollycoddles
are we making of our younger genera-
tion? When I first made the acquaintance
of “Little Red Riding Hood” the yarn
related how after the wolf had eaten
“Get ready — he's spotted the bait."
Granny, the woodsman rushed in and
mauled it with his axe, and there was
blood everywhere. Later on someone
broke it down a bit by including a post-
mortem on the wolf, with the extraction
of Granny, still in one piece. Now the
degeneration is- complete! Last night I
heard a radio version in the children’s
session, wherein the woodsman merely
shouted “Get out, you wicked old wolf! ”
and the wolf bolted for the scrub. Then,
lest the little ones should weep for old
Granny, she was produced out of a cup-
board !
* * * *
“Bo”: The trouble with this world of
ours is that its inventors put overmuch
time and thought to evolving complicated
machines and gadgets which would speed-
up production if something else didn’t
stop it and too little in exercising their
grey matter on improving the creature
comforts of man. As a simple instance,
why hasn’t something been done about
the neckband of a man’s shirt —it is as
rigidly crude today as when the first one
was made centuries ago? When a man,
lazing on a good holiday, puts on up to
a stone in weight the one bit of his hide
that’s sure to swell out is his neck —a
strangulable neckband and collar is the
natural result. Conversely, should a swift
illness bring his weight down his neck
will do the prune act; in which case he
swims inside his neckband. On those
occasions when my own neck has visibly
swollen, whether from physical well-
being or having just got my tax assess-
ment, I’ve done the usual thing—slit the
stud-holes along to within a fraction of
an inch of the edge; but it wants only
one full-blooded sneeze then to reduce
the whole thing to an irreparable wreck.
Forward to the mercery counter, you in-
ventors, and give us an adjustable neck-
band!

“Horseless Horseman”; Another fatal
railway accident occurred near Harden on
January 25, 1885, when the Melbourne-
Sydney mail crashed through a bridge at
Salt Clay Creek, killing seven and seri-
ously injuring 25. On approaching the
creek in the fading daylight the train-
driver, Andy Moodie, saw that the flood-
waters were level with the bridge deck-
ing, so he put on speed in an effort to
get the train across. When the engine
and three carriages had crossed, the bridge
collapsed, plunging the rear carriages into
the creek. The train was packed with
racing men on their way to the Randwick
Anniversary meeting—among them a
famous bookmaker of the day, Leviathan
Joe Thompson.

“Pawang”: The Commonwealth Film
Censor says horror films don’t disturb the
minds of children as much as they do
those of adults, especially elderly people.
How can he be certain? The outward
manifestation might be a completely
phlegmatic youngster sitting bored to dis-
traction while some Frankenstein monster
strangled a string of women, but all sorts
of things might be piling into his un-
conscious. And how does the censor know
whether the child isn’t in the same posi-
tion as a boy of my acquaintance whose
parents were divorced? First the boy saw
his father off to England and showed no
great agitation as the ship left. A few
months later off the ex-wife went, and
again the boy was taken down to the
wharf to see her off. A year or two later
his grandmother took the child for an
outing. All children should love ships, so
she led him down to the wharf to see the
pretty steamers. Much to her amazement
when he saw one he ran away screaming
in terror. He did not know why he did
it any more than his grandma. The
steamer invoked a memory of the double
act of desertion by his parents.

“Muskee'n.”: That p.-0.-w. with the
barrow (B. 23/6/’4B) had a predecessor of
sorts in a naturalised German conscripted
into a British Labor Corps in World
War I. When stationed near Boulogne all
his days were spent in the church army
hut,-and after the armistice he confiden-
tially spilt the beans. Every day he
marched with a bulging sack down to the
incinerator near the hut, and being
stopped by the sentry would reply “1
go to ze incinerator wid ze rags and ze
bottles.” The rags and bottles were
nothing more than a Jong piece of stout
wire, which he had wound into something
resembling a crinoline, and over which
the sack was tightly stretched.

“Melbn”; There was a touch of irony
about the operations of a pyromaniac
who has been setting fire to hedges in
Melbourne suburbs. One of his victims
was Galbraith, chairman of the Forests
Commission, who is responsible for the
“Prevent Fires” propaganda.
* * * *
“Curtain Raiser”: The difficulty men-
tioned in Sundry Shows (B. 23/6/’4B) of
assessing the Olivier presentation of such
a hallowed thing as “Hamlet” was ex-
emplified in a Melbourne cafe argument
on the liberties the actor-producer took
with the drama. One Shakspeare-lover
complained at the excising of the solilo-
quy “Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave
am I.” Another indignantly denied that
the Olivier blue pencil had been exercised
on that passage. He left the filmhouse,
he asserted, with the majestic phrases
ringing in his ears. A census was taken
and half those present swore they had
heard it; the other half swore equally
emphatically that it was never spoken.
Two of the party were deputed to pay a
second visit to the Athenaeum; they re-
ported that the first man was right. The
others had been victims of the halluci-
natory process which causes one thing to
conjure up the memory of another.

“Cherub 103”: This ballyhoo about
the Oliviers! For 40 years Sydney had
its own “Old Vic,” The Royal Victoria
Theatre opened in 1838 in Pitt-street
near where Hordern Brothers’ shop stands
today. It held 2000 people, and was
“magnificently appointed.” Prices ranged
from a bob to five shillings, and there
was a standing orchestra of 18 to listen
to. First show was “Othello,” in which
Mr. Arabin from Hobart Town played
the Moor, “and manifested a very chaste
conception of the part.” After that
everything from wizards to French light
opera flashed across Sydney’s only
boards. In those days Australians were
asking for Australian actors and Aus-
tralian plays, but the management looked
to England for talent, though, as today, it
was only occasionally that players of the
Olivier type favored us with their pre-
sence, In the roaring ’forties “The Cab-
bage Tree Mob” —deadbeats and larri-
kins who wore low-crowned cabbage-
palm hats and didn’t have enough cash
to get in—used to take out their indigna-
tion on the hats of gentlemen going into
the theatre by pulling them down over
their eyes. Our “Old Vic,” was gutted by
fire 40 years after its opening.
COLD COMFORT.
“Asked what action the Government was taking
to increase coal production, Premier MeGirr pointed
out that a programme had already been arranged
for the development of new State mines which would
provide an extra million tons a year.”
Cold comfort, this, for those who find
The present shortage cruel

THE SERVICE MAN
The Drift Towards War
“Ek Dum”: However much
actual inconveniences in Berlin
may be exaggerated, it is a cer-
tainty that the present rift be-
tween the Western Powers and
Russia cannot continue to de-
velop without serious trouble.
The world position is more
alarming than it appeared to be
even in June or July, 1939, with
the difference that the press
which then was all against “ap-
peasement” is now mostly for
it. Those who believed in 1939
that Hitler would not fight if
the Western Powers —the United
States left out —shook their fists
in his face and abused him
loudly enough to terrify him
now believe either (a) that
Russia means war in any case,
( b ) that Stalin is a hero who
cannot be intimidated.
The facts are frightening
enough, and though attention is
concentrated on Berlin, the pic-
ture is world-wide.
The Russians have made
Allied co-operation in Japan im-
possible by their surly, insult-
ing and odd-man-out attitude.
They are not only countenanc-
ing but helping forays from the
Communist Korea, which they
have created, into American-
controlled southern Korea, and
they have shown themselves de-
termined to create a satellite
State in Korea.
In Manchuria they stripped
the whole country of metals,
machinery and resources which
belonged either to the Allies as
a whole as security for repara-
tions or to the Chinese National
Government under agreement.
They did not leave Manchuria
at the date agreed upon, but re-
mained there until the Chinese
Communists had had time to
organise armies and occupy
strategic positions to prevent
the Chinese carrying out the oc-
cupation which the Russians,
among others, had agreed that
they should carry out. The
Chinese National Government
alleges that Russian officers and
soldiers are frequently found
among the Chinese Communist
force’s dead. It seems that
Russia is clandestinely at war
with China. The agreement to
repatriate Japanese prisoners-of-
war has been flagrantly broken.
Anything from 250,000 to
500,000 have disappeared off the
face of the earth. They are pre-
sumably permanently in the
slave-camps of northern Siberia,
with the 2,000,000 Germans and
Poles who have disappeared, or
working voluntarily under
promise that presently they will
become armies of liberation,
Siberia is closed to Western
travellers. It is as inaccessible
as the moon.
It was an agreement made be-
tween the Allies at the end of
the war that Russia should be
allowed to occupy Dairen-Port
Arthur area for a brief period,
and it was taken for granted by
those among the Western and
Far Eastern Powers that that
area would remain open and ac-
cessible to other allies' to the
same extent as British and U.S.
ports were accessible to Russian
ships. The iron curtain, how-
ever, was pulled down tight
round Dairen. The port has not
been given back. The Allies are
shut out.
In Southern Asia
In Southern Asia a concerted
campaign began the moment the
war ended to drive the Western
nations out. The Russians, who
never moved a finger to help win
the Pacific War, but who were on
hand to collect the spoils when it
was won, were ready with a
propaganda campaign urging the
Malays, the Indonesians, the
Filipinos, the Indians, the
Burmese and the Arabs and
Egyptians to kick out their Wes-
tern “masters!” and come close
under the wing of the only Real
Mackay among peaceful nations
—Soviet Russia.
Having to deal with week-
kneed Governments like the
Attlee “Government,” the Chif-
leys and their like, they have
almost succeeded in their objec-
tives.
They persuaded the British,
through a world-wide barrage
of savage propaganda in which
nearly every daily newspaper
writing in English was their in-
strument, to allow sections of
the Malays and Chinese in
Malaya to arm early in 1942.
The whirlwind is now being
reaped there. Murder, terrorism
and rapine run riot. The condi-
tion of the country is such that
at the week-end the British were
fending off 400 guerrillas who
threatened to attack the capital,
Kuala Lumpur,
In Siam the Soviet has estab-
lished one of its huge Embassy
staffs surrounded by the usual
network of Communists, mer-
cenaries and Chetniks.
In Southern China enclaves of
Communist territory have been
formed on an alarming scale,
but so unobtrusively as to be
little noticed. Almost the whole
of Hainan Island, strategically
placed to guard the route to
Hong Kong and the North
China coast, has come under
Communist domination without
attracting the attention of
cricket-racing-mad editors.
Burma has gone to the very
edge of jumping over the Com-
munist precipice. Millions of
lives were lost in India through
the precipitate departure of the
British without due preparation,
largely because of Communist-
inspired propaganda which the
world’s press made its own. The

contempt of the Egyptians for

Out with Nationalists
' In eastern and western Europe
the position is too appalling for
words. There is a general cam-
paign, directed from Moscow, in
progress' to “cleanse” Com-
munist parties everywhere of
“nationalistic” leaders, i.e „
leaders who are shaky in
allegiance to Moscow.
Though Marshal Tito has
been re-elected head of the
Army of Yugoslavia, it is
Obvious that Russia is still in
command of the Communist
forces there, which early in the
week swore allegiance to the
Soviets, A Russian military
mission is on its way to Albania,
a sort of Communist Gibraltar
on the Adriatic. It was actually
established as Communist by
specific Russian organisation.
It was discovered some time ago
that the paper money of the new
Communist republic had been
‘ printed in Moscow months be-
fore Albania decided to have its
revolution.
In France, steps are being
taken to make a Tito out of the
faithful Thorez or replace him —
if he does not come to heel —by
the savage ruffian Marty, a
blackguard worthy of 1789-91
at its worst.
Southward Move
In Australia, the leadership
of the Communist party has re-
cently been changed, the weight
of control being moved from the
hands of the old leaders into
those of a fellow who received
his Communist education in the
Lenin School in Moscow, and
who sails under a name which is
not his own. This breed of Com-
munist foreign-trained, speci-
fically linked with Moscow and
Russian-speaking now forms
the real control of Communism
in Australia. These people are
the general staff. The “fighting”
commanders of Communism are
the Thorntons and the Healys
of the big unions—foulers of
their own nests, haters of every-
thing in freedom this country
stands foremen who should be
outlawed and if possible de-
ported to a more congenial
atmosphere, more especially
since they claim to be a nation
within a nation, and only ready
to obey Australian laws when it
suits Moscow to have them,
obeyed.
That Moscow Communism is
moving purposefully south as
well as east and west is shown
by the recent building of a large
Soviet diplomatic link with the
Indonesian Republic in Java.
This was done contempor-
aneously with an outbreak of
propaganda against the Dutch
and a revival of the “liberation”
cause, which has the whole-
hearted support of the Australian
Communist party and all the
assistance it can give.
The news of the establishment
of the Indonesian Soviet
Embassy was radioed last week
from Prague, presumably by
John Fisher, formerly Canberra
correspondent of the “Tribune,”
and afterwards Australian press’
publicity officer to the Australian
Legation in Moscow. His wife
is acting as Prague correspon-
dent of some of the Australian
daily newspapers, who treat her
dispatches with the greatest re-
spect. Her husband was, before
the last war, employed by the
Comintern, and the Moscow
“News.”
The Berlin Position
The Berlin position is almost
at the stage of being untenable:
The Allies, who have as much
right to be there as the Russians
—more because of the part they
played in the war, and the fact
that they could have taken Berlin
days before the Russians
reached it —are being treated as
enemies. Their area is blockaded
as with a tightening military
siege. Their food supplies and
those of the 2,000,000 Germans
for which they are responsible
are cut off from the east. Their
land traffic is blocked entirely.
Their airlanes are menaced by
crowds of Russian fighters, not
to mention barrage balloons.
Their nationals are treated with
every indignity it is possible
to impose. The Russian com-
mand has moved itself 35 miles
back into a strategic position,
well out of range of gunfire
from the Western zones: Nazi
war criminals in the Russian
zone were generally released last
week.
The position is as dangerous
as it can be. The discussions
of defence in London, to which
there is reason to believe that
Mr. Chifley was hastily sum-
moned, and Marshal Mont-
gomery’s speech in Paris are
ominous signs, particularly the
latter, since a few months ago
he was preaching the unlikeli-
hood of war for 10 years at least.
He said:
We must let it be known that
Britain and France mean to advance
together with but one object—to safe-
guard our own homelands and those
of people who look to us for help
if they should again be threatened.
Then, indeed, might war be
averted. Then, together, We could
lead the West back to peace and
stability.
And Earl Mountbatten has re-
turned quickly to the Royal
Navy and taken over command
of a strategic cruiser squadron.
It is the first time in history that
a former Viceroy has gone to
such a command, infinitely junior
to the military position which
he occuped during the war,
unless it has some important
tasks not yet disclosed.
It is a time for cool heads and
the avoidance of provocation,
but also for firmness.

PESONAL ITEMS
First top-flight job of Count Berna-
dette, whose valiant attempt to bring
peace to Palestine seems to have failed,
was Swedish High Commissioner at New
York World’s Fair in 1939. From then on
his rise has been spectacular. Vice-chair-
man of the war-time Swedish Red Cross,
he managed exchange of Allied internees
and prisoners-of-war with Axis nationals
in Europe. In early 1945 he scored over
Himmler, obtaining permission to evacu-
ate Norwegian students imprisoned in
Dachau concentration camp and members
of the Danish police force Interned in
Germany to South Denmark. Berna-
dotte’s “White Buses,” with Swedish
Army volunteers, evacuated not only
Scandinavians but anyone they could
find, clearing Ravensbruck alone of 4000
inmates. Once in Denmark they soon
transferred to Sweden. Swedish Red
Cross kept them in special camps, saving
many, including Norway’s present
Minister of External Affairs, Herr Lange,
from certain death. In April, 1945,
Himmler approached Bernadotte with his
proposal for a separate peace, and re-
ceived from him the Allies’ reply de-
manding unconditional surrender. In the
following year Bernadotte was made
chairman of the Swedish Red Cross and
last year Chief of Swedish Boy Scouts.
A nephew of King Gustav, he married a
commoner, Esther Manvill, an American
he met on the Riviera. Bernadette’s
biggest asset as a diplomat is a capacity
for picking sound advisers ; if he tackles
many jobs like the Palestine one he’ll
need them.
Arrived in Melbourne to take up his
post as Fourth Naval Member at R.A.N.
Headquarters, Commodore Guy Wil-
loughby, R.N., has already taken his part
in organising Australia’s sea defences. A
‘pioneer flier, he had served on most
carriers of the Royal Navy by 1938, when
he took command of the wings of
Glorious. His first war-time command
was escort - carrier Activity, which
patrolled the hazardous Murmansk route,
when convoys sometimes lost half their
strength from wolf-pack U-boat attacks.
In 1944 Commodore Willoughby was
transferred to the British Eastern Fleet
as chief staff officer of the carrier
Admiral. He planned the succession of
attacks against Japanese bases in the
N.E.I. He comes from the directorship
of Air Warfare and Training at the Ad-
miralty, and spent last year studying
problems of Commonwealth defence at
the Imperial Defence College. Rear-
Admiral Collins was a fellow-student.
Retired from the Presbyterian minis-
try after 40 years, Dr. Victor C. Bell,
Born at Grenfell (N.S.W.) 70 years ago,
he was ordained in the Methodist ministry
in 1908 and served in several country
towns and in William-street, Sydney, be-
fore transferring in 1917 to the Presby-
terian church as pastor at Greenwich, on
the Lane Cove River. From Greenwich
he went to Newtown and thence, in 1927,
to Strathfield, where he remained until
his retirement. Dr. Bell has twice been
Moderator of the Sydney Presbytery, and
was Moderator of the N.S.W. General
Assembly in 1941-42. He has been asso-
ciated as director with the Queen Vic-
toria Maternity Hospital, the Burnside
Homes and the Dunmore Girls’ Hostel,
is well known for his radio talks on re-
ligious subjects, and in 1936 published
Religion and Reality.
John David Rogers, 0.8. E., M.C.,
Belgian Croix de Guerre, who becomes
Vacuum Oil’s marketing director for
Australia and the Pacific Islands, has
dabbled in more than viscous liquids.
He went into smoke in Melbourne dur-
ing the late war for three years as Direc-
tor of Military Intelligence, his h.q. being
an old mansion in the suburbs. There
he trained and organised the training of
over 4000 men who were sprayed out
over the Pacific on all sorts of secret
missions. He was born at Penguin (Tas.),
educated at the University of Melbourne,
is a veteran of both wars and president
of the Imperial Service Club. W. L.
Orchard succeeds him as g.m. for N.S.W.
Wherever wool and stock are talked
about the name of Wal Lumby, dead
in Sydney at 61, is familiar. Born at
Emerald Hill (N.S.W.), he was a wool
instructor at Sydney Tech. College at
19, launched out on his own at Wee Waa
in a stock-and-station agency 40 years
ago, came to Sydney in 1913, worked
for a couple of the major wool firms
until 1929, then joined Keith Badgery.
Later the firm merged with Schute, Bell
and Co. and became Schute, Bell,
Badgery, Lumby, Ltd., with Wal Lumby
as managing-director. He rapidly made
a reputation as a Merino judge in N.S.W.
and N.Z. and was an authority on the
breed. Chairman of the N.S.W, Wool-
selling Brokers and their delegate on the
National Council, he was also on the
N.S.W. Sheepbreeders’ Association
Council.
“S.T.S.” rejports changes in Adelaide
educational circles: —-
Prince Alfred College has chosen a new
Head to succeed J. F. Ward, who retires at
Christmas after 18 years in command. The
newcomer is Maoruander John Dunning, a
Rhodes Scholar who gained his M.Sc. in the
Dominion and his M.A. at Oxford. He lec-
tured in honors Maths, at Otago University
before his appointment as Head of Scats’ Col-
lege, Warwick (Q.), in 1939. In 1937 he toured
England as a member of the M.L. cricket
team. He’s 45.
New chaplain of St. Peter’s College«is L. N.
Blakney, who served with the 2/3 Machine-
gun Battalion and was a p.-0.-w. in Java for
three years.
Adelaide ’Varsity is looking for a successor
to Prof. Kerr Grant. It wants “one of the
ablest of the modern school of physicists, with
the English-speaking countries preferred.”
R. V. S. Bain returns to Sydney and the
University School of Veterinary Science as
senior lecturer; for the past 18 months he
has been veterinary pathologist in Adelaide.
John Horner is taking on additional lecture-
ships at the Conservatorium; in consequence
he gives up the post of organist and choir-
master of Stow Memorial Church.
When Mcßeath called on E. R. T.
Reynolds, K.C., the new Liberal member
for Toorak (Vic.) —majority 4000 —to get
the accompanying sketch it was a frosty
morning, and apparently a warm fire
glowed somewhere behind the subject. A
large photo, of General Monash on the
wall recalled that Reynolds had served
in the 1914 war, but going back earlier
than that, the K.C. told how, as a lad,
his ambition was to see himself in print
in The Bulletin. The masterpiece he
selected was a sonnet based on Shak-
speare’s “Dark Lady.” The comment in
“Answers to Correspondents” he has
never forgotten: “For the sake- of the
widow who has her mite invested in an
insurance co. we have consigned your
sonnet to the w.p.b.” It was this that
possibly turned the new member from
the paths of poesy to the walks of law,
in which he has earned distinction. Born
at the mining township of Walhalla in
1892, he was educated at Coburg State
school and the University of Melbourne,
POLITICS.
where he was Henry Berthon Scholar at
Trinity. His colleagues regard him as one
of the most polished orators of the Vic-
torian Bar, of which he is chairman of the
Committee of Counsel; he has an amaz-
ing fluency, backed up with a keen sense
of humor and a wide knowledge of classi-
cal literature.
Mayne Lynton, who plays Antony in
the season of “Julius Qesar” which opens
at Sydney Royal tomorrow, has a
theatrical record which reads almost like
an edition of Who’s Who in the Theatre.
Born at Carlisle, on the border of Scot-
land, he went on the stage early with the
F. R. Benson Shakspearean company.
STAGE .
then to Glasgow in “Rob Roy,” produced
by R. C. Buchanan, father of Jack, then
to melodrama with Melville at the Old
Shoreditch in East London and to Frank
Curzon’s company. In 1911 he crossed
to America with the Sothern and Julia
Marlowe Shakspearean company, after
which he joined Sir Ben Greet in pastoral
productions of Shakspeare and old
English comedies. Lynton played in the
Cumstock and Gest production of
“Aphrodite” under the direction of
Belasco; with George Arliss in the
original production of “Disraeli”; and
received 175 dollars a week to say “Yes,
sir” and “No, sir” in just the way George
M. Cohan wanted it —he was the 13th in
that particular part. Roles with Marie
Tempest and Douglas Fairbanks followed,
and then films with such old familiar
names as Marguerite Clark, Mary Pick-
ford, Billie Burke and Olga Petrova.
Lynton was brought to Australia by
J.C.W. in 1922 to play the part of “The
Bat” and remained to act with Emelie
Polini, Lady Forbes Robertson, Pauline
Frederick, Muriel Starr and Nellie
Stewart, In 1936 he went to Melbourne
to produce plays for A.8.C., returning to
Sydney in 1944, since when he has been
doing a commendable job with Shak-
speare for Sydney and other N. S. Wales
audiences.
Young Arthur Manton-Hall, selected
to play for Australia in the match be-
tween the boy chess champions of Great
Britain and Australia —a sideshow of the
radio chess match between the two coun-
tries on July 17 and 18—has made pro-
gress that has amazed the experts since
he shared N.S.W. junior championship
honors with Will Levick last November.
Starting his chess with Canterbury Tech-
nical High only a couple of years ago,
he entered the championship reserves in
May and went through without losing a
game, beating ex-championship players.
Then in the Hundred Board match he
drew with M. E. Goldstein, who has
played international chess for both Britain
and Australia and is in the super-player
class.
Victorian Railways Institute gym-
nasium is claiming a new record. Four
of its members will compete in this year’s
Olympic Games. They are Dick Garrard,
wrestler, who took part in the 1936

Games in Japan in 1939 ; Bruce Arthur,
one of the most promising middleweight
wrestlers in Australia and holder of Vic-

Triton, Salacia and Sea Rover were a
few of them —and was a crew member of
more than he or anyone else could re-
member, He was a life-member and for
29 years a committeeman of Sydney
Amateur Sailing Club, member of Royal
Prince Alfred Yacht Club, Royal Auto-
mobile Club, the League of Ancient
Mariners, and the Ship Lovers’ Society, i
and his skill as boat designer and rigger
won him an associateship of the Institu-'
tion of Naval Architects. Bom in Adel-1
aide, in his early years he lived in every 1
mainland State, joined the Manly Ferries
in 1899, became accountant in 1907,
general manager and secretary 1925, and
m.-d. last year.
“Cobba”: I worked, for and alongside 1
T. W. Crawford (B. 16/6/’4B) 40 years
ago on his cane property at Brie Brie,
within a stone’s-throw of the Mossman
Sugar Mill. With a hoe over his shoulder
T.W. would appear among his chippers
about 9 a.m. —they started 90 minutes
earlier —and throw out a challenge to race
to the end of the row. New hands would
take him on for an hour or so, when, with
the appearance i of smoke-oh, he would
shoulder his hoe and beat it homewards,
to return again in the early afternoon
looking for someone else to race. It was
a ten-hour day, with Saturday (half holi-
day finish) at 4 p.m., but the accommoda-
tion was good, the cooking and food ex-
cellent and we lads were. made to feel *
quite at home by Crawford and his
womenfolk.
Dead at Balmain, Sydney, at 80, Louis
H. Paul, who, with Edward Dyson,
Eardley Turner, Louis Esson and Harold
Mercer, was one of the mainstays of
The Bulletin’s “Poverty Point” in the
heyday of the Australian stage. P.P.
vanished with the decline of the theatre,
but at intervals since then L.H.P. had
contributed interesting snippets of
theatrical history. His personal recollec-
tion of the Sydney stage went back to
the 1880’s ; his records' further still. His
last paragraph, an item on “the predeces-
sors of the Oliviers,” appeared on Society
page, 30/6/’4B, two days before he died,
A relation writes: “He kept a diary from
1888. The last entry in it recorded that
The Bulletin had published his Olivier
par., and that ‘it greatly cheered me.’ ”
Members of the staff recall him as a
courteous old gentleman who could
answer any question fired at him concern-
ing plays and players of the past.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 68, Lieutenant-Colonel
William Thomas Tackaberry, who was com-
manding officer of the Tatura p.-0.-w. camp
during the war. From Ireland, he joined the
Permanent Forces in 1906 and in the 1914
war ccynmanded C Squadron of the 3rd Light
Horse and was brigade major of the Ist A.L.H.
Brigade.
In Auckland (M.L.), at 92, Dr. Thomas
Charles Moore, who practised his pro-
fessioii till a month ago and at 90 was able
to produce a medical certificate that gained
him a driver’s licence. Arriving in M.L. m
1885, he practised at Napier till the earthquake,
when he went to Taupo.
In Geelong, at 96, E. C. de Garis, pioneer
irrigationist who used the waters from the
Loddon River in 1883 through the first of the
State’s water-channels. He was one of the first,
to work under the Tragowel Plain scheme.
In Adelaide, at 90, Adolphus Pomroy, veteran
settler of the Murray Valley. He arrived at
Lyrup on the Murray 50 years ago to commence
the Kingston Government’s communal settle-
ment there. He was one of 400 passengers who
came to Australia on the Woodlark in 1879.
In Adelaide, at 60, Frank Smith, chairman of
directors of James Smith, Ltd., furnishing
emporium, and M.H.A. for Glenelg 1941 to
1947. Chairman of the State Traffic Committee,
he was twice Mayor of Glenelg.
In Melbourne, at 79, Henry Suetonius Officer,
Victorian and Darling River pastoralist. Born
on Murray Downs station, near Swan Hill, he
practised for a time at the Bar in Melbourne,
before he went on.the land. For many years
he managed Kallara, north of Wilcannia, and in
, 1920 purchased a property at Yea (Vic.).
In Adelaide, at 67, Reginald Robert Stuckey,
chairman of the State Bank Board, and former
Under-Treasurer in S.A. He spent many years
with the A.M.P. prior to becoming Public
Actuary in 1914, and had been Under-Treasurer
for 23 years when he retired in 1946. He assisted
in framing the Commonwealth and States finan-
cial agreement.
In Sydney, at 67, William St. Erney Parsons,
N.S.W. manager for Millar’s Timber and
Trading Co., and a prince of good fellows.
Death came to him as he sat in a Sydney
tram on his way to the office; and he hadn’t
been ill a day, A New Zealander by birth,
Parsons served Millar’s in Kalgoorlie and Mel-
bourne before he came to Sydney 20 years ago,
with the wide Pacific for his beat. He was
one of those rare men who do good by stealth
and have no cause to blush to find it fame,
because they never mention it.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus chose the
coldest night in winter to give their Ice
Age party at the Tivoli. Cold and numb
and murmuring against the lash of the
westerlies, the audience packed the theatre
to hear the Old Vic. Company preach
the gospel of the survival of the fittest.
Through flood, and Ice Age, and war, the
author, Thornton Wilder, led his family
group, and if some didn’t like the bizarre
wrapping of the writer’s philosophy there
wasn’t a dog-lover who didn’t appreciate
the touch of the door left a tiny bit ajar,
and the watching Mr. Antrobus, on thef
night of his return from the war, looking
at Mrs. Antrobus and saying “The dog is
dead?” and Mrs. Antrobus’s reply “The
dog died a long time ago.” Not any
woman there whose heart didn’t swell at
Mrs. Antrobus’s vain attempt to rub the
brand off little Cain’s forehead.
“Skin of Our Teeth” brought out a
great company of Sydney’s playwriters
and amateur actors. Mrs. G. Bell, who, as
Adele Quinn, was one of the delights of
Little Theatre groups, was there—her
pastel-toned satin frock covered by a coat
of rich dark fur; playwright Tomholt
was taking his third “skin”-grafting,
John Gould, who produces plays because
he-loves to, was in the front stalls. Miss
“Dot” Wentworth was there again ; so
was Mrs. James Dickson. Among the
heavily - furred audience were Mrs.
Cedric O’Gorman Hughes and her sister
Mrs. Wharton, Mrs. Ernest Watt, Maraa
Scfibling. Pianist Moura Lympany and
her husband Colonel Defres, Margaret
Gillespie and Rosemary Budge were other
first-nighters.
Pity nobody thought of installing Sir
Laurence and Lady Olivier in two throne
chairs at the party given in their honor
by the British Council last Friday. This
would have given a regal air and saved
Larry’s knee —the one he hurt in Richard
111. However, he stood smiling, taking
the count asi it were, while 300 of Syd-
ney’s drama-minded shook hands. Be-
side him was Lady Olivier, a small off-
the-face hat, soft with pink feather and
rose, a contrast to her dark frock and
furs.
The party really was to give Sydney a
chance to meet the members of the Old
Vic. Company. And they were all there
—Lady Sneerwell, Sir Benjamin Backbite,
Rowley, Mr. Joseph Surface (of the
“School”). Mr. Charles Surface (Terry
Morgan) was also there with his wife.
They have a flat right in the city and
think Sydney a dream place. Wardrobe-
mistress Mrs. Emma Selby-Walker’s
berry-red coat with its black lamb’s-
wool-lined hood held all Maoriland
autumn in it. Marie Donaldson’s
black suit and hat were trig. The D. D.
O’Connors were there, her slimness sleek
in beige frock and black millinery.
Film-producer Harry Watt was there,
and Hartley Power and June Clyde from
the present Royal show. June’s a pretty
creature, and she was all set off with
platina foxes and a kind of super-Aztec
feather headdress modelled into a toque.
Mayor Bartley and his bright-faced
Mayoress were there ; and the good-look-
ing Frank Crane couple from the Town
Hall, the Eric Wahlquists, knight Ben
Fuller and his lady and Public Librarian
Metcalfe and his wife?
People on the city side of the
Bridge almost elbowed North Shore-
liners out of their own camellia show
last week. The reason of the great rush
of cars to KiUara was the presence of
Vivien Leigh, who was making the open-
ing speech. Killaraites who strolled
around to the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall
at two o’clock found the queues already
formed, though opening hour was three.
When Lady Olivier’s car did arrive there
was a sudden surge towards it, but there
were policemen inside and outside the
hall, and Vivien’s rich fur coat didn’t
have one of its dark hairs disturbed ; her
tiny shell-pink hat listed neither to port
nor starboard. Lady Olivier, who was
welcomed by the Mayor, Alderman
Brown, said camellias were among her
favorite flowers. The hall was arranged
as nearly as possible to a camellia grove,
and the Kuringai Horticultural Society
had made a glorious display of the cream
and pink and red beauties. Food for
Britain benefits.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite breaks
into loud speech over the Royalties and
near-Royalties in “Richard III.” “What a
crew they were from a medical point of
view in the King’s bedchamber scene!
Edward obviously an advanced cardiac
case, Queen Margaret cursing one and all
in a burst of high blood-pressure,
Edward’s Queen a plain case of fear
neurosis, and Richard himself the victim
of such complexes that not even a whole
school of free-formulary psychoanalysts
could have cured him. A pretty exhibi-
tion they all made of themselves! Then
take the case of Buckingham—probably
the pioneer of the Public Relations busi-
ness, and a failure at it. And poor old
Clarence, think what a few lessons in jiu-
jitsu would have meant in his young
life.” The Girl sat in the stalls brooding
sorrowfully over these things. However,
she found one bridge between modern
nights and the dark ages. That was the
absence of lighting in the Tower.
Lookers-on felt as much at home in that
scene as if they were in their own E.L.
restricted flats.
At Holy Trinity Church, Brompton,
last week Eileen Phipps, niece of the
Duchess of Gloucester and lady-in-
waiting to H.R.H. during the Glou-
cester’ stay in Australia, became the wife
of Philip Parbury, who is director and
manager of Lysaght’s works at Port
Kembla. The Duke and Duchess attended
the wedding, and little Prince William
of Gloucester carried the train of the
long, ivory-satin wedding frock. The
bride’s parents are Mr. C. B. H. Phipps
and Lady Sybil Phipps, of Chalcot, West-
bury, Wilts, England.
Eva Carmel Kelly, a very young
member of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, returned to her home town,
Goulburn, last Saturday to give a violin
recital. With the rest of Australia, old
friends and neighbors have often heard
this gifted girl broadcasting in studio
recitals and in Young Australia sessions.
The concert will be at the Liedertafel
Hall, Goulburn, tonight. Associated
with the violinist will be pianist Marion
Graham Smith and baritone John
Cameron. Norton Trevaire photo.
For a few hours one night last week
the Trocadero became a bit of America.
U.S.A. residents in Sydney were celebrat-
ing the Glorious Fourth, and the big ball-
room was decked out in the Stars and
Stripes. The flag that, with our own,
flew so proudly in the Coral Sea Battle
dominated the flower decorations,
U.S. Acting-Charge d’Affaires Orsen
Nielsen and Mrs. Nielsen arrived at the
Trocadero after having seen Olivier’s
presentation of Richard 111 at the Tivoli.
Official host of the evening was chair-
man of the ball committee C. M. Van
Epps. With Mrs, Van Epps he enter-
tained a party that included Sydney’s
Lord Mayor and his wife.
French violinist Ginette Neveu was
given happy welcome to Sydney by mem-
bers of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
Committee. The afternoon party (no tea,
no coffee, but lots of drinks) brought
guests from as far away as Canberra.
Orchids, too, appeared in the drawing-
room of th 6 Royal Empire Society.
There was a bowl massed with them
from Mrs. Robert Dixson, and Ginette,
who wore a finely-pleated frock of daffo-
dil marocain, was presented with a spray
of them grown by Mrs, Rupert Scam-
mell in her own garden: “From one
violinist to another.”
Marjorie Charteris, of French’s Forest,
also brought flower offerings. Low
temperatures or not, her posy included
Christmas bells. The Frederick Jordan
lady and Mrs. Hope Gibson received the
guests, among whom was visiting pianist
Moura Lympany, whose large picture-
hat of black velvet was among things
admired. Blue, soft and misty, was worn
in both afternoon frock and little round
off-the-face hat by Mrs. Charles Lloyd
Jones. A blue hat, very designing and
attractive, was worn by Mrs. A. E.
Macartney.
On the afternoon of July 20 an exhibi-
tion of the paintings of overseas artist
Reshid Bey will be opened in the Gros-
venor Galleries in George-street. On the
afternoon before the opening Mrs. Gwen
Morton Spencer will be acting-hostess
for Reshid Bey’s in-law, Mrs. Gordon
Chirnside, at a cocktail party in the Aus-
tralia at which Sydney friends will meet
the artist.
Don’t forget the joint recital on Satur-
day night by Welsh baritone Hubert
Evans and pianist Pat Siedle under the
auspices of the Cymmrodorion Society.
Place: 1.0.0. F. Building, 100 Clarence-
street. Time 8 p.m. For tickets ring B.
Elystan Price (JA 7856) or hon. secretary,
Miss Katie Jones, LM 4100.
Journalists go gay at the Wentworth
on July 24. Feature of the yearly dance
will be a pretty-ankle competition.
From Melbourne
St. Kilda Town Hall was transformed
into New York’s famous Central Park
for the American ball to celebrate the
Glorious Fourth. Entering the foyer,
guests were transported into Central
Park Zoo, with possums hanging from
trees and foxes and other animals
grouped around trees, bushes and
greenery. The real Anglo-Saxon touch
was supplied by the Shakspeare garden,
in which the official party sat. A crazy-
pavement was surrounded with tradi-
tional English flowers, and from a spot
near the charming little bridge a bust of
England’s greatest poet gazed benignly at
the dancers. The adjoining ballroom was
arranged to represent the Pierre Hotel
ballroom, which overlooks Central Park.
The Tavern on the Green, complete with
merry-go-round, Punch-and-Judy show,
elephant slide and a “tavern” serving
doughnuts and coffee, was a prominent
feature.
The colorful background enhanced the
lovely frocking. The gown worn by Mrs.
Harold Rabling, president of the Ameri-
can Women’s Auxiliary, was brought
back by her from America. Of white
crepe romaine, the bodice was em-
broidered with diamente and crystal
beads; the skirt was slim-fitting and
draped in folds across, the front. Mrs.
R. G. Casey wore an attractive black
crepe ensemble. Lady Latham, president
of the Children’s Hospital Auxiliaries,
chose a black gown and fitting coat of
velvet. American Consul - General
Samuel Fletcher and his wife and Col.
H. B. Hester and his wife headed the
American colony. The wife of Col.
Ralph Michaelis, U.S. Army Air Force
Attache, wore a beautiful white satin em-
broidered Mandarin coat. The old-rose
satin gown worn by Mrs. Stephen Jurika,
wife of the U.S. Naval Attache, had a
full swinging skirt and the new shawl
drape at the low neckline. Ticket secre-
tary Mrs. H. Q. Hillman draped white
camellias across her low-cut red taffeta
bodice, which was worn with a full black
taffeta skirt. Mrs. Tom Blarney, also a
ticket secretary, wore a peony crepe
gown under a turquoise-blue, gold-em-
broidered jacket. Mrs. Alan Newton’s
Pierre Balmain model gown was of black
chiffon over pastel-pink taffeta and fea-
tured the new ankle-length skirt. Mrs.
Tim Jones favored pink and silver lame ;
Mrs. Des Kennedy’s lime-green chiffon
gown was splashed with black leaves.
Mrs. Boris Koski’s gown of black crepe
had a heavily gold-sequined yoke and a
draped skirt. Mrs. Syd Holland’s royal-
blue crepe gown was patterned in green
and grey; Mrs. Alan Southern’s winter-
white moire taffeta gown featured an off-
the-shoulder bodice and very bouffant
skirt, Mrs. John Southern’s peacock-blue
gown had gold embroideries on the full
skirt and bodice.
Officially launched by the Acting-Lord
Mayor, knight Thomas Nettlefold, at the
Town Hall, the Miss Australia quest of
1948 is in full swing. Present at the
launching were many country candidates ;
they came from Ballarat, Geelong,
Bendigo and Beaufort. A metropolitan
candidate, still young but with a career
of interest, is Margaret Woolford. She
was production secretary and continuity
writer for the “Blue Lagoon” film when
the company was on location in Fiji.
Previously she was a philosophy student
at the Brisbane Uni., and also holds a
pilot’s licence with 33 hours’ flying to
her credit. The Opportunity Clubs are
sponsoring her in the quest. Sir Robert
Knox, chairman of the Victorian divi-
sion of the Red Cross, was at the open-
ing with Lady Knox. Col. A. Spowers
and his wife, chairman of Red Cross
appeals W. H. McKechnie and Mrs. Mc-
Kechnie and Lady Angliss were also on
hand. Later in the week the Victorian
Institute of Advertising held a luncheon
at the Victoria Banquet Room to intro-
duce their candidates. Miss Retail Ad-
vertising and Miss Outdoor Advertising,
to members of the institute.
Green led the fashion field at Fleming-
ton for the second of the Grand National
meetings, with London tan and all shades
of brown closely following. Hats were
varied; sporty felts, mostly with quills
for trimming, crownless turbans of paisley
silk and, of course, flower- and feather-
bedecked hats were all popular. Attract-
ing much attention was the girl whose
outfit of scarlet wool coat and hood
bordered with white fur, all in Father
Christmas mood, was climatically sound
but seasonally astray, Mrs. W. L. Russell
Clarke chose a bottle-green wool en-
semble and small black hat trimmed with
black satin ribbon and chenille-dotted
veiling. Mrs. Sam Wood’s angora suit
was in caramel tonings ; the coat had a
narrow basque. Mrs. Fred Gilder wore a
green jersey with her fawn tweed suit;
her small turban was of matching green
jersey. Vivienne Betty Stephens wore a
double-breasted brown and yellow her-
ringbone-tweed coat and brown two-
quilled felt hat. Mrs. O. J. Nelson’s
grass-green coat had a collar of brown
fox. Brown musquash trimmed the collar
of Rhonda Lane’s olive-green coat; her
small green hat flew brown satin ribbon.
Mrs. M. Johnson’s coat was pale mignon-
ette green; her small green hat was
winged with elongated pheasant-feather.
Tailored tan suit and matching hat
were Miranda Casey’s choice. Pen-
elope Giles lent contrast to her tan jacket
with a fully-flared black skirt,
Jennifer Chirnside’s hat with its scarf
drapery made neat alliance with her
tailored suit, A striking hand-woven
Scotch tweed jacket-suit and fully-swing-
ing matching coat in a small check pat-
tern of soft grey and beige combined with
grey hat and red bag to earn fashion
laurels for the day for Alice Adcock.
Mrs. David Knox’s gtey tailoreds had
London-tan accessories. Brown and green
tweeds, with the same tones repeated in
the hat, gave a late-autumn touch to Mrs.
Judith Scott’s outfit. Mrs. lan Macfarlan
wore a mink coat over her brown frock;
her small beret was of brown corduroy-
velvet, Mrs. T. Alan x McKay’s brown
ermine coat was worn with a green hht
trimmed with blue taffeta ribbon and
pastel-pink and blue feather flowers. Ivy
Parker matched the dark-green velvet
collar on her soft beige wool suit with
her hat, which was trimmed with brown
quills. Mrs. Sam Wells was in black ;
the coat featuring a deep mink collar ;
black coq feathers were on her black hat.
Mrs. Jim Buchanan’s navy suit was
topped with a side-draped hat of teal-
blue. Mrs. Len Voss Smith wore a brown
beaver coat over her navy suit; tartan
ribbon trimmed her navy hat, A brown
angora coat covered Mrs. T. H. Jones’s
green frock ; her brown hat had matching
coq feathers.
This photo, of Mrs. J. E. Shilliday,
taken on the lawn at Flemington during
the G.N. meeting, seems to augur ill for
the bookies. A busy and energetic
worker for a host of charitable organisa-
tions, she was appointed organiser of the
Box Hill District Gymkhana Committee,
which, during a period of five years and
some months, raised £6OOO clear profit
for war funds. She has also raised many
thousands for the Totally and Perman-
ently Incapacitated Ex-servicemen. For
relaxation Mrs. Shilliday works in her
garden, and has twice won an important
prize in a horticultural contest. With
Dr. Shilliday and daughter Wanda she
is going to Perth, where her husband
will attend the B.M.A. conference*
On the way back they will stay in
Adelaide for the Show, at which
Wanda will ride in the ring events. Mrs.
Shilliday was herself a prominent rider at
shows.
Mrs. L. P. Coleman wore a beige, satin
ballerina frock and short matching jacket
when she was guest-of-honor at a birth-
day buffet dinner-party given by Mr. and
Mrs. Ray Joseph at their home, Mont-
rose, Brighton-road. The hostess’s bal-
lerina frock of penny-brown moire taf-
feta had a fully-pleated skirt and rosettes
of coffee-tinted lace trimming the neck-
line of the short-sleeved bodice. Among
the guests were Mr, and Mrs. Royden
Honeyman, she in a black frock high-
lighted with a sash of gold-splashed
taffeta ribbon ; Mr. and Mrs. C. Curtain,
the latter smart in black frock, silver-
fox cape and small black-coq-feather-
trimmed hat; Diana Silk, just back from
America, in black frock with jet bead,
embroideries ; and Moira Shelton, whose
ice-blue crepe frock was worn under a
short cyclamen velvet coat.

Latest accounts contain some unusual
items, interlined in the table, A
good season and exceptional prices for
wool and stock —a rare combination —
enabled the co. to collect £77,904 arrears
of interest which had been struck off as
irrecoverable. The 5 p.c. premium, plus
exchange, on repayment of the old
sterling debenture debt (£1,407,549) was
charged against general reserves, down
£463,960 —£800,000 of fresh share money
was gathered at par to help pay the
capital sum involved. A total of £11,470
was paid for goodwill (not treated as an
asset herein) of four stock- and wool-
broking businesses bought during the year
at unstated figures—Fenwick and Cos.
(Brisbane), Reg Thompson (Moree),
Crossing and Cox (Mudgee), Mathieson,
Chester and Davis (Melbourne). And a
special contribution of £20,000 was made
to the staff fund in addition to the normal
grant (£16,315).
There was a leap of over 40 p.c. in turn-
over (£29,500,000, up £8,500,000), thanks
mainly to record prices for wool and live-
stock. An extra 27,327 bales wool were
put under the hammer:

With prices still rising, average per bale
for 10 months to April 30 was 56.6 p.c.

Record numbers of sheep (4,150,000),
cattle (280,000) and pigs (110,000)
were also auctioned at high and
rising prices. Further, commission
on land sales (£2,250,000) and bigger
merchandise turnover helped to swell
earnings, and so did returns from
the co.’s own properties in the west of
N. S. Wales and Queensland, where the
blowfly has become very troublesome.

Exes, (up £2j6,077) took 77.9 p.c. of gross
as against 78.6 p.c. for the previous year
and 74.4 p.c. in 1939. After pay-
ing debenture interest and making the
usual grant to the staff fund, the net
result was £74,525 stronger at £241,967,
or 7.5 p.c. on capital as it now stands
(£3,200,000). A 2 p.c. bonus was added
to the 6 p.c. div. on the old shares
(£2,400,000), making 8 p.c. for the year,
and a div. and bonus together totalling
2f p.c, was paid on the new issue
(£800,000). The 2 p.c. was labelled bonus
because “lengthy continuance of profits
on the scale achieved this year cannot
be relied upon.”
Interest on the debentures (they were
a reminder of the 1890’s), plus exchange,
was costing the co. £76,848 p.a., whereas
8 p.c. on the new capital calls for £64,000 ;
so there is a definite saving there. On
capital as it now stands 8 p.c. will call for
£256,000, or £47,234 less than was netted
last term. But nobody can say definitely
how long earnings will continue at or
around last year’s level. They were the
product of a good season, strong demand
and prompt clearances at record prices.
In addition to their immediate needs,
overseas buyers were doubtless influenced
by rising costs and the probability of ex-
change adjustments later on. At the
moment there is no sign of a serious
break in either demand or prices, and an-
other good season is in prospect.
Marshall aid promises to be a prop to
European buying, and the appearance of
Russia and probable early entry of Japan
into the market are other encouraging
factors. Mounting costs, high taxation
and scarcity of labor and materials are
the ugly ducklings.
Despite repayment of debentures —
£8603 remained to be collected when the
books closed—liquids were £31,714
stronger than at the previous balance:

Assets totalling £132,860 belonging to
shareholders have been transferred to a
new General department, thus separating
them from the two life sections in which
assets total £3,355,237 and policyholders
are the chief participants. The £132,860
is made up of property, etc., £49,780,
Government securities £30,000, shares in
subsidiary £43,907 (up £21,529), shares in
other cos., cash, etc., £9173. Including
provision for taxation, outside liabilities
amount to £4103, leaving £128,757 to
represent the £50,000 of share capital.
The underwriting business of the sub-
sidiary, Metropolitan Accident Fire and
General Cos, (paid capital £29,340), has
been transferred to the new section fol-
lowing purchase of the balance of that
co.’s shares. Income of the new section
was £26,672, of which claims and exes,
took £16,869 and £2326 was reserved for
unexpired risks, leaving £7479, of which
£IQO was written off intangibles, £lB was
paid in divs. and £7459 carried forward.
Under existing conditions the subsidiary
looks like becoming a handy contributor
to the shareholders’ pool.
The co.’s principal business is life
assurance, and has been for the last 53
years. It writes ordinary and industrial
contracts throughout the three eastern
States and South Australia, pays regular
bonuses to policyholders, and latest ac-
counts disclose continued progress and a
sound financial structure. Last term
£1,300,245 (down £12,469) of new busi-
ness was put on the books —£524,463
(down £22,570) ordinary and £775,782
(up £10,101) industrial. Still, ordinary
contracts, under which £9 has to be
earned for policyholders before share-
holders are entitled to a pound, accounted
for over 40 p.c. of last year’s new busi-
ness as against 25.3 p.c. in 1941.
Income of the two life departments
combined was £602,277 (up £31,381), of
which £485,104 (up £30,759) was
premiums and £117,173 (up £622) in-
terest, etc. After paying all legitimate
claims and exes., sending £1626 to the
staff fund, allowing £494 for deprecia-
tion and handing £4982 to shareholders,
£220,017 was added to the assurance
funds, raising them to £3,282,393, which
more than covers actuarial liabilities
under policies. In addition there is
£21,543 of other reserves, making a total
of £3,303,936 belonging to policyholders.
Valuation of policy liabilities and
declaration of bonuses to policyholders
are published triennially. Surpluses avail-
able for distribution (excess of assurance
funds over policy liabilities) since 1937
have been as follows:
Ordinary. Industrial. Total.
1937 .. £36,910 £13,242 £48,669
1940 .. 33,597 15,071 48,668
1943 .. 23,317 16,609 39,926
1946 . . 27,680 25,661 53,341
The figures reflect the effects of cheap
money and inflation, which have also
affected bonus rates —a common experi-
ence. Last declared bonuses in the O.D.
ranged from 16s. p.c. on contracts less
than five years in force to 245. p.c. on
those 15 years old or more. In the I.D.
increments on sums assured ranged from
5 p.c. for five- to nine-year-old policies to
10 p.c. for 15-year-old contracts, plus 1
p.c. for each additional year. Thus a
claim under a 20-year-old policy would
be increased by 20 p.c, of the sum
assured.
Net interest earned on mean assurance
funds last term was 3.67 p.c. Policy
liabilities are calculated on a2\ p.c. basis
O.D. and 2\ p.c. I.D. The margin be-
tween the actual and assumed rates is
sufficient to ensure maintenance of pre-
sent reversionary bonus rates. Excluding
depreciation and divs. to shareholders and
contributions to the staff fund, exes, took
14.8 p.c. of total income in the O.D. and
27.4 p.c, in the I.D.
Assets are a satisfactory lot:

Outstanding feature last term was the
growth of £258,649 in shareholdings.
This spread of life funds into industry in
search of more adequate income is
another consequence of the Government’s
cheap-money policy.

In relation to capital employed, this is
the best result for many years, and the
earning rate of 9.5 p.c. would give the
slightly increased dividend a cosy appear-
ance but for the fact that some of White-
field’s present sources of revenue can’t
be expected to recur indefinitely. The
co. is, in fact, undergoing an interesting
evolution. Formed in 1923 with the pur-
pose of discounting mortgages to aid
home purchases, it paid ordinary divs.
averaging nearly 18 p.c. until the 1930
slump. Then came a series of legislative
rebuffs—the Moratorium Act, the Interest
Reduction Act, special taxes on property-
incomes and finally limitation of
mortgage interest rates (the present maxi-
mum is 4} p.c.).
The lastnamed measure was introduced
in war-time, when an abundance of
money was enabling clients to discharge
their mortgages rapidly, leaving the co. no
alternative outlet for the funds except
Government loans returning about 3£
p.c.. The board used some of the cash to
retire the pref. capital, about half of it
being replaced by 4 p.c. debentures which
will mature in 1954.
Repayment of old mortgages has con-
tinued since the war to outstrip the
board’s ability to reinvest in new ones,
and the funds have had to be channelled
into co. shares —which increased by
£35,789 last term, including £6550 made
available to the subsidiary to buy a

The £37,947 fall in mortgages is not en-
tirely a result of ordinary repayments but
also of the sale of 34 properties of which
Whitefield had taken possession during
the slump. This compares with 48 such
properties sold in the previous term;
about 148 still remain for disposal.
Sales of these possessed properties are
allowing the co. to recoup “substantial”
interest arrears, but the amounts aren’t
published by the board, which treats the
arrears as current income. Last term’s
mortgage collections represented 10.5 p.c.
on mean holdings as shown in the
balance-sheet —more than twice the
statutory interest rate:

Tax 6,224 6,269 5,012
Net profit claimed .. £11,740 £11,571 £11,197
This high apparent rate of earnings may
partly result from conservative book-
values of mortgages; in this regard it is
interesting to note that dividends (not in-
cluding the subsidiary) were no less than
9.3 p.c. on mean shareholdings, or 6.6
p.c. on the values shown at the close of
the term. The return on mean bond-
holdings was 3.3 p.c.
How much arrears remain to be picked
up from possessed properties isn’t dis-
closed. When these have all been sold,
profits may fall sharply ; and with present
interest controls and competition in the
realm of home-finance from banks and
other institutions, the outlook for mort-
gagees like this co. seems rather limited.
But if disposal of the properties at last
year’s rate allows a similar strengthening
of reserves for the next four or five terms,
the co.’s financial position will have been
considerably improved. Already the £1
ords. have net tangible cover of 235. sd.
each, and the current price of 225. 6d.
offers a yield of 4.9 p.c. on the basis of
the 5} p.c. dividend.
William Adams and Co.’s new issue of
150,000 14s. ords., two £or seven (B.
7/*7/’4B), is being made at a premium of
12s. each, and has been underwritten by
A. W. Harvey, Lowe and Cos. The rights
were recently quoted ss. 7d., making total
cost to the purchaser, including broker-
age, 31s. 10d., at which figure the return
is 4.4 p.c. on a 10.1 p.c. djv. basis.

redeemable June, 1959, and
2,800,000 ords. of 2s. 6d. each.
The amount of the premium, de-
cided by the Capital Issues
Board, disappointed the market,
and the price of the ords,
dropped from 12s. 9d. in April
to 10s. 9d. last week-end. In-
cluding brokerage, and after
exercising the rights, the net
price at 10s. 9d. is 10s. 4d.,
making thei rights worth about
3s. The new money is wanted
to help ■ pay for more diesel
shovels, better drilling equip-
ment and crushing stations, etc.
The ords. have gone hungry
since 1942, mainly because sur-
plus earnings were used to pay
for capital equipment in order
to keep costs within controllable
limits. Profit claimed for the
year to end June, 1947, was
£101,035 (up £65,361). That was
enough to cover the pref. div.
and show 22.8 p.c. on £350,000
of ord, capital. Practically all
reserve ore (treated at No. 1
mill) now lies below No. 5 bench
(old 574ft. level), which means
that the co. is getting into re-
serves of the copper pre-body to
the west of the andesite dyke.
The value of mill-feed (2.49dwt.
gold and 0.59 p.c. copper in
June) should continue to im-
prove. There is at least 5,743,477
tons ore, averaging 4.08dwt.

of the mill.

When. Sister Sue found her tube of Napro Hair
Vitalizer squeezed dry, she just took one look at brother
Bob’s lustrous, healthy hair and picked the culprit.
For Bob, like many other men, had found that Napro
Hair Vitalizer gave him a healthy scalp, removed
dandruff and made his hair elastic and vigorous. But
he’s got no excuse for "borrowing” it again, because
now there is a special Napro Hair Vitalizer for men
that has all the qualities of the original product and,
at the same time, keeps the hair perfectly groomed
without "plastering.” So just slip into any good chemist

SUNDRY SHOWS
"Skin of Our Teeth."
Thornton Wilder’s “Skin of
Our Teeth,” which the Old Vic.
Company is currently present-
ing to Sydney, is agreeably
amusing and, despite its mild
surrealism, simple enough to be
easily digested by anyone over
the mental age of 12.
Its “message” is delivered in
three scenes. The first is a con-
temporary American home of
which Mr. Antrobus is lord and
master. He has just invented
the wheel, the alphabet and the
multiplication table; outside
another Ice Age threatens civi-
lisation ; inside a dinosaur and
mammoth warm themselves by
the fire; Homer, Moses and
others seek shelter with them ;
Mrs. Antrobus is tortured by
the memory of her son, who was
killed by his brother Henry,
originally called Cain. The scene
concludes with Sabina, the maid,
calling upon the audience for
fuel to keep the fire going:
“Pass up your chairs, everybody.
Save the human race.” And, of
course, it is saved.
The second scene presents a
similar escape from another
disaster —flood. Mr. Antrobus
has just been elected president
of the Ancient and Honorable
Order of Mammals', Subdivision
Humans, at its six-hundred-
thousandth annual convention.
He falls for Sabina, a bathing
beauty this time, and is about
to break up his home when the
deluge arrives. Mr. Antrobus
gets his family, Sabina and two
of every kind of animal aboard
a boat, and mankind scrapes
through again.
The final scene is the Antro-
bus home again after mankind
has just survived another war,
and concludes with Sabina
telling the audience:
This is where you came in. We
have to go on for ages and ages yet.
You go home. The end of the play
isn’t written yet. Mr. and Mrs.
Antrobus! Their heads are full of
plans and they’re as confident as the
first day they began—and they told
me to tell you good-night.
There is nothing particularly
new about Wilder’s play. His
method of concealing his needles
of thought in a haystack of sym-
bolism is remarkably similar to
that used by Strindberg in “The
Dream Play”—excellently pro-
duced in Sydney a, while ago by
Dr. Raoul Cardamatis —even if
his philosophy and humor are
almost directly opposed to that
of the gloomy Norwegian. His
“message”—that man is for ever
escaping disaster and slowly but
steadily creeping upwards—is
also an old one, but, being essen-
daily opdmisdc, it will bear any
amount of repeating, particularly
in such a cheery, good-humored
fashion.
The Old Vic. company’s pro-
duction is as sure as the human
progress it depicts, and the con-
fusion—of bits of scenery
toppling over or flying up into
the lofts, of characters refusing
to go on with the play and con-
fiding in the audience, of the
THE OLD VIC.

Cushing in “School for Scandal," at Sydney Tiv.
whole proceedings stopping for
the rehearsal of a scene while
the audience is invited to go out
for a smoke or to talk “not too
loudly” —is smoothly and de-
lightfully confounded. The
actors prove what they have
already demonstrated in “School
for Scandal” and “Richard III”
—Olivier, that he is a tremen-
dously studied actor with a re-
markable voice ; Vivien Leigh,
that she is a competent actress
comfortably established on the
dramatic foothills; and the rest
of the cast, particularly Eileen
Beldon and George Relph, that
they are a very able and ad- 1
mirablv-disciolined company.

Most of the old Olivier-
Vivien Leigh films are being re-
vived in Sydney to cash-in on
the Old Vic. Company’s visit,
and there is almost a surfeit of
new shows around town. Note-
worthy offerings—to be re-
viewed when space permits: —in-
clude French violinist, Ginette
Neveu; a light, bright comedy,
“John Loves Mary,” at Sydney
Royal; and the films “Les En-
fants du Paradis” (Variety),
“The Fugitive” (Savoy), “Spot-
light on Australian Ballet” and
“Letter from an Unknown
Woman” (State).
Margaret Olley.
On the evidence of oils and
drawings on view at the Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney, it is
difficult to determine just what
Margaret Olley, the artist, is up
to. There is, for instance, the
large “Ophelia,” with depressing
quantities of chalky-white paint,
crowded figures and a kind of
deliberate careless confusion of
composition. There are figures',
white-gowned and nude, Ophelia
being dragged out of a small
stream and the background leap-
ing into the foreground ; warm
flesh tones and a sculptured
solidity in the human figures
and, even admitting the device
of no perspective, oddly superflu-
ous figures in the right-hand
corner.
Of the still-lifes, “Pink Paper
and Kippers” may be taken as
» aam P le and P? ttern - »is a
large painting with a good deal
of space devoted to pink paper
and kippers. A small red and
rather unpleasant nude and
“Sad Clown,” a drawing in
which the face is a grotesque
mask, are typical of another
phase of Margaret Olley’s art.
The Victorian National Gal-
lery has bought two studies of
old houses, “Hill End Ruin,”
with a quantity of ruinous red
paint and walls flaking away like
cardboard, and “Kilmorey
Terrace,” a drawing with firm
black-and-white outlines, a clever
play of the pen on the iron lace
of the tiny balconies and a
minor cold grace and character,
“Breakfast Creek Hotel,” again,
is of the same genre, with a deal
of red paint and some massive
dignity of form. Certain land-
scapes have a kind of lowering
force which is often lost by ex-
cess, as it were, when skies are
given a greenish, whipped phos-
phorescence which loses all con-
tact with reality and, perhaps,
with form.
Still, it is Margaret Olley’s
landscapes which are convinc-
ing, not on account- of their
realism but by virtue of the
strength that may be sensed in
them. “Grey Day” has a sky
which is sullen and tormented
and, strictly speaking, not a sky
at all but a mass of heavy paint
brooding over slums in the fore-
ground, a winding reach of har-
bor and a knob of land glower-
ing in a darkling light. In this
picture, and in other
paintings, there is
promise and evi-
dence of a power-
ful talent. But it is
not enough for the
spectator to sense
these things. Art is,
among other things,
a means of com-
munication, and if
the message is too
hampered by sym-
bols and over-
shadowed by ob-
scurity there is, in
time, no art —only
shadows and ob-
scurity.
The explanation
probably lies in the
fact that Margaret
Olley is a young
artist, and that her
talent has not yet
found a clear and
well-defined method
of expression. Speak-
ing generally, there
is a tendency for all young
artists, in all forms of art, to
become intoxicated by experi-
ment and to see, through intense
application to some form of their
work, a powerful and inevitable
clarity in symbols. The value of
this process lies in the experi-
ment. The danger, in a time of
tumbling values, is in the fact
that symbols may be hailed as
the fact itself, as art, and ac-
cepted by the artist as such. At
this stage of Margaret Olley’s
development it is impossible to
say more than that she has
talent which may develop. But
there is more possibility of that
consummation within the disci-
pline of the traditional forms of
landscape-painting than in the
forms which she is now practis-
ing.

PATTERSON
Champion Cyclist!
Sid. Patterson, 20 year old Victorian
cyclist, is Australia’s best Olympic prospect since
Duncan Gray, and may emulate that great rider’s
effort of winning the strenuous Olympic time trial
an unpaced dash against the clock over 1000
metres.
Patterson’s best time to date is 1 min. 14.2/5 sec.,
on an asphalt track. The Olympic event will be
run on a similar surface at London. World’s
record is 1.12, made on a lightning fast board
saucer at Berlin Games, 1936, by Van Vliet
(Holland).

i ear FOUNDATION OF HAIG
Lieut. John Oxley and his party anchored in Moreton Bay
and later, on December 2nd, 1823, entered the Brisbane River.
Convinced that a town should be established on its
banks, his recommendation led to a penal settlement
late in 1824. The first camps at Redcliffe Point,
proving unsuitable,- were moved to the present site
. of Brisbane, a choice that has been applauded by
later generations.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Over the shorter trips of the general
run of jumping events during the
season, Tente, under crushing weights,
has consistently run fair races with-
out winning, but, put to the true
test of the Grand National distance
(25f.) at Flemington on Saturday, the
old fellow came into his own.
By,the time the field entered the
straight for the final run down to the
judge, the vast majority of punters
had lost all interest in proceedings—
financial interest, that is to say.
Favorite Benarca had fallen; of three
equal second favorites The Feline and
David Star had come to grief, while
Eudunda had broken down with half
a mile to go; third favorite Bronze
Laddie was down and also Parentena,
Eudunda pulling up left Tente in
front, and, jumping generously, he
battled it out to beat Wangaratta
and Nantilla in a finish of which the
handicapper must have been proud.
Tente carried 10.13, the other pair
11b. less and the winning margins
were a half-length and three parts
of a length.
Tente, who started at 25’ to 1,
is an 11-year-old gelding by Devon-
shire from Tente Encore; is owned
and trained by G. Bewsher and
was ridden by K. Denham. It
was his fourth attempt at the
National, his previous best being a
second to High Flash in 1946, while
in 1945 he won the Australian Steeple-
chase.
Success of Cheery Boy, warm
favorite for the Footscray Steeple, was
the one bright spot in a grim day for
punters. Glenriven, winning the
Doutta Galla Hurdle, was, at 10
to 1, not an absolute rough ’un, but
half a dozen others were preferred
in the betting, including Lugano and
John Masefield, who filled the places.
With just short of two score horses
pelting down the six-furlongs course,
the Lawn Handicap was one of those
things best left alone. Possibly con-
fusing him as an entry for one of
the jumping races, the handicapper
gave Attley 10.3, despite which he
started favorite and because of which
he failed. Daverarch (A. Burton)
was a clear-cut winner from Gilwell,
Sentiment and Nilam, almost in line
for the minor money.
Coming from well back in the
field in the Two-year-old Mile, Bon
Dhoti (P. Simonds) downed Raysun
by a bare half-whisker with Kdlerton
a similar distance away third. Saxoman
(W. A. Smith) wound up a cheerless
day when he started at 33 to 1 for
the 12-furlongs Winter Handicap and
proved six-lengths too good for the
well-backed pair Royal Scot and
Rimfire.
* * * *
In the attempt to bag some of the
abundant prizemoney offered at the
Doomben meeting, concluded on
Saturday, some southern owners even
arranged for supplies of their home-
town fodder and water to be flown
up to their nags, but all measures
availed them nought. As in the
£lO,OOO sprint the previous week, local
gallopers fought out the finish of
Saturday’s Doomben Cup (11 fur-
longs less 93 yards).
Winner of the Cup. from go to
whoa was the threeryear-old Hebrus
gelding Forge, carrying 7.5 and ridden
by Frank Cook, a rider who almost
gave the game away after suffering
a very bad smash-up at Toowoomba
some years back. Jean Buzzard was
second; the Melbourne pair Clatter-
bag and Rio Fe took third and fourth
money.
* * * *
Main item of interest at Canter-
bury on Saturday was the Canterbury
Park Handicap, in which the S.T.C.’s
new mobile starting barrier was used
for the first time. To mark the
occasion a trophy was added to the
prizemoney; the silverware plus the
brass went to connections of the
consistent old Emborough gelding
Homeleigh Dick (E. Doon), the easiest
of winners from Doughnut and
Codicil.
Pretty well all concerned were com-
pletely satisfied with the new barrier,
a large structure mounted on wheels
so that it is quickly and easily
trundled off the course immediately
the horses are sent on their way.
Each individual stall is fitted with a
pair of gates which, when closed,
meet together in the centre of the
front of the stall. When he has ’em
lined up the starter touches a button
with his foot, a bell rings, the gates
fly open outwards, and “They’re off!”
The only word heard against the
new stalls came from a rider reported
as “complaining’* that they prevent
the smart rider from gaining an
advantage by anticipating the start,
which seems a pretty fair argument
in their favor.
The grey Roxborough gelding
Denali further indicated that he is a
class above present winter company,
by leading all the way to a very easy
win from Rose Glory and Hava Chat
in the Flying. With 8.6 he was con-
ceding weight to all but the Derby
winner Prince Standard, and he
clocked 1.13$ for the six furlongs
—good going for this time of the
year, particularly at' Canterbury. In
winning .divisions of the Ashbury
Mixed Stakes over the same trip, both
the Beau Vite gelding Zipper (J.
Browne) and the three-year-old Agin-
court colt Cognac (W, Cook) took
1.155. Tartan Girl (A. Ward),
another by Roxborough, took 1.15$
in downing Landseer, Adorn and
other maiden two-year-old fillies.
Starting at sevens, Tartan Girl was
the longest-priced winner of the day,
an excellent day for punters. 1 Sea
Arrow (E. Fordyce), at 6 to 1, had
a comfortable victory over Blue
“We pay eighty quid for the key and she goes and
swallows it!”
Lagoon and Prenero in the Maiden
Two-year-old for colts and geldings.
Barita (W. Cook) was well backed
for his success in the Campsie Mixed
Stakes (Ilf.), though Beau Felt and
Hemisphere, who filled the places, had
been slightly preferred. Zipper, Denali
and Cognac were all favorites, as
was Set Purpose, downing High Order
and Blanmar in the Welter (9f.) to
give J. Thompson his customary win-
ner for the day.

Members of the athletics section
of the Australian Olympic team had
a pleasant little outing at the London
Athletic Club’s challenge meeting on
Saturday, winning eight individual
events and a couple of relay races.
When Treloar won the 100yds. from
his team mates Curotta and Bartram
two of the three watches read 10.2 sec.
—the other said 10.5, which was
accepted.

The cricketers:
In a drastic Witz on their XI
for the third Test, English selec-
tors dropped Hutton, Wright and
Coxon, replacing them with
Emmett, Pollard and Crapp.
Yardley won the toss' and elected to
bat, but the early dismissals of Wash-
brook (11) and Emmett (10)
diminished hopes which almost
vanished entirely when Compton
belted a no-ball fair to the centre
of his own forehead and retired for
repairs.
Edrich (32) and Crapp (37) held
the fort temporarily, but with six
down for 141 things looked grim.
Then Compton returned to play yet
another of his side-saving innings and
was 64 not out at stumps. Continu-
ing next day, Compton carried his bat
through to a total of 145 not out,
the tail-enders giving him grand sup-
port to bring the side’s total to 363.
Towards the end of the innings
Barnes, fielding in his usual perilous
position just beyond the end of the
bat, became the second, and far more
serious, casualty of the match when
Pollard swiped one into his ribs.
The Australians came in and soon
struck trouble. lan Johnson, pro-
moted to lend opener Morris a hand,
was soon out for one —first wicket
down for 3; Bradman went l.b.w,
for 7; Hassett looked well settled-in
but was out at 38 with the score
three for 82, Morris (48) and Miller
(23) weathered the storm to make it
three for 126 at stumps.
Then came Black Saturday; Miller
was finished at 31 and Morris at 51;
Barnes pluckily came on to score a
single before collapsing and being
carried off. The others raised the
total to 221. In- their second
innings, England started poorly
with Emmett out for a duck, but then
Washbrook and Edrich rattled up
123 before the latter was run out at
53. Comptou, too, went for a duck,
but he had surely done his bit. At
stumps on the third day Washbrook
(85) and Crapp (19) were together with
174 up for three wickets and Eng-
land 316 in front with seven wickets
in hand.

Fitzroy, the V.F.L. leaders, went
down to Geelong on Saturday and
ran into a storm of goals from the
Geelong star, White, which cost them
their place and altered the make-up
of “the four.” Beaten 13.9-9.17,
Fitzroy dropped to third place,
Collingwood went to the top, having
walloped North Melbourne by 19.13
to 10.11, Essendon beat Melbourne,
13.13-9.11, and went to second place,
while Melbourne dropped from the
four to let Richmond in after the
Tigers beat “Sowth,” 21.18-9.13.
Footscray beat the hopeless St. Kilda,
13; 13-7-11, and moved up to join
Melbourne just outside “the four,”
while Carlton, having beaten Haw-
thorn, 17.10-10.9, stayed' with Gee-
long, 20 points behind the leaders
and 10 points from “the four.”

Rugby Union: Randwick beat
Northern Suburbs 19-13 in a fast
game at Coogee Oval, Slattery scor-
ing a fine try for the winners. Gordon
beat Western Suburbs 16-3, St. George
and Eastern Suburbs drew 11-all,
Uni. tossed Parramatta 27-6, and
Drummoyne'pounded Eastwood 15-nil.
* * * *
Making his Melbourne debut, Syd-
ney lightweight Bernie Hall, who had
previously lost only two of his 32
fights, struck trouble jn the shape of
the local lad Billy Sinclair. Sinclair
landed a finisher in the seventh round.
* * * *
The meeting of welterweights Alfie
Sands (10.6) and Jackie de Belin at
Leichhardt savored something of
family revenge. Earlier in the week
at Sydney Stadiurh Clem Sands (10.5)
had k.o.’d Billy de Belin (10.6|) after
De Belin had easily won the preced-
ing rounds. At Leichhardt the other
De Belin evened matters, continually
getting in first with straight lefts to
win an unquestioned points decision.

Our Position in a Nutshell
The policy of “full employ-
ment” imposed upon the Austra-
lian people by the “Labor”
sophists at Canberra has been
given a fair trial and found to be
grievously wanting. Perhaps if
a Government capable of dis-
ciplining trade-union larrikinism
and dealing forcefully with Com-
munist sabotage and obstruction
were in power it would be a
rather different story, especially
if the grossly inflated Common-
wealth civil service were reduced
to reasonable proportions and
the surplus added to the volume
of productive labor available.
But as the “full-employment”
situation stands it has proved to
be an obstruction to the progress
of the country, a thing of poli-
tical expediency, trade-union
abuse and a weapon for Com-
munist destruction of industry.
It would seem already that
almost enough rope has been
given to the industrial anarchists
to hang themselves. Through
lack of coal apd essential ser-
vices—resulting entirely from
the refusal of certain trade-
unionists, usually Communist-
dominated, to do anything like
a fair thing in their, jobs—the
whole Australian community
finds its living and its standard
of living jeopardised. If we
approach this problem from the
economic end we find that it
leads directly to the political.
And in the political arena the
first blow against wilful under-
production, against industrial
sabotage, must be struck.,
The production position
that is, the inadequacy of pro-
duction per man-hour —is grow-
ing so fantastically incongruous
that tfie remedy is likely to come
partly from an almost automatic
reaction away from trade-union
paternalism, trade-unionism hav-
ing so clearly failed to accept
its responsibilities where con-
cededgreater political powers and
economic advantages. Perhaps
it has been frustrated in its more
honorable intentions by the
stranglehold of “militants” and
Communists. But under a system
of democracy rights and privi-
leges are always accompanied by
obligations. And one of the obli-
gations facing trade-unionism is
that it must put its self-govem-
mental machinery in order, even
to the point of perhaps enforcing
compulsory voting on major
union matters and a secret ballot.
If trade-unionism is slow to
accept its obligations to do a
fair day’s work for a fair day’s
pay—and on five days a week —
then the sooner it is exposed to
the results of its own betrayal of
industry the better. Price-control
was a measure introduced dur-
ing war-time to protect our
economy against the inflationary
effects of war-time finance and
industrial dislocation. It was
never designed to disguise the
effects of inadequate production
from an enlarged labor army in-
tent on taking out of the pro-
duction pool more than it put
into it.
And so we face the prospect
of State control of prices, the
elimination of some subsidies
and the wiping-out of some
price-controls altogether. Inevit-
ably there will be rises in a
variety of prices and costs, with
higher cost - of - living - based
wages. The amount of, subsidy
now paid on some things, such
as felt hats and leather foot-
wear, is substantial; and there
are overall subsidies, such as
those affecting coal and freights,
which will have a general effect
on all costs if 'they are removed.
The States will be handed their
responsibilities with the way to
decontrol badly prepared by the
Canberra Socialist Administra-
tion, which had hoped, through
the problems created by under-
production and overissue of
money, to have an excuse for the
perpetuation of price and other
controls and the continuation of
confiscatory and enterprise-
destroying taxation. It had
visions of an all-powerful
Federal Socialist Government.
So far there has been no check
to the “Labor” process of pro-
ducing less for more money.
But perhaps we have reached
bedrock in this insane sort of
“progress.” The 40-hour week
became law from the beginning
of 1948, and already it has given
a derisive denial to its sponsors’
hopes. Wages continue to rise
and other costs correspondingly.
Output per man-hour has fallen
since January this year in most
industries, and devastatingly on
the coalfields.
The “national income” for
1947-48 is reckoned to be 24 p.c.
higher than in 1946-47, and this
rise is largely a measure of the
fall in the buying-power of our
money. It is extremely doubtful
whether Australia could show
any greater volume of produc-
tion —wheat excepted—in the
later year. The 24 p.c. increase
was largely a paper-money
measure, and the record savings-
bank deposits (£669 million at
May 31) were no indication of
genuine prosperity. Money
figures, indeed, have become a
mockery.
In the first 11 months of
1947-48 the “value” of our ex-
ports soared. Wool and wheat
brought record prices. But the
country benefited little, if at all,
in the end. We finished the 11
months with a favorable trade
balance of £54.8 million, which
was £38.1 million below the
figure for the corresponding 11
months of the preceding year.
And who would say that in
matters of mo tor-Vehicle require-
ments, cotton-goods, newsprint,
paper-pulp, tea and imported
clothing supplies we were as well
off as in 1939? J Even though
more petrol and petroleum pro-
ducts may be coming into the
country than before the war,
the average motorist is . getting
a great deal less motor , spirit.
Whichever way we look at the
picture it appears plain, in the
ultimate analysis, that we are
not doing the best that we could
with our resources, and that the
root cause of our trouble starts
with the Canberra “Labor”
Government and goes down
into the trade-unions, where it
is joined by a Communist
“philosophy” [Mr. Chifley], and
at this point a grossly inadequate
industrial output becomes ap-
parent, especially when con-
trasted with the Canberra crea-
tion of paper money, plus im-
ported price-inflation.
There is a message for a lot
of people in this economic sum-
mary. One is that wage-earners
should try to get jobs, for their
own sake, in essential industries
and try to follow that simple
principle of a fair day’s work for
fair pay in spite of union-boss
intimidation. Another is that
all useful property is likely to
increase in paper-money “value”
for some time yet, which should
mean a sustained long-term de-
mand for good industrial shares,
with, eventually, a reduction in
taxes and a release from price-
control, but subject to that very
desirable economic governor of
supply and demand —competi-
tion. Under competition the
most efficient enterprise—those
giving consumers greatest value
for their money—have the
longest and most profitable
working lives.
Forestry Pulp and Paper Co.
That bondholders haven’t re-
ceived any dividends from this
Victorian forestry concern is less
the fault of the co. than of the
State Parliament, which, under
three successive Administrations,
has failed to make up its mind
on the co.’s application for
amendments to the original bond
contracts. A committee set up
by Mr. Cain to investigate the
application “apparently went on
strike,” to quote his own words ;
it is to be hoped that the new
one appointed by Mr. Hollway a
few weeks ago will more fully
recognise its responsibility to
bondholders.
Forestry Pulp and Paper
took over in 1927 from a syndi-
cate which was selling the public
specific one-acre lots at £3O
each. The total area acquired
for afforestation was 21,711
acres (12,500 at Dartmoor and
Flinders in Victoria, and the
balance in Tasmania), and in-
signis pines were planted on
15,535 acres; of this area 1775
acres appear to be held directly
by the co. and the remaining
13,800 acres by bondholders.
This means that bondholders
were to contribute something like
£414,000. In 1941 the co. ceased
selling lots, but it will probably
be another 20 years before the
whole scheme winds up.
Meanwhile the co. has been
thinning its forests over the last
four or five years and has set up
mills on the plantations. Trees
removed for thinning have been
used as much as possible for
timber, and the waste has gone
to making pulp. Under the
terms of the bond contracts, one-
fifth of .the proceeds* from these
disposals has been kept by the
co.; the balance credited to
bondholders amounted to
£121,600 last April, which repre-
sents 29 p.c. of their original
investments. But for drastic
price-controls on timber, 'says
Victoria’s Attorney - General
Oldham, this sum would prob-
ably have been doubled—“not-
withstanding that the co. so far
has been engaged in doing little
more than thinning the timber
on planted areas.”
These lot-owners’ funds are
mostly being held in Common-
wealth bonds. The difficulty
which now confronts Forestry
Pulp and Paper in distributing
the money to holders is that it
originally contracted to pay each
person the actual net proceeds
from his particular block, but
that has been found imprac-
ticable for several reasons. The
trees aren’t maturing at regular
intervals apd some had to be re-
planted after the 1934 bushfires;
thinning operations have to be
carried out over the whole plan-
tations without regard to the pre-
cedence of lot-holdings, whilst
some lots have been partly cut
down as firebreaks for the
general benefit of the forests;
moreover, it’s hard to make an
exact allocation of milling, trans-
port and other expenses. '
Accordingly, the board has
applied to the Government for
permission to pool the whole
proceeds, giving each bond-
holder a certificate for the con-
tract price on which he will be
paid his dividends. The only
discrimination would be in
respect of the date of bond pur-
chase —to the original price wilf
be added 2\ p.c. a year from
the date of contract to the end
of 1941, when all sales ceased.
This is the proposal which has
been shuttled to and fro by Par-
liamentary committees since
1942. An early verdict by the
new committee (headed by Mr.
Oldham himself), with any modi-
fications that may be thought
desirable, would not only relieve
the long Wait of bondholders for
some, return, but may also enable
the co, to present a more detailed
picture of their prospects.

H.M.A.S. SYDNEY’S FATE
The Career and End of a Great Fighting Ship
By "MACNELL"
There is no naval name so firmly in
Australian minds as that of H.M.A.S.
Sydney. Both ships of the name fought
and brilliantly won the first cruiser
actions of their wars; Sydney against
Emden off Cocos in November, 1914,
and her successor against Italian Barto-
lomeo Colleoni west of Crete in August,
1940.
Modern Sydney was a fast, heavily-
gunned cruiser of 7000 tons, mounting
eight 6in. high-velocity guns in power-
operated twin turrets, 4in. A.A. defence,
depth-charges aft and multiple torpedo-
tubes amidships. Originally H.M.S.
Phaeton, her keel was laid in England in
1933, and while still on the slips she was
bought by the Australian Government
and renamed Sydney. She arrived here in
August, 1936, in company with cruiser
Australia from Alexandria.
Her most interesting peace-time assign-
ment was to visit Gallipoli in April, 1936.
After an address of welcome by the
Turkish Premier on board Australia, men
of both ships donned gaiters and water-
bottles and trekked across the peninsula
to Anzac Cove. A ceremony was held at
Lone Pine cemetery by Australia’s
chaplain, and afterwards they walked
around.
Standing above the beach where their
fathers had landed long years before, they
saw it was still studded with rusting hulls
and scattered with rust-eaten bully-beef
and condensed-milk tins. To right and
left and below, old paths stooped over
the hills in forky zig-zags, and at unex-
pected corners crumbling earthworks of
some post bore mute witness to the
violence those hills had known.
Both ships left before dusk, the senior
officer timing his run to breast Cape
Helles at sunset. The sun touched the
rim of hills to starb’d, and the Last Post
sang across the polished sea. A moment
later course was altered and Gallipoli
merged into the night astern.
Passing the Italian air base on Leros
Island en route to Alexandria, Mussolini’s
aircraft flew out to take photos. But
when both ships’ 4in. armament closed up
for dummy runs, on these targets the
Italians gave the swinging barrels best
and tailed it for home.
Active Service
End of May, 1940, found Sydney back
in the Mediterranean, a bare two weeks
before Italy joined in. Contrary to
popular conception, even in war a war-
ship’s life mainly comprises monotonous
searching, drills and exercises; *the in-
tense nervous excitement of action lasts
rarely more than a few hours. Even so,
Sydney could not complain of boredom.
British naval forces in the area were
numerically inferior by far to the enemy’s,
and, with a British offensive mounting
across Libya, their activities were com-
mensurately increased. Through the
duller pattern of patrols and convoys,
when enemy bombing attacks developed
with the certainty of the sunrise that
presaged their commencement, was woven
the fibre of frequent contacts with the
enemy, bombarding, destroyer-killing and
full-scale Fleet engagements.
First of these occurred when Sydney,
with destroyer Stuart as screen, flung a
sizeable portion of her magazine contents
at the cliff forts of Bardia. A week later,
attached to the famous British 7th
Cruiser Squadron, she made her first kill.
Six-inch ships have always been noted
for gunnery, one reason why they are now
the standard cruiser in Commonwealth
Navies. The writer remembers a throw-
off practice-shoot Sydney carried out
against his ship off Fremantle. At a range
of eight miles the salvos lobbed dead in
the target ship’s wake; she zig-zagged
and altered speed, and the falling shells
dogged her stern with wellnigh omniscient
exactitude.
On June 28, 1940, the squadron and de-
stroyers of the 10th Flotilla were cours-
ing at speed to overtake an east-hound
convoy near the Sicilian Channel. Three
Italian destroyers were unlucky enough
to cross’ their path. Sydney picked
Espero. In a few minutes the cruiser’s
guns had smothered her target in a sus-
tained storm of bursting explosive. Those
of Espero’s crew left jumped into the sea
before their riven craft settled beneath it,
and Sydney, regardless of enemy air and
naval bases near by, cruised up and
rescued those still alive.
Followed the abortive Battle of
Calabria, when two Italian battleships,
10 cruisers and 24 destroyers ran from
the British Battle Fleet under cover of
smoke, though not before one destroyer
was sunk and battleship Cavour damaged.
For the Royal Navy this was the first

Sydney and heralding the approach of war to
Australian shores.
full-scale engagement since Jutland; for
Sydney it was a pipe-opener for the first
cruiser duel of the war.
Bartolomeo Colleoni
The cruiser’s bottom had been scraped
clean a few days before she sailed from
Alexandria in company with five British
destroyers on a submarine-hunt north of
Crete. Captain (now Rear-Admiral)
Collins dispatched four boats south
within sight of Crete to broaden his
sweep, while, with destroyer Havoc,
Sydney patrolled the Gulf of Athens to
the north.
Night of July 18 was clear and dark.
Sydney slipped through a quiet sea at
18 knots, the only sound the whisper of
wind in rigging and the muted hum of
turbines. She rounded the n.-w, corner
of Crete without incident. Full light
came to find both ships at action stations ;
about them spun the empty
horizons.
Further south the sun
lifted up the veil of the
morning mist and revealed
the British destroyers and
two Italian cruisers to each
other simultaneously. A
signal flashed to Sydney,
The destroyers at once
turned northward, towards
their cruiser, and put on
speed. They needed it, for
Bartolomeo Colleoni and
Giovanni Della Bande Nere
were the fastest of Mus-
solini’s fast squadrons.
Bracketed by salvos, the de-
stroyers drew the enemy to
Sydney’s guns.
Enemy in Sight
The cruiser was working
up full-speed. A spurting
fan of spray in her teeth,
battle ensign whipping from
the fore truck, she raced to
close the range before the
Italians grew windy of the
chase or a destroyer col-
lected a salvo that would
open her paper-thin sides to
the sea. From far ahead a
dull pulse of sound rippled
overhead and muttered away
to silence. Again it came
before the masthead look-
out shouted his report:
“Enemy in sight!”
The destroyers at once
wheeled and cleared the line
of fire of Sydney’s waiting guns.
She opened with triple deflection
salvos, and, with the second hitting
the nearer cruiser, went straight into rapid
broadsides. Range was 10£ miles.
The Italians ran until Sydney sent a
salvo that, lobbing forrard, knocked half
Bartolomeo Colleoni’s bow off. Anchors,
cables, magazines and a turret dropped
into the sea. The Italian was doing 3CT

ABORIGINALITIES
“Eastern”: When Bob took up land
he’d no sooner got his first crop estab-
lished than the floods came, and that
part of it that didn’t wash into the river
yellowed and died. The second year it
was caterpillars that mopped-up his
hopes, while his third crop slowly
petered out in a bad spell of drought.
More seed and more fertiliser were
bought, more weeks of work and periods
of hopes and fears, and the fourth crop
flourished mightily till a plague of grass-
hoppers collected it in their stride. Bob
was ploughing early and late for his fifth
effort when Steve Pearson came over to
inquire the whereabouts of Bob’s brother.
The toiler yelled, and the team stopped
in their tracks. “Me brother?” Bob
answered. “Aw, he ain’t here now. He’s
gone down to the city—he’s runnin’ a
few racehorses.” He paused and shook
his head. “Silly cow,” he growled. “I’m
always tellin’ him he’ll do no good till he
gives up gamblin’ an’ comes back t’
somethin’ sure an’ steady again.”

“Khasi Rokok”: “Alpine Willie” (B.
16/6/’4B) would appreciate the Colo
Gorge (N.S.W.), where the stupendous
Capertee Valley has its only outlet
through 50 miles of high and narrow
sandstone cliffs. A day’s march through
open forest ends suddenly at the Wolgan
junction in dense sub-tropical brush —•
three-miles-a-day stuff. It is too thick for
foxes, and during daylight lyrebirds are
never out of hearing. Menura doesn’t
play to the gallery ; his best performances
are for his own amusement on his scratch-
ing mounds, and he has a quiet sense of
humor. No sound seems to be beyond
him, and from a full-strength kooka-
burra laugh or his own personal whistle
he will drop to the just-audible and point-
less twitterings of tomtits. But what sets
him beyond comparison is his knack of
imitating a chattering flock of parrots.
As we pushed further down the gorge we
noticed the imitations of the jackass’s
laugh continuing, but getting further and
further off the sound-track. Either the
“Get him another board, Alf — he'll never reach the top on that one."
lyrebirds pass the call along, the tale
losing something at each telling, or the
downstream birds were relying on
memory, which was fading. They will
be nesting now; they like to be different.

“Chuck”: The boss discovered the new
hand was not on his appointed job, and
marched down to quarters to learn the
reason. “Got a crook head,” the hand
informed him. “Had it all night.” “Well,
the truck’s going into town in a few
ipinutes,” said the boss. “You’d better
go in and get something for it. You’ll
be back before dinner.” The hand
agreed. Finding him laughing with the
mob at dinner, the boss concluded the
cure had been satisfactory. “Y’d better
fix that broken gate at the yards this
afternoon, Stan,” he told the ex-patient.
“Then see if you can dig up a few rab-
bits.” “Aw, cripes, not with me head
like this I couldn’t,” came the protest.
“It’d only make it worse.” “Why, didn’t
the chemist give you something to fix
it?” asked the boss. “A swag o’ dope,
that’s all,” the hand explained. “Said
it’d dull the ache so X couldn’t feel it. He
was right, too. Can’t feel a bloomin’
twinge even ; but y’ can’t fool me that the
headache ain’t still there!”

“Curate’s Egg”; Perusal of the only
extant copy, printed on silk, of the first
issue of the “Torres Straits Pilot,” dated
January 2, 1888, affords some idea of fife
in Thursday Island of the day. The ads.
proclaim the ridiculous ease with which
£20,000 could be won at “Jimmy Japan’s
Shooting Gallery,” whose proprietor* had
launched himself in business on the results
of his win in a southern lottery. The
local legend was that Jimmy Japan’s wife
was of the blood royal of Nippon. She
was buried in the T.I. cemetery, which
gave rise to a wartime belief that the
burial ground would be the safest refuge
in event of the anticipated Nip air raids.
Another Oriental provider unashamedly
advertised opium among his other very
excellent wares. The only advertiser still
represented is the M’Nulty family, whose
Federal Hotel is still the Mecca of the
old hands and the source of legions of
Bulletin pars. The pre-war “Pilot,”
the size of a foolscap sheet, was claimed
to be the smallest daily newspaper in the
world. It sold at 6d. per copy and con-
tained only one ad. extolling the virtues
of a brand of gin.

“Mat’s Mate”: He wanted us to build
him a fence. “A quid a chain’s me price,”
he said. “Four posts t’ the chain, four
plain wires an’ a barb, but seein’ there’s a
bit o’ stony country in it I’ll make it easy
for y’: I’ll sell y’ your meat same price
as the butcher in town charges,” “What’s
your ordinary price?” Mat asked. “Same
as the butcher’s, with a bit extra like he
charges for cartin’ it out here.” Mat
pondered, then he lowered his left eyelid
at me and said, “Gosh, mate, ain’t it a
pity we ain’t vegetarians? Look at the
money we’d make!” We were 10 miles
away that night.
« * * *
“Wippegong”: If, as the days stretch,
you stop for. a smoke below a patch of
saplings and from the top of them hear
half the bird-voices of the district inter-
spersed with rich, fluty notes of the
singer’s own, look for a slim fellow
slightly larger than a thrush, striped
underwear, olive-green back, and you will
see an oriole. If you know how to keep
still or have glasses you’ll notice that the
color of legs and beak are as rich as the
quality of his song; and most likely he
will be gobbling berries. A month ago in
our valley the orioles arrived and spent
all their time on the white cedars, just
before the clusters of berries began to
.shrivel; dozens of birds, but nary a note
from the lot of them. In Sydney for one
bleak week-end I saw a few playing
around the Conservatorium, but even in
that environment they would not break
silence; yet in a month or so the flocks
will thin, then disperse and the mating
songs will begin. One of the first thrills on
the ’drome we used in Bengal was a
vivid golden flash between two mango*-
trees; the gorgeous stranger had black
head and primaries and the rest pure
gold; but when he lifted his head and
called it was almost a voice from home —
the rich rolling “Or-r-riole” finked the
beauty immediately with his plainer
cousin here. In the Arakan the nests were
low enough to look into ; they could have
passed for that of the olive-backed bird,
as that in tul*n could pass for the snug
home of the common leatherhead or friar
bird. Both build right at the end of long,
drooping branches ; both weave a frame-
work of bark suspended in a fork; both
finish the deep cup in exquisite fashion
and sway almost out of sight whilst sit-
ting. Collect one of each when the young
“One out, all out—some cow's been feedin' my pony garlic!”
’uns have left, and see if your cobbers
can tell which is which ; there’s drinks in
it.

“Hanko”: It is strange that of all Aus-
tralian pied birds no two mudlarks should
be patterned exactly alike. The males of
the black- and the- white-backed magpies
are like peas in a pod for similarity, as
are the pied butcher-birds and willy-
wagtails, but the peewees 1 are patterned
higgledy-piggledy and they are as good
as fingerprinted. The only way they sub-
scribe to an ordered garb is that the male
bird wears a black bib and the female a
white one.
* * * ♦
“Gravelsnatcher”: Answering a query
anent the correct position of the hands of
a right-handed shoveller, my “daily”
assumes that “the shovel is being swung
across the body from right to left.” 1
may be headed for an argument, but that's
the way a left-handed shoveller swings.
I’ve heard the point argued in gravel-pits
from Albany to Geraldton, and I’ve never
yet reached an amicable solution, but any
purely left- or right-handed man knows.
It’s the chap who, through practice, has
become ambidextrous with the banjo
who argues the toss, and he can make his
argument sound plausible. He’ll even
convince you, temporarily, that you’re a
mollydook yourself. But see any right-
handed man pick up a shovel. He takes
the D in his left-hand, the shaft in his
right, and he swings from left to right.
And th" 4 ’s righ^-banded.

“BeiXiia”; Umcss the crow is accorded
the vast respect his sagacity deserves, one
cannot outmanoeuvre the black scavenger.
Have captured numbers of the pests in a
netted crow-trap at different times, but
soon learnt that the wisest plan is to let
the live captives remain in the enclosure
for a few days. Their fluttering protests
don’t scare their free mates, who gather
round the trap, some finding the entrance
and joining the bunch inside. It is after
the prisoners have gone that the rest of
the birds smell a rat. I’ve waited till the
main mob were safely out of the way be-
fore quietly dispatching the catch, col-
lecting them into a bag and taking them
a reasonable distance off, but have not yet
hoodwinked those Kellys. For weeks
they avoid the carcass-baited trap like the
plague, nor can I get within cooee of the
mob. Kelly isn’t easy to poison, and he
recognises a gun at sight. The only weak
spot I’ve discovered in his armor is his
inability to count. Seeing two persons
disappear into a shed near which he has
evil intentions he watches until one comes
out and goes away. Then, satisfied the
coast-is clear, he quietly descends and
gives the watcher within a chance of a
shot.

“Billy T.”: Years ago our valley was
invaded by a giant named Ridd, and he
stayed, married and bred to such purpose
that today most of the inhabitants either
have his name or his physique or both.
Amiable people mostly, except when
stirred by football or sharp practices that
offend their downright ideas on fairness
and justice, and not prone to hunt in
packs—which wouldn’t be necessary any-
way, for even the runts of the tribe are
about sft. llin. and 14 stone and are
most capable either in emergency or com-
bat, Their ancestor chose well, and few
Ridds have wandered from the kindly
soil where they grew up; but lately young
Alan, who is 6ft. 4in, so far, took a wife
and with a new car toured along the coast
to the border and then back along the
tablelands. He came home puzzled.
“Dunno what there is in our valley,” he
said, “but there must be something dif-
ferent from any other place in the State.
Might be the water or the air or some-
thing, but it’s different. You can go
anywhere you like and see good grass and
good cattle and good crops, much the
same as ours, but men don’t grow like
they do here. What do you reckon it’d
be, Billy?” I couldn’t tell him; but
down the breeze from where ironbarks
shade the old cemetery I thought I heard
a deep chuckle.

“Bosun’s Mate”: Have never met the
Koombana (B. 7/7/’4B), but “Gravel-
snatcher” is right on the importance of
top-weight. In a frigate recently. Ad-
miral’s inspection revealed that her pistol
cupboard in the wardroom was without a
light to check presence of all weapons.
Remedy of the defect was ordered imme-
diately, but before the dockyard would
carry it out compensatory top-weight had
to be sacrificed. Weight of fight-bulb and
wiring to be installed was 51b!

“C.E.”; Armed with shovel and bucket
of water, Mum Parsons was encouraging
a few small trees near the house, while
further up the paddock Dad was busy dis-
lodging a few others. “Aw, women are
mad,” the old bloke grumbled, at my
comment. “More rows than enough over
the darned things. She’s always buyin’
’em, an’ if I didn’t let —I mean, if the
cows didn’t get in sometimes an’ clean
’em up the place’d soon be overrun with
the blasted things.” I remarked on the
healthy growth of Mum’s latest row.
“Yair, come t’ think ’ve it, they are gettin’
big,” he agreed, taking them in through
narrowed lids. “Awright, we’ll go an’
have a cup o’ tea.” He glanced at his
herd of fats, threw the gate into the home
paddock wide open, and made for the
house. Ten minutes later Mum turned a
suspicious ear towards the door.
“S’awright, Mum,” soothed the old bloke.
“It’s nothin’.” Mum took his word for
it, and peace continued until about 20
minutes later she once more stopped and
listened. “You sure you shut the
gate. Dad?'” she inquired. “'Course
I’m sure,” declared the old bloke emphati-
cally. “What are y’ worryin’ about?”
“Just my new trees,” Mum explained.
“The shopman told me this variety is
deadly poison to stock, and” She
was interrupted by a roar as the old bloke
disappeared in a blue flash.

“The Pirate”: Victoria’s seal popula-
tion is to be depleted by 2000 within the
next 12 months. Slaughtering will com-
mence this week when fishermen from
Port Fairy land at Lady Julia Percy
Island to kill 50, and, in turn, other men
will visit well-known rookeries, including
those at Westernport and Wingan Inlet
The killings are to be supervised by
officials of the Fisheries and Game De-
partment, who estimate the number of
these amphibians in the southern State
to be 20,000. The modem sealers will be
paid £1 a scalp, and a Melbourne firm will
treat all carcasses for skins, oil and by-
products. Along Victoria’s stormlashed
shores these bewhiskered swimmers in
recent years have increased at an alarming
rate, so much so that new rookeries have
appeared on islands off Wilson’s Pro-
montory, and everywhere the animals are
hindering fishing operations. Although
this is the first professional sealing in
Victoria for 40 years, most fishermen
there carry rifles in boats since they are
allowed to deal with “troublesome seals.”
But to these boat-handlers all furry
amphibians fall within this category, and
to date hundreds are unofficially killed
annually.
SOUTHERN CROSS.
The Cross upon its downward sweep
Scrapes the dark hills, and leaves them bare
Of all but cold and midnight air.
Each night its moving sickle reaps
A harvest of infinity,
Of nebula and galaxy
Beyond the telescopic stare.
And dark, that hides the earth, reveals
How like a great clock-hand it goes
For ever round the southern skies.
Even behind the day’s blue veil
The Cross is swinging silently
And daily, hourly, momently
It marks the time, nor stops nor slows.
I do not wish to see the time,
I have no need to watch it pass,
Measured by sand and hollowed glass
Or pointed by night’s wheeling dome.
Yet all day long, by tick and tock,
The moments melt to months and years
And even in the sky appears
My bitterest enemy, the clock.

“Kelms”: When a Sou’-Westralian
cocky’s dogs raise a clamor around mid-
night the cocky’s subconscious mind
howls “fox,” drags him from a warm
bed, thrusts an icy-cold gun into his
hands and propels him unerringly through
the back door, over the wheelbarrow, and
into a frozen puddle. Then it quietly
retires, knowing that its victim is suffi-
ciently awake to be able to cope with
the situation. He does this by blazing
away with both barrels, kicking the
mongs, and returning to bed, to dream
that he is traversing the Valley where be-
hind every shadow lurks a subconscious
mind, ready to leap out with its urgent
summons. The other night the dogs
barked. The S.M. leapt into action and
the cocky broke evens in his mad dash
to the puddle. The following day Intui-
tion, the S.M.’s secret ally, prompted a
quick glance under a spare bed and the
fox was discovered and dispatched. As
he was pondering the matter the cocky
heard a sly chuckle behind him. It was
his S.M., now entrenched in an unassail-
able position, flexing his muscles for the
next round.

“Old-timer”: Ben Laird, holidaying in
Melbourne, was lonely as he drifted along
Swanston-street, having discovered that
nothing is stranger than a bushman adrift
in a strange city. Then he sighted Dick
Knight, the horsebreaker from Kilfera
with whom he’d had more than one wild
hour in Balranald, and his face lit up.
Dick had just put down a couple of suit-
cases while he lighted a cigarette and
Ben galloped joyously up to him and
shoved out his right hand, crying “Dick,
you old cow! Gripes, I’m glad t’ see y’!
Where you” Then he stood, dumb
with astonishment, as Dick, after
a cold glance at him, grabbed the suit-
cases and bolted into a passing tram.
Mystified and hurt, Ben went sadly to his
pub, grabbed his gear and headed for
western Riverina. Six weeks later l|e
struck the horsebreaker in the Shamrock
at Balranald and went for him. “No
bloke can rush up and palaver me in the
city,” Dick said. “I’m on me guard in
the city. Take y’ down quick, they would.
’Course, it looked like you, but how was
It’ know? Them city crooks is pretty
good at disguises.” Ben thought that
over and said, “But howinell could they
do that? How’d they know what I look
like?” “Dunno,” answered Dick. “I
wouldn’t put it past ’em t’ watch the
trains, seein’ who comes in an’ spottin’
strangers' an’ gettin’ theirselves up
an’ ” “Yairs, but I called y’ by
name?” Dick blinked. “By cripes,” he
said, “so y’ did! But y’ can’t expect a
bloke to think of everything at once,
can y’?”

“Zake”: Things left hanging loosely
around one’s neck are always a source
of danger—l recall that the famous
dancer Isadora Duncan was accidentally
strangled when the end of a long scarf
she was wearing while motoring caught
on something. In the bush even the
carelessly-tossed-aside stockwhip can lay
a man low. In my youth a Narromine
(N.S.W.) butcher left his whip-handle
dangle near the wheel-spokes of the cart
he had just climbed up on to go home
after slaughtering. The other end of it
was over his shoulder. The whip-handle
twisted around the hub at the same time
as his horse bolted. Somehow the lash
took a twist around his shoulders and he
was pulled clean off the cart and was
being bumped along the road when
luckily the whip broke. Not so long ago
a rider, thrown from his horse, kept going
though his tie was held by the strand of
bar bed-wire he was tossed over. He was
black in the face when rescuers got to
him.

“Plankton”: “Bosun’s Mate” (B.
26/5/’4B) attributes small circular scars
on a shark to the suckers of octopuses.
This is very unlikely, as the suckers are
always soft and fleshy. Either cuttlefish
or squid was responsible; both of them
have suckers with horny rims, either
smooth or saw-edged, and in some species
armed with hooks. The former often fre-
quents sandy bottoms, while the squid
swims nearer the surface in company
“Must be expecting us — they've put the kettle on."
preying on smallish fishes, in some locali-
ties depleting fishing grounds. Squids in
turn are preyed upon by sharks, gorgeous
blue-and-gold dolphin-fish (related to the
mackerels) and other voracious species.
Briefly, cuttlefish and squid have 10
arms, including a very long pair, suckers
as referred to above and stalked, usually
on four rows, in the first a full-length
internal shell, but in squid comparatively
small, slim and horny. Fins generally are
present in both. The latter are rare in
octopuses, suckers not stalked, not more
than two rows, no internal shell and al-
ways eight arms. As the octopus is both
slick and watchful, and keeps within easy
distance of some particular small cave
or narrow rock-cleft where such as sharks
could not reach him, any risk of being
grabbed is considerably reduced.

“Wandana”; “When I was working for
Callaghan over at Box Flat,” said Ted,
“he bought a cow for eight quid—just
calved, they told him. He found he’d
been had—it was just going dry instead
of being in full milk. There’s a sale
coming off at a place about twelve miles
away, so the boss gets me to take in the
spring-cart a young calf he’d been going
to knock on the head for its skin. ‘Blos-
som’ll follow the calf,’ he says, ‘even if it
ain’t her own.’ About a mile from the
town the boss trots out a bottle of castor-
oil, he rubs some on his fingers and then
works them inside the poddy’s mouth so
it could get the flavor. Then he smears
a handful round Blossom’s udder and we
unload the calf. Being half-starved —
he’d kept it hungry for a day or so —it
makes a beeline for the natural milk-
bowser, and by the time it had taken out
the pint or so which was all it could get
you’d think by the look of the udder that
calf had been with the old cow since it
was born. At the saleyards he puts them
together in a pen and oils me up to keep
the bidding going till I see him catch hold
of his whiskers. The bidding starts at five,
and when it gets up to fifteen-ten I see the
boss claw at his beard as if a bee had got
bushed inside it. The other bloke
clinches it at sixteen quid at the next bid.
I expected to get a coupla quid out of it,
but Callaghan didn’t give me a cracker.
In fact, the old swine went crook because
I didn’t keep running the bidding up.
Yair, a bee had got into his ziff!”

“B. A. Ker”: Rereading an old favorite
of my youth by Rider Haggard I found
myself wondering whether it was so re-
markable that a head bullet seldom
dropped an elephant. Proportionately,
bunny is thicker in the skull than jumbo.
The man has had no experience with shot-
guns who will not admit that, running
away, a rabbit is easily killed with a 12-
gauge and number four shot, but coming
towards the shooter he can take the
charge at comparatively close range—and
still live. Several days later I came across
two lads ferreting. Their supply of nets
being one short, they jammed the ferret-
box in the mouth of a double hole. Two
or three minutes after the slinky little
villain had glided down a burrow a 17-
hand draught-horse seemed to be racing
towards the outside world. The next
second—bang! Like an ungainly rocket
the wooden box shot out in a graceful
arc, a speeding rabbit, hi§ pace scarcely
checked, racing after it. While an en-
thusiastic but hopelessly overoptimistic
cattle-dog steadily lost ground all the way
to the next warren I estimated the dis-
tance covered by the projected ferret-box:
it was within a couple of inches of a
yard down the slope.

“Bo”: The two shearers had been in
the one-horse township on a prolonged
cut-out binge. The climax came when,
after a week of betting each other about
the speed of everything that crawled or
flew, they set a £lO bet as to which could
stand the most electricity in his body—
Harper had claimed that the “electric
energy” he absorbed through working the
board over the years had made him im-
mune to the stuff. Two days later a big
storm blew up and held promise of giving
them a chance to satisfy the bet. Taking
up a stand back to back in the middle
of the street outside the pub, each was
beerily maintaining that no lightning ever
shot out from the heavens could settle
him. As they swayed there trying to
maintain equilibrium O’Mealley came out
of his pub holding a long iron rod ; this
he thrust into Harper’s hand. “Whash
thish for?” demanded the lightning-defier.
Bung grinned; then he whispered in
Harper’s ear: “I’m bettin’ on y’, but I
don’t want to take any chances —that’s a
lightnin’ conductor!”

“Bosun’s Mate”: With this the season
for fishermen (Sydney ones, anyhow)
wave-washed from rocks, here are a few
tips. When the bigger-than-usual wave
rears up, don’t run ; a wall of water will
catch and slam you. Drop everything,
get a firm grip with toes and hands on a
rock outcrop and receive the water up-
right. Takes nerve, I know, but the wave
will simply rise up around your hips and
sink again. Then you can turn and meet
the few inches of backwash. If in a boat,
don’t anchor the landward side of rocks
or reef. Though protected from waves,
shore backwash can drag your timbers on
to sharp rocks, and if a small boat jam
your gunwale under a ledge. At best a
swim results. No ; anchor to seaward.
Only the form of a wave- is in forward
motion, and all a wave can do to a boat
not making headway is to lift and gently
lower again.

“L. de F.”: At Rosebud (Vic.)
Marram grass was planted to prevent
sea encroachment. , So well did it suc-
ceed that the sea is now 150 yards from
the old foreshore boundary. Where the
old pier was there is now Sand and grass ;
the site of the old diving tower is well
inland. Boats can’t get near Old moor-
ings, and a few feet of water lap the new
pier, which formerly had 12 feet. A big
sandbank is forming and grass is march-
ing out to capture it. By taking root it
has added a cubit to the continent. But
Rosebud is not amused. As a commer-
cial seaside resort it wants the sea re-
stored to its doorstep.

“Jemalong Jim”: If any of you Bul-
leteen blokes can get hold of that “Plop”
cove (B. 7/7/’4B), wrap him up and send
him out here to Euglo West. Ever since

ing oursejves silly about him being able
“to bend a Plumb handle, end on, with

and how do you hold it end on?

“Lower Tops’l”: One matter regarding
manoeuvres of flying-fish that seems to
have escaped notice of the Council is that
these gliders see well in daylight, when
they avoid obstructions. It is only at night
they fling themselves into ships’ sides,
deckhouses and sails. Also, when travel-
ling with the wind, these sardine-like fish
merely graze wave-crests, but against the
breeze they rise up to 25ft. in height.
Along New Guinea shores flying-fish con-
fine their activity to certain areas.

“Esk D.”: The Darby brothers, Joe
and Alf, jointly owned a large half-
cleared farm on which they made a
good living from cattle and a small herd
of milkers. The only trouble with the
partnership was that each went his
separate way and did some things in
strange contrast to what the other was
doing. This led to fierce arguments,
Joe, without consulting Alf, bought a
dragsaw and went on with the clearing
for a few weeks till the novelty of the
machine wore off. Then he left it where
it lay and forgot it for a whole year,
when he found its twisted remains after
burning down the large clump of black-
berries which had grown over it. Joe
kept his own counsel about the affair.
A few weeks later, however, a neighbor
inquired of the brothers about borrow-
ing the saw and both assented. Joe saved
the situation by getting him aside after-
wards and explaining its fate. Then one
morning Alf announced he’d sold the
dragsaw and the buyer was calling to
collect it that day. Joe gave directions
of its whereabouts quite willingly, but
was gone, unexpectedly, on a mustering
trip by dinner-time. Alf didn’t see him
again for a fortnight, by which time
the matter of a ruined dragsaw didn’t
merit more than mild reproach.
THE BATTERY’S SONG.
Days when my mind goes dreaming,
1 hear again, quite clear,
The echoes of the stampers
That once I used to hear:
The drums I once heard beating,
Incessant, loud, and strong,
The throbbing on the hillside—
The battery’s crushing song.
Above the magpie’s carols,
Above the storms that blew,
Drowning the kookaburra,
The country sounds I knew;
Filling the range with echoes,
Flooding the heavens high,
I heard the battery’s music,
And then my thoughts would fly;
Then I, with boyish fancy,
Built stories to the sound
That rolled for ever round me
And roared along the ground;
Heard voices in the crushing,
The songs of men and gold:
The stories and the legends
The stampers to me told.
And over hill and gully,
Along each winding track,
I shouted to the echoes,
And echo answered back;
And there we sang together,
The battery and I,
With all the wide bush ringing,
From earth to open sky.
VICTORIA.

Dipping Troubles.
“J.R.D.”: Lush pastures have
brought to light diseases in stock
either new or unheard of for
some time. On N.S.W. table-
land country, where dipping was
not done until December-
February, it was observed that
several days after dipping sheep
refused to eat and rapidly fell
away; some became lame.
Various secondary symptoms de-
veloped and some sheep died.
Mostly, however, the effects
wore off after several weeks and
the sheep returned to normal.
Owners blamed the brand of
dip, but it was found that the
symptoms were not peculiar to
any particular dip, a number of
different brands being con-
cerned. Investigations showed
that the same conditions had
been reported in New Zealand.
In practically every case sheep
put through on the first day
were not affected, and this sug-
gested that the bath was being
contaminated by the sheep
themselves.
In an experiment a swim-dip
was filled with clean water and
sheep put through daily over a
period. Practically the same
symptoms occurred through dip-
ping in clean water as with the
dipping mixture. This ex-
onerated suspected brands. Then
it was discovered that the trouble
was due to bacteria getting into
the dip through droppings drain-
ing back. The germ is so small
that it can pass through the un-
broken skin of a sheep. These
conditions may not recur for
years, but these precautions
should be taken against this and
other risks; Fresh dipping fluid
should be mixed for each day’s
dipping. This is impracticable
in swim-dips, so dip in as short
a period as possible and keep
down the growth of bacteria by
adding lib. of bluestone to each
100 gallons of water. The blue-
stone should not be mixed with
the dipping fluid but with Water
and poured straight into the
bath. As the dip is topped up
fresh bluestone should be added
at the same rate.
It is unwise to use bluestone
in a power-spray dip on account
of the corrosion it would cause,
so it is essential to pump out the
sump after each day’s dipping
and mix a fresh lot of dip on
each subsequent day. This is
not uneconomical, as a power-
dip will operate on 100 to 200
gallons of dipping fluid and the
sump can be allowed to run
down to this extent towards the
end of the day’s dipping. In
any case, by that time the dip-
ping fluid will be so foul that it
is in the interests of the grower
to pump it out and use a fresh
lot each day.
Save the Sheep.
“C.8.M.”: Are the losses of
ewes and offspring at lambing
time caused by foxes, crows and
troubles at birth, etc., necessary?
A lot of graziers adopt the atti-
tude that certain wastage is in-
evitable. Small graziers, by
careful attention at lambing time,
have lifted their percentages
materially, but the big man does
not show such a satisfactory up-
ward movement. Today labor
shortage is blamed, but the in-
grained conception that come
what may certain mortality will
occur amongst sheep at lambing
has a good deal to do with the
existing position. A vital fact
is that if one extra ewe and
lamb be saved on each property
the total will make a welcome
augmentation to our flocks.
Zebus in C.Q.
“Outback”; C.Q. cattlemen
are seriously considering going
in more for zebus, and there is
now a pretty constant stream of
stock into the area containing
varying percentages of zebu
blood. Properties, with experi-
ence of zebu hybrids affirm their
advantages in hardiness and
early maturity. C. W. Gill, of
Calliope, who judged the Aber-
deen-Angus in New Zealand last
year, admitted the zebu’s virtues
after a neighbor’s hybrid bull
got amongst some of his heifers.
Meatworks-buyers, who prefer
well-bred, well-fed lines of
Herefords, Shorthorns or Aber-
deen-Angus, are said to close
their eyes to outward appear-
ances when zebu hybrids are
offered them, and often pay 20s.
to 30s. per head more than for
comparable British breeds be-
cause of the extra weight.
Breed-purists are concerned
lest the zebu infiltration is not
controlled on well-defined and
skilfully-directed lines. So far,
they say, the trend towards zebu
hybrids is being allowed to con-
tinue too haphazardly in view
of Australia’s beef-export op-
portunities and commitments.
They want to see the swing con-
trolled by a body of graziers,
with the backing of the Aus-
tralian Meat Board and other
bodies, all acting with open
minds and tackling the job with
a view of benefit to the beef in-
dustry and not for the protection
of any particular breed or type
of cattle.
Cotton Belts.
“Kalgoorlie Kid”: I have
used cotton belts for many dif-
ferent jobs and in temperatures
of from 40 to 100 deg., and I
consider “Radian’s” remark
about them (B. 2/6/’4B)‘to arise
from the old fallacy that it is
the tension on a belt that keeps
it from slipping. Actually, the
two most important factors are
the number of degrees it is in
contact with the pulley and the
speed it travels. A belt travel-
ling too slowly will slip owing to
the fact that during the power
pulse of an engine (which is
only of very short duration)
only a short length of belt passes
over the pulley, consequently if
one uses a larger pulley a greater
area of belt is in contact with
the pulley, giving better grip.
Also, when a belt is running fast
centrifugal force, acting on the
top and bottom rims, will tend
to increase the tension.
If a cotton belt persists in slip-
ping take it off, clean its working
surface with petrol, and while it
is running distribute about half
a tube of patching cement over
it, or try wrapping a lay Or of
insulation tape around the
offending pulley, taking care
that the direction of rotation
doesn’t tend to unwind the tape.
However, these are merely make-
shifts.
V-belts, such as those used in
cars, etc., for dynamo and water-
pump drives, are more often
than not run overtight. I have
seen quite lengthy pieces of
3in. x 2in. timber used as levers
to apply force as a medium to
tension the belt. Owing to its
construction, a V-belt gets its
grip by wedging itself in the V
of the pulley, not by its tension
alone, and manufacturers often
recommend up to an inch slack
on drives of only a few feet,
A Useful Winch.
“Radian”: It can be built
round an old gear-box. This
one was built from a 1926 Nash
box, plus sundry scrap steel.
The base is a piece of iin, steel
plate, 3ft. by Hft., on which
the gear-box is mounted between
brackets cut from large-section
angle - iron and drilled and
bolted to the box at front and
rear, the whole being bolted cen-
trally to the base plate. All other
fittings were dimensioned to
suit.
At the front end of the gear-
box is a hand crank, bent from
|in. round steel and with a 16in.
throw. A simple coupling to
the front gear-box shaft was
made by welding the centre
from original clutch-plate to the
crank, which then slips on over
the male spline. The crank is
supported by a steel bracket.
The rear shaft was extended
with lin. shafting sufficiently to
carry a cable-drum 9in. long,
also a supporting bracket at the
outer end. The drum was made
from 3in, water-pipe, with a 6in.
flange at each end. These
flanges, from fin. steel plate, are
welded to both shaft and pipe.
One flange was drilled as a
means of anchorage for the cable
—fin. steel wire.
The gear - shift lever was
shortened to make the unit more
compact, and the hand-brake
was overhauled and refitted as
a means of lowering heavy
loads. Some of the cutting,
welding and drilling will be out-
side the scope of the average
farm workshop; however, the
small expense of having them
done is easily offset by the value
of the winch.
Citrus in Victoria.
“Myrrhee”: If planted in late
winter or early spring root
growth will begin at once and
there’ll be little danger of frost
injury to the tender young leaves.
If the tree comes with the roots
bare, trim broken roots with
sharp secateurs —a clean cut will

ragged one. Cut the tops back

and, when planting, hold the tree

turned to the hole, shaking it

For “ball-rooted” trees dig the
hole big enough to take the ball
without disturbing the roots and
leave the hessian in place. Thor-

Feeding a Horse.
“Mr.”; When oats are dis-
placed by other grains or con-
centrates use these estimates (by
A. C. T. Hewitt, M.Agr.Sc. in
the Vic. “Journal of Agricul-
ture”) as equivalent to 101 b. of
oats: Maize oilmeal, 71b.; maize
and wheat, 81b.; linseed meal
and barley, B£lb.; pollard,
dry brewers grams, 13i1b,; bran,
141 b. Greenstuff used to replace
chaff needs 41b. in place of 11b.
of chaff. Hewitt recommends
giving a horse at least four feeds
a day, the larger portions of the
grain ration when the animal
has the least time to eat.
This scale of rations for light,
medium and heavy horses will
suit average cases: Light:
maintenance ration, 171 b. of
chaff; medium work, 201 b. of
chaff and 51b. of oats; heavy
work, 181 b. of chaff and 101 b. of
oats. Medium: 201 b. of chaff;
221 b. of chaff and 61b. of oats;
201 b. of chaff and 121 b. of oats.
Heavy: 221 b. of chaff; 241 b. of
chaff and 81b. of grain; 221 b. of
chaff and 141 b. of grain.
Always water Dobbin before
meals. Watering afterwards is a
frequent cause of digestive dis-
orders. Allow at least one day’s
rest a week and feed a laxative
ration of greenstuff or bran.
Non-formed Concrete.
“Gem”: To make light con-
crete structures such as dog-
kennels or fowl-houses without
forming use old pieces of wire-
netting with mesh anything up
to cut into suitable size.
Wire them together, four or five
strips at a time, and push into
shape. Using a 3-1 mixture,
mix a batch of concrete and
allow to dry till almost set.
Plaster this on to the netting,
being sure to push it well in, and
leave to firm. Run over the
surface with a steel trowel
dipped in water to give a smooth
finish.
Keeping Potatoes.
“Mark”: With American ex-
periments as a lead, Australian
Departments of Agriculture
have been investigating methods
of preventing stored table pota-
toes from sprouting. Hormone,
known as methyl ester of alpha
naphthalene acetic, was used to
dust potatoes that were stored
for three months, then compared
with untreated ones of same
type and age. The former were
crisp and fresh with practically
no shoots, while the latter
showed long sprouts) and the
general deterioration common to
shot potatoes. Experiments are

NEW SPRAY IRRIGATION SYSTEM
DECREES
FLEXIBILITY
BETTER
THAN
RAINBOW’S BETTER TECHNICAL FEATURES PROVIDE
GREATER EFFICIENCY . . . THIRD LESS WORK!
Of vital interest to all concerned with irrigation —Rainbow
Spray Irrigation offers greater flexibility, requires much
less work and actually cuts irrigation costs by at least 25
to 33 l per cent.
Secret of its flexibility lies in the system’s new coupling.
This coupling is very easy to connect and disconnect, and
provides a positive, watertight join in any direction better
than 25 degrees. Thus efficient spray irrigation can be taken
to any position crops of all types benefit from this
“natural” irrigation method. Early delivery is promised
on all orders.

still in early stages, but it is
hoped to produce the dust com-
mercially.
Improving Tomatoes.
“Jock”; Results of experi-
mental work on spraying of
tomato flowers with a stimulat-
ing solution have been made
available by H. K. Kemp,
B.Agr.Sc., in the “Journal of
Agriculture” (S.A.). The chief
use is during winter months in
glasshouses when natural polli-
nation is unreliable. Beta na-
phoxy acetic acid (or its sodium
salt) is the recommended chemi-
cal, used in watery solution of
50 to 100 parts per million,
applied as a spray from a hand
atomiser. The flowers are
sprayed from front or back, and
spray reaching the foliage causes
no damage. Open flowers or
buds showing petal color re-
spond well, dying flowers poorly.
Thorough wetting of the flowers
is necessary.
This chemical produces no
alteration in the growth of the
plant, and the return per glass-
house (60ft. by 15ft.) was £2O
more than an untreated glass-
house in the experiments.
Treated fruit are more even
than fruit from natural pollina-
tion, develop full color, are seed-
less, have normal flavor, assay
at normal food and vitamin
values, and sell readily. If the
treated plants set more fruit
than they can carry, hollow fruit
may develop, and ten days after
spraying plants should be in-
spected, any fruit over four to
six per cluster being removed.
A New Machine.
“Valleyite”: The “pickup-
chopper,” a new agricultural im-
plement recently imported from
U.S.A., seems to have possibili-
ties. Its primary purpose is
quick handling of fodder crops
for stock feeding. It picks up
hay from the windrows, passes
it through a cutter, where it is
chopped into lengths from one
to four inches as desired, and
ejects it by blast into a wagon
driven alongside for removal to
shed or silo. In asparagus cul-
ture it is the usual practice to
dispose of the dead tops by
mowing, raking and burning, but
an experiment with the pickup-
chopper showed that the chaffed
tops could be successfully
spread by the blast and
left on the ground to be
ploughed in. Couldn’t some
such practice be adopted with
wheat stubble? It offers a
means of returning the straw to
the soil instead of sacrificing it
in a burn-off. It would not
clog the plough, it would mix
with the soil, decay quickly, and
be a protection against sheet
erosion in undulating paddocks.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: A dairyman who
treats his cows sympathetically
and carefully will be rewarded
by more milk, less work and
shorter hours. Furthermore, an
efficient milker will not neglect
his machine. Fill pump lubri-
cators before each milking;
check relief valve ; see that the
gauge reading is right; that in-
flations are changed regularly
and air-admission holes are
clear.
“Myrr”: If fetlocks and pas-
terns are cleaned thoroughly
after work, and stable floors are
kept free of excess manure and
litter, greasy heel shouldn’t
occur, though it sometimes
appears even on the best-regu-
lated farms. First noticeable
symptoms are swelling and red-
ness of the skin ; later the whole
of the skin above the heels and
at the back of the pastern will
be affected. Clip all the hair
from the part and thoroughly
wash with lukewarm water and
a mild soap, or a two per cent,
dettol solution. Dry well and
smear a zinc ointment liberally
over it and cover with gauze
and a bandage. Renew the
dressing each day, adding fresh
ointment and washing as re-
quired, until it clears up.
“Sundowner”; Regular fertil-
iser dressings during winter help
summer .growth of lawns. Best
dressing is three parts of sul-
phate of ammonia, two parts of
super, (one only in established
lawns), and one part of sulphate
of iron. Apply evenly at the rate
of loz. to the square yard, four
times a year, including a dress-
ing in July. If the ground is
very wet the midwinter dressing
may be eliminated.
“Big Billy”: To avoid exces-
sive tyre wear wheel-spin must
be prevented, especially when
breaking up very hard or stony
country. Don’t overload the
tractor. Each back wheel should
have at least 7001 b. for 13.50 x
24 tyres and 9001 b. for 13.50 x
32. Tyre pressures should be
increased according to the
amount of weight to prevent ex-
cessive bulging.
“Mark”: The farmer rearing
poultry for market sometimes
finds that when cockerels are of
age to sell they are not properly
feathered, and consequently do
not sell as profitably as they
should. To avoid this strict
attention should be giVen to
breeding, and stock chosen only
from those birds which are rapid
featherers. Fast feathering is an
inherited characteristic, but it
can also be assisted by correct
feeding. Too much corn in the
diet slows feather growth, while
a diet rich in proteins assists
quick feathering. Plenty of
greens and access to shell-grit
are necessary if well-feathered
birds are to be produced.
“Old Sweat”: Anyone who
tries boiling paint-brushes in
soda solution will find themselves
with no brush. Paint-hardened
brushes should be brought
through the boil in strong vine-
gar, then allowed to soak in the
liquid. Several boilings may be
necessary if the brush is very
hard. Vinegar, while it breaks
down the substance of the paint,
does not harm the bristles —
soda in any form will reduce
them to a jelly.
“Ben Acre”: Keep your
screws, tacks, etc., in clear glass)
jars ; the right ones can then be
found with little difficulty,
“Horseless Horseman”: Dog-
boots are best made from soft
basil, which more readily shapes
itself into the outlines of a tyke’s
feet. Boots should be specially
cut to fit each foot. Allow an
overlap of up to an inch around
the pad so that with use this will
turn up and prevent grass-seeds
getting inside the boot. Toe-
holes want to be so placed as
to permit claws to pass through
naturally. Boots should lace up
in front of the leg and should be
greased with mutton-fat.

and the babe, although, to be
SUre ’ 11 ■! s clinic time -. The
young girls are in the milk-bars
and cafes, and the young men
are in the pubs, and Coolbucca
drowses, and will not awake
until the afternoon. Ned hunches
against a building, drowses until
the perspiration begins to bead
on his face. Then he stands up
and goes into a milk-bar. He
sees Maisie there, with the
young man, and he goes out,
and although Maisie calls to him
he does not hear.
Afternoon comes, and all
orders are completed. He has
< wo hags of chaff for Reg
Brown . at Garland’s Point, and
a bag of bran for the new people
at Allen’s old place, and then
the P° rts begin to find his hand
agam ’ and he pushes their

otber . shoves, squashes and fits
th n until thev „
within the rafll Up whh Mrs®
Wright’s stroller—she has the
in fant in her arms-and all is
fished. Nearly afl are here.
One toot of the horn will dis-
gorge the pub of bus passengers,
but one toot, and even a thou-
sand > will not find Maisie.
It is then Ned allows the whole
flood of suppressed thought to
burst over him. He is a deep
pessimist in a moment. He
is for gloom, all at once. The
young man who possibly
might have returned to his
car will not return, and in
not returning will retain Maisie
with him. Ned prepares to press
the starter, but he does not. He
lingers. His fingers toy with
the starter, move along to the
choke, rub its shiny blackness,
move back again, but never push
that starter.
Maisie appears before the
starter is pressed. She still wears
her red bandana, her green
sweater with its revealing
powers, her white skirt, and the
heat of the day has not wilted
this bright flower. She is posi-
tively brilliant, too blooming,
almost, as she swings along to
the bus, the young man carrying
her small case. They fill up the
seat. The bus lurches forward,
savagely, you might say, for a
vehicle once likened to a kind
old lady.
NT ED observes no charm in the
. dry road. He looks to
neither side for trees. He draws
folds of gloom about him. He
tries not to think. Maisie be-
hind him is bright in conversa-
tion. Ned thinks a little, knows
that in this instance the ten
miles will take her from him.
He does not want to cover that
ten miles quickly, but his own
fierceness is doing things to the
accelerator.
He almost forgets to stop at
Mat’s Honey Farm, and he has
never yet done that. He finds
the seven-pound tin, and waits
for Mat to fill it. Mat fills the
tin, gazing lovingly at the golden
liquid. He wipes off the last
few hanging drops with a gnarled
finger. This he puts to his
mouth, licks first and then sucks.
“Never yet got used to the
sweetness of honey,” he says,
and Ned, in another way, is like
that, but he does not talk. He
takes the seven-pound tin and
puts it beside the driver’s seat.
Old Mat stares after the bus,
still sucking his finger.
""THEN Ned sees the car. It
* is at the side of the road,
gleaming, long lines of black
and chromium, a playboy’s
dream, just as its owner is a
flapper’s dream. Ned stops the
bus. He sits forward, staring,
and the young man gets out. He
does not pay Ned, but waits for
Maisie to get out. She stares
back at him, and he smiles in-
vitingly, but Maisie actually
tosses her head. There is no
getting out for Maisie.
Ned is unbelieving, somewhat,
but happy. He forgets his fare
and with a surge of sheer joy
he belts the accelerator, and the
bus jumps and the dust spurts,
even up into the astonished
young man’s face, although that
was not deliberate on Ned’s
part. He shoots the kind old
girl along until she is swaying
and trundling, merrily, and
everyone is off to Garland’s
Point via Wirril Creek.
At Wirril Creek a happy
crowd alights. Ted Somerville,
who has gin-slings with beer, is
singing, as he does droving at
night, his Western songs. His
voice is rich as he rolls past the
post-office. A face peers, watch-
ing Ned as he hands down ports
and a bag of bran. Everyone
is chatting happily enough. The
older women are weary, but con-
tented. The children are wait-
ing for their parcels, and Ned
hands them out, plus one spring
for the same side of the Chev.,
and a gasket for Mister John-
son. Ned is all the time won-
dering why Maisie has not asked
him to stop at the little cottage.
They pass it and Maisie says
nothing. Ned can scarcely be-
lieve this, but off they go, chaff,
passengers and all, to Garland’s
Point.
Ned says, over his shoulder,
“Someone to see, eh, Maisie?”
but she shakes her head.
A T Garland’s Point he drops
the chaff, the remainder of
the ports and the passengers, but
Maisie stays. Ned cannot be-
lieve that. He sits in the driver’s
seat, staring at the hills, and the
cattle grazing in the late after-
noon. Then he says: “I think
I’ll take the old bus along, then.”
“Mind if I come?” asks
Maisie.
Now Ned cannot believe that.
He sits still for a moment.
“Where do you want me to
drive to?” he asks, and then
says, cruelly: , “Back to that
young man and his car, eh?”
If he expects Maisie to say
“Yes” or even to get wild he is
mistaken. She just tosses her
head a little and says, “Him!”
and Ned is glad, but he is still
not certain, as he sits there. All
Garland’s Point has ceased
chattering; in fact, there is no
one to be seen. There is a faint
singing, somewhere, in the dis-
tance. Silence, almost, settles
down over the old crouched bus.
Ned is leaning on the wheel.
“Ned,” says Maisie softly. Her
voice is gentle for a flaming
flower, well poised in its green
and flannel white. “Ned,” she
says, almost pleadingly, “what
about taking the old bus to
Grassy Beach?”
“Grassy Beach?” says Ned.
He can see Grassy Beach, and
especially in this false pale twi-
light. It would be quiet, the long
shore stretching, then curving
to the north, and only a few
swallows over its entire length.
“That’d be real nice, Maisie,”
he says, and he still can-
not believe it. For a moment
he remembers the young man,
but now he seems small and in-
significant. He can almost feel
sorry for that young man. “Yes,”
he says as he stirs in the seat.
“That’d be wonderful.”

“Beautiful Dreamer.”
“N.S.W. Premier McGirr jubilantly
announces plans for the opening in
1952 of new coalmines to be run by
the State.”
“Our really long-range plans,”
went on Jimmy, the Bankstown
Blancmange, “call for quite a
stupendous output of coal in
nineteen seventy-three fully
fifteen million tons. Even as
early as nineteen sixty-nine there
should be pretty well enough
light and heat for everyone after
the miners have had their free
issue of five tons a week. This
presumes, of course, that a
‘Labor’ Government is still in
power —under a Tory Govern-
ment you’d have the miners
always striking and why
shouldn’t they? It’s their in-
alienable right to use this legal
weapon against tyranny. If
there’s one thing I’m prouder of
than my resolute threats against
any housewife of a five-hundred-
pound fine for daring to use the
gas or electricity she pays for,
it’s the almost-complete peace
enjoyed on the coalfields during
my regime. And this has been
achieved by one thing: moral
courage. Instead of weakly
yielding to, the urge to order the
miners to obey the Arbitration
Court I have demonstrated my
great strength of character by
immediately giving them not
only what they demanded but a
"No, thank you, darling. Mother's not hungry—give it
back to Daddy.”
bit more as well. It’s that fight-
ing Irish blood iii me, I suppose.
Now”
“But aren’t the people more
concerned about”
“Wait till I tell you how we’re
going to speed-up the turn-
around of ships in Sydney by
nineteen eighty-two—this’ll give
voters a real thrill. Our experts
are now working on a
Master Plan. Free wet canteens
for the wharfies, who are
splendid fellows —the most loyal,
honest and patriotic citizens we
have. Look at the superb way
they’re assisting Doctor Evatt in
running his Foreign Policy! We
have other yoomanitarian
schemes for these great workers,
too: free manicures to be pro-
vided by the shipowners after
each shift, which will be a
maximum of two hours; no
wharfie to be compelled to lift
more than three pounds weight
at a time ; free hot chocolate and
eclairs after each aggregate lift
of half a hundredweight; two
afternoons off a week on full pay
to attend mid-week races; cessa-
tion of all work when tempera-
ture falls below sixty-three or
gets above seventy-seven and
immediately the Weather Bureau
reports rain-clouds approaching
from South Australia or Queens-
land ; free issue of a pint of
Eau de Cologne for every ton of
blood-and-bone handled: with
these and a general reduction of
hours to twenty-eight a week —
I firmly resisted what I con-
sidered an unreasonable demand
to reduce it to twenty-seven
hours—the turn-around of ships
will be of almost supersonic
speed by then.”
“Getting back to my mines,”
cut in Jack, the Cessnock
Champ; “the public will be
greatly heartened to learn that in
nineteen ninety-eight we’ll be
opening fourteen more State-
owned mines. At the first signs
of pit-top trouble we will im-
mediately put in another Master
Plan drawn up at our instruction
by the Coal Board. Even now
I’m seeing about recruitment for
surfacemen who will be needed
to burn-off the surplus coal
when the stacks grass get
embarrassingly large.”
“The past few weeks,” put in
Jimmy again, “have shown' the
suffering housewives how ghastly
inefficient are the private gas
companies.
“Despite the selfless attitude
of members of the Gas Union
who have been working their

“But it is the basic yoomani-
tarian outlook of our party,”
went on the Bankstown Blanc-
mange enthusiastically, “that is
the mainspring of our popu-
larity with the masses. For in-
stance, our Second Master Plan

for erection of seventeen new
horse- and dog-courses there, in-
stallation of totes not only on
each course and soccer ground

miners can bet on inter-State

the job, thus ensuring continuity
of full output. Also free

viewer, “it is expected that

which will be mostly without

Isn’t that”

Sport or Industry
The Federal Government has an-
nounced its intention of continuing the
Capital Issues Board to control the issue
of capital over £25,000 by companies. So,
if a company wishes to obtain capital to
increase its activities, or to establish a
new industry, it must submit its proposals
in writing to a board composed almost
wholly of public servants. It often takes
months for this board to give a decision,
and usually, when permission is granted,
the plans outlined in the company’s appli-
cation are so varied, and such entirely new
conditions are imposed, as to make the
proposal unworkable.
Yet the “sporting” public is permitted,
without restriction, to “invest” upwards
of £1,000,000 per week through totes on
horseracing, and probably three times
that sum with bookmakers. And that
doesn’t take into account the money “in-
vested” on that “good and useful sport
dogracing,” championed by a number
of Labor politicians.
It looks as if it will take another
depression to make the present Federal
Government have some regard for the
things that are of real benefit to the com-
munity.—Taurus (Vic.).

Australian papers recently received in
Japan feature bold headlines such as
Sydney “Daily Telegraph’s” “£12,000-
worth of textiles stolen —destined for the
blackmarket.”
Another paper told of a sly-grog jpint
fined £2OO, while yet another even excused
many Australians who sold cars and
houses at exorbitant prices.
Yet, despite the apparent daily occur-
rence of these rackets, the Australian
people seem to be more concerned about
the alleged selling of a few cigarettes by
8.C.0.F. — ’Arry Garto (Japan).
Whaffor?
I’ve waded through a good deal of
legal jargon in my time, but I’ve never
struck anything as complicated and un-
intelligible as the “Income Tax Assess-
ment Act, 1936-1946.” Take Section 45,
sub-section (1):
Where a dividend paid by a company
which is a resident of a country outside
Australia is included in the assessable in-
come of any year of income of a taxpayer
who is a resident of Australia, and the
taxpayer has paid either directly or by
deduction from the dividend income tax
in respect of that dividend for which he was
personally liable under the law of that
country, the taxpayer shall, subject to sub-
sections (6), (7) and (8) of this section, be
subject to a credit —
(a) where the whole of the dividend is paid
out of profits of the company derived
from sources out of Australia —
(i) of the amount of that income tax
(as reduced by the amount of any
refund or credit of that income
tax to which the taxpayer is entitled
in respect of the dividend); or
(ii) of the amount which, if it 'were
necessary to ascertain the amount
of Australian tax payable in re-
spect of the dividend in accordance
with the provisions of section one
hundred and sixty K of this Act,
would be the amount so ascertained,
whichever is the less; or
(b) in any other case—of so much (if any)
of the amount which would be the
amount of the credit if the last pre-
ceding paragraph applied as bears to
that amount the same proportion as
the amount of the profit derived by
the company from sources out of Aus-
tralia which is included in the total
amount of the profit out of which the
dividend was paid bears to that total
amount.
From that the safest course would seem
to return immediately any “dividend paid
by a company which is a resident of a
country outside Australia” before further
complications set in.— Robbo (S.A.).
A Tax Slug
In the statement of Commonwealth
Treasury balances at June 30 each year
there has appeared for‘many years past,
after the figure for the balance of loans
raised for Commonwealth purposes, the
deduction:
Less temporary advance to meet accumu-
• lated deficit of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, £15,658,587 17s. lid.
This appears to mean that, of the
amounts raised by borrowing from the
public, there is always this large amount
which cannot be used for the published
purposes of the loans public works,
reconstruction, etc.
Interest, however, has to be paid on
this money, along With the rest of the
debt, and it is peculiarly wasteful and
unproductive expenditure.
.Why can’t the windfall from War
Damage Insurance be put to wiping out
the deficit and relieving taxpayers from
the continuing burden? The amount of
the windfall is reported to be about
£14,000,000.—Ex-W., A.I.F. (W.A.).
Free Country?
In a Qantas publicity pamphlet on
the “Bird-of-Paradise” service to New
Guinea I found this paragraph headed
“Permits”;
Civilians must be in possession of a
taxation clearance issued by the Depart-
ment of Taxation and a permit to enter
Mandated Territories of New Guinea,
Papua and New Britain issued by the De-
partment of External Territories, Canberra.
Also a landing bond of £5O or the pur-
chase of a return ticket may be required.
Wouldn’t it? A permit to enter what
is really part of Australia. The war
has been over long enough for the
Mandated Territories to be free to any-
one who wants to go there. Simple

Shortage of Materials
At a meeting of the Queensland divi-
sion of the Australian Institute of Dairy
Factory Managers and Secretaries the
president hit the mark squarely with:
“When no special effort is being made to
provide dairymen with fencing-wire,
cement, machinery-parts and other essen-
tial commodities it is a blow to their in-
telligence to ask them to produce more.”
The same comment applies to the graz-
ing industry. In Queensland the State-
“ That's how THEY had ’em —now it's your move.”
owned railways are in such a dilapidated
condition that they cannot handle the
livestock. Yet cattle- and sheepmen are
constantly being urged to increase pro-
duction.
There is no indication of any neces-
sary Government action. Planners we
have aplenty, but most of them have be-
come more adept at inventing excuses
than anything else. Landmen in the
Beaudesert (Q.) district have been wait-
ing many months for galvanised fencing-
wire to repair flood damage, but Can-
berra apparently regards this as an act
of God or something and will give no
priority for materials to repair the
damage. At the same time farmers in
that district, as in others, are urged to
increase production.— Agric (Q,).
By the Way
Present beer famines and blackmarkets
make us old-timers sigh for the good old
days of 50 years ago when we padded
the hoof to work every day from
Woollahra into Sydney.
On summer mornings we could always
irrigate with a pint of beer at Marshall’s
Brewery, which stood on the present site
of West’s Pictures at Darlinghurst. The
brewery provided a free cask of beer for
the public every day, and we were early
callers.
That beer was never hogged, and it was
unusual to find the cask empty at any
time. It was good beer, too, and once,
during a beer war in the ’nineties, it was
pumped in city pubs for several weeks at
2d, a pint.
And they call this the Golden Age!

Local Government
“K.A.S.” (B. 23/6/’4B) deals logically
enough with attempts by “Labor”
bureaucrats to rid themselves of muni-
cipal councils on which public-spirited
and practical businessmen give voluntary
and efficient service to the ratepayers.
But he does not live in Brisbane. If he
did his letter would probably have been
unprintable.
We do not hear “the early-morning
rumble of sanitary wagons” in our
suburb, only four miles from the city.
Those insanitary juggernauts arrive about
11 a.m., even in summer. The garbage-
collector sometimes forgets to make his
weekly call, particularly when the Mon-
day has been a public holiday.
The Greater Brisbane Council is elected
on a Parliamentary franchise, and every
project put forward, however beneficial
to ratepayers, is bitterly debated on party
lines —a very resonant and disturbing
echo of our Federal and State Govern-
ment “debates.” Small wonder that, after
protracted “Labor” opposition to letting
a new sanitary contract to private enter-
prise at reasonable rates, one alderman
complained publicly that too much time
is spent talking “hooey” in council meet-
ings and too little attending to ratepayers’
interests by personal visits and inquiries
in the wards.
The “Labor” faction, always vociferous
in its championship of higher wages and
shorter hours, also put in a longwinded
and wearisome opposition to the recent
rise in tram-fares —the direct result of
higher labor costs and introduction of
the 40-hour week.
Property-owners, receiving demands
for higher and still higher rates, are dis-
heartened and cynical about this vaunted
Greater Brisbane Scheme. They read
almost verbatim reports in the daily press
of undignified squabbles in the council
chamber of that monument to years of
“Labor” maladministration the. palatial

pounds for the glorification of the civic
dignitaries of the most backward city in

roads, parks and other municipal ameni-
ties are concerned, — Brutus (Q.).
Free Medicine
The “Commonwealth Pharmaceutical
Formulary” is dated 1945, the year bene-
fits were supposed to have started, and
liver-injections (B. 23/6/’4B), because of
the scarcity of supplies, were restricted
to patients suffering from “Pernicious
Anaemia” or “Megalocytic Anaemia” (page
43), as penicillin products were restricted
to specific complaints (pages 92-93).
When the formulae were posted to
chemists and doctors, however, a list of
additions, corrections and other altera-
tions was also enclosed. Among these
were instructions to delete all restrictions
on liver-injections and penicillin. Hence
“Jock” can get liver-injections whenever
his doctor cares to prescribe them. —

Yugoslavia
Yugoslavia is interesting in that four
distinct types of her nationals are abroad,
refusing to return, and looking to U.N.O.
to settle their individual problems. The
first group is mainly Serbian —soldiers of
Yugoslavia’s former Royalist Army. De-
feated by the Axis at the outbreak of
war, they carried on guerrilla fighting
from the hillsi until rounded-up by the
Germans and interned in Germany and
Austria. On liberation, and with Tito in
power in Yugoslavia, they remained in
Germany as pro-Royalist refugees.
The second are a bewildered group—
the Yugoslav German minority whom
Hitler whipped to nationalism and sent
to Germany after occupation of Yugo-
slavia as possible emigrants for German-
annexed Poland and Czechoslovakia.
Issued with provisional German citizen-
ship, and their children sent to-German
schools, the emigrants were placed in
employment no German would touch.
When war ended they were in a sorry
position. Germany wiped them and
Yugoslavia branded them fifth-
columnists. Overnight they formed a
Stateless group, living in displaced-
persons camps in Germany. They speak
a German dialect only, and their German
origin is hidden under many generations.
They are just another of Hitler’s legacies
which U.N.O. is trying to settle.
Chetniks, originally Yugoslavia’s resist-
ance movement against German occupa-
tion, are the third group in Italy and
Germany. Early in the piece British and
American liaison officers were stationed
at their headquarters ; when Tito declared
war, with the blessing of Moscow, they
collaborated with the Germans in stop-
ping the Russians, With the Axis col-
lapse, those caught fighting in Italy and
Germany were interned as Allied prisoner-
of-war. By 1946 the majority were re-
leased, but refused to return home. They
too formed a part of the Yugoslav
refugee problem.
Tito’s falling-out with Stalin adds a
fourth group to the Yugoslavs who will
not go home, —E. B. (N.S.W.).
Regional Development
If development of S.A.’s rich south-
east country is to be left to a national
scheme (B, 30/6/’4B) it will probably be
overgrown with scrub and ti-tree first.
We’ve had enough of national schemes,
like the wheat-alcohol distilleries which
cost millions and didn’t produce enough
petrol to fill a cigarette-lighter.
S.A.’s deep-sea port is almost certain
to be established at Cape Jaffa, and it
will be done much more capably under
Premier Playford than by the Federal
Government. Portland cannot serve this
area adequately; its facilities are over-
taxed now. There is a 500-mile stretch
of coastline between Port Adelaide and
Portland fringing the richest and most
promising country in the State.
At present rail is the most unreliable
form of transport in Australia and there
are no signs of improvement; conse-
quently the south-east, 300 miles by rail
from Port Adelaide, is badly served. The
deep-sea port in S.A. will not take any
trade from Portland, but it will give
soldier-settlers and others easy access to
cheap sea-transport.
Premier Playford’s record shows that
he doesn’t play with wildcat schemes, and
there are no white elephants along the
road he has travelled so far —South Aus-
tralians have shown that they have the
utmost confidence in his judgment. If
the investigations are taking some time,
that is all to the good and certainly less
costly to the taxpayer in the long run than
the Federal Government’s methods. With
short hauls to a deep-sea port farmers
will be able to manage while the coal-
miners are on holidays.— Camsa (S.A.).
H.M.S. Ajax
Mr. Churchill, with typical pungency,
expressed what all naval men must feel
when he criticised the sale of H.M.S.
Ajax to Chile as “marketing our national
and naval dignity in so squalid a manner.”
Cruiser Ajax, famous as one of the three
that ran Graf Spec into Montevideo, has
been seen by more people than possibly
all ships of the R.N. put together—she
was the cruiser in the film version of
C. S. Forester’s Brown on Resolution.
Britain has a compact, hard-hitting fleet
in commission, but with the immense de-
structive power of modern weapons its
further reduction by scrapping battleships
and selling cruisers seems criminal. War-
ships in mothballs don’t deteriorate.
Machinery is enclosed in an airtight
cocoon of sprayed plastic, and relative
humidity of each ship is kept below 30
p.c. by dehumidification machines, in
which condition rusting is impossible, so
that a reserve fleet can be commissioned
in a month.
Chile is one of the countries that im-
pudently challenged British naval pos-
session of the Falklands —a bitter reflec-
tion on the Seven-seas might of the Royal
Navy, That the ship whose guns scored
on Graf Spee, sank two of three Italian
destroyers s.-e, of Sicily and unhesitatingly
opened shortly after on a heavy cruiser
and four destroyers is to be handled by
coast-clawing Chilean sailors will raise
comment in Ajax’s war-time crew hot
enough to blister her paintwork.—
Macnell (N.S.W.).
Oregon
The price of Oregon pine was again
reduced last week —it’s now around Is.
3d. per super foot —but the reduction is
on merchantable or third-class quality
only. Select quality is still at old ex-
orbitant rates, which makes the reduction
on third-class stuff a joke.
Unless Government policy has recently
changed, timber - merchants are per-
mitted to import merchantable-class
Oregon only.
As a general rule, Oregon comes in
18in. x 9in. flitches, one broad face of
which is clear with the other face knotty.
Timber peddlers, to make a real killing,
have only to rip the stick down-centre
to get half-clear or select half-mer-
chantable-class timber. Of course, being
philanthropists, they sell it all at the
same price!— Pongo (N.S.W).


knots when hit; pressure of water mount-
ing against her bared bulkheads pulled
her up like a sandbar. “Shift target” was
the message to the turrets.
But ammunition was low, Bande Nere
was fast closing the horizon, and Sydney’s
guns fell reluctantly silent. She returned
to watch destroyer Hyperion shatter the
crippled Italian with a brace of torpedoes.
Theoretically and practically, the
Italians should have won their fight,
Superior in speed, numbers and firepower,
these technical considerations were out-
weighed by the human factors of dis-
cipline, skill and courage. In the enemy’s
case, fiiain objective was to escape engage-
ment ; in Sydney’s, never were Nelson’s
words truer: “He can do no wrong who
lays his ship alongside that of the enemy.”
The British Fleet in Alexandria cleared
lower deck and clieered ship when, paint
on her gun-barrels blistered and a hole
in her- funnel from Bande Nere’s parting
shot, the Australian steamed between the
grey lines to her berth. It was a compli-
ment her men never forgot.
After another Bardia bombardment,
with Stuart and Waterhen, and bombard-
ing Scarpanto Island and Port Maltesana
in Stampalia, Sydney joined the Battle
Fleet on Nov. 11 in a raid on Otranto
Straits. In January, 1941, she left for
home, leave and nearly a year’s unevent-
ful patrolling. Before she left the Medi-
terranean the cruiser had established a
reputation for sustained accuracy of gun-
fire ; a repute which, added to the plain
guts of men of our destroyers on the
Tobruk “spud-run,” rated Australia’s
name high in the British Navy.
Cruiser v. Raider
There is no mystery now of Sydney’s
fate in her action with German raider
Kormoran. From interviews with Ger-
man prisoners, conducted by Rear-
Admiral Grace, then commanding the
Australian Squadron, and from exact
knowledge of what shells and torpedoes
would do to a ship of Sydney’s construc-
tion, facts of the action have been estab-
lished. The only mystery about her end
lies in why her captain laid his ship so
close to an unidentified merchantman.
Earlier the same year, and in the Indian
Ocean, New Zealand six-incher Leander,
raider-hunting with Australian Canberra,
slid almost alongside a strange merchant-
man ; only the Italian gunners’ bad
aiming laid a 4in. broadside over her
masts instead of into her belly. The
“merchantman” was the Italian raider
Ramb I.
A few days later Canberra, profiting
by the lesson, opened at 24,000 yards on
two German raider supply-ships, closed
to 19,000 yards (torpedo range) and
altered out again, there until
her targets were half-awash. In view of
these experiences it is hard to under-
stand why Sydney’s captain, a seasoned
fighting man, approached a potential
enemy at under two miles’ range—point-
blank for guns able to open fire at five
times that distance.
Target
At 1500 (3 p.m.) on Nov. 19, 1941,
Sydney was positioned 300 miles west of
Carnarvon in Westralia, steering s.-s.-e.
for Fremantle after escorting an Austra-
lian troopship to Sunda Straits. The ship
was closed-Up at cruising stations, a re-
laxed” state with one turret manned and
a 4in.-gun’s crew standing by for anti-
submarine defence.
Men were brooming-down the upper-
deck, and below on the mess-decks re-
lieving guns’-crews were at tea; watches
would change at 1600, when the Navy
night commences and work ceases for the
day.
On the bridge there would be quiet
efficiency. Leaning one elbow on the
pelorous, cap tilted to shade his eyes
from the coppery glare of the sea, the
officer of the watch would ceaselessly and
instinctively cover the sweep of horizon
ahead, his eyes returning always to where
the compass-needle clicked back and
V
across the course. A signalman would be
fiddling with a shutter-spring on his 10-
inph signalling lamp, telescope handy on
a lookout seat beside him. Head and,
shoulders inside the chart-table near the
bridge ladder, the navigator would be
preparing his work-book for a four-
o’clock sunsight. “B” turret below the
bridge jerked off its bearing, gathered
speed and swung smoothly through its
training limits, then shrugged back into
the fore-and-aft position, tested for the
first dog-watchmen.
Still high, the quartering sun’s rays fell
steeply out of a cobalt sky, and the sea
itself, inkily blue, drew all about them
the unbroken wheel of the horizon.
Then, at 1600' rang the urgent —ex-
cited but not alarmed —cry from the mast-
head lookout.
“Bridge! Bearing right ahead.- Ship!’ :
The bridge buzzed.
Challenge
It was soon apparent that the ship far
ahead was turning to run. Her masts
opened and soon she was heading directly
into the sun; though, as the cruiser was
well up-sun from her, the advantage of
this manoeuvre was dubious.
It is assumed that at this time there
was no suspicion in bridge-officers’ minds
that the running ship was enemy. Natural
inclination and sound tactics would impel
running from a warship, and when Syd-
ney’s W/T office intercepted a radio dis-
tress signal in the nanje of a Dutch ship,
Straat Malakka, claiming that she was
being chased, they must have felt justified
in classing her as a panicky non-comba-
tant.
But aboard the “merchantman” there
was no panic. A deliberately jumbled
hoist of flags in answer to the cruiser’s
peremptory challenge jerked up her hal-
liards, the Dutch ensign flew at her gaff,
and along her decks hatches slid back
above the slowly-rising snouts and
breeches of five 5.9 in. naval guns. Hy-
draulic lifts brought them to just below
deck-level, then stopped. Behind shelter
of steel bulwarks German sailors were
hurriedly stacking armor-piercing shells,
and between their hidden torpedo-tubes
amidships thbe-trainers, hands on train-
ing-handles, waited the order to swing
outboard.
The cruiser came closer. From a
rangefinder hidden in the raider’s bridge-
structure closing ranges were passed and
set on waiting guns—6ooo, 5000, 4000
yards.
Sydney’s forrard turret was alerted,
but, in accordance with policy approach-
ing a friendly merchantman, remained
fore-and-aft. Only the main gunnery
control tower above the bridge bore on
the “Dutchman.”
Identified
Range was well under 4000 yards,
according to Kormoran’s crew, when,
without warning, flaps along her side
clanged down and five black barrels
swung on to Sydney’s bridge. They
couldn’t miss. The first broadside tore
into the bridge, killing or wounding most
of its officers. A moment later a torpedo
leapt roaring out of its tube and splashed
into the sea. Before Sydney’s turret
could swing the track of smooth water
reached her. A wall of flame and water
towered above her bow.
The explosion blew both “A” and “B”
turrets out of action, wrecking training
machinery and jolting the heavy gun-
houses off their bearing-racks.
Men raced along her decks to action
stations under a close-range blast of rapid
broadsides from the raider. The trans-
mitting station beneath Sydney’s bridge,
the nerve-centre of all guns, was wrecked.
Without waiting for orders, after-turrets
shifted to local control and swung at full
power on to the enemy’s bearing, men
scrambling inside as they swung. It takes
seconds for a well-drilled crew to ram
shell aryl cotdite into a 6in. gun ; and as
“X” turret’s snouts laid on the raider
they let go.
Kormoran’s steel sides at that range
offered paper protection against armor-
piercing shell. Both projectiles punched
through, and, their fuses started, exploded
in her engine-room. Six seconds later an-
other salvo burst in a fierce heat; that
fired her fuel tanks instantly.
It was a macabre scene. Through the
roiling pall of black smoke pouring
from every hatch and crack above her
burning tanks the raider’s guns cracked
in brief stabs of red flame. Her gunners
worked their weapons furiously to clinch
the advantage surprise had given them.
Sydney was on fire, possibly from
ready-use ammunition on her 4m. gun-
deck. The plane on its catapult burned
to a skeleton of ribs and rivets. She
dragged her broken bow round and fired
four torpedoes at the raider. All missed.
Kormoran replied with a single tube that
also missed.
Though her enemy was crippled, Syd-
ney herself was cruelly hurt. Within
half an hour it seemed both ships were
incapable of damaging each other
further. Almost stopped, and burning
fiercely, they drifted apart, Sydney to
the s.-e towards Australia.
German survivors allege the cruiser
tried to ram. It is believed, however,
that this approach was an involuntary
manoeuvre’ produced by a breakdown in
steering.
It would be almost impossible to stefcr
her. This probably accounts for Sydney’s
discontinuing the fight, as she could not
be turned to keep her remaining turrets
in action. The torpedo was a shrewd
blow. Hamstrung by the drag of her
bow, trailing hundreds of fathoms of
cable which, still secured to her foc’s’le
cable-holders, could have dropped from
the shattered bottoms of cable-lockers,
the crippled cruiser drifted into the night.
Kormoran’s company abandoned ship,
and from the lifeboats watched their
enemy, still blazing, drift out of sight.
Kormoran blew up at midnight. , It
seems true to assume Sydney ended like-
wise. Carrying hundreds of tons of high-
explosives and inflammables - cordite,
shells, torpedo warheads, depth-charges
and fuel-oil —fire reaching any of these
magazines would initiate a chain of erup-
tions thaticould shatter her hull to pieces.
Somewhere in the night Sydney and
her men went down.
The Enemy
While natural inclination leans towards
our own ship, which, while under the dis-
advantage of being obviously and at once
a known enemy to her foe, fought her
remaining guns with the initiative and
skill to be expected of the Navy, one
must in fairness pay tribute to the ex-
ceptional fight put up by the raider. An
armed merchantman has never before
sunk a major warship ; and in accepting
the challenge of a cruiser’s eight 6in.
guns, with all their associated equipment,
Kormoran’s Captain Detmers accepted
terrific odds. That he did so much is
proof of* that German skill in gunnery
and seamanship which units of the Royal
Navy that have met it are freely ready
to acknowledge.
Kormoran, sometimes called Steier-
mark, sank nine Allied ships before meet-
ing Sydney. In addition to her main
armament of 5.9’5, she mounted six tubes,
fix anti-aircraft guns and an Arado 196
scout-plane. German raiders had no
official names, only numbers, which were
periodically changed. Kormoran’s was
41 when sunk. Her existence, though not
location, was known, immunity being
mainly due : to attacks well spread
over time and distance, and the fact
that, apart from a garbled appeal from
the Greek S. G. Embricos, sunk south
of Ceylon in October, 1941, no victim
succeeded in signalling for help.
Three hundred Kormoran survivors
came* ashore on the Westralian coast,
and 24 were picked up from boats by the
Aquitania. These had become separated
from the main body during the night fol-
lowing the action.
For nearly a month air and surface
craft scoured the area for Sydney’s sur-
vivors. They found an unoccupied,
splinter-torn carley float and two empty
boats.
Queensland Coal
Restrictions in industries because of
coal shortages in other States puzzle the
average Queenslander. There is abundant
coal in this State—it can be seen in every
corner of the 11,000 square miles of my
electorate, while at Gladstone there is a
natural harbor and deep-sea port
acclaimed by many to be equal to Sydney.
Sixty miles from Gladstone is the Callide
coalfield, where the seam varies from 14ft.
to 60ft. in thickness and from 14ft. to
80ft. from the surface.
With rail connection to Gladstone and
mechanised working of the mines or open-
cuts coal could be delivered on wharf at
Gladstone for little more than 20s. per
ton. '
If that proposition does not appeal to
private enterprise I cannot understand
why the Victorian or South Australian
Governments are not interested. The
ships used to transport the coal could
return with Victorian and S.A. goods as
back-loading and thus open up fresh
markets.
As an alternative the factory-owner
could shift his factory to the coalfield,
where unlimited coal would be available
at a cost of 7s. or Bs. per ton. Surely
either of those propositions would be pre-
ferable to the ever-recurring restrictions.
As a young fellow I’ve seen black-
fellows shiver because they were too lazy
to put a piece of wood on their fire.
Sometimes I see an analogy when I read
of restrictions because of coal shortages.

Water for the Inland
The “Current Affairs Bulletin,” issued
by the Commonwealth Office of Educa-
tion, has in the May number published
a very misleading article upon “Water
for a Continent.” For instance, J, D.
Lang, a Government engineer from Vic-
toria, is reported as saying that what we
now call the Bradfield-Idriess scheme of
water for inland could . only irrigate a
small patch of country, about 4000 square
miles on the Cooper in Central Queens-
land.
The scheme did pot originate with the
late Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield—-it was first I
suggested by an engineer, E. A. Leonard,,
who read a paper before the Royal Geo- j
graphical Society of Queensland on
August 26, 1887. Nothing more was said
about it until 50 years later when Dr.
Bradfield came forward and revived the
idea and Idriess published his book The j
Great Boomerang.
Subsequent military surveys have
shown that it would be impossible to
gravitate as much water over the range
into the Cooper as Dr. Bradfield thought,
but "that does not matter, ■ We could
pump the water over the range.
Tfien, since Dr. Bradfield, another
engineer, L. B. S. Reid, of London, has
given us plans of how he could, iri co-
operation with the Bradfield-Idriess
scheme, deliver 800,000,000 gallons of
water every 24 hours for five years at
Winton, which is 640 ft. above sea-level.
Those who think that all of Australia
is dry country should consider these
figures. For the year ending 1945, at the
back of Cairns they had 285 in. of rain—
nearly eight yards of water —and did not
conserve a single bucketful. The Burdekin
River came down in a 184 ft. flood and
not a spoonful was saved. If eight yards
of rain is not enough how much is
wanted? There is easily enough water in
North Queensland to supplement local
irrigation schemes in Central Queensland.
But we must irrigate with sprinklers and
not with channels.
Another misleading point in the same
“Current Affairs Bulletin” is a map show-
ing nearly all of W.A., a great part of
S.A. and the N.T. as desert country with
no rivers. How misleading the word
desert can be. In about 1903, when I was
a drover’s boy for Kidman, I went in a
wet season up the Mulligan River and
brought out of the Simpson Desert 180
fat cattle that had strayed away during
the heavy rains.
As for the large area of country marked
“no rivers,” herfe again is a classical ex-
ample of what a strange and difficult
country Australia is to know. Wherever
you go inland west of the 7 Darling are
thousands of big-gum creeks, that run
down out of the great rolling, tumbling
downs into salt-lakes. You will find these
big-gum creeks north of Broken Hill \ they
run into Lake Cobham. They are at
Milparinka, at Tibooburra, all up the
Cooper, all around Marree, running down
into Lake Eyre. They are all up the
Georgina, in the N.T., in the Kimberley
and right across the so-called nverless
and waterless country of W.A. Two
inches of rain and those gum creeks are
rushing torrents a mile wide.
We can weir and dam those gum creeks
easily and cheaply. The water would
attract birds and water-fowl, which bring
grass-seeds and thus regrass the country.
We could reafforest the country with in-
digenous drought-resisting trees. Water
and trees stabilise the rainfall, and so
fertile is our vast inland that the average
of Bin - a y ear is enough if it is regular.

Root of the Matter
The Falkiner War Service Land Settle-
ment scheme (B. 23/6/’4B) is designed to
promote closer settlement—not to split
up one large estate to add to another—
and to give experienced and deserving
men something like equal opportunity
with those who inherit their acres. No
one has questioned Mr. Falkiner’s right
to hold a fair share of the land he volun-
tarily defended. But if, as reported, he
already holds land worth £40,000 he is
depriving one of his many landless mates
of a block. That used to be known as the
“Jack policy.” To give Mr. Falkiner
more land because he volunteered would
be almost as illogical as giving a wooden
leg to a volunteer who still has both of
his own.—R. G. B. (N.S.W.).'
In 1945 Mr. Chifley talked of con-
tributing “a token force” to Mount-
batten’s army in Burma, which, out of
bounds to Australian, , though not *to
British, conscripts, rescued the Australians
imprisoned by the enemy in South-East
Asia. He never sent it. The subsequent
Communist attacks on the nation have
found him dumb and inert. What a

Harping on the worn-out string of
profit-sharing, a Queensland union boss
made an interesting discovery: “Produc-
tion could be increased if many employ
ers took more interest in the welfare of
their workers; men would respond to
good treatment.” What a grand response
to good treatment your N.S.W. coal-
miners are giving us! — Balaclava (Vic.).

One of the reasons why domestic help

Steel is the train traveller’s best friend. With iron it has made possible the evol-
ution of rail transportation to its present state of service and reliability.
The “puffing billy” of the early 1880’s contrasts greatly with today’s air-conditioned inter-
state expresses hauled by such powerful streamlined locomotives as illustrated above.
Australian steel has made possible the transformation. It has been utilised in the building
of bigger and better locomotives and electric trains. It has gone into axles and wheels.
d
carriage frames, many and varied engine components, bridges
and viaducts, signal and control apparatus, and thousands of
miles of rail tracks, vital arteries serving the nation’s primary
and secondary industries.
