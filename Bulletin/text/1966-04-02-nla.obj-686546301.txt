Architect Peter Swan chose not only Kalcolor aluminium finish to achieve this aesthetically pleasing
design for the entrance and internal courtyard of the new 2UE building in Sydney ... he also used the
Simplex Suite of sections which Comalco designed especially for commercial frontages.

KALCOLOR aluminium
in the Simplex Suite
Chosen for its economy and ease of assembly, the slim
lines of Comalco’s standard Simplex Suite, fabricated
in this instance by Frank G. O’Brien Ltd. harmonize
perfectly with the surrounding structure. And
the bronze Kalcolor aluminium in both the Simplex
frames and the broad crash rails gives a finish which
is twice as thick and 40% denser than conventional
colour finishes. Kalcolor aluminium resists fading,
corrosion and abrasion far better than other finishes.
The Kalcolor Simplex Suite for shopfronts and
commercial entrances is now widely available at
competitive prices in pre-processed Kalcolor Bronze.
It is well suited to projects of all sizes. For details
contact any Comalco distributor.
Colours? Gold, light bronze, bronze and black.
Available through Comalco and the sole licensed
processor Aluminium Anodisers Pty. Limited.

And the band played on
THE QUEEN MOTHER’S speech at
the Adelaide Festival seemed to have
just the same touch of fantasy as the
Duke of Edinburgh’s one in New York
about exporting a million bedstead knobs.
The Queen Mother, on her first visit to
the Festival of which she is patron,
attended one ballet performance, one
youth orchestra concert and one monster
pop concert, found that the Festival was
“gaining in stature and popularity” and
was “taking its place among the most
important artistic events of the world”.
This is sadly at variance with the views
of many loyal subjects, including the cor-
respondent of the London “Times”, mem-
bers of the London Symphony Orchestra
and interstate critics. The Festival has
been condemned by all hands for the con-
tinuing lack of proper theatres and halls;
the absence of an artistic director; lack
of focus, proper standards or any solid
core of organisation, even for the poor
level of criticism in Adelaide’s papers.
•
Our South Australian drama critic,
Terry Stapleton, a loyal but troubled
Adelaideian, who somehow survived
performances in the Bonython Hall, Elder
Hall and Centennial Hall, sent this final
report:
Memorial Drive is Adelaide’s major
tennis stadium. Occasionally it is also
used for other outdoor sports like wrest-
ling and Odetta. A pretty, fountain-
splashed lake (the River Torrens) separ-
ates the Drive from Elder Park. During
Festival time, at Elder Park we have
Festival Fair. This is one of the odder
offshoots of Festival Fever and runs to
band concerts, pop star concerts, Interna-
tional Night (Folk dancing from Every-
where) and TV Personalities in person.
It is primarily designed for people who
feel duty-bound to go to something
during the Festival, but can’t quite face
plays, opera, ballet or anything like that.
On this night the schedule at Elder Park
was: Outdoor Entertainment; Ballroom
Dancing.
Meanwhile, across the lake at Memor-
ial Drive, Odetta tried to give this con-
cert. She attempted, among other things,
“Water Boy”, “If I Had a Hammer”,
“The Frog went a-courtin’ ” and Dylan's
“Mr Tamborine Man”. Simultaneously,
from Festival Fair, we heard assorted
Scottish Reels, Irish Jigs, “The Lambeth
Walk”, “Hands, Knees and Boompsa
Daisy”, “Music Maestro Please”, and, of
all things, “The Camptown Races”. For
more than two hours this ludicrous situ-
ation proceeded towards discordant dis-
aster. God help anyone in a boat on the
lake! They wouldn’t have known whether
to join the Freedom Riders or do the
Military Two-Step. It is fervently to be
hoped that Odetta ruined the ballroom
dancing because it sure as hell ruined
her. One more tragedy of Festival organi-
sation.
During her rare solo moments Odetta
projected powerfully and sensitively, with
a clear, throbbing, exciting voice and
a wonderful presence.
Her only reference to the competition
came before she began to sing (“It’s not
exactly an intimate situation is it?”).
Thereafter, with admirable courage and
concentration, she got on with the job
until, as a final encore, she sang “We
Shall Overcome”. Then strode regally
from the stadium.
Meanwhile, across the lake, the band
played on.
"It'll take some time for us all to
stop feeling holier than thou."

THE OLD BARRACKS are doing for
the art of conversation in Western Aus-
tralia what the Opera House did for
Sydney.
The barracks, at the head of Perth’s
prestige St George’s Terrace, would have
celebrated the 100th anniversary of its
completion this month. But it is in grave
danger of going, and has become a rally-
ing point for all those who treasure the
few remaining evidences of early colonial
architecture. More than this, it has rallied
those who object to the bureaucratic
tendencies of a Government given sweep-
ing mandate to keep the State booming.
For the Old Barracks are in the path of
a freeway system that will ring the city.
Already the two wings that flank the gra-
cious archway leading to a central court-
yard have started to come down (and

60,000 bricks were snapped up by sou-
venir-hunters).
Feeling over the Old Barracks is also
a delayed reaction to the rape of the
river, filling in the beautiful bay beneath
King’s Park to accommodate the elabor-
ate interchanges, up to three tiers high,
which will link the freeway system. When
the first dissenters stood in the way of the
bulldozers, most Perth people snickered.
Their current reaction is, in part, a gauge
of their shame.
A Barracks Defence Council has been
set up, and won points from the opposi-
tion when the police refused them per-
mission to hold a Sunday afternoon pro-
cession of cars in protest. Last week the
first flutter of a white flag came from
the Government immediately after the
Premier, David Brand, had seen the re-
sults of a radio poll seeking votes on the
Old Barracks’ future: Retain 26,884;
demolish 59.
Then the State offered to put up half
the $60,000 needed to shift the archway
to another site one of the suggestions
that had come out of the dispute. This
simply made the Barracks Defence
Council dig their heels in more firmly.
Said secretary Mr Ivor T. Birtwistle,
OBE: “We read this as a diversion to
cleave the ranks of those who oppose
the Barracks being destroyed. It is utterly
wrong in principle to destroy an historic
building like this, and then invite the
public to participate in its re-erection.
This is the dizzy limit.”
The good old days
THE TIVOLI or, rather, the two
Tivotis finally went dark in an atmos-
phere soggy with sentiment. One link
with the earlier, splendid days, which we
all know now will never come again, is
Joe Brennan, still living in Sydney.
“All the theatre people would meet
in the top bar at the old Tivoli,” Brennan
recalled. “Arthur Roberts, who married
Maggie Moore, ex-wife of J. C. William-
son, Walter Baker, the hero of the Bland
Holt dramas, Fred Bluett, Sydney James,
Lew Parks and his brother Hal, who
became known as George Edwards, Mar-
tin Brennan, father of actor Kevin Bren-
nan, Ned Duggan from Bert Bailey’s
show, Roy Redgrave, father of Sir Mich-
ael, Andrew Higginson, of Albert’s music,
and many others.
“In the early 1920 s there was at least
10 live theatres in Sydney. The Theatre
Royal, His Majesty’s now Woolworths
the Criterion, Palace, Tivoli, Nat-
ional, the Opera House now the
Tivoli, not that thing at Bennelong
St James, Princess, near Marcus Clark’s,
the Alhambra Mick Simmons now
the Gaiety in Oxford Street now Coles
and the Savoy. Then there were the
Majestic at Newtown, Newtown Bridge
Theatre, the Empire with Wyn Richmond
and Van Lowe, the Independent at North
Sydney with Jimmy Bains and the Dan-
dies, the Coronation Hall at Bondi Junc-
tion, the Boomerang at Coogee.”
Brennan’s own story is a breath from
the early days. He won a Shakespeare
recital contest at Ballarat, acted in melo-
drama at the Criterion but later became
a comic. He worked in pantomime as
Dame Trot, Dame Wattle-blossom and
Fatima, Queen of the Desert.
Not in bondage
“I HAVE a whole library on morbid
pathology,” Ngaio Marsh told us. Miss
Marsh, the author of 23 best-selling
detective novels, was recently in Sydney
en route from New Zealand to London
for the publication of her autobiography,
“Black Beech and Honeydew”.
“If a man hits another man with a
brick in a sock, you soon get involved in
cranial injury, brick dust and the kind
of wool in the sock,” she explained. “You
have to be careful because so many
professional men doctors, lawyers,
policemen read detective books. There
are so many who could find you out, so
there is quite a school of donnish detec-
tive writers.”
Although Miss Marsh drives a black
Jaguar XK 150 sports car at home in
Christchurch, she has no taste for lan
Fleming: “No, I’m not in Bondage.
Fleming wrote men’s books. That par-
ticular mixture of eroticism and sadism
doesn’t appeal to me at all.”
RUSHTON’S AUSTRALIANS... 7


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE LABOR PARTY
Gough Whitlam’s Uses
State Aid is merely a side-issue in the current ALP dispute. The situation has
also been complicated by Mr Gough Whitlam’s leadership ambitions. But the real
issue is basically the struggle by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to resist
complete dominance by the ALP machine as represented by the ALP Federal
Executive.
Once these facts are grasped, it is
possible to assess, in the light of last
week’s special ALP conference in Can-
berra, the state of the battle.
As I see it the ALP machine
which is controlled in partnership by
ALP Left-wing “softliners” (who hold
no strong views on State Aid and are pre-
pared to accept State Aid if it helps
Labor electorally) and ALP Left-wing
“hardliners” (who are trenchantly anti-
State Aid) won all along the line.
The machine conceded really only one
thing to the parliamentarians. It agreed
that the ALP would not take legal action
to challenge the constitutionality of
State Aid to independent schools.
Some of the “hardliners” like Mr
F. E. (“Joe”) Chamberlain (WA) did
not like making even this concession. But
it was no skin off the “softliners’ ” noses.
The decision suited them as well as it
suited the State-orientated Right-wing
NSW ALP, trying desperately to create
a situation in which they would have a
chance of regaining government in NSW.
The state of the battle can be gauged
by taking Mr Whitlam’s statements, on
what Labor should and must do to re-
gain political health, and then seeing
what Labor actually decided to do at
last week’s ALP conference of 36 men —
six from each State who collectively
form the ALP’s supreme policy-making
body. On February 14 last, Mr Whitlam,
in a prepared statement, said: “The
present extremist controlling group (the
ALP Federal Executive) . . . will and
must be repudiated ... it is neither
representative nor responsible.” At last
week’s conference Mr Whitlam apolo-
gised unreservedly to this “unrepresenta-
tive and irresponsible” body and under-
took to accept the decision of the ALP’s
properly constituted authorities (of
which the Federal ALP Executive is,
except for the ALP Federal Conference,
undoubtedly the most important).
On February 15 in a TV interview
Mr Whitlam said: “The Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party and the (ALP)
rank and file are behind me, and the only
people out of line are the incompetent
and irresponsible Federal Executive.”
Since that date, Mr Whitlam has been
singularly silent in the Labor Party
caucus, and has not moved a single
resolution to test whether in fact the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party is be-
hind him (which suggests that in his TV
interview he was talking fight rather than
planning fight, or alternatively that since
the interview he has developed reserva-
tions about whether the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party is behind him).
At the conference, Mr Whitlam sat
silent, except that when he was questioned
on his letter of unreserved apology to
the ALP Federal Executive and his
undertaking to abide by the decisions of
properly constituted ALP authorities, he
uttered his five words, “I have nothing
to add [to my letter of apology]”.
In the same February 15 TV inter-
view, Mr Whitlam said: “I am certain
my colleagues of the (Parliamentary)
Labor Party will not back down (in the
fight against the ALP Federal Execu-
tive).” At last week’s conference it was
not Mr Whitlam’s colleagues who backed
down. As Mr J. P. (“Bob”) Brebner
(Vic.) and Mr Clyde Cameron (MHR)
(SA) pointed out, it was extremely un-
likely that Mr Allan Fraser (NSW), who
had taken a similar stand to that taken
by Mr Whitlam against the issue by the
Federal ALP Executive of directives to
Labor Parliamentarians on how they
should vote n the caucus, would back
down. Both claimed Mr Fraser would
not be deterred by the warnings given
him by the conference not to persist in
his anti-ALP Federal Executive attitude.
It was Mr Whitlafn who backed down.
Even on the question of the “humilia-
tion” of Labor parliamentarians by their
removal from machine committees to
make room for men who could not win
places on comparable parliamentary
committees (to which Mr Whitlam refers
in his March 5 letter to the Executive),
the machine insisted on asserting its
authority. The ALP Executive’s authority
to appoint committees on whatever basis
it approved was continued, with confer-
ence authority. A South Australian pro-
posal for a mild reform in the way
machine committees were selected was
opposed by the Victorian ALP secretary,
Mr W. Hartley, and Mr Chamberlain
(“The Executive was completely con-
trolled by a Chamberlain-Victorian axis”
Mr Whitlam in his February 18 letter
to Queensland parliamentarians). Con-
ference decided to refer it to the National
Organising and Planning Committee on
which the “hardliners” and “softliners”
jointly have a majority.
This list of setbacks (to the parlia-
mentary party rather than Mr Whitlam)
could be extended almost indefinitely.
The tragedy is that Mr Whitlam acted
as spokesman for the parliamentary
viewpoint and then decided not to go on
with the fight. This abortive rebellion,
as invariably happens in politics, enabled
the Federal ALP Executive to assert its
authority over the caucus even more
firmly.
Oddly, Mr Whitlam’s leadership pros-
pects may not be greatly affected, des-
pite the reprimand conference gave him
for what the ALP Federal Executive
found was gross disloyalty to the Labor
Party in coming out publicly against
Federal authority. Now he has recanted,
the more sophisticated of the Left-wing
“softliners” consider they could still find
a use for him in caucus manoeuvring.
Due to internal divisions, the Right-
wing Federal Parliamentary Labor Party
elements (which probably still comprise
the caucus majority) are not grouped be-
hind a single leader. They comprise a
number of groups with a common out-
look but without the tight, disciplined
organisation of their Left-wing counter-
parts. They know what they do not want,
but they are never quite certain what
they do want. With them confused this
way, Mr Whitlam still has prospects.
For the ALP machine, last week’s con-
ference was a major win and for the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party a
heavy, perhaps enduring defeat.

CATHOLICS
Conscription
The current notion that there is a
serious split in the Catholic hierarchy
over the conscription issue is not backed
by evidence. The editorial in the Mel-
bourne Catholic “Advocate” of March
17 attacking conscription has been widely
interpreted as being directed or inspired
by the Catholic Archbishop of Mel-
bourne, Dr Simonds.
According to this view the Archbishop
is anxious to restore the political balance
which was disturbed by the late Arch-
bishop Mannix’s open support for the
DLP.
Dr Simonds is known to have main-
tained cordial relations with Mr Calwell


up to the time of the recent State Aid
upheaval in the ALP, at any rate —but
is doubtful that the “Advocate” editorial
was conceived with the ALP in mind at
all, even though it has been received with
jubilation by Labor parliamentarians in
marginal seats. The major circumstance
to be considered before speculations
take over is that for some months
Dr Simonds has been so ill that he has
been able to muster little energy for
Church administration, leave alone poli-
tics.
It is an open secret amongst senior
Melbourne priests that the administration
of the Archdiocese is flagging at present
and many of them discount the notion
that the always pastoral and sacramental-
minded Dr Simonds would now care to
expend his failing energies by entering
into the fierce arena of political contro-
versy. An extra, if minor, consideration
is that the Archbishop is most unlikely
to want to show sympathy for the ALP.
His major political concern has been to
make it clear that he does not officially
support the DLP. If anything, his atti-
tudes have always seemed consistent with
those of a lukewarm Liberal voter.
The Auxiliary Roman Catholic Bishop
of Melbourne. Bishop Fox, on Sunday
attacked the “Advocate” and said that
the editorials were both “mistaken” and
“unauthorised”. He said that the editor-
ials were not published with the authority
of Archbishop Simonds.
Yet, if it cannot be taken as represent-
ing the views of Dr Simonds, the
“Advocate” editorial reflects the opinion
of a significant section of Australian
Catholics. The reasons are partly
historical.
During the First World War Dr Man-
nix became the national leader of anti-
conscription opinion. He called conscrip-
tion “a hateful thing . . . almost certain
to bring evils in its train”. At that time
the Advocate press played a key role in
the “No Conscription” campaign and its
premises were searched by the military
for “matter of seditious nature”.
In Melbourne, particularly, there is an
anti-conscription Catholic reflex, even
amongst DLP voters: a feeling that con-
scription violates Catholic social princi-
ples and the sacred memory of the dead
Archbishop. Thus the “Advocate” says:
“Conscription is in itself an evil thing. ..
a violation of a basic human freedom and
leads to a militarisation of civil life and
Tames
"Can't they see we're fighting to preserve oar democratic rights to trade with the enemy?"


civil mentality ... a conscript State is, in
effect, a slave State”.
The editorial goes on to quote Pope
Benedict XV, Mr John Dynon
“Known for his firm stand for principles
of family life” and Mrs Anderson, of
the Save our Sons Committee, and “The
Australian”, as amongst those who have
made reasoned protest against the send-
ing of voteless young men to Vietnam.
It adds “We believe that the Government
has not any moral right to conscript
Australian youth for military service
overseas and we hope that strong public
protests will be effective in preventing a
violation of human rights which the tra-
dition of Australian democracy has
hitherto been proud to preserve”.
The strongest reply to the “Advocate”
came from the Bishop of Bendigo,
Bishop Stewart, a consistent supporter
of DLP policies for many years. Bishop
Stewart said that in his view Australia
faced grave dangers brought about by
“the overall policy of Red conquest and
particular pressures that are being
brought to bear within these areas
will determine whether this is an
emergency . . . ”. Bishop Stewart attack-
ed the “Advocate” and others who were
concerned with “political manoeuvrings
and high posturing”. He added that “the
Government is in the best position to
judge the means of defence”.
After a couple of non-committal state-
ments the Archdiocese of Sydney enter-
ed the debate through Dr Murray of the
Catholic Information Bureau, who said
that the “Advocate’s” editorial was rather
too severe on the conscription issue.
“The editorial is right when it says
that the State does not have the uncondi-
tional right to conscript young men for
the Army. But the State does have the
right when circumstances concerning
self-defence arise. This does not only
mean the invasion of Australia by a
hostile power.”
These are strange days when the
National Civic Council and the DLP
find themselves on the side of the Arch-
diocese of Sydney and opposed by the
semi-official organ of the Archdiocese
of Melbourne. The irony was deepened
by the charge of the “Advocate” in its
most recent issue that “a letter writing
squad had been called into action” against
it. Both the DLP and the NCC deny
this. However, it cannot be said that
the Catholic Church is at the moment
seriously split over the conscription issue.
A sense of national emergency and a
long anti-Communist tradition combine
to ensure the Government the support of
the vast majority of the hierarchy, even in
such a touchy issue amongst Catholics as
conscription.
It is fascinating to imagine what the
great anti-conscriptionist Daniel Mannix
would have done in the present debate.
But, with his usual superb tactical skill,
he has removed himself from what he
would surely have found a most- intri-
guing and difficult situation.

THE PRESS
Scientists and Editors
Seminars on journalism are quite the thing these days with the Australian Journal-
ists’ Association running an annual one on “Professional Journalism” (why that
adjective?) and another *just recently on foreign news reporting. Last week the CSIRO
was in on the act with a seminar on science journalism.
Appropriately held in the igloo-shaped
Academy of Science Building, about a
hundred people, a mixture of scientists
and journalists, were gathered together
for a modest one-evening session. A
number of British science journalists
had been imported for this and other oc-
casions and one of them, Mr Nigel Cal-
der, editor of the London weekly “New
Scientist”, made the opening speech.
He made the point that really science
was a matter of small, tedious steps for-
ward by the “quiet revolutionaries in
the laboratory” and not the nuclear
power, miracle drugs or space acrobatics
on which the sensationalist Press concent-
rates its attention. The problems of the
science journalist were to keep up with
his subject three million scholarly
papers in science are churned out each
year. He had to write intelligibly yet not
inaccurately through oversimplification.
Beyond this his speech smacked very
much of industrial advocacy.
The reason why science was not treated
better in newspapers was not because of
any faults in the readers they had a
huge unsatisfied appetite for science news
or the science writers. The villains
were the editors of various brands
from managing through news down to the
subs. All were ignorant of the most
elementary facts of science and were
determined to do down the science writer.
They “beat up” his pieces, put on mis-
leading heads, chopped out the carefully
inserted reservations in his story.
There ought to be a full-time science
writer on every newspaper and he ought
to be well paid because he was a dedicated
man working long hours. “Australia will
remain indefinitely one of the great
underdeveloped regions of the world un-
less the general public and men in author-
ity become much better informed about
current progress in science and tech-
nology”, Calder predicted.
Another English science journalist who
spoke later on in the evening was also
rather free with his general “ought-
prepositions”. We should not be satisfied,
he said, until science gets as much space
in the daily newspapers as sport and en-
tertainment. It was disgraceful that
whereas every newspaper had a finance
editor and a sports editor, almost none
had a science editor.
Ironically enough, it was the scientists
who had the most interesting things to
say, particularly the principal scientist
speaker Dr John Falk. Chief of the
CSIRO Division of Plant Industry. He
emphasised the massive communications
problem ' which the development of
science posed, not only between the gen-
eral public and scientists but between
the scientists of different disciplines.
The written papers on the synthesis of
chlorophyll, for instance, are more volu-
minous than the whole of classical Latin
literature and the vocabulary of organic
chemistry is twice as large as that of the
English language. And that vocabulary is
unintelligible to the layman and also to
the geneticist or astronomer. To write
about science for the outsider is difficult,
though it is increasingly necessary as
much because of the annual funding pro-
cedure now so common for science pro-
jects.
Dr Falk did not think that scientists
had any peculiar social responsibility
a silly kind of catch-cry because it is
not scientists who decide how their dis-
coveries are used but society through its
political system. Still, this makes know-
ledge about scientific work all the more
important and journalism will be the
main means of communication.
The real challenge to journalists is to
mix some education in with the enter-
tainment which catches the attention of
the reader. Every story should contain
“just a little information about the slow
hard road, the intense study, the tenacity,
the heartbreaks of experimental science.
If the public just begin to understand
how human it all is, they will start to
lose their fear and distrust of science”,
he said.
Dr Falk remarked on some of the
reasons for friction between journalists
and scientists. Some scientists simply felt
that their job was solely getting on with
the work in the lab; others were embar-
rassed by past experience with the Press.
They had had emphasis wrongly placed,
reservations omitted, claims overstated
and so on. This embarrassment was un-
justified because in fact their peers did

not judge Press reports by the standards
they applied to the appraisal of a learned
paper.
The journalist was only doing his job
in making the report lively, dramatising
the possibilities which the discovery open-
ed up. Perhaps scientists were too
squeamish about reports of their work.
“I believe we scientists have to take
the rou § h with the smooth, doing what
we can to help the situation improve,
hoping our newspapers will make a real
effort in this direction themselves”, Dr
Falk said.
EDUCATION
Anarchy and Bureaucracy
Reversing the description of an overseas visitor, the Melbourne political
sociologist, A. F. Davies, once suggested that the Victorian State Government might
not be too unfairly described as “bureaucracy tempered by anarchy”.
The anarchy, in the view of the
Premier, Sir Henry Bolte, the Education
Department and the daily Press, was
last week supplied by the 4000 secondary
and technical teachers who staged their
third one-day strike in the past nine
months. The stoppage was called first
by the Victorian Secondary Teachers’
Association, and supported by the High
Schools’ and Technical Schools’ branches
of the Primary School-dominated Vic-
torian Teachers’ Union. The three in-
volved represent some 10,000 Victorian
teachers, and more than 250 schools and
150,000 students were affected.
The response of teachers varied sur-
prisingly from school to school. At
Mitcham High School only six of a staff
of 53 ' reported for work; at Mount
Waverley High only three out of 20.
Most schools were evenly divided but
some had nearly a full staff complement
present.
A few significant patterns lay behind
these figures: young teachers were more
ready to strike than their older col-
leagues; members of the VSTA were
more ready to strike than secondary
members of the VTU; and, in a pro-
motion system in which black marks
have more relative weight than white
ones, the schools with most strikers
usually had headmasters sympathetic to
the cause.
The VSTA called the strike as part
of the campaign to have the State Liberal
Government reform the Teachers’
Tribunal. The present tribunal consists
of an independent chairman, a Govern-
ment representative and a teachers’ rep-
resentative (a primary teacher). The
VSTA wants the teachers' nominee to be
drawn from the secondary, or technical,
or primary divisions according to the
matter under consideration. The Govern-
ment has offered instead to create a
seven-man tribunal with an independent
chairman, three Government nominees,
and one nominee each from the primary,
secondary and technical teaching
branches. The secondary teachers claim
that this would simply replace a board
on which they have no representation
with one on which they could be out-
voted by 6 to 1. a reform in name but
no L,‘ n * act ' . . .
The strike is unlikely to influence the
Premier a man of great obduracy
to grant the demands, and, because tt
appears to be concerned with a techni-
cality of which most people do not see
the significance, the teachers do not have
greal public support. On the other hand,
e> ee a un ess t ey stage some
form of strong protest the professional
injustice they have suffered for more than
one general,on will continue for an-
o rer. is rCd y eyond dispute that
the present tribunal gives little encourage-
ment to the dedicated and well-qualified
secondary teacher and that because of
this it contributes to the general erosion
of high school morale and proficiency.
The Bolte alternative might not be much
better.
While responsible forces in the VSTA
have attempted to keep the issue focused
on the injustice of the tribunal set-up, an
emerging force in the high schools’ and
technical schools’ branches of the VTU
is now trying to divert the professional
passions aroused by the present dispute
to a wholesale denunciation of the State
Government’s education policies and to
use this denunciation for political pur-
poses. Some of these teachers have
already worked behind the scenes to
promote demonstrations by their students.
In the teachers’ organisations this
group is working to broaden the issues
about which direct action will be taken.
It is also attempting to get teachers to
commit themselves to work against the
State and Federal Governments in the
next elect-ons “as a protest against their
education policies”.
A measure of the strength and intel-
ligence of the present leadership of the
VSTA will be provided by the outcome
of their increasingly frequent encounters
with this militant group which has
strictly political as well as educational
ambitions. Unless this challenge is
headed off, a situation may be created in
the teaching unions of “anarchy tempered
by bureaucracy”.

Dedication
A noisy meeting of 3,000 nurses in
the Sydney Town Hall last week and
their chanting, placard-carrying demons-
tration in the city peak-hour rush after-
wards, highlighted the urgency of the
New South Wales nurses’ wage claims,
to be heard before a Conciliation Com-
missioner next Tuesday.
Nurses from more than 40 metro-
politan and near-country hospitals came
in 30 chartered buses, by car and train.
One group even walked for five and
a half hours from Sutherland District
Hospital, to make up one of the biggest
industrial protest meetings of its kind
seen in NSW. Mr L. Hart, the general
secretary of the NSW Nurses’ Associa-
tion, told the stamping, cheering assem-
bly: “They expect nurses to live on plati-
tudes, not money”. During the day some
of the demonstrators tried to see MPs
at Parliament House, following up a
similar visit by 40 registered sisters three
weeks ago.
“The nurses’ revolution”, as their
roneoed protest song called it, had come
to a head following the Hospitals Com-
mission’s rejection of Association claims
for increased nursing salaries last August.
At that time, Mr Hart had spoken for
two days before the Hospitals Commis-
sion. But the Commission agreed to pay
nothing more than the 10 per cent mar-
ginal increase, awarded under a Federal
basic wage judgment in 1963. The As-
sociation said it would only accept the
10 per cent increase as an interim, not a
final, award. whil° took their claims
to the State Conciliation Committee. Yet,
with their appeal coming up on Tuesday,
the nurses have not received the 10 per
cent marginal increase, paid to most
workers 12 to 18 months ago.
The increase in Victorian nursing sala-
ries last August is another grievance of
New South Wales nurses. A Sydney
nursing sister of 10 years’ hospital ex-
perience, expressed the general feeling
when she said: “Sisters in Victoria, who
have been working as long as l, get paid
$lO more. They should at least bring
us into line with Victorian wages”. She
added that her work in a chest and heart
unit made it necessary to complete six
months’ postgraduate study, for which
she earned no extra money. “Hospitals
expect to have qualified nurses on their
staff, but they are not prepared to pay”,
she said.
Most sisters share this complaint about


wages not increasing with the increase
in technical responsibility they have to
take on, as medical science has developed.
In the cardio-vascular unit at Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital, the medical team
relies on a sister watching and reporting
fluctuations on a monitor; any mistake
could mean a patient’s death in three
minutes.
Nurses are angry because first year
sisters are paid less than hospital dome-
stic staff and sisters of 15 years’ standing
earn $45.10 less than most typists.
Trainee nurses take responsibility for
patients’ lives, from the age of 17. They
often have to attend three hours of lec-
tures at night after working an eight
hour day, or return to the hospital on
days off for lectures; girls in some hos-
pitals still do not get two days off a
week.
The incentive of service, which stems
from the charitable-religious-military
background of the nursing profession, is
not strong enough today, it seems, to
make low pay, long hours and strict
discipline tolerable. Norman MacKenzie
in “Women in Australia”, estimated that
60 per cent of the girls who start nursing
in Australia have left the job by the end
of the four-year training period.
The NSW Nurses’ Association is also
attempting to compensate nurses for shift
work and weekend work, by including
penalty rates in their claims. The new
salary demands would give a first year,
general registered sister $42.60 instead
of the present $36.55 and after 15 years
a sister would get $51.96 instead of
$45.10.
Mr Hart explained that the first step
would be to ask for the 10 per cent
marginal increase as a temporary award
while the Conciliation Commission hears
their new claims. “We have been denied
this 10 per cent for too long,” he said.
“The hearing could take 12 months or
more and meanwhile the nurses haven’t
received the marginal award they are
entitled to. They are very upset.”
Mr Hart said, however, they would not
take strike action, in the interests of
their patients’ welfare. The Hospitals
Commission is expected to hold up pro-
ceedings on Tuesday, by asking that the
case go before a Judge of the Industrial
Commission, rather than a Conciliation
Commissioner.

WHO ARE
THE GUILTY
MEN?
By MICHAEL BAUME
Joern Utzon's drawing of the longitudinal section through the
Minor Hall. From "Zodiac".
The defendants are charged before
the people of New South Wales
with damaging the Opera House.
Their defence has not been to deny that
damage. Each defendant rests his case
on showing that the damage is being
caused by other defendants.
The public jury, therefore, can accept
as a basis for its deliberations that Mr
Joern Utzon's absence from stage 3 of
the construction of the Sydney Opera
House is a matter of grave public
moment; it must now satisfy itself who
are the guilty men.
The jury should not be swayed too
much in this matter by the fact that no
one will remember in 50 years’ time who
Mr Davis Hughes was except possibly
as the philistine who sacked Joern Utzon
—while the monument at Benelong Point
will be memorial enough for Mr Utzon.
The jury should remember that history
is not always kind to architects; that
there is no guarantee that history will
find in Utzon's favor despite the insist-
ence of today’s experts.
But Messrs Davis Hughes and Joern
Utzon are not the only defendants. The
list is a long one. N 7
They are charged (mainly by each
other) despite a universal recognition
that all acted with sincerity, fully be-
lieving themselves to be right, and in the
public interest.
"jy/fosT of the charges against the first
defendant, The Honorable Mr Davis
Hughes (NSW Minister for Works) do
not stand up. It is claimed against him
that he forced the withdrawal of the
architect of the Opera House, Mr Joern
Utzon, that he placed impossible con-
ditions on his return to the project by
offering the minor role of designer-archi-
tect only, with the result that the original
brilliant concept of the Opera House now
cannot be achieved without Mr Utzon.
Mr Hughes says his insistence on in-
stituting “proper procedures” aimed at
protecting the already battered public
purse and speeding up completion of
the job were the real reasons prompting
Mr Utzon’s resignation. These included
an insistence on tendering for all con-
tracts, having working drawings com-
pleted before calling contracts or author-
ising mock-ups. and a change in control
whereby the Minister took direct control
of expenditure away from the Opera
House Committee and the Department
of Local Government.
The Utzonites (and in particular the
Utzon Only Committee, whose case has
“l do not think anyone in their right
senses would say it will cost up to £lO
million. This is ludicrous and absurd.
You may as well say it will cost £5O
million,’’ Mr. R. J. Heffron, February,
1960.
been put with far more attention to
ferocity than to fact) have claimed that
Mr Hughes had beeft seeking some
method of getting rid of Utzon, or at
least making him the scapegoat for the
Opera House bungle, ever since the
Liberal-Country Party won the NSW
elections in May last year; that Mr
Hughes’ party has been consistently
critical of the whole project; that as a
Country Party member in an area
affected by drought he has an emotional
opposition to spending money on the
opera project; that he has been promis-
ing to unearth scandals about the Opera
House and has not yet come up with one;
and that the present Government, when
in opposition, had always acted with
disgraceful political opportunism over
the Opera House, even in 1957, relating
Opera House costs (then estimated at
less than $8 million) to finding homes
for people evicted in Redfern.
The Utzonites have charged Mr
Hughes with “misrepresentation, caused
by ignorance and jealousy” in one of
their latest propaganda publications. They
have stated that Mr Hughes’ public
statements about Utzon's plans to use
plywood for the interior of the halls
were dishonest in claiming that the en-
gineering consultant had questioned the
feasibility of the design and that as a
result Hughes had refused permission
to build a prototype.
They claim that Mr Hughes knew
that the engineers’ criticism had been
withdrawn in a letter to the Minister
before he made the dispute public.
The facts of this charge have been
disproved by the letter itself, which
quite clearly does not withdraw any
objection and merely says that the
engineers wish the Minister to defer
consideration of their objections in the
hope that the achitect and the engineers
may work out some mutually agreeable
solution. So far this has not happened.
To deny the Utzonite case still
further, the engineers asked Mr Hughes
to defer consideration of their objec-
tions only because Mr Utzon requested
them to do so. It has also been firmly
denied that Mr Hughes went behind
the architect's back to get the engineers’
comments direct; in fact the engineers’
objections went to Mr Hughes in mid-
February through Mr Utzon, who wrote
a covering note to Mr Hughes that “I
cannot agree” and that Amp’s local
office must not have examined his
scheme properly.
It was this failure to agree by the
architect and engineers that caused Mr
Hughes not to accede to Mr Utzon’s re-
quest to authorise the spending of
$120,000 on “experimental mock-ups”
of the ceilings until he saw the plans and

detailed drawings for those mock-ups
and until the structural engineers agreed
that they were feasible. Neither of these
quite sensible conditions has been met.
It has been charged against Mr Hughes
that he deliberately withheld money from
Mr Utzon, knowing the Architect to be
in financial difficulties, so forcing him
'to resign, and that this was part of a long-
standing plan to get Mr Utzon relegated
to designer-architect only.
Mr Hughes has denied this absolutely,
saying that he considers it unlikely that
Mr Utzon is broke (Mr Seidier of the
“Utzon Only” group says Utzon is about
SBO,OOO in the red and could not pay
his staff), and adding that up to last
June Mr Utzon had been paid more than
$1 million in fees since 1957, of which
$84,000 was last year’s, that he was
receiving the normal $20,000 a month
progress payments and that every re-
quest for regular payment had been met.
The only payment in dispute was a
claim for $102,000 lodged last October
for work done in 1960 and which re-
lated to a claim for a percentage on the
stage machinery in addition to the normal
architect’s fee and on which Mr Hughes
had quite properly not made up his
mind.
The only really serious charge against
Mr Hughes still to be decided is the
critical one that he appeared all too
willing to get rid of Mr Utzon; that he
did not make a sufficiently serious at-
tempt to bridge the narrow gap between
the positions taken by the architect and
the Government. As Mr R. A. Gilling,
president of the NSW chapter of the
Royal Institute of Architects, pointed
out, there was scope for negotiation be-
tween the two had not Mr Hughes been
so willing to accept Mr Utzon’s letter of
March 15 as absolutely and completely
rejecting the Government's proposals.
For in his letter Mr Utzon agreed that
he had “not the slightest objection” to
Mr Hughes having a team of architects
and consultants “to be your controlling
and liaison panel”. The word “control-
ling” is important. Yet at the same time
Utzon refused to work “under” any
other architect or “merely to prepare
designs in accordance with instructions
and leave it to others to supervise con-
struction”.
It is surprising that Mr Hughes could
not discern within the apparent confusion
of this letter an attempt by the architect
to save his face and his job and to put
on a bold front about it. Mr Utzon
seemed in his letters willing to subject
himself to professional control in fact,
so long as he was nominally to be in
charge of everything. To the extent that
Mr Utzon’s departure is due to Mr
Hughes’ hasty acceptance of this letter
as Utzon’s last word, then the conse-
quent damage to the Opera House as a
beautiful building must be in part Mr
Hughes’ responsibility.
And now Mr Hughes will not say
whether his offer to Mr Utzon is still
open; or indeed whether he would have
Mr Utzon back in any circumstances.
“Utzon cares less about financial gain
than principles; in fact I’m worried
about him. He’s spent a lot of his own
money on this*.” Ove Arup, 1962.
The Utzon-Hughes battle was well and
truly under way last November, when
Hughes said bluntly that the present
situation in stage 3 was “most unsatis-
factory”; that there were few detailed
drawings for the building works; that
“if proper control of the cost and pro-
gramming of the work was to be
achieved, these plans must be prepared
and until all necessary documents were
available, construction of stage 3 would
not commence”.
He said it was essential that planning
and construction of the whole of the
remainder of the project be completely
programmed using a system of network
analysis, instead of just going along bit
by bit. “Insistence by the Government
on final working drawings and documents
for the tendering within reasonable time
were essential. There has been a drift
beyond the time and costs that should
not have been allowed to go on.”
In these matters it is evident that Mr
Hughes was doing nothing more than
exercising sensible control as a client
over an architect whose building costs
had for a variety of reasons got quite
out of hand.
But this does not mean that Mr Hughes
was necessarily right when he bucked
against the recommendation made by
the architect that Ralph Symonds Ltd
get the $2 million plywood contract with-
out calling for tenders. “This I would
not have done when the company con-
cerned was in a difficult financial posi-
tion”. The facts are that Symonds, al-
though in receivership, are the only
people who could do this adequately;
they have worked in collaboration with
the architect on developing the huge
lengths he wants; and their factory is on
the Parramatta River, so the moulded
forms could be cheaply sent by water to
the site.
charges against Mr Joern Utzon
are that by his lack of humility and
failure to compromise he has jeopardised
the completion of the structure he con-
ceived; that his admitted annoyance
about questions of money has forced
the Government to take action; that his
failure to clarify his thinking and adopt
an orderly design and construction ap-
proach added considerably to the cost of
the Opera House; and that by his refusal,
so far, to hand over any drawings or
sketches for stage 3 to the Government,
he has helped sabotage his own master-
piece, and by withdrawing as architect
(he strongly denies he resigned despite
the appearance of that word in a letter
to Mr Hughes, and insists he was forced
out).
On legal advice no evidence has been
given by Mr Utzon or his assistants,
despite repeated requests. To a large ex-
tent his defence rests on his skill as an
architect. There can be no doubt about
Utzon’s reputation as a designer
largely based on his Sydney Opera House
that has swelled around the world.


He has been honored in Germany with
a medal; chapters are written about his
work in the most highly reputed text
books; he is acknowledged as a leader of
the new wave of architectural thought.
His cost-saving geometrical solution to
the roof problem is indisputably bril-
liant. But all this does not automatically
make him either a good supervising
architect or a man who can control costs.
There can be no denying Mr Utzon’s
enthusiasm to spend money on his “most
wonderful building in the world”. He
said three years ago: “I wish that cost did
not matter. The value of this opera
house cannot be estimated. You people
in Sydney are doing what the old cities
of Europe are scared to do. This is a
beautiful story.” It has also proved an
expensive one.
The charges against Mr Utzon gener-
ally relate to the huge increase in costs
from the ludicrously low estimate of
$7.2 million by the quantity surveyors,
Rider Hunt, in 1957, to the $9.8 million
of the 1960 Opera House Act (a guess
that Utzon did not participate in), to
the $25 million of 1962 (which Utzon
said was the first estimate that had any
basis) to the current $5O million, which
seems certain to be substantially in-
creased.
fThtE cost rises for the experimental part
of the Opera House probably can
be well defended; that is the roof and
the ceiling, and the glass cladding at the
ends of what are still loosely called shells.
It may be aggravating that the cost of
developing these techniques will be borne
by the people of NSW, although the
rest of the world will use them freely,
but at least it can be satisfactorily ex-
plained, if not entirely justified.
Mr Utzon, along with the engineering
consultants, Ove Arup, must take some
responsibility for this $l5 million rise
in costs of the “conventional” part of the
building.
To some extent these cost rises were
due to increasing the things required,
such as external works of $2.8 million,
which were added in the 1965 estimate,
and to the Opera House Committee
changing its mind.
So while it is apparent that Mr Utzon’s
contribution to these mounting costs has
been grossly exaggerated and that un-
avoidable problems created most of the
cost rises, there seems little doubt that
had more efficient methods been adopted
within the field of Mr Utzon’s operations,
cost savings could have taken place.
An example of Mr Utzon’s ad hoc de-
signing is that by the end of last year
the consulting engineers had still not re-
ceived instructions from the architect on
the structural design of the ceilings. The
engineers had been obliged to build the
roof, knowing that Mr Utzon intended
to suspend his ceiling from it, but with-
out knowing how or where. The hanging
points he outlined in his plywood pro-
posal for the ceiling that they rejected
bore no relation to the points Arup’s had
provided under Utzon’s directions when
they put up the shells.
In Mr Utzon’s defence it is claimed
that it was he who suffered financially by
his perfectionism, as his determination to
do things “104 times if necessary to get
it exactly right” (to quote one of the
Utzonites at the recent Sydney Town
Hall meeting) did not mean any increase
in his fees—unless his final answer in-
creased the construction cost on which
he was getting a percentage. In many
cases, it did.
There can be no doubt that Utzon’s
office is lagging behind with its drawings
—and that is not simply because the
Minister will not allow mock-ups, which
sounds like a chicken and egg proposi-
tion. Mr Utzon’s refusal to proffer
acceptable working drawings for the
mock-up is hard to understand.
There can be no disputing Utzon’s
design delays for stage 3. Back in 1962
Mr Ryan had said that working draw-
ings for the third stage would be com-
pleted in 1963, and that work on the
third stage would proceed simultaneously
with the completion of the second stage.
But so far not one working drawing for
the third stage has been submitted to the
Government.
The architect claims to have solved
the problem of acoustics, but he has not
yet presented any report to the Govern-
ment on this, although it was pressing
for one., If there really are satisfactory
acoustic results already achieved on
models of the small hall, it is going to
be hard for Utzon to convince anyone
that he has not developed his plans for
its ceiling well enough to hand them
over.
If Mr Hughes is having trouble getting
drawings out of Mr Utzon, the Labor
Government had the same problem. Last
November, Mr Renshaw claimed that
when Premier he too had told the archi-
tect that work would not proceed on
stage 3 until he had received a full and
comprehensive description of the pro-
posals and the state of the planning; that
the whole of stage 3 had been fully
designed and there was no doubt about
the construction procedure. This was be-
cause of his experience with the increases
of costs for stages 1 and 2. Mr Ren-
shaw’s statement seems to confirm Mr
Hughes’ problems with Mr Utzon.
A large part of the blame for Mr
Utzon’s departure appears to be with Mr
Utzon himself. The real reason for his
resignation appears to rest less on the
specific matters he has listed in his letters
to Mr Hughes and more on what he
considers to be Mr Hughes’ general “lack
of respect” for him as the architect. This
seems largely the result of Mr Utzon’s
feeling that Mr Hughes’ representatives
on the site. Messrs R. A. P. Johnson and
W. W. Wood, are not at all sympathetic
to his whole concept. But this is a case
where the architect must become some-
thing of a politician—and the politician
something of a psychologist.
People who know Utzon well say that
no matter what conditions he had re-
mained under, he would still have dom-
inated the whole project because of the
force of his personality, so that there was
really no need for all the fuss in the
first place.
consultant engineers, OVE ARUP
AND PARTNERS, have not entered
into the dispute, although their local
partner, Mr Michael Lewis, has become
the meat in the sandwich. The Utzonites
have been complaining about him as
unco-operative, with Mr Ryan even ad-
vising the Minister in Parliament not to
waste time with the local Arup represent-
ative but to go direct to London. On
the other hand, it seems the Minister has
been less Than fair to Mr Lewis, too.
The Ove Arup objections to Utzon’s
plywood plans are believed to be simple.
They do not like the idea of the material,
which has to be exactly right in surface
and positioning for acoustical reasons,
also being the structural material; they
say that the weight of the plywood panels
(10 tons each) will be far too great for
the roof from which they are to be hung,
where weight limits are 60 lb per square
foot, while the plywood as suggested
requires 200 lb. a square foot; that there
is no way of lifting these huge panels
inside the shells without building exten-
sive equipment.
Arup’s alternative scheme, it is
claimed, would make for better acoustics
than Utzon’s (according to the consult-
ants), would not present intolerable
stresses on the roof and would look ex-
actly the same. It involves attaching ply-
wood sheets to steel formwork, rather
than making the plywood the actual
structure itself. This would mean that
one skin of plywood inside would act as
reverberation instrument while another
layer outside the steel work would act
as a sound barrier against outside noises
coming in. The judgment of the Ove
Arup group is world-renowned; its views
cannot lightly be dismissed.
HFhe Renshaw Labor Government, its
A Minister for Works, Mr P. N. Ryan,
and former Premiers, Mr Heffron and
Mr Cahill, are charged with having al-
lowed costs to rise by their laxity and
mismanagement, and of keeping the truth
of the situation from the public.
Mr Ryan, under whose administra-
tion most of the cost increases took
place, was in the unfortunate position
of being saddled with the project but


not being able to bridle Mr Utzon, for
fear that a resignation would give the
Opposition a political present par-
ticularly if dirty linen was washed.
The late Mr Cahill, who authorised
the project’s start, has been blamed for
most of the $l2 million or so that Mr
Davis Hughes says was wasted by
Labor maladministration of the Opera
House.
There is no doubt that construction
costs would have been much lower if
the building had not been started under
Cahill’s insistence long before complete
drawings had been prepared for the first
stage. Building began against profession-
al advice, and the stop-go nature of the
work added materially to the cost. The
subsequent demolition of the supporting
columns for the roof was a result of this
hasty procedure.
Ove Arup says: “The job began too
early. It’s the kind of job we could
design for 10 years but we didn’t have
half a year before the foundations went
in. They should not have gone in until
we knew about the shells. It was done
the wrong way around. We had no idea
Utzon's design of one step of the fan-shaped staircase-like acoustical reflector. - From "Zodiac".
until well after the contractor had
started that stage machinery worth $3.2
million was to go in”.
But there were good reasons for that
haste. Mr Cahill only just had the num-
bers; it was vital to use them to get it
under way. It was touch and go in the
State Labor Caucus, which passed by
only 24 votes to 17 in May, 1957, a
resolution recommending the early con-
struction of the Opera House and re-
questing Mr Cahill to take immediate
steps to launch an appeal.
Such was the haste that the Govern-
ment authorised the spending of $2.8
million two years before Parliament had
approved it. Once on the tiger, there was
no holding it.
As the costs rose, Mr Heffron said
in 1962: “Reducing costs could not
have been done without grave detriment
to the efficiency and aesthetic appeal of
the building and this the Government
was not prepared to do. The Government
is determined that the completed project
will be one worthy of the State and
commanding the interest and admiration
of the world”.
Ove Arup agreed: “I don’t know
how you could do anything to cheapen
it without spoiling the idea. You can’t
just compromise. It’s the most marvel-
lous thing that has been built this cen-
tury”.
But there continued to be public
doubts over waste, over “loss of produc-
tivity”, over unexplained additions to
costs and refusals to accept the lowest
tenders. The dispute over lighting has
never satisfactorily been settled, with
Strand Electric Ltd {well-known and
respected in overseas theatrical circles)
complaining bitterly about Siemens get-
ting the contract for almost double
Strand’s tender price of $468,000, on
the recommendation of the architect.
The Labor Governments have a case to
answer.
Tt seems certain that the NSW Labor
**■ Government had no idea of what it
was letting itself in for over the Opera
House. The late Mr Eric Saarinen, one
of the judges of the Opera House com-
petition, must take at least part of the
responsibility for the Government’s mis-
conception that the building could be
erected fairly cheaply.
If, as has been published, it is a fact
that an estimate of $7.4 million was pre-
pared on a simple area formula (based
on costs of conventional buildings), Mr
Saarinen must have had doubts about
its accuracy for this design. The esti-
mate on a similar basis for the second
prize was $ll.B million and the third
was $ 15.6 m., so the assessors added that
their first prize winner was the cheapest
to build!
Ove Arup has said: “It was impossible
to estimate the costs of the Opera House
on the first sketches. No-one knew what
the final shape would be. The 1962 esti-
mate was the first that had been possible
to make (this was of $25 million).
However, the design was chosen
unanimously out of 217 entries by the
four judges. Professor H. Ingham Ash-
worth, then of Sydney University; Pro-
fessor J. L. Martin of Cambridge; Mr
Saarinen, the famous Finnish-American
architect, ana Mr Cobden Parks, then
State Government Architect.
But it was Eric Saarinen who really
awarded the prize to Mr Utzon. When
Saarinen arrived in Australia four days
after judging began, his fellow judges
had limited the field to 10 entries, none
of which appealed to him, so he went
into the corner where the rejects were
and came up in a couple of hours with
Utzon’s. He quickly convinced his col-
leagues as to its excellence.
Among the disqualifications the judges
ignored were: “If the cost of the scheme
is excessive; if it exceeds the limit of
the site; if it is not drawn and submit-
ted in the manner specified”. It was, in
fact, only a sketch that had to be drawn
up by a Sydney University lecturer be-
fore it could be shown to the public.
11/fR Stan Haviland’s Opera House
Committee has been attacked by
the Utzonites as bumbling and incom-
petent. Its continuing changes of mind
about what it wanted have clearly added
to the cost, and no doubt irritated the
architect and consulting engineer. For
example, the decision to change the main
hall seating after the outlines of the floor
had been constructed in concrete steps
means that it will now have a false floor
built on top, at a cost of many
thousands of dollars, apart from the
huge expense of designing a balcony to
fit in where none had been before.
Even now, the Committee has not yet
got around to telling the architect what
it would like in the restaurant, although
the roof is already up. As a result, the
builders have left holes here and there
in the floor in the hope they may fit In
with any plans.
Much of the criticism of the Com-
mittee ends up at the door of its chair-
man, Mr Stanley Haviland, former presi-
dent of the Water Board. With his
experience in public works it would
have been expected that he could have
done something more to keep costs and
procedures in control.
The effectiveness of the Committee is
evident from its failure to hold its March
meeting despite the Utzon crisis (in which
it could have played a real role) be-
cause so many members were away.

the Opera House and in what way are

still unanswered. There is still no general
manager, no arrangement with the cir-
cuits, the theatre managements and so
on. Only the ABC is settled as a regular
tenant, and it does not appear entirely
happy.
HThe charge against Mr Seidler and the
A Utzonites is that in exaggerated and
emotional outbursts they have clouded
the issue, have forced Utzon into a
position where compromise is difficult,
and so are effectively removing his
chances of finishing his masterpiece.
HThe charges against critics like Mr
A Walter Bunning and Professor Cowan
are that they have criticised the whole
project in a way that is likely to have
reduced the public’s appreciation of the
building and its willingness to pay for
it to be built. It is claimed that Mr
Bunning’s attacks on the stage space,
machinery and acoustics are not based
on expert knowledge.
However, as architecture the Opera
House can be argued to be bad, and the
designer has not attempted to defend
it as such. It is a sculpture, and he
speaks of it as a sculpture.
Walter Bunning has claimed the
functional arrangements of Utzon’s win-
ning design are utterly unworkable.
He says those seated in the back row
have to walk up a height of about 60ft
from the street level to the back seats —
equivalent to a six-storey building,
although he concedes there will be lifts
for those that need them.
But Mr Bunning’s criticisms cut across
some very expert advice. The project
has been drawing on the skills of about
70 specialist advisers on stage design and
acoustics.
On acoustics, Roger Covell reported
last October (the Australian public has
found out more about the actual work-
ings of the Opera House through informa-
tion gleaned by its newspapers than in
any statements from the Opera House
Committee or the Government) that the
acoustic tests on a mock-up of the smaller
hall in Germany had been entirely satis-
factory, but that changes were being
made in the ideas for the major hall. “I
have never felt so cheerful about the
musical and theatrical prospects of the
two main halls as I have after meeting
Professors Cremer and Gabler and Mr
Much” the three consultants who Mr
Utzon says will only carry on if Utzon
remains in charge.
My direction to the people of New
South Wales is that Utzon must stay . . ,
on Hughes’ terms.


HAWKE
'Hyde Park Cicero'or
Defender of the Faith?
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Melbourne’s Little Bourke Street
has been known in former days
for rather more ill-famed institu-
tions than the Arbitration Commission
and the High Court of Australia which
face each other in the block between
Queen and William Streets; but about
the worst that happens these days is a
mild wharfies’ demonstration in favor of
a basic wage rise, or a quiet game of
fan-tan in the Chinese quarter.
However, behind the tranquil facade,
and inside the sober chambers of the
Arbitration Commission,
one of the most import-
ant cases in Australian
arbitration history is
now being judged. The
1966 basic wage and
margins case wfill largely
determine the future of
both industrial relations
in this country and the
Arbitration Commission
itself.
The fluent, acute re-
search officer and ad-
vocate for the ACTU,
Mr R. J. L. (“Bob”)
Hawke, told the Com-
mission last week that
the trade union move-
ment “had lost a lot of
faith in the arbitration
system 5 because of the
1965 national wage case
decision which departed
from previous procedures
of wage fixation. He ex-
plained to the Full
Bench that he was not
so much attacking the
meagre rise granted last year as the
principles on which it was based.
Hawke spent almost the first three
weeks of the hearing making a sentence
by sentence analysis of last year’s
majority judgment of Judges Gallagher,
Sweeney and Nimmo: a penetrating and
trenchant analysis which has resulted in
frequent clashes between himself and
Judge Gallagher, the sole representative
of last year’s majority trio sitting on the
present Bench.
He has claimed that the ACTU re-
gards the 1965 judgment as being:
• In conflict with the law which created
the Commission;
• in conflict with the Commonwealth
Constitution;
• ignorant of economic realities;
• self-contradictory in its major pro-
posals;
® biased against the unions, and out-
rageous in its practical implications.
In the process Hawke has told the
Bench, namely Judges Wright, Moore,
and Gallagher (assisted by Commissioner
Winter for the margins part of the case),
that one sentence in last year’s majority
decision was “nothing more than hum-
bug”, and that the Commission was in
danger of acting out “meaningless char-
ades”. Judge Gallagher has in turn re-
buked the ACTU advocate—“ Domain
Demosthenes”; “Hyde Park Cicero”
for “misrepresenting” and “distorting”
the decision made by himself and Judges
Sweeney and Nimmo.
The following is one of the many
exchanges which have enlivened pro-
ceedings.
Judge Gallagher: You are indulging
in a series of diatribes, each getting
worse than the one preceding it.
Mr Hawke: One has to make the obser-
vation, your Honor, that that is a matter
of opinion.
His Honor: It is a matter of fact so far
as I am concerned . . .
Hawke: I have obviously incurred the
displeasure of his Honor. I am unhappy
that this has been the result.
His Honor: 1 did speak about diatribe
and one expression was your reference
to absolute humbug.
Hawke: 1 think we would both be assisted
if you could explain where, in your
opinion, the judgment is right and I
am wrong in what I put.
His Honor: How I should deal with your
arguments or those of anyone else is a
matter for my determination . . . How
can it be said, Mr Hawke, as a reason-
able person, that you can
refer to a judgment as
being absolute humbug
without importing per-
sonalities?
Mr Hawke: What is said
is humbug, because it is
not directed towards the
things at issue. I am
going to continue to
analyse the judgment as
I see fit.
Judge Gallagher: And I
shall continue to com-
ment as I see fit.
Apart from condemn-
ing in substance and
detail the decision of
last year, Hawke has told
the Commission that,
whilst he does not wish
to be understood as
issuing a threat to the
Commission, unless there
is a return to the prin-
ciples which operated
from 1961 to 1964 in-
clusive, the unions may
be forced to abandon the
Arbitration system.
“It is an exercise in pious hope for any
member of the Commission to ask the
unions to have any faith in a Com-
mission which is going to hand down a
judgment which puts them back in a
situation where the real value of award
wages is going to decline.”
Threat or not, Hawke’s remarks are
not idle. After the decision of last year’s
Bench, Hawke and moderate union ele-
ments were able, only by the narrowest of
margins, to persuade the ACTU to go to
Arbitration again this year, rather than
adopt direct action tactics.
There is nothing exaggerated in his
warning that if at least the principles of
the union case are not substantially ac-

cepted, the unions may in future by-
pass the Commission. Responsible ACTU
leaders feel that since 1965 arbitration
is not so much at the cross-roads as in a
dead-end.
The division of opinion about the
direction and nature of arbitration,
which separates employees and em-
ployers, is also clearly mirrored in the
attitudes of the Commission judges. The
minority decisions of Chief Judge Kirby
and Judge Moore in the 1965 national
wage case revealed general acceptance
of the union view that rises in the basic
wage ought to be primarily determined
by rises in prices and increases in produc-
tivity. This “prices plus productivity”
approach contrasts with the employers’
formula accepted by Judges Gallagher,
Sweeney and Nimmo, a formula usually
termed “the capacity of industry to pay”
(although it would be more realistic to
call it “the capacity and price stability”
formula).
A sub-legislator?
attack launched by Hawke in his
opening address to the Commission
on March 9 was that the 1965 majority
decision was based on a misunderstand-
ing of the whole character and function
of the Commission. According to the
Arbitration Act and the Constitution the
Commission was a tribunal set up to
prevent and to settle industrial disputes.
Therefore, the Commission should act on
the origins and economic realities of dis-
putes and “should not attempt to play
the role of an economic sub-legislator”.
Here Hawke uncovered the source of the
division on the Bench, the division re-
sponsible for the differences between all
of the basic wage and margins judg-
ments from 1961 to 1964 and the
majority judgment of 1965.
One group on the Commission feel
they must be chiefly concerned with in-
dustrial peace and justice and therefore
believe that wage rises must be granted
if increases in prices and productivity
can be proven. Without neglecting the
economic importance of the decisions,
they feel that these economic con-
sequences on general monetary policy,
on prices, and on exports are something
for the Treasury and the Reserve Bank
to deal with.
The other group of judges are basi-
cally concerned to judge whether claims
on the capacity of industry to pay are
compatible with price stability. A key
passage in the majority judgment last
year reads:
“We have decided to grant wage in-
creases which we consider will not be
incompatible with price stability, be-
cause, in our view, any wage increase
granted at the present time without due
regard to this question would not confer
a real or lasting benefit upon wage or

salary earners. The Commission cannot,
of course, guarantee price stability but
it should in present economic circum-
stances take care not to make decisions
which it recognises as a threat to it.”
There are, of course, a number of
other differences between members of
the Commission, between employers and
employees, and between the Common-
wealth and all parties, but the question
of whether the Commission is to be
concerned, in the last resort, with indus-
trial and social justice, or economic
stability, is paramount.
These deep-rooted differences in con-
ceptions of the role of the Commission
have been evident for many years.
Despite the fact that the Federal Con-
stitution states that the Commonwealth
may make laws with regard to “con-
ciliation and arbitration for the preven-
tion and settlement of industrial disputes
extending beyond the limits of any one
State”, Chief Judge Kelly is on record
as saying in his minority, dissenting,
judgment, in the 1950 Basic Wage case:
“The rapid deterioration in the value of
money must, perhaps even with some
serious sacrifice on the part of all, be ar-
rested. Failure to arrest it will surely
endanger this unbalanced economy . . .
There are other steps necessary to be
taken by other authorities charged, as
well as this court, with such action as
will adjust, so as to eventually femove,
the effects of our unbalanced economy.
Their existence, even their inaction, in
some regard, to date does not absolve
this court from doing what it under-
stands to be its particular duty. I believe
that today its duty is to give a lead to
the other instruments of adjustment . . .
for it is undoubtedly principally owing
to the rapidly increasing level of wages,
both nominal and real, that costs and
prices are now tending to become out
of control.”
Apart from noting the simplistic
notion of the Chief Judge of the re-
lationship between wages and prices it
is of importance to contrast this quasi-
legislative view of the functions of the
Arbitration Court with the opinion of
Judge Foster, who was a member of the
majority in the same case:
“. . . inflation and its control are mat-
ters for the Government and. it may be
argued, a little remote from the court’s
immediate task.”
In the 1953 wage case Chief Judge
Kelly’s attitudes prevailed over those
which had formed the previous tradition
of the Court and the automatic cost-of-
living adjustment was abolished.
From 1953 until 1960 the Arbitration
Commission was clearly more con-
cerned with price stability and inflation
than with basic industrial and social
issues.
By 1960 union feeling was running
high. The ACTU Federal Unions Con-
ference called the Basic Wage judgment
of that year “cowardly, evasive and
spurious”. But twelve months later this
arbitration tradition of the 1950 s was
reversed
Chief Judge Kirby and Judges Ash-
burner and Moore, who constituted the
1961 Commission, increased the basic
wage by 12/- a week, but, more sig-
nificantly, they refused to consider them-
selves as primarily economic policy-
makers.
They denied the views of former Chief
Judge Kelly, declaring:
“We are not national policy makers
or planners.”
T ,
* n °™ er to retain the real value of
wages the Commission declared that it
would accept a prima facie case for an-
nual wage adjustments according to move-
ments in the Consumer it
would also grant a general basic wage
review every three or four years. The
principle of wage fixation by estimating
“Prices plus productivity” has returned:

Prices to be considered annually; pro-
ductivity less often.
Last year the wheel turned again, with
Judges Gallagher, Sweeney and Nimmo
the helmsmen. The majority of 1965
Basic Wage Enquiry Bench, in a judg-
ment whose working is not always trans-
parent, granted what amounted to a li
per cent margins increase, and reflected
the principle that price increases were
necessary grounds for wages increases,
and thus abandoned the “prices plus
productivity” formula for “price stabil-
ity”. The economic cares of the Commis-
sion, it was alleged, had again triumphed
over its industrial functions and powers.
In the neat minority judgment of Judge
Moore the roots of the trouble were
partly uncovered. He notes that the
chief objects of the Conciliation and
Arbitration Act are to promote goodwill
in industry, to encourage conciliation, to
provide means for preventing and set-
tling industrial disputes, etc., but he adds
“In the Act there are references to
the interests ... of society as a whole,
and to the public interest, which are of
great importance to the Commission’s
functions” (my italics).
Competing priorities
Judge Moore continues: “It is a ques-
tion of competing priorities; whether the
Commission should act as if its primary
function were to attempt to create or
sustain a favorable economic climate” or
to “attempt to resolve the problems of in-
dustrial relations.” As he indicates, there
is an ambiguity in the Arbitration Act
itself which, depending on the pressures
and prejudices involved, allows of con-
trasting interpretations.
Apart from the Constitutional difficul-
ties involved and in the light of the
present Act, however, Chief Judge,
Kirby and Judge Moore in their 1965
minority judgments are in no doubt
about the nature of their priorities:
“The Commonwealth and public
bodies such as the Reserve Bank are in
an entirely different position. They can
and should give to price stability the
dominance . . . they think proper. This
Commission should not . . . act in a way
so as deliberately to frustrate Govern-
mental policy but it must give priority
to its task of fixing just and reasonable
wages.” (Kirby C. J.); “In my view the
Commission should always give priority
to problems of industrial relations” (J.
Moore).
Apart from the question of its priori-
ties the 1965 majority judgment has been
attacked from a number of other direc-
tions. Juniors and those at the bottom of
the wage scale who have no margin get
no increase; those with an award rate
just above the basic wage got a 5/- in-
crease; those on £4O per week got an
increase of 12/- in margins, the full
amount claimed by the ACTU. Thus the
union claim for protection of the wages
of those at the bottom of the real wage
scale was met with an increase which
benefited those further up the scale. In
addition, the majority concerns for prices
before wages means that when other in-
flationary pressures (besides wages)
operate on the economy the wage earner,
and the lowest wage earner at that,
suffers the most.
Such a consequence seems in conflict
with the Arbitration Commission’s func-
tion, as set out in the Act, to promote
industrial harmony and justice.
These and other apparent incongruities
in the 1965 judgment presumably ac-
count for the vehement language of
ACTU advocate Hawke in the case now
under consideration.
The ACTU believes that the present
Presidential Bench of Judges Wright,
Gallagher and Moore may reverse last
year’s decision. Judge Moore has strong-
ly , indicated his preference for the
“prices plus productivity” approach in
the past, and although Judge Gallagher
was one of the majority last year, Judge
Wright in a case in 1963 indicated sym-
pathy for the views of Judge Moore.
Further, Hawke has addressed so much
of his present advocacy to Judge Gal-
lagher that it is clear he believes that
Judge Gallagher may be persuaded by
the union case this time.
If Hawke loses the ACTU will be
subjected to strong Left-wing pressures
to abandon the Arbitration Commission
in the matter of wages and margins and
to adopt a policy of direct action. Com-
munist and Left-wing unions will then
demand a £22 basic wage from em-
ployers, reinforcing their demands with
widespread stoppages.
If the 1965 judgment is not reversed
other trade union forces will also be
forced to swing to a policy of collective
bargaining. There is, of course, a great
deal of collective bargaining at the
moment, The Arbitration Commission is
only one of the arenas of negotiation
for wages and conditions. However,
moderate trade union leaders realise that
if collective bargaining became as im-
portant in Australia as it is, for example,
in the United States and Canada there
would be much less protection for wor-
kers of low skill and little qualifications
and the weaker unions would suffer at
the bargaining tables. To judge from ex-
perience in other countries under collec-
tive bargaining the stronger may prosper
but the weaker often go to the wall.

Who shot a builseye

Burroughs
Burroughs computers on the job at Cape Kennedy have
taken part in every U.S. space shot and missile test. The
impressive tally? More than 300 shots with 100% computer
success.
From complex tests such as these, Burroughs scientists,
mathematicians and researchers have developed highly
advanced computer systems for commercial use. Systems
with the same bullseye accuracy. The same ultra-reliability.
For example: Burroughs recently developed an Electronic
Data Processing System that does the job of three com-
puters. Capable of handling simultaneously On-Line work,
Off-Line work and Multiprocessing. But that's only part of
the story about Burroughs new 8300 Electronic Data Pro-

Left Turn
llThen writer Frank Hardy, “that bloody bastard”, was in
” Moscow he had told him, Yevtushenko, that he was a
real “Sydney bloke.” So at his recital at the University of
NSW theatre, at which these two phrases were the only
evidence that the Russian poet knows any English, Evgenii
Yevtushenko was prepared, up to a point, to be a real
Sydney bloke.
The theatre is university anonymous. The audience of
about 800 was also university anonymous, a large proportion
of enthusiastic young people and a sprinkling of relentlessly
youthful academics. Here and there were poets Rosemary
Dobson, Douglas Stewart, Elizabeth Riddell.
The five people on the platform provided an interesting
run-through in style. There was the poet, casual in sailor’s
jacket and grey slacks alongside him, his interpreter,
Madame Oksana KrugersKaya, in her Moscow version of
the little black dress, then Hardy, well, out of the old-style
Left-wing bell-bottoms but still a good deal less elegant
than actor Alan Edwards and finally Dame Judith Anderson,
alert and elegant in glittering blue.
The performance began slowly. The poet took earnest
sips from a bottle of cough mixture. Rain drummed on the
roof. Planes droned overhead. A microphone had to be
changed. Yevtushenko declined, after Alan Edwards had
read it in English, to recite in Russian the ballad about
sailors getting drunk on eau de cologne instead of vodka,
because, his interpreter said, “he might break down in
laughter.” Is that a well-rehearsed bit of business?
But by the end of the evening both the poet and his
audience were thoroughly warmed up. There were no
questions, but there was a long speech from Yevtushenko,
hurrying far ahead of his interpreter. If he had helped us to
understand his people a little bit more, he said, he was
happy. The best view of a people is always embodied in their
best representatives He did not consider himself one of his
country's best representatives. He mentioned journalists —-
sharp, he said, as Roquefort cheese. They had asked questions
for which he had no answers. The best place, he said, to
find solutions to some things was in the country in which
the problems arose. But he had not evaded the questions
because he was afraid. Russia, he said, might have had to
borrow wheat; she had never had to borrow bravery.
Yevtushenko, who to his audience sounded inevitably
as if he were about to burst into “Dark Eyes”, may not,
as his critics say, be a great poet. But as an entertainer, it
would be hard to find a critic to touch him. —P.R.

WINE OF THE MONTH
The Right Side of
the Tracks
Jammy no longer
By CELLARMASTER
“ A nd the Shiraz comes from Above The
A Line!”
“Above the line?”
“Above The Line. A railway line. It
runs through the vineyards. The Shiraz
from the higher area is of great quality.
Most of it is the original planting with
the vines well over 100 years old. The
yield is low, less than a ton per acre,
but the quality makes up for it.”
This viticultural aristocrat, so obvious-
ly from the right side of the tracks, is
the basis of my April Wine of the
Month, Saltrams Bin 33 Claret,
Vintage 1962, which isn’t a claret
anyway, or a burgundy either, but
is a magnificent red wine.
Peter Lehmann, the winemaker
and manager at Saltrams, a cheerful
light heavyweight with a face lined
like a dried mud flat, is proud of this
wine. He is proud of all his wine, but
particularly of this one, since it represents
a culmination of efforts made to lighten
the once formidable wines of Saltram.
Years ago a Frenchman tasted a Sal-
tram Dry Red and declared: “Mag-
nifique! A lovely wine! Is this in Aus-
tralia what you call Port?” For the
wines from the Saltram vineyards were
big, so big that they could be spread on
bread, full of extractive matter, body
and guts. The flavors were there all right,
a whole multiplicity of them, each striv-
ing for attention and clamoring for
recognition. The result was summed up
in the elaborate phrase that wine judges
love to use . . . “Jammy!”
Lehmann, son of a Lutheran pastor
and wine-man all his life (no contradic-
tion in the Barossa Valley!), took over
the Saltrams Winery in 1960 after thir-
teen years with Rudi Kronberger at
Yalumba. With the rising demand for
good red wines and his own particular
interest in them, he immediately set
about lightening the style. Several good
wines resulted, many of them still avail-
able. But of them all I have chosen the
Bin 33 as the best.
It is a blend of many wines, each
made and matured separately. Shiraz
from the Saltram vineyards is married
with equal parts of Eden Valley Shiraz,
and Cabernet and Dolcetto from their
own vineyards at Angaston. The grapes
from the Eden Valley, which flanks the
Barossa, are grown at a higher altitude,
with subsequent cooler nights, and this
results in less sugar concentration and
more acid and delicacy. The Cabernet
material adds flavor and style, and I’ve
no idea what the Dolcetto does. From its
name it has probably something to do
with softening.
In fact, the Bin 33 Claret is so soft
it isn’t really a claret at all. In the last
Adelaide Show in the Claret classes it
was pointed down for being slightly out
of style, though the judges agreed that
it was remarkably good. But what does
this name-naming matter to us? A
red is a red. As Peter Lehmann
says, “While the wine is making its
mind up, we will call it a claret.
Clarets sell better!”
But while the wine is exercising
this privilege, it is extremely good
drinking Better still, it will improve
for years, and bottle maturation (it was
only bottled July last year) will further
develop the already pronounced flavor.
The finish has that slow soft tannin grip
so much admired overseas, and this will
hold the wine up and prevent it falling
away. Foundation garments yet.
Anyway, I’m buying some.

THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN'S GUIDE
Singular Woman &
Sophisticated Man
I once spent a terrible year in a place
I always think of as the French
Marches a hinterland of over-
grown bombed villages, barbed wired sour
wildernesses and giant, tidy cemeteries,
between Verdun and the Luxembourg-
German borders. During that time, my
contacts with the world were largely
limited to conversation with the French
butcher (reputedly the village police
spy), meetings with the local NATO
forces (I have never quite recovered
from their Christmas cards, emblazoned
“Strike and kill Merry Xmas!”
“Fangs of Death Happy Xmas!”), and
an American magazine called “The Re-
porter” in which I read about the state of
the Union, corruption in Laos (at a
time when the name meant nothing, and
the cloud of war in South-East Asia
wasn’t even the size of a baby’s fist), and
the articles of Marya Mannes. ,
At the time these articles gave me a
pleasant sense of contact with an ener-
getic and independent mind. Now that
they are collected together, with others,
as “But Will It Sell?”, I have more
reservations.
To collect journalistic pieces together
is always risky. But I don’t think that
these suffer from faded topicality the
people who complained back in 1960
about the interruptions to their TV horse
operas for the sake of “trivial program-
mes about astronauts” are still complain-
ing, according to this week’s newspapers,
about interruptions to “Batman” in favor
of Gemini 8.
I think Marya Mannes suffers more
from a single and unrelieved tone. She
tries to set us right when she reminds us
that solemnity and seriousness, wit and
insincerity are not co-extensive. But, alas,
her own wit is pretty solemn, and she
does better, really, when she is talking
straightforwardly, as in the piece called
“The Singular Woman”, about her own
life and her own attitudes.
“The Singular Woman” is an unhec-
toring plea for individuality, for a more
complex image for both men and women.
It asks us to make allowance for the
woman who is largely masculine and for
the man who is largely feminine, who
may not want to conform to the current
ideal of child-orientated, money-directed,
suburban domesticity, but may just want
to be left alone to get on with their own
versions of life and not be made to feel
guilty about it.
The term “largely masculine” may be
question-begging, but the case she makes
for such a woman not trying to be
“everything” “mother, wife, lover,
chef, servant, hostess” and “creative” as
well, is a lively one, and might help
young people to whom she says she
addresses most of her remarks to
clear their minds of some lumber.
In general, Marya Mannes is better at
diagnosing the illness than she is at
suggesting even a placebo. Her attacks
on commercial manipulation, especially
of children by TV, are trenchant and
well documented. Advertisement: Mum
comes in with a heaping platter of some-
thing, her brood of kids chorus, “Gee,
Mom, we wanted fried chicken!” and
Mum, outnumbered anyway, skips back
to the kitchen, chucks out the first dinner,
and smilingly produces the chicken in-
stead of a smart clip over the ear.
Ninety-four per cent of mothers inter-
viewed, according to an article in “The
New York Times”, said their children
demanded that they buy certain items
they had seen advertised on TV.
Her accounts of the mindless violence
that resulted in the torture and murder
of a helpless Negro bum by four adoles-
cents (the eldest of whom, aged 19, had
been diagnosed as a psychopathic per-
sonality from the age of 6, but his parents
couldn't bear to accept his “abnormality”
and refused to have him treated) and in
the beating to death of a passing Korean
student by a Negro gang, are moving and
unsensational.
But when she gets round to things like
“The Sophisticated Man” the one for
whom the “Singular Woman” longs and
waits she makes him sound (I fear,
unintentionally) like an advertisement for
an interior decorator “I suspect, more-
over, the too-neat room, for it can imply
a certain barrenness. The sophisticated
man has many passions, and I salute
them in the two-foot pile of magazines on

Why do so many businessmen fly TAA?
Because TAA is a successful
business enterprise
TAA is a business enterprise required
to make a profit and pay a dividend just
like any other commercial undertaking.
And people naturally prefer to do business
with sound, competent enterprises.
The Airline is operated by the Australian
National Airlines Commission, in the same way
as a public company is controlled by a board of
directors.
71% DIVIDEND
TAA has a capital of $15,000,000, unchanged
since 1961.
Out of a net profit for 1964/65 of $1,409,052
TAA’s 74% dividend to the Treasury absorbs
$1,125,000.
TAA PAYS TAX
TAA is subject to income tax, payroll tax, sales
tax, etc., normally met by other commercial en-
terprises, and has to pay special tax on aviation
fuel and air route charges as well.
In its operation TAA enjoys no special privi-
leges over its competitors. TAA must win every
passenger and pound of air cargo in open business
competition.
BUSINESS EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater overall
share of the competitive passenger market is in-
dicative of TAA’s business efficiency.
The continued business success of TAA helps
to preserve the competition vital to a healthy
airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that every Austra-
lian will continue to enjoy the right to choose by
which airline he will fly, or consign air cargo.
Competition also helps maintain the highest
standards of service for Australian air travellers.
Supporters of free enterprise, in placing busi-
ness with TAA, are preserving for themselves
these benefits of business competition in the air-
line industry.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Sulks in the Bedroom
There is a fascinating difference
between English and American
television. The most popular
English programmes deal with those
people who are on the borderline of
poverty. Unquestionably there is
satisfaction to be had in observing
those who are less well off than our-
selves, as in “Steptoe and Son”, “Z
Cars” and “Coronation Street”. On
the other hand, with American TV
nothing must obscure the great Ame-
rican ideal. Even the depressed people
must have money. So we get a pro-
gramme like the Beverly Hillbillies.
When I put this proposition to Pat
Phoenix, the Elsie Tanner of “Coron-
ation Street”, she took off as if I were
Ena Sharpies. “The difference is that
our television is about real people, not
just slick-up stuff. Maybe the houses
in ‘Coronation Street’ don’t have a
bath or a decent 100, but they’re people
with courage and good
humor. ‘Coronation Street’
is not just a story any more,
it's part of history. We’re
showing the south of England
that the north is not all
Satanic mills, that we’ve got
emotions and feeling, that
we don’t really eat our young.”
You must appreciate that GTV-9
was the first Australian station to
take “Coronation Street” over here, so
Melbourne is really the “Coronation
Street” headquarters. Why, Miss
Phoenix, Jack Walker (Arthur Leslie)
and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) even
visited Coronation Street, West Foot-
scray, and called on a real Mrs Annie
Walker who lived at No. 90 Corona-
tion Street.
GTV-9 turned on a reception for
them in the banquet room at Menzies
and, what was considered a touch of
genius, they provided scones and jam
and cream. Miss Phoenix, who is
watching a waistline, settled for Diet-
ale. “I always drink gin at The
Rover’s”. So over her Dietale, Miss
Phoenix explained that on her per-
sonal appearance tours she usually
played the part of Elsie Tanner and
talked broad. One time at a lunch she
opened her speech: “Ladies and gentle-
men, I am very pleased ...” Some-
one called out, “Ahhh, come off it,
Elsie, be you. flaming self.”
This, however, could be a trap.
One day two women spotted her while
she was shopping and they said
“Look, 100k —there’s Elsie Tanner”.
Pat Phoenix said: “So I waved and
said ‘G’day ducks ’ow are you
luv\ Then one of them turned- to the
other and said, ‘There, what did I tell
ya, dead Commo’.”
Naturally one had to discover how
“Coronation Street” could possibly
continue without her. “I’m going
through an emotional disturbance and
I’ve gone into the sulks in my bed-
room.” But surely that couldn’t last
for four weeks? “It’s an emotional
disturbance of the worst kind.” What
about the other people who drifted in
and out of the programme? Why did
you have to kill off poor Mrs Barlow
in such brutal fashion? “It was getting
too much for her, you see. Her
husband and children all lived in
London and she was fed up with going
to Manchester all the time. So we had
to run her over.”
Miss Phoenix, however, made it
quite clear that “Coronation
Street” was a national in-
stitution, beloved by such
people as Harold Wilson and
destined to go on for ever.
She said they made the two
episodes together every week
and it was all done in four
days. They received their scripts
on the Monday and went through
them. On Tuesday they went through
them together and got everything
ready. On the Wednesday they had
the rehearsals and on the Thursday
they actually filmed the two half-
hour programmes.
She explained, too, how very seri-
ously people took the programme.
Whenever anyone had babies in the
story, scads of booties, blankets, baby
rattles and suchlike poured in. When
Mrs Barlow was kil’ed there were in
memoriam cards, wreaths and flowers.
“Then do you remember my sailor
boy friend?” she said. “He was about
six foot four. One day when he was
walking to the studio some men took
him aside and said ‘You do the
right thins bv our Elsie, or we’ll
thump yer behind the ear’.”
I was a little inclined to disbelieve
these stories until a gentleman inter-
rupted the interview. “Excuse me,”
he said, “I must ask you this. You very
much resemble a woman of the same
name I used to know in England. I
was wondering if you were a relative.”
It was hardly likely, because he ad-
dressed Pat Phoenix as Mrs Tanner.

OVERSEAS
Britain’s Unwanted
Election
By RONALD STEEL
With all the enthusiasm of a man
preparing to visit his mother-in-
law, the British are facing their
second general election in a year-and-a-
half. To ask whether this election is really
necessary is to broach the irrelevant.
The voters will be summoned to the
polls on March 31 not because Parlia-
ment’s time is up (actually it has another
three-and-a-half years to run) or be-
cause there is any governmental crisis
or because the Opposition is champing
at the bit—but simply because the
leaders of the Labor party think the time
is right to increase their slender majority
in Commons.
They may well be right, for polls give
Labor a heady lead over the Tories —
one which, translated into Parliamentary
seats, could produce a 50-100 vote major-
ity in Commons. Small wonder they have
been eager to summon the voters back
to the polls again: with a majority of
that size they can stay comfortably in
office until 1971.
The public, however, has failed to
share the excitement shown by news-
paper columnists and political candidates.
Indeed, this election has given every sign
of being about as popular as the one
Lester Pearson called in Canada last year
when his advisers erroneously told him
that the country was panting to increase
his parliamentary majority. And it may
even have similar results.
Among those who are least enthusias-
tic of all about the forthcoming elections
are the two major candidates, Harold
Wilson and Edward Heath. Wilson, the
canniest politician to hit British politics
within memory, never wanted a March
poll. He has been dragging his feet on
the question of new elections ever since
he took office a year ago last October.
His reasoning, which has turned out to
be valid, is that the longer Labor stays
in office, the more impression it makes
upon the voters as being the legitimate
government, and the better are its
chances when an election is unavoidable.
To his mind familiarity breeds confidence
rather than contempt, and had it not
been for the pressure of the Labor Party
leaders and the Press augmented by
Labor’s big majority at the Hull by-
election in January —he would almost
certainly have tried to hold out until
next October.
The reasons for Edward Heath's rel-
uctance to face the voters are even more
obvious. Although it has now been nine
months since he replaced Sir Alec Doug-
las-Home as party leader, Heath has
yet to give the Tories the political sex
appeal he was hired to provide, he has
yet to convince the voters that he is a
serious, alternative Prime Minister, and
he has yet to unify his own fragmented
party.
While Enoch Powell, Reginald Maud-
Now, ideally, we’d like you to vote for our party and not tell anybody.
(From “The Observer”, London.)
ling and lan Macleod sharpen their knives
in the wings, ready to take over should
Heath go down to an ignominious defeat,
Tory politicians complain in magazine
articles about the “meaningless opposi-
tion” of their own leader, and Heath
buzzes around energetically trying to
find a single issue on which he can chal-
lenge the Labor Government without
sparking a mutiny within his own party.
The collapse of the Tory Opposition
has been in no small measure due to
the extraordinary political deftness of
Harold Wilson. He has disarmed the
Opposition by seizing its own ground and
by pursuing policies which —despite a
few Socialist phrases thrown in to ap-
pease the party’s Left wing—are scarcely
distinguishable from those of the Tories
themselves.
As a result the Tories have had vir-
tually nothing to campaign against. They
cannot damn Socialism, because the
Prime Minister himself is indifferent to
it: nationalisation has been quietly buried;
the public (i.e., private) school system
remains sacrosanct (Lord Snow, Social-
ist, enemy of the two cultures and min-
ister in the Labor Government, recently
declared that he sends his own son to
Eton so that he will come into contact
with his social peers); the Exchequer’s
office is being run along rules laid down
by the banks of the city, and there : ; s
yet no sign that taxation will be used for
achieving economic, let alone social,
equality.
Socialism now seems to be a somewhat
dirty word in the higher councils of the
Labor Government. Odd as it may seem
to those who believe in labels, Britain
under Harold Wilson is a good deal less
socialistic than France under Charles de
Gaulle.
While Heath could not be expected to
chide Wilson for being a bad Socialist,
he could certainly have nailed him to the
floor for being an incompetent economist.
After some 17 months in office, Labor
has still to figure out a way of dealing
with the sterling crisis other than by
borrowing money from its friends abroad;
has been able to pull its payments into
line by the temporary expedient of im-
posing a surtax on exports, which is only
viable so long as its trading partners re-
frain from retaliating; has chosen the
road to deflation rather than devaluation
of the pound, even though this means in-
ducing a recession whose worst effects
will be felt by low wage-earners; and has
been able to promise nothing more
inspiring on the economic horizon than
a one per cent growth rate.
Wilson is also highly vulnerable in the
area of foreign policy—if the Tories were
not so divided themselves that they fear
to challenge him. On the question of
Rhodesia he has been all fiery speeches
and pallid actions, quite content to sweep

the whole affair under the carpet if the
Tories will let him —which they are
quite happy to do. Labor's rather pathetic
sentimentality about the Commonwealth,
its substitute for the old Empire, would
also be a suitable target for Tory barbs
at the Government —as Enoch Powell
recently showed so devastatingly if
the Tory back benches were not occupied
by colonial diehards.
Above all, Heath should have had a
trump card to play on relations with the
Common Market —since it was at Brus-
sels that he won his notoriety. Yet in-
stead of waving the European flag, he
has played it cool, and thereby left it to
Harold Wilson, of all people, to make
discreet hints about bringing Britain into
Europe.
While Labor makes eyes at Europe,
it still remains entranced by the world-
wide role of imperial policeman it in-
herited from the Tories. Instead of dis-
engaging the nation from its extensive
overseas involvements, Harold Wilson has
gone out in search of new commitments
“east of Suez”. In doing so he has also
become the Johnson Administration’s
most zealous advocate for the war in
Vietnam and the containment of China.
The relationship, which is hardly coin-
cidental, may, as some cynics suggest, be
due to simple opportunism. Since the
value of the British pound is almost en-
tirely dependent on the willingness of
Lyndon Johnson to make loans from Fort
Knox, and since Britain’s military pre-
sence in Malaysia would be untenable
without US assistance, Wilson obviously
thinks it imprudent to antagonise Wash-
ington. But this alone does not explain
British policy, since the US, for its own
sake even more than Britain's, would not
allow the pound to sink or the Indo-
nesians to take over Malaysia.
Harold Wilson knows this, too, and it
seems increasingly clear that he pursues
the policies he does because he believes
that Britain's role as a world power lies
in close association with the United
States. If playing a world role means
Britain shall be an auxiliary to Washing-
ton, then an auxiliary she shall be.
All this came out into the open during
the recent furore over the new defence
budget in which Britain, while putting a
$5.6 billion lid on defence spending,
committed itself to a long-term police-
keeping operation “east of Suez”. “We
intend to remain a great power,” declared
Defence Minister Denis Healey as he
unveiled plans to hold on to the bases in
Malaysia and Singapore, build a string
of new ones with US help in the Indian
Ocean, keep the troops stationed along
the Rhine, and buy 50 long-range fighter-
bombers from the US.
In compensation, the bases in Aden,
Cyprus, Guiana and Malta are to be cut,
and the Royal Navy was told it could
not have a new aircraft-carrier. The latter
prompted the resignation of naval min-
ister Christopher Mayhew, who pointed
out, with some justice, that the defence
budget was “too small if we want to stay
east of Suez and too big if we don’t”.
More telling was Mayhew’s further
charge that Britain was trying to play a
world role “not as a power in our own
right but as an extension of American
power, not as allies but as auxiliaries”.
It is a harsh comment, but perhaps not
a damning one. Unlike Healey, most
Britons are bored with playing the role of
a great power, but they do not particu-
larly mind charges that they are behaving
like lackeys of the US. Nationalism has
a phoney ring in Britain, even on the
Right where the conservative “Daily
Telegraph” recently asked: “What’s wrong
with being an American auxiliary?”
So long as nobody minds, so long as
the Vietnamese war does not escalate
into a war with China, so long as Britain
can ride America’s coat-tails and still
not have to give up anything more than
her political freedom of manoeuvre, so
long as the threatened recession can be
kept at bay, and so long as the nation
continues to enjoy the stylish decadence
that is one of the great charms of Brit-
ain today, Harold Wilson is likely to
stay on at Ten Downing Street. He will
stay on not because he is loved, and
not because his policies have been very
successful, but rather, in the words of
the “Economist”, “because he has out-
worked all the others”.
Where Terror
Is Practised
By EDMOND TAYLOR
Last August the United States
Marines entered Hoa Long, a
village some three and a half miles
south-east of Danang, and cleaned out
the Vietcong who had unofficially but
effectively administered it for a number
of years —• despite the presence of a
village chief nominally responsible to the
provincial governor appointed by Saigon.
Today, Hoa Long has reached what
might be termed the shotgun level of
security. There is now little danger of
being sniped at from nearby Marble
Mountain, a jungle-covered crag with
outcroppings of stained white stone that
rises a sheer thousand feet out of the
coastal paddy fields like a landscape in
an ancient Chinese silk painting. The
risks of being caught in a surprise Viet-
cong attack or of falling into a sub-
stantial Vietcong ambush are even less.
A reinforced Marine battalion is based
only a mile or so away, and Marine
patrols comb the surrounding country-
side twenty-four hours daily. Moreover,
Hoa Long has a vigilant and energetic
police chief and its own protective force
of Popular Force militiamen armed with
carbines. Yet a visitor arriving there in
broad daylight only the Vietcong pay
visits after dark in this area is usually
given a Marine escort armed with a shot-
gun just in case he might encounter a
prowling assassin.
“Wouldn’t the people tell you or the
police chief if they saw a suspicious
stranger skulking about?” I asked the
village chief, an alert, youthful-looking
man named Huynh Suu. “Some of them
might,” he answered, “but a great many
would be afraid to report such a thing.”
“But why are the people still afraid?”
I persisted. “There aren’t any more Viet-
cong cadres in the village.”
“The Vietcong aren’t in the village,”
Huynh replied, “but they are still hiding
in the mountain or somewhere nearby
in the countryside and at night they hold
meetings and force people from the
village to attend. At these meetings they
warn the people that if anyone is seen
talking to the Marines or to me or the
police chief they will be killed, so natur-
ally everyone is afraid.”
“Don't the people think the Marines
can protect them?”
“Maybe the Marines can protect us in
the daytime, but there aren’t any Marines
in the village after dark. That is why I
only come to my office here in the day-
time; at night I sleep with my whole
family inside the Marine compound
just like all the other village and hamlet
chiefs around here. What else can we do?
If I stayed here at night I know I would
be killed and so would my wife and
children.”
“Is the risk really so great?”
Huynh Suu smiled grimly. “It depends
on how you count it,” he said. “In this
district we average one government
official murdered per week. My colleague
in the next village thought it was safe for
him to sleep at home because there was
a permanent Marine detachment guard-
ing a bridge fifty yards away. Yet the
Vietcong slipped up one night and threw
a grenade through the bars of his win-
dow. He was lucky to get off with a
broken arm. Now he sleeps in the Marine
compound like the rest of us. Then just
a couple of weeks ago a hamlet chief
near here was kidnapped by the Vietcong
at noon within two hundred yards of a

Marine outpost. So you see what we are
up against.”
“How many Vietcong killers are there
in this area?”
> “Only six but they are a special
suicide squad, and their leader, who
comes from this village, has already
killed more than thirty people with his
own hands.”
Huynh, who had already been chief
of Hoa Long for nearly two years when
for all practical purposes it was under
Vietcong control and who had nonethe-
less somehow managed to survive,
seemed to be taking a gloomy relish in
his report on Vietcong terrorism. I was
curious to see his reaction to a proposal
that has been put forward from time to
time by certain Vietnamese counter-
insurgency experts for dealing with the
kind of situation that prevails in Hoa
Long. “You must have a few men in
the village you can trust,” I remarked.
“Wouldn’t it be possible to arm them so
they could defend themselves against
these six killers?”
“Nobody would dare to accept the
arms,” the chief answered. “They know
they would be killed by the Vietcong.”
T gave up then, but after talking with an-
other village chief the one whose
arm was injured and who now cannot
step out of his office in broad daylight
unless accompanied by his two-man
Marine bodyguard I came to the
conclusion that Huyhn’s pessimism was
not wholly unfounded.
Probably there are some local factors
that make the security problem in the
Marble Mountain sector peculiarly diffi-
cult to cope with, and in other sectors of
the Marine bridgeheads along the coast
near Danang it seemed to me that more
imaginative efforts were being made to
solve it. But the situation at Hoa Long
illustrates the basic problem of pacifica-
tion in this country, at least in areas that
have been under direct or indirect Viet-
cong control for a long time and a
large section of South Vietnam still is.
The Vietcong are probably the most
talented terrorists the modern world has
ever seen, both in regard to the tech-
niques of murder and in regard to its
psychological exploitation. As the ex-
ample of Hoa Long demonstrates, a
handful of ruthless, fearless killers can
negate both military power and enlight-
ened political leadership.
The real threat in Vietnam is not the
North Vietnamese military invasion but
Hanoi's skilful manipulation of its
underground terrorist, sabotage, and
subversion networks. Negotiated settle-
ment might lift the military menace from
South Vietnam but, if anything, would
leave the country more vulnerable than
ever to the threat of terror.

LETTERS
Private Eyewash
SIR. —Having read Charles Higham’s
“Private Eyewash” (8., March 26) I
turned instantly to the Letters Page to
see how many words I could use for the
defence. It rather took the wind out
of my sails when in a letter about Yev-
tushenko and the man Higham I chan-
ced upon a reference to your critic’s “well
deserved reputation for intelligent com-
ment”.
It is fair, I hope, to query this “well-
deserved reputation”, when Higham dis-
misses every English writer or journalist,
save for some old ladies and poets, and
the critics of the “Sunday Times”, as
lacking the qualities of order and clean-
liness or purity of style. I cannot guess
what the English have done to Mr High-
am, but that shot of “intellectual flab-
biness” does immunise the soul against
the remaining rhubarb. After dropping
a few trendy names and scattering some
of the traditional seed on the ground
“immature”, “pimply” “hideous offset
mess” and (wait for it fans) “undergradu-
ate” he finally reaches “The Penguin
Private Eye”.
To start with “The Penguin Private
Eye” bears only passing resemblance to
the magazine. It is an anthology of a
year’s issues (“Private Eye” has already
produced two books for Weidenfeld and
Nicolson) and as such, given the whims
of Penguin, the fact that most of the
magazine is topical and after a month is
so dated as to be useless in a book, and
the laws of libel it is not likely to be as
“piercing” as one would like. (Ik_was a
little nearer the mark when it appeared
in England in November).
And as for the “more disgust-
ing aspects of the ’sixties in Eng-
land from the Profumo business
on” what are they, Higham, what
are they? On the Profumo business, any-
way, we were the only magazine at the
time which pursued the issue from the
earliest numbers and have indeed been
praised for this by (among others) Way-
land Young in his “Aspects of Conser-
vatism”!
I could go on for some time about
“Private Eye”, what it stands for, the
“immature” journalists and artists who
work for it but there comes a tide
in the affairs of them when one must
shut up. If it’s any comfort to Higham
despite his “daring to attack them”, I
am not seeking to dispose of him. He is
doing that quite well enough himself. He
is not, I think, puritanical, a prude, a
wowser. He is a flatulent bore.

Charles Higham replies: Mr Rushton’s
letter illustrates my own point about
“Private Eye’s” level of wit.
Schools and the State
SIR. —T. R. Garnett in his well-written
article, “Why Not Abolish State
Schools?” (8., March 19), with its strong
appeals to common sense, raises the
question of the State’s right to conduct
schools. Since the Catholic view of the
function of the State seems to be mis-
understood by many Catholics when they
advocate “State Aid” for reasons of
justice, it might be appropriate to ex-
plain the traditional attitude very briefly.
Obviously if the apologist for the church
school is confused then even the most
well-meaning opponent may be forgiven
if he fails to appreciate the claim of in-
justice.
The State is viewed as a necessity,
not a luxury; in other words it exists
because there are some things which
cannot be done without it. Its proper
role is regarded as a suppletive one. On
this thesis when the State conducts
schools it is acting, not as the State (in
its proper function), but as a private
contractor with the parents of those
children who attend these schools. The
injustice lies then in using taxes, which
are levied so that the State can fulfil its
proper suppletive functions, to pay for
the education of those whose parents
want them to receive a secular education.

'(The cry from Catholics should be: stop
Catholic aid to State schools.)
Education in Australia is the most
gigantic monopoly in the nation.
There are supposed to be at least two
“systems” of schools, but the subjects
and details are supplied by the State.
The finger of monopoly is in every pie,
on every child. How can this system of
ascribing mass medication be right? If
a teacher can be trusted by parents as a
professionally competent person then he
should be allowed to teach what he knows
is good for this child, now. Not what
some committee or someone who knows
nothing about the child says to teach.
The State does have the right to demand
that every child be educated to a certain
standard, that teachers be qualified, and
that standards of public health are upheld
in every school. But beyond safeguard-
ing these responsibilities, the State has no
educational rights which it does not re-
ceive by delegation from the parents.
The issues are not always clear, as
! Mr Garnett indicates in his article.
Sometimes the emotional clouds of relig-
ion, or the arguments of snobbery, ob-
scure the discussion.'Too often the ad-
ministrative experts demand that pupils
at Bourke, Bathurst and Bondi learn the
same thing at the same time.

Yevtushenko
SIR.—Two years ago with a friend I
included in a series of poetry recitals in
Sydney a reading of Yevtushenko’s poetry
from the Penguin translation. Even with
our limited histrionic abilities the poetry
had more than usual impact on our
audience. Yevtushenko’s poetry is far
from dull when read aloud, but I am
not particularly drawn to read it again
for my pleasure, to extract further riches
from it. Yn this respect I find it dull for
the very reasons Charles Higham puts
forward (8., March 19).
It may be a different story in the ori-
ginal Russian; but, I suspect, not very
much so. It seems to me to be primarily
declamatory poetry, poetry that needs
the extra dimension of a good reader,
preferably Yevtushenko himself, to bring
it alive. I commend Charles Higham for
bringing attention back from an impres-
sive personality and a world figure to
the quality of the poetry itself, from col-
lective attitudes to individual evaluation.
In another context, is not this just what
Yevtushenko is doing?
W. HART SMITH

Investigating the Police
SIR. I was not shocked by the NSW
Government’s plan to set up an “in-
dependent tribunal” to deal with com-
plaints of police misconduct, as Mr Pile
writes (8., March 19) —merely sceptical
about it. As also, for somewhat different
reasons, was Mr Pile himself. For in his
letter to the “Daily Telegraph” (Jan. 14),
written on behalf of the Executive Com-
mittee of the Council for Civil Liberties,
he stated that the plan “would go no
distance at all to solve the basic prob-
lem”. I suspect, however, that my
scepticism is more profound than his,
and his letter does little to allay it.
Thus he complains of “the incredible
consistency” of the various police wit-
nesses’ reports under the present pro-
cedure. Yet such reports can only be
either consistent or inconsistent with each
other, whatever tribunal they are pre-
sented to. And in either case they will
certainly be regarded as unsatisfactory
by those disposed to distrust the police.
Consistency will be taken to imply col-
lusion; inconsistency as evidence that
someone is lying. Moreover, in the sort
of case envisaged by Mr Pile where
police are accused of criminal offences
they would not normally be obliged to
submit to cross examination in order to
establish or remove inconsistencies.
Mr Pile disputes the analogy I drew
between the police and other professions
in respect of disciplinary tribunals. But
he ignores the fact that my analogy
related solely to the composition of the
tribunals and not at all to the procedural
matters to which he devotes all his atten-
tion. In this connection he talks of the
necessity for a public tribunal which
“follows legal procedures”. But what
kind of legal procedures? If existing safe-
guards applicable to the accused are to
apply it is difficult to see why the already
existing courts are not adequate. Mr
Pile might care to explain precisely what
further powers not already available to
the courts should be given to the new
investigators and tribunals.
Lastly, Mr Pile states that “the number
of complaints made against the police
are fortunately not numerous”. It seems
unlikely that they would remain so once
the “independent tribunal” got going. The
suggestion that the imposition of costs,
in cases where the complaint was found
to be groundless, would deter the
irresponsible or the obstructive criminal
complainant is surely more “romantic”
than anything I said.
In conclusion, recent reports from
New York where the new Republican
Mayor John Lindsay is introducing a
civilian review board to deal with citizens’
complaints against the police are hardly
encouraging.

ADELAIDE FESTIVAL, THEATRE
Digging for Gold

Jemmy Green, Off to the Diggings. Pro-
duced by Peter O’Shaughnessy. Union
Hall, Adelaide.
David Kossoff. Arts Theatre, Adelaide.
Iphigenia in Aulis. Athens Drama Company,
Teachers’ College, Adelaide.

Adelaide.
T)eter O’Shaughnessy’s excavation,
adaptation and presentation of
“Jemmy Green” and “Off to the Dig-
gings” have resulted in an imaginative,
exciting and enterprising production. The
evening races at an exhilarating pace sus-
tained by roaring gusto, broad slashes
of humor and stylish performances. This
is probably the most richly entertaining
event yet aired at the 4th Adelaide
Festival and the University Theatre Guild
deserves praise and thanks.
“Off to the Diggings”—the less pub-
licised but more delightful of the offer-
ings—is a two-act break-up concerning
some of our earliest immigrants from the
Old Country. We see them first in a
London street —a collection of Cockney
caricatures beset with wife-mistress-
money troubles, each devising a motive
to defect to the Diggings. The second
act deals with their various delights and
disillusionments in the gold fields until
all the separated spouses and lost lovers
are breathlessly reunited in time for the
final curtain number.
“Jemmy Green in Australia” is the
appealing tale of one poor little Pommy
in a big new land crawling with wild
Aborigines' and con men. It is all written
and performed in an extremely light-
hearted, music-hall fashion; but beneath
the surface slapstick and satire are some
truths about the problems of emigration
and integration. Both plays are heavily
laced with songs, mostly traditional but
with some original additions—all under
the excellent direction of Elizabeth Sils-
bury.
This was not an occasion for stunning
individual performances, but members of
the exuberant, well-drilled team included
Khail Jureidini (an infectious Jemmy
Green), Harold Minear, Max Height,
Mick Rodger, Margery Irving and Peter
Meredith. Barry Warren’s set designs
and decor are superbly conceived and
executed, as are Elizabeth Wiliams’
costume designs. The major, and endur-
ing, credit for the evening belongs, of
course, to Peter O’Shaughnessy. It Is rare
(in a production with a largely local cast)
to see such whip-cracking, galloping
pace; to see players performing with such
theatre-filling effervescence and rousing
relish.
David Kossoff is certainly charming,
expertly at ease and puckishly good-
humored throughout his long, one-man,
three-prop (chair, crown, kilt) show. The
first half is largely devoted to gentle
anecdotage about some imaginary Euro-
pean village. Both Kossoff and most of
the large audience appeared so delighted
by all this that any mild criticism may
tend to seem grumpy and sobersided.
Still, for me, his villagers had limited
charm and the anecdotes were usually
based on very, very old gags.
His second half is much better as he
tells an adult fairy story about his
experiences in The Never-Never Land
(the film world). It’s a sort of “Me of
the Never-Never”. Much of this is very
funny and is related with skill, impec-
cable timing and scalpel-sharp insight.
I don’t know what qualifications one
should have to appraise the worth and
impact of the Athens Drama Company;
but I’m sure I don’t have them. The
following is a brief, very subjective,
' reaction.
It would be easy, but quite untrue, to
say that the language raised no barrier;
that the story communicated easily and
graphically. According to the pro-
gramme, “Iphigenia in Aulis” concerns
Agamemnon’s decision to sacrifice his
daughter because an old prophet predicts
that, otherwise, the Gods won’t supply a
wind for the ships and he won’t stand
a chance against Troy. It is all acted
with immense style and dignity. But
there seems to me to be a very thin line
between classical, stylised acting and
rather heavy moustache - twirling. The
chorus seemed interminable and drab.
My Osborne-Pinter-Williams condition-
ing overcame me. Guiltily, and with the
greatest respect, I was bored stiff.
The programme notes for Sound and
Image quote Paul Klee: “What springs
from this source, whatever it may be
called, dream, idea or fantasy, must be
taken seriously only if it unites with the
proper creative means to form a work
of art”. This latest series in the con-
tinuing experiments of J. S. Ostoja-
Kotkowski and John Dallwitz does not
form a work of art. Still, as skilful and
stimulating experiments, they should be
taken seriously.
The interlude “Sun” had great impact.
A succession of dissolving slides moves
us nearer and nearer to the sun on the
rim of a hill. A white sun in a sky of
cold yellow. Later, thin lines of red,
green and white snake around a black
screen. It all looks like a method of
producing neurotic, instant road-maps.
Then there was computer - written
poetry, largely nonsensical. But ’twas
brillig, some of it. A Christmas card
(“ —happjolly Jollyjelly jellybelly belly-
merry—Chrismerry as MERRYCHRYS-
ANTHEMUM”) was delightfully set to
music and choir. Other poems (“What
does she put four whistles beside heated
rugs for?”) seemed slightly more evasive.
lonesco’s “The Mire” (the second half
of the programme) is the rather sordid,
macabre story of a man's physical dis-
integration (one morning an arm drops
off, etc.). As a production this is a con-
fusing mixture. Much of it is power-
fully, skilfully presented and yet, even
in 45 minutes, there is time for it to
drag. Alexander Hay narrates it with
polished dissociation but visually it palls.
As the means to an end Sound and
Image is full of promise and provocation:
but the end is not yet in sight.
(In last week’s review of Chekhov’s
“The Three Sisters” at the Sheridan, Mir
Stapleton wrote that “Too often the cast
suggests Amateur Night”. This was fol-
lowed by “When it does, Judith Dick is
usually responsible”. A sentence had
been dropped between these two passages
which would have made it clear that
when the production reached professional
standards, Miss Dick was usually re-
sponsible.)

ON FILM
Hobbyists on Hobby-horses
VI/hile the arguments for an Australian
" film industry continue and con-
tinue to ignore the fact that the market
is shrinking for the kind of medium-
budget picture we could produce no
one seems to be pressing for something
I would regard as more desirable at the
moment: an effective avant-garde, at once
disclosing a pressure of concern for
cinema in a group of young film-makers,
and the presence of artists on the scene.
In the United States, Bruce Baillie (who
worked as a longshoreman to raise cash
for films), Kenneth Anger and James
Broughton on the West Coast, the Mekas
brothers and the Cinema 16 group on the
East, and in Britain directors like Kevin
Brownlow and Anthony Simmons, have
made films on the most slender imagin-
able resources, often without grants, and
often unaided by an industry which at
no stage is prepared to offer them work.
Kevin Brownlow was making a film while
earnings £4.105. a week in London; it has
been completed after nitre years of appal-
ling stuggle. (“It Happened Here”, a
fantasy about a supposed Nazi invasion
of England.)
Too often, one feels, prospective Aus-
tralian film-makers are simply looking
for soft jobs in an established industry
here, or tend to head for similar posts in
overseas industries, disappearing from
sight in some obscure cutting-room or
laboratory. The depressing gutlessness of
so many of the expatriates interviewed in
Stefan Sargent’s admirable TCN feature
“Australians in London” is reflected in
the disappearance of self-proclaimed film
artists who have emerged here, made
perhaps one brief film, and surrendered
their roles as artists by immediately
plunging into the maw of the industry
elsewhere. Why aren’t they here, battling
to make personal films by working as
the Americans and French do at
menial jobs to make more money, going
without food, walking to work instead
of driving around or going to the beach
at weekends, burning themselves up for
cinema? Because they haven’t, in the last
analysis, anything really pressing to say
in film? One has only to hear the empty
dilettantish talk of film people at the
film festivals to realise that there is no
real pressure of concern here, no fierce
commitment to the medium, and laziness
is present too frequently in our cineastes,
thinking to inspire hope for their doing
more than talk about making films.
The obstacles are admittedly formid-
able: the cost of sound cameras and stock
here is extremely high, actors and tech-
nicians are said not to want to give their
services free (and they talk about wanting
to fight for Australian films!). But when
did obstacles prevent an artist from
making his films? For every one Ameri-
can who has received a grant there are
a hundred who have made their films
from the money saved from jobs as
petrol-station attendants, wharfies, build-
ers’ laborers: Bruce Baillie, the gifted
San Francisco film-maker, is a typical
example.
Just recently, there have been a few
encouraging signs that young Australians
are using some of the energy they spend
talking about films and going to
parties and the beach while talking on
making them, and working like hell to
make them. Albie Thoms, in his early
twenties an avant-garde theatre pioneer,
has had some encouraging brushes
with the police while presenting adapta-
tions of Prevert and Artaud in short-
film form. One looks forward to his new
film, “Blunderball”, a pop parody of
James Bond. If it is branded “filthy” by
our custodians of morality, bravo. Gary
Shead, a cartoonist whose work appears
in The Bulletin, has mad; “Ding-a-
Ding Day”, a home movie evocation of
Sydney life full of charm: this was re-
jected by the Sydney Film Festival
last year. Of course it doesn’t come off,
and the second half introducing
various Sydney cult figures doesn't
work as well as the first. But what of it?
The effort has been made, and our Fes-
tivals should show unsuccessful Aus-
tralian experiments of this kind. Shead's
"In my 50 years in the
film industry I've con-
stantly responded to
progress.. in equip-
ment."
"I don't core if it's the end of the
world, Whittaker- I refuse to
shoot without a tripod."
second film, a spoof western, certainly
must be shown at this year’s festival.
Another young director, David Price,
has made, in “Surfing Roundabout”, a
half-routine, half-stimulating evocation of
beach life with at least two very striking
sequences: a coldly detached view of
lilesavers going through their pompous
rituals, and an exquisitely shot sequence
of a half-naked boy riding a scuttle-
board round and round a stone courtyard
which catches in blindingly sunlit im-
ages the hedonism and exhilaration of
young people’s life in Sydney today.
These are the stirrings. A tone of
uncynical detachment comes through,
suggesting the flavor of a purely Aus-
tralian avant-garde. Personal films should
be the expression not only of an in-
dividual’s psyche, but of a whole range
of feelings among the most alive people
in a community. Shead, Price and the
others are already beginning to convey
an Australian quality of physical joy, of
sardonic indifference. One hopes they
will stay here, battle it out, and finally
get their experimental films in front of
audiences overseas, via the British Film
Institute, the Knokke-le-Zoute festival,
and Cinema 16 in New York. These
could do our artistic prestige abroad far
more good than any number of low-
budget commercial B-pictures for the
British market, which we are constancy
and dauntingly being asked to produce;
but whether naive hedonism will appeal
to the cerebrally tormented majority of
avant-garde specialists elsewhere remains
to be seen. And the final question remains
unanswered: are Shead and the others
artists'. ? Or are they merely making home
movies as an extra hobby, like tatting?

acoustics, loud thunder accompanied
most of the first concert; further attrac-
tions were provided by an exploding
floodlight and uncommonly unpleasant
climatic conditions. That the London
musicians took all this smilingly in their
stride, without ever missing a beat, is
greatly to their credit.
The LSO is. beyond any doubt on my
part, the best orchestra yet to be heard
in Australia. Making comparisons only
within the framework of the last few
years’ listening, I have arrived at this
conclusion: the LSO is superior to other
orchestras we have heard because it is
independent and player-controlled.
I have, on many occasions, asserted
my faith in our own orchestra. Taken
individually, the majority of its members
would probably prove acceptable to the
LSO; but as a body of players they don’t
sound anywhere near as good. This may
be due to their being a species of public
servants; our system, in which a usually
benevolent but sometimes despotic
paternalism is exercised by the ABC does
not allow for initiative by the players.
These are matters within the authority
of the LSO’s members; as a result, this
orchestra plays as a true ensemble of
good-humored colleagues. Not only is
their playing amazingly accurate and
brilliant, but it is free of tension and
boredom. Other visiting orchestras,
notably the Czech Philharmonic and the
Boston Symphony, are not, in my
opinion, quite as /Outstanding. The
Czechs, though quite magnificent, lacked
the London orchestra’s spontaneity and
crispness of sound; the Boston players
showed less precision and musical re-
sponse.
The LSO includes a number of the
world’s leading instrumentalists and, in-
cidentally, has eight Australians among
its members. I was particularly pleased
to see that Nelson Cooke—last heard in
Sydney ten years ago in Maurice Clare’s
chamber ensemble —is the LSO’s prin-
cipal ’cellist. But what impressed me
more than the standards of individual
players was the orchestra’s overall stand-
ard of attack and togetherness. Much
of this must be due to the work of the
LSO’s conductors. The principal con-
ductor, Istvan Kertesz, is recognised as
one of the most versatile and successful
of present-day musicians. His style is
rather unemphatic and his conducting is
not always easily followed by an audi-
ence, but his results speak for themselves.
Kertesz’s catholicity was shown by his
insight into the music of both Britten and
Bruckner; more dissimilar musical styles
would be hard to find.
The orchestra’s guest conductor, Colin
Davis, is utterly different. Ebullient,
demonstrative and youthful, he proved
even more fully in sympathy with the
orchestra. He is a master of style and,
thanks to his ability to move with a ballet-
dancer's expressiveness, good to watch
as well as listen to. The programmes
themselves were good examples of in-
telligent planning; the first one read
"Britten - Weber - Bruckner”, the second
“Berlioz - Tippett - Mozart - Stravinsky”.
Two of the orchestra’s instrumental
principals appeared as soloists: Gervase
de Peyer in Weber’s 2nd clarinet con-
certo, Roger Lord in Mozart’s oboe con-
certo. De Peyer, already well known
from many fine recordings, proved a
remarkably agile virtuoso. The Weber
concerto is not important music, but it
makes for pleasant listening; stylishly
Italianate and very rarely heard, it gives
the clarinetist and his instrument ample
scope for the display of technique and
versatility. De Peyer used this to the
full, but by comparison with the Vienna
Octet’s Alfred Boskovsky (heard here
last year) his tone seemed rather too
brassy; however, he produced some truly
wonderful trills in the lower registers.
Roger Lord, a very fine and sensitive
player, had less spectacular material in
the Mozart; he is not, I think, superior
to our best oboists—David Woolley and
Jiri Tancibudek but excellent for all
that. What mattered more in the Mozart
was the truly wonderful orchestral play-
ing, clearly music close to Mr Davis’
heart.
All the orchestral works, on both
nights, were of outstanding interest.
Britten’s Four Sea Interludes and Passa-
caglia from “Peter Grimes” opened the
first concert excitingly. They were played
in an unfamiliar order the Passacaglia
inserted between “Sunday Morning” and
“Moonlight”—which proved both logical
and right; the music has never sounded
more stunningly colorful. The stinging,
sharp edges in the violins’ first steely
passages proved characteristic of the
LSO’s playing clear textures were
obvious throughout the concerts.
Bruckner’s 4th Symphony, heard for
the first time in the lengthy 1878 version,
was a wonderful sound-bath. It is true
that a symphony of over one hour’s
duration taxes one’s patience, particular-
ly at the end of a hot and damp evening;
but the experience was certainly worth-
while. Its counterpart, in weight and
importance, in the second concert, was
Michael Tippett’s 1957 Symphony No.
2. This is not an easily approachable
work, but of considerable beauty and
interest. The second concert opened with
a breathtaking reading of Berlioz’ “Le
Corsaire” overture and concluded with
a brilliantly successful performance of
Stravinsky’s “Symphony in Three Move-
ments”, written in 1945, which has never
sounded more exciting.

Herr Franz Josef Strauss. All of them
worried me, because here were leading
men of three NATO countries and one
about to withdraw, and their attitudes
were all too reminiscent of those 1919
disagreements recently on view in “World
War I”.
Internationally, a small group of
women interviewed earlier in Bob San-
ders’ series, “People”, made more sense
and offered as much hope. The ladies
were gathering in a backyard to go out
in a hired truck, dressed as suffragettes,
to protest against war, in Vietnam and
anywhere else. Rightly or wrongly, they
felt that wars could not be left to diplo-
mats or generals, and that ordinary
people should be heard, too. Their opin-
ions seemed more valid than Dr Sukar-
no’s—that Asian problems such as Viet-
nam should be left to Asians, a view
stated in a German-made documentary
on Indonesia, which Channel 7 showed.
This told us the usual too little about
Indonesia, which seems beyond docu-
mentary television’s ability to encompass.
But it did show that Indonesians have
too many fences of their own to mend,
including the national economy which
Japan is being asked to help. Then there
is another point of view, the isolationism
which America has given up and France
has adopted. In the French General’s
words, “It is not our business what other
nations do”.
If you watch enough television, the
bells toll ever more loudly, and one comes
to applaud those few Sydney women
who go out and declare it, instead of
staying home to watch “Morning Star”,
“Who Has the Answer?”, or similar
thought-provoking material served up on
afternoon television.

Gome critical carping against “The Col-
lector” stems, I think, from a wrong-
headed idea of what sort of film it’s sup-
posed to be. The original novel was
written well enough to give the impres-
sion that it was a serious work it has
even been contended that it and the film
are a version of “The Tempest”, mainly,
it seems, because the girl’s name is
Miranda and the man can be regarded by
some stretching of the imagination as a
sort of Caliban-Ferdinand. I don’t know
what happened to Prospero and Ariel
and all that push.
But for all its fancy airs, .he book is
basically a thriller, and a very good one.
William Wyler has treated the film that
way and has produced a fine example of
the genre exciting, absorbing, a model
of expert filmcraft.
It is the story of an obsession. A
lonely young man with a genuine but
muddled love of beauty—he’s noted as a
butterfly collector wins a fortune in
the pools, buys a remote house and kid-
naps an art student whom he desires. He
keeps the girl well-fed and comfortable
but imprisoned. Wyler has reduced the
novel to its essentials, and the film has
really only two characters two others
appear only momentarily. His direction
of Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar
is masterly, and the cutting of the book
generally justified; though some examin-
ation of the collector’s past life might
have been worthwhile, nothing but good
comes from the removal of a lengthy
sub-plot about the girl’s previous love-
life, which took up a good deal of the
novel.
Robert Krasker’s color photography
is very handsome and most flattering to
the chestnut-haired Samantha Eggar; and
the smiling beauty of the English country-
side makes an effective contrast for the
dark deeds of the story.
“The Bedford Incident” is a terribly
sincere film which in a much more
solemn and less effective way propounds
the same moral as “Dr Strangelove”
that if deadly weapons are invented,
disaster can be set off by the slightest
human error, the derangement of one
man. Specifically, the moral of “The Bed-
ford Incident” is that you shouldn’t put
a ship equipped with nuclear weapons
in charge of a fanatical captain with
over-enthusiastic officers. Fair enough,
but the film fails to engage much interest
until the end: most of it consists of long
discussions in which representatives of
different viewpoints “state their case”;
and only in the last few when
the men realise that their game of war
has assumed deadly reality, does it really
grip.
Two interesting movies have turned
up without fanfare as supporting features.
“Light-Fingered George” is a French
comedy (with subtitled original dialogue,
thank goodness) which tells with engag-
ing levity of a man who provides for
his family by robbing poor-boxes. Deft
direction and a delightful performance by
Bourvil. “Brainstorm” takes us back to
the good old days of the inventive,
tightly-constructed thriller. The plot
about a man who pretends insanity in
order to get away with murder and finds
that it’s easier to get into a madhouse
than out again is probably pretty silly,
but r the film is photographed and edited
with such expertise that it is in its modest
way one for the genuine movie enthu-
siast.

Iris Murdoch’s Dublin
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Red and the Green. Iris Murdoch.
Chatto and Windus. $3.15.
HPhe opening sentences of “The Red
and the Green” will come as a shock
to anyone who has read with increasing
bewilderment and even embarrassment
the last two novels of Iris Murdoch, “The
Unicorn” and “The Italian Girl”. Gone
are the craggy cliffs, the haunted houses,
the Gothic mysteries and the grandiose
passions of the world of dream and
nightmare so laboriously created in these
earlier novels. Instead we are introduced
without ceremony to Lieutenant Andrew
Chase-White (King Edward’s Horse),
pottering in a Dublin garden on Sunday
afternoon. And this is neither an ordin-
ary Sunday, nor a symbolic one. It is
the Sunday before Easter, April, 1916,
and in just over a week Andrew Chase-
White is to find himself bound and hand-
cuffed to a young Irish rebel in the
kitchen of a house in Blessington Street,
helpless to defend his honor as a British
Army officer against the Volunteers who
take possession of the Dublin Post Office
in Sackville Street.
For the characters in “The Red and
the Green” this is a week of action and
hard thinking. Miss Murdoch takes them,
through each day from Andrew’s Sunday
in the garden until just after noon on
Easter Monday. Time is measured and
plotted with accuracy. Each character is
in some way involved in Ireland’s politi-
cal crisis Andrew Chase-White as a
somewhat reluctant British Army officer,
uneasy in his Irish ties; his cousins, Pat
and Cathal Dumay, passionate Irish
patriots, the one killed in Dublin Post
Office, the other in the civil war of 1921;
Frances Bellman, who rejects Andrew’s
offer of marriage, and expresses not so
much political views as general humani-
tarian sentiments about Ireland’s situa-
tion; and several other members of the
family, notable among whom is Aunt
Millie, the bewitching villain of the
piece, who also passionately espouses
the cause of Irish nationalism (and em-
braces, in fact, in intention or by impli-
cation, several of her close relatives). So,
looked at from one aspect, this is a
novel about the events leading up to the
Easter Rising, and about the arguments
for and against the Irish patriots. It is
even in a sense an historical novel, since
Miss Murdoch takes the trouble not
only to narrate the events of Easter Week,
F 916, with some care, but also to link her
characters to history through Pearse,
Connolly and other Irish heroes.
Yet it would be misleading to dub this
a political novel. The world of action is
real enough, and so is the world of Dub-
lin. In the end, though, political activity
is subordinate to the private world of
her characters. She explores in some
detail each of her main figures and
there are at least six to whom our atten-
tion is particularly directed and their
political views and actions are seen as
an expression of their whole personality.
What each man or woman really is
forms Miss Murdoch’s chief concern,
and what he or she is may reveal itself
in political activity, which itself is a key
to deeper levels of the personality. Thus,
to take the obvious example, Andrew
Chase-White (like Lord Jim) betrays
himself by his cowardice in a clash with
his rebel cousin Pat Dumay. His essential
timorousness and lack of independence
deflect him from his proper course of
action. Pat, on the other hand, lives up
to his heroic vision of himself, and his
long years of harsh self-discipline and
fanatical single-mindedness are fitly con-
cluded by his death in the Post Office
fighting. Similarly, the other characters
gradually emerge in their strength, weak-
ness or, as in the case of Millie, essential
corruption. Though they have the inde-
pendence of convincing human beings,
they are at the same time conditioned
by the character of Ireland, which is
always present in the novel. They feed
upon its illusions, and nourish its heroic
dreams. Miss Murdoch steps into the
novel at one point in order to express
the single theme which links the lives of
the characters to their place in history:
“Rarely are we able to be the intelligent
spectators of an historical event, more
rarely still, its actors. At such times the
darkness lightens and the space con-
tracts until we apprehend the rhythm of
our daily actions as the rhythm of a
much larger scheme which has included
us in its composition”. Something at
least of this apprehension reaches Miss
Murdoch’s readers.
There are, then, , surprising virtues in
“The Red and the Green” surprising
only because in “The Italian Girl” Miss
Murdoch seemed to have been led into
a particularly dreary cul-de-sac. She has
escaped from it by jumping the fence
into the outside world, and her novel
(and her style) has benefited enormous-
ly by the change of scenery. She des-
cribes for us a real Dublin, in its elegant
shabbiness, its peeling dignity, its shift-
ing light and soft rain. And there is a
real Ireland behind it, pressing on the
sad capital with the weight of its history
and legend. Her characters, too, are per-
suasive for the most part, and at times
startlingly real. Only Aunt Millie seems
to drag with her some of the weird and
malevolent faded glamor which belongs
more properly in Miss Murdoch’s fairy
kingdom.
Yet in spite of all that can be said for
it, “The Red and the Green” is not com-
pletely satisfying. One closes it with a
feeling of disappointment, as a promise
only half-fulfilled. I think that there are
obvious reasons for this sense of dis-
satisfaction. In the first place, in order to
resolve the plot both in terms of action
and motive, Miss Murdoch resorts to a
scene which is so conveniently stage-
managed that one simply sees it as a
technical device; and shortly after this
episode she introduces her favorite sub-
ject, incest, in a way which only empha-
sises its irrelevance to the main action
of the novel. In the second place, she
chooses to tidy up the loose ends of the
plot by means of an epilogue dated
1938. The chief figure here is Frances
Bellman, now married to an anti-Irish
Englishman. What we need to know
about the fates of the characters emerges
in answer to he-' son’s questions about
what happened to all those people who
lived so long ago. It is a clumsy device
at the best of times, and unfortunately
the tone of the epilogue, which is pre-
sumably meant to lend perspective to
the events of history, merely clashes with
the way they have been narrated. So one
is left with the uneasy feeling that Miss
Murdoch has been betrayed by her own
ingenuity. The plot has made demands
which can be met only by sacrificing
subtlety and plausibility.
As a matter of fact, I do not think it
Fiction
He hurst into the empty room
And saw pillow bearing still
The impress of her sleeping head
And kneeling by her bed he wept,
The hero of a thousand books.
And stumbling to the table found
Her letter, where the ink had run
Illegible, and smudged with tears.
Ah, the untidiness of life,
The wrong glass drained, the call delayed.
Surprise, coincidence, and chance
Hold fast to these for fiction’s sake
Now pens no longer blot, now beds
Mo longer hold their hollows, pressed
As though a hare had crouched in grass.

would have mattered had we not been
told what happened to Andrew, Pat and
the rest of them, since the emphasis of
the book is upon the springs of action
rather than its results. If the epilogue is
intended to be a footnote to the his-
torical significance of the Easter Rising,
then it is simply inadequate, for it re-
moves the political argument to a
pedestrian plane. Her real epilogue is to
be found in Yeats’ “Romantic Ireland’s
dead and gone/It’s with O’Leary in the
grave” which in one brief statement
suggests the link between the individual
and the pattern of history which is Miss
Murdoch’s central preoccupation.

A diplomat shot in the Amsterdam
** rain, a camera bulb popping as the

another murdered with a knife in the
back in the middle of the United
Nations Building; a mad youth dressed
up in his mother’s clothes, stabbing a
girl to death in a shower; birds lethally
diving on a crocodile of school children
in a sunny Californian town: the explo-
sive scenes are Hitchcock’s: no director
in the cinema’s history has provided so
many memorable images of human
destruction. With a coolly cynical eye,
Hitchcock mows down the puppets he
creates (he has an especial fondness for
demolishing blonde, Nordic virgin
types) like a coconut-shy owner having
a quiet bit of fun on~his own territory
when the shy is closed for the night. He
has been able to indulge his own imagina-
tion, to pull wings off flies like a child,
to treat us all as victims of a gigantic
Pavlovian experiment: scream, he tells
us, when I snap my fingers, and we all
obey. He has taken us for thirty and
more yearS thrcu 8 h a ghost-train tunnel,
and he still has shocks up his sleeve.
r
Mr Perry, in his account of the
master s work, sticks safely to the well-
trodden paths of scholarship: no new
judgments here, no surprises. But the
stills are superb, and worth having the
book for on their own: from the shots
of the latterday Jack the Ripper pacing
the glass ceiling in “The Lodger” to the
black sails becalmed on a grey sea in
“The Manxman”, and the heroine waving
from the woods; from the terrified Edna
Best in “The Man Who Knew Too Much”
crying out in the stalls of the Albert Hall
that an assassination is going to take
place, a diplomat shot dead to the clash-
ing of a pair of outsized cymbals, to the
voyeurist peeping with a telescope of the
crippled columnist in “Rear Window”,
watching his neighbors’ goings on. These
stills remind us that Hitchcock always
seizes on the worst aspects of human
nature, and milks them dry: pretty, cool
girls turn out to be nymphomaniacs,
little old ladies draw revolvers from
behind their prayer-books, and nervous
motel-keepers are apt to be transvestites
with a habit of peeping on female guests
through portraits on the wall and wield-
ing knives with a will on the spur of the
moment. The obsessions complacent
human beings threatened, calm scenes
used as settings for disaster are dis-
closed here in a wonderful gallery of
pictures, prolifically jostled.
The Studio-Vista book on Garbo is
again mainly of pictorial interest: extra-
ordinary to see the star’s beauty in silent
films hardening into a cold mask in the
talkie period. Something calculated and
mechanical about her performances has
always made me like her less than the
all-out Bette Davis or the blindingly
chromium-plated Joan Crawford; the
melting voice, the gestures of despair
from the slack, big body seem too put on.
But this book reminds us of how superb-
ly photogenic she was at her best (in
“The Kiss” and “The Flesh and the
Devil"), and how William Daniels, her
great cameraman, conducted an extra-
ordinary visual love affair with her for
the whole of a decade.
“The Filmgoer's Companion”, though
sprinkled with errors, is an indispensable
encyclopaedia, great fun to read, which
runs from Bud Abbott to Adolph Zukor
with countless biographies, comments on
films and styles in between. And “Film
Digest”, published in Sydney, is a fine
addition to the ranks of magazines of
the cinema: the February issue contained
a brilliant article by John Baxter on that
neglected sophisticate of the ’thirties, the
director Mitchell Leisen, and we are
promised in April a survey of the de-
linquent cinema: a splendidly rich field.
There has always been a vigorous
“underground” of film critics in Aus-
tralia, far better than most of the “of-
ficial” ones in the daily Press; “Film
Digest” now joins the excellent, inter-
nationally known Melbourne “Film
Journal” in bringing this underground
to the surface.

Phoenixes of War
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Heroes’ Twilight. Bernard Bergonzi. Con-
stable. $4.60.
Tn the history of Eng. Lit. the writing
produced by the Great War has
always been regarded as something of
an isolated phenomenon, subject to a
special set of critical standards, haunted
by the phantoms of what-might-have-
been, and loaded with emotional associa-
tions with Last Posts, Armistice Days
and Flanders poppies. Closer, perhaps,
to the Georgian pastorals that preceded
it than to the Waste Land and the pylons
that succeeded it, it is not a bridge
between them but something apart,
separate, enclosing and enclosed by the
experience that generated it.
The Great War was a unique event.
There never was a war like it and there
never will be again, and naturally it
evoked a unique literary response.
World War II produced nothing compar-
able, perhaps because there was no sense
of fin-de-siecle about 1939, no feeling
that an old, rich, corrupt and splendid
civilisation was foundering in the mud
and blood of the trenches. World War
11, when it came, was simply an extension
of the barbarities to which the world had
grown hardened in the years between the
wars.
But the Georgians, reared in the sum-
mer sunset of England’s security, had
no experience or foreknowledge of such
horrors. What these writers made of the
war, at the time and in retrospect, is the
theme of Bernard Bergonzi’s book. It is
the first full-length critical survey of the
whole, corpus of English Great War
literature, an attempt to assess its value
not merely as a response to the challenge
of war but as part of the whole literary
tradition. The result is a fascinating
book sharp, intelligent, lucid and
wide-ranging. Bergonzi has obviously
read widely among the scores of lesser
writers as well as the handful of
celebrated ones whose works are still
regularly reprinted or anthologised. But
he wears his scholarship lightly.
Time has, of course, done a good
deal of winnowing out. Nobody now
remembers Robert Nichols, Geoffrey
Johnson and many another highly lauded
“war poet” who appeared in the
anthologies published between 1915 and
1920. To most of us, Great War litera-
ture means Brooke, Owen and perhaps
Isaac Rosenberg among the poets; Blun-
den, Sassoon, Graves, Aldington, Man-
ning, Mottram and Ford Madox Ford
among the prose writers. We tend either
to lump them all together or else divide
them roughly into two groups those
(mostly poets, there seems to have been
a sort of fatality about being a poet in
the Great War) who died in battle leaving
a tantalising question mark over their
unrealised future development and those
who survived to produce their best work
years after the war ended. It is one of
the merits of Bergonzi’s book that he
looks at them all as individuals and sees
them sharply marked off in their re-
sponses to the same experience. He also
shows, I think more clearly than any
other critic has done, how literary
attitudes to the war went through a
continuous transfiguration from the
idealist raptures of 1914 to ferocious
cynicism after the Somme bloodbath and
finally to the consciously wrought, sad
and muted philosophical reflection of
postwar books like “Undertones of War”
and “Her Privates We”.
“I adore war. It is like a big picnic
. . Julian Grenfell declared in the
hot, feverish 1914 summer, when every
young subaltern still dreamed of cavalry
charges, flashing swords and a victory
parade down the Unter den Linden
before Christmas. “Come and die, it’ll
be great fun,” Rupert Brooke wrote to
John Drinkwater early in 1915. Brooke,
Grenfell and Charles Hamilton Sorley
were typical of the earliest Great War
poets. By the end of 1915 all three were
dead, so it is impossible to say how
their fragile Georgian literary equipment
would have stood up to the realities of
Ypres and Passchendaele. Perhaps they
were tougher than we think, but I doubt
it. So much has Brooke come to
symbolise all the golden youth cut down
by the scythe of war that it seems heart-
less to prick the iridescent bubble of his
literary reputation. Grenfell was a versi-
fier rather than a poet. Sorley was the
most interesting of the three; at times
he revealed a muscular, unromantic
quality that makes Brooke and Grenfell
seem flabby by comparison.
However, when we come to the later
Great War poets it is no longer a ques-
tion of breaking butterflies on the critical
wheel. Wilfred Owen and Isaac Rosen-
berg, who were killed in 1918, and
Robert Graves, Edmund Blunden and
Siegfried Sassoon, whose war poems form
only part of long creative careers, deserve
the detailed consideration that Bergonzi
gives them, though of them all Graves
is perhaps the only one who can be
called a major poet in the wider context.
They all began as Georgians and one at
least, Edmund Blunden, has remained
essentially a Georgian all his life. But,
from the outset of the war, there was a
deeper, more reflective and cerebral
quality about their work that set it apart
from that of Brooke and the other young
paladins.
As the apparently mindless and end-
less butchery in Flanders went on they
came to terms with the war in different
ways Graves and Sassoon in savage
irony, Owen in anguished revolt, Blun-
den in stoic acceptance. Owen rebelled
against the very idea that there was any-
thing consciously “literary” about what
he wrote. “I am not concerned with
poetry,” he said. “My subject is war,
and the pity of war.” It is easy enough
to dissect the weaknesses of the war poets
Owen’s shrillness toppling over into
hysteria, the slickness of some of Sas-
soon’s indignation as in the celebrated
lines;
I’d like to see a Tank come down the
stalls,
Lurching to rag-time tunes, or Home
Sweet Home
And there’d be no more jokes in Music-
halls
To mock the riddled corpses round
Bapaume.
There is much of this sort of stuff


pungent, scarifying, vividly reflecting the
reaction of sensitive minds to the out-
rage of war but hardly significant poetry.
Possibly the most enduring poems of the
Great War will be found in a handful of
Blunden’s sombrely evocative lyrics and
in Rosenberg’s extraordinary fusion of
symbolism and the bleakest realism. It
is good to see Bergonzi taking up the
cudgels on behalf of Isaac Rosenberg
for, as the author says, he has been
shabbily treated by anthologists in the
past.
Blunden and Sassoon, however, left
their major contributions to Great War
literature in prose. “Undertones of
War”, which was reprinted only a few
months ago, is undeniably a classic, and
Sassoon’s “Memoirs of a Fox Hunting
Man” and “Memoirs of an Infantry
Officer” have far more enduring qualities
than the throwaway cynicism of much
of his wartime poetry. These books, and
Frederic Manning’s “Her Privates We”
also recently reissued—have a time-
less significance that transcends their
immediate evocation of the waste and
anguish and stupidities of war.
Bergonzi writes about all of them with
insight and intelligence. It is good, also,
to be reminded of other undeservedly
neglected works of fiction and auto-
biography spun out of the Great War
experience. I thoroughly share Bergonzi’s
enthusiasm for Ford Madbx Ford's
“Parade’s End” trilogy and for Herbert
Read’s almost forgotten, brief but mag-
nificent “In Retreat”.

TThese, all beautiful facsimiles of rare
A originals, are a magnificent achieve-
ment and a gift to historical learning in
Australia. The Flinders volumes are so
rare that an original set was recently
sold in Melbourne out of the F. G. Cole
collection for $lO5O and the libraries
which have a set are indeed fortunate.
The enterprise of reproducing them in
facsimile can be described only as epoch-
making, both as to the production, its
quality and the magnitude of the vol-
umes, so nearly perfect that even the
expert might be pardoned during the
first second or two that he handles them
—in believing that he has come upon a
new rebound copy of the original edition.
The technical problems faced were
immense. To produce two large folio
volumes of 900 pages approximately
13} in. x 10 in., with a portfolio con-
taining 15 charts, each about 36 in. x
25 in., plus four sheets containing 28
detailed drawings of capes, harbor
entrances and landfalls and six large
sheets of fine drawings of botanical
specimens, is a daunting task, especially
when it is planned to sell the whole three
pieces for an inclusive $25. The paper
was made specially to match the origin-
als by the Burnie Mills. And the rest of
the detail of -eproduction was to match.
There has been nothing done in historical
publishing in Australia even comparable
with it.
There are still people who believe
that Captain Cook discovered Australia,
a delusion which no doubt will have
great effect in producing contributions
to pay for the silly Endeavour stunt in
which the ship has been rebuilt at im-
mense cost for sailing the old route. All
Cook did was to hit the east coast of
Australia on his way home from observ-
ing the transit of Venus, and make what
would have been a cursory run up that
coast, if he had not been wrecked on
the Barrier Reef and compelled to spend
some weeks on the banks of the En-
deavour River.
The information he left us is often
inaccurate naturally: his charts some-
times look like the amateurish work of
some yachtsman. But Flinders was in an
entirely different category. He was not
associated merely with the rapid obser-
vation of a section of a coastline. He was
an intelligent, experienced and seasoned
seaman. He was meticulous in his work.
His charts set completely new standards,
not merely for mapping in Australian
regions, but for the whole world. They
embody information that never before
had been given on charts, which made
them preferable for use by seamen in
our difficult waters right up into the
twentieth century.
He gave guidance to mariners on those
charts about the prevailing winds and
weather at the seasons when he passed
by. He indicated tracks that should be
followed by day and tracks that could
be safely followed by night. He limned
his coastlines and his shoals with the in-
finite care that he showed in deter-
mining positions. His drawings of harbor
mouths and capes were not the crude
productions of an older day, but with
background hills and features in clear
perspective so that voyagers might judge
their distance from them.
With these techniques he did some-
thing that nobody else had ever done
before. He took the first complete carto-
graphical view of the whole coastline of
any continent. He proved, for the first
time, that Tasmania was an island; he
proved conclusively what —unbelievably
—had never been established, i.e. that
Australia was a whole continent, not a
series of, or two large, islands, a matter
which he was sent in the Investigator,
344 tons, in 1801 to determine.
It was the misfortune of this young
captain who was only 27 when he
began his circumnavigation of Australia
to have returned to England broken
in health and spirit in 1810 when all the
world was immersed in naval warfare.
It was doubly a tragedy that he should
have died before his “Account of a Voy-
age to Terra Australis”, published in May,
1814, should have earned him due recog-
nition.
Of the other Festival books issued by
the Adelaide Library, John West’s two-
volume “History of Tasmania”, from the
original work published in 1852, was a
landmark in historical writing in its day,
though marred to some extent by his
leanings.
Peter Cunningham was a Royal Naval
surgeon who, in a number of letters pub-
lished in two volumes, summed up his
impressions of New South Wales as a
visitor in the 1820 s. His work was a
“best seller” in its day, but the first
edition is now hard to come by and is
worth up to 20 guineas.
Not content with their major essays
in facsimile printing, past, present and
future, which include such large enter-
prises as providing copies of the three
Bigge Reports, the Adelaide librarians
have even gone into the gramophone
recording business, putting on discs the
renderings of “John Manifold and His
Bandicoots”. Their Festival offerings in
this field are long-playing 12-inch plates
featuring songs of “The Homestead and
the Hut” and “Singing to the Cattle”.
Adelaide and culture for ever!

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
What Skills at the Top?
TUST how bad is Australian management? It is not only the governor of the Reserve
** Bank, Dr Coombs, who has a poor opinion of the way companies are run here.
All of a sudden, after years of getting
along without thinking about it, business
men themselves have become really con-
cerned about how their companies should
be managed. Last month’s Potter plan
against professional directors (hardly
even dented by the Dunlop defence) was
only the start of the affair.
Last week, Sydney accountant Mr E. S.
Owens (a director of three largish pub-
lic companies) came out strongly against
the habit of companies having one man
to fill the two top jobs of chairman and
managing director. And the Shareholders’
Association began waging war against
AWA’s proposal to create the title of
president, a post that could be filled by
someone who was not necessarily a direc-
tor and therefore not elected by share-
holders nor responsible to them but
who would nevertheless attend board
meetings.
All this self-analysis clearly suggests
that businessmen think something is
wrong; the disasters of recent times make
that clear enough, anyway. But even more
startling was Dr Coombs’ remarkably
violent attack on the ability of the Aus-
tralian businessman. He told a Perth
audience that almost no phase of Aus-
tralian industrial capacity had lagged so
far behind international standards as its
management; that management skills were
learned here by trial and error, with an
emphasis on error, and that the record of
some companies made one wonder whe-
ther directors were fully informed about
their responsibilities.
Dr Coombs’ views are most significant,
not only because he is clearly right but
because he is prepared to state them so
bluntly. They may also explain why re-
lations between the Reserve Bank and
some businessmen are not as good as they
should be.
Nevertheless, the business community
did not require the stimulus of Dr
Coombs’ assault to prompt it to look
to itself. The attitude taken by Mr Owens
about the combined chairman-managing
director was not that it was impossible
to do both jobs well: “Many successful
companies can be pointed to where this
combined appointment appears to work.”
His objection is that “It is doubtful if
such men breed suitable successors”.
He also warned against the tendency of
allowing a highly competent top executive
to over-centralise, to take everything into
his own hands. “It may work while he is
with the company, but he won’t be there
forever”, so that there is a real danger
that no successor will be bred capable
of running a large centralised organisa-
tion. Mr Owens prefers a series of semi-
autonomous operations that give a far
greater degree of strength and in most
cases build a good competitive team
effort.
And why does he like non-executive
directors on a company’s board? Because,
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : Two (at least) of the recog-
nised unofficial pundits had a go at the economy last
week. Mr Staniforth Ricketson showed no hesitation in
admitting that many non-rural sectors “had experienced
a significant downturn”, yet quoting a friend, with
appropriate qualification, suggested “the difference
between a depression and a boom is to a certain extent
emotional”. Mr Ricketson also flew a kite on an
immediate interim increase in the basic wage . . .
Rather ponderously the Bank of New South Wales
reminded the world that “a heavy burden of responsi-
bility rests on the conciliation and arbitration system
as the leading claims come up for assessment” . . .
Dr Coombs shrewdly opined that the economy had
problems “but presumably it would rarely be without
them” . . . Meanwhile Mr Hawke, still addressing the
Arbitration Commission, would have none of Mr
Ricketson’s idea and argued for annual assessments of
the basic wage, with quarterly adjustments . . . Private
dwelling approvals rose for the fourth successive month
during February; commercial building activity is
declining . . . Production statistics revealed a small
retreat in the output of some basic materials, confirmed
a better trend in building materials and gave no
encouragement for domestic appliances . . . Japan once
more reduced its exports of assembled new cars to
Australia drastically in February; this move is unlikely
to change the Government’s tariff proposals.
For the markets: Although the Australian
share markets finished last week with a reasonable
appearance of firmness, they stood up to quite a few
blows in. the process. Not all of these could be ascribed
to any continued expression of general economic
jaundice. Indeed a number of very special individual
circumstances intervened. There’s hardly any necessity
to point out that the markets did not require any fresh
warnings about factoring. Again the Concrete Industries’
situation was scarcely unexpected. But investors were
called upon to take thought on base metals, particularly
in the light of North Broken Hill’s forecast of lower
earnings and the producer cut in the zinc price. Over
the whole week some of the uncertainty struck at the
leading industrials; even BHP could not live on gas
alone. Most leaders, however, looked better at the
end, while the really acute investor kept on looking
for good second-liners and dabbling in oils . . . London
presumably wanted to do little more than remain calm
in the face of the election storm: the calm became
astonishingly flat, bringing the equity market mildly
lower on very small trading. Sterling’s position has
not given much joy through the campaign. Then, too,
America’s higher interest rate structure suggests a
possible advance in bank rate ... It is hard to use
any other word but mixed for Wall Street, where a
break in a run of largely technical gains occurred on
Wednesday. Volumes ease while considerable dis-
cussion on the chances of higher taxes goes on.
For companies: Sydney Stock Exchange has
tallied the January and February interim reports, finding
211 companies with higher profits (228 last year), 90
with reduced profits (42), and 17 steady (33) . . .An
intervention by Governments and diplomats may be
required to resolve Concrete Industries’ $4.9 million
of claims against the US Navy on the North West
Cape contract, where its chairman, Mr. J. W. Blaiklock,
sees a position both “embarrassing and dangerous” and
cannot think of profits ”. Without making any pro-

unlike the company’s own executives,
they are the people who can take a ..posi-
tion against the strong man in it, so
making certain that too much power is
not centralised in his hands and, incident-
ally, prevent him from being both chair-
man and managing director.
Fifty-one of Australia’s 250 leading
public companies are in the Owens
black list, managerially speaking, by
having a managing director-chairman.
They include Woolworths, Coles, Ansett,
Grace Bros, H. C. Sleigh, Olympic,
Petersville, R. W. Miller, Burns Philp,
Steamships Trading, W. R. Carpenter,
AWA, John Lysaght and Marrickville
Holdings. Some of these “strong men”
have held on to office far too long
mainly because they could not bear to
leave their company and could not
remain on simply a “director” without
some status. Perhaps by creating the post
of president, these men could be encour-
aged to give up the reins a bit sooner
in order to remain in a prestigious posi-
tion in the boardroom.
But what about the debate on the
merits of non-executive directors? Mr
Owens does not think that the old joke
still applies of “the distinction between
a managing director and other directors
is that the managing director knows
where the plant is”. He likes the spirit
of independence brought to board dis-
cussions by an outsider, his breadth of
experience and judgment not tainted by
the conflicting employee relationship.
Again, what about the non-executive
directors whose involvement with “sick”
companies tends to taint their good
companies? Mr Owens even suggested it
was a duty for non-executive directors
to take on one difficult directorship (but
not two as this was a problem, and three
a real headache) to render a service and
to sharpen their facilities. Are there any
altruistic directors in the house?
Overseas Intelligence
TlTith overseas investment here still such
a major factor in Australian econo-
mic health, it is important to know what
the British are being told about the local
scene.
According to the latest quarterly eco-
nomic review of the Economist Intelli-
gence Unit (widely distributed overseas),
things are not too bad here. But for those
with hopes of making a quick capital
profit when interest rates are lowered, the
vision for this contract, the company kept earnings
steady in the December half-year and will consider the
dividend situation in May . . . Talcott Factors joined
the Australian factoring debacle with a loss of $540,000,
including $356,000 against bad debts, and spoke of a
“series of deliberate and substantial frauds” . . . BHP-
Esso’s Gippsland No. 4 yielded another gas flow at
about eight million cubic feet a day; the Associated
Oil group feels confident on supplying natural gas to
Brisbane, even to a possible fertiliser plant; AOG is
collecting royalties from Moonie sales . . . North
Broken Hill predicts a 9.4 p.c. profit drop for 1965-66,
after lower average prices for lead and zinc ... In con-
trast, New Broken Hill earned a peak of £5tg3,178,000
in 1965. £lm. ahead of 1964; the company won't
be permitted to move its domicile from Britain
to Australia . . . The checkerboard of retail trading saw

EIU gives less cheer. It says that not only
are market forces tending to shift senti-
ment away from earlier confidence in a
reduction of interest rates, but that the
Government is itself becoming more re-
luctant to consider a reduction in rates
as long as the level of imports fails to
show really definite signs of coming
down.
“There is a long queue of large bor-
rowers coming on to the capital markets
for money in the first half of this year,”
says EIU, noting that the domestic fixed
investment boom is showing surprising
strength and that stock holdings have not
come down as much as expected.
If the EIU is right about interest
rates, it seems that the stock market re-
covery that was expected after interest
rates went down may be later than hoped.
Overall the EIU is confident: “For the
first time since the war, it now seems pos-
sible that a period of expansion from a
recession phase in the Australian eco-
nomy may not lead to another recession.”
The review adds that the authorities
have been astounded by the extent of
capital inflow, notably from USA, to
finance the mining investment boom.
This has maintained Australia’s interna-
tional reserves despite the slight 1965
fall in exports and a high level of imports.
Bait for West Germany
tedious case of a double taxation
A agreement with West Germany,
which has grown over the years into the
perfect illustration of the “chicken-or-
egg” principle, seems to have moved a
big step closer to a solution. Australia
has, after a lot of stalling, submitted a
draft agreement which is now being
studied in Bonn.
On his recent visit to Australia, the
head of the German Trade Department,
Dr W. Langer, made the point that such
a pact is of real importance to “medium
firms” and that it could result in wide-
spread investments by Germans who are
not likely to buy out existing enterprises
or obtain a dominant position in any
one industry. Overfull employment in
Australia is not a recommendation for
German industrialists, who have been
battling for years with a chronic labor
shortage. The Australian tariff structure
makes up for some of these short-
comings.
Dr Langer is convinced that Australia’s
performance since the end of the war
has bee-n so impressive that the oppor-
tunities here will not escape German
industrialists who are “wide open to the
world”. West Australian bauxite deposits,
among other things, might soon offer a
chance for some active participation.

Dilemmas of Overseas Capital
Two cameos from Western Australia
rpHE long Australia-wide debate on
overseas capital is being dramatised
in West Australia in two telling cameos.
To the north, the problems of Mount
Newman is raising money to build its
port; to the south, the lesser-known but
equally pertinent dilemma of the West-
ern Australia Development Corporation.
Mount Newman, which has won the
biggest contracts so far among the iron
ore developing groups, cannot find the
cash to match the escalating costs in-
volved in working through Port Hedland,
as the company has agreed. The reason:
Australia’s Colonial Sugar Refining Co.,
half-shareholder of the group, is feeling
the pinch. If the other partner, American
Metal Climax, could increase its equity
to make it more like a 65-35 consortium,
or if a second overseas partner could
build up the non-Australian percentage,
then, ironically, the increased costs
would be no real problem. This third
partner is readily available.
The southern dilemma is even simpler.
Here is 4.4 million acres of useless land
being studied by a predominantly over-
seas group with colossal financial and
technological backing. They are paying
their own way in assessing the area,
which is between the Eyre Highway and
the Bight. They are seeing what might
be done with it, given the right injections
of brainpower and finance. They have
promised a 50 per cent Australian share-
holding if they find an economically
feasible scheme (already the Commer-
cial Bank, Australian United Corporation
and another un-named big institutional
investor are participants).
Yet there is no certainty that their
request for an extention of study rights
over the area will be forthcoming, partly
because there is considerable doubt that
Australian investors would put up
enough long-term risk capital to let them
fulfil that part of the bargain.
The two key men involved in the
southern project are Harvard-educated
lawyers Frank Davidson and Cyril
Means. At a casual Greenwich Village
luncheon in November, 1956, they started
wheels turning on a project that almost
certainly will result in a tunnel under
the English Channel starting next year.
Such is the level of their associations.
Yet even with this backing, it is a toss-up
on the outcome of the simple alternative:
leave the study area as wasteland or have
it potentially productive at the cost
of increasing the level of overseas equity
in Australian enterprise.
“The speed of development we must
achieve in West Australia will be pos-
sible in the immediate future only with
the help of overseas funds,” says Mr
Charles Court, Minister for Industrial
Development. “Events at Mount New-
man over the past few days have high-
lighted something this Government has
known for a long time . . . that there
simply isn’t enough money available in
Australia to develop the country at the
rate it should be developed.”
Some aspects of Australia's attitude
to development had the ingredients of
soap-opera, Mr Court suggested. “It’s a
strange thing the way so many Aus-
tralians talk of a place as a wasteland,
the back of beyond, and all the rest. . .
yet as soon as someone comes along and
offers to help them do something with
it, they say: ‘Keep hold of. it. It might
he worth something. Protect our heri-
tage’. It would be pure comedy if it
weren't such a tragedy.”

Producers Cut Zinc Prices
Free market may also weaken
T AST week’s cut in the producer price of zinc may be the last change for some time,
but further price weaknesses for both zinc and lead seem likely on the free market
later this year or next.
The producer price of zinc is the most
important to Australian miners. Its likely
stability is based on a statement from Rio
Tinto-Zinc Corporation chairman, Mr
Val Duncan, that “we have now achieved
our objective”. This seems to preclude
any further reduction until “present world
conditions” change.
The major world producers (including
Australia’s Broken Hill operators) estab-
lished a fixed selling price of £stgl2s a
ton in July, 1964 abandoning the
London free market price formerly used
as a basis. London Metal Exchange prices
at the time were around £l4O.
Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation, leader of
the move, said LME prices were “unrea-
listic” and hoped that levels around
£9O-100 would eventually be set for the
producer price. However, other producers
didn’t want to give away too much,
although a £l5 cut was made a few
months later.
After several years below £9O a ton
(and as low as £6O in 1962), zinc prices
had began to rise late in 1963. The basis
for the rise was the period of low prices
and under-expansion of output from 1958
to 1962. Huge stocks built up in 1957-58
had cut prices and concealed the under-
lying shortage of production.
The first half of 1964 was probably the
tightest period of the two years 1964
and 1965. Since then the situation has
improved, helped by US stockpile sales
and rapid mine expansion.
An overall world surplus seems likely
for this year as a whole; the outlook is
for this excess of production to con-
tinue, with several large mines nearing
production.
By June, 1965, LME prices had re-
turned to below £llO a ton for the first
time since April, 1964. Since then major
producers are believed to have been buy-
ing on the LME to hold free-market
prices near the fixed level incidentally
making a profit when reselling at £llO.
RT-Z has for some time been in the
van of the “enlightened” producers. These
argue that extra profits in the short run
do not compensate for the loss of markets
to plastics and aluminium in the long
run. So Mr Duncan’s rather definite pro-
nouncements last week assume extra
significance.
Last year both New Broken Hill Con-
solidated and RT-Z, its major shareholder
(through Conzinc Riotinto of Australia),
indicated that a combined lead-zinc price
of £175 a ton was entirely satisfactory.
[Even a cut to £9O for zinc would leave
a combined lead-zinc price of more than
£l9O with the present lead price. For
many years to mid-1964 the combined
price did not touch £190.]
For RT-Z costs have risen since last
year’s statements, not to mention the
added burden of the new UK Corpora-
tion tax, about which RT-Z has com-
plained bitterly. Now that the UK Chan-
cellor has refused permission for New
Broken Hill to “emigrate” to Australia,
it too will be hit by the tax.
All in all, the bloom is certainly gone
from both zinc and lead. One firm of
metal brokers says of lead prices: “We
see little likelihood of any advance being
sustained, and rallies should be looked
upon as good selling opportunities”.
Australian lead-zinc miners, under-
standing the uncertain ways of commod-
ity prices, have taken advantage of the
recent boom to spread their already
well-diversified interests into shares,
exploration, or new mining and metal-
lurgical developments.
nPHE London zircon market has recently
"*■ weakened after two years’ rise.
Merchants’ price indications have been
around £stg27j to £291 a ton for stand-
ard grade material, compared with £2B
to £3O a month ago and £29 to £3l at
the beginning of the year. A year ago
£22 was being quoted.
Reaction to the long uptrend was not
unexpected. It is probably timely, for
zircon can be replaced in most of its
applications which include ceramics
and refractory bricks.
Zircon is an inevitable by-product of
Australia's rutile production.
A s expected, the new pricing policy for
US stockpile releases of tungsten
ores has weakened the London “free”
market. Two weeks ago the General Ser-
vices Administration announced plans to
release 5 million lbs of wolfram in con-
centrates on an “off-the-shelf” basis. In
February, 1.5 million lbs had been sold
by competitive bidding.
The latest move represents a drastic
switch of policy in the six-month-old
surplus disposal programme. The price
set was equivalent to 3605. stg a long ton
unit (22.4 lb of wolfram in concentrates),
compared with a UK free-market price
range of 3625. 6d. to 3755. before the
new policy was known, and 3355. to
3455. soon after.
Because of the US tariff barrier, the
world price must fall to 2905. to compete
with the GSA for American users. At
any rate, America only imported 4 mil-
lion lbs in 1965, so the releases will cut
off US buying and may (though this is
not certain) bring some selling.
The free market for wolfram (and
scheelite, the other main tungsten ore)
is volatile. After a very strong rise—since
the middle of last year it is susceptible
to bearish influences. The long-term out-
look is basically dependent on China's
sales. At present these show no signs of
increasing.
HPhe copper market has also been upset
A by US stockpile sales recently
President Johnson announced a 200,000
short ton sale last week. This will help
fill the strike-created gap between pro-
duction and demand that promises to
continue for some time yet. The two-
month-long strike at one of the world’s
half-dozen largest mines, in Chile, has
ended, but troubles in that country and
Zambia are far from over.
prices have risen rather un-
steadily for several months, after
last year’s plunge to levels that, in pur-
chasing power, were lower than pre-
viously recorded. The outlook seems
bullish.
Top merchant Gill and Dufas recently
estimated that the production gap in
1966 will be 170,000 tons. World stocks
will continue to decline, absorbing pre-
vious surpluses. “The key question is,
therefore, whether next year’s production
will again reach record levels which will
be necessary to sustain the present rate
of world usage.”
As with the wool processers, raw
material price moves are of considerable
influence on year-to-year profit fluctua-
tions for chocolate makers. Cadbury-Fry-
Pascall, Australia’s leading cocoa and
chocolate manufacturer, last year pro-
vided $BOO,OOO to write down stocks of
cocoa beans and cocoa butter to year-
end market values. A further $460,000
was provided for possible losses on beans
not yet delivered.
For the producers the situation is more
straightforward, although most produce
copra as well and prices for this are at
an 18-month low in London.

MARKET POINTERS
Wait to Buy Sugar Shares
Some domestic and international factors
By JASON
IiyHEN will it be the right time to buy
sugar shares?
On the face of it, things now look a
little “less worse” in the sugar business
than they did last year. To prove it, the
Queensland sugar share price index has
gone up by about nine p.c. from its
level of last December. It is, however,
still less than half its 1964 peak, which
at least provides investors with something
to aim at in any recovery that might
come although prospects of hitting
this level again do not look too bright.
Probably the most cheerful thing about
sugar at present is the agreement reached
by the world sugar trade on a minimum
price of £stg23 10s. a ton. This may not
seem too wonderful against the prices of
over £stgloo of a couple of years ago,
yet it is a lot better than the £stglB or
so ruling on the free sugar market re-
cently.
Only a small proportion of Australia’s
sugar is sold at free market, prices; most
goes under agreements of one kind or
another, with the “mill peaks” set for
sugar millers being their guaranteed sale
level at agreed prices, which are far
higher, on average, than current world
prices but far lower than in times of sugar
shortage.
This better news for sugar does not
necessarily mean that sugar shares should
be bought right now. In the next few
weeks the five sugar milling companies
whose books balance at the end of De-
cember will be publishing their accounts
for 1965. Some of these, particularly in
the drought-stricken Bundaberg area, will
have very sad tales to tell. The market
may not like hearing them. The com-
panies soon to report are Pioneer, Plane
Creek, Fairymead, Gibson and Howes,
and Moreton Central.
On this score alone, it may be wise to
wait for a month or two. Even more im-
portant, it may also be wiser to see whe-
ther the international sugar trade is going
gradually to ease the price of sugar back
up to more reasonable levels. Prices
around £stg3o would be a good objective.
In addition, there is no guarantee that
the minimum price arrangement is going
to work. There is something like 300,000
tons of sugar floating around in specula-
tors’ hands at present, much of it bought
at very cheap prices. The firmer market
will probably have to put up with great
lumps of this speculative sugar coming
on to take its profit. Fears that the market
may not be able to cope could explain
some of the uneasiness in “futures”
trading at present.
So, for those counter-cyclical investors
who make real money in commodities,
it seems unwise to move into sugar before
the April meeting of the world traders,
to start with. After that? The next most
important time is from August on, when
the first indications of the European crop
start to filter through from Lichts, the
expert forecasters. By then the Austra-
lian crop has well and truly got under
way, so that may be leaving it too late
to make the most of any recovery that
may come to sugar shares.
Apart from a few projects still to be
completed, this will be a consolidation
year for sugar companies after the hectic
expansion of last year, which unfortun-
ately coincided with the collapse of the
high world sugar price.
For 1966, increases in mill peak have
been granted to 17 of the 31 Queensland
sugar mills but they are all relatively
small. Even the industry’s giant, CSR,
only scores an extra 29,000 tons to
401,000 tons. Australian Estates gains
4000 to 87,000 tons for its Kalamia mill,
Maryborough 1500 tons to 38,000 tons,

Moreton Central 1500 tons to 37,000
tons.
Haughton, Plane Creek and Fairymead
peaks are unchanged at 60,500, 75,500
and 67,000 tons respectively. Gibson and
Howes gets another 1500 tons to 71,500,
Millaquin gains 1000 to 101,000 tons,
and Pioneer 2000 to 186,000 tons.
Not all these companies had been able
to reach these peaks last year, anyhow,
because of the drought affecting cane
available for crushing and the sugar con-
tent of the cane not to mention the
more oppressive factor of the continued
slump in world sugar prices.
Millaquin failed to reach mill peak
of 100,000 tons 94 n.t. sugar by 25,050
tons. Fairymead was also troubled; out-
put was about two-thirds normal, and the
estimated 1965 sugar production is
50,000 tons compared with mill peak of
67,000 tons, from about 400,000 tons
of cane.
Gibson and Howes complained that
1965 weather conditions were the worst
for more than 30 years. Although in
normal seasons, it should experience no
difficulty in filling the 1965 quota of
70,000 tons from the assigned areas,
sugar manufactured last season was only
32,060 tons.
Likewise, Maryborough Sugar said
the 1965 crop was generally poor,
creating problems in milling, and the
sugar content was extremely low. Pro-
duction at 16,910 tons was almost half
that for 1964 and well short of the mill
peak of 36,500 tons.
Production of Moreton Central fell in
1965 from 38,000 to 28,000 tons of
sugar, 7500 tons short of the mill peak.
However, 1966 season’s prospects are
good. Moreton expects a satisfactory crop
to justify its recent capital expenditure
on expansion of $900,000.
Tt is noteworthy that all these companies
produce in the Bundaberg district.
So it seems likely that millers in this area
could provide the greatest scope for re-
covery, and tell the saddest stories for
1965, when their results come out. It
seems wisest to wait for these before buy-
ing; the market can hardly be expected
to go up on what they will have to say.
Some companies stand to gain from
their other activities this year. Pastoral
operations could be an important factor
in Fairymead’s results in 1966 and Milla-
quin’s sugar refining operations (the only
other refiner outside CSR) should become
increasingly significant. CSR’s fortunes
are more and more wrapped up in its
non-sugar operations, but sugar still re-
mains dominant.
In the background, there is the nagging
thought that perhaps the Vietnam situa-
tion could bring about the same boost to
sugar prices as the Korean War did. So
far this has not happened at all, but a
US sugar broker, Lamborn and Co.,
thinks that any escalation of the Vietnam
war could bring some pressures on sugar
prices and advises its clients to get “a
certain amount of forward coverage at
satisfactory levels”. But it discounts
prospects of a Korean-type boom. In
1950-51, US sugar supplies, other than
from domestic beet, mainland cane,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands, came very largely from Cuba
(about 40 p.c.) and the Philippines, with
other foreign countries providing less
than 70,000 tons of a total 8.7 m. tons.
Sugar producers in the rest of the Ame-
ricas (particularly Mexico, Dominican
Republic, Brazil, Peru and the British
West Indies) have scored from the rise of
Castroism. Their 1966 quotas amount to
almost 2m. short tons, raw value. Like-
wise Australia’s quota is 168,754 tons.
Furthermore, world stocks today repre-
sent about 29 p.c. of world consumption,
compared with 23 p.c. for the crop year
1949-50.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Disappearing Growth Rate
J. Fielding leans on investments
TifHEN I looked at Reed Paper Products
last week, the share price was well
below the low price for 1965. J. Fielding
and Co. Limited's shares, on the other
hand, seem to be staging a minor re-
covery for, at the time of writing, they
are quoted at buyer $3.60, seller $3.65,
with the last sale having taken place at
$3.55. These prices suggest that a further
rise is in prospect, although the shares are
standing above the low price for 1965
and getting close to the- high price for
1966.
At $3.70 (the 1966 high price), the
market capitalisation of J. Fielding is
nearly $9.5 million. Ignoring the com-
pany’s investments in “unlisted securities”,
the market value of its other investments,
even with an allowance for a forced sale,
would be about $5 million. So for a net
$4.5 million one can acquire a business
which seems to be earning about $650,000
before tax. The after-tax return on the
net market capitalisation would be about
8.3 p.c. One would hardly have thought
that this return would have attracted the
“takeover merchants” who always seem
to be on the prowl in this industry, but
there could always be other rewards to
a successful bidder which are not appar-
ent to the man in the street.
In 1922, J. Fielding acquired its in-
terest in Corrugated Fibre Containers
Pty Ltd of Melbourne. This latter com-
pany has a joint interest with Reed Paper
Products in Fibreboard Containers Pty
Ltd of Adelaide. Futhermore,, the
Fielding group also has a 20 p.c. in-
terest in Tasmanian Containers Pty Ltd,
as does Reed Paper Products. While
.such associations do not necessarily
mean that closer links may be formed,
there is presumably always a prospect
that the two companies may seek to
merge, particularly if competition con-
tinues to get keener.
Probably, the next major move of the
group did not occur until 1961, when
operations were transferred from the
Buckingham Street building to Kings-
grove. Since the end of World War 11,
the various activities of the company had
been split off into several subsidiaries.
A subsidiary had also been formed to
undertake general building and contract-
ing work, mainly in respect of the group’s
own properties. Until 1962 (when the
new Companies Act became law), the
accounts published annually were rather
sparse in information, so it is rather
difficult to trace the history of the group
in any detail.
The figures given in the accounts were
also rather limited; no consolidated
accounts were produced nor was the tax
provision ever stated. As a result, there
is only one comparison which can be
made before and after 1962 and that is
the dividends per share record.
The last cash issue to shareholders
seems to have been made in 1932, but
since that time the company has made
six bonus issues. These issues, coupled
with increases in the actual rate of divi-
dend, have had the effect of raising
dividends per share from 2.25 cents in
1934 to the present 17.5 cents an in-
crease of 675 p.c. This would indicate a
rate of growth over the whole period of
thirty-one years of 7 p.c. per annum
compound on average. There can be no
doubt that there are not many companies
which can claim such a record, even
over a short period of five years during
the boom of the ’fifties.
TJHhere are, however, signs that the rate
of growth has diminished. Over the
last five years it has disappeared, for the
dividend rate has remained unchanged
at 17i p.c. while the last bonus issue
was made in November, 1961. From
1935 to 1940, dividends per share in-
creased at an average annual compound
rate of 4.7 p.c. From 1940 until 1945 the
rate of increase was 4.4 p.c. Then in
successive five-year periods, the rate of
increase was 6.4 p.c., 17.7 p.c., 8.8 p.c.,
and 3.1 p.c. The question now is whether
any further growth is likely in the fore-
seeable future.
The trend in net profit before tax and
depreciation but after income from listed
securities over the last four years has
been as follows:
Year to Sept. 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
s'ooo . 1097 934 990 1001
These figures indicate a fall of nearly
15 p.c. from 1962 to 1963. Since then the
trend has been upward, with a 6 p.c. in-
crease from 1963 to 1964 and an in-
crease of just over 1 p.c. from 1964 to
1965. In this last year, the comparability
of the two figures is somewhat in doubt
because the balance date of the parent
company was changed to June 30 and the
figure for income from listed investments
given in the 1964 report is different
from that appearing in the 1965 report
as the comparable figure for 1964. In-
come from listed investments has in-
creased at an average annual compound
rate of about 7i p.c. but listed invest-
ments at cost have increased during the
same period at the average annual com-
pound rate of 1 li p.c.
None of these figures would seem to
indicate a growth situation. It would be
rather surprising to find any such situ-
ation when investments in listed securi-
ties, Government and semi-Government
bonds, loans on mortgage and deposits
at call form more than fifty per cent of
total assets. In other words, the existence
of this substantial investment portfolio
must have some depressive effect on the
share price. Looking at the current earn-
ings yields on investment companies’
shares, we find that they tend to vary
quite markedly and the ratio which is
most comparable is the dividend yields.
However, I think that it is reasonable to
place a valuation on the investment port-
folio of ten times earnings and on the
container business of fourteen times
earnings.
Whether fourteen times earnings may
not be a little high having regard to the
low growth rate of recent years can only
be a matter of opinion. This method of
valuation gives a price of $3.20 per
share and at the current rate of dividend
this price would show an immediate
dividend yield of 5i p.c., which is
very much higher than has been available
over the last four years.

TOP CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURER REPORTS OUTSTANDING
SUCCESSES WITH GTV9 SATURATION CAMPAIGNS AT
EASTER AND CHRISTMAS.
Red Tulip, leading name in fine, quality choco-
lates, has chosen GTV9 exclusively for its
Television campaign forthis Easter. Reasons?
Previous Christmas and Easter campaigns by
Red Tulip on GTV9 have paid off handsomely,
reaping worthwhile profits and making a vital
contribution towards building the Red Tulip
image of quality.
Why GTV9 exclusively? This example will
give a good indication. A recent Anderson
survey of Graham Kennedy's In Melbourne
Tonight shows the following viewing:
In one week 684,000 different people
representing a cumulative rating of 58% or
294,000 different families.
These figures fitted in admirably with the
Easter buying pattern, as experienced by
Red Tulip.
By buying GTV9 exclusively Red Tulip
achieved maximum reach and frequency with
a combination of peak and off-peak com-
mercials. This is saturation advertising at its
best and most profitable.
There are many benefits for advertising
solus on GTV9. It’s more than worth while to
contact this Channel. You could well be
presented with an outstanding proposal,
whether it be for sole sponsorship, joint
sponsorship, or ‘spot’ package promotions.
Ask your advertising agency to find out.

MAN ON THE LAND
Wheat Stabilisation Plots?
Some abuses of orderly marketing
A ccording to Mr Phil Meehan, presi-
dent of the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association, there is a
plot in the land to abolish wheat stabili-
sation and all forms of orderly market-
ing. The Bulletin, he says, is in the
very front rank of plotters.
This is all good stuff if one does
not take it too seriously.
Mr Meehan knows full well, or should,
that it is not wheat stabilisation per se
that has been the object of The Bulle-
tin’s interest, but the way in which the
stabilisation system has been used to
put more and more money into the
pockets of growers at the expense of the
taxpayers. Stabilisation was never in-
tended to do this. It was intended to
strike a fair balance between the inter-
ests of the farmer and the urban dweller.
Yet because of the unceasing activity of
the farm pressure groups, such as Mr
Meehan’s own, and the Liberal Party's
dependence on the Country Party, the
odds have increasingly favored the
farmer.
However, Mr Meehan dobs raise an
interesting point. Frankly, we were not
aware that wheat stabilisation was due
for a renegotiation in about two years’
time. Periodic adjustments to the cost
divisor come up from time to time.
Apparently, or so Mr Meehan says, the
legislative framework is due for another
look. We do not anticipate any strong
move on the part of farmers aimed at
discarding the whole box and dice.
Considering the way it has worked
for them, they would be unlikely to
discard it and no one is likely to take it
away from them if it is fairly adminis-
tered. But farmers might as well get
used to the idea that increasing numbers
of urban Australians are resentful of
farmer moaning (and moaning is the
right word) which invariably results in
bigger Government (taxpayer) hand-
outs.
Of course there are those thinkers who
have always contended that any planned
system of marketing must, inevitably,
lead to abuses. Farmers can either cor-
rect the abuses or encourage them and
so influence public opinion one way or
the other.
Mr Meehan’s own remarks, on other
matters, in his presidential address at
the recent annual meeting of his organi-
sation, rather prove our point that
farmers are their own worst enemies.
“Illegal selling of barley must be^stamped
out,” he said. By illegal selling of barley
he means barley sold by contract or to
merchants, and not to the Australian
Barley Board (so-called) which operates
in only two States. Who grows barley?
Why, the very same fellows who grow
wheat, of course, and probably some
members of Mr Meehan’s own organisa-
tion. What is he going to do? Put them
in gaol? Let’s have some common sense.
“The law relating to land valuation
must be altered”, said Mr Meehan. “One
of two things must happen in the near
future either the present system must
go and make way for a better one, or
our legislators must make way for others
who will rectify the law.” This is good
stuff, too.
Why are land valuations so high? One
reason, probably the main one, is the
taxation benefits, orderly marketing
devices, and other governmental lar-
gesse bestowed upon farming. Another
is the current rural activity of buying
up adjoining properties as fast as they
become available. No farmer ever has
enough land. Apparently plenty of farm-
ers have enough money to bid up for
farms and, consequently, the valuations
go up, too.
Of course farm pressure groups main-
tain that it is “city businessmen” who
are buying up the farms and forcing up
valuations. Any kind of a check shows
that whilst some city businessmen do
buy farms the majority of farms are
bought by people who are already
farmers.
Mr Meehan’s organisation is probably
more devoted to the orderly marketing
principle than any other in the country.
Orderly marketing may be described as
paternalistic, if you like, or welfarist, or
even socialistic. With all the demands
for more and more Government subsidy
for this and for that, we note that not
once, ever, have we encountered a
farmer who supports what could be
termed the logical conclusion of blind
faith in orderly marketing. We have
waited long, and will wait forever prob-
ably, for the day when an orderly
marketing man declares that private
ownership of farming land is illogical.
We find, therefore, that the orderly
marketing adherent is, in 1966, in a
quandary. He wants more Government
subsidy, but at the same time he wants
absolute freehold of his property, which
is valued so highly that the only people
who could possibly buy it from him, if
he wished to realise, would be another
farmer or a city businessman with a tax

problem. Yet all this started back in
the 19305, when it was so very simple
to take sides. You were either a squatter
or a cocky. You were rich, or you had
what you stood up in and a horse and
cart. The farm, if you walked off it (and
many did), was worth the survey fee.
What is disappointing in Mr Meehan’s
speech of 1966 is that there is no recog-
nition of the one development which
could be a way out of the maze. This is
contract buying. Contract buying could
(we do not say will) remove the in-
iquities of orderly marketing yet retain
private ownership.
Mr Meehan, who doubtless remembers
the days when he drove the horse and
cart into town with his wheat and sold
it to the merchant, clearly makes no
differentiation between contract buying
and merchant buying. There is a cardinal
difference. Merchant buying is a tradi-
tional middleman operation; contract
buying is a direct transaction between
producer and processor. Private sales of
barley are as high as they are at present
because the growers are on contract.
(Very little is merchant bought.)
Tn Australia no farm organisations are
contract minded. They are either ord-
erly marketing (the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers, United Farmers of NSW,
etc.) or free enterprise (Graziers’ Asso-
ciations). In the United States, interest-
ingly enough, farmers also are apparent-
ly incapable of unity. In the US we have
three major farm groups. The Farm
Bureau Federation leans to free enter-
prise and a minimum of Government
interference. The National Farmers*
Union favors more Government subsidies
and price controls. The Grange favors
contracts through bargaining. All Ameri-
can organisations, and we go along with
this, seem to have an awareness that
plans often build up as they go along.
Checks and balances, in the US, are
respected.
Because of the apparent lack of
interest in the contract system on the
part of Australian farm organisations
both the advantages, and the disadvan-
tages, of the system are being overlooked
while the system itself is gaining.
Practically all broiler chicken pro-
duction now is on contract and a grow-
ing proportion of vegetables. It is also
apparent in barley, oats, pigs and some
beef. Advantages would appear to be
that the efficient producer gets more than
the inefficient and that contract farming
is a way in which young men can at least
break into farming without having great
capital. Disadvantages would appear to
be that the issuer of contracts, if and
when he achieves a monopoly control,
can adjust the price to suit himself. This
is where collective bargaining should
come in.

PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
The Directors ot PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L.
advise that the following announcement was made
to the Australian Stock Exchanges and Press on
the 24th March, 1966
PLANET'S NEW BASE METAL PROSPECTS
A Company field party operating by helicopter
has been successful in locating a number of very
large base metal prospects in an extensive mineral-
ised area in the Petermann Ranges in the south-
west corner of the Northern Territory.
Planet Mining Company Pty. Ltd.—a fully owned
subsidiary of Planet Oil Company N.L.—holds the
whole of, this area under a Prospecting Authority.
A series of gossans each extending over several
miles has been Ideated. Grab samples containing
high silver and significant lead, copper and gold
values were collected.
Gossan and ironstone outcrops which occupy
similar structural positions occur in the same
geological formation, and in one case extend for
over twenty miles. (A gossan is the leached iron-
stone capping above sulphide mineralisation.)
An interesting geochemical anomaly suggesting
possible copper, lead and silver mineralisation has
been discovered in the rocks adjacent to an intrusive
granite contact.
Another helicopter-equipped field party will sample
these prospects in more detail shortly. A detailed
photogeological study is in progress and an aero-
magnetic survey over selected areas will commence
immediately.
Private Buying of Wool
A reply from Woolcombers
TV/lAN ON THE LAND’S views on direct wool sales are answered by Mr J. A.
Thompson, vice-chairman and managing director of the big English processor,
Woolcombers Ltd:
It is indeed necessary to comment on
your article “A Threat from Private
Buying?” which appeared in “Man on
the Land” (8., March 19). As you
state, “According to Disraeli there is no
wisdom like frankness”. With this I
would agree, but would also draw your
attention to Francis Bacon’s possibly
more pertinent quotation, “What is
Truth? said the Jesting Pilate, and would
not stay for an answer”.
I will endeavor, as succinctly as pos-
sible, to refer only to particular aspects
of your article which require correction
or, at least, readjustment of invalid and
inApt implication.
Woolcombers Ltd. does not in the
conduct of its business in any way deal
in threats or implied threats. Nor is its
managing director, namely myself, or
my board, “popular” with the Wool
Board or, to our knowledge, woolgrowers
who voted “yes” in the recent referen-
dum on the reserve price scheme.
The viewpoints expressed with regard
to the industrialists’ necessity to establish
an infinitely greater degree of price
stability is not only the opinion of Wool-
combers Ltd., but of the great majority
of all industrial organisations buying, pro-
cessing and converting wool. This can
easily be established by reference to the
relevant wool textile industries concerned.
I would hope that my company may
continue to buy and process larger
weights of wool and surely this is to the
advantage of the woolgrower and the
industry.
It is necessary immediately to refute
your unpleasant implication that Wool-
combers Ltd. or any of our affiliate
companies has been a preferential bene-
ficiary of IWS promotion efforts, and
I trust that you will apologise for this
unwarranted implication.
It has never been stated that Wool-
combers Ltd. is the largest individual
buyer of Australian wool; it has been
stated that, so far as one can establish,
Woolcombers is the largest processor of
wool and the largest woolbuyer in all
available centres in relation to its top-
making production. It is not correct for
you to state that “We know the US
industry’s view of the reserve price plan
irrefutably against”. You may know
the opinion of the Boston Wool Trade
Association, primarily representing the
merchants’ viewpoint. I would advise
you also to seek the opinion of the US
industrial buyer-processors.
The United Kingdom is far from, as
you state, “sadly lacking” in wool: the
export markets for wool tops developed
and maintained by the UK industry are
of tremendous importance to Australia
and I have not heard one Australian
comment in contradiction of this obvious
fact. The UK has been quick to invest
both capital, machinery and technique in
centres suitable for wool development,
both on the Continent and in Asia.
f am right to be concerned. It would
be a blind Australia were she not also
concerned, although this concern does
not seem to be shared by your journal.
I am glad you have referred to the
practical commerce of Mr J. Ackland,
chairman of the New Zealand Wool
Board. Regrettably, you have sought to
misuse his quotation, but he does state,
in relation to the New Zealand scheme,
“but it did give confidence to the trade
and so had a steadying effect”.
There is no close affinity between Sir
William Gunn and myself other than a
sensible common opinion with regard to
the advantages of a reserve price scheme.
I fully agree with your final paragraph,
possibly not in your sense. I quote, “the
refusal to let the matter rest may give
woolgrowers better insight into real aims
and objectives”. Indeed let it be so and
the future of the industry, as a conse-
quence, will be more secure.
(Man On The Land will reply to Mr
Thompson next week.)

Matters of Froth and Bubble
Those foaming capuccinos
Tendings by the CSIRO Division of
Dairy Research, Melbourne, should
put an end to plaints from milk and
espresso bar keepers that the milk does
not foam sufficiently sometimes to satisfy
customers. Wholesale dairymen in most
of Australia’s capital cities, where finical
milk drinkers abound, have been harassed
by querulous shopowners. Their peevish-
ness is most frequent at this time of year.
One restaurateur, while discussing
with his dairyman the lack of froth on
his capuccino, happened to remark that
he had set aside one batch of milk which
had failed to foam after steam heating
in the usual way. Next day he needed
this milk and steam heated it again. Lo
and behold, it foamed wonderfully. This
clue quickly enabled the dairy scientists
to work out a practical solution to the
problem. After checking other samples
of poor-foaming milk they were satis-
fied that the restaurateur’s observation
applied generally. Furthermore, the
scientists found that if the milk was
homogenised (a mechanical process in
which the fat globules are broken into
tiny particles) as well as heated it re-
covered its foaming ability even better.
Accordingly, the wholesale dairies
have now been advised to homogenise
and pasteurise at a high temperature
(at least 170 degrees F), milk intended
for the bar trade. This recommendation
will not present any serious organisa-
tional difficulties. Most milk bars in the
Melbourne area, for instance, already
use homogenised milk to avoid the risk
of being prosecuted for selling low-fat
milk. Unless the barman remembers to
stir ordinary milk thoroughly, his first
dippings from the can skim off the cream.
Some early troubles will arise in the
coffee shops, however, since they get
their milk in bottles rather than cans,
which are too big; and the Australian
wholesale dairies do not yet offer homo-
genised milk in small one-pint con-
tainers. They are now planning to intro-
duce the quart and half-gallon containers
popular in the USA.
While the combination of homogeni-
sation and high-temperature pasteurisa-
tion provides an immediate practical
means of overcoming the problem, it
does not tackle the cause. The research
showed that the frothy character of milk
is mainly impaired down on the farm.
Additional loss occurs during transpor-
tation to the city and in the dairy. Lipase,
an anti-froth enzyme, is naturally present
in the fat globules of milk. Violent agita-
tion damages the globules and the
enzyme is released.
In autumn, when the cows are near-
ing the end of their lactation and yield
is low, the milk gets splashed around

more, especially in large, partly-filled
vats. Thus, farms using the can milking
system usually produce milk that foams
better than the milk from farms with
pipeline milking machines and bulk
tanks. The worst sample found during
the study came from a farm where the
cows were drying off, the milk had been
run over a cooler and then pumped to
a bulk tank. There it was kept stirred
with an agitator, only half immersed,
until four milkings had accumulated by
the time the pick-up tanker made its
regular call. This milk would be subjected
later to more severe disturbance during
transport, discharge through the tanker’s
high speed pump, and in the treatment
plant of the city dairy.
The loss of frothing caused by lipase
activity marks the first stage of a process
leading to rancidity. Though milk-shake
and capuccino drinkers have not yet
remonstrated about off-flavours, there
remains some risk that they will be given
cause to do so unless more gentle
methods of handling milk can be devised.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Plaudits for the Exchange
That snappy new Gazette
rpHE Stock Exchange came in for some criticism by the Press for its handling of the
Amalgamated Chemicals affair. This included wild accusations about misleading
investors during the takeover battle between Dow and Continental. For what can
only be described as a complicated situation, I do not think the Stock Exchange could
have simplified the matter any further.
Very rightly Jason pointed out last
week that an American company gaining
partial control of a local company was
not the be-all-and-end-all as far as local
investors were concerned. Australian
Chemical shareholders would be con-
scious of this fact. Continental Oil has
suddenly assumed glamor status here.
Yet how many investors had heard of
Continental Oil before this takeover
battle erupted?
What with Amalgamated Chemicals
and the new Gazette, the Sydney Stock
Exchange has had a busy week. What
an excellent job has been done on the
Gazette. It seems incredible how much
statistical information on each company
can be included in one line. To me the
most useful new data was the profit
figures for the last three years, the state
of interim trading, and the share turn-
over for the last two months.
Take my first purchase of the week,
W. R. Carpenter. I can immediately see
that profits have steadily risen in the
last three years although earning rate
has slipped slightly; furthermore that the
turnover is large enough that I need have
no worry about getting out.
While this is useful background in-
formation, the decision to buy was based
purely on technical grounds. The shares
suffered a heavy fall last year from a
peak price of $3.85. Towards the end
of last year the price steadied at just
above $2 and then began to move up-
wards. A reaction at $2.75 to this newly
formed upward trend has given me the
opportunity of coming in at $2.58.
The other purchase for the week was
Concrete Industries. Although I hesitate
to use the cliche “Buy on bad news”, it
does describe exactly the motive behind
this purchase (at an average price of
27c). Very emphatically I want to say
that as soon as the share price hits 33c
I’ll be out. If it does not react as well
as I hope, it may become a case of bail-
ing out earlier. The company should be
able to pull through its present troubles,
yet it’s dangerous to expect too much
from the share price in the months ahead.
What has caused this price collapse?
Not so much what was said in the interim
report but what was not said in it. The
American partner in the North-West
Cape, Paul Hardeman, SA, was unable
to continue last year, resulting in Con-
crete Industries assuming sole responsi-
bility. Since then a substantial increase
in costs has occurred so that several
million dollars are now owed. Also hang-
ing over the company is the Hurstville
project.
Sales for the week were the 500 Peters-
ville at 63c and the 200 Mt Morgan at
$2.10. President Johnson releasing more
copper from his stockpile has triggered
my selling decision with Mt Morgan.
With the interim dividend thrown in,
Mt Morgan proved a break-even pro-
position, whereas Petersville showed a
$25 profit.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 W. R. Carpenter, $2.58 $527
500 Concrete Ind., 27c $l3B
SOLD
500 Petersville, 63c $3OB
200 Mt Morgan (x-div.), $2.10 . $412
The account is still in credit to the
tune of $456.
