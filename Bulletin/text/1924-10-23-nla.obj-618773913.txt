the Res Page
A Squire of Dames
Although the officers of the First Fleet
left several valuable printed records of the
foundation of British Australasia at Port
Jackson and the voyage thither from Eng-
land, there yet remain to be published in
book form a few journals and observations
that are no less valuable than those which
survive as printed volumes. The diary and
letters of Mr. Midshipman Daniel South-
well, of H.M.S. Sirius, have been printed in
the liistoi-ical Records of N. S. Wales, as
have many other more fragmentary docu-
ments ; but there is one journal that still
exists only in the faded, angular handwriting
of its author, part of which, at any rate,
might with advantage be made available, by
publication, to students of Australian his-
tory who have not ready access to the Mit-
chell Library, where the old MS. volume
now reposes. It is that of Dr. Arthur Bowes,
or Bowes-Smyth, surgeon of the Lady Pen-
rhyn, female convict transport, which arrived
in Port Jackson with her ten consorts on
January 26, 1788. It presents an invaluable
point of view regarding the. female society
of Australia in its first years.
The MS. is bound in thick parchment-
covered boards, brown and discolored by age,
and on the first page is inscribed in large
hand:—
A JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE
FROM PORTSMOUTH
TO
NEW SOUTH WALES AND CHINA
IN
THE LADY PENRHYN, MERCHANTMAN-
WILLIAM CROPTON SEVER, COMMANDER,
BY
ARTHUR BOWES SMYTH, SURGEON.
1787—1788—1789.
The author’s name has originally been writ-
ten “Arthur Bowes, S.” (for surgeon), but
the 8' has been turned, apparently in the
same hand and long afterwards, into
“Smyth,” with the word “Surgeon” added.
The Lady Penrhyn did not carry all the
women convicts who were in the fleet, but
she had the greater part of them and no
others. Dr. Bowes gives a complete list of
the 109 unfortunate ladies and the eight
children who sailed from Portsmouth under
his charge on May 13, 1787, with their ages,
previous occupations and terms of transpor-
tation. Four of them had life sentences,
four terms of 14 years, and all the remainder
—for a variety of misdemeanors that would
mostly nowadays, in first offenders, at any
rate, be met with a fine—were sent oversea
for seven years. Their ages ranged between
the 13-year-old Elizabeth Howard, clog-maker,
and the septuagenarian Elizabeth Bickford,
a domestic servant, who was suffering a
similar term for shoplifting. There were 21
who were of 20 years and under, and the
remainder were of an average age of about 30.
And here is the doctor’s opinion of the
gentle ladies whom he had been appointed
to squire to the other side of the world. “I
believe,” he wrote towards the end of ’B7,
when the voyage was about three-parts com-
pleted, “I may venture to say there was
never a more abandoned set of wretches col-
lected in one place at any period than are
now to be met with in this ship in particular,
& I am credibly informed the comparison
holds wt. respect to all the Convicts in the
fleet. The greater part of them are so totally
abandoned and callous’d to all sense of shame
& even common decency that it frequently
becomes indispensably necessary to inflict
Corporal punishment upon them, and sorry
I am to say that even this rigid mode of pro-
ceeding has not the desired Effect, since
every day furnishes proofs of their being
more harden’d in their Wickedness.”
Of the methods of punishment he fur-
nishes details in a footnote. “Upon any very
extraordinary occasion, such as theiving or
fighting with each other, or making use of
abusive language to the Officers, they have
thumb screws put on, or iron fetters on their
wrists, and sometimes their hair has been cut
off and their head shaved, which they seemed
to dislike more than any other punishment
they underwent. At first 1 or 2 were flog’d
with a Cat of 9 tails on the naked breech,
but as there are certain seasons when such
a mode of punishment cd not be inflicted
with that attention to decency wh. every-
one whose province it was to punish them
wished to adhere to, it was totally laid aside.
They were also, whilst under punishment, so
very abusive that there was a necessity for
gaging them.”
Bitterly he goes on:—
Nor do I conceive it possible in their present situ-
ation to adopt any plan to induce them to behave
like rational or even human beings—perpetually
theiving the eloaths from each other, nay almost
from their backs, may be rank’d amongst the least
of their crimes (tho’ it is the Crime for which most
of them are in f their present disgraceful situation).
The oaths and imprecations they daily make use of
in their common conversations & little disputes with
each other by far exceeds anything of the kind
to be met wt. amongst the most profligate wretches
in London. Nor can their matchless Hippocracy be
equal’d except by their base Ingratitude, many of
them plundering the Sailors (who have at every Port
they arrived at spent almost the whole of the wages
due to them in purchasing different articles of
wearing apparel & other things for their accommo-
dation) of their necessary eloaths & cutting them up
for some purpose of their own.
On February 6, 1788, the doctor records with
joy the handing over of his charges, and
gives an account of the extraordinary night
which marked the first landing of white
women in Australia. It is necessarily
abridged here.
At 5 o’clock this morning all things were got
in order for landing the whole of the women &
3 of the Ship’s longboats came alongside us to
receive them. Previous to their quitting the ship a
strict search was made to try if any of the many
things wh. they had stolen on Iboard cd.i be
found, but their artifice eluded the most strict
search © at 6 o’clock p.m. we had the long wish’d
for pleasure of seeing the last of them leave the
ship. They were dress’d in general very clean &
some few amongst them might be said to be well
dress’d. The Men Convicts got to them very soon
after they landed, & it is beyond my abilities to
give a just description of the Scene of Debauchery
and Riot that ensued during the night.... The
Sailors in our Ship requested to have some Grog to
make mtfrry with upon the Women quitting the
Ship : indeed the Capn. himself had no small reason
to rejoice upon their being all safely landed & given
into the cai*e of the Governor, as he was under the
penalty of 40£ for every Convict that was missing
for wh. reason he cotnplyed with the Sailors request.
It was a wild night amongst the giimtreesand
scrub of the little valley behind Sydney Cove
—an orgy of the elements even fiercer than
that of the passions. “They had not been
landed more than an hour, before they had ai
got their tents pitched or anything in order
to receive them, but there came on the most
violent storm of thunder, lighten’g and rain
I ever saw. The lighten’g was incessant dur-
ing the whole night, & I never heard it rain
Thus did the refinements of femininity first
find footing in Sydney.

Dead Sea Fruit
When “M.G.S.” (R.P. 25/9/’24) laments
the mass of overseas rubbish and near-rub-
bish of the natural-history order that finds
its way into Australian school publications,
he is deploring the. obvious, but something
that cannot be too fervently deplored. When
he indulges in “consternation” because ‘‘the
anticipated delights of country life are Dead
Sea fruit,” he merely chatters. How much
“schooling” in natural'history came the way
of old Gilbert White? What mattered
the moralising of tutors alongside the secret
things which young Hudson learned when
wandering about those enticing pampas of
South America? No —no; much as “Edu-
cation” departments are to be blamed (and
none more than the hidebound institution of
N. S. Wales) for their clumsy laziness in
attempting to fill immature Australian heads
with utterly foreign matter, it is the indi-
vidual’s own job—-own peculiar pleasure, in-
deed—to wait upon the whims of birds, the
flowers and the other birthrights that are
more unalterably Australian than is Black
Brother himself.
Of course, in acclaiming self-teaching no
naturalist denies the value of guides. You
may get these for a few shillings in pretty
well any branch of Australian nature-study.
Such text-books, however, begin and end as
guides. The invitation to Nature-play
comes from the gossip books, those which
hold, as it were, a mirror up to Nature in
relation to human msthetics and economics,
and which, accordingly, should have an
honored place in their country’s literature.
But have they? Let anyone interested look
into this point and he or she will find where
Dead Sea fruit really encumbers Australian
natural history. At once the most prolific
and most widely reputed of our Hudsouian
book-writers was an Englishman, “Beach-
comber” Banfield, who passed out last year.
During his 25 years of tropic isolation on
little Dunk Island, Banfield wrote three
books, uneven in quality, but charged with a
personality as strong as that of Stevenson,
and offering throughout impressions and
phrases with something of the glow of the
coral gardens by which they grew. Yet these
books brought their author scant financial
reward. Why? Had he depended on Aus-
tralian sales—they were published in Eng-
land —the Beachcomber would have been
badly smitten. Meanwhile, over in Uncle
Sam’s humdrum woods, old John Burroughs
was drawing £3OO or £4OO a year from
natural-history works, similarly philosophi-
cal but rather less picturesque. The simple
fact is that one average Yank has more
material patriotism in aesthetics of this
peculiarly local kind than one dozen average
Australians possess.
If it is objected that Banfield’s stuff had
too remote a setting for a thoroughly Aus-
tralian appeal, I give you cases closer home
—those of Donald Macdonald, Charles Bar-
rett, Alec Chisholm and L. G. Chandler.
Macdonald’s “Gum Boughs and Wattle
Bloom” is probably out of print. But he
has turned out dozens of essays since in Mel-
bourne Argus, sound, sane, informative,
sparkling natural history, with as much
human pull as either Burroughs or Hudson;
and all this remains buried because Australia
casually declines to make publication worth
while. There is less strength in Barrett’s
work; his “In Australian Wilds” is a big
improvement on Le Souef’s mildly shocking
“Wild Life in Australia,” but it is a dawd-
ling, if restful, description of outings rather
than a filtering of impressions through a
clear mind. Similarly with Chandler. Chis-
holm is more analytical, a younger Mac-
donald ; both are bush products and both
have inherited just sufficient of the Celt to
temper mere observing faculties and cause
them to look behind the veil—for poetry if it
is there, but for meanings, anyhow. That,
presumably, is why Chisholm’s “Mateship
with Birds” was hailed in England last year
as marking the advent of an Australian
John Burroughs, and why The Bulletin
applauded him as a man who can view birds
with a scientifically observant eye and write
of them with the lyricism of a poet. All
three (Macdonald, Chisholm, Barrett) are
journalists who should know how to get their
wares on the market; yet I dare swear that
not one of them has made a month’s wages
out of his book. Writing up to the same
standard abroad, their natural-history work
would pretty well free them from the grind
of daily journalism.
Here we get back to the original plaint
against the school authorities. My point
is that, while they cannot be held respon-
sible for instilling a love of either Nature
or poetry in each youngster, they certainly
can give the young idea an invitation to
“vistas of solemn beauty.” In England a
pleasant edition of Hudson’s “Birds in a Vil-
lage” makes a happy school-reader. In
U.S.A. Burroughs and Torrey and Beebe and
even Gene Stratton Porter have a place in
pretty well every school or ’varsity. The
most we do with Young Australia in this
aspect is to impose text-books that make
nature “study” a fag, with, perhaps, a
sprinkling of fairy tales that cause sophisti-
cated young noses to wrinkle.
But the alleged educationists, it seems
to me, sin less against the light than do
sundry critics. A. W. Jose, in the latest
edition of his Australian history, neglects the
vital Macdonald and sundry others, and ob-

42 horsepower! 50 miles and more an
hour—hour alter hour—without over-
heating—without loss of power—without
engine repair—without carbon cleaning!
Many authorities believe this to be the outstand-
ing motor car to-day.
Judge for yourself whether you want these unusual
merits, not possessed by any poppet-valve car.
It is the most powerful car ever built of equal
motor displacement and car weight.
It has a longer engine life—with greater power
and greater economy than poppet-valve engines
can have.
It is geared —not to a spurt speed of 70 miles an
hour —but to average 50 miles and more per hour,
hour after hour, for as long as you want to ride
that way.
And at the end of a long sustained high speed
your motor will be cooler, will need less water
than any similar-sized poppet-valve engine; will
need no repair, no tinkering with weakened
springs and unseated valves.
In fact its power curve will still be climbing
up while the power of a poppet-valve car is
dropping off.
And that is at the beginning. At 15,000 miles,
this car will be more powerful, smoother, more
even, if that is possible, than when new. No
poppet-valve car at any price can offer this tre-
mendous advantage.
Furthermore, while its power is increasing, its
operating cost is cut in two, for this car is entirely
free from those engine repairs which make up 50
per cent, of the upkeep cost of practically all
poppet-valve cars. It has no cams —no springs—
to get out of order.
This lack of motor depreciation partly explains
the unusually high resale value of the Willys-
Knight. Owners often ask to have their old motors
retained in new cars. And 50,000 miles without
any engine repairs is an ordinary experience
among Willys-Knight owners.
You steer it without conscious effort. Women fre-
quently tell us it is the easiest car they ever steered.
No car is more lavishly equipped with Timken
steering bearings.
Its getaway is quick and sure. You are never
embarrassed in traffic.
You can never appreciate the great superiority of
the Willys-Knight until you yourself drive it.
And you can never know the full meaning of
motor-car economy until you have owned a
Willys-Knight for a few years.

DAVID JONES’
FOR SERVICE—OPP. G.P.O. SYDNEY
serves as an afterthought that Banfield a
remarkable “Confessions of a Beachcomber
is in a class by itself —-which, of course, is
trivial scamping. And Nettie Palmer, in
her “Modern Australian Literature, goes
several degrees worse by no refer-
ence whatever to our nature-writers gener-
ally, and by complaining that Banfield "re-
ported facts rather than created a world
through his individual vision.” _ Assuming
this to be true —which it isn’t —if Nettie
Palmer regards the garnering of Nature facts
as being as bald a process as garnering in
libraries, let her attempt a little Ruth-like
exercise in the field. This done, and the
freshness of the observations tested, let her
essay to set forth her facts so that their
beauty be not lost or glossed. After which,
I suspect, she will be vaguely astonished to
know how elusive nature news is to the
unsympathetic; in brief, what a material
part is played by individual vision in even
the “reporting” of testlietic facts. And
after that again, maybe, she will repent for
slurring the men who relate the secret stories
told by their own country, and acclaiming
D. H. Lawrence’s warped, Marcus Clarkian
“pictures of our landscape” as something in
the nature of a boon.
Withal, a philosophic nature-writer may
find a sweet kernel in this Dead Sea fruit
offered by the country that he of all men
knows best in its original essence. His sub-
ject is, in the nature of things, everlasting
—ever old, ever new. “The fashion of the
garments of heaven and earth enduretli for
ever,” observed Leigh Hunt. And this is
near enough to truth to point the fact that
the book of a naturalist, so long as it contain
something of the song of the bird, rathe ; r
than a mere description of that melody, is
no more born for death than the bird itself.
ORIGMA.
Virgil and His Betters
Historical tradition ,is full of things too
good to be true, but too good not to be be*
lieved, and it is impossible to remove them
from common credence. It is almost the
same case with many matters of general
opinion in the literary tradition, with repu-
tations consolidated by age-long prescrip-
tion ; how shall one hope, how shall one dare
the attempt, to show what an accretion of
misunderstanding goes to their making?
When one thinks of all that Virgil meant
to Dante, of all that he yet means to Dr.
Mackail, does it not seem sacrilegious to
speak of his betters? Nevertheless, he has
his betters in his own tongue as well as
among the Greeks; and the frequent beauty
and continual elaborateness of his poetry
must not conceal from us the fact that it
is throughout essentially a hybrid. When,
after a few' interesting attempts in other
metres, Virgil decided to specialise in the
hexameter, he began with the “Sicilian
Muses” —that is, with the “Idyllia” of Theo-
critus. Of these there had just recently
appeared the first separate edition with a
commentary, this latter very necessary in-
deed to every reader, and especially to Virgil,
who, even so, more than once contrives to
blunder most grotesquely. If he could thus
stumble in detail, are w r e to expect that he
could get the spirit of Theocritus? He sub-
stitutes something else, the false bucolic;
and the result is a collection of disparates
and incompatibles wherein, of the two best-
known pieces, one has been taken for a
prophecy of the Messiah, and the other brings
in a train of mythological and “pastoral”
personages to console a Roman officer, of
literary bent, -whose lady friend of the ballet
has deserted him for another military gentle-
man. Dr. Mackail, who concedes the weak-
ness of the “Eclogues,” finds in this one an
“unearthly day, nature seen through a
medium of strange gold.” If we could all
agree with him, even then what of the ludi-
crous disparity between the real theme and
the phantasmagoria?
Possibly all would consent to agree that,
as a poet, and a very fine one too, Virgil is
mostly satisfying in the “Georgies.” But
there rises the question as to the kind of
poem, as to its immediate model, and Vir-
gil’s standing towards one of his betters.
The didactic poem we must accept as an
historical fact, and we are always free to
pick out the plums of poetry and let the
hard dough alone—even with Lucretius: But
Lucretius can carry us with him even through
his most arid technicalities, because it was
only his own fervor and his passion for rid-
ding his fellow-men of superstition that com-
manded him to write; Virgil is commissioned
by the minister. Subject for subject, too, a
vision of the boundless universe of infinite
worlds “going on” throughout space is pre-
ferable to a standard treatise on agriculture
deftly turned into verse; we politely leave the
instructions on making a plough to those
scholars w-ho cultivate what the Germans
call Privataltertiimer. And when it comes
to a comparison of the show-passages of both
poets, can Virgil’s brief patches of beauty
compare with the sustained sublimity of
Lucretius as shown, say, in the preaching of
“eternal death” at the end of the third book,
or the amazing account of primitive man in
the fifth book? No—Mrs. Browning and
Lionel Johnson have both said •it once for
all; Lucretius -ftas “chief poet by the Tiber-
side,” “mightiest-minded of the Roman race.”
A certain shortness of breath is perceptible
in Virgil’s most splendid passages, and what
we know of his habits of work would make
us expect him to be successful on the small
scale, like those Alexandrians w'ho were his
masters. Unfortunately his commissions
were first for the didactic poem and next for
the epic, and that epic was to express a
national-dynastic tendency. With wonder-
ful ingenuity and a persistence of labor
which must have told heavily on his deli-
cate frame, he combined his disparate ele-
ments—a love-maddened queen, after Apollo-
nius ; a visit to the other world with inlay
of metempsychosis, after Ennius; and so on
—into a whole which some Polonius might
describe as “archaic-romantic-symbolic-poli-
tical.” The point that is to be dealt with
here is that the “grand style” in Virgil is
almost everywhere accompanied with a sense
of strain, both of lung and muscle. He is
curiously like William Ernest Henley in
this, that both, with an inborn tendency to-
wards delicacy and refinement—though
Virgil, of course, had the gift of majesty,
and Henley was not acting under compul-
sion—burden the page till it creaks anti
groans with word and phrase beyond their
power to manage, and pile the mass till it
topples over.
The revelation of Homeric poetry as it
truly is meant the ejection of Virgil ft -o * ll
a usurped chair of honor. Nor is lie likely
to recover it; not even if —and that is a most
unlikely thing—the anti-romantic monarch-
ists reaction in France were to get into
power, and put back the system of education
where it was two centuries ago.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
A Chateau in Belgium
On a clear day late in 1909 a foreigner
from overseas arrived at a small station on
one of the railway lines which run from
Belgium into Holland. A few. yards beyond
began the approach to a bridge over the
mighty Meuse. There, in an angle of the
wall, Monsieur X. sat all day at the receipt
of custom —three centimes (then worth about
a farthing) for each foot-passenger, and two
for each wheel of every vehicle, from the dog-
drawn cart to the gentleman’s carriage. This
was a good thing for the Hotel Tournebride,
for if you sat till nightfall drinking beer
under the clipped elms outside the cafe you
could slip across the river without paying
toll.
The view from the bridge was superb.
Northward the great mass of water hurried
towards Holland and the sea, and the many
colored houses were reflected in a sheltered
reach of the stream. Further yet rose the
Pietersberg—a range of hills honeycombed
with sandstone workings whose recesses
have from time immemorial given shelter
to refugees fleeing before fire and sword.
Towards Libge the river is divided by an
island where poplar trees gleamed golden in
the light of that autumn day. To the right
a village lay in the wide, flat valley, and
to the left, beyond the Tournebride, the pic-
turesque Roclier d’Argenteau rose abruptly
against the sky. Thereafter, when the
grounds were open to the public, we fre-
quently visited the ruins which crowned its
summit. These huge pieces of masonry were
still attached to the cliff as firmly as limpets
to the rock. In Spring wallflowers blazed
from every crevice, and in summer the re-
mains of the mediaeval castle were crimson
with valerian. Upon the hill behind these
were formal gardens and a comparatively
new chateau, and, hidden amongst the woods,
a chapel where names of several counts and
countesses of Mercy-Argenteau were carven
in stone beneath their arms.
The same armorial bearings were also
to be seen in the Gothic church down the
river—wrecked in the jurie Allemandc of
1914 —upon the memorial to Count Flori-
mond of the same ilk, who died as Aus-
tin an Ambassador in London in 1794. The
property had, however, passed into other
hands. And though this event was recent,
the last Countess of the old name had already
become the centre of a cycle of legend.
From the mist of Romance which veiled
her personality and history the village people
had evoked a fantastic figure—that of a
liontamcr! In sober fact, she seems to
have turned her back upon the Old World
and its gossips, for the archives of her
family rest, not in Argenteau or Brussels,
but in the National Library at Washington.
Two manuscripts she retained, both writ-
ten by her grandfather in the “new”
chateau above the Meuse. Both have been
published in a limited edition by Mr. George
S. Kellmann, who writes long and careful
prefaces to the tw T o volumes.
History has a way of repeating itself. In
the seventeenth century the De Mercy-Argen-
teau of the time lost his estates, and the
Marquis de Lauenne reigned in his stead.
A branch of the old family then passed into
Austria, and its descendants eventually again
became rich and powerful. The most cele-
brated amongst them was the Count Flori-
mond who, before he went to England to die,
was guardian of the unlucky Queen Marie-
Antoinette, and followed her to France.
Through his influence a marriage was
arranged between his nephew and the
heiress to the Mercy-Argenteau lands, so
that they reverted again to one who bore the
ancient name. History may perhaps repeat
itself in the future.
Count Francois - Joseph - Charles - Maria,
author of these memoirs (Memoirs of the
Count de Mercy-Argenteau •, Putnam’s Sons),
was born at Argenteau (in 1780), married a
Princesse de Paar, and seems to have had
no other ambition than to live with his wifi
and children amongst the charming woods
and hills above the “silver water.” However,
upon the invitation of Talleyrand, he became
Chamberlain of the French Imperial Court,
and he gives us, in the first volume of his
reminiscences, pictures of the vie intime of
Napoleon and Josephine at Malmaison, and
of their doings and amusements. He touches
also upon the divorce, the Emperor’s second
marriage, and the execution of the Due
d’Enghien. Napoleon seems to have been a kind
and considerate master, and to have had sin-
cere affection for the young De Mercy-Argen-
teau. The latter did not, however, follow
him into exile at Elba, any more than the
Count Florimond followed Marie-Antoinette
to the guillotine. The second volume deals
with a later period. Lifege was no longer a
Department of France, and Belgium had been
united with Holland under William 1., King
of the Netherlands. To those who are in-
terested in the history of modern Europe,
the story told by the Count is of very great
interest, and it throws light upon the obscure
reasons which induced the Belgians to revolt
against the Dual Monarchy in 1830. Wil-
liam I. was undoubtedly conscientious, and
did his best for the people of the Belgian
provinces. He. with an Englishman, John
Coekerill, founded the ironworks of Seraing.
and, incidentally, the prosperity of a country
which, so ridiculously small in area, is never-
theless one of the great manufacturing centres
of the world. But he was harsh, without
personal charm, pigheaded, and his rigid Pro-
testantism did not sympathise with the sen-
timents of his Roman Catholic sublets—
Count de Mercy-Argenteau was Grand Cham-
berlain to the king, and Governor of Bra-
bant, and he records many conversations with
his royal master. Finally, the Revolution
of 1830 was achieved with comparatively
little bloodshed, and in 3831 Leonold of Snxe-
Coburg. widower of the English Princess
Charlotte, ascended the throne of the new
kingdom of Belgium, by invitation of the
National Congress. The reasons which in-
dneed the Powers to peacefully ratify the
change, and guarantee the neutrality of Bel-
gium, are fully discussed by the editor.
Since then Belgium, that tiny country whose
population is greater than that of the .conti-
nent of Australia, continued to develop her
industry, her agriculture, her commerce, her
arts and sciences, until the storm of war
burst upon her in 1914. Whether, had she
still remained united with Holland, doubled
in population and area, Germany would have
pursued the same policy, is, of course, an un-
answerable question.
In 1919 the little town down upon the
the river was as a city of the dead, and for
us who had known it in happier days ghosts
walked the silent streets. Upon the walls
of the roofless, blackened church which held
the monument of Count Florimond grass and
weeds were growing as thickly as upon the
Rock; and the ruins of the medimval castle
of De Mercy-Argenteau looked down upon
the ruins of the nineteenth-century bridge
where Monsieur X. sat no more at the receipt
of custom. Yet Belgium is rising like a
phoenix from the ashes.

A Satchel of Books
Under the Lee, by Martin Gale (Brown and Son,
Glasgow). Sketches, based on truth, which will be of
interest to many besides sailormen. An unexpected
reference to “going on the wallaby” appears in the
latter part of the book. A sea-drenched oid boats-
wain thought he would like a spell on land for the
good of his health. He deserted his ship at Bris-
bane and legged it up country, where he got a job
on a sugar pi ntation. He doesn’t seem to have
liked legging it; at any rate he decided “the nex’
time we knocked off goin’ to sea, we’d go in a
steamboat.”
Decisions of the Speakers of Queensland, by Charles
Arrowsmith Bernays, Clerk of Parliament in Queens-
land. In his own State Mr. Bernays is a Parliamen-
tary instituticn. His father was its first Clerk of
Parliament, and the present boss official fought
every inch of his way to the job. His book covers
rulings from 1860 to 1923, and the work of end-
less research, endless checking of references and
close editing and condensation is a monument to
the compiler’s thoroughness and patience. This, by
the way, is his second book. His first was “Sixty
Years of Queensland Politics.”
A Synopsis of the Vertebrate Animals of Tas-
mania, by Clive E. Lord, Director of the Tasmanian
Museum, and 11. H. Scott, Curator of the Launceston
Musuem (Oldham, Beddome and Meredith). An
admirable result of a painstaking effort to list, with
scientific and gen ral notes and diagrams, the verte-
brates of the southern island. Though, as the authors
confess, there are shortcomings—due solely to the
difficulties under which the work was done —the
volume will prove of immense value to students
of natural history and will be particularly welcomed
by those who have long regretted the absence of a
comprehensive tabulation of a most interesting section
of Australasian fauna.
The Animals of New Zealand, by Capt. F. W.
Hutton, F.R.S., and James Drummond, F.Z.S. (Whit-
combe and Tombs). A fourth edition of this fine
work, first published in 1904 and since recognised
as the standard authority. Hutton died in 1905, and
the subsequent editions have been brought out by
his collaborator, who has gone on making it more
and more comprehensive. New features in this
volume deal with a new frog, the Maori dog, the
Maori rat and introduced bir Is, and there is a new
name-list of birds. Incidentally, it is good to have
Mr. Drummond’s assurance that “there is no con-
vincing evidence that any Maoriland bird, except
the Stephens Island wren and the native quail, has
been exterminated by European inhabitants.... The
position is not nearly as bad as we thought it was.
... .As long as large tracts of forests are left as sanc-
tuaries and scenic reserves,, we need not have much
fear that our avifauna will be completely lost.”
Australian Musical Possibilities, by Henry Tate
(E. A. Vidler). A reprint of articles contributed
from time to time to Australian newspapers and
magazines, with an introduction by Bernard O’Dowd.
If, says the author, Australia is to come into line
as one of the countries whose national characterictics
have inspired great music, she must have composers
who will study their own country “and aim to
achieve in their music an inherent distinction which
will arouse interest in it as Australian music.” In
seeking distinctiveness and native peculiarities on
which to build a national music, the composer must,
he says, “give attention to the essential matter of
striking and characteristic rhythm.” The bird-calls
of our bush supply an unfailing source of varied and
charming rhythms, and these so definite and clear
that they may easily be used for the basis of fan-
tastic dances. He instances the notes of the butcher-
bird, the mopoke, the grey thrush and the golden-
breasted whistler. The variety of magpie calls is
quite remarkable. And not only the denizens of
the bush, but the bush itself, its trees and gullies,
played on by “the bow of the wind,” awakens “long-
sustained melodies of lingering charm.” He ques-
tions whether, so far, Australian composers as a
whole have given any distinctive local color to
their works. But how shall we deal with the subtle
perfumes, how with the infinite colors, the veils of
hazy grey and the liquid sunlight; how translate
into terms of music all the mystical beauty of the
bush? “There is no reply. For the present scent
and color orchestras must remain where they are,
dimly discernible as possibilities in the half-recorded
visions of the lost and irreplaceable genius of old
Russia —Scriabin.”
Rational Mysticism, by William Kingsland (Allen
and Unwin). This is the third volume of a series,
the preceding two having dealt with “Scientific
Idealism” and “Our Infinite Life.” There are two
outstanding features in the trend of modern thought,
one being the demand for a greater rationality in
all matters pertaining to religious belief and experi-
ence, the other the widespread interest in the deeper
phenomena of life and consciousness to which the
term occult or mystical is given. There is, he
contends, no reason why a concept or theory of
genuine mysticism should not be formulated which
is quite as “rational” or “scientific” as many of
the concepts or theories of modern psychology.
“Mysticism” as he defines it is not associated with
ultra-religious emotionalism, having no special or
acknowledged ground in science or philosophy, but
has little to distinguish it from religion when under-
stood in its truest and deepest sense as the re-union
of the soul with its source. A rational mysticism
may find a basis, though only a preliminary one,
in a rational psychology. Divorced from such a
basis, treated as something separate and apart from
the sum of human knowledge and evolution, it may
degenerate into mere superstition. To lift it on to
this plane is the purpose of the book. The ques-
tion is dealt with exhaustively, the substance of
the matter being that “whatever wet may appear to
be in outward relation and proportion to other
individual lives, or to other things, in this great
universe, which is the manifestation of the infinite
one, we and they and all things are life of the one
life, and substance of the one substance.”

“C.McL.”: I was horrified on my return to .Sydney
to discover that my little essay upon Torquemada
had been offensive to my many friends of the R.C.
faith. Needless to say, I looked at the Inquisition
purely from the point of view of science; and 1
still think that for a modern man to defend it
would need far more courage than humanity. At
the present time, when sectarian intolerance appears
once again to be lifting its ugly head, it seems to
be the duty of every good citizen to say nothing
that may raise fury, so I ask to be excused from
replying to critics, however they may rage against me.

The Dandy r Greys’
In 1835, English social history re-
cords what was known as the' 1 Dandy
Period” Certainly the uniform of
the "GREYS” reflected the spirit of
the day. Smart but hardly practical
or soldierly those tight trousers and
handsome bearskins with the white
plume rising from behind and
curving over the top. Small wonder
that the ladies of the day were
attracted !
THERE'S more attrac-
tion in a cigarette made
from choice Virginia
tobacco than just smoking it,
“GREYS” Cigarettes, made
from the choicest Virginia, are
attractive because wholesome, kind
to the throat and the ladies like that
delicious perfume, only “GREYS”
diffuse.

Fruit-flowers.
Out of what paradise, what poet’s dream,
Rich with rare perfumes, came these pale
fruit-flowers—
Long, slender boughs of bloom that almost
seem
To know what sweets they hold for coming
hours?
White cherry blossom! Oh, what children’s
lips
Stained with the blood of these shall taste
delight
In Christmas galleries where joyance sips
And cracker-revels star God’s birthday
night!
Pale apple bloom! What girls unwedded
now
Shall crush you like Love’s kisses merrily
At bridal feasts white as your topmost bough
In the gay honeymoons that ar<s to be!
And you, O pearl-pink peach-flowers glowing
bright
As young boys’ faces, what marauding
hands
Shall snatch you in the laughter of the
night!
What strong ships carry you to distant
lands!
Plum bloom, quince flower, sweet apple petals,
fall!
No garden knows so rich a blossom
shower!
Let others answer to the lily tall,
Violet, rose. Name me a pale fruit-
flower !

Out of a Window.
I thrill for simple scenes enframed
Like pictures in my window-pane;
A sudden rapture makes me turn
And draw the blind and look again.
I see the dull red brick made bright
Against the parting sun’s warm cheek.
The old-man chimney-stacks with smiles
Look over ridge and gable peak.
Rain, when it softly soothes the glass,
Is like a cool, caressing hand —
Sad beauty, full of gentleness,
That sighs and seems to Understand.
I crave the riches of the world
And find full wealth in things that are.
A glance between the red brick walls
Shows black-bouglied elms that hold a star.
VICTORIA.
JARKGOC.
Conquest Song.
All night through Nazareth
The sound of far guns brawling
Rode on the wind’s sweet breath.
While tireless hoofs were falling.
The limber wdieels turned slowly
As we moved grimly forth
By houses dark and lowly,
By portals calm and holy,
To rouse the sullen north.
High walls rose mai-ble-white,
The viewless dark defying.
Their beams of window light
Our endless columns spying.
The roadways rang in chorus
Beneath our rhythmic tread,
The burning stars watched o’er us,
While martial spirits bore us
To win the miles ahead.
A distant chapel bell
Sent solemn praises pealing
Along the road that fell,
Through cypress alleys stealing.
The oleander tresses
Above our shoulders twined,
And all the dire distresses
Of fiery wildernesses
We gladly left behind.
We left the crowded height,
And down a haunted valley,
Where in the dead of night
The mustered breezes sally,
Hoofs fell on stretches gravelled,
When low above the slope
A lifting moon unravelled
The winding course we travelled,
Borne on the wings of hope.
Pomegranates flamed when morn
Strange glory woke to show us;
Wide stubble fields of corn
spread cloth of gold below us.
Dark hours that once appalled us
Were lost for melody;
xhe joyous lark enthralled us
With matin somrs that called us
To drink at Galilee.

GERARDY.
Seascape.
Jade gown above the rocks, rent here and
there
With the foam-white of limb and bosom
bare!
Brown tresses of foreshore that meet the
loam
Beyond the jewel of a red-roofed home
That lies like sard against the emerald land!
Buckled with rock and slender chains of
sand,
She rests at noon, this empress of the deep;
And yet ye shall not trust her seeming sleep,
For suddenly in pique she ™ay arse,
Discard her green robe, hiding from the
skies
Beneath a sombre gown of stormy hue.
Vowing she wearies of unbraided blue.
She covers with her cloak each razored rock
To trap doomed men —to trim to-morrow’s
smock!
For whim may make this seem to be
The fairer froeking for the sea!

SELF-DETERMINATION.
The difficulty over the Irish boundary raises
once more the question as to how far it is
possible to apply the principle of self-deter-
mination. The word has a democratic sound;
and the general idea that people should have
the right to decide their nationality as well
as their mode of government is attractive.
But in practice the matter is not quite what
it seems. When nationalism moves about
and tangles itself up with other nationalism,
the complexities become such that it is
often impossible to comb them out. A num-
ber of Australians might take up their resi-
dence in New Caledonia, and in the course
of a century so increase in number that
they formed one-fourth of the population.
If they were all in one spot and occupied a
continuous strip of country into which no
French settlers had intruded, what should
we say to their demand for self-determina-
tion in the matter of government? In Ire-
land . the tangles are peculiarly knotty, be-
cause the differences between Irishmen and
Ulstermen are not always racial. They
are often 'mere matters of opinion, senti-
ment and prejudice. The division cannot
bo made on tiie lines of Celt and Saxon;
for Normans, Englishmen and Scotchmen
have all proved Irish of the Irish upon Irish
soil. It is impossible to make the boundaries
correspond to those of religion; for many
of the most sacred names in the mouths of
patriotic Irish Catholics are those of Pro-
testant leaders, and many thousands of
Ulster Protestants have always heartily sup-
ported the Irish cause. To apply the prin-
ciple of self-determination to such a com-
munity as that of the present Ulster must
be to create a political map of spots and
pockmarks. Little districts wholly sur-
rounded by the fiercest upholders of Wil-
liam of Orange would vote solidly for in-
clusion in the Free State; and if their re-
adiest were granted the only way in which
the Government of that country could safely
reach them would be by aeroplane. Yet
while self-determination of a sort has been
allowed to a district as small as that ruled
from Belfast, it is difficult to see why it
should be denied to a county or even to a
populous parish.
*■ * * *
The whole question resolves itself into a
matter of area. Plow large must an area
be before it is allowed a free decision as
to its nationality? Without some definition
the argument is interminable. The south
part of the county of Down elected De
Valera to the Ulster' Parliament. Plainly
such a district should be in Ireland, not in
Ulster, as at present. But in that district
there is a large Ulster minority, which in
part of the area forms a majority; and in
that part of the area, there is a strong Irish
minority which forms the majority in part
of part of the area. So, without definition
as to the size of the place which should have
such political rights, the game goes on until
tlit- subdivision of nationality becomes utterly
ridiculous. The last pocket of three houses,
tested by the vote, might show two for Ulster
and one for Ireland; and, the right of the
minority being properly safeguarded, a
lonely quarter-acre of Ireland might be found
in a valley roaring with loyalty to the Battle
of the Boyne and other antique misfortunes.
Moreover, the quarter-acre might be sold to
an Ulsterman, who would either have to pay
taxes to the hated Free State or demand a
new referendum to test his own opinion
about the matter. Further, the rights of
those living under the Free State _ should
reasonably be considered. There might be
somebody living in Kerry who would like to
live under the rule of Belfast, and lie should
be given the opportunity of saying so:
though, of course, the difficulty might arise
of his demanding to be enrolled as a sub-
ject of the Shah of Persia. Should the
disease of self-determination in homoeopathic
doses become infectious and spread to Aus-
tralia, international complications might
arise with which our two or three miniature
warships and all the Boy Scouts would be
quite unable to cope. Ram Damit might
demand self-determination for the camel-pad,
and Ah Fu might make the same claim
for his cabbage-run. The ghetto at Darling-
hurst might vote for recognition as a part
of Palestine, and the picture showmen might
put up a solid ballot for declaring the Syd-
ney and Melbourne suburbs part of the
United States after 8 p.m. each day. There
would also be a fair chance for people of
anarchistic temper to form themselves in
small groups and declare that it was against
their conscience to live under any govern-
ment at all. In fact, as a general scheme
for disintegration and public irritation, no-
thing quite so brilliant as self-determination
in small doses has yet been suggested.
* * * *
During the Great War it was frequently
said that democracy was on its trial; but
since the guns ceased roaring the statement
has become far truer. It is in world-recon-
struction that popular forms of government
are tried and tested; and it is clear that a
broad basis of mutual trust and goodwill is
necessary to make democracy w r ork. The
intrusive armed settlements of the Middle
Ages and later, by throwing alien peoples
together in a sort of racial patchwork, played
into the hands of despotism. A homogeneous
State, speaking one language and ruled by
certain dominant ideas, was always the home
of a good deal of individual freedom. It
was among the broken fragments of peoples
that the tyrant got his hold. When Magyar,
Croat, Rutlienian, German, Roumanian,
Czech, Pole and Serb occupied alternate vil-
lages and valleys over a wide stretch of
country, one man with an iron fist could bat-
ter them all into subjection to his single
will; but a land like Britain, where racial
divisions had faded to a mere memory lack-
ing all bitterness, had always a kick which
made Parliaments possible and the divine
right of kings a dangerous thing to mention.
It is democracy’s interest to see that it does
not weaken its own rather shaky founda-
tions ; and self-determination may easily
prove a dangerous snare where political
catch-words outrun political discretion. The
Irish position is a curious one, owing to the
extent to which partisan feeling with a
psendo-rcligious basis has been played upon
by English politicians for purposes quite out-
side the sphere of the Irish trouble ; but what-
ever may be the motive behind the noisy
“We hold what we have” of the Ulster Pre-
mier, it is plain that a vote by parishes for
choice of Government is an expedient of very
doubtful value. An honest commission act-
ing on the results of past voting would ren-
der more real service, and save the estab-
lishment of a precedent that democracy has
a right to play pitcli-and-toss with its terri-
tory.
THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
It will not be a walkover for the Republi-
can candidate, President Coolidge.
New York, the pivotal State of the Union
to-day, as it was in the days of Alexander
Hamilton, nominated Smith as its Demo-
cratic candidate, and thereby declared war
on the infamous Ku Klux Klan expressly
and distinctly. And precisely for that rea-
son McAdoo had also to be nominated, in
order to save the K.K.K. from public pla-
carding. When the Convention met it was
thus confronted with civil and external Pre-
sidential war, and it took about a month
and 103 ballots before it could get away
home wet and draggled and out of the wood.
When the Democratic Convention met, the
band at once began to play. The
txvo sections agreed about the in-
famous pretences of the Ku Klux
gang as a factor in Western, _ Chris-
tian or any other form of civilisation, an-
cient. modern or Eastern. One section
thought that, like a certain' kind of sin, it
ought not to be so much as even mentioned
amongst the members. This section, after
a prolonged and bitter strife, just carried
its resolution by 546 to 541 votes, amidst
the most tremendous excitement that has
ever convulsed a Presidential Nomination
Convention. When a body of citizens has to
be placarded in Scriptural terms as being on
the same plane as a deadly sin, that body is
on an infinitely lower plane in whatever
Hades there is on this earth than Daniel
O'Connell’s Dublin Corporation.
The K.K. having thus been disposed of,
the battle raged for the rest of the month,
June-Jujy, round McAnoo and Smith.
McAdoo’s hands and garments were steeped
in very crude oil, and not all the perfumes
of the Convention could sweeten either.
Coolidge had rid himself of three Cabinet
Ministers probably not more but less tainted,
in popular opinion, than McAnoo. Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, the hero not of all
the lost but of all the damned causes in
the U. States, came to the rescue. Ilis sup-
port killed McAnoo; and then, when Smith’s
supporters had got not all, but nearly all,
they wanted, their man came out with a
straight declaration that if McAnoo would
throw up the sponge he (Smith) would get
outside the ropes without troubling about
the stakes. McAdoo still hedged ; and then
the Smith section played with the ballot-
boxes till it became clear that Davis, of
Virginia, could have a clear or even a two-
thirds majority. And that is how Davis
won.
Davis has a fine record. Though lie is
the leading lawyer in the U. States, and was
(mb rosa) endorsed by the judiciary of the
Supreme Court for a seat on that Bench,
yet he is a Corporation lawyer, and J. P.
Morgan’s Corporation at that. It is a heavy
handicap. Wilson, whose mind and tem-
perament were always professorial and more
or less petrified, had at first turned him
down. But when Davis subsequently cleared
up some Corporation scandals which led to
the retirement of one of the Judges, Wilson
made Davis Solicitor-General and sent him
to England during the war. After Harvey’s
meteoric or, rather, volcanic career as U.S.
Ambassador at London, it was Davis first
and the rest nowhere for the vacant post.
He took it and beggared himself in the ser-
vice of his country. He then joined a New
York legal firm in order to get quit of poli-
tics, and save himself from a dragged-out
existence as a public or, worse still, a pri-
vate pensioner. Circumstances —and pretty
hard ones too —have driven him to the lime-
light again. Probably, like Chase, his best
place is the Chief Justiceship of the IT.
States, or close by it. Whatever chance he
had, or has, for the Presidency is severely
handicapped by La Follette, the Progres-
sive party’s nomination.
The Democrats have put AYilson’s League
of Nations on the referendum shelves. The
Republicans have banned it. So Wil-
son’s masterpiece is less substantial now
so far as the U.S. is concerned than “a
dream within a dream.” The Americans
are guessing that in the present cir-
cumstances and for some time to come
the dollar is. and will be, mightier than
the sword. That way they are pretty shrewd
guessers.
In the art of manufacturing election mani-
festoes Australia has not much, if anything,
to learn from the U.S.. nor it from Aus-
tralia. But the World of Democracy is
getting so sick and full of this “thimble and
pea” business that electors are becoming
more concerned with wEat the politicians
and their parties swear they will not do than
with what they swear they will do. The
Republican manifesto in this light reads much
the better, cloud of words though it is. The
Republicans at great length promise to do —
nothing much. “They stand for the ‘stand
pat.’ ” The Democrats promise to do —every-
thing and a little bit over. They stand for
pulling out their seven-league boots and get-
ting into them quick and lively. The Pro-
gressives stand for doing anything that turns
up and taking it all on as a job lot at job
prices. Between the three, since even the
United States is plainly a bit weary of its
own spellbinding and spellbinders, the Re-
publicans under Coolidge stand a much
better show than the Democrats under
Davis, a far brainier, cooler and steadier
man. Davis may follow on in Taft’s foot-
steps, when the Ivu Klux is dead and out of
the way in the U.S. and the Democrats come
again. But that time is not ouite yet; so
Coolidge is the almost certain winner on
next November’s Presidential Cup Day.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Seething in the Service.
There is a conflict of opinion among those
who have studied the subject of occupa-
tional diseases as to which is the most
hazardous way of getting a living in Aus-
tralia. The dismal distinction has been
variously claimed for rock-chopping, house-
painting. scavenging, mining for lead, coal
and gold, and even for tram-driving; but in
the light of information now available it
will have to be awarded to the calling of a
Government employee in the Commonwealth
service. It has been reserved for the Federal
Health Department to reveal the truth about
this most dangerous of pursuits. The figures
it has collected, and published in a special
bulletin, are distressing in the extreme. Of
25,375 permanent officers employed in
1922-23, the latest year recorded, 16,029 (63
per cent.) drew sick pay. Eighty per cent,
of the female employees (3386 altogether)
averaged 16.6 days’ absence from their
duties. Of telephonists no less than S 4 p.c.
were incapacitated, and the average absence
was 17 days; in 1913 only 35 p.c. of the
telephone-girls claimed sick leave, but life
was not so jazzy then. Sixty p.c. of
the male officers, who numbered 21,989
at June 30, 1923, were likewise pros-
trated for an average of 12.9 days. In
all, 218,317 days were lost on account of
these distressing maladies, a list of which
is not given, and sick pay amounted to
£132.307, or 2.2 p.c. of the salary bill, which
totalled £5,967,053. In the absence of medi-
cal information it is hard to understand why
working for the. Commonwealth Government
should be so harrowingly unhealthy. The
employees who suffer to this cruel extent
comprise clerks, typists, taxgatherers, Cus-
toms and excise officials, laborers, letter-
sorters, postmen, electricians and tele-
graphists, as well as telephonists. Their
offices are fairly comfortable, their hours of
labor are below the average in private em-
ployment, and their duties are not particu-
larly onerous. They get 12 public holidays
per annum and three weeks’ “recreation
leave, besides “long” leave — i.e., six months
after 20 years’ service. Then there is a
basic wage for the single man, with child-
endowment for the married and a superannu-
ation scheme for all. A boy of 21 en-
gaged on the lowest grade of clerical work
starts at £216 p.a., and in five years works
up to £276 p.a., the maximum in his divi-
sion for a bachelor. If he marries and has
children he draws another ss. a week for
each child. Should he die untimely his de-
pendants are provided for out of the super-
annuation fund which Hughes ushered in
just before the 1922 election, explaining that
“this bill must be passed because the public
servants demand it,” and made retroactive
to 1920. In the event of his retiring on the
ground of ill-health he will receive a full
pension, provided he can show that he is
50 p.c. incapacitated. These concessions and
others are expected to cost the taxpayer
£74,000 this year, £99,000 next year, £129,00(1
in 1926-27, £216,000 in 1929-30 and £307,000
in 1934-35 —the estimates have increased
since the scheme was introduced, and further
increases are likely as the service grows and
election-time comes round. Then there are
“higher-duties allowances” for those who
take the places of officers who happen to be
away. Concerning which the Public Service
Board remarks: —
More than £30,000 p.a. is expended on these
allowances. The following case may be cited, and it
might be multiplied one-hundred fold. Officer Ais
required to leave his State on official business for,
say, a week. Officer B temporarily fills his chair,
and in turn his position is occupied by C, who is
relieved by D, and D is relieved by E. Claims are
made by B, C, D and E for higher-duties allowances,
which are paid. It is virtually a game of musical
chairs.
And for officer A there is the perquisite
known as “payment for travelling time.” If
he chances to be aboard a train beyond his:
ordinary official hours he gets overtime pay
at the rate of his regular salary, plus that
salary, a first-class sleeping-berth each way
and an allowance which enables him to pocket
something after paying for his meals and
tipping attendants whom it is departmentally
forbidden to tip. Suppose he is a £350-p.a.
man going from Melbourne to Sydney:—
For the journey between Melbourne and Sydney
he draws seven hours’ extra pay, and on the return
trip five hours’ extra pay. An officer on salary of
£350 receives £1 17s. by way of recompense %
these hardships. In addition, he receives 17s. 7d.
as travelling expenses to reimburse the cost of meals,
tips, etc., and the amount he would ordinarily be
able to spend is 13s. 6d. Thus he draws £2 14s.
7d. while on the train and pays out 13s. 6d.
This travelling-time business or swindle
takes £13,000 p.a. from the taxpayer’s pocket.
In the words of the Public Service Board:
“It is an abuse of privilege which would not
be countenanced by any private undertaking
in the world.” But the payment or piracy
has become “a vested interest,” and “the
public service is particularly tenacious of
vested interests,” the triumvirate add with a
sigh. For venturing these and other mild
comments the Board has incurred the violent
hostility of some of the Labor members.
During the debate on the annual Public
Service Amendment Bill, a debate marked
by abject crawling to the Government em-
ployees for their votes, one of these politi-
cians thrilled the House of Heps, by declaring
that “the service is seething with discon-
tent.” The question is whether a service
which contains so many chronic invalids that
it worked, on an average, only 46 weeks in
1922-23 wouldn’t show a rapid improvement
if it seethed with the sack.
♦
Lost Markets.
The Australian Parliament completed its
labors and went to its long and well-paid
rest without doing anything immediate for
the woollen and worsted and hosiery indus-
tries. They are partly dead now, and arc
expected to be a great deal more dead before
the Legislature reintegrates and resumes its
conversational way. During the session no
lack of interest was shown in the producer,
provided he was the producer on the land,
for whom the Freetrader always has a kindly
feeling. Parliament provided for an export
bonus on wine, and another on cattle. It
arranged for advances to hopgrowers and
fruitgrowers, and gave a helping hand to the
dairying biz. and it remembered the need
of the brandy-maker for more Protection.
Possibly it was because the brandy-builder
is already an exporter in a small way that
he was considered, for the importance of get-
ting and retaining a hold on “foreign mar-
kets” is regarded as a very live question
indeed. But the textile manufacturer merely
asked for a better chance to secure and re-
tain the local market; and though his case
was recognised as urgent—almost desperate
—more than a year ago, Parliament went
home and left him in a suspended condition.
Australia wastes an amazing amount of
money in sending wool half round the world
in ships that are not its own and are much
less British than they once were, paying dis-
tant people who are much less British than
they were to make clothes for it, paying for
their return by the same old ships, and then
paying a heavy commission to importing mid-
dlemen who are not so Australian as they
might be to distribute the goods. It requires
a much higher tariff than the present one to
enable the local maker to compete against
this sort of thing. Through various causes,
of which the Freetrade superstition is one and
the currency problem is another, the British
textile manufacturer has to a great extent
gone out of business. He complains that
foreign goods come in for British wear, at
prices with which, in some cases, he couldn t
compete even if he got his wool for nothing.
But he does a trade, with labor at half Aus-
tralian cost, in putting a perfunctory finish
on foreign goods, so that, being one-quarter
British and three-quarters otherwise, they may
come, here under a low preferential tariff as
J. Bulb products. The one-quarter apd
three-quarters folly is nominally amended in
some degree, but tiie amendment doesn’t cone
in force for six months, so that the importers
may load up; and then there will doubtless
be negotiations for a further suspension, and
in any case a very dangerous measure of pre-
ference will still remain. The extent to which


Britain lias gone out of the business of being
the original and complete manufacturer is
suggested by the fact that it not only re-
sells to foreign makers a great deal of the
wool it imports, but has taken to selling
British wool, the product of the British
sheep, to foreign factories. Britain, like Aus-
tralia. is understood to be making a fierce eftort
to get into foreign markets. The extent to
which it is not arriving there, and the extent
to which the foreigner is still arriving in its
own market, is indicated by the last nine
months’ trade returns, covering the Ramsay
Macdonald period almost entirely: —
Nine Months Nine Months
of 1923. of 1924.
British imports .. £787,464,272 £909,681,754
British exports . . 652,935,172 628,095,145
Surplus imports .. £134,529,100 £281,586,609
The difference between the two surpluses is
£147.057,501) for nine months, or at the rate
of over £10,000,000 per month. The in-
crease of imports is a fair indication of how
J. Bull, now a more aggravated Freetrader
than before, is losing hold of his own market;
and as, under any preference system, his
market is more or less a halfway house to
the Australian one. it helps to indicate how
we are losing hold of ours. And the decrease of
exports, which, unfortunately, is not a de-
crease in our direction, tends to show how
the Old Man, under his unfortunate system,
isn’t progressing at all in the face of his
Protectionist competitors.

One Way Gold.
The problem has become really acute of how
to get money, said to be due to this country
in London, out from London, so that we will
have some more much-needed currency to
build houses and factories with, without being
driven to take the filthy lucre out in whisky,
female hats and motor-cars, which aren’t cur-
rency at all. The other day a cold fear
came on the community that the wool sales
might be paralysed through the real money
being almost all at one end, and fixed there,
so that foreign buyers, even with the best
intentions, might not be able to pay. Letters
on the vexed topic poured into the papers,
their burden being that we can’t get gold
from England, either to use as metallic cur-
rency or to serve as a safe basis for more
paper issues, because John Bull won’t part
with gold, even if it is our own. In the
circumstances it looks like a foolishness,
which becomes a worse foolishness every day,
to sell our gold output abroad. The
seller in England certainly gets himself
credited, in the books of a bank, with much
more per oz. than the nominal value as it was
in the gold circulation days, and thus makes a
"profit.” But it seems impossible to get at
either the old value or the new additional
value (which latter is the dazzling profit, and
constitutes the inducement to export) except
by bringing it here in the shape of goods, to
diminish the demand for our own goods and
put our own people out of work, or by taking
it in British notes, which are of no account
in Australia. Various people have already
suggested that British notes should be made
legal currency here, so that we could get
payment for our exported gold (and for any-
thing else that was coming to us) in some-
thing that we really could use, and not in
whisky, female hats and motor-cars. But
there is a danger that the British notes
would to a great extent push our own paper
money out of circulation, for a bit of paper
with an international value would be more
useful than a mere local “rag.” And as
Britain issues bits of print for as little as
10s., the displacement might be pretty
thorough. This would deprive Australia of
a considerable revenue, and when the market
was saturated with imported paper the old
exchange spectre would return looking as
fresh as ever. What for a long while past
lias seemed to The Bulletin to be the most
effective plan offering would be to stop the
export of gold for whatever period may be
necessary. If gold can’t be got from Eng-
land, even though it be our own gold, then
don’t let it go to England. Our Government
could buy the now comparatively small
annual supply at current price, and pay the
premium out of the profits of its note issue.
Then the seller would get a credit in an Aus-
tralian bank instead of in a British one.
He would be paid in Australian notes,
which have a local value, instead of in
British ones, which haven’t, or in Australian
goods rather than imported ones. If any-
thing Avcnt amiss with the calculation the
Government could always sell part of its
hoard abroad, for there is nothing irrevocable
about the possession of money. The fol-
-1 owing figures suggest one outstanding cause
of the financial trouble, and also the date
when it began :

The other day an appeal was printed in the
8. M. Herald from George Crowley, a
Avell-known Sydney business man, urging
that Australia had millions (probably many
millions) at credit in London, while here
absolute cash famine prevails, and urging
that the millions should be brought here for
use, even if £5 in every £IOO was lost in ex-
change. As he put the case:—
We have 40 or 50 millions of money at the other
end of the world, where it is yielding nothing. .. .
The situation is piquant in the pathetic helplessness
and incompetence of those responsible for the fiasco.
And the paper, in effect, asked dispassion-
ately what chance there was of collecting any
large sum even if we paid heavy exchange.
On the face of things the situation alleged
wouldn’t have arisen if Australia had stopped
the export of gold about the time when the
other fellow stopped. The only thing left
is to stop now. It isn’t exactly shutting the
stable door after the horse is stolen. The
tail of the animal remains, and with proper
confinement a horse should grow again.

A Report and Some Reflections.
Queensland finished its ninth year of con-
tinuous Labor administration last June, and
the Auditor-General has just reported there-
on. The combination, in its \'ery first year,
turned the best-paying railway system in
Australia into a money-loser. It progressed
with the work till its lines became the worst
money-losers on the continent —till, in tact,
they lost far more than all the lines of all
the other States combined. The total losses
now amount to 114 millions. At an early
date the Theodores went in heavily for State
enterprises, on the commendable pretext
of saving the profits for the people. They
succeeded in saving the profitable jobs for
their own people; the people in general get
hardly anything but losses. The Chillagoe
smelters have lost nearly £282,000. lbe
State coalmines, of which there seem to be
four, made losses, though private owners are
said to make sinfully large fortunes. The
arsenic-mine, which might have been a
legitimate investment if part of the Ministry
had eaten the product, and the three batteries
have all dropped money. The cattle-stations
are the usual disappointment. Lately the
cotton industry burst into what looked like
vigorous life. The Government lent the usual
kindly interference, and some £243,000 of
public money appears to be already gone.
The process of disaster is so regular that
the Ministry would probably come out a
heavy loser in the morning if locked up with
the Crown jewels overnight. Somebody has
also been robbing the Golden Casket —the
Government lottery which returns 10s. 54d.
out of every £ and keeps the other 9s. Old.
The Continuous Ministry which has done
these things apparently began with a genuine
conviction that, provided a man was
“advanced” in his Labor principles, he could
undertake any branch of Public Enterprise,
even to painting masterpieces by hand for
the National Gallery. Certainly bankers and
lawyers and even soldiers have taken on the
statesman’s business with striking success;
and there is no good reason why a school-
master shouldn’t, or a shearer. But ineffici-
ency and muddle and disappointment creep
in when the duties of a statesman are ex-
tended to include being a miner, butcher,
pastoralist, metallurgical expert, fishmonger,
saw-miller and sundries, and imply active
interference in all these industries because
constituents who want a rise must not be
alienated by the assumption of a stand-offish
attitude. And matters are inevitably worse
when the masses have been led to believe that
they can earn high wages by little work,
short hours, much sweltering at the races,
and the maintenance of a high and snortful
attitude towards anybody who is in the habit
of paying wages. A recent strike on a Bris-
bane wharf in defence of the right to pilfer
cargo was one of the results of this educa-
tion. Naturally in such circumstances the
party in power hasn’t produced the promised
prosperity. The unsatisfactory agricultural
position would be of comparatively minor
importance if manufactures flourished; but
they don’t. This is how the four most
populous States have compared with eqch
other and with the Commonwealth average
in recent years:—

N.S.W. hasn’t quite made up for the setback
it endured when the Dooley Ministry ran
its affairs, but there is nothing in the Ma
State or elsewhere to match the downslide
of Queensland —the richest member of the
Commonwealth in resources. Presumably
Theodore will go before he loses the State’s
last factory. But his prolonged existence
is a valuable commentary on the credulity of
humanity and the delusiveness of what people
imagine to be democratic institutions.
• ♦
Lawson and His Brethren.
There is a difference between the rotten
finance of Victoria and that of Queensland,
inasmuch as the manufacturing industries
of the former are the most alive on the main-
land and employ a larger and larger propor-
tion of the population, while those of the
latter are the deadest, and find work for a
smaller percentage of the inhabitants as
time goes on. Further, Victoria is the most
self-dependent of the States in the way of
subscribing its own loans, and isn't the
brassy cadger for Federal aids that Theo-
dore's State is. Yet it is degenerating into
a shocking financial condition, all the same.
It was during the Premiership of Long-
Continued Lawson that the rot definitely
set in. Within his limits Lawson was like
George 111. or Rehoboam I.- —a useful per-
son for spoiling the good show which better
men had built up. When a good dog’s master
has no pride in it, and is incapable of living
up to its level, the animal goes downhill very
fast, and the rule applies to other things be-
sides dogs. The report of the Victorian
Auditor-General is a tale of financial decay.
Lawson soon grew tired of hearing that his
State was a comparatively bright and shin-
ing light of solvency, and proceeded to blow
the light out. The tidiness of the house was
oppressive to his soul, and he acted on the
view that a little dirt would make it more
home-like. In his first financial year (1918-
19) the loan expenditure was not much above
the average, but then he got into his stride
and made the dust fly in this fashion:—
Victorian Loan Expenditure.
1918- £2,932,521 | 1921-22.. £11,804,991
1919- 7,601,266 | 1922-23.. 8,764,306
1920- . . 11,095,158 I 1923-24.. 8,873,380
This last effort put the Victorian debt up to
£124.108.326, and that means that it has
doubled in about 11} years. It isn’t an
extraordinary record for Australia, but it is
noteworthy as h.eing the sudden lapse of a
previously respected citizen, and as happen-
ing in the State which has the least pioneer-
ing work to do. And the Auditor-General
complains that as the loan investments in-
crease the quality of the assets depreciates.
They become less “permanent and reproduc-
tive,” and more suggestive that the man in
charge had the ear-marks of the bubbly
prospectus-monger. It isn’t merely a case of
taking about three times as much liquor; it
is a case of taking it methylated. Details of
the very questionable items are only avail-
able to June, 1923, but though worse thin gs
are confidently looked for when more figures
come along, affairs were bad enough then: —

That was a year ago, and large additions
have been made since. That the “Land for
Settlement” is, to a great extent, a dud is
now admitted all round. The fact that roads,
bridges, school and other buildings, consti-
tuting the second and third items, should
have practically doubled —should have ab-
sorbed almost as much debt in four years as
in the 60 years previous—is worse than a
dud. These things are not assets in this
connection; they are liabilities. They call
for upkeep and repair, and every new school
involves a new bill for working expenses. To
keep the “Defence” debt on the list as some-
thing permanent and reproductive, many
years after the States went out of the
Defence business, is comic opera. As for “All
Other,” which is neither railways, tramways,
telegraphs, telephones, water conservation,
water and sewerage, roads, bridges, schools
or other buildings, land for settlement or
defence, all the States have it in an increas-
ing form. What will be remembered against
Victoria’s Lawson Ministry is, not that it
was worse than its neighbors, but that it
took over a going concern which was far
above the average and did a remarkable lot to
bring it down to the average. Not in full
measure, but in a measure, it is entitled to
such credit as belongs to the pioneer who
teaches a baby to drink gin.
Preliminary Whitewash.
A soft-footed band of wliitewashers is
already at work in a way that may tend to
nullify the proposed research into the alleged
corruption at Sydney Town Hall—an inquiry
which is years overdue. In other words,
there is a tendency to assume that, in com-
mon fairness, inquiry must be restricted to
the particular case in which complaint has
been made; and if the verdict is one of “not
proven,” then all parties concerned are to
receive a clean bill of health covering the
period from birth to now. The charge at
present before an unastonished public is that
two men, professedly acting on the part of
certain corrupt aldermen, Avaited on one man,
carefully avoiding the presence of witnesses,
and showed him how he could buy a valu-
able concession at the low price of £IOOO, the
money to be divided among corrupt alder-
men. But the community is likely to ivait
a century for a cleaning up if it waits till
some blackmailed person comes along with a
provable case, and if it restricts the investiga-
tion to that case and doesn’t start any gen-
eral overhaul. It would also wait a long
while for a murder conviction if it waited
till either the corpse or the homicide moved
in the matter, and then confined its researches
within the strict limits of his information.
In most cases of bribery neither party ob-
jects, the matter being made profitable to
both at the cost of an unconscious third
party—the public. In most other cases it
doesn’t seem worth while to waste time and
make enemies when the person who attempts
the exposure has no legal proof. The experi-
enced bribe-taker doesn’t take crossed cheques
or marked notes, and it is difficult to have
concealed witnesses under the table or a
Diona'Sxus’s Ear with dictaphone attached
in full working order at the right moment,
for the agent avoids fixed appointments. One
specific matter which awaits investigation,
but which can’t be inquired into according to
the new rules of the game, because neither
party has lodged an information, concerns
the fierce but unsatisfied desire of certain Syd-
ney aldermen to pay £70,000 or thereabouts
for a coal lease, officially stated to be worth
from £SOOO down to nothing. A similar case
was that in Avhich a desperate effort was made
to hire a firm of architects (one specific
firm) for £30,000 or so where there Avas no
visible architectural work to be done. And a
subject for general investigation is the in-
tense competition, among men with little or
no visible means, for rather exacting work in
the municipal council, where there is no
ostensible remuneration and very little osten-
sible honor. Should reseai’ch into the sus-
picious condition of Sydney’s city politics be
really too much trouble, matters might be
simplified by relieving the whole force of
aldermen from their duties, not on the
ground that some of them may have swindled
the city, but rather because the city declines
to swindle them by taking their valuable ser-
vices gratis apy longer. Then the paid-com-
missioner method might have a trial.
The Universities and a Crust.
"X2X” on University training as a handicap:
In its annual report the Appointments Board of
Sydney Uni. draws attention to the difficulty women
graduates have in securing positions. The Board
might well have gone further and said that, with
the exception of graduates from the professional
schools —law, medicine and engineering—most of the
men are in much the same fix. Amongst employers
in the commercial and industrial world there is an
aversion to University-trained men, principally on
the ground that they are unpractical and inclined to
be dogmatic; and because of this it is rarely that
business men look to the Uni. as a recruiting-ground
for the raw material for executive and other positions.
Even those with technical jobs to fill are generally
disinclined to take men from the science schools,
so that the secretaries of Sydney and Melbourne
scientific bodies which make efforts to secure work for
their members have on their books the names of
several hundred technologists, some of whom have
not earned a shilling since they left the Uni. Besides
these there are many more who, disheartened by their
fruitless attempts to acquire a job, have drifted into
other work. Still others have gone to England and
America where, employers having different ideas re-
garding the value of a ’Varsity training, they have
had no difficulty in obtaining employment, usually
at salaries which they could not hope to earn in
Australia after a dozen years. This represents a
dead loss to the country which has borne the expense
of educating them.
The curious thing about it is that it is only in
Australia that there exists this prejudice against the
graduate. Practically everywhere else he is given
preference. In America especially most leaders of
industry go to (he big Universities for the young men
and women required for the commissioned ranks of
business; frequently they take these graduates into
their offices, and pay them substantial salaries while
training them. The theory is that the man or woman
who possesses the initiative to take a University
course, and the brains to pass the examinations,
possesses also the brains necessary for success in the
commercial world. In the higher branches of the
English Civil Service, such as the Foreign and
Colonial Offices, a course, or at least part of a course,
at Oxford or Cambridge is a necessity. Here, in the
few jobs that the State offers, the graduate finds
that his degree in Arts puts him upon a no higher
level than the youth who has entered the Service
from a State school after passing an elementary exami-
nation. For the woman graduate there is also
teaching, with the addition of a library assistant's
position, doing work that could be as well done by
a girl from one of the business colleges.
Naturally such treatment is extremely discouraging,
and, unless the recipient of it is fortunate enough
to possess the money with which to get out of the
country, it tends to make him ask himself to what
purpose he has wasted three or four years and five
hundred pounds or so in acquiring a diploma which,
so far from being of any value in life’s struggle,
seems to be a deadweight. And as more and more
graduates demand this of themselves, so will there be
a slackening-off in the numbers of those taking
University courses, with a lowering of the country s
cultural standards, just at the time when there is an
improvement in the standards of other countries.
Though the effect of this may not at first be apparent,
it will show later, to the detriment of Australia.
The Old Laborism and the New.
“Wodgil” : The Old Labor Politician was
in a dolorous mood. “I despair of these
young fellows,” he groaned. “They can talk
the leg off an iron pot, but what do they
know? They read nothing but newspapers
(the yellower the better) and racebooks.
The only time they ever burn the midnight
oil is when the lights go out in the card-
room and the barman brings in a liurricane-
lamp. Why, at Labor conferences 25 and
30 years ago it was the exception to meet a
man who wasn’t, in his way, well read.
They were rough-cut sleepers, many of those
early-day delegates, but they didn’t speak
from empty minds. They studied Spencer.
Adam Smith, Alfred Russel Wallace,
Huxley and Iyidd. Books like Mill ‘On
Liberty,’ ‘Progress and Poverty’ and Win-
wood Read’s ‘Martyrdom of Man’ they
knew almost by heart. Carlyle wasn’t too
old-fashioned for them, nor Darwin too
deep. But now!” —and the O.L.P. gazed
gloomily at his glass. There is truth in the
ancient’s words, but not the whole truth.
These young Labor politicians and delegates
must read something more than the weights
and the gallops and the Putrid Scandals and
’Orrible Murders, or they wouldn’t spout the
stuff they do. Some of them mouth the
soppy pacifism of the Second Internationale.
Others pine for the day when industries will
be nationalised and controlled by Boards
“subject to a Soopreme Ekernomic Council’
—the very policy and jargon of Red Russia.
Others again have obviously been inspired
by I.WAV. and Tammany influences from
the other side of the Pacific—witness the
“preamble” adopted at every Trades Union
Congress, with its flamboyant references to
“the class-war,” and the prevalence of Tam-
many practices and Tammany terminology.
Tammany terminology, I say, and this brings
me to what is perhaps the most curious dif-
ference between the new Laborism and the
old. When slang was introduced at the early-
day conferences mentioned by my venerable
friend it was invariably home-grown —whip-
cracks of Australian speech from the shear-
ing-shed, the stope and the cattle-camp.
But the slang now employed by the Labor
mob-orator is practically all American, and
very ugly American it is. When the con-
troversy was raging in Sydney about the
ballot-boxes with sliding panels the odious
word “frame-up” was dragged in so often
by both sides that it became a weariness of
the flesh. Listen, as I did, to one of the
new Laborites speaking in defence of the ex-
pelled faction: —
Mr. Chairman and Comrades, —I’m callin’ you
“comrades,” but a man ’ll have to call you “bone-
heads” if you fall for this Willis dope. Boneheads
and boobs. I’m here to put you wise, if you ain't
mutts, to the stuff these insidyous agents of wage-
pluggery are tryin’ to put over. It’s nothin’ but
a stinkin’ frame-up. Gee, I’m givjn’ you the reel
dope. It’s a frame-up I tell you, feller wage-plugs,
and I won’t stand for it.
The Australian worker is sound at heart,
hut I wish his “movement” would abandon
its strange subserviency to foreigners and
go back to Australian ways of thought and
speech. Then there would be a chance of
getting our political and economic affairs
settled on commonsense Australian lines.
They will certainly never be settled on Red-
Russian, Pommy-pacifist. American I.W.W.
or American Tammany lines.
+
China and Its Trade.
The party politicians of China employ the
suffrages of bayonets instead of ballot-boxes.
That is why “Little Hsu,” who, since he was
forcibly expelled from Peking some time ago.
has been, like W. M. Hughes, trying to re-
cuperate himself politically by foreign travel,
has just returned and acquired an un-
attached army by purchase: W. M. Hughes
adopts the milder method of opening a rose-
sliow at Lindfield. In spite of the manoeuvres
around Shanghai, however, China appears to
be nearer unification at present than she has
been for many years. Ciiang Tso-Luj, the
Manchurian robber baron, has been checked
bv floods and winter weather on the wrong
side of the Great Wall; and meantime Wu
Pei-fu has consolidated his position on the
other side. He has appointed his own lieu-
tenants to the provinces of Hunan and
Hupeh, has subjugated Szechuan and Shensi,
and is himself inspector-general of Chihli,
Honan and Shantung. The result of the
fighting about Shanghai lias placed him in
control of Kiangsu, Iviangsi, Anhui and
Chekiang, and tl\ere only remain the four
southern provinces more or less siding with
the vacillating Sun. If Chang captured
Peking Wu would doubtless counter that
move by making his capital at Nanking or
Hangchow, both of which have been capitals
before, are more Chinese than the Mancliu
headquarters up north, and are nearer the
new hub of the Pacific, which is Shanghai,
the commercial outlet of the mighty Yangtse.
The foreign trade of Kiangsu and Chekiang
alone amounted last year to over 50 per cent,
of the total foreign trade of China, Sliang-

Our Defence Trainees.
An old officer suggests a way out:—
The trouble with Compulsory Service is that the
system lias never got going properly, and there is
no smooth working organisation to absorb the annual
draft of recruits. The result is that the same old
necessary but uninteresting elementary drill has to
be repeated each year, the training period expiring
before more attractive work is reached. In 1911,
when compulsory drill began, the old Militia and
Volunteer units were in existence, and each July
took over the yearly quota of recruits from the
■senior cadets. The 1912 draft had only one year’s
raining, the 1913 lot two and the 1914 quota three
’ ears, and then came the war; so no unit ever received
the system’s four-year trained cadet. In 1914, too,
most of the rank and file had. gone from the old
volunteer regiments, and the few officers had been
distributed amongst the new formations, which had
not had time to settle down ; in fact, none of them
had reached their full growth. After the war the
identity of the old units had gone, and a reorganisa-
tion intended to identify the trainee formations with
those of the A.I.P. was introduced. But the expendi-
ture and training period were so reduced that no
opportunity has been ( given for the present units to
get together long enough to acquire the necessary
combination and team-work, the comradeship and
discipline, the corporate pride in themselves and their
officers and n.c.o.’s, and all that is meant by esprit
cle corps. None of to-day’s trainees were old enough
to have served in the A.1.F., and many hardly know
what company » they belong to, let alone their
brigade or division. Yet Australia since 19-20 has
had for the first time a thoroughly' trained and war-
proven Staff Corps which, when the war records of
its members are examined, is probably the ablest and
most democratic (and cheapest) in the world. Citizen
officers and N.C.O.’s, too, were plentiful and efficient
and enthusiastic; and had all the trainees been
brought into camp for some weeks, the Common-
wealth would have had a thoroughly trained, discip-
lined and organised citizen army, rich in the tra-
ditions and esprit de corps of the A.I.F. The
elementary' drudgery' would be over, and each year's
quota of recruits would look forward to the advanced
work, while the officers and N.C.O.’s would have
scope for their ability and something to sustain
their enthusiasm. Once this stage was reached, an
annual camp of eight or ten days would be sufficient
to keep the force up to date; there would still be
home-training and classes for specialists, and Aus-
tralia would have the cheapest and most efficient
force in the world. But a combination of short-
sighted politicians, red-raggers who want to white-
ant all organised law-preserving bodies, fanatical
parse ns and selfish employers prevented advantage
being taken of this unique opportunity. But it is
not too late. Let the trainees of four or five years
be called up and given six or eight weeks’ continuous
camp, and thereafter the annual draft will fit into
the Australian army as a spare part into an
engine. The cost, too, would not be prohibitive, for
many items remain the same whether the camp is
long or short.
♦
“914”: ,T. P. Jones, Vic. Minister for
Health, tells us (B. 16/10/’24) that any
man or woman who contracts a venereal
disease can “go up to the clinic, get cured
and pick up another the week after,” and
asks for a suggestion to prevent such a con-
tingency. The remedy is obviously the teach-
ing of prophylaxis at the clinic. I have
been working at one of Sydney’s largest
clinics for some time past, and I know that
prophylaxis is not taught. At the end of
each man’s treatment he should be given a
leaflet describing the use of calomel and pot.
permang. as preventives of syphilis and
gonorrhoea, together with a supply of each.
It’s no use telling them to buy these things;
they won’t. It would cost the State little
enough to supply them gratis to cured
patients as an effective means of combating
further disease. I am referring to men only,
because it is practically an anatomical im-
possibility to apply prophylaxis to women.
“Q.E.D.” evidently would rely more on teach-
ing. Telling the patients is useless, without
giving them the means to carry out the in-
structions. Prophylaxis, efficiently impressed
on males, will stamp out the disease in one
generation, or, at most, two, as congenital
syphilis does not extend to the third genera-
tion. And, above all, it will protect inno-
cent women and children.
“Nakhoda” : I thought to escape the horrors
of Health Week in Sydney this year by flee-
ing to the country, but I forgot the imma-
nency of the ether. The week before last I
was an ordinary, callous, careless human
being, eating, drinking and moving about the
world with all the confident valor of igno-
rance; since listening-in for the last six
days to a succession of “health” talks broad-
casted by well-meaning medical pessimists I
have walked barefoot over a sea of knives
through a nightmare of grisly and invisible
dangers; the milk-jug has become a leaping-
out place for harmful bacilli, and J can no
longer watch the baby suck the bath sponge
with equanimity. The culmination came the
other night when a soft, insinuating voice
from the upper air told me that, along
with all my fellowjneu, I was suffering from
tuberculosis; the tubercle bacillus, came the
terrifying warning, is probably present in
the bodies of every one of us. I wonder if
the gentlemen responsible for disseminating
this stuff are aware of the phenomenon which
Coue calls “adverse auto-suggestion.” In-
numerable instances are on record of people
acquiring ailments simply through being told
they have them. The comjtnercial interests
whose business it is to sell proprietary medi-
cines made this discovery long before Coue
and know its value. Their campaign in the
interests of disease usually commences at the

“Centurion” : The cabled report that : the
Wahabis, the most extreme of the wowser
sects of Islam, have captured the sacred city
of Mecca should make the Moslem world
sit up. The Wahabis, like the followers
of the Senussi in Western Egypt and Tripoli,
are a religious sect which has grown into a
small community. Founded in Central
Arabia, the Wahabi faith is even more dour
and downright than the Senussi’s. If the
latter is the Free Kirk of Islam, the Wahabi
is the Cameronian. Like the Senussi, IBN
Abu el Waiiab took “Back to the Koran!”
as his slogan. He further forbade all pil-
grimages to holy shrines, the use of tobacco
and the wearing of silk, and, going further
than the Senussi, enjoined that all who re-
fused to accept his doctrine, Pagan, Moslem
or Christian, man, woman or child, should
be put to the sword. This is quite enough
to account for what the cable the other day
called “considerable anxiety in Mecca.” The
Wahabi warrior is probably the only one who
carries a written order of admission to Para-
dise. When the original El Wahab began
liis conversions, he issued each of his soldiers
with a free pass to Heaven, signed by him-
self. No one has ever come back to com-
plain' that the house-manager has failed to
honor the brief, so the custom is continued
by El WahAb’s successors.

“Clifford Snook" : One of the pleas ad-
vanced while the N. S. Wales Nominee House
was discussing the Marriage Bill was that it
was superfluous, as the law already provided
a remedy: if any rev. or other gentleman
told an R.C. or other person who had per-
petrated a civil marriage that he or she was
an immoral creature and the baby a child
of shame, libel proceedings could be taken.
Now, quite apart from the fact that the
insult to the' State by the aspersion on its
marriage certificate would remain, the idea of
telling, say, a laborer or his wife that their
remedy against persecution is to take on the
battle of financial giants which Myerson
has been conducting, for it seems like years,
against Smith’s Weekly has a touch of the
grotesque. Outside the Small Debts Court
and such-like minor jurisdictions Australian
law has become so costly that a small man
with a big grievance against a large citizen
has now to take what little satisfaction he
can get by poisoning his enemy’s dog. And
the enemy may not even have an accessible
dog.
■ «
“Wafin” ; As a senior-cadet officer I should
like to buy into this “compulsory training”
argument. After the enthusiasm of the first
year or so had cooled, there were few effici-
ent units in Victoria outside the schools.
This was smugly regarded as another demon-
stration of the “public school spirit.” Actu-
ally the people responsible were the instruc-
tors. In the schools the officer is also a
teacher, and so usually is a practical psycho-
logist. At the drill-hall, on the other hand,
there is so little attraction, pecuniary or
otherwise, offered to the two-pip man that
anyone who knows squad-drill and has
mugged up the Regs, is welcomed with open
arms. As a consequence most of the officers
are either enthusiasts lacking the requisite,
qualifications, or swollen-headed youngsters
whose souls yearn for “authority.” The only
really efficient man about the place is likely
to be the W. 0., and often he is the only one
who can do anything with the trainees. The
area officer is almost always a good instruc-
tor ; but. since the recent reduction of staff,
he has such multifarious duties that he is
a very good organiser if he can get out to
parade regularly. Wlnit is required. most
urgently is a larger number of trained men;
but this would cost money which most Gov-
ernments prefer to devote to more attractive
vote-bait. When the apprenticeship question
is settled, along the lines of compulsory
attendance at technical schools, there will
arise an opportunity to settle the compulsory-
training question at the -same time.
*
“Clerk” : Another of Railway Commis-
sioner Clapp's good ambitions was realised
on October 13 when the first Vic. “Better
Farming” train left Melbourne on a ten-day
tour of Gippsland, carrying a selected assort-
ment of cattle, swine and agricultural ex-
perts. The last will lecture the cocky en
route, telling him why he shouldn’t feed the
pigs out of the same pails that he uses when
lie milks the cows, and how to distinguish
between Tamworths and Berkshires; and
“domestic economy” exponents will instruct
the cocky’s wife in various points regard-
ing children’s welfare, etc. “Better Farm-
ing” trains have been run in America and
South Africa, and Clapp says that this one
won’t be the last in Victoria.
A
“Seastiells” : Something must be done to
lessen the misery which sheep and cattle
suffer in long-distance transport by rail. In
North Queensland I lately passed a large
trainload of sheep side-tracked at a country
station; the animals had come from the
Central West, and were bound south. In
most of the trucks they were so tightly
packed that it was next to impossible for one
to lie down. The poor devils were dog-tired,
and every now and then one would try to
get down, but was prevented from doing so
by its crowding companions. When I ex-
pressed compassion for the poor brutes some-
one remarked that it was necessary to crowd
them, and keep them on their feet, as one"
they got down it was the end of them. If
lying-down room can’t be provided, then they
should at least be given a spell out of the
trucks.

“Wart”; About 12 months ago ex-Senator
Keating wrote in The Bulletin about the
difficulties of Australian authors, especially
as regards American competition. Syd Jack-
son, M.H.R., for Bass, took the matter up,
and induced Prime Minister Bruce to bring
Keating’s article before English authori-
ties on his last visit to the Cold Country.
Briefly, the reply is that careful inquiries
have established that the Commonwealth
cannot demand that “foreign authors’ ”
books must be set up and printed in Aus-
tralia to obtain Australian copyright, the
obstacle being the Copyright Union. About
90 per cent, of the American books now com-
ing to Australia are printed and copyrighted
in Britain by British publishing houses; the
consent of the British Government would
b" necessary if Australia wished to deny
these books copyright, and that is unlikely
to be granted. Any action with regard to
the remaining 10 per cent, would probably
only cause them to be printed in. Britain.
The letter ends by stating that, as the,
U.S.A. copyright laws have lately been lib-
eralised, and attempts made to secure fur-
ther concessions, the proper course is to
request the British Government to approach
the U.S.A. authorities. What they are to
do in the matter isn’t made clear. All that
is clear is that Australian authors are sacri-
ficed because writers of cheap American
stuff have taken refuge in British. publish-
ers’ offices. Well, perhaps even that can
be got over. We have still our Customs
weapon to fight with.
“Kismet” : I happened across Auturio the
Greek five years ago in Darwin. He had
just arrived with a batch of liis country-
men—an abject youth and almost unpleas-
antly soft-spoken. lie had no English, but,
like all good Levantines, he immediately
joined the union, and was signed on to a
Federal Government hotel as boots and
handy-man, under an award that made his
wage £3 17s. Gd. a week. He mentioned
casually that his earning capacity in Athens
had been about Gd. a week in English money
and find his own bed. He soon left the
hotel for bigger money at Vesteys’. Eighteen
months ago I met Artubio in Sydney,
highly prosperous looking, but as abject
as ever. In atomic English he told that lie
was then a “glassawash” in a cafe at £4
10s. a week. Yesterday I came across him
again, strolling nonchalantly through the
King-street arcade, even more shiningly
prosperous and apologetic for his existence.
In his queer jargon he murmured that he
had just returned from a trip to Athens and
had brought back his marmar and farder and
two bruders. “Can they speak English?” I
inquired. “Me I teach ’em!” smiled
Arturio. “Every day on ship I school- —
‘Yas. Na. Wot say? Tanks.’”. '.“Shall
you go back to Darwin when Vesteys’ open?”
“No dam’ fear. I waiter here; every week
wage and tip nine-ten pound. My bruders
good jobs too. We stop.” Five more city
parasites! Do we really need Greeks to
open our oysters?

Vic. Premier Prendergast’s first essay in
finance suggests that lie is preparing for an
early election. Sixty thousand people now
liable to pay income-tax are to be relieved
completely. A deduction of £lOO for a wife
and of £5O for each child (instead of £3O. as
at present) will be another substantial con-
cession. Notwithstanding a hustings pledge
there is to be no additional land-tax, and
the Treasury is to make good to the railways
(out of taxation) the reduction of 10 per
cent, on the carriage of agricultural products.
Then the bookmakers will have £70.000 a
year less to pay, and charities will get
£75,000 more. And all at the expense of
people who happen to have more than £6OO
a year an.i can’t withhold the knowledge
from the taxation authorities. The rates
on their incomes are. to be doubled in some
cases; in others nearly trebled. It is taken
for granted that they don't vote for Prender-
gast’s crowd.
British Minister Thomas made a bid for
applause when he “regretted that the dis-
tribution of Australian meat was so ineffec-
tive that the producer received only 2d. per
lb., whereas the consumer paid Is. 4d.” It
must always cost something by the time the
cow is mustered, driven to the railway (some-
times dying on the way), loaded on trucks,
trucked to its destination (also occasionally
dying and always deteriorating), unloaded,
sold (on commission), killed, skinned, frozen,
shipped, kept frozen on the ship, unloaded,
carted, handled, re-sold, thawed, and retailed
in the rack-rented shop (where it also fre-
quently goes bad, especially in the fly sea-
son), possibly delivered at the consumer’s
door, and maybe in the end written off as
a bad debt. The original owner of the cow
is lucky to get 2d., with occasionally a knight-
hood and a seat in the Upper House thrown
in. He might get a good deal more —in cash,
at any rate —if the factory-workers who
supply Australia were here to eat the cow
on the spot.
The charity dole system is demoralising
Britain all right. In order to mark their
appreciation of the services of the Navy
and the Mercantile Marine during the war,
Maoriland sheepowners purchased a large
residence and established a fund for training
boys for farm life in the Dominion. The
scheme was originally designed for the
benefit of sons of men killed or incapacitated
in the war. One of the organisers, who re-
cently canvassed Britain for suitable recruits,
reports, however, that, owing to the system
of doles, parents are disinclined to allow
boys to leave home. About 200 lads per year
are required: so far only 25 have availed
themselves of the opportunity, though two
batches of about 30 each are due to follow.
Should Britain give the Macdonald Gov-
ernment a small but real majority it may
easily consist of Communists, those incon-
venient people who sing “The Red Flag” at
meetings where it is better kept in the back-
ground. In other words, they instead of the
Liberals may hold the balance of power, and
demand that their views be considered.
These will include ratification of the treaty
for the loan to Russia, and may include the
■’independence” of Ireland, India, Egypt and
“other colonies.” Anyhow, it is well to
know that a British party is prepared to
tell the world that places like our Northern
Territory, or even like Westralia, or Aus-
tralia itself, arc open to selection or annexa-
tion. To be forewarned is to be forearmed
—-sometimes.
The S. Aus. Leg. Council fell heavily on
the Labor Government’s adult suffrage pro-
posal, which, like the Recommendations, for
Honors Bill, failed to reach the committee
stage. Gunn and co. profess to be indig-
nant, but for a variety of reasons they are
rather pleased. Second Chambers with re-
stricted franchises, and the nominated sort
also, come in very handy when embarrassing
measures arc forced on Labor Governments
by the extremists of the party. Scaddan
discovered this in Westralia, and Theodore
has had cause to regret the fit of enthusi-
asm in which lie destroyed the Queensland
nominee Chamber after a referendum had
gone against its destruction. He could have
ONE JOB AT A TIME.
“The Vic. POLICE JOURSAL complains that the police cannot be expected to repress crime while
they are impelled to tramp the city and suburbs issuing summonses, collecting data for electoral rolls,
compiling statistics, making inquiries for the Postal Department, supervising old-age pensions and
numerous other routine jobs.”
HOUSEUOLDER: “Quick —there are burglars in the house!”
P.C. 999: “Yes, yes; hut I gotter see if you're on the electoral roll first; and what
about the dog license?”
relied upon the nominee Chamber to throw
out the Forty-four-hour Week Bill, which
he has been obliged to promise against his
better judgment.
Protection for an industry which makes
things is good, but protection for an indus-
try which merely destroys is a doubtful
boon. The timber-getters of N.S.W. North
Coast want a higher tariff to keep out Ameri-
can Oregon so that they can continue their
depredations on Australia’s dwindling stock
of hardwoods, which are largely exported.
If there was a law compelling every private
owner and public trustee to plant a tree —
or, better, two trees —for each one that they
allowed to be chopped down, the duty would
be all right; but while re-foresting is prac-
tically unattempted. N.S.W. might well let
other countries denude themselves if they are
foolish enough to do it.
A scheme is mooted to spend £300,000 on
planting settlers in the Monaro district
of N. S. Wales. Bombala is the typical
Monaro town, 60 miles from a good port,
which the settler can’t use to any profit
because there is no railway, and 320 miles
from Sydney, which he can’t use to much
profit because the distance is too great.
Owing to fear lest a new city might grow,
and relieve the pressure on Sydney’s water
supply and on its slums, the present condition
is expected to continue. And the difficulty of
inducing any of Sydney’s best-advertised phi-
lanthropists to take the slightest interest in
new States or new cities is expected to con-
tinue also.
Hon. Minister Munsie, introducing the
State Lotteries Bill in the Westralian
Assembly, explained that the Labor Govern-
ment hoped to get £150,000 of the £250,000
which, it had heard, was transmitted to
Tattersall’s every year through a Perth
firm. Perhaps if the Governnient offered
the public premium bonds instead of lottery
tickets it would get the whole £250,000. It
might also secure a large proportion of the
money now lost to McSliortodds and out
deeply into the profits on Wren’s two Perth
racecourses. But the new Laborism has a
warm regard for Wren and McSliortodds,
and sees nothing wrong in exploiting the
follies of the unthrifty. So there are to be
no premium bonds.
The search for the two female castaways
of the Douglas Mawson has failed, either
because no such persons exist, or because
their captors, having received a great deal
too much notice, hid the inconvenient wit-
nesses—above or under ground. However it
may be, people have learned that the arm
of the law in the North is very short and
very slow, and that the sea is more deserted
than it was, and some of the land is uppa-
rently even more unknown than when the
Commonwealth was given authority in those
parts. And if a foreign Power —probably a
colored Power —hasn’t also observed it, then
we have had almost more luck than we
deserve.
In the midst of all this row over Ne
Tcm ere in N. S. Wales it might be just as
well to remember that marriage law is a
Federal job. But as marriage law is also
really a nuisance, Australia’s well-paid Par-
liament has left off work and gone fishing
—on full pay.
Vic. Railway Commissioners have made no
protest against the Labor Government’s re-
duction of freights on agricultural and dairy
products, for the very good reason that it
is costing them nothing. An item of £114,000
has been placed on the Treasury Estimates
to cover the expected loss for nine months
of 1924-25. The Railway Department wound
up last financial year with a nominal surplus
of £lO,OOO, and expects to conclude the cur-
rent year with one of £ll,OOO, but free
passes for assorted deadheads and losses on
nonpaying lines (£lll,OOO last year), as
well as the freight-reduction item, are
charged up to the Treasury. In other words,
the taxpayer has to find the money to make
the Commissioners’ balance-sheet look pretty.
The resemblance between N. S. Wales
Labor politics and the politics of Tammany
Hall grows really startling. In Sydney last
week a barman and a hotel-manager were
arrested at the instance of Murphy, M.L.A.,
and charged with having attempted to ex-
tract £5O from him by the representation
that they would square certain members of
ait inquisitorial A.L.P. executive —Murphy
is the usual monthly candidate for expul-
sion from the “movement.” With perfect
propriety the scene might be changed to
New York or Chicago in the saloon-keeping
period. And the probabilities arc that the
parties to the proceedings discuss them in
the American language.
Ex-Premier Barwell was given a bad time
in South Aus. Assembly when lie attacked
the Labor Government for not pressing more
firmly the matter of the North-South rail-
way. Gunn he accused of “meekly acced-
ing to the dishonest attitude of the Com-
monwealth Government,” and of “not show-
ing that backbone we have a right to ex-
pect.” To which the reply was that Bar-
well had been Premier for four years and
let the Commonwealth Government walk over
him. “Your backbone was only whalebone,”
said a scornful Minister. Then the subject
was changed.
Having borrowed a copy of the Queens-
land Profiteering Prevention Act from Theo-
dore, Vic. Premier Prendergast is going to
introduce similar legislation. This and exemp-
tion from paying income-tax are two of the
sops he is offering to his supporters. Price-
fixing was tried in Victoria during and imme-
diately after the war. It worked so unsatis-
factorily that in December, 1920, when Law-
son, the then Premier, sought to have the
expedient continued for another year, he was
heavily defeated. But propaganda is propa-
ganda, so price-fixing goes on the hoarding
along with other vote-catching streamers.
The new Commonwealth Bank directors
appointed their chief officers last week:
acting-governor Kell to be>governor; .T. S.
Scott, Melbourne manager, to be deputy-
governor. With a Board now in existence
the titles should have been changed. And
no permanent appointments at all should
have been made just yet. That matter of
the dismissal or retirement or whatever it
was of the former chief inspector, Mark
Young, ought to be cleared up. At present
there is at least a suspicion that strings were
pulled vigorously among the “heads” as soon
as Denison Miller died—that cliques and
groups were formed, and that in the jostling
for places Young was crowded out. That
suspicion wasn’t in the least removed by
Priminister Bruce’s statement on the sub-
ject just before the Federal Parliament
adjourned. He undertook then that the Gov-
ernment would inquire into the matter.
Pending that inquiry the permanent appoint-
ments should have been held over.
Henry Howard, a former Methodist par-
son of S. Aus., and generally a very sensible
one, has been giving his Northern Terri-
tory rat a little run in Canada: “There are
large areas in Northern Australia where it
is impossible for whites to live. I fail to
see why they should not be thrown open to
our fellow-citizens in India.” And there
are plenty of Methodist churches in South
Aus. on whose collections it is impossible
for whites to live decently; and this paper
fails to see why they shouldn’t be thrown
open to our fellow-citizens in India. But
there is this difference between Howard and
The Bulletin : it is quite prepared to
name those churches; while if Howard names
his “large areas” he will be up against the
difficulty that whites have been doing there for
years what he says whites can’t do. On
almost the very day that the papers men-
tioned Howard’s rat they also reported that
at a meeting in Darwin to protest against
the tired southern way in which the search
for the supposed Douglas Mawson castaways
h.ad been made, the chief motion was intro-
duced by E. V. Brown, “for nearly 50 years
a resident of the town.” And “Manny”
Brown is still a mere youngster: his father
was playing cricket at Darwin only a year
or two ago.
McSliortodds was delighted with a line and
a half in Vic. Premier Prendergast’s budget
speech, announcing that the super betting tax
clapped on by McPliairson three years ago
would not be continued when it expired on
December 31. The 6d., 2d. and Id. rates
will be collected at Flemington at Cup-time
and for the following 10 weeks, but on
January 1 the impost will be 3d. in the grand-
stand and Id. in other parts as formerly.
The sacrifice of revenue for the six months
thereafter will be just on £40,000. And while
this costly favor is being extended to the
roaring parasite behind the bag, the taxa-
tion of incomes out of which wages are paid
is being raised 50 per cent, and more. But
McSliortodds poses as a friend of Labor, and
Labor looks out for its friends.
NO GO!

“A motion that women should be eligible for

All other barriers down she’s sent
That used to keep her fretting;
Some fell to reasoned argument
And some to suffragetting.
’Mid those of bifurcated “docs.”
She hangs her lettered shingles;
With brother man in jury box
And on the bench she mingles.
One fort alone defies attack
U.y gentle means or drastic ;
With scowling brows and utter lack
Of equity they shoo her back
From paths ecclesiastic.
In learned counsel’s bands and wig
She stands, a picture pleasing;
The scholar’s gown, the mayoral rig
And chain are hers for seizing.
To many a seat in Parliament
Her skirts of right she swishes,
To speak her little piece intent
And voice her sex’s wishes.
But still their shrine the churchmen guard,
At woman’s claims revolted.
She finds, ’gainst knocks however hard,
The pulpit and the lectern barred,
The very vestry bolted.
Her voice may hymns and anthems swell,
Her knees may press the hassock,
But not for her the chasuble
Dalmatic, alb or cassock.
The shade of Paul, if she should preach,
Alight rise aghast! The nippers
In Sunday-schools they let her teach
And work the curate slippers,
What more should she require? What more?
Albeit demonstrated for
All other callings fitted,
Still shall defiant Church ignore
Her onward march, and sternly score
Even upon the vestry door
Its “Women Not Admitted!”

“X.N.0.”: Thomas Doyle, a Melbourne
sailor, has recently been paragraphed as hav-
ing received ss. Id. “prize money” for the
Battle of Jutland, which, it is claimed, is the
first payment on this account made in Aus-
tralia. It isn’t, for I got mine last February,
and the framed money-order now hangs on
my wall; but having been a full-blown
“spun-yarn major” (a lieutenant-com-
mander ranks with an army major), mine
amounted to a whole £1 Os. 6d. By way of
a detail, this is “prize bounty,” not “prize
money.” The latter is provided by the pro-
ceeds of the sale of merchant ships and their
cargoes after capture and “condemnation” as
“lawful prize” by a Prize Court. Prize
“bounty” is a gift from tbe Admiralty of
£5 per head for every officer and man of an
enemy warship destroyed in action. Prize
money is now divided in a certain proportion
amongst all officers and men in the service.

also before the last war. If the rule had
remained in force I don’t think Dudley de

his share of the lOtli Cruiser Suuadron cap-
tures would have run into millions. Even
my whack from the capture of the Lutzow
at Suez in 1014 would have been about
£50,000 —but what’s the use of thinking
about it? I wonder if their Lordships of the
Admiralty will ever find out that my pound-

the disgusted wife of an ex-A.T.F. man who
had wrenched it from a mummy in the Val-
ley of the Kings. Numerous Diggers of my
acquaintance have been surprised at the aver-
sion manifested by newly-wed spouses to
similar curios. The laboratory of some
scientific pundit near Ypres provided a num-
ber of our men with gruesome relics; I won-
der how many of these have gone the -same
way as the mummified hand at Kurri Kurri.
“Borom”: A war-time job less
spectacular than parachuting from
blazing balloons, but ouite as nerve-
racking,- was held by a small squad of
men at one of the big munition plants
in England. Their work was to test
new types and patterns of gas-masks
before they were issued, the expcrb
mentalists being placed in a largo,
almost hermetically-sealed room, into
which different kinds of toxic gases
Were pumped. Every precaution was
taken to ensure that if a mask failed
in protective quality the wearer could
be got out uuickly; withal at different
times some half-dozen men were killed
by the gases, and others were invalided.
The pay was high, and there was sel-
dom any lack of applicants for the
job. Some cracked up under the
strain, and gave it best, but many
stuck it out for a couple of years.
“Percy Pawnticket”: The car-thief isn’t
always an irresponsible young blackguard
tempted by the chance of a joy-ride, or an
expert motor-faker plying his nefarious trade.
In Melbourne the other day a grey-haired
old gentleman of portentous respectability
was run to earth, a description of him hav-
ing been given to the police by eye-witnesses
01 his exploit, placidly garaging the pur-
loined car at his home. He was a dazed
man when accused of the theft; and then
light and horror suddenly broke upon him.
Walking out of his office he had absent-
mindedly stepped into a car which was
familiar to him because, only a week before,
he had sold it upon purchasing a new con-
veyance. His horror wasn’t entirely due to
the stigma lie had brought on his good name.
More of it came from a disquieting convic-
tion that his own expensive car must have
already disappeared when he came out of
HER MIND'S EASY AT LAST.
“What ye think? I've insured my car for more than it cost me!”
“Hooray, darling! Now I won't need to he always warning you to
drive carefully.”
his office. His fears proved well grounded;
at the time of writing car No. 2 is, in fact,
still missing.

“Old Salt”: Of all the theories advanced
to explain the disappearance of the crew
of the Marie Celeste (B. 9/10/’24) only
one ever struck me as meriting serious at-
tention. When the vessel left New York
she had amongst her crew a gigantic Swede,
nearly seven feet in height, who was the
victim of religious mania, and is known to
have confided to an acquaintance his con-
viction tliat the whole world was unutter-
ably wicked, and that lie had a mission
to put an end to as much of it as possible.
The theory is that in mid-ocean this man
suddenly became a raving lunatic, and threw
overboard everybody on the vessel. The
task would have been easier because the en-
tire company, with the exception of the man
at the wheel, was at breakfast. They
straggled up singly, or by twos and threes,
so that there was no opportunity for a con-
certed rush to overpower the maniac. After-
wards he jumped overboard himself.
“Double Disc” on some crowded minutes:
Re leaps from burning balloons (B. 9/10/’24), T
recall a memorable afternoon in July, ’l7, between
Dickebusch and La Clytte. The actors in the drama
were seven of our sausages, and two of Von Rich-
tefen's “circus.” Through the clouds lying fairly low
over Dickebusch suddenly came a burst of m.-g. fire,
and an aeroplane, painted a bright vermilion, was
seen diving at a kite balloon. The two officers
jumped just before the balloon burst into flame. The
anti-aircraft guns put a box barrage round the next
balloon, but the Hun dodged it, and got close
enough to start his m.-g.’s going. Again we saw
the observers jump, only just in time. By now the
third balloon section had started to pull their
sausage down, and the men in it had jumped, too.
But despite a.-a. and ground m.-g. tire the Hun got
this one as well, and then started full lick for No. 4.
Meanwhile Hun No. 2, which had approached high
enough up to have escaped the notice of the a-a.
men, butted in. The airman soon got his first
sausage, and two more parachutists gave an exhibi-
tion. Tlie attacker went straight on to the next,
and with a quick burst set it on fire. Once again
two men jumped, but this time not quickly enough.
The burning mass as it fell ignited their parachutes,
and they fell about 1200 ft. By this time Hun No. 1
had switched across to the third balloon on the La
Clytte side, as the one he had been threatening had
been reeled down too low for safe attack. Ihe
observers were not taking any risks, and left in the
usual fashion. The two Huns successfully set the
remaining sausage on fire when it was about half-
way down to the ground. There was only one man
on duty in this car, and he jumped quite early in
the proceedings. The aeroplanes then separated and
departed for Germany, all out. As an afterthought
one of them flew up the Vierstraat-road, on which we
were halted, dived, machine-gunned us, and killed
four and wounded 11 of my company. Sausage
strafing afterwards became very popular with our
airmen, but I suspect that six in about as many
minutes must have remained a record for either side.

“Capricorn”: A rather complicated point
arose the other clay in Queensland Assembly-
Minister Gillies said that member Fry hadn t
“the morals of a blaclcfellow’s dog. hry
might simply have replied, “Quite right. 1
haven’t, but you have.” lie might have en-
larged on the topic and said that they were
the only morals Gillies ever had, and that
they suited him admirably, and that he had
stolen them from the dog, and that the ani-
mal was glad to part with them, as it recog-
nised that they were going to congenial sur-
roundings. Instead, he grew hot and inco-
herent. The Speaker ordered Gillies to with-
draw the statement that Fry hadn’t a dog s
morals. Gillies was quite willing to oblige,
and said he had. Then the Speaker ordered
Gillies to withdraw the new assertion that
Fry had a dog’s morals. Gillies said Yes,
lie was quite prepared to go back to his ori-
ginal position and agree with the Speaker
that Fry hadn’t, etc. So the business closed
with no satisfaction for anybody.

“P.F.S.”: Townsliend’s picture of Cohen
receiving no thanks for a slioal of silver-fish
thrown in with a cheap coat (B. 25/9/ 24)
evokes a memory of Philip Heidi and the
shop in Russell-strect, Melbourne, where
ham, beef, gherkins and sauerkraut provided
unfailing attractions for customers. It was
on one of those scorching days when Philip
was incessantly at war with blowflies, and
feather-dusters and other weapons were indus-
triously plied to protect his wares. Presently
an excited customer burst forth from the
luncheon-room brandishing a small plate in
the centre of which a diminutive wriggler

“Fine. I’m not working either.”
was eking out a lonely existence on what
was left of a ham sandwich. “Do you expect
a man to pay for this?” he howled belliger-
ently. “No, no, my boy,” remarked Philip
soothingly. “I wouldn’t think of charging
you for the leetle worm.”

A BALLADE OP ‘BAGGINESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“This season’s frocks appear to aim at a certain
6hapely shapelessness, with the waist-li,ne more
indefinable than ever.”
Phyllis, a deal of change we’ve seen
In your seductive sex’s dress
Since you were rising seventeen
And I was twenty, more or less.
Your latest mode did not impress
At first. Once more I judged in haste.
It thrills—your shapely shapelessness ;
It piques— your quite uncharted waist.
Your grandma swam in crinoline
(Thank God, that’s gone into recess!) ;
Your dad, I’ll bet, with rapture keen
Was wont an hour-glass form to press.
E’en bustles, carried to excess,
Jarred not on, his aesthetic taste.
Give me your comely shapelessness,
Your utterly elusive waist.
So gd your changing ways serene.
You know, you witch, you’d prepossess
In nothing but a gabardine ;
And 1 shall always acquiesce
In your caprice, nor care, I guess,
Whether in clinging clothes you're cased
Or robes that screen your shapeliness
And make a riddle of your waist.
Envoy.
Phyllis, the rig of good Queen Bess
Around your scrumptious contours placed
Would lose for me its shapelessness.
But —where the dickens is your waist ?

The theatre doors pour out into the night
A rush of black and rainbow vestured forms
Who shiver as the wind of winter storms
A rough farewell under the arc-lamps white.
From, the rock garden, dark, mysterious,
A brave bush throws a challenge in the air,
A gush of wildwood fragrances, from fair
Clusters of waxen blossoms pendulous.
It flings, through smell of petrol and cigars
And essences from Paris rank of gold,
Honey and almonds and the salt sea cold,
As clean, as maddening, as the breath of stars.
So, sharply, through the restless revelling,
Across the noise and dust and headlights’ gleam,
Clashes its sweetness, like a silver scream
Of laughter from that pure-eyed wanton, Spring.

“Mary Scott”: A representative of the
International Bible Students’ Society, who
recently invaded North Queensland with an
American accent and the exciting news that
“millions now living will never die,” gained
at least a partial convert at Mackay. The
intrepid speaker was disposing nonchalantly
of those amazing zoological specimens which
prowl through the Book of Revelation, track-
ing each one remorselessly to its lair and
pinning a label to its tail. “All of which
makes it clear,” he proceeded, “that the
Beast in this instance symbolises Govern-
ment. There is no possibility of urrer. Gov-
ernment is the Beast.” “Too right, mister,”
assented one of his audience —“a fair cow,
ain’t it?”

“Sixenate” : Some lost property traced to
a Melbourne woman whose reputation in
other ways was excellent has led to the
discovery of a remarkable way of doing a
little on the side. Advertising the loss of
“a purse containing money,” she. received
three such articles, and regarding it as evi-
dence of the confiding nature of some finders
of lost property, she promptly decided on
further appeals for the return of imaginary
lost goods. She was apparently unaware
that there is such an offence as “stealing
by finding” until, deciding to pawn a ring
which had come to her as a result of her
latest ad.,, she collided with the police.
Her experience shows that many honest
finders of lost goods are ready to pass them
over to the first advertiser who gives an
approximate description of the articles, tak-
ing the mere announcement of the loss as
all the evidence of good faith necessary.
In this case, tears, vehement disclaimers of
any criminal intention and the restitution of
a considerable amount of property led the
Law to take a lenient view of a novel fraud.

“X.N.0.”: “F.N.W.’s” statement (B.
9/10/’24) that no skipper can perform a
marriage ceremony outside the three-mile
limit is too wide. Different countries, dif-
ferent marriage laws; a blacksmith at Gretna
Green can still tie the necessary knot, and I
think Uncle Sam does allow its ships’ cap-
tains to splice couples outside territorial
waters. Apropos, a story still lingers in the
British Navy of what once happened when
a death occurred on a ship in the outer seas.
The skipner and the padre were sworn

enemies, and the former announced that the
funeral would take place on an adjacent
desert island the next Tifternoon. “I’m
afraid that’s impossible,” said his reverence
—“there’s no consecrated ground there.”
“Very well,” said the Old Man, “you go
ashore in the morning and consecrate some.”
“Only a bishop can do that,” was the reply;
“you’ll have to bury the corpse at sea.”
But the skipper wasn't beaten. After consult-
ing the King’s Regulations he announced
that he could find nothing to prevent him, as
the re, resentative of the Sovereign, the head
of the Church of England, from making the
chaplain an acting-bishop. This he forth-
with proceeded to do, and the consecration
and the funeral duly took place.
THEY’RE BROADCASTING NOW.
SHE: “How do you find marriage, Tony?”
TONY : “Well, during the honeymoon I talked and she listened. Then for six months
she talked and I listened. Now we both talk and the neighbors listen.”
“Jae”: “F.N.W.” asserts (B. 9/10/’24)
that it is illegal for ships’ captains to per-
form the marriage ceremony. Although the
Merchant Shipping Act is mute on this point,
the shipmaster is appointed Registrar of
Births, Marriages and Deaths, and Benedict
W. Ginsburg, M.A., LL.D., in liis book, “The
Legal Duties of Shipmasters,” claims that
there would be occasions on a long sea voy-
age with no parson on board when the skip-
per would be within his rights in uniting a
couple in matrimony. The contract would be
made as if before a registrar ashore.
There arc penalties for unqualified persons
performing marriages, but the writer is satis-
fied that, should the occasion warrant, a
shipmaster may perform the ceremony. An-
other writer on marriage law thinks that
the Legislature must have contemplated mar-
riages at sea by other than a minister of
religion when it laid it down that a master
must log the event.

“Melos”: The schoolma’am at Pintpot
Creek gave the third-class scholars the fol-
lowing sum for home work: “If 50 cows give
1137 gallons of milk in one year, how many
gallons will 37 cows given in 100 days?”
Next day she received a note from Willie
Hayseed’s father: “Der Mis Thar ain’t no
use ter give Billy that sum becos gome cows
giv’ only a pint or so of milk an’ others
fill th’ buckit. Yer wanter tell th’ kinder

Galleryite”: The allegation made before
the Vic. Elections and Qualifications Com-
mittee that the dead voted numerously at
Ballarat East recalls the comment of a
Bryan O’Loghlen supporter when a similar
accusation was published after the baronet’s
victory in West
Melbourne. Said
the enthusiast for
Bryan: “Min came

“Foxleaze”: Twenty years ago there was
a magistrate in one of W.A.’s northern sea-
ports, a Groper of the old hard-shell type,
who had been there so long that one of his
detractors, criticising in Parliament some
allegedly out-of-date legal decisions, mourn-
fully asked what better could be expected of
a man who had “never seen a railway.” I
have an idea the assailed Beak managed to
clear himself of the aspersion; but no doubt
there are many people in the Commonwealth
who wouldn’t be able to. Yet there must be
far more in the densely inhabited British
Isles, startling as the idea may seem. A
London paper chronicled last month the
arrival at Wembley of a crowd from Guern-
sey ; the majority had never previously been
out of the Channel Islands, and at least 50
had never been on a railway till the pre-
ceding day. And think of all the Scottish
islands where the stay-at-homes have been
similarly handicapped—or blessed ! Even
leaving out islanders, it is probable that
people could be found in the U.K., particu-
larly in Wales, who never heard the glad
shriek of a loco, or a porter’s resonant assur-
ance of “Right behind!”
* * * #
“Delver”: Mention of Josiah Wedgwood,
M.P., and his potter ancestor (B.
9/'lO/’24) calls to mind a faint connection of
the family with our earliest records. About
the first volume published after the settle-
ment was formed at Sydney Cove was John
Stockdale’s “The Voyage of Governor Phillip
to Botany Bay.” The date of the book is
1789, and it contains a complete roll of the
colony. It tells from whence individuals
came and, in the case of exiles, their allotted
periods of transportation. On the title-page
is a vignette, of which the following descrip-
tion appears: “The elegant vignette in the
title-page was engraved from a medallion
which the ingenious Mr. Wedgwood caused
to be modelled from a small piece of clay
brought from Sydney Cove. The clay proves
to be of a fine texture, and will be found
very useful for the manufacture of earthen-
ware.” The design is allegorical, and repre-
sents Hope encouraging Art and Labor under
the influence of Peace; the sculptor Mul-
lane was responsible for it.

“Machete”: “Ex-Warder’s” comment on
the last awakening of condemned men and
the usually painful realisation of their posi-
tion may re-awaken the old controversy as
to the respective merits of the English and
French systems. The first tells a condemned
man the exact date and hour of his death,
and leaves him to tick off every intervening
minute. The second gives no information
save that the death penalty is to be enforced.
One morning early the condemned man is
awakened with the formula, “My friend, take
courage.” He is usually dead in a few
minutes. Which is the better method—to
watch Death walking up to one, or to live
in hourly terror of his sudden appearance?
1 can’t make up my mind.
“Uramao”: One of the Maoriland Costs
Brigade lately had a small boy in the witness-
box whom he was trying to trip up. The case
had been adjourned from a previous sitting,
and the cross-examining counsel glared over
his spectacles as the boy replied to a ques-
tion that 30 seconds had elapsed between cer-
tain events. “Come, now—-can you swear
you said 30 seconds on the previous occa-
sion?” The boy replied that he hadn't.
“Well, perhaps you can tell us what you did
say?” rasped out counsel, with a side look
at the Judge. “I said ‘half a minute’ that
time,” was the bland reply.
“Blanc”: Re deadly shots (B. 2/10/’241.
One machine-gun burst killed 33 of the
Durham Light Infantry who were assisting
in the recapture ‘of Villers-Bretonneux.
When death came they were lining the bank
of the road leading into Villers Bret, from
Fouilloy. Only one man seemed to have
been able to move after that devastating dis-
charge ; his body was lying about three yards
out of the line of the other 32. The Bosche
machine-gunner in his thoroughness had
absolutely honeycombed the bank. When
we found his own body lying against his gun
in a garden hedge 100 yards away, we gave
it honorable burial.

“Two' Up” : If equine combatants are in-
cluded, one bomb dropped in Palestine had
a particularly grim record. During the offen-
sive in November and December, 1917, our
brigade was holding the line in front of
FI Burg, in the Judean hills, and the horses
were sent back to Ludd. One bright night
a Hun. ’plane, flying very low, paid the
horse-lines a visit and dropped a “pill” be-
tween the horse and bivvy lines. Result:
60 horses killed and wounded, mostly killed,
and 25 casualties amongst the troops.

“Clipper”: A long-standing municipal
feud came to a head the other week when
the Newcastle City Council cut off the neigh-
boring Carrington’s electric current for street
lighting and plunged the obstreperous coal-
lumpers’ stronghold into darkness. Carring-
ton Bqsin and the Dyke are a coaling ren-
dezvous for overseas tramps and countless
coasters, and the -population is largely tinged
with coaldust. A contract entered into some
ten years ago with Newcastle for the supply
of electric light recently ran its course, and
a higher rate was demanded to meet higher
costs. Carrington flatly refused to pay more
than the pre-war rates, and duly received
notice of Newcastle’s intention to cut off its
luminant. The threat was treated as a bluff
LOGIC.
“You can't spend money, my dear, and have
it too.”
“But don’t you sec, Harry, darling, unless
you spend it nobody will know you
have it!”
until darkness actually descended on the
obstinate suburb. Like most wliarfside com-
munities, Carrington boasts some tough citi-
zens, to say nothing of visitors of all national-
ities ; wherefore residents who are in posses-
sion of portable property are calling for
extra police protection against the terror
that walks by night.

If it were the practice for directors, and
especially bank directors, to talk plain Eng-
lish, that procession of steadily-mounting
profits might lead the Board of the Royal
to say something like this: —
(lentlemen, —As far as we know, we are doing better
each half-year. We should probably surprise you if
we told you how much profit we really think we
made last half. But we don’t know for certain.
Some of the business that people thought was
wonderfully good in the ’eighties was discovered in
the ’nineties to have been astonishingly bad. Things
are not quite the same now as they were in the
'eighties, but there are some points of resemblance.
For instance, the State debt of Victoria has doubled
in the past dozen years, and that’s a pretty large
performance seeing that the Commonwealth has also
been a heavy borrower. It was the sudden stoppage
of borrowings that caused the trouble in the ’nineties ;
and there is going to be a nasty jar when the
present borrowings stop. The bump would have
been felt before now only the good old jumbuek
has stuck to us amazingly, and so much real money
lias poured in on us that we haven’t been jazzing
entirely on a boom bubble: there has been a lot of
solid substance under our feet. Still, there is a
bubble there, too, and the time must come when
some of the surface will fall in. We don’t want
you to be hurt; so, while we are making out that
each half-year’s profits are a few pounds better than
those of the period just behind it, actually we are
providing solidly for contingencies.
The balance-sheet figures don’t suggest that
there have been any recent movements of
much consequence:—

Twins could hardly be more alike than the
figures for those last two years. There is
a very keen demand for money; but plainly
this bank felt a year ago that it had gone
just about as far as it could. Still its posi-
tion is quite solid: it has over _ 38 p.c. of
all its liabilities liquid. What it has pro-
bably done has been to swap second-class for
first-class securities —the long run of pros-
perity (thanks again to my Lord the
Merino) has given the banks a fine oppor-
tunity to do this. No doubt the Royal
would have been very glad to get hold of
more fixed-deposit money; and it could really
offer rather exceptional security. It owes
less than £4 for every £1 of its own funds:
and, besides, there are 270,000 £4 shares paid
up to only £1; and as the shares are well
held there is a big guarantee fund for deposi-
tors there. Holders of these pound-paid
shares look at it in another way, of course:
they are hoping for the time when the direc-
tors will call up some or all of the £3 and
pay 10 p.c. on it; and there is such a large
lay-by that it looks as though there will
be no difficulty about paying the 10 p.c.
div. when the directors do decide to invite
more share capital into the business.
My Lord the Merino has really been re-
sponsible for putting the cap on the exchange
difficulty which has been giving the papers
columns to write about- —mostly making the
difficulty look more difficult. As a rule, Aus-
tralia exports just about enough to pay
for its imports. When it had a surplus it
used (sometimes) to get it in gold. But
John Bull will no longer allow gold to go
out. Partly on that account and partly
because we have been borrowing hard, money
began to pile up to our credit in London.
If we left off borrowing abroad the situation
would soon right itself: the money would
ho absorbed to pay either for imports or
our interest bill. But, while we were still
borrowing, along came this great "wool clip
at phenomenal prices, and with it the promise
of exceptional wheat and sugar crops. \\ e
were thus like a person who had had an
unusually rich feed and couldn’t digest it
without a dose of pepsine and bismuth. The
new Commonwealth Bank Board last iveek
made up the prescription. The banks’ re-
sources are to be pooled (that is really
because some of them haven’t done their
fair share of a national job), arid to the
extent to which they now do their job they
will be supported by the Commonwealth Bank,
exercising the functions of the Notes Board.
There will be no inflation in the strict
sense. Smith, the wool-buyer, will get the
money from, say, the Commercial Bank to
pay the wool-grower. Smith will repay the
Commercial in London. The wool-grower’s
money will presently get into the hands of
the retailer and the wholesaler, who will
want to pay for goods in London. The
wholesaler will hand his money to the Com-
mercial Bank here, and the bank, having
money in London, will pay the wholesaler’s
bill with it there. The bank will thus have
money in its hands here with which to repay
the Commonwealth Bank—in other words, it
will hand back the notes issued to it to do
the special job that now has to be done*
The scheme arrived at will enable the banks
to finance the wool clip and the harvest
without malting it necessary to curtail its
advances. And it also has the advantage of
making some of the banks do something more
like a fair thing; at any rate, they won’t
reap a great advantage through not doing
a fair thing, as one or two of them have
done hitherto.

Following a rumor that the co. intended to
increase its coal interests there was som i
active buying recently. Certainly the liquid
assets are sufficient to permit of substantial
purchases, there being over £300,000 in Com-
monwealth loans alone. On the year the
co.. as usual, shows little more profit than
is necessary to pay the div., which remains
at 71 p.c. But the declared profits and the
actual profits are probably very different
things. For years the “Wild Cat” insisted
on dragging certain items into the profit
column, and the 1920 re-construction showed
that the dragging was right so far as it
went. Even including the reserved profits
which the co. hadn’t called profits, the
reserves in that year were only £561,195;
yet £1,550,090 of bonus scrip was issued.
Allowing for a certain amount of profit won
in the few months nrior to the reconstruc-
tion. at least £950.000 was provided from
hidden sources. There is little doubt that
now, as then, more than ample depreciation
is provided for, and that the insurance fund
and the amounts set apart for repairs, re-
newals and replacemeftts are merely stores
of accumulated earnings. And as such they
are treated in the introductory table. The
div. rate is not very attractive; neverthe-
less, the market, with the past in mind and
an eye on possibilities, considers the scrip
worth a sliqde above par. The developments
of the past year in connection with the inter-
state trade have strengthened the position
of this and other associated cos.j the rate-
cutting line outside the association having
once more gone to the wall. Still, the com-
petition is not dead, as lots of people expected
it would be after a third failure. What has
to be remembered is that in a case of this
kind it may pay people to lose money. A
shipper who has to pay out £5OOO a year in
inter-State freights will obviously save £5OO
a year if he can do anything to bring about
a 10 p.c. reduction; so it will pay him hand-
somely to contribute £250 to the capital of
a co. which will procure the reduction. He
may not send a ton of cargo by the new line;
he may let the poor infant die at the end of
the year. But he will still be £250 better
off than if the infant had never been born.
The investor in the inter-State co. will have
to take into account the possibility of per-
sistent attacks of this nature; and they are
all the more probable because for one reason
and another the inter-State shipping cos.
are not very popular institutions.
But they can afford a few knocks. On the
whole, the law has been extraordinarily good
to them. It is true that, through its agents,
it has prescribed rates of pay and menus
which make the services the best paid and
treated in the world ; but it has at the same
time made coastwise shipping a close pre-
serve for this handful of cos., and, while
there is cohesion among them, the public
pays. As a result, though this co. is giving
its shareholders about four times more than
they got before the war, profits are so large
that the shipbuilding programme has scarcely
bitten into liquid assets. The movement in
two years has been :
1922. 1923. 1924.

Yet recently the Arcoona and the Allara have
been added to the fleet—749o tons between
them—while the Kadina and Cantara have
been sold —6347 tons they were. And pro-
bably some payments have been made on
account of another 5000-tonner, the Ulooloo,
now building. The idea is to gradually adapt
the co.’s fleet to the new conditions; that is
to say, to introduce ships that won’t cost
so much to run. That the co. has been able
to pay its 74 p.c. and proceed so far with
the remodelling of its fleet without cutting
deep into its funds gives a hint of what may
be possible when only ordinary renewals and
replacements have to be provided for.

There have been better years; still, the pro-
fits show a fraction over 10 p.c. on the capi-
tal, and there are a lot of worse things than
that. Onlv in one year, when the season had
been desperately bad in Victoria’s west and
north-west, has the co. failed to earn its 7
p.c. Every year since then has made the
job easier; for the least that has been laid
by out of profits in any 12 months is £lOOO,
and the average for the nine years is little
short of £5OOO. Eighteen months more at
that rate should see the whole of the capital
represented by tangible assets. But the
co. labors under the great curse of Australia
—the curse of Centralisation. Heaven knows
what would have liapened to Melbourne by
this time if men like Dennys and Lascelles
hadn’t pushed out into the back country. It
was their faith in the Malice which led to
the settlement of that country by farmers
at a time when most people regarded it as
waste land of the most hopeless sort. But
all that makes no difference. The man who
goes pioneering may save the pig; but the
man who stays in the city expects to get the
bacon, • and generally he manages to do it.
So there has been no great development in
this co.’s business. Even the big rise in
prices (and therefore in commission earn-
ings) lias not had much effect on the gross
earnings:—

With a view no doubt to spread the co.’s
risks the co. lately entered into an agree-
ment with Henry Wills and Co., of Perth,
Albany and Fremantle, and a subsidiary
co. has been formed to carry on a wool-
selling business. For the Albany sales the
new co. has promises of over 8000 bales. It
looks like a good move. The co. needs more
scope, and Westralia is the State where com-
petition in this line seems least keen.

Freeholds now run to £88,317. The Geelong
stores have been added to lately: hence the
spring in the figures. All the freeholds (in-
cluding stores) are in at cost. No doubt
they have been getting more valuable, and
the “Wild Cat” doesn’t mind seeing them
figure “at cost.’-’ All the same, it is just
as well to remember that even the best of
warehouses is not eternal. For the rest, lia-
bilities are a bit heavier; but this extra
money is represented- by book debts —really,
no doubt, advances—and they ought to be
sound enough. There is nothing at all wrong
with the finances, and there is nothing bril-
liant about the outlook.

This year’s profits so exactly permits of tlie
wiping out of the deficit which represents
intangibles that it is reasonable to assume
that the figures don’t represent the true total.
Perdriau’s have done wonderfully well —they
even paid 5 p.c. in the slump year—and it
is likely that an unknown amount has been
written off which will be produced when
necessary. The balance sheet and report
never did waste many words, but it is less
communicative than usual. Last year
£54,849 of reserves was capitalised and some
additional ordinary shares were issued for
cash. The bonus capital came mainly from
the “machinery plant, furniture, fittings and
vehicle reserve,” thus confirming a long-held
suspicion that that was a store of accumu-
lated profit. This particular reserve does not
figure in the latest accounts, but it may
merely have been rendered invisible: that
could easily be done by writing something off
any of the assets. As the balance sheet
stands, the only visible repository for stored-
up profit is the general reserve which con-
tains the bare amount necessary to offset the
figure representing goodwill. The item might
just as well be got rid of.
Balance-sheet movements running back to
a pre-war comparison show the extent of the
co.’s expansion :

Notable in the movements on the year is the
heavy increase in stock, amounting to
£127,654, or 46 p.c. The co. certainly is
backing the market. Sundry creditors re-
flect that increase in an expansion of almost
the same amount. As mentioned, the balance-
sheet does not disclose a penny of visible re-
serves to support the £700,000-odd of capital,
which in view of the conservatism that has
marked the management of the concern from
its inception, prompts the suspicion that
assets may have been written down more
than is necessaray.

just about earned, but little or nothing has
been left over. Taking into account the

The interest earnings have, as in the previous

average amount of advances; but the out-
goings have almost throughout been a frac-
tion higher—management alone shows a
small cut; taxation is considerably more.
The society is an old-established one—a re-
construction. of course—and has a very solid
Board to look after its affairs. Its deposits
(and therefore its risks) are comparatively
small; for every £3 of its own money at
risk it has only £1 of the public’s. Taking
that into account it makes very good profits ;
and it can hardly expect to make much more
without increasing its risks; and that means
winning more deposits.

At the St. Ives Reward meeting the infor-
mation was brought out that, in the dreary
waste since Hampton Plains boomed, the
co. has got through £45.000, of which £23.000
represents calls. It needs a live-wire opti-
mist to sustain interest in the face of the
disappearance of that amount. However,
the shaft is down 393 ft. and 1000 ft. of cross-
cuts. drives and rises have been put in. The
Blue lode is to be the bonanza, and a race
for divs. is the next item on the programme.
No one can deny that the terms on which the
original float went through meant a tough
job to keep going, but the Board and secre-
tary were stickers and supplied half the
monthly calls. As well as lending £3OOO of
their good money, they guaranteed the bank
overdraft. A management like that deserves
to win.
* * * *
Stone and mixture were the assets exposed
in the Daylesford Ophir shaft from 150 ft.
to 170 ft., so at 200 ft. the co. went on the
hunt for gold. The lode ran up to 6ft.. but
shows the influence of heavy faulting. Rises
to the intermediate level at 133 ft. have ex-
plored the formation, which is said to carry
up to 6ft. of pay dirt. Accordingly a battery
is on the way, for it does not take much to
move Daylesford to ’phone the machinery
man. One could better judge whether the
stamps should rattle if one had a statement
of ore reserves and their values.

There is not likely to be any news from
Orallo (Q.) for several months. The No. 2
bore is on the way down, but time must
elapse before they get to the sand which gave
qn oil showing in No. 1. The Californian geo-
logist. R. E, Allan, is non-committal, the
conditions being so unlike those on the other
side of the Pacific; but he considers the data
of No. 1 bore justifies a further test in the
locality. The broken tool in No. 1 adds to
the suspicions of those who thought that
someone' not entirely removed from the Oil
Trust “settled” the Government bore at
Roma a few years back when it looked like
getting 011 to something.

The Queensland gold yield for September
was 10.1220 z. fine, valued at £42 995. as
compared with 75530 z. fine and £32,083 for
September, 1923. This helps to put the
year’s yield 93360 z. ahead of 1923. Mt.
Morgan’s contribution was 79140 z. ; Gympie
is a bad runnel-up with 10370 z., mostly
from the No. 4 North Phoenix. Coolon
doesn’t figure in the list, but Ravenswood
gave 7910 z. The figures for the State,
although showing an increase, are none too
healthy, for without Mt. Morgan there is
practically no advance.

The coal prospecting at One Mile. West
Ipswich (Q.), mentioned in the “Wild Cat”
a few weeks back, has advanced a further
stage. Another bore has been sunk to 200 ft.
and passed through a seam 21ft. thick, of
which 12ft. is stated to be of workable
quality. It is , considered proved that this
is the Aberdare seam. the. mainstay of the
Ipswich field; if so its location for the first
time on the west side of the big West Ips-
wich fault is of considerable importance to
the field. The cpal is dipping at one in six;
but .‘is it is located near a disturbed area,
the surrounding country should be tested.
On the result of operations to date a co. is
likely to be formed immediately.

“Fair Deal”: For indefiniteness a para-
graph from a recent report by Mr. Saint
Smith to the directors of the Mt. Isa Mines,
Ltd., is worth comment. First comes a list
of the ore bodies, in order, which will “in
all probability furnish the bulk of the ton-
nage of pay ore won in the future.” Then :
“The whole future of Mt. Isa as a possible
great producer of silver-lead ore in a very
great measure will be governed by the re-
sults obtained from the extensive prospect-
ing operations now in progress.” There is no-
thing definite in this statement, but the infer-
ence—which is definite enough—that “great”
silver-lead ore bodies have not yet been
proved. The terms “bulk of tonnage” and
"great producer” suggest a desire to make
the best of things, and it is cheering to know
that the prospecting operations in progress
may prove a mine—presumably they were
undertaken with that object. Plans and
measurements are necessary to describe
mines adequately, and put shareholders some-
what oii a level with directors in the know-
ledge of developments. The sooner proper
plans and estimates, checked and audited
by competent persons, are ihsisted on by Act
of Parliament the sooner will people feel
that they are getting a fair deal when in-
vesting in mining shares. Such a condition
would make large sums available for develop-
ment and prospecting, and lead to prosperity
in the mining world. The early bullish re-
ports on Mt. Isa and later market move-
ments indicate heavy losses by outsiders,
and have probably resulted in choking off
for ever some potentially good supporters of
mining. A’ague reports don’t lessen the
harm done.

The old Pioneer mine in the Morinish
(C.Q.) district is likely to be re-opened—
a co. is on the stocks. This was one of the
first finds to be worked at Morinish. well
over 50 years ago; it and the Alliance and
Kennedy reefs were applied for at about the
same time. All average of 2Aoz. to the ton
was obtained, but both treatment costs and
the distance from a railway were too great,
and so it was abandoned. The hollow in
which the Pioneer and other mines are situ-
ated is called Moonlight Gully; gold was
struck at sunset, and claims were pegged out
and worked all through the brilliant moon-
lit night. .Tames Drain, one of the first
men on the field, is still alive at Yeppoon.
The timbering in the Pioneer is reported to
be still sound; but the mining inspector must
have a word to say about that.

At the annual meeting shareholders in the
Billy Hughes. Normanby (Q.). were asked
to take up 25,000 5 p.c. second prefs. Mmc-
manager Tom Harley says there is a good
shoot of stone in the s.-e. end of the Resur-
gam mine at the 50ft. level, and that this
drive should be continued. General-manager
Meredith wants a steam winding plant and
pump to enable him to complete the Resur-
gam shaft from 71 to 100 feet, at which
point he intends driving levels on the sul-
phide ore body, which has made its appear-
ance at 71ft. He reports that ho can raise
a couple of small crusliings while the shaft
is being sunk. Two test crusliings have been
put through from the Resurgam; 25 tons
from the sinking of the shaft and opening up
of the 50ft. level gave 220 z. free gold, 1 ton
concentrates value 70z., and sands worth 445.
per ton; and 10 tons from the level and
stopes returned 30oz. free gold, 4ewt. con-
centrates (14|oz. to the ton) and 25dwt.
sands. The opening up of the sulphide ores
is expected to put the mine on to a profit-
earning basis.

“Shareholder” on Queensland State mines:
Before I accept Randolph Bedford’s bald statement
that the Queensland State collieries are paying, I
would like to see the balance-sheets. The cutting
of coal-costs at Townsville is in a very slight degree
due to lower working costs at Bowen. It is mainly
a saving in freight from Newcastle. Bowen is natu-
rally the cheapest seam in the State to work, except
Blair Athol, but it doesn't strike me that they are
working anything cheaper than Is. a ton below the
smaller and costlier seams in parts of the Burrum
—notwithstanding the greed of us! Mr. Bedford
doubtless knows that the Bowen State miners will
see to it that there is no repetition of the £5OOO
profit to which Minister Alf .Tones proudly pointed
a couple of years ago. Styx certainly isn’t paying,
but that is Mother Nature’s fault. And 1 can't
agree with his earlier statement that Baralaba and
Styx are better than Blair Athol coal. He may-
pose as an authority on calorific values, but labora-
tory tests on a limited scale are of small value.
Some Styx and some Baralaba are equal, or better,
but for run-of-mine coal Blair Athol heads the
bunch. If in doubt, ask the locos, on the Central
railways.

The Malta Oil Co. has been formed to
prospect for oil at Malta, Tambo district
(C.Q.). Two years ago Dr. .Tensen reported
on a slight oil seepage in tin' district, and
interest has never quite died down. He lias
just reported on this latest effort, and stated
that he has nowhere seen better indications
in a shallow bore in the State. This may not
mean much, since there are no known sur-
face manifestations of oil. Certainly the
£2OOO or £3OOO recommended for testing the
area won’t go far unless the oil is close to
the grass roots.
* * * *
Some years ago a Sydney syndicate spent
a lot of money boring on the east coast of
Timor without success. The probable rea-
son for the non-success is given by Dr.
Wade, who has just reported on seven pro-
perties owned by a Melbourne syndi-
cate. No deep boring will be necessary
in the coastal region, and all evidences of
oil will be obtained within the limits of
1000 ft. of drilling at Meta-llou. Wade,
writes: “Supporting this conclusion is the
fact that every hole put down in this coas-
tal strip has yielded oil almost from the
first breaking of the surface cover, and a
considerable quantity seems to be present.”
Again, “I am of opinion that the oil in
Timor originates in the limestone series.
The oil finds its way to the surface, and
either oozes out in seepages or impregnates
porous beds above.” When oil is found
widely spread in seepages this generally is
strong evidence that it has escaped through
fissures in the strata from the original oil-
sands or pools below. To practical oilmen,
surface pools of petroleum always look sus-
picious, and they rarely drill near a seepage,
lint seek an undisturbed area further away.
There is probably far too much oil on the
surface in these Timor areas, and far too
little deep down below. A borehole to
1000 ft. will, however, do no harm, and may
pierce impervious rocks covering a second
oilsaml underneath the source of the sur-
face oil.

Premier Lyons called in conference re-
cently a number of holders of oil shale areas
in Tasmania to discuss a scheme for joint
action in developing the shale oil industry.
Tasmania is in precisely the same fix as
the United States about its shale areas. In
both places plenty of oil-bearing rock
awaits the right process of retorting or
treating it. An informative bulletin has just
arrived from the Bureau of Mines at Wash-
ington (U.S.A.), being a historical, techni-
cal and economic study of shale by Martin
J. Garvin. In a survey of retorting he de-
clares that the rich shale of Colorado and
Nevada when heated rapidly intumesces and
adheres to the walls of the retort, stopping
operations. For this reason the Scottish
retort seems to have failed completely,
though Garvin believes it would succeed if
tlie shales were heated slowly. The chapter
on the history of the industry in Australia
states that the yield of tin* richest Hartley
(N.S.W.) shale in horizontal retorts with-
out steam was 130 to 170 gallons to the
ton. The Scottish retorts have proved un-
suitable for the higher-grade shales of the
Wolgan-Capertee (N.S.W.) seam, which
yield 04 to 12<S gallons to the ton, compared
with about 25 gallons from Scottish shales.
The American shales run as high as 00
gallons. The conclusions of the author are
that with the exhaustion of petroleum in
the United States, an oil-shale industry
must be built up, but that it will be evolved
only at great expense. To produce
700,000,000 barrels of crude oil, which is
the present domestic output of petroleum,
700,000,000 tons of shale would have to be
mined and live thousand -million dollars
speiit upon retorts and refineries. Of prime
importance is to find a cheap and effective
process of retorting.

Three spots and four splodges of green
in a map of north-west Borneo show where
R. M. Boyd found seepages of oil for the
Bux Syndicate and where his concessions lie.
Now comes the prospectus of a £250,000 co.
in 10s. shares from M. I. Murchie, the Bux
legal manager. There isn’t much in it be-
yond what Boyd and geologist Lyne have
already told. The new issue is 100,000 shares
of 10s. each and 112.500 shares go to Bux ;
but of these latter 02,500 are to be passed to
Boyd for his work in “the East.” The
opinion is emphasised that the title problem
has got beyond the worrying stage. Anyhow,
once 50,000 shares arc placed at Is. applica-
tion. Is. allotment, funds will be available
to. ship Boyd back to the East Indies to
finalise matters.

A circular to holders of the 700 £6 shares
in Eastern Gold, N.L., Siam, put off in Syd-
ney six months ago, states: —
R. L. Miles, the co.’s representative in Malaya,
cables that at Thomo, Southern Siam, No. 1 reef lias
been cut at 283ft. in No. 1 tunnel. It is about
22 inches wide, 9oz. gold, average value from
wall to wall. The reef contains' free gold and is
well mineralised, and gold is visible in the stone.
They are now driving both ways on the reef. An-
other reef 30 inches wide has been cut; present
value loz. IGdwt., improving.
Miles advised that A. P. Penman, consult-
ing engineer to the co., should be despatched
forthwith to Siam to sample and report on
the property, which embraces 520 square
miles, according to the prospectus. .Mel-
bourne floated Thomo options in 1922, and
Collins-street made some commissions out of
them; but that was all. Sydney may have
better luck.

One of these days some crushing or sluic-
ing plant on a Sydney-controlled show will
start operations according to schedule. Usu-
ally a definite date is announced, and buyers
come in for scrip as the time approaches, '
which demand pushes shares to a premium. ,
At this stage there is some heavy selling, .
after which something generally is said about
“unforeseen circumstances.” The latest offen-
der is Takuapa Valley Tin Co., in Western
Siam. Official bulletins fixed the start of 1
the dredge for October, and shares moved to
25s.—a premium of 3s. on that fraction of
tin 300,000 shares which accepted it. At
this stage a well-known bear operator put
out 10,000 in a day, and continued the busi-
ness on other days. But he wasn't bearing.
He had the scrip. Their prompt delivery
played havoc with the weakening market.
Then came the official intimation that a
flood in the Takuapa River had so delayed
construction that the dredge could not be
placed in commission before December. Buy-
ers in the region of 23s. had paid 2s. too !
much; for prices drifted back immediately
the flutter was over.
* * * *
Boro Silver-Lead Development Co., near
Tarago (N.S.W.), has struck trouble. For
over 20 years the show was worked by
Robert Sands as a hobby. Early this year
C. II. Kerry got off a small co.' in 500 £5
shares, and secured the co-operation of
Aubrey Bartlett, who has done so well at
Colon Peaks, Yerranderie. The fortnight
estimated for unwatering the shaft to 275ft.
ran into three months. When attempts were
made to locate the sulphide Zone it was
found that running ground constituted an
obstacle which increased as the level was
probed. Funds having been exhausted, more
will be needed to bore on the other side of
the lode in the hope that sound country may
exist there.
The discovery of a workable seam of
coal within reasonable distarice of the rail-
way would represent more to the Northern
Territory at the present time than all the
gold and silver-lead shows which thus far
have been worked. The naval base at Bynoe
Harbor, the meatworks and the railway need
coal. Present supplies are expensive, be-
cause of the freight from the South. Kero-
sene shale of good quality was found at
Cape Wilberforce nearly 20 years ago, but
no attempt has since been made seriously
to explore or test that area. Carbonaceous
shale has been found in the vicinity of the
Macarthur River, and coal is known to exist
in the country between the Daly and the
Victoria rivers, for the bores at Anson Bay
passed through seams of 6, S and 10 inches.
But as this is a Northern Territory matter,
tin' present Government, following the policy
laid down by its predecessors, is likely to
do nothing at any moment.

Departed N.S.W. Labor Premiers John
Storey and Jim McGowen were joined by
a felloAV-boilermaker when Senator Allan
McDougall passed out, at 6S, in a Darling-
hurst private hospital last Aveek. A Pyr-
mont native, McDougall made his boilers
at Mort’s Dock, Sydney. At different times
president and secretary of the Boiler-
makers’ Union, he marched in the Eight-
Hour celebrations this year for the 50th
time. He Avas returned as Senator for N. S.
Wales in 1910 and 1914, Avas defeated in
1919 and elected again in 1922. A keen
sportsman, even on election nights he pre-
ferred firing the starter’s gun at a sports
meeting to hanging about headquarters Avail-
ing for poll returns. He was one of the
best-liked men in the Labor movement, and
always kept away from the paltry squabbles
that mark the domestic life of the A.L.P.
Repartee was not Allan McDougall’s long
suit, but he scored on one occasion. An in-
terjector at one of his meetings on the
N.S.W. South Coast remarked that the Sal-
vation Army in rescuing derelicts from the
gutter did more than Labor. “If Labor is
retunied,” snapped the Senator, “the gutter
Avill be removed.”
If records were kept of the time actually
spent in the gas chamber, the highest tally
of attendances in the Reps Avould probably
go to East Sydney’s honest J. E. West,
although he, Brennan and Matthews
(Labor), Corser (Nat.) and Page had only
325 sitting days. Seeing that Matthews is
a sick man avlio frequently has to be assisted
into the Chamber, his record is fine. Bruce
Mackay (Q.) and Manning (N.S.W.), both
Nationalists, and Forde (Q.), a Labor man,
attended the whole 329 days of the session.
McDonald, the Queensland Laborite, had
the fewest attendances, but he is a sick man.
Lambert, of West Sydney, hadn’t that excuse
for his tally of 45.
Hobart lost a genial and useful citizen
when Dr. G. 11. Gibson died the other day, at
63. Gibson was froAvned upon by the B.M.A.
when he founded the Homoeopathic Hospital
in Upper Macquarie-street, but the institu-
tion proved popular, and the B.M.A. was
glad enough to make friends with it and its
founder when the association Avent on strike
from the General Hospitals seven or eight
years ago. A keen angler, Gibson was one
of the Fisheries Commissioners for many
years. A son is carrying on the medical
tradition of the family.
Died at 86, Henry Ritchie, who was legal
manager of the Bischoff Tin Mining Co.
from its genesis until last June —52 years.
While he was in charge the co. gouged out
ore worth £5,300,000 and paid £2.500,000
in divs. —£211 12s. 6d. per share. He was
a son of the Captain Thomas Ritchie, R.N.,
who was Governor of Northern Tas. when
George Town was the capital. Henry was
born at Perth (Tas.), where the retired
commandant settled down and ran a flour-
mill. He was one of the original members
of the Launceston Stock Exchange, but he
will be longest remembered as one of the
small committee that secured the ground
and built the track along the Cataract Gorge
to the First Basin, giving Launceston what
it likes to think of as the finest park in
Australia.
T. 11. Martyn, avlio mixed theosophy with
tin, died lately while on a trip to Malaya.
He had been one of the optimists of the
Sydney Stock Exchange for betAvcen 30 and
40 years, and for the very profitable interest
Avhich Australia has in tin-dredging in South-
Eastern Asia it is largely indebted to him.

upon keeping fit during Health Week, is
competent to speak upon the subject of
physique. While at Melbourne ’Varsity he
held the half-mile and mile Australasian

received him as a Rhodes scholar, gave him
representative honors in athletics and
lacrosse. Early interested by the sociologi-
cal side of medicine, he was attached to
the Education Department of Victoria be-
fore the Avar, and since 1920 lie has been
measuring heads for the Ma State’s Edifica-
tion Department. He also lectures to Syd-
ney’s embryo medicoes on public health. Dur-

Palestine from start to finish.

Alexander Stewart, just dead at Canter-
bury, aged 68, was one of the Kirk’s strong-
lights in Victoria. He was Moderator in
1909 and thereabouts, and was one of the

tackle Larry Rentoul in debate. For some
years he was practically blind, but, being
gifted with a marvellous memory, he recited
the scripture lessons in his church services.
“Jcobb”: Blew into DarAvin a feAv weeks
hack Louis Degonliardt, born at Adelaide in
1849 and still going strong. Louis worked
his way north 50 years ago. He made the
Kimberleys his playground, and worked on
the Darwin-Pine Creek railway at 7s. a
day—the present rate is 225. As a stock-
yard builder he worked his way further
back, and the Degenhardt yards are noted
throughout the North. He was one of the
few who could make Black Brother work
without Avalloping him. At 72 he had the
contract for the pack-horse mail between
Wyndham and Turkey Creek, riding the
round trip of 450 miles every month. During
the 50 years Louis has had only one trip
south —to Perth, with a badly-shattered log.
His fighting Aveight has never been more
than 10st., and he looks good for another 20
years.
Billy McKell, ex-Minister for Justice in
the Storey and Dooley Governments, has
topped the poll in the Botany (N.S.W.)
Labor pre-selection ballot. Born at Pam-

street (Surry Hills) Public School, was
assistant sec. of the Boilermakers’ Union, and
sat on the 1936 executive, half of whose mem-
bers are uoav in Macquarie-street. Like the
late .Tim McGowen, whom he defeated for
Redfern, a seat the State’s first Labor Pre-
mier had held for 26 years, McKell was a
boilermaker in the Railway service. On
the night he was nominated for the 3937
selection ballot he was football-training
a local park, and his friends had a hard job
to coax him to stand. He had an easy Avin,
however, and entered Parliament at the age
of 25. McKell was a sturdy footballer, and
is still a handy fellow with the gloves.
John McWhae, who relinquished the Vic.
Agent-Generalship to Fairbairn on August 1,
will be sailing soon for Melbourne with his
Avife and one or two members of his family.
The Government, folloAving custom, has pro-
vided £5OO to pay for their passages.
McWhae wasn’t allowed to give full rein to
his immigration schemes, but was solaced
with a knighthood. In Vic. he goes back
to his squattage at Inverleigh.
The last post has sounded for “Jack” Vin-
cent, who was army-polisher to a division
or so of Diggers in the Big War. An old
soldier of the British Army, with much ser-
vice. he joined up with the Australian Force
in 1911, and as a W.O. put in a lot of hard
Avork at Broadmeadows. Although many
Diggers remember him most for his habit of
calling upon the Deity to have a look at the
sort of animals He had inflicted on him.
Vincent was a man with a kind word for
every individual trier in the mob; and he
certainly got results.
After soul-salvaging in Queensland for
over half a century, Dean Andrew Horan
has gone to report at Headquarters. Eighty
years ago he was born at Kildare iu the
odor of sanctity, as it were, two of his mater-
nal uncles, the brothers James and Matthew
Quinn, being Bishops of Brisbane and
Bathurst. Intended at first for a secular
profession, he took his B.A. in Ireland, but
then elected to follow the lead of his three
elder brothers, two of whom were in Bris-
bane diocese and one a professor in the
seminary in Bathurst. Most of his long life
was spent in Ipswich. He was in harness
to the end.
“Captain” Billy Simpson, the second man
on Mt. Isa field (Q.), and mate of Camp-
bell Miles, its discoverer, was killed in Bris-
bane last week by a motor. He was only
36. and unmarried.
John Priddy, who died recently at 84, was
the 10th man on the Gympie goldfield (Q.)
and a friend of Nash, the discoverer. Chosen
in ’6O from 41 applicants as sexton of the
Gympie cemetery, “old John” has since had
the melancholy triumph of burying all the
other applicants.
It was 73 years on October 34 since Capt.
Francis Cadell returned to Goolwa after hav-
ing navigated the river Murray in his steamer
Lady Augusta, built at Sydney. S. Aus.
Governor Henry Young and party made the
50 days’ trip up and down stream, and the
first cargo of wool was borne by the vessel
down the Murray. Cadell was rewarded by
S. Aus. Parliament with a bonus of £4OOO.
Canon Garland, of Brisbane, who has
lately been taking a great interest in the
Brisbane Greek Church and Greek commu-
nity generally, has been invested by the Con-
sul for Greece with the Order of the Holy
Sepulchre, once awarded only to royalty, and
now handed out sparingly. The gold cross
is the gift of his Beatitude Damianos, the
Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.
Crossed the range, at Parramatta, F. G.
Bloxham, who was born on Morago station.
Deniliquin, 69 years ago. He was a son of
E. J. Bloxham, a pioneer of Bourke; his
own best-known service to the country was
done in the Prisons Department. Ilis
brother, 11. K. Bloxham, earned good notices
the other day for his neAv book, “On the
Fringe of the Never-Never.”
Each unaware that the other had served
during boyhood on Nelson’s flagship Vic-
tory, Alfred William Leonard (87) and
Geo. Aldridge (74) resided within less than
one mile of each other iu Williamstown
(Vic.) for 40
years. Mutual re-
cognition came to
them only recently
by chance. Leon-
ard left the Vic-
tory 12 years be-
fore Aldridge join-
ed her. The for-
mer has lived in
the same house in
Electra-street for
over 50 years, the
street being named
after the sloop of
war in- which he
came to Australia
in 1852. His wife
is living. They

“T. 0.1.”: Tlie grandfather of the recently-
deceased Hon. Templar Pery was employed
in the G.P.0., Sydney, in 1830, and went
with Col. Anderson to Norfolk Island as
clerk. Governor Bourke told the Colonel to
look after him, as he was a bit wild. He
married on the island, and his son was born
there. The latter, on succeeding to the title
of Earl of Limerick, was denied admission
to the House of Lords until he produced his
birth certificate. A hunt all over Austral-
asia failed to produce the original, but a
copy was found in the possession of an ex-
church official, who demanded 20 guineas for
a copy of the entry. The guineas were not
paid, but the copy was seen, and an affi-
davit to that effect gained the Earl his seat.
James Stanbury, for many years a well-
known identity of the N.S.W. South Coast,
died recently in his 88th year. He was the
father of Jim, ex-world’s champion sculler,
and of eight others.
CAPE INSCRIPTION : 1616.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[On Oct. 25, l(il6, the Dutchman Dirck Hartog
landed on the island off the Westralian coast which
now bears his name. He Avas on a voyage from
Holland to Batavia, in the course of which he
sailed along a great part of the western coast ef
this continent. His landing-place is now called Cape
Inscription; but the plate he inscribed has been
removed to Amsterdam.]
One day three hundred years ago
1 know the sun was dancing
Across this sandy headland low,
As Hartog, bravely chancing
Uncharted seas, crept shoreward slow,
From port to starboard glancing.
His lookout, high along the mast,
Unto the ratlines clinging;
Below, a Bremen sailor fast
The tell-tale lead was swinging;
To good safe-holding ground at last
Their clumsy Endracht bringing.
The Spring had swept from shore to range,
In flowered sandals treading;
Now Summer, in a swift exchange,
The podded seeds Avas shedding,
Which o’er that silent Southland strange
Warm winds were softly spreading.
Upon that far October . day
Was Walter Raleigh living;
And grain from husks, in scholar way,
My Lord Yerulam seiving;
And Jamed the First with V'illiers gay
Much local scandal giving.
John Milton was but eight, 1 ween,
Ben Jonson still a-playing;
The youthful Cromwell, seventeen,
Already dourly praying ;
Though yet adown the highways green
Sweet English maids went maying.
They cared no jot, these shipmen bold,
Towards Bantam slowly wearing,
With dreams of merchandise and geld,
Dread seaward dangers daring ;
No doubt with cargo in the hold,
Still stoutly northward faring.
Abreast the red Westralian sand,
Their worn sails deftly stripping,
Where noev a lighthouse tall doth stand
To point the path of shipping,
The Endracht, Avith her seawornl band,
Comes slowly, softly, slipping.
I 6ee a group beside the rail
In baggy breeches standing—-
Four sturdy wights with heart to sail,
In merchant contract banding;
From Amsterdam, through calm and gale,
To make this Austral landing.
Jan Stins my fancy doth engage;
He speaketh thick and shortly ;
Gillis Miebais of Liege,
A tall “first merchant,” courtly;
And Peter Dockes of Bil, our sage
“Head steersman,” somewhat portly.
I hear the good ship’s bells once more
The hour of day loud chiming ;
I see the landing crew look o'er
Each flintlock’s careful priming;
1 see the dipping for’ard oar
Their shoreward rowers timing.
From Nederland this sturdy brood
Of city, farm or village,
To purchase silks or sandalwood,
Or find new lands for tillage,
Have chanced, prepared for gain or blood,
In either trade or pillage.
Aye, out across a sailless blue,
Three hundred years and over,
Fares Dirck of Holland and his crew,
A gruff historic rover,
With Jan and Gillis, Peter, too,
Our Southland to discover.
The date, the ship to mark the deed,
Upon the place of landing,
Their names therewith (a chaneev meed
Of future fame demanding)
They scratch in scrawling tin-plate screed,
And leave it quaintly standing.
Then Amsterdam to Bantam bound,
To trade or plunder tending.
Uncaring for the I .and neAvfound
Their worn sails deftly bending,
They fade again from Denham Sound
To silence never-ending.
VICTORIA.

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Ento” : When intimately connected with
the Tasmanian Museum a few years ago, I handled
those aboriginal spears that are referred to by “F.
THE NOSE HAVE IT.
“Well, old man, how docs living at Footscray compare
with St. Hilda?”
'Don’t ask me-comparisons are odorous!”
Clinton” (B. 25/9/’24). Tassy’s blacks spun the
weapon in their fingers lor some moments before
discharging it. A mere “flick,” as “F.C.” calls
it, would never have imparted to the blunt-nosed
wooden stick a rigidity sufficient to pierce a leather
saildle or to enter the sole of a man’s boot, which
are two achievements recorded.
* * * •
“Billy See”: The Westralian red-gum tree
bleeds like a stuck pig when the bark or sapwood
is injured. The gum is very fluid at first, but
solidifies rapidly, forming big cakes 4in. and Cin.
thick around the foot of the trunk. It has a very
high percentage of tannin, and is frequently used
for tanning fishing lines and nets. It is a wonder-
ful preservative. I have ordinary white cotton lines
tanned with red-gum which are still in service after
four years’ use. The ordinary dyed line of com-
merce is good for one season only. Red-gum tan
does not fade in sea water, but takes on a still
darker tinge. As a dye, the possibilities of the
gum are entirely unexploited.
* * * *
“Bonney”: Re speed of emus. In most
recent pars about motorists racing emus, the speed
of the birds has invariably been
put down at 45 miles an hour for
a distance from one to three miles.
Well, I’m out to say that motorists
who see emus going at that gait
should get their speedometers
corrected. At Lake Bonney (River
Murray, S.A.) lately there have
been dozens of emus in fine con-
dition —and not chickens either —
and mounted on a Harley and
sidecar, with a Stewart speedo., I
have tested their speed on four
occasions over good level and hard
country for distances of from a
half to one mile. I could not in
any circumstance get more than
32 to 35 miles out of them. To
urge them on a bit we had the
electric horn going and rny pal
kept uisciiarging a 12-gauge gun
into the air ; but it didn’t affect
their speed, as they were all out.
* * *
“Dibbin”: Tell “Yellum”
(B. 25/9/’24) that the true sea-
gulls of Moreton Bay (Q.) are
very shy birds. It is the crested
tern (Pelecanopus) which there
robs the patient fisherman of his
Sunday breakfast. These birds
will swoop into a boat and steal
fish, or even bait when fish are
not forthcoming, from under your
very nose. In fact, their hunger
or greed will often lead them to
take the bait when a line is be-
ing. thrown out, and it is quire
< ommen at Sandgate to see
fisherman playing one of these
screaming “fish” on his rod. You
wouldn’t mind if they were good
to eat; but, like that of many
seabirds, their flesh is very rani,.
“Gouger” : “Jae” wants to know if Binghi
is any good as a sailor (B. 18/9/’24). Yes. Along
his own coastline nothing on two legs can beat him
if he is properly handled. He mans
the pearl and beche-de-mer fleets from
Townsville to Thursday Island, across
the Gulf, and along the Territory coast
to Broome. He sails those tricky
waters where the cyclone is wont to
lash its tail, and braves the sudden
Barrier squalls in weedy cockleshells
ranging from five to 40 tons burden,
he exists for months at a stretch at sea
on a lick of flour, a sniff of ’baqca and
oceans of fish. Give him a sheet of
bark, a mat sail and a length of fibre
rope, and he’ll venture confidently out
to sea. Should a sudden squall swamp
him, he’ll simply swim the few odd
miles back to the mainland. Lots of
him can sail a cutter almost as well
as a white man, but, like all the
coloreds (with the exception of the
Japs), he must have the white man’s
guiding voice and hand at the helm in
case of emergency. He can be flurried
very easily, but with the white man’s
angry eyes and bull-roar as a sheet
anchor, he will stick to his ropes
through the hardest blow.
* * *
“T.P.”: James Coulson, of
Berringama, riding through the Aus-
tralian Alps after cattle in north-east
Vic., heard continuous howling from
a dingo. After a search he discovered
the animal lying in some scrub with
its bushy tail held fast in a mass of
cut-grass, which had to be sliced away
to free the body after the warrigal
had been dispatched. The dog-skin
with the brush still tangled in the
spiny cut-grass was exhibited at the
rifle-range at Berringama, and the
oldest bushman pronounced it unique.
The condition of the brute showed
that he must have been a prisoner for
some time.
“F.J.N.”: Will the Council come to my
assistance? I have a valuable draught horse which
has developed what seems to me a cancer on the
eye, about the size of a hen’s egg. It grew from
a small pinky piece of flesh, and gradually covered
the eye, and now iti is spreading outwards and dis-
charges a little. Ought 1 shoot the prad, or try
arsenic to burn the growth out?
* * * *
“Gouger”: The abos. of Cape York Pen-
insula don’t go in much for personal ornament, as so
many of the island tribes do. A carved wooden ring
through the gristle of the nose, or a notched bone
piercing the cartilege of the ear, is their main
ornament. however, I’ve seen some of
the bucks wearing boar-tusk armlets, and head- and
knee-dresses of feathers of the white cockatoo and
scarlet parrot. The frolicsome young gins at times
make brow ornaments and necklaces of the scarlet,
black and blue berries which grow among the gullies
inland. The coastal tribes often string small, brightly
colored sea-shells together upon a piece of tough
fibre or wallaby sinew, and really they do make' an
attractive necklace.
QUEER EFFECTS IN COHEN’S WINDOW.
“Vot! Aind’t de goods scheap enough? Veil, just valK
inside —b'raps der vinder-glass magnifies der
hrices.”
“Jae”: In a large wool store at Port
Adelaide, a eat, considered the best ratcatcher on the
premises, has become the proud mother of three
kittens; but not satisfied with her own little lot, she
has taken under her maternal care a young rat.
For the past three days she has permitted this young
rodent to share with her offspring the nourishment
that nature has provided. Some of the hands have
dangled the young chap before her, and even: sat it
on her nose, but no casualty occurs ; she gently paws
it into place again at the dinner-table. An old
shellback on the premises passes his opinion that
it is an act of contrition on puss’s part—she must
have murdered the mother and promised the lady on
her deathbed that she would look after the baby. Or
is it that she knows it will make a bigger meal if
fattened up for a week or two?
* • * *
“Lukie”: I walk past a magpie's nest
every day, and each time one of the birds attacks
me with great vigor. And yet I have seen a woman
go past unheeded. This morning I was 'wearing
a great-coat, and to my surprise neither of the
maggies troubled their heads about me. Why do
these birds make the distinction between man ami
woman ?
* * * *
“Ento”: The late Mrs. H. L. Roberts, of
Hobart, did not share “Veronal’s” opinion of the
Tasmanian devil (B. 25/9/’2). She found these
creatures delightful pets to breed, and she had
much experience with them in her little zoo, the
now historical Beaumaris. Diming recent years
several families on the land have kept them under
domestication, so unless their nature has changed
since the days of the early settlers they were not
deserving of the name applied to them.
* * * *
“Light Horse” : “F.A.W/s” chameleon (B.
2/10/’24) recalls the popularity which the gradual
beasts achieved with the Anzac Mounted Division
when the Light Horsemen first rode into Sinai. Apart
from the Bedouin camels and goats, the country
carried no apparent live stock, except chameleons,
jerboas and marmots —christened bandicoots by the
troopers. After the first few desert patrols, the
camp at Romani had few tents which did not con-
tain at least one chameleon tethered by a string.
They gradually deserted —or were posted as missing
for other reasons. My own animal persisted in
trying to pick the flies off a strip of fly paper
hanging in the tent, using his long prehensile
tongue for the purpose. Within a week or so
he had turned up his toes, but whether front heart-
break because the flies persisted in sticking to the
paper, or from arsenic poisoning, deponent knowetb
not.
• * * *
“Alofa” (New Hebrides) : The other clay
some natives came and reported a dead whale up
the coast a bit to the north, just outside the reef.
I went along to have a look at it, and found a
crowd of “boys” with canoes and .long lengths of
vine ropes about to put out to try to tow the
whale ashore. I jumped into one of the canoes to
see the fun. When we got outside the reef, I
noticed the water was reddish, as if tinged with
blood. On looking toward the dohlai, as Tommy
Tanna calls the whale, I saw the water in great
commotion, as if he was still in his death struggles ;
but on going closer I found that a shoal of sharks
was already busy on the monger, and had been
“tnrough him” to some purpose. The sharks were
of all sorts and sizes, sharp noses and flat noses,
ranging from a few feet up to 15ft. long. Some
were tearing off junks of blubber and then having
to fight to keep them ; others would leap right on
to the carcase and shoot the chute into the water
again. As we got within about 20 yards of him,
a huge shark charged the canoe, and one of the
boys broke a paddle trying to drive it off. This
left us with only one paddle, but, believe me, it
didn’t take those boys long to get out of the
danger zone, and I’ve wondered ever since if I
left a fortune in ambergris to the brutes.
* * * #
“Two Seas”: In protesting against the
wholesale destruction of green timber, “F. Clinton"
(B. 2/10/’24) is on safe ground; but when he says
that green timber is one of the best assets of the
man who is put to cope with the sheep-fly pest, he
knocks his argument out. Most practical sheep men
will agree that the fly is always worse in paddocks
where suckers are thickest, and “F.C.” himself sup-
plies tlie reason when he says: “In hot weather the
flies seek the shade of the trees in millions.” They
do. So do the jumbucks, which thus bring them-
selves within easy reach of their enemies. Then,
again, the fly only strikes on damp wool, and
naturally, after a sheep’s hindquarters are wet, the
longer it lies in the shade the greater the opportunity
for the flies to get in their destructive work. With
what “F.C.” says about the Lands Department's idea
of an “improvement” I quite agree. I loathe the
greedy fool who “rings” his paddocks “right out.”
• •••••
“Gwydir”: I can’t agree with “F. Clinton’s” view
(B. 2/10/’24) that green timber is the best asset
for the prevention of the fly pest. Let him migrate
to the N.S.W. north-west and he will alter his
opinion. N.S.W. Lands Dept, should be given credit
for treating timber killing as an “improvement”;
it invariably is. Further, the N.S.W. Forestry De-
partment and its capable officials have the say
as to what timber shall be destroyed by Crown
lessees, and the Lands Department faithfully follows
that expert advice ; wherefore permits to ring timber
are required in a number of instances.
• * * *
“Devilfish”: A little more evidence about
the size of the wedge-tailed eagle ( Uroaetus audax)
is given by Clive Lord and 11. H. Scott in their just-
published book on the animals of Tasmania. They
state that the largest bird of which they have
measurements had a wing spread of 9ft. 4in. ; A.
R. Reid, curator of the Hobart Zoo, vouches for the
figures. This eagle was shot on the east coast of
Tas. and was a very old bird, being almost black.
* * * *
“Rana”: The chameleon is not the only
creature that can change its color to correspond
with its environment. The green and golden bell
frog (Rana aurea), the largest frog in the Speck,
ANYBODY’S MISTAKE.
TRAVELLER: “What do they grow in this
part of the country? I notice this
ploughed field.”
AIRMAN: “My dear sir, that’s a main road."
has this power well developed. A big specim n
hopped out of some ferns at the Cataract Gorge and
alighted on a lichen-covered rock. With wondered
rapidity the blaze of color faded out, and the hop >i'
assumed tints so similar to its surroundings that
a stream of people passed by without even noticing '.
(Continued on page 2-4*)
THE BARMAN’S SOLILOQUY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the sad words of tongue or pen
The saddest are these: “It might have been.”
So Whittier said ; but, all the same,
He didn’t know the whole of the game.
For I have often heard sadder still
When a head popped over my window-sill
And a voice rang out, with a thirsty wheeze:
“Fred, are you up? Have you got the keys?”
And sadder still, on a Sunday night,
When the cards are dealt and the pipes alight.
The kettle sings with a homely sound,
And I am leading by half a round.
1 have fifteen six with a flush of four,
When Long Jack Meredith opens the door,
And the question comes with a nasty jar:
"Fred, have you got the keys of the bar?”
Next arrive Turner and Beery Bob,
And when travellers come they are on the job.
Bob stands aside with a bashful air,
And Turner leans on the back of my chair.
He studies the cards ; then says in my cars:
“There are two men just about dying here.
They have thirsted long and travelled far—
Are you sure you haven’t the keys of the bar?”
When my term of earthly life is o’er,
And I’m drawing pots of beer no more,
Bury me deep in some leafy glen,
Far away from the haunts of men.
Or lower me in some lonely plain,
Where no one may dig me up again
And break my rest with words like these:
“Fred, do you know where you left the keys?”
victoria.

HUDSON
Nine Years Leader of Fine Car Sales
Time and hard service have definitely
fixed Hudson’s leadership in the public
mind—as proved by the fact that the
Super-Six has outsold all fine cars for
nearly nine years.
In the new Super-Six the value is greater
than ever.
Those who drive today’s Super-Six call
it the greatest Hudson ever built. No
car excels it in performance, reliability
and lasting endurance.
Now to these famous qualities are
added refinements that assure smoother
operation in all respects, as well as
greatly increased gasoline and oil econ-
omy. From 4 to 5 miles per gallon in-
creased mileage is reported by Hudson
owners. Parts prices and service are
astonishingly low.
The builders of Hudson cars are the
sixth largest automobile producers
in the world. Their years of leader-
ship includes the development of a
service policy that is a real satisfac-
tion in ownership.

“The Rumpus” : Out of the sands of West-

ELYSIUM.

honey-getter said he felt like one of those tene-
ment landlords collecting his rent.

“Nitric”: Re “The Rumpus’s” par on
Binghi’s method of bagging the galah (B. 25/9/’24).
1 have seen the same idea carried out in W. Queens-
land ; all members of the parrot family will answer
the call of a wounded member and flock around. I
have seen even white cockatoos which had been
devastating corn fields in the Bunya Mountains (Q.)
caught in the same way, though ordinarily they
couldn’t be stalked in a month of Sundays. Strangely
enough, too, the plover, one of the most timid of
birds, will run into any barrage if a mate is calling
for help.
* * «■ *
“FY7”: “J.R.K.” asks (B. 25/9/’24) why
a couple of old detonators exploded while flying
through the air. The fulminate of mercury with
which the little copper caps are primed
is probably the most unstable and dan-
gerous of all explosives in ordinary
use. The friction of its own particles
will explode it, and it is always
packed tight in the detonators with
a gentle pressure. Probably exposure
had loosened the packing in “J.R.K.’s”
detonators or had set up some extra
chemical activity in the fiendish stuff.
I have never heard of an explosion
caused by blowing the loose sawdust
out of the caps, but jambing fuses in
too hard has been a fertile source of
trouble. The stuff can play its pranks,
too. One old Papuan hand parted with
some fingers while pinching the edges
of the copper tube (well away from
the priming) on the fuse with a pair
of pliers—he was too cautious to use
his teeth, as most of his mates did.
Another knocked a full box of deton-
ators off a boulder to a rock bottom
about six feet below. The tin box
bounced a foot in the air and the
detonators went spinning all over the
place; but the fulminate sat tight that
time.

“Light Horse” : I collected the
wages of showing-off at Heliopolis in
1915. Some English officahs were visit-
ing the mess, and one of them had a
stockwhip he had bought from an
Australian. Mention of the fact that
some Australians could pick pockets
with a whip (the Abo. column was
quoted as authority) brought a chal-
lenge to do likewise, but I compro-
mised on the old Western trick of
flicking up a coin and catching it in
my mouth. The first flick of the
whip brought the i 0-piastre piece home
with such force that the result was
a magnificent black eye which could
not be uncovered to sunlight for a
fortnight.
“Pat Busliie”: Queer nesting-places?
Interruptions on the telephone service from West
Maitland up the North Coast lines (N.S.W.) set
the mechanics thinking, and out they went to in-
vestigate. Near Mindaribba they found a magpie s
nest built against a telegraph post. It was com-
posed mainly of small pieces of wire, many of
which were touching the lines. The curio is now
located in West Maitland.
“Ophis”: It is often said
that the venomous snakes used by
snake charmers and others are
rendered harmless by the extrac-
tion of their poison fangs. In
their just published work on the
animals of Tasmania, Lord and
Scott point out that a snake can-
not be made a harmless reptile
for long by merely drawing its
fangs, because if any of the fangs
are broken or extracted they are
replaced by others within a few
days. But maybe, if you keep on
drawing its fangs, the snake be-
comes discouraged and ceases to
grow any new ones. A safer
plan would be to extract the
poison bag.
* * *
“Nitric”: Re the queer
assortment of goods which “Troop-
horse” (B. 25/9/’24) found in-
side a crocodile. I lately caught
a shark at Mud Island (Moreton
Bay, Q.), and found the follow-
ing in his innards: A hare (there
had been a “fresh” in the river,
which explains that), a small
anchor, a medium shark hook with
2ft. of chain attached, a jam-tin
and several oysters, plus a small
stingray. He was a 10-footer and
seemed comfortable, despite the
emporium he had aboard. A
fisherman on the North Coast (Q.)
lately caught a bream with an
open pearl-handled knife inside.
He described the instrument and
gave the initials on it. A week
later another piscatorial artist claimed it —dropped
overboard 300 miles from the place of finding nine
months previously.
* » * *
“Pick” : Here’s another three-figure sheep-
dog for “Kowsara’s” collection (B. 28/8/’24).
Clune, a Scotch collie, after winning the champion-
ship of his class in a ; Scotland National exhibition,
was purchased for 110 guineas by the late Colonel
Roberts, of Sydney. Later, on the Colonel’s sheeu-
station, Bibbenluke (N.S.W.), Clune proved himself
as a sheep-dog not worth that many shirt buttons.
* * * *
“Parama” : Does the ’gator (or crocodile,
to be correct) take hardware aboard as an aid to
his digestive machinery, after the manner of other
birds? More than once I’ve seen stones —always
well worn and rounded—taken from the interior of
these saurians, but have never been able to get any
satisfactory explanation of their presence there. I
have a. heavy stone adze that was taken from the
stomach of a 15ft. croc, in New Guinea. The adze
is unlike those used and made in the district in
which the croc, was trapped, so must have been
HER PRESERVER.
VENUS : “I’m afraid to take my kimono off. I’d. hate
people to laugh at my figure.”
APOLIO : “Don’t worry, my dear. Nobody will laugh at
you while I’M about.”
taken on board —most likely with the man who was
using it—in anotheT part of the country; it may
have been serving as ballast in the 15-footer for a
hundred years or more. The natives wouldn’t touch
it; it was bedevilled, and very bad “medicine.” Tn
another and smaller croc, that was killed near the
mouth of the Fly River, an empty whisky bottle was
found. He carried no stones or other hardware, per-
haps for fear of breaking the glass and causing
complications.
* * * *
“Gouger”: “Moe’s” New Guinea natives
with red hair (B. 25/9/’24) may have an explanation,
though I would hate to insinuate anything. I re-
member well when the Desert Column marched into
El Arish we unsophisticated Australians were sur-
prised to see a proportion of the Arab population
with both fair and ginger hair. Curiosity, of course,
got the cat out of the bag. They were souvenirs
of Napoleon’s troops that had occupied El Arish
about a century ago. At least, that was the Arabs’
proud explanation.
* * * *
“Adelaide” : Tlie crow gets a fairly good
character from T. H.
Williams, who retired
from the Inspectorship
of Stock in S.A. last
year. He lately told an
interviewer; “Through-
out, the crow has been
a cleanser, eating :he
immature blowfly in all
stages from carcases.
It is only a danger 10
lambs for a day or
two from birth. Far
worse is the fox, which
is a lamb-destroyer
pure and simple. Ex-
termination of the crow
would be a mistake.
In my experience of
over 60 years the
balance as useful birds
is all in their favor.
But you can’t leave
the blowfly problem to
them. I am a strong
advocate for burning or
burying of all dead
carcases. The work
should be carried out
religiously by all stock
owners.’’
“Morob” : A disease responsible for a good
deal of mortality amongst the natives of Northern
Queensland and the Northern Territory is Maciis
perniciosa, about which very little is known. It
seems to resemble acute pernicious anaemia, which
produces extreme emaciation, until the victim is
little more than a skeleton covered by skin. No
amount of proper feeding will restore sufferers
to a normal condition; and as the disease is fre-
quently met in districts where there is no lack of
native food, its origin is obviously not one of a dietary
nature. In bad cases it is possible to distinguish
the outline of most of the organs of the body, and
to watch the beating of the heart, or to follow
the course of food in the alimentary tract. It has been
suggested that the condition may be due to some
parasitic organism like the hookworm, which often
reduces its victims to a similar state. The complaint
is much more prevalent on the western coast of the
Gulf of Carpentaria than in Northern Queensland,
and a strange thing about it is that, although white
men sometimes live for long periods in districts
where it is very bad, cases among them are practically
unknown.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: There is a cat at Queen’s
Park (W.A.) who knows where the milk comes
from. Each morning and evening she runs with
her owner to the cowyard, sits up beside him and
receives squirts of ; milk direct' from the teats.
Puss dispenses almost entirely with lapping with
her tongue, and can surround the juice as fast as
it comes.
* * * *
“Roleg” : Queer ; nesting places? Yes?
Then I beg to nominate the pair of swallows which
have nested in an ’ old dry-cell box in the engine
house of the motor-launch belonging to the B.H.A.
Smelters at Wardang Island (S.A.), where the shell-
sand comes from and the penguins warble love
songs to the moon. The launch rups three or four
days a week from Wardang to Pt. Victoria for
supplies—a seven-mile trip. From the time the
launch leaves the moorings nothing is seen of the
feathered housekeepers until its arrival at the Point
Victoria jetty, when they at once come aboard,
eagerly awaiting the earliest opportunity to dart
through the open porthole to see that all is well
at “Mon Repos.” They stay by the boat until : t
leaves for the Island, and join again at the mooring.
Careful watching has failed to reveal any trace
of them on the journey, and they don’t stowaway;
and bad weather makes no difference to their
attendance. Home-lovers all right.
* * » #
“Sirdar”: Three weeks ago a ewe on
Jack Angus’s farm at Ensay (Vic.) gave birth tc
a lamb. To our surprise, a fortnight afterwards
another one arrived. There can be no doubt about
this, as there was not another. ewe within a mile
at the time. Mother and both infants are alive
and doing well.
* * * *
“D.F.” : The Tasmanian devil is a tough
customer to snare. If he is caught by the leg he
will chew off any ordinary snare, and even a neck
springer does not always hold him. Frank Bowker,
of Bicheno (Tas.), caught an old fellow with a
neck springer the other day and found tnat lie 1
had seven wire snares round his neck. Some of
them cut right in through the skin. Besides th.it
he had three snares on a front leg and one on a
back leg.
* * * *
“8.8. C.” : How’s this for a freak potato?
A tuber came in contact with a buried leather strap
with ordinary buckle holes in it. Instead of gro%v-
ing round the obstruction, it elected to crawl through
one of the holes, and finished up as a sort of Siamese
twins —"a half on each side of the strap, and joined
by the tiny piece through the hole. Bananaland
produced it.
* * * *
“Pick”: Had “Herodot” watched a little
more closely when lie thought two rabbits were
jazzing (B. 2/10/’24), he would have noticed the
bunnies’ fore feet going like flails and their fur
scattering through the air. Buck rabbits —and
FORCE OF HABIT.
hares, too —always fight in that way. They rise erect
on their hind legs and strike with great rapidity
and precision with their raised paws. Meanwhile
their antics in evasion and attack resemble a
dance. Like boxers, they duck, spin and prance,
usually with a circle of interested lady admirers.
The sudden wild scurry from the convincing ground
meant that one battler had thrown in the sponge
and the others were following to put in the boot.
CREEDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was going past this Court this morning and
met a man I knew. He said to me, ‘One of the
men in this raid has not turned up. He is a decent
fellow and he’ll do in his bond. Will you appear for
him?’ 1 said 1 would do so if he was a decent
fellow.”— A recent witness who ivas afterwards sen-
tenced to three days for impersonating his friend’s
friend; or, as the charge had it, for having wilfully
misbehaved in the Court.
W liatever the worth of the thousand creeds that tear
at each other’s throats,
That take aciount of no human needs while they part
their sheep from the goats,
That twist the teaching of Christ their Lord from
“Love thou thy fellow man”
To “Love the chosen who can afford to live on a
special plan”—
Whatever the worth of these creeds may be, I care
not a hollow straw;
But here’s a creed that will do for me, though it
violate Church and Law—
The creed of the man who will go to gaol or to
Hell or to, worse than both
Because the friend of a friend should fail on a
bloody or bloodless oath.
A creed that is writ in the one word Mate, or its
lesser brother Friend,
A creed that has never learned to prate, that will
neither break nor bend,
That stands to the strain of the hardest test and
knows not a thought of gain,
A creed they know in Australia’s west, and tried in
The Flanders plain.
Go down to the gaol like a common stool for the
lies that you told too well;
Go down and rot behind bars, you fool, with a fore-
taste of life’s last hell!
Go down ; for the law that you chose to break is a
God in these people’s eyes ;
Go down and forfeit the shallow stake that the law
has claimed for its prize!
For while there’s a creed that can be so rash as
to fly in the face of law,
Be sure that when law and creed shall clash the
creed shall be held as straw ;
It matters no jot that the law he man’s—or the
thing that men blame on God—
You’ll hear the sound of the voice that bans such
faitli to the chipn and rod.
Aye, men are entombed in a thousand cells and rot
in a thousand holes
And carry the brands of a thousand hells on their
bodies and brains and souls;
For so must they pay who have followed the trust
that would match man’s good with good—
Great is the Law; and the hard walls lust to gather
the gaol’s ripe food !
VICTORIA.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
The most-talked-about \ .A.T.C. Cup field
and a day of perfect sunshine combined to
flood the Caulfield course with a record
crowd through which a cadaverous pick-
pocket could scarcely have wormed his way.
Enthusiasm during the great race swelled to
frenzy, but when Purser sprang m front
of the various favorites a howl of lamenta-
tion went up, behind which could be heard
the joyous whoops of bookies and ot isolated
backers. Spring fashions got their first
outing, but provided few sensations, i uiiy
half the petticoated crowd wore black, and
about a quarter of these topped their mourn-
ing with red hats and carried handbags, sug-
gesting a turnout of Xavier scholars. Dozens
of our nicest-looking women murdered then
good looks with modern versions of the early-
Victorian porkpie hat, severely banded with
ribbon. Another heavily featured craze was
narrow white braiding on a dark background.
One lady provided a scarlet dazzle, with geor-
gette draperies snailed over with snowy
stitchery. The really best-dressed wore coats
and skirts of impeccable cut; and magpie
frocks abounded to tiresomeness. Lady For-
ster, in sappliire-blue silk, vested with sul-
phur color, wore a natty little toque to match :
the sporty vice-regal Countess was more
sombre, in coat and skirt of brown .brocaded
cloth, under a dark-red hat; Admiral Hall
Thompson’s wife, who has made friends all
round, was in black with a laced draped hat
supporting a droopy grey feather. Mrs. Wil-
liam Leonard and Mrs. Dick Casey were both
coated, skirted and hatted in black; Mrs.
Clive Leonard’s black embroidered coat was
hemmed with fur, and she had a black hat.
Mrs. Russell Clarke featured magpie effects.
Mrs. Allan Currie provided a pleasing con-
trast in a red and white wrap-coat under
one of the new-style. crinoline hats, with
feathers washing its wide brim.
The Bowes Kellys brightened the Sunday
after Caulfield Cup Day with an. “afternoon”
in their Malvern home, which is next door
to vice-regal Stonington. The company had
been beckoned in to farewell eldest daughter
Mrs. Jack Hay; but the steamer had put
back its sailing date, and the lady had flitted.
Mrs. Kelly, in becoming black crgpe dra-
peries, greeted the guests with a backing of
flow r ery fragrance; and her big husband,
three nearly-as-big sons and a trio of good-
looking daughters held tip her hands. A
string orchestra backed the chatter without
getting in the w r ay of it; and there were the
lawns for those who preferred the sunshine.
All the very best were there.
Anticipatory thrills used to shake social
Melbourne in the few weeks before the. Cup.
But the petticoated sex now punts, jazzes
and new-frocks itself all the year round, and
it refuses to oscillate quicker even to social
waves of the highest frequency. One of our
best-dressers stunned the susceptibilities of
some of the old Society brigade the other day
with the revolutionary admission that sin l
bad decided to dodge the high cost of Cup-
season decoration by ordering her summer
chiffon cry after the carnival. That’s wha*
the Cup has come to. It is no longer a
lonely Alp; its crest certainly still rises high,
but no longer from a plain.
When the sunshade was merely for use
few of the sex worried about carrying one;
now that a parasol is part of the decorative
scheme no woman is complete without one.
Yet there are still people who accuse us of
dressing to please the opposite sex. or, per-
haps, to make the other women jealous. As
every woman knows, we poor dears dress
merely to be in the fashion.
That mythical personage the Chamber-
lain has broadcasted invitations for a ball
which the Governor-General and Lady For-
ster will hold in the vice-regal ballroom on
Thursday evening, Nov. 6.
There is a good time ahead for the Gentle-
women’s Aid Society. The half-yearly sale
gained in financial and social weight by
being sheltered in the easily-accessible Prali-
ran City Hall and by the patronage and
presence of Lady Stradbroke. The Coun-
tess, who still wears the anxious look
brought there by the illness of her small
son Christopher, was welcomed by the
society’s president, Mrs. Tremearne, and
Prahran’s Mayoress, Mrs. Pickford. the latter
handing her a presentation posy of roses and
lilies-of-tlie-valley. Lady Stradbroke breathed
the hope that Melbourne might follow Sydney’s
lead in providing for its distressed gentle-
women in their twilight hours.
David Taylor crossed from the Speck the
other day to claim Doris Northcote at Toorak
St. John’s before a crowded congregation of
the best known and many Tassie relatives
of the ’groom—he is a sprig of a family tree
which has flourished in the island for more
than a hundred years:;. The bride s white-
and-silver draperies trailed a train of white
georgette, steered down the aisle by two
little nieces, Pat and Prudence Sanger, both
picturesquely Kate Greenawayed in wn.te
satin and lace. Orange-blossoms anchored
the bride’s tulle veil, ahd her bouquet ot
pink and rosy blossoms came from the com-
mittee of the Renown Free Kindergarten,
who remembered her kindly interest in their
welfare.
The Mermaid Repertory Players’ dishing-
up of Barrie’s “Dear Brutus” on the Play-
house stage should cause a nice fat cheque
to flutter into the Civic Charity money-box.
The house-full signal was flown early on
both evenings to stem the rush on the box-
office, and the stage bent under the weight
of floral offerings, of which the Rep. s orches-
tra got its share.
A committee, headed by Councillor Bar-
nett, hosted a ball in the St. Kilda Town
Hall on Thursday night, with ex-Mayor
.Allen and his acting-Mayoress daughter as
star guests. The thrill of the evening was
the presentation made between intervals ot
jazz and jollity of a diamond stud and sleeve-
links to Councillor Allen and a canteen
loaded with table silver and knives of every
size to daughter Merle, the cutlery, etc., doing-
double duty as a tribute to the dark-eyed
damsel’s popularity as Mayoress and as a
wedding gift.
To greet Anglican clerics down from the
country for Synod week. Archbishop and
Mrs. Harrington Lees how-d ye-doed a mul-
titude under the ancient gum-tree on the
Bisliopcourt lawns. A chill wind blow-
ing across the sunshine forbade summer
frocking. Lady Forster was in blue with
a ribbon-trimmed hat, and had gent.-help
Mulliolland in attendance; and Admiral and
Mrs. Hall Thompson and the Mayoral Brun-
tons helped with the official tone. The
extra-special guests fed in the dining-room
while the lesser lights took their cake and
pekoe in a marquee.
Louise Lovely failed to materialise at the
Austral Salon reception launched in her
honor. Regrets at not seeing the cinema
lady were, however, forgotten in the joy of
hearing William Heughan, the Scotch, song-
bird, in a couple of his most inspiriting
warbles. The Salon’s usual musical menu
sandwiched the tea-drinking. Bryl Walk-
Icy was another guest; and Mrs. A. E. V.
Richardson, who crossed back from Adel-
aide the other day to collect her household
gods, seized the chance of farewelling her
intimates.
Ruby Reynolds Lewis, who looks toward
you. is the clever Victorian musician who
gained the
Olympian
medal for the
best sporting
song won
it against all
the world. It
was a spirited
hunting ditty.
Angels and

nolds. Amongst
the lady’s pre-
vious song successes were “Butterflies,”
"Dreamy Moon,” “Cradle Song” and “Prim-
roses.” Ruskin made the picture.
The City Fathers have frowned on the at-
tempt to make St. Kilda Melbourne’s jazz
suburb, and the popping of corks must cease
in future at the insipid hour of 11 p.m.
St. Kilda has adopted the night-club habit,
and the young person who tells you breath-
lessly that he or she went to St. Kilda last
night intends to convey a hint of at least a
nodding acquaintance with wickedness. But
there are a lot of staid, liighly-respectable
people at St. Kilda who are becoming scan-
dalised at the hectic reputation the place
they like to live in is gathering; and the
Council, consulting legal authority, thinks
it has power to protect them. On the other
hand, the big dance-hall proprietaries, Whose
jazz palaces will be white elephants without
the all-night revelries, have consulted learned
people also, and are preparing to make a
tight, of it. Meantime the numerous places
which haven’t any license, but take it, will
continue their careers, punctuated by fines
for illicit grog-selling: and the scream of
passing cars along Fitzroy-s,treo ; ,t jn the
early hours is likely to be unabated.
Mrs. Norman Falkiner hostessed a wel-
come-home dance for daughter Molly Blake -
ney. who with her husband (he’s a
captain in the Indian Army) has come
down to see if a Melbourne summer
is better than an Indian monsoon. The
tnmasha was turned On in the white-and-
green South Yarra house which the Falkin-
ers lately acquired from the medical Hoopers.
It was a gilt-edged affair, with a guest-list
headed by the Priminister and Mrs. Bruce,
with Commodore Beale and a trio of naval
commanders from the Dunedin, who all
came on from dinner with the G.-G.
A notable citizeness of Bendigo whose
name is associated with nearly every
charitable and philanthropic undertak-
ing in the Golden City looks alertly
out of this picture. During the war

refused to down

library. The energetic matron is on the
Melbourne executive of the Victoria League,
is interested in the Girls’ Guide movement,
and is vice-president of the Women’s
National League and the Ministering Child-
ren’s League. The Lansells shelter much
hospitality at their Bendigo home and on
their Deniliquin station, Chal Singh. She
was a Bendigo girl, Geraldine Orme.
Members of the Mitchell clan, of Albury,
whose widely-branched family-tree rooted it-
self many years back in Australian soil,
assembled in their hundreds in the Mel-
bourne Grammar Chapel to hear one of the
youngest of the tribe, Mollie Mitchell, make
her vows to Nevil Whiting. The bride’s
paternal grandmother, the James Mitchell
widow, of Table Top, headed the gathering.
(Her maternal grandfather was that French
emigre, Huon, who gave his name to the
river in Tasmania.) Little Mollie went to
the tryst on the arm of her dad, wearing
white marocain sparkled over with crystal
embroideries. A well-pedigreed lace veil
floating from a mooring of diamente and
orange blossom had been lent by Mrs. G.
Fosbery.
Elise Steele tucked a violin under her
chin at the age of nine. Felix Gade
wished to take her to Europe, but she won
the Melbourne University Con. scholarship
in 1913, and subsequently Henri Verbrug-
ghen secured her a scholarship at the N.S.W.
Con., where she studied for two years. It
was on Daisy Kennedy’s advice that she
eventually went to Europe and put in some
time in study under the Czecko-Slovakian
master, Otakar Seveik. Now she is back
again, and at a lone-hand recital the other
night at the Assembly Hall showed she had
not been wasting her time abroad.
Scott’s Hotel recently had a turtle-soup
lunch, specially designed to introduce Mel-
bourne to a new Australian industry. The
beast on which De Rougemont did his N.T.
rough-riding swarms on the Lacepedes,
islands off the n.w. coast of Australia; and
a eo. recently formed in Melbourne has leased
the group. Most of the export is to go
aw'ay in a nicely-canned condition ; but citi-
zens of Australian towns who like their
turtle soup when it isn’t a mere mock may
have the real thing led to their doors.
Tasmanian Society, which objected to a
home-grown Governor, having gained its
point, is now contemplating the arrival of
the imported viceroy O'Grady with mixed
feelings. A Labor member, and one who has
no private income, is not likely to make the
social whirl go any faster. Mrs. O’Grady,
being an invalid, will not come with her
husband, who will bring one of his seven
daughters—an 18-year-old girl who “does
hope she able to get a decent
shingle”—to act as vice-reine. A married
daughter who once lived in the Speck is
returning there with her children to be near
her dad.
Miss Louisa Henty, of Fairfield, Kew,
who died a couple of months ago at the age
of 77, left property valued for probate at
£145.816, and £46.000 of it is put in trust
for different public purposes, mostly charit-
able. She was a daughter of Thomas Henty,
of Merino Downs —one of the brothers who
crossed from Van Diemen’s Land and settled
at Portland when Victoria was in swaddling
clothes. Crippled and helpless, she had never
been outside her gate for 40 years until a
motor-car took her to a thanksgiving service
in St. Paul’s Cathedral at the time of the
Hickson Healing Mission. She had been
visited by the missioner in her own home.
and claimed to have been completely restored
to health through him. Acute pneumonia
carried her off at the end.
At 26, that bright Melbourne boy. Dr. T.
M. Cherry, has gained a fellowship of
Trinity College, Cambridge. At Scotch Col-
lege here he captured all the prizes on the
science side, and went to the Melbourne Uni-
versity at the minimum age of 17 on a
scholarship. His career at Ormond was a
series of triumphs, temporarily interrupted
by a period in camp during the war. The
accumulation of exhibitions took him to Cam-
bridge in 1919, where he won a major
scholarship, and at the end of the first year
split the honor of heading the wranglers in
the mathematical tripos. This year he
secured the degree of doctor of philosophy.
There is a proud household out at (lien Iris,
where his father, Dr. T. Cherry, lives.
The Anglican Synod hasn’t yet got down
to ballot-boxes with sliding panels, but a
step was made in that direction when some
anonymous person circulated a “ticket"
aimed at the exclusion from office of certain
people whose views did not coincide with his
idea of holiness. Most of the leading clerics
whose names appeared indignantly repudi-
ated the document and its attack on some
of the diocesan officials; but there were dark
frowns of impenitence from one corner of
the Assembly.
The second John Grice daughter, Hilda,
and Mrs. Algy Landale are off to India on
a visit to General and Mrs. Kenneth
Buchanan. The General was the slim, blue-
eyed help on ex-Governor Sir Reginald’s
staff at vice-regal Stonington. He married
the youngest of the good-looking Tom Gum-
ming daughters, Muriel, sister of Lady Grey
Egerton.
Max Meldrum is thinking of packing his
paint-box and taking his wife and daughters
Elsa and Ida to America. With an antici-
patory eye he sees the States standing up
and shouting for help before he gets through
with a series of lectures on his favorite
before- and after-dinner subject, “Truth in
Art.” He has just done a fine portrait of
Charles Hackett.
Adelaide takes round the hat:—
Exhausted calm follows the »pera, except for those
good people whose social energy finds vent in
charity. Minda began its effort in the Town Hall
with the Mayor to bless it, vice Mrs. Glover, who has
been on the sick list for a day or two; and on the
same day there was an “American” tea to raise
funds for the St. Peter’s College Mission. A fete
at the Geoffrey Kyffi'n Thomases’ home at Medindie
was in aid of the holiday fund for the boys of the
Walkerville Home; and another opened by Mrs.
Duncan-Hughes at the Girls’ Presbyterian College.
In between there has been a grand-opera concert
at the Exhibition. For performers Filippini, who
promoted it, had local singers who had proved their
worth during his own opera season, supported by a
big sprinkling of the Melba-Williamson Co.; his
wife was conductor, and Topsy Doenau accompanist.
A recital by Clive Carey, the Con.’s latest acqui-
sition, drew a packed house that got its reward in a
delightful concert —French and Spanish songs and
English folk songs, with a running accompaniment of
comment on the characteristics of various composers
and periods.
Sweets, caps and flowers were on sale as side-
lines to the music at the Delmar Hall concert in aid
of the Children’s Hospital and tubei'cular soldiers.
The caps were the cleverest things, fashioned by
Miss Cleggett and her assistants —only the tubercu-
lar soldiers know the work she has put in to raise
funds for them. Singers were drawn from the Con.’s
feminine part-singing class and the Adelaide Glee
Club.
Hilda Felstead tea-ed with the women members of
the Liberal Federation before packing her bags again,
and gave them her views on the life of an Aus-
tralian woman in India, with a side glance at the
unpopularity of Australian foodstuffs in a place
that should be one of our biggest markets, thanks
chiefly to the battered and unattractive condition
of the tins they arrive in.
The Governor-General’s week-end here was a busy
one—the opening of the Protestant Home for Children
in the old Baker homestead at Morialta, the un-
veiling of the Cross of Sacrifice at the Soldiers’
Memorial Cemetery, a private inspection of the .row
and exquisite chapel at the Angas-street Convent, and
a smallish dinner at Government House. The Soldiers'
Cemetery is the only one of its kind in Australia
—a portion of the West-terrace cemetery aside
as the final resting-place of men who fought iu “tie
war, grassed and rose-planted, with the restful green
of its turf broken only by the little marble slabs
that give the name and regiment of each man who
sleeps there.
Dr. Krakowsky, who is President of the Lyceum
Club, hostessed a tea-party that had Professor John
Adams as its principal guest, with her fellow-club
members to meet him. There was a speech or two
after tea—from the Club’s ex-president, Dr. Helen
Mayo, and its secretary, Dr. Mocatta.
The obscure position chosen for the memorial to
Way, C.J., suggests that Col. Light’s often eulo-
o-ised lav-out of Adelaide made inadequate provision
for statuary. Artistically, the square system of
town-planning is hopeless. Adelaide has 15 statues,
and with one exception—a small bronze of f.n
athlete —they are all situated in Victoria-square or
along North-terrace. Victoria-square still has several
vacant corner sites, one of which is reserved ior
the belated tribute to Flinders, but if any more
sculpture is squeezed into North-terrace, that localiiy
will begin to look like a cemeterv.

The Royal Sydney Yacht Club invited all
(lie other sailing-men into its gardens to
rejoice over the opening of the yachting
season. Saturday was all breeze and sun
and blue Avaters for the great occasion, and
the picturesque Ivirribilli grounds were a
blaze of glory. The Governor and Lady de
Chair came to the party, the Viking very
workmanlike in flannels, ready to skipper
his Cherry-o, and his lady in smart cream
tailorings finished off AA'itli a white hat rigged
with black boAvs. The Commander Grant
couple were in the offing, he all pale grey
to match his wife’s outfit. The Commander
Quick couple Avere others in the throng
about terraces and laAvns, and pretty Mrs.
Don Taylor cast a beaming eye in the direc-
tion of the G.-G.’s winged Corella which her
husband was sailing. Veteran David Car-
ment and his Avife held quite a court; so
did the Dan Kellys. Coyle, Iv.C., came with
his attractive Avife and daughter Madge.
Marjorie Quinn, in a spreading hat as pink
as the inside of an island shell, put a glow
into the atmosphere; and there were Mil-
sons and Slirimptons and representatives of
the established Ivirribilli families within the
sacred gates.
Thank God for the sunshine! It floods the
Night Refuge in Ivent-street, and when
sister and brother who have sought its
shelter Avake up these mornings they see a
flood of its golden promise breaking over
the spreading tree in the back yard, and as
they go out of the gate .they pass through
ivide shafts of it gleaming on spreading
shrubs in squat green tubs set along the
verandah of the old “colonial” house which
is the main building. A place of paradox:
its gate unlatched to misfortune, and, with-
in. the home of innumerable black cats —
black cats for luck! The Avomen’s common-
room is bare and polished, yet carries an
air of rough comfort. Its long trestle tables
are scrubbed to-a gleaming Avliiteness; on
its mantelpiece a yellow mug holds a bunch
of wild floAvers. In its corner a seAving-
machinc seems to purr Avith eagerness to
be of service. This oasis of kindness has
started on another year’s work. The com-
mittee would like to extend the institution’s
hospitality. Who’ll help?
The Musical Association waved a last farc-
Avell to Grand Opera the night before Dal
Monte and Borgioli sailed for America. As
usual Farmer’s Avas the aviary, and almost
every feminine music-maker in Sydney flut-
tered in some time during the evening. Toti
looked like an Italian festa in blush-pink
taffetas, very billoAvy as to skirt and plenti-
fully adorned Avitli lace. Over this she had
flung a black chiffon velvet cloak enriched
with a deep collar of Avliite fox. One of the
Mort sisters-in-law held Borgioli’s hand
l’rocked in steely grey georgettes. The E. J.
Tait couple smiled on the songbirds who
have wrapped the Firm in golden plumage;
and concert-manager Claude Kingston
brought his singing wife, who turned a
Buddlia-like calm to the fevered throng, even
when that handsome actor-chap, Liliom.
strode into the room. He’s a devastating
fellow, and they say he can interpret each
play in his repertoire in six languages.
Myrtle Meggy wedded her piano to Farns-
worth Hall’s fiddle in a Cesar Franck sonata r
and Norman Janson sang entrancingly to
Joan Fry’s accompaniments.
The Ambassadors encircled the Feminists’
Ball last AA r eek, and the strenuous warriors
of that club got out of mufti and climbed
into the hoops, panniers and brocades of
Beau Brummel’s time. Ruby Rich, avlio is
one of the Feminists’ orators, ruffled in an
array of magnificent brocades and satin, and
called it Marie Antoinette. Rita Barnett,
who made an attractive Marquise, was handed
the first prize by the judges, Mrs. Sep Levy
and Thea Proctor. Mrs. Levy wore her own
beautifully-coiffed white hair above Persian-
red georgettes with deep bands of squirrel.
Thea Proctor, who seems to grow more Olym-
pian in stature, carried cardinal satin and
black lace with an air. Frederick Waley and
his lady brought the salt sea with their
party, the Captain Craufurds and Com-
mander Nelson Clov'cr being of the group,
the tall Mrs. Craufurd’s furlongs of flame-
georgettes suggesting a fire in a skyscraper.
The hostess herself Avore black frocking with
a freight of the fashionable rhinestones. Mrs.
B. E. Minns, Mrs. Liddell and the club’s
president. Miss Preston Stanley, were others
who added weight to the gathering, while
a flight of dancing-girls and -boys brushed
it up with the bloom of youth. The takings
help the Little Citizens’ Kindergarten.
The Australian-made Preference League,
discussed its aims over a brew of tea at
the Mary Elizabeth the other afternoon. The
white-and-gold room Avas packed Avith en-
. husiastic women, who swore by the immor-
tal tealeaf to insist on the “Made in Aus-
tralia” mark on everything they buy. Sec-
retary Mrs. Wallace Nelson allied efficiency
to a pair of sparkling eyes ; Mrs. MacKin-
non presided over the teapots; and the Waley
lady and Mayoress Gilpin were among the
heartiest supporters of “Australia First.”
There was music, of course, and story; Iva
Clarke contributed the Poi song as only a
Maorilander can.
The S.TJ.D.S. are working overtime to top
off the Carillon fund, now quite full and
threatening to overflow. Last Aveek they
put on three one-acters in the cause: Alfred
Sutro’s “Man in the Stalls.” Stanley Hough-
ton’s “Fancy Free” and “Echoes,” by Adrian
Consett-Stephon. The plays were produced
in the hall of the Teachers’ Training Col-
lege, and generally the acting showed a great
improvement, though the prompter’s voice
was still loud in the land.
Dr. Theresa Pyne, who has been on the
resident staff of the Mater Hospital at North
Sydney, went the Avay of the great majority
last week and blithely promised to cherish
Alec Carmichael, of Dulwich Hill, in sick-
ness and in health. St. Joseph’s, at Neutral
Bay, heard tire vows, and Father McDermott
and Father Gerard kept tally of them.
Theresa, avlio went to the altar with her
mother, Avore raiment designed to ravish the
eye rather than to soothe the hygienic mind.
Her frock of ivory satin and silver lace
leaped gleefully into a* glittering fish-tail
train, and a fortune in Limerick lace cas-
caded from the girl’s clever head. Bride
and ’groom lent a sister apiece for the bridal
retinue, these same rivalling the poppy of the
field in their adornment. Tom Slattery best-
manned, and Anthony Bryant Avas the other
male support. The cake was distributed at
the Carlton.
Pretty Una Pike, of Bradley’s Head, gave
St. Clement’s, of Mosman, a thrill the other
night when she rustled np an aisle on
father’s arm. She was keeping a date Avith
.Tack Cu din ore, of Claremont, Quirindi —
he’s of the third Australian generation of a
Avool-growing clan. The bridal cerements
were folds of silver tissue and lace that
trailed a cloud of tulle as their final word.
Five ’maids attended in ethereal frocking of
shell-pink georgettes and cobAvebby lace.
Bridegroom’s brother best-manned, and Fair-
fax Brown and Garnet Pike Avere ’grooms-
men. Later bride’s mother and father ex-
tended the welcome hand to battalions of
congratulation-bearers at the family eyrie,
Avhere a true-love’s knot in electrics over the
front door made straight the path of the
telegram boy. A marquee that threatened to
blow away at every thudding blast of a gale-
ful night sheltered the Avedding drinks ; and
tin' inevitable jazz followed in the ballroom.
Here is a
picture of the
fresh - eo m-
p.l exion ed Eng-
lirh girl who
is to be Syd-
ney’s chief
Naval hostess
in the new
year. She is
the just-grown-
up daughter of
Oommod ore
Wardle, and
her name is
Jean. She is
something of a
swimmer, and
can sail a boat
with the best,
so Sydney
holds happy
hours for her.
Elocutionist Mary Hosking lately linked
up with Roy Nettlieim, a light of the Mos-
mau Musical Society. Mary, who hails from
Adelaide, was married at the home of her
friend Mrs. Waring, and Avore that lady’s
wedding veil over her own ivory marocains.
Many years ago, in one of _ the great
French academies, sat side by side, chums
as well as class-mates, tAvo cousins named
Thibault. Both were great students, and
each had a facile pen. One became the
world-famous Anatole France, the other that
Dr. Thibault who was for many years a well-
knoAvn figure in Darlinghurst. This shabby
little gentleman in alpaca coat, and wear-
ing surely the smallest straw hat ever made,
could be seen at all hours of the day with
his little bundle of notebooks under his arm
hurrying on his round of French lessons.
Sometimes he would drop a fragment that
spoke a life tragedy. “Me, I should have
stayed in France and been a Avriter, like
my cousin. But no! I looked for adventure.
I come to Australia, and I put my money
in gold-mines. An’, Madame, of the gold-
mines into which I put my money there
was not so much as a ’ole in the ground. '
And then the tired-out old eyes would drop
once more to the strong reading-glass he
always carried. Poor I)r. Thibault! lie
was never to see his beloved France again.
He passed on early this year in the Hospice
for the Dying at Darlinghurst: and now,
only eight months later, his brilliant cousin
has slipped across the Great Divide to join
him. Probably, sitting, on neighboring
cushions of cloud, the two are already col
laborating in some stupendous work.
This is the clever head of Oswald Ander-
son, one of the most prolific and lyric of
Australian song-writers. His song-making
goes back to
1911, when
“Your Dear
Eyes” cap-
tured first the
fancy of this
continent, and
then the ear
of Lond o n.
The first
singer to give
it a vogue was
the tenor Lud-
wig Shelter —
he, incident-
ally, is now in
Italy, study-
ing music and
opera, and, un-
til his big
chance comes,
working by
day in a boot-
store, and by
night filling
small parts and doing chorus work. In pre-
war days he sang Anderson’s song to such
purpose that the proceeds paid the com-
poser’s way to England. In London Peter
Dawson introduced his “Song of Triumph”
to Palladium audiences, and later Hopkin-
son’s, the player-piano firm, engaged him
to demonstrate the wonders of their instru-
ments. He is now king of the player-piano
floor at Paling’s. May Moore made this
picture of him.
That Mrs. Abseil who died a week or so
ago in Mosman mothered a quiverful of girls
who were the Sydney beauties of their time.
One became the wife of artist George Lam-
bert, and another married Arthur Jose, the
writer of a dozen Australian histories.
Poet Henry Kendall’s widow, who died at
Gore I-Iill on Sunday, survived her famous
husband 44 years. The last few of them have
been spent mostly with her daughter, who
helps Angus and Robertson run their lending
library.
How many of Sydney’s young women
were taught dressmaking by that Miss
Roberts who wrote “Finis” to her account
the other day after 57 years of life, 25 ot
which had been spent as chief of the N.SAY.
Technical School of Dressmaking? She was
Victorian born; her father was for years
Director of Education in Tonga.
Mrs. Willie Collins’s dance filled Mac-
leay-street with the - honk of motors on
Friday night. The cheerio, which was in the
nature of a send-off to daughters Dorothea
and Beryl, who sail by the Mooltan for Eng-
land, was staged at Osterley. the Adrian
Knoxes’ Potts Point home, which the Col-
linses have been renting. There were mar-
quees for both dancing and supper, a special
floor having been laid down for the jazz;
and a decorative scheme in apple-green rib-
bons. clusters of arum-lilies and cerise shades
aided a mere moon and a fleckless night.
When the Blue bags were emptied and the
Blue beads counted over in the ballroom of
the Australia on Friday afternoon, the result
announced by Mrs. Ida Charles, beaming
under a primrose-hucd hat, was £2250 for
the Adult Deaf and Dumb Building Fund.
The Blue-bag collection is already famous,
but the idea behind the Blue beads isn’t
so well known. A Blue bead stands for a
prayer of thankfulness for possessing both
speech and hearing. For every shilling
dropped into the fund a Blue bead is threaded
by the girls at the Deaf and Dumb School,
and it is hoped that eventually the chain of
thanksgiving will be long enough to circle
the State. Anyway, on Friday afternoon it
was a very jubilant committee that spread
a tea-party and summoned the different
auxiliaries to rejoice.
Mrs. Kelso King, who is running the Peter
Pan Fair in her garden at Quambi on Novem-
ber 15 in the interests of the Woollalira-
Paddington Boy Scouts, sends out a reminder
that all entrants for the doll-dressing com-
petition must be in not later than November
4. There’s a prize of a guinea each for the
best,. the most originally and the most pret-
tilv froeked.
The Women’s Club has been a hive of in-
dustry. with University women applying
themselves to the addressing of envelopes and
the sticking on of stamps. They are of the
committee that is working to return Con-
stance Elizabeth D’Arcy, M.B., Ch.M., to her
seat on the University Senate. Dr. Con-
stance has already graced it for five years,
and University women think she is worth
putting back. Isabel Vidler, foster-mother
of generations of students, presides over
these plotters; and Violet Reid and Muriel
Swain make their marks as honorary secre-
taries.
The matinee for the free kindergartens on
the 28th is offering as one of its star attrac-
tions an abridged recital of “Paola and
Francesca,” by William Stack. The Pre-
mier's lady is president of a committee of
active workers —among them just-returned
Mrs. Bertie Nelson, who is taking charge of
the sweets. Mrs. Pickburn is the brigand
who is selling the boxes.
Charles Edgbaston is the author of a slim
book of poems, “Blue and Other Verses,”
which has been very favorably reviewed ; and
Dr. Temple Smith, of Macquarie-street, could
tell you who Charles Edgbaston is. The
medical man has a graceful pen and a unique
collection of books and pictures.
Vera Andrews, of Ballina. who was one
of the belles of the Richmond, and until the
other day an instructor at Madame Oli-

street, London, has opened a school of her
own at No. 5 in the same heavily-gilded
region. Vera’s father was for many years
an inspector for the C. S. I‘t. Cos.; when the
war came he joined the A.I.F. and took with
him from the Richmond 29 cane-cutters and
his own son Larry. He now wears an.
M.8.E., and his address is Sudbury, Suffolk.
Larry, after leaving the artillery, became a
solicitor, and is in the legal department
of an English railway co.
A performer who was doing a star turn
at a variety house got the shock of her life
the other night. She had brought down
the gods with a broken-French song and
dance, very cheeky but chic, when suddenly
she looked down at a beautifully-dressed
young man and woman in the front row of
stalls. He Avas bronzed and brushed and
polished to a turn; she was shingled and
marcelled to a miracle. Said the performer,
pointing at the lady: “Madame, will you lend
me your charming ’usband” —here she indi-
cated the tailor-made man —-“to sit on my
knee?” And she patted a silk-hosed knee
AA'hose skirt was miles above it. “Oh. she
can’t lend him,” came a voice as clear as
crystal from the side of the house. “She’s
only got a mortgage on him. He’s really
mine!” When the lights Avent up again the
perfectly-dressed man and woman had faded
away.
A topic or two from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew is at Rockhampton attending the
Ornithologists’ conference. Amongst the eagles
gathered together are A. H. Chisholm and Dr.
Chenery, from .N. S. Wales; M.S.R. Sharland and
Miss Macdonald, from the Apple Isle; and Hilda
Geissman, the Tambourine Mountain girl who Mas
studied bird life since she could toddle, and whose
father was one of the mountain’s pioneers, amongst
the Bananalanders. Dr. Leach (Vic.) opened the
show, and his Ex. was one of the well-informed
speakers. The birds of Central Queensland have
taken on anew air of importance since the meeting.
The membership of the union is now near 600, and
assets are over £2OOO.
The Sunshine girls, all dinkum Aussies, get a
tremendous reception nightly when they say “Good
Morning, Dearie,’’ with their feet at His Majesty’s.
Sir Matthew w-ent out with the George Nathans to
Henley-on-Brisbane in New Farm Park. G. W.
Whatmore gave them tea on the Narwonali. The
innocuous soft drink and the invertebrate ice-cream
were purveyed by the Y.W.C.A., and many of Ih'e
boats had guests aboard. Deputy-Mayor Wilson enter-
tained aldermen and city council on the Ena.
Aladge Blackman said she would to “Toby” Jar-
dine in St. Thomas’s, at Toowong, last week. The
pretty bride’s father, the late Archie Blackman, was
a well-known surveyor here. AA’hite lilies and roses
decorated the altar, with red roses in the chancel,
and a white wedding bell. The bridal gown was
cloth of silver with a train of Brussels net. Joan
Lilley ’maided in Oriental georgette over apiicot,
and a black tulle hat, and T. Logan, of Toowoomba,
bestmanned. Mrs. Blackman spread the wedding
breakfast at her home at Toowong.
Ethel Osborn is adding to her laurels at the
Elite and has had good audiences. Members of the
Austral choir sang “Home, Sweet Home,” at the
soprano, and threw purple-and-gold streamers over
her. The Brisbane AVomen’s Club gave the singer
a tea in the morning, and president Highfleld wel-
comed her. Pink gladioli and gum-tips made a
background for the felicitations.
Vida Lahcy’s show' of paintings in the Empire

Purser, announced as an unlikely starter
in Melbourne on Friday, and quoted at 100 to 1
(offered) at the calling of the card, took his place
in the Caulfield Cup field with Young on top.
It had been reported in the newspapers that the
successful M.L. jockey would ride The Monk,, which
notorious non-stayer was alleged to carry the confi-
dence of the Corteen-Godby stable, but The Monk
was scratched on Saturday morning and Young was
transferred to Purser. Then stable commissioners
got to work and the Sea Prince—Paper Money gelding,
who had 9st. 51b. on his back —-31b. less than his
burden in the A.J.C. Sydney Handicap, in which
he beat a good field over the Caulfield Cup distance
—firmed to 15’s. Simultaneously, shrewd people were
backing him at the Randwick meeting, at the Ascot
course in Brisbane, and doubtless in the other capi-
tals as well, but the generality of punters didn’t
touch him. They believed what they had read in
the newspapers, for the report that Purser was an
unlikely starter had been telegraphed to all parts
of Australia. They also attached importance to the
fact that the animal had started at 20 tq 1 in the
Coongy Handicap, won by Graculus, three days
before, and finished nearer last than first. A few
minutes before the barrier rose at Caulfield there was
any amount of money for the horse that had galloped
badly in the Coongy, brilliantly in the Sydney Handi-
cap, disappointingly in the Metropolitan, and unspeak-
ably in the Spring Stakes, in which, as pointed out in
The Bulletin last week, he finished behind El
Dorado and the mud-fat Tomatin—all in the space
of 11 days. The Hawk was favorite at 9 to 2;
then came Tookarby, Acearak and San Antonio at
10’s; Wallarak at 12’s; Suomi at 14’s; Purser at
15’s; Feathernest, Back wood and All Sunshine at a
point longer; and the others (there were 23
altogether) at from 20 to 100 to 1.
It was a pretty race to watch. Sir Dighloek led
for seven furlongs, with The Hawk, The Night Patrol
and King Carnival handy, Purser, Englefield and
Baekwood being among the rearguard. The three-
year-old continued in charge until they reached the
hill, where The Night Patrol headed him, Purser
meanwhile making up a lot of ground. The vice-
regal colors were first sighted at the entrance to the
straight, with Tookarby, The Hawk and All Sunshine
following, and Purser coming with an irresistible
run. The topweight had the race won at the
distance, and the judge placed him two and a half
lengths ahead of the Westralian Feathernest, who
was always well up, All Sunshine being a neck away.
San Antonio, who had a very bad run, Wynette,
Tookarby, Suomi and Baekwood chased the leaders
home. In ordinary circumstances there would have
been deafening cheers for Purser, who proved him-
self a really great handicap horse —he shattered the
weight-carrying record with liis 9st. 51b., and won
by just as much as Young thought prudent in
2inin. 33sec. —but the crowd was too disgusted to do
anything but growl and curse. The Hawk and
Accarak finished miserably, and Wallarak was never
prominent; but the English pair, Baekwood and The
Night Patrol, ran respectably. Baekwood finished so
well that he drew attention to his Melbourne Cup
prospects. He has Bst. 2lb. in the Flemington event.
Apart from Purser, the most notable performer on
Saturday was Versine. Favorite at sto 2 for the
six-furlongs Windsor Handicap, she got away fairly
well, but received such a buffeting that she fell back
from second to seventh position. At the distance
she was on the rails just behind Valiant, Royal
Thought, Vivanda, Cadorus and Helicopter, who were
practically in line. So Lewis took her to the outside,
and, riding in his usual vigorous style, he landed
her a good winner. Valiant was second and Royal
Thought third ; Cliffdalc, for whom there was. a ton
of Sydney boodle, finished second last. Valiant is
now in the Corteen-Godby stable, and the public was
very glad to see him beaten by the honest daughter
of The Welkin —Celosia. However, his price—33 to 1
—indicates that there wasn’t a pound for him.
“H. Hardupp”: Jack Flannagan, the burly Adel-
aide publican and ex-bookmaker, just got back to
Australia in time to plank some of his surplus
wealth on Purser. He has been making the grand
tour, and his habitual luck stuck to him when abroad ;
he scored substantially at the Monte Carlo tables.
Another fortunate man was a bookmaker’s clerk
who put £3 on at 100 to I—fortunate, because he
was quite blithered when he made the bet.
“Wodgil”: The moral of the Purser business is
that these big betting stables are a nuisance. One
Greenwood, who races for the love of the game, is
worth more to the turf than a ton of gambling
Godbys and Corteens. Still, I have no patience
with these yellow journals that are now foremost in
the howl for the Purser crowd’s, blood. For munee
and munee these newspapers crawled in a sickening
fashion to the people they have been, denouncing so
furiously since the Caulfield Cup—glorified their
unimportant achievements, besieged them with photo-
graphers to get pictures of their uninteresting■ mugs.
There was not a word of criticism in these organs
of an infuriated democracy about Heroic’s queer
inconsistency at Randwick in September—second
last in the Warwick Stakes on the 6th, when there
wasn’t a bob for him, and first in a better field (it
included Gloaming) seven days later, when he was
backed for pounds, shillings and pence. Nor was
there a word of criticism about the sudden improve-
ment shown by Purser on the same course—second
last, at w.f.a., in the 14-mile Spring Stakes, run in
2min. 37sec. (he finished lengths behind El Dorado
and Tomatin and about a length in front of High-
lander, to whom, in ordinary circumstances, he would
have had to concede 2st. 71b.), and first in the
Sydney Handicap, four days later, the weight being
9st. Blb., the price 5 to 2 and the time 2min.
As The Bulletin said last week, the stewards
ought to have asked questions about that remarkable
recovery of form. Had they done so the public
mightn’t have been invited to swallow the grotesque
yarn that The Monk, who couldn’t win a 12-furlongs
Cup with a postage-stamp on his back, was the stable
fancy for Caulfield, and that Purser was only started
• —and heavily backed —as a substitute.

The bad luck which has dogged Marsden,
the Randwick trainer, since the beautiful Furious
died, changed on Saturday, when Prince Woorak,
who races in the nomination of “Sydney Edwards,”
won the £lOOO City Tattersall’s Handicap at 4’s.
Old Julia Grey, one of the outsiders, ran a sur-
prisingly good race, but the Prince, who is by
Woorak—Grey Nurse, had the measure of his field
a furlong from home, and would have beaten Julia
by much more than a neck had his jockey contrived
to steer a less erratic course. Inia’s Boy, who is
beginning to show a liking for a distance, was a
good third, but the favorite, Sea Risk, ran poorly.
The Maoriland-bred Parody (12’s) did McShortodds a
good turn by downing Bairn, a nice Linacre filly in
Kelso’s stable, in the Flying Handicap ; and Malurys
(10’s) further be-
friended the victim of
circumstances who
never shows a profit
by accounting for Earl
Liddell, the promising
Mountain Chief and
Rahiri (a 5 to 4 favor-
ite) in the Club Wel-
ter. It was the black
gelding’s first success
at Rand wick, although
he ran second in the
1920 Derby to the re-
cently-defunct Salitros.
He hasn’t done much
racing, being difficult
to train.
FRANK DEMP-
SEY, the leading
Vic. jockey, who
is going to try his
luck in England.
“Wingella”: The Northern Territory is
not so broke that, it can’t go racing like its brethren
in the South. There was a two-days' meeting at
Darwin in September, and over £lOOO went through
the machine. The Centenary Cup proved a gift for
Aeroflight, a gelding only recently imported into
the Territory. But there was a great finish in the
Ladies’ Bracelet, Batchelor, a grey, and Wombat, a
chestnut, battling neck and neck up the straight.
Batchelor lasted longer and won by half a head in
the opinion of nearly everyone; the exception was the
judge, who awarded the race to Wombat. No one
was more surprised than the rider of the winner, who
was handsomely congratulating Batchelor's jock, on the
latter’s splendid win, when his own number went up.
There were some rousing speeches at the settling
as to what the Darwin meetings were doing for
the improvement of the thoroughbred. Seventeen
of the 20 starters were geldings.

“Nitric”: Luck comes and goes. At a
Diggers’ race meeting in Charleville (Q.) a lad named
Easton rode five winners. The trophies were presented
that, night, but when the boy’s name was called
he refused to go up to receive his baubles. His
friends tried to overcome his bashfulness, but Easton
ran out from the hall —to be knocked down by a
motor-car and seriously injured. The lad is a son
of a well-known Ipswich trainer, and has done excel-
lently in amateur races since he was a schoolkid
of 12.

An English sportsman has had a scries
of surprises in South Aus. He claimed to have made
various bets with a bookmaker at Gawler races.
Not getting a settlement over one bet which he won,
he complained to the police, am) then charged the
bookie with the statutory offence* of “having been
present for the purpose of unlawfml betting by way
of wagering.” Asked in Court whether he had
paid over when he made the bet, he replied: “I
come from Manchester; we don’t pay money until
the goods are delivered.” The S.M., who apparently
had not heard of betting “on the nod,” remarked that
bookmakers in England must be more confiding than
here; and told the astonished Englishman that he
himself had equally broken S.A. law by making any
wager not in the totalisator. After which the accused
party swore that there had been no betting at all,
only a friendly conversation on the chances of a
race or two; and the matter, being one of oath
against oath, was dismissed.

"Hamer ’: When the Vic. “Pigeon Derby”
was flown recently there were only a couple of
seconds between the first and second birds, and it was
thought that a record had been established by the
winner, which flew the 300 miles at the rate of'lBlo
yards per minute. A hunt among the archives showed,
however, that 1962 yards p.m. was put un over 396
miles (Morgan, S.A., to Melbourne) in 1917. E. G.
Staples was the breeder and owner of the bird which
achieved that feat, as well as of this year’s “Derbv”
winner.

The £lOO attached to this year’s N.S.W.
King’s Prize went to C. E. Elsley, a young rifleman
from Quirindi (N.S.W.), whose aggregate was 366
very good in the circumstances, for the conditions
were against high scores. W. Davidson, of Colling-
wood, got second
money with a total of
364, and F. Travers,
of Mosman, was next
with 360. Miss J. Snod-
grass, a smiling, buxom
girl from Rockhampton
(Q.), earned some pin-
money with the credit-
able score of 350. In
the service matches
Mosman-Neutral Bay

General’s Cup, the

pany Challenge Bugle

A. J. ROBERTS,
president of the
South Aus. Lawn
Tennis Association.
George Dawson, old-time Australian light-
weight, was welcomed back to Sydney on Saturday
by Mick Dunn, “Chiddy” Ryan, Jack Fuller, Jim
Barron and other boxers of his day. George went
to California in January, 1892, and remained there
as a boxing instructor after a brilliant career in the
ring. He lives at Altadena, near Los Angeles, and
proposes to return there after a world-tour, on
which h: is accompanied by his wife and two child-
ren. “There are no pugs like the old pugs,” the
former champion says. “Dempsey is not as good
as Peter Jackson was ; I don’t rate him as high! as
Slavin or Joe Goddard. Leonard is cleyer, but he
is not in the same street as Griffo.”

“O. McKay M.”: Melbourne’s ’Varsity
parcelled out its sporting bay and laurel when 85
bright youths were named for their blues. Mitchell
and Haskei' were doubly decorated for the second
time, both haying starred in inter-varsity cricket and
football during the last two seasons. J. B. Turner,
who did so well for Trinity in this year’s inter-
collegiate tennis, received his reward, along with lan
Mclnnes, the Davis Cup colt, and H. F. C. Hallowes,
a returned-soldier student of Trinity, who had the
bad luck to contract pneumonia just before the inter-
collegiate contests. Nobody deserved his place among
the elect more than R. H. Iveon Cohen, stroke of the
M.V.B.C. eight that won the junior-senior champion-
ship of Tasmania, and of the Winning Trinity and
’Varsity crews. It is five years since Keon Cohen,
now a prominent figure in Victorian rowing, smashed
all records) by qualifying for a double blue (rowing
and athletics) in his freshman year. A. S. Fitzpatrick,
of Queen’s, whose blue in athletics is an annual
affair, went to London a few weeks back with a
scholarship of the Imperial College of Science and
Technology.
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: Complaints by members of
Australia’s Olympic team that food arrangements in
Paris were unsatisfactory put me in mind of the
R.N. rules on the subject. Sport in the Navy is
probably more uncompromisingly amateur than in
any other body. The great annual event is the
Squadron or Fleet pulling regatta, the prizes for
which are certainly cash, but in sums which amount
to little more in value than the Roman laurel
wreath. An invariable rule is that men shall not
be allowed to mess together for training purposes.
Preparation is done on the ordinary naval rations.
In between sports and regatta fixtures time is found
for challenge boatraces. Betting is illegal, but
large sums of money frequently change hands. One
man in each ship collects, and the other side covers
or not as it pleases; an officer generally holds the
stakes during the race. I remember in 1911 at
Gibraltar acting as judge and stakeholder during a .
race between a 14-oared cutter from the Suffolk and
another from, I think, the Triumph. The course was
across the Bav from Algeciras to Gibraltar, just
four miles; and four miles in a heavy cutter weighing
about half a ton, and propelled by heavy ash oars,
is no sort of joke. Fifteen hundred of the best
changed hands.

Clem Hill captained the Australians who
played N. S. Wales on the Sydney Cricket Ground
for Bill Howell’s benefit—which benefit is expected
to yield £lOO0 —and helped his side with an admir-
able 40. He ran smartly between the wiejeets, and
jumped out to the slow bowling- with considerably
greater agility than w’as shown by some of the
younger cricketers; yet the man has been years out
of the game and will be 48 on March 18. Ratcliffe
top-scored with a first-class 161, made in 252 minutes,
and kept wickets excellently. But the eleven would
have got an awful doing had the the match been
played to a finish; its scores were 310 and eight
for 142 against 645. Collins (106), Taylor (111),
K.ippax (115), Kelleway (101) and Bardsley (90)
did most of the scoring for N. S. Wales, and
nothing could have been prettier than the partner-
ship of Ivippax and Taylor; Bardsley, however, was
badly missed by Hill before he had made 40. But
the bowling, apart from Mailey’s—the googly took
10 for 169—was only so-so. Gregory sent in fast-
medium stuff for nine overs, but failed to take a
wicket. If his leg stands, lie will have to be
included in the first Australian eleven to meet the
Englishmen, but it is quite on the cards that he
will be less useful this season than the Victorian
'' allaee. Taylor is batting so well and is such a

For clean reform, the critics storm,
The turf was never riper.
It may be so. Meanwhile —heigh-ho I
The public pays the piper.
The ring, when hit, may groans emit
And Semite brows grow black there,
But though one nag from out the bag
An unexpected wad may drag
Ten more will put it back there.
The tote, ’tis clear, has nought to fear
From massed assault or sniper;
But when the schooled in guile are fooled
The public pays the piper.
Oh, bright and soon some call the tune
They’d have the band a-strununing,
And some devise, contrariwise,
A brisk eleventh-hour surprise
To set the shrewdies humming.
For guide, above the gentle dove,
They set the wily viper,
And then —the bill is heavier still,-,
The public pays the piper.

MOTOR OIL
The British-owned Lubricant
with the World-wide Reputation,
specified by 160 of the leading British
Continental and American Motor-car
Manufacturers, is the oil which holds 64
out of 65 unbroken world’s records made
on Brooklands during the last eleven
years.
It has lubricated the engines of the
machines doing the great world flights.
Famous International Motor and
Motor-cycle Races have been, for many
years, “Castrol” triumphs.
But “Castrol” is more than a great
racing oil. It is the finest of all lubricants
for general touring.
Experienced motorists in all parts of the world have
proved this. Many of them once used ordinary oils.
The fact of once having used the alleged “just-as-good
made them keenly appreciate the unvarying excellence
of "Castrol.”

An Extra Pulley
Fitted in Five Minutes.
There have doubtless been times when an extra pulley on the
shaft would have proved invaluable—but it was felt inadvis-
able to stop the particular line shaft because it would hold up
production too long.
This difficulty can easily be surmounted NOW, for the
problem is solved by the
V

SPLIT BELT PULLEY
which can be completely fitted on to line-shaft in
five minutes—by one man.
The SKF Split Pulley combines efficiency, economy
and “safe” and reliable service, is light but strong, and
distinctly the most advanced transmission pulley
appliance of to-day.

Smooth Performance
A marked smoothness characterises
the performance of Dodge Brothers
Motor Car.
In keeping with the policy of con-
stant improvement, effective measures
have been taken to minimise vibra-
tion. Applied to the body, engine,
clutch, brakes, and other vital units,
these refinements add immeasurably
to the comfort of travel over boule-
vards and country roads.
The effect is so pronounced, in fact,
that it is entirely fitting to classify
smooth performance as one of the out-
standing attributes of Dodge Brothers
Motor Car.

The new secretary to the S.A. Harbor
' Board is It. G. Peake, nephew of a former
State Premier of the name. Much of his
work has been done on the railways, though
when S.A. maintained the Northern Terri-
tory Jumbo he was auditor, paymaster, and
later s.m. at Darwin.
The Master Process Engravers lost their
first president when Sydney Willouchby
Bacon died a few days ago at G 4. An Eng-
lishman, he had travelled far and wide in pur-
suit of his calling, finally anchoring in Syd-
ney, where he founded the firm of Bacon and
Go., and interspersed business with yachting.
Mother Raphael Deasy, of Rathfarnum,
near Dublin, is at present in Sydney on a
world’s tour of the Convents of the Loretto
Order. Some idea of the magnitude of the
task can be gathered from the fact that she
has been on the road five years, and is not
finished yet. The N. S. Wales headquarters
of the Loretto Order are at Kirribilli.
“Stellsby”: “Prof.” W. Beaumont, the
tank-swimmer who broke all records by stay-
ing under water 4min. 35isec. at Melbourne
on December 16, 1893, was born to die a dry
death. He passed out recently at Talycain,
North Wales. ITis tally for dinkum saves
from drowning was 117. But, then, anyone
could be saved by clinging to Beaumont's
beautiful moustache.
“Landa”: The orginal contents of plates
found in coffins (B. 2/10/’24) were more
often chloride of lime than plain salt.
Before the days of quick burials it was
customary to keep cadavers till Sunday
afternoons, to give everyone a chance of
attending the final ceremony. Chloride of
lime was a good friend to the visitors upon
the corpse in such circumstances.
“Herodot” : The city has no monopoly of
guile. At a country show recently an exhibi-
tor gained several prizes for the heaviest
duck-eggs shown. After he had departed
with his winnings a suspicious official, first
subjecting the eggs to scrutiny under a micro-
scope and then holding an autopsy, satisfied
himself that mercury had been injected into
them, the hole having been so skilfully closed
up again that it was indiscernible by the
naked eye. All that the committee could do
was to cancel the prize-certificates and
award them to the exhibitors next on the list.
A boy who sold papers in Melbourne had
an ambition to be a farmer, and he became a
successful one by a keen struggle to turn
what was once regarded as almost worthless
land to profit—he had to clear the land prac-
tically by himself, and laboriously cart the
water he required for irrigation purposes.
That newsboy was ex-Minister Stewart
whose farm at Carwarp, in the Mallec, is a
tribute to his force and energy, lie has a
proper system of irrigation now, and his farm
is as near a model as it is possible to make
it. Last month the Department held a “field
day” on an experimental plot on his farm
to demonstrate what can be done with irri-
gation, the use of fertilisers and the planting
of cross-bred wheat. The affair must have
inspirited Stewart: it was after it that he
launched his attack on Page.
_ Norfolk Island in its earliest days pro-
vided wives for several officials ’who later
settled in N. S. Wales. There D’Arcy Went-
worth, an overseer of prisoners, met his
destined helpmate, Miss Catherine Parry.
Lt. William Lawson, of the N. S. Wales
Corps, found a bride on the island in Miss
Sarah Leadbeater. Captain Piper, of the
same corps, acquired one iu a Miss Shearer,
the daughter of a settler. Another official
who married a N.I. girl—and made her a
countess —was a certain Pery, whose matri-
monial choice was Miss Sheaffer, daughter
of a lieutenant in the 50th Regiment, then
stationed on the island. Pery, afterwards
Earl of Limerick, was Clerk to the Com-
mandant, Colonel Anderson ; it was a son of
theirs, afterwards a N. S. Wales p.m., who
died the other day.
A war between Britain and the U.S.A.
seems such a preposterously unthinkable
thing nowadays that it is hard to realise
lu>w imminent it looked to some people less
than 30 years ago. In Theodore Roose-
velt’s “Letters to His Sister” (Anna), ex-
tending over a long period of years and now
being published in the Saturday Evening
Post, there is this, penned in December, ’95.
when relations between the two countries
were becoming strained over the Venezuelan
boundary question:—
I earnestly hope our Government don’t back down.
If thero is a muss I shall try to have a hand in ;t
myself. They’ll have to employ a lot of men just
as green as I am for the conquest of Canada....
It seems to me that if England were wise she would
fight now; we couldn’t get at Canada until May, and
meanwhile she could play havoc with our coast cities
and shipping.
Six years later the writer of that was Pre-
sident of the United States.
“Verri”: That elastic old document, the
Treaty of Waitangi, was used to good pur-
pose by the Arawa tribe (M.L.), whose
stronghold is around Rotorua, when it de-
manded from the Government compensation
for the forfeiture of all rights in the Rotorua
lakes. The lakes consist of the well-known
group, Rotorua, Rotoiti, and several smaller
ponds, and their value to the Dominion as
fishing and tourist resorts is now immense.
As to-day no really respectable Government
cares to regard its treaties as scraps of paper,
the Arawas’ demand was investigated, with
the result that that tribe receives henceforth
£6OOO per year. The first idea was to dis-
tribute the money in the tribe, but wiser
counsels prevailed, and the amount will be
allotted to tribal objects—education, improve-
ment of settlements, hospitals, agriculture
and the encouragement of Maori art. The
last item is the most interesting. Maori art
is at low ebb, and unless immediate action
is taken all the native teachers will
pass away and the knowledge of their art
will perish with them. An enthusiast named
Neilson induced the Maoris to make for him
a wonderful carved house, which was for
years one of the attractions at Rotorua. The
German Government offered a large sum for
the treasure, but Neilson gave the M.L. Gov-
ernment the option of purchase at a much
lower figure. The Government, while declin-
ing to purchase, brought in the bill prohibit-
ing the export of Maori curios and works of
art. Neilson had the house dismantled and
shipped before the bill could be rushed
through. Thus one of the most valuable
works in the land passed into an alien
museum.

A pleasant picture of life kept from becom-
ing too saccharine by the acid of Jaques’s
cynicism—that was “As You Like It, pre-
sented by Allan Wilkie at the Palace, Syd-
ney, on Thursday evening. This Sundry
Showman has seldom lieai’d such unre-
strained laughter as greeted the work of
Irene Webb and Beresford Fowler as
Audrey and William. Miss Hunter-Watts’s
delineation of the frank and unsubtle Rosa-
lind was outstanding, and Leslie Manners
as Orlando showed that a man can fall in
love without losing his sense of humor or
qualifying for the mental hospital. Three
hundred years of dust have failed to choke
the human interest of this play, and it was
only for the famous lines of Jaques about
the seven ages, adequately declaimed by-
Allan Wilkie, that the awedience assumed
that expression of religious fervor which is
propei - iu the presence of masterpieces
approved by the ages.
P* * *
Five years or so ago John D. O’Hara
first caught Sydney playgoers with the humor
of Lightnin’ Bill Jones, the old wastrel with
a touch of human appeal about him that was
hard to resist. Now John and Bill have
together come hack to the Criterion to drily
suggest pathos with an art that conceals
itself. The changes that have been made in
the cast are generally for the better. Maggie
Moore is the wife of the old reprobate; and
nobody living can suggest the kind heart
better than she. As the Judge, an Ameri-
can type of jurist from whom Providence
lias been pleased to deliver this country.
George Blunt does excellent work; Ailsa
Graliame, as Margaret Davis’ plays the Cali-
fornian equivalent of a woman of fashion :
and Mildred Buckley is in the capable hands
of Mary Macgregor.
“Whirled into Happiness” is in its seventh
week of exhilarating rotation at Sydney
Majesty’s.
In succession to “Little Nellie Kelly.” at
Sydney Opera House, “The O’Brien Girl”
reappears on Saturday for a two-weeks’ sea-
son. The colleens are near relations.
"OLD BILL, M.P.,” AT MELBOURNE
NEW PALACE.
Old Bill's cobbers —Bert (Fank Hathcrley)
and Alf (Brandon Cremer).
“The Cousin from Nowhere” continues
to blow into Sydney Royal, and to have a
much more joyous time than Perkin War-
beck. Arthur Orton and some other im-
postors.
Three strangers arrived at Sydney Tivoli
from England last Saturday. The pick of
them was Harry Weldon —no half-baked com-
edian, but an artist whose burlesoues would
raise a laugh in a mortuary parlor. As a
talkative bullfighter lie was a scream, but
lie scored his best points as a prize-fighter,
palpably out of condition, yet introduced by
his foghorn-voiced manager as England’s
“white hope.” His sparring exercises and
bout with an opponent were an excellent
caricature of present-day ringcraft. Hilda
Glvder is a dainty little maid who wears a
number of charming frocks. Iler singing is
insipid, but her dancing has a kick in it.
The third of the voyagers, Reg Wentworth,
is a young man, so he will probably grow
out of his bad habits. Beryl Beresford
and Walter* Weems remain the best of the
older performers.
A scrap on a blazing vessel in mid-ocean
is keeping Sydney Lyceum audience from
falling asleep this week. The interest is
carried right to the finish, where a distracted
woman propels herself into the other world.
The extra, “The Call of Home,” has its
thrills, too; also, Maggie Foster, well known
to Tivoli clients,, is making her violin sing.
The Lyric is pushing to the front “Daugh-
ters of To-Day,” which, besides roasting
the child who dabs Ashes of Roses on her
cheeks, grills the parent who allows her to
do it. “Dr. Mabuse,” at the Crystal Palace,
is a super-evildoer, with an alius and a dis-
guise for every day in the year, and a habit
of flirting in between jobs. “Six-Cylinder-
Love,” the Kmpress’s latest brand of the
tender passion, is merely an elaboration, of
Mr. Micawber’s excursion into economics.
Dorothy Dalton is the leading figure at the
Globe, where she is caught red-handed by
the C.T.D. in the act of opening a safe.
“For Sale.” at Hoyt’s, says nothing new;
but “Young Ideas” is a novel film with sur-
prises following each sub-title.
There has been a reshuffle of arrangements
for Melbourne theatres. % Muriel Starr is
not now to do the Adelaide season which
was to follow the closing of her term at the
King’s. Instead, she moves across to the
Royal, where she reintroduces “The Silent
Witness” to a public which has embraced
her. curious voice and all. Perhaps it is
felt that an actress who persistently takes
the wrong turning is the best sort to redeem
a, theatre which has frivolled into vaude-
ville for a while. Irene Vanbrugh will fol-
low Muriel Starr at the King’s.
“Old Bill, M.P.,” continues to get the
popular vote at the New Palace, Melbourne ;
at the New Princess’s “Rosie O'Reilly” still
rises; and at Hi's Majesty’s “The Lady of
the Rose” remains in bloom.
Bert Levy finishes his Melbourne season
to-morrow night. He was to have gone to
Adelaide then, but he has begged off that
trip in order to have a week with Melbourne
friends. Adelaide is missing quite a lot.
Meantime Scott and Whaley, changing their
acts with commendable frequency, continue
to provide the medicine which is most likely
to do the doctor out of a job.
The Melbourne Theatre Royal celebrated
its last week of “variety” by introducing a
fraction of the Grand Opera Co.; and a
properly awed audience applauded at the
right places. But. it rose to something like
enthusiasm when Luigi Ceresol rendered the
familiar Toreador song from “Carmen,”
although, honestly, the house under other
circumstances would have demanded much
more “beef.” On Saturday the Royal will
turn back to its old life, and probably try to
forget that it was for three months a vaude-
ville house, although the vaudeville was very
good whilst it lasted.
Last week's municipal concert at the Mel-
bourne Town Hall (these affairs, generally
excellent, happen monthly) was responsible
for the surprise appearance of a 13-year-old
boy-violinist, Kingsley Parkes, who stirred
the audience with Alard’s “Valse Brillant”
and Deberiot’s “Fantasia.” Three years ago
the youngster filled an emergency hole in a
Liedertafel concert, and gathered the patron-
ising applause which is due to youthful
genius. On the present occasion the absence
of Gertrude Ilealy gave him his opportunity,
and the boy showed that his former promise
has developed amazingly. Even although
Walter Kirby was present and sang five songs
in excellent voice, Rachmaninoff’s “In the
Silence of the Night” being most bewitch-
ing, the young violinist was the star that
the most talk was about.
It isn’t the same world, even for circuses.
Gone are the days when they burst upon a city
with booming band and caparisoned elephants:
Melbourne won’t permit even the most ami-
able elephant to be on the streets after 7
a.m. For all that, the pull of the age-
old entertainment filled the roomy Olympia
last Saturday with a crowd of children,
some of them under 21, eager to be amused.
And the amusement was there. A circus
used to be largely feats of horsewoman ship
and aerial-trapeze acts, liberally garnished
with tights and spangles; but tights and
spangles have largely gone, and a greater
diversity of programme has come. Pro-
fessor Betts’s seals, monkeys, dogs and roost-
ers, an agreeable combination which gets
along with much greater amity than a grand
opera co., brought some interesting andj
astonishing tricks to light: a star humorous
item was the disgusted manner in which a
monkey, handed a small fish as a reward of
virtue, threw it to one of the seals. Paul
Warton and co. did some extraordinary
acrobatic work Avitli tbe aid of a spring-
board ; Paul de Boult and a partner pro-
vided the touch of devilry in a trapeze act;
there were the usual finished horse turns;
and Prince Giuseppe Bigonglii added to his
value as a quaint human exhibit some feats
on horseback with considerable humor at-
tached. Having inspected the liberal box

lady with musical ambitions.
of tricks, .Join) Public went away vowing
to bring young Jack to see the show—a very
excellent excuse for having another look.
Hoyt’s Dc Luxe is essaying this week to
tell “Why Men Leave Home”; and the
domestic problem is coupled with “Riders
Up,” a racing him suited to Melbourne’s
present atmosphere. A film that does not
spoil a good book-story as much as usual
is “Babbitt,” at the Majestic. Two femi-
nine frills to the ordinary picture shows,
Kitty Reidy and Louise Lovely, are in the
firmament, the former at Hoyt’s suburban
theatres.
A water-colorist’s show:—
Without exhibiting anything particular]'- dirt’-
guished, E. W. Sturgess, whose water-colors will
drape the walls of the Melbourne Athenaeum Hail
until October 26, has presented a remarkably even
collection of 66 paintings; pretty affairs, treated
painstakingly, whose very prettiness makes them
tiresome in the mass. It is in illustrating the
moods of evening that he gets his best effects—
as in “The Last Gleam” and “Departing Day.”
Separately, there is not a picture in the whole lot
that would not make an agreeable wall-decoration
in anyone’s home. But when that is said, all is said.
About a man who ill-treats horses: —
The show of Allan Bernardo at the Sackvillo
Gallery, Melbourne, has some more than tolerable
features; but the young artist’s pricing of his
paintings shows a curious misjudgment. In most of
the efforts for which his demands on patrons re
exceedingly modest there is much pleasing work;
but his “biggest” canvases are his biggest failures.
In “Early Morning in the Desert” he shows cour-
age in tackling a difficult subject, and tackling it
rather well; but the legs of his horse in the fore
ground are almost a hanging matter. And in “Going
to Market” the load of hay looks more like almost
anything else. Yet one feels that this artist is
clever; and where he fails he does it in attempting
something really good.
** * *
Adelaide Royal lias subsided placidly from
the excitement of the opera season to a
variety bill, in which Bert Errol’s female
impersonations get the most notice, though
the best art is shown by Charlotte Parry
in her one-woman drama of many charac-
ters. A similar show is at the Majestic,
with Con Moreni providing about half of it,
and Fuller’s Wonder children giving an
attractive turn. Clive Carey, of the Con-
servatorium, has given an agreeable recital
of about 30 songs, and really good concerts
are beyond enumeration. In Pictures, West's
goes to Rome with Hall Caine’s “Eternal
City,” and Wondergraph to Paris with Pola
Negri in the “Shadows” of the same; the
York is also very French, with Barbara La
Marr in “The White Moth.” The Pav.,
however, sticks to the U.S.A., with an ex-
citing Fire Patrol on the waterfront.
“P. Pinktape” : An Australian actor now
doing well in America once had a cruel ex-
perience of how scandal drifts round in the
theatrical world. His final appearance in
Australia was a tragedy which definitely
ended his opportunities in this country; but,
crossing the Pacific, he cured his tendency
for going on the burst, and, in process of
time, was cast for a good part in a New
York theatre, at 400 dahlers per week. Be-
fore the play was staged, however, he was
sent for by the manager. “Cheque for four
weeks’ salary in lieu of notice,” said that
functionary, presenting the document. “It
has come to our knowledge,” he went on,
“that in a taown called Perth you had the
curtain pulled down on you,” and the actor
had to admit that it was so. Superseded by
an understudy, he had wakened to hear his
lines being spoken on the stage, and, going
on. had insisted on making the part a duet.
“Sorry, bo,” concluded the s.m., “but we
ken’t take a risk in a Broadway tlieayter.”
That was a big setback, but the actor stiff-
ened his sinews and got going again to such
purpose that he now holds a steady and
lucrative job in a representative company.
“Lud”: Diana Wilson and Dorothy Sea-
combe were in the cast of “The Royal Visi-
tor,” which Asche had to withdraw from Lon-
don Her Majesty’s after the shortest run of
the year—a year notable for quick exits of
new plays. Until “The Royal Visitor”
arrived and departed “A Perfect Fit,” an
English version of the Hungarian farce
known here as “The Tailor-made Man,” had
the record for brevity; it disappeared at the
end of a week and a half. But at least a
dozen other pieces came off in less than six'
weeks from the time they went on. Theatri-
cal folk say that Londoners, when you get
them inside a playhouse, are the easiest
people in the world to please, but the diffi-
culty is to get ’em inside.
“Hamfat” : There are more pirates in the
vaudeville profession than in any other.
Nearly every headliner who arrives in Aus-
tralia finds that his choicest stuff lias been
pinched and done to death, copyright being
no protection. Aud the pirate is even more
rampant in other countries. Australian
Bert Levy was dogged by a brigand who called
himself Lert Bevy, and who, because Bert
wears a beard, carried a chin covering which
draped to his waist. The exasperated original
got his lawyers to work at last, and the
Court obliged with a prohibition order or
something of the sort, but the chances are
that Bevy is still doing Levy’s business in
some part of the world where Uncle Sam’s
writ doesn’t run or even dawdle.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : How many Australian
playgoers can remember the visit of Walter
Montgomery? He was not an actor of genius,
but he had a handsome stage presence and
was an accomplished elocutionist. He shone
in several Shakspearean roles, notably Ham-
let and Romeo, and achieved a theatrical
record in England by playing Romeo to six
different Juliets in one week. One of them,
the veteran Mrs. Kendal (Madge Robertson),
is still to the fore. Montgomery came to a
tragic end a few weeks after his return from
his Australian tour. He married in London,
and on the second day of the honeymoon shot
himself in his room at Clifford-street, off
Piccadilly. There was a story that a love
affair with an Australian girl -who followed
him to London had something to do with
the catastrophe. Among his contemporaries
in Australia were Sir William and Lady Don.
AT MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Rich Hayes, the lazy clown, and partner.
She was a professional actress (Florence
Saunders) and he had been a member of
the vice-regal staff in Dublin Castle, where
he distinguished himself in amateur theatri-
cals —so much so that he was persuaded to
join the profession. Don was a fine figure
of a man, and uncommonly tall. In comic
pieces at the Melbourne Royal a table was
always placed in his path at liis first entrance
so that he might step over it in one gigan-
tic stride and thereby gain a loud guffaw
from pit and gallery. He died suddenly in
Hobart, while having a little holiday after
o <.rroni,oi'<> spfison in Melbourne.

MILL’S HATS amply justify the extraordinary

“Abbot P.”: At the latest of Melba’s last
appearances a programme-rustler in my
neighborhood bored me by shrilly declaring
that the diva’s merits had never been recog-
nised by her countrymen till she had made
a reputation abroad. This is a widely-held
belief, but there is nothing in it. I recall
a concert at the Melbourne Town Hall in
1885, when “the pure and resonant soprano,
to which there seems no limi,t in compass, so
easy is the production,” was justly appreci-
ated by a journalist of the period. The
occasion was the first showing in Australia
of Clay’s “Lalla Rookh,” and other soloists
were Armes Beaumoiit, Madame Boema
and Gordon Gooch, with L. L. Lewis, who
married Rosa Dunn, conducting. Then
there were appearances with the Sydney
Philharmonic and other representative socie-
ties, on one of which occasions Melba was
called “Australia’s foremost soprano.” The
Voice wasn’t then at its highest stage of
development, but to say that the public was
insensible to its beauty is simply not true.
“V.V.”: “F.L.H.” (B. 9/10/’24), in re-
ferring to Harrison having taken up the
part of Nanki-Poo at the premiere of “The
Mikado” in Melbourne owing to Boyle’s
“indisposition,” suggests that Harrison re-
hearsed the role that same morning, and
asserts that Howard Vernon was his autho-
rity. Here is the story as told in Vernon’s
“Recollections” :
The first night of Cellier’s conductorship was full
of incident. Bovle, a tenor imported from England
for the production of “lolanthe,” was the Nanki-Poo.
Poor Frank Boyle was unable to appear. What
was to be done? A house packed with excited
people, a cultured musical director’s first appearance,
all the performers in a semi-hysterical state, and
J. C. Williamson more so than anybody. In those
days J.O. was a wicked man when strongly wrought.
Everyone was distracted, when, lo and behold ! a
saviour dropped into the picture. Hairy Fowle
Harrison, who had been conductor of the opera in
Sydney, suggested in the meekest of tones that he
knew the part, and was ready for the emergency.
Williamson looked at him with that half-closed-eye
expression of his, and said “Well, then, do it,” and
walked away.
It was hardly possible for Harrison to have
rehearsed the part without the knowledge
of some members of the company. But a
rehearsal may have heen called the morn-
ing after the premiere.
“Pussyfoot”: The chorus gent, is to have
another lease of life, according to a J.C.W.
advt. in recent Sydney newspapers: “Wanted
Twenty Young Handsome Chorus Men.”
Nothing is mentioned about their ability to
sing; but youth and beauty are essential.
Such a galaxy is liable to distract attention
from the flashing limbs of the flappers in the
ballet; and surely such opposition is not in
the best interests of Art!
“Ibseusliaw”: The young and enterprising
Sydney Players’ Club proposes to show us
Zangwill’s “Melting Pot.” Curious that the
piece has not been tried here before. It has
had a good reception in both America and
England, though of course its central idea
appeals more to U.S.A. audiences, for whom
it was written. I think the last Zangwill
play seen in Australia was the sentimental
comedy “Merely Mary Ann,” with Tittell
Brune in the title part, and that is many
years ago.
From the land of sudden elections: —
Oscar Asche is arranging with George Grossmith
and Malone to revive “Kismet” and “Chu Chin Chow”
at His Majesty’s. Lily Brayton, who lias been
living in retirement during Oscar’s absence in Aus-
tralia, will reappear in these revivals. Which sug-
gests that the alleged breach isn’t as wide as it
was alleged to be, or doesn’t exist at all.
Lee White and Clay Smith are taking a company
to Australia, but by a more circuitous route than is
usually followed. The co. will show at Gibraltar,
Cairo, Bombay, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singapore, Hong
Kong and Manila. Then it will go to Sydney.
Bernard Shaw is having a go at the American
film-fakers, whose “rampant conceit and lack of
good sense” annoy him. “They simply don’t know
how to behave themselves,” says G. 8.5., and he
suggests acidly that all American aspirants to film
work should be sent to Sweden or Denmark, where
they will have a chance of being civilised, before
they are allowed to enter a Los Angeles studio.
American pitchers are characterised by “hideous
make-ups, overdone and foolishly repeated strokes of
expression, extravagant expenditure upon effects that
I or any other competent producer could secure
quickly at a cost of 10 cents, featureless, over-
exposed faces against under-exposed backgrounds,
vulgar and silly sub-titles, and impertinent lists of
everybody employed in the film, from the star actress
to the press-agent’s office-boy.” Shaw’s idea is that
the invention of movie plays should be confined to
“original imaginative visualisers,” whatever they
may be.
“Ca:sar’s Ghost”: Crummies is dead, but
his soul is marching on. Witness the an-
nouncement after the “gala night” at His
Majesty’s. Melbourne, that for the delecta-
tion of the common herd the decorations
would remain on view for several nights.
QUEER HOW EXPERIENCES DIFFER.
VISITOR: “So you are my wife's painting-teacher. How docs she impress you as a
student?”
ARTIST: “I find her very apt, to say the least.”
VISITOR : “ That's remarkable. I find her very apt to say the most.”
Also, by way of squeezing the last ounce of
value out of the grand-opera boom, the re-
mains of the co. are being split into sections
and sent wherever they may gather shekels.
One of the sections, including Gapelli, Ceresol
and Aurora Rettore, is in vaudeville. Then
a concert party, which includes Granforte,
Piccaluga, Phyllis Archibald and Augusta
Concato, has gone to Geelong, and is to give a
concert at the Melbourne Town Hall on Satur-
day. Subsequently a smaller opera co. made
up of the fragments is to tour M.L. and the
as yet unvisited Australian towns. Some-
how the business reminds me of Alfred Dam-
pier and a line of blue shirts that he. bought
cheap and insisted upon dragging into all
kinds of productions until a misanthropic
assistant-s.m. announced that they had been
cut down into vests. I can still hear Alf
wailing about “those beautiful b-lue shirts.”
“Centurion”: “Caesar’s GKost” (B.
16/10/’24) questions whether cavalry offi-
cers would swank into a lady’s drawing-room
with a whip, as the Colonel does in "The
Lady of the Rose.” Thirty years ago Eng-
lish cavalry officers invariably carried cut-
ting whips when they went about in uniform.
“Caesar’s Ghost” will doubtless recall
Pinero’s “Dandy Dick.” I have a vivid re-
collection of the cutting whips borne by
the two asinine, cavalry subalterns who, in
their blue frogged “frocks” and pillbox caps,
called on the Dean’s daughters. The stage
detail was true to fact, as it was in all the
Pinero productions.
“No Importa”: Mario, elder son of the
Majeronis, theatrical stars of other days, is
reported dead in the U.S.A. Mario and his
brother George were trained by their parents
for the stage, and were minor luminaries
in the Brough and Boucicault constellation
for a time. In America Mario deserted the
legitimate stage for the movies; a picture
in which lie had a part is appearing in Mel-
bourne at present. He married Nellie Har-
bin, a pretty Sydney girl, who predeceased
him.
“Hamfat”: “The Deacon’s” par. about
Lytton’s aeroplane show (B. 16/10/’24) re-
minds me of the airship in “A Flight for
Life.” We staged that curiosity at lteefton
(M.L.), having imported, at enormous ex-
pense, a large coal-basket, attached by sundry
ropes and Hangings to a painted balloon, por-
tion of which appeared below the sky borders.
The thing looked realistic enough when the
basket, ivith the hero in it, was lowered from
the flics to rescue the heroine from the arms
of the until-then triumphant villain. But in
an excess of enthusiasm the advance-agent
had asserted that part of the i-oof would be
removed to admit of the airship descending
and ascending, and when the curtain fell
there was a rush to get out and view the
airship rising majestically above the.build-
ing : and afterwards the crowd made trouble
over being what it vulgarly called “had.”
Some of us were so incensed at this stupid
attitude that we left without paying our
hotel bills.
“Caesar's Ghost”: Blake Adams makes a
good showing in his part in “The Lady of
the Rose.” And so he ought. During the
long run of the piece in’ London lie was
understudy to Huntley Wright, and took the
principal's place during his illness.
“Hambone”: “B.B.” is right in saying
“Dick Whittington” was Sydney’s Christmas
panto in 1897, and not the following year
(B. 9/10/’24). The 1898 panto, was “Ali
Baba and the. Forty Thieves,” “written, com-
piled and abstracted from various, sources
by Arthur H. Adams.” One of tlie comic
dames in the production was Albert Whelan.
“Dick Whittington,” by the way, introduced
to Sydney playgoers Ada Reeve, whose lead-
ing man was Bert Gilbert. Ali’s rival Christ-
mas attractions in ’9B were Alfred Dampier
in “Robbery Under Arms,” then in its 10th
week, at the Cri.: Charlie Holloway in
“When London Sleeps,” at the Royal;
McAdoo’s Jubilee Singers, at the Palace;
and, as “B.B.” says, “Carmen,” with Lilian
Tree in the lead, at the Lyceum. Ali, of
.course, was at Her Majesty’s.
“Epacris”: “Irymple” (B. 9/10/’24) is a
few years out in his statement that Marie
Lohr appeared with the “Faust” • cast at
Easter, 1888. Marie wasn’t born then. The
production she really figured in took place
in 1899; Scot Inglis was Faust and Kate
Bishop, Marie’s mother, played Martha. I
was in it myself, so I ought to know.
“Marko”: Mention by “C. Ockney” (B.
16/10/'24) of the £197,035 left by Charles
Wyndham makes rue wonder how much less
it would have been had he not had Mary
Moore and her magnificent business capa-
city to help him. Mary relates that when
she was starting in the business her only
hat blew out of a railway-carriage window
while she was cn route to play in Man-
chester. But the head from which the. hat
parted company was screwed on all right,
and in time, out of her own savings, she
acquired a half-interest in each of the three
Wyndham theatres, the New, Criterion and
Wyndham’s. As Wyndham left her his
whole fortune Mary Moore must be worth
over £BOO,OOO. She does not act now, her
last appearance having been made a few
years ago in “Our Mr. Hepplewhite,” a clever
play which Australia has unfortunately
never seen.
“Sturt”: The Repertory Theatre of Adel-
aide is looking into a scheme for obtaining
a home of its own. The King’s Theatre
was built a few years ago for the Fuller
circuit, which later took the chance to
acquire the old Tivoli and turn it into the
present Majestic, larger and more central.
The little King’s mostly stands empty, and
has been offered to the Rep. for the absurdly
low price, as theatres go, of about £12,000.
Further, Lennon, as vendor, throws in a lot
of scenery and “props.,” and even his own
services for a year or so as manager. The
sum is a staggering one, all the same, for
the Rep. to find : but suggestions are made
for the raising of debentures, for assistance
from a local opera eo. now being arranged
by Filippini, and possibly from other literary
and artistic bodies.
“Coot” : Surely the oldest person who list-
cned-in to Melba’s farewell to the Yarra
was Morris Jacobs, of Geelong, who is 98.
Rather feeble, but with hearing almost un-
impaired, lie sat in his armchair and heard
the whole performance through.
“C. Ockney” : H. F. Maltby, author of the
John O’Hara comedy, “The Laughter of
Fools” (the only British piece in the Ameri-
can comedian’s repertory), is a mummer
who, in suite of having written 30 plays, still
delights to strut the boards. He is at the
present time taking his latest piece, “Three
Birds,” round the English provinces, and
is himself playing the principal part. He
has been on the stage for a quarter of a cen-
tury, but two and a half years’ war service
has to be deducted from that. Maltby had
a hard fight to get into the West End, but
any piece from his pen is sure of a hearing
there these days.
“Hamfat”: Sardonic Jack Want, dead
these many years, was responsible for as
quaint an introduction of an aspiring ama-
teur as J. C. Williamson ever received. “You
might find him useful,” wrote Jack to Jimmy.
“He has shown he can play Hamlet, Pooh-
Bah and Wilfred Denver; also billiards.
Especially billiards.” “Not a bad wheeze,”
said Jimmy, the next time they met, “but
didn’t -you crib it from Gilbert?” Jack
merely grinned.
“To Po”: A recent reference to Louise
Pomeroy reminded me of Louise’s 1880 sea-
son at Melbourne Royal—she was supported
by Hoskins and Fred Appleton (successful
despite the defect in his palate), and “Cym-
beline” w T as her most ambitious production.
I took a mate from a backblock selection
to see the thing. It was his first theatrical
show, and the bedroom scene thrilled him.
When lachimo stepped into the trunk and
commenced the very gradual dropping of the
lid. there was a shout from Wirewhiskers of
“Shut it quick, mate, or she’ll spot yer.”
I sighed, and tried him next night on a Bland
Holt melodrama. A smith, who shod a horse
on the stage, excited Bill’s critical faculties
again, and when an over-nourished actor-r,
got un as a jockey, led the Derby winner on, a
yell of derision broke from the gentleman on
my right. “Him ride Chester, the fat loafer!”
William said to me very audibly. “ If they
put him on a helephant he’d break its blanky
back.” It was the waxworks for us after
that.
“A.P.”: In “The New Encyclopaedia of
Music and Musicians,” a U.S. publication,
I read that “since 1918 Melba has been
teaching in Melbourne.” At first sight it
seems a glaring error, but the compilers are
to be excused. They have doubtless been
misled by the periodically printed statement
that a Melbourne musical institution is under
the Dame’s personal supervision, which state-
ment is not amended even when she is in
some other part of the world.
VIOLET VARLEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw you once in a sweet French play when I was
a wondering boy
And you were the Toast of Melbourne Town, the
theatre’s pride and joy.
You sang, 1 remember, a kissing song, with such a
delicate art,
Such natural, effortless grace and charm as captured
every heart.
You it was who opened the door through which 1
found Romance,
Felt the lure of a lovely land, thrilled at the
name of France.
To-day in the city a fiddler played the song you
sang so well
Of poor Margot who went for a row and into the
river fell;
And, just for a, minute, the hurrying street became
an enchanted spot,
The cares of the present stole away, and Time and
Death were not.
Kind thoughts and fancies of gracious days revived
within me then:
You came gliding out of the past, and I was a
boy again.

u yhe Six Supreme ”
You Expect it to Cost More!
WHEN people see the New Moon Six for the first time
they invariably assume its price to be from £lOO to
£2OO more than it really is.
This greater value that Moon offers is too big a buying
opportunity for you to overlook.
Examine this car as closely as your wariness bids —accept a
demonstration—you will then understand how and why Moon
is “THE SIX SUPREME.”

good fight against particularly keen competition.
All Australia seems to have been busy writing lately.

J.E.; Can’t take “Pal o’ Mine" or “Lost Brother”
to our* hearts.... N.M.S.: Why not write your verse
in straight English? Maorilanders, even on the
West Coast, speak it. .. .L.R.G.: Your verse has a
lilt, but is too obscure... .J.D.; Sorry, tipped out.
But thanks for good intentions.... F.M.: Try again.
First of all, a poem is a thought expressed in words.
Not fine words obscuring a thought.... L.L.: Can't
pay for the piping for the Dance of Life 8.H.:

Rode for miles across the country, and went courting
Molly Lee.
Let them alone. They’ll marry, and live in prose
ever afterwards W.C. (M.L.) ; The kiss served up
with cherries, magnolias, moonlight, lovelight and the

tion. .. .A.M.8.8.: Onci stanza:—

Her cooking was vile, all her friends had declared ;
They came to tea once, but were evermore scared;

try again. .. .5.J.8.: Only rare genius could make it
worse. ... E.J.G.: Old commonplaces in poorly built
verse... .J.H.W.: Yes, the basket got it. But it was
a great act of mercy. Better things have been
burned by the hangman. . . .Coreen N.: Very wild
E.M.E.: “The Burning Log” doesn’t carry enough
interest E.S.L.: Too thin.... Dragon Fly: Crude
imitation of poor models Edith N.; A small idea
put into metrical bumps P.C.C.: On a wrong
track.... Bellerive: A very vivid bit:—
With contorted brow and
Wild glaring eyes,
Haunted by spectres he
Give vent to shrill cries ;
Up a rickety stairs
To lie’s garret room
lie staggered and cursed
In the evening gloom ;
He struck at a photo
Which hung in a frame,
The photo of he’s wife,
But only in name;
He shattered the glass,
And chuckled: “Farewell,
We’ll meet, she devil,
Somewhere in Hell.”
Down the creaky stairs
Reeled the poor stricken wreck,
When he fell with a thud
And broke he’s neck.
....San Toy: No carpenter built that poem. And
we wouldn’t like to blame the walrus R.L.J.:
The gates verse is not good; the beer verse is not
new. The bills verse is better; but doesn’t quite
do it.... Emeritus: Old phrasing to say a very small
thing... .S.U.N.: Leaves us c01d... .R.N.H.: The
“Roman Tale" doesn’t read true... .L.A.S.: Neither
quite... .H.M.A.: A poor tale. .. .S.S. (Mosman) :
Very crude... .L.L. (Bur wood) ; Don’t see where
“Anticipation” would fit in... .C.C.S.: Doesn’t move
us to cheers.... K.H. (Darling Downs): It’s a dismal
thing and strikes a false note... .P.A.E.: That has
been done very often; and some, of the rhymes are
awful.... Una C.: Parodies find this a cold market.
The “Far Away” verse is a little thing. .. .W.C.8.:
Misses ; but it wasn’t a bad shot. .. .F.G.8.: Terrible.
....R.R. (Christchurch): The yarn is without life.
. ...S.W.G.: Not enough marrow in its bones....
P.T.F.: Rat-her crude melodrama. .. .Aura Z.: The
same old thing, with a final bump on a wicked
attempt at rhyme.... Douglas J.: Too extravagant....
R.F.C.: It wants sandpapering... .B.W. (Welling-
ton) : You mean well, but worse crimes have seldom
been committed in the name of verse... .Mico: We’ve
got to cover too much ground to print rambling
stuff of that sort.... A.J.P.: Very bad... .8.J.A.:
Highly moral, particularly dreary and entirely un-
original ... .A. A. E.: No good. . . .E.J.F.: Not much
demand for that sort of thing here... .Sulcus: It isn’t
exactly thrilling. .. .C.N.; “Jim” is picture-show rub-
bish.... Eric M.; Slight and commonplace... .G. du
C.: Some distance off. .. .W.E.8.; “The Picture” is
a failure... .R.8.F.: Most of them are thin; many
of them are clumsy.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.F.: There is merit in the idea, but your
drawing is too weak yet to carry it. Also don’t use
blue ink... .D.M.R.: Like the bag of oysters that
was left in the cloak-room —not a sound one in rbe
10t... .T.R.D.: Pallid, distasteful and obscene....
ILL. J.: As fatally precise as a photo, and as dead.
. ...W.11.D.: We like that idea of putting a “Ha
ha!” at the gag’s end: it fills up a painful silence.
.. . .S.R.: Valetudinarianism in ink. .. .N.G.C.: That
joke was unfortunately overlooked at the Burning
of the Books (400 b.c.) .. . . J.S.G.: Forged Yankee
currency ; and dashed badly forged at that. . . .C. F.:
We were afraid to touch it for fear of splinters....
G.P. and R.V.S.: Missed the ’bus by several blocks.

Isko Automatic Electric Freezing Machines
Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of Ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
A complete model of this Isko
Automatic machine of one-ton
capacity, suitable for Residential
Hotels, Butchers, etc., is avail-
able.

■
.
«' 1
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, • made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant— a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, and can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and off at the,pre-
determined temperatures.
Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.

“Hops”: If the average brewer wasn’t so
careless about the value of by-products yeast
would be on the market for bread-making in
Australia (B. 2/10/’24). The stuff as he
gathers it is usually too bitter for bak-
ing; but it can easily be debittered by
washing with carbonate of ammonium, then
dried in vacuo at lOOdeg. F., powdered,
mixed with flour or potato starch, pressed
into cakes and sold. Looks simple enough.
* * * *
“Loco”: Jumbunna coal, as “Sax” says
(B. 2/10/’24), was the best stove-fuel un-
earthed in Victoria, but the mine was always
a difficult one to work, faulty and narrow
seams being the chief trouble. The coal at
present being won from the eastern section
of the State mine at Wonthaggi is the near-
est approach to the Jumbunna sample yet
obtained. As this seam is being worked to-
wards the Jumbunna field, some miles dis-
tant, it is just possible that the good coal
may continue that way. It is to be hoped so,
for the sake of loco enginemen as well as
housewives.
* * * *
“Gambrinus”: Touching yeast (B.
2/10/’24), it not only makes nutritious food
for stock, but the Germans were quick to
find its value as a substitute for meat
extract, with its proteid content of 86 to
88 per cent., and assimilable phosphates of
4to 5 per cent. Early in the war all of
the breweries were required to send their
surplus yeast to a centr'al station, where it
was treated and converted into a highly
nutritious tonic food, rich in vitamines and
just the thing for a semi-starved people.
Dried yeast and other products made from
it are much used in the U.S. as a cure for
certain forms of skin disease and as a tonic
food in cases of neuritis.

“Stellsby”; The Melbourne Diggers’ Anzac
tweed industry, which blew out a month or
two ago owing to pressure by the sometime
patriots of the clothing trade, is to get a
new skin. Hundreds of promises of sup-
port have come from people in all parts of
Australia; many of the communications
were accompanied by substantial cheques. A
new factory has been secured in High-street,
Northcote, and suit and costume lengths,
hand-woven and all wool, will soon be avail-
able again at 12s. 6d. and 13s. 6d. a yard
double-width. The R.5.5.1.L.A., Anzac
House, is sheltering the executive of the
enterprise for the present.

“Baro”: Compressed yeast, which “Jes-
mond” asserts is not mqyufactured in Aus-
tralia (B. 2/10/’24), is made in Sydney,
and bakers in all parts of N.S.W. receive
their supplies regularly by rail. Many
shearers’ and station cooks, when leaving
Sydney, take a lump of it to make their first
batch and to start new yeast. If housewives
do not bake their own bread, lack of a good
ferment is not the reason. The trouble is
if mum made a few fresh loaves every day
there would be little, if any, saving and
plenty extra work; and if she baked once or
twice a week, dad and the kids would growl
about the stale bread. Also, few men cooks
can make as good bread as the professional
baker, and none of the other sex.

“Hamer” : Herbert Carter, a marine engi-
neer and native of Stawell (Vic.), has
produced an invention which seems to have
more possibilities than most —a diving-suit
which is also capable of being used for
fire-fighting work in gas-filled mines, moun-
tain-peak gymnastics, or high-stunting in
aeroplanes. It is hard to imagine anyone
trying to scale Mt. Everest in an ordinary
diving-suit: but Colonel Pottinger, who was
with the first expedition, has already de-
clared that the new outfit is handier and
lighter than the oxygen carriers used in that
climb, and pronounced it likely to be of
help in the next attempt. The basic idea is
a gas-mask with an oxygen-holder carried
on the back. _ln a test at Port Melbourne
a diver wearing the new costume stayed
for half an hour in a room filled with sul-
phur fumes, and came out unaffected.
* * * *
FY t ’: It looks as if the curse of the jute
woolpack may be lifted at last; the president
of Bradford (Eng.) Chamber of Commerce
suggests in place of it a light wool canvas
pack, reinforced by metal bands. The pre-
sent bale has a lot to answer for. The jute
sheds” into the wool and cannot be ex-
tracted from it. It detracts from the value
of combings and manufactured articles, and
lias produced expense and maledictions evQr
since Australian wool first went overseas in
jute coverings, the depreciation being esti-
mated by Bradford at half a million sterling
a year. All sorts of plans have been tried
to overcome the trouble, including paper-
lined bales, but expense or ineffectiveness
prevented their coming into general use.
Even now Bradford buyers allow a bob a
bale for paper linings. But the new bale
would cost 3s. 6d. more than the jute bag;
and that is a big difference to swallow.

‘X2X”: While geologists have been try-
ing to find more oil, chemists have been
seeking a process by which the higher boiling-
point hydrocarbons may be prepared syn-
thetically on a commercial scale, and the
chances are that within the next 20 years
the discovery will be made. Like diamonds,
which have already been made by Moissan
and others, petrol and benzine have both
been synthesised in the laboratory—notably
by Von Bunge, the German physiological
chemist —but only in drops and at such a
cost that, a-s in the case of the synthetic dia-
monds, it was altogether out of proportion
to the value of the stuff. Still, the fact
that liquid hydrocarbons have actually been
prepared is sufficient to show that science is
on the right track. As yet the large supplies
of natural oil available have resulted in the
majority of chemists turning their attention
towards some more pressing problem, but as
soon as a scarcity starts to set in an impetus
will be given to the search for a method of
producing synthetic petrol, and thousands
of scientific workers all over the world will
be engaged in the quest. The discovery will
probably have the effect of making the coun-
try where the success is achieved the richest
and most powerful one in the -world—until
the secret leaks out. or the scientists of other
nations also succeed in producing the stuff.

Standard Equipment
On Cars
By the HUNDRED THOUSAND!
Nine out of every ten of the world’s cars and lorries have these two famous STEWART Products
as Standard Factory equipment.
What a tribute to their utility and efficiency!
To be chosen not by just a few, but by 90 per cent, of Car Manufacturers as the very best procurable.
In the whole history of motoring no individual items of car equipment have been so readily and
universally adopted—the Stewart Vacuum Feed System because it is the one device vyhich ensures
a regular, even flow of petrol to the carburettor under all conditions, and the Stewart Magnetic
Speedometer on account of its unfailing accuracy and reliability in recording speed and mileage.
These world-famed products typify the painstaking methods of all branches of Stewart production.
Horns, Bumpers, Spotlights, Rear Vision Mirrors, Shock Absorbers, etc., all alike reflect the high
standard of Stewart Quality.

NEW EDISON
Frieda Hempel’s Golden Voice
brought into your home.
Hempel singing in opera, in oratorio, in concert —
Hempel singing in Edison Records —the magic
loveliness of her voice is the same.
People who have heard Hempel’s glorious voice ask no explana-
tion of her elusive yet enduring charm. They only know that she
sings straight into their hearts—songs they will never forget.
Few are privileged actually to see her exquisite personality—but
every home may enjoy the privilege of receiving, in all save actual
physical presence, the wondrous Hempel, idol of two continents.
For the New Edison Phonograph, product of Mr. Edison’s genius
and ideals, evolved only by years of research costing more than
£600,000, actually Re-Creates the voice of the living artist—with
every golden tonal quality, every delicate shading unimpaired. It
is the only phonograph which dares the final, conclusive test of
comparison with theTiving artist.

Under Strenuous Conditions
of service the 14/40-h.p. Sunbeam has won
unanimous praise. Embodying the latest
achievements in design, this supreme British pro-
duction has proved that the highest value is
derived from intrinsic quality. Considering its
power, comfort, running costs, and outstanding
distinction, the 14/ 40-h.p. Sunbeam is amongst
the most economical of cars.
For those who wish for a larger and more powerful
car the 20/60-h.p. six-cylinder model makes an
immediate appeal.
Both models fitted with four-wheel brakes.

George McCoombes, who lias died, aged
85, at Ipswich (Q-), was one of the not
very numerous Australians who received the
Queen Victoria bounty for fathering three
sets of twins.
Good-natured and cultured E. B. Grundy,
K.C., has sent to S. Aus. for his furniture to
make a flat in London look a little bit like
home. Grundy has a wonderful library, but
that will remain in Adelaide. The veteran is
75.
W. D. J. Pritchard, lately dead at Canter-
bury (Vic.), was a Welshman who chased
gold all over the world. He was in the rush
at Klondyke, on M.L. fields, and in Vic. as
a mine-manager. He lost all his savings in
the land-boom in Melbourne, and settled
down as a hardware merchant in Adelaide
till his retirement last year, when he re-
turned to Victoria.
Queensland M.L.A. James Porter Fry has
been called “the little Firpo.” The other
day W. N. Gillies, Minister for Agriculture,
had a little difference with him ; whereupon
Fry departed to bring back Sizer as his
second. Gillies, of course, had meanwhile
repented. But before the evening was
through he had been so harried by reporters
that he almost wished he had taken Fry
on for the sake of a little practice.
F. W. Coneybeer, who regained a seat in
the S. Aus. Assembly under the Liberal label
at the last elections, was 65 the other
day. In ’93 he first entered Parliament for
East Torrens, and for many years topped
the poll in his district as a Labor man. He
looks and perhaps feels out of place in
opposition to his old Labor friends; but he
has his hobby of collecting newspaper cut-
tings to keep him busy.
The Australian bush does make them
touf*h. Young Terry McGroarty was smit-
ten with the wanderlust the other day in
the Manning River (N.S.W.) country, and
took 24 hours off to gratify it. When tin-
search party got on his trail in the swampy
country round about Laurieton, Terence
was in danger of becoming a side-issue owing
to the insistent claims of snakes and deaf-
adders on the rescuing party’s attention;
a dingo or two witli pups in near-by logs
also figured among the fauna encountered.
Finally a very tired and extremely dry
toddler was located who couldn’t quite under-
stand the fuss made over him. The young
explorer is not quite three.
“Sturt”: The Tramways Trust in Adel-
aide has at last started to remove the awful
blockage caused by every tram for every
suburb running along King William-street.
The tradition that every suburbanite has a
right to be landed at the Grenfell-Currie
crossing of King William is still observed,
because there was loud and eventually suc-
cessful opposition to making Victoria-square
one terminus —though that is the real centre
of the city. The simple plan is now being
tried of making all the eastern cars stop at
the end of Grenfell-street and run straight
back again. The neighborhood of the Regis-
ter office is congested as a result; but King
William-street -gets partial freedom.
“Curlwaa” : W. L. Higgins, who 40 years
ago was the first secretary of the Wentworth
Pastoral Society, and a champion floricul-
turist, still grows erysanthemums at his
home in Perth (W.A.). In the days before
the dahlia had so largely ousted the chry-
santhemum from popular favor, Wentworth
(represented by Higgins, Gurney and
Chatto) and the infant irrigation colony of
Mildura (represented by Burrows, Boland
and Gallagher) competed in teams for the
honor of growing the finest blooms; and, as
photos attest, wonderful blooms they were.
Before the days of railways Higgins used per-
sonally to convey his floral children by coach
to compete with the aristocracy of their breed
in Melbourne and Adelaide.
“The Deacon” : A few days ago Monsignor
Hugh McDermott proceeded to spend another
£20,000 on a new wing for St. Martha’s
Home at Leichhardt (N.S.W.), where Mary
Ann is taught housework as well as numer-
ous trades. Dr. McDermott was a parish
priest who came from Ireland to help launch
the College in Manly, and after some 20
years’ drudgery was made its president—a
position he promptly used to get a bill put
through Parliament entitling him to sell most
of the superfluous Government-grant lands
surrounding the College. This sale was so
successful that the College at last stood on
its own financial feet. Dr. McDermott was
made a Monsignor, which entitles him to wear
a purple dicky (which he doesn’t) and a
more or less episcopal ring (which he does
—mostly in his pocket).
“Troophorse”: Mention of the custom
among sea-captains of saluting the old Jar-
dine settlement at Somerset, in Albany Pass,
Cape York (B. 25/8/’24). recalls that' as
long ago as 1565 the first sale of Crown lands
for the settlement took place at Brisbane.
Somerset, the northernmost point of Aus-
tralia, lies only about 11 degrees south of
the line. The 70 lots offered as town-
ship sites were all bought up at such an
advance on the upset price, £2O per acre,
that the sale averaged £149 per acre. Old
C. J. Scrutton, the only survivor of the Jar-
dine Cape York expedition of 1864, is still
at his cattle station out on the MacArthur
River country (N.T.). He reads without
using glasses, and sits a horse with any of
the younger men in the locality, but has a
peculiar habit of looking for a hole when-
ever thunder and lightning are about.
“1.0. R..”: That sly-grog case at Orange
(B. 2/10’/24) takes me back to pre-war days.
When the Rechabites began to hold weekly
dances in our sleepy little Vic. village, the
whole district flocked to them, for the only
other excitement was to watch the train
arrive. After a week or two, however, we
bucks began to find the pub too far away,
and started to bring our refreshment in
bottles. These only tantalised the thirsty
hop-pickers, and the future of the fixture
was in the lap of Bacchus until an enter-
prising publican offered to supply liquid
wares in large quantities and on the spot.
Forthwith we all became members of the
Lodge, and every Saturday night the fully-
initiated would divide their time between
their partners and the hogshead at the rear
of the hall. Never have I met a more
brotherly lot; and then a new and strict
constable arrived. It was a close shave;
but eventually we got over the difficulty by
allowing him to become a Rechabite, too.
When I left the town he was Guardian of
the Lodge.

My Hardest Job
to excel all other Shaving Creams
The Palmolive Chemist admits that the hardest job in
his career was the production of Palmolive Shaving Cream.
He was confronted with peculiar conditions. There were
already a score or more of good Shaving Soaps on the
. market. Each had a big following. His problem was to
produce such a superlative cream that men would reject
something good for something better. Palmolive Shaving
Cream is the outcome of his efforts. It offers these five
advantages.
(1) It multiplies itself 250 times in foamy lather.
(2) It softens your beard, no matter how tough,
in sixty seconds.
(3) The lather lasts, moist and luxurious, for
ten minutes on the face.
(4) Hairs are held erect to meet the blade, making
your shave cleaner, easier.
(5) It possesses lotional properties due to blend
of palm and olive oils.
Now we ask you to test this perfected Shaving Cream at
our expense. Cut out the form below. Send it to-day.

For this reason “ brambles ”

notice “ brambling with pride ”
and “ dimpling with pleasure.”
Such expressions being natural

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT midnight by the last red flowers of
fire
We sat and talked and brushed our
hair for bed;
Faintly there throbbed the old bell's jangled
wire
From the front door, and Mona raised her
head.
“Wait—l will go,” I said; “it is for me,”
And crept downstairs into the hall’s pale
gloom,
Where from its chains one lamp poured sil-
verly
Uncertain light into the shadowy room.
I drew the bolts, and in the night outside
Saw One who waited, shrouded black and
stark.
“Take me—it was for me you called,” I lied;
He drew a little back into the dark,
And raised a beckoning violin and played,
His eyes on Mona half-way down the stair.
The tune commanded; slowly she obeyed,
The lamplight ruddy on her waves of hair.
Straight to my treasure-chest in stumbling
haste
I ran and filled both hands with coins
of gold
And weeping pearls, and with them inter-
laced
Rubies, my own heart’s blood by fear
struck cold.
I thrust them on the Stranger; but once
more
He played, and stood unspeaking in the
night;
And Mona passed me by, and through the
door
She stepped to that thin music out of
sight.
Now hour by hour there rinv within my ears
Those crystal notes, so low, so wild, so
strange.
Mona is gone. There is no use for tears
In a dull world left full of desolate change.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rN the garden of Cleghorn’s farm at
Granite Mountain, Bill of Bringalily
compared sale notes with Jimmy Cleg-
horn and raised his voice in denunciation of
commission agents, forestallers, middlemen
and exploiters.
“S-s-s-sh!” warned Milly Cleghorn.
“Mother’s ill.”
“Beg y’ pardon, Mil,” apologised Bringa-
lily. “Anything bad?”
“I don’t think so—just worn out and
weary. It’s the cold she got a month ago.
But she’s dozing off now.”
“We’ll go to the fence and talk there.”
“I wish you, would. And keep the child-
ren away from the house, too.”
Mr. Cleghorn, resting as usual on the old
colonial sofa on the verandah, returned to
consciousness, and remarked that “if the kids
come roaring round” he would skin ’em. He
then slowly upended himself, and followed
Jimmy, his first-born, and Bringalily Bill
to the fence by the road.
There Bringalily stated his grievance, the
more heatedly because Jimmy’s sale-notes
tallied with his own.
“Price of t’maters in the paper all last
week was six to nine shillings a case, wasn’t
it? And I send twelve cases and get back
a cheque for four and six—fourpence-ha’penny
over the freight and charges, and the cases
cost me ninepence each. I’m out my labor,
seed, land, fertiliser, wear and tear of plant,
cartage and care, and I got four and six.
What’s yours, Jimmy?”
“Eight and fourpence for twenty cases—
fivepence a case net. I get half a brownie
a case more than you, Bringalily.”
“Jest the same in Tassy, it was,” moaned
Cleghorn. “Jest the same. Grow p’tat’rs
an’ up they come Irish blight! ‘Get pigs an’
feed the spuds to ’em,’ they ses to me. Pigs?
Why, pigs is slavery. Y’ got to be up day
an’ night feedin’ pigs. Eat, eat, eat, eat —
that’s pigs!”
“Didn’t y’ever try anything but spuds, Mr.
Cleghorn ?”
“Dairyin’—too hard, that. Y’ got t’ get
up too early; an’ the missus’d never agree
to the kids milkin’ till they wus old enough.
‘l’ll work,’ she ses—‘l’ll work to a standstill,
but not the kids too airly.’ A good woman,
the missus. An’ then I tried sparrygus.
Got a lot o’ seaweed for a sparrygus patch, I
did. Sparrygus likes salt, sandy soil. An’
up it come—an’, by cripes, up it come dam’
ferns!' An’ then up come the Irish blight
again an’ rooned me. Never had no luck.
Poor cow me!”
Bringalily glanced at Jimmy Cleghorn and
saw the flash of contempt in his eyss as he
studied his father—contempt changing, imme-
diately to amused tolerance. Seeing this
other difficulty cumbering the earth and aid-
ing the commission agent in his oppression of
the tiller of the soil, Bringalily’s rage re-
turned. “A man’d be better off anywhere
than here,” he said impatiently.
“Too true,” agreed Jimmy. “I feel like
giving up and taking a job on wages.”
That provided just sufficient opposition for
Bringalily. “I don’t quit and take wages.
I’ll fight these sharks on their own ground.
I’ll organise the farmers,” he said.
“Bringalily ! Jimmy ! Come quickly !”
They turned to see Milly on the verandah,
her hand to her breast, her face and her
actions expressing dire trouble.
“What is it, Mil?”
“Mother! I can’t wake her ! Mother!”
* * * *
There had been all day, and all the after-
noon before, a string of buggies, springcarts
and saddle horses along the tracks that led
to Granite Mountain, for the bush-telegraphs
and mulga-wires had done their duty. To
that bereaved home came men and women
and children to leave bush flowers and homely
wreaths from homely gardens, to kiss tue
young motherless children and shake hands
silently with the mature mourners, and then
to say she was good woman, good wife, good
mother, good neighbor, and shake hands
again, and go away shy and embarrassed at
having shown human emotion.
A very old, rheumatic woman who would
never sit a horse again sent her long-stored
riding habit “to cut up for the little girls,
and the Quartpot carpenter and undertaker,
who had known so few funerals that he could
still be sorry for the dead, brought the coffin
in a rusty black hearse, so dull and old it
might have been the cabin of a Venetian gon-
dola chastened by the Sumptuary Law.
The rarely-seen Mrs. Deneen drove out to
Granite Mountain on the day of death, and
measured Milly and the little girls for
mourning, and her husband came out the day
of the funeral and brought the hideous black
uniform of sorrow for all the family. And
at last they left the orchard and the home the
tireless bushwoman had helped to grow and
build, and in Deneen’s waggonette immedi-
ately following the hearse were the seven
children who represented her lifework, and
now followed that unwearying mother who at
last lay with hands folded, doing absolutely
nothing. , , .
The funeral procession straggled through
the bush, the wondering horses reefing at
their bridle-reins, unable to account for this
dismal progress on tracks where they had
been used to the easy canter away from home
and the excitement of a gallop home again.
At long last they came to Quartpot —hearse,
waggonette, buggies, springcarts, horsemen
and dogs; and one man with a bicycle riding
that funereal pace with difficulties calling for
the balance of a juggler. So to the grace and
burial; the dead mother's seven monuments
grouped around that eager trench in the
granitic sand. And so they left her and drove
back to Granite Mountain, the horses running
free after their long chafing in the slow pro-
cession of the morning.
At Cleghorn’s habit was broken —habit that
would begin to remake itself to-morrow.
Strangely they felt in that place of work that
had banished work for three days past. The
chill of autumn trembled in the peach-trees,
lifting the reddened leaves and shaking them
gently on their stalks and letting them down
to dissolution. In their new black clothes
the children moved about the house and farm,
and the shivering of the season seemed to
find their souls and make them shiver too.
As the sun set there were Bringalily, and
Jimmy, and Milly Cleghorn comforting small
children and glad to see them fall asleep at
the tea-table, and know that undressing would
not quite awaken them, and that their loss
could not hurt them again before dawn.
Bringalily left early. “Poor old Mil, he
said at parting—“l must look after you
now.” _ .
“I couldn’t leave them now, Bringalily.
Not while they’re babies.
“Righto!” said Bringalily. But as he
walked home in the silence of bush and star-
light he knew it was not “righto,” for death
had made another Laban to be served yet
another seven years.
In the living-room sat Milly and her
brother, the Man of the House. They talked
softly and earnestly, still feeling the presence
that was withdrawn. The only wakeful child,
the smallest boy, had been bribed to sleep
by occupation of Jimmy’s bed, and by Jimmy’s
promise that they should sleep together.
Occasionally he had wakened to cry out that
Jimmy should come to bed at once, and as
often they soothed him back to unconscious-
ness.
“I couldn’t go away now,” said Jimmy.
“No new work in the west for me.”
“We must both stay.”
“I know. Bringalily ! Poor old Mil!
You’re as good as she was, Mil.”
“We’ll help each other, Jimmy. I know
how you wanted to get away, to work for
yourself. Tannie Morell likes you, too.”
“No fear! She’d never look at me.”
“She’s shy, that’s all. Girls often talk to
the one they don’t care for, so’s the real one
won’t think they’re cheap.”
“Me think her cheap? But she doesn’t
care.”
“You only want me to say again that she
does.”
“Well, there’s no Tannie Morell yet, any-
how. The kids have to keep to school. An
ignorant man is only a horse to carry for
others. The kids must grow up as well as
if mother had stayed on to look after them.”
“Poor father!”
“I know —but if he was only a man, Milly !
Well, it’s only you and me for all of ’em —
an’ it’s hard workin’ without pay. If we
can’t get a fair deal from these commission
agents it means that we work for nothing
except when the market’s so bare they’ve got
to treat us something like fair. Catch-crops!
We grow the crops and they catch ’em.”
The sleepy complaint of the child in
Jimmy’s room came again. “Jimmy, I’m
frikened. Come ter bed, Jimmy.”
“I’d better go in—that kid’ll wake up alto-
gether if I don’t. Good-night. Mil!”
“Good-night, Jimmy. I’ll go after I’ve seen
father.”
She lifted the table-lamp and entered hei
father’s room. He lay upon the bed fully
dressed, and, as usual, dozing; but as the
light struck his eyelids he put up his hand
against the brightness, blinked the blink of
a surprised owl, and sat up.
“Why don’t you go to bed, Father? We
all want rest.”
“Mumma,” said the sleepy child in Jimmy’s
room.
“She was a good wife to me.”
“She was good to all of us, Dad. Poor
mother, she never hurt anything in the wide
world.” ...
“A good wife she was, said the egotist.
‘‘An’ I’m left to the mercy of the waves.”
“We’ll look after you, Dad. Jimmy an’
me. We’ll look after you. We must all
help each other to bear it —and make a good
thine: of life.”
“Where’s me nerf tonic?”
“I’ll get it, Dad. And then you’ll get to
bed. Promise me you’ll go to bed and sleep
It’s been the hardest day we’ve had, and to
morow we’ll be braver than we are now.”
“All right, Mil. You’re good, too. You’re
like her, too —when she was a gal. A good
wife she was.”
“Drink your tonic. I H hght your candle.
That’s right. Good night, Dad.”

It Pays to Keep
Zam-Buk

£
WHE V accidents happen you need help at once. Few
articles are so indispensable in the home as a
box of Zam-Buk, which quickly heals the skin
and drives pain and disease from the tissues.
When Zam-Buk is applied to cuts, burns, and
scalds, smarting pain is stopped, germ infection
prevented, and the broken tissues speedily knitted
together. Zam-Buk draws poison and inflammation out
of ulcerated and poisoned sores and heals when nothing
else can. Mothers everywhere find Zam-Buk invaluable
for healing ringworm and other children’s scalp
troubles.
Children themselves like Zam-Buk because it is so
cooling, soothing and pleasant. Their elders value it still
more highly because it is also antiseptic, preventing
poisoning and festering, and because it is good for the
tenderest skin.
Daily Toll of Accidents!
Mr. Guthrie F. Long, Viola, Roseberry Road, Guildford,
N.S.W., writes:—“l had the misfortune to upset half a gallon
of boiling water, severely scalding my right foot. In addition
to the terrible pain set up by the scalds, dirt got into the
exposed flesh, causing a dreadful state of festering and inflam-
mation. The limb was in such a state that for weeks it Avas
impossible for me to follow work.
“In my search for a cure I experimented with numerous
ointments and healing salves, but it was mainly time and money
wasted. Not until I began to treat the limb with Zam-Buk did
it show real sign of healing. Persistent use of Zam-Buk quickly
reduced inflammation and swelling, expelled all poisonous
matter from the wound, and healed with fine new skin.”

The Sacrifice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
D TROOP was iu a bad way. Sergeant
Ellis found a dismal satisfaction in
contemplating the worst and realis-
ing that the odds against the survival of the
remaining eight were somewhat long.
It was part of the scheme of things, or
the machinations of the heads, that liis
troop should get all the dust and dirt in
the lines, and the stickiest jobs, in a stunt
like this. Two days back they had done
advance-screen work for that wild gallop of
the brigade over the broken ground and up
the wide flat of the Jordan Valley. It was
only half a mile towards the river where
they had butted into that trench full of
Jackos with the nest of machine-guns. The
Turks were always making entrenchments in
unlikely places—digging for the fun of it, it
seemed —and nobody had expected to find this
one occupied. There were- more there than
they could handle, and the only thing to do
was to ride straight through and leave them
for the squadrons behind to mop up. But
they left young Morgan, too. Keane’s horse
had last been seen plunging madly, with the
trooper dragging in the stirrup. They were
lucky to get out as lightly aa they did.
It was this troop and another that had
been sent to reconnoitre down the Wadi
Zerka, and it was they who had drawn the
lire from the vicinity of the bridgehead, and
had been told to check any attempt of the
enemy to advance while the regiments with-
drew eastward to the low hills that rose off
the plain. That night they had toiled and
sweated to dig those miserable trenches in
the hard, bone-dry loam in expectancy of
the attack which was duly launched in the
grey light of early morning.
Sergeant Ellis recalled the heat and fury
of that little scrap and the seeming hope-
lessness of their position as wave after wave
of enemy infantry on a mile-wide front bore
down on their scattered line. It had been
good shooting, and their rifle-barrels had
grown hot as they fired on those dancing,
running, dodging, but ever-advancing figures;
strip after strip had been ripped through,
and the 13-pounder battery behind had the
fierce joy of aiming over open sights. But
the Turks knew their strength—or rather
their weakness —and came on confidently.
They were to be denied any hand-to-hand
struggle, however. Ellis's squadron-leader
rode up and gave his order in cool, un-
hurried tones, patting his mare’s neck the
while.
"We’re retiring through the hills. You’ll
stay here, Ellis, till the battery gets away.
They’re wrecking their guns now. You’ll find
your led horses in the wadi behind that black
knob. Leave your wounded if they can't help
themselves. We’ll give you covering fire till
you reach the rocks. Good-bye.”
There had not been time then to rail at
the luck that allotted his troop the job of
rear-guard ; but there was time now, and he
cursed bitterly and resentfully. For in those
last few minutes they had become the only
target offering, and concentrated fire had cut
them down from eighteen to ten, and two
more fell as they made their painful run to
the hill and comparative safety. He would
never forget the look of fear on old Poole’s
white face as they left him —too badly
wounded to walk—to the little mercy of the
advancing Turks.
And now here they were, a day later, a
surviving remnant, once more on a flank,
and that flank “in the air,” tired, thirsty,
worn and sleepy. The hot sun burned their
backs as they grovelled on their stomachs
behind little rocks. Three of his men were
asleep, cheeks kissing the dry, hot ground,
shaded faces wet with perspiration, while
their open mouths trickled a little saliva. A
disgusting sight, and the troop-leader was
disgusted with everything.
“How’d you like to be lined up to the bar
at the Windsor now, Sarge, coolin’ yer neck
with a pot of Pilsener?” Trooper Reedy’s
query brought no response from the sergeant.
“Or under one o’ them palms at Groppi’s
with a plate o’ pastry and a coupla ice-creams
between you and ’erV” The boy drew further
alluring pictures of the joys of civilisation,
but the others were too miserable to join in
his humour.
Sergeant Ellis detested him at all times
for his persistent cheerfulness. Just now it
whipped his raw nerves. But he offered no
retort; indeed, he was too slow-witted to
think of one. But he would have liked to
hurt this mocker who wouldn’t learn when
to keep his mouth shut. And then he hated
himself for his own mean thoughts, whilst
still harboring a dull resentment towards
the boy who had engendered them. He
wished to God the fool had never come to
the troop. No doubt he was worth his salt
on one of these stunts, but in camp he was
merely an annoyance. He had committed
most crimes of which a servant of Plis
Majesty could be guilty, and Army Regula-
tions had been strained to provide a section
under which some breaches of his own inven-
tion might be charged against him. His pay-
book was mutilated beyond description and
his pay mortgaged for months to come. Ser-
geant Ellis himself had “wheeled” him a
dozen times. And through it all—it was
this that the sergeant’s nature could not com-
prehend—he remained irresponsible, cheer-
ful and entirely lacking in malice towards
his superior officers. Even here where heat
and thirst (they had sent their water-bottles
back before dawn in the hope of getting them
filled somewhere in the rear, and now in
late afternoon were still looking vainly
for them) had turned men into surly,
miserable animals, Trooper Reedy was the
same heedless, derisive fatalist, careless of
himself and all else.
The signallers had run out a ground-wire
from squadron headquarters during the
night, and now the telephone buzzed, and
the troop-leader picked up the receiver.
t “That you, Ellis V Major Rowell here.
You've got to get your men back to the
cover of the wadi where the dressing-station
is. Make a dash for it as soon as the bat-
tery opens up—within 120 minutes. Any
casualties? Right. Good-bye.”
The sergeant spoke. “When I give you
the order to go, boys, just make the best
time you can back to cover, and look after
yourselves; don’t mind anyone else.”
Patiently and unconcernedly the little
group waited for the signal. With the first
crash from the 18-pounders they were on
their feet and away, spread out like rabbits
scurrying for their warren. A tremendous
burst of rifle-fire opened up all around, and
the fleeing party, imagining that all was
concentrated on them, put down their heads
and, with their gear flapping and flogging
them, and weighed down with rifle and am-
munition, raced for shelter. The zip of the
passing bullets and the vicious smack as
they smashed on the rocks lent the men
speed, and twice they all fell flat as a moun-
tain-gun sprayed a hail of shrapnel over
them.
Sergeant Ellis cursed the impoteiicy of the
British battery which could keep neither
rifles nor gun silent, but he was congratu-
lating himself that they would get there
without a casualty, when a terrific blow in
the small of the back made him stagger. The
next instant he had tripped on a stone and
fallen face downward, his rifle clattering to
the ground some yards away.
lie woke from his faint to feel a fierce
sting on top of the dull ache of bis wound,
and listened without comprehension to the
unreal voice of Trooper Reedy.
"Does that hurt. Surge? That’s the iodine;
spilt it all over yer. 1 seen, yer fall an
dropped, too, to see Iioav yer got on. I was
goin to rat yer kick if yer was right out.
We’re safe in this hole, but them swine will
soon be on the hill, and they’ll shoot us here
like dingoes in a trap. Soon’s I get this
dressing on I’ll piggy-back you to the wadi.”
“Some water, for God’s sake!” moaned the
man in pain.
“Ain’t got none, but, I’ll take yer to it,"
was the cheerful response.
“You won't!” cried the sergeant, sud
denly realising his position. “You go to hell,
Reedy. You got no right here. You get
to where the rest went, or I’ll shoot you
like a dog. You blasted fool! Get!”
“Easy now, Sarge.” He pillowed the
other’s head in his hand. “Yer don’t bluff
me now, and yer won’t live through to-night
if I don’t get yer to the C.C.S. quick. So
come on.”
A fearful crowd peered from shelter and
watched as the figure of Trooper Reedy
staggered across fifty yards of fire-swept zone
with the dead-weight of the helpless and
half-undressed casualty in his arms, a blood-
soaked bandage trailing behind, while the
exultant enemy, taking advantage of so ex-
cellent a target, spent his ammunition
prodigally.
“He hasn’t a dog’s chance. Poor damned
fool!” said the major ruefully.
And so it proved. Five yards from the
others’ shelter he stumbled, half fell, re-
covered with, a tremendous effort, ran with
his burden over the sheltering bank of the
wadi, and collapsed at the medical officer’s
feet.
An hour later Sergeant Ellis was lying-
insensible on the field operating table, while
a skilful surgeon cleansed and repaired the
pierced organs, and hummed a tune as he
worked.
But it was the gentle old padre who minis-
tered to the last needs of No. 1548 Trooper
James Reedy.

At the regimental re-union the chairman
was concluding his speech. “For some this
great sacrifice was the culmination of a life
of high purpose and splendid endeavour; for
some, maybe, it was the one noble act in a
life misspent and misdirected. We honour
them all. Gentlemen, ‘Our Fallen Com-
rades.’ ”
Mr. D. H. Ellis, J.P., and president of
his local shire, a man of substance and
merit, looked soberly at his inverted glass.
“Strange,” he mused, “that a man can re-
member so much in two minutes. But, then,
what a lot can happen in two seconds!
Poor damn-fool, good-fellow Reedy. I hope
God pays you what I’m owing you.” Then,
aloud: “I beg your pardon, Bill. I didn’t
get what you said, there’s such a blasted
noise going on here.”
ACK.
A R a llafe of Blossomes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sweet Bridget blusht and therewithall
Fresh blossomes from her cheekes did fall;
I thought at first ’twas but a dream,
Till after I had handled them,
And smelt them ; then they smelt to me
As blossomee of the almond-tree.”
Herrick saw you, long ago,
In the Spring of some lost year,
Sudden radiance bestow
On the boughs that were so drear —-
Ev’ry rigid line severe
Veiled and softened by your glee—
And your beauty brought him cheer,
Blossomes of the almond-tree.
In some orchard did you blow
Down in “this dull Devonshire,”
Scattering your fragrant snow
O’er the young grass springing near?
Or did your fresh grace appear
Like a fairy troop set free
In some Cambridge close austere,
Blossomes of the almond-tree?
’Twas sweet Bridget’s cheeks aglow,
Kindling with a blush sincere,
Caught his roving fancy so
He their monument must rear;
Six lines hold their beauty clear
Mirrored for our eyes to see
And your daintiness ensphere,
Blossomes of the almond-tree,
Still as sweet and still as dear
To the poet and the bee
Breaks your tender glory here,
Blossomes of the almond-tree.
