Marcus Clarke's Minor Writings.
A good, though not a complete view of Marcus
Clarke’s minor writings, is given in the memorial
volume published in 1890 under the editorship of
Hamilton Mackinnon. The editor, who contri-
butes an introductory “biography” and “mono-
graph, ” was qualified for his task in that he was
intimately acquainted with Clarke and Clarke’s
sincere admirer. His head and hand are so heavy,
however; his commentary occasionally so stupid
and conventional, and his sense of humour so wan
and meagre ; that the general effect of his prefaces
is unlucky, even evil. The nimble spirit of Marous
Clarke was the last that should have been en-
tombed in the leaden coffin of such a dull, well-
meaning friend. Yet the selection of pieces in
the volume is comprehensive and good. To soothe
the palates of “ respectable ” subscribers, and “de-
cently ” shroud the memory of the man whose whole
mind and life were in the bourgeois commonplace
sense indecent, some of Clarke’s most character is-
tic articles and paragraphs have been omitted —
notably the anti-theological article on “Civilisa-
tion Without Delusion,” and the controversial
letter which followed in reply to Bishop Moore-
house’s criticism; but more than sufficient remains
to adequately represent Clarke’s splendid talent.
The volume, for some time out of print, has re-
cently been reprinted in sections from the old
plates, and these are sold at a price which brings
them within the reach of all Australians who de-
sire a full understanding of the most brilliant
journalist and novelist that Australia has nour-
ished.
* * * *
Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke was born at Lon-
don in 1846. At the death of his father in 1864 he
was sent to Australia with some £7OO in his
pocket, to make his fortune. His uncle, a Yic.
Judge, obtained him a clerkship in the
Bank of Australasia, which he held for a
few months only. He went to a station near
Glenorcliy in 1865, “ gaining colonial experience ”;
returned to Melbourne in 1867, and joined the
Argus staff; started the Yorick Club in 1868:
married in 1869 ; went to Tasmania in 1870, and
wrote “ For the Term of His Natural Life ” in
1870-71; was given the place of secretary to
Melb. Public Library trustees; for ten years
wrote articles, plays, stories, sketches, for half-a-
dozen newspapers and theatres, and was known
as Melbourne’s brightest, most improvident Bohe-
mian ; became insolvent and lost his place in the
Library; lost also health, spirits, capacity, and
dribbled to death in 1881 at the age of 35.
“ Reader,” says Hamilton Mackinnon with excru-
ciating bathos, “let us draw the veil over this
sad scene. The sorrow caused by the passing
away of so bright a spirit is too mournful to dwell
upon.”
* • * *
Seeing that Marcus Clarke was in many ways
bo lovable and sympathetic a man—he would strip
himself of everything for a friend in need—it is
singular that his shorter stories and sketches so
rarely show warm enthusiasm, simple emotion.
For the most part they sparkle coldly, illumined
by the hea'd but hardly ever heated by the heart.
Yet the pages in “His Natural ' Life,” for
example, which tell how Tommy and Billy “did
it,” have a true, natural pathos which Clarke
must have felt keenly ; and throughout the novel
there is ever and again a glow of genuine
humanity. But Clarke’s other work, with rare
exceptions, has no humanity whatever. He
writes as cleverly as Thackeray, and often in
Thackeray’s vein, but there is seldom a
glimpse of Thackeray’s heart. Clarke was
usually oontent to pile epithet and epigram
upon the surface of things, without attempt-
ing to sound the human depths. And when,
perhaps understanding his deficiencies, he deliber-
ately tried to move his readers by pathetic art, he
failed more dismally than Dickens at his most
mawkish moments. For Dickens at least was
sincere, though in the attempt to reach “effects ”
corresponding with his emotion hfe strained his
art to breaking-point, and his work was false.
Dickens has tried to cheat his readers, but it is
nearly certain that he also cheated himself. In
that grotesque and laboured sketch of “ Pretty
Dick,” which almost moves his dul-l editor to
tears, Clarke has never cheated himself. The
anti-climax shrieks throughout; and he was far
too good a workman not to have heard it. It is
the story of a child lost in the bush, elaborated
with portentous art, as if the writer were saying,
“Now I will write a pathetic tale. I will wring
out your tears, and play upon your emotions ;your
entrails shall be rent with compassion, and you
shall say, ‘ Oh, the fine writer ! the great writer !”*
And always the tale is mechanical; the psychology
unnatural. From the Dickensy beginning—
A hot day. A very hot day on the plains. A very hot
day up in the ranges, too. The Australian sun had got
up suddenly with a savage swoop. ... He eyen went
down at night with a red face, as much as to say, “ Take
oare, I shall be hotter than ever to-morrow! "
to the careful ending—such an ending from the
Clarke of the Moorehouse controversy !
Pretty -Dick was lying on his face, with his head on bis
arm. God had taken him home.
all is hard-ground artificiality. Clarke must have
known his failure. And he cynically sent it for
print, with his tongue in hfe cheek at the dull
audienoe of Mackinnons !
* * * *
Naturally Clarke, failing in emotion, wrote no
poetry. Clever verses, of Gourse, suoh as any man
with a little pen-skill can accomplish; and the
only two worth preserving, “Ten Years Ago”
and “For an Album,” are attractively touched
with sentiment in the Thackerayan manner.
Clarke’s verse-translations have no virtue.
* * • »
When Clarke was ait his best he had a peg to
hang his-thoughts on. Some of his fresh presenta-
tions of old .Australian stories are wonderfully
well done. He hhs taken a dull record and sown
it with flashes of wit aod phrase, as Dumas sowed
the work of his collaborators, tiH the whole page
shines and glitters. And he brings usually a
shrewd, critical head to aid his commentary.
Discussing Mitchelfs, the Irish patriot-convict’s,
escape from' Tasmania, he points out that the
Imputed chivalry was very hollow :
A word, however, about the manner of escape. It is
hard to say that Mitohell broke his parole, but I am afraid
that at best his esoapewsß duetto melodramatic quibble.
He certainty- gave up' his “ ticket-of-leave ” before he
attempted escape, but he made all the arrangements tor
escape by virtue of the liberty which that ticket-of-leave
afforded him. His parole obtained him interviews with
Smyth, freedom to plot, money, horses, and arms. To
march like a stage hero into a police-office, and with hand
on pistol (purchased by virtue of the parole) disdainfully
ask an unarmed police-magistrate to take him into cus-
tody, was not an honest withdrawal of his plighted
word. To fulfil the terms of his contract with the
Government, he should have placed himself in the hands
of the constable in the condition he had been in when
the parole was granted him namely, unarmed, a
prisoner, with bars and stone walls around him, and no
fleet horse waiting at the door to carry him to safety, or
bold companion at his side ready to withstand attempt
at capture. Poor Smith O’Brien, eating his heart in his
cell at Maria Island, better understood the nature of the
promise of a gentleman. I am willing to believe, how-
ever, that Mitchell—perpetually posing as a hero—was
blinded by the melodramatic heroics of the proceeding to
a true comprehension of its merits.
That is a gloss on the text of the escape which
John Farrell, in his recent recital of the facts,
omitted to give.
* * * *
One inclines to believe, then, that much of the
force of “ His Natural Life ” must have lain perdu
in the records on which Clarke based his story.
But Clarke had a fine faculty of dramatic insight
and dramatic expression. Given the ore he could
refine it; given the situation, the scene, the men,
he could bring all the contours and contrasts into
prominence. His style is an admirable
journalist’s style, but not always good from
the point of literature. It is full of
light, but lacks colour and harmony. The
clean, staccato sentences grow monotonous:
they want a varied rhythm and sweep. In “His
Natural Life, ” Clarke has often tried to get these
things, and often succeeded. His brain was
highly receptive and impressible, and seems to
have largely reflected the motion and hue of the
medium in which it had just previously been
merged. Some passages of Clarke seem modelled
on Balzac; some on Hugo; some on Disraeli,
Thackeray, and Dickens. He took his literary
property where he found it; and his contem-
poraries called him a not too scrupulous borrower.
Perhaps he followed the Thackerayan model more
closely than any other, since in mental vision he
was nearly kin with Thackeray. But he lacked
Thackeray’s breadth and depth. It is sufficient
that he is himself, and that the book which con-
centrates himself can never in Australia be for-
gotten.
Henry James.
If you attempt thus late in the day to discover
from English reviewers what position Henry
James _ occupies among novelists, you will meet
with little else than frustration. It would seem
that of an author who has been following the
trade of fiction for 28 years they have no new
word to say, and doubtless it is not worth while
repeating the old. His standing is assured ;so
much from their attitude seems certain —and for
the rest you can please yourself as to exactly
where it is. No literary paper ever neglects to
review his latest book, but you will find that is of
absolutely no help. The things that are said of
him can be said with almost as much truth of
about half-a-dozen other writers, and yet his work
is like that of no one else. Of what the story
happens to be about, you can, with attention,
gam a decisive picture; but what the book is,
what value it represents, how its claims as litera-
ture must be answered, are matters that are wholly
blank. Eor the most part, the “ critics ” have no
opinion—not even the wrong one they are entitled
to—and, in short, you have to conclude that for
them a book possesses nothing but its story, that
it has no greater measure of value.
* * * *
One outward fact which, if you wander through
weak columns of literary gossip, you are liable to
stumble on is that his literary existence is regarded
by affectionate readers as a plea for the publishers’
English habit of issuing uncut books. His flavor
is so richly delicate that you love to turn it over in
your mouth ; the atmosphere with which he sur-
rounds you is so luxurious that you hate to feel
yourself exhausting it. He is the apostle of fine
shades and subtle meanings; his extraordinary
intellectual vividness enables him to capture allur-
ing phases of the indefinable. The background of
human consciousness is his special playground.
* * * •
His literary career is sharply defined into two
parts. The first yields about twenty-four volumes,
the product of twenty years ; and the latter seven,
issued since 1895. There is between them a gap of
a few years, during which he published nothing,
his attention being directed to the stage. That he
met with but little success there can be no cause
for wpnder. One so essentially an expositor ‘of all
the human subtleties that the stage cannot present
was foredoomed to failure. The genius who is to
reunite literature and the drama belongs of neces-
sity to quite a "different order from that of Henry
James.
* * • *
Yet students of fiction have no cause to complain
of the desertion; his tribute of repentance has
been of the highest and best. He came back more
riehlyjuidowed; not indeed because of anything
he borrowed in the atmosphere of the drama, but
became in silence he could not fail to gather fur-
ther intellectual strength. As the reviewers put
it, he had developed a “new manner.” His style
had greatly altered; he came back to ask his
readers to give him a little closer attention than
was demanded by others, and on his side he pro-
mised adequate return. The compact was made,
and is being faithfully fulfilled.
* » * *
The chief elements of all the books issued up to
1890, the distinguishing oharaoteristies that mark
them as the product of his individuality, are their
depth of subtlety, their reality, and simple direct-
ness. What he has to say is presented with a
simplicity that reveals the absenoe of effort.
Every fine shade of emotion seems to have as
easily surrendered to the magic of his style as if
it were the merest commonplace. At the same
time his prose has not the highest distinction. It
would, for instanoe, be unwise to compare it with
the cultured simplicity oi Andrew Lang’s. It
rather lies between tjbat and the laboured plain-
ness, the constant effort to be exact, that has
marked the later work of Howells.
* * * *
In the minor matter of having a storyffio tell
his claim is distinctly weak. It is rather that he
has real human oreatures to present, people who
are possessed with natural passions, who act only
from natural motives. His fidelity to what he
knows to be true' deserves, in an age of rant and
falsity, our lovingbudmiration. The voice of the
shrieking superlative must in his younger days
have been as deafening as it is now ; the rewards
it offered were, in comparison, scarcely less sub-
stantial. But it had up attractions for him ;
through it all he has remained faithful to the be-
lief that life has 'little to do with superlatives, and
literature a good deal less.
But it is in his short stories, forming as they do
nearly half his output, that his best work has been
done. Idonotinsist that they are all of the one excel-
lence ; on the contrary, I am ready to acknowledge
that many of them fail. The difficulty of having
no story to offer clings with its old insistence, and
is, contradictorily enough, more noticeable here
than elsewhere. His wonderful talent is at its
best in depicting subtle phases of our existence, in
presenting scenes that Verily did happen, but
which life refused to round into completeness.
The most notable exception in this connection, the
one story that combines a finest subtlety and a
matchless completeness is “The Path of Duty.”
For this little piece of work, I would, in an only
moderately reckless mood, be anxious to assert its
olaim to be considered as teaching nearer to artis-
tic perfection than any other short story in our
language.
* * * *
It can be taken as settled that Henry James is
in no danger of popularity. He has even escaped
the infliction recently fallen on Meredith —that of
becoming a fashionable fad. I should like to
think that in his long career it has been his re-
markable distinction to have never been within
sight of public favor. But it is to be acknow-
ledged that twice he has been near the verge.
“ Daisy Miller ” and “The Other House ’' really
threatened his position. The case of the former
may be said to be due to the fact that in its
American little heroine it offered to fiction some-
thing- that was entirely new at that time, while
inferior merit is the only solution one meets with
for the latter. “The Other House” isn’t habit-
able —there are doors that won’t shut, and holes
in the roof that you could put your hand through.
How Henry James came to make the awful mis-
take of putting his furniture into it would, one
likes to think, tax even his subtlety to explain.
* * * *
It is in his later work, however, in his “new
manner ” that he is at his finest. It is here that
if you bring with you a little attention he will
take you with him and show you things that are
outside the vision of your everyday. It is here
that one feels safe in saying that in regard to
fiction he is, with the exception of Meredith, in-
tellectually the biggest man in England to-day.
But what specifically represents the added value
of his later work, one is left to discover for oneself.
Reviewers have no opinion, here as elsewhere;
the most they will venture on is that the analysis
is more acute and the style more epigramatic.
To which can be added that the style has also
acquired an intensity that rises, at the merest lift,
into majestic emphasis. This was something that
really required to be done, this illustration of the
fact that the highest note of emphasis could be
reached without raising the voice to a shriek.
* * * *
But this at most accounts for only half of his
new equipment; the rest is included in the fact
that his point of view is now at a much higher
altitude. He sees further and clearer. His char-
acters are presented with a completeness we are
totally unaccustomed to; his people live even out-
side his story. Ido not wish to say that they are
more human than in his earlier work, or than in
the work of certain others, but that they have a
wider relation to life. Novelists had long been
of opinion that their characters must have their
whole being centred in telling the story, that they
must not even think of anything else. Howells,
becoming recently convinced of the limits of this
creed, had tried his hand at giving his creations a
freer scope by letting them have part in the lives
of people unrelated to the story. But Henry
J ames’s achievement is much greater, and much
truer for artistic effect.
* * * *
However, he has not yet carried his method to
its perfection. In some of his books there is a
mixture of the new style and the old that is most
irritating. You have sometimes to drop the mood
of sympathy that gives you the author’s point of
view, finding it almost a hindrance, and suddenly
in the middle of a sentence you are again in need
of it. “In the Cage,” however (which is in point
of publication his second latest volume), keeps
magnificently to the one keynote. The story pre-
sents a young lady who by her positi >n is possessed
of a peculiarly appetizing outlook on life. As a
telegraphist in a small branch office situated in a
fashionable suburb of London she comes to lead
two lives. Besides her own barren existence with
its future surrounded by her engagement to the
perfection of the type of British tradesman she
comes to have a part in the existence of her cus-
tomers. Out of the telegrams that are handed in
to her she weaves her stories and “ lives more and
more into the world of whiffs and glimpses, and
finds her divinations work! faster and stretch
further.”
During her first weeks she had often gasped at the sums
people were willing to pay for the stuff they transmitted
—the much love’s, the awful regrets, the compliments
and wonderments, and vain, vague gestures that cost the
price of a new pair of boots. She had had a way then of
glancing at the people’s faces, but she had early learned
that if you became a telegraphist you soon ceased to be
astonished. Her eye for types amounted, nevertheless,
to genius, and there were those she liked and those she
hated, hetifeeling for the latter of which grew to a posi-
tive possession, an instinct of observation and detection.
There were the brazen women, as she called them, of the
higher anti, lower fashion, whose squanderings and grasp-
ings, whose struggles and secrets, and love-affairs and
lies, she tracked and stored up agaipst them, till she had
at moments, in private, a triumphant, vicious feeling of
mastery and power, a sepse of having their silly guilty
secrets in her pocket, in her small retentive brain, and
thereby knowing so much more about them than they
suspected, or would care to think. There were those she
would have liked to betray, to trip up, to bring down
with words altered and fatal, and all through a personal
hostility, provoked by the lightest signs, by their acci-
dents of tone and manner, by the particular kind of rela-
tion sjie always happens instantly to feel. . . . She
recognised quite as much as those of her sex whom she
would have liked bo help, to see more of ; and that
alternative as weH operated exactly through the hazard
of personal sympathy, her vision for silver threads and
moonbeams, and her gift for keeping the elues and
finding her way in the tangle. The moonbeams and silver
threads presented at moments all the vision of what poor
she might have made of happiness. Blurred and blank as
the whole tiling often inevitably or mercifully became,
she could still, through crevices find crannies, be stupefied,
especially by what, in spite of all reasoning, touched the
sorest place in her consciousness, the revelation of the
golden shower flying about, without a gleam of golcUfor
herself.
* * * •
An incompetent critic reviewing this book in the
incompetent Literary World, spoke of it as an
exhibition of rampant analysis. Well, one’s out-
look is necessarily limited by one’s insight—‘‘the
eye sees what the eye brings means of seeing. ”
The poor dear man was plainly in search of a
story—something to keep him awake till bedtime
—and found that this volume was for his purpose
really valueless. One can but praise the magnifi-
cent determination to do his duty, to enter his
protest against this sort of thing being palmed off
on a patient public. And so his criticism remains
a monument of conscientiousness. And at the back
of it all, you can hear (if you listen) his distracted
cry : “What in Heaven ! s name have I to do with
literature, or literature to do with me ? ”
* * » *
It is, however, far from my wish to assert that Mr.
James’s later work is all on the one plane, or even
that the best of it might not, had he wished, have
been something better. Fine passages are most
abundant, but false notes are scarcely less so. He
has a trick of choosing the wrong word, of exhibit-
ing a clever play of adjectives whose last purpose
is to simplify his meaning. His dialogue, which
once presented him at his best, now reveals quite
another phase of him. His stories are not de-
veloped ; one sees dimly the splendid thing into
which the motif of “In the Cage ” might have
been worked, but the book remains little more than
a fragment, with its difficulties of construct!.::
and solution plainly shirked.
* * * *
What may we expect from him in the future ?
It is a question that does not produce much agita-
tion in literary circles : and, on the whole, it need
not. Mr. James enters on his 57th year this
month, and one feels sadly that the chances are
altogether against one’s hopes. He lives at Eye,
in Sussex, and has been so long a resident of
England that one at times forgets he is an Ameri-
can. The house he occupies is some two hundred
years old, but would seem to have but a poor idea
of the honor now being conferred upon it. A
recent dastardly attempt to burn itself owes its
frustration to the fact that Mr. James was at work
at the deadly hour of three in the morning.
* » • •
On the whole, his work may be said to represent
a most brilliant contribution to present-day litera-
ture. But the thought that remains side by side
with that is, that it needed only the infusion 'of
some minor qualities into his individuality to have
enabled him to give us something that we will
never get from anyone writing now. Over thirty
volumes ! —by far the greater majority of them
reaching to a very bright standard of excellence.
But where is the masterpiece we had every right
to expect, that in justice to his wonderful talents
should have long ago arrived ?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Songs of Sin.
The songs the world has ever known,
The world has ever sung —
Since first the spinning star-dust closed
And in the ether swung—
Tell hut of women, wine, and fray,
And those who score the win —
While girls have eyes and men have strength,
While days have light and nights have length,
We sing the Songs of Sin.
What time the fateful Phryne sings
Her soft, seductive song,
The waltz-tune grips our hearts and swings
Us pantingly along;
Till, in the narrowing vortex sweet,
Whirl we to join her strain,
And through the warm, dark night repeat
The ling’ring kiss-refrain . . .
And, when at last the day is come
And sunbeams trespass in,
Still in her circling arms we hum
The siren Songs of Sin.
We fling a chorus from our lips
Unsteady all, but bold ;
While lucent luscious liquor drips
In crimson drops and gold.
A nude Bacchante beats the rhyme,
Astride a cask on high,
And swings a bottle to the tune
We drain our goblets by.
We may be out of time and tune,
Our voices cracked or thin,
But all is perfect when we croon
The swilling Songs of Sin.
We sing to make the wide world shake
From peak and plain and shore
The baton thrown aloft to wake
The blatant bass of war.
We feel the lust of fray anew,
We hear the empires made —
The sharp staccato rising through
The flame-fringed barricade.
The crash of guns, the clash of steel,
The battle’s deadly din,
Bings round us as we sing—and feel—
The slaughter Songs of Sin.
The songs the world will ever know
The world will ever sing —
Till Gabriel trumpets loud and low
The scattered souls to bring—
Will tell of ivoman, wine and fray
And all the joys akin —
While girls have eyes to flash and flit,
While men can kiss and drink and hit,
We’ll sing the Songs of Sin /
Yic. .
McG.
The Town.
A huge monstrosity
Man made. An octopus of stone—
Its arms o’er land and sea
Outspread, to clutch at flesh and bone.
All day it belches steam,
Putridity, and smoke, and grime ;
Its thousand eyes, the gas lamps, gleam ;
Its blood, the sewer slush and slime.
It feeds, and growls, and lies
Sullen, and all unsatisfied,
Tainting the virtue of the skies,
And ravishing the country side.
In fitful dreams it roars
At night, and sleeps in murky mist
And soddenness, and snores
Like some huge bloated sensualist.

“ Beggar 1 ” that’s the way she said it,
With a sneer—the little wretch !
Beggar—l am not a beggar.
No, I’m rich—l’m very rich !
Gold ! what’s gold but yellow metal ?
Those who lose it mostly gain :
I’ve a mine just full of rubies
And some castles built in Spain.
Wouldn’t have me, silly vixen !
Pretty ?—well, her cheeks’ alarm
When I told her, looked like roses,
And her mouth was very warm :
Warm, like blossom hiding honey
(Other bees may taste and cling).
“ Beggar ! ” Ah, I turned and left with
Lift of head and stride of king.
I make love to lovely ladies,
Queens in royal blue and red ;
Woo their lips in ancient story,
Call them from the lordly dead.
True, ’tis true they lack existence
Such as she has—Well, what thru ?
Kisses have a subtle poison,
Love puts cap and bells on men.
Money ! money isn’t riches !
Tried to sting, the little wretch !
Didn’t ? —no, of course she didn’t.
For I’m rich—oh, lam rich.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
light, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Payette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and life
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle pf
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteei s,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. Jhe fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Hoodie was heard as never
was heard before or since.

MR. WANT’S RETURN.
“ The Premier hopes that his late Attorney-General will not
further complicate matters for the Government by coming back pre-
cipitately and emphasising his opposition to the decisions of the Pre- .
miers’Conference. Mr. Reid thinks that Mr. Wants health wfll
preclude an early departure from London. Another reason that m-
duces the Premier to imagine
'that his late colleague will
prolong his stay in the old
land is the fact that in "con-
nection with a mining venture
in Queensland, Mr. Want has,
it is stated, succeeded in sud-
denly amassing a fortune of be-
tween £30,000 and £40,000.
“ Prince Henry of Prussia, who was present at
the launch of the North German Lloyd Company’s
new steam tender at Shanghai, «met with an acci-
dent as the vessel was leaving the ' ways.” The
order was given to release the ‘ dogs,’ when a large
piece of wood fell from the vessel’s bows, striking
the Prince on the head. He entered into the sub-
sequent proceedings with appacent unconcern. ’

SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
The Federal Fight—Sydney Against
Australia.
The passage of the Federal Enabling Bill
through New South Wales Legislative
Council—thanks to the special appointment
of 12 new members—once more remits the
question of Federation to New South Wales
electors. At last year’s polling New South
Wales electors approved the principle of
Federation, and by a majority of over 5000
approved the Commonwealth scheme adopted
by the specially-elected Federal Convention.
But the popular vote was nullified by Parlia-
mentary enactment. The Parliamentary
provision that 80,000 votes must be recorded
in order to carry the Bill (there was no pro-
vision that 80,000 votes must be recorded in
order to defeat it) upheld the minority
against the majority ; and the Bill, though
carried, was technically lost. The people’s
representatives in Parliament, themselves
elected by bare majorities, had succeeded in
stifling the direct expression of the will of a
majority of the people.
* • * *
Then New South Wales Premier Reid re-
opened negotiations with the other provinces
—Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania—
which had passed the same Bill that New
South Wales had passed. In these provinces
there was no Parliament-enacted minimum-
vote, and the opinion of the majority
was effective, as it should be. A Confer-
ence of Premiers was held ; and Premier
Reid secured the assent of the other Premiers
to some alterations intended to make the
Bill more favorable to New South Wales.
Among other things, he secured that the
capital of the Commonwealth shall be in
New South Wales, but not in Sydney. It
would be a public calamity to New South
Wales if it were in Sydney, since Sydney is
already far too huge, and has impoverished
the country districts by sucking to itself the
men and money which should make the
country districts thrive. It is this new Bill
which is now to be submitted to the electors
of New South Wales.
* * * *
In spite of the concessions made by the
other provinces upon the original scheme
approved by the Federal Convention, the
new Bill has been opposed and depreciated
by a section of Sydneyites just as persistently
as was the old one. In Sydney there are
many men who are the enemies of any
possible Federation whatever. Some of
them are landlords and property-owners,
who fear that their rents and profits will be
reduced if—by putting the capital elsewhere
than in Sydney, or by letting the interior trade
take its natural channels instead of dragging it
to Sydney by hook or crook—the Sydney
monopoly at the expense of the country is
in any way reduced. Doubtless the Sydney
landlords are right, from their own narrow
point of view.. The more people there are
concentrated in Sydney (people who should,
many of them, be engaged as producers in
the country), and the more Govt, money
there is expended in Sydney to help feed
these people (money which should be devoted
to assisting the producing industries in the
country), the higher will be rents and the
greater the value of Sydney property. The
Sydney landlords have strong reason for
opposing Federation. But do New South
Wales and Australia exist for the conveni-
ence and profit of Sydney landlords ?
* * * *
. other opponents of any possible Federa-
tion are the Sydney importers and their
allies among agents, brokers, and retailers,
the Sydney importers have built up a very
profitable trade by standing at the Sydney
gate and levying commissions on goods
brought into Australia from Europe and
America. Many of these goods artisans in
Sydney and other towns could be themselves
manufacturing with advantage to the com-
munity , since, when trade is properly organ-
ised, the artisan in the town and the producer
in the country are natural allies, exchanging
t e fruits of their labor to the common good.
But the policy of the Sydney importing riim
—which is an. enormous aggregation of in-
terests with influence in every path of
national life—has always been to discounten-
ance the growth of local manufactures, since
every fresh local manufacture means ’a loss
m commissions to the importers. The Sydney
importers understand that Federation—with
all the barriers broken down between the
provinces will mean an immense expan-
sion of inter-Australian trade, and perhaps
some temporary reduction of oversea trade
and the profits upon it. They understand
that Federation, with a Protective tariff, or
even a revenue tariff against the world,
will mean an immense expansion of local
manufactures, implying fresh markets for
local producers. The Sydney importers do
not want Federation because they exist on
foreign trade, and every development of local
industry tends to decrease foreign trade.
But do New South Wales and Australia
exist for the convenience and profit of the
Sydney importers ?
* * * *
Anotheropponent of any practicable Feder-
ation is the Sydney Daily Telegraph. This
important newspaper depends chiefly for its
prosperity upon the prosperity of 'Sydney,
and anything which tends to diminish the
importance of Sydney tends to diminish its
profits. It has the same reason as the Syd-
ney landlords for dreading that Federation
may to some extent reduce the Sydney
monopoly which has attracted 31 per cent,
of the population of New South Wales to the
overgrown metropolis. And, as it supports
the foreign-trade policy, it sees eye to eye
with the Sydney importers. But the
Sydney Telegraph has a more direct
and private interest in opposing Federa-
tion. It is endeavoring to secure a great
circulation in the country districts
at the expense of the country press
and thus to gain much of the Sydney adver-
tising support which at present is chiefly
enjoyed by the rival newspaper, the S.M.
Herald. While Australia is , unfederated,
and New South Wales isolated, the Tele-
graph proprietary may hope to continue in
possession of the enormous subsidy which it
receives in being allowed to send its papers
all over New South Wales free by post—to
the loss of the country press and at the ex-
pense of the general taxpayer. The amazing
system by which a private trading concern
has its goods carried free on the State rail-
ways.at the cost of the general revenue would
certainly not be permitted to continue under
Federation. New South Wales would be
brought into line with Queensland, with
victoria, with every other country—since no
other civilised community dreams of taxing
itself in order to pay dividends to a private
newspaper proprietary. Under Federation
the country press would enjoy its legitimate
circulation, but the Daily Telegraph pro-
prietary would lose heavily—directly in
postage, and indirectly in the limitations
put to the Telegraph scheme of using a
country ascendancy to acquire ascendancy in
Sydney. No wonder the Telegraph opposes
Federation.. But do New South Wales and
Australia exist for the convenience and profit
of the Sydney Daily Telegraph 1
* * * *
It is plain that the chief reasons connected
with the opposition to the Commonwealth
Bui are reasons connected with the aggran-
disement of Sydney. These reasons would
apply with equal force to any conceivable
form of Federation ; since any form of Fede
ration which sets a Federal Parliament sitting
elsewhere in New South Wales than in
Sydney, and which permits southern and
western New Soutli Wales to find its natural
trade-outlet elsewhere than in Sydney, must
be abominable to the anti-Australian party.
I heir reasons are not in the least connected
with the exorcised bogey of the Braddon
Blot, or with the exploded myth of crushing
extra-taxation, or with the acquiescence of
Queensland, or with any other of the stalk-
ing-horses under cover of which anti-
Federal arrows may be shot. The main, and
almost the only reason of the anti-Australian
party is that Federation, however advan-
tageous to New South Wales and Australia,
may diminish the Sydney supremacy—
temporarily, at all events. So they want
the capital in Sydney ; and they will damn
any scheme of Federation which does not
put the capital in Sydney.
* * * *
The capital in Sydney is out of the question.
It is against the best interests of Sydney
itself; it is much more against the in-
terests of New South Wales, which is
even now bled white that Sydney pro-
perty-owners and importers and the Daily
Telegraph newspaper proprietary the
whole anti-Federal ring—grow fat at the
expense of the Men on the Land, the men
who sweat and starve to make the country
prosperous. And the capital in Sydney
would certainly never be conceded by the
other federating provinces. The Federal
Convention Bill is not perfect, but it is, and
was, the best compromise obtainable. New
South Wales Premier Reid, at the Pre-
miers' Conference, found himself unable to
materially alter it—simply because he could
not propose anything practically better,
more generally acceptable. If, therefore, the
present chance is rejected by New South
Wales, we stand committed for years to the
squalid dissensions and grave dangers and
losses of disunion—with the certainty that,
vyhen the question is again approached, the
Sydney vested interests (which it is even now
difficult to sweep away) will have grown so
mountainous that nothing but the stress of a
war for Australian existence will be likely to
end them.
State Paper.
It is reported by many unreliable authorities
that Premier Seddon will probably seek to dish
his opponents at the coming Maoriland elec-
tions by announcing a vigorous borrowing and
public works policy. Also, many experienced
liars in S.A. circulate the same report as re-
gards Kingston; and Dreary Dickson, in
Queensland, has already gone to the country on
the good old loan and works policy, with very
' profitable results for Dickson aforesaid. The
report as regards Seddon and Kingston gains
color from the fact that, out of the seven Aus-
tralasian Premiers who have to go to the
country every three years or oftener, at least
five generally go there on a vigorous borrowing
policy. It is a thing that is always handy ; it
always furnishes an oppoil unity to say some-
thing bright and hopeful about the “resources
of this great country” and how they are going
to be “developed ; ” the dullest ass of an elec-
tor can understand it when he is told that
money is going to be shot about promiscuously
and a railway-station made in everybody’s
front garden ; also, the dullest ass of a Premier
can do that kind of work.
* * • »
The Bgeeetin also has ideas about a borrow-
policy. It has a pleasant theory about how
these provinces among them can raise
£8,000,00 ) or £10,000,000, or more, without in-
terest, with which to build reproductive rail-
ways, &e., the money to be repaid some day,
when the country is quite rested, out of the
earnings of these railways. That is, always
provided the country feels like repaying the
loan at all ; if it doesn’t feel that way, it
really doesn’t matter, and the earnings of these
railways and other works which cost nothing
can be set aside to form a fund for building
more railways, etc., which won’t cost anything
either, till the country is covered with
valuable public works which cost nothing
at all. A good deal of the liability would
gradually wear away, or get burnt, or fall
overboard and be lost, or get demolished
by rats, or blow away, or otherwise dis-
appear, and the rest could stand till the Day
of Judgment. In fact, if sufficient time were
allowed, it would practically all disappear by
its own volition. The idea is simply the old,
useful one of an issue of State paper-money, and
it isn’t proposed to start it on any wild or ex-
perimental principle, but to keep to the wmll-
trodden paths of precedent, and to be as deeply
conservative over it as the most virulent Tory
could desire.
* * * *
At present Queensland has an issue of State
notes, on a small scale and based on very stupid
principles. In the other six provinces there
are in circulation over ,£4,000,000 of the paper
obligations of the banks, which means that the
banks have the loan of £4,000,000 of the public’s
money. There is no visible reason why the
State shouldn t have the loan of that sum
instead. If the State chose to make its notes
legal tender and not redeemable in gold—for a
number of years, at least—there is no possible
reason why it shouldn’t do so. The public
really never wants gold for that £4,000,000 of
bank paper ; it keeps circulating year in and
year out, and though the small outer fringe of
the mass keeps coming in to be cashed, there
is always a reliable £4,000,000 that remains in
circulation. If the State was always will-
ing to guarantee the soundness of its own
paper by accepting it in payment of taxes,
there is no possible reason why it should
not remain at par as long as the State
lasts. Ihe State itself only requires gold for
the purpose of paying its foreign obligations ;
and so long as Australasia remains a gold-pro-
ducing country that will probably be forthcom-
ing. For the other three-fourths of its
outgoings—the purely local outgoings—it can
get through well enough if it keeps receiving its
own legal tender paper on account of taxes,
and paying it out again to cover local expendi-
ture. The State paper would be no dirtier, no
more infectious, no more walked-upon by
microbes, than the private banking paper now
in circulation. And it would have much better
ultimate security behind it.
* * » *
In arldition to this there is another side to
the case. There are £21,000,000 of gold re-
serves in the banks of the Seven Provinces.
Under the Canadian law, if it were applied in
Australia, the State would lay its hands gently
on over £8,000,000 of this as a practically per-
petual loan without interest. And the process
would do no visible harm to the banks while
doing a vast amount of good to the State
—provided the money was wisely applied.
The Canadian law requires the banks of the
Dominion to keep 40 per cent, of their reserves
in State-notes, and the application of a similar
law in Australasia would mean that the banks
would hand over ,£8,000,000 of gold to the
Government and receive paper in exchange.
The paper, being legal-tender, would answer
all local purposes just as well as the metal does.
The gold-reserve lies festering in the bank’s
cellars, earning no interest, and the reserve of
three-fifths gold and two-fifths State-guaran-
teed paper-money might fester there just as
well. But, while the bank’s reserves wouldn’t
be really weakened, the State would be
£8,000,000 to the good, which sum would cost
it practically nothing, while the same sum, if
borrowed at 3 per cent., would cost £240,000 a
year.
* * * *
And that £8,000,000, if it were spent in
building much-needed railways that produced
even 2 per cent, on their outlay, would yield
the State a clear revenue of £160,000 a year.
How much more it would yield in increased
land values, increased income-tax, Customs,
excise, etc., arising through increase of popu-
lation, it is impossible to guess. By the appli-
cation of the Canadian State note svstem in
these provinces Maoriland could raise about
£1,500,000, which would go a long way towards
finishing its three great trunk ra.ilways without
adding anything to the national burdens.
Victoria could raise about £3,ooo,ooo—suffi-
cient to build its principal mallee lines, and to
make the proposed great irrigation channel
from the Murray to the alleged lakes in the
Dry Country. N.S. VV. could find some
£2,500,000 in the same receptacle and lock the
Darling with it, and finish its Broken Hill rail-
way, and do other things. Even S.A. could
raise £900,000, and Tasmania about £400,000
under the Canadian State note system, and
£400,000 would do a lot to open up the road-
less West of the Isle of Lots of Sleep.
* * * *
The Bulletin isn’t proposing a wild or reck-
less experiment or a novel departure of any
kind. It is advocating a system that has been
tried in older and more conservative countries
and found perfectly safe and feasible. It
would be better, no doubt, if Australasia would
pay its way and construct its public works out
of revenue ; but, if it won’t, the next best
thing is to raise the money locally, and by the
cheapest possible process. The cheapest one
this paper knows of is that by which the in-
terest is nothing per cent, and the date of re-
payment practically never. The suggestion is
offered to Maoriland and Victoria in particular,
for various reasons. In Maoriland the demand
for the completion of the three big half-
finished railways is growing very loud ; and
the Opposition is bidding frantically for office
with impossible promises about how it will re-
duce taxation, and push on public works, and
not borrow, and get the needful funds’from
nowhere at all. If Seddon is going to bid against
this party, he also needs to have a public-works
policy, and to find the money from nowhere.
And as Maoriland has a larger note circulation
in proportion to population than any other
province, it is a place where a particularly
handsome rise can be made by the seductive
process advocated above. A promise to raise
£1,500,000 without interest with which to com-
plete the Otago Central and Midland and North
Island Trunk lines should make Maoriland wor-
ship Seddon as it never worshipped Julius
Vogel even in his palmiest days. And in Vic-
toria the community wants to see the railway-
building days back again, and the mallee
country is crying out for water and for means
of communication, and Turner loathes big
loans and interest bills, and he can’t screw-
more taxation out of his awful House of 48
Rich Landlords. Therefore a scheme for rais
ing the wherewithal without interest should
appeal to his inmost soul.

The paper-money process wouldn’t really
make the country £8,000,000 or £10,000,000
richer, but it would make it feel that much
richer, which is practically the same thing.
Victoria was wildly affluent in ’9O, when pro-
perty-values were high, and it was miserably
poor in ’95, when they were low. Yet all the
land was still there, and so were all the build-
ings, and, in addition, there was more cash in
the country and less debt owing by it in the
bad year than in the good one. But the coun-
try felt poor in ’95 all the same, whereas, with
the same assets in ’9O, it felt exceedingly rich.
If the creation of a limited amount of paper-
money can make the country feel richer, then
to ail intents and purposes it will be richer
—and the feeling will be permanent, for the
State paper won’t vanish like the scrip of the
shoddy land banks which made up so much of
Victoria’s alleged wealth in’9o. One thing is
certain : if, by liberating say £8,000,000 of
the money which now earns nothing in the
bank’s cellars, and replacing it with a medium
which will answer the same purpose in the same
cellars, and by making judicious use of the
sum released, the country can come into pos-
session of £8,000,000 of useful public works,
returning 2 per cent, on their cost, it will be
these £8,000,000 wort h of assets to the good.
Also, it will be at least £160,000 a year revenue
to the good. And both these matters are worth
consideration.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Justices’ Injustice.
“ Pandect ” to The Bulletin
At, frequent intervals you print scathing denunciations
of the unpaid magistracy : you have reason. Of course
file weak spot in the system is that J.’sP., fixed in some
country district, gradually, like all other men, come
to divide the inhabitants into two classes—their friends
and their enemies. This, also, is the weak spot in country
juries. P.M.’s and constables, being human, if left too
long in one place, suffer from the same dry-rot, and
become partisans; therefore they should be changed
round at short intervals; while, as for honorary J.’sP.,
as dispensers of justice they should be swept out
of existence at once and for ever That is my
deliberate opinion after 20 years official experience
of them North, South, East, and West. Still, with all the
will to make a mockery of Justice, how small are their
opportunities now compared with what they were? I
give three samples taken at random from the pages
before me—l could as easily give three score—they all
occurred less than 50 years ago in N.S.W., at a time when
a Justice’s power seems to have been practically un-
limited. Ist.—A.B. was charged with seizing and violat-
ing Juliana R (on whose information does not
appear), but Juliana tripped into the witness-box, and
deposed that, although she was seized, there was no
violation, as whatever had occurred was with her
free will and consent, and had been occurring
for months past. Result—accused discharged. Bub
are the police non-plussed ? Not at all. Accused
is at once re-arrested and charged with dis-
honest and disorderly conduct! !! in cohabiting with
Juliana, and, without being called on for a defence, is
sentenced to 12 months’ hard labor in irons ! 1!!! 2nd.—
A. is charged with stealing and eating a pig. B. and 0.
with eating thereof knowing it to be stolen. The evi-
dence—save the mark !—was (1) the arresting constable
swore that two black gins told him they had seen prisoner
kill the pig, and (2) D., a mate of A., 8., and 0., swore
he had helped to eat the pig, being too frightened to re-
fuse. Now, the first rule of evidence is that an informer’s
evidence, by itself, is tainted, and must be corroborated.
Here there was no corroboration, for the constable’s
statement was not evidence at all; but, without being
called on for a defence, A. was sentenced to 75 lashes—B.
and 0. to 50 each. 3rd.—A., an assigned servant,
charged 8., another assigned servant, with stealing
about £1 in silver from A.’s box. There was no
evidence, save A.’s—that the money had ever existed.
A. swore B. was the only man who was near the
hut that day. B. said he had never seen the money,
and never knew A to have had any. 0, the overseer,
being called, stated that in his opinion A was worthy of
belief, but B’s character was indifferent. Result—B to
receive 50 lashes on the bare back 1 and so on. What is
the hardship of the Armidale case quoted by you com-
pared with the above? Let us be thankful for small
merc ies—that the wavback beak has no longer power
to deal out lashes “ on his own.”

Medical Sweating 1 .
Editor Bulletin. —The doctors, egged on by
Bruck, are making a dust about the lodges —
but there is something to be said on both sides
of that question. In some districts it is pull
devil, pull baker—pull doctor, pull patient. The
doctor expects imposition, and the patient ex-
pects neglect and imagination generally
effects a good deal more than the facts would.
The doctor who caters for the classes, sets up
in a big house, with a carriage and flunkeys—
and waits wearily for patients, who may not
come, and, if they do come, may keep him
waiting for his money, or never pay at all. Lhe
doctor who caters for the masses, takes a lodge or
two, gets a great deal of experience, and earns a
definite, if not enormous, income ; he makes no
bad debts, and need not make an expensive
show. Between the two, the public is not as
well served as it might be. The day is not far
distant when the State will take on the healing
just as it has taken on education. A staff of
medical men will be employed at adequate
salaries to attend to all-comers. There will be
a better division of labor, and greater gain to
public health. The underworked doctor may
get the experience, but often enough it is too
much for his physique, while his neighbor is
rusting for want of something to do. When
they both become medical officers, matters will
be averaged, with advantage to ail. To some,
this idea may be novel. Once upon a time,
State education was looked upon as a deed of
the devil.— Patientia Docet.
Conscientiously Conscienceless.
N.S.W. Leg. Assembly, which in the matter of
Federation tyrannised over its constituents, is
itself tyrannised by its officials. Speaker
Abbott monopolises the limited accommodation,
and even stops ventilation of the Chamber be-
cause it makes a noise ; while the critics who
impute much of the bad manners of the
Assembly to his frequent absences from the
Chair are no doubt right. Everybody is sorry
for Speaker Abbott’s ill-health ; but he should
have resigned the Speakership as soon as it be-
came clear he was not well enough to thoroughly
fulfil his duties. And Speaker Abbott
grows impatient or worse. Ihe other night
John Haynes rose to speak, and sat down while
the Speaker intervened on a point of order.
Then he rose again ; and the Speaker ruled
that he had lost his right to speak—because he
had sat down in deference to the Speaker ! A
few days later Crick, M.L. A., had to com-
plain that seats were reserved in the ladies’
gallery—of this democratic Assembly, in this
democratic country —for “ the nicest people,
while ordinary plebeians who came first were
crowded into back seats to crane for sight and
hearing. The episode of Fegan, M.L.A., was
contemporaneous. He was chairman of a com-
mittee of the House to discuss Copeland's
measure permitting conditional Sunday-trading
in liquor; and wdien an emasculating amend-
ment was moved, the votes were equal. It
was the duty of Chairman Fegan, as an
official, to let the House decide the fate
of the measure later on ; but he voted
for the amendment—quashed discussion, and
quashed the Bill 1 “My conscience would not
let me act otherwise,” he said. But it was
Fegan’s duty, as chairman, to have a little re-
gard for the other fellows’ consciences. He
was not a member, voting as he listed ; he was
an official representative of the House, and his
private opinions were not in question at all.
It is the practice—and the reasonable and just
practice—for Speaker or Chairman, in an even
division, to give the House another opportunity
of consideration and decision. Fegan chose to
stifle debate. He may have been justified of
his conscience ; but he certainly was not justi-
fied by common-sense and common practice.
Until he learns his duty as the House’s tem-
porary head, he should be chairman no more.
The Boss Land-Grabber.
The notorious attempted Papuan Grab isn’t a
circumstance beside that achieved by R. G.
Reid, who practically ow'ns and runs New-
foundland. That island is one-sixtli larger than
Ireland, and Reid owns one-half of it in fee
simple. He is substantially feudal baron over
200,000 people. 7000 sq. miles of the country
are absolutely his very own, together with the
enormous mineral and timber wealth therein
contained, and every mile of its railway system
will eventually become his private property.
Reid, a penniless Scotch boy, originally started
life in Australia, emigrated to Canada, and made
money by building sections of the Can. Pac.
R.R. Then this genius in the art of exploiting
perceived the possibilities of the land-grant
system. In ’93 he built a railroad across New-
foundland for Govt, for £3OOO per mile. When
built, a poverty-stricken Govt, could neither
equip nor operate the line. Reid came to the
rescue and ran the concern, receiving, in addi-
tion to what he could make out of it, ,£ 12,000
a year as a mail-subsidy, and 5000 acres of land
for every mile worked by him for a period of
ten years. But with that he was not content.
He offered to operate the railroad without
anv subsidy after the expiration of 10 years,
provided that at the end of 40 additional years
the road should be his. In other words, the
Govt. Daid Reid his own price for building the
line, leased it to him free of all rent, gave him
an immense tract of land to run it, in addition
to the use of the line gratis, gave him a big
cash subsidy for 10 years, and is to give him
the line itself at the end of another 40 years,
free, gratis, and for nothing. Still this fear-
fully rapacious man was not satisfied. At the
time of making the 40-year offer he further
stipulated that the whole railway and tele-
graph monopolies of the island should be his,
and he should get more land-grants for taking
them over. An unspeakable Govt, agreed to
these terms, whereupon the long-suffering
people raised an outcry, and last year petitioned
Chamberlain, as Col. Sec., to cancel the con-
tract, on the ground that the island had been
sold for a song. Chamberlain replied to the
effect that, no^matter what personal opinion he
might hold respecting such a contract, he could
not interfere to prevent the management by a
self-governing province of its own finances.
At present, besides his railway business, the
insatiable Reid runs a fleet of steamers, ex-
ports 100,000 tons of iron-ore yearly, and is now
busy floating a N.F. Bleaching Pulp Co.,
capital, £400,000, and a N.F. Pyrites Co., capi-
tal £300,000. Beside these schemes the per-
formances of Hooley and co. appear child’s
play. Reid’s latest concession has been de-
clared by English experts to be worth a mil-
lion in hard cash, and the awful Whiteway
Govt, threw it away for nothing. Some day
Reid, oroneof his sons, may take it into his head
to re-visit Australia, in which case it would pay
the Federal Govt, to pass an Act prohibiting
his coming within three miles of the coast, on
the ground that he is a noxious disease and a
danger to the community. Half-a-dozen syn-
dicators of Reid’s sort would mop up this
fatigued country.
“ C.C.” on the great lodge-doctor question
Dear Bulletin. —About time the monotonous wail of
the lodge-doctor was countered with a few remarks from
the other side. Bulletin’s picture of “ Munificent Odd-
fellow ” idving doctor an extra 9d. for his 61 visits is a
fair shot enough, but, it isn’t, conclusive. The medico
who- howls in 8., 25/3/99, sets up the old bogey-Mimster
of the Crown with big pension who uses his lodge privi-
leges to the utmost. But take an average case-my
own As I make only just enough to live on, prolonged
illness would mean debt, and I therefore joined a lodge.
Having no ambition to prance around in gaudy mil-
linery with a bogus handle to my name, I should
have" preferred the “ System advocated by Bruck and
others,” but there was no other way. When the
loih’-e-doctor upon examination pronounced me a
gimd risk, he agreed to let me sweat him ; or, to put it,
the other way, he jumped at the chance of sweating me.
Probably said to himself—“ Here is a man who, barring
accidents, won’t need my services, and I shall geti lus
cash for nothing.” And he was right. I have paid him,
so far, about 2.1, and have only received from him one lot
of advice (a matter of five minutes) and a small bottle of
liniment. Yet there are hundreds like myself who don’t
whine about the unfair contract W'e have made. We don’t
want to be sick for the joy of getting our money’s worth
out of the doctor, and are only too glad to keep on pay-
ing him our dues with the comforting knowledge that a
broken limb won’t cost us a year’s income. In my case,
the lodge wouldn’t save me from paying the sweated
doctor ,65 for mileage before he looked at my r tongue.
Very irritating, no doubt, for the lodge medico to have a
few wealthy mean men on his list, or a crowd of hard
bargains who live on medicine, but the healthy sub-
scribers pay for the wasters. Besides, these unprofit-
able clients have to be examined before they are ac-
cepted, and if the doctor is too greedy, or doesn’t know
enough to refuse a bad bargain, that’s his private funeral.
And, in such a case as mine, it’s a fair wager. When I
insure my house against fire, the eo. lays me £2OO to 30s.
that it won’t burn, and I take the odds, hoping I’ll lose.
But, should I have the misfortune to “ win,” the co.
doesn’t hand over the stakes with an implication that I
am a mean man to take ’em. Your lodge-doet.or makes a
somewhat similar wager about my health, and I want to
know why his voice is so frequently like unto the croak
of Iket Mo parting up a double. [The doctor’s argu-
ment is that the premium isn’t enough—and, at L4s.
a year, he is probably right.]
The average S.A. politician is a careful soul.
Mostly he is naturally so ; bub if he isn’t, the
law does what it can to compel him to be while
he is campaigning. For he may nob spend
more than ,£5O if there are 2000 electors or less
in his district; and he may spend only £5 more
for every additional 200 —a not very fair
arrangement, by the way, where scattered
country populations are concerned. And, then,
he may not spend it upon whatever he pleases ;
he may buy electoral rolls, print addresses and
notices of meetings, buy stationery and stamps,
and pay for telegrams, hire halls, and engage
scrutineers and one election agent; but all
other ways are barred. Nor may a friend
pay for any service on his behalf; if any-
body wants to assist him the money must
be paid to him, and he must disburse it per-
sonally. and include it in the accounts which
have to be certified, filed and gazetted. Pre-
mier Kingston wants to go further even than
this : he wants to have part at least of a candi-
date’s expenses paid by the State. Local news-
papers naturally find it hard to accept these re-
forms philosophically ; it is a little galling to
the proprietor-editor to read in a2in. advt. that
“Messrs. Brown, Jones, Robinson, Thomp-
son, and Smith will address the electors as fol-
lows ” —a string of a dozen places being added.
So one advt., one hall, one conveyance will
serve the whole half-dozen candidates. This
of course applies particularly to the country
and suburbs ; but, then, nearly all S.A. is
country and suburbs. Even Ministers run
like this. Formerly the fairly Fat Man used to
“arrange” with the city newspapers for more
or less full reports of his speeches ; the price at
one time was £3 3s. per col. But even that is
now illegal unless the candidate’s name, or that
of his one agent, is at the foot of the matter.
Consequently S.A. newspaper readers have less
to skip than they used to have during the
season of what passes for political fighting in
that tired province.
Thus J. G. Drake, M.L. A., in Progress, on
the danger of the kanaka becoming a perma-
nent curse to Australian civilisation :
In a former number I showed bv statistics how, for the
last 10 vears, the total populat ion contained a continually
decreasing proportion of women. It must also be clear,
though statistics are not available to prove it, that year
bv year the totals include a larger proportion of kanakas
who have been over three years in the province. Some ot
them have probably now been in Queensland for six, tune,
twelve or more years. These are the survivors who have
become acclimatised, who make engagements, work for
the highest wages they can get, take occasional holidays
at Kanaka boarding-houses, and ape all the vices of the
white man. These are the men who lease land, marry
white women, and stand on their rights when the Govern-
ment in the interests of the people of Queensland pro-
fess to be anxious to stamp out disease. Inis
vast horde of 8589 kanakas does not now consist
to any extent of freshly - caught savages who can
be terrorised into submission and us d as something next
door to machinery. It is an army of semi-civilised bar-
barians who have settled down in Queensland and who are
continually tightening their hold, and who, when backed
up by capitalists, may become irremovable. It is mud
and filth entering into the stream of a nation s pure life
blood.
S.A. Assembly general election is fixed for this
Saturday (29th). It is remarkable in that it
witnesses Premier Kingston’s second successive
appearance before the country as Premier since
he took office in June, 1893. The Kingston
Government goes to the country with House-
hold Suffrage, alias Leg. Council reform, as its
main plank. Federation, which is certain to
be affirmed by a large majority, is in the back-
ground, and the chief interest centres around
the referendum on Household Suffrage. Last
year S.A. Assembly affirmed the principle by a
large majority, but the Council contemptuously
rejected it. Kingston now plainly states that
if a majority follows him, and the people
ask for it next Saturday, the Bill will
be re-introduced directly the new Par-
liament meets, and a second defeat in the
Council will be followed by a dissolution. The
disorganised S.A. Opposition, comprised of a
mixed crowd of ex-Premiers and other political
failures, has no settled policy on the question,
but merely howls that the Premier wishes to
destroy the Council. Kingston anticipates a
two-to-one majority for Household Suffrage,
and the prospect of the rolls for the Council
being nearly trebled is already causing dismay
in the ranks of the clique which has for so long
dominated the Upper House and wrecked
Democratic measures.
An ex-M.L. engine-driver to The Bulletin :
Re that M.L. railway-accident and the engineer’s state-
ment that the driver was travelling too fast. I can testify
that this dangerous practice on that province s railways
is encouraged by the bosses, and that) any driver who
didn’t make up* time would suffer for it. There is a
stringently-worded rule against excessive speed to make
up lost time, but any driver who honestly adheres to it
will get into disfavor, and the traffic bosses will worry
him all they can by putting him on to goods-trains or
shunting-engines, or shifting him about continually, ine
driver who will travel like the devil is favored, and if any
accident happens—providing it does not come under the
notice of a jury—always gets off scot-free. Ive known
a driver of this sort who had to give up his train through
ignorance of how to work a ticklish injector, and nothing
was said to him, whereas, had he been a man who obeyed
the speed-rule, he would have been put back firing.
Indeed, it is notorious that drivers who habitually in-
fringe this rule have the best chance of promotion. Even
N.S.W.’s late Mr. Eddy once dismissed a driver for want
of energy” because he refused to run very much faster
than the scheduled time betwixt two stations. Many ex-
drivers from both M.L. and N.S.W. railways are so be-
cause they wouldn’t conform to this dangerous practice.
Again, most of the “fast” drivers are boozers, whereas
even the smell of liquor on a driver should ensure his
dismissal. I could enumerate many accidents due to
half-intoxicated drivers neglecting signals and making
other mistakes.
“ Great surprise has been causer! in England by the
announcement that Mr. Tom Mann, the noted Labor
leader and president of working men’s unions, has pur-
chased a public-house in Long Acre, and is about to
abandon the cause of Labor, and, like Mr. Shipton ana
Mr. Hammill, two other working men’s advocates, become
a publican.”— (Cable).
“Shaker” re the new Q. mining law which
came into operation Ist Matcl) :
An all-night “stonewall” was productive of nothing
better than the exclusion of “ Chinese and other Asiatic
and African aliens” from those alluvial fields alreai.y
closed to them, thus practically leaving- them in posses-
sion of the whole of the alluvial ground in the province.
Even on a purely cash basis it would pay the State to
reserve the “abandoned” fields for its own people.
There is an ever-increasing number of fairly able-bodied
men who are quite out of the running for wages by
reason of their age or aged appearance, and who must
either support themselves by fossicking, or become a
charge on the State. At present they do (and, in the ab-
sence of the slant-eyed “gleaners,” would continue to)
make some sort of a living. That it is not a luxurious
one does not affect the question ; the men are satisfied
with it, plus the hope, which never leaves a digger, of
making a rise some day. But, then —what is to become
of the Chows? Well, Mr. J. A. Philp can have them to
grow cheap vegetables for Sydney.
“ The secretly-concocted Premiers’ Conference
Bill ” is, in their own opinion, the most deadly
label the “ Anti’s ” have so far devised for the
Federal Bill campaign. “ Secretly-concocted ”
is a large-bore double-barrelled charge, but the
devisers only think of this after they have come
—a long time after —to dislike the Conference
work. The right to meet which the Premiers
possessed went with a right to sit how they
liked. If the Anti’s resisted this they should
have done so at the time with the vigor they
now display against the Bill. Instead they
waited to extract a Bill to their liking, or no
Bill from the Conference sitting in secret, and,
failing to get what they wanted—a No-Bill foi
preference—they now endeavor to nail on the
Bill as proof of utter evil a label embodying a
condition to which they assented.

N.S. Wales Education Minister Bwue in-
formed an audience last week that if there
existed in any part of the world a more liberal
system of education than that of N.S. W. lie
should be glad to hear of it.” Is it not known
that a large number of N.S.W. children of
school age never go to school? Owing to
faulty wording of the Act they cannot be legally
reached. Again, what about the 3d. a week
(a reduction on quantities) which each N.S.W.
State school scholar must carry to the school-
plate or seek remission as a pauper ? No
country which includes a clause of that charac-
ter in its elementary education Act can afford
to talk like Mr. Hogue. To be justly Compul-
sory, education must be Free. To go no
farther, Vic. and Queensland are more liberal
than N.S. W.
The favorite Melb. plan of getting rid of a
contraband infant now seems to be the per-
sistent giving to it of unsuitable food (which is,
of course, cold-blooded poisoning), and on this
ground one “ nurse ” out of many similar prac-
titioners has just been mercifully convicted of
manslaughter. In this case the pi emium paid
the nurse was JB2O, while in another instance
the consideration for “adoption” was no less
than £9O, the putative father in this case re-
maining unknown. The “ respectable ” dailies
might in such cases very well omit the girls’
names, as also in affiliation cases. It is utterly
unfair that the mother should take all the
“ shame,” while the father shelters himself be-
hind the’girl’s loyalty. But the real culprit in
the matter is neither father nor mother, but
that hypocritical section of society which looks
upon the advent of an unauthorised youngster
as almost a worse crime than murder. The
dailies habitually pat themselves on the back
and congratulate each other at every officially-
reported increase of population ; yet here at
our door is a natural increase, and we carefully
give it pills or the battery, or smother it, or
leave it on a doorstep, to the moral and physical
harm of the mother and the bitter disgrace of
a community that sniffs in horror at the men-
tion of a foundling hospital. The establish-
ment of such hospitals, under Govt, inspection,
would largely diminish the at present rampant
practice of abortion, and abolish that large and
increasing class of “nurses” who are practi-
cally neither more nor less than wholesale baby-
murderers.

S.A. Register leads the howl against House-
hold Suffrage, which Premier Kingston hopes
will provide a specific for Leg. Council obstruc-
tion. The Tory mouthpiece was once Radical
and, therefore, in its gouty age, Democrats take
a delight in unearthing the ideas it expressed
before its blood became thin and its hair turned
grey. One charming reproduction is the fol-
lowing from the Register of 25/7/’57, when
Forster, a sturdy Democrat, edited the paper :
We want no “Upper” and Lower Houses. If two Cham-
bers are to be perpetuated, let them represent distinct
political ideas, but let them be elected on the same suf-
frage. . . • Our own opinion often expressed is that
legislation by two Houses is not the system best adapted
for this colony. . . . We go for such a modification of the
Council as shall make it in every respect as much the
creature of the popular will as the Assembly is. . . . So
long as the Council exists as a distinct branch of our
Parliamentary system, we contend that its basis should
be the following
Franchise of electors.—The same as in the Assembly.
Fixed term of duration.—The same as in the Assembly.
Qualification of members.—The same as in the Assembly-.
This is even more sweeping than the reform
which Kingston so earnestly fights for to-day,
and which the Register of 1899, owned body
and soul by Fatnian, so persistently opposes.
Loot and Plunder.
(Or the gospel of Brotherly Love according to
Sydney D.T.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wise has made another blunder
Which our Daily bosom grieves—
Says we spoke of “ loot ” and “ plunder,
Says we hinted neighbors “thieves.
We indignantly deny it—
We, the Editorial We—
And we’ll stand or tumble by it,
Will the truthful Daily T.
No, we never, never said it—
Not a word to their diseredit;
You can search old musty Telegraphs m sheaves.
We said (and can you wonder ?)
They were bent on “ loot and plunder :
But we never, never hinted they were thieves.
We challenge demonstration
That by word or imputation
We ever once suggested they were thieves.
’Tis silly, we assever,
To speak our neighbors ill;
We have never done it —never —
And. we never, never, will.
Australians all are brothers,
And we wish them to unite ;
We wouldn’t dream (like others)
Of egging them to fight.
No, we love our neighbors dearly,
And if truth compels us merely
To state the few misgivings we may feel,
We say (we’re frank as Brutus)
They would plunder us and loot us—
But we never dream of hinting they would steal.
We challenge contradiction
When we state, with full conviction,
That we never thought it possible they’d steal.
To lots of other matters
Our method will extend.
We have torn the Bill to tatters,
Till it takes some time to mend.
We have raised a thousand “ bogeys ”
Which invariably are slain
(Then our cutest dodge in vogue is
Just to raise them up again).
Yet, after Referendum,
We can add a slight addendum
To explain the real opinions that we had ;
We have call’d it monstrous —rotten —
Misconceived and misbegotten—
But we’ve never even hinted that it’s bad.
We with emphasis assert it,
And you cannot controvert it—
We have never, never said the Bill was bad.
GAMMA.
MORTAL MANN.
There was a Mann who had a mind
To live a brave, unselfish life,
To help the lame and lead the blind,
And teach his feebler fellow kind
The wisdom of concerted strife ;
There was a Mann who ruled the mass
By moral strength—aye, there’s the rub !
That Mann, alas ! has changed his class,
And chuckt his job—to keep a pub.
There was a Mann whose outstretched hand
Could quiet angry dockers’ din ;
Their cause at “Good old Tom’s ” command
Spoke for itself throughout the land.
Now “Good old Tom ” (0, London gin !)
Who bade them walk in sober ways
Beside their wives who wash and scrub
Has cast aside his wreath of bays
To serve the masses—in a pub.

V Lord and Lady Algy,” by R. C. Carton,
arrived at the Royal last Saturday, and were soon
found to be “an uncommon entertainin’couple, ”
as they would say themselves. The whole com-
pany acts as if the society atmosphere of the play
was its native air, and the wit and simple fun of
the piece are things of beauty and a joy for ever.
Brough fits into the part of Lord Algy without a
crease. There are moments when it is impossible
to say whether Algy was made for Brough, or
Brough for Algy. His jiart inspires him. He
plays neatly, crisply, and when he goes “disguised
m drink ” to a fancy-dress ball he rises to the top-
most heights of the deliciously maudlin. Also,
Mrs. Brough has just the part that suits her. She
is rather a Sans-Geney-Dandy-Dicky Lady Algy.
But, then, each r6le Mrs. Brough has ceased to*fili
echoes somewhere or other through the part she is
just Not being an actress who goes in for
the realistic, she soon exhausts her little tricks
and has to repeat them, confidently. As Lady
Algy she plays a smoking, betting woman of the
world, with an unworldly heart, in a bright,
modern way that puts everybody in a good temper.
A peculiarity of this play is that every character
has a claim on your sympathy. The dramatis
persona are remarkably well-balanced people, as
good as they are bad, or as bad as they are good,
u evident the author liked them all, and
the house unconsciously follows. The Marquis of
Quarmby, who is going to run away with another
man’s wife, never pretends to be a villain. Lovell
in the part shows that he can act with freedom
but still seems a little hazy about the sort of man
he means to be ! Mr. Mclntyre’s Mawley is a
gem of a lean little jockey, with a face like a back
door, and a weakness for whisky. Miss Grace
JN oble makes her re-appearance in a shadowy part
and leaves no particular impression. Mr. Leslie
Victor’s valet is a snappy bit of flunkeyism. Mr.
Rotheram, as the jealous nuisance with a heavy
hand on the china, makes the return of his wife an
impossible incident. The ‘ ‘ better half ” who once
ran away from those aggressive whiskers could
never return. Altogether, the company shows
itself off to more advantage than in its opening
play, and if this city doesn’t put all its money,
and a bit more, on the Algies, it deserve® “ twelve-
months hard ” at the Lyceum.
** * *
“ lolanthe ” has to run for a single week
at Her Majesty’s. Before the present issue of
I he Bulletin gets to the confines of its territorial
circulation the large and imperial Julius Knight
will be taking embroidered farewells of Australia
m “ Pygmalion and Galatea ” a Gilbertian
comedy on the heels of Gilbertian comic opera.
Speaking of the latter : “lolanthe” was grandly
patronised. But it was a somewhat disappointing
performance. Curiously, the chorus was leagues
ahead of the principals. The Lord Chancellor of
Howard Vernon was, of course, a performance of
“heaven-kissing merit to quote Rignold or
Shakespeare. Miss Florence Perry was the
Phyllis of the piece. Very dainty, she looked
like a Dresden-china image that had fallen off
some old-world shelf in one of memory’s curiosity-
shops—but we have listened to more likeable
Phyllises. William Pauli was the Strephon of
the cast ;with a red, brick-dust face reminiscent
°j n? tain Mayne Reid and Fenimore Cooper
and Choctaws and Sioux. He was easily over-
topped by Mr. P. Bathurst (Earl of Mount-
ararat), and Mr. Chas. Kenningham (Earl Tol-
loller), whose singing and comedy-acting were artis-
tic in the very highest sense. Miss Dorothy Vane
was the lolanthe. There are no ferocious de-
mands, and she did very well. Mr. Stannis Leslie
was a capital Private Willis—but he’s too lean.
When one has become accustomed to his large and
portly Benham he takes not kindly to a thinner
man. Mesdames Nina Osborne, Beatrice Perry
and Minnie Everett were fairies for the nonce'
Celia, Lelia, and Fieta of Mddsuromor’s demesne.
Th f 9l ue . en P, 1 P oint > anyhow, of acting-presence
and distinguished savoir faire —was held revallv
aloft by Mrs. Henry Bracy.

At Sydney Lyceum the Holloway Co. has
elaborately staged “Man’s Enemy, ’’which turns out
to be mostly the same old Der-rink in a new disguise.
The Bulletin’s theory is that the original serpent
who crawled into Eden was named Der-rink
in Hebrew, or Chaldaic, or a mixture of the
two, and that he didn’t crawl, he slid down
Adam s throat with a loving gug-guggle and
inspired the First Man to challenge the landlord
to come out and fight. In “Man’s Enemy ” the
Holloway Co. has an unparalleled opportunity, or
something like that, to point out the beauties of
Der-rink, but theco. is far too much concerned about
its acting to supply the noble moral lesson which
the piece provides. It isn’t a dress-circle piece,
but it fills the gallery, and mingles laughs and
shudders with an admirable disregard of anything
in the way of the higher criticism. There is a
ballet of statues, also a wedding of tableaux.
Robert Inman and Stanford are concerned in the
play as hero and villain respectively; and they
thrive. Amy Gourlay and Ida Gresham supply
feminine graces agreeably : and there are so many
exclt i n ß incidents” that the audience feels at
the end as if it had never known how to be thirsty
before.

“Othello” is still booming at the Criterion.
George has been showing the salt of the earth
how to strangle its wife. Last Thursday was a
“Command Night,” and the Chief Justice and
Lieut.-Governor and Captain-General of N.S.W.
went to study crime out of Court. On Friday the
other George and some Ministers (which sounds
like a title invented by John Oliver Hobbes)
dropped in to pick up a point or two from lago.
Reid, however, left chuckling, with a large, fat
aspect of out-Machiavellianing the Moor’s scurvy
Ancient. Meanwhile, people write letters to the
“ ail y Papers about editing Shakespeare (and
Walter Bentley thought he had a word to sav
thereto), the mode of Othello’s murdering Desde-
mona, and the archaeological correctness of turban,
ear-rings, and Oriental gowns.
** * *
The only Shakespearian play now being
performed in Australasia (or, indeed, anywhere
south of the line) is “Othello” at Sydney Cri-

There is one house in Sydney which is
always jammed full : to wit, the Tivoli. This
word spells El Dorado eight times a week, count-

the prime draw at present time of writing, but
the Keziah sisters run him close with their ladder
gymnastics, and similar frivolities. There are
however, a whole crowd of clever people in the
Rickards combination. Not the least are drawing-
room sketchists Ethel Conley and G. W. Carew
Besides whom, and moreover, are there not Wal-
lace King, and Howard Chambers, and little
hanny Powers, and the Sisters Phillips, and the

will be easily filled by Julius Knight, Miss

they are about to farewell some more is a certifi-
cate of merit. This time they will be limited to

Dante promises to take root and flourish
steadily at St. George’s Hall, for the bloated aris-
tocracy m the front seats look with admiration on
anyone who can convert 10 half-crowns into 15
whilst the less-banquetted population of the ton
gallery are considering Dante’s magic supper in its
wondrous economical aspects. As far as the pre-
sent scribe can see, there is no reason why the beau-
teous bald-faced wizard shouldn’t go forth among
the Unemployed and produce endless bread and
fr o ™ th ose five hollow organ-pipes.
On the other hand, the scribe has grave doubts re
P a f n , te ® /Pnng chicken, which was probably
hatched from a disappearing egg laid by one of
the canaries that come from nowhere when the
pistol goes off. It looks very like a bird of ill-
ornen, anyhow. Mdlle. Edmunda’s skill is received
with loud applause, likewise the serpentine-dance
effects supplied by that adorable lady and the
limelight-man. Also the boot-trunk mystery, and
the manifestations of the sealed-up spirit, are help-
ing to push Dante s show along. p

Grattan Riggs as Conn the Shaughraun, is
the new bill at Melb. Alexandra. Riggs seemed
not quite so young as usual on Saturday night
but he took hold of the audience with his- brogue
and held them all the time. Moreover, the stagfng
of Boucicault s clever old drama is an improve-
ment on the ordinary Haleck style of doing things
and the company has acquired some new blood’
and the possibility of the management getting en-
couragement to proceed is less remote than it was
a week ago. “The Shaughraun” ought to St
over another Saturday in any case. The Alexan-
dra public includes a number of young and un-
sophi stica,ted creatures who never go elsewhere to
be thrilled, and have not yet seen a first-class play
reasonably treated. J

Bellman and Moore, Wheatley, Geo. Dean, and

Friedenthal, if not exactly “one of the
greatest of living pianists,” is one of the most
acceptable entertainers that musical Melbourne
has heard for years. Friedenthal takes the stage
tor about two hours, less ten minutes’interval, and
makes his piano interesting all the time, for he
plays nothing that is very heavy, and much that
is light and bright, or quaint. As an incentive to
amateur proficiency, this unaggressive German
artist will deserve all the popularity he earns.
1 here are jiianists—too many of them—who bid for
the priggish praise of pedantic critics by playing
sonatas of the kind which no ordinary performer
has the least desire to attempt, pieces which repre-
sent merely the composer’s ability to deliver a
long, dry sonorously-phrased sermon on a dull
theme. And there are piano-smiters travelling on
their power to execute ordinarily difficult pieces
m an extraordinarily difficult style, artists of the
acrobatic, magnetic order, who leave only a
brief sensation behind them. Friedenthal
deals, as a rule, with music that all prac-
tised pianists can play pleasantly, and he
shows them _ how much better they can
do it if they will only imitate him up to the point
where the amateur stops and the professional
begins. A Friedenthal tends to create reasonable
ambition m the average young female pianist.
When one remembers how much misery is wrought
by the misdoings of the girl next door, the im-
portance of this long-haired exemplar seems truly
great. Life in many cases is endurable, or other-
wise, according to the music of the girl next door
Herr ZAPF (Fitzgerald Bros.' trainer) at
practice with PRINCE, the lion, and LIZZIE,
the elephant, on the “Tricycle."
Miss Amy Castles, the Bendigo warbler,
presented to Melb. audiences in loose hair and a
rather short frock, was born at Capel-street, Melb.,
m Ju!y, 1880, says the register. This comes
rather rough on the enthusiastic scribesses (in-
cluding a Bulletin scribess) who put Miss Amy’s
age down as 17, and gave her credit for looking
two years younger, which she certainly doesn’t,
it is even rougher on the Age musical critic who
told the public to think of the little woman as a
growing girl,” with a great operatic career before
her. Amy Castles, according to the Age man,
may be expected to develope into another Tiet-
jens. The present writer, having a lively recollec-
tion ot that famous 14st. (or more) prima-donna
pouring volumes of music from her mighty chest,
would like to know whether the Age critic ever
saw and heard Tietjens, and, if so, whether he
would like to withdraw the comparison, now that
he knows little Miss Amy to be “rising 19”?
Both she and her voice are full-grown. The
size of her voice has been over-stated to the
same extent that her age has been understated,
but any further argument against the Castles boom
were a mere waste of time. At her second concert
the girl s voice was very hoarse through overwork;
the consciousness of failure made her nervous, and
she got out of tune, but the crowded audience, for
the most part, accepted Amy’s performance as
wonderful—“wonderful for a child” anyhow—and
next morning’s newspapers credited her with
another legitimate triumph, etc. Hoarser and
hoarser still she sang at other places within the
next few days, and the public took her voice at
newspaper valuation every time. Then a wise
patron rushed upon the scene and wrung from the
damsel a solemn promise not to sing any more, in
public or private, until some farewell benefit
concerts fall due. Her “wonderful” voice was
putting a terrible strain on public credulity when
benefit-promoter came along and persuaded
Miss Amy to preserve a diplomatic silence.

Writes “ Aletes ” to The Bulletin :
The Sydney Criterion “ Othello ” illustrates clearly the
power of an actor to make or mar the effect of another
Than lago and Othello there are not, probably, in dra-
matic literature, two parts so closely interwoven and of
so equal an importance. The occasion requires twin
stars In this case, because lago fails to rise to the
dignity of bis part, Othello’s runs the risk of seeming dis-
proportioned overdone. The latter should form a natural
sequence to the former, but here the effect seems rather
too great for the cause. In reading the play, the ade-
quacy of the circumstances comes home to one. How
vividly before us flames the character of lago—that
unique creation, with the shrewd, subtle brain, the
fiendish heart. A lover of villainy for its own sake.

that lead to such hideous achievement). In company are

"A leading countess’s extraordinary recovery from
madness, after 17 years,” writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, “comes as a thunderclap on those who
never realised such a possibility. A leading- Gaiefv
dancer, who has been seen by Australia, for several veats
has found in the practically-wifeless earl a wealth of
an d attention, and it is thought, on many sides

a Hindu would take to European dress if appointed to a

tainiy wouldn’t go a-wooing a society demoiselle in a

Westralian stocks still boom, the rise of the
last few weeks representing millions of money, in som
instances the advances made during the last 14 m o
are absolutely phenomenal. This day twelve mont
Associateds were £3 Bs., to-day they are quoted at ±.7 ids.,
the difference in price being over two millions. Great
Boulders were then under 18s. —now they are just unde
30s. Ivanhoes, then under £5, are now over £ll. Lane
View Consols were just over £9 ; they are now just uwer
£lB, and £9 a share means just two and a quarter millions
sterling. Perseverance, a year ago, were just halt tneir
present price. Kalgurlies have almost doubled ; so, too.
South Kalgurlies, as well as the stocks of several
smaller mines in same belt of country. Little 'nines,
long thought dead and forgotten, have come out ot tneir
graves like rats out of their holes and are being honored
with market quotations. Shares that could riot be given
away a fortnight ago are negotiable for cash. The chances
are that a few weeks hence people will not be able to give
them away again, and holders will be sorry they bought
them at any price. The stock-boom is unaccountable.
Up to to-day writer has not seen any logical reason given
for it, anyhow. Developments have been good, particularly
in the Great Boulder, where the two bottom levels are
opening up remarkably well, but nothing in this direction
has occurred to warrant the boom, and outside the
Boulder nothing remarkable has happened in any ot the
mines. Sulphide plants in the Lake View and in one or
two other mines are said to be running, but their success
cannot be greater than that anticipated.
Mining generally lias been cheapened during
the last 12 months, but the limits of economy are now
surely being approached. Divs. by the chief producers
are great, but they only about represent bank-interest on
market-values ; and, between bank-interest and what
should be mining-interest, there is a mighty big differ-
ence, as the public who are buying at present prices will
find out ere long. The boom is unwarranted, however you
look at it. Probably it is not over yet—there may still be
“ pounds a share ” in ’em, but, as sure as the sun rises, a
slump will follow. Then, stand from under ! It is well-
known that the public have a mania for buying.m a rising
market and for selling in a falling one, and it is when
they stand not on the order of going out that the
rush will take place. Nobody in Australia quite
knows when that will happen, but that the time rests,
as it were, in the hollow of certain people’s hands there
is not much reason to doubt. Some six months ago, in
the face of developments on which the present boom has
been built, and in defiance of magnificent results in the
cyanidation of tailings and the filter-press treatment of
slimes, the London operators who had determined to jump
on W.A. stocks got them down in several notable
instances, particularly Associated, to about half present
prices. The miserable Fashoda incident was given in
London and accepted in Australia as a sufficient reason
for the slump, in which Ifalgoorlie brokers and mining-
managers, wiio, by reason of their location and oppor-
tunities, could best judge the value of the mines, "'ere
caught. Having, no doubt, got in at the bottom, the
same operators maybe depended upon to be dealing them
out to the public at the top. They engineered the slump ;
then the boom, and it rests entirely with them to bring
about another downfall the moment it suits them.
Peakhill, Westralia. 250,000 £1 shares, of which
all but 20,090 are issued, and they are now selling in
London at £9 a share. A market-value of over two mil-
lions —for what? It paid last year 2s. Bd. a share in divs.,
which represents something under 2 per cent, on its
market-value. Last year it was running 10 heads ; this
year it has started a new 20-head mill, but it is extremely
doubtful if it can keep both running. Formation, a sort
Of bedded plane of conglomerate kaolin cement, with
occasional small veins or splashes of quartz—usually
short-lived as they are rich. The co. has to fight the
question as to whether it is alluvial or not. It will pro"
bably win, but winning will cost heaps of money, the
big fight, instead of terrifying holders, seems to have had
an opposite effect. No true lode has been found, lhe
yarn that the cement must be over-lying formations is
rich, as the Kalgoorlie belt has been proved moonshine—
the cement has not been found to extend to any great
width, length, or depth ; is, in fact, confined to a narrow
channel, and the best part of it is dipping into blocks for
the working of which the co. has not got full control.
Yet the mine has a market-value almost equal to the
biggest of the Boulder group, while its production is not
one-fifth as big ; its divs. are insignificant by com-
parison, while its life might reasonably be put down
!is ten times as short. This altogether is the
most extraordinary thing happening in Westralia,
and must either be the result of a well-manipulated
pool in the shares, or remarkable credulity on the part of
the people buying. It could never have occurred had the
mine been in Kalgoorlie or within reasonable distance of
it. Isolated over 200 miles to the N.E. of Oue, with
nothing in the surrounding district to attract speculators,
with no hope of floating mines in the present condition of
the London market, it has been allowed to work out its
own salvation in its own way. What will happen when
the pool is over, if there is a pool, or when the public in
London realise what they are really getting for £9 a share
it is not difficult to contemplate, despite the assurances
of Moses Moss, of London Truth, and other professional
mining’ tipsters, that Peakhills will see £l2 and £l5.
Great Boulder, W.A. Proposed to issue 150,000
reserved shares, giving nine and a fraction for every 100
shares now held. Price to be asked not yet known;
private cables say that they are to be issued at a low
figure. Reason for issue not given. Surely the great
G B 00. does not want any more money. Holders, how-
ever are always ready to take more shares when they can
be had for nothing or cheaply. Probably a sop to stave
off the storm arising over the ignominious failure of the
directors’ milling contract with Konemaiin. And how
quickly that seems to have died out! For months we
had columns of Konemann-process for which the directors
were wickedly responsible. Now failure is proved,
£2O 000 of the co.’s money wasted, and a year s time lost,
shareholders seem to have forgotten all about it.

“Rottnest”: While sympathising thoroughly
with the very general Westralian demand (8., 25/3/99) to
tax the absentee shareholder who owns the best of the
mines, I cannot see how an export tax on gold will effect
this result, except on the Herodian principle of killing
every baby so that the one wanted cannot escape. Ihe
export tax on gold would penalise every Westralian trans-
action with the outer world which involved the purchase
of a draft in W.A. The banks would raise their rate of
exchange for everybody, including the absentee. It w a
mistake to suppose that the W.A. gold-export is "'holly
on account of absentees. Vie., N.S.W., Q., Tas. and M.L.
export gold, simply because it would be absurd to keep
sovereigns in hand beyond the needs of local currency.
The system is automatic. The traders of a city work up
to a certain average—they draw out of the banks
enough for cash transactions, and they leave in
the bank all the surplus. The banker has his idea of
what margin he must allow beyond this average of re-
quirements. All beyond that margin would represent
dead capital—and to ship it to London, or to America, or
to the East, is a reasonable and ordinary business trans-
action, without any poisonous effect on the trade of the
citv concerned. In fact, Australia sells gold to the world
To the miner, an export-duty would mean that he would
get less cash for his gold, or, perhaps, that he would
nominally get the same; but the purchasing power of
nominally get/ re duced. Now, what is wanted is to
taxtoedividends of the absentee shareholder—not to tax

Goodman, of W.A. District Trading Corpora-
tion, London, has gone to gaol for 13 months. One of his
associates got six months and two others got off alto-
gether. No wonder moderately honest men turn boom-
sters when such an amount of villainy, as publicly Prac-
tised for two years in this instance, is rewarded by 18
months gaol for the chief. A few of the tricks played by
Goodman and co. have been enumerated heretofore
Amongst those not generally known was the sending out
of hospital nurses who found themselves landed in the
Westralian bush without money or hospital, and were not
long ere they realised there was no hope of getting either,
It was part of Goodman’s scheme, and when writer com-
pares his 18 months’ quod with the sufferings he inflicted
on some of his victims and the money he robbed from
others, he feels inclined to say something—well, unparlia-
mentary. »
The recklessness (vide cable) of the “ West Aus-
tralian (Gold District) Trading Syndicate Lira.,’ swindle
was remarkable, even for these times. The felony lay in
the payment of a bogus div. of 100 per cent, on syndicate
shares, for the purpose of enlarging the syndicate into a
“corporation,” and enabling the robbers to wade off their
inflated shares. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to them
that, in a multitude of shareholders, there was a certainty
of a great uproar when the fraud of the 100 per cent. div.
came to be discovered. Bull will stand any amount of
bleeding, as long as he isn’t punctured in too many places
at once? He mustn’t be made to bellow with the pain of
several hundreds of wounds, for, when he bellows, some-
body goes to gaol. In the matter of achieving occasional
consolation for his losses, the speculative Bull has an
advantage over the Kangaroo, who makes no row to speak
of.

Claude Vautin, the well-known Australian
metallurgical chemist, has got six months in London for
certain scrip fakings—a game he probably knew little
about. He was a smart man at his own business, anyhow,
but, as a rule, the best of metallurgical chemists are
babes in any other line. If he wanted to make money
and escape gaol he should have forged mines wholesa e,
floated “cats,”and started the printing-press making scrip
in a perfectly legal way—quite a common business, but
little understood by metallurgists.

G. Darlington Simpson, a Charlton (Eng.) man,
who has blossomed into a mining plutocrat, owes his
success to the famous patch at Peak Hill, 200 miles north
of Cue the desolate. His first ventures on the Murchison
were failures, and the Bull co’s with which he was asso-
ciated dropped their coin. On two of their mines J)-
head batteries were erected, but very little has been
crushed at either. He got wind of Peak Hill, and in-
duced the holders of leases to give him the option tor
three months without a deposit. With a collection of
rich specimens from the place he headed straight
for London, and worked things so well that the
cash deposit was cabled out almost at the last moment.
The price was £llO,OOO, and the co. was floated with a
great flourish for £250,000. The Inspector of Mines,
Frank Reid, gave a glowing report, and he has since
resigned to manage the show at £2OOO a-year. By judi-
cious pooling, or some other process, the shares have
forced up to £B, so that the capitalised value of the Peak
Hill Co. is two millions !

Westralia’s timber-export business grows. In
1897 it was worth £192,451 ; in ’9B, £326,195. And yet
timber-scarcity is troubling managers, who
begin to talk of the need of light lines thrown out
towards the nearest wooded areas.

The annual report of the once-mighty Burra
(S A ) mines shows no trace of the copper-boom. The
receipts were just £656 18s. 3d., of which £4B 19s. 2d.
was the proceeds of ore sold. Expenses, £772. But, m a
dreamv sort of way, the directors hope to do a little more
in the way of exploration by and by. The co. owns the
mine—holds the freehold of it: that is the misfortune.
The Central (Sulphide Corporation) having sold
its “ tailings ” dump to European zinc-extraction people,
the South Co.’s big heap is now being nibbled at. some-
thing like £50,000 has been offered and refused. Apart
from this, South’s prospects continue first-rate ; a bonus
will probably be available with dividend.
B.H. British pays two sixpenny divs. early in
May—a total of £15,000. This is a notable recovery; the
previous half-year showed a loss—chiefly through the
vagaries of the concentrating-mill. Better mill-work,
better sulphides in the faces, and an increased extraction
of carbonates are responsible for the right-about turn.
The British has had awful bad luck (‘ bad luck m
minin" mostly means “bad management”) ; but if this
ceases" there should be a long procession of small divs.
No Broken Hill mine has more country to explore, and
few have lately had better results from what they have
explored. To this has to be added that the British has,
so far as can be judged, more carbonate ore left than any
other mine except the B.H. Prop. ; and carbonate is in
very strong demand for fluxing sulphides with.
Euriowie, on whose tin-shows <T. S. Reid, Rasp,
and others lost a good slice of the money they had made
out of Broken Hill, is to get another trial. But Melb.
and Adelaide aren’t taking any, and the best, or a good
many of the best, of the shows have been taken to Lon-
don If J. Bull won’t part freely enough Pans will be
tried- reports from there are even more encouraging
than from across the Channel. German tin-saving appli-
ances are said to have been much improved lately (that,
in fact, is one of the chief arguments used for the revival
of Cornish tin-mining’), so that the former dismal failure
of Euriowie enterprises may now be reversed. Anyhow,
the former trials were not satisfactory ; for the three or
four-score tin-pot co.’s hadn’t half-finished experimenting
when their capital was exhausted and the bottom fell out
of the little boom. If they had pooled their capital there
would have been just about enough to prove the field one
way or the other. , , ,
What is the English co. which has its hand on

proceeding for four or five years ; great prospects have
several times been recorded —and yet there is no news of
gold Some Territoreans wink when the co. is men-
tioned. What is the game, if there is one ?

Cobar still suffers from drought. Unless rain
falls within a few days the great Copper Mine will have
to apply once more to Cobar Gold Mines for some of the

Albury, N.S.W., having plenty of water round
it, is not going to be left out of the dredging-boom. It

will not pay with ordinary gold-savers, but, with a dredge
—well, that is quite another matter. Sydney mining-
investors, it is declared, propose to erect a dredging-plant
that will cost £60,000. This is really tew mutch. The
figures are rather high, but, associated with Sydney
mining-investors, they constitute a huge joke, of which a
Sydney daily has been made the victim.

From a N.S.W. blue-book of 1882 : As ex-
amples of the richness of gold-veins the following may be
cited. At Beyers and Holtermann’s mine, Hill End, 102
cwt. gold was raised in 10 tons of stuff. From the same
mine a slab of vein stuff and gold weighing 6301 b., which
was estimated to contain £2OOO worth of gold, was exhi-
bited with other similarly rich blocks. The Mint returns
for the gold from 415 tons of vein stuff from this mine
was 16,279’630z., valued at £63,234 125., in 1873. Kroh-
man’s Co., also at Hill End, raised 436 tons 9 cwt. of ore
for 24,0790 z, Bdwt. gold, value £93,616 11s. 9d.

A N.S.W. mining-expert visited a Northern
field recently, and talked so large that he was forthwith
engaged at a high fee by a local co. to inspect and report
on their mine, where they had the refractory-ore disease
acutely. His report wound up by informing the directors
that “ they had not got the right compliances for saving
gold.” On another field, principally worked by old fos-
sickers, same genius nearly caused a civil war by asserting
that it was useless sinking any further on a certain line
of reef, as they were down to ophidian, and gold was
never found with ophidian.

stated, there is enough tin to keep from three to tour
thousand men in sugrar and other necessary things for tne

torians have invaded some part of N.S.W. near the border,
and are engaged in taking up a large area of alleged tin-

« F.J.E.”: Be “ R.’s ” letter (8/4/’99). Easy to
criticise the management of a big concern if yon arenit
called upon to propound a better scheme. Good oia
Kayser ” managed Bischoff mine for upwards of 20 years,
took out over three millions sterling worth of stuff, paid
about £1,600,000 in divs., and “made” more gentlemen
than any other manager in Tasmania. Despite the heavy
rainfall at Waratah, some of the co.’s plant has to remain
inactive at times owing to scarcity of water, and were it
not for the manner in which the machinery is built up a
good deal of the essential fluid would run to waste. iffe
great strength of old man Kayser’s management lies not
merely in the fact that he gets out the ore, but that he
dresses it with economy and keeps divs. up right through
the year. “ R.” opines that “ any good tin-sluicer could
have managed Bischoff with less show than Kayser, which
is rather rough on those who managed the mine before
Kayser and didn’t make it pay. Anyone interested has
onlv to look at the half-yearly reports, wherein full par-
ticulars as to cost of mining and dressing a ton or
stanniferous material are given. Considering the exor-
bitant freights obtaining on Waratah-Burme line, os. 7*d.
per ton isn’t showing a big margin for experimental pur-
poses. That the big mine has seen its best days is pro-
bably correct, yet with economical management the aivs.
may'outlive “ R.” although, to judge from his screed, he
isn’t an old ’un. Kayser hasn’t practically resigned ;he
sent in his resignation last year, but the directors, not
being acquainted with “ R.,” persuaded him to stay on,
being well aware that a new broom mightn’t sweep half as
many divs. together. Kayser recently reported on some
E. Coast properties—perhaps this fact has raised K. s
bile? ,
“Potai”: Be query as to payable lodes being

which £25,000 divs. was paid. Again, the Montana b.M.
Co. while laying a tram-line from main shaft to a small
show near by, exposed a rich lode in a small cutting which
enabled the mine to pay divs., 3d. ones, but still divs.
Also, Oonah S.M. Co. in laying tram for firewood, cut
payable body of ore distinguished as the Western Show or

Ed. Bulletin.—Re your note (25/2/’99) concern-
ing the big find of opal near Winton (Q.), your informant
is all abroad in saying that H. Newman’s representative
bought the pick of it, or that the remainder was commer-
cially worthless. I have some of the stone m Sydney
with me, and have shown it to several experts who have
been quite willing to buy. The remainder is now on the
field for sale. Looks as if some interested parties were
trying to crush the field by representing that it is most
difficult to reach and destitute of accommodation, whereas
Cobb and Co. run a weekly service thither, so that a
buyer can stay on the field three to ten days, and the
hotel is a fair one for an outside place. Besides the big
find there are some smaller parcels of first-rate quality on
the field.— Opal Miner.

The British Govt, has often, as a matter of
policy, differentiated its wine-duties in the way Australia
now urges in respect to its own little vintage. In 1703, a
50 per "cent, higher duty was placed on French than on
Portuguese wines, with the result that French wines, in a
few years, almost fell out of use in England, and Portuguese
took their place, Wines from the Cape and other British
possessions were also favorably differentiated. In 182
the duty on French wines was 13s. 9d. per gal., other
Continental wines 9s. Id,, and Cape wines 3s. fd. in
1860 all were equalised. Differential duties on stimu-
lants and narcotics have always been a matter of policy as
much as of revenue with Great Britain.

“D.”: Govt. Geologist Stirling and Govt.
Metallurgist Jenkins (recently imported) with the irre-
pressible Begelhole, arrived at Mt. Deddick alleged mines
23rd March, and departed on 26th. What they expected
to do in two days I cannot imagine. A competent
geologist (Ferguson) with two assistants spent the first
half of last year industriously exploring the field, and his
report has never been published. Why doesn t Minister
Foster, the member for Deddick, publish that report in
justification of his unsuccessful appeal for a Deddick rail-
way? . • ,
There is a lull in the dredging boom; public
have neither time nor money to be engaged in two booms
at once, and the Westralian stock-boom is occupying the
whole of their attention. The two or three dredging
schemes floated in Sydney have marketable shares, and
the public have the assurance of the Sabbath tipster that
they are all going up.
* ♦ * •
The racecourse at Johannesburg for many years
was never thought to have any mining value, but the
“ deep levels ” have extended right out there, and now
original-members’ rights are worth about £5OOO a-piece.
Was ever so much money made on the turf as under it
in this instance? Many Yanks and a few Australians are
in the thick of the Rand stock boom, which is greater
than the two or three others preceding it. F. Drake,
formerly mining manager at Lucknow, and who before
that looked after the metallurgical end of several Aus-
tralian silver-mines, is a director on eleven boards of
Rand mines, the united value of which at ruling market
prices comes out at 17J millions—a little fact which, while
pleasing to some people, will undoubtedly make others
squirm. * , * *
A man just over from W.A. has the cheek to
tell this story—and show the slugs in proof. While work-
in a non-div.-paying claim he struck three fine slugs,
which he immediately secreted on his person. Coming to
the top, before being searched he coolly took out the
slugs, and, placing them one by one on the table, said:
“ Well, that’s mine ; that’s mine ; and that’s mine. Now
you can go on with the search.” The slugs could not be
identified as stolen, so all they could do was to sack him—
which they did, quick and lively !

• a . wee k After Gov. Tennyson’s arrival
in Adelaide, hardly a day passed without a con-
gratulatory and grovelsorne ode being printed in
one or other of the dailies. One of the most
hideous was. the effusion read from the stage of
Adelaide Royal by Wybert Reeve. The Governor
is himself to blame for a>l this, in that he went
out of his way, in his first speech, to express
admiration for 8. A. poetical talent, specially men-
tioning several local bards whose claims to im-
mortality are poor indeed.
* * * *
What hope either in this world or the next
for the paper (B.A. Register) which solemnly
prints such verses as these?—
There is a Governor somewhere in Aus-
tralia who occasionally exhibits his domestic
authority in the open. The other day his better
(much better) half ordered a small barrow-load of
trifles from the stall-holders at a semi-charity
bazaar to be delivered at the vice-regal mansion,
lhe articles were trotted along, and His Ex. met
them on the mat and glared at them wildly with
a my-God-can-this-be-true light in his eyes. Then
he repudiated the bundle with uncalled-for heat
and refused to allow himself to be ruined bv this
mad extravagance. So the bundle was returned
to the bazaar where charity now sits, moulting
and disconsolate.

In the appointment of next N.S.W.
Speaker the disposition of the candidate in regard
to hospitality will be taken into account as a prime
factor by many members. In the early days the
Speaker represented open-handed generosity in
dispensing food and drink to members. Wigram
Allen was generous also, but often excited irrita-
tion because of his “selections,” which, in many
cases, became cliques. But Barton revived the
old style. Young didn’t like crushes; four at a

bers dinners and seldom slakes an orator’s thirst

The Vic. Cabinet has been on the point of
p l ß tnr rV and ? U ?Y er an ambitious porter
at the G P.O. He is in his fourth year of medi-
cine at the University, and as Prof. M’Coy has a
vacancy for an • osteologist—a kind of bone-
gatherer—the porter naturally wants the billet,
lhe Prof, wants to import a man from London
and has induced the Govt, to go so far that the
Agent-General has a man waiting to hurry out.
lhe porter’s application was refused ; but he hap-
pens to be related to a parish priest in Isaac Isaacs’
electorate who threatens to turn the Irish vote
against Isaacs if his kinsman is not appointed, and
as Isaacs is quite capable of taking a hint, he has
been hotly battling with the Chief Sec. over the
matter even to the limit of very strained relations.
It appears that Prof. McCoy gave the porter a
trial one day, making him set up the bones of an
animal. He did his best, and when the affair was

Mungindi News states that whilst Father
M'Guinness, of Moree, was celebrating mass at
Mungindi on 12th ult., one of the congregation
invited the rev. gentleman to “come out and
have a drink.” These border yokels seem
to be a genial but thirsty lot. If memory
does not play false, it was at Mungin-

as follows: “Take the

J.D. : gaol-yard identifica-
tions. A man I know lately had a
valueless cheque passed upon him.
Himself and son of 15 were taken
to police-station to identify a man
arrested on suspicion. The father
could not identify, but the youngster
did so positively from amongst "four
others. Afterwards father asked son
how he could be so sure, and that hope-
ful replied: “Well, yer see, I noo
all the others; Splodger Barkly,
Casey’s old swabber-out, and two other
old boozers from The Queen’s. I could
pick the one left all right.”

He was afterwards arrested, and I was
taken to identify him. Before en-
tering the gaol, the constable (who evi-
dently wanted to make sure of a
“case”) was kind enough to tell me
what color clothes he was wearing, so
that I could easily pick him out of’the
rank ranged up. I thought it was a
bit too strong, so I didn’t identify
him. J

visitor was one afternoon placed in

rice, kite, and, on receiving
the slates for correction, found to
her surprise, that the juveniles had
written—“ Waves, mace, tales, race,

never “seen the cat after maice ”
they replied, “No, miss; we never
seen no maces,” and when the
teacher wrote “mice” on the black-

When a white man marries a half-caste
aboriginal he should support her. But if, whether
through being a loafer or out of employment he
doesn t, does the half-caste woman lose her claim
on the Govt, subsidy? That is the troubleN S W
Aborigines Board recently tackled and unani-
mously answered in the affirmative. The answer
is unsatisfactory It means that if a gin marries a
black man hen claim continues, but if a white one
she loses it. The grant to aborigines cuts no such
fine distinctions, and the Board is not such a sue-
cess that it should be allowed to stray from the
letter of the law. What the Board has in its
head is to make the white husband maintain his
wife. But this is not the Board’s province
Meanwhile, the full-blooded or half-caste wife’s
claim on rations is a legal one.

The Dungey-Bromley conspiracy scandal
is not yet securely buried, as Vic. Crown Law
department would like to believe, for it seems
that the smellful action of Mr. Panton

Parliament. Pwo or three members are named as
being 1 ready to take the matter up vigorously at
the suggestion of Castlemaine M‘Cay, the man
who fought Govt, and beat it badly on the Vac-

The woman Potter—witnes.s in the Dungey-
Bromley farce, at Melb. City Police-court-was
brought from Pentridge in prison uniform. The
same is the case with prisoners being transferred
from Melb. to up-country gaols. As the Vic. Law
authorities are so fond of flying to England for
precedents, why don’t they follow in this, the more
humane British custom, of allowing a transferred
prisoner, or one brought from gaol to give evidence
to wear his own clothes? Also, why shouldn’t
accompanying constables be in plain clothes?
I hey have the “bracelets” and the revolver if

At the adjourned inquest on Jessie Bent-
ley, who lately suicided by cyanide of potassium, it
was remarked as a “ peculiar fact ” that she had
washed her feet and changed her clothing, by
way of preparation for “being found dead in a
seemly clean condition.” But there is nothing at
all peculiar” about Jessie Bentley’s action.
Women invariably put on clean underclothing
when they go abroad from home—in view of acci-
dent giving the hospital-nurses an opportunity of
noting the condition of their linen. Woman
dreads the other woman. The sex’s opinions as
to the manner in which one of its number is
dressed, or is washed, is as abjectly feared as is its
dictum on morals. Writer once heard of a man
who, weathering a terrible period of storm and
financial stress, broached suicide to his wife
“Very well, Bill,” she replied, “I’ll do it with
r°u' fl I }'? glve me tlme t 0 chan £ e all my clothes.
I should like to be found clean and properiy dressed
when I’m dead.” Whereupon the humor of the
situation struck Bill.

A GOOD PEN'ORTH
If the truth must be told, the lawn fete for the benefit of the Mission Church fund of Dahrswahr was not
going too well, It was decidedly "show," and people MUST be got to talk somehow. The new missionary
oppreached the canital belle, and more for the sake of conversation than anything else, observed pleasantly:
"A penny for your thoughts, miss!"
"I was thinking," she replied, naively, "whether you would be better stewed over a slow fire, like the last
pracker man, or staffed with bread-fruit and baked whole for a change. YOu gib it penny-what?"
Then, welcome, Baron Tennyson
A noble Father's worthy son,
You have our hearts, the battle’s won,
Welcome, welcome, Tennyson.

We now to your respect aspire,
Our hearts have all but one desire,
To love our Hallam Tennyson.

* rapid strides throughout the Australasian
colonies. Although it is not long since the
cetylene gas Company
of Australasia Ltd.
commenced operations in Sydney, quite a large
number of Stores, Hotels and Private Dwellings
in the city and country are lit up with this beauti-
ful illuminant with universal satisfaction. Owing
to the enormous demand for Carbide, the Directors
have decided to immediately proceed with the
ERECTION of CARBIDE WORKS, and ere
long the industry must become exceedingly pros-
perous.
The Directors have also decided to close the
list for the First Issue of Shares on Bth MAY,
All applications must be in the hands of the Secre-
tary not later than 2nd May, and it would be well
for investors to send for prospectus and full in-
formation concerning Acetylene Gas.
Countryfolk should call and inspect the light
when in town, as it offers many advantages over
all other illuminants.

On one day of Easter encampment of Q.
volunteer-forces, at Toowoomba, the headquarters
band mutinied, and was ordered back to barracks,
where instruments and side-arms were taken
away, and the members sent back to Brisbane.
The incident occurred during the march through
the main street. The Brisbane men were aggrieved
that Toowoomba band should have precedence in
the order of march, and refused to strike up,
whereupon the parade was halted, and returned to
camp. Hundreds of spectators witnessed the
affair, yet not one Q. paper said a word about it.

W.A. is blessed with a Public Works De-
partment that “ lays over ” everything else of the
kind in Australia. A sample of its work is the
new observatory. The observatory site is the
best possible— i.e., the highest part of Perth. But
the department was instructed to build quarters
for the astronomer. This was done at a cost of
<£7500 (and astronomer Cook has to live in them
with a screw of £5OO a year). The quarters are a
massive, imposing two-storey structure, with a
tower built so as to block a big portion of the
northern sky from the telescope in the observatory
proper !

A donkey and a pony, fco be hired by chil-
dren, have appeared on Manly Beach. Many,
many years ago there were many donkeys for hire
on the sands at Manly ; and the donkey-provi-
dores, having made much money, founded fami-
lies. The families were, of course, ashamed of the
donkeys, and have ever since, so it has long been
alleged, exetcised their potent influence in the
direction of having retail donkey-hiring inter-
dicted locally.
“ Constance C.” : Says a Sydney

Which reminds writer that in Maoriland
once a politician advocated letting all
women travel for nothing. This might
do in M.L., where the men resemble
men, but in this land of the weed-loving
and weedy youth the number of travel-
ling women would unaccountably in-
crease, and dress-skirts to be hooked in
at a moment’s notice would come to be
a regular part of the economical

Ceeile Andersen (Vic.), the Danish woman
who shot a man from whom she had received gross
injury, and who was sentenced to life imprison-
ment, has now served five years in gaol. Many
think she has suffered enough. The circumstances
under which the crime was committed were of a
nature that appealed to public sympathy on behalf
of the offender. Her wrongs had undoubtedly
unhinged her judgment. Anyway, there was
primitive justice in her action. A movement is
afoot to have her sentence quashed, and the poor
woman released, and there is a chance that this
will be brought about. There are ways of collaring
the Law by the ear without invoking its machinery,
and this is a case in which they should be put in
action.
“R. Hap”: The
leading lights of
a certain Syd-
ney suburban
church are
divided in-
to the “misi-
sio nary”
party and
the “local-
repair” dit-
to. At a re-
cent meet-
ing the par-
son sugges-
ted that all
hands
should re-
tire and of-
fer prayer
for funds.
They di d
so, and on
return to
the room a
roll of not's
was found
on the sec. ’s
blotting-
pad. A “lo-
cal - repair ”
man promptly moved
that the money be devoted
to church requirements, and the
motion was carried, whereupon a member
of the “ missionary ” push pranced around,
accusing the other side of virtually ob-
taining, under false pretences, money
donated for the aid of missionary
work. “And if it is not so ap-
plied,” he concluded, “I’ll sever my
connection with the church!” Then
he jammed his hat over his ears and
stalked out.
An Italian warship “struck” S.A. the
other day and fired the customary salute. It
happened that only one member of Largs Fort
garrison, the cook, happened to be home at the
time ; and as he wasn’t sure which were the right
guns and is frightened of firearms, anyhow, he took
a cab, hunted up the garrison, and the return
salute was fired about shrs. later, much to the
relief of the Italian commander, who was
beginning to fear that the local fire-eater had some
grudge against him.
A divorce-case was once settled in
Sydney with an axe as intervener. The
lady was charming, and she sued her
husband, an athlete and a son of Anak,
on the ground of faithlessness. Madam
eschewed all Yes-No considerations, her
mind was adamant. She instructed her
lawyers to go on to the very bitter, to
listen to no overtures of compromise. On
the morning set down for the hearing,
the lady’s sharks received peremptory
instructions to stop proceedings. They
rushed to her hotel, and were waited
upon by a bearded man with colossal
shoulders, and in his wake meekly fol-
lowed their little client, now and again
appealingly glancingat her consort. “You
must withdraw the case at once,” said
the big man. “ Yes, at once,” assented
the little woman. “ Don’t let it go a step
further. This is my husband. We have
made it up. He got into this hotel last
night—with—with an axe. He knocked
at the door of my room ; didn’t you,
Dick? I—l didn’t answer him. Then he
Called out my name; didn’t you, Dick?
And he tried the handle of the door. The
key was turned in the lock ; but he took
his axe and broke the lock off ; didn’t you,
Dick ? ” And there was nothing more to
be said.
In the Divorce Court the snide soli-
citor who battens on the lowest and most
debased of humanity’s instincts finds a
profitable and congenial arena. The
Judge in Divorce often labors to bring
mutually-weary man and woman back
into the conjugal fold ; but these eleventh-
hour reconciliations suit not the book of
the Gent One. The other day the Judge
postponed his decision in a suit so that
the parties should have a chance of mak-
ing it up. Quite by accident the male
person met his suing better-half in the
street, near the Court. Seeing a chancs
for an explanation, he asked his wife to
walk with him to the house, of/a mutual
friend and talk matters over. But hubby
was seen by Mr. Capias Sat., who rushed up hat-
less, and, drawing his client by the arm and
hurrying her into a cab, shouted, “ Don’t you
listen to him ! Don’t you listen to him ! ” And the
Judge’s kind intention was snapped in twain by
the shark, who had no perception for anything
but costs.

A correspondent: He that Gatton affair.
What became of the blood-stained pillow-slip
which M‘Neil was reported to have found and
handed to the police? Was no evidence procur-
able of the quarrel between Michael Murphy and
a relative of his (not MdSTeil) a few days before

aggressive spirit shown by Mrs. Murphy in neigh-
bors’ squabbles with her almost-peaceful resigna-

“Melb.” : A R.C. print is indignant at a
published statement that a number of nuns, of “ re-
gular ” orders, were conspicuous at a recent shivoo
aboard the Sunbeam. A genuine nun is never
allowed to attend any pleasure-making of the
kind, or desires to. On the other hand, it is just
where the Protestant nuns are at home. Brothers
Tadger and Snutflebottom are deliciously sarcastic
on their Wesleyanie sisters of this kind, the pretty
ones going off in wedlock like ripe cherries in the
market, appetised by their bibs, tuckers and veils,

mile off. The real article apparently never sees

Has many wonders seen—
The shepherd lass wed with a king,
The shepherd with a queen ;
But such a wonder as my love
Was never seen before—
It is my joy and sorrow now
To love her evermore.
The sea-coast of Bohemia
Is haunted by a light
Of memory of lady’s eyes
And fame of gallant knight;
The princes seek its charmbd strand,
But, ah ! it was our knell
When o’er the sea our Perdita
Went with young Florizel.
The sea-coast of Bohemia
Is not my resting place,
For with her waned from out the day
A beauty and a grace :
O, had I kissed her on the lips
I would no longer weep,
But live by that until the day
I fall to shade and sleep.

THE SWING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We sat on a seat in a garden old,
And your lips were close but your eyes were clear ;
My heart was hot hut’my feet were cold,
And love is a flower the frost turns sere ;
So we called a truce to our whispering,
And we walked across to the children’s swing.
I called it a scaffold, where cruel girls
Were swung till love in their hearts was bred,
And you skimmed the air till the amber cnrls
Were a flying halo around your head :
Then I taught you a new and a cunning thing—
How two could float on the selfsame swing.
And sweet I found was the swift kiss pressed
With the taut rope poised in its steep incline,
And sweeter the lingering fall to rest
While your lips grew tender,.and clung to mine ;
But sweetest the passionate murmuring
When the moon looked down on an empty swing.
Now you are a matron, and I grow old ;
We have both gained weight, and the swing-rope’s
rotten ;
That evening’s lesson is now enrolled
With the numberless things we have long forgotten :
To recall it now were a heinous thing,
But I always laugh when I pass a swing.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Mr D M M™_ Sydney ’ April 24 - 1899 -
Chrysanthemums showed themselves off in much
golden glory at the Horticultural Society’s exhi-
bition last week Government House lent the
grounds. But other people brought in pink-glazed
fm limp’!; shrouded the tables as they used to do
for little pink strangers. Big bronze, and brown
fnf*K COt ’- a ? d blossoms rebel against
mfantde pink-glazed lining under their chins.

that 1S 8, -f ?i! g P?* °J ff rowi ng yellow flowers
that iooked as ff they had been let alone was the
most satisfying exhibit.
n J’°P luckoff the heads of all the big, fat, bloated,
wlf 1 ’ , ov ergr°wn flowers; deprive them of
leaves and stalk ; lay them, neckless and limbless,
"J on i row r s on long tables ; label them Dorothy
and .Tohn Jones, and Lady Jemima Smith,
and Sir William Arthur Pander ; try all a man or
woman can to bring them into animal semblance—
is it beautiful ? Or is it ugly? Anyhow, this is
the way in which the nineteenth century delights
to make a show of its flowers.
Many people from the show strolled over to
' jovt j "Ouse, a.nd viewed the alterations. The
sacred budding is m the hands of masons just now.
Liferything is jumbled up in quite plebeian masses.
Ihe narrow, incompetent ball-room is being
lengthened but the addition looks rather trifling

to be as much as that. The hall is going to be

The Woo Hey Scholarship (-6150 a year for two
years) has been awarded to Mr. H. S. Dettmann,
one of last year s graduates. The winner was for
some time hon. sec. ‘to the University Union
and is remembered to have made a clear and
lather forcible speech on the occasion of Mr
Larton s big Federation meeting at the University
last year. Mr. Dettmann was also very much
connected with the Students’ Christian Union
movement. The conditions of the Woolley Scholar-
ship imply travel so the erstwhile Union secretary
is already off on his weary trot round the world.
t The , late f * Sydney girl with a voice is Miss Ruby
J.rene Marks who made her debut last Wednesday
at the Y.M.C.A. Hall. Unluckily, Miss Marks
was the victim of a bad sore throat, and had little
X°? ce f Iher1 her ®. omma nd. Mr. H. Weir explained
this to the audience, and asked indulgence, which
was granted, even before the debutante showed
herself in a pale pink frock with rosebuds in her
hair. Ihe new warbler has an expressive way of
singing much charm of manner, and a carefully
cultivated style, but of her voice, as a voice, it was
impossible to judge. It appeared sweet, but
litl? 1 co ? cert itself w as a picturesque
httle matter decorated with lots of palms
and banks of greenery, and an acting V.R
party. bo Hebraic was the audience that
one little song might have been altered from
Sontag to Saturday’’without anyone notic-
ing Miss Blanche Thomas lent her rich, un-
emotional tones to something of Handel’s; Mr
Henry Weir showed that the art of singing love-

and the audience clapped smartly, clapped little
ovely Traumerei, full of the haunting melan-
choly of the ram. 6
We hear a great deal about “voices ” nowadays.
More than any other part of the human organism,
le voice is a “topic” for tea-parties, dinner-
parties, even after-dinner parties. Wherever you
41 ear of a new voice, a voice that is going
to be heard. Sydney is almost as agitated as Mel-
bourne? over the sensational debut of the new
sopran|>, Miss Amy- Castles, Everybody is talk-
ing abbut her. Dr, if not of her, of somebody
else who has just been discovered, and will help to
n eap fame on the national organism. And, all the
time the most wicked inflections in the whole
ssl-skmair and
i l'i rl ? n< 3 s of a well-known singer are giving her a
little benefit dance at Paddington Town Hall on
Thursday, April 27th. The Signora has fallen on
hard times lately. Mrs. R. J. Baumann and Mrs.
i ' Tompson are managing this hop, the
tickets for which are selling at ss. each.
Fort-street children went to see “ Othello ” last
Today. There were no fig-leaves strewn along
the play for them—and Rignold’s edition is singu-
larly bare—but a bevy of teachers kept guard, and
guided the applause into proper young places.
Ihe children joined in; not one heavy passage
went unsaluted. All was going splendidly, and a
fine discrimination for Shakespeare seemed to be
beaming out of those hundreds of young eyes
when suddenly Othello threw himself on the floor
and rolled about, moaning and roaring with
anguish. This is an inspiration of Rignold’s
ownest own. You have to be very grave and
reverend here, or a sense of the ridiculous will
play havoc with ymir peace of mind. The teachers
were taken off their guard. There was a moment’s
silence. Then Fort-street lifted up its voice and
roared with laughter! The teachers came down
with an awful “ shish, ” but it was too late. Fort-
street seemed to believe that the big, fat, black
man was rolling on the floor for their sakes, and
bursts of laughter and giggles turned every one of
those elephantine rolls into low comedy.
Saturday night at the Broughs is quite a fore-
gone conclusion now. The d.c. wonders if it can
be the same d.c. that used to hold people with
hats and peppermints. Snobility comes out in all
its fiercest raiment, and feels so nice and intellec-
tual as it turns the light of its own diamonds on
the wit of the play. “Lord and Lady Algy”
brought about the gayest house of the season.
; Mitchell glittered from a box in white
and steel with red roses in her hair, which has re-
turned to the top of her head. Mrs. Ernest Wil-
shire, the latest bride, underwent a heavy fire of
opera-glasses. Coming out, it was painful to find
oneself rubbing against velveteen wraps on all
smes. 1 saw one man shiver as if he were struck
molar-twinge as two red-velveted sisters
sought his arm.
Mrs. Brough, as Lady Algy, strikes an original
note in a strange fawn-silk skirt, with red stripes
an inch wide running up and down her. This is
topped with a happy red-velvet blouse, and a band
of black velvet round the throat. Finally, a racy,
mghly-becommg toque of red velvet, lifts up the
whole costume. Miss Grace Noble’s reappearance
brought out a splendid welcome, and lots of
tl °u V f rS :, , has & r °wn thin, and suffered from a
subdued make-up that seemed to put her face into
the background. Her smartest frock was the
grey-green travelling scheme in which she
purposed to run away with Quarmby. But
.he true-lover s knots braided all over this scheme
were so large and deliberate that you couldn’t believe
any sensible woman would elope in a frock so
heavily branded with her affairs.
As for the rest of the women in the play, Wini-
fred Austin makes a brief appearance in the Fancy
Dress Ball scene, as a little maid, in a dark wig
and short skirt. Miss Bessie Thompson is also
only seen in fancy dress. The play requires her
to look ugly, and she looks two degrees more. As
for Miss Evelyn Martheze, she still fails to make
one understand why she was brought all the way
house s '^ me t 0 before critical Australian
Six nights of lolanthe ” give Charles Kenning-
ham something to do at last. Four months was a
*? n ° time to be eating his head off in idleness.
A red wig on the round, boyish face gives him a
jollier look than ever. Mr. Bathurst also comes
out as a thing of beauty without a moustache. In
his black velvet knee-breeches he looks like a
coupie of Julius Knights. But what has happened
to Pauli the beautiful ? A deep dark red stains
his face three shades hotter than the cover of this
burning paper. Over this expanse of broad red
country a night-cap might be poetical, but a
little black hat with blue and pink tails is
cruelly uncharitable.
Rumor avers that Gilbert himself says Flora
Perry is his ideal Phyllis, as far as looks go.
ohe looks a most dainty, chic little person, with a
strong resemblance to an animated egg-boiler in
her blue silk polonaise and pink skirt. Her tiny
hands are as pretty as pictures. But her work
which is carefully artistic, too —doesn’t quite get
over the footlights. Dolly Vane is Dolly Vane
again m white draperies and crimped gold hair.
Is it fancy, or is there considerably more of
Dorothy than there used to be ? Anyway, her
lolanthe shows that she can quietly efface herself
when needed.
The deadly effects of the chorus on a good voice
are for ever preached. But “ lolanthe ” shows to
the contrary. the best voices in the opera
comes from Mr. Stannis Leslie, as Private Willis
who has been singing as hard as he can in the
chorus for 12 whole years.
A theatrical marriage that has been denied and
and finally denied, joined “Billy Pauli,”
of the b irm s Comic Opera Co., to a pretty chorus-
girl from the same co. Somehow, Pauli has never
coruscated m Sydney girls’ hearts to the devastat-
or 1 ? ex^en At one time it seemed as
if he would put out the light of Ryley and Brown-
low and the superior Julius as the idol of adoring
women. Perhaps it was his definite worship of
one fair star m a sailor hat that made other women
recede. His marriage, if it does come off, may

Wedding presents are becoming “curiouser and
cunouser down South. It is “ quite the thing ”
now to present the bride with a canary. In the
three most fashionable Melb. weddings chronicled
recently, the announcements varied as follows:
Canary, canary in cage,” “canary in brass
cage. Other gay and festive offerings are bath-
shoes, head-shawls, “work,’’and other things far
too weird to mention in a sober paper.
Many wives of N.S.W. legislators abhor politics
and are particularly perturbed when a new session
is nigh. They cannot be induced, under any cir-
cumstances, to visit the Ladies’ Gallery. The
better-half of an idol of the electors declares she
will yet wean him of politics ; while another
nightly prays that Parliament House may be re-

able lady to post herself outside a newspaper-
othce on polling-nights only to be infuriated by
the sight of her husband’s name at the top of the

m her locket a miniature of her husband’s seem-
ingly invincible rival on the floor of the House.
From Miss I. E. Wyndham I have just received
particulars of a new departure in women’s work—
new to Sydney,_ that is. It has been followed
advantageously in Melbourne for some time. The
scheme calls itself “The Artistic Work Dep6t,”
and will help ladies to dispose of their fancy work
more profitably. Also, you can leave orders all in
one breath for mending, renovating hats and bon-
nets, making evening and day costumes, decorat-
ing dinner and supper tables, and catering for
afternoon teas and suppers. The depot will be
opened May Ist at 167 Vickery’s Chambers.
Tii o crusade to crush flowers is waxing bolder.
1 hey have already driven flowers out of funerals.
-But those who can’t die can get married. So now
High Church clergymen are swooping down on
nnf blossoms that always cling about a wedding.
Ihe other day a very High Churchman refused to
let a band of girl friends decorate his church for a
certain wedding. The girls came in armed with
their flowers and greens, but were remorselessly
f™n away by the parson, who told them
that they mustn’t dream of bringing natural blos-
soms into that high, aesthetic worship-shop. In
vain they pleaded. Rose-scents had to give way
to incense. Finally, the decorators went away in
great wrath and worked off their injured feelings all
over the staircase and gas-lamps of the bride’s
house.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Already the ‘discoverers’ of Amy Castles
have moderated their transports concerning her
voice, and begun to express doubts about her
qualifications, physical and mental, for a great
Career. The damsel has thrown off the authority
otherfirst patronesses—Mrs. Doubleday and Mrs.
. B°b Best—who worked like niggers to bring her
into notice when there was little prospect of a
bcxim, and she is now being managed by Messrs.
-Li. L. Lewis and Mars Buckley, under Guvment-
ouse patronage. Wherefore Mrs. D. and Mrs. B.
made scornful remarks. The latter energetic lady,
Twr'n 11 ®’ s P three weeks in cab-riding around
Melbourne, preaching the gospel of Castles to
everyone she knew, is not unnaturally annoyed
j, herself ‘ left out in the cold, with
hardly a word of thanks for her pains.’ Mrs.
JJoubleday s grievance is tempered by the
reflection that although I pa ’ Castles gave all
Cr j . bls daughter’s success to Allan
and Co., it was she, and not Allans’, who ran the
concerts and drew the receipts. All the same, she
teels heartily disgusted at the turn affairs have
taken. Meanwhile there is some question as to
the genuineness of little Miss Amy’s allegiance to
the new people who are planning a farewell boom
" Amidst the dm one hears a whisper to
the effect that when the proceeds of the farewell
concerts have been raked in the damsel will trip
into a Vic. convent to complete her education.
Pity that some shapely, patriotic, Australian-
born stage-campaigner does not regard with com-
passion the platform awkwardness of local Conser-
vatonum ugly-ducklings, and give them a few
lessons on the importance of looking like swans.
Marshall Hall and co. cope effectually with their

Ernest Moffitt and Carl De Beer—the latter a
brilliant boy of 22. Belonging to a talented,
cultured family, Carl De Beer took to learning as
his natural provender. Music, mathematics,
rhetoric, debate, nothing seemed to come to him
amiss. As m the case of Ernest Moffitt the
weather was indirectly the cause of his death
Commencement Day at Melb. University, with
bitter winds and drenching rains coming suddenly
after the heat, chilled the spirits of the under-
grads., and so it happened that Carl De Beer, out
ot pure enthusiasm, started a fresh song, and
shouted so wildly that he twisted an intestine like
a corkscrew. An operation was instantly per-
formed but the part was dead—the too-demonstra-
tive had in fact, begun to die as soon as the last
shout left his lips.

“The ‘charitableness ’ of the late James Hosie,

to have been the result of a quarrel with

not to leave any money to his married

death, and would, no doubt, have given further

, iS r c essa B' e re the death of an Australian
notable from one politician to another politician
contrived to skim across the thin ice. The sender
of the wire remarked that his province deeply
sympathised with the afflicted province, and especi-
afly with the relatives, ‘to whom will you kindly
communicate this message.’ Years ago people
told a rather pretty little story of two young
damsels who struck up a friendship through
travelling together by train, every morning, to
their respective schools. They had become quite
chummy before they discovered that they wer.3

disagreeable when in company,’ lately wrote
to our only evening journal for advice on the sub-

to take plenty of out-door exercise and ‘ avoid
cabbage, broad beans, ’ &c. It seems to be true
that the heart of a cabbage is desperately wicked
but the Herald oracle was probably wrong in
ascribing the damsel’s internal noises to her vege-

Women doctors declare that tea is the principal

A Melbourne parson, holding forth on the

situation and, m spite of what society said, they

notion of our young women is quite respectable
and gilt-edged. Our young women have been

horrified to see them soil their little hands to earn
an honest penny. As for the inferior females, who
are always at work, except when financial crashes
occur to throw them out of employment for a time

ERRORS IN FOOD AND DRINK
By a Specialist.
Iti is dawning on the public to try and prevent,
or at least to arrest, disease. It is in prevention
that Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa plays an important
part, acting solely as a first-class nourishing food
—it strengthens the system to resist, oppose, and
overcome the attacks of disease. You’ll hear
someone say, “So-and-so has a strong constitu-
tion ”; follow that up, and you’ll find that So-
and-so follows the golden rule of being temperate
in all things, and pays attention to diet and exer-
cise. Does he or she keep up this strong constitu-
tion by taking medicine or swallowing pills? No
indeed ! They have discovered that prevention is
better than cure. Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa places a
means in the hands of everyone to build up and
maintain a sound constitution, which enables its
possessor to travel his life’s journey without the
aches and pains which are in many cases pre-
ventible. Thus we come round again to sound
common-sense based on experience.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 269 George-street, Sydney.

Artist Nerli lately arrived in
Sydney from Westralia, en route
for Maoriland. A few years ago he
was living in Sydney, and making a
reputation as one of Australia’s first
painters. His study of the head of
an old Italian peasant woman is a
perfect gem, and his portraits of
Dr. Marano and Miss Myra Kemble
are things of joy. By the way, Nerli
is now married and clean shaven.
He is also a Marquis of the king-
dom of Italy. His mother was a
Miss Medwin, daughter of that
English Captain Medwin who was
the friend and memorialist of the
poet Byron.
That marvellous draughts-player, James
Wyllie, “ The Herd Laddie,” is now in Heaven—
no doubt playing checkers with the angels and
prefacing each game with “ Put doun yer shullin!”
Out of 8000 games played in Australia, Wyllie
lost but 25 and drew 100.
English dockers’ leader, Tom Mann, is the
most conspicuous of many agitators who have
purchased pubs, and attached themselves to the
fringe of the plutocracy. Several men who used
to help the N.S.W. worker to “higher things”
now serve out drinks to the thirsty toiler. Andy
Kelly and Tom Davis, ex-M’sL. A., both became
hotel-proprietors, and Eight-hour secretary Furse
also runs a pub. in a Sydney suburb. Also George
Black is writing for the Conservative S.M.
Herald.
James Service’s father. Robert Service,
used to be familiar in Melb. He was a little man,
his face a quizzical burlesque on that of James,
with the nose a lot more on one side, as if it had
been flattened down with a thumb. His vocation
was that of a humble Baptist preacher, with no
anxiety about the Plate, because there was the
mahogany at James’s magnificent mansion, “Kil-
winning,” at Balaclava, to stick his legs under.
James was an Agnostic ; no one ever heard of his
going to kurruk.
Felix Faure’s demise was, after all, not a
case of Felix 0/>portimitate Mortis. When it was
telephoned to London, the French Embassy ar-
ranged for High Mass at Westminster, to be
attended by the Ambassador and English notabili-
ties. In consequence, evidently, of another mes-
sage from Paris, the Embassy sent a particular
direction that the function must be Low Mass—
which it was, at first greatly to the surprise of the
press. Tongues were kept buzzing when the news
came that the Parisian religious ceremony, with
all its glory, was only Low Mass. The case will
be a reminder of that of the English Judge who
died at an equivocal house in the provinces after
he had been suitably lecturing the sinners at the
assizes. Not long ago a Pompeiian exhumation
fetched up a fine woman and an elderly gentleman,
smothered in the ashes at one of the houses with
the frescoes. Paris L ’lllustration gave an en-
graving of the pair. Providence repeats itself.

HORSES (RIDDEN BY ITALIAN CAVALRYMEN)
AS MOUNTAIN-CLIMBERS. —From a[?]tual photo-
graphs printed in “ Navy and Army Illustrated,”
March 4, ‘99.
It will be an eye-opener to Horse-tralia to
find that the Italians have made a specialty of
such remarkable horsemanship feats as are in this
issue depicted as being performed by cavalry-
officers of that nation. The abilities of the gee-
gee himself in this respect have also hitherto
been quite unsuspected amongst Britishers.
W. K. D Arcy, the Mountmorganaire, has
bought the residence of the Dowager Countess
Dudley, in Grosvenor-square, London ; and Frank
Gardiner (Mr. Carrie Swain), now a millionaire
lately purchased for .£160,000 a sumptuous Paris
mansion formerly owned by the Empress Eugenie.
The trail of Ben Tillett is still over Melb.

“Tillett tonsure,” which falls over his collar like a
cascade, and makes him resemble an over-fed
eagle.
A metropolitan press-
man, soliciting a certain
Australian Governor for an
advance copy of a forth-
coming speech, was re-
ceived in H.E.’s sanctum
and urbanely informed that
the great man would en-
deavor to give him the
main outlines of the speech.
The scribe was placed at a
table facing a blank wall,
while H. M.’s representa-
tive assumed a thoughtful
attitude and paced the floor
Behind him. “ Um,’’began
the Gov., “my —u m—
speech will be somewhat—
um, um, um—on the fol-
lowing lines. Undah the.
existing conditions of the
Empiah—um, um, um—
coinmah—the naval supre-
macy of the nations of
Europe—um, um, um—is
of the greatest moment-
full stop. It is the secret
of um modern —um—
warfare —semi-colon—it is
”, Then the scribe,
watching until the great
pro-consul was retreating
to the other side of the
room, peeped stealthily
round and saw him care-
fully reading his extem-
pore speech from type-
written notes.
The latest “new

smith who has come to

N.S.W. Speakership is in an almost direct
line to an Imperial title. Those who took the
Chair as plain “misters,” and developed into
knights, baronets, and so on, were Nicholson
(Dr.), Cooper, Murray, Hay, Allen, and Abbott.
Alex. M‘Leay remained Mister, but Arnold would
have stepped up next session had he not been
drowned. Barton was offered a title, ana Young
would have been now a knight had not the
potato-market slumped at a delicate juncture.
Dear Bulletin.—Recently died in Sydney
a citizen who was for many years a liberal contri-
butor to several churches. Where did he die ? In
the Benevolent Asylum, at 79. A warning to
those who give liberally to churches. When your
turn comes to be destitute you may die in the
gutter. Those who have taken freely from you
for “Assistant Clergy Fund,” “Mission to the
Chinese,” &c., will forget that you 6ver lived.
Mission to the Chinese ! —while a good white man
dies in an asylum ! —Rough On Rats.
A jolly old soul. Archdeacon Stretch, the
other day, died at Malvern, Melb. Ballarat and
Geelong loved him of yore, this. Sydney Smith of
a man, not burdened with theology, but a rare
judge of crops, a born bucolic, and better than a
Roman priest at wheedling cash, whereby he got
the solid A. 30,000 needed to persuade Thornton to
understand that the Lord called him to Ballarat
from the Birmingham slums. Stretch, with more
brains, was such another as jovial Toorakian
pastor Walter Fellows, brother of the Judge.
For those who knew him not, he micht be
described as a compound of Harcourt, the English
politician, and comedian Harwood.
Father Kavanagh lectured a
few weeks ago, in Cork, on “ People
I H ave Met,” touching on two emin-
ent Sydneyites, Archbishop Vaughan
and Dailey. The Archbishop, he said,
simply wrote out a sermon and then
knew every word. Chas. Gavan Duffy
had the same gift, in his political
speeches. Dailey, on arriving in Dub-
lin, of course fell in with the intelli-
gent carman. He found at once that
Dailey was a very superior man, and
formed the theory that he was a
Fenian General. Dailey, of course,
humored this, with mysterious talk.
At parting, the cabman said, “Now,
tell me who you are.” Dailey whis-
pered in his ear, “I’m a Polynesian.”
Cabby, overwhelmed by this disclo-
sure of another Branch, said, “ Ah, I knew you
was. I’m one of the Bhis meself. But be
careful of thim polis.” Father Kavanagh credits
the yarn about a girl being christened Pat on an
immigrant-ship. He says the priest did the job
again, saying, “I can’t lift the whole name off
her. She must be called Patricia.”
When Varney Parkes visited the Albion
Park (N.S.W.) show, Hassall, of the Gwydir, was
“on the spout.” A very old woman nudged this
scribe and asked, “Is yon Varney?” Writer
nodded. Then she took a long, steady look at the
big Gwydir man and exclaimed, “ Mon ! but he’s
like his father.” Somepeople will identify anybody.
Ex-Gov. M‘Gregor lately wrote to Premier
Dickson that he had named a lofty mountain
(11,584 ft.) in Papua after the Q. Premier.. “Mt.
Dickson,” M‘Gregor writes, “is very bare of trees
and shrubs on the top. It has no native name. I
have given it the name of an old and highly-
valued friend, a Prime Minister of Queensland, of
which this note will bear witness to your descend-
ants when you and I are silent.” The delicacy of
the allusion to Dickson’s baldness ! The moun-
tain is very “ bare on top.” And some folks say
the Scotch have no humor.
Vasey, recently-deceased, sec. of Melb.
Gas Co., was a perfect realisation of Fatman.
Short, stout, bald, red-faced, and side-whiskered,
Vasey was the ideal Conservative, and acted up
to his appearance. A heavy shareholder ip the
concern he managed so successfully, Vasey rigor-
ously cut down expenses and worked the office
chiefly with boys who might, if they were very
good boys indeed, in time draw A 1 a week. He
was a leading light of the now moribund Y. M.C. A.
in the days when Matt. Davies loomed also large
in connection therewith, and a heap of Vasey’s
cash is alleged to have gone into the white-
elephant Bourke-street pile since sold to and now
run by the Salvarmy.
“MEDOR,” Melb. Eastern Market Murderer.
(A sketch from life.)
Medor, the cranky astrologer who mur-
dered a fellow-tenant in Melb. Eastern Market,
the other day, is well-known by sight to nearly
everybody in Melb., being a big, broad six-footer,
always frockcoated and belltoppered, and his
long brown hair waving over his collar. He is
supposed, on good authority, to be the son of one
of Australia’s early surveyor-generals. He is close
on 60 years old, and his “rattiness ” is supported
by documentary evidence of long standing, show-
ing him to be a firm believer in his own craft.
Archbishop Redwood, of Maoriland,
spoken of as a coming Cardinal, was only three
years of age when he landed in M.L., and so may
be regarded as a local product. His. brother
Henry, the “ Father ” of the Maoriland turf, says
that “ Frank ” even now is as good a judge of
horseflesh as he is. But the Archbishop’s only
known hobby is the fiddle; he possesses a genuine
“ Strad ” valued at over four figures.
The acceptance by the Duke of Connaught
of succession to the sovereignty of Saxe-Coburg-
Gotha reminds old Sydneyites of the visit made
to Sydney, 29 years ago, by Prince Philip and
Prince Augustus, of that Dukedom, and of the
whirl of festivities which accompanied it. Those
princes were Queen Victoria’s cousins, so that, by
Edinburgh and Connaught, she gets a step nearer
Saxe-Coburg, instead of veering farther off.
O
The Bulletin happened early the other :
morning upon a spectacle which has consider- '
ably damaged its opinion that the typica If j
unhumorou 4 person is the parson. Outsioe j
the Diocesan Registry in Phillip-street, Syd- j
ney, was a fantastically-arrayed little crowd, i
which upon enquiry turned out to be the law-
students’ contingent of the University Commemo-
ration procession. The desperate seriousness, nob
to say solemnity, with which tlie-e embryo sharks
appeared to take the clumsy grotesquerie
of their “make-ups” was suggestive of nothing
so much as a prospective departure to
speedy and collective execution per the lorry
which stood in waiting for them ; but as this, un-
fortunately, was not in contemplation, it is, per-
haps, to be supposed that these wooden-visaged
youths, who seemed to be all more or less ashamed
of their idiocy, regarded themselves as furnishing
an artistic exposition rather than a grievous spec-
tacle of puerile mountebankery. The only dis-
coverable glimmer of humor about the lament-
able exhibition lay in the wearing by one
young man of an ass’s head, unintentionally
emblematic of the litigating public. All else
was of such pathetic w ..odenness that The Bul-
letin, by way of extracting some fun from the
function, is prepared next year to contribute a
“ fiver” or so towards the cost of engaging a con-
tingent of, say, the Balmain “Liver Push” to
“deal it out” to these dreary processionists on
their way to the University, and so stir things up
a bit. The dry bones would have to live then with
a vengeance!
However appropriate a jovial kicking-over-the-
traces of ordinary life might be to young fellows
of Bohemian kidney—free, joyous souls who were
justified of themselves with song or story—lyre, or
brush, or chisel—such attempts at high-jinks sib
piteously ill upon the utterly prosy, unoriginal
young prigs whose distinction in life is plain, hard
“ oof’’-grinding—grasping with both hands after
the sordid, unromantic dollar! “The elephant
hath joints—but none for friskery ! ”

“ Silas S.”: le the hallucinations of the
perishing. Droon had been missing for several
days when we discovered him. Search parties
had been out from Morwell, and he was given up
as a cadaver when we went along the side of a
Gippsland gorge, hunting for an alleged coal out-
crop. At a certain point Coleman, the tired man
Of our small party, drew us back on our tracks
with wild yells and extravagant pantomime.
Coleman was pointing at the hollow trunk of a
great white gum, and sitting in that retreat,
staring at us out of the shadow with what looked
like enormous feline eyes, was a gaunt, hollow-
cheeked pallid wretch. “Good God! what’re
you doin’ there, man?” said Sandy. The man’s
lips moved, and a dry, parrot-like voice said :
“ Can’t get out ! ” “ Rot! ” said Coleman, grow-
ing bolder, “come out,” and he thrust in his hand
and seized Droon. “ How can I get out through
that little crack ?” “ Why, the way you got in.”
“But I was a little feller when I came in,”
croaked Droon, “an* I’ve swelled since—swelled
enormous. Look at me.” Droon was about
thin enough to have been plaited through a
picket-fence, and the opening in the butt was big
enough for a bullock to have bunked in. We
dragged him forth to his immense amazement and
he was packed off to hospital. According to
Droon’s own belief, he had been sitting in that
hollow for three days, growing bigger every
minute, and watching the tree close in around
him.

“Track”: Travelling cm N.S.W. South
coast, struck a settler’s house about dinner-time,
and was invited to “ have a bit.” While the meal
was progressing, I heard a grunt behind, and a
2cwt. pig reared himself upon his hind-legs and
almost put his forefeet into my plate. The per-
formance was repeated three times, but the old
woman told me not to mind him, as he was a pet,
and it was “only his thricks he was up to.”

“ Ben S.” asks a question ;
How is it that the comfortable eockies in populous dis-
tricts are mostly British, Irish, or European of some
sort, while the hand-to-mouth stragglers in the back-
blocks are mostly Australian ? Does it show that the
former got there first and are long-livers (which isn’t
conclusive, because the Australian has had time to come
along), or that they are better hustlers on small holdings ?
Or is it because the latter are less provident, or because
they love the lonesome? Or is it that the Australee
woman, more than the imported Jane and Bridget, sighs
for the sewing-machine, and the baker’s loaf, and the
dressmaker, and the slavey, and other correlatives of
competence, and by dabbling in them too soon helps the
rising tide of competition to drift her and hers to the
outer rim ? Is it want of elbow-room, or love of adven-
ture, or independence of spirit, that will plough the sun-
cracked ‘'Never-Never,” and live on kangaroo and
possum rather than rent a farm from any “ blanky land-
king?"
THE SAMOAN SITUATION AND SOLUTION,
J. B.: “I think, Sam, we could manage him better if we out him up amongst us. You know, the
good book says; 'Blessed is the piece-maker, '”
The casualness of Australian children was
well exemplified by the two boys (7 and 5) recently
lost for 42 hours on Borumbil. Started out on a
Wednesday rabbiting with a dog, a half-axe, and
a bag for the game. As they did not turn up at
night, half the country side went out to look for
them next day, but it wasn’t till Friday that they
were picked up along the river—quite cool and
unconcerned. They had gone on with their hunt-
ing, and had three rabbits in the bag. When
asked what had become of the dog—“ Oh, a snake
bit him and he croaked ! ” Same day they had
opened the public gate along the road for the
mail, but had made no moan. Had previously
struck a carrier asleep in his waggon, but didn’t
wake him to ask their way.

“ Old Burketown ” on aboriginal married
life: —
An Australian aborigine considers that his wives are
his private property, to cherish, punish, or even kill at
his pleasure, and, as a mark of esteem, he will send his
favorite wife for a time to reside in the gunyah of one
who has greatly distinguished himself. When visitors
from other tribes arrive, temporary wives are sent to
their camping place, and so strongly fixed is this
“ society ” custom that some of the early white travellers
have had great difficulty in declining the compliment
without giving offence. Black couples, despite the
rigorous mode of correction resorted to hv the husband,
often live long and happily together. The women are
forgiving, and believe that if their husbands do not well
and frequently heat them it is a sign of indifference.
Married women in some tribes (like the great Dieyeri)
have sweethearts or paramours (Pirra-ooroo) allowed to
them as a tribal custom. But in all Australian tribes a
woman who, outside of her tribe's regulations, violates
marital fidelity is severely dealt with. Usually either
speared through the thigh, or led to the front of her own
gunyah and speared through the foot into the ground.
In cases where husband is unreasonably and too fre-
quently severe upon wife the woman sometimes seeks the
protection of another man, who, if so inclined,
will fight the husband to decide whether or not
the new arrangement is to be permanent. Girls
are married and allotted mostly before 12 years of
age, being then virtually women. When a young titan,
having completed his initiation into manhood, happens
to possess sisters who (through death of father and
father’s brother) are under his control, he can exchange
these with some other guardian for other young women.
A man may in this way become possessed of many wives.
Also, he may inherit them by the death of his brothers,
whose wives become his. But perhaps the strangest (and
wisest) of all strange customs is the universal Australian
one that no married blackfellow must hold any com-
munication whatever with his mother-in-law.

“D. 8.” on a way back malady :
Inland and away from the mountains prevails the
malady familiar to bushmen as “ Barcoo vomit.” Sytnp-
toms—sudden abnormal flow of saliva, followed by violent
retching immediately after a meal. The keener the
appetite, the worse the retching. Also, the young and
robust are most subject to it. Most prevalent in good
seasons, when grass is green and flies abundant. Have
never known case of it in winter. Country doctors
ascribe it to indigestion ; to too much meat; to too little;
to lack of vegetables; to had water, flies, over-heating,
etc. Shearers also have varying explanations, the most
favored of which lays the blame on that “blanky
poisoner”—the cook. Vast quantities of patent medi-
cines are consumed to combat, the affection, but, as far
as I know, without benefit. Any Bulletinite know of a
remedy?

“ Yar ” ; Dingley was a terrible old cur-
mudgeon. Nothing but salt-junk, spuds, and
treacle week-in, week-out ; but we got home on
him at last. Yarded three wild colts one morn-
ing, and, when Dingley got into the yard to try
his hand with the rope, the colts charged the slip-
rails together. Big smash ! The three rails splin-
tered and sent flying among a flock of turkeys 20
yards off. Casualties six, and we ate poultry for
days.

“ Baktrax ” : At least one variety of Aus-
tralian frog is a cannibal. He is an olive-green
pirate with an alligatorish head, possesses teeth,
and lives in the Gulf country. When the mis-
sionary is a large one, the swallowing trick is an
interesting spectacle, as, in consequence of the
power of distending their bodies, common to all
frogs, the dinner often appears bigger than the
diner.

“W.M.F.” : Two of us rode out to get
ration-sheep. Sighting the mob, we sent dog to
bring it. As he was good dog, took no further
notice. The sheep were a long while putting in
appearance. Looked over and saw dog splitting
mob into twos and threes, and chasing them about
for amusement. Called him up and slapped his
ears. Sent him away again. He then got behind
sheep, and raced them clean out of sight. Called
him back and talked to him with the double of a
saddle-strap. Sent him after the sheep third time,
and he brought them back in real workmanlike
style. Instinct or reason—which ?

“ Scotty ” : Ever since the stations stopped

“You bailiffs mean to make the stations pay.”

The pay of these “bums,” where it used to be
.£3OO to £5OO a year, is now £7O to £l5O. They
have to come into town, now, to loaf on the
doctors and lawyers, when formerly the reverse
was the case. And it’s now tennis, debating-
societies and cheap sports, instead of “ Fill ’em

now dirty buggies, dirty harness, and dirty

“Ken.” : I know a sheep-dog that has
taken out a flock of sheep for years. He is the
shepherd, and sits all day on the stone wall, or
on a log or high ground. If the boss wants the

know the dog, and are nob afraid of him, rather
like him and obey him.

In Westralia the law doesn’t actually com-
pel the nigger to apprentice himself for many
years at about nothing a year to the squatter who
flogs him for the good of his soul. But it runs him
in for vagrancy—for sleeping out in the bush, and
having no visible means of support except kanga-
roo and the like, for not having a stone house and
a bell-topper and a visiting-card—and gives him
six months. And it is explained to him that he
will go on getting six months fbr vagrancy unless
he gets a permanent address on the station of a
white boss and visible means of support there in
the shape of rations. But there is nothing com-
pulsory about the business.

The Queensland pastoralist who finds the
tick zone is harmful to his sales takes a few of the
treasures south as many miles as seem necessary.
Soon after his arrival in the locality ticks are dis-
covered, reported to the inspector, and the ob-
noxious tick-line goes south a few degrees. It is
an open secret, on the Downs at any rate, that
ticks have travelled over the N.S. W. boundary—in

at home in house; not a panel of original fence
stood; an old dray, broken down years before,
just off the track ; plough, etc., covered with rust;
disreputable magpie hopping around. I asked,
“ Do you know Murphy’s place, on the three-chain
road?” Cockie : “ Shu re, i very body knows it.”
“Where is it, then?” Cockie: “ Shure, where

down the sloping bank into the water.

“Dolly E.” : Near our Blue Mountain

aboriginal markings in red, white, and black. I
noticed that the blacks who used occasionally to
come our way never failed to visit this cave, in
which, 10ft. from the ground, a narrow shelf of
rock projected about 3ft. for nearly the full length
of the cave. I had often tried to reach this shelf,-
but failed ; but, grown bigger, I one day after
many attempts succeeded and found on the ledge
a small bundle tied up in bark and covered with
dust. I took it up and shook it, when out dropped
a little yellow skull and some yellow, mouldy
bones. I promptly dropped the bundle and was
down from that shelf in a twinkling, and never
went kick to what was in reality an aboriginal
sepulchre.

A likeness of John Reay Watson, author
of “In a Man’s Mind,” is printed herewith. Mr.
Watson is known to Bulletin readers as author
of several excellent short stories, and his first
essay in literary criticism appears on i he Red Page
of this issue. Mr. Watson whose new.book—“An
Earthly Fulfilment ’—has just been published in
London, is a young Australian, born at Tinonee,
Manning River, N.S.W., 23rdMMfr,' r , 1872. Aus-
tralia celebrates the event of the 24th of the month
—a mistake that will some day have to receive
attention. Both Mr. Watson’s parents were
Scotch ; but his mother, from whom he inherits
his literary instincts, came here at a very early
age, and her memories were wholly Australian.
The young Watson was soon taken to Queensland,
and has ever since been a resident of that province.
The genesis of his ambition to write a book was
early dated, but his present ambition is to
write a good one. Meredith, Henry James, and a
few of the younger men, define the limits of his
reading. “ Writing,” says Mr. Watson, “is
hard work —with fascinating compensations.”
Some time back, an insane boomer (once
a well-known auctioneer), now in Yarra Bend
asylum, prepared elaborate plans of that place,
mounted the stump, and sold the lots, taking long
bills. The price beat boom-time. A big row is
now brewing—the ratty buyers want possession.

•‘Waikato”: W.A. Government's pro-

of'rabbits recalls a M.L. incident in the early
days of the local rabbit plague. A squatter,
having advertised that he was a buyer of cats in
quantity, a daily procession of juveniles used to
arrive witli bags, the feline occupants whereof
were duly freed in the surrounding hills. Finding
that the cat-supply did not diminish, however,
the squatter investigated, and found that, after
enjoying temporary change of air in the uplands,
the cats duly went home and were re-sold to him
again and again. In fact, a regular industry in
“ homing cats ” had arisen.

Throughout Victoria the
presence of she-oak is an
almost unfailing indica-

The rich gullies of Ben-

days were all covered
with she-oak. Ironbark,
too, has a partiality for

much more to be depend-

At the recent “ electrocution ” of a mur-

that the leg and the electrode were covered.” Then

“At Brokenhillionaire Kelly’s birthday-
party, the other night (says the Argus), Mr. Neale
Wigg, chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Co.,
entertained the guests by recounting reminiscences
of the early difficulties of the promoters. Aparty
of them, he said, were gathered one hot summer’s
night in a room in Menzies’ Hotel, abutting on
Bourke-street, discussing their prospects, and the
conversation turned on the millions which they
saw before them. When a momentary lull came
in the discussion, the silence was broken by a
deep, husky voice at the open window with the
words, ‘ I say, boss, for the love of Heaven, chuck
us one o’ them millions. I can do with a bit.’ ”
W.A. Chief Justice Onslow recently
passed through Sydney on his way to M.L.
He it was who, at the trial of Anderson for
flogging several aboriginal girls to death, said :
“ The jury have found you guilty of man-
slaughter. I cannot agree with their verdict. It
was a cruel, wanton murder. You with your
brother, after having captured these unfortunate
blacks, actually went into your homestead, had
dinner, and then came out to flog these creatures
to death. When you became tired of flogging,
your brother took up the murderous task, and
when you had had a spell you began again. . . .
I never, in the oourse of my experience, have
heard of such a case, and I pray God that I never
will again.” He then gave accused life imprison-
ment as “a warning to his class in the nor’-west
who treat human beings worse than cattle ”

The complexities of Yic. postal service are
endless. Attention is now drawn to the fact that
a boy entering the telegraph service as messenger
receives .£24 a year, and that if he lives to be a
hairy old patriarch, he’ll never get any more.
Formerly, boys could join the service in the sure
and certain hope that by the time they reached
senility they would be earning £6O a year. But
that Elysian state of things is past. There are,
however, 398 boys who, having entered the service
under the former happy conditions, enjoy the
maximum of £OO, and the growl is that they don’t
do any more work than those who have to
struggle along at £24. The Anomalies Board
has got hold of the conundrum by the tail. But
as yet it hasn’t managed to work out whether
it is a v\ hite elephant or a Paradoxus Duffyii.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

Poor old London Figaro is dead—really
dead at last. It was a light and bright weekly a
quarter of a century ago, as compared with its
dull and heavy rivals, and under the editorship of
James Mortimer it flourished for ten years or
more. Then he lost his grip of the reins, and the
original staff retired with him, and Figaro came
out in a succession of “ new forms,” more or less
readable or foolish. Some months ago Mor-
timer got hold of the paper again (what was left
of it), and collected the remnants of the original
staff, with the hope of being able to make Figaro
boom once more. A pathetic, ghostly enterprise.
The new generation knew not Mortimer, “ Cheru-
bino,” “ 0. P. Q. Philander Smiff,” and the other
revived identities whose pens were light in the
early 70s. Popular taste in light, bright, jour-
nalism had changed, and the old readers were either
dead or indifferent to poor Mortimer’s appeal for
renewed patronage. Figaro’s attempt to live on
the original lines failed miserably, it seems, and a
few grey-haired mourners have lost a hopeless job.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
27 of this issue.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Q. Worker has dropped its much-dis-
cussed “ Socialism in our time ” motto.
Two recent appointments by the Boodle-
wraith were so hideously smellful that even the
sycophantic Courter mildly requests them not to
break it too suddenly to the long-suffering Mon-
golian.
Some anomalies : In N.S.W. women may
vote for aldermen in municipalities but not for an
M.L.A. in their division ; male lodgers may vote
for an M.L.A. but not for aldermen. Again,
uncertificated insolvents can sit as M’sL.A. but
not as aldermen.
One of the most humorous arguments used
by the belated anti-Federalists in Q. is that “ all
their customs and postal revenues will be swal-
lowed up by the hungry Federal Parliament.”
Considering that the Q. postal-service is con-
ducted at an annual loss of about .£75,000 !
The Queensland “Yes-No” Premier
Dickson. Should a majority in the Mongrelian
Assembly declare for Federation- as seems pro-
bable—Dickson will sacrifice his last hair for Aus-
tralian unity. If not, he will weep—and wait.
Everything by turns, and nothing longer than it
pays.
An amazing feature of the recent Queens-
land general elections was Brisbane Courier’s
dread of the Socialistic bogey it declared to be
looming large behind the Labor-Opposition party
and its utter inability to see the scaly horror of
the leprosy-fiend that stalled in front of its own
gang.
• ie P resen t S.A. general election, accord-
ing to S. A. Tories, was to witness the triumphant
return of Kingston’s old enemy, Symon, Q.C., to
S.A. Assembly—to be followed by other dire con-
sequences. Symon, however, jibbed at the last
moment, and went to England on a long holiday
OFF THE FENCE AT LAST.
during the week preceding Kingston’s policy-
speech.
Darling Downs farmers are against Federa-
tion because somebody has told them Queensland
will have to contribute J>500,000 per annum
towards supporting a Federal Parliament, com-
posed of t’othersiders, who will, in return, pick
Queensland’s pocket. The Downs farmer is
mostly a German, and, having got one idea into
his head, has no room left for anything else.
Henry Copeland’s N.S.W. Sunday Trading
Bill trailed so over open ground that enemies
were easily able to jump on it. Instead of strag-
gling over Good Friday, Xmas Day, co-operative
societies, compulsory regulation of clubs and other
questions, if he had put to the House a Bill with
one issue—open or not on Sunday afternoon and
evening his measure might have danced to
victory.
Sydney Sunday Times alludes rather cir-
cumspectly to the fact that the N.S.W. Anti-
Convention Bill League is ignoring the assistance
of members of Assembly in fighting against the
Federal Enabling Bill. As the League’s main
supports are the Tory M’sL.C. and others of their
kidney, and as the Parliamentary party is mainly
the Labor-party, the dislike is more than probably
mutual.
“ C.C.8.” : America is becoming supreme
in the iron-trade. Yankee locomotives ordered
for India, and even for English railways. America
gets the latest big Yic. contract for steel rails ;
also, the huge W.A. contract for steel pipes. And
she absolutely knocks out all N.S.W.’s show in
the agricultural-machinery business. A Yankee
firm ships reapers and binders right through from
the U.S. to way-back in N.S.W. without unpack-
ing, dumps them down in front of the cocky, and
sells them to him on a two-years’ bill. Wanted
Federation and a strong Protective tariff to make
Yankeelanders set up factories at or near Sydney.
“X”: The most serious aspect of the
delegation of Australian defence to Imperial
officers, is that in a time of extremity they wowJd
have the decision as to which parts of the
“Empire” should be abandoned to fate.
Alleged-Australasian-Admiral Pearson might
very easily decide, if he had a discretion,
that the defence of Australasia was hope-
less, and he would add his forces to the de-
fence, say, of India, or the Cape. Austra-
lasia is, undoubtedly, an important base of
operations, as testified by Capt. Mahan,
and his disciple, H. W. Wilson—but the
glamor of “saving ” India would count for
much in a big w’ar, even if it were at the
cost of deserting Australia. Few admirals
would be able to resist the temptation.
Furthermore, there might come explicit
orders from the boss of the Navy to let
Australia go hang. To an Australian such
orders would be idle wind, but with an
“Imperial officer” the case would be far
different.
Q. Govt, is good to its friends. The Crown
Proseeutorship, lately vacated by Attorney-
General Rutledge, has been handed to barrister
Kingsbury—a legal neophyte rejected by Brisbane
N. at the ’96 elections. Kingsbury was admitted
to the bar in ’94 and has fed sumptuously on Govt,
briefs ever since. His appointment, over the heads
of abler, more experienced and more deserving
men, is an 18-carat job.
Rumored that Hugh Nelson, the moth-
eaten Q. Tory-Premier who jumped the Leg.
Council Presidency on the death of Arthur
Palmer, is organising the ancients in the House
of Decay to solidly oppose every step towards
1 ederation. But the high priest of “Let it rip ”
and “Never mind” is not likely to be long toler-
ated as a piece of wreckage in the path leading to
Australian Nationhood.
The fixing of the salary of the Australian
Commonwealth’s Chief Justice (an office which
“ Toby ” Barton is daily twitted with ambitioning)
should, be, preceded by a general revision of the
States’ C.’s-J. At present they are remarkable
for an apparent haphazard want of proportion.
Darley draws <£3500, Way £2OOO, Griffith £3500
Onslow £l7OO and Madden £3500. If Onslow and
Way be levered up, the Federal C.-J. will probably
claim £5OOO ; but if the States’ C.-J. be revised to
a uniform £2OOO, the Federal C.-J. would probably
be content with £3OOO. The salary of the Federal
C.-J. will certainly be fixed in the light of the
salaries paid to the minor C.’s-J. and these latter
should, therefore, be subjected to revision by the
States as soon as the Commonwealth Bill passes.

exemplified
when the
new batch
of members,
put in to
waken u p
the fossils,
was being
sworn - in.
One of them
—a pretty
wide-awake
person at
most times
—began to
nod on en-
tering, and,
after gazing
fixedly a t
his commis-
si o n as
though it
were the
pedigree of
a stud sheep,
he signed
his name,
and at once betook himself to a back bench and
dropped into a sound sleep, from which he didn’t
awake till closing-time.
Now; that the Federal Enabling Bill has
passed in N.S.W., every one entitled to an elec-
tor’s right should get one, and every holder of a
right should use it for or against when the Bill
goes to the people. At a time when the political
constitution of the continent will no doubt be
changed, a man who will not vote Yes or No is
not fit to be a citizen. It is a pity Parliament did
not make voting at the referendum compulsory
under a stiff penalty.
The N.S.W. Federal referendum is de-
finitely settled for June, probably about the 2Lst.
As Jack Want cannot possibly land in Sydney
under six weeks, if he comes at all, it will be
necessary to find another leader. The choice
seems to lie between Jonhaynes, Heydon, John
Norton, and G. Pile’s Dog—or perhaps it will be
John Norton’s wicked little pup, Barney. Kohen
with a “K.,” seems to have given it up; and
Dibbs can t sacrifice <£l3oo a year.
Round about Nambour (S.Q.), there is a
beautiful little object-lesson in full swing. Scores
and scores of farmers (all European) are engaged
m the sugar-industry ; nearly all doing fairly well,
and (mircthilc dictu) they hardly employ a solitary
kanaka, Hindoo or Syrian among them. And a
few score miles away stands the Bananaland Par-
liament House, where ancient imbeciles have the
audacity to spout, night after night, on the im-
possibility of “raising sugar profitably without
cheap alien labor.”
Queensland is just now making a fuss
about a University scheme to cap its Grammar-
school system. Out in the West, Bananaland has
hundreds of white youngsters running about
almost wild, totally unwitting of school and
schoolmaster, often ignorant of the meaning of
the words morality and decency. Surely the
needs of these children should be considered
before a penny is spent on University frills. An
area of 78,000 sq. miles in W.Q. exists wherein
there stands not one solitary schoolhouse.
Q. Govt, is preparing to push on the
building of the last link (Gladstone-Rockhamp-
ton) of the line connecting the Brisbane and the
Fitzroy. Had this been done six years ago the
province would have spared many thousands use-
“GOOD BUSINESS."
lessly expended in connecting Rockhampton with
a coastal port that didn’t exist, and in building a
terrifically expensive wharf where there wasn’t

connection is complete, and all the log-rolling in
the world can’t stop it.
general election, is recognised as leader of the Q.
anti-Federalists.. On the other side, Chief-Justice
Sam. Griffith is president of the Federation
League.
Denny, R.C. capitation-grant candidate,
is tipped in some quarters to head the poll at
West Adelaide to-day (Saturday), leaving* Premier
Kingston and Labor-leader Batchelor to fight for
the other seat. The bitterness of the struggle is
increased by the open quarrel between R.C. Arch-
bishop O Reily and the Laborists. But, even
should Denny be elected, the Roman Catholics (or
any other sect) will never get a denominational-
education capitation-grant from S.A. Treasury.
The moon will turn into green cheese first.
Ex-Agent-General Playford, contesting a
Tory country constituency, wobbles badly on the
Household Suffrage question—the main plank in
the Kingston programme. Playford opposes
broadening the franchise, then suggests alterations
tending to double the number of Council voters,
and concludes by suggesting postponement until
after Federation.” Poor old “ Honest Tom ”is
a political enigma. At heart, a hardshell Tory,
he has been either Premier or a member of every
Democratic Ministry in S.A. during the last 10
years.
Times have changed, and now things have
begun to go all wrong for Sydney Daily Tele-
graph. They first published that Premier Reid
would not dare to swamp N.S.W. Upper House;
then that the Lieut.-Governor would not sanction
the appointments ; then they were confident that
the people would resent the appointing of so large
a number as 12; then that 12 was not enough.
Finally, they were sure that the Council would
never back-down—only to be left as usual. And
when the referendum comes, the Telegraph witt
be sadder than ever.
Canvassing is being resorted-to to pave the
way among N.S.W. M.’sL.A. for a substantial
increase to Chairman M‘Court’s salary on account
of that official’s having so often of late filled
Speaker Abbott’s place. If Mr. M‘Court does extra
work pay is certainly earned, but the way in
which Speaker Abbott (whose health, unfor-
tunately, is very bad), has treated this office for
several sessions past should make it necessary to
have the future better defined. The employment
of Mr. M'Court in lieu of Speaker Abbott means
the employment of a roster of temporary chair-
men in lieu of Chairman M‘Court, all of whom,
on analogous grounds, have a right to hold out
hands on pay-day.
A grotesque creature is the N.S.W.
Protectionist who shouts down the Federal
Bill because, through the Braddon clause,
custom-taxed commodities will be increased
m price. “Thirty shillings,” he yells, “ will
not go as far as J2l goes now.” Every in-
telligent Protectionist has met and slain that
dragon at the entrance of his fiscal path.
Ihe Australian is getting too poor to
be born nowadays. As late as ’9l the Seven
Provinces had 128,000 births for the year, but
in ’9B, with 667,000 more population, the
births were only 117,000! The deaths in-
Txrif Sf -the births diminished.
What is it—poverty, depression, loss of the
habit of getting married, boot-trunk, or what?
The Victorian Customs seems to have
been encouraging, “unbeknownst” to the
public, the influx of Chinese to the province
by allowing the already-settled Chow to im-
port his children from China. The Chinkies
have been importing juveniles in droves, and
it did not occur to officialdom that it was
blundering until a pagan whose papers showed
he had been in the country 10 years asked to
be allowed to bring out his little boy of seven.
Then the office went into arithmetic, and
resolved to turn off the baby Chow at the
main.
At time of writing, N.S.W.' ex-At-
torney-General Jack Want’s friends are not
pleased with him. Most people believe that
his resignation was brought about by Cab-
bage-tree disapproval of the Federal Bill, but
Jack has not said so. He does not cable his
friends : “ I resign, and come to help you in
the fight ”; or even, “I am too ill to come
and help you ; but my heart is with you in
the battle.” Jack lies low, and remains a
sealed oyster up to date of this. Also, Pre-
mier Reid says King Cabbage-tree has made
a £30,000 or ,£40,000 dab in aQ. inine-spee.—
though it’s alleged that mine and money be-
long to his sister, and Jack only gets some
thousands commission.
Robert Fraser, ex-member for Brisbane
North, who was so badly squelched at the late
A “PUSH" OPINION.—A COWARDLY
COPPER.
BUFFER BILL : "That trap keeps foilerin’ us round
everywhere.”
JIM THE TURNIP : “Fees, the sneakin’ ’ound, just
becos there’s only two of us. If we ’ad the
old push ’ of twenty blokes ’e’d be afride —the
bloomin’ cur.”
“Alia”: When M‘Farlane, M.P., made
the statement that the N.S.W. sugar-districts
were likely to vote anti-Bill at the referendum,
the wish was evidently the father of the thought.
“We are not sugar-growers all” in these dis-
tricts, however; and lots of the sugar-growers
have sense and patriotism enough to view the
question outside the rails of their cane-patches.
M'Farlane has been a consistent opponent of the
Bill all through the piece, so he cannot be taken
as speaking without prejudice. Ask Ewing,
M.L.A., what Lismore will do.
THE JACKAL IN THE PATH.
. At the head of the cross-benches sat Mr. Lyne, wait-
ing, Micawber-like, for something to turn up.”— Syd/ne g
.Telegraph leading article, April 12.
At the head of the cross-benches sat William John,
And his pose was suggestive of hoffis ;
He was waiting for something to turn up anon,
And you bet that this something was hoffis !
He s the purest of patriots, William John Lyne,
For his voice never raises the old-fashioned whine:
Let “My country !’’ go hang—if it means he shall pine
For hoffis ! sweet hoffis ! paid hoffis !
And the glare in the eye of the said William J.
Lit lurid ambitions of hoffis :
And you felt that Bill John, if he ever did pray,
Must pray most devoutly for hoffis !
His troubles ! the fate of the Federal Bill,
With a nearer and dearer Bill waiting his fill;
So down with Australia—you can if 3 7 0 u will
And shove Long Bill Lyne into hoffis !

“The White Man’s Burden’’
Has during the last decade been
considerably lightened by the
advent of the Pneumatic Tyred
Safety Bicycle. It was the ad-
vent of
Duniqp Tyres'
i
in 1888 that first brought the
advantages and possibilities of
the cycle before the public. The
adoption of detachable Dunlops
in ’92 further popularised cycling,
and brought it within the reach
of all ; and now the culminating
point is reached by our placing
on the market the nearest ap-
proach to a Perfect Cycle Tyre
ever attained. The new tyres
will be known as the
MULTIFLEX
Dunlqp Tyres v
and will be speedily recognised
by all Australian cyclists as
a necessity, when Com-
fort, Speed, Reliability,
and Ease of Attachment
are the desiderata.
First in 1888.
Foremost ever since.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden,
And issued a tyre so strong,
That in future the new Multiflex
Dunlops
Will carry all cyclists along.
No need for further anxieties,
All cyclists can ride on in peace ;
The new Multiflex tyres are beauties,
Guaranteed to ensure comfort and
ease.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden,
In helping the mighty throng
Of cyclists who wheel o’er Australia
In the delights of wheeling along,
Safe on their Multiflex Dunlops,
To accomplish by deeds on the wheel
The art of seeing the country
By means of the Dunlop wheel.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden
By giving a tyre that will stand,
To those cyclists who ride for plea-
sure —
Those of the happy band ;
So that the roughest of roads have
no terrors,
Nor the puncture-fiend the power to
detract,
From the pleasures derived from
wheeling
Way back on the Old coach track.

The Sydney St. George’s Rifles com-
memorated St. George’s _ Day with much en-

of the junketings it doesn’t appear that one word
of sympathy was expressed during the proceedings
for Lieut.-Colonel Neild, commander of the regi-
ment, now under “open arrest” for alleged
insubordination.
The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from this
vigorously-conducted Mutual Society. The circumstance,
therefore, that the figures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its
success bv deserving it, and, that much being conceded,
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
falfen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Melb. Eight-Hours’ people showed marvellous
ability in drawing up a programme in the worst possible
way. On Saturday last there was not a single cycle final
run during the afternoon, and people were invited to sit
down and watch four hours of preliminary events. Even
the three appearances of Bilmartin were insufficient to
atone for the tedium, though all Bill’s races were run in
that old warrior’s pluggiest style.
Bill had passed the post first three times, and
had two places to his credit when he came in for the final
of the half-mile handicap in the night. The smash oc-
curred ai thj-turn where all the smashes occur, the colli-
sion of Corbett and Crowell being the reason of Bill’s
bump against the wire fence. Bill says there was a con-
spiracy to block him out of all the races, and certainly
some of the afternoon events bore that appearance. Any-
how, it was his call for an opening which led to a swerve
in front and the subsequent smash.
* * • •
Bill’s three broken ribs will soon mend. If
there were a stake worth the while on the board next
Saturday, those ribs could be glued sufficiently to satisfy
their owner. But the doctors fear something inside has
been touched, for the Plugger’s breathing is suspiciously
heavy and difficult'. The hope of all Australia is that the
lungs of the junky, plucky Yank have escaped, and that
next season will open to him catching the field on his own
as in the days of old.
• * * *
The Eight Hours’ Wheel Race itself fell to
Wiloock, the South Australian lad, who has been scoring
splendidly of late. The smash of Martin, and the weak-
ness of Walne’s eyes, left Body, Barker, and Jackson to
fill the places of the 10-inile, and the public wandered
out disappointed that they had not been accorded such
another bri'liant battle as when Martin and M’Donald
rode a dead-heat after five miles of hot pace earlier in the
week.
* • • * /
Newhaven’s easy winning of the important City
and Sub. Handicap, with top weight, or thereabouts, on
his SJ-.vear-old back, puts Australian “ form ” very nearly
on a level with the best they can produce in England,
where Derby heroes are confined as a rule to w.f.a. races.
Within the next three months we may find the son of
Newminster (who is much more Australian-bred than
Sup ivor, the runner-up in last week’s event) pitted
against some of the classic “cracks,” and then the
Anglo-Australian gee-gee question will be practically
settled for the present. Newhaven, judging from
the fact that he gave Survivor 191 b and a beating,
is now the same animal (improved by age) that ran
away with the Melbourne Derby and Cup. He represents
Australian form of the highest grade, not necessarily
phenomenal, for they were not great horses that New-
haven donkey-licked in ’96, but undoubtedly first-class
“form.” If he can land one or more of the richest
English w.f a. stakes thisseason, real Australian thorough-
bred horseflesh, i.e., the flesh born of Australian-born
parents, will improve its market value. From an A.N.A.
point of view, the successes of a Newhaven (by New-
minster) and a Merman (by Grand Flaneur) are more
satisfactory than the news that Trenton and Carbine are
getting good stock in the land where their father was
born. Trenton and Carbine, by the way, were not even
Australian-bred. They came to light in Maoriland.
• * » •
“ H.S.”: That Carbine gave Highborn 531 b. and
a beating in Melb. Cup during the same season that High-
born won Sydney Cup, carrying 9st., does not prove that
when both horses were fit and well Carbine was anything
like 531 b., or even 331 b., better than Highborn. [The
Bulletin never said it did. But it certainly suggests
that Carbine was a better performer than Bobadil, which
was the matter under consideration in the par. of April
15. Maybe Highborn’s chance was discounted by the
fact that he carried a small boy, the inevitable disad-
vantage of a light-weight.]

It is an open secret that the “Colonial Con-
sultation ” crowd sought to obtain from Tas. Govt, per-
mission to conduct a sweep at Hobart, but failed ; and it
is pretty well understood that the Raspberry Land autho-
rities don’t mean to license anybody except “Tatt.”
Adams. The pronouncement is: “One sweep is quite
enough—we don’t propose to turn the island into a Monte
Carlo.” So that the one hope of the virtuous crowd
which is now adroitly attacking Adams in all sorts of
underhand ways, with a view to promoting a big opposi-
tion consultation-concern with a prominent bookmaker
at its head, is to get a license at Brisbane.
* * * •
The two chief events (Goodwood Handicap and
Adelaide Cup) of S.A.J.C. meeting, which begins May 6th,
look fairly good for Diffidence, with her re-handicapped
weights of 8.9 and 8.7 respectively, but it must be re-
membered that the “ pony-wonder ” has had a rare
“bucketing” of late, and maybe Alix will represent the
stable in the just-mentioned race, for which she must
have a good chance. Wild Olive, Veloce and Barleycorn
also appear well-treated. In the Cup, Le Var. Flintlock,
Dreamland and Dearix have prospects, provided Diffidence
is not at her very best.
• • » *
There were a couple of “ Tatt.” sweeps on Can-
terbury (Sydney) Cup on Saturday, a special and an
ordinary, but, from all accounts, sweep-money is not
quite so plentiful for owners as it used to be. Dr. Bow-
ker’s Beiwood was a hot favorite, but he went down
before the Lochiel mare, Blanche Florence, who started
at 10 to 1.

The attention of Australians will be particu-

the performances of Survivor, The Grafter, Reso-
lute and co. be eagerly followed, but also those of
Carbine and Trenton’s ’ two-year-old stock, whilst R.
Lewis and W. Delaney, two of the best of our horsemen,
will pit their prowess against Yankee Tod Sloan and the
English cracks. In swimming, F. Lane will take on the
best of the ’Ome performers ; and last, but certainly not
least, the possession of the “ashes” will be stubbornly
contested by the strong team that now guards them.

Bendigo magistrates, including the P.M., see
the absurdity of the dictum that Ikey Mo on a box is a
person to be Put Down, while Ikey Mo off a box is a
person to be patronised. Several Ikeys got on hat-boxes,
&c., at recent goldfields sports; but when the police
proved only one transaction per case the P.M. rushed for
that way-out, and dodged the box dictum by holding
that at least two wagers must be proved in order to sus-
tain a charge of “ using a place ” for betting.

At Maitland Show, there were 15 competitors
for the £3O high-jump, eventually won by the Parramatta
horse, Sunshine, who cleared 6ft. lJ4' n - (in a failing light),
with 13st. 81bs. up 1 ’Frisco, the Sydney runner-up, and
the two Gunnedah greys, Rattler and" Quondong, each
cleared 6ft. The water-jump was taken by Crackshot,
with 25ft. 9in. Pippo, the lively little chestnut, ridden by
clever McGee, was second with 23ft. 6in. Thelma, the
Sydney winner, refused to jump, capsizing her rider at
third attempt. Mexican Ashton, better known as
“ Warrigal Bill,” won the buck-jumping contest against
five others. All the horses ridden left nothing to be
desired, as they simply bucked themselves for all they
were worth, especially the one ridden by Phoenix, son of
the lately-deceased pugilist “ Yellow Jimmy.” Phoenix’s
mount bucked continuously for 4£ minutes at one stretch.
Thiebaut, a noted Tamworth rider, who mounted his
horse bridle-less, was the only one unseated.

One trot at Bathurst (N.S.W.) show would
make a good bar-room Yankee caricature. Driver was
under weight, and carried a bag of stones to “ draw the
scales.” When in the lead the ballast shifted, and the
driver was in trouble trying to hold it in with one hand
and drive with the other, but the strain was too great,
and the bag fell out, whereupon driver pulled up, hauled
it back into the sulky, and started in pursuit. Next
round string came untied from neck of bag, and the gib-
bers poured out on the track, amidst the jeers and cat-
calls of the crowd.

The loss of Capt. Clark in his yacht Queenie, in
Hobson’s Bay, is quite parallel to that of Capt. Coles, in
the ironclad Captain, of his design, in the British
Channel. Clark’s Queenie was nicknamed “The Coffin”
by Melb. yachtsmen, who considered her build dangerous.
Clark flouted them by going in her on every possible
occasion. Thus did Coles voyage in the Captain, on her
trial trip, when she turned turtle, and was lost with all
hands, about 220. She had cost the nation about a
quarter of a million. Childers, as head of the Admiralty,
had such faith in her that he sent his son, as an officer,
on th > trip, and he was drowned. Reed, the eminent
naval constructor, and other high authorities, had con-
demned the Captain as unsafe.

Rarely is such a rattling' contest seen in an 8-oar
race as that at St. Ignatius’ regatta, last Saturday, on
Lane Cove River. Three boats started, representing
Glebe, Sydney, and North Shore rowing clubs. Sydney
led for a part of the distance, but Glebe fairly rowed
them down, and won a magnificent race by a few yards.
* * * *
Sydney Alhambra A.C.’s 9st. novice boxing
tournament was continued and concluded Saturday
night. The second round supplied a gory battle —Poet
and Jones were the principals. How they did thump-
and smash each other for five rounds ! Blood smothered
their classic mugs, especially Poet’s, which received so
much attention that two teeth were shifted, while a third
was forced through the upper lip. The house yelled
again as the pair of pugs, alternately rushed in and reeled 1
back before a hail of blows. No gamer man than Poet
ever doffed a shirt. Both went through the stipulated
term, and, despite the tremendous punishment adminis-
tered, were still strong and fit to go. Jones got the-
decision on points, but Poet was not far behind. Read,
thought to have a cinch on the big end of the £3O prize-
money, went under in this round to Williams, who-
stepped into the ring looking more like a schoolboy of 17
than a candidate for the honors of pugdom. He wore
blue silk trunks, white shoes, and black socks, was of’
slight build, though well put together, had skin the color
of a girl’s, thin arms and a good-looking, youthful face.
The roped square was about the last place where Wil-
liams should have been, as far as appearances went, but
when he got into action a different aspect was placed l
upon the matter. Beneath that nancyfied exterior were-
bulldog grit and all the instincts of a born fighter. Wil-
liams met Jones in the final on Saturday night, and was:
declared winner after a very exciting and evenly con-
tested bout of eight rounds, during which not a single-
knock-down occurred, nor was a single drop of blood
spilt.

Veteran pug Abe Hicken would seem to have:
lagged superfluous, for his well-boomed benefit at Golden:
Gate A.O. (Sydney), last week, only drew 40 people all
told—deadheads included. Abe is a much-benefited man.
He had a couple in Sydney years ago, two or three ini
Melbourne, a similar number “down under” recently,
and went back to Melb. last Saturday for another “ fare-
well,” after which he goes Englandwards again, there to-
remain for good and aye. Pity to see the old-timer in
such straits, especially when one recalls that, not so many
years ago, a cheque of his for twenty thou, would have
been marked good. Abe told writer that when Chester'
was beaten for Sydney Derby he lost £lO,OOO, which
amount was laid to £Booo—both parties putting up their
money beforehand. Hicken has two sons—jockeys. One
n England, and doing well, lately sent his mother a draft
for £lOO.
* * * *
Says Abe Hicken : “Jem Mace, England’s last
prize-money champion, was, when I left London a few
months ago, running a paying pub. He is 68 years of
age, and has his fourth wife, by whom there are four
children—the eldest six years, and the youngest eight-
months.” Jem is pretty keen on business, and doesn’t-
allow friendship to affect him in that quarter. Abe paid
the old warrior a visit, and, while there, had to part up-
like an ordinary traveller—and Abe was none too well-
fixed.

After vainly trying for months to corner Yankee
Lucifer, N.S. Welshman Harry Cansdell, literally spoiling
for a go, took on Teuton Lorenz at Sydney Alhambra,
Friday night last, for the middleweight supremacy of the-
province, under French rules—miscalled Graeco-Roman.
Lorenz is somewhat of the weedy order, though fairly
well - developed about shoulders and arms. Cansdell
stood sturdy and hairy as a young bull—brown, too, as
tanned leather, and certainly much above middleweight.
On appearances, ’twas a guinea to a gooseberry in the
local champ.’s favor : but the German, wiry and wary, let
Cansdell do the graft and twist, turn, squeeze, wrenchi
and lift to his heart’s content, Lorenz being alert with a
“stop” for every hold, albeit watchful the while that
the hammer-lock or dreaded hug had no show. Twenty
minutes of this, then 10 minutes’ rest and a further 20
minutes of ’rastling without a fall, sort of filled onlookers
up. Several went home. Up to now Cansdell was
aggressor, but lacked activity, thus missing several
chanoes ; also, the severe strain sustained so long was
telling on him palpably. Fifteen minutes after third
bout started both went sprawling on the mat—Cansdell
under—a fair fall to Lorenz. Facing each other for the
fourth time, Cansdell looked badly used-up, while Lorenz
seemed fit for another hour or two, and went to work
prepared to take risks. Five minutes later the German
got a bear-like neck-grip on, and bore his man down amid
intense excitement, until latter, almost black in the face,
was forced over on to one shoulder and both hips. Second
fall, and the matoh (which called for first two out of three)
to Lorenz.
Writer came away satisfied that the winner is
nothing to rave about, whilst Cansdell, without a win to
his credit up to date (if memory serves), has gone off con-
siderably since Mons. Victor and Perryman beat him, and
he’rastled that all-night draw with Sam Matthews, nine
years ago. America and England are full of middle-
weights who could “lay over” both in one ring, and
think no great “ punkins ”of the job, either. The task
would have been an exercise-canter for M’Caffery, who
came to Sydney with “Buff” Costello, the pug., in the
eighties.

Sydney “ Rocks ” phenomenon Griffo, perhaps
the most marvellous boxer the world has seen, is now at
the end of his tether. From Chicago comes word that he
is what everybody on this side suspected long ago, a rav-
ing maniac, and will probably wind-up in a straight-
ja' ket. Commenting on the matter, N.Y. Journal says
Griffo was “ a villain of splendid physique and tireless
energy.” [Fancy the Griffo we knew being called a vil-
lain !] While in gaol he was put to work shovelling coal,
and was a happy man then. He could get no liquor in
prison, and regarded his term as a training period, of
which he took ample advantage. This sad termina-
tion to Griffo’s career will cause many a pang in the
hearts of those who knew him best. Few studied the
little champion more than the writer. Griffo’s nature
was all right. Environments were responsible for his
bad breaks—he had never been taught better.

Billy Barnes, the Nottingham cricketer who
died the other month, scored at least one record per-
formance in Australia. Some 12 years ago there was an
exciting match on Sydney ground between Shaw and
Shrewsbury’s team and N.S.W., the local men winning by
a few runs. The Britishers didn’t like it—they had
backed themselves to pull the game out of the fire—and
on the night of their discomfiture “ words ” arose in a
pub., with the result that Billy B. let out his left at one
of the victorious Cornstalks, missed him, and put his fist
through the panel of a swing door. A wonderful drive
for “ nowt.”

In this issue will be found portrait of the late
Edward James Gregory, the eldest of the great Sydney
cricketing family, the “Graces of Australia.” Outside
his cricketing capabilities, Ned, as he was familiarly and
lovingly called by the cricketing public in his younger
days, was a prominent member of a Sydney amateur
theatrical club, from which blossomed several actors who
have made their mark. Their meetings were held in an
old tin-covered building in the vicinity of Circular Quay,
a godsend for the Rocks push, who went to shower stones
on the iron roof whilst the acting was going on. In
1851 Gregory was a Fort-street schoolboy, and in that
year carried off the Sir Charles Nicholson prize. He was a
good elocutionist, with a remarkably retentive memory,
and at cricket and other gatherings Ned was always
one of the first to be called upon for a contribution. In
’67, N.S.W. started a run of losing games against Victoria,
and it was not till ’74 that she secured a victory, due
chiefly to the batting of Ned Gregory and Charley
Bannerman. In the ’75 match, with 7 wickets down for
21, Gregory scored 65 (not out) out of a total of 116, and
18 out of 102. But, perhaps, the item which will live
longest in Ned Gregory’s cricketing career was the part
he took in the historic single-wicket match in ’72, in
which the brothers Ned, Dave and Charley Gregory re-
presented N.S.W., and defeated Wills, Cosstick and
Conway, of Victoria, by 5 runs, after an exciting three
days’ contest.

“Saved!” “Has one aspect of the Sidney
Safe Deposit occurred to you? Most people insure
against loss by fire and receive money compensation for
property destroyed. But there are some things—valuable
papers, heirlooms, etc—which can never be replaced, and
the loss of which often means the loss of a fortune. The
Safe Deposit, for a comparatively small premium, not
only insures against the loss of these things, it saves the
articles themselves. What is a guinea or two a year com-
pared with a document upon which thousands depend ? ”
Safe Deposit is in Ash-st., back of Palings, off George-st.*
Dear Bulletin. The insurance - man
would like to tell his version of the “Daly”
story. Certainly he was had, badly had, and he
did believe that Daly was waiting to deal out
black eye. Also he was nervous, for he had lived
long and had experiences, and it would take him
more than two days to repent of his sins and
transgressions. But the little joke was too much
for one of that merry band of fakirs ; he bubbled
over. And the insurance-man caught on. He
paid his tenner, stood the chaff, and took his
drinks with the rest. Then he turned nasty,
threatened prosecution for the obtainal of money
by false pretences, and finally got his tenner back
intact. So each side enjoyed its bit of fun, but
the other lot paid for the drinks. The insurance-
man reckons he came out top dog, and the writer
of your par. is advised to invest some cash in
sticking-plaster in preparation for his meeting
with yours—That Agent.

The Wolseley Sheep-shearing
Machine Co., Ltd.
The Wolseley Company was originally started in
Sydney in 1887, but was floated into a large con-
cern in London in 1889 with a capital of £200,000.
The company have up to the present time fitted
over 450 sheds with an approximate total of 10,000
stands, the number of sheep shorn last shearing
season by Wolseley machines alone in Austra-
lasia being estimated at 25,000,000, while in South
America, the Cape, and other sheep - bearing
countries we are informed equally large and grow-
ing business is being done.
The Wolseley Company are in the unique posi-
tion of being the pioneers, and have held the
supremacy over all other makes of machines dur-
ing the 12 years of their existence. This speaks
volumes for the duality and superiority of their
manufactures.
The company’s swnding challenge to all comers
has been in force for years, but has never yet been
accepted, viz., it will erect an equal number of
stands with any other maker, the loser to pay
the winner’s expenses only. This shows their im-
plicit confidence in their own machine, as with the
reputation it already possesses it has nothing to
gain excepting the increased confidence of the
squatter, and if beaten it would be a great adver-
tisement to its yictor.
A notable fact is that shearers purchase for
themselves Wolseley machine shears and sundries,
when proceeding to a machine shed fitted with
those of other makers.
The following are a few records made by shearers
using Wolseley machines, and indicate what a
great advantage they possess over hand shears :
•T. Power shore 315 sheep in one day of eight
hours ; Norman shore an average of 200 per day
for over six weeks ; Louis J. Pulley shore over
31,000 in one season. These records were made in
Queensland.
The benefit accruing to the squatter through
using machines is at least a gain of Jib. of wool
per sheep, this in stations contiguous to railways ;
while those still further away in the back-blocks
save, it is estimated, at least fib. of wool, owing
to the cut with hand shears there being much
rougher.
The M'Caugheys, who shear about 1,000,000
sheep annually, have the following sheds fitted
with Wolseley machines — viz., Dunlop, Toorale,
Doree, G-oolgumbla, Rockwood, Barenya, and
North Yanko. Henry Ricketson has the follow-
ing sheds fitted, viz.: —Bitlabong, Barratta, Ara-
tula, Delatite and Yarronvale. The Osbornes
have fitted Douro, Redbank, Kulki, Curran-
clooley, Orange Plains, Foxlow, Bangaroo, Thorn-
dale and Dirnaseer. Cobb and Co. have fitted
Murrumbidgerie, Burrenbilla, Buckiinguy and
Hereford. These sheds have not been fitted
simultaneously, but one has succeeded another
owing to the satisfactory results obtained at the
initial sheds. At the company’s works in Birming-
ham, which are considered second to none in
equipment of machinery and up to date tools, 350
hands are employed, all parts of the machinery
being made there. In Sydney, the company also
have well-equipped workshops, where repairs to
the machines, &c., can be effected when neces-
sary. . •
It appears to us that it would be materially to
the advantage of all squatters to fit up their sheds
■with machines, the continued drought having
lessened the number of sheep to such an extent
that every half-pound of wool gained will mean at
least fourpence, as with scarcity of the commodity
its value must be enhanced. For example, a
station shearing, say, 30,000 sheep would gain
15,0001 b. wool, which at Bd. per lb. would equal
£5OO.
The approximate cost of all necessary machinery,
including engine erected and ready for work,
would be within £350, leaving a clear profit of
£l5O and all machinery paid for on the first shear-
ing. We would strongly advise our squatting
friends to digest the above.
Every inducement is offered by the company’s
agents, Messrs. Dangar, G-edye and Co., who are
willing to supply the shearing machinery on four
months’ credit, thus enabling the grower to have
his wool shorn and sold before being called upon
to pay for the machinery. As a further instance
of the gain to squatters it may be mentioned that
in the case of all machine sheds having had the
misfortune to be destroyed by fire,, the owners
have in each instance fitted up their new sheds
again with shearing machinery.
The bicycle shown in successful operation at the
recent show (Easter) of the Royal Agricultural
Society of N.S.W., at Sydney, goes to prove that
this company is up-to-date. This was its initial
trial and it is hard to say what the future pos-
sibilities are likely to be for such motive power,
and as the bicycle is fast growing in favor with
shearers in search of employment, it is only
reasonable to suppose that they will have the
patent shearing gear attached to. their bicycles.
The gear complete and fitted with sharpening
wheel will weigh in all about 151 b. It is estimated
that one man pedalling will be capable of driving
two shearing machines. This will be of great
benefit to the selectors, and enable, them to have
the advantage of shearing by machinery.
The company was awarded first and only prize
at the Sydney Easter show of the Royal Agricul-
tural Society of N.S.W. for their sheep-shearing
machinery.*
The Bulletin is asked to mention that in
its recent reference to the death of Mr. Sackville
Kidman, “Sack,” the familiar abbreviation of
the first name, was inadvertently printed “Jack.”
Mary Fairney writes The Bulletin from
20 Pomeroy-street, Cardiff, S. Wales, asking it to
find out for her “about some relatives of mine,
viz. Henry Golightly, who went to Ballarat about
40 years ago, also Elizabeth Golightly (maiden
name), both of Howdon-on-Tyne. I am niece of
the above, and desire to hear from them.”
The Bulletin acknowledges from a con-
tributor, “ Aletes,” 10s. towards the fund for
assisting the slave-driven Afghans of Bourke,
N.S.W., to get justice at law.

Judge Rogers, at a Cootamundra Quarter
Sessions, has laid down that a bona fide lodger at
aN.S.W. hotel may treat a visiting friend after
bar-hours, if the lodger pays and the drinks are
consumed outside the public bar. In the case in
hand the drinks were consumed in a room behind
the bar, at 12.30 a.m.
An exchange prints :
Some mischievous, ignorant newspaper scribe in Sydney
has discovered that Federation will be injurious to
Catholics, and will mean the deification of the Yellow
Pup, and a return to the days of the rack and thumb-
screw. No Catholic, it appears, will ever be permitted to
cross the awe-inspiring portals of the Federal Upper
House. All which we take the liberty to characterise as
pure asinine drivel. Federation will kick bigotry once
and forever out of Australia, and under the one flag
Catholics will receive the public support to which their
individual merits will entitle them.
To which The Bulletin says Amen. Sectarian
bigotry is civic, and even provincial, but not
national. The wretched things who formed the
rank-and-file of Parkes’ political tail in the days
when he worked the Kiama Ghost would be im-
possible in a Federal atmosphere. The bigger the
men, the less court they pay to priest or parson.

“ Old North ” : Recently asked a Queens-
land M.L.A. for a farming constituency why he
opposed Federation during his campaign. His
reply throws light on a whole lot of things.
“Well,” he said, candidly, “they’re a damned
thick-headed lot up my way. I tell ’em Federa-
tion means flooding the local market with Southern
produce. They understand that all right. My |
opponent tried to explain the matter in detail, and
got his auditors and himself hopelessly fogged. I
don’t understand the Commonwealth Bill any
more than a reaping-machine does, but I do know
my constituents and the extent of their intelli-
gence.”

In a recent Worker (Q.) article, editor
Higgs farewells his readers, and in so doing
takes credit to his paper for routing Mcll- |
wraith out of the country, exiling Tozer, and j
driving Hugh Nelson into the Council. Without
wishing to depreciate the Worker’s really valuable
services, it might be well to point out that that
organ’s former “ whole hog ” policy did more
towards retarding reform than the devices of all
the cronk Boodlewraithians put together. If the
Parliamentary Labor-party had been as narrow as
the Worker was in its early years, Democracy
would not stand half as well as it does to-day in |
Queensland. |
A study of the voting at Q. general
election reveals some interesting figures. Old
Ministerialists secured 375, new Ministerialists
700, old Independent Ministerialists 1219, new
Independent Ministerialists 918, new Laborists
765, old Laborists 979, new Drakeites 576, old
Drakeites 926—average votes per man. Also, out
of seven Cabinet Ministers with nine portfolios, |
four with six portfolios represent the Centre and
North which return only 11 Ministerialists
while the South returning 31 Ministerialists
has only three portfolios. Under these conditions,
an agitation for Southern separation may break
out at any moment.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

And here’s another (present scribe can support his
tale by affidavit from three reputable citizens who
witnessed the occurence): Went “ drifting ” for
flathead off Great Mackerel Peach, Hawkesbury
River, and while trying to pull up fish, lost a big
hook with brass attachment. Landed and had
lunch, and on next drift, an hour-and-a-half later,
same fisher caught big flathead with his hook and
brass wire in its mouth. Mind you, the same
fisher caught the flathead—-though there were
three other liars in the boat. What are the odds
against such an occurrence ? HoW many millions
to one against the boat happening upon exactly
the same track, or the wounded fish accommodat-
ing itself to the boat’s drift, and biting again—at

defend himself, or to point out the discrepancies.
He asked her to stay and see the show over again
in a calm and judicial frame of mind, and pro-
mised that she would discover that the man
coming off the boat resembled him just as
much as a skirt-dance does the five books
of Moses. But she refused. She said
it was only a scheme of his to get at the pro-
prietor, who was doubtless his accomplice, and
induce him to alter the man in the picture. Said
also she had no doubt he and the cinematograph-
man kept a joint harem somewhere. Said they
were, jointly and severally, a Mormon, a bald-
headed wretch, a bigamist, and a deceiver. Also,
that he had never loved her, and that he and the
“cine.” proprietor had doubtless laughed in
secret at her trusting heart for many years.
Believed that they had got up the show expressly
to insult her. Said she would defend her character
to the last, and would prove her innocence of the
foul charges that they were no doubt conspiring
to bring against her, and would also have a
divorce, and her sainted mother would turn in her
grave. Then she removed her husband in custody,
and under dark suspicions.
HAVE YOU
AMD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you hare poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say i erhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have fai'ed is no reason for not now being cured.

Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Hbrr Rassmussbn.
Dear Sir.—l feel it Ixl3’ duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two vears ago.
I also tried 'your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified m3' blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended oil.
You are at to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, 0. J. A. NIELSEN.

Sydney chessists are sore over the failure
of the projected match for the championship of
Australia between Messrs. Jacobsen (holder) and
Wallace (challenger). The cause was a quarrel
over the rights of the combatants to compel pay-
ment from the daily journals for publication of the
gainesi-played. Mr. Jacobsen, as chess-editor of
Sydney Telegraph, was sure of his emoluments,
and Wallace was trying to get his share from S.M.
Herald. The haggling over this point was so
protracted that Jacobsen was enabled to resign
without risking the loss of his title by defeat.
Wallace now professes willingness to play the
match on his opponent’s own terms, rather than
not at all. As Jacobsen declines to play on any
terms at all, he having resigned, the Wallaceites
declare that he is afraid to do so, and Jacobsen’s
friends accuse Wallace of cowardice in not play-
ing when he could. All of which is very pretty.

To the Shareholders of The Colonial Bank of Australasia Limited.
Ladies and Gentlemen, —We beg to report that we have audited the accounts of The Colonial Bank of Australasia

have also to report that during such audit we have not observed or become acquainted with any breach of the “ Com-

ance with the provisions of the “ Companies Acts,” and present a correct view of the state of the company’s affairs,

W. H. MAlyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,’'
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Vours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLXHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

Baron Berzelius’ Report.
These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Head What Medical Men Say About Them.
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. :--888B —I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening ; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. :—lt is the purest of Bitters, and exerts a peculiar influence over the
Liver.

GERMAN ELECTRIC APPLIANCE AGENCY,

THEN IT WENT ON ALL RIGHT.
The writer of the letter which I am going to.
copy for you in a moment has a complaint to.
make. Rather, perhaps, a complaint to place on
record, as the reason for it is passed away for the.
present, and she hopes—and we hope with her—
that it may not return. The complaint does not.
refer to any relative, friend, or foe, but to her own
heart. It did not work well. It was weak, and!
for a long time she was unable to find means to
make it do better. Which was a serious matter,
inasmuch as the vigor of the circulation of the
blood always depends upon the force wherewith
the heart drives it.
Still, it seems to me we ought to be a bit indul-
gent towards the heart in view of the labor it has
to ]) rfomi. Remember that it never takes a full
minute’s rest at one time, night or day, from the
instant it begins at your birth until, like a muffled
drum, it stops for good and all—life’s funeral
march to the grave being over. During all this
while, ten years or a hundred, the heart has got to
keep on pumping blood through your body at the
rate of from 130 strokes a minute in childhood to
50 or 60 in old age. If you happen to have a
mechanical turn of mind, it may interest you to
figure out how much this stands for in units of
horse-power for a given case and time. If not,
you can take my word for it that, merely as a
machine, the heart deserves your respect. So long
as it goes ahead steadily, up hill and down dale,,
hammering away softly but strongly, you haven’t,
a word to say for or against it; but when it begins,
to get weak, maybe skipping a stitch now andi
then, you call in the doctor, who puts the tip of
his finger just below the base of your left thumb,
looks wise and solemn (as befits the occasion), and
says, “Ah, yes, yes; I see, I see.” But what does
he see ? He doesn’t tell you that; he leaves medi-
cine, and mentions when he will look in again.
But as to the letter I spoke of. “Eor many
years,” the lady says, “ I suffered from indigestion
and weak heart. Very little exertion made me
feel weary and tired. Cold, clammy sweats broke
over me. I had a poor appetite, and after meals
an aching pain at the chest and a miserable sink-
ing feeling at the stomach. I had also much pain
at the left side, and my heart would flutter so as
to frighten me. At length I became so weak I
was barely able to get about, being no longer able
to do my housework.
“ Owing to the trouble at my heart I obtained
no proper rest at night, and often walked about
my bedroom at night. Many times these attacks
were so bad I thought I was dying. During the
day a sense of suffocation sometimes came upon
me, and I was obliged to go to the door for fresh
air.
“ Year after year I suffered like this ; now a
little better, now as bad as I could be. In No-
vember, 1887, while on a visit to Croydon, my son-
in-law persuaded me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
He got me a bottle, and after taking it I experi-
enced great relief. The pain at my heart was
easier, and I felt better as a whole. I could eat
well, and the food agreed with me.
“ I now felt encouraged to continue using this
remedy. Soon I was in better health than for
years, the heart trouble having disappeared alto-
gether. Since that time when I feel anything
ailing me a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
never fail to give the desired relief. I have told
many persons of the benefit I have derived from
it, and hereby consent to your publishing this
statement should you wish to do so.”—(Signed)
(Mrs.) William Harrington, near Wickford Hill,
Clare, Suffolk, November 12, 1897.
Now what ailed Mrs. Harrington’s heart ? Why,,
precisely the same things that ailed her lungs, her
nerves and her muscles — weakness. Therein she-
is right. It was a weak heart, but not a diseased ’
heart. The heart is a muscle, and (seeing the pro-
digious lot of work it has to do) necessarily a*
strong, active muscle. But it will not work with-
out pay any more than you or I will. With all the
rest of the body, it has got to be sustained and
strengthened by food. Here we have the point,
then. The lady was afflicted with chronic indiges-
tion. For this reason her whole body grew weak
—the heart, of course, with other parts of the
engine. Hence all the symptoms she names. Her
immense all-round weakness and puller-down is
that same old dyspepsia. When Mother Seigel’s
Syrup made the digestion of plenty of food pos-
sible, the heart went on all right, like a newly-
wound clock.’'
This Will Interest Many.

anyone who is afflicted with Nervousness or
Weakness, in any form, will send their address to

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and’immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is <> eiierally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,— I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure, I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am’now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends. —Yours
truly, E. SMITH, 'Halpin Park, Nhill,Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I ouite o-ot rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.” .

(by otjr special reporter.)
“ I am busy now, but if you will call m the
course of half-an-hour I shall be pleased to
answer any questions on the subject ol my
cure.” This was the answer furnished to
our reporter by Mr. J. S. Myers, proprietor
of the Auburn Bakery, Hairow Road,
Auburn, near Sydney. Conscquen ly our
reporter called again at Mr. My ers residence,
and was shown into the drawing-room,
where that gentleman shortly afterwards
aP £ e \Vhat was the cause of your illness,
asked the repoi ter ? ” ,
“ I cannot tell you with certainty, replied
Mr M\ers, “ but as I come of a pai ucularly
healthy and long-lived family I am inclined
to think my illness was the result of an
accident, A
Fall -from a Horse,
when I was about 14 years of age had, I
believe, no little to do with it, as I con-
tinually suffered from headache afterwards.
I was in the South Sea Islauds, too, for
some years, and the climate by no means
improved my health. It is since I returned
from the islands that I began to be troubled
with
Severe Nervous Headaches,
which chiefly affected the back of my head.
These we e much intensified by the confine-
ment and hard mental work which I had to
undergo in the conducting of my business,
and especially in keeping my accounts.
I was, in addition, obliged to superintend
the operations in the bakehouse, wheie
the stifling atmosphere had a tendency to
make my general health worse. I was not
able to take a holiday, and, as a conse-
q lence,
My Health Broke Down,
I viecame very nervous and irritable. My
headaches came onat more frequent intervals,
and were exceedingly violent. I couldu t
bear the children’s noise, even if they
chattered in my presence, and such small
trifles which once gave me no concern
worried me exceedingly. I began to lose
my appetite, and often when I was called to
my meals I could do no more than make a
mere pretence of eating. Then in ligestion
set in. Nothing I ate agreed with me, and
my food would lie undigested on my stomach
for long enough, giving me considerable
Pain and Distress.
My system was entirely out of tune. I was
completely run down. I pissed long, weari-
some, sleepless nights turning from side to
side, in vain trying to get some rest, and in
the mornings I was dull and tired, and felt
Entirely imafole to attend
to my business. In fact, I was compelled to
put my books aside.”
“Did you consult any doctors, Mr.
Myers?” , ,
“ Yes. Before I came here I was attended
by several doctors, but they faile I to cuie
me, though occasionally I obtained tempo-
rary relief. One of the doctors said I should
always have the headaches.
“ And did you get no relief ?”
“ No, I got no better, in fact, I continued
to get’ worse. My continued ill-health
caused me to suffer from
Great Depression of Spirits,
r could take no interest in anything, not. in
my business, nor yet in what was happening
around me. Nothing gave me any pleasure.
I lost greatly in weight, and, of course,
became correspondingly weak. A languid
and depressed feeling was upon me continu-
ally. I was very thin and my
Face was Parchment-like
in appearance.”
“ Did you try any other medicines in
addition to those prescribed by your medical
attendants ?”
“ Yes ; 1 tried various medicines which
were recommended to me by friends and
neighbours, and also medicines I saw
advertised, but I obtained
No sort of Satisfaction
till I tried Clements Tonic.”
“ And that you found beneficial?”
“ I did, indeed. Half a large bot le I
found sufficient to cause
A decided Improvement
in the condition of my nerves. There is not
the least doubt in my mind as to the
strengthening and invigorating qualities of
Clements Tonic, for under the influence of
that remedy my appetite at once began to
improve, and I was enabled to get much
better sleep at night.”
“Did Clements Tonic have any direct
effect upon the bad headaches which you’ve
mentioned ?”
“Yes the headaches began to decrease
from the day I commenced the remedy, and
as I c ntinued with Clements lonic they

My digestive organs work, d properly again,
and I "once more began to take a renewed
interest in my business and surroundings
In the mornings I arose refreshed by my
sleep and feeling quite able to fulfil the
duties of the day. All that dull depression
of spirits went away with the ill-health of
which it was the cause, and I was no longer
irritable, nor did small matters worry me.
I put on my lost weight, regained my

work with any man.”

If you Love a Man: Love Him
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Can you imagine anything more beautiful,”
said the youth, lying back in his long chair with a
sigh of content, and gazing out over the range of
country, and the distant sea that stretched like
blue steel away to the horizon.
“ Very jolly,” answered the girl, who was his
wife, and who leaned over the verandah-railing
watching a snail on one of her pet bulbs. “ Shall
I order the Stilton or the Gorgonzola ? ”
“Oh, my dear, for goodness sake don’t worry
about cheese on a morning like this—it’s —it’s in-
decent,” he said, looking at her sideways, with a
burning match suspended over the bowl of his
pipe.
“ Well, I got it for you, and you don’t do much
for me now. Just look at that shell-slug eating
my narcissus.”
Geoffrey rose languidly, went down the verandah-
steps into the blazing sun, captured the snail, de-
posited it on a big stone, and with another smashed
it to atoms. There was an expression of disgust
on his face, but he looked up and said, “ Well, I
guess he never knew what struck him ”; and the
girl laughed and ran indoors.
* * * *
They had been married three months, and the
girl had never known life could be so fair. She
had duly written to her people, “Geoffrey is so
good to me.” He was her hero, and she raved of
him to all her female acquaintances, and they,
being matrons, and well into the toleration stage
of domestic bliss, shook their heads wisely and
said, “ Don’t spoil him, my dear—never let a man
know how much you care for him ” ; and she, con-
cluding that they ought to know, set out in her
silly, thoughtless way to ruin the life that had
begun so well.
He was a fool; there was not the slightest doubt
of that; and, besides being a fool, he was a senti-
mental, a sensitive, and a pig-headed fool, which
is a difficult combination to deal with. He had
duly recognised that in his marriage he had made
a fool of himself, and had just concluded never to
let her know, but to make the best of it, and to
make his married life fit, as nearly as possible, the
dreams he had dreamed.
And then she made a friend of a girl a year
older than herself, but yet younger, in that she
was unmarried ; and to this friend she preached
the goodness and gentleness of her Geoffrey, by
morning, by noon, and by night. And when the
friend saw the pain in his eyes, and asked her why,
then, she snubbed him so unmercifully, she wisely
shook her head, as she had seen the matrons do,
and said, “ My dear, never let a man know how
much you care for him.” And the girl-friend
sighed, for she liked this gentle fool who rode so
daringly and shot so straight and suffered so
silently.
A year later the end came; an advt. appeared
in the morning papers as follows :
A man, formerly a gentleman, seeks a divorce from his
wife, and desires to correspond with a lady who seeks a
divorce from her husband. Write, in the first place, to
A.8.C., G.P.O.
People laughed and wondered who was re-
BDOnsible for the hoax, and if he would get any
answers He did get a great many, a number that
surprised him, and among them one the hand wri-
ng™ initial of which were familiar -That
evening his wife told him she expected the girl-
friend to dinner, and Geoffrey, listening to his
conscience, expressed his sorrow that he would not
b6 ‘ J But you must, Geoffrey; you are always selfish
an « Yes; but'l told Smith I would see him to-
nl“hSmith’s away,”—triumphantly— I saw him
this afternoon, and he said he would not be back
f °“Oh, e then, he can’t have got my note; very
well ’’-Geoffrey laughed queerly— 111 stay.
The three of them sat on the verandah while the
full moon rose over the trees. Mrs. Geoffrey went
inside to get something, and Geoffrey leaned over
and took the hand of the girl-friend.
“ How did you know ?” he asked.
“ Yesterday she sent me into your den to get a
book of Kipling. ' I saw on your blotting-paper a
paragraph reversed. ‘ Advertisement struck me,
and I took it to the glass and read it. Then 1
tore it up. Oh, I’ve known for a year, the rest of

said.

Recently arrived at Mossman (N.Q.) 100
Kanakas in one batch. And this to a place the
colored population of which is already far in ex-
cess of the white.
An engine-driver on Cairns (N.Q.) line
saw a man lying across the rails. Pulled up the
engine and found the fellow fast asleep on the
track. Latter explained (with a hiccup) that he
had sat down on the line to take off his boots and
had fallen asleep. They sell marvellous beer in
Cairns district.
There was lately added totheN.S.W. Bar-
roll an old name in a new personage, the stalwart
Mr. Charles Badham Martin, fifth son of the late
Chief Justice James Martin, and nephew of Mr.
“ Bill ” Long, of racing fame. This young gentle-
man, who strongly recalls his distinguished father’s
personal appearance, is a member of the Middle
Temple.
M.L. A. Spruson’s agitation to permanently
reserve Dawes Point has led a number of persons,
politicians and others, to believe that Gov. Phillip
there read the proclamation establishing the pro-
vince of N.S. W. There were, in fact, two proclama-
tions read on two different days, having to do
with the establishment of the settlement. Phillip
read the first near what is now the Hotel
Metropole above Circular Quay, the harbor waters
then running up beyond the site of the present
Custom House. That was 26th Jail., 1788. On
7th Eeb., following, Judge-Advocate David Col-
lins read, at Dawes Point, the King’s commission
defining' the boundaries of the province. He
afterwards read the Act of the Imperial Parlia-
ment establishing Courts of Judicature. During
the reading Phillip stood by in silence, but when
Collins finished, he delivered a brief, informal
speech, telling the convicts that if they obeyed
him they would get on well, but that if they didn’t
their skins and necks would suffer. Circular
Quay was Phillip’s ground ; Dawes Point, Collins’.
A Nocturne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“But where shall happiness be found?” asked
the young woman. The blasd man looked away
across the water, thought hard for a moment, and
replied, “ In memory ! ”
“ Is that where you find yours? ” she laughed.
“ Yes,” replied the blasd one.
“ Tell me your happiest memory,” said the girl.
The man shook his head. She pressed him ; and
suddenly the cigar went overboard, and the blas£
man seemed to change—get youthful and joyous
again—and commenced :
“ It was long ago, at Patne, just outside
Napier, in Maoriland ; we had a picnic and dance
out there in some pleasure-grounds. There were
three big six-horse ’bus-loads of them; but I and
a chum went down in a double Rob-roy canoe.
And at the picnic he fell suddenly in love, and—
well, in short, I got warning that I would have to
sail home by myself. This leaked out, and all the
afternoon I was beseiged by girls who wanted me
to take them home in that canoe. They didn’t
care one jot for me— it was the sail in the canoe
they wanted. But I was obdurate, for when I
first left home I had promised my mother never
to take a girl in a boat, and that promise I was
determined to keep. So, after hours of persuasion,
they retired, baffled.
“ There was a little girl there, with brown hair
and blue eyes—so blue,” and he pointed to the
soft Australian azure overhead. “She was a
singer, and no one seemed to look after her. All
the women and girls gave her the cold shoulder,
and the men seemed afraid to take her up. I was
afraid of women myself, and thought I had better
not interfere. Still I felt it was a shame. I asked
my chum what was the matter with the singer
that they all slighted her. He explained. Her
family was hard-up, and she had taken money to
sing at the festivities, and the 4 ladies ’ present
(most of whom had todotheirown washing) couldn’t
let slip so delightful an opportunity of trying
what it felt like to exercise authority over a wage-
earner. Well, she was not at all humble, and
gave them scorn for scorn, and all day long
glances of contempt flashed to and fro among the
camellias and verbenas.
“ It was over; the last ’bus had gone ; the lights
were out, the gardens deserted, and I was making
for my Canoe, when I saw the singer coming down
the moonlit road that led to Napier. I looked at
her in astonishment, and as she passed I stepped
out from under the willows and, overcoming my
shyness of women, asked her what had happened and
how she came to be there after the ’buses had gone.
She smiled rather sadly, and told me that some of
the women had hidden her hat and cloak, and
that while she was searching for them the last ’bus
had driven off. ‘ And now I shall have to walk
home. It is evident that someone is anxious for
an opportunity to talk about me ; but if I am seen
about Napier first thing to-morrow morning they’ll
be disappointed.’ Well, it was a long, lonely
walk, for a girl, eight miles over a rough, shingly
road. I mused, and the singer started off. I had
a vacant seat in that canoe, and —it was such a
long walk for a girl—at night, too ! I felt much
inclined to break that promise to mother, just for
once; then I thought of the singer’s face; it was
very pretty. I ran after her. ‘ Excuse me, but
will you trust yourself to me, I’ve got a seat in
my canoe—it holds two, you know—and if you’ll
come you will reaoh Napier about as soon as the
’busses.’
“ To my astonishment she was delighted and
evidently very much relieved. So we went down
to the canoe, and, when she was laced in, I shook
out the sails and let go, and we drifted down the
stream. There was no wind under th 9 willows,
and I had to paddle the first mile or so ; then we
left the willows ; the night-breeze came over the
paddocks, and we darted away through the moon-
light. Down the river, over the miniature bar,
out on to the dancing waters of the Inner Harbor.
The Inner Harbor is separated from the South
Pacific by a belt of sand and shingle about a quarter
of a mile wide, and along this belt runs the
Napier-Patne road. On the road, looming large
in the moonlight, were the three ’busses. The
pic-nickers were singing, and very sweet it
sounded: —
The poplars wave, the moon is low,
The waters murmur as they go,
Good-bye Babette, good-bye Pierrot.
“ I screwed my head round : ‘ Half those women
tried their best and hardest to go home as you are
going ; and perhaps Babette can sing something
to let them know that what they so eagerly sought
for was accepted by you as a favor to me.’ Even
as I spoke the nor’-west wind came rushing down
and caught the sails and drove the canoe faster
than a racehorse through the seething waters. I
ran-in close to the shore, till we were abreast of
the ’busses :
“Now, sing ! ”
“ And she did—something of tumbling waters,
flashing waves, and laughing winds ; and, as her
beautiful voice went sounding through the gale,
the refrain from the ’busses died away, and they
strained their eyes to find the singer. At last,
they discovered her, amid flying spray and lunar
sheen. Some of the better-hearted ones shouted
‘ Good-luck, Babette ! ’
“ Then away we flew, and all the rest was a
dream—a delirium of sirenic- singing, gleaming
waves, and bird-like flight; till, suddenly, we
were against the boatshed. I lifted her out
and stole one burning kiss.
“It burns yet!
“ Then we walked to Clive-square, and reached
it as the ’busses drove up, and her brother dropped
from somewhere and took her home.”
* * * *
The man tried to smoke an unlit cigar. “Go
on ! ” said the girl, eagerly.
“ That’s all,” said the man, regretfully.
“Dear me ! ” said the girl, in an injured tone;
“ the best part of that story never happened. You
ought at least to have got engaged ; and then her
triumph would have been complete iudeed ! ”
“By Jove! I never thought of that,” said the
man.
HERMES.
The M. L. Tory papers are much
troubled about the woes of the horny-handed
toiler now that a general election is close at hand,
and paragraphs like this are constantly meeting
the eye:
Premier Seddon still questions the wisdom of reducing
taxation though he boasts a surplus of half-a-million.
This is cheerful news for the poor working man.
The Bulletin also has a kindly feeling for the
poor working man. That is why it wants to find
a Premier who will screw out a surplus of a million
every year to be spent on useful public works, so
that it won’t be necessary to borrow money and
crush down the poor working man of the future
with the awful interest bill.

would so astonish them as to cause them to wear hands

Bronchitis Cured.
Some time ago Mr. M‘Cann, of 12
Oambridge-street, near Dawes Point,
Sydney, caught a severe cold and ne-
nm

then he
became fe-
verish, and
ultimately
bronchitis
set in,
which a
skilful doc-
tor feared
h e would
never get
rid of. His
appetite faded, and he dozed hea-
vily in the day hut could no
sleep at night. He grew as pale as
death and astonishingly thin. A friend
at this stage induced him to try Hr
Williams’ Pink Pills, and he bought
six boxes. Their effect was wonderful,
and from the first box an improvement
set in which continued until a perfect
cure was obtained. Now Mr M‘Cann
is hale and hearty, and free from the
slightest trace of bronchitis He says
Dr Williams’ Pink Pills undoubtedly
saved his life. Por curing rheumatism,
neuralgia, and all winter ailments they
are unrivalled. _____

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hear the Talker ringing changes on his ever-
lasting chimes:
“Hire and labor,” “work and wages,’’ themes
we’ve heard a thousand times.
Listen to the blatant liar —“There are better
times ahead 1 ”
But the bitter battle rages, fiercer grows the fight
for bread 1
Are the sweated slaves decreasing ? Is it men the
rich require?
Is the laborer regarded worthy of his wretched
hire ?
Bah ! the Talker’s trade is easy ! He is never one
of us—
He, the parasite of Dives! We, the kin of
Lazarus !
Once the world was wide and wondrous; brawn
and brain with sword equipped
Found a fortune for the fighting. Once the bold
explorer shipped
In his crank and crazy vessel, braving foul and
blessing fair,
Sailed for wealth and virgin waters, steered for
gold and God knows where.
Now the earth is known and narrow; Cunning
grabs his neighbor’s gold.
Pluck is listed for a pittance. Bravery is bought
and sold.
Blood is cheap and men are many ; earth is over-
populous,
There is barely room for Dives—none at all for
Lazarus !
Dives, Lord of all the Nations 1 Ave t great in-
carnate Greed !
Grovel to the great usurper of the crown of every
creed !
Or behold your children kneeling in the dust be-
fore his throne,
Broad-beseeching, and receiving for their piteous
prayer a stone !
Children ? Bondsmen, born to Dives ! ! Div s
has the prior claim
To the girl by you begotten, to the boy who bears
your name.
Make them study genuflection ! Make them
smug, obsequious ;
Better they should dine with Dives than with
dogs and Lazarus.
O, those “ better times a-coming ! ” They have
tarried overlong,
There is naught but Death before us, naught
behind but Want and Wrong.
Even when the mausoleum and the poor “ six feet
of sod ”
Send their souls to Judgment naked, equal in the
sight of God
Lazarus is damned, and Dives lies in Abram's
breast, perchance !
Who can say ? We are but mortal, Christ Himself
might look askance
On the aged, soulless, useless, utterly superfluous
Failure’s very incarnation ! Labor’s ending—
Lazarus !
W.A.P.
The Hawker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jonathan Vickers was one of the passing
curiosities of Waddy. He was an aged hawker,
who drifted into the township twice a week during
summer, and as often in winter as weather per-
mitted. In the summer days he came through
the old toll-bar on the north wind with the bil-
lowing dust, and departed via the Swamp-road,
still at the mercy of the elements; and nobody
knew whence he came or whither he went. He was
short, broad, and iron-framed, with a square face
set in a protecting prickly hedge of grey whiskers,
running from ear to ear under the chin. These
whiskers looked like a retaining band for his mop
of rebellious terrier hair. .
Vickers was a man of few words, and most of
these were unpublishable and wrong. His dress
in all weathers was a pair of brown moles, a blue
shirt, some forgotten fragments of a vest, and an
everlasting felt hat, black with age and service,
and higher and wider than any other known in
Waddy or mentioned in its traditions. In summer
he wore his shirt open at the neck ; in winter he
buttoned it up, and was obviously over-dressed
and wretched.
The tough old man hawked fruit, vegetables,
butter, and yeast, a little of each, in the ruins of
an ancient spring-oart that waddled on two bandy
wheels, and lurched endways and sideways, and
was always on the point of falling to pieces, and
always disappointing the boys of Waddy. He
drove a still more ancient ruin of ahorse, harnessed
with a strange assortment of old leather, old rope,
and scrap-iron.
Jonathan drove many horses in his time, but
they were all of the same kind and the same age—
thin pessimists, inhumanly detained from the
knacker or the bone-mill. The feebleness and the
many infirmities of Jonathan’s horses accounted
for the irregularity of his visits. The local belief
was that he always sailed before the wind, because
his horse could never bear up against a stiff
breeze, and housewives expecting him prayed for
a favoring gale. If the wind blew continuously
from the South, Vickers would sometimes dis-
appear for a week at a time, and we had visions
of him blown into strange, Far-North townships,
or camped helplessly under the lee of a hill,
awaiting a change.
At one time the old man had a horse called Star.
It was the most apathetic horse I have ever
known, and it was shaggy and leathery, with
hollow temples, in each of which you might have
placed an egg ; and its hoofs were beaten out
wide and fiat, the result of arduous labor on metal
roads without shoes. But Jonathan alluded to
the animal as “ the pony,” and evidently believed
that Star was young and foolish, and would grow
out of the before-mentioned defects. Truth to
tell, the horse was as venerable as Ahasuerus,
“ and chronicles of untold ancientness were legible
within his beamless eye.”
Whilst Vickers attended to his customers, Star
stood stock-still, with half-closed eyes and a
sagging lip. There was a prayerful, human weak-
ness in his knees ; he had a rump like a starved
greyhound’s, and corduroy ribs, and yet the in-
scrutable mystery of the beast commanded a
certain respect. There was something uncanny
about him ; he was like a haunted ruin, and con-
veyed to all beholders the same impression—an
unpleasant feeling that beneath his battered, way-
worn exterior there lurked a soul that rose superior
to mundane things, and harbored an ancient
philosophy. Many of Jonathan’s customers would
have dreaded to meet his horse after dark.
Star’s reputation depended upon his monumental
imperturbability; he was always buried in pro-
found thought, and even when his master thrust a
chance cabbage-leaf between his teeth, he would
indulge only in a few mechanical movements of
the jaw, and then drift again into deep reflection,
with the vegetable hanging from his lips. He
was difficult to start, and hard to stop. When
Jonathan wished to get him going, he climbed on
to the footboard, shook the reins vigorously, and
drummed bravely on Star’s callous ribs with a
supplejack, whilst delivering a dispassionate ex-
hortation :
“ Click, click, click. Ged up, blast yer bones !
Ged up ! Ain’t yeh got no sense ? Click, click,
111 learn yeh. Gee up, yeh blanky cow! gee.”
Then, to the interested spectator : “ He’s a bit
absent-minded, that’s what’s the matter. Ain’t
proper broke yet. Ged up, Star ! Blank you fer
a sleepy blank ! Click, click, click.”
By-and-by, without giving any preliminary
symptoms, Star would start off with a jerk, jolt-
ing Vickers down on the seat in a way that jarred
all his old bones, and there he would sit,- blanking
fitfully as the horse hobbled along with the energy
of despair, until it was necessary to think of pull-
ing up. Here, again, the difficulty of conveying
an impression to the introspective horse neces-
sitated much hauling and more profanity. Jona-
than started pulling about 50 yards before the
desired goal was reached, and finished on his feet,
hauling at the back of the cart, crying :
“ Woa, there, woa up, you dashed idyit ! Wo
there ! Wo, will yer? Gee back, blast yer blanky
old hide—gee back when I tell yeh ! ”
To the waiting customer, with honest pride :
“Ain’t he a whale fer work? An’him on’y a
pony ! ”
Jonathan’s belief in his “pony’’was genuine
and touching, and when he issued from the house
of a customer one afternoon, and found Star prone
on the road, half buried in the grey dust, his
amazement was too profound for language. Jona-
than stood over the horse, thumbing his gritty
chin, and stared stupidly down at the prostrate
brute. A vague idea that Star was playing off a
practical joke
took hold of
his mind, de-
spite the fact
that he had
never yet
known the
“pony” to be
guilty of such
levity. The
old man began
to expostulate
in the doubt-
ful tone one
assumes to-
wards a friend
who is prob-
ably drunk,
but who might
be dead:
“G e d up
outer this,
blast yer!
What yer lyin’
out there like
a fool fer, eh,
when yeh slep
all night, too?
Ged up !” He
kicked Star
lightly in the
ribs, but the
horse did not
move. “D’yer
wanter hang
out here all
day ? Ged up,
can’t yer?”
Jonathan hau-
led on the
reins, but
when he let go,
Star’s head
fell back again,
inertly flap-
ping the dust.
Then Vickers
went down on
his knees and
pressed his ear
to Star’s lean
ribs and list-
ened. Star
was not dead,
his uppermost
eye moved and
was not more
dim than
usual.
The women
began to gat-
her around
and offer ad-
vice and con-
solation. The
men were at
work or abed,
and the child-
ren pent up in
the little
school - house;
but the wives
and mothers
of Waddy
were a ble
women as a
r u le deep-
chested, and
big- limbed,
and willing;
and they gaily
helped in
stripping Star
of his tangled
harness and
hauling back
the loaded
cart.
Mrs. Dick-
sey was sure
it was a fit,
and Mirs. Ho-
gan ran for
vinegar, and
50 remedies
were suggest-
ed in three
minutes.
Meanwhi 1 e
Jonathan, be-
coming excited
and unreasonable, as the situation grew more
serious, blundered amongst his volunteers, and
bullied them, and swore consumedly.
Presently Star was divested of his trappings,
and lay outstretched in the dust, apparently con-
tent, and Vickers tried argument, and persuasion,
and the powers of evil language again, but the
horse heeded nothing.
“ Give him the taste av dthrink!” said Biddy
Elliot. Biddy found the “taste av dthrink”
efficacious in all her sorrows and afflictions, and
spoke with authority.
But the old hawker had taken up his horse’s
head, and was hauling like a hero.
“ Will ye lend a hand here when ye’ve done
cacklin’ ? ” he blurted fiercely.
They lent a hand readily. Every woman that
could get near enough to lift, lifted with great
heartiness, and presently Star was propped on his
haunches, sitting up with his head lolling stupidly
over Mrs. Best’s shoulder, whilst that long, iron-
framed female embraced him about the neck and
held him like a derrick.
“ Hold him so, ma’am,” cried Jonathan, “ till
we straighten him up at the back.”
Mrs. Best held like grim death, whilst the
hawker and the wives of Waddy fastened upon
Star’s hind-quarters, and lifted them into line.
But just then Star went down by the bow again
with a plunge, Mrs. Best underneath, and there
was a wild disturbance in the dust, and a desper-
ate beating of white-stockinged legs on the ground,
and muffled shrieks, until the rescue-party had
lifted the horse and delivered the stricken woman.
The dust blew about in scudding clouds, for it
was a pestilent day, and the sun flamed in their
faces like an open furnace, but Jonathan was not
deserted. He had an unreasonable idea that all
would be well if he could only get the horse on its
legs again; and yet, as they struggled with him,
Star was as limp as a wet shirt, and his legs swung
under him like ropes.
Mrs. Best was dirty and torn, but not discom-
fited, and lent valuable aid in the next rally. This
time they first lifted the aft end of the horse, and
then, leaving three women to hold the fort, Jona-
than and two others took Star by the head, and
brought him up standing. But only for a second;
he buckled, and went down flop, and Jonathan
lifted up his voice, and was unnaturally eloquent.
They struggled with the malignant “pony” for
an hour or more after that, pulling and hauling
valiantly. They brought and administered many
and various remedies. One, a bran-mash, was
applied hot to his breast in an. old petticoat of
Mrs. Dicksey’s. But nothing eventuated.
The last struggle was successful to a certain
extent. Mrs. Best brought rails from Cadden’s
fence, and they lifted Star up, a section at a time,
and propped him so, with eight brawny women
on each side holding him up. Jonathan sat apart,
and mopped his brow, and studied the situation.
“The devil a bit can you harness him up wid
thim props there,” said Mrs. Elliot.
“I can’t,” said Vickers, “but let be a while,
let be—perhaps ’twill encourage him.”
Tinker Smith had been sent for as a man of
knowledge and experience who had cured cows in
his time, and just here Tinker arrived from his
puddling-tub at the Peep-o’-day, and examined
the unnaturally perpendicular horse with a pro-
fessional air.
“ Dead,” he said. “ Bin dead more ’n a hour.”
Vickers collapsed, and sat down, staring stupidly
at the distance, a beaten man. The sixteen
brawny women instinctively let go the corpse, and
it fell for the twelfth and last time.
“ Give yer arfer crown f’r ’im,” said Tinker pre-
sently. Tinker kept fowls, and fed them on any-
thing dead. Besides, there was money in the
hide. “ Arfer crown,” he continued,“an’l won’t
charge nothin’ fer —fer medical attendance.”
Vickers closed with him, and ten minutes later,
holding the shafts, and tied between the traces,
tugging his cart himself, the old hawker went
manfully out of Waddy along the Swamp-road,
chased by the broiling brickfielder and the scud-
ding dust.

“I wish to say to every one that I have used a great deal °f Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla in my family. I believe it is the best family medicine there s
“ Once, while I was on a vessel trading to the East Indies and also while I
was living in Calcutta, I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for impurities in my blood,
and with the best results. I always took a stock of it with me when I went on
my voyages. I could not feel safe without it. For eruptions of the skin, boils,
and such affections it is a quick and sure cure. I recommend it to every o y
suffering from impurities in the blood, showing itself m any way whatsoever.
This is what Mr. W. A. Lindsay (whose portrait, with that of his wife and
child, is here given), of Stantkorpe, Queensland, Australia, thinks of Ayer s
Sarsaparilla. Because of the multitude of such cases, the people call Ayer s
Sarsaparilla
’•The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because some other preparation may be called a sarsaparilla is not the
slightest reason that it is anvthing like “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. If ypu wis
these quick results, these safe results, these sure results, you must insist upon
getting “Ayer’s.” Make a particular point of this.
