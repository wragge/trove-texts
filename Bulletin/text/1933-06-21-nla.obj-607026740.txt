Mat Schumann’s Salts
can do for "you !
To those who suffer from Constipation, Rheumatism, Neuritis,
Lumbago, Sluggish Liver and' all Uric Acid Complaints, science
plus nature has given to you a remedy in the form of Schumann s
Mineral Spring Salts.
It is safe to say that most of us have at some time felt the discomfort of
Constipation or the twinge of Uric Acid complaint—yet many thousands
of people are to-day helpless invalids through neglecting to commence
treatment in the early stages.
Even if you think you are well, you need Schumann’s
Schumann’s Mineral Spring Salts are made from the most important active
ingredients found in the natural Mineral Spring waters or Spas in Europe.
Thousands of people go to Europe to take the waters for Constipation and
Uric Acid Complaints.
Schumann’s Salts taken in a large glass of warm water every morning
have a similar action as the natural mineral waters of Europe. They flush
out the kidneys—rid the blood stream of Uric Acid poisons and thoroughly
cleanse" the System.
The human body—like a machine—must be attended to, and although
perhaps you feel well now, unforeseen happenings such as worry and
nerves will cause illness.
A regular morning dose of Schumann s Salts adls as a precaution
against CONSTIPATION and URIC ACID complaints.

Bolshevism in Art
A Sydney artist made what the “S. M.
Herald” called “a trenchant attack on the
attitude of Australians towards modern
art” in connection with a recent exhibi-
tion of overseas paintings and sculptures.
In point of fact the pictures of the five R.A.’s
represented were appreciated here on the
whole. John, Sickert, Connard, Sims
and Orpen are not recognised as moderns
by the moderns, and there is a reason
why the works of genuine moderns,
such as Nicholson and Nash, should not.
have been received with enthusiasm. It
has nothing to do with Australia’s alleged
“self-sufficiency” and “lack of culture.” Of
all the civilised countries the Common-
we.alth has probably felt the war, and the
resulting economic crisis, least. We' have
unemployed, but nobody starves, and,
though thousands who used to be rich are
now poor, there are still cakes and ale.
The major horrors—civil wars, racial and
religious persecutions, the extermination of
Whites by Reds and of Reds by Whites,
the kind of revolution-made poverty that
impels mothers to put starving children
out of their misery—have missed us alto-
gether.
“We find,” says Sir Michael Sadler in the
first of the publications reviewed below,
“that art has always been sensitive to
social and economic changes where these
have already occurred and are patent.”
His own country is an example. Its changes
from the Renaissance and Reformation
periods, and on through the smug Vic-
torian era to the present day, have been
faithfully mirrored in pictures, plays and
novels. Britain is not disorderly now in
the sense that, say, Germany is, but it
has been taking the strain of disorderliness
elsewhere for years, and the results are
evident in the usual places. It is still
almost as intolerant of revolutionary art
as Australia, and it is producing relatively
little of it. When the average educated
Londoner thinks of revolutionary art at
all he thinks of it in relation to someone
like Braque or Picasso or Epstein. To the
Briton revolutionary art- is still, like revo-
lutions-, the concern principally of
foreigners. But, unlike ourselves, the Brit-
ish are becoming increasingly aware of it,
as they have been, since the general strike,
of the presence of political revolutionaries.
The Significance of Left-wing Art
. Sir Michael Sadler suggests in Modern
Art and Revolution (Hogarth Press; Is.)
that the new movement may be a portent.
Admittedly improved transport has played
its part. European art is experiencing in-
fluences from Chinese, Khmer and Annam-
ese sculpture, from the frescoes of Ajanta
and Bagh, from the Ivory Coast ritual
masks, to which it was never subjected
before. But the root influence is Bolshe-
vistic. At the best he thinks that “this
tourbillon of nationality, mechanical inven-
tion, science and anthropology” forebodes
change. His only reason for doubting that
it forebodes disaster is that “the Left-wing
movements in modern art are so various
and disparate that they may point only
to confusion.” Isn’t it reasonable to argue
that, so far, anyhow, as England is con-
cerned, revolutionary art, to the extent
that it has been accepted, should be re-
garded not as a sign-post but as a record?
The only revolution England looks like
having has arrived already.
Revolution in England
In Ways of Escape (Heinemann; Bs.
6d.), Sir Philip Gibbs reveals how com-
plete - the English revolution has been.
Death duties have practically wiped out
the old aristocracy; in the last 12 years
“no less than 2500 of the old families
have had to sell their estates.” The sav-
ings of the middle and working classes are
no longer safe. England is off gold, and
politicians are in a position to devalu-
ate the currency as they have been doing
on the Continent, to the ruin of the thrifty.
The dole is being financed by calls upon
the Treasury to the extent of over
£100,000,000 a year, and poor relief is
absorbing a further £50,000,000 a year from
other sources. There are tens of thousands
of elderly men, such as coal miners, who
will never work again, and tens of thou-
sands of young men who have never worked
at all. Britain depends for two-thirds of
its food on foreign imports paid for by
manufactured goods, and how foreign coun-
tries are making their own goods. Whereas
in France 41 per
cent. of;the popu-
lation is on the
soil, in England,
Scotland and
Wales the propor-
tion is 7 per cent.
“There is more uncultivated land in Great
Britain,” said Mr. Lloyd George last Novem-
ber (1932), “than in any country in Europe
except Russia.”
The author’s cure is to create new Eng-
lands in Australia, M.L. and elsewhere by
mass emigration. But the position isn’t
so desperate as to impel millions of Britons
to exile themselves. There is the dole, and
bloodshed is unlikely because hardly any-
body wants a revolution of violence. The
national reaction to revolution as Europe
understands the word may be compared to
the national reaction to revolution in art.
A few are interested in Left-wing art, and
a number pretend to be; the vast
majority are indifferent. The British, un-
like the martyred races of Europe, don’t
understand the language of revolt suffi-
ciently well to be excited by the art of
revolt. Left-wing art has been functioning
fairly vigorously in England since Epstein
first began to exasperate the multitude
ten years ago, yet in all that time it
hasn’t produced a native-born master of
the stature of Van Gogh or Gauguin, or
even of the stature of Signac or Seurat.
A Mexican Example
Turn to Mexico. It isn’t nearly so liter-
ate as Great Britain, and it is much poorer
and further from the cultural influences of
Europe. But it has known terror and de-
spair. Leone B. Moats, the American
author of Thunder in Their Veins (Allen
and Unwin; 10s. 6d.), describes her ex-
periences there as the wife of a business
man. She arrived when Diaz was nearing
the end of his career. After his departure
the Government fell into the hands of a
succession of criminals who robbed and
slaughtered on wholesale lines. By the time
Calles took over upon the murder of Obre-
gon in 1928 most of the great country
estates had been laid waste, millions of
dollars’ worth of Church buildings had been
expropriated or destroyed and the owners
driven out of the country, unmentionable
outrages had been committed on women and
children, and there were few families with-
out members who had died violent deaths.
She says of Villa:—
He was literally a living te - a carry-
over into this twentieth cen ary of bar-
barian appetites and ruthlessness. His lusts
for blood and women were equal. When he
had satisfied the one he would slake his
thirst for the other.
Such an atmosphere does not make for
comfort and complacency, and, partly on
that account, it is a forcing-ground of
modern, or revolutionary, or Left-wing art.
This is the artists' day in Mexico. Their
rise to eminence has been rapid. As recently
as 1929 when Deigo Rivera did my por-
trait they were paying him only twenty
pesos a day. To-day he is one of thp most
famous and best-rewarded artists in the
world. The revolutionary painters and
musicians of Mexico inspire more interest
on the Continent than do any painters or
musicians at work in the U.S.A.
She reproduces a mural by Santiago, of
which it may be said that no country with
a history less gory’’ and muddled than
Mexico’s could possibly have given it
birth.

S.H.P., as a Freelance Saw Him
The freelance has his own point of view
in regard to an editor. I had the oppor-
tunity both as outside contributor, and
staff man of forming an opinion of S. H.
Prior. My association with him dates from
the time when the coming of “the ‘Wild
Cat’ man” to the editorial chair of The
Bulletin; was viewed with alarm, even re-
resentment, by some Bohemian contributors.
What could one who had steeped himself
in finance know about art or humor?
We soon found that he knew a lot. From
the freelance’s point of view, “S.H.”
soon proved to be the ideal editor. Archi-
bald’s habit of paragraph-polishing usually
provided for a sting in the tail, and the sting
was liable to be pure Archibald. Jimmy
Edmond couldn’t refrain from taking a
paragraph that appealed to him and making
it virtually his own. Prior performed his
surgical work in such a way that even the
parent of one of his subjects had to study
hard to find where the cut had been made.
The thing remained the author’s. The sub-
stitution of a quick word or two for an in-
volved paragraph left no scar on the original
plan. As a rule, J. H. M. Abbott stands
stoutly for the integrity of his copy, but
many a time and oft he referred to the

HOW IT WON'T BE DONE
EMPLOYEES in many professions and trades are now being replaced by machinery.
Therefore people starting out in life (and those restarting) should find an occupa-
tion in which the Human Factor cannot be replaced. One of the few such professions is
COMMERCIAL ILLUSTRATING.
To make good in this line, however, you must have ability to draw. As many people
are not aware that they possess this gift, we have evolved special ART ABILITY TESTS'.
Send for these Tests and enclose Bd. postage for a free copy of our 70-page book,
“The New Era of Commercial Art,” which contains valuable information about
art as a profession.

“magic word or two” from Prior that had
brightened it up. “He never really alters,
but the stuff always seems a bit better after
he has done with it,” Abbott used to declare.
We have known for so long the kindli-
ness and whimsical humor of “S.H.” that it
seems absurd to remember the time when
“the ‘Wild Cat’ man” was regarded with
dread. One treasured recollection of mine
is of a paragraph of a personal nature con-
cerning a Judge who, having reached the
dignity of the Bench, disowned an anecdote
of which in former days he had been proud.
Some sort of a withdrawal had to be made,
and it was made; but before I saw it in
print the editor mentioned the fact of its
impending appearance, with an assurance
that it implied no reflection on my journal-
istic honesty. It was an act of rare con-
sideration on the part of one who had so
many big things to think about.
Of his generosity on the financial side
many contributors are aware. When I was
on the staff a casual contributor found him-
self in sore need of a few pounds, and
appealed to me. I saw “5.H.,” who readily
agreed to make an advance. I mentioned
that the contributor was a generous fellow.
Prior smiled. “I know,” he said. “He
would give away his head—provided he had
a head to give away.”
Many people regarded Prior as aloof. His
real trouble was shyness. He was even shy
in giving praise, though he often did bring
himself to give it. He liked to keep in
the background. Yet he took a remarkable
interest in everybody about him and re-
garded the most insignificant contribu-
tor as a member of a family of which
he was head. The “man from the ‘Wild
Cat’ ” was to freelances like myself not only
a Chief but a friend.
HAROLD MERCER.
Kendall’s Boyhood
Henry Clarence Kendall and his twin-
brother Edward Basil were born April 18,
1841, in the Ulladulla district of New South
Wales. Ulladulla is a native name meaning
safe harbor. It was a convict settlement,
populated by timber-getters, old lags,
bullock-drivers, aboriginals and so forth—
a place to be remembered for its noise of
whips and axes. The boys’ grandfather (an
ex-missionary engaged in the cedar trade)
was continually grasping at grants of land;
but, as well as land, he came by water,
so to speak, for he was drowned when his
ship was lost in a storm off the South Coast.
Basil, his sixth son, the father of Henry,
had been a man-o’-warsman who saw ser-
vice under Lord Cochrane in South
America. He returned to Australia in
1840, met Miss McNally at a party one
night and married her next morning. He
is said to have had a good head for books,
but a bad one where wine was concerned.
In any case, he signed away his share of the
paternal estate, and thereafter was com-
pelled to work like a horse, merely to be
able to live. At the end of six years he
descended into a bush grave, his harness
still weighing upon him.
The poet’s mother seems to have been
typically happy-go-lucky; fond of reading
the same literature as her husband, rather
untidy and not of much use in the house.
Indeed, she was of such an irresponsible
nature that her twin sons surprised her by
bringing her to labor before she had even
thought of having a cradle ready for their
reception. So, an acquaintance, Jim Bur-
kinshaw, became the hero of the day by
chopping down a tree and, without any
wizard’s wand, turning it into a cot in-
stanter.... a cot with space for Henry at
the top-end, and for Edward at the other.
It is pleasant to imagine the careless,
easy-going Mrs. Kendall, seated in bed,
surrounded by gossiping neighbors, quite
contented to have Mr. Burkinshaw share
in the congratulations which were the order
of that day.
Henry was his mother’s favorite. When
the time came, she taught him to write,
“The dog runs,” “The cat has a long tail,”
using the dusty road for his copybook, and
a gum-tree twig for his pen. From sing-
ing him to sleep at night, she went on, as
he grew older, to repetitions of poetry by
day—poetiy a boy might understand and
be expected to like. She even wrote verses
herself, and by-and-bye the miracle
occurred: Henry did the same.
In 1846, Doctor Dobie, R.N., retired
Government Health Officer, engaged Basil
Kendall and his wife to be caretakers of
his property, Gordon-Brook, and of two
flocks of sheep, at wages amounting to
£3O a year. As Kendall had lost his share
in the Lniadulla estate he was glad of the
opportunity to have a roof above his head.
The couple contracted for 12 months only.
At the end of that period they removed to
a bigger station called Bushy Park, 10 miles
out from South Grafton. The owner of
Bushy Park was James Aitken, a short-set,
muscular man, once a schoolmaster, who
wore habitually over his working clothes
a magenta blouse or shirt which reached
down to his knees. On this account, he
came to be called the Red Squatter. He,
also, wrote poetiy. So perhaps, in his case,
the magenta blouse may have been justi-
fied.
From Bushy Park the Kendalls graduated
to Rose Valley, another of Aitken’s sheep-
runs; and from Rose Valley the father
passed on into that other Valley—of the
Shadow of Death. Mrs. Kendall brought
her five children (three girls and two boys)
to live with granfer McNally, formerly a
fo.ot-slogger in the British army, but now a
farmer at Fairy Meadow, near Wollongong,
on the road to Bulli. McNally took
them in—except the little girls, who were
adopted, separately, into homes in the
neighboring district. A different granfer,
this, from granfer Kendall. Granfer Kendall
had been an active, unimaginative man;
granfer McNally dreamed his hours away.
While he minded cattle with “th’ childra’”
he told stories about the Peninsular War—
so often that they became bored—particu-
larly of how he had made one of the buriai-
party at the obsequies of Sir John Moore.
"By the thlruggling moonbeamth mithty
light,’ lisped Henry....
“Why, thin,” says the granfer. “there
wasn’t th’ taste av a moon! Only the brahd
sun; on as fine a day as ever stepped out
av th’ shky.”
Henry became a shopboy and messenger
in a store kept by a man called Bates at
Wollongong. For two years he was daily
taking down shutters and putting them, up
again; for two years he slept underneath
the counter, writing a bit of poetry when-
ever he got the chance, but always aware
of the Pacific thudding on the shore out-
side. He busied himself with coffee and
sugar, and dreamed of the Barbaiy coast.
He carried a keg of oil, and pictured enor-
mous whales spouting their way through
the sea. He even thought about a brig,
working and creaking towards the south;
and this brig he thought about was his
Uncle Joe’s Plumstead, a whaling vessel
that voyaged so far down as the Antarctic;
so far up as Yokohama; past many an
island asleep in the sun.
He saw then, in imagination, what he
was to see afterwards in actuality white
bears swimming to feed on waste carcases
of huge fish, with seagulls flying over them.
Yet he was a conscientious iad, and worked
well; so well that, one day, his master,-
taking an account-sheet, roughly altered the
superscription from plain “Bates” to “Bates
and Kendall.” While he did this, he said
nothing to Henry, but allowed him to look
—with results entirely unexpected! The
apprentice suddenly “knew he was naked”;
was aware of his grocership and he longed
to be free.
Kendall wrote, secretly, to his Uncle Joe,
the only one of his father’s relations who
had been kind to him. Then, later on, for
conscience’ sake, he confessed to his mother
that he had asked for the position of cabin-
boy aboard the Plumstead. A letter came
telling him to set out immediately.
This happened in 1855. He was 14 years
old—and already tired of the butter-and-
eggs business.

A Satchel of Books
The Insect Book, by Walter Froggatt
(Shakspeare Head Press, Sydney; 25.), has
been written by the former Government
Entomologist of N.S.W., primarily for use
in schools. It is not intended to be ency-
clopaedic, but its 103 pages contain a well-
illustrated and judiciously-condensed survey
of the principal types of insects that inhabit
Australia. Spiders, of course, are not in-
sects, and they are not touched upon in this
book. Possibly a special volume will be de-
voted to them later. The Insect Book is
the first of a series of 2s. booklets edited by
David G. Stead.
Manuscripts, Victoria’s new half-crown
quarterly, has several interesting woodcuts
by Lionel Lindsay and Will Mahony, some
passable poetry and one or two challenging
articles. “Film Criticism,” by John D.
Keating, for example. He says, “It is doubt-
ful if there is a single metropolitan daily in
Australia that has a film critic,” and he
deplores the tendency of the publications
that have critics to deride the films. Unfor-
tunately, those who are in a position to tell
the truth about the films must laugh, if
they are not to, weep.
If there is a better living writer of tales
of mystery and imagination than Philip Mac-
donald the Red Page would like to know his
name. R. 1.8. (Crime Club; 7s. 6d.) is the.
latest and perhaps the most ingenious and
horrifying that he has written. The whole
of the action takes place in an English coun-
try house; the principal characters are liv-
ing, breathing people, and the very fact that
they are never allowed to over-play by a
hair’s-breadth adds terror to the ghastly
situation which their creator has devised for
them. Mr. Macdonald’s only defect is that
he writes too well for a novelist in this
genre.
In Dr. Chaos and the Devil Snar’d (Cas-
sell; 7s. 6d.), George R. Preedy offers a
couple of macabre stories in the Le Fanu
manner. The first is a period piece. The
London of an age when the world of fashion
had got no further west than Lincoln’s Inn
Fields and Red Lion Square is described, and
into the picture is woven the tragic tale of
a young Swede who became involved in the
mysterious doctor’s schemes. The other is
a modern ghost story. Also a penetrating
study of a wife obsessed by jealousy.
Ladies in the Case, by E. Charles Vivian
(Ward, Lock and Co.; 3s. 6d.), is a good,
almost great, murder yarn gone wrong. Mr.
Vivian’s Londoners are always capital, and
in this book he has a better plot than usual,
but he is fatally sentimental'. After draw-
ing an admirable picture of Connie the
Crook in her habit as she lived in pubs and
the like (“Oh, take yourself aw T ay, putty
face!” Lady Connie counselled angrily. “Go
away and boil yourself”), he allows her to
be transformed by Love into a languishing
Victorian maiden. It kills the atmosphere
of realism which the author has gone to
great pains to build up. The other Cock-
neys are lifelike, and his device of making
the hero and friend work independently of.
and often in opposition to, each other whil-
invosHsmting the deed of blood is novel and
amusing.

REFORM OR CHAOS.
The Premiers, Ministers of State, under-
secretaries, railway managers, professors and
understrappers who descended on Melbourne
at the beginning of the month to save the
country dispersed last week. The hotel-
keepers who housed the swarm were doubt-
less sorry to see them go, but their regrets
will not be shared. Australia will derive no
benefit from the discussions. The only con-
crete decisions arrived at were that it
should bo plunged further into debt.
Having more revenue thaii it can make
effective use of, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment agreed to spare a few hundred
thousands more for the three small States.
Otherwise the programme of State deficits
for 1933-34 would have remained at the
1932-33 figure, £9,000,000. It was agreed
in February that loan expenditure in 1933-
31 should be limited to £12,000,000. It
has been learned since that a lot of fixed-
deposit money maj r be obtained by offering
better terms than the banks; so the Loan
Council gaily added £5,346,000 to the
£12.000,000. It is, of course, “proposed to
spend almost the whole of it upon works
of a reproductive nature for the relief of
unemployment.” This tale is at least 50
years old.
Australia needs stronger and simpler gov-
ernment. fewer and better politicians, and a
Constitution that will work, instead of one
that has been a source of confusion from
the beginning, and of trouble that has taken
dangerous, as well as costly, forms. It
needs an express delimitation of spheres of
government, national and provincial, a defi-
nite assignment of powers and imposts to
particular authorities—some to the Com-
monwealth, others to the State—such as
will deliver the people from the curse of
divided control, from the plague of dupli-
cated taxes, from the disastrous predomin-
ance of the High Court and the ruinous
competition of the two industrial-arbitra-
tion shops. Australia needs also the sub-
division of the State with two-fifths of the
population, and with Lang and Garden and
his Inner Group, a proceeding which will
not only allay the great and just dis-
content of regions like the Riverina and
New England with Big-City rule, but will
strengthen the Senate. And the new States
and the small States must have a much
better financial arrangement than seemed
equitable to the Constitution-makers of
the ’nineties, who did their job so badly.
While the Government at Canberra rolls
in easy money, South Australia, Westralia
and Tasmania cannot pay their way; in-
deed, the two mainland States have no
prospect of becoming solvent.
What progress in these directions has
been made as a result of the Melbourne
conferences? None whatever. Little was
attempted; nothing was done. Amalgama-
tion of departments where there is over-
lapping and co-ordination of social services
to prevent Federal pensions and State
family-endowment and child-welfare pay-
ments going to the same parties were dis-
cussed, but no decision was reached. The
extortion of N.S.W. unemployed-relief tax
from residents receiving income from other
States, and taxed on the income by those
States (some of them have retaliated) and
the Commonwealth, was mentioned, and
delegates sighed thankfully when “Colonel
Cohen (Vic.) and Mr. Spooner (N.S.W.)
agreed to consult with the object of devis-
ing a proposal to be circulated for the con-
sideration of the various Governments.”
With equal haste and gratitude “the ques-
tion of double income taxation as between
the Commonwealth and Britain” was re-
ferred to each taxation commissioner for a
report, and “the question of double income
taxation as between States” was sent back
to the Commission on Taxation and the
flock of taxation commissioners—they, it
seems, evolved a “formula,” which was
promptly buried, at a conference in 1929
for more reports. The Commission on Taxa-
tion was supposed to have turned up its
toes years ago. But these Governments
would rather reanimate the carcase of a
royal commission and let double-tax
swindling go on than exert themselves to
stop the swindling.
The debates on constitutional reform and
the redistribution of Commonwealth and
State powers were farcical. The most fool-
ish utterance on the subject came from the
Premier of N. S. Wales, who is praised so
effusively by TJ.A.P. newspapers and by
Federal Labor M’s.L.C. whose election to
the new Upper House is in doubt. Refer-
ring to the last hectic months of his pre-
decessor in office he said that “the powers
of the Commonwealth Government under
the Constitution had been severely tested,”
and that “the. Constitution and the Com-
monwealth Government had emerged from
the difficult period stronger than ever.”
This is utter rubbish. The truth is that
never has a Commonwealth Government
cut so miserable a figure, and never has
the Constitution been in greater danger of
breaking down. The Lang Government
rebelled against both, and went unpunished.
It extended its contempt to the High Court
when the three Justices ruled that its
revenues could be seized by the Common-
wealth to the extent required for the
meeting of its engagements to the
nation, and Commonwealth attempts to
enforce the judgment were feeble in the
extreme. The rebel Government even
commandeered Commonwealth taxation
papers and held up the collection of Com-
monwealth taxes without interference from
the Administration which is alleged to have
“emerged from this difficult period stronger
than ever.” It was the Governor of the
State, not the Commonwealth Government,
who halted Lang in his wild career, and
it was the people of New South Wales, not
the Ministers at Canberra, who got rid of
him. Suppose a Lang-appointed local Gov-
ernor had been .in office, as might have
happened, would the Government at Can-
berra have saved N. S. Wales and Australia
from the 10s.-in-the-£ income tax, from the
10 p.c. tax on mortgages, from default and
its fruits, from rebellion and its conse-
quences? It is highly improbable.
If the Commonwealth Government and
Constitution had emerged so much more
powerful from the conflict with Lang, it
is extraordinary that within 10 months two
Westralian electors in every three voting
should have registered an emphatic desire
to be freed from both. Their Premier, fol-
lowing Mr. Stevens at Melbourne, said
it was the intention of his Government to
submit the case for separation to the
Imperial Government, and that it would
in the meantime respect the instruction of
the electors that it should have nothing
to do with a convention of the kind pro-
posed by the Lyons Government or any
other. The South Australian Premier
wanted an elective convention, but the
Commonwealth Attorney-General replied
that the conventionists, if. appointed at all.
would have to be nominated, since the
glorious Constitution does not admit of
their being elected. Mr. Butler was the
only delegate who was keen on a conven-
tion. and the proposal was dropped in
favor of a languid suggestion that the Pre-
miers should put their ideas, if any, on
paper and talk all round the subject again
'some time next year. Meanwhile the Com-
monwealth Ministers are to go on tour and
hold Cabinet meetings in the different capi-
tals. They are already converging on
Brisbane, whose leading newspaper, the
“Courier,” has pronounced Federation a
failure. From Brisbane they will travel
by easy stages to the other side of the
continent. When the Prime Minister was
over there he could not get a hearing,
but these little unpleasantnesses are soon
forgotten. Fatuousness is in fashion, and
it is supposed that the thrilling spectacle
of Marr or Archy Parkhill walking to
the Commonwealth office of a morning,
swinging a cane, will inspire such feelings
of patriotic pride that even secessionists
will straightway become reconciled to the
weakest instrument of government in the
English-speaking world.
FORGAN SMITH. FEDERALIST.
When the tumult of the Queensland elec-
tion of June, 1932, had died down the
State Parliament met, and Premier Forman
Smith delivered a Budget speech in which
he blamed every evil from which Banana-
landers suffer upon the previous Adminis-
tration. As one who exhibits a dead rat,
he held up for inspection Moore’s accumu-
lated deficits of £3,806.367, not failing to
emphasise that this figure represented
almost half the total deficits of the 74 years
of Queensland history. But he omitted to
make it clear that two-thirds of the pre-
vious accumulations had been made in pros-
perous times by Governments of which , he
himself had been an ardent member or
helper. And while he enlarged sadly on
the need for drastically reducing the Moore
Government’s estimated deficiency of
£2,750,000, and mentioned with tears in his
voice that' the inefficiency of his fore-
runners had left him with no alternative
but to practise rigid economy and increase
taxes, he did not say that he and his
friends had been responsible for creating
70 p.c. of the taxation which Queenslanders
pay to the State, and more than half the
interest bill.
The victims of this attack protested that
they were just men wrongfully accused.
“Hansard” testifies to the vigor with which
they defended themselves and the earn-
estness with which they tried to change
the new Premier’s point of view. Among
the words which were exchanged, as be-
tween friends, were “liar,” “greenhorn,”
“defamer of women” and “bribery.” But no
protest or invective could turn the mind
of Forgan Smith from economy. He pro-
ceeded to cut down an actual estimated ex-
penditure of about £15.000.000 by £220.000.
and further to reduce Moore’s estimated
deficiency by increasing income tax and
freight rates and fares and pinching a
quarter of a million of trust funds from the
Main Roads Board. He also accepted a
bank overdraft of £1,580.000 through the
Premiers’ Conference.
Now the gentleman is to be accommo-
dated in 1933-34 with a whole £1,850,000.
Leaving public-works loans out of the argu-
ment, Queensland, under his direction, is
to be allowed to go £2 a head to the bad
in a single twelvemonth. The concession
cannot be a reward for virtue acquired
during the past year, for even the small
direct economy budgeted for was scarcely
realised; and anyway a reduction of
charges on State consolidated revenue by
1.4 p.c. in a year when taxation and freight-
rates have been increased by an amount
equal to five times that percentage is
scarcely much help to the community.
Neither can it have been granted because
the northern State is breaking under any
special strain as compared with other
States.
Queensland’s unemployment figures re-
flect its continued favorable industrial
position, compared with other States. Nor-
mally, through the depression, its percent-
age of out-of-works has been not much
more than half that of N. S. Wales and
two-thirds that of the Commonwealth; and
since the end of the last financial year it
has shown a greater percentage of improve-
ment than any other State. At the end of
the second quarter last year, when Langism
was at its nadir, 33.2 p.c. of unionists in
N. S. Wales and 30 p.c. of all in the Com-
monwealth were returned as unemployed.
In Queensland the figure was 19.9 p.c. In
the first quarter of 1933, the N. S. Wales
and Commonwealth figures were 30.2 p.c.
and 26.5 p.c. respectively, and those for
Queensland 16.7 p.c. In December the aver-
age adult wage of Queensland male workers
was the highest in the Commonwealth by
nearly 4s. per week, while the weighted
retail-price index-number —“food, groceries
and all houses”—was the lowest in the Com-
monwealth by at least 20 points—-it stands
at 1215 as against 1295 in N. S. Wales and
1341 for Victoria. Yet the State so favored
is to be allowed to lean on the banks for
about £7OOO per working day in the fourth
depression year!
Of course there is a reason and, as usual,
it is a political one. Lyons was going to
Queensland to fight Forgan Smith and his
squandermania crew for the electoral com-
mand of the State at the Commonwealth
election. With Westralian political bodies
in revolt, with the breach between the
U.A.P. and the Country party widening,
and with the N. S. Wales State Labor fac-
tions struggling in their odd way for Com-
monwealth unity, Queensland will be the
crucial State; and Lyons realises it. When
on tour he will claim full credit for
having given Queensland the £1,850,000.
Forgan Smith will take full credit for having
got it. The Labor Premier said in Mel-
bourne that “everyone worthy the name of
an Australian will see to it that the bonds
which keep Australia united are strength-
ened rather than weakened.” Evidently
an ardent Federalist; and why shouldn’t he
be when Federation is so kind to him?
NEW TENANTS FOR THE MINT.
It is an old and tattered pile in Macquarie-
street, wedged in between the Sydney Hos-
pital and the District, Court. On the massy
gates there is the legend “Royal Mint,
1855.” Within, you gaze on a stained-glass
portrait of Sir Isaac Newton, who, as every
schoolboy knows, was governor of the
Royal Mint in -the days of good King
Charles. In the surrounding desolate court-
yards you may sec the old and the ntew
inextricably mixed. High walls, with rust.v,
barred and grated windows, where once the
gold of the Mint was kept, with solemn
sentry pacing, Brown Bess on shoulder.
Mighty balconies and cedar staircases,
every stairpost minutely carved with the
Crown of England resting bn a cushion.
All the timber is splendid cedar—covered
with paint, in the old stupid way. Some
of the fanlights are rare examples of old
Georgian. Beyond are brick and stone ruins.
Australia gave up hoarding and went in
for “humanitarianism.” Came a day when
every little N.S.W. boy and girl born into
this world alive was to be entitled to a
grant of so much a week if its parents were,
or said they were, in need of the money.
The Royal Mint was metamorphosed into
the Family Endowment Department.
Imagine a Family Endowment Department
wedged into 50 rooms. There are chief
clerks’ rooms, first, second, third and ordi-
nary clerks’ rooms, magistrates’ rooms,
rooms for the commissioner, rooms devoted
solely to the recovery of “over-payments”
(sinister word!), rooms for auditors, ex-
aminers, inspectors and a hundred other
functionaries. The place resembles noth-
ing so much as a vastly overcrowded bee-
hive. For, after all, there is honey here—
plenty of honey—as people manifestly
know. Honey for parents, who are three
deep at the counters.
One dismal whitewashed enclosure is
known as “Room 25.” It is rather a great
hall, larger than many churches, and it has
rows and rows of clerks, mostly girls. The
typewriters and comptometers are deafen-
ing. At a barrier, behold the applicants:
poorly dressed, men, women and children,
mostly children; applicants for relief;
clients of depression; all after the “fiye shil-
lings a week for every child after the first.”
Placards are tacked up in scores of places.
This way to the auditors; this way to the
examiners; this way to the doctor; this
way to the over-payments room, to the
magistrates, to “inquiries.” Premises less
suited to economical management it would
be hard to find, for they are a constant suc-
cession of queer-shaped and assorted rooms,
either isolated by gigantic walls or rudely
connected, one to another, in makeshift
ways. (Yet in the grandiose Government
Savings Bank building, raised during the
boom, dozens of suites of offices have been
vacant from the day it was opened.) There
are piles of papers. Forms innumerable.
Form 63 and form 94 and form 2027. Every
second form is of the affidavit or declara-
tion genus; hence the magistrates. Every
endowment is heralded by the goose-step-
ping of a regiment of declarations, forms,
reports, certificates and magisterial in-
quiries.
When a mother applies for the five shil-
lings a week for her second and succeeding
infants, the husband must be reported on by
his employer in a confidential report. The
confidential report is form “23 5.0.” It con-
tains 17 questions, which the employer has
to fill in at his own peril, otherwise he
may be fined £5O. It may take him hours,
and he may have hundreds of reports to
supply, but he must keep on supplying them
to the little gods of endowment.
Question 12 is: “Did you allow the family,
free of charge, any flour, sugar, meat, milk,
butter, bread, vegetables, eggs, etc.? If so,
state quantity (in pounds, etc.) and weekly
value of each item; in the case of vegetables
and eggs, value only to be stated.”
Question 13: “Did he [the father, or it
may be the stepfather] sell any rabbits or
skins of any sort, or have any other in-
come?” It is not known to the wisest ot
men why Family Endowment is, by the de-
partment, regarded as inevitably intersecting
with rabbit skins, but it is.
Citizens who wish to observe how we
are governed, and where our taxes go, and
how poverty and need hang in clusters on
the State bosom, with perhaps not a little
imposition intermixed, should visit the
Family Endowment Department, once the
Mint.”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Token Payment.
Sydney’s “Labor Daily” informed its read-
ers in a page-wide caption of big black
letters that Britain had repudiated its debt
payment to the United States. The circum-
stances which gave the journal that impres-
sion were not similarly regarded by people
more intimately concerned with the trans-
action. The British Government paid
10,000,000 dollars in silver (roughly
£2,000,000 instead of about £19,000.000)
“as an acknowledgment of the debt pending
a final settlement.” The step was taken
after a consultation between Premier Mac-
Donald and President Roosevelt. Mr.
Roosevelt has been at pains to state that he
“does not characterise the resultant situ-
ation as a default.” The leader of the
British Labor party congratulated the Gov-
ernment, not on having repudiated an obli-
gation, but on having arrived at a “solution
satisfactory to Britain and the U.S.A.”
John Bull does not repudiate his debts.
Even when, as in the present case, he finds
himself involved in a bargain so fantasti-
cally inequitable that it cannot be fulfilled
his endeavors to put the matter on a fair
basis are of a sort that retain the
respect of his creditor. That the Baldwin
settlement was inequitable and impos-
sible of performance becomes clearer every
day. It was contrary to British policy, as
expressed in the Balfour Note, which recom-
mended putting a sponge clean over the
war-debts slate. As Britain was owed
£2,000.000,000 and owed only half that
amount, it cannot be said that the pro-
posal was prompted by self-interest. How-
ever, Bonar Law was sick; Baldwin’s j udg-
ment was lamentably at fault, and the
British nation was saddled with payments
extending over 60 years, aggregating close
on 11 thousand million dollars. A vicious
feature of the arrangement was that in the
second decade of payments the instalments
were substantially increased. It was on the
first of these increased instalments that
Bull decided to make a token payment.
In accepting it Mr. Roosevelt has shown
courage and magnanimity worthy of the
name he bears.
In pressing for an adjustment Bull goes
into court with clean hands. His own part
in actual war operations cost him a bit over
nine and a half thousand million pounds.
Of that amount he raised nearly three
thousand millions by taxation and five and
a half thousand millions by domestic loans.
The remainder he borrowed from Uncle
Sam. Bull has treated his European debtors
compassionately; their liability has been
whittled down to their means of payment,
and by the Lausanne agreement even this
small tithe of a vast debt has been tem-
porarily waived.
Revision of the war debts is long over-
due Exactly what terms may be con-
sidered fair in the world’s altered circum-
stances is a matter for argument, but it is
cogent to the problem to remark that while
in ~ the most heavily taxed State of the
U n i on —New York —Federal and State taxes
combined amount (or did in 1931) to
£lO 10s. per head, Britain pays £l5 125..
and most of the Dominions are somewhere
near the latter figure. Relief in this matter
will be shared by the Dominions, since
Britain has made it a rule to exact no more
in payment of war debts than is forced upon
it by the requirements of Samuel its creditor.


The Trade Balance and the Farmer.
The Federal U.A.P.’s and U.C.P.’s are at
loggerheads over the Tariff Bill. Senator
Hardy accused the Government of holding
back a Tariff Board report because it was
not in accord with the Ministry’s policy.
The U.C.P.’s allege the existence of a pre-
election lower-tariff agreement; the U.A.P.’s
won’t admit it. Now Senator Pearce has
promised that the recommendations of the
board will be made available to the Senate
before the third reading of the bill. Sena-
tor Hardy suggests that the report favors
a currency permanently depreciated exter-
nally and adjustment of duties accordingly.
Our trade figures are such that further
encouragement of imports would be a
danger. On the other hand, wool and wheat
prices being as they are, the farmer’s posi-
tion is precarious. It may be argued that
any increase in the tariff would add to his
burden, whereas a higher exchange would
give him a temporary bonus. Still, it must
be recognised that, with more and more
countries watering down their currencies,
raising the exchange would develop into a
sort of competitive inflation, which would
have evil consequences. If we are to main-
tain a favorable trade balance, this devalua-
tion of the currency is the one alternative
to a tariff in keeping with our internal
costs; but it is a clearly undesirable remedy.
Protection must not be used to shelter in-
efficiency or gratify greed, nor to establish
industries which, considering our relations
with our overseas customers, are not worth
while;- but salvation for the growers of
wool and wheat lies in increased prices, not.
in sweeping tariff reductions. While butter
prices kept up, dairy-farmers did not worry
a cent about the Scullin tariff.
We must pay our way overseas. Increases
in the exchange would, though helping to
curb imports, reduce customs revenue and
hit the Treasury in costs of remittance to
London. Substantial tariff increases would
dry up customs revenue, but remittance
costs would remain unaltered.
With a high exchange we are never likely
to have a favorable trade balance of any
size. For the farmer to get the benefit of
the exchange someone has to buy the Lon-
don funds; for them to be bought there
must be imports. The banks would not
carry large amounts of surplus London
money for which they paid at the rate of
£125 Australian for £lOO English if the rate
were likely to improve any day.

The Amended N.B.W. Constitution.
Dear Bulletin,— Precedent is against Arthur
Griffith (B. 7/6/’33). A free conference of
both Houses has always been provided for
by the Constitution, and the process could
not be circumvented by the Council short-
circuiting a bill. Never during its long
history has it sought to avoid meeting the
Assembly in conference. Section 150 of the
Constitution says both Chambers “shall pre-
pare and adopt Standing Rules and Orders
regulating the mode in which such Council
and Assembly shall confer” with each
other. True, Standing Orders may be but a
set of rules for carrying out the work of
Parliament, but they must not conflict
with the Constitution. A Standing Order
could not be passed to “prevent” the Houses
conferring.
In obedience to the section quoted the
Assembly passed S.O. 228: “A demand
for a conference with the Council shall
be by message and accompanied by a
statement of the general objects of the con-
ference demanded.” That S.O. gives the
Council no option but to confer, and it
cannot be altered in substance. And May
says: “Either House may demand a con-
ference upon matters which, by the usage
of Parliament, are allowed to be proper
occasions for such a proceeding.”
Precedent, the Constitution, Standing
Orders and May are against Mr. Griffith’s
contention. The ordinary decency which
might be expected from the new 60 mem-
bers would also be against it. After all, a
seat in the Leg. Council is an honorary
job, which makes a world of difference, and
can it be imagined that they would by
such a subterfuge seek to prevent the people
expressing their will, even on such a supreme
test as their own legislative existence?
According to some, the old Council was a
bad lot, but it never did that. —Yours etc.,
Simon Hickey.

The Cult of Cunning.
A London literary review which makes
weekly awards to those who have been
guilty of silly remarks handed the carrots
in a recent issue to the Rev. “Tubby”
Clayton, M.C., for “You can’t be brave
and clever.” Never was a rebuke more
undeserved. “Clever” has definitely become
a term of opprobrium in recent years, and
it never did stand high relatively to
“brave.” The fact is the world has been
well-nigh brought to its deathbed by
cleverness—meaning cunning; and it looks
as if nothing but bravery of a notable order
will save it.
The Versailles Treaty was an outstanding
example of political cleverness. It hum-
bugged the masses with as many illusory
promises as our own Lang Plan. French
politicians were clever when they bilked
foreign creditors of their country by de-
valuating the franc to a fifth of its value,
and paying on that basis. The contrast be-
tween bravery and cleverness was to be seen
in every country throughout the war.
Brave men and women served; clever ones
stayed at home or took back-area jobs.
Clever young men got decorations without
risking their skins, and clever old men made
money. The war ended, and
.... all the jostling foxes that creep out
From shelter now the danger-storm is past
proceeded to enjoy the jobs and fortunes
that the lions had made safe for them.
The world has literally been cursed with
cleverness during the past decade. An
astonishing amount of clever work is being
done in drama, fiction and poetry, painting,
sculpture and music, but hardly anything
that is brave in the sense that a poem by
Hardy or a play by Shakspeare is brave.
The deterioration is to be seen most clearly
in politics. Particularly in our own politics.
Has there ever before been a period in the
history of Australia when one of the mental
and ethical calibre of J. T. Lang could have
hoped to impose his will on half a million
electors, and be put forward as a possible
Labor Prime Minister? Lang epitomises the
kind of cleverness that was seen at a thou-
sand bases during the war. “I have been
young, and now am old,” said the Psalmist,
“yet have I not seen the righteous for-
saken, nor his seed begging bread.” If he
had lived in this age of brave men on the
dole and clever men with country estates
and liens over newspapers,•of Tammany
crooks in control of great political parties
and honest veterans declared unfit to be in
those parties, he would have expressed him-
self differently.

The Jury System.
Dear Bulletin, —When “Martro” argues
(B. 14/6/’33) that “12 men are more likely
to be right than one” he misses the
point. No one has suggested that one
Judge should be asked to decide on the
criminal cases that now go to juries, but
many hold that decisions by three Judges
would be as improvement on the present
system. There has been a social revolu-
tion since Blackstone said that “no man’s
life should be hazard except by the unani-
mous verdict of 12 of his fellows.” In
Blackstone’s time the death penalty was
prescribed for practically everything; nowa-
days it is prescribed for hardly anything.
in the last half-century juries—particularly
in Australia —have changed in character.
They used to represent the general intelli-
gence of the community, but the exemp-
tions provided for in the different State
Jury Acts have altered all that. In N. S.
Wales, for example, all those who, in the
nature of things, might be expected to
weigh evidence best and give uninfluenced
verdicts clergymen, barristers, solicitors,
doctors, bank managers and so on —are
never called on juries. An effect has been
to create what is virtually a jury class, and
another effect has been to create a class
of jury-squarers and -intimidators. This is
why in commercial cases—cases, namely, in
which each side thinks it has merits as a
rule—trial by jury is rapidly disappearing.
In criminal cases the jury system often
results in outrageous verdicts, such as the
one commented on by Macrossan, J., and
it often results also in equally outrageous
disagreements which put the community to
the expense of new trials. Incidentally,
English Judges, notably Mr. Justice Avory,
have rebuked juries in much the same
terms as the Queensland Judge used, and
heard nothing from the Lord Chancellor.
There is no analogy between trial by
three Judges and trial by a magistrate. In
at least 90 per cent, of police-court cases
the drunk, disturber of the peace, breaker
of the traffic laws or what not doesn’t
question the police evidence, for the good
and sufficient reason that it is demonstrably
true; when a police-court case is defended
the accused gets a verdict as often as in any
other kind of court.
The only objection, as a matter of practi-
cal commonsense, to trial in criminal cases
by three Judges is contained in “Martro’s”
suggestion that Judges, like juries, might be
squared or intimidated. Any calamity is
possible, of course, but that Judges in a
British community should prostitute their
jobs for gain or from fear is such a remote
chance that it is hardly worth considera-
tion.—Yours etc., Lex.
O
Garden the “Gradualist.”
J. S. Garden has explained to a Sydney
newspaper man that he is no longer a revo-
lutionist, but a “gradualist”; that he now
believes in unification as well as in J. T. Lang;
and that socialisation of credit is a pale-
pink brand of Communism to which not
even the most bigoted capitalist can take
exception. All Garden wants is control of
the Commonwealth and the right to use the
“security value” of all property to issue
national credit certificates. With this he
and his friends will build public works,
create employment and generally introduce
the millennium.
The new Garden scheme is in line with
the device by which Stalin and his Commis-
sars control the Russian proletariat, viz.,
an interlocking system of .withdrawable
workers’ tickets and internal workers’ cur-
rency which has no value outside the
U.S.S.R. Local currency in Russia can be
used for purchases only upon production
of a worker’s permit; so soon as a worker
has his ticket withdrawn, his Russian money
becomes valueless. The Garden plan is as
foreign to British thought as is violent
revolution itself. Anyone who attempts to
introduce this sort of “gradualism” is apt
to find himself hurled from a highly-mort-
gaged bridge. Not even the distribution
of "'a ton of Trades Hall currency certifi-
cates will save him from destruction when
small homeowners and retired civil-service
investors and old ladies with money in tea-
pots and a few shares in gas-company scrip
go after him.

The Modern Policeman.
Dear Bulletin, —Not only does the writer
of that article on the modern policeman
(B. 14/6/’33) fail to appreciate the essen-
tial differences between Continental, Eng-
lish and Australian systems, but he over-
looks the real defects of all British systems.
It is misleading to assert that in Berlin
'‘policemen in the higher ranks .hold the
qualifications and status of university pro-
fessors.” The Locards and Grosses of the
Continent are merely equivalent to the
Home Office experts behind Scotland Yard;
but whereas the Continental practice is to
attach them to the regular police and, for
purposes of propaganda, to give them all
the publicity possible, English custom de-
crees that they shall form a separate de-
partment and be shoved into the back-
ground.
The German police head possesses wide
legislative and judicial powers. His train-
ing doesn’t make him a better thief-taker,
but it does fit him to frame police ordin-
ances and regulations, and to fine and im-
prison without trial those members of the
public who contravene his ordinances. Lon-
don’s bobby and our John Hop are really
better educated than the average. French
gendarme or German polizeidiener; all
they lack are the instruction which the Con-
tinental policeman receives and the benefit
of the centralised system and extensive
powers in vogue on the Continent. British
methpds of training are woefully in-
adequate, and are concerned far too much
with the necessity for treating the public
with tact. The finer points of crime detec-
tion are ignored. These the cop either
never learns or learns simply in a haphazard
manner as he gains experience.
The success of the Continental police,
and particularly of the German and Aus-
trian forces, lies in the elaborate system of
centralisation. Every detective is a special-
ist, required to concentrate upon a particu-
lar branch of crime, first receiving a rigor-
ous course of practical training designed to
equip him for his future role. In Berlin
the blackmail squad would never dream of
investigating a murder, nor would the cat-
burglar squad try to elucidate a jewel theft.
British police are required to be jacks-of-
all-trades. They are given no adequate
training, are expected to possess an encyclo-
paedic knowledge, and are chopped and
changed from one type of investigation to
another. We’d never dream of asking a
blacksmith to mend a wristlet watch, but
We think nothing of asking a detective with
no head for figures to carry out a compli-
cated investigation into a company swindle.
Centralise the English and Australian police
systems, give the men intensive practical
training along centralised lines, keep them
abreast of modern scientific methods of
crime detection; and complaints would be
rare.
As for the combating of Communistic
propaganda, the secret lies in a more rigor-
ous examination before admittance, to the
force and a tightening-up of . discipline.—
Yours etc.. Henry Bateson.

Bodyline Howling.
The squabble between the Marylebone
Cricket Club and the Australian Board oi
Control has reached another futile stage.
The English authorities decline to admit
that the so-called bodyline bowling was
deliberate and an infringement of the spirit
of cricket, and hold that the proposed rule
to deal with it is impracticable—as was
evident to everyone except the misguided
individuals who framed it.
The M.C.C. has gone beyond the original
discussion, however, by criticising the board
for refraining from taking action to re-
strain barracking. It adds that, unless this
is stopped or moderated, a continuance of
cricket visits between the two countries
may be endangered. While barracking is
far from being an unknown quantity in
England, it must be admitted that during
the late unhappy tour it assumed a bitter-
ness unknown before. There were contri-
butory causes for which the board was in
no way to blame. Among them was the
glorification of noisy louts by misguided
newspapers. Columns of vulgar and sense-
less examples of alleged “humor from the
Hill” were published, and the result was
to encourage other louts. 111-mannered rub-
bish written by partisans on both sides—
some of the worst offenders were retired
cricketers —had even more unfortunate re-
sults.
The M.C.C. suggests that the question
of bodyline or leg-theory bowling be re-
ferred to an Empire Cricket Council, to
meet at some indefinite time in the future.
This affords the Board of Control an oppor-
tunity of retiring from the consequences of
its own tactlessness, and the British autho-
rities a means of saving any “face” which
it may appear they are likely to lose. All
the same, there should be no more inter-
national tours until the argument has been
settled on mutually satisfactory terms. Test
matches should be played in the old
friendly spirit or not at all.

Islands for Innovators.
Instead of playing about with conventions
and conferences and pacts, the nations might
well try to settle this question of depres-
sion and unemployment by direct action.
There are many islands scattered about the
world, islands which are composed of fer-
tile soil, islands which can boast a rainfall
ample for all agricultural production. We
have sufficient within a few days’ steam of
Australia to suffice for our experiments.
King Island, a dot between the Speck
and Victoria, seems to be getting along well
enough. Its half-yearly returns, just in,
show that its exports total £30,000,
while it has imported only £17.000 worth
of overseas merchandise. King Island may
be left to show the rest of the world that
the present social system cannot be im-
proved on.
But there is Norfolk Island. Let it be
handed over to the few hundred Commu-
nists in the Commonwealth with the injunc-
tion to do their best and let the world
know that a Communist society is the
thing. Lord Howe Island might be allotted
to the Douglasites and Kangaroo Island to
the Chomleyites. Up around Cape York
and the Barrier Reef there are enough
islands to supply every brand of economic
belief. There need be no fear that there
won’t be enough islands to go round;
island-making is another of those indus-
tries in which there is over-production. One
islet might even be conferred on Colonel
Eric Campbell and his New Guard.
The cost of giving all the innovators a
fair start, with shelter and tools of trade,
would be a fleabite compared with the
constantly-recurring expense of sending
delegates to eternal conferences in Europe.
When they were all set, the Prime Min-
ister or the Governor-General could fire his
starting pistol and tell them to go for their
lives.
Communication with the outside world
would have to be provided on request.
Some of the experimenters would doubtless
ask to be left alone. At the end of 12
months a Commonwealth official of ability
and probity might make a round of the
islands and embody his observations in a
report to Parliament.
Scientists don’t prove the efficacy of a
process or a cure by meeting and deliver-
ing long addresses, prepared by secretaries
who are instructed, above all, to say no-
thing that will commit anybody. They
work out their researches by plodding and
patient experimentation; Erlich and Sato
had 605 tries before they evolved salvar-
san. The only satisfactory and logical way
of testing economic theories is to follow
scientific methods. Even if we had to
settle 605 islands before we get results, _ it
would be cheaper at the price than paying
the salaries, passage money and hotel ex-
penses of politicians who jaunt to Europe
and America.
“M.G.”: Travellers appear to be at variance
as to whether Mussolini cleaned up Italy
or not. My experience is that the present-
day cleanness of the kingdom—whatever
it may be—is in no wise due to the actions
of the stunt artist now at the top. I first
visited Italy in 1903 and found it unpleas-
antly noisome. Naples, in particular, was
an abomination. I went back there in
1920 and was astounded at the transforma-
tion. Naples was endurable, while Rome,
Florence and Turin could be compared with
the average English or French or Austra-
lian cities. That was before the world had
heard of Mussolini. Rome was a picture
in every modern part, and that it was so was
due, not to any poseurs of the Duce type,
but to a little London Jew named Nathan,
who had become Mayor of the Eternal City
and started out to finish what Augustus be-
gan a thousand-odd years back. Nathan
was a live wire—a sort of H. D. Mclntosh
in energy and Henry Ford in organising
skill. When you look at modern Rome—
just as interesting as the ancient part,
though overlooked by most tourists—you
feel that the epitaph to Nathan might be
that of Christopher Wren. “If you seek
his monument, look around.”

“Westekn”: Jimmy Mitchell may not be
much of a politician, but he did find work
for the mobs of unemployed single fellows
who were hanging about Perth and Fre-
mantle. He employed some on an irri-
gation scheme at Harvey, others in
afforestation in several places, more in clear-
ing at Mt. Barker and the Margaret. Then
the general election arrived. The men had
votes. Offers of more money and less exer-
tion were made, and the bidders won. Now
there is great restiveness in the camps to
which the relief workers were drafted. Men
are contracting the habit of going to Perth
“to see Kenneally.” Kenneally being the
Minister. Those who haven’t fares, or say
they haven’t, “jump the rattler.” The Rail-
way Department is concerned about it, for
its finances are in a distressful state; but
the men, having been told what to expect,
are intent on getting it.

“J. 8.”: A train recently crashed into a car
at the Warwick Farm level crossing, just
outside Sydney’s sprawling metropolitan
railwajr system, and four lives were lost.
In all the States level-crossing deathtraps
take a dreadful toll, and if you set only
the economic value to the community oi
the citizens thus sacrificed against the cost
of furnishing adequate protection, it would
be cheaper to have them guarded. Let
our railway departments place returned
soldiers or Diggers’ widows in charge of
busy level crossings, building wooden
houses for them on railway reserve land.
With such guardians on duty, and with
proper lighting, there would be no more of
these. appalling accidents, except in cases
where drivers are incorrigibly reckless or
start out laden with beer.

POLITICAL
POINTS
As in the case of Bulli, 50 Laugsters
could be nominated for Annandale without
the slightest danger of losing the seat; but
the Inner Group again picked the candi-
date in the sacred name of democracy. Its
choice fell on Alderman Gorman, mayor of
Glebe. Alderman Mulcahy, of the City
Council, was supposed to be in the running,
but Alderman Mulcahy, ex-Minister Tully
and ex-Whip Cahill withdrew. Mulligan
was unavailable.
There is an impression at Canberra that
i lie Lyons Government will go to the coun-
try this year. Significance is attached to the
rush of party leaders to Queensland, and
the superstitious see confirmation of a sort
in Perkins’s visit to the N.T. The last three
holders of his particular portfolio lost it soon
after undertaking this trip, in two cases
as a result of an unexpected election. Since
Parliament moved to Canberra, no Govern-
ment has had a full three-year term.
An eloquent postscript to the Disarma-
ment Conference is the intention of the
U.S.A., announced last week, to set in hand
a new naval-building programme, planned to
launch 32 vessels in three years at a cost of
48 million pounds. The new programme is
the answer to Japan’s intention to hold a
huge naval mobilisation in the Western Paci-
fic this year. Now Japan is out with a
three-year programme to cost 460 million yen.
And the yen, which used to be worth 2s. Id.
English—a .bit more in fact—is now quoted
at a trifle over Is. 3d.
Lyons took his courage in both hands
when he left his Canberra fastness for a
tour of Queensland. The northern State
has proved an unchancy place for some
Prime Ministers. Much of Joseph’s time will
“Off to Queensland, eh? Then don’t go
west of Warwick — they’ve emus’ eggs
there.”
be spent in the sugar towns, where he is
likely to hear some plain speaking. The
tobacco planters will also have a few words
to say when he visits Mareeba.
Lang doubtless decided in his borrowing
days that “Advance, Australia Fair,” should
be the national anthem. The very title had
an inspiriting sound; and before.lie. turned
defaulter he induced the capitalists to
advance his section of Australia about
£25,000,000. Now, while Lang is about, the
blighters won’t advance Australia a penny.
.June 15 was tin' day on which war-debts
payments to the U.S.A. fell due. France,
Belgium and five other countries paid no-
thing, and did not even tell Uncle to call in
December. Britain weighed in with
10,000,000 dollars, Italy with 1,000,000,
Finland with 148,592 (the lot) and Latvia
with 6000: 11,154,592 dollars out of
143,605.000 due. Before the storm of Sena-
torial invective burst on him, President
Roosevelt announced that contributions
would be thankfully accepted in silver at 50
cents an ounce. The London price on Thurs-
day was Is. 9d.
Victoria’s application to the Loan Council
for special leave to raise £200,000 for bulk-
handling was coldly received. “You’ll get
your share of the loan-works money,” the
other parties to the Loan Council said in
effect; “take it out of that.” Melbourne
Harbor Trust is willing to construct the
terminal equipment at Melbourne and Gee-
long on certain conditions. Acceptance of
this offer would lessen by about one-third
the outlay by the State, which is estimated
at ten times the £200,000 proposed to be
spent in 1933-34.
According to Bulcock, the Queensland
Minister of Agriculture, the legislation for
butter marketing placed before the Pre-
miers’ Conference will form the basis for
other marketing schemes. The plan provides
for an export quota; apart from that no-
body understands it, and everybody inter-
prets its provisions in different ways.
The Westralian A.L.P. wants all Leg.
Councils abolished ; the Senate, too. Judging
by the referendum vote, most of its adherents
are secessionists, but on the secession issue
it is strictly neutral. Meanwhile the N. S.
Wales section of the party and F'organ Smith
in Queensland are preaching Federal-party
unity, and a unity conference is about to be
held in Sydney. The Langstcrs in N. S.
Wales and South Aus. are not to be repre-
sented at the unity conference, but that
won’t prevent the conference proudly an-
nouncing that unity has been achieved.
Nothing could be stupider than the Lyons
Government’s handling of the delicate situa-
tion created by the great Westralian vote
for secession. The setting up of a Grants
Commission was the feeblest substitute for
an honest effort to strike at the causes of
discontent. And now the Government must
go and leave Westralia without a represen-
tative on its commission, and give the chair-
manship to a Melbourne lawyer-politician
who has written severely about Westralian
finance.
Daladier, the French Prime Minister, made
a great impression when the chinwagging
had fairly started at the Economic Confer-
ence by compressing his remarks into eight
minutes. His pithy speech took all the shine
out of delegates who had prepared elaborate
orations, and his example has been widely
commended. But it was lost on some of the
Senators who talked about the tariff last
week; two burbled for upwards of an hour
apiece and another for just on 50 minutqs.
An hour is supposed to be the limit,
and it is ridiculously long. There is a lot
more meat in the average leading article
than there is in the average contribution
to a Parliamentary debate, yet an “Age” or
“S. M. Herald” leader can be read out, at
a slow speaker’s rate, in ten minutes. At
least 80 p.c. of the stuff preserved in the
seven “Hansards,” at a cost of £BO,OOO p.a.
or so, is superfluous.
Napoleon started as First Consul with a
sort of Parliament which might suit Aus-
tralia. It was laid down in the Constitu-
tion that “the tribunate shall discuss mea-
sui’es, and propound them to the legislative
senate, but not vote; the legislative senate
shall hear the tribunate, and vote, but not
debate.” Spoutcrs in one House, thinkers
in the other. One of the new States might
try it.
Beyond arranging for the acceptance of
Treasury bills to cover State deficits for
1933- up to £8.500,000, and for the rais-
ing of another £17.346,000 for loan works,
the Premiers did nothing at the Melbourne
conferences, though they talked a lot. The
proposal for a convention to suggest amend-
ments of the Commonwealth Constitution
was stunned when it first made its appear-
ance, and it did not recover consciousnes.
Instead of the convention, a “special con-
ference” of Premiers is to be held early in
1934 — probably in Hobart. Hobart is a
charming place, and you can have a glorious
holiday there in midsummer, especially if
other people pay for it. The old Federal
Council used to meet at' Hobart every two
years until February, 1897, and eat scollops,
fried trumpeter, strawberries (or rasp-
berries) and cream and drink Cascade beer.
More loans for public works, and there will
be still more when the 17-odd millions have
been spent! In the domain of employment
the urgent thing is to get men and women
back in the jobs with which they are
familiar, and which they will do with a good
heart. Looking beyond the immediate pre-
sent, this process can only be hindered by
putting the men on relief works, which give
out in a few months, and on which, with all
the goodwill in the world (and goodwill is
apt to be lacking when men trained for
indoor callings are turned loose with picks
and shovels), they cannot earn nearly as
much as they did in their old billets. Every
increase of unproductive debt reduces the
capacity of their old bosses to re-employ
them.
Particulars of another Russian loan are
advertised in the “Moscow News.” The
Soviet’s own certificate currency is no good
for investment in the issue: Stalin will accept
nothing but gold on the basis of 0.774234
grams to the rouble. The term of the loan is
ten years, during which it will be cleared by
a series of redemption drawings. Principal
and interest are to be exempt from taxation:
interest is 10 p.c.. and the first coupon is cut
as on Dec. 1, 1932. In effect, any comrade
who takes a few hundreds out of the sock
to help the second Five-year Plan may do
so in the happy consciousness that the paper
he buys has been earning the highest rate
of interest in the world for him for lo
months before he owned it.
The Senate was brightened up the other
day by some exchanges between Pearce and
Johnston, each of whom hotly accused the
other of being a trimmer. It is a subject
with which both Senators should be familiar,
for each started as a Laborite and each has
since sampled pretty well every brand of
polities there is. Perhaps for this reason
nobody else intervened in the dispute
between the pot and the kettle.
Nobody seems anxious to send a delega-
tion to Russia this year. It was intended
to dispatch ten representatives, including one
from the N. S. Tramway Union, but £lOO6
is required, and there is only about £27 4s.
“Mr. Lang intends visiting the north to attempt
to stabilise Mr. Baddeley’s position in the affections
of the electors of Cessnoek.”
“I assure you, friends, she’s still beautiful
and faithful, and if you love me, friends,
you’ll love her.”
7ld. in sight. Still it might be a good thing
to get Mr. Badly out of the way for a while.
Mr. Badly was a Friend of Russia in other
years.
N.S.W. Education Minister Drummond,
speaking in Melbourne, deplored the pre-
ponderance of power in Australian affairs
held by N. S. Wales, and argued that it
should be divided into three. Victorians
would be glad to see N. S. Wales cut up,
but would like the Riverina for themselves.
A properly-balanced Riverina State would
really take in a big lump of north-eastern
Victoria. The Murray would roughly run
down the centre of such a. State: its water-
shed would be the boundaries. Unfortunately,
the rough nature of the eastern end would
interfere with access to the sea ; otherwise
Eden would make . an ideal capital. Ben
Boyd saw the possibilities of the peninsula
at Twofold Bay a century ago, but planned
his town in the wrong place. He failed to
realise to what extent shipbuilding would
develop. In those days an ocean liner drew
about as much water as a modern yacht
draws, and, naturally, he sought the shallows.
Lang’s control of the N.S.W. “Labor
Daily” is threatened by the Miners’ Federa-
tion. That concern talks of demanding a
debenture for £19,000, to cover unsecured
loans and unpaid interest. Lang holds a de-
benture for £13,764. According to the great
Bondy JHoare, the miners have put £33,000
into the concern, iu oneway and another, and
“we come in after Mr. Lang.” In effect,
“Lang got in before the miners, and his
£13,764 is excluded from all present and
future moratoriums of the father of mora-
toriums —J. T. Lang.” All the same, iu
condemning the Auburn capitalist this
gentleman condemns himself. In their daily-
newspaper enterprises the Miners’ Federa-
tion and the A.W.IJ. have played ducks and
drakes with the workers’ money.
Justices Davidson and Street have de-
cided, in separate cases, that members of
Lang’s Metropolitan Meat Board and Con-
ciliation Commission who were told that
Stevens had no further use for them are
entitled to salaries, less financial-emergency
cuts, for the unexpired portions of their
terms. Scott, the Meat Board chairman,
was awarded £7OOO and the eonciliationists
will cut up £14,350 among them; the. full
bill may reach £25,000. They were all poli-
tical appointments, and most people would
consider the gentlemen handsomely treated
if they had been given six months’ salary and
legislatively barred from getting more. The
reason advanced for retiring the conciliation
chaps was that they hadn’t enough to do to
keep them warm. But tho question of com-
pensation was fumbled with and then left
open. There are some clumsy fellows, iu
Stevens’s Ministry.
Invited to join the Vic. Cocky party, ex-
Premiel’ Hogan gave his reply at a publid
meeting in his electorate, and, it was indefi-
nite. He said he was free to. form a party, ,
or to join any party except Labor, and if
the Agrarians would cease to be sectional iie
could see in them a means of saving the
country from Trades Hall and Nat. Fed. ex-
tremists. The C.P. had expected something;
much more positive; a north-east district
unit of it, friendly with Ned, had told the
Parliamentary group that all it had to do
was to ask him to join and it would get him.
Hogan will now have to knock at the door
if he wants to enter.
Queensland’s Industrial Court, which has
been hearing stacks of applications for higher
wages since it was reconstituted, has got some-
thing from the other side. The C.S.R. has asked
for the deletion of the preference clauses,
in eight different awards on the ground that
they are bad at law: the industries con-,
cerned are sugar, sawmilling, mechanical
engineering, bridge, wharf and pier con-
struction, building trades and electrical
engineering, all State-wide, and, in the
Northern Division, baking and pastry-cook-
ing. Meanwhile, the combined trade-unions
are requesting the Court to reduce the
standard working hours from 44 hours to 30
per week, and retain pay on the 48-hour
basis. Their advocate, Carroll, is stressing
•‘the imperative necessity of absorbing unem-
ployed workers into industry.” The employers
will doubtless urge that paying 48-hour
wages for 30 hours’ work would leave pre-
cious little industry to be absorbed into.
Queensland’s Mines Minister Stopford
has called a conference to consider the state
of the coal industry. Output and / export
have fallen away in the past two or three
years, by 38 per cent in the first case, and
45 per cent, iii the second. Price stabilisa-
tion is the suggested remedy. Stabilisation
is a blessed word.
Since the days of Kyabram, Victoria has
never forgotten that it is the mother of move-
ments. It has now given birth to one in
Stawell, where the town council has opened
a State-wide campaign for reduction of taxa-
tion. The councils are taking to the scheme
like a carpet-snake to milk; last week five
of them in the Melbourne suburbs passed
resolutions of support for the hardy pioneers.
“By praying and fasting for 80 hours, Rev. A. K.
White has lifted a debt of £200 on St. John’s
Church, Albany (W.A.).”
“Don’t see no points in this prayin’-and-
fastin’ racket, sister. Lemme give you
something out of a bottle to sustain
you.”
Up till 1891 appointments to' the Maoriland
Leg. Council were for. life. Now they are
for seven years, with provision for renewal.
The Chamber started'in 1854 with 16 mem-
bers ; it had its biggest muster roll —53 —in
ISB6. It had dwindled to 20 in 191 S. when
Massey had 18 new men appointed. Subse-
quent Governments have been sparing of
new appointments, and the membership is
now 21. The terms of three have just ex-
pired ; four more are due to retire next
year, five more in 1935. six in 1937, two in
1938 and the last in 1940. Doubtless many
of these members will be reappointed, but
none of them are youngsters, and the policy
seems to be established that vacancies caused
by death are not to be filled. Election of
members is provided for in an Act of 1914.
but the Act does not become operative till a
date for the new regime is fixed by Proclama-
tion. There’s been no Proclamation, and
very little agitation for it.

the open is the only thing that matters. The
last shock of any consequence in file Yass
and Gunning (N.S.W.) district occurred in
the early morning, when a lady was test-
ing her bathwater with her toe. The
sudden rocking of the house threw her into
a paroxysm of terror and she left for safety
just as she was. Recalled to her senses by
the horrified shrieks of some neighbors, she
found herself on the broad highway clad in
nothing at all, with a cake of soap clutched
in one hand and a sponge in the other. As
the neighbors who did the shrieking were
all scantily covered themselves and too
terrified to venture indoors to seek further
supplies, they hastily enveloped the dazed
new arrival in the horse-cover.
“Bert the Carpenter”: A Japanese
freighter was chartered to load scrap iron
and wheat at a S. Aus. outport. Owing to
a clerical error the iron proved to be 100
tons short, and it was decided to top up the
hold which held it with an additional 100
tons of wheat. But dunnage would have to
be laid over that jagged iron. “My carpenter
no can do,” said the skipper. “You do. Ship
pay.” I was engaged to lay down the dun-
nage, and the wheat was stowed on top of
my timbering. But when the next Jap
freighter called in to lift a similar cargo
the ship’s carpenter had a plan to work to;
over the scrap iron was laid an exact copy
of my dunnage, stick for stick! All the
wharfies recognised it, for I had used what
timber was available; it included a lot of
odd-sized stuff which the Japs evidently
thought was necessary. Imitative is the
right word !
* * *
“Wild Bill” : The Sydney police exhibited
that heap of firearms taken from criminals
and otherwise acquired (B. 14/6/’33). Most
interesting perhaps was an old “pepper-box”
revolver, one of the first of its kind devised
by the ingenious American. In this the
barrel and tumbler with its six chambers
are in one. Its drawback was that in the
percussion-cap days it was apt to go off, all
six barrels at once, the flash from one cap
igniting all the others round the cylinder.
This, while effective on the target, was awk-
ward for the firer if he desired to have a
shot or two in reserve, and the contraption
soon went out of favor.
“Black Elliott”: Why will “Copelen” (B.
14/6/’33) and others of a like turn of mind
insist on confusing the true Scot with the
Highlander? The Highlander is a Celt, like
the Southern Irishman, the Welshman and
the Breton; the Lowland Scot is an Anglo-
Saxon, the purest of the breed surviving to-
day. He is not, and never was, “a son of
the tartan,” that cubist material and the
garments manufactured from it being purely
Celtic. The superstition that all Scotsmen
are kilt-wearers by instinct is on a par with
the belief that whisky is a Scottish beverage.
It was never drunk in Lowland Scotland
until a. little over 100 years ago, save as a
curiosity. It was introduced as an ingre-
dient of toddy in towns like Edinburgh and
Glasgow. In the country the gentrice of
that day drank claret from France, and the
farmers and peasantry good Scottish ale,
which they brewed themselves. If spirit was
called for, it was French brandy.
“Breek”: “Copelen” overstates the case
when he asserts, that Shetlanders are-“nearly
pure Scandinavian in race.” Certainly they
have a Scandinavian page in their past his-
tory, but it was only for a few centuries—in
the matter of ownership at all events. Accord-
ing to the historians one Magnus 111., King
of Norway, conquered the Orkneys and Shet-
lands in 1099 after acquiring the Isle of
Man by the same process. But the Scottish
isles went back to Scotland in 1469 as the
dowry of the princess who married James
111. There are traces of Norwegian occu-
pation in these islands yet, but there are
even more ancient Pictish ones in the so-called
“brochs” or towers. Some of the most
Scottish Scots I have ever known have
hailed from these parts.

“Monsoon”: These periodical paragraphs
about short-distance drinking contests and
chaps who can swallow pints of beer while
standing on their heads remind me of a
marathon toper, a stayer of real note, whom
I once encountered. He wasn’t a navvy,
either, but a retired medico, who must have
known more about his own liver than is
good for any son of Pantagruel to know.
Ho would take his stand in his favorite
corner of a Perth saloon bar—it was gener-
ally left for him, as a particular armchair
for a club fogey—and there, morning, noon
and up to closing-time, you would invariably
sight him. He drank in leisurely but deter-
mined fashion, with a long, steady stroke
that promised results, but never gave any
outtfara ones that I could see. He had no
rooted objection to being shouted for,
although' he never failed to return the compli-
ment, and he would converse amiably enough
with casual acquaintances on any subject,
from the policy of Chamberlain to the
newest cure for rheumatism. As far as one
could judge, he had few intimates and no
enemies; his business was drinking, and he

allowed nothing to interfere with it. He
was always one of the first arrivals in the
morning, anti invariably one of the last out
at night. On Fridays and Saturdays he
sometimes appeared a trifle the worse for
his exertions, but after the Sunday interval
he would reappear like a giant refreshed.
And this not merely for weeks or months,
but for years. I suppose he must be dead
long since; I wonder if he has a verse from
Omar on liis tombstone.
“D.” : The gay world of Sydney—if one
can call it gay—has acquired a new class
of revellers. They spend money, but are
obviously unused to the experience, and their
clothes look odd even to the far-from-May-
fairish lads and lasses who get most of the
publicity in the social columns of our dailies.
Guards’ ties, with purple shirts and black-
and-white golf shoes, and so on. They are
depression profiteers. Say a man has saved
£5OO. He buys a bankrupt stock ori-
ginally worth £l5OO for a third of that
figure, and sells it for, perhaps, £BOO. Or
he may be satisfied with £7OO, or even less.
Such operations, repeated often enough,
bring iu a lot of money. People will pay
cash for almost anything, even in these hard
times, if the prices are sufficiently loav.
Night clubs and dance restaurants are the
favorite stamping-grounds of depression pro-
fiteers. Many Avould cause Hitler to go off
the deep end if they were so rash as to
visit the Fatherland.
“Aladdin” : A get-rich-quick enterprise of
a sort that had a short run in Sydney has
reared its head in Auckland. The prospectus
mentions that the co. has a capital of
£9OOO fully paid, but doesn’t disclose the
names of directors or managers. It offers
“shareholders” an income of £l5OO a year for
a subscription of one quid—you pay it, and
are given four more one-pound shares to sell.
Each of the purchasers is in turn expected
to sell four shares. As soon as you have
sold your four shares you get 10s. back. As
soon as your four purchasers have sold their
16 shares they each get 10s. and you draw an-
other 305.; as soon as the 16 new purchasers
have sold their shares, you get £6, the four
you sold to get 30s. each, and the 16 they
sold to get 10s. each. At this stage of the
transaction the co. has received £75 and
paid out £24. As the thing goes on expand-
ing. by “powers of 4,” as the mathematician
says, Avealtli untold rolls in upon all parties.
But there’s a limit to it. alas! The popu-
lation of the world is about 2,000,000,000,
and this number is used up before the trans-
action is in its teens.
“Cosmos”: Mrs. Ada Holman writes (B.
7/6/’33) that she is willing to endure the
smells of Naples for, amongst other things,
the Aquarium. The establishment in the
Via Caracciolo was all the rage quarter of
a century ago, but it has slumped badly
since. Any Sydneyite who. . after reading
Mrs. Holman’s burning words, expects,_ on
visiting Naples, to find an aquarium equal
in any respect to the one at Sydney’s Taronga
Park Avill be disappointed. The best that can
be said is that it is less dark, dank, de-
serted and generally depressing than most
English aquariums. The fish were patheti-
cally few and uninteresting when I visited
it last, and I was foolish enough to pay five
lira to get in (more than double the Taronga
charge) and four lira for a catalogue, which
isn’t necessary at Taronga owing to the
descriptive legends on the tanks. Where
Naples has cause for pride is in the physio-
logical, morphological and chemical labora-
tories to which the aquarium forms an
annexe. Aquariums are things that Euro-
pcans don’t do well. When I was a
child they arose like mushrooms all over
England, but most of them quickly became
vaults of dark and echoing loneliness. Per-
haps the gloomiest of the lot was the old
Westminster Aquarium, which, before it be-
came a vaudeville house, with sideshows like
pea-rifle ranges and boxing kangaroos, had
got down to less than a dozen fish!
“Oxmead”: Whether he knew it or not,
the bard who dug up “sonly” as a rhyme
for “Unley” (B. 7/6/’33) was resurrecting
what was probably a fine old Saxon word
rather than inventing a new one. We
say “fatherly,” “motherly,” “sisterly,”
“brotherly”; why should the Latin deriva-
tive “filial” have superseded “sonly” and
“daughterly”? I wouldn’t mind betting that
a diligent prospector could find both the
latter in Piers Plowman strata. North of
the Border he probably would find them
even more easily. Webster says that “sonly”
(= “filial”) is an obsolete Scottish word.
“Bulliouist”: Next time the British
Empire stages a conference it might be as
well to settle the wrangle between tlie Eng-
lish and Australian mints. Maorilaud uses
English-minted sliver coins, and though these
contain less silver than the Australian pro-
duct the M.L. Government lives in a fever of
apprehension lest someone carry parcels
to Australia and make a profit out of th •
variation in exchange value. That variation
is so small nowadays that smuggling ought
to be on the wane, and in all probability
it stopped months ago. But the other day
the Wanganella’s passengers at Wellington
were subjected to a five hours’ gruelling.
Every nook and cranny of their luggage was
searched by rough-looking individuals who
came aboard disguised as “members of the
crew.” As the passengers’ luggage yielded
no contraband the crew’s kits were searched.
A haul was made, and four seafarers were
arrested. Some of the poor blighters had
been saving it up ever since a merry compe-
tition in tbe depreciation of currency became
a pastime of John Bull and his Dominions.
The only effective way to deal with this sort
of thing is for an Imperial Conference to
declare that all traffic in exchange is illegal,
which ivould paralyse commerce, or that
Gresham’s Law must be allowed to operate.
Attempts to defeat it have been common in
the past, but despite the most savage penal-
ties they have never been successful.

“0.P.H.”: Prior to 1926, K.B.’s, qnlike
the higher-grade sirs, had no insignia to show
at levees and such. In that year the King was
graciously pleased to institute a badge (gilt
sword and spurs on a vermilion oval medal-
lion) for them, a blunt intimation being
added (from the Dominions Office) that the
K.B.’s would not get such adornments “at
the public expense.” They are manufactured
at the Mint, and are obtainable only in
London; the price is seven guineas. So

THE PATRIOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Lang sharply rebuked people at Lidcombe
for their tardiness in rising and removing their hats
when the band struck up ‘Advance, Australia Fair.’ ”
For ceremonial forms lie’s scarce a stickler;
To most conventions he’s the last to cling;
He’d tell you straight he sets no store
partic’lar
On “Rule, Britannia!” or “God Save the
King!”
But oh! it lashes him to wrathful candor,
It jars upon his sense of comme il faut,
It gets his goat and agitates his dander,
He’s apt to go off pop—if chaps are slow
Their legs to straighten and their heads to
bare r
When bands exude “Advance, Australia
Fair.”
What though he managed nothing to advance
it
Or to involve his land in aught but loss;
What though ’twas just a retrogressive
transit
For poor old New South Wales when he
was boss;
Still, none the less, the pious aspiration
. Tears to his patriotic eyes will start,
The melody infuses exaltation
Into the inmost cockles of his heart.
His stinging whiplash falls on all who dare
Sit recreant to “Advance, Australia Fair.”
What though he left our credit badly busted,
Our reputation soiled and queered our
pitch,
And not a few (including those who trusted
His plausible professions) in the ditcli;
What though, before he marched to. his
Megiddo,
He pampered parasites, and left unpaid
The suffering pensioner, the hapless widow,
The stalwarts of the 10 to 4 brigade;
His soul still leaps within him at the air
And verses of “Advance, Australia Fair.”
Why, though he broke a bank and split a
party,
And why, for all the devious plots he
planned,
Should he not nourish an affection hearty,
A love abiding, for his native land?
Queer ways of showing it, you’ll say, he’s
taken,
And of solicitude displayed a deal.
More for his own (and his adherents’)
bacon
Than for the general good, the common
weal.
But when the merry bandsmen skyward
blare
The. measure of “Advance, Australia Fair,'’
Spring to your tails, my lads—if Lang is
there!

Betty-oh’: Auntie-wilh-expectauons, wo
called her, but it was we who had the expee-
tations—before her last visit, anyhow, when
she proved more of a trial than usual She
criticised everyone and everything, told Jim
not to treat her Rolls-Royce as though it were
a Ford, and won young Bill’s undying hatred
by declaring that his foxie pup ought to be
drowned. Spot having torn the fur oft one
of her slippers. Mum had arranged a fare-
well party before her departure, but, the,
guest of honor being unable to attend, v
proved a washout “Neuralgia,” we were told,
but we guessed there was more m it than
that when snatches of conversation between
our revered parents reached our ears....
“The children would never dare”.... “Do
you think it might have been a magpie ? They
are such thieves •• • • Magpie be damned
•.... ‘D? very mysterious, anyhow. Next
day auntie left: Jim looking glum, at the
wheel and auntie beside him, her head swathed
in veils. Mum was weepy and worried and
dad volcanic, so we went off down the pad-
dock to hunt rabbits. Spot brought some-
tiling that lie had scratched up on the rner
bank and laid it at his master s feet. As
Bill picked’ up the pink-and-wlnte object
a great light dawned upon us. It was a top
set of artificial teeth.

“Exdig”: Horses as well as donkeys (B.
7/6/’33) are sometimes all the better for
a rum issue. The road between Voormezecle
and the Bluff, near Ypres, was being
drenched with shells, and the game driver
of a double limber laden with essential
rations and with imperative orders for their
delivery found his horses unwilling to face if.
IN THE INTERVAL.
“Will this orchestra play something by request?’
“Of course.”
“How about asking it to play bridge?”
From the cover a group of us had taken, we
watched his struggles with ncddi“s that
pulled back and twisted round and did every-
thing but move forward. Suddenly he got
them going, and there was some brisk betting
about his chances of winning through. With
the horses pulling like mad, he would dis-
appear, as it seemed, right into a sliellbursj:,
and presently emerge from the smoke and
dust, still going strong. It was a fine dis-
play of courage and determination; and
although he couldn’t hear us we gave him a
cheer as he disappeared around the Bluff.
Afterwards we learned that (lie driver, at
his wit’s end, had broached a S.R.D., forcing
a liberal issue of rum down the throat of
each of his charges. Evidently after that
they didn’t care if it rained shells.
“S.T.S.”: The old paddle-steamer Jupiter,
after long service up and down the Murray
and the Darling, has been worked out
through the difficult river-mouth and round
to Port Adelaide. There she is being con-
verted into a floating hotel for anything up
to 10,000 crayfish waiting for the market.

“Jeviel”: In the talkie “To-day We Live”
many of the properties are as ludicrous as
the plot. The fast torpedo launches shown
skittling German cruisers in 1916 are of a
type developed only a couple of years ago.
The bomber in which Gary routs Richthofen s
“jagstaffel” is one of Uncle Sam’s latest,
bearing post - war
U.S.A. service mark-
ings ; and the famous
•staffel itself is pre-
sented as a group of
nervous novice pilots
firing blanks. The
shots showing Fokker
and 5.E.5 formations
and the exploding
ammo. dump have
been rehashed from
“Hell’s Angels.” If
Hollywood must throw
in an airtight on slight
provocation, let’s at
least have a new one.
“Weft”; One hates
to criticise a patriot,
but it seems to me
that Senator John-
ston, of the Golden
State, has let himself
in for something with
boiling oil in it. De-
fending secesh in the
Senate, he suddenly
unfurled, in the man-
ner of the Stars and
Bars being flung to the
breeze at Fort Sum-
ter, the Union Flag
(not “Jack,” if you
please!) with a black
swan superimposed on
the triple crosses, and
announced that this
was Westralia’s new
banner. Now it is a
serious offence to vary or alter the national
flag without royal authority, and it is doubt-
ful if Senator Johnston has obtained, this.
Tilings may go hard with him if the minions
of the Federal octopus tumble to his lapse.
“0.11. F.” : Lightning may not strike twice
in the same place, but burglars are less con-
siderate. During recent months the safe
of the Westport Coal Go. in Christchurch
(M.L.) has been broken into about half a
dozen times. A large display notice was
affixed to the door: “Burglars, please note!
No cash has been kept in this safe for years.
It contains books only. All you can get
out of this is twelve months' hard!'' Beneath
was drawn a pair of hungry-looking hand-
cuffs. Despite this warning the safe has
again been broken, and if the burglars got
no money they haven’t so far collected the
“time.”
“Aurum”: The
ri s e in gold
values lias been
responsible for
more than a
flavor of wist-
f u 1 romance.
One of the big
Melbourne buy-
ers lias been
telling an inter-
viewer about

One woman in
a pitiful letter asked that the buyer should
send her a brass ring, purchased from the
proceeds of the gold one.

“Waiowai”; My experience is that'most
of the little gals are Liberals and prac-
tically all the little boys Conservatives.
My ten-year-old shares with all of his
contemporaries with whom I have come into
contact a distrust of innovations. His clothes,
his school-bag', his bicycle and everything that
is his must be exactly the same as that of
every other little boy. My attempts, and
those of his school-teachers, to improve his
treatment of the English tongue arc ham-
pered by the intuitive conviction of his set
that correct diction is an unworthy affecta-
tion. My young daughter, on the other
hand, is by nature an innovator. Her aim
in attire is to be different; in conversation,
to be able to contradict every statement
offered; in language and deportment, to con-
stitute herself a reproach to a lax and easy-
going world. The puzzle of it is that the
boy has much more originality and imagina-
tion in his mind than the girl has.

“Jermyn Street”: Loyalty is a muddled
affair in Australia. J. T. Lang- lectured
some Sydneyites the other day for not stand-
ing up when the band played “Advance, Aus-
tralia Fair” —a ditty which is unknown to
many Australians, and is rarely heard out-
side’N. S. Wales. On last King’s Birthday
HELPING DAD.
DAD: “There’s'one thing about you, Mabel. You never let me oversleep and miss my
train the nights you go to parties.”
DAUGHTER: “Suppose I go out every night, old darling. Then you’d never miss your
tram.”
no flags flow over Government buildings,
clubs and the like in Sydney. The R.A.N.
alone took cognisance of it by dressing ships
and firing a royal salute. The 11.A.N. conies
under King’s Regs., which lay down that the
King’s Birthday shall be honored irrespective
of the day on which it falls. The loyalists
of Sydney ignore the King’s Birthday when
it falls on a holiday, and postpone it to a
day which isn’t normally a holiday, thus
getting in an extra day’s racing. But the
strangest of all distortions of the loyalist
principle is the attitude of a number of
clamant Empire men towards the Governor-
General. I have in mind a Royal
Navy man who held a big position here.
He refused to. go to Commonwealth
Government House (as many super-loyalists
are still doing), and spoke in terms of the
utmost scorn of the G.-G.—not as a man,
of course; merely as an Australian. He con-
sidered that this job should be reserved for
his fellow-countrymen. Yet the G.-G. isn’t
Isaac Isaacs, Australian; he is the King’s
representative. When you flout him you
perpetrate the very gaffe that the Diggers
who refused to salute officers during the war
were so often condemned for by R.jN. offi-
cers—that of slighting the King.
“Morehead”: A letter delivered at The
Bulletin office last week was addressed
to the “Editor, ‘Wild Oats,’ 252 Georgc-street,
Sydney.” The “Wild Cat” editor said it was
for him. There was once a paper known
as “Wild Oats”—a comic journal, published
in New York in the ’sixties, and Livingston
Hopkins (“Hop”) was among its contri-
butors. After “Wild Oats” had expired its
editor founded “Judge,” now one of America’s
leading humorous papers.
“Lex”: One of the most exasperating citi-
zens the police have to deal with is the
person who comes along in a high
state of indignation with a report that lie
lias been robbed, and, when he gets his
property back, sides with the accused. It
is usually sufficient for the purposes of de-
feating the ends of justice if lie refuses to
prosecute. Sometimes he goes further. In
a recent Parramatta case, in which a couple
of men were charged with pinching a motor-
lorry, tlie owner told the S.M. that he had
given one of the accused permission to take
it. Collapse of the Crown case. The S.M.
said, with a certain acerbity, “I. suppose the
police , will remember you now if you make
another complaint.” But what can the police
do if he does? A theft is a theft, however
badly the victim may have let them down in
the past.
“General Prac.”: The N.S.W. Medical
Board, aching to get its teeth into quacks
and charlatans, intends to copy South Aus-
tralia’s adaptation of the finger-print system
to special purposes. Henceforth, every
graduate in medicine will be required to
embellish his diploma with a facsimile, in
lamp-black, of his thumbs. Nothing could
be simpler, nothing more foolproof. Nowa-
days many banks in the United States
accept thumbprints in lieu of signatures.
Galton, who pioneered the science of read-
ing the ridges, loops and arches on our hands,
said, in 1892, that “the chance of a set of
fingerprints from both hands being identical
in individuals is less than one .in sixty-four
thousand million.”
* * * *
“Colt”: I suggest that “Sinbad” is wrong
when he assigns an American origin to
“Harriet Lane.” the grim nautical slang for
tinned meat (B, 14/6/’33). It was for the
murder of Harriet Lane that Henry Wain-
wriglit was sentenced to death after a sen-
sational and long-drawn-out London trial of
1815, and his brother Thomas Wainwright
to seven years’ penal servitude as an acces-
sory to the. crime. These Wainwrights, who
cut up the body of the murdered woman
and sought to destroy it with some chemicals
that acted as a preservative, mustp t be
confused with the Wainewright, convicted
forger and suspected poisoner, who was
transported to Tasmania and died there,

“Bogaduck” : The manager of the local
oil depot drove up to my gate. I was begm-
ning to explain that 1 couldn’t pay anything
off my account at that moment when lie
cut me short'with' “Never mind about that
now. If you want a day’s work come and
help me erect ia new lot of road signs. Alt
the others have gone west.” When I asked
if shooting parties had ruined the signs bj
using them as targets he shook his head.
“No; every dam’ one’s been pinched, home-

climbing up the ladder to nail new signs to
roadside trees and the manager growled that
I must be easily amused. It was I who had
first tumbled to the signs being just the
right size for oven slides,

“Floodmark” : Apropos postal deliveries
(B. 10/5/’33), 20 years ago a Government
department handed me the cash to pay
travelling expenses for a batch of lads—
assisted immigrants under the then N.S.n-
scheme. I was out when the boys arrived
at my run. so I posted a cheque for a tenner
to the mail-contractor. It was some weeks
before the contractor’s complaint of non-
payment reached me. I advised that the
cheque had been forwarded A month later
the department asked me what about it. i
queried my bank, stopped payment, an
sent another cheque. Recently, I leceived
the original cheque with apologies from the
postal authorities; upon rebuilding the ioca

“Soso” : If “F.I.A.T. wants to see why
the Sydney bobby on point duty loses his
temper occasionally (B. 24/5/ 33) , he should
visit the Water Police Court, where traffic
offences are dealt with. There he would
soon learn that Sydney motorists are also
short-tempered, and say things to the man
on “points” which would disturb any offi-
cer’s composure. No wonder 500 motorists
parade before that court every week! They
simplv can’t be told what’s what. They
buy their experience (as most of them have
bought their cars) in instalments. #

has m mind when he states that Austin
beaches offer too many counter-attraction,
to make pier anything _but a Aaon-paying
curiosity (B. 7/G/R3). With the one ex-
ception of St. Kilda beach lrom Cottes
to Cairns our beaches offer no opposi-
tion to pier amusements, beyond an adjacent
picture-show or dance hall. In ivngiano
every holiday beach of any note has n>
theatre, picture-show, roller-skating rinK

Australia is to lose one of its cleverest
men, Prof. W. K. Hancock, whom Birming-
ham is tempting away from Adelaide. He
won all sorts of honors at Melbourne Gram-
mar and University, was a lecturer in Perth
at 22, had a glittering career at Oxford as
a Rhodes scholar, and has been Professor
of History at Adelaide since 1926. _ His book
on' Australia is famous. And he is only 35.
George Dickinson, the Commonwealth
Bank’s new chief accountant, has done well
at soldiering as well as the actuarial side of
banking. Twenty-two years ago he was with
the contingent of Australian school cadets
who saw George V. crowned. Three years later
he left with the 15th Battalion and was at
the Anzac landing. A Turkish bullet dam-
aged the sight of an eye, bat he returned to
the peninsula before his 21st birthday, soon
afterwards being commissioned to wear the
gold crown. He probably was the youngest
Australian major on active service.
W. N. L. Harrison obtained second-class
honors in his final exam, for admission to
the Queensland Bar —the first time for 32
years that such a distinction has been won.
The last candidate to pass with honors was
T, J. Ryan, who was to become Premier.
Harrison is a former Rhodes scholar and an
Oxford graduate.
Reg. Mohr, Vic.’s newest P.M., has risen
to the Petty Sessions Bench more rapidly
than most clerks of courts who have reached
that perch. He is just on 42, and entered
the service 25 years ago. He succeeds P. H.
Elligat, who retires at the age limit.
T. E. Rofe, of Sydney, was restored to
the roll of solicitors after a fight that has
lasted, almost without respite, for 38 years.
During practically all of that time it has
been generally agreed that if he wasn’t inno-
cent of the charges made against him he
ought to be. Rofe is sincerely religious; the
Council of Churches w r as proud to elect him
president the other day. As a philanthro-
pist, he stands in a class by himself; there
are few deserving public objects to which
he hasn’t given large sums of money. And
he is a patron of music and literature.
Harvey, J., in a unanimous judgment of the
N. S. Wales Full Court, exonerated him
“from any suggestion that he was a party
to the concoction of evidence to convict Mrs.
Baker of adultery,” which formed the basis
of the crime (“conspiracy to defeat the. due
course of justice”) of which he was convicted
in 1895. The Full Court held that the worst
that could be said of him was that he had
“overstepped the bounds of what a solicitor
could lawfully do in respect of a client”;
and that he had been sufficiently punished
for this slip by the length of time he had
T. E. ROFE, whose name has been restored
to the rolls.
been off the rolls. Mr. Rofe now proposes
to correct this impression by further action.
If he is granted an inquiry he will call Dr.
Coghlan, Australia’s oldest K.C., to testify
for him. The late Edmond Barton, Julian
Salomons and C. E. Pilcher were among the
eminent lawyers who believed in his com-
plete innocence of intentional wrongdoing.
Maoriland’s newest Minister is John
Bitchener. He takes the portfolio of Public
Works, formerly held by Gordon Coates,
who, as Finance Minister (and acting-
Premier during Forbes’s absence), has other
fish to fry. Bitchener is a South Canterbury
farmer who served a long apprenticeship on
local bodies before he entered Parliament as
member for Waitaki in 1919. He’s a
Farmers’ Union man and a whale for
economy in public expenditure, so, unlike most
of his predecessors, he will probably occupy
himself in finding out how little he need
spend—not how much new debt he can run
the country into.
At 33, Dr. Alec Burnard has gained the
degree of Doctor of Music at the Adelaide
University. He was educated at Unley High'
School and Prince Alfred College and was
a pupil of Dr. Harold Davies in his teens.
For seven years he was a clerk in the Com-
monwealth Bank; in 1920 he studied the
pianoforte at the Elder Con., and later de-
Dr. BURNARD, a brilliant Adelaide
musician.
cided to take up music professionally. After
graduating Mus. Bac. he went to London and
studied at the Royal College of Music under
Dr. Vaughan Williams and Herbert B'ryer.
Dr. Burnard is a composer of merit. He is
on the Elder Con. staff and is music critic
for the “Advertiser.” He married Phyllis
Webb, an Adelaide singer and a daughter of
Noel Webb, formerly of the Federal Arbitra-
tion Court.
A link with early-day Queensland was
severed with the death, in England, of D. S.
Thistlewood, for many years one of Banana-
land’s leading railway engineers. Bom in
Hampshire, he reached Queensland in 1862.
His first work there was in the survey of the
railway to Toowoomba and he remained in
the service until 1912, holding many impor-
tant positions. He returned to England in
1918, his death at 91 resulting from a
motor accident.
John Still O’Hara, who died in Sydney at
70, was born on the family estate of Kent-
burst, Castle Hill. The Lands Department
provided him with his life’s "work; he rose
to be an inspector of conditional purchase
lands, in which capacity Inverell, Bathurst,
Yass, Queanbeyan and Moree all knew him
in turn. He was as well known in
all these centres as a practical philanthro-
pist and supporter of hospitals, a keen
churchman and a generous patron of cricket
and other outdoor sports generally. The late
Dr. Acland O’Hara was a brother.
To lighten his declining years, a testi-
monial is being raised for Sam Mauger by
a representative group of 18 Melbourne citi-
zens, headed by Watt, ex-Federal Treasurer,
and Herbert Brookes, former High Com-
missioner to U.S.A. Never did public man
better deserve such a tribute. Mauger was
a fervent and indefatigable apostle of Pro-
tection when that fiscal policy was not so
“settled” as it is now, and as secretary of
the Anti-Sweating League he fought for and
secured the passage of wages-board legisla-
tion. For these ideals he sacrificed worldly
prosperity. True, he was returned to the
Federal and State Parliaments in turn for
a decade or so, and was Honorary Minister
and P.M.G. under Deakin for a couple of
years, but a quarter of a century has passed
since then, and Sam is approaching four
score. A decent annuity for the balance of
his days is aimed at.
Conrad von Hagen, passed out at 78,
arrived in Australia when he was 27, and
did some droving and exploring before he
took to politics. He was a frequent con-
tributor to The Bulletin in those days.
After joining the Labor party he was
chosen to oppose Gregory Wade in an elec-
tion held early in the war, when the “von”
in his name was used against him, cruelly
and unjustly, since his ancestor had been
a British Admiral Yon Hagen. His son, a
popular A.I.F. m. 0., dropped the mislead-
ing prefix out of deference to popular preju-
dice.
One of the 26 new members in the S. Aus.
Assembly is George Morphett, whose fore-
bears have left their mark in Parliamentary
annals. George’s great-grandfather, James
Hurtle Fisher, was President of the colony’s
first Leg. Council, and his grandfather, John
Morphett, was the second President. Both
were pioneers of 1836; Hurtle-square and
Morphett-street in Adelaide preserve their
memories. The latest Morphett represents
the dairying district of Murray, and is
largely interested in the big-scale dairying
at Wood’s Point; he is also a director of
Amscol (cheese, butter and milk) and of
the S. A. Brewing Co. Another new member
whose name revives old memories is Thomas
Playford, grandson of “Honest Tom,” a
former Premier and Agent-General. The
present T.P. is a fruitgrower in the Adelaide
hills.
R. P. Franklin, headmaster of Melbourne
Grammar School, fills the vacancy on Vic.
Council of Public Education created by the
death of Lawrence Adamson, of Wesley Col-
lege. Professor T. M. Cherry, of Melbourne
Uni., replaces Prof. Copland, who resigned.
Percy Pease, who as Deputy-Premier wel-
comed Lyons to Brisbane, is probably the
only Australian Labor man who has ever
been elected to Parliament through being
called a capitalist. In 1920, when Pease first
contested the Herbert, an erudite person was
engaged to extol his democratic virtues in a
flowery Italian pamphlet. The erudite per-
son began with the remark that Percy was
an “uomo piu riceo” (a very rich man),
and then let himself go on his client’s opu-
lence and influence as if he were running him
for the Commonwealth Bank directorate.
Mussolini’s erstwhile subjects were im-
pressed, and Percy won hands down.
Joseph Herbert Gander, M.H.R. for Reid
(N.S.W.), is supposed to be keeping the
seat warm for Lang, but Lang hasn’t asked
him for it yet. Although Gander was de-
feated in the selection ballot for Reid by
C. A. Morgan, solicitor to the Miners’
Federation (expelled for his support of
Willis in the Bulli by-election), he was
JOE GANDER, M.H.R. for Reid ( N.S.W. ).
given the nomination. Joseph was for many
years an alderman at Newtown, and was a
prominent worker for Lang at Auburn. In
the House of Reps, he has earned some repu-
tation as a humorist, and is personally liked.
F. M. Forde has gone to his electorate,
Capricornia, to prepare his constituents for
the coming of the Prime Minister? No M.P.
pays more attention to his electorate than
Forde, who maintains his position by means

Most visiting Ministers find Capricornia a
thorny area.
The retirement of Judge Mallam from the
Darwin Bench removes one of the last beards
from the Australian justiciary and one of
the most interesting characters. Before his
appointment his Honor was deep in Labor
politics in the N.T., but his interest in demo-
cracy was intellectual rather than polemic.
Once he was on the Bench his sense of fair-
ness made him isolate himself in private life
from everybody except his Registrar and
crony, F. T. Macartney.
Artist Sep. Power made brother brushes

£lB5O on the opening day of the show he is
holding in Melbourne. A noted portrayer
of dogs and horses, he gained early experi-
ence of animal anatomy in Melbourne, later
polishing up his technique at Julien’s
Academy in Paris. He puts R. 0.1. after bis

name, and frequently exhibits at the Royal
Academy, whilst Sydney, Melbourne and the
S.A. Galleries cherish examples of his work.
During the war he was official artist to the
A.I.F. Two of his big peace-time, commis-
sions were the exterior picture of the open-
ing of Canberra and the mural decorations
of the Vic. Public- Library. He is fond of
boxer hats and music, and performs with
grace and vigor on the saxophone.
Before The Bulletin days J. F. Archi-
bald was on the staff of the Melbourne “Daily
Telegraph.” As police roundsman he met a
man from the north-cast, a strong sym-
pathiser with the Kelly Gang, who were
then in hiding in the Strathbogie Ranges.
One morning Archie rushed into the “D.T.”
office breathless. “I’ve got the biggest thing
of the year in train,” he announced to the
chief-of-staff. “I’ve fixed it up to go into
the Strathbogies and be taken out blindfolded
to the place where the Kelly gang is in
hiding! I’m to interview Ned. And” —lie
paused to let it sink in—“we’ll have it all
for ourselves; the greatest scoop for twenty
years.” The chief-of-staff was impressed and
Archie was taken to the Grand Panjandrum
of the office, who listened attentively. “And
what will this cost, Mr. Archibald?” ho
inquired blandly. “About five pounds ten,”
replied Archibald. “Then,” said the Grand
Panjandrum, “I’m afraid we can’t do it.
It will cost too much.”
“R.R.”: Macpherson Robertson has made
two trips abroad (B. 14/6/’33). He accom-
panied his parents on their return to Scot-
land when he was eight. He had ten different
jobs in Leith, where he learned the secrets
of sweets manufacture (at Miller’s confec-
tionery works). A few years ago he went
overseas, touring the U.S.A., and running
an eye over Hollywood. Next to croquet
his favorite recreation is talking-pictures.
“H.”: Mention has been made of Janies
Edmond’s recreations, as scheduled by him-
self in “Who’s Who.” The whole par. will
bear quotation; there is nothing else like
it in this huge mass of pocket biographies.
After recording that he was born at Glas-
gow in 1859 the writer continued: “Received
a rather neglected education at a private
school; was left absolutely in charge of him-
self at the age of 15 and entered on active
pursuit of a crust in a fire insurance office;
two companies which employed him went
bankrupt, but he made no profit out of the
disasters; moved to New Zealand per sailing
ship in 1879 and thence to Australia in
search of fire insurance; at Rockhampton
chanced on an engagement, for which he
was then wholly unqualified, on a provin-
cial daily, and presently decided that journal-
ism was the only trade for which he had
any aptitude; moved to The Bulletin,
Sydney, in 1886, and in 16 years had experi-
ence in every department except ladies’ fashion
notes; Editor, 1902-16, and then retired,
owing to failing sight and writer’s cramp ;
thanks to three surgical operations and a
typewriter was able to resume work as a
contributor in 1919, and still pursues the
only profession, in the world which is worth
mentioning.”

Since this robust youngster hung up its
nameplate in Sydney a dozen years ago, the
business lias spread all over the Australian
States, north to Asia and the Indies and
out over the South Sea Islands. There is
an office in London, where the co. pulled
out of the troublesome, long-winded marine
business a few years ago; and there was
another at Montreal, but it has been closed
because of the unsatisfactory experience
there.
These withdrawals, general shrinkage in
values, smaller pay-rolls, cuts in Avorkers’
compensation rates and the disturbed con-
dition of Asia have all contributed to a sharp
fall in premium income. Still, a smaller
volume of more select risks has yielded better
results, as the following comparison of under-
writing figures shows: —

Thus last year’s loss ratio was 12.9 p.c.
lighter than the previous year’s, and the best
since 1925. Exes, were 5.7 p.c. lighter, too,
leaving an underwriting surplus of £5459,
compared with a loss of £13,439 in
the previous term and surpluses of £1402
and £2911 for the two years before
that. Interest and rents turned in £8572,
making the net return from all sources
£14,031, or 14.9 p.c. on the £93,825 of paid
capital. Interest and rents alone were 9.1
p.c. on capital; thus the 7 p.c. div. Avears a
very comfortable look, and prospects of
something better are as bright as anything
of the kind can be under existing conditions.
Policy-holders have no need to stay
awake o’ nights, either. At the close
of last accounts they could see net tangibles
equal to 184 p.c. of the year’s net premiums,
or 34 p.c. more than is usually considered
adequate. Assets comprised Government
securities, £120,506; debtors’ balances, etc.,
£23,293; cash; etc., £37,375; freehold,
£74,041. There was £56,843 coming to sun-
dry creditors.
The pound shares paid to 10s.. which are
covered by 20s. sd. in net tangibles, are not
listed.

The board put last year’s profit at £16,301
as against £28,469 for the previous term.
The difference between these figures and the
profits shown in the table represents net
additions to the replacement reserve (now
£165,915). This has been built up as oppor-
tunity permitted since 1912, and very little
lias been visibly withdrawn. If it is not
an accumulation in excess of actual require-
ments, then the £246,420 of reserves shown
in the table are not 100 p.c. genuine profit.
The declared net earnings were 6.1 p.c. on
capital as against 10.7, 10.2, 9.9, 10.2 and
16 p.c. back to 1927. Still, the div. was
kept at 8 p.c., which is the average rate for
the 22 years since the co. took over fhe sugar
interests of A., H. and E. Young at Bunda-
berg.
The quantity of cane the co. put through
the rollers last, year is not disclosed. In
October the estimate was 53,031 tons as
against a record 123,984 tons for the pre-
vious season. The failure of the crop w T as
due to a dry spell, followed by severe frosts.
Nevertheless, the average price for the whole
of the season’s raws is expected to exceed
the previous year’s figure (£lB 6s. 6d.).
owing to the smaller surplus exported and
the improvement in world prices.
Locally the retail price of fines has been
reduced by |d. per pound, making it 4d..
from the beginning of this year. The cut is
equal to £4. 13s. 4d. per ton, which means
a nominal price of about £22 ss. per ton
for raws _ for home consumption as against
£26 19s. in 1931. The average price for the
whole crop will depend upon the size of
the surplus for export and the price it fetches
abroad. In tins respect the outlook is more
hopeful than it has been for some time, while
British and Canadian preferences continue
to help. At the growing end, prospects for
the current season are for a satisfactory
crushing, thanks partly to the co.’s irriga-
tion scheme, designed to guard againsc
the effects of dry weather upon the growth
and sugar content of the cane.
The co. has spent a lot of money on mills,
plantations and other equipment of recent
years, to the benefit of costs. Here is the
position so far as balance-sheet figures
show it:—
1923. 1930. 1931. 1932.

Sugar stocks,
book debts, etc. 46,070 19,666 60,821 51,017
Thus over the last nine years £121,689 net
has been added to the book value of fixed
assets, and the liquid position lias improved
by £47,647. When the books last closed
liquids, including stores, exceeded liabili-
ties by £40,571, an improvement of £4641
over the twelvemonth. Incidentally, the
board has its eye upon subsidiary interests,
and nominal capital was lifted to £300,000
by the creation of 35,000 new £1 shares
during the year. A new issue to shareholders
or the public is not contemplated.
The market, which does not expect that
the S p.c. div. will be interfered with, prices
the pound shares at 28s. 3d. as against 18s.
two years ago. The return at the higher
figure is 5.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.

This is one of the holding cos. through which
the public is interested in the Union group
of picture theatres, etc. Paid capital is
£270,009. Besides the reserves shown in
the table, there is a capital reserve of
£37,888, and £2600 set aside for taxation;
there was only £47 coming to sundry credi-
tors when the books closed. The lot was
then represented by shares in other cos.,
£293,338; freehold, £35,893; Consols,
£24,148; cash, £4479; debtors, £1895. The
shareholdings were in the General Film Co.
(in liq.), Greater Union Theatres and Aus-
tralasian Films (Holdings), Ltd. The year’s
profit came from interest and rents ; no divs.
were received.
Originally West’s, Spencer’s and Amal-
gamated sold their showing rights, etc., to
the General Film Co. for scrip. General
Film then formed Union and Australasian
Films to do the showing and hiring respec-
tively. Good progress was made and satis-
factory divs. were paid. The success of
the talkies brought better returns, which
were further swollen by the scattering of
loan funds. A costly programme: of develop-
ment and expensive methods, of conducting
the business followed. To finance the out-
lay Union went heavily; into debt, besides
gathering £700,000 of fresh share capital.
Then slump and special taxation brought
losses instead of profits, and the outside
debt (£824,864 in the two operating cos.
combined at the end of 1930) hung , like a
cloud over the position. It Avas decided to
l’eorganise the group, and Union, Austra-
lasian Films and General Film all went
into liquidation.
The four holding cos. in which the public
is interested formed another group,, chief
of which is Greater Union Theatres, to take
over the assets. Greater Union’s original
paid capital was £18,000; it issued another
£70,000 in satisfaction of some of the debts
taken over, and put out a further 312,000
bonus shares to make capital equal to the
estimated net book value of the undertaking.
The £400,000 of capital thus arrived at is
held in this way:—

Greater Union is to hand not less than 20 p.c.
of its annual net earnings to the liquidator
of the old business, until trade creditors are
paid in full. Thus, to pay a 5 p.c. div.
Greater Union would need to net 7J p.c. or
more.
On the basis of last year’s net return
from interest and rents, a 5 p.c. div. from
Greater Union would enable West’s to show
3.3 p.c. on its capital; and there is the possi-
bility that Australasian Films (Holdings)
may be able to send along a bit. Since
the Union group and Hoyt’s have brought
their city houses under one control (General
Theatres Corp.), substantial savings have
been made, takings have improved and the
most important of the operating cos. are
reported to be earning profits.
The market prices West’s pound shares
at 11s. as against 9s. a year ago. The return
at 11s. would be 5.4 p.c. on a 3 .p.c. uiv.
basis.

This co. had a better year than the last
line in the table suggests. Gross profit
(£44,995) sprang £3935, and exes. (£33,181
as disclosed in the accounts) took £3919
of the increase, leaving net profit £l6 better
at £11,814. The 7 p.c. div. was repeated,
leaving. £131.3 for reserves.
Most of the Dominion’s wrapping paper
is turned out by this co. The British pre-
ferential tariff is only 20 p.c. or thereabouts,
and the co. has had to fight for even this
protection; but exchange has been a help,
particularly during the three months to the
end of March last. At its principal mill
(Mataura) the co. manufactures Kraft paper
from imported pulp, rag and old papers. At
the Woodhaugh mill, outside Dunedin,
Kraft and sulphite cap-paper is produced,
and cardboard, paper-bags, etc., are also
turned out. The co. has lately been develop-
ing an afforestation area of its own, with
an eye to future wood-pulping possibilities.
The business made only moderate progress
until war-time protection came along. Then,
following some fine profits, capital was in-
creased from £lOO,OOO to £150,000 during, the
post-war boom in order to finance extensions
to the Mataura mill. But the revival in
Europe, coupled with the importing boom in
Maoriland and Australia, had its effect on
local industries, and N.Z. Paper Mills paid
its last 10 p.c. div. in 1921. Last year, how-
ever, more than 7.8 p.c. on capital could
have been shown had allowances for deprecia-
tion. etc., not been so liberal.
Here is the position looked at from
another angle:—

Cash, etc.. .. 772 699 725 3,900
Last year property and plant showed a
drop of £12,578, or more than twice the re-
duction in the previous term. At Mataura
the' river-level was below normal for some
time, making improvements to the. tailrace
possible, thus increasing the efficiency of
the turbines. On the forestry area £217
more was spent than was written off.
Over the past nine years, however, tin;
drop in the book value of all fixed assets
has been £43,047. In the same period the
debt (now £17.752) has been worked down
by £38,442, and stocks appear to be taken
into the sheet on a very conservative basis.
. Last term inventories totalled £7986 less
than at the previous balance. Including
stocks, the more or less liquid surplus
(£40,912) was £13,669 stronger than at the
previous balance.
The co.’s connections are well spread
throughout the Dominion. The market notes
the improvement in the finances,’ the recent
spring in exchange, and in profits over the past
five years, and prices the scrip at 265. as
against' 18s. a' year ago. At 265. the pur-
chaser gets net tangibles with a book value
of 245.,, and. at last year’s rate of distri-
bution, a return of 5.3 p.c. on his outlay.

1933.. 8,093 5 „ „ 7,998 95 55,732
After a run of 15 p.c. divs., the rate dropped
to 12-1 p.c. for the four years to the
close of accounts in 1929; drought and loss
of the Brisbane agency for the Orient line
had affected the figures. Meanwhile, the
board decided to go into the pastoral-finance
business, and more share capital and out-
side money was got in. But with the big
break in the markets came a sharp con-
traction in commission and other earnings,
and therefore in divs.
More than two-thirds of the £199,273 at
which advances now appear was put out
since the close of accounts in 1928. That
year the Australian average for wool was
£25 4s. 9d.,per bale; the figure was £ll 4s.
sd. for the 10 months to the end of April
last as against £lO 18s. sd. and £ll 2s. lOd.
for the two preceding seasons. During the
12 months covered by the latest accounts
the co. put 30,227 bales under the hammer,
or 469 fewer than for the previous term.
The slip in gross earnings (£44,510) was
£2156; but exes. (£36,418) were pulled
back £193 more than that, leaving the net
result a wink over 5 p.c. on capital as
against 4.9, 6.6, 8.5, 14.2, 18.4, 16.4 and
19.6 p.c. back to 1926.. The div., which had
dropped to 4 p.c. p.a. for the first half, was
lifted to 6 p.c. p.a. for the second half,
making 5 p.c. for the year; and it is doubt-
ful whether much' better than 5 p.c. need
be expected for a while.
Certainly there, has been a heartening rise
in wool prices during the last few weeks.
But owing to dry conditions, next season's
clip in Queensland is expected to be 40,000
bales lighter than the one just shorn, and
prime bullocks can be had for £2 a head in
the north and west, of the State. Hence the
co.’s pound shares, which' are covered by
net tangibles with a book value of 275. Id.,
remain steady at 17s. 6d. in the market.
The return at 17s. 6d. is 5.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c.
div. basis.
The recent development of the business and
the co.’s financial position are seen in the
next comparison of balance-sheet figures:—

Last year £7803, was added to the book
value of advances, etc., and £5797 was tacked
on to the overdraft (£47,786). The amount
coming to sundry creditors (£30,293) was
reduced by £698, and cash, etc., was drawn
upon for £1929. The more or less liquid
surplus (£125,023) was £864 better than at
the close of accounts in 1932. No hint is
given as to what amount, if any, has been
advanced upon broad acres.

1933.. 2,413 6 ~ „ 2400 13 18,268
Thus far this little one of the Hume family
has given a very good account of itself. It
set up a factory at Singapore in 1922, and
for the decade to the close of accounts in
1932 divs. averaged 9:5 p.c., £19,168 of in-
tangibles was replaced by solid assets, and
there was a further £18,268 of genuine sav-
ings to support and assist the £40,000 of
paid capital at the close of last accounts.
The business, however, depends mainly
upon Government contracts, which have been
severely curtailed, owing to the sharp con-
traction of public revenue, following the col-
lapse of prices in the tin and rubber markets,
which also resulted in a dearth of private
work. Hence the comparatively meagre
earnings of the last two years. For the 12
months to the end of March, work in con-
nection with the civil aerodi'ome and the
naval base enabled the co. to show a profit
of a shade over 6 p.c. on capital as against
4.2, 27.5, 30.1, 29.2 and 28.2 p.c. back to
(‘‘Wild Cat” continued on page 16.)

1928, and 6 p.c. was distributed. It was
paid from profits earned prior to July, 1929,
and is therefore free from Federal income
tax.
No account was taken of the profit earned
by the steel-pipe plant during the six
months to the end of March. This plant,
operated on joint account with Hume Steel,
has a £68,000 contract in hand, and orders
have been received from Shanghai. Work
in hand will keep the factory going at near
capacity till September next; and thar.
augurs well for the current year’s earnings.
Meanwhile, a factory to turn out concrete-
lined steel pipes is to be put up at Hong
Kong. Much depends upon how the new
venture turns out; until tin and rubber
again show reasonable returns to producers,
the co.’s prospects in its present territory
are doubtful.
The market prices the pound shares paid
to 15s. at 12s. 6d. as against ss. 6d. a year
ago. At 12s. 6d. the return is 9.6 p.c. on
a 6 p.c. div. basis. The cover is 295. Id. in
net tangibles, mainly plant, etc., worth what
it can earn.
At March 31 stocks (£6013), book debts
(£1591) and cash, etc. (£15,437), totalled
£20.826 more than the amount coming to
creditors (£2215). Freehold, plant, etc.,
figured at £18,084, and there was £25,095
represented by the joint venture with Hume
Steel.
Union Theatres Investments
This one of the Union group—it was regis-
tered in Dec., 1926, and it put up the State
Theatre and shopping block on the old
“Evening News” site in Market-street, Syd-
ney, at a cost of over a million —is asking
pref. shareholders to (1) forego two years
arrears of dividend to' the end of 1932, and
(2) reduce the fixed cumulative dividend
from the original contract rate of 8 p.c. (it
has been lowered to 6.2 p.c. by the statutory
cut) to 5 p.c. In return the prefs. are to
be given full voting powers; their right to
priority to capital in the event of a wind-up
is not to be interfered with.
The old Union Co. took the half-million
ords. and a mortgage (£146,853) over the
freehold. The public put up £350,000 in
8 p.c. cum. prefs., mainly on the strength of
a guarantee as to dividend and capital by
Union Theatres and Australasian Films. But
liquidation of the guarantors has -wiped out
the guarantee, leaving the Investment Co.’s
pref. div. dependent upon net rentals from
the theatre, shops, etc. Last year's net
earnings were £3845. Takings have improved
since, and the co. has leased the theatre
to General Film Corp. (the new concern
which amalgamated the city houses of Union
and Hoyt’s) at £31,200 p.a. This will give
net revenue a lift of about £ll,OOO p.a.. the
board says. A 5 p.c. div. to the prefs. would
call for £17,500 p.a.
With things as they are, a strong
ease can be made out for modification of
the pref. div. rate. But in their present form
the board’s proposals are essentially for the
benefit of the ords. at the expense of the
prefs. The board puts it this way; “If the
div. be limited to 5 p.c., ord. shareholders can
look for some return only by reason of a sub-
stantial improvement in rentals as time goes
on. It is to provide a further induce-
ment for them to endeavor to derive some
small return and thereby automatically
solidify the position of the pref. shareholders
that the latter are being asked to consider
the proposals.”
It is not the business of the prefs., who
have already lost a substantial part of their
original security, to facilitate future payments
to the ords., who are entitled to all surplus
earnings after payment of exes, and the pref.
div. A more equitable arrangement would be
to give the prefs. the right to advance up
to their original contract rate (8 p.c.) with
the ords., after the latter had received 5 p.c.
Also, one -way of compensating the prefs.
for foregoing arrears of divs. would be to
give them an equity in surplus earnings to
the extent of such arrears in the event of
liquidation.
On the market the pound prefs. fell
sharply from 14s. to 12s. fid. following the
board’s announcement.
Sunkissed Bananas (Tweed), Ltd.
This co. is asking £37 10s. for quarter-
acre leasehold lots brought into bearing with
bananas in the Tweed River (N.S.W.) dis-
trict. The lot-holder becomes entitled to ten
years’ profits from the plantation, after
charging all exes., and after handing a quar-
ter of each year’s net. profit to the co. for
its services. It thus has to earn £7 10s.
for bondholders for every £2 10s. it takes
itself. Profit on the sale of land and
services is limited under the new trust deed
to 10 p.c. of the amount charged for each
lot. There have been good profits made
from bananas in the Tweed district on well-
kept, fertile plantations; prospects of re-
turns on these Banana Plantation Develop-
ment Contracts will depend largely upon
selection and quality of the land planted,
and upon management and freedom from
disease. The new trust deed is a much
more comprehensive document than that
which governed the original bond issue.
The Metal Market
The right accorded to President Roose-
velt to do as he pleases with the dollar has
impelled a flight from that currency. The
timid have reduced dollar balances; the
speculative have beared dollars or bulled
commodities according to their fancy. Metals,
cotton, wool and even rubber, which has long
been the Cinderella of raw materials, have
joined in the movement.
The following table shows what has hap-
pened in connection with spot quotes for
metals on the London market —-

The upward swing, which appears to have
spent its force, for the time being, at any
rate, was partly speculative. It was based
upon the anticipation of conditions, not only
in the United States but also in the rest of
the world, which have not yet been definitely
set up. The future of metal prices will
depend very largely upon how much of
the purchases passes into consumption,
and upon the effective steps, if any.
that may be taken to lift the general level
of world prices by monetary action. Cur-
rency, exchange, price-levels and tariffs are
some of the tough nuts upon which the London
Economic Conference is trying its teeth at
the moment. Allowing for the depreciation
of the dollar, and for a better flow of metals
through consuming outlets in the U.S.A.—
in Europe demand seems to be rather on the
quiet side —it now appears that prices were
talked to too high a level.
The biggest attempt to resuscitate one of
the old mining groups at the Towers (Q.)
is W. H. Clark’s successful flotation of
the Black Jack. Something like £12,000
cash is available to test the intersections of
the reefs in this outside area, which is some
miles from the Brilliant and Day Dawn.
The expected enrichment should be met with
between 700 ft. and 800 ft.; workings are now
down below 500 ft. Several nice shoots
were worked at shallower depth, and some-
thing like £30,000 profit was made from
bullion worth £3 15s. an ounce, while ore
returns averaged Billy Clark, known
to everyone on the Towers, demonstrates his
faith in the show by backing his scrip and
cutting the cash.
* * * *
The old leads about Clermont (C.Q.)
have kept their riches very snugly packed
away lately. After two years of renewed
effort, backed largely by relief funds, the first
real success came to two prospectors a
couple of weeks back on the Cumberland lead.
They have since washed about £l2OO of allu-
vial gold from 40 loads of dirt. There was
big production from these leads back in the
’eighties, and the present strike looks like the
precursor of an extension of payable opera-
tions—the main gutter has been located;
not before it was wanted, for up to 100 men
in these parts have had to be kept by the
Government while looking for it.
* * * *
The return of cash subscriptions for
options on the promising North Arm gold-
field. near Brisbane, has not. held up the field.
Golden Surprise has been yielding steadily,
hut other properties concerned in the pro-
jected deal are only developing. Something
went phut; two favorable reports were put
in, and then the money was returned. F.
de Gipps considered the area one of the
best he had inspected and sampled. Southern
subscribers sent up W. Gibson, who has just
completed his examination. Gympie interests,
which predominate on the field, are anxiously
awaiting the verdict. After early reports
they gasped because they hadn’t asked
enough, something like £70,000 in paper and
coin.

At Mount Stewart, Lolworth (N.Q.).
there are seven distinct reefs on the Burns
Victory lease of 15 acres. The Venus, aver-
aging 3ft. in width, has been traced for five
chains and worked to a depth of about 12ft.
A crushing of 101 tons yielded 12oz. lOdwt.
of gold, and there was over 6dwt. in the
sands. On the Victory the main shaft, down
44ft., is on 4ft. of stone assaying over an
ounce. Also a new lode is being opened
up; it runs parallel with the Mystery, which
was first worked 25 years ago. The Govern-
ment has advanced £5O towards building a
road to the Pioneer Mill at Lolwortfi Creek.
* * * #
Golden Junction, Cracow (Q.>, has taken
an option over a new find at Mount Banya,
in the Mount Perry district, where a large
body of quartz porphyry lias been opened up.
Samples averaged lldwt. of gold over 10ft..
without disclosing the full width of the lode.

Mining Option Development is testing an
alluvial area near Mt. Morgan (Q.). A
preliminary examination showed 400,000
c.y. of 3s. 9d. dirt with gold at 3205.. and
a further three million c.y. worth about Bd.
a yard. If these values are confirmed, a co.
will be formed to work the property.
As a preliminary to the flotation of a co.
to work their combined areas, the Sandhurst
Gold Mining Syndicate at Gulgong (N.S.W.)
is to link up with the Noonan-Callaghan
party next door. The Noonan-Callaghans
recently crushed eight tons at the local bat-
tery for soz. 6dwt. of retorted gold, an in-
crease of 2|dwt. a ton on their previous
crushing. Fred Hasenkam is to manage the
new concern.
* * * *
Asia Amalgamated, which is developing a
property at Wyalong (N.S.W.), recently
crushed 14 tons for 16J0z., with tailing's
assaying sdwt. A rise is in 2ft. of ore assay-
ing 25dwt., and the south' drive is in 30dwt.
ore over a width of 9in. The co. hopes to
pay for development from periodical crush-
ings.
* * * *
New Alison Gold, which is developing the
southern section of the Costcrfield gold-anti-
mony area (Vic.), lias sunk five prospecting
shafts to depths up to 60ft., and all are said
to show good values. From the bottom of
the main shaft (100 ft.) a 40ft. crosscut has
met a reef carrying “rich antimony and
gold.” The reefs at Costerfield vary from
a ribbon to 3ft. in width, and occur over a
strike length of two miles. It is the stibnite
which carries the high values. Little
has been done on the field since 1926, w 7 hen
the principal mine, which was developed to
a depth of 930 ft., closed down. From 1905
to 1922 the field produced £348.640 worth of
antimony, and gold valued at £240,280.
Guildford Plateau, which is developing
1200 acres of deep alluvial near Castlemaine
(Vic.), will shortly complete the drainage
shaft to 120 ft., or 40ft. below the river
bed. Driving under the wash, which will
be taken out on a face of 140 ft. for a dis-
tance of 5000 ft., will follow. Over the last
80 years several unsuccessful attempts have
been made to work this area; heavy water
made operations unprofitable with gold at
84s.

The Hercules, Bendigo (Vic.), has pro-
duced 14,5380 z. from 7768 tons during the
last 11 months. Recent returns have aver-
aged over 12dwt. The co. is now cross-
cutting from the winze on the 1620 ft. level
in search of the upward continuation of
the rich stone mined on the 1725 ft. level.
* * *
The new battery on the Little 180, Ben-
digo (Vic.),’will be ready by the end of next
month, and a large quantity of low-grade
ore has been broken. Provision is also being
made for another 10 head of stamps.

Harry Urquhart, Claude de Bernales’s
mining associate, has returned to Perth from,
London as technical adviser to Anglo-Austra-
lian Gold Development. Ltd., the co. recently
formed in London to take over several old
and new Westralian gold-mining shows from
De Bernales. Urquhart is accompanied by
L. C. Cutbill, a young and good-looking
director of the co., and a member of the
London st'oekbroking firm of E. Cutbill and
Co. It is proposed to start boring on some
and to geologically survey other areas imme-
diately. Funds subscribed, and assured, are
stated to be ample. Besides Cutbill and Do
Bernales, the directors include ex-Westralian
Governor Campion (chairman). John Wad-
dington. chairman of Great Boulder, and
H. T. Eke, a member of the Manchester
Stock Exchange. The co. kicks off with 900
individ-a] shareholders.
Geologist Martin Weatherall has inspected
the Norseman (W.A.), and has arrived at the
following conclusions: (1) The reef is pri-
mary and will live at depth; (2) the shoot
of gold shows permanency in length and has
every prospect of continuance north and
south : (3) values are uniformly payable and
should yield handsome profits when the mine
reaches, its normal production stage; (4)
indications point to a further gradual in-
crease in width at depth. He adds that
widths of ore (sft. to 7ft.) given by him
represent widths exposed, not full widths,
and therefore recommends crosscutting at
intervals for short distances east and west
from No. 4 level and below. No values are
given. Norseman shares, which rose several
shilling's on reports of good developments and
on rumors of a bear squeeze, soared as a re-
sult of Weatherall’s report.
* * * *
Sampling didn’t come up to expectations,
so Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has abandoned
its option on the Moonlight lead at Kanowna,
The co. is still hanging on to its auriferous
reservation between Menzios and Leonora,
where good bodies of ore are being opened up
in the bottom levels of the Gwalia mine.
Here profits sufficient to pay 4s. a year or
more are being earned. In addition to its
Westralian holdings the co. has a substantial
interest in a Cornish kaolin venture, which
seems to take two steps backward for every
one forward.
* * * *
Great Boulder Prop, proposes to increase
nominal capital to £250,000 by the creation
of 750,000 new shares of 2s. each. In due
course 583,383 of these are to be offered,
one for three, to those on the London and
Adelaide registers at ss. each (sterling).
The other 166,667 shares are in pickle.
The money is wanted to help finance the
erection of a new milling plant, which, the
co. figures, will reduce costs by £43,000 p.a.
Earlier in the year Ruwolts, Melbourne, pre-
pared plans and specifications of a 12,000-
ton-per-month flotation plant for the co.
Lake View and Star, whose offer of purchase
G.B. refused, may make a bid for another
property on the Golden Mile.
* * * *
Boulder Perseverance note-holders got
£6 Bs. 9d. per £5 note as their share of the
recent div. The last recorded sale of the
notes in London was at £2OO per £lOO note.
The paper, secured by a floating charge over
the assets, is redeemable at the co.’s option
after .Tune 30, 1936, but not later than the
middle of 1941.
* * *
Lake View Investment Trust netted
£42,900 last year as against £60,400 the year
before, and 31 points were chipped off the
div-, reducing it to 61 p.c. The co. holds

ONE THING AND ANOTHER.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“Reunion in Vienna” has one of those
plots which only come nowadays from that
land of lush royalist sentimentalism the
U.S.A. Europe, which provides the supply
of magnificoes in exile, and England, which
has housed so many of them, know these
colorless failures too well to become romantic
about them. John Barrymore plays Rudolf,
who has fallen from his high Austrian estate
to that of a Nice taxidriver. When some
members of the old regime organise a re-
union at Frau Luchcr’s hotel—May Robson
is superb as the cigar-smoking old' autocrat
of an establishment which was formerly a
royal palace—the exiled archduke returns in
disguise. He behaves as audiences in the
Middle West of America like to believe Euro-
pean archdukes behave. That is, as some
archdukes behaved in the cinquecento, and
earlier. His first salute to Diana Wynyard,
who used to love him in the long ago, is a
smack on the face, which she accepts humbly
as a loyal subject should. He kicks the ser-
vants, puts his feet on tables, swills brandy
and champagne and attempts to exercise a
droit de seigneur in respect of Miss Wyn-
yard. But she is happily married to a suc-
cessful psycho-analyst—admirably played by
Frank Morgan—and the archduke plies her
with champagne, and reminds her of their
past happiness, in vain. He drives the
courtiers from the throne room and calls in
musicians to charm her into submission. She
consents, at length, to enter the royal bed-
chamber. The musicians and courtiers cele-
brate his success with loyal rejoicings, but
the rejoicings are unfounded. She has
escaped by a secret door, which the spec-
tators know about, having seen her use it in
the first sequence.
When the archduke bursts into the lady’s
luxurious home in uniform and a. comic
mountaineer’s hat (hastily assumed, since
the police are after him) and demands his
royal rights, she rebuffs him again. Albeit
kindly, even affectionately; for he is an
archduke, remember, and this is an Ameri-
can film. For the same reason the husband
is proud to shake his hand in farewell, and
the husband’s father —a fine character-part
for Henry Travers —is deeply affected by
his kiss.
To begin with the defects: the psychology
is all wrong. The essence of the suspense
is the husband’s worry lest he may lose his
wife’s love. Yet it is an axiom with people
of his profession that nothing is so dead as
a dead infatuation. Also, women of the
type that Diana Wynyard portrays may for-
give many things—drink, infidelity, even
crime—but they never forgive men of their
class who become taxidrivers. The archduke,
after ten years at the wheel of a taxi, would
have irretrievably lost his superiority com-
plex ; and in any case modern royalties with
all their faults are not barbarians. Their
weaknesses are incompetence and. timidity,
and a tendency to fall hopelessly in love with
and remain faithful to ladies of humble
origin.
Regarded as a fantasy, however —a kind of
Hollywood Night’s Dream —“Reunion in
Vienna” is one of the most delightful enter-
Diana Wynyard and John Barrymore in
“Reunion in Vienna,” at the St. James,
Sydney.
tainments Sydney has seen. The settings are
appropriate and brilliantly photographed,
and the casting and acting are beyond praise.
Diana Wynyard is the real star. Barrymore
has nearly all the best lines, but she gets
most of the effects—often by no more than a
smile, a glance or a slight gesture.
The first part at the St. James is excep-
tionally good. A cocktail of shorts. All the
ingredients are excellent and the general
effect is highly stimulating.
¥ * #
“42nd Street,” at the State, is only a
back-stager, but it is a superlatively good
one. Its chief merits are the casting, some
beautiful ballet effects, and the fact that
a dramatic story has been woven into the
usual incidents. Warner Baxter, as Julian
March, musical-comedy producer, is ill and
hard up. He is desperately anxious to stage
one more success and retire. We see him
doing it. With frantic energy he flogs the
tired dancers to further efforts, harangues
the company like a revivalist preacher, bullies
his terrified yes-men. As things are getting
into shape, the inevitable happens. Bebe
Daniels is the leading lady whom he loses
at the last minute. She is the favorite of a
degraded old backer of the show —played with
remorseless realism by Guy Kibbee. She
has many amusing lines and a cynically
vulgar sequence, in which she gives Kibbee
and his drunken friends their marching
orders, dismissing the last of them with
a violent kick and the adjuration, “Next
time you visit a lady’s apartment be-
have as a lady.” Ruby Keeler 1 is the
ingenue who takes the leading lady’s part
at a moment’s notice and makes a success
of it. She is pretty, and her voice, which
is oddly deep and full for.one so small, has
an engaging note of joyousness. At the end
Baxter is seen leaning exhausted against a
wall listening to the comments of the people
leaving the show. They have nothing to
say about him, the man who made it. This
is perhaps the best thing Baxter has done
on the screen. The spectator keeps forget-
ting that the harassed-looking being with the
absurd wisp of hair
on his upper lip is
an old screen friend.
He imposes himself
for minutes at a
time as a stranger
who is putting up a
genuine battle with
fate in the form of
human stupidity.
The principal
characters in “The
Crash” are so
worthless that it is
hard to be interested
in their doings.
George Brent is a
Stock Exchange
speculator married
to Ruth Chatterton.
She has an elderly
admirer who is a
millionaire, and
knows all about the
markets. Brent per-
suades her to try
to wheedle another
tip out of the old
gentleman, but he is
so sick of being
made use of by one
who, though ever
ready to languish
at him in a provoca-
tive manner, refuses,
as he complains, to
love him, that he
won’t give her any
more. She is fool
enough to tell her
husband that she has
been given a tip ;
that the market is
going up. It goes
down and they are ruined. She retires to
Bermuda, and there promises to marry an
alleged Australian (Paul Cavanagli), and
join him in the toilsome business of sheep-
ranching. Crazed at the thought of losing
her, Brent blackmails the financial magnate
already mentioned out of 25,000 dollars by
means of some letters stolen from his wife.
So, realising that her husband needs her,
the wife takes him back. Ruth Chatterton
employs all her mannerisms: the expressive
eyes which she rolls humidly at each of her
adorers in turn, the honeyed tones, the some-
what stagey gestures. Henry Kolker, as
the millionaire, is the best of the others.

The flooding of the Thames is one of the
spectacular features of “The World, , the
Flesh and the Devil,” at the. Ilaymarket.
The title, by the way, isn’t meant to be de-
scriptive ; it is the name of an East End
pub, where much of. the action takes place.
The film is a relic of bygone days; a thing
of vile villain, of maiden sweet and of low-
class crook reformed by Virtue’s kindness.
Harold Hath, as black-hearted a ruffian as
ever strode a stage in Bland Holt’s day,
learns when his mother is dying that he is
the illegitimate son of a wealthy business
man who believes wrongly that Huth and
his heir, James Raglan, have been changed
at birth. Huth swears the change lias been
made and, to remove the only evidence to
the contrary, murders the. proprietor of the
pub and mother of the low-class crook
already mentioned. Inevitably the murder
is blamed on James, the pure girl’s fiance.
The other characters now begin feverishly to
investigate 'the crime. Is it necessary to add
that justice is done when you remember that
the m.s. has befriended the 1.-e.c., who has
discovered the truth? He saves the State
the expense of a trial and execution by
drowning the person with the black heart.
In “Come On, Danger,” evil men have
caused pretty Julie Ha.vdon, uncrowned queen
of a bandit gang, to be suspected of murder.
Things look bad for her when wild-man Tom
Keene, pride of the rangers, sets out to
catch h’er. But when did evidence ever
deceive Tom? Any good ranger knows that
evidence —at least evidence against a nice
girl—is worthless. So justice was done and
they ranged happily ever after.

Hollywood films are nothing if not topical.
Prohibition, gangsters, Presidential elections,
the yellow press, commercialised religion and
Hollywood itself have all been shown up.
Now comes the bridge craze. “Grand Slam,”
at the Regent, is a dig at system-mongers
of the Culbertson type. Paul Lukas por-
trays a waiter who marries a bridge fiend.
She makes him take up the game. He loathes
it, and refuses to' have anything to do with
systems, yet always wins. This prompts a
go-getter to boost him as an expert, and he
and his wife become national figures. The
Lukas system—which is really no system at
all —sweeps the country, and its exponent
rakes in a fortune. Then Lukas and his
wife—“ America’s Bridge Sweethearts”—
squabble over a blonde. The go-getter, who
has a warm spot in his heart for the wife,
spills the beans, and Lukas loses prestige.
He arranges a championship contest with
the expert whom he had displaced early in
his career. This expert is a fake also, and
the spectacle of the two frauds in action is
most diverting. Eventually Lukas wins
(with the aid of his wife, who returns at
the eleventh hour), and decides to got out
of the game while the going is good. An
enjoyable farce, and you haven’t got to be
a bridge player to understand it.
By the time “The Crime of the Century”
bleeds to death, in a manner of speaking,
three corpses litter Jean Hersholt’s surgery.
One is that of a banker who has committed
a theft under hypnotic suggestion, another
represents the earthly remains of the doc-
tor’s wife. They have been murdered, and
the third body is that of their assassin. This
malefactor shoots himself at the fadeout.
Until then the audience has been occupied
trying to guess who slew the first-named un-
fortunates. It might have been Hersholt.
He had actually planned a crime of the sort
and had called the police in to save himself
from perpetrating it. Or it might have been
his wife’s lover, or his son, or his daughter,
Warner Baxter and Guy Kibbee in “42nd Street,” at the State,
Sydney.
Or the detective with the sinister-looking
moustache. It could hardly have been the
blatant young newspaper reporter or the de-
tective, in charge of the one with the mou-
stache. Thus reason the novices. The veterans
will narrow their choice to the latter pair,
and —but we mustn’t give the exciting show
away. Hersholt, who, like most movie stars,
never varies his tricks, is aided by Wynne
Gibson, Stuart Erwin, Francis Dee and
David Landau.
* * *
Kate Smith, who is One of America’s fore-
most radio wai-blers, makes a personal
appearance in “Hello, Everybody!” at Syd-
ney Lyceum. She appears as a. farmer’s
daughter in California. The cows and
chickens on the property adore her. She
has also a beautiful singing voice which is
the pride of the local rustics. Along comes
a malign trust which wants to buy up all
the farms in the district and desecrate the
sylvan scene with a reservoir. Miss Smith
leads the agriculturists in the fight against
city interests and
wins. But the liti-
gation ruins her.
Radio gains what
the primary indus-
tries lose. Her ren-
dering of . such songs
as “Moon Smig,”
“Pic c aninn i e s ’
H e a v e n ” and
“Twenty Million
People” endear, her
to the entire Ameri-
can nation, and she
becomes rich. Does
she fall so low as to
buy a yacht, pent-
house, Long Island
mansion and other
ap.pur tenances of
wealth? No, sirre'e.
She goes back to the
old farm and re-
sumes her hobby of
trust-busting in th'e
interests of the dwel-
lers in the vast wide
spaces. Randolph
Scott and Sally
Blane furnish the
love interest.
* * *
“False Faces,” at
the Capitol, is a
satire on U.S.A.
beauticians. Lowell
Sherman, as Dr. Si
Brenton, does well
till he tries to
straighten a pair, of
bow legs. He even
puts it over the Medical Society and a jury
when one of his many loves gives him away
to the but he can’t bluff the revolver
shot of his victim, who has lost both legs
as a result of his ignorance. Sherman
makes a plausible scoundrel; Nance O’Neill
is convincing as the bow-legged lady.
John Gilbert, Robert Armstrong and Mae
Clarke appear as toughs in “Fast Workers.”
Jack goes to no end of trouble to stop Bob
marrying Mae; Bob tries to murder Jack
in revenge; and it all ends with Jack won-
dering if Mae was worth the trouble. Some-
body, possibly the censor, has failed to allow
the story to tell why such friends are ene-
mies, but the publicity sheets disclose that
it was for a bet. The setting of the drama
is the steel frame of a mile-high skyscraper.
Sundry Shows
Critics were set a difficult task by a first
performance at Sydney Con. hall of Roy
Maling’s hallet “Roksanda”—orchestra con-
ducted by the composer, dancing by pupils
of the Lightfoot-Burlakov school. The music
proved to be bizarre in form, abounding in
unusual harmonies and dissonances, and the
orchestra, which was less an organisation than
a collection of players, very probably failed
to produce some of the effects intended.
.“Roksanda” is said to be based on a legend
of mediaeval Sel-bia, but the ballet gave no
clear outline of the legend. Costuming and
setting were effective, and the posturing of
the dancers followed the music as approxi-
mately as an art usually associated with
curves can chime with eccentric rhythms and
angular phrases. More conventional and
easier to appreciate were the dancing, to
ballet music by Gounod, and a programme
of short dances, some to a mere drum-tap
rhythm-marking accompaniment. As to the
merits of Mr. Maling’s composition, these
are impossible of assessment, so far as this
Showman is concerned, on the evidence of
one performance, and that, possibly, an im-
perfect one.

The series of Sunday-afternoon orchestral
concerts arranged by the Sydney Municipal
Council seems to be filling a long-felt want.
For these occasions various orchestras com-
bine, making a fairly well-balanced band of
GO. There’s a different conductor each week,
and the players fill the Town Hall with rich
strains and packed audiences. Last Sunday
the combination gave a spirited performance
of the “Tannhauser” overture, played the
“Valse Triste” of Sibelius, and a very fine
arrangement of airs from “La BoliSme,” and
delighted the not-so-very-musical with an
arrangement of old songs from “Cavalcade,”
the work of Hamilton Webber, conductor for
the afternoon. Ernest Truman exercised 'the
great organ with Weber’s “Invitation to the
Waltz” and other popular numbers, and
Alfred Cunningham sang Massenet’s
“Elegie” and the “Pagliacci” prologue.
The Sydney Players’ Club filled St. James’s
Hall on Saturday, when it staged H. M.
Harwood’s modern comedy, “A Social Con-
venience.” The action revolves around a
young married woman who wanted to be
divorced so that she might marry a poli-
tician. The politician objected to becoming
a co-re., so a dummy had to be found. This
business was entrusted to a shady person
named Prothero'. But the dummy co-re. is
not keen on his unsavory job, and finds him-
self in love with the niece of the man whose
wife he was paid to compromise. The up-
shot is that the politician is squeezed out
and the lady and her husband reunited. S. R.
Irving’s portrayal of the crooked Prothero
was a polished piece of acting, and Wilfred
Blackett put some life into the part of
Lcstrange, the co-re. who fell down on his
job. A. O’Keefe was a bit too intense as
the politician, but was chief laugh-raiser.
Sybil Reimer was convincing as the matron
who wanted to stray, and William Wines
and Majorie Cumberland were well cast as
the husband and the niece.
* * *
Young Philip Hargrave continues to draw
crowds to Sydney’s Town Hall three times
weekly, repeating items of his repertoire
which were heard during his first week in
the city. His popularity shows no signs
of waning, and his season has been extended
into a third week.
“Madam, your face doesn’t need lifting; it needs hoisting."
Lowell Sherman in “False Faces,” at the Capitol, Sydney.
The Seyler-Hannen co. at Sydney Royal
comes to the end of its run with “The Middle
Watch” to-night. To-morrow “The Cat’s
Cradle” will give Miss Seyler an opportunity
to show her paces as a comedienne.
* * *
“Hold My Hand,” a gay songandance
comedy, took the place of “Our Miss Gibbs”
at. Melb. Royal on Saturday night. Cyril
Ritchard and Madge Elliott dance divinely,
Gus Bluett is a comic valet, Leo Franklyn
has a congenial role as an elderly peer given
to gambling and imbibing and Frank Leigh-
ton’s dancing is enthusiastic. Jean Duncan,
as Helen Milchester, is nice to look at and
pleasant to hear. The ballet slips in and
slips out in many charming guises.

“Bert the Carpenter” : Everyone is fami-
liar with “terazzo” paving. An Italian
plasterer whom I know made up some of
these slabs, using low-grade opal chips in-
stead of marble. A small piece of opal was
sufficient for a large slab, and when polished
was a thing of beauty. Anything finer for
panelling the foyer of a movie or a high-
class hotel would be difficult to imagine.
The Italian is going to Europe, saying he
has something which should be in great
demand even if building construction is
almost at a standstill.
“Frigid”: All turpentine used in Aus-
tralia is imported, but it won’t always be
the case. Queensland is seeing to that.
Trees planted five years ago —Pinus caribwa
and Finns twda, the southern yellow pines
of America—are now 30ft. high. Up to the
present 500 acres have been planted, and it is
proposed to plant a further 325 acres this
year and 400 acres next year. These pines
not only yield excellent turpentine but a
good-quality timber.
“F.”: As everyone seems to have given
three cheers for Queensland timbers, let me
add a “tiger.” The Wholesale Co-opera-
tive Society’s splendid new premises in
London have for their interior decoration
walnut, black bean and silky-oak, all from
Queensland. As we can’t bring London, lock,
stock and barrel, to Australia, the next best
thing we can do is to help to beautify the
old town.
“V. B. Emm” : Maoris are now competing
successfully with Europeans for M.L.’s most
important butter trophies. At the Dominion’s
premier dairy show (Waikato), the A. J.
Mills cup for the best export butter selected
at random by show officials from the grading
stores was won by the Ngatiporou Co-opera-
tive Dairy Co., a concern supplied almost
entirely by Maoris, controlled by a Maori
directorate and with a factory staffed by
natives. In the Auckland provincial cham-
pionship the co. was second.
“E.G.”: The U.K. is being flooded with
“sweated” clothing from Poland, where
wages are pitifully poor. A' smart-
looking imported suit sells for 175.;
trousers, 2s. 3d. a pair. There are
about 1,000,000 hands employed in the
manufacture of similar clothing in England
and, although there is a 20 p.c. tariff in their
favor, the task of competing with terribly
sweated (and indirectly subsidised) foreign
labor is blue murder. To-day it is possible to
buy/ a good quality made-to-measure British
suit for a little over £2.
“LI.A.L.”: “Bouragi’s” par. (B. 31/5/’88)
doesn’t help. It is not a question of
catching more fish; it is a matter of find
ing more fish to catch and then to get a
docent price for them. The depression has
driven scores of men to take up fishing, and
their unpainted boats, patched sails and eco-
nomical use of their auxiliary engines show
liow little they are making. All Aussie fisher-
men blame the southern Europeans for the
vanishing fish supply. These Mediterranean
immigrants link their nets together and sweep
a whole ground. Under cover of night they
sneak in to every closed ground and iiet it.
This never gives the fish a chance. Worse
still, it. doesn’t give the Australian fisherman
a hope.
“Aitchdee”: Why can’t we can rabbit as
wo can fruits? There is no reason why
tinned bunny should not sell as readily as
a score of other foodstuffs that fill the shelves
of retail stores. Trapping would give work
to thousands of unemployed, and canning,
printing, advertising, etc., to countless more.
“H.A.L.": Phenomenally high tides and a
sou’-westerly gale along the coast have caused
the S.A. railways a lot of bothVr. Usually
all the water required for the locos, running
on the Murray lands lines is drawn from the
Murray at Tailem Bend and Murray Bridge,
but now the salt water has backed up the
river beyond both centres, rendering the
water unfit for use in boilers. As a result
trains drawing 0000-gallon watertanks are
leaving Bordertown, where there is a full
reservoir, and travelling across wbat is
known as the ninety-mile desert to Tailem
Bend, 110 miles away, in order to keep the
locos, running on the Malice lines. This
sort of thing is often done in drought times,
of course, but it is rare to see it when
there has been plenty of rain.

“Forward One”; John Sul man. of Sydney,
declared to a lunch-time gathering that
street-widening, on which his home city has

are free from fast traffic.” His audience,

front Gcorge-street West, which is so wide
and so thronged with motors travelling at
from 40 to 60 m.p.h. that crossing it is
a job requiring extra strong rterves, needed
no convincing on that point. The knight
suggested that Sydney and other Australian
bloats should adopt the European fashion
of recessing shop fronts behind gracefully-
arched colonnades. That seems the best
way to solve a problem that is already
serious. In the busiest part of Sydney’s
Pitt-street foot traffic is forced on to the
road at most times of the day because the
footpaths, despite strenuous police efforts,
are congested with window-gazers.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Louden”: The match between Stringy-
bark Ridge and Mangel Flat was more than
willing. A long-whiskered fellow from the
Flat in the last two minutes of play tore

ball, came out minus a leg of his pants and
somehow managed to kick a goal before
crashing heavily. I was congratulating him
a few days after the battle. “Thanks,”
drawled the veteran; “it muster been rough.

“M.G.”: Fish stoxues are flooding Mel-
bourne papers as a result of the disquieting
news (B. 81/5/’33) that for years people
have been eating shark camouflaged
under appetising names. In defend-
ing the sale of what it calls the
“snapper shark,” the Co-operative
Fishermen’s Association pleads that
the gummy shark has been largely
cleaned up—Melbourne has eaten him
out of Port Phillip without knowing
it. Now the snapper shark is being
sold, and its sale defended, though the
antagonists of the association contend
that there is no such thing as a snapper
shark, and that it is really a comprehensive
term embracing the grey nurse, the blue
pointer and other menaces of the .surfer.
The argument is still proceeding.

“O. W. Waireki.”: The Maori mind loves
a complication. I lent lienare a break-back
rat-trap because he had had no luck with
another kind of trap. Later I visited the
wliare and found the native, comfortable on
liis bunk, gazing intently into a corner of
the room where my trap was. “Soon te fun
start,” announced Heiiare ' portentously. I
glanced at the trap and noticed that it was
set but not baited. “You can’t expect a rat
to shove bis head into a trap that’s not
baited,” I said. . “Stacks of bait,” lienare
assured me, pointing to a treacle-tin lid, to
which pieces of cheese had .been stuck, that
was balanced at a precarious angle on a
shelf directly above the trap. “Soon as te
rat step on t’at tin off lie get shot on to te
trap-catcher,” explained lienare. “I test
out te patent with Moko’s toy mouse.”

“Jackdaw”: “Phwat ye say is facks,
McWhannel, me bkoy,” said Hennessey, set-
ting down a 'decaliter and two glasses; “an’
be th’ same token there’s many a thrue
worrud shpoken in error. Oi c’n renumber
a happenin’ in this very bar which bears

‘ye’ll soon foind ways an’ means, Tim, me

A dhrunken gossoon jumps out an’ rushes

“Wobey” : Geordy and Mark, professional
district rabbiters, with their pack of hounds
are in great demand in Central Riverina just
now. In cold weather, when camped out
between stations, some of the hounds sleep
unmolested with —and at times on—their
masters. One bitterly cold night, when Mark
got up to replenish the fire, he found it had

gone out. “Don’t bother about it,” said old
Geordy. “Sling- on a couple more dogs.”
“Brady’s Lookout”: I have had experi-
ence with Tassie axe-pegs. The good
ones are the pride of the Bushwhackers’
Club; the others are brittle as glass. 1 Un-
less manufacturers wake, up to the fact that
only timber that is exactly right is good
enough they will lose the trade. At present
I have two handles made from tea-tree, and
they are first-rate. They were fashioned from
15-inch boles in a sawmill in Black Hills,
New Norfolk district (Tas.).
* *
“Bogaduek”: Mt. Gambier (S.A.) hasn’t
the. only runaway hole; there is one near
Bordertown. All the water from a big-
area of country runs down creeks to
the Pooch a swamp, at one end of which
is a large, funnel-shaped
depression. When the
swamp is full the posi-
tion of the hole is shown
by a slow whirlpool on
the surface of the
water ; in late autumn
the swamp dries up, and
then the hole can be
seen with the water in
it some 60ft. down,
marking the level. of
the water-table. Tradi-
tion credits' this and
o'her runaway holes
with having sucked down
horses and cattle which
tried to swim across
them, but that is all
ray eye and Betty Mar-
tin. I once swam right
across the Poocha hole
when the swamp was ’
full to get some ducks
which I , had shot, and
have, since often observed that, the floating
rubbish which slowly swirls around over the
hole is never drawn under.

“Searchlight”: I nominate Beardy Plain
(Glen limes district) as the coldest spot in
N.S.W. I have camped at the foot of Kos-
ciusko, lh r ed on the plains of Monaro, seen
the milk frozen at Goulburn, smashed ice
six inches thick at Ivatoomba, spent a. night
on the railway shod floor at Llangothlin and
seen water-pipes burst at Armidale; but for
real cold Beardy Plain takes the ribbon.
We camped there under canvas in a six-by-
eigh’t, and in the morning the tent was like
a board and we ourselves just masses of
misery. Later we tried to drive across the
plain in a sulky, and had to change drivers
every four minutes. I gave the reins a jerk
to liven the mare. They broke clean off in
my hands.

“Celtic" : I'm uncertain whether this is a
case of taming dumb animals by kindness or
by frightful cruelty. In the pioneering days
of the Clarence River selector MacTavish,
who hailed from Skye, broke in to service
a pair of oxen which he named Laird and
Crofter. He ploughed with these bullocks
garbed in his clan tartan with a Glengarry
cap, whistling “Annie Laurie,” and address-
ing his team in Gaelic. He never used a
whip, and unless he uttered Gaelic oaths
with inappropriate equanimity he didn't
swear. A more docile team was never seen
on the Clarence. As the land became cleared
and horses superseded oxen MacTavish pen-
sioned his faithful . quadrupeds on the com-
monage. They were useless to anyone save
their owner, having no knowledge of the
Australian tongue.
; * ■ * - :S *
“Marsh”: Motor-ears have sent freak
buggy teams out of Operation. A four-in-
hand is n,ever .seen now,. except when wet
weather makes the ground , too boggy for
cars. Tandem, unicorn, four-, five- and six-
in-hand were common enough sights when
the district township's annual race meeting
was on, and owners were justly proud of
their spanking teams.' of greys, or browns.
It took more, driving ability,to handle some
of the,teams than it does these days to keep
a dud car going. A team, that took my eye
was one that the Kennedy Bros., of Wonna-
minta station (N.S.W.), used to drive. Ten
grey horses were coupled in. pairs to a large
buckbonrd. The driver held only four
reins attached to leaders and polers. ,
* * * *
“Spinner" : Big-game fishermen who doubt
if Australian waters can furnish material
for their exclusive sport might do worse
than try the Mulgmve River (N.Q.). Fish-
ing for barramundi recently one W. Foster,
of Fig-tree Creek, hooked a crocodile and
landed him. The line was a medium cotton
with a wire trace —whether a rod was used
or not is not mentioned in the communique
—and the feat was a notable one, though the
c,oc .\ was only seven feet long. Writer can
testify that on that coast the beasts run
up to 12 feet or more. The rest is up to
Zane Grey and his like.
NO BONUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Bruce denies the statement in the ‘Daily
Herald’ that his Government has decided to give a
bonus to men marrying half-caste women.”
There are chances for you beyond. the seas
that, never old England showed,
You chaps from Poplar and Limehouse way
and eke from the Old Kent-road:
Lands where stout hearts and willing hands
are pretty well all you need ;
But you mustn’t believe quite all you hear
or more than half you read.
There are right benevolent Governments on
Austral shores, you bet,
And they’re always bursting to give you
things you never would elsewhere get. '
You may wander into the far outback, from
Tail ami to Cue,
And for every ounce of gold you find they’ll
give you a bonus,.too.
They’ll give ..you a bonus—at least, they did
in the past, and for all I know
They’ll do it again—for every bushel of
golden grain you grow.
There are bonuses for cotton that’s white
and the same for wine that’s red,
For the beak and claw r s of the eagleliawk and
the scalp of the dingo dead.
But this is a canard sheer, my lads, and
it’s well it’s been quick denied:
No bonus waits for the hardy soul who
snavels a half-caste bride.
There’s no reward for that enterprise,
although I wouldn’t say
The notion mightn’t have been approved—if
votes were gained that way.
It’s hard to blast high hopes, my sons, and
to sadden venturous hearts,
Or to wooden out an industry before it
fairly starts.
You may link your lot with a damosel from
coffee tint to jet—
And that, of course, is your own affair—
but there isn’t a bonus yet!

LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home; chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

“Soda”: Fat Lombia, the one-eyed boss-
boy of the native hospital in Tulagi (Solo-
mon Islands), was the mildest, kindest, most
complacent coon I ever knew. He moved
among his patients, soothing them as medi-
cine could never do. He rarely took the
CALL TO PRAYER.
“If them outside, that caan’t get in, ’ll come up ’long to the front, there he a hempty
seat ’ere with no one in un.”
leisure time he was entitled to; indeed, he
slept, in the wards, usually near some patient
that needed more than ordinary attention.
And he was an ardent Christian, in a cheery,
monk-like way. Imagine my amazement
when I discovered that within his fat
hide there had been burning for a score of
years a flame of utterly fiendish hate. I
happened to witness the culminating act of
the diabolic vengeance with which he slaked
that flame. One night he came to me, as iv
was his duty to do,-and reported, the death
of one of his patients. In accordance with
formality I went back with him to see that
there was no mistake about it. Lombia
rarely , made mistakes. He made one that
night, however, not in reporting as he did,
but in getting down to his ghoulish business
too soon after I had left him. Had I not
heard him vociferating and turned back to
see what was wrong, the business he had
conducted so quietly hitherto would never
have come to light. So great was the up-
roar in the ward where I had left him wuth
the corpse that I was able without caution
to re-enter it unobserved. The place was
crowded with a staring mob, in the midst
of which were Lombia and the corpse, look-
ing for all the wrnrld as though they were
fighting. To my astonishment I saw 7 that
Lombia hold the corpse up by the hair of
its head, wdiilc he bashed it unmercifully,
roaring at the top of his voice. A moment
after my arrival he dropped the defunct
with a mighty wfflllop on the jaw. Then he
pounced on it, heaved it up by a limp
sprawling arm, and flung- it down savagely.
It took me and the mob a good five minutes
to overpower him. Then he had nothing to
say. When I reported the matter the C.M.O.
said the patient had come in from
some distance with a fractured shfell, quite
out of his senses, and had developed an
acute intestinal complaint that had baffled
diagnosis. Lombia had nursed him w 7 ith
extraordinary care. A post-mortem disclosed
that the patient had been imbibing some
harsh corrosive. The trial of Lombia on
a charge of murder revealed the fact that
the patient and Lombia were fellow-villagers,
that they had quarrelled over a woman when
they were youths, and that the patient had
given Lombia a father of a hiding, had
gouged out: one of his eyes, and had disgraced
him in the village for ever. Lombia made
a clean breast in court, chuckling evilly
When he described the agony lie had caused
his enemy by dosing him w 7 ith tots of the
caustic soda used for cleaning the drains.
Last I saw of Lombia he was cook at the
calaboose, and conducting himself as mildly,
kindly and complacently as ever.
if: $ ;J:
“Monty”: Corner Inlet and adjacent parts
of the Vic. coast are being invaded by giant
crabs, hitherto unknow’ii in southern waters.
The trespassers have torn up fishermen’s
nets and crawled into boats; at latest, resi-
dents w 7 ere in terror lest they might decide
on a hiking tour and start breaking into
houses and making merry with the furniture.
The crabs belong to the same species as those
of Japan, wdiich have a spread of over 10ft.,
and they are so fleshless that they are use-
less as food or even as fertiliser. Apparently
they have been driven inshore through lack
of sea-food, and unless this comes along to
lure them back to deep water, the fishing
industry in those parts seems doomed.
THE LIGHT AHEAD.
“I wouldn’t worry, Alf. Perhaps at this very minute there are millions of coral
insects building up an island for us.”
“Walkabout”: Crocodiles generally keep
to salt water, but one got out of its lati-
tude the other day in the Herbert River,
near Ingham (N.Q.)., As the Valley of
Lagoons mailman w r as swimming alongside
his horse in fresh water, one of the saurians
grabbed the animal and made off wuth it.
It happened near the mouth of the Herbert,
where a 39ft. Gin. croc, wnas shot.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: I can support “Polyp” in
his hurrah (B. 19/4/’33) about the w7on-
derful egg-laying abilities of
the green turtle. From a
small one, captured near
Madang, 212 fully-developed
eggs were taken out, and the
remainder, in all stages of de-
velopment, filled a large wash-
basin. Used in cake-making,
turtle eggs are excellent, but
they are somewhat too rich
for the average European
palate when cooked in the
ordinary way.
“Wobey” : ,My money goes
on the lady every time for
managing cows (B. 17/5/’33).
On a holiday at a sheep-farm
in Central Rivefina I was
asked to put the domestic 1 cow-
in the paddock. Releasing the
sliprails, I drove ’her up, but
she, stalled. “Get in, you
swine,”! I hissed. Immediately
she turned and ran 200 yards
down - the lane. When I
caught her up she took a swig-
out of the horse-trough, wast-
ing more time. I got her
back to the rails by pelting
her wuth anything that came
handy, but again she stopped
dead at the entrance and
w-ould not budge. While I
wondering if it would be safe
(for me) to pull her in by
the tail,,the missus came along
and, sizing up the situation,
quietly said “In, Silver, in.”
Thereupon Silver, with a
scornful glance in my direc-
tion, stepped daintily over the
rails into the paddock. I
asked old Mac, the yardman,
if he could explain, but he said it was be :
yond him. “Women and cows,” he added!
“are kittle cattle.”
“Amity Point”: Queensland naturalists
are agog over the stranding in Moreton Bay
of a, pigmy cachalot or sperm whale, a
variety of the toothed whale which is well
known in deep water, though it rarely comes
ashore. The beast was stranded after
cruising round tlie bay for some days, and
is now being prepared for its long home in
Brisbane museum. The specimen was over
nine feet long, with 14 teeth in the bottom
jaw only, after the usual fashion of the
cachalots. Fortunately he was considerate
enough to immolate himself in cold weather,
otherwise the job of taking a cast of him
would have been one for heroes.
“Old Timer” : “C. Coral’s” reference to the
fact that the Queensland boundaries extend
into Torres Strait almost up to the Papuan
shore (B. 7/6/’33) reminds that mention of
this was one of the few things calculated
to ruffle old Billy MacGregor. In that pro-
consul’s day the raiding Tugeri used to come
cast in their canoes from Dutch' territory
and play the devil with the inhabitants of
Boigu, Sabai and other islands inside the
Queensland line. MacGregor could not deal
with them there, and the Queensland Gov-
ernment never lifted a finger, all its inter-
est being in the rich shell beds which were
the reason of its grabbing the big slice of
Papuan water. However, Billy cut off his
Tugeri at last with the old Meirie England,
and few of them ever saw Dutch New*
Guinea again. He was careful in his re-
port to say that he had caught them in
Papuan water, and as the Queensland Gov-
ernment wasn’t represented on the spot it
had to take his word.
“Erua”: Maorilanders may occasionally
feel .their isolation, but it has its advantages.
Tackled -about the' presence of Australian
trawlers in waters M.L. considered peculi-
arly its own,.. the authorities counselled 4 a
• policy of “wait and see.” Their idea was
that the Australian ships wouldn’t make a
practice of such trawling, as sailors would
soon tire of the boisterous weather that
mainly prevails round M.L., and concerns
using oil power would lose enthusiasm on
account of the expense. Later developments
proved the supposition correct; one trawling
co. remarked that the fish were there all
right, but by the time they were landed in
the Australian market the eating process
was- almost equal- to “masticating banknotes.
❖ ❖ *
“Waiwera”: “Akeake” (B. 3/5/’33) would
have been quite safe in adding the kaka to
his list of Maoriland’s feathered weather-
prophets. In the years before w*e had a
barometer w-e had to rely solely on this
fellow to put us wise to the time the drought
was likely to break and he was never known
to let us down. When he left his grub-
digging for an hour or two, and circled the
bush with a few of his mates, all screeching
at top, it was an even bet the tanks would
be full before morning.
“WHY DIDN’ YA?”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Why don’t ya?” and “Why can’t ya?” ain’t
so bad —
They stop a man at times from going
wrong;
But one gets only ropeable and mad,
A rebel, when he hears that tiresome song.
Correction’s fair wdien words fit well,
But this “Why didu’ ya?” gag.... Oh, Hell!
Why didn’ ya hay the things in town
Before you had a drink?
Why didn’ ya think a hit and stop?
Why didn’ ya stop and think?
It always comes when it’s too late to mend,
When milk is spilt or fingers have been
burned,
When roughly one has learned the means or
end,.
When pleasant dreams to bitterness have
turned;
Like acid in an aching tooth
They drop this fool “Why didn’ ya?”. .. .
’Strutli!
What should he in the yard is out,
What’s out should he inside.
Why didn’ ya shut the flamin’ gate?
Why didn’ ,ya op’n it wide?
You’re set to ride a wicked bucking freak.
And stagger in the dust with “Where
am I?”
Or maybe pull a bogged cow 7 from the creek,
And drown yourself (or nearly) when
you try.
With dust of water you’re a wreck,
But get “Why didn’ ya?” in the neck.
“Why didn’ ya hold on with yer knees?
Why didn ’ ya call for dipt
To help ya, pull the hogged cow out?
Why didn’ ya learn to sicim ?”
I left Dad Peters’ farm for good to-day;
I’d swoim next time they fired that wheeze
at me
I’d stop whatever jaw 7 got in the way,
"Whose ever damfool jaw the same might
be;
I’d do my bit —put on the lid.
“Why didn’ I?” Well, to-day I did!
“Why didn’ ya” this? “Why didn’ ya” that?
I laugh as, on the track,
From hill and valley as I go
“Why didn’ ya?” echoes hack,

The Truth
About Catarrh
Remedies Galore
You have, uo doubt, tried dozens of
remedies, but you are still looking for the
one that will give you, happy relief. The
one remedy you have not tried is waiting
for you—a preparation containing vola-
tile oils known as Gatarrh-Clysmac. This
new volatile oil treatment has proved a
boon to thousands of sufferers v through-
out Australia. They have found its value
for chronic cold in tlio head as well as
for Catarrh in its more serious stages.
It has been so thoroughly tested and
proved so consistently true that the
money paid for the first package will be
refunded if it does not do what is
claimed. Catarrh-Clysmac can be bought
from any chemist for 1/9 or nearly three
times the quantity for 4/0.

J. T. Lang Is Adorable.
(By the “(Hub’s” Goulburn-street

One of the most sensational, thrilling and
moving dramas of the century, if not of all
time, was staged before a
packed house at Sydney’s
luxurious and ever-popular
Trades Hall, when J. T.
Lang, the highest-salaried
star known to Australian poli-
tics, in a sequence teeming
with stark passion and
human interest secured the
expulsion of another 74
members of the A.L.P. This

FOOT-ROT CURE.
“Jerrabomberra”; This autumn has taken
heavy toll of sheep by foot-rot—on Vic.-
N.S.AV. hill-country holdings one might count
more dead sheep than live. Rabbits and
drought are blamed; but after examining
some thousands of carcases I have hardly
seen one which w T as free from foot-rot. I
would say that, since the introduction of
carbon tetrachloride for fluke, foot-rot de-
stroys more sheep than all other diseases
put together. The special feature of this
disease is that sheep affected offer no resist-
ance to any other complaint or to hardship
which would otherwise be survived.
Further, the forms which foot-rot takes
nowadays are incomparably more obstinate
than they were 50 or 60 years ago. I can
remember when sheepmen used to trim and
dress the feet of the few infected animals
once a year after shearing. Of late years,
on the same areas, I have seen the sheep
toot-rotted every fortnight the whole year
round—with the disease as rampant as at
the beginning. Another matter is that where
su poring” or any other cause has brought
a dense growth of subterranean clover, sheep
walk wet-footed eight months out of the 12,
with foot-rot as the certain consequence.
In my opinion, the best mode of attack
ill hilly country, wherever there are moist
and dry areas, is to fence off the; dryer
areas from the wetter and use the latter for
large stock only. Even where there was
no springy, boggy land in a paddock but
011 y a rotten” creek (in which sheep will
paddle, about for hours every day when the
grass is dry) I have seen a wholesale infec-
tion cured when that creek was fenced off,
and the stock watered at a paved drinking-
trough. Every springy, green patch, every
moist black-soil gully and flat, every boggy
water-supply, is a continual death-trap in
slieep paddocks; and no satisfaction is pos-
sible until these breeding-grounds of infec-
tion are cut out.
It may be contended that this would be
too costly for the average grazier. But it is
more expensive to lose, say, a quarter of
your sheep, a third of your wool and half
your time in attending affected sheep. One
thing i s certain: where foot-rot is not easily
controllable it will pay better to cut out
steep ‘altogether and trust to cattle and
horses.
low-grade wools.
Leg Up”: During the last two years
publicity has been given to the assertion
that it did not pay growers to send their
locks in for sale and that much of the stuff
was being used in the making of roads. The
fact is that at the lowest point of the
market—June, 1932—there was some re-
turn from average locks, provided there was
no freight over 500 miles.
Whilst the wool market has not generally
advanced 100 per cent, since the;date'men-
tioned, prices for low-grades, such as stains,
locks and crutehings, have doubled them-
selves.
At the May series of Brisbane sales
locks realised an average of 4id., and-went to
bd for superior sorts. Growers should
take advantage of the present high prices
tor. low-grade lines. Attention given to
their preparation for market will be well
repaid by the removal of dags.
Besides saving in freight this will catch
the eye of overseas buyers on the lookout
tor clean lots. It is important to keep the
hoard locks, as a distinct line from table
locks, even if only one bale of each can be
made.
COUNTING SHEEP.
Jurnbuck ’: Methods vary. The most
successful way I have found is to take the
count coming to you. Stand well in front of
ihe counting-out gate, which must be secure
so that the rushing-out sheep will not force
the opening and make it too wide. Take
the count in threes to 99; the odd sheep
tor the hundred is easy enough to get. Call
at every hundred, and instruct the tally-
man to call each hundred out as they
come one, two, three, etc., until he reaches
the thousand. It’s bad policy to try to
count the sheep running away from you • you
can t see what is happening as they come out
“t the gate. By counting to you the sheep
can be checked should an undue rush occur
qr the counting-out gate be knocked down.
EFFECTIVE DIPPING.
“Liss” : I am afraid that if “W.D.Mc.”
(B. 7/0/’33) wore living in a bad fly area
he would find, in common with others, that
dipping is quite ineffective as a protection
against fly-strike. In the first place, no
arsenical dipping powder that is safe to
use as a dip is strong enough to keep sheep
immune from fly for any time, no matter
how short. >lt will not even kill maggots
on struck sheep in every case. Secondly,
what counts is penetration; if the poison
particles do not lodge on the skin, the mag-
gots will live underneath. Anyone who has
closely observed sheep struck after being im-
perfectly jetted will realise this.
“W.D.Mc.” says he would crutch before
dipping the second time, so presumably his
sheep would then be more or less half-
wool] ed. Why crutch, since he has previously
stated the necessity of having some growth
to absorb the dip? He. would be able to
dip only from 750 to 1000 of such sheep to
the case of dip. If he were to use the same
quantity of dip at jetting strength, which is
usually five times as strong as for dipping,
with a jetting plant he could effectively treat
1250 sheep, and there would be no need to
crutch prior to the operation. In fact, better
not.
An. effective preparation for jetting is a
solution of white arsenic at a strength of 81b.
to lOOgal. water, dissolved with an equal
quantity of washing soda. This should be
applied hot (for increased penetration) at
from 1201 b. to 1501 b. to the sq. in., accord-
ing to the amount of wool the sheep are
carrying. If a couple of pounds of soft soap
are added, the cleansing effect on the breech
is most marked.
Dipping must be considered effective if it
frees a flock from parasites and keeps them
so for a reasonable period, and only one
immersion is needed for this if it is pro-
perly carried out. The principal factors
which go to make success are a long swim
(or, at any rate, a fairly lengthy immersion,
during the course of which the sheep must
be ducked twice), soft water and a clean
muster. If there is one of these more im-
portant than the others it is the last.
Undipped sheep running through a flock will
act as hosts to the ticks and lice until the
dip is weakening through lapse of time on
the balance of the flock, which will become
infested’ in its turn.
As far as the fly is concerned, I think the
best one can do is to cull the wrinkly-
brceched sheep (Mules’s method does not
remove the wrinkle from tin- profiniy), and
make judicious use of both crutching and
jetting.
EAGLES AMONG LAMBS.
“G. J.A.S.”: The harm done by eagles
among the young lambs is far greater'than
supposed. The odd carcases left partially
eaten are nothing compared to those carried
off, .as a careful search along the . timbered
ridges will prove. Eagles’ main work is done
.soon after sunrise and again at -sundown. A
couple will in this way very soon reduce a 90
. per cent, lambing.
Dealing with these cunning birds we have
found in Westralia that poisoning is unsat-
isfactory. though traps have been useful.
A dead sheep (or, failing this, a kangaroo)
makes the best bait. Round it place three
or four rabbit traps, but don’t anchor them
to anything immovable, as an eagle when
caught will gradually pull its foot through
the jaws. Fix one end of a plough chain
to the trap arid the other to a small log, or
to some object which will move with the
efforts of the captive, yet hold him to the
ground.
No special care need be taken to hide
trap or chain. Now and then one has a
cunning customer to deal with. In that
case we remove a sod, coil the chain in
the hole and partially bury the trap, replac-
ing the sod over the chain. We have caught
as many as seven round one bait.
SCIENTIFIC FEEDING.
“Rosebery”: Fodder tables (B. 31/5/’33)
as a guide to correct feeding are of value,
but to use them properly intelligence is
necessary in adapting them to your condi-
tions. It is an easy matter to work out a
balanced ration for stock if hand-feeding is
exclusively practised. Nearly always a cer-
tain amount of grazing is obtainable, how-
ever, and to balance the ration the nature
and quantity of the pasture have to be
studied carefully. As “Hatter” states, it
would be uneconomical to feed expensive
concentrates when the natural pasture is of
good quality. It is well to remember that
protein is the expensive element, and also
that a good mixed pasture contains more
than enough of this nutrient.
On the other hand it is nearly as great
an error to waste the carbohydrates. For
instance, if green maize is fed to an average
dairy cow of about 9001 b. liveweight, a com-
paratively small amount is necessary to
supply a sufficiency of carbohydrates. It
would be impossible, however, to feed enough
of this fodder to supply the cow’s require-
ments in protein. The cow would require a
diet with a nutritive ratio of about 1:6: 9.
To obtain a sufficiency of protein she would
need to eat 2451 b., which is absurd.
If your pasture is of high quality, but
capable of supporting only half your herd,
a good daily ration to support the lot would
be: Sib. oaten chaff, 31b. bran. 21b. crushed
maize and lib. linseed cake. This ration is
almost perfectly balanced, but if your pas-
ture has an excess of clovers the chaff could
be increased slightly and the more expensive
concentrates reduced.
Study the individual tastes of your ani-
mals, and watch their condition carefully,, as
no two cows are exactly alike. The errors
in economical feeding can be summed up as:
(1) Errors of balance, (2) errors of cost.
(3) errors of overfeeding. (4) errors of
underfeeding, (5) unsuitability of food for
the particular animal and (6) irregularity
of feeding.
MAIZE SEED SELECTION.
“Tellem”: Hang a bag behind the cart
when corn pulling ; pick next year’s seed as
you pull the crop, and drop it in the bag.
For seed, choose heavy, long cobs, well cov-
ered by the husks, hanging down and
growing about sft. from the ground on
strong, healthy stalks. Never take a
seed cob off a fallen stalk. Tip the bag
out at the barn, husk the lot and select the
final seed cobs. These should be of good
weight for size, of a shape typical of the
variety, with even, close rows of grain run-
ning right to the tip, and free of weevil,
moth or disease. The grain should be tight
on the core and, when shelled, sound, heavy
and plump. Cut off the butts and tips of
the finally-selected cobs, and when thor-
oughly dry shell the remaining grain. To
keep free from weevils and moths, pour the
grain through the hole of a newly-opened
kerosene-tin and solder up, making the tin
airtight.
By this method of selection a much better
potential crop is secured than by the usual
system of picking the crop over in the barn,
where there i.s no indication of the seed’s
field habit, which is all important.
Some farmers don’t trouble to save seed
at all, but regularly buy each season from
the store or seedsman. Apart from being
cheaper" home-grown seed, has the advantage
of being thoroughly selected, and is accli-
matised —another important factor.
HOME-CUB ED BACON.
‘‘Dunmow”: Once upon a time, before
bacon-curing became a large-scale industry
in Australia, and when communications were
more difficult than they are to-day, the home-
curing of bacon and hams was part of the
ordinary routine on many outback stations
and farms. Now the practice jseems to have
lapsed, but with reasonable care there are
no difficulties in the process for the beginner,
and it offers a way of profitably disposing of
the station or farm pig which cannot be
sent, to market.
Supposing the pig to have been properly
prepared and cut up, the first essential is
a reasonably low temperature, for which
reason most home-curers do their work in
winter. Forty-five degrees is the ideal tem-
perature. The meat should be placed on
a table and covered with equal parts of
powdered salt and saltpetre, remaining thus
for 24 hours. Then, after wiping, place the
pieces in a brine pickle. A mixture for
about 4001 b. of pork consists of clean water.
251 b. pickling salt, 51b. brown sugar, lib.
saltpetre and jib. allspice. This, of course,
can be reduced or increased for smaller or
larger quantities. Put the spice in a thin
bag or cloth, boil the water, add ‘ the sugar
and salt. After two hours’ boiling and
skimming, add the spice bag and boil for
another half-hour. The brine should be
allowed to cool down to about 45 degrees
in a clean cask. Then put in the meat and
stir. Leave the meat in for four days, stir-
ring regularly, and then take it out to drain
for a short time. Sprinkle it with salt and
return to the pickle. The curing pi-ocess
should take from three weeks to a month,
longer time being allowed for the hams.
At the end of the curing period the cuts
should be soaked in a cold solution of a
pound of washing soda to every 20 gallons
of water for three hours and then washed
in warm water. They should then be hung
up to dry. being covered with calico or other
clean, light material. Drying is an im-
portant part of the process. Three days in
a room with a good air current and with
insects guarded against should be allowed, and
if conditions are damp a light fife will help.
After the pieces are given a light rub with
olive oil they are ready for the smoke.
The smokehouse need not be an elaborate
affair. If a suitable shed is not already
available, a small galvanised-irop hut can
bo run up. There must' be ventilation at
the roof and the walls should be sunk. Let
the cuts have plenty of room when hanging
so as to give the smoke free access. Make
the fire with, some good hardwood, and top
up with sawdust, corncobs or dry leaves,
being careful to see.that the room is fail'll
airtight, so that the fire will smoulder and
not blaze. Keep an eye on the temperature;
this should not exceed 90 degrees. Anything
higher can be lowered by admitting more
air or damping off the fire.
The time for correct smoking varies with
weather conditions and the nature of tin;
smokehouse, but 24 hours is generally
enough, the pieces being right when they
are dry to touch and a bright tan in color.
The fire should then be put out and the
pieces left hanging to cool. When they are
thoroughly cooled, give them another slight
rub with olive oil and bag them, in calico
for choice. While waiting for use, keep
the meat dry and in a dark place ; it can
be packed in dry oats, bran or chaff if kept
covered. In fly-time, a free sprinkling with
pepper will do no harm.
CITRUS ACID CONTEXT.
• “7346” : The necessity of testing the acid
content of early navels has been demon-
strated by results in the markets of Sydney
and Melbourne. Following Californian prac-
tice. the Departments of Agriculture in Vic.,
N.S.W. and Q. agreed on an acid test
for early oranges. The test was that not more
than 26 c.c. of alkali should be required to
neutralise the acid in 10 c.c. of orange-juie \
In Melbourne the department has found it.
necessary to condemn consignments of early
navels owing to high acid content.
Some growers in N.S.W. and S.A. who
have been the chief offenders apparently do
not realise that large oranges are more
mature as a rule than small oranges, and
that color of rind is little, if any, indication
of acid content. Thus a grower may bring
large oranges to a packing-house to be tested,
and if these, though partially green of rind,
pass the test he assumes that he is safe in
picking oranges of any size, provided they
are more forward in color of rind than the
samples.
This is a fallacy. Oranges from at leas!
a dozen trees per acre should be submitted
for test, and these should be of the sinallesl
size it is proposed to harvest. One M.I.A.
grower this season was told that, while his
small counts _ (large oranges) had passed
the test, his bigger counts (smaller oranges)
had failed. Yet the whole consignment had
been picked from the same trees.
This season in testing many samples of
oranges I found that one of the lowest acid-
content tests came from half-green oranges
and one of the highest from oranges fully
colored. If growers will remember that
oranges larger than those submitted for test
should be, the only ones picked for the early
market, they need not trouble about rind
color, as most up-to-date packing-houses have
an ethylene-gas plant installed which brings
the rind up to the color desired.
HYBRID CHICKS.
“Jack point”: First crosses between pure
breedsi are. rapidly increasing in popularity
in the U.S.A., many hatcheries catering ex-
clusively for the trade. They possess many
advantages: a first cross is always more
vigorous and disease-resistant than a pure-
bred : egg production is as good or very
nearly so, and the hens have a longer useful
life. _ The sex of most hybrids can be dis-
tinguished at birth owing to different colors
and markings, conforming to what Mendel
terms sex-linked inheritance, so sellers can
guarantee 100 per cent, pullets to egg-
farmers, and 100 per cent, cockerels to
farmers who rear cockerels to the broiler
stage. Here again the vigor of the hybrids
makes for economical gains in weight,
whether or not caponising is practised.
Before anybody rushes into the business,
a study of the disadvantages of hybrids is
necessary. In America most poultry-
farmers buy their chicks annually from the
hatcheries, avoiding the worry of breeding
pens and incubators. A man who set out
to breed and hatch his own hybrids would
be giving himself double work. Anything
but first crosses is worse than useless. It
would still be necessary to continue with
two lots of pure-breds for breeding, and use
the hybrids for laying and table.
DISTEMPER IN DOGS.
“Gland”: I was invited to treat
a valuable cattle-dog for distemper. The
owner had tried various remedies without
success, and concluded by informing me that
even a penny had had no effect. He added
that to secure the maximum effect the coin
should be bent over and then pushed down

Consult Your Local Authorised Bedford Dealer,
the dog’s throat, his theory being that the
germs would be collected between the bent
portions of the coin and carried out of the
body when it was evacuated. The dog was
beyond all aid. The “cure” is on all tours
with Others as weird and wonderful.
Usually distemper lias made much pro-
gress before it is recognised that a cure is
difficult. A running at the nose and eyes
is one of the first and chief symptoms. If
the disease becomes virulent, there may be
paralysis of the extremities. Inflammation of
the lungs frequently follows, with diarrhoea.
Protracted cases are attended by eruptions
on the chest and abdomen, and the skin takes
a yellow hue. These are always fatal
symptoms.
Correct treatment is to isolate affected dogs
immediately upon noting signs of moping,
disinclination for food and lack of energy.
Where the dog is housed ensure freedom from
draughts and build up resistance by light
and nutritious food. Where the trouble lias
been diagnosed and proper steps have been
taken more or less satisfactory results follow.
In the majority of instances there is a failure
to recognise the disease in time, and the sub-
sequent treatment has been incorrect.
In England they have evolved a preven-
tive formula of two inoculations separated
by a week. A dose of vaccine induces tem-
porary resistance; a dose of virus con-
verts the resistant state into lasting immu-
nity. At present the treatment has two
drawbacks. One is that it has to be per-
formed by a veterinary surgeon with a hypo-
dermic syringe. The other is that the cost
is about a guinea for each animal.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
In vieio of the cheapness and efficiency of
charcoal gas as a fuel for tractors, how is
it that this system has not been more gener-
ally adopted by tractor owners? —62ls.
< )ne of the reasons is that the earlier
makes of plants were of very crude design.
They were not out of the experimental stage.
It was found that when equipped with one
of these plants a tractor lost a great deal
of power and lacked flexibility; when pulled
up by a heavy load, the engine had no pick-
up, and would not respond to the throttle.
The grate burnt out quickly and was easily
obstructed, and clinker formed on the linings.
In one or two instances the cleaning of the
gas was not good, so that a large propor-
tion of ash and dust was carried into the
engine and impaired the lubrication with
disastrous results. These defects have been
overcome in the latest type of plant. There
are still various matters which require care-
ful consideration before the system is in-
stalled, as the plant must be adapted to the
fuel available, and the motor requires cer-
tain structural alterations. Charcoal Trac-
tion Engineers, Ltd., Toorak-road, South
Yarra, could give you very helpful advice if
you are considering conversion to suction
gas.
(1) Is there a market in Sydney for mush-
rooms aud what price could I eoopc&t? (2)
Same information regarding rhubarb and
celery?, —6o64.
(3.) There is always a market in Sydney
for mushrooms at prices which average about
fid. per pound, provided they are in good
condition and carefully packed, with the
stalks cut off. (2) Both rhubarb and celery
should find a buyer at any time provided
they are bunched and in good condition.
Average prices obtained recently are 2s. 6d.
per doz. bunches for rhubarb and 3s. to 4s.
od-.-p.er doz. bunches for celery.
Possibilities of keeping apples in cellars
for a limited period, arid how to construct a
cellar for this purpose with capacity for,
say, 400 cases? —6467.
It should be possible to keep apples in a
suitable cellar for some months. The length
of storage life will depend on the variety,
the earlier varieties being less suitable and
the later varieties, say from Jonathan on,
being more suitable owing to their firmer
texture. The apples should be picked just
before the green color turns to yellow. If
picked too green the fruit will shrivel, and
if allowed to turn yellow on the tree It will
break down earlier. It is essential that the
fruit be handled as carefully as eggs, for the
slightest bruising will seriously affect the
keeping quality. It should be stacked in
kcro.-boxes or similar receptacles and not in
bags or large bins. As to the construction
of the cellar, it should be dark, not too
damp, and certainly not draughty. . Exact
procedure depends on location. If you can
put it under a fruit shed so much the better;
line with concrete if the soil is likely
to be very wet. Ventilation should be pro-
vided by slatted trapdoors on top, but these
may need to be covered in periods of very
dry weather.
llow> to make up 40 gallons of nicotine
sulphate for use on garden plants?— 64o2.
Take 41b. soft soap, J-pint nicotine sul-
phate. 21b. arsenate of lead and 40gal. soft
water. Work up the soap to a liquid form
with some of the water made hot, and mix
all well together.
Method of crystallising dried fruits—
peaches, apricots, prunes, etc.? —639B.
Can’t be done with dried fruits. All fruits
must be fresh, ripe but firm, unbruised, and
large kinds should be halved and stoned. The
process is long and troublesome. Allow lib.
sugar and 1 pint of water to every 21b. of
fresh fruit. Drop the fruit into boiling
water, and cook gently for about lOmin. or
until soft but not broken. Make a syrup
with the measured fresh water and sugar
and cook it to the soft-ball stage; then drop
in the fruit. Remove from the fire and
stand all day in warm oven, turning the fruit
occasionally. Repeat this operation four
times on four successive days, each time
skimming out the fruit and letting the syrup
come to the boil again. The fifth day make
a new syrup with 31b. sugar and 3 pint
water, and when it boils to the stage at
which it can again be formed into a soft
ball, place the fruit in the syrup and remove
from the fire. When the syrup is cool, dip
out the fruit and put in a shallow pan to
harden and candy, keeping it at 65deg. Fahr.
pack in boxes between layers of waxed
paper, with a slight sprinkling of sugar on
each layer. Cover tightly. The lengthy
process is necessary to induce the sugar to
enter the fruit and act as a preservative.
Recipe for preserving apricots, peaches and
apples in small quantities with acid or caus-
tic lye? —sSo7.
For apricots and peaches make up a solu-
tion of 4oz. caustic soda in 4 gallons water
and bring to the boil. Place the fruit, which
should be firm and sound, in wire baskets,
and dip in the boiling solution for a few
seconds. Set aside to dry, then halve them,
remove the stones and set out on trays to
dry in the sun or in a mild oven. They
should be cured in about four days. Place on
a table on a verandah, roughly-piled into
heaps, for a few days to air, then pack in
waxed paper or kitchen paper in small
tins or boxes. If these fruits are free ol
pests and diseases, they can be dried without
being first dipped in the soda solution. lor
apples, peel and core them, slice thinly, and
throw into a solution of 2 tablespoons sail
to 1 gallon water, cold. Allow to soak for
an hour, then lay out on a clean white
cloth on a sheet of iron. Leave for three days
in the sun to dry, bringing in at night ;
then thread on strings, and hang up until
they feel springy when touched. Store in
airtight tins. Cooking apples are better to
dry than the dessert varieties.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Valerin”: If a cut Stencil brand breaks
and you’re in a hurry, cut one out of a piece
of cardboard. It will see the shearing
through.
“Beady”: When packing kerosene-tins of
fat for transport to market, cut off about
4in. of the bottom of an empty tin and force
it into top of filled tin; it effectually seals
the package.
Petrol- and kero.-tins are cer-
tainly useful when flattened for building and
repairs; but not after “Bushman’s” process
(B. 7/6/’33), as all the protective tin is
burnt off. I use an axe or tomahawk to
run round the tops and bottoms ; then with
a tin-opener split them along one corner of
the sides, and thus preserve the tinning.
This does the job quicker than messing about
with a fire.
“Tena” : Tarnished nickel harness fittings
can be cleaned by rubbing with a paste made
of pumice stone and sweet oil. Harness
should not be allowed to hang where it is
subject to the fumes from fresh manure or
be kept near chemical fertilisers.
“Speranza”: For sand in horses, make a
drench of lib. honey in a pint of warm milk.
The drench should be given after starving
the animals for 12 hours. Repeat every few
days, if necessary. Food can be given an
hour or two after drenching.
“F.A.R.”: Mend the leaking hurricane
lamp with dripping. Pour clean, melted
dripping into the lamp, and when it has set
fill as usual with oil. Boil the wick in about
half pint of vinegar and dry before placing
it in the lamp. You will find that it will
not only last much longer, but will give a
brighter light.
“R.8.M.”: The best gauge-marker for
fencing posts is hoop-iron, as it cannot be
broken if ill-used. Turn a piece of hoop-
iron at right angles about 3in. from one end,
so that it will hang on top of the post, and
make the length a little lower than' the
bottom hole. Mark the gauge with a file,
and you have a tool which will last a life-
time.
“Deekay”: A farmer with sheep on his
property will find it worth while to look
out for' hawks’ and crows’ nests in the nest-
ing season, and blow them out of the tree
with a gun. He will not only destroy the
young ones, but prevent immediate losses
amongst the stock, as the old birds are much
more destructive at this season.
“Werrimee”: The post of a rail fence that
is split down the middle need not be dis-
carded if the wood is sound. Put a piece
of No. 8 wire round it near the top rail
and twitch tightly, or draw the two parts
together with a small cramp and bind them
with a piece of hoop-iron. Another way is
to put a thin bolt through the post near the
top.
“Gulliver”: Knock off at least half an
hour before sunset and give the horses a
chance to dry off before nightfall. Plough-
ing up to sundown this weather is courting
strangles.
“Tenrag”: Tips on calf-rearing. Handle
quietly and patiently, and feed regularly and
in uniform quantities with clean, sweet milk.
Feed the milk at body temperature, as cold
milk requires a great deal of the animal's
energy to heat it up to a point at which
digestion can take place. Keep buckets
clean. Have shade in summer, shelter from
winter wind and rain, and provide a suit-
able lick of salt and bonemcal.
“Gumblegubbin”: When horses are feed-
ing where spear grasses and other grasses
with oat-like seeds are in head, watch their
mouths, as these seeds or their awns some-
times stick in the gums and under or at the
side of the tongue. Some vets, advise syring-
ing the mouth daily when the feed is dry, but
trouble can usually be detected by opening
the mouth or parting the lips at the side.
“Eilliab”: It’s worth while winning
potato-growing competitions. G. E. Brien,
of Oberon (N.S.AV.), who won the local
A., H. and P. Association’s, has disposed of
his stock of 300 tons of marketable potatoes
largely as a result of the publicity his win
received. And consider the experience of T.
E. Fuller, of Spring Terrace, in the Orange
district. Conlon Bros., of Exeter, who won
the southern district competition in 1932
and 1933, got the seed of their winning
exhibits .from Brien three years ago.
“Tenrag”: With a total of 7601 b. of
butter-fat in 298 days, a grade cow in the
herd of R. A. Candy, Hamilton (M.L.).
has again shown the best production record
of the 110,000 cows tested by the M.L. Co-
operative Herdtesting Association. Through-
out the test the cow was hand-milked, and
the only food in addition to pasture was a
small daily allowance of bran.
“F.A.R.”: I keep down rabbits with
apples poisoned with strychnine; the secret
of getting a particularly good haul is to give
them two free feeds beforehand. By just
laying the poisoned trail I have* had very
few scalps, but after the two feeds }oz.
of strychnine has accounted for hundreds.
Apples are cheap.

Can you tell me anything about the Orm-

It was found at Great Ormside in West-
moreland, England, and is to be seen in the
York Museum. It is a small bowl about
five and a half inches. across, made of
silver and lined with copper. It is covered
with a very beautiful vine-scroll pattern
in repousse, and has graceful and fantastic
birds and animals perched among the curv-
ing vine steins. Its date is placed at about
700 a.d. and it probably is a product of the

Hoic to take the rubber off an old motor-
car tyre? —63l9.
Almost an impossible job for the amateur,
as the aim of manufacturers is to incorpor-
ate rubber and fabric so thoroughly that
they cannot be separated. A method which
gives good results in experienced hands is
to shred the old material finely, cover it
with a strong solution of caustic soda, and
heat it under pressure for several hours.
The mass is then washed repeatedly in
water to remove the alkali, when the result-
ant pure rubber may be formed into sheets.
Special appliances are needed to make a
satisfactory job.

hands are met with in most of the work.

In a game of four-handed euclire B deals.
A. orders B. up. B goes alone, takes all
tricks and scores four points. Can B elect
to go alone? —6428.
The point is not dealt with in either the
American or English Hoyle, but B’s right
is undoubted on general principles.
I have a sheep pup with an undershot jaw
'whose eyeteeth are cutting into the roof of

(1) What has the preference clause of the
Queensland shearing industry award got to
say regarding the employment of unionists?
(2) Must an employer ascertain whether
his employees are unionists or not? —6428.
“Preference of employment shall be given
to financial members of the Australian
Workers’ Union or to persons who give the
employer an undertaking, in writing, to
' make application to join such union in the first
shed in which he is employed. No person shall
continue, or be continued, in employment
after his first pay day in such shed unless
he has made such application and tendered
the fee prescribed by the rules of the union.”
The onus is on the employer to see that the
men comply with the conditions.
(1) Is Dr. Carroll’s hook “Health and
Longevity’’ a reliable guide as to food values?
(2) Is food science far enough advanced to
tell whether a food has or has not vitamin
value? (3) Names of some recognised
authorities? (4) Is it wise to eat foods that
have no vitamin value? (5) Is the tomato
a good food, raw or. tinned? (6) Is it
detrimental to people suffering from rheu-
matoid arthritis or like ills? (7) Docs boil-
ing, pasteurising or chilling milk kill its food
value? —6288.
(1) No. It was written before vitamins
were recognised. (2) Yes. (3) In Sydney,
Prof. Priestley; abroad, Profs. Plimmer,
Mellanby. Gowland Hopkins. McCollum,
Bainbridgo and Mendel. (4) Eat what
agrees with you. The fact that a food is
poor in vitamins means nothing harmful.
(5) Yes. It is rich in vitamin C and is
credited with a beneficial action on the
liver. (6") Not in the least. It is reckoned
to be good for such complaints. (7) Boil-
ing destroys vitamin C, but the value of the
process in destroying harmful germs is such
that the safeguard should not be neglected
unless you know positively that your milk

(1) What, is a “genius”? I’ve read dic-
tionary definitions and I’ve heard of the tag
about the “capacity for taking infinite pains,”
but what’s the general ,view of the matter?
(2). Does genius necessarily involve creative
ability? (3) Is young Philip Hargrave a
genius ? —6427.
(1) and (2) Most authorities, on diction
make “genius” and “talent” in some respects
synonymous. The Latin word “genius” in-
dicates the spirit of a person or place, and
its roots show that the spirit is a creative
one and that (in the case of an individual)
it gives an inclination to some particular
occupation. The genius is not always a
pioneer or originator of new ideas ; he may
manifest his possession of exceptional powers
by executing old ideas better than they have
ever been executed before. Almost always,
however, a genius, whether he’s a cook, a
military commander or a musical composer,
tells the world something it didn’t know
before. (3) That’s a matter of opinion
rather than of fact. The Bulletin's critics
of music in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney
credit tlie boy with the power which Noah
Webster defined when he wrote that “genius
reaches its ends by a kind of intuitive power.”
(1) Number of subjects in degree and
diploma courses in commerce at Melb. Uni.
and time taken to complete degree course?
(2) Qualifications necessary to gain admis-
sion to both courses? (3)- Can a person who
has completed a diploma course take a degree
course? .(4) Are copies of the lectures in
the various subjects obtainable? (5) Fees
for both , courses and wliat charge is made
for typed notes? (6) From what Uni. pub-
lication, can full information be obtained?—
6148.
(1) The number of subjects taken is four-
teen for degree and nine for diploma. Full-
time students may complete the degree course
in three years. (2) Candidates for admis-
sion to the degree course must have matricu-
lated and have passed in a language other
than English at the school leaving examina-
tion. Tlie qualification for admission to the
diploma course is the school intermediate
examination. (3) Candidates who have
completed the diploma course may proceed
to the degree course, with credit for subjects
already passed, by passing at the school
leaving examination in tlie two subjects cor-
responding to the subjects of Group V which
they propose to take in the degree course.
Where a candidate intends ultimately to
proceed to the degree after obtaining the
diploma, lie should apply in the first place
for admission to the degree course, provided
lie is so qualified. (4) In most subjects of
the course typed summaries of the lectures
are available from the Department of Com-
merce.' (5) Lecture fees are £2 9s. per term,
or £7 7s. per annum for each of the sub-
jects peculiar to tlie commerce course. Fees
for arts subjects are £2 9s. per term, and
for Part I science subjects £3 10s. per term.
Sports and clubhouse fees,, amounting to
£2 11s.. are payable by day students. Even-
ing students are required to. pay only a club-
house fee of 10s. 6d. The fees for typed
notes are ss. per anum for each subject,
payable with the first term’s lecture fees.

the University calendar and also in the Stu-
dents’ Handbook, obtainable at the Univer-
sity Bookroom, Is. 6d. (postage 2d.).
When is the best time to prune roses (1)
in Sydney, (2) on the Bine Mountains?
(3) How to rid rose-bushes of white aphis
and mildew? —6225.
(1) July. (2) August or early September.
(3) After pruning, paint the stems with
lime-water or spray with Black Leaf 40
(trade strength). Lime-sulphur spraying or
dusting with dry sulphur is an antidote for
mildew.
Procedure to follow in marking out and
drilling bakelite panels for radio receivers?
—6325.
Lay out the positions of all the holes with
a pencil on a sheet of paper the exact size
of the panel and fasten the paper to the
panel with library paste. Each point for
drilling is now marked by placing a sharp
prick punch on the pencil mark and tapping
the punch with a light blow with a hammer.
Remove the paper and go over all the holes
with a centre punch. To drill, place the
panel on a flat piece of wood, using a few r
brads to hold it firm. To prevent the drill
from slipping, small holes about l-16in.
diameter are drilled and then followed with
drills of the correct size. Stop when the
point of the drill just pierces the underside
of the panel. When all the holes are com-
pleted thus, turn the panel over and bore
from the reverse side. This will prevent
the holes breaking away at the edges. The
size of the holes may be increased with a
reamer.
What are the rates of tax payable in
Maoriland under the Gift Duty Act? —6500.
Up to £5OO. nil; £5OO to £lOOO, 2f p.c.;

71 p.c.; over £lO,OOO, 10 p.c.
What is “caisson disease,” usually associated
with divers ? —6468.
After immersion under pressure the blood
becomes more or less saturated with nitrogen
in dissolved form, and when the pressure is
relaxed the surplus gas is given off. If this
happens rapidly, bubbles of gas form in the
circulatory system, causing asphyxiation,
paralysis and death, according to the inten-
sity. The effect does not manifest itself
under pressures less than two atmospheres
absolute, but for depths greater than 35ft.
or 40ft. the ascent to the surface must be
made slowly.
(1) Ingredients and quantities of a
sausage seasoning for beef goods ( cheap mix-
ture wanted ) f (2) Ingredients and quanti-
ties to make a pickle which will give a good
color to pickled meat? —6358.
(1) Mix together 4oz. salt, 4oz. pepper,
2oz. dried thyme leaves, a dash of dried sage
leaves, and rather less than loz. brown sugar.
Pound well together, and use about loz. to
every pound of meat. Make a careful note
of quantity used, and test a batch of sausages
for effect; alter the proportions accordingly,
as tastes vary so much that a general effect
should be sought. (2) Saltpetre gives the
color. Mix together in a large boiler 3gal.
water, 61b. salt, 21b. sugar and 3oz. salt-
petre. Bring to the boil, skim occasionally
until it i.s clear, boil at least 30min., strain
into a tub, and let stand until cold, when
it is ready for use.
Recipe for a soothing face cream for use
after shaving? —6373.
White wax, joz.; spermaceti, 240 z.; oil
of sweet almonds, 210 z.; rosewater. 140 z.;
ammonium carbonate, enough to color
to desired shade. Melt the wax. sper-
maceti and oil of almonds together over
gentle heat; remove from the fire, add
the rosewater, and begin to beat until
it shows signs of being creamy, then
drop in the coloring to the required shade
and beat to a cream. A few drops of oil
of rose may be added if perfume is required.
The ingredients must be exact in measure-
ment.
Method of controlling the volume in a
battery-operated receiver? —6436.
Connect the two fixed contacts of a 10,000-
ohm potentiometer to the aerial and earth
terminals of the receiver. The lead which
was formerly joined to the aerial terminal
is now taken to the moving contact of the
potentiometer. An alternative method is to
connect the fixed contacts of a 500.000-ohm
potentiometer across the secondary of the
LF transformer if one is used. The grid
bias lead is removed at the transformer end
and connected to the moving contact of the
potentiometer.
(1) Details of the carbonic-acid fire extin-
guisher? (2) Nature of chemicals used? —
6478.
(1) This is a cylindrical copper tank with
hose attached filled with water and bicar-
bonate of soda. In a glass container kept
separate from the soda solution is sulphuric
acid. When the, acid and soda solutions are
mingled carbonic-acid gas is formed, creat-
ing considerable pressure and propelling the
water through the hose with great force.
The gas. which is carried along -with the
water, also helps to extinguish th« fire. (2)

Method of carbonising wool for use in
m attress-washmg ?- —6400.
The process requires special machinery.
The wool is steeped in a dilute solution of
sulphuric acid, drained in a hydro-extractor
and heat-dried at a temperature of about
250 deg. Fahr. All vegetable matter is de-
stroyed by carbonisation. The wool is well
washed in_ water made .sufficiently alkaline
to neutralise any free acid which may re-
main. and again dried. A solution of chloride
of aluminium may be used instead of sul-
phuric acid, and is said to be safer to handle
than the latter. Communicate with the
Queensland Department of Agriculture if you
seriously intend taking up this work.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Belar, the V.R.C. Grand National Hurdle
favorite, dislodged his jockey at the second-
last obstacle in the Toolambool Hurdle at
Caulfield on Saturday when leading the field
by several lengths. But for the accident he
probably would have won, although Lynden,
with R. Inkson up, was making a nice
forward move. Entering the straight the
riderless Belar bored in on Zygon and then
swerved out, impeding Lynden. Lynden
suffered most and was exceedingly unlucky
to lose by half a head to Zygon. Zygon is
trained by R. Bradfield for F. S. Austin, a
Western District pastoralist. Years have
elapsed since Bradfield’s stable last sheltered
a jumper.
There is no reason why Belar should
lessen in Grand National demand because
of the mishap. An occasional spill has its
educative effect, and the Warrnambool geld-
ing may be more careful hereafter. He was
backed for a small fortune by stable-fol-
lowers, as he shortened from 9 to 2 to 5 to 2.
Three of the competitors, Lynden, Belar
and Poidale, claim Poitrel as sire.
Enthusiasm was aroused when old Moss-
trooper threw out a challenge to The Cracks-
man in the Wanda Steeplechase. Gus
Power’s gallant chestnut put in a long run,
and Tom Butler, on The Cracksman, was
compelled to sit down in earnest on his
mount. Mosstrooper could not get nearer
than half a length, but he was lustily cheered
on returning to scale. Three years ago the
son of Kenilworth swept the boards in jump-
ing events, taking the G. N. Hurdle (lOst.
71b.), the G. N. Steeplechase (list. 191 b.)
and the Australian Hurdle (list lllb.).
Last winter he showed a glimpse of form oy
running third. in the G. N. Steeple with
I2st. 71b. He has 101 b. more in the National
than he carried on Saturday and will meet
The Cracksman on 181 b. worse terms. The

Having decided to give Gallantie another
chance on the turf before her retirement,
C. B. Kellow produced the Heroic filly for
the Richmond Handicap. She was made a
hot favorite, but was never in the picture
Sharpe was given the mount on Gallantie
in the enforced absence of Duncan; despite
reassuring bulletins it is feared that Duncan
will never ride again. The race went to
Heroic Prince, whom Kellow must regret
having sold. Leek is doing remarkably well
with the gelding, who started at the nice
odds of 10 to 1. In a rattling .finish he
vanquished the Westralian Alienist by a
long neck. S. B. Ferguson trains Alienist;
he landed the Rosny Plate with his own
horse, Chilperic, who was next in demand
to Harry Gavin. The poor start robbed
Harry Gavin of all hope of first money, but
he almost got third. Brave Boy (9 to 4)
went down before Sea Rover (10 to 1) in
the Cambria Welter. With an experienced
rider up, he would have won at his last two
starts. The Heroic colt is a classy cnlloper.
* * * *
Batro and Craig are picking up a lot of
money with Moa Lap, by Moabite -St.
Patricia. The colt won again at Rosehill
on Saturday and was one of the favorites,
but McShortodds adjudged the Juvenile
Stakes so open that he called 6 to 1 the field.
Heroic Queen made most of the running,
but was challenged by Moa Lap a furlong
from the judge and was unable to shake
him off, going under by a neck. Art, another
6 to 1 shot, was a fairly close third. Moa
Lap carried 9st. 131 b.; he lias humped as
much as lOst. 61b. to victory. He was under
the whip for 'a furlong, and stuck to his 30b
gamely. ....
McShortodds took no risk with Le Touquet
iii the first division of the Maiden Handicap.
Payten’s gelding (he is a tliree-year-old by
Ronsard— Havre) was never better than 5
to 4, and finished at even money. D. Munro
took him quickly to the front and kept him
there until he reached the winning post
three-quarters of a length in front of Nardale
(10 to 1), who cut the second favorite
Gladium (3 to 1) out of second money. Le
Touquet had not raced m public since March
15 when he ran unplaced in the Rosebery
Flying Handicap. The second division went
to Gayhawk (3 to 1), who was not troubled
to beat Venusta (7 to 2) and Lionhearted
(10 to 1). Merry Mount (5 to 4) was
hailed as a good thing for the third division,
but he never gave his backers a thrill. The
race went to Nyrambla (10 to 1) from
Newsham (20 to 1) and Fernclove (12 to 1).
Lightning March’s failure in the Dundas
Handicap was a setback for punters. 011
his brilliant showing in the A.J.C. Exeter
Handicap, the chestnut was considered un-
beatable and went out at 7 to 4. He finished
fifth after plodding in the rear for most of
the journey. La Vixen (5 to 1) took out
the money after a rattling good battle with
Greensea (8 to 1), Cush’s prad being beaten
by a long neck. Brazenface (8 to 1) was a
length further back. Greensea’s showing
was a decided improvement on his sixth in
the Ascot Flying Handicap ten days pre-
viously, and he should take out a race or
two before the season closes.
The June Handicap, 11 furlongs, attracted
only five runners, which says little for the
class of middle-distance horses in training
this season. Punters marked down Phlare
(2 to 1) and Magnaver (5 to 2) as the
most likely pair, and Magnaver looked to
have an excellent chance in the straight,
but Akuna came with a clinking run and
easily disposed of the Magpie prad; the
margin was four lengths. Akuna eased from
3 to 1 to 9 to 2. This Archery—Fallingbrook
mare is well down in the weights and should
show up again pretty soon.
Vigorously ridden by Darby Munro, Love
Song (4 to 1) broke a lengthy trot of re-
verses by carrying off the Parramatta Mile.
Rowan looked a winner 50 yards from the
judge, but the Hunting Song gelding un-
wound a tremendous burst of speed and
downed his rival by three-quarters of a
length, Samian King (20 to 1) being third.
Old Crown Area was backed from an outside
price to 6 to 1, but found the company much
too hot for him.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
When Muir dived at Lundyn's legs and
scored a fall in the first quarter-minute at
Leichhardt on Saturday, it looked as if, for
once, there would be an early finish. Appear-
ances were deceptive; the Finn recovered,
and brought Muir down in the fourth. In
the next round he gave a fetching imitation
of a pouter-pigeon strutting round, and,
after a lot more larking in the last round,
he seemed to have Muir at his mercy. Then
the former Melbourne Grammar School boy
suddenly back-slammed him, and won by two
falls to one. Union rules had prevailed
once more.

Melbourne in the Vic. League have provided
many a thrilling scuffle, and Saturday’s,
watched by 30,000 people, was no exception.
Going off 'at great pace and combining well
South had its supporters smiling at quarter
time, when the Red and Whites had a 24-
point lead. Pratt, full forward, was putting
up some wonderful marking, and mostly
kicking goals afterwards. When the Tigers
had knocked only 10 points off the lead by
lemon-time South barrackers felt quite
merry. But the pace had been too fast or
the training insufficient, for the Tigers ran
all over the opposition in the last term, add-
ing seven goals to South’s four and snatch-
ing victory in the last minutes by five points
—Richmond, 108; South. 103. Carlton oval
saw another strenuous effort to interest the
28.000 barrackers, Carlton being hard put
to it to hold Footscray in check, and
finding itself five points _ behind at the
long interval. On resuming it definitely
got on top with a sequence of four goals, and
stayed there, despite ’Scray’s sustained
efforts. Latter’s short-passing methods,*
effective if accurate, were somewhat over-
done and contrasted poorly with the results
of the Blues’ long, driving kicks. Vallence,
for Carlton, booted nine goals, while ’Scray’s
new forward, ex-Tasmanian Rait, scored ten.
He is a great high-marker and good kick, but
bis ground play can be bettered. Carlton, 139 ;
Footscray. 116. Fitzroy visited Hawthorn
and found the usual difficulty in beating the
Mayblooms, though it finally managed it by
79 to 68. Hawthorn badly needs a good
forward; also its coach should stress the
fact that though it is good to lead during the
first three quarters it is the last that counts
in the scoring book. Collingwood outed St.
Ivilda by 107 to 63; Geelong walloped Essen-
don 117-59; and North Melbourne cantered
awav from Melbourne with 93 to 69.
* * * *
“Copelen”: Allegations of unfairness and
neglect against Melbourne football umpires
may be generally ascribed to club bias; but
the fact remains that umpiring has gone ro
the pack during recent years. Thirty years
ago, the umpires were far and away more
capable than they are to-day. Their deci-
sions were quicker and better and there wan
uniformity in their interpretations of the
rules. Players now have to study the
psychology of the umpire for each match;
Smiffkins gives a free kick to the man with
the ball and Biffkins gives it to the man
holding him. There are no two alike. And
the latter-day umpire’s job is' child’s play
as compared with that of the past. In the
old days there were no boundary umpires to
relieve the central man of throwing in the
ball, and he had to keep a clear brain while
following the game closely during the whole
playing time. It was estimated that he
covered 15 miles every afternoon; yet he
did it, and did it a great deal better than the
man who now turns off three or four miles
at a much slower pace.
The Rugby Union club matches in Sydney
ended with Western Suburbs still unbeaten,
though Randwick went near to victory with
a 6-6 draw against the leaders. Play was
dull for the most part, with Western adopt-
ing spoiling tactics to offset the Randwick
back division. The second half showed
brighter football, and on the day’s play the
scores just about measured the merits of the
teams. Randwick crossed the opposition line
twice, Western scoring with two penalty
kicks by Barnes. As that usually deadly
hooter missed several attempts at goal, and
Wines lost a certain try by falling, Western
had none the best of the luck. Towers, who
scored twice for Randwick, and White, on
the wing, were notable in the Randwick
backs, while Pauling, in the game again
after an absence of some weeks, and Barnes
were the most interesting of the Western
backs. Both sets of forwards finished level.
Palfrey man and McKcon shining for Rand-
wick and Western in the “brilliant” open
work that is now having its epitaph written
in South Africa. Of the other games, Uni.,
with most of its first team back from M.U.,
won from Northern Suburbs 9-6; St. George
defeated Drummoyne 15-13, and the heavy
Manlyites on their own ground towelled
Eastern Suburbs 32-10.
The Wallabies lost their third successive
match in Africa; they went down to vvest
Griqualand at Kimberley by 14-9, the winners
scoring three tries and two goals (9 ne a
penalty) to two tries and a p.g. Save in the
first half the Australian forwards seem to
have been held by the opposition—a story
which has been told in every match to date.
Ignoring the inadvisability of swapping
horses when half-way across a stream, the
visitors tried the South African 3-4-1 pack
for the first time. The game was the tourists
first on a “dirt” ground.
“Yarraville”: How strong the Rugby
Union game has become in Melbourne is
seen in the fact that the Victorian team, on
its return from Sydney, where it gave N.S.W.
two hard battles, winning one of them, only
managed to beat a side selected from the
rest of Victoria by 15 to 14. The travellers
had a week to get over the hard doing in
the Sydney matches, so the game can be
taken as a fair test.
“Old Q.”: Much moaning is going on in
Sydney Rugby Union circles because the
N.S.W. team to visit Queensland must play
four matches in eight days, beginning June
24. That used to be the rule when the
matches were “intercolonial’ and not inter-
state.” A Queensland team in Sydney
would play N.S.W., IS “Juniors,” Bathurst
or Newcastle on their own grounds, and
N.S.W. again from Saturday to Saturday.
N.S.W. tackled a similar job in Queensland,
though they usually played the leading club
instead of “Juniors.” \ Only a back and
forward were carried as spare parts, and you
found your own liniment, bandages, splints,
etc.
The final Rugby League match between
Queensland and N.S.W. at Brisbane, prior
to the selection of the team which is. to tour
Lancashire and Yorkshire, ended in a win
for the home side by 10-8. The tussle was
a keen one, each side scoring two tries, and
Queensland achieving two goals to one.
The 28 men selected for the English tour
read well enough, though the usual heart-
burnings have followed. There are 15 backs
and 13 forwards. 10 only of the team hail-
ing from Queensland. N.S.W. players are:
F. McMillan, A. Ridley, F. Gardner, J. Why,
R. Morris, D. Brown, C. Pearce, E. Norman,
V. Thicknesse, L. Mead, in the backs; and
W. Smith, F. Neumann, F. Laws, F. Doonar
and F. Gilbert, from Queensland. N.S.W.
forwards are: A. Folwell, G. Bishop, R.
Stehr, F. Curran, J. Gibb, F. O’Connor, S.
Pearce, W. Prigg; the Queenslanders being
J. Little, M. Madsen, L. Heidke, H. Denny
and J. Doyle.
Six of the team went to England with
the 1929-30 side, McMillan, Ridley, Laws,
Prigg, Madsen and Bishop. It is the fifth
League team to visit England.
* $ *
“Cash Amateur”: Something new, even in
professional sport, was seen at Inverell
(N.S.W.) lately when a Rugby League team
chosen to meet a visiting side from Queens-
land struck for higher pay. As the match
was imminent, the local League authorities
climbed down and granted the demands.
Truly, when cash comes into the game,
sportsmanship walks off the ground.
“G.P.S.”: The latest recruit to N.S.W.
Rugby League ranks is Jack Beaton, the
St. Joseph’s centre three-quarter. # His
parents have gone into business at Lismore
(N.S.W.) and young Beaton lias left school
and is playing for Lismore League team.
Many considered Beaton unlucky when the
selectors passed him over in choosing the
Australian Union side now touring ’P»ok-
land.
* * * *
The Maoriland Soccer team more than
justified itself against Australia in the second
Test on Sydney Cricket Ground, for, though
the visitors had the score 5-0 against them
at half-time, they had hard luck to miss a
win in the second spell, final scores reading
6-4 against the All Blacks. For the most of
the second spell the losers stormed the oppo-
sition goal with short-passing tactics, and
only the fine goalkeeping of McNabb prevented
a far larger score. In the closing stages
half a dozen goals were missed by the nar-
rowest of margins, the pace telling on the
marksmen. Kay and Kershaw, with Christie
at centre-half, gave a great, exhibition.
(Continued on page 80.)
Racquet and Ball
Australia made its title clear to the final
of the European zone of the Davis Cup fight
by beating Japan in Paris. The opening
singles proved a tough job for both ot the
Australians, young Nunoi giving Crawford
a stiff gallop before he won by three sets to
two. Another five-set go between McGrath
and Satoli saw the boy wear the Japanese
down and win three to two after losing the
second and third sets. Crawford and Quist
won the first doubles set from Satoli and
Nunoi 7-5. Scores in the others ran <-»,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3. England, which beat Czecho-
slovakia, is the other country in thermal.
“Top Spin”: D. Prenn, the German
player who was dropped from the Gei man
Davis Cup team because he is ot Jewish
stock, and whose entry in the French cham-
pionships caused the withdrawal ot his o c
Davis Cup partner Von Gramm, was born
in Russia. He put Germany on the Davis
Cup map in 1929, when she reached th
semi-final of the European zone, being
chiefly responsible for the elimination ot
Britain. Last year he was a leading fac-
tor in running America to a one-match win,
beating Shields and extending \me to foui
sets in the fight for the right, to- challenge
France, Germany having won m the Euro-
pean zone. Prenn is appearing at \\ imbie
don, so Von Cramm will probably he again
an absentee.
“Grab”: Australians who daily curse the
taxgatherer might reflect on the case o
Suzanne Lenglen when playing exhibitioi
tennis in Belgium lately. Some AMI
spectators climbed from the cheap seats i
the dearer ones without paying extra, and
the official who was representing the enter-
tainment tax ghouls insisted that his cu
should be on the basis of the -600 mghei-
priced seats which had not been paid for. As
Suzanne was playing for a share of the gate,
there was naturally the devil to pay, since
if there is one thing she is better at than
tennis it is raking in shekels. A comprom-
ise was eventually arrived at, but writer will
bet that taxation hound’s ears burned toi
a week after.
* * * *
“Bournemouth”: Next year will see a new
method of playing for the Davis Gup. This
month European nations who have no
reached the semi-finals, and others de-
siring to play, must lodge entries for
next year. These will play in a prelimmaiy
contest until four remain m. ine tow
may enter next year, and will be drawn with
any European nations which have won to
the 1933 semi-finals, and with non-European
nations desiring to challenge. This means
that not more than eight European. nations,
together with those overseas desiring to
challenge, will comprise the challenging
nations for the Cup next year. _

TERM INSURANCE
“An Important Aid to Business
Never Before Available
in Australia ”
“An important aid to business,
which has never been available in
Australia until the arrival of a great
English company here a year ago, is
what is generally known as ‘term’
insurance.
“The absence of this facility has
made it necessary for Australian
business men in order ... to meet
some contingency to buy a whole-
life policy, which they throw in
when the contingency for which pro-
tection was required has lapsed, tak-
ing what surrender value (if any)
might be attaching to such a policy
at the date of surrender.
“A ‘term’ insurance is a life policy
covering the eventuality of death
within a limited period, which may
be months or years. . . .
“Take the case of a firm. ... It may
desire to cover the life of a valued
office employee or a traveller in his
interest or that of the firm itself. . . .
By ‘term’ insurance both these
requirements can be covered at a
very moderate cost.”
(Extract from “Current Problems,” March 31, 1933.)

to is The Prudential. For further particulars regarding “Term
Insurance,” inquire from

Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: The Yankees claim to have
originated the crouch start for pedestrians,
which one Hughes says was invented by
G. H. Sherrill, of Yale, who hit on the idea
by accident in 1888. Australians were using
the crouch before that. One of the pioneers
was abo. Bob MacDonald, who was running
in the Botany (N.S.W.) professional sports
in 1885, and is still remembered by the old
hands. Bob always said he got the notion
from watching a feeding kangaroo hop off
from his crouching position with forepaws
on the ground.
* * * *
“Blue Chalk”: England seems to be the
spiritual home of the Lindrums. Fred Lin-
drum was the first to burst on the billiard
world there, and was followed by the all-
conquering brother Walter. Now young
nephew Horace, who is at present engaging
Melbourne Inman in Australia, is to go. He
will be under Inman’s wing, and a series of
matches in England and on the Continent
lias been arranged. Horace should shake
the best of them up, especially at snooker
and pyramids, in which mysteries his ability
is uncanny.
* * =1! 4
“Shrewsbury”: The Australian Universi-
ties Sports Association has resolved to cut
out the presentation of “blues” to athletes
figuring in representative teams. The origi-
nal scheme embraced all sorts of sports,
including professional ones, and the confu-
sion was terrifying. It is to be maintained
in another way, however, by granting a
badge to be worn on other blazers, so the
last end of the idea seems to be worse than
the first. The sane course is to follow the
example of Oxford and Cambridge and grant
blues only for a few fixed sports, such as
cricket, amateur football, rowing, athletics,
and one or two others, with “half blues”
for the less important forms.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Dr. Harold Irving, who heard
the finishing gun in Melbourne for the last
time the other day, was a notable figure in
Victorian rowing, following in the footsteps
of his father, the late Professor Martin
Irving, once headmaster of Wesley and the
founder of amateur rowing in the Cabbage
Garden, The doctor rowed six years for
Melbourne Uni. in the inter-’Varsity race,
and filled the No. 5 and No. 7 seats in the
Victorian crews of 1896-97 which won the
inter-State championship.
“Hippie”: Sydney Uni.’s success in the
Oxford-C'ambridge Cup eights leaves the Ma
State with all inter-State championships fur-
rowing and sculling—the King’s Cup, the
amateur sculling title and now the Uuiver-
sities’ supremacy. Of the 42 races for the
title, Sydney has won 16, Melbourne 15,
Adelaide and Westralia four each, Queens-
land two and Tasmania one. It must be
noted, though, that Adelaide did not come in
until 1891, Queensland in 1920, Tassie in
1924 and Westralia in 1927. Victoria and
Ma have been at it since 1870, or, reckon-
ing the eights only, since 1888.
# * * *
“Shell”: How hard the times are is seen
in the cabled report that Ted Phelps, world’s
professional sculling champion, having found
it impossible to make a living at the game,
or, indeed, get any matches at all, has been
compelled to take a job of work as master
of a Thames pleasure steamer. By the
irony of fate the route of his craft from
Westminster to Kew and back takes in the
championship course on which so many of
his predecessors, including not a few Aus-
tralians, sculled to fame and affluence.
“Kennington”: Jack Hobbs is running
“W.G.” close for t'he title of Ancient Phe-
nomenon. Playing for Surrey against the
West Indies the other day, John ran up
221, and so put his side 10 runs ahead of
the 460 set up by the tourists. The Surrey
professional is 51 in December, and the
West Indian bowling is quite first-class, the
fast stuff, which an elderly gentleman might
be expected to jib at, having been very suc-
cessful on the tour so far.
❖ v
“Jolimont”: Victoria’s cricket governors
reported a profitable season, thanks largely
to the visit of the English team, which
swelled receipts to over £25,000. The dis-
trict clubs were handed £2OO each, and after
£5OO had been given to charity and various
expenses met there was 'a cash credit of a little
under £2OOO. The Tests and State matches
with England yielded a profit of £7OOO.
* * * *
“Soop Her Up” : To Victoria must go the
credit of first introducing “the roaring
game,” otherwise curling, to Australia. The
Victorian Curling Club was officially opened
at Melbourne Glaciarinm recently by
Norman Brookes, though how a tennis
player, and one with an English name at
that, came to identify himself with a pur-
suit more Scottish than golf had the many
Scots who were present thinking. Captain
Moffat-Pender, president of the club, men-
tioned that Canada was the only Dominion
wherein curling was regularly practised. As
much of Canada is more Scottish than Scot-
land. or even than Otago, this is not to be
wondered at. It is expected that curling
rinks will shortly be established at some of
the Victorian winter resorts, and this is an
idea that might be followed at Kosciusko.

Footbrawl
“Hotham”: They take their football as
a necessity of life in Melbourne. The Essen-
don Council was approached recently with
a request that free admission to the football
matches on the ground under its control be
granted to dependants of the unemployed.
A lot of the aldermen favored the proposal,
though the mayor said that one man who
had applied for the right admitted he had 16
children. It was decided that, as all unem
ployed were admitted free already on presen-
tation of their sustenance cards, that was as
far as the council cared to go.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian Football
League, which is well fixed financially, is
none the less regarding with dismay the con-
siderable falling off in attendances at the
matches this season. There is a move among
some of the less prosperous clubs to have
the wages of the players reduced. One St.
Kilda delegate told a meeting the other day
that it cost his club £9O to put a team on
the field each week. He advocated paying
players a retainer all the year round in pre-
ference to the present system of £3 a week
per man during the playing season, with vari-
ous “trimmings.” The other point of view
was voiced by a speaker who called it scan-
dalous that “men should have to play League
football for less than £3 a week” —and foot-
ball i,s supposed to be a sport.
* * * *
The Wallabies sustained their second loss
of the tour ; against the strong Northern
Transvaal side at Pretoria, being beaten
13-S after losing Malcolm and Hodgson,
the latter the best performer in the forwards
to date, before half-time. Though the NT.
skipper generously offered replacements, our
men stood by the international rules and
played the game out with 13 men. A cable
from manager Mathews states the side is
already most popular and living up to the
traditions of the Waratalis in Britain. Of
tne first four notches played Australia won
two and lost two, with 48 points scored to 32.
“Canny Lad” : The exclusion of the Rugby
Union from Sydney Cricket Ground by the
trustees (B. 10/5/’33) was not an unmixed
evil. The two matches between N.S.W. and
Victoria in Sydney yielded a profit of £l5O,
whereas the home Union had budgeted for a
loss of £l5O. Both games were played on
suburban grounds, North Sydney and Manly
ovals. At both the attendance overflowed to
such an extent that over 2000 had to be
accommodated on the grass inside the pickets
At the Cricket Ground, on tlie other hand, the
two League matches between N.S.W. and
Queensland drew the poorest crowds seen
at these games for a long time, although they
were trials for the selection of the team
starting for England in July.
* * * *
“Gate”: The Australian Rugby League
authorities are taking no chances with those
“civilians” granted permission to visit Eng-
land with their team. Visitors have to con-
tract to put themselves under the orders of
the managers and deposit £250 with the
League, in addition to their return fares,
before starting. No coach will be sent, and
that job will probably be relegated to joint
manager Sunderland, who has something of
a reputation in that line. The matter of
playing exhibition matches in the South of
England and in Paris is to be left to the
touring managers.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Susie Swattit”: Of course, I am not one
to impute nasty motives to anyone, but I
do think some of these Melbourne news-
papers might be a bit more careful. The
“Arge”-—or was it the “Agus”?—printed
a long paragraph headed “Women’s Golf” m
fat black letters. Underneath was another
paragraph headed in type as fat and black
“Australian Cat Club.” Some people are
so sensitive, you know!
:J: * * * '
“Divot Digger”: Having first consulted the
taxation authorities, the controllers of the
N.S.W. golf championships have decided to
charge admission to the matches beginning
this week. Admission to the Australian
Club’s links at Kensington will be by ticket
only, the charge being 2s. 6d. for men and
one and a tanner for the girls. This is the
first trial of anything of the sort in Sydney
championship matches, and. the plunder, if
any, will go to helping the game in the
State. In the past, when the tourney was
a free-for-all go, attendances have run up
to five or six thousand. It will be interest-
ing to see if the charge—which admits to
the whole series of matches, including the
final on June 24 —will make any difference
in the roll-up.
* * * *
“Penalty”: A couple of curious golf hap-
penings have been reported in N.S.W. lately.
At Armidale, an associate, playing a ball out
of a bad lie, saw it drop down the opening
of her blouse. After argument, the ball was
deemed to be unplayable under law 22, and
another ball was dropped, this costing an-
other stroke in addition to that played.
In Sydney, a played ball disappeared. Here
again a new ball was taken, but when tlie
player put down his bag on the green the
lost ball trickled out of it. It was explained
that he had dropped his bag in the rough
while searching for his ball there, so the pill
must have malevolently crawled into it.
* :!: $ *
“Lakeside”: The American open golf
championship has this year been won by an
amateur, one John Goodman, with a total
card of 287 for the 72 holes, or a trifle
under four per hole. As Goodman did one
72 par round in 66, he must be hot stuff.
Gene Sarazen, holder of the title, is not
mentioned in the cables, so was probably
not a starter. Our old friends Walter
Hagen and Joe Kirkwood were third and
seventh respectively, Hagen tying T. D.
Armour with 292, while Kirkwood was
bracketed with an unnamed player with a
296 score. Bobby Jones was the last ama-
teur holder of the title. The first was J.
D. Travers, winner in 1915.
a: a: * *
“Cleek”: There will be no need for the
League of Nations to intervene in the
N.S.W.-Victoria golf dispute (B. 14/6/’33).
The Ma Staters have agreed to the Yarra-
villers holding the Australian championships
next year during their centenary spree, pro-
vided they give up the meeting which was to
be held on their ground this year to Syd-
ney. The arrangement seems a fair one,
for otherwise it would mean that Melbourne
would have two championship meetings run-
ning while Ma would have to wait wearily
through the years until her turn came round
again on the roster.
* * * *
“Kenso”: It is not only the reptile con-
temporaries which are casting doubts on the
fitness of the new Australian Golf Club’s
course layout for championship matches (B.
31/5/’33). Some of the ungrateful members
are putting in the serpent’s tooth, so to speak.
The annual meeting saw quite a decent barge
over some of the new holes, 5 and there was
strong support for a motion that they be
altered. The opposition to this was equally
vehement, and at last an amendment post-
poning the matter and leaving it to the con-
sideration of the committee was passed on
the chairman’s ruling. That avoided blood-
shed, but not some hearty criticism of the
chairman’s decision that he was entitled to
use proxies held by him in reckoning the
vote on the. amendment. However, a subse-
quent extraordinary general meeting decided
on restoring the old layout, so 1 all’s well.
Racquet and Bawl
The Australian Davis Cuppers won
through their match with South Africa,
though it was nothing to write home about
In the opening singles Crawford had an
easy run with the left-hander Kirby, whom
he beat in straight sets. McGrath had a
harder, time with Robbins, the Afrikander
champion, but won in three of four hard
sets. The doubles match was lost, as was
expected, the new combination of Crawford
and McGrath being at sea against the Spring-
bok pair, who last season defeated the Eng-
lish champions, Perry and Hughes, every
time they met in South Africa. Crawford
clinched the match with an easy win from
Robbins, blit Kirby proved too tough for
McGrath, winning by three sets to one.

“Centre Court”: If Jack Crawford can
maintain the form he showed in the French
championships and against South Africa, the
trophy for the singles at Wimbledon, play
in which begins on June 26, should come to
Australia. It is about time, for, since Gerald
Patterson won in 1919, when he beat the
holder, fellow-Victorian Brookes, it has been
out of our keeping except for one year. The
late Tony Wilding first brought the title south
of the line in 1910 and kept it until Brookes
won in 1914. Tilden followed Patterson for
a couple of years, Gerald regaining the honor
in 1922, to be replaced next year by Ameri-
can Bill Johnson. Borotra won for France
in 1924, and France held it with Cochet,
Borotra and Lacoste until Tilden upset the
applecart in 1930. Ellsworth Y r ines defends
the , recognised world’s championship this
year.
* * *
“Ivooyong”: Victoria’s determination to
gather in every possible sporting function
for the centenary celebrations is unchanged.
The latest move was an approach to South
Australia asking that it forego its right to
hold the Australian tennis championships tor
1935 in favor of Vic. The Cabbage Gardeners
offered to give up their rights for 1936, and
the Wheatfielders have graciously agreed,
so it is to be.
“Kev. Knucklebone”: The N.S.W. tennis
heads have taken characteristic objection
to the action of the Australian controlling
body in granting the Canberra association
complete control of the game in the Federal
Territory. The reason for the squeal is that
Canberra has only about seven clubs, and
that it would not be fair to give it the rank
of a separate State like Ma with equal repre-
sentation on the Australian Council. Size
goes for nothing in such cases. The Repub-
lic of Andorra numbers about as many
inhabitants as Canberra has tennis players,
but it headed the alphabetical list of the
Allies against the Central Powers in the
Great War.
Car and Cycle
“Differential”: There have been several
attempts since the war to put an Australian-
made car on the market. The Southern
Cross, officially christened the other day by
Ivingsford Smith’s wife, “Smithy” being a
director of the Marks Motor Co. which is
constructing the car, looks like being the
hoped-for success. The special feature of the
new car is that steel has been displaced in
the chassis construction by laminated wood,
such as is now used for aeroplane-wing
spars and propellers. The engine, made in
Sydney, is a four-cylinder opposed job
developing 55 b.h.p. The five-passenger
tourer weighs under a ton, has a maximum
speed of 70 m.p.h. and a petrol consumption
of from 39 to 35 miles to the gallon. The
gear-box has three speeds forward and a
super overdrive for high-speed work. Wheel-
base is 130 fin. and the price £240. The
first model was built in 1921, and experi-
ments have continued ever since, one model
still operating having travelled over
200,000 miles.
“Throttle”: Australian motorists looking
for speed records are handicapped by the
absence of suitable tracks such as Europe
enjoys in plenty. W. B. Thompson’s recent
Australian hour record on Maroubra
(N.S.W.) track (B. 14/6/’33) would have
been a lot more than 78 miles an hour on
an up-to-date circuit, as is shown by the fact
that in one lap he topped 85 m.p.h. G.
Eyston holds the world’s figures for the hour
with 130.7 m.p.h., but the Englishman w r as
driving on Montlhery.
“Hydro”: Malcolm Campbell, not satis-
fied with risking his neck on land, is think-
ing of chancing drowning, for he is talking
of entering for the next race for the Harms-
worth speedboat trophy held at present by
the American Gar Wood. Much depends on
whether Lord Wakefield, who financed the
previous British entries by Segrave and
Kaye Don, will come at it again, for he
announced some time ago that he was “reet
stalled.” as they say in Lancashire, with
the whole business.

“Huoh” : Thomas Hallam, whose death in
Hobart, at 67, is reported, was one of the
leading riders of his day when 'Jie high
“penny-farthing” puslibikes were the last
word in cycling. Forty years ago he held
all the Tassie records on track and road,
one of the best being his ride from Laun-
ceston to Hobart in 9hr. 9min. To-day’s
figures by Hubert Opperman are shr. 59min.
for the 120 miles. Hallam rode successfully
on the mainland as well, and as a sideline
cultivated long-distance running, a rare thing
for a bike-pushing champion.
Miscellaneous
“Blade” : Even when he takes to rowing
the policeman’s life is not a happy one.
When Sydney police recently formed a row-
ing club there was general approval, but
the catch came the first time the stout lads
tried to get into a racing shell. It was
found that their only chance of occupying
the seats was to stand on their heads on
them, which, while good for publicity, was
little use for rowing. However, they
approached the N.S.W. rowing authorities
for permission to have their boats built to
bigger dimensions and this has graciously
been granted. Warned by the experience,
the J. Hops took no risks when choosing a
pontoon for their rowing shed. They acquired
the old Milson’s Point ferry float, which is
calculated to support a herd of elephants.
* !]: * *
“Long Dog”: The Victorian coursing
Derby provided another triumph for the A.
H. Carter kennels, which first won their
way to fame at the tail of the famous Ter-
minus, winner of classics and cups innumer-
able. The event was held at Benalla, and
the 20-montlis-old dog Milanor, by Monarch
from Monica, won easily for the Parramatta
stable. Milanor is a stoutly-built brindle
weighing 761 b. and has great pace, whilst
he comes round on the hare well. Good
judges account him the best puppy to win
a Derby for a long time and compare him
with Father’s Footsteps. He was bred by
P. Murphy, of Blayney (N.S.W.), and leased
to his present owner recently.,
i\t * * *
“Eilliab”: The wind gauge will not be
altered so often on the short rifles which
members of rifle clubs throughout Austra-
lia will be obliged to use after June 30. The
new Mark VII. ammunition, which will
come into use simultaneously, has a 7i
grains stronger charge, with a muzzle velocity
of 2400 feet a second, compared with that
of the Mark VI., the speed of which was
1900 feet. This means a difference of eight
verniers (4ft.) at 600 yards range, so less
windage will be required. The Small Arms
Factory at Lithgow (N.S.W.) Iras just com-
pleted the' job of lopping sin. off hundreds
of the long-barrel type of weapon.

Astrologer
Causes Sensation
Forms Syndicates in
N.S.JV. State Consultation and Wins
Thousands of Pounds for Her Clients
“ Science, the science of Astrology, should he able to ta\e the place of luck,
in buying winning tic\ets in the N.S.W. State Consultation,” said Madame
Zella when she was appointed to direct the purchase of Lottery tickets for
the Syndicates conducted to aid the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Read
the report of this astrologer s success, given below, and judge for yourself
whether there is anything in this unusual idea .
Wins Include £5OOO
and scores of &100, £ 4O , SL3O, §L2O, SLIO and 5.5
Prizes-totalling thousands
weeks ago Madame Zella, an
astrologer of world-wide experience, was
appointed to direct the purchase of tickets
in the N.S.W. State Consultation for the
“Science of the Stars” Syndicates. These
syndicates are formed to aid the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital Auxiliary and, since
Madame Zella’s first syndicate was formed,
thousands and thousands of pounds have
been won for her clients. Although it is
only a matter of comparatively few Con-
sultations since Madame Zella commenced
operations, her wins have already assumed
astounding proportions.
The first “Science of the Stars” Syndi-
cate was formed for the 112th drawing of
the N.S.W. State Consultation. Success was
immediate. In that drawing many ,of her
clients won cash, but these early successes
were as nothing compared with what soon
followed.
Read what Mr. W. H., of Woonona,
says in his letter to IVfadame Zella:—
“Dear Madame Zella, —For your informa-
tion: One of the syndicate of three who
icon the first prize of £5OOO in the 114th
State Consultation states that it was due
to the Horoscope supplied by you that a
ticket was sent for... .you told him that
his lucky day was Wednesday and his lucky
color was yellow, and the ticket was re-
ceived on Wednesday and the color yellow.”
Ist Prize of £5OOO
Then came the 116th State Consultation.
In that drawing Madame Zella won the
first prize of £5OOO for seven members of
her Syndicates. Since then this clever
astrologer has gone from success to success.
In every drawing it is the same. She never
misses, and her wins include dozens and
dozens of prizes of £5, £lO, £2O, £3O. £4O and
£lOO.
These wins in the State Consultation are
only part of the good fortune which many
people have obtained by their association
with Madame Zella. For instance, in the
“Sunbeams” Consultation, drawn recently,
one of her clients won the first prize, valued
at £lOOO. while the second prize, valued at
£75, was also won by one of her clients.
You Can Share
Bulletin readers who are interested in
astrology and who would like to obtain
Madame Zella’s help in winning their share
of prizes in the N.S.W. State Consultation,
may do so by cutting out this article as
explained below. Here are the details of
Madame Zella’s offer.
If she is nothing else, Madame Zella is.
thorough. Take, for instance, the,fact that
she allows only seven people—no more,
no less—in each one of her “Science of the
Stars” Syndicates. This may seem a detail
to those unfamiliar with her methods, but
when you realise that mystics of all ages
have attached great significance to the
influence of the number “7” in human
affairs, the reason for Madame Zella’s plan
is apparent. So it means that with seven
| members in every “Science of the Stars”
Syndicate, each member of the winning
syndicate receives £715 in hard cash every
time Madame Zella wins the first prize of
£5OOO. Similarly, members of Syndicates
winning smaller prizes receive a one-seventh
j share of the value of that particular prize.
Additional
Prize-winning Chances
In addition to offering a one-seventh
share in a N.S.W. State Consultation ticket,
Madame Zella will also send you two
tickets in the “Lucky Stars” Consultation
now being conducted for the Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital, in which the first prize
is valued at £lOOO. Thus everyone
writing to Madame Zella, as explained
below, will receive tickets that may win
as much as £1715 in hard cash for them.
And that’s not all.
Horoscopes, Too
Madame Zella will also send you your
Horoscope. By knowing the exact date
of your birth (day, month and year) she
will calculate the position the stars occupied
at that time and will thus be able to
tell you many things concerning your life
about which even you are in ignorance at
present. She will tell you what your lucky
days are and which-is your lucky color;
what latent talents you possess; your
weaknesses; and many other details of your
life and character just as important to yoju.
In this horoscope you-may find guidance
which may change the whole course of your
life and help you to realise your greatest
ambitions.
WHO WILL SHARE
Madame Zella’s
NEXT BIG WIN?
One of the outstanding features of
Madame 'Zella’s win of £5OOO in the 116th
drawing, of the N.S.W. State Consultation
was the fact that in the Sydney “Sunday
Sun” of the previous Sunday Madame Zella

loger. forms .the “Science of the
Stars” Syndicates which are so success-
ful in the N.S.W. State Consultation.
announced that she quite expected to win
the first prize before very long. There is,
therefore, special significance in what
Madame Zella said when interviewed a few
days ago. In discussing the application of
astrology to various phases of everyday life,
she said that this science definitely indicates
that certain periods are more lucky than
1 others, and that she is confident that the
' near future holds distinct possibilities of
J exceptionally good fortune for her clients.
; Who will share this next big win of which
Madame Zella is so confident? Why not
give yourself the chance to be among her
lucky clients? All you have to do is cut
out this article, as explained below, and
Madame Zella will do the rest.
The Horoscopes
Thousands of years ago the ancient Chal-
deans discovered that Planets and other
Heavenly Bodies have a definite influence
in our lives. Madame Zella, famous modern
exponent of this ancient science, can tell
you many things about vour life which are
hidden from you at present, simply by
knowing the exact date of your birth (day.
month and year). From this she can
calculate the position the Heavenly Bodies
i occupied at the time of your birth and thus
give you surprising information about your
life. In the Horoscope she sends you she
will tell you what your lucky days are. and
which is your lucky color; what latent
talents you possess; your weaknesses and
many other details of your life and character
just as important to you. This Horoscope
will be like a magic mirror to you—in it
you will see reflected .your real self and
the real possibilities that lie in your future.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Tlie Girl in the Flat Opposite says there
is nothing for it but to call the C.J.’s lady
the “Street of farewell” since the welter of
cheerios that have been raging in her honor.
The Halse Rogers cocktail party was one
of the outsize ones of the week, and the
wives of many Judges and Iv.C.’s set out
the savory of remembrance. Of afternoon
parties that of the Queen’s Club members
was particularly impressive. The Street
dame is that Conservative stronghold’s presi-
dent, and the members, very smooth of plum-
age, surged into the three reception-rooms
on Wednesday afternoon. Even if you
weren’t invited you could tell there was
something grand going on by the handsome
cars that swept up to the club’s rather drab
portals. The flower decorations, were in the
prize class: great roses languished; poin-
settia, berry and pomegranate, flushed with
the wine of autumn, were a background of
color for cloth suit and fur. The entire com-
mittee was drawn up to receive the guest,
and short of the National Anthem her entry
was vice-regal.
Too long and too often has music been
divorced from Sydney’s social life. That bril-
liant pianist Mrs. Walter Swinson has issued
a mandate on the subject, and by sheer weight
of personality has gathered among her dis-
ciples the music-ldvers of the city. Already
seven hostesses are planning parties where
friends and melody will be linked by ■ silver
note and impressive chord. The first of the
series was held at Ginaghulla, the Bellevue
Hill home of Miss Fairfax, last Friday
night; and what a setting for violin and
’cello and Stanley Clarkson’s voice was that
long old music-room, with' its high-vaulted
roof, its mirror-reflected candles, its soft
pink radiance!
The chairs had been arranged as in a con-
cert-room, and there were rows and rows
of beautifully-dressed women, of whom the
two young Fairfax matrons, Mrs. Warwick
and Mrs. John, chose white; the hostess,
Miss Fairfax (Ginaghulla is the original Fair-
fax home), was in softly-flowing black, while
Mrs. Swinson aired the most joyous frock in
the room. It was as uplifting to the heart as
a day in mid-spring. It seemed, looking round,
that all the Judges were there, and no one
listened with more rapt an ear than the
C.J., although Mungo MacCallum’s lady ran
him a close second.
Mrs. Dettmann, who had been to five
parties that day, must have felt the notes of
the opening Bach aria as cooling to the
spirit as some celestial fountain. The Wil-
fred Fairfaxes, the David Maughans, the
padre Micklem couple and the musicianly
Muriel Fletcher were among those avlio
applauded Gerald Walenn, Athos Martelli
and Stanley Clarkson, and the sympathetic
and brilliant accompaniments of George
Taylor.
The Loan Exhibition of Antiques opened
by Lady Isaacs last night holds a wealth of
beauty mellowed by age. Among treasures
that made collectors’ eyes spark with
envy are a tablecloth -off which George 11.
dined, a letter written by the Duke of Well-
ington, and a chair said to have been used
by Nelson on the Victory.
That the world is a very small place after
all was again shown at the Independents’
party in honor of Athene Seyler and
Nicholas Hannen. One of the members, on
being introduced to the actor, laughed and
said: “I feel as though I already know you.
Your father married me years ago iu Shang-
hai.” Athene Seyler, sinuous and long of
limb, wore cinnamon-hued marocain and
clasped a presentation posy of crimson roses.
Doris Fitton wore sapphire blues. The club-
room was brimful of eager young Bern-
hardts and Irvings, and Maureen O’Moor
looked Puckish under a tiny plate of a hat.
When the Croydon Ladies’ Social Club
gets up a ball it is done in fine style. Last
week the ladies (there are only sixty of them
at a time, and each must, be the wife, mother,
sister or daughter of a Mason) arranged a
dance to aid the Far West Children’s health
scheme. The Ashfield Town Hall was the
scene of spirited action, with heralds in blue
velvet announcing the debs., who stepped
along red carpet to the presence, very
slowly and impressively, each eight paces
behind the other. Immediately preceding the
procession were a white-satined page and a
tiny girl in a crinoline. Presently when the
debs, with their partners circled the floor in
a dance that resembled a tango-waltz, these
two youngsters solemnly went through the
same gyrations. The Governor and his lady
went to Ashfield to view the pageantry sup-
ported by aide Gifford. The wife of Premier
Stevens, the padre Stanley Drummond
couple and Ashfield’s mayor and mayoress
were other notables. The president of the
ball was Mrs. J. Scherrenberg. Mrs. Gerald
Grahame and Mrs. Alec Williamson, Mrs.
Sydney Campbell and Mrs. H. Gordon were
strong units of the committee.
Gostwyck, the new Dangar home, built on
the site of the original homestead, is to
have a visitors’ book. This is in a Wal.
Taylor binding of softest brown with the
Dangar coat of arms emblazoned on the
front. On an ivory shield picked out in
black (rather like ermine) arise a ram’s
head and two knights’ helmets in gold and
silver. The whole is surmounted by a half-
knight with' a short sword in his hand.
Underneath runs the motto Traditus non
victus. Gostwyck, surrounded by its swell-
ing acres, its poplars golden in the autumn,
and traversed by a gentle stream, is one of
the showplaces of the State. Here Mrs.
Gordon and her daughters live in county-
family style. There is a chapel for the
family and the workers on the estate, about
100 all told; and here the Reverend Hugh
Gordon leads his little flock in prayer. Nor
are amusements overlooked; the latest addi-
tion is a hall for the entertainment of the
staff.
Harald Bowden, who has been represent-
ing the J.C.W. firm in New York, arrived
back last week with Mrs. Bowden and
daughter Joyce. Harald (that’s the old
Norse way of spelling it), who was reared
by the waters of Drummoyne, is quite a
good baritone singer, and in his early youth
belonged to St. Andrew’s Boys’ Choir; his
good work with the Glebe and Petersham
musical societies is also remembered.
Carinthia, Pott’s Point, will be the family’s
first place of rest in Sydney.
Somebody on the Stock Exchange has
imagination. For the Contango Club Dance
the admission ticket was a replica of a
sharebroker’s contract note. The party was
in the Blaxland Galleries, and during the
evening a flight of telegraph messengers
descended on the room with urgent tele-
grams which read “acting on your advice,
we have this night sold all your gloom and
depression and reinvested proceeds in fun
and frolic.” Then entered the Bull and the
Bear, and after a skirmish, of which the
Bull got the better, that animal genially dis-
solved and turned out to be a graceful pair
of Adagio dancers.
The Catholic Ball drew 600 dancers to
Mark Foy’s ballroom last week. The debs,
alone numbered 42 and one by one the
white-clad girls, their arms and shoulders, a
sou Hie of tulle, bobbed and kissed the epis-
copal ring. When this ceremony was over,
Archbishop Kelly watched the youngsters
step through their special dance. The Arch-
bishop and his little court were met on arri-
val by president E. J. Doran and members
of the dance committee.
The Repat. Department lost a great nurse
when Sister L. Abell retired last week after
12 years’ service at the Lady Davidson Home
at Turramurra. Sister Abell is another of
our splendid Royal Red Crossers, and was
decorated by the King for her work in mili-
tary hospitals at Talenee and at Boulogne,
at 'casualty-clearing stations in the danger
zones and on hospital barges on the canals,
where she was frequently under fire.
Knight Mark Sheldon and his lady, who
are at present staying at the Australia, tell
of son Thomas’s wedding the other day.
Thomas is the elder son, and he married
last week in London Elizabeth Ovey, second
daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel R. L. Ovey,
of Henley-on-Thames. The fashionable St.
James’s in Spanish-place was the scene of
the ring-giving; and Father de Trafford, the
principal of Downside (the bridegroom’s old
school), had the assistance of Father Rawlin-
son in blessing the vows.
This pretty creature is Helena Fisher, one
of the pictorial features of the Philip Har-
grave audi-
ences. Helena
is a niece of
Miss Garnaut,

teacher.
Helena is her-
self a musician
of note 'and un-
der her aunt’s
guidance she

scholarship for
three years.

then she will get the finest polish Leip-
zig has to offer her on her violin notes.
The violin is one of tlie two or three
genuine Strads. in Australia; it was bought
for the musician by her father from Hill’s
in London, and is complete with pedigree
and guarantee. Sixteen-ninety-something is
the date inscribed on, it ; that it is without
scratch or blemish is owing to the fact that
it had been the possession of a Polish noble-
man’s family, having for 200 years shared
a glass case with a second Strad. ow.ned by
the same people. Photo by The Bulletin
photographer.
Cobbity’s polo week ended in the usual
way—everybody concerned got together and
danced. The Agricultural Hall at Camden
was impartial and gaily flaunted the colors
of all the competing teams. Playing his bag-
pipes, Bob Mackay aired the Mackay tartan,
and his was the most pictorial performance
of an evening that went gay on jazz and
musical chairs.
Sydney of a decade or so ago made rather
a hero of Snowy Baker. Hollywood of to-day
does likewise. Hector Macquarrie, going
across the world in liis Baby Austin, fell in
with Snowy at the Riviera Country Club in
Hollywood, of which the Australian is man-
ager. This is Hector’s description of his
appearance on the first meeting:—
His riding boots were of the best quality and
they fitted comfortably and perfectly; his white
cord riding-breeches were well cut. The simple blue
jersey, his polo colors, was there to control a fine
manly chest. His face was burnt copper and glow-
ing with health, his eyes were true blue, his hair,
almost white (a very light buff shade), was strong
and parted to one side.
Snowy is one of California’s noted polo
players; he has a score of polo ponies and
a dozen hacks which he hires out. He gives
riding lessons, and a ten-minute talk every
week over the “Los Angeles Times’’ radio,
and for this he will take no fee. His polo,
swimming and boxing, according to Hector,
are in the first rank.
Roy Maling is probably Sydney’s first
ballet composer. His “Roksanda” was pro-
duced on Saturday night before a Conser-
vator]'um audience, in which musicians were
thick as leaves and artists occasionally
occurred. Alfred Hill, Howard Carr, W.
Thorman, Haagen Holenberg, Don Finley,
Roland Wakelin and Lute Drummond fol-
lowed every beat of Roy’s music, every curve
and rhythm of Louise Lightfoot’s chore-
graphy. Both dancing and music were de-
scribed in the programme as ultra-modern,
but the story was on hoary lines, concern-
ing an aged king who wanted to marry the
beauteous daughter of a neighboring monarch
but was faced with three arduous tests be-
fore he could claim his bride. A strong
and comely shepherd (who later turned out
to be of royal blood) performs the deeds of
derring-do, and in the end wins the prize.
The dancing in this and the remainder of
the programme, of which “Walpurgis Night”
was the principal number, was by pupils of
the Lightfoot-Burlakov school, and vivid and
light as thistledown.

tive-1 ookin g

The ball at the Palais on Monday night
was the cocktail to Polo Week. The enthusi-
asts of the game rallied in great force, and
there was much applause when the tableaux,
enacted mostly by fair polo barrackers, were
posed within a golden frame. All the old
belles of renown lived again; even Helen of
Troy came to light, Ruth Allen getting a
loud hand as the expensive beauty who was
probably the cause of much subsequent taxa-
tion to both Trojan and Greek. Gretel Bull-
more’s costume, as the Du Barry, had already
received a good airing in the show windows
of one of the big city stores; however, its
tender blues and pinks and the small blue
hat with its cascade of pink plumes took on
fresh grace in the Palais perspective. Fair
Mrs. Oscar Paul made a darling Nell Gwynn;
Katherine Garvan disseminated an air of
old Pekin as a Chinese lady of fashion, and
Dinah Hordern’s Dorothy Vernon of Haddon
Hall brought a sense of open air and old-
world freshness into the scene.
Scoutmasters in uniform and friends of
the Boy Scout made merry in the Blaxland
Galleries midway through last, week, and
Miss Charles Fairfax again, though sue
might not be aware of it, was Queen of
the revels. This lady has been the fairy god-
mother to B.P.’s followers in Sydney, and
Scouts revere lier name. To the ball she
wore cornflower-blue flat crepe, which toned
in admirably with the cerulean blues of her
hostess, Mrs. R. C. Dixso.n, who was presi-
dent of the ball committee. Both wore their
gold swastikas, the “gratitude” badge of the
association. The success of the night had a
particular interest for the Dixson couple, as
he is president of the Pennant Hills camp,
which shares the profits with the Scouts’
Club and the association. The Mayoral
Hagons were in this group, and the Kelso
Kings spread the aura of their quiet friend-
liness. Colonel J. M. Maughan, the State’s
Chief Commissioner, came with Miss Maug-
han ; treasurers of the association W. G.
Layton and G. Thompson (whose wife added
another blue frock to the group) were among
those who helped to swell the chorus of song
that circled the room when the campfire was
lighted. Gayest of all was the contingent
that will leave by the Otranto on Saturday
for the jamboree to be held in Hungary next
August.
An outstanding party to farewell the Chief
Justice and his lady, who are off for a jaunt
in Europe as a sort of holiday celebration
of his retirement, was that given by Gram-
mar’s head, H. S- Dettmann, and his wife.
This was held in the Queen’s Club and filled
the reception rooms with Law and Justice
(there’s a difference) and their wives. You
felt there was a splendid theatrical pro-
ducer lost in Mrs. Dettmann when you
looked round and saw that she had almost
every man rumored as in the running for the
C.J.’s shoes on her stage. The fact added
quite a sibilant hiss to the babel of sound.
Attorney-General Manning, tall and erect,
overtopped most of the other men of law,
and near him stood E. M. Mitchell.
Poinsettia flamed in alcoves and against
the pillars, and on the mantelpiece pome-
granates blushed rosy and green among the
foliage that artistic hands had trained up
above the surmounting mirror.. Mrs. Dett-
mann wore a trained black moire frock and
a fascinating marcel, and daughters Ellis
and Denise were young and radiant, the
first in old rose, the second in peacock-blue
frocking. The son of the house was there,
too, looking like a film hero, and Grammar s
head himself was a perfect .host. The
C.J.’s lady, wrapped up in. a glittering lame
coat as a protection against further cold
and carrying a posy of immense violets,
darted hither and thither like some happy
butterfly; and talking to Judge Langer
Owen’s wife was her sister from Melbourne.
Mrs. Langer Owen, very slim in chalk-
white angel-skin, divided honors with the
wife of padre Micklem for attractiveness.
The latter wore honey-gold raiment banded
in black Arctic fox. Joan Mcllrath was
another pleasure to the eye. She was in
mulberry velvet with the übiquitous up-to-
the-throat shoulder cape, and her dark head
stuffed with law (she took her degrees at
Oxford) wore a terribly sleek cut, while
her ears finished themselves off with long
glittering earrings that swung just clear of
the shoulders. The Gordon lady (she went
off the following night to New Guinea in
company with Mrs. Reggie Allen) also sup-
ported long earrings with her mist-grev
laces. The professorial Andersons were
there, she in old-rose brocades; Dr. Con-
stance D’Arcy, her dimple in great action,
was wrapped in a sable cape; Dr. Ella Sand-
ford Morgan with her much decorated hus-
band, the Mungo MacCallums, the friendly
Laytons, the Halse Rogerses, the David
Maughans, the Wilfred Fairfaxes, she blue-
eyed and fresh of cheek as any English-
woman. helped to make up the shifting and
merry groups of the evening.
A returned wanderer who is grieved at the
passing of Her Majesty’s is Walter Hunt.
As a youngster he trod the boards with Julius
Knight. Walter is just back from India,
where for four and a half years, at the invi-
tation of the Government, he gave English
lectures and recitals throughout the Indian
schools, from the Himalayas in the north to
Trichinopoly in the south. In Madras Mr.
Hunt put on “Hamlet” with a native cast; in
Mysore, whose Maharajah, by the way, is
trying to build up a system of free educa-
tion, he produced “Othello,” two lovely
young girl students playing Desdemona
and Emilia. One adventure of which he is
proud is that he once gave a recital in a
purdah school, being the first man to have
that privilege. Listeners-in on Thursday
afternoon will hear the richly-modulated
voice giving readings in English prose.
Miss Mackay, the widely-known and -liked
secretary of the Queen’s club, was not. on
deck when the farewell party to Philip
Street’s lady was raging through the length
and breadth of the King-street fastness.
She, poor dear, was up in bed with her toes
wrapped in cotton wool. They and a motor-
car had met earlier in the day.
Mrs. Lilian Barrett, not long arrived from
California, where she’s been on the business
side in Uncle Sam’s big paddock, has a novel
under appro, in Sydney. It deals with the
adventures of an Australian girl in the land
of Stars and Stripes. Melbourne is Mrs.
Barrett’s home town ; she went to our Golden
West, married there, and after bier husband’s
death had a brief look at her native Yarra.
She decided to pack up for San Francisco,
and found it, and southern California gener-
ally, a kindly place.

The G.-G. was at the Bachelors’ Ball at
the Wattle Path, St, Ivilda, organised for
Jewish charities. Twenty-two debutantes
were presented to his Ex., afterwards danc-
ing a waltz with their respective partners.
The debs, of last year, with male support,
held gilded rose-decked staves to form a
pergola, beneath which the 1933 contingent
of comers-out passed. Credit for the pic-
turesque notion belongs to Florrie Greene,
who stage-managed the scene. The bachelors
who organised the highly-successful hop had
the help of a committee of women, of which
Mrs. Harold Cohen was president, Her
twine-colored lace gown was topped with a
coatee of pink velvet. In the group which
received the G.-G. were St. Kilda’s Mayor
and Mayoress Johnson, the lady in a white
flat crepe gown, which had a touch of emerald
green about the corsage; Colonel and Mrs.
Cohen, and Mr. and Mrs. Michaelis, and the
lion, sec., Mrs. A. Harris. The third St.
Ivilda group of Jewish Boy Scouts formed
a guard of honor.
The Newman Society’s Ball at the Wattle
Path rendezvous brought forward a record
crop of debutantes. Wearing white and
carrying tiny posies of pink and blue flowers
53 girls made their curtseys to the president
of the society, H. F. Frederico, and his wife.
Afterwards the buds and their partners
danced a set of lancers. Mrs. Frederico
wore flat crepe of peach-pink tint with a
crystal-embroidered cape. About 500 dancers
took the floor.
There was a dance on the stage of His
Majesty’s on Saturday night at which
society obliged the desire of the Overseas
Film Co. to’ get shots of a realistic ballroom
scene for Pat Hanna’s yet-unnamed produc-
tion. The hop was supposed to take place
at a station home, with officers of the Light
Horse among the guests, so the scene was
enlivened with scarlet mess jackets. Dorothy
Parnham, who is leading lady, was a slim,
tall, fair figure in pale green, and Coral
Brown, one of the principals, was in deep
pink satin. Among the guests who were
making their screen debut were Cynthia
Reed, Biddy Tait. Jill Ryan, Agnes Ludlow,
Tom Luxtou and his fiancee, Betty Ranking,
Mona Dunlop, Captain Srvift and Peter
Smith.
The Motor Show, staged in the Exhibition
Hall, was opened by Lieutenant-Governor
Irvine. More beauty and more luxury seem
to be the watchwords of modern car-
designers, and in this show there are vehicle
bodies as elegantly stream-lined as _ Greek
vases. Car windows open or close in sec-
tions, permitting of as little or as much ven-
tilation as may be desired. Everything is
adjustable to the traveller’s comfort —seats,
folding arm-rests and even foot-rests. One
ear has permanent jacks installed underneath
so that chassis adjustments may be made
or a new tyre put on with the least possible
discomfort. One of the big new enclosed
models actually sports a bridge table. If you
want music wherever you go you can have
a radio set installed. A lot of attention has
been paid to the appearance of upholstery.
This, in the latest models, runs the gamut
from plain or checked broadcloth to the hand-
somest of leathers, of hues to match or con-
trast with the exterior finishes, which, in
addition to all the hues and tints in the
rainbow, include metallic glories, aluminium
or chromium. One little sedan, all silver and
rose-red, suggested a boudoir—there was a
whole vanity-box among its fittings.
When the Birthday Honors were scat-
tered at the beginning of the month this
youthful Melbourne matron found herself
directly inter-
ested, her hus-
band Keith

and was a
debutante dur-
ing the visit
of the Duke,

of York, in
1926. She was
married two
years later and is the mother of a small
daughter and a baby son, but finds time to
interest herself in charitable movements,

There was an entente cordiale at the Inter-
national Club when the president, Mrs.
Herbert Brookes, welcomed the Swiss air-
man, Carl Nauer, who came here by train
trom Sydney after having travelled from
Europe to Australia solo in a Puss Moth.
Mrs. Arthur Hordern and Mrs. George Col-
u i i Were hostesses of the tea-drinking. In
at throng were the Consul for Switzerland,
ip'i A - Pietzeker and his wife and Mr.
Herbert Brookes.
Members of the E.S.U. gathered in such
strength for the opening of their new quar-
ters m Tattle Collins-street that secretary
Cdith .Noall had qualms as to whether she
aad selected large enough rooms. Yellow
chrysanthemums and African marigolds
decked the apartments, and knight Arthur
Kobmson,. deputising for the Lud Mayor,
who was in hospital, declared the premises
open. ’
The Queenslanders’ Association welcomed
‘’'. <>n ] ler Morgan Smith at a party at the
'' ln dsor. White camellias cheered the black
georgette gown of Mrs. T. J. Ryan, organiser
ot the gathering. Brigadier-General C. 11.
nrand, president of tin 1 association, made a
speech of greeting. Mollie Warden, Alban
Whitehead, A. Christensen and Jock Thomp-

daughter of the late W. IT. Mann, of Can:
terbury, and of Mrs. M. J. Commons, of
Brighton, exchanged vows with Horace,
younger son of 11. J. Grant, of Albert Park.
The bride wore a robe of ivory Satin that
flowed into a train, with a cascade of white
tulle as veil, and carried a sheaf of creamy
roses and slipper orchids. Her sisters,
Bonnie and Kathleen Mann, attended her in
frocks of angel-skin lace of leaf-green tint,
contrasted with petal-pink felt hats and
shoes. There was a party afterwards at
No. 9.
An afternoon concert at the home of Laura
Nyulasy in aid of St. Martin’s Boys’ Home
was a social event of last week. Glowing
fires offered cheer in the reception room on
a drab, rainy day, and on the threshold
was a flower stall run by Margaret Raws,
Phyllis Mein and Peggy Ahern. The Raws
and Howse ladies assisted Miss Nyulasy and
her sister, Mrs. Charles Cowper, in the duties
of hospitality. Miss Nyulasy’s- cigar-brown
wool frock was trimmed with vest and collar
of pleated frills of beige georgette, and a
feather mount of the same hue appeared on
her velour hat; a coat-frock in corduroy cloth
of a pale snuff shade was sported by Mrs.
Cowper. Gold sequin embroidery trimmed
the top of the sleeves, and her brown velvet
toque was in tune. ’Cellist David Sisser-
man, singers Ainslie Williams and Kathleen
Goodall, pianists Lorna Trist, Margaret
Marshall and mummer Compton Coutts pro-
vided the programme. In the throng were
the Best and Stawell ladies, Mrs. F. W.
Eggleston, Mrs. Norman Brookes and
Cynthia, Mrs. Percy Blackbourn, Mrs. Fred
Krcrouse and Mrs. Harry Emmerton, the
last-named in a coat of baby leopard skins
collared and cuffed with bear fur of a biscuit
tint. The rector of the home, the Rev. Eric
Thomson, gave thanks for the help given.

wedding gown of white satin to which is
added immense glistening gauntlets and a
very high coronet. Earlier in the play she
wears a frock of pink organdie with bodice
and huge puff sleeves of white spotted muslin
of the same shade. In the wedding scene the

pale blue or white, with cart-wheel hats to
match. Pale-green dresses trimmed with
darker green about the corsage, with match-
ing caps and satin slippers, arc worn by the

Phillips at the piano, Mr. Sisserman gave a
fine performance of a ’cello sonata by Breval.

of Jewish music was a trio for violin, ’cello
and piano, by S. Rosovsky, performed by
Miss Phillips-, Colien and Sisserman with fine
understanding.
The Loreto Players, under direction of
Mrs. Maie Hoban, gave a performance of

According to a Melbourne, contemporary,
George Anson, meeting auctioneer Zox and
actor Sass together one day, remarked:
“Why, you fellows are both scriptural char-
acters.” Zox was ready to bet his name
wasn’t mentioned in the Bible, and Sass had
his doubts, but. drinks being wagered, George
scored by quoting the Commandment which
says: “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s
wife, nor his Zox, nor his Sass.” [l7/i/’9l.]
Apropos the falsely-rumored death of Rolf
Boldrewood, Mr. Dangar, sen., of South
Singleton (N.S.W.), was once reported as
having “gone over,” whereupon a Sydney
paper came out with a glowing eulogy of the
virtues of the defunct. But Dangar wasn’t
dead and made the newspaper people stump
up over £lO expenses incurred by him in per-
sonally answering consolatory telegrams
addressed to his relatives. [B/8/’9L]
The Maorilanders are thinking of send-
ing P. A. Buckley, of the Upper House,
to London to be their new Agent-General.
The Upper House would be glad to get rid
of him, for he is not solemn enough for the
billet. He can speak a lot of languages, most
of them pretty badly, so that if any foreign
Power wanted to take his country in he could
go out and talk to it, and as neither party
would be likely to know what the other was
saying no bad results could very well ensue.
Then, he is not likely to commit his
country to any warlike experiments, or to
encourage any Soudan contingents or similar
foolishness, for he took a hand in a contin-
gent himself wlien young, and there was so
little glory and so much hunger and mud
and rheumatism that he is most unlikely
to want any more of the kind. Buckley
went out along with a good many other Irish-
men to light for the Holy Father against
Garibaldi’s red-shirts, and very few of that
Irish Brigade ever came back. Some of
them were killed in battle; and a lot more
were wounded, and then some amateur
sprgeon tried to amputate their damaged
limbs with an axe and a shovel, and finished
them! off. Some of them were left crippled
on the field ere a kindly Garibaldian came
along and finished them with a fence-rail,
for the Liberator’s army consisted of a lot
of noble patriots in front and a lot of irre-
deemable ruffians behind. Some of them were
captured and hung surreptitiously; some
disappeared mysteriously; others eloped
with strange Italian females whose husbands
followed them and shot them in the night;
and a few got into trouble through serenad-
ing girls who didn’t belong to them. Taking
them all round they had a very bad time,
and Buckley has never gone fighting from
that day till this. [l5/8/’9l.]
In happy tadpole times [writes Sappho
Smith], when the rain descends and the mud
riseth up to meet them, one can’t help being-
struck by the feeble grip with which the
average woman hitches her pendent drap-
eries out of harm’s wet way. Half the back
of her gown is grabbed high and dry, cer-
tainly, and then the other half is left hanging
loosely, swabbing up all the liquid incre-
ment round about, and the last state of that
woman is worse than her first. But one
hardly blames her —for there are only two
ways of keeping one’s final frill spotless in
bad weather, and neither of them looks nice
enough to be photographed in. One is to
take off your skirt and hang it in a dry
place ; the other is to give both hands to
the job, and trust to the chivalry of your
male friends to look another way as you
loom across the gutter. To keep a clean
keel and look pretty in the rain is about
as impossible as to fall up a hill. [l5/S/’9l. j
The great official intellect shines out very
conspicuously whenever it gets a fair chance.
When some poor wretch has been run in,
and his clothes have been embezzled, and
his boots collared, the police communicate
a paragraph to the evening papers set-
ting forth that they
want an owner for
one blue tweed over-
coat, one pair grey
pants slightly frayed
at the feet, serge
jacket and waist-
coat, and a silver
Waltham watch, etc.
Then in about half
an hour the air is
full of men all in
want of an outfit,
and all bounding
madly to the police-
office to claim the
property. And the
description furnished
by every one of them
agrees so exactly
with the description
in the newspaper
that there isn’t the
slightest doubt that
the whole lot of
them is the only real
owner. The world
is chock-full of
owners—it is the
property that isn’t
sufficiently copious
to go round. Mean-
while the man who
was arrested is
under lock and key,
so that he can’t
bound in with the
rest and lodge a description and claim
the goods; consequently, whoever gets
the things, he is left every time. And it
never seems to strike anybody that the sys-
tem is altogether to 0 brilliant and too suc-
cessful, for if the police arrested the Union
Bank, and then announced that an owner
was wanted for a capital of £1,000,000 and
a reserve, fund of £BOO,OOO, both of which
were awaiting identification, somebody would
burst round the corner a minute later, and
prove that lie had lost these two articles.
As a handy way, of getting a winter outfit
the best dodge we know is claiming stolen
property, and the next best dodge is identi-
fy™?? lost luggage at the railway station.
N.P.—To work this last dodge inquire
either for a well-worn travelling-bag with
a number of defaced labels on it, or else
for a tin trunk. There are always about
two dozen lost articles of each sort, and
the man; who can’t lodge a description that
will hit one out of the lot had better give
up the trade and turn honest. fls/S/'9l.]
Died of a rush of his own high collar to
the head! At a southern coffee palace last
week a man was found in bed in a strangled
condition. He had on all his clothes, includ-
ing a portentous collar that went up about
his ears, and the conclusion arrived at was
that he had rashly lain down and gone to
sleep in full costume, and the collar had
asphyxiated him. The deceased was aged
only 35 years, and was thus cut off in the
flower and blossom of his existence, treacher-
ously slain by his own linen in the dark.
His togs came silently upon him in that hour
when night is calmest, and laid him low.
There was nothing glorious about his end :
if he had died on a battlefield, or had stood
on the deck of a sinking ship, or perished
amid the ruins of a falling kingdom with
burniug palaces collapsing on his head, he
might have made a passing sensation, and
would probably have left some footprints on
the sands of Time, but he was only shot by
his shirt in an attic and dropped into an
obscure grave. His fate is a warning to
the rising generation to beware of the tall
collar that walketli in darkness and the im-
mense starched bosom that lays for its vic-
tim in shadowy places. [l/8/’9l.]

A PUBLIC MAN’S PLAY.
[ln bis N. S. Wales days Tommy Walker,
M.L.A. for Northumberland for seven years
(1887-94). and for Ivanowna ( W.A.) for a
quarter of a century, wrote plays and acted
in one or two. His “Voices of the Night” was
produced by Dampier at the old Iloyal Stand-
ard Theatre, Sydney, in July, 1886. It was
devastatingly reviewed by James Edmond
for The Bulletin, as was the same author’s
HE’D LOOK LIKE 'ENERY.
[Phil May —21/1/’88.]
“Marmondelle the Moor.” Walker kept the
cuttings to the day of his death, and showed
them now and then in Wesfralia—where he
became Attorney-General and Speaker—-to
friends who had Avon his confidence, doing
it in a melancholy fashion, as if convinced
that Edmond had blasted the career of a
great actor-manager in the making.]
“Voices of the Night,” at Sydney Royal
Standard, is one of the wildest pieces of
scene-shifting ever witnessed in Australia,
Regarded simply as drama, the piece is not
there In constructing it the author, Mr.
“Thomas Somers,” seems to have Secured
a pork-fed vision of the night and chopped
it up with the axe of comprehensive genius
into six deliriums and an orange snake. All
pretence of a coherent story has been left
out. but where the narrative should be we
have a raw lobster climbing a tree and an
intoxicated yellow agony drinking the
Queen’s health “alien samee white man.”
Thcre are twelve scenes, every one of which
is in itself a magnificent piece of art, and
a liindquarter of drama is impaled on the
spike-end of each scene. But it is possible
that the author of “Voices of the Night”
thought it advisable, considering the title, to
leave his audience somewhat in the dark, and,
though the action is difficult to follow, it
is satisfactory to know that all ends well.
It is necessary, of course, that vice should
be, defeated at the last, and in this case it
is squashed as effectually as the crab that
Avas sat upon by Jumbo when that porten-
tons animal was in his prime.
The first scene is laid at Redfcrn railway
station, where two wicked men are laying
schemes and two larrikins are chivvying a
Chinaman. Including the Mongol, that
makes five characters altogether. A virtu-
ous individual appears, and is greeted by two'
charming young ladies; a dirty hag admon-
islies a sinner in a stove-pipe hat, and tells
him to come to his wife,
who is starving; a sea cap-
tain lays his vengeful hand
on the same individual’s
windpipe, and wants his
daughter; and a guileless
newchum has his luggage
stolen by a cabman and his
letters of credit embezzled
by Ananias. Later on we
learn that the good man is
a Communist, escaped from
New Caledonia, where he
had been sent on a false
charge, and owing to the
strawberry mark on his arm
we are able to recognise the
stove-pipe hat as his long-lost
brother. Messrs. Joe and
Jack Willis, aided by Ah
Chow, Chow Fat and Wong
Hi, then finish cleaning out
the newchum, and that gen-
tleman is reduced to sleeping
in the Domain. Here the
stove-pipe man gets a friend
to throw his wife over the
rocks, but the lady, by good
luck, falls into the arms of
her father, who is mourning
his lost daughter just below,
and she knocks the breath
out of her bereaved parent.
The newchum goes to milk
cows with his eyeglass on
the H'awkesbury—that sen-
tence is a little mixed, but
not more so than the drama
—and in a limp, doubled-up
sort of way he succeeds in
clearing the Communist of a false accusation
of murder trumped up by his brother,, but the
unhappy man is dragged off to New Cale-
donia as an escaped convict, leaving his
sweetheart weeping against a verandah-post,
and for the time vice is uppermost.
Tableau 111 opens with a snake and a
raw lobster climbing a tree. The sinner
with the tall hat, aided by the other sinner
with the wideawake, has persuaded the sor-
rowing sweetheart to take a \oyage
schooner, under the pretence of rescum„ 1
lover from Noumea, and has earned n i
to New Guinea. The girl, howevei, i >
believes she is in New Caledonia, and su -
denly sights her lover on a ratt ou bea.
She flies to his rescue, and the conspnato .
stand on a tuft of grass and curse their ev
luck, while the snake, listening be ind *
tree, resolves to bite them at the first oppor-
tunity, and makes a knot in his tail to keep
} nm in minfl °L{jp is a venom-
however, the reptile after dancing a venom
rescued, and the party return to Sydney. ,
At the station on the Hawkesbury the
depraved brother attempts once more to
abduct the young lady, but the newchum is
lounging about with a revolver in front ot
him and a doorpost behind, and the battled
sinner is left standing with his legs wide
apart, like an enraged pair of compasses,
Later on he chloroforms his brother and
lays him on the Coogee tramline, but a relict
expedition seizes him by the legs and hauls
him off just as the motor comes along.
The sixth tableau is devoted to uncorking
a bottle of fine old crusted vengeance. Jhe
blighting genius in the tall hat is found lean-
ing against the wall of a dirty room, but lie
rushes out to perpetrate some transgression
he has forgotten. In his absence the new-
chum comes in and also leans against the
Avail, but presently, owing to architectural
defects, lie falls through. Consequently he
is not there while the other man is drugging
a young lady, and he also misses the sight
of two brothers fighting with knives and
painting the whole leasehold property crim-
soli. But presently his eyeglass rises in
the east like the morning sun on a fair
landscape, and he smooths matters wondei-
fully by proving to be a detective and arrest-
ing all the unrighteous crowd. It is con-
soling to learn, however, that the straw-
berry mark has deceived us, and the sup-
posed brother is only a distant relation by
bigamy or something of the sort. His ulti-
mate fate is uncertain, but it seems safe
to presume , that he was shortly afterwards
cut off like a flower in his bloom, and is now
keeping company with Captain Moonlight,
C.M.G. .
The best parts in the drama fall to the
lot of Mr. Dampier, who stands behind an
eyeglass, waiting for his remittance; Messrs,
Baker and Stoneliam, the two leading vil-
lains; Mr. Alfred Boothman, the Communist;
Mr. Leston, as a Chinese cook, who makes
rabbit-pie out of cats; and Mr. Tasman.
The neAvchum and the Chinamau are the
principal favorites. If this brilliant zoolo-
gical shorv fails to become anything more
than a landscape nightmare, the fault cannot
be charged to the performers. Even the
snake displays a surprising amount of dra-
rnatic ability; and the tree-climbing lobster,
though seemingly only an amateur at his
is about as good as could be expected,
All this reptile wants is a little more acti-

WHAT MATTERS IT?
What matters it if, by-and-bye,
Our Aryan race should wane and die,
And Mongol with dark Etliiop vie
To rule the wide world, by-and-bye?
Infinity of Time hath seen
Changes as strange as this, I ween —
What mattered it?
What matters it if we rebel
Against life’s misery, and sell
The weary years we know so well
For Death’s exchange? They’re ours to sell!
And when we lie in endless sleep,
Should one or none in memory weep—
What matters it?
What matters it? The end comes fast,
The sea is wild, the night cloud-cast,
A comrade’s aid in vain is asked ;
Sauve qui pent! is best at last.
Together sink the true and base,
A careless Fate, death marks each face —
What matters it?
What matters it? What matters all
In life—if life be end of all?
Our loves and longings fade and fall;
And sadly glide beyond recall
The years which should be brightest, best,
Then asks our heart, sick with unrest—
“ What matters it?”

A STRAYAWAY.


NORTH OF TWENTY-EIGHT.
“Slavery” in Queensland
“Albany Pass”: Whatever may have been
the case in the far-away past, the treatment
of aboriginals in Queensland has for many
years, been creditable to the State. The
Aborigines’ Protection Act of the ’9o’s,
which has been amended from time to time
in directions indicated by experience, was
the first legislation of its kind in Australia.
Its provisions with regard to the engage-
ment and payment of aboriginal labor, on
outback stations and in the Torres Strait
fisheries, and its supervision by official in-
spectors were a great advance on anything
previously attempted. This has been so
generally recognised that the experience of
at least two of Queensland’s Chief Protec-
tors, the late I)r. Roth and J. W. Bleakley,
has been utilised by Westralia and the
Northern Territory in connection with their
aboriginal problems.
Small wonder, then, that articles alleging
atrocious, treatment of aboriginals by em-
ployers in North Queensland should have
aroused indignation throughout the State.
When these first appeared in a Brisbane
weekly, little heed was paid to them locally, .
since the real facts are familiar to all Queens-
landers. But the farrago was reproduced
with blood-and-thunder embellishments in
London “Daily Herald, v and it lias' been
found necessary to publish official denials.
Unfortunately there exists no means of.
laying the originators of this kind of false-
hood by the heels. Papua has an excellent
law which inflicts heavy punishment for
“spreading lying reports.” Queenslanders
from Thursday Island to> Cooloongatta
would applaud the Government if it put
legislation of a similar nature on the State
statute-books.
Problem of the Half -caste
“Aus. Native”; In its policy the Queens-
land Abo. Department has rather fallen
from its high ideals during the past few
years, despite much blowing of trumpets.
Palm Island, on which a large amount of
money is spent, has, it is true, been developed
with good results (although now looked upon
as a showplace for tourists), but in other
directions the Administration has taken the
narrow view. For example, an educated
lialf-caste earning his living respectably is
liable to he. removed to an aboriginal reserve
at the whim of an official. The onus of
proving that he does not come within the
provisions of the Act is thrust upon the
individual. This is a state of things which
needs alteration.
The Home Secretary states that considera-
tion is to be given to the question of bring-
ing all half-castes under the control of the
Abo. Department. This is likely to cause
further grave concern if it is to be inter-
preted as meaning that the Act will be
applied to all those who cannot produce a
certificate of pure white blood. For obvious
reasons its implications cannot be gone
into here; but, disfranchised, stigmatised as
an abo., and subject to the dictatorial com-
mands of any Jack-in-office who can use a
rubber stamp, a half-caste can have no
happy future.
“Macti”: The case of the ranger who in-
stituted proceedings against himself for
allowing his horse to wander and was duly
fined recalls the conscientious action of a
native policeman at a North Queensland
abo. station. After an altercation with his

held court, presented the case, and fined

by boat to Government headquarters, 20
idles away, handed in the fine and a rolled-
up parcel. “That one uniform belong me,”
explained Jacky. “I give him back because

mended .tacky’s integrity, and restored his
'.iniform, choking back his chuckles till the
faithful servant of the law was out of ear-
shot. .
Skipjack”: Mysterious vessels which re-
luse to stop or to acknowledge signals con-
tinue to be sighted off the N.T. and N.Q.
coasts, and plants of shell and oil fuel have
been found on Buchanan Island. A fast
patrol vessel to overhaul the well-engined
strangers, which always make off when
sighted, is needed, but the proposal to em-
ploy seaplanes is not favored, in the North.

“0. Coral” : At a Thursday Island mission
station where the church is constructed of
bark with a split-palm floor, the dusky mem-
bers of . the congregation are in the habit of:
sidling up to the window and expectorating
with vigor when occasion demands. The
old white-haired native sidesman lias insti-
tuted. a reform, however. So when a tall,
bewhiskered individual moved to the win-
dow the other day his alert eye noted it.
and his bare feet pattered across the building
■to where the other stood. Then he pointed
to the floor and whispered. The smile of
gratification that came over the face of
Jimmy was followed by an appraising glance
downward; then he carefully spat through
the hole in the floor to which he attention
had been directed. A satisfied sidesman re-
sumed liis kerosene-box seat.
“Eepee”: Queensland can go one better
than “Little Minch’s” story of the Skye
crofter’s family bed (B. 31/5/’33). A home-
stead-lease inspector travelling in the back-
blocks was benighted many miles from any-
where. He chanced upon a settler’s cabin,
consisting of one large room. In one corner
was a double bed; in another a quantity of
sacks. The settler, his wife and six child-
ren were at .dinner, and the traveller was
invited to join the circle. After the meal
the two youngest were put to bed. Shortly
afterwards their mother deftly removed the
now-sleeping kids to the bags in the corner
and the next two occupied the bed. They
in their turn were transferred to make way
for the eldest pair. The tired visitor was
glad when, after pointing to the bed and
wishing him “good night,” the settler and
his wife left the room. Awaking early in
the morning, the traveller found himself in
the corner with the children and his host
and hostess asleep in the bed.

“Union Official” : I have known the sugar
country since the days of the kanakas. Once
we worked 11 hours for the day shift and 13
hours for the night shift. Field hours were 6
to 6; and the pay was 225. 6d. per week with
tucker. I have watched hours contract and
wages expand, but all the time there was
increase of production. To-day the acre
grows more cane, and mills get more
of the sugar contents and the rollers crush
more cane per hour. The price for cane has
increased in a greater ratio than wages.
Regular dividends are paid by practically
all milling and refining companies, which
cannot be said of many other primary indus-
tries ; yet the cane-farmer growls. When the
hours were eight per day I have seen 7000
men in Bundaberg alone waiting for jobs
that were not there, so that hours alone
are not responsible for any cane trouble.
Added productivity should give the employees
either more wages or fewer hours. Until
the machinery that “Goela” (B. 14/6/’33)
uses instead of men learns to consume tin-
product he wishes to sell, he will find his
problem still in front of him.
“Longinus” : Abo. gins are a snare round
a camp. While prospecting north-east of
Barrow Creek, in Central Aus., last year we
engaged a most intelligent young buck as
a camel boy and woodland-water joey. “Two
Emus” had one disability; .he had a wife,
and we had to feed her. We knew that if
we kicked her out her lord would promptly
bolt,, and we couldn’t afford to lose his
services. I suggested to my mate that we
try to initiate Goldilocks (like many gins
in C.A., she had tawny hair) into a spot
of work. We gave her a start on the wash-
ing-up. She made quite a fair jolt of it.
CROOL!
“I got a beer at my last house. How did you yet on?”

except that she dropped nearly everything,
which, being unbreakable, didn’t matter

had closed my eyes sleepily when a horrified
ejaculation from my companion caused me
to open them with a start. Goldi. was

Cattle-dogs in Spain.
BY ROBERT KALESKI.
YAIRS,” drawled Long Harry, the
drover, to an expectant audience in
the bar of The Travellers’ Rest, on
the road to Cloncurry; “it’s good to be back
ag’in. I seen er bit uv the world while I
wuz away, but Orsetralia’ll do me fer th’ rest
uv me life. Th’ trouble I’ve had ter git me
cattle-dogs on trains ’n’ inter picksh'er-shows
in furrin’ parts is beyond belief.
“Believe me or believe me not, I ’ad ter
keep ’em muzzled nearly all th’ time simply
becos people would keep cornin’ up ’n’ sayin’,
‘Wot lovely anermals. Are they blue wolves
or reelly tame dogs?’ Then, before I could
stop ’em, they’d go to stroke ’em ’n’ lose a
finger or a bit uv their ’ands; and th’ crowd
round ’ud jabber in their own lingo like a
lot uv loonatics.
“I took ’em out as pups when I wuz
drovin’ a tliousan’ bullicks fer Kidman, from
Kimberley to Normanton meatworks. Two
years it took us ter get ’em across; but I
landed ’em there fat, without losin’ a beast.
Wot them pups didn’t learn erbout handlin’
stubborn bullicks ’n’ fightin’ blacks on th’
way over wuzn’t worth knowin’.
“If Tiger couldn’t turn a wild beast back
inter th’ mob ’e’d up ’n’ grab it by th’
muzzle like a bulldorg till it fell over wallop.
Then ’e wouldn’t let go till I’d called ’im
orf. Mavis c’d smell blacks miles away, ’n’
Gawd ’elp any ’uv them if they tried ter
sneak on th’ camp.
“When I come ter Sydney fer er change,
uv course I brort both dogs an’ me best
camp-’orse with .me, so’s I wouldn’ feel
lonely. ’N’ when I gets tired uv th’ town
one uv tli’ big stock agents gets me ter take
charge uv a mob of stud Illiwarra Short-
horns for furrin parts.
“We ’ad a good trip over—on’y lost one
bull *n’ a heifer. We wuz all a bit sick
at first. Crossin’ th’ Bite, they called it;
a rotten sorter place. Nuthin’ but water
rollin’ in all direckshuns at once. I wuz too
sick ter ask ’em where th’ Bite come in—
’n’ w’en we got ter Perth I’d forgotten all
erbout it, ’n’ settled down with me men to
enjoy meself.
“We ’ad good weather till we got ter
Spain; ’n’ w’en th’ boat tied up at th’
wharf a dark young chap come on board ’n’
told me ’e ’ad come from th’ Juke ter show
me w’ere ter take ’is stud cattle. ’E knoo
a little Orsetralian, V seemed a very decent
bloke, so we got on well together. Don
Carlos ’is name wuz. I called ’im Carlo fer
short. ’E wuz greatly taken _ with Tiger
an’ Mavis. After I’d warned ’im off tryin’
to make friends with them, ’e wanted to
know wot they were fer. I ’adn’t. let ’em
work cornin’ off th’ boat fer fear uv bein'
too severe.
“ ‘You’ll soon see,’ I tells ’im, ’f th’ cattle
play up.’ Even th’ quietest will do that
wailin’ off a long trip and gettin’ on hard
ground again. Sure enuf, after they’d been \
travellin’ along th’’ road a bit ,’n’ found' it
didn’t swing up ’n’ down, away went th’
whole eighty uv ’em in all direckshuns. I’d
taken me ole camp-’orse over in case th’
nags in Spain were.no good. (I give ’im ter
Carlo when I come away.) The way .we
flew roun’ those cattle wuz a caution.
’Course Tiger ’n’ Mavis did their bit. "I
’ad ’em both muzzled,, uv course, so’s not
to mark any of ’em, ’n’ Carlo’s eyes fairly
goggled till we’d got ’em rounded ,up ,’n’
steadied down ter their travellin’ pace.
“ ‘Caramba !’ ’e ses ; ‘eet ees wonderful!
Better than a bullfight.’
‘“Bullfight, bullfight ?’ I ses, puzzled,
‘there’s nuthin’ in seein’ bulls fight. Tiger
’n’ Mavis ’ll fight any bull ever wuz calved,
though.’
“ ‘No, no, I do not mean that,’ ’e answers.
‘A man fight thee bull in thee ring and kills ■
heem. I will take you to one.’
“ ‘Right,’ I sez, ‘that’ll do me.’ Th’ ole
Juke wuz so pleased th’ way I brort ’is
Illiwarras over that ’e gave me a bonus
uv thirty quid,- which I split up with the
other fellers. Then with Carlo showin’ us
roun’ Ave ’ad a good time. On’y, uv, course,
as I wuz telli.n’ yer, I ’ad ter watch Mavis
’n’ Tiger all th’ time. If,l muzzled, ’em
when I took ’em out it made ’em too savage.
“At larse th’ day came fer th’ bullfight.
It’s jus’ like the Agriculcheral Show Groun’
in Sydney—a big sanded ring V seats V
grandstands all roun’. Th’ fence didn’t look
too secure ter me either, but I never said
nuthin’.
“Carlo sits on one side of me, mo chief
helper on the other, Mavis between me knees.
Tiger, bein’ a bit headstrong from want of
work, I ’as on a lead in front uv me. Th’
place wuz packed like th' Show on Easter
Mund’y. Must er bin fifty thousand iin th’
stands beside those on th’ groun’. Wot sur-
prised me more’n anythin’ wuz that about
half of th’ mob wuz women ’n’ kids. There
wuz a couple uv old crocks uv' ’or.-fes, with
padded rugs on, in th’ ring. Thby wuz
ridden by fellers that looked as' if they’d
fall out over cart. Some active-lookin’
blokes wuz on foot, dressed up in short velvet
pants ’n’ silk shirts, with little red flags in
their ’ands. Piccolos, Carlo said they were.
In th’ middle uv th’ ring wuz another feller
dressed ter kill, with a big ; red silk scarf
on ’is arm V a short sword in ’is right-
’and. . ■■ -
“Presently they opens a door in th’ ring
fence ’n’ out pops a lanky red bull with
sharp ’orns, much like a rangy Devon. ’E
gives a bellow uv rage ’n’ starts pawin’ th’
ground at a great rate. One uv th’ blokes
on th’ nags rides up to ’im ’n’ prods ’im
with a long, sharp pole. ’E charges, knocks
th’ ole ’orse over, gives ’im a couple uv
rips fer luck ’n’ looks round fer somethin’
else ter gore. .
“Th’ blokes on foot get round ’im ’n’ throw
their little flags at ’im in turn, two of ’em
stickin’ to ’is shoulders (must ’ave ’ad darts
fix-M to ’em). ’E bellers ’n’ tries ter rip
th’ blokes with ’is ’orns, but they’re too
slippy fer ’im. Then they nip ter th’ fence
’n’ leave th’ bull re gin’ in th’ ring, with
tli’ man with th’ sash ’n’ sword standin’
there quite cool.
“Th’ bull catches sight uv ’im hr stands
like a stone lookin’ at ’im. Y’ could ’ave
’eard a pin drop. I wuz so excited I: fergot
ter hold Tiger’s lead, though I keeps me
grip on Mavis’s collar. Tlr’ bull creeps up
like a cat after a mouse, till within fifty
yards of th’ man, then puts down .’is ’ead
’n’ charges like an express train. _ Th’. bloke
stepped out ter meet ’im, wavin’ th’ red
scarf. Just as tli’ bull’s nearly on ’im I
feels a tug at me ’and. Next thing a blue
streak is goin’ fer the bull. Tiger, it wuz,
and ’e catches th’ bull be tli’ nose just
before it gets to th’ matterdore (as they calls
’im), an’ in a few yards throws ’im on ’is
side with a crash you could ’ear all over
tli’ ring. Jus’ 'as th’ bull’s failin’ ’e gives
th’ matterdore a kick in the tummy that
doubles ’im up like a knife. ’ls stvord went
one way ’n’ the scarf the other. Th’ people
nearly went mad.
“ ‘Perro, perro!’ they screams (I found
out after ‘perro’ is their name fer a dorg).
I gave th’ ‘come-off’ whistle at once, fer
I c’d see meself gettin’ unpopler with tli’
mob. Tiger lets go ’n’ comes back ter me
as quick as ’e went. I gives ’im th’ office
ter git in between me legs with Mavis, ’n’
low at that. It wuz over so quick no one
saw where Tiger went. After a few minutes
tli’ mob quietened down again, but th’ bull
’n’ tli’ matterdore were both down ’n’ out.
Neither of ’em had any fight left in ’em.
“Carlo’s eyes goggled again when ’e saw
Tiger’s performance, but ’e ’ad th’ sense
ter keep quiet. ’E whispers me not ter let
it ’appen again or th’ mob’ud knife us. So
you bet I kep’ a good grip on Tiger after
that. Th’ next turn wuz a very tame affair.
Th’ bull must ’ave been, cowed be th’ crowd,
fer ’e took it all as quiet as an ole Jersey
milker. They hooted ’im outer tli’ ring.
After erbout ’arf an ’our’s interval th’ star
item came on. Th’ matterdore wuz one uv
th’ finest-built men I ever seen. ’E moves
like a myall warrior. Carlo' tells me all
Spain’d mourn if ’e were killed.
“ ‘Then w’y let ’im fight?’ I asks ’im.
“ ’E shrugs ’is shoulders in that furrin
way they ’ave. ‘Eet ces ’is profession,’ ’e
says, an’ no more.
“I thort I’d seen some outlaw bulls in me
time, but w’en this one came outer ’is cave
I seen th’ worst. Active as a Devon steer
off the basalt ranges, big as a Durham V
strong as a lion, with a big pair uv. straight,
sharp horns set aside a long, coffin-shaped
head, ’e looked fer all th’ world, with ’is
wicked, blazin’ eyes ’n’ quiverin’ ears, like
tli’ Devil in the old pickslier books. ’ls neck
’n’ shoulders wuz all scarred over with
wounds ’ealed up after old battles. ’E
shoots one look roun’ th’ ring just like a
champeen boxer. Then ’e makes one light-
n in’ rush at th’ ’orseman ’n’ topples ’orse
’n’ rider over like a ninepin. Nex’ ’e turns
on. th’ piccolos afore they ’ad time ter get
round” ’im; ’n’ tosses two of ’em fair outer
th’ ring, tli’ rest gettin’ out afore ’e c’d
' reach ’em. Then ’e gallops, up within twenty
yards uiv Hh’Tnattferdore, ’oo stands waitin’
-fer, ’im,.red scarfTn>’and. .
“As soon as I seen ’im stop I c’d feel
’ow .it’d -go. Th’ bull• crep’ up an inch at
a. time, with ./ is wicked ’ead stiff ’n’ ’is
burnin’ eyes never off th’ matterdore’s face.
Ten feet off ’e charges—not at the matter-
dore,'but jus’ be’ind ’iih, so’s w’en ’e jumped
back ’e’d get ’im. Th’ matterdore must ’ave
read; it in ’is eyes, befcos' ’e stood still, an’
th’' devil ■ shot past ’im, jus’ brusliin’ ’is
back ’n’ th’ scarf with ’is side as ’e went.
- ,“’E ’ad guch p ace U p > e we nt fifty yards
afore ’e c’d turn. Then ’e came back at
th’ gallop till ’e wuz about twenty feet off
th’ matterdore again.. .’E stops, creeps up
’n’ charges ag’in. this time full fer ’im, but
with ’is ’ead sideways ’n’ ’is neck weavin’
like, a snake’s. Y’ could ’ear tli’ mob draw
its' breath as th’ matterdore steps back er
pace; as th’ ’orn brushes ’im ’e drives in
th’ sword fer th’ spine. Tli’ bull twists ’is
neck out uv danger, ’n’ the sword cuts deep
on th’ side. Tli’ bull shoots away past
th’ . matterdore with a scream like a mad
’orse.
“ ‘ ’E’ll get th’ man this time,’ I ses ter
Carlo. ‘ ’E’s not a bull, ’e’s a devil.’ . Back
’e comes, back as fresh as ever ’n’ starts
creepin’ up, again. Th’ matterdore comes
down ter meet ’im this time, V they looks
inter each other’s burnin’ eyes fer a second.
Then th’ bull charges, props dead just
against th’ matterdore, ’n’ as th’ man steps
across ’ooks ’im with ’is ’orn ’n’ throws ’im
senseless, ter th’ ground ’n’ rushes past.
“One deep groan bursts from th’ mob.
“ ‘ ’Ere, I can’t stand this!’ I shouts ter
Carlo. ‘At .’em, boys,’, ’ll’ I slips both th’
dogs at the bull ter. get it before it could
turn ’n’ give th’ man on th’ ground tli’ death
thrust. I tell yer, it wuz worth a lifetime
ter see th’ way those dorgs went fer that
bull. ’E'wuz no worse ter them than some
of those . Kimberley outlaws uv Paddy
Durack’s. ; They took ’im fore ’n’ aft like a
pair uv demons. Mavis, bein’ th’ fastest,
got there first, ’n’ went fer th’ ’ind legs,
as she; always did, drawin’ blood at every
bite. Be th’ time Tiger got there she had
th’ bull spinnin’ like'a top, tryin’ to get at
her, till ’e began ter get giddy. Tiger circled
in front, just outer reach uv th’ horns, wait-
in’, for a chance fer a noseliold. The mob
just held their breath ’n’ watched.
“But that bull was mad-cunnin’—jus’ like
a man loonatic. ’E wanted ter shake tli’
dorgs off V. go back ’n’ finish tli’ matter-
dore. So ’e makes er, beeline fer tli’ fence,
half-hamstrung as ’e was with Mavis’s bitin’,
backs up ag’in th’ fence so’s they can’t git
be’ind ’im, ’n’ makes lightnin’ drives at ’em
with ’is ’orns.
“ ‘Now’s th’ time,’ I ses ter Carlo; ‘let’s
get th’ matterdore orf w’ile they ’old 'im/
Carlo’s ez .white as chork. but 'e wuz dead
game. We hopped inter th’ ring, ran over
’n’ picked th’ pore feller up between us 'n’
hurried over with ’im ter th’ fence. We wuz
nearly th.cre when th’ bull saw us. Chancin’
th’ dorgs, ’e made a lightnin’ rush ter nail
us. Just as ’e put ’is wicked ’ead down ter
charge, Tiger • dashed in ’n* got ’im be th’
nose, V held ’im in a death grip.
“Th’ bull ran a few yards, but Tiger’s
dead w-eight pulled ’im up short, ’n’ e stood
there tryin’ to shake off th’ dorg V beller-
in’ in a way’d curdle yer blood. We handed
th’ matterdore over th’ barrier ter th’ crowd
without losin’ a second. Carlo followed in
quick time, but I stopped be’ind ter see
the dorgs pull down th’ bull.
“I said that bull wuz mad-cunuin’. As
soon as ’e found ’e couldn’t shake Tiger
loose ’n’ gore ’im, V starts ter pull ’is ’ead
between ’is front legs so ’e c’d paw ’im ter
death with ’is sharp ’oofs. Tiger’s been at
th’ game before, though; ’n’ that’s w’ere
Mavis comes inter th’ play. While Tiger
dug all four feet in ’n’ hung to tli’ bull.
Mavis darts in be’ind ’is front feet, choppin’
into the back of ’is forelegs like a demon,
so ’e couldn’t use ’em on Tiger at all.
“Th’ bull stood it fer five minutes or more,
screamin’ like a devil from Hell; but at
larse ’e c’d stand it no longer, ’n’ collectin’
all ’is strength ’e made er run ter shake
Tiger off ag’in. ’E got ’arf-way across th’
ring, but ’is strength failed ’im, ’n’ down ’e
went wallop, like a loaded waggin tippin’
inter a bog, with Tiger bangin’ ontcr [im
as tight as ever ’n’ Mavis heelin’ ’is ’ind
legs a perisher.
“Jus’ fer devilment (I knew Tiger wouldn’t
let go till I told ’im) I walked over ’n’ sat
on us back ’n’ waved me big felt ’at at th[
audjence. Y’d think Hell’d broken loose th’
way th’ mob shouted.
“ ‘EI perros, el perros,’ they roared like
thunder ’n’ threw money inter th’ ring till y’d
’ave thort it wuz a silver-mine, i bowed
ag’in, V waved me big hat. Then Carlo
comes runniii’ over ter me.
“ ‘Come, come, Senor ’Arree,’ ’e ses, very-
excited ; ‘queek, queek, the Juke weel present
you to the Keeng. And bring the perros.’
“ ‘All right,’ I ses ; ‘on’y get someone ter
pick up th’ cash ’n’ give it ter th’ poor ole
matterdore.’
“ ‘See, see,’ ’e ses ; ‘come queek.’
“So I whistles off th’ dorgs (th’ bull ’ad
burst ’is ’eart when ’e fell), gets th’ leads
on ’em ’n’ follows Carlo ter th’ King’s box.
Th’ King shakes hands with both of us ’n’
praises our bravery in rescooin’ th’ cham-
peen matterdore; but I tells ’im it wuz no-
thin’ —tli’ dorgs did orl th’ work.
“ ’E smiles at that, ’n’ the Queen arsks
if she kin pat the brave dorgs (both th’
King and th’ missus spoke good English
as me or you). So I ’olds Tiger ’n’ Mavis
tight ’n’ she pats ’em both ’n’ ties a blue
ribbon round each uv their necks, while th’
movie man kept ’is machine rattlin’ on us
orl th’ time. Then we went ’ome ’n’ ’ad
tea ’n’ a sleep.
“Nex’ mornin’ Carlo comes fer me again.
Th’ King wants ter see us ’n’ th’ dorgs up
at th’ Pallis. So up we goes. Th’ King ’n’
a lot uv th’ ’eads are standin’ on th’ lawn.
Everyone looks very solium. _ Th’ King
shakes ’ands with us ag’in ’n’ pins a bronze
cross ’n’ ribbon on th’ breasts of our coats.
Then ’e gets me ter ’old Mavis ’n’ Tiger
w’ile ’e wires another one each to their col-
lars. ‘The Cross fer Bravery,’ ’e ses. sol-
ium ; ‘never given before outer th’ ranks.’
“Carlo ’n’ I ’ad a lively week of it, V
then I come away be th’ first boat. Life got
to be a misery. Wot with th’ movie people
offerin’ me jobs at me own price, ’n’ people
•wantin’ ter buy Tiger ’n’ Mavis at any
price, it wuz awful. So we struck camp fer
’ome, ’n’ th’ dorgs wuz as glad as me ter
git there.
“An’ if any uv yousc fellers think I’m
pullin’ yer legs, ’ere’s th’ three crosses
’n’ tli’ noosepaper stuff in me pouch, with
all our pickshers in ’em. Yer kin pass ’em
round ’n’ ’ave a look at ’em fer yourselves.”

lherefore, what happened to me that night
w “ s 80 v " y s * ral ’ g ' “ tel . .
I had met his daughter on a ship and
liked her immensely, and on this golcien P eb-
ruary evening, with' the hot day dying into
a voluptuously soothing north-easterly wind,
I found myself knocking at the door of the
big house to which I had been bidden by the
daughter to di.nne .
me from all round a series of unimaginable
dfmswe°e“ upriringlSiiS rile
sky that means to us the Blue Mountains.
All the pseudonyms for magnificent rushed
nf mn invnncl \r ‘lnri T c*nrl them all over to
d vnntnrous content—
Magnificent a Gorgeous Unearthly. Colossal,
The ophn land,
darldy green, flowed away and away to the
mountains in t a swooning goldenness with
silver in it as the full moon came up from
the other direction and turned all the dark
trees darker and made the lights in streets
and house paler and softer and sweeter. And
then the door opened.
I had never been there before and I looked
round me with interest.
The tall black-haired daughter ot the
house was a fairly new acquaintance. I
had come at her pressing invitation to meet
rr~ Lu nhn o-uhior ta iivitw In her
grey gown with her liair demure,' she was
quaint and charming and as. always, abac-
lutelv natural, in spite of her intense clever-
ness’that had so attracted me on the ship.
“My mother, my father.”
Yes, and they were absolutelymatural too.

Vve settled down in that vast room in that
vast house, built in the year one when money
didn’t count. Then builders just built and
built and went on building, adding towers
that towered, and ballrooms that were never
anything else—unless during long after-
wards when they were turned into dormi-
tories ’ for Sunshine Homes, or dining-rooms
for Barnardo Boys, or anything that there
was enough of
Comfort abounded. Rich' carpets, deep
arm-chairs, satin cushions.
, . ~
And then wo all went in to dinner.
A nice, homely, simple, well-cooked dinner.
A dinner that was like the host, the hostess
and the daughter, perfectly and completely
natural. _
We had roast loin of lamb, baked potatoes,
peas, cabbage, mint sauce, rich hot gravy,
and an apple pie and cream to follow.
But what was my brain doing that it so
continually brought me back to the same
point, Father?
No matter what I was thinking or saying,
I found myself continually recurring to the
•same theme. Father!
Who was Father? What was Father?
What did Father do for a crust? He must
he, I decided, a lawyer, a doctor, a poet or
a professor.
The home spelled ample means, even
wealth possibly concealed somewhere, I
wouldn’t be surprised; but where did Father
get it?
And, above all, how on earth did that man
acquire his marvellous manner, that was
polished yet not polished, and his face? Both
went together so perfectly, so smoothly,
that I almost cried out sometimes “How
wonderful you are!”
It was a grave face, longish and calm.
Father’s, with beautiful dark-grey serious
eyes. There was a clear pallor in the cheeks
that suggested an age of somewhere between
forty-five and fifty-five. He was chiselled
and curiously composed, with the brightest,
sweetest, flattest smile I have ever seen, the
lips seeming to flatten right out strangely,
and the white teeth' gleaming out of the
centre of the smile.
Always his voice, like Mother’s, was very
gentle, very simple.
He and Mother both seemed to say only
exactly what they thought, nothing else, and
they seemed both to think only nice thoughts.
But Mother looked much’ older —nearer
seventy, I thought, with a red, kindly human
face, little brown eyes, and the per-
fectly gentle, natural, simple manner, bome-
how, I kept expecting those two to say some-
thing different.
I kept expecting Father to break out with
something sarcastic a.nd biting.
And I kept expecting Mother to burst
into something complaining and sharp. In
fact, I kept feeling that no two grown-up
people could really be as natural and gentle
as all that. But no!
Their stream of marvellous gentleness was
never for one instant ruffled, and all I could
do was to sit there and wonder how people
came to be so appallingly and overwhelm-
ingly “nice,” never arguing, never disagree-
ing.
The tall, brown Englishman gulped and
gasped and threw. He jumped from Italy
to Greece, from poetry to prose and then to
modern French—ah! and there he was truly
at home, telling us of Marcel Proust, and
Andre Hide, and Morand, and Maurois, and
all the rest of them, whom he knew person-
ally 7.
Father to all that scintillation said no-
thing. but just quietly and naturally ate
and drank, and I found myself wondering
what the brilliant talk might mean to him.
Was he a pedant? Was he some rare scien-
tist such ak Sydney so often Unearths (and
earths too, alas, not infrequently).
Once when Father was passing me the
cream an awful suspicion flung itself at
me.
I do believe the man .is a shopwalker,
I thought.
Next moment, I withdrew it. He was not
a shopwalker-at all. There was nothing to
justify that suspicion. He had absolutely
no tricks of the trade whatever. It was
only that he passed the cream with his
usual grave politeness, very gently, very
sweetly.
We went into the lounge, and the brown
young man still talked brilliantly, and T
still continued to listen to him with delight
and to secretly turn over in my mind the
ever-deepening problem of Father.'
I knew now that it was really a problem.
Never once all through the evening had
any stray word suggested what Father’s
interests were. Apparently he had none.
And as time went on, I grew more and more
baffled. I almost decided he was a scientist,
a man of such deep knowledge that he kept
it all to himself among ordinary mortals like
ourselves. Always gentle, always grave,
he placed a cushion behind me, gave his
wife a footstool, handed round the brown
sugar for the coffee, always gentle,, always
gravely smiling a smile that was yet not
exactly quite a smile, if you know what
I mean. But how can you? I didn’t know
myself until just before I was coming away.
He was called to the telephone while I
was putting my hat on, and he spoke softly
in the hall to somebody.
I tried not to listen, but his voice was
so low, so clear, so like a reading of the
Bible (it flashed on me now) that I could
not help but catch his gentle words.
“Yes, marble,” he was saying. “No, that
land is worth more. Marble, yes. The hus-
band will call. They rang me. They want
the angel, not the cross.”
And then I understood.
Poor Father!
His occupation was one that could never
be allowed to enter into mortal conversation.

Vitality comes this
simple way
TIRED-OUT with constant pain 1 Back
breaking, limbs like pieces of lead, head-
ache, tragic daily torture making you look
so old—wouldn’t it be glorious to end this
misery and throw away the age-giving
mask of pain ?
The cause of your trouble is told in two words—
Kidney Trouble. The kidneys are failing to purify
the blood. Poisons are accumulating which cause
dreadful pain and suffering.
You will never regain health, youthful vigour
and vitality until you have prompted the kidneys to
healthy action. The best and quickest means to this

Babberton.
BY MERVYN SKIPPER.
EVERYBODY- liked Babberton, the super-
intendent, although he was a.bundle of
undisciplined emotions. ITe was a big
man, six foot three, with a rectangular red
face which gleamed like another sun under
his topee. He had large red hands on the
ends of long muscular arms which swung
restlessly from immense square shoulders, lie
had a roaring laugh and a loud voice and a
vocabulary of about 400 words, at least 200
of which were swear words. The women
liked him as much as did the men, and only
laughed when he was comically unable to
express himself politely. His Malay vocabu-
lary was even more limited than his English
and was equally rich in expletives. He
played tennis with amazing fury, and in the
punai season blew more of the graceful green
pigeons to pieces than any other gun on the
island. He had been a bottlc-a-day man
ever since anybody could remember, but at
51 he had a steadier eye and hand than
many a youngster fresh from London.
Although it was against the policy of the
company to keep a man at the same station
for more than a single term he had returned
to Pulau Anu after each successive furlough
for 14 years, so that he had passed through
all the various stages of promotion in the
one station. He had started as a bachelor
operator, and when he was promoted to clerk-
in-charge had obtained permission to remain
in the bachelor quarters on the ground that
he could not afford to live in single state in
the married quarters. When he became
superintendent, however, he was obliged to
remove into the house provided for the pur-
pose.
It was a big house set in a dense garden,
and five lethargic native servants went with
it. Babberton was seldom to be found in it.
He said it gave him the horrors. In the
evenings, at gin-and-bitters time, his loud
laugh could be heard ringing across the island
from the D.O.’s verandah, from the house of
the Government Resident or from the cable
quarters.
There were six of us in quarters—like
Babberton, all bachelors. The company did
not approve of married men under the rank
of clerk-in-charge, a rank which few of us
expected to attain to in our present incar-
nation. Married men cost money. They
requii'e separate houses. They have a dis-
tressing habit of begetting children. Wives
and families fall ill and require sending
home or transferring to sanatoria in Java
or Sumatra. Then there is the long leave
after each period of service, with first-class
passages paid both ways to station of en-
gagement. Camp followers embarrass an
army which is fighting for the dividends of
shareholders on these far-flung battlefronts
of Empii’e. Anybody who married without
permission ran the risk of instant dismissal.
On the question of marriage Babberton
was a company’s man—it was about the only
* on which he did agree with London.
YY hue he lived with us m quarters and a
s i nke li—a new man from London—arrived
he would corrupt his morals methodically,
painstakingly, brutally, until the youth
became ashamed of being called a mother’s
darling. Babberton roared with laughter
when Greenleigh, a. kid of IS, was fathered
on us by London. Greenleigh was innocent
and would talk wistfully about a girl he
had become engaged to before coming on
foreign service.
“Why don’t you take a photograph of your
beloved,” said Babberton, “and place it over
t h e f ace 0 f a native mistress?”
Greenleigh flushcd a t the obscene suggesf-
but s ß aid not hing. Babberton laughed
i •,
,
Look at me . he shouted. ‘ls there any-
thing wrong with me? I’m not married but
I enjoy all the real delights of matrimony
none of the responsibilities. As tor
children, I ve just heard for the sixth time
that 1 m an uncle again. And he laughed
at hl « l okc and repeated it uproariously,
After occupying the superintendent’s
house for three years Babberton went on
leave. Halt, the clerk-in-cliargc, acted in his
absence. It was the end of the dry season,
and just after Babberton left, a bush fire
broke out and swept the settlement. It
threatened the hospital and the doctor’s
house, nearly burnt down Marton’s and sent
huge sparks over the atap roof of the quar-
ters. We were saved from complete extinction
by Chomleigh, the police inspector, who fell
on- the fire with his Sikhs and fought it for
24 hours. It left- all our end of the island
a dismal waste of brown leaves and charred
tree trunks.
The vvet _ season that followed was the
worst in living memory. It rained for
three months almost without ceasing. Then
everybody went down with fever. A
newcomer to the island brought it all the
way from the East Coast of Africa. Mrs.
Halt got it worst of all and, in view of her
condition, we agreed to drink, warm whiskies
so that she could have the ice which came
fortnightly from Singapore for our ice-chest,
By the time the epidemic was over you could
have blown the lot of us across a room with
a small bellows.
It is a terrifying sensation to find your
teeth chattering and your limbs sliak-
ing, and feel as. cold as if you -were stand-
ing in an icy wind on the brink of a bleak
promontory, while outside the flowers are
fainting and the dogs have crawled into the
shade out of the heat of noonday. You drink
something hot and crawl under several
blankets and don’t perspire a drop. You take
quinine, and after an hour or two the sweat
begins to break out on you. You hear fiery
cannonades in your ears, dead silences,
sudden cracklings of the universe, and anon
you begin to think you dream or dream you
think the weirdest concatenations of events.
You find quinine recalls that youthful faculty
most children have of being able to call up
at will the image of anything that happens
to cross the mind; you review a royal pro-
cession of lions and tigers and gazekas
enough to stock a circus; long-forgotten
faces.
The fever is bad enough. Convalescence
in a place like Pulau Anu was immeasurably
worse. There was nowhere you could get
away from yourself. You found you hated
everybody in quarters with an unreasoning
hatred. You started silly feuds with, your
next-door neighbor and continued them in the
office. You went for walks in the charred
bush, from which the birds and butterflies
had been able to escape if you hadn’t. _ If
'you saw another European resident coming
you stepped off the path and hid to avoid
him and you returned dreary and tired witli
your white clothes all striped, as if the bush
had been trying to draw a caricature of its
charred misery upon you. Christmas was
approaching, and we always tried to be extra
jolly at Christmas, but it. seemed as if this
year the effort would be beyond us. All the
vitality seemed to have been drained out
of us.
She came down the gangway of the Ckow-
fah, her small body in cool blue relieved
against the white ducks on the great bulk
of the grinning Babberton, who walked
behind her. “Mrs. Babberton!” We could
hardly believe our ears, much less our eyes.
Babberton had kept his secret well. He liked
creating a sensation. We shook hands awk-
wardly with what seemed to us Hie most
amazing apparition that had ever visited the
island. Then we all stood silent, staring
at her. At last somebody suggested a bul-
lock-cart, the only mode of conveyance,
except a few decrepit rickshaws, on the
island. She jumped up on the cart, letting
her silk-stockinged legs swing over the tail
of it. We tramped along behind on the three-
mile walk to the settlement, surreptitiously
taking peeps at the swinging ankles.
An umbrella had been the cause of it.
Babberton had emerged from his hotel in
Russell-square, looked at the sky and decided
that rain threatened. He went back for his
umbrella. Then he walked to the Museum
and got on top of a ’bus to go to the city. A
girl was the only other occupant. It began
to rain and he offered her the shelter of the
umbrella. She accepted without self-con-
sciousness. He looked more closely at her
and.liked her. By the time they had gone a
couple of blocks ho had told her, in his ex-
pansive way, who he was and where he had
come from. She told him she was a typist
in a lawyer’s office and lived in lodgings with
her mother. She said she had always been
interested in the tropics.
“What are they really like?” she asked.
He had never thought about it. He
knitted his brows and tried to remember.
But lie had never been able to visualise an
environment.
“No place for a white woman,” he said
sententiously.
“But what are they like?” she persisted.
He stared at the drizzling November day.
The umbrella was dripping down liis neck.
Suddenly Pulau Anu appeared to be infinitely
desirable. Pie began to tell her about the
East. But the East he unfolded was the
silken East of Kipling,- of the last moving-
picture he had seen and of the last roman-
tic novel he had read. Quite innocently he
warmed to his theme and sincerely thought
he was picturing a reality. By the time they
had got to the Bank Pulau Anu had been
transformed into an isle of dreams, of
pleasant odors, a lotus Paradise, perpetual
afternoon.
lie met her several times again, took her
to the theatre and was invited to her lodg-
ings to meet her mother, a faded woman
without personality. She accepted him with-
out emotion as her daughter’s lover.
They were married a week later —the day
before the boat sailed for Singapore, two
days before her nineteenth birthday.
Mrs. Babberton’s arrival put new life into
the. settlement. All the four other married
women gave dinners and dances. 'There was
a ball at the Residency. Bathurst, the har-
bormaster, got drunk a week before Christ-
mas and remained drunk for a week after-
wards.
The first magical impression of Mrs.
Babberton’s beauty and freshness remained
with us long after we had accepted the
reality without seeing it. Actually she was
not remarkable for beauty, though there was
something arresting about her. She had an
upright, self-contained figure, with narrow
hips and high breasts, and she had a calm
objective way of scrutinising every man who
approached her. Her eyes looked straight
at you with a calm, detached interest, and
her lips were always slightly parted in a
smile that might or might not have been
sarcastic. Her moist black hair fell as if
it were wet in a lank straight line from a
central parting and was caught in a stiff
knot at the nape of her neck. All her emo-
tions seemed to mingle in and right them-
selves through her quiet grey eyes, and her
hands were always falling into the most
graceful positions. They looked as if they
would always be content to be idle. Her
body seemed to be utterly unaware of any
climatic change in coming to the tropics.
As far as the men were concerned she was
as near our English ideal as we could expect
to get. She swung her long legs out athletic-
ally as she walked and swayed her pretty
body at each step she took. Nothing could
have been more feminine to our starved
minds. The women hated her one and all.
Those who feared her most called her
“poor Ethel,” and said what a shame it was
that such an innocent young thing should
have been fooled into marriage with such an
old sybarite as Babberton.
But was she fooled? Probably she never
believed his fairy stories about the tropics at

all. Perhaps she had said to herself, as she
looked out on the grey world of London, that
anything would be better than it, and that
there were a million surplus women in Eng-
land. She settled down in the big superin-
tendent’s bungalow and proved herself a
practical manager. Babberton was childishly
delighted with her. He talked about his
married state with an unsophisticated ardor,
as if he had invented matrimony.
Their verandah became a rendezvous for
all the island. We went there before dinner
and drank Babberton’s gin pahits and ate
Mrs. Babberton’s devilled almonds and argued
dogmatically about the British elections and
less dogmatically about local politics. The
wet season passed and the dry season came
again and Babberton’s inexplicable and envi-
able piece of luck merged imperceptibly into
Mrs. Babberton, wife of the superintendent.
With the coming of the dry season, Bab-
berton’s attitude towards his wife began to
change. His violent gaiety altered to a
taciturnity which seemed equally violent. He
would relapse into long silences,; during
which he stared at his wife intently. Nature
was bursting into blossom everywhere. The
green was beginning to triumph over the
brown and black even in the burnt-out
secondary jungle surrounding the settlement.
Mrs. Halt was nearing her time. Bo was
the station water buffalo.
One day in the office, while Babberton
was bending over an instrument, somebody
made a reference to his being made an uncle.
Babberton never altered his pose, but a few
minutes later he turned on Halt and asked
him what the hell he had been doing with
the instrument. Everybody was astonished.
Halt was an efficient officer and his rela-
tions with Babberton had always been affec-
tionate. From then on Babberton began to
persecute Halt in the office and pointedly
ignore him outside it. He took to wearing
rubbers and he would suddenly appear in
the instrument room at a time when he usu-
ally took his afternoon siesta. If Halt
had taken the opportunity to have a snooze
himself Babberton would overwhelm him
with profanity.
He became morbidly puritanical. At night
he would roam around the quarters with a
lantern and accost any native woman he
found entering it. He would ask the
frightened girl whom she was going to, and
then would drive her out of the compound
with dire threats of what lie would do to
her if she ever put her nose inside it again.
As a bachelor it had nevdr occurred to
him to doubt his own prepotency. His rela-
tions with his native mistresses had never
been such as to bring the matter into his
consciousness. It never occurred to him now
to consider his own responsibility in the
matter, but he felt that all the settlement
was watching him. He knew, or thought
he 'knew, exactly how they would be talking
about him in quarters. Every gust of laugh-
ter that came on the still evenings from
that direction filled him with nervous irri-
tation. One night he went into the bed-
room, whither his wife had preceded him,
and began to revile her. Her calm gaze
and the sweet reasonableness of her answers
only served to madden him further. He
could hardly keep his twitching hands off
her.
_He took to going for long walks into the
Kadayan country, where he Would engage
in long and earnest conversations with the
old men and women of the villages. When
lie returned he would talk to his wife about
the native superstitions and their primitive
medicine. Perhaps, after all, there might
be something in them. Then one night lie
shamefacedly mentioned to his wife a
remedy he had been given for her condition.
She listened quietly and agreed to try it
in a matter-of-fact way that astonished and
calmed him. Nothing happened, however,
although he changed the recipe several
times.
On the night of the day that Mrs. Halt
had a happy delivery Babberton had a tre-
mendous row with Halt on his own veran-
dah. We all sat silent and uneasy, only
Mrs. Babberton retaining her serenity.
When she went to bed he followed her, tore
the mosquito net to pieces and raved round
the room, looking for an excuse for re-
criminations. Then his eye fell on a, letter.
It was in the familiar flowing handwriting
of a telegraphist, and he snatched it up and
began to read it. It was from young Green-
leigh, who had had successive attacks of
malaria and had been granted sick leave to.
-the mountain resort of Kintamani in Bali.
Mrs. Babberton had mothered or sistered
the youth. His engagement to a girl who
came from the same country as Mrs. Bab-
berton. gave them a common topic of con-
versation. It was a perfectly innocent
letter. On his way to Bali Greenleigh had
passed through Java, and he descanted en-
thusiastically on the beauty and interest of
that island. He mentioned that at Batavia
he had seen a cannon of ancient Dutch
manufacture which was said to have magi-
cal properties. Native women and even
European ladies visited it when they wanted
to have children.
Babberton stopped when his eye fell on
this passage. He flung the letter down and.
with a morose glance at his wife, walked
out of the room; but presently lie returned,
picked up the letter and re-read the passage.
“The youngster writes a good letter,” he
said at length.
“Yes,” said Mrs. Babberton.
“This cannon,” said Babberton. “I’ve
heard of it. Every damn tourist goes am,
stares at it. It’s all damn native moon-
shine, of course.”
“Still, you never know,” said Mrs. Bab-
berton calmly.
“Damn rot,” said Babberton. “A cannon !”
“It mightn’t be.” said Mrs. Babberton.
“Why shouldn’t I try it? I’ll have to go to
Singapore soon to see a dentist anyhow.
I could go on to Batavia and be back in c
month at latest.”
“No,” said Babberton. “It doesn’t seem
decent. Not after a lot of blasted niggers.”
“Nobody will know,” said Mrs. Babberton.
“No,” said Babberton, and he began try-
ing to string the damaged mosquito curtain
together.
He slipped off his trousers and put on f.
sarong. Then he got in beside his wife and
“We’ll talk about it in the morning,” he
said as he composed himself for sleep.
Babberton became himself again as soon
as his wife sailed for Singapore to see the
dentist. His loud laugh once more re-
sounded from the Resident’s house and from
the quarters verandah. He got his gun out
again and started blowing punai to pieces
with his old intensity. He became warmly
affectionate to Halt, made a violent fuss
of the baby and sent his boys over almost
hourly with jellies and custards for the
mother. He began bantering the three new
men we had in quarters, whom he called
the Foolish Virgins.
In due course Mrs. Babberton returned.
We were all down on the wharf to. meet the
boat, as usual. Babberton stood staring up
at his wife with a curious intensity. She
nodded her pretty head at him and laughed
gaily. When the gangway was down Bab-
berton went up it in three bounds and em-
braced his wife violently. His high spirits
were infectious. Mrs. Babberton’s return
was as great an occasion as her first arrival.
Bathurst, the harbormaster, was drunk for
three weeks afterwards.
By the boat which brought Mrs. Babber-
ton came a letter for me from Greenleigh.
He had always made me his confidant.
“It was pretty dull at Kinthmani,” he wrote.
“The restliouse overlooks the crater of Batur.
The crater is 40 miles across and is extinct,
but there is an active volcano rising out of
the old bottom. There was nothing to look
at but the mist and the lava and I was
the only guest until w r ho do you think
arrived? Mrs. B.! You could have knocked
me over with a feather. Said she had been
to the dentist at Singapore and as there
was a Paketvaart boat sailing for Buleleng
she thought it was a chance to see some-
thing of the place, but not to say anything
about it. She didn’t want to let her hubby
know she wasn’t satisfied with life on Pulau
Anu.
“We went for walks along the top of the
crater, and one evening she said, ‘What
about scrambling down into it?’ There is
a village at the bottom. The natives are
all priests and the rest of the island pays
them to shout up prayers and incantations
to keep the devil of the volcano from slop-
ping lava all over the island. Well, down
we climbed. Mrs. B. is a sport all right.
She made nothing of it, though it was pretty
heavy going. Well, we got so interested
in a dance the natives were doing that
night was on us before we knew where we
were. Well, the headman said it was hope-
less trying to get out in the dark and he
gave us shake-downs—me on the verandah
and Mrs. B. in the best bedroom.
“Blest if the devil in the . volcano didn’t
select that night to get nasty. He slopped
over to some purpose. You could see the
lava creeping down the mountain like the
dragon the Chinese light inside on their
New Year. The house was rocking on its
legs like old Bathurst when he is extra
drunkish. Well, I was sitting up looking at
the dragon and trying to stop, myself from
rolling off the baleh-baleh when Mrs. B.
came out. She was steady as a rock, but
she said if she had to die she preferred to
die without the headman’s roof on top of
her. So we both sat on the baleh-baleh,
watching the lava getting nearer. The natives
were down below in the square, howling
and dancing and shaking lances and bows
and arrows at the dragon, but it didn’t stop
until, it reached the temple—one of those
queer pagoda affairs, like a pile of hats.
“We saw it by its own light push the
pagoda out of the perpendicular, and then it
stopped and the natives yelled louder than
ever and said it wa.s a miracle. Well, all this
time we sat on the baleh-baleh. and we started
to talk, and I got to know Mrs. B. better
then I’ve ever known any woman. Her life’s
hell with the Old Man, worse than anything
we’ve imagined. It quietened down at last
and we got back to the resthouse for break-
fast.”
He finished by imploring me not to say
anything about it. “Not that it matters,”
he wrote, “but you know what the Old Man
is when he gets his knife into you.”
Greenleigh did not come back to Pulau
Anu. Mrs. Babberton casually dropped the
remark, that his presence irritated her. With
the prospect o£ becoming a father before
him, Babberton was ready to grant his wife
anything. He wrote to Singapore suggesting
to the district manager that Greenleigh’s
constitution was unfitted for the climate of
Pulau Anu. so he was sent direct to China.
Mrs. Babberton was a practical woman.
Ballad.
They wont out walking over the tops of the
hills,
Where the eliill clouds walk and the live wind
shrieks and shrills ;
And he was silent, and she who wandered
beside
Said “Love me awhile”; but he laughed and
suddenly cried
“The hills are green and the grass is wet
to-day.
“So blow, wind! Blow, wind! Blow my
cares away.”
They stood on the ridge and the grey-haired
rain came over.
And the maid came close and took the hand
of her lover.
“Though the hills are high,” she said, “and
the way is wet.
Rememborine what has been you must love
me yet.”
But he laughed like a startled bird and
nought would say
Save “Blow, wind! Blow, wind! Blow my
cares away.”
So she ran swiftly over the hills, and down
To the quiet ways and the peace of the little
town;
And married a decent man who knew her
worth,
And who never cried out with horrible, windy
mirth;
“The hills are green and the grass is wet
to-day.
So blow, wind ! Blow, wind ! Blow my love
away.”


Essex Car Makes
Astounding
Beauty Record.
ORIGINAL FINISH LIKE
NEW AFTER 100,000 MILES.
Mr. F. Yott, a prominent Melbourne
business man, purchased a standard
model Essex Sedan from Neals
Motors Pty., Ltd., on the 31st Aug.,
1928, and on its fourth birthday
drove it to the agents for their in-
spection. Mr. H. J. Lane, director
of Neals Motors, Hudson Essex
Agents, writes as follows:
“Essex Sedan Reg. No. 93071 was
delivered new August 31, 1928, and
after inspection to-day we were
surprised to find the original duco
in extraordinarily good condition-
equal to new. To our knowledge
this car has travelled over 100,000
miles, including 10 trips to Sydney
and back, twice to both Canberra
and Adelaide and back, and has fol-
lowed reliability tests and 24-hours’
trials as official car. The only atten>
tion it has received to maintain the
duco finish in such condition was
periodical Simonizing.”
Motor Cars, Furniture, Radios,
Refrigerators, Pianos and All
Objects with a fine Finish
Can Now Be Kept Beautiful,
There’s nothing finer than Simoniz for
furniture. It makes furniture look new.
And keeps it' that way. Further, keeping
any Simonized surface bright and spot-
lessly clean is the easiest thing in the
world.
Simoniz protects the delicate finish of fur-
niture in the same mighty way that it
does automobile finishes. Simoniz is made
to withstand outdoor exposure and the
constant wear and tear an automobile
finish gets. 1 hat’s why Simoniz is so
excellent in protecting furniture from
scratching and marring.
And Simoniz on a car lasts for months.
On furniture it lasts much longer, of
course.
How to SIMONIZ Furniture
Simoniz your furniture in much the same
way you Simoniz your car. That is, use
the Simoniz Kleener to restore the natural
lustre of the finish. It takes off all dis-
colorations and the oily scum left by
dust-collecting polishes previously used.
It really makes the finish like new by
removing surface scratches, stains, blem-
ishes and the like.
Next apply the Simoniz, Then a few light
strokes with a soft cloth and your furni-
ture looks bright and just like new again.

The Simoniz forms a hard, lustrous sur-
face to which dirt and dust can’t stick.
To keep it clean just wipe dust off with a
dry cloth. No polishing is necessary. It’s
positively the easiest and best way ever
heard of to keep furniture looking beauti-
ful all the time.
Th ere are dozens of other uses for Simoniz
and Simoniz Kleener around the house.
Simoniz Kleener is excellent for cleaning
glass and pewter. And there’s nothing
like Simoniz for linoleum and hardwood |
floors, woodwork, refrigerators, gas stoves
and the like. In fact, anything with a fine
finish needs Simoniz. Enamel, lacquer,
varnish and duco finishes last much longer
and stay beautiful if you keep them pro-
tected with Simoniz.

SIMONIZ
YOUR CAR
It Makes the Finish
Last Longer
Don’t be surprised when people stop and admire your car after
you Simoniz it. Its rich, sparkling beauty will attract every
eye. Those who don’t know that Simoniz lasts for months
will wonder how it’s possible to keep a car so bright and new
looking ALL THE TIME.
Year after year, in all countries of the world, and in all possible
climatic conditions, Simoniz keeps millions of cars beautiful.
It protects the finish in all kinds of weather, makes it last longer
and keeps colors from fading.
Simoniz is the recognised modem and scientific way to keep
cars beautiful. Nothing could be easier, quicker or safer. So
don’t experiment. Always use Simoniz Kleener (green tin)
to clean the finish. It restores the original lustre with amazing

Good Car Painters
RECOMMEND THIS
METHOD TO PRESERVE
THE FINISH
Simoniz imparts a hard, lustrous film
of protection which prevents the
finish “blooming” from exposure.
Good painters know this and always
Simoniz their good paint jobs to make
them look their best and to make
the finish last longer. Any experi-
enced painter will tell you that the
duco on a car which has been regu-
larly Simonized is in far better con-
dition than those which have
received any other treatment.
With a Simonized car you only have
to wipe down with benzol, which
easily removes all Simoniz, before
respraying with lacquer.

“NOT HOW CHEAP”
BUT “HOW GOOD”
Quality rather than price has
always been the guiding prin-
ciple of the House of Gilbey.
Gilbey’s Dry Gin, owing to its
tonic and warming properties,
is a splendid Winter drink.
Taken hot with lemon and
sugar it’s one of the finest
preventatives for incipient colds
and chills.
