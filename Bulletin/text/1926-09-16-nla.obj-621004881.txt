The Red PAge
The Riot of Education
It was confidently predicted when W. E.
Forster introduced his Education Bill some-
where about 1870 that Britain was at the
dawn of a new era. When the masses had
learned to read and write and cipher, it was
said with absolute cocksureness, all the gates
of knowledge would be open, and tyranny and
misrule would write their closing chapter.
“The power,” said Forster, “is in their
hands. It is now our duty to educate our
masters.” To-day England, Canada and
Australia spend enormous sums in education.
How different from those benighted days
when three times more was devoted to the
upkeep of the royal stables than was spent
in Britain on the public instruction of the
nation! Let us examine the situation and
see how far the noble expectations of the
Forsters have been realised.
Always all over this continent high schools,
grammar schools and other secondary educa-
tional institutions are in course of enlarge-
ment or erection. Scholarship systems also
are being periodically extended so that the
opportunity of climbing into a “soft job”
may be open to all who feel they are fitted
only for soft jobs. Every now and again
some Socialist enthusiast or some • Tory co-
worker rises in Parliament and suggests,
amid approving murmurs, that the school age
should be raised to 16 or 18, while some more
rabid comrade of the Left announces boldly
that he would not allow any boy to leave
school before he had reached the age of 20.
“Progress,” we are told —“this is progress!”
But is it ? Is a process that encourages
book-learning, literacy, classical or mathema-
tical study of more importance to the nation
than efficient carpentry, blacksmithing, ship-
building, sheep-raising, management of
machines or agriculture? Do we need more
teachers, professors, lawyers and clerics or
more skilled husbandmen and artisans? And
which class are we turning out in our second-
ary schools? Not one boy out of five who
is “finished off” in these superior academies
desires to be anything but a black-coated
worker. And the system in vogue is largely
responsible for this perversion.
I have had some experience in these
matters, and I doubt if more than 10 per
cent, of the pupils in an ordinary primary
school has any capacity for the so-called
“higher education.” Intellectual boys are
uncommon, but boys deft of hand, active and
adaptable, are to be found in great numbers.
The modern educational system packs these
youngsters, dull, bright, backward and ordi-
nary, into a class and bids them make a
uniform progress towards a common goal.
If the bright ones lag and the dullards have
to be driven, so much the better, provided
uniformity is maintained. The aim is, appa-
rently, to make scholars out of everybody—
a patent impossibility.
When peddling politicians raise the cry,
"Lift the school age. Give every child an
opportunity to climb from the gutter to the
university”—they forget the most important
fact, that a big majority of young people
have little, if any, desire to rise to giddy
heights. They don’t want strenuous days
and studious nights. They hate responsi-
bility and would rather have a steady job
at a moderate wage than the worry of over-
sight and supervision. With this clasps, when
a good grounding in the “three It’s” is
completed, with some knowledge of history
and geography, the time spent inside the
schoolroom is largely wasted. The work-
shop, the factory, the station, the orchard or
the field should be the next step in their
training, not the superior academy. What
is more pitiful than to see a youngster of
16 or 17, who might be getting a valuable
trade training, being stuffed with scraps of
languages and ’ologies which he will promptly
slough off the moment he leaves the cram-
ming den ! Even if he be somewhat intel-
lectual, the so-called professions are badly
overcrowded, and there is ample room for
brains outside. Australia complains, with
good cause, that she has too many civil ser-
vants. But this plethora is largely due to
an educational system that is simply a ladder
to an office-desk. I say without hesitation
that for 90 per cent, of our boys and girls
the time passed at grammar schools and high
schools is spent in breeding a public mis-
chief. And all classes are infected with
the delusion that this foolishness makes for
Progress.
For years now Britain has been losing
her industrial supremacy at the same time
that her secondary and higher schools have
been increasing and multiplying. Who and
what built up that supremacy? The brains
developed in the foundry, the shipyard, the
factory, the mines, the planning office and the
great mercantile establishments. It is in
these places that the real education of life
is accomplished. The veritable education
commences when the school period termi-
nates, and an extension of this period in the
vast majority of cases is a pure futility. Even
for office work the system is in no wise
successful. Ask a business man whether he
would rather take into his offices a boy
of 14, fresh from the State school or a young-
man of 16 or 18 with two or three years’
superior-school education on his shoulders,
and he will nearly always tell you he pre-
fers the former. The younger boy is more
adaptable, less conceited, more alert to learn
and more pliable. The older one is often
A bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,
With loads of learned lumber in his head.
It is not education as a principle that is
at fault; it is that we are tied up to the
wrong kind of education. A boy may be a
hater of books, but he may have in him the
makings of a fine builder, a splendid artisan
or a capable navigator. Why, then, dub
him a dunce because he cannot pass purely
literary examinations? Our superior-school
methods are undermining the efficiency of
the race under a most appalling delusion.
This does not mean that the intellectual
minority should not have its academies and
universities, but that the majority should pass
at a ductile and docile age into the spheres
for which Providence has fitted them. All
else is a mere grinding of wind and a waste
of energy.
India presents a fine, example of the mis-
chief wrought by our mistaken methods.
Hindoos come into a college or university
run on Western lines, pass a few years there,
get plucked or win a degree, and then imagine
the . State should find them Government
billets. Disappointed in this aspiration,
the hapless babus turn agitators’and clamor
for revolution. It sounds foolish, of course,
but such is the natural outcome of the edu-
cational. system foisted upon them. And *we
don't need to go as far as India to discover
much of the same kind of thing and a kin-
dred evil resulting. The school may be a
great blessing—or a great mischief;
P. AIREY.
The Best-Seller
Human nature is very much like any other
form of nature. When the earth is wounded,
torn, scarred in any way, Nature, with
tremendous optimism, sets to work to heal,
to cover, to hide. She hates the barren, the
ugly. It is the same with man. The earth-
quake destroys his city and immediately he
sets to work to build a liner city on the old
site. The waste lands of his town he turns
into lawns and parks. Around his house
he plants a garden. Also he dreams. Cir-
cumstances may push him down and down,
but in his dreams he rises again. However
little and unimportant he may be in real
life, in his dreams he is always a somebody.
He is the hero of his dreams.
Man is a being of numerous sides, and
every side makes a more or less pronounced
appeal. Men differ according to the varying
strengths of their different appealing sides.
But there are sides that are more or less
common to the majority of men. These
sides make up a popular demand. They give
a base for a popular dream-form. One such
side is the sentimental. We are most of us
emotional; and if we give free rein to our
emotions and our dreams, then for the time
being the logical side of us is submerged.
Then the sentimental comes into its own. We
weep and laugh ; are sad and glad. In our
dreams we do not make ourselves successful
at first. We put our dreamselves up against
things, and struggle and suffer that the:
eventual victory for our dreamselves will be
worth while. We harrow our feelings, inflict
pain upon ourselves, so that with the relief
from the pain will come pleasure—the
pleasure that Schopenhauer defined as the
negation of pain.
But, as a dreamer, sometimes man is
lazy, sometimes incapable. Then he looks
about for ready-made dreams. The best-
seller provides him with just such a ready-
made dream and a dream-hero. He slips
his dream-self into the body of that dream-
hero, lives gloriously, suffers, struggles, is
baffled and beaten, but in the end wins. For
a while the everyday, near-by real is for-
gotten, _ far-away. And the best-seller must
approximate more or less to the majority’s
commonest dream form. A study of best-
sellers will quickly enough reveal that senti-
mentality is common to them all. In her
book “The Modern Novel; Some Aspects of
Contemporary Fiction,” Elizabeth A. Drew
writes of A. S. M. Hutchinson’s “sincerely
sentimental mind,” and Michael A r leu's
“cynically sentimental mind.” To these one
might add P. C. Wren and describe his mind
as the romantically-youthful sentimental.
Probably the only book ever published in
Australia that would come under the heading
of a best-seller is C. J. Dennis’s ‘’Sentimental
Bloke.” This book and “If Winter Comes”
and “The Green Hat” and “Beau Geste” in
their subject matter and character description
are totally unlike, and yet they all make
a like sentimental appeal. They stir us
more or less emotionally—take us to the
depths and the heights, make us sad and
glad, just in the way certain popular music
does.
All best-sellers deal with the unknown
and the unfamiliar. They have this in com-
mon. It is no use trying to idealise and
sentimentalise for us what we know. The
best-seller's illusion ary world must be based
on the unknown. It must not deal with the
commonplace people such as the majority of
best-seller readers live amongst, nor with
commonplace suburban villas such as those
wherein most of them dwell. “The Senti-
mental Bloke,” “The Green Hat,” “Beau
Geste,” “If Winter Comes” all deal with
places and people we do not know. There-
fore they might be true. At least there is no
familiarity about them to keep whispering as
we read : “How absurd !. ... How untrue !”
Dennis deals with larrikins in Little Bourke-
street, and Arlen with night-club habitues
in Mayfair. Wren makes his heroes live out
their strenuous days with the French
Foreign Legion in the Sahara. These people
and scenes are all remote from most of us.
Therefore for most of us their illusion cau
endure. But it would be surprising to hear
of a real legionaire getting much pleasure
out of “Beau Geste,” just as surprising as
it would be to hear of a real larrikin get-
ting pleasure out of “The Sentimental
Bloke,” or a real night-club habitug getting
pleasure out of “The Green Hat.” Dennis,
in “The Sentimental Bloke,” too, idealises
and sentimentalises the life of honest toil.
Edward Fitzgerald, in another best-seller,
“Omar Khayyam,” idealised and sentimental-
ised a life that was not one of honest toil.
Dennis paints the life on the land as all
moonlight and sunsets, and mopokes calling
along the creek, and thrushes singing, and the
sweet smells of the earth. People who toil
on the land know that there is a lot more
in it than this. Then Omar, following out
his eat, drink and make merry philosophy,
found life all purple skies and green gardens
and roses and nightingales. People who live
that sort of life would scoff at Omar. But
for the majority who do not know by ex-
perience, such modes of life might lead to
such states and things. As illusion-bases
for the best-seller they suffice.
The best-seller writer must be able to
write picturesquely and brilliantly. People
who would decry all best-sellers simply be-
come absurd when they say that men like
those mentioned above cannot write. Hut-
chinson writes brilliantly, and “The Green
Hat” is worth reading if for nothing else
but the brilliant vignettes of people and
places and things with which it abounds.
Another thing that all best-seller writers

have in common is their inability to write more
than one real best-seller. Hutchinson has never
produced another “If Winter Comes,” nor
Arlen another “Green Hat.” Dennis has
done only one “Sentimental Bloke.” Black-
more never wrote anything that in any way
approached in popularity “Lorna Doone,”
and were it not for her “Story of an African
Farm” Olive Schreiner would be unknown.
It seems to be much the same with those
who correspond to best-sellers amongst
the musicians. Bizet composed only one
“Carmen,” Gounod only one “Faust,” Lehar
only one “Merry Widow.” It just seems as
if once in a lifetime the best-seller writer is
given an inspired glimpse into the inmost
beings of his fellow men. He hears the
common cry, the popular demand. And he
complies with it. If his work does not
always endure he gets something else by
way of reward. He has his day.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
“Mammonart”
Mammonart, by Upton Sinclair, is sub-
titled “an essay in economic interpretation.”
Wliat its appearance proves is that art
theses are reaching the masses. The thing
itself is significant. It will not hurt paint-
ers, poets, novelists, playwrights and com-
posers to have thrust upon them this imper-
tinent query : Who owns you, and why'?
Trotsky and Bogdanoff alike tell us that
“the workers must enter into their inheri-
tance of bourgeois culture.” They are not
alone in teaching that to secure an under-
standing of them, art and literature must be
viewed in their relation to social history.
Sinclair’s work projects into prominence the
controversial point that the artist does not
express spontaneously an inner necessity—
is not divinely inspired emotionally in a crea-
tive world—but is a social being perform-
ing a social function. Realists of our
thrilling times will be irresistibly interested
in the attempts to show the relation of the
artist to the propertied groups, with a fresh
light on the economic background of art.
It is true that Sinclair is not the pioneer
in the field of economic art-interpretation.
It is true that he is not the greatest in the
field. The Russian Pleclianov, long before
the Bolshevik revolution, built upon the
foundations laid by Marx and his contem-
porary Dietzgen. Labriola, of Italy, had pre-
ceded the anti-Leninite Russian. William
Morris, of England, in collaboration with the
stiU-alive Ernest Bax—a brilliant mind
which somehow has missed due recognition—
did valuable philosophical speculation. But
as “populariser” Sinclair is first and fore-
most, and his book in its scope is easily the
most comprehensive and ambitious of any
similar work. Considered merely as an “out-
line,” it is a thousand times more alive than
the Orpen-Drinkwater serial. And his
skill as muckraker, if you like, is nowhere
shown more arrestingly than in his “studies”
and “satires” of a hundred of the great ones of
his processional pageant. If you drop en-
tirely his theory you will not wish to avoid
the fascination of his vital discoveries and
views. The biographical details are fresh
and make rich “copy.” I am one who in
reading the whole three chapters experienced
the “pull” of a good mystery novel.
According to our author, Ogi, the son of
Og, one hundred thousand years ago be-
came Court painter. His art code serves as
a savage satire of certain cults:—
Ogi does not paint the thing as it really is; and
he does not paint the thing as he sees it. The
former he could not do, for lie does not know what
the thing really is; and the second he would consider
bad manners, bad morals and bad taste. Ogi paints
the thing as he thinks it ought to be; or, more
commonly, he paints the thing as he thinks other
people ought to think it to be.
The work discusses “six great art lies now
prevailing in the world.” These are, briefly,
the art for art’s sake lie; the notion that
art is something esoteric, for the few, out-
side the grasp of the masses ; the lie of art-
tradition, or learning from the classics ; the
notion that art is entertainment and diver-
sion, as escape from reality (“the true pur-
pose of art is to alter reality”) ; the notion
that art has nothing to do with moral ques-
tions ; the notion that art excludes propa-
ganda and has nothing to do with freedom
and justice. Sinclair says that all art is
propaganda, universally and inescapably;
“the absence of propaganda in the art
of a people means that this people is in pro-
cess of intellectual and moral decay.” Tak-
ing Flaubert’s formula, “the form is the
parent of the idea,” Sinclair’s criticism is
that “you first think of a beautiful way to
say something, and then you think of some-
thing to say which can be said in that way.
It would be impossible for art perversity
to go farther.”
Of Virgil, Spencer, Shakspeare, Racine,
Goethe, Tennyson, Sinclair says “they feel
love and pity for the unhappy children of
their brains, and they move us to grief and
awe, but never do they move us to revolt.”
Again, of Shakspeare, for whose ideas he
has scant courtesy:—■
This man was gifted with the most marvellous
tongue that has yet appeared on earth. Golden,
glowing, gorgeous words poured out of him at a
moment’s notice all his life; he covered everything
he wrote with the glamor of poetry. This gift was
his fortune; but also it was a trap, because it
saved him the need of thinking. It is a trap for
us, because it tempts us into sharing his emotions
without thinking.
Our author is nothing if not irreverently
iconoclastic. Samuel Richardson is “the
first old woman.” Thackeray is “the col-
lector of snobs,” Swinburne “the inspired
parrakeet,” Tennyson “the lullaby laureate.”
Moliere, Voltaire, Tolstoy and the Russians,
Dickens, Browning, Emerson and so on are
characterised as intriguing, with defences
of Shelley, Zola and others in the grand
manner. The seamy side of art and artists
is not suppressed by Sinclair: you get from
him unsavory items few others tell you, and
certainly never tell the mob. If “Mammon-
art” fails theoretically or aesthetically it is
strong in the historic field. It is held that
Dante indulged in muckraking—his pilgrim-
age through Hell w T as to justify St. Peter’s
declaration that each of two Popes “has of
my cemetery made a sewer of blood and
filth.” A review of the work of Wilde leads
to the assertion that in the British public
schools “they are fed upon Greek literature
and art, which glorifies homosexuality, and
therefore English upper-class life is rotten
with this odious vice.” Of the American
David Graham Phillips it is affirmed that
“he wrote the biggest piece of American fic-
tion of his time” ; but “Susan Lenox” is ‘a
middle-class story”—an idealisation of pros-
titution. Sinclair objects because Susan pre-
serves her beauty—doesn’t contract V.D.
While Jack London’s friends say of London’s
death “that the cause was a desire for two
women at the same time,” Sinclair says that
“the world-conquering superman, trampling
all things under his feet and gratifying all
his desires, commits suicide by swallowing
laudanum at the age of 40, because pleasure
and wealth and fame have turned to ashes on
his lips.”
To end quotation, this is Sinclair’s own
view of the function of novelising:—
The relationship between the novelist’s purpose and
his story is very simple; the two things are one,
and of equal importance, and the novelist must have
them both in hand at every moment of his work.
The consequence of losing either is equally fatal.
The novelist who loses his grip upon the story and
the characters who are living the story begins at
once to write a tract or a sermon —I know all about
that, having done it. But equally fatal it is to lose
your grip upon your purpose; for then you are
doing meaningless reporting, and becoming a camera
instead of a creative intellect.
Let us not forget the sayingof William James
that “the natural enemy of every subject is
the professor thereof.” When he says that
all art is propaganda, Sinclair really means
that all art should be propaganda, and that,
anyway, it can’t help being propaganda. If
his examples and theories checkmate one an-
other and seem twisted and distorted to fit
the mould, count Sinclair at least as creative
and courageous in the exposition of _ Puri-
tanism conceived mistakenly as Historic
Materialism.
R. S. ROSS.
The Emily Claughton Library
The Hay War Memorial High School is
unique. It was erected in 1922-23 at a cost
of £16,000, of which £6OOO was raised by
public subscription and £lO,OOO was Govern-
ment subsidy ; it is a memorial to those men
of the Western Riverina who “went forth
to battle with keen, dauntless eyes.” The
Governor-General, Lord Stonehaven, on his
visit the other day, characterised the school
as the finest war memorial in the British
Empire.
Hay is the centre of one of the wealthiest
wool-growing districts in Australia, and, in-
deed, the world. A small number of graziers,
recognising that they owe a debt to the com-
munity, have during the last dozen years
presented to the school sums of money with
which to found scholarships. These endow-
ments, which were donated by the Falkiner
family in memory of their mother; by Mr.
11. B. Maclure in memory of his son, killed
on service; and by the estate of Mr. G. C.
Claughton through his sister, the late Miss
Emily Claughton, amount to over £6OOO,
which has been State-subsidised by an equal
amount. To crown this £12,000, Mr. F. B. S.
Falkiner last year gave a further £4OOO.
Miss Claughton’s gift of over £2OOO forms
the principal of the G. C. Claughton scholar-
ship for girls. One year there was no can-
didate ; therefore, instead of adding the in-
terest of £lBO or thereabouts to this princi-
pal, it was suggested that the sum should
be spent on books. Both the donor and the
department agreed.
The books it has been my privilege to
choose, though bargaining was hampered
by the proviso that all had to be ordered
through the department.
The library is designed to serve young
people of both sexes from 12 to 20. A criti-
cal observer would, of course, find amazing
deficiencies (such as Gibbon’s monumental
“Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”)
and rather diverting inclusions (such as
Hilaire Belloc’s “Cautionary Tales for Child-
ren” and Professor Walter Murdoch’s
“Anne’s Animals”). Of the 1000 volumes
580 consist of fiction dear to the heart of
youth—as R.S.L. expresses it:—•
Kingston and Hallantyne the Brave,
Or Cooper of the wood and wave.
In gathering together these chiselled stones
in the palace of romance, I was guided to a
large extent by advice very kindly given me
by Mr. E. La T. Armstrong, until recently
in charge of the Melbourne Public Library,
who had compiled for my benefit a list of
historical novels so competent and compre-
hensive that I should be delighted to lend it
to any worker in the same field.
On the narrative and fiction side we have
most of the established favorites, most of the
fashionable favorites, such as Angela Brazil,
that excellent writer for girls, being eschewed
because I thought that eight or nine shillings
a volume was in tire circumstances too big
a price. Good old stagers, such as Mrs.
Muloch’s “John Halifax,” “Olive” and “The
Ogilvies,” George Eliot’s earlier novels, Char-
lotte Bronte’s three masterpieces, and George
Borrow’s three delightful narratives supple-
ment the novels of Dickens, Scott and Thack-
eray in giving body to the collection, which
includes a good proportion of the old favor-
ites, Ballantyne, Cooper, Kingsley, Henty,
Dumas (couldn’t someone invent an edition
of Dumas that couldn’t be worn out?), King-
ston, Marryat and Kipling. Amongst girls'
books we have dear old Louisa M. Alcott
and practically all the stories of Ethel Tur-
ner, and Mary Grant Bruce, Mrs. L. T. Meade
and L. M. Montgomery are also extensively
read. The writers most in demand are
Conan Doyle, Dumas, Rider Haggard, Talbot
Baines Reed, Kipling (“Kim” and “Stalky”
in especial), Edward S. Ellis, Herbert
Strang, Stanley Weyman, Mark Twain.
On the reference side the library is not so
opulent. We possess most of the poets in Ox-
ford editions. Popular illustrated books such
as H. G. Wells’s “Outline of History,” Ham-
merton’s “Wonders of the Past,” “The Child-
ren’s Encyclopaedia” (without exception the
finest child’s book extant, for it contains the
beginnings of a study of practically every
study in all knowledge) and “Harmswortlfs
Popular Science” are all of live interest to
our young readers, while of Hammerton’s
“Peoples of All Nations,” seven volumes, the
lavish pictures and admirable summaries
render it of very real service, especially in
connection with the Dalton plan. We also
have sections devoted to economics and to
history.
Do the youngsters read the books? I
was asked this question by the Inspector of
Secondary Schools. For answer I showed
him the library register, in which are entered
each borrower’s name, the number of the
book he takes out, and the date of its
issue. This seemed sufficiently convincing,
but the question answered itself as the young-
sters strolled into the beautiful library-room
at their own sweet will during recess. “I never
saw a school in which the youngsters so
took to reading,” said the inspector; but
what one can only guess at is the effect this
library, small and imperfect as it is, will
have upon the young people of our school in
forming tastes for reading, in handing them
the key of the door of knowledge and delight,
in character-forming, in helping them to meet
the friends that fail not.
I do not deceive myself: it is not given
to everyone to become a real reader. Put
all your friends, enemies and acquaintances
on oath and find out how many of them
have stuck midway in reading “The Egoist.”
The result will surprise you. Tough books
are no doubt difficult to read; one will
never, however, become a reader without
tackling the tough book. Our young people
devour Dumas (why doesn’t a publisher bring
out an edition omitting a couple of unsuitable
chapters from “The Three Musketeers” and
“The Vicomte de Brageloune”?), but Scott
is neglected upon the shelves. They read
Guy Boothby with avidity and ask for Zane
Grey without success. Well, we must creep
before we can crawl, and who shall say
that a child seeing the admirable photo-
graphs of Flecker’s play in the Sphere
will not seek out and read “Hassen” for
himself?
What a lack of integrity there is, though,
in book-manufacture nowadays! We pay
three times the pre-war price for an article
that is three times worse. Why can’t book-
binders be made to use cloth that is cloth
and not an adroit substitute made from
paper? What right has a publisher to have
a five-shilling storybook printed on pulp
paper so flimsy that in 12 months of
careful usage the pages wear themselves
into an irreparable mass? We paid 11s.
for one of Thompson Seton’s books that came
to pieces under careful treatment within
three months.
ALEX. C. WELSH.
A Satchel of Books
Beau Sabreur, by P. C. Wren (John Murray: Robert-
son and Mullens). Readers of this author’s “Beau
Geste” will remember Major de Beaujolais of the
Spahis and the French Secret Service. The present
novel takes the form of a personal recital of valiant
doings in war, and of gallant adventures in Morocco,
Algeria and the great desert. The style fits the
narrative —a staccato story of mighty deeds and of
sheiks and fair maidens, with interludes in the
American language.
The Letters of Lady Louisa Stuart, selected by
R. Brimley Johnson (John Lane). Lady Louisa,
grand-daughter of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, was
one of the small circle of “great ladies” who, in the
latter part of the eighteenth and earlier part of the
nineteenth century, stood a somewhat isolated body
in a lax social period. According to the standard of
her time, she was of an almost severe integrity and
exceptional culture. Letters such as these make their
special appeal to students, breathing life into the
annals of the time.
The House in Charlton Crescent , by Annie Haynes.
(John Lane). The vogue of the detective novel is
the swing of the pendulum from the studies of
character and the introspective analyses which for
year’s have flooded the bookstalls. Miss Annie Haynes
is one of the “mystery” ladies whose products, with
their eerie covers* have a ready sale; for they are
quite good confections of their class. In the present
novel the reader is led a witch’s dance over a wide
space in the search for the poisoner of the elderly
and benevolent Lady Anne Daventry, done to death
for her jewels and her ducats.
Hygiene Jingles , by R. C. Everitt Atkinson (Brown,
Prior, Melb.). At last arrives the bard of sanitation,
the Shakspeare of the stomach, the Keats of the
germ. “Hygiene Jingles” is a beautifully produced
storj-book in verse designed to teach the Australian
youngster the maxims of health. The author, Com-
missioner of Public Health, W.A., disarms literary
criticism at the outset: “Try to write, in verse,
elegantly of a rubbish-bin, tragically of a mosquito,
feelingly of a fly, or sympathetically of your ‘inside,’
and see how really difficult it is.” Yet how charm-
ingly the author sings of “Pediculosis!”
“A girl who’s nice With purpose keen
May once or twice And kerosene
Have nits or lice She soon will clean
Within her hair; Her pretty head;
But self-respect Then ask mamma
Will soon detect With vinegar
And then eject And comb to war
Them from their lair. On nits now dead.”
Put in this pleasant form, the warnings against bad
habits of health will be remembered by children.
Even the mother may read this compendium with
profit; for the diagnoses of children’s diseases are
plainly and neatly set down. There is even a poem,
long lacking in the anthologies, of “The Ideal Dairy-
man,’* in which we learn:
“His duty done, his overalls he doffs,
Then turns to reprimand the one who coughs
Close to the milk, for very well he knows
Such act perchance an epidemic sows.”
The metre may be rough, but the meaning is quite
clear; and the poet of hygiene is doing good by
jingles.
Outback Homes and How to Build Them, and
Makeshifts. Two booklets issued by the Victorian
division of the New Settlers’ League of Australia,
one based upon the standardised houses constructed
for new settlers by the Closer Settlement Board of
Victoria, and embodying the results of many years
of experience; the other providing for the equip-
ment of a humble home out of inexpensive material.
The booklet on homes is full of useful information,
containing ground plans, specifications, hints as to
details and material, sites and sanitary conditions.
Every kind of home, from the temporary tent to the
permanent homestead, is provided for. The “Make-
shifts” booklet is packed with ingenious suggestions
for furnishing and adorning bush homes out of
kerosene-eases, odd bits of timber and home-made
upholstery. It has already had a large sale. The
owner of the week-end house will find it just the
thing.
The Literary Landmarks of Devon and Cornwall,
by R. Thurston Hopkins (Cecil Palmer). The
counties of Devon and Cornwall are rich in associa-
tions with the historic pages of the past. No Devon
man allows that Drake is dead; “his body may be in
Nombre de Dios, but his soul is in Plymouth, and
it still haunts the Hoe.” In Devon, too, stands to
this day the house where Raleigh was born, and they
show you his “smoking-room”—the first chapel of
ease wreathed with incense to the god of the weed.
And it is the land of Blackmore and the Doones of
Exmoor, for the Doones had a real existence outside
the pages of “Lorna Doone” and so too, had “girt
Jan Ridd.” Though the Wessex of Thomas Hardy
is beyond the bounds of his book, the author makes
a raid into it and has an interview with the poet
and novelist. The family is well known round Dor-
chester, and is said to have come from the same
stock as Nelson’s officer, Captain Hardy.
South Sea Salvage , by Ernest Osborne (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co.)- Since the days when Herman Melville
wrote “Typee” and “Omoo” the South Seas have
been prolific waters for the fishers of fiction, from
“Tusitala” downwards. With but scant local color
.. —though what there is may be accepted as faith-
ful —the author of this latest addition to the Book-
stall series lias put together an exciting story of
adventure ending with a fortune in pearls and a
romantic marriage—-such things as dreams are
made of.

From Concrete to Worn
Macadam.
Don’t accept it as inevitable that on reaching the end of the concrete road speed must be
reduced considerably because you are to run on to a stretch of macadam road for which the
strain of modern traffic has proved too great, and which is, in consequence, little more than a
series of small holes. You have thoroughly enjoyed the “spin” over the hard, smooth concrete
surface. The quiet, even running of the engine has been as music to your ears; the car has sped
along apparently without effort, and with neither rattle nor squeak. Objects to right and to
left of you have seemed to glide by; steadily and smoothly you have gone forward, enjoying
every moment of your existence till—bump! l ; —bump!—and instantly you come down to earth,
and rough earth at that!
Shock Absorbers were made to do away with that wretched bumping and jolting of the
car body that is so distressing to the motorist, and that has such great possibilities of trouble for
the car itself. Such bumping and jolting will indeed be inevitable on bad roads unless and until
the action of the car springs is controlled, and the object of the use of shock absorbing devices
is to control spring action —to prevent the violent rebounds.
To “take” one shock and miss the next—and perhaps the next, also, if the shocks come
very quickly, as they must do on a badly-worn road—betokens a fault in the design or construction
of the shock-absorbing device. Such a charge cannot be laid against the Stewart Shock Absorber.
Its ability to “take” shocks is such as to compel admiration. The wheels of the car may be
travelling over a veritable stream of holes and ruts, and the springs, as a result, be function-
ing continuously, but with Stewart Shock Absorbers controlling their action all that you, in the
car, are conscious of is a not unpleasant rolling motion. The two features of this improved shock-
absorbing device that appeal most strongly to experienced drivers are this “taking of every single
shock and the trouble-proof construction.

This is why we claim that REX-PYE is the finest meat in the world:
1. The tin itself is unique, being stamped out and seamless; hermetically sealed without
solder (lead) or soldering flux—it is the perfectly hygienic container.
2. The meats (raw materials) are perfectly wholesome, being choicest quality, carefully
selected. Visitors from abroad, inspecting our works, have said that the meats are
superior to those used at any other factory in their experience.
3. The spicing by a recipe in our sole possession and the excellent jelly help to produce
the delicious flavor characteristic of REX-PYE.
4. The cooking en casserole preserves all the wholesome meat juices, and retains the high
food values.
Adi these facts combine to produce a meat product of unrivalled quality. Thus we account
for that delicate aroma as you open the tin, and that delicious flavor when the dainty is
eaten.
Its delicate aroma and delicious flavor,
distinyuish it from all other meats.
Ask your Grocer for REX-PYE
—the finest meat in the world.
Look for the attractive label.

xHE more beautiful a woman is the greater her dread of old age.
1 Woman, by her beauty alone, has ruled and ruined nations,
made and unmade kingdoms, suppressed and caused revolutions—
such ,is the power of her beauty.
Beauty and Youth go hand in hand. As old age appears beauty
gradually fades, the skin loses its peacli-like bloom, and, worst of
all, the telltale of approaching years, silvery GREY HAIRS, make
their appearance. As soon as a woman sees the reflection of these
silver threads in her mirror she realises her maturing years. Her
husband, her children and her friends —they all notice it.
ALLEN’S WALNUT STAIN is a simple, harmless liquid, and
when applied to the hair removes these telltale silver threads.
Obtainable in brown or black, it tints to any shade. It is
perfectly safe and easy to apply, and can be obtained from any

DOROTIIEA MACKELLAR.
The Word Spinner.
Lights and shadows, gold and brown,
Through the windows titter down,
Meet and blend in amber mist,
Flooding all within its reach.
In and out the shuttle flits
Where the tireless spinner sits
Spinning always, night and day,
For the souls who have no speech.
For the inarticulate
Things that know of love and hate,
Yet in darkness ever grope,
Seeking speech in joy or woe;
Even as the dumb desire
In the opal’s prisoned fire,
Swiftly changing rdse and green,
Sends it restless to and fro.
Words of pearl and amethyst,
Starshine, dew and morning mist
Glittering, grow beneath his touch —
Words of Freedom’s strong desire
Which in stress of coming years
Yet may fall on eager ears
In some barricaded street,
Swift and terrible as fire!
Voice of these take shape and form —
Wind-tossed pines before a storm,
Muttering swiftly, tense, afraid,
Bending over darkening rills;
Timid things that pause and pass,
Shadow-like in swaying grass;
Mountain streams that chant at dawn
Low-toned thunder in the hills.
All the old roads, red and white,
Memory laden, noon or night;
Winds that pause on starless heights
Where the nights of tempest are;
Idle ships that long for sea;
Open space and storm-winds free;
Mad, exultant fires that sweep
Through the great bush wide and far!
Thoughts half-visioned, buried deep
Down the long, long aisles of sleep,
Drawn by that strange wizardry
AValk, word-clothed in shining song.
Longings vague and unexpressed
At the spinner’s high behest
Spring to joy of vivid life,
Set in speech serenely strong.

Wintry Evening.
Drowned in a chilly blue the dusk descends.
Blue roofs and fences swim, and poplars
stand
Like ghosts in dripping cerements; home-
ward wends
Each trudging cow, limned large upon the
land.
Across the plain the querulous magpies cry.
The long flat road with purple shadow fills.
On every ridge the dark pines smear the sky;
And washed in deepening sapphire are the
hills.
A breathless silence broods —a hush begot
Of the fast-dreaming spell that winter
weaves
From oozy places where the sun is not,
And quiet rain, and mist, and finished
leaves.
Only my restless heart is out of tune,
Riven and racked with thoughts of after-
u oon !
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
Woollooniooloo.
Six months’ pay and three months’ spell—
What can a shellback do?
Give to Charity?. .. .just as well;
There are poor in Woolloomooloo!
There’s Lizzie, and Kate, and Jane and Cis,
Who live on a city’s shame.
While the land and the sea seem both amiss,
Just shell out —and play the game!
Dig in your pockets and spend, shipmate!
Spend swift, while the going’s good!
For Life is a jumble of love and hate;
And one o’ the twain must be your fate;
So follow your own hot blood!
Woolloomooloo, where the time slips back
And the voice of a city sings,
While we follow the wake of some lone
ship’s track
When the knell of our shore spell rings.
Women and wine, and the lees of Life!
And a chance, when the pubs are shut,
To buy a drink for a casual wife
In the slough of some sly-grog hut!
Dig in your pockets and spend, shipmate!
For the lure o’ the city’s fine
And your cash trill vanish as sure as fate;
So why not spend it on Lizzie and Kate
In a spree that is half divine?
Lizzie and Kate? If the Christ was here
There’s none in Woolloomooloo
But would take His word with the utmost
cheer
And cast no stone at the two!
For casting stones is a wowser’s game,
Who lives with the clock shoved on ;
But you and I? We are shellbacks tame—
Our lives on the sea half-gone!
Dig in your pockets, and spend, shipmate!
Though you buy but women and beer!
There are big soft hearts in Woolloomooloo,
And the pubs and the brothels breed them,
too,
And tee’ll chance the woivser’s sneer!

NO-NO: WHAT NEXT?
One way and another the Australian has got
rather into the habit of voting No upon
~ ~ . . ...
Constitutional questions; and he will pro-
, ~ , - •.
bably go on doing it until the Federation
, ~ , .. ~ ....
acquucs a better reputation tor accomplishing
things than it has at present. The tremendous
No majorities which Victoria and 43. Australia
registered the other day were clear intima-
tions that the people of those parts prefer
... , \ , t., , .
at the moment to keep the business ot gov-
ernment 111 their own hands rather than
transfer it to the Commonwealth;- and the
question to be answered is How can that
prejudice against National control be broken
doivn ! To a great extent, 110 doubt, it can
be done only by the State electors of N. S.
Wales and Queensland changing the charac-
ter of their local Governments. No Consti-
tutional amendment is possible so long as
three States say they will not have it; and
so long as one or two of the more populous
States possess Governments which at a dis-
tance look worse even than they are, so long
will the less populous and naturally more
conservative and timid States be disinclined
to hand over any larger part of their govern-
ment to an authority in which the wild men
ot the other States are liable to predominate.
But while to some extent the extension of
the powers of the Federation is. therefore,
out of the hands of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, that body can do a good deal more
than it has done to acquire the goodwill of
Australia.
Certain despairful people, among whom
ex-I’remier Holman is included, advance the
opinion that the time has arrived for a new
Constitution, the present one having been
proved, after a quarter-century’s trial, to be
a poor, hopeless blob. For this purpose they
propose the calling of another Federal Con-
vention, and large doings generally. The
reasons against this course are many, and
the arguments in its favor are few or none.
The organisation of the Convention might
take years. Its deliberations might occupy
more.years. The campaigning required to
secure popular acceptance of the result might
spread into a lot of other years. During all
that period of waiting for a new instrument
of government there would be a worse diffi-
culty even than at present about amending
the old one. The country needs to do many
things before it enters on a period of hiber-
nation like that, supposing hibernation is
called for at any time, which may be greatly
doubted. Any Convention which might be
created now would be a product of party
machinery, with the party-machine business
at: its worst. It would be something widely
different from its predecessor of 1807, and
it would meet in an atmosphere of failure
rather than one of hopefulness. In fact, it
might do more to end than to mend the Com-
monwealth. The Constitution as it exists
now is certainly lacking in many things. The
central authority has no power to subdivide
overgrown States. It has little control over
railways, .and it has no power of its own to
suppress insurrection except in the Northern
Territory and at Canberra, where it is
supreme—at least, it is supreme at Canberra
provided it can get there and isn't besieged
there. It lacks any definite status to prevent
the six State Parliaments making the nation
bankrupt by six instalments. A rotten de-
cision of the High Court deprived it of the
right to regulate corporations, as provided
in Sub-section XX of Clause 51, with the re-
sult that the land is infested with shady
joint-stock enterprises, of which State Gov-
ernments are amazingly or corruptly toler-
ant. The High Court is not infallible, and
in the days when an elderly, learned and in-
genious crank occupied the Chief Justice’s
seat it was less so than it is now. But
there are unexhausted possibilities in the
Charter, and if they were fully exploited the
central authority would have more reputation
and might have better luck.
Among the mutters that the Federal Par-
liament could take sole charge of, in order
that it might become better known to that
shy and retiring animal the elector, marriage
and divorce are conspicuous. Quite a lot of
marriage and divorce go on in Australia and
Tasmania, and in one recent year there were
1 - weddings even in the Canberra area. If
the whole 12 existing laws (six marriage
and six divorce) and those dealing with regis-
tration of infants and care of orphans were
scrapped and replaced by uniform Federal
statutes, the people would gee much more of
their Commonwealth, especially in their sen-
timental moments, and would see many more
of its officials about, and it: would have more
patronage to give away. There should be a
uniform Federal banking law, and a uniform
insurance law which would put the lid on
attempts at State monopoly of insurance.
There exists a right to take charge of astro-
nomical observations (a small matter, but
every trifle helps), and the Federation might
establish a variety of courts and do jobs for
itself, instead of being so much addicted to
the lazy device of lending its sovereignty to
State officials. But it is in the Northern
Territory that the Commonwealth has its
best, chance to make fame and advertisement
for itself, to show what it can do in the way
of development, settlement and good govern-
ment. and to make a model province with a
model Constitution, which might incite to the
improvement of Constitutions that are not
model. Whatever blunders were made else-
where in leaving too much in the hands of
State people the Territory is free of them,
for in it there are none but Federal people,
and no powers except Federal ones. If the
Federal powers produced more where they
are in full bloom, the voting community might
record its appreciation on some future refer-
endum day. The Territory is a huge adver-
tising board with nothing written on it.
At any rate, these things should be tried
first. To suggest a new Convention at the
very moment when a majority of the States
have shown a strong disposition to mistrust
their neighbors looks far more anti-Federal
than Federal.
THE GERMANS ARRIVE AT GENEVA.
By unanimous vote of the States represented
at Geneva, Germany has been admitted to
membership of the League of Nations, with
a permanent seat on the Council thereof, the
same as France, Italy, Japan and the British
Empire. It is the sGth State to join the
League, but there are by no means 56 active
members. The Argentine Republic sent dele-
gates to the first Assembly—there have been
seven altogether—but retired them on fail-
ing to secure an amendment of Article I of
the Covenant, which specifies, among other
things, that a new member “shall accept
such regulations as may be prescribed by the
League in regard to its military and naval
forces and armaments,” and hasn’t been re-
presented since. Brazil withdrew after the
last meeting, when it objected to Germany’s
having a permanent seat on the Council—
in these matters one blackball disqualifies—
on the ground that it had a better right
to one itself. Spain is also absent from
the present proceedings, having been refused
a permanent seat on the Council (it had a
non-permanent seat, like Brazil.),- and the
alternative it suggested, the control of Tan-
gier, and says it has resigned. However,
these three countries are still regarded as
members (two years' notice of intention to
withdraw is required, and then the dissatis-
fied State must have fulfilled all its engage-
ments), and so are others which take no
active part in the proceedings and ignore all
requests for a cheque. The only States now
reckoned as remaining outside the League
are Soviet Russia, Turkey. Egypt, Ecuador,
Mexico and the U.S.A. The U.S.A., whose
President designed the thing to prevent a
war of revenge by the country which has
just been admitted, drafted the Covenant
himself for the most part, and was the first
to sign.
* * * *
By joining the League Germany binds
itself, in common with the associated nations,
“to respect and preserve, as against exter-
nal aggression, the territorial integrity and
existing political independence of all mem-
bers of the League.” This is Article X, at
which the U.S. Senate jibbed. The new
member, therefore, undertakes to defend the
settlements made in the Treaty of Versailles,
to protect Poland, Czcclio-Slovakia, Jugo-
slavia. Iloumania, Belgium and Denmark
should some nefarious foreign Power try to
deprive them of territories carved out of
the old German and Austro-Hungarian
Empires, and to give such support as may be
necessary to the mandatories administering
the former German colonies —“advanced
natrons who, by reason of their resources,
their experience or their geographical posi-
tion, can best undertake this responsibility.”
It seems incredible, but it is true. The
reformed character subscribes to the prin-
ciple that “the maintenance of peace requires
the reduction of national armaments to the
lowest point consistent with national safety
and the enforcement by common action of
international obligations,” agrees that the
Council “shall formulate plans for such re-
duction,” and that “the limits of armaments
therein fixed shall not be exceeded without
the Council's concurrence,” and promises to
interchange “full and frank information” as
to its military and naval programme, arma-
ments and the like with the other members
of the League. It likewise pledges itself to
refer any dispute likely to lead to rupture
to arbitration or inquiry by the Council,
“and in no case to resort to war until three
months after the award or report”; also to
regard any member that goes to War without
first resorting to or in defiance of arbitration
as being at war with all the members, and
to boycott, blockade or bash the offender, in
collaboration with the general body, as the
Council may direct.
* * # *
Time will show what these pledges are
worth. They will be worth something so
long as Germany retains its present rulers,
who have satisfied shrewd Frenchmen,
Englishmen and Belgians that their pacific
professions are honest and are shared by
millions of their countrymen; but if the
nation passes under the control of those who
aim at bringing the Hoiienzollerns back
and plunging into another and even more
frightful war, and who even now noisily
demand the restoration of their colonies, the
value will disappear. And the recovery of
power by the militarists is a possibility
which can never be ignored. As regards
colonies, Germany will now be privileged to
influence the judgments passed at Geneva on
Australia’s administration of what used to be
German New Guinea. For it is provided that
"in every case of mandate the mandatory
shall render to the Council an annual report
in reference to the territory committed to
its charge.” The new member will also be
able to bring up the subject of the colonies
under Article XIX, which says: “The
Assembly may from time to time advise the
reconsideration by members of the League of
Treaties which have become inapplicable and
the consideration of international conditions
whose continuance might endanger the peace
of the world. ' It will likewise have "the
friendly right” (Article XI) “to bring to the
attention ol: the Assembly or of the Council
any circumstance whatever affecting inter-
national relations which threaten to disturb
international peace or the good understand-
ing between nations upon which peace de-
pends.” These provisions may be employed
with mischievous results to the Common-
wealth if the peaceful part of the
German nation is overborne by the belli-
cose part. In fact, Australia has no par-
ticular reason for echoing the cheers with
which the newcomer was welcomed to
Geneva, though it decided to take the risk
and hope for the best.
THE TURMOIL IN CHINA.
If Britain gets much more annoyed she
will probably feel the need of exacting repar-
ations from China, but it is difficult to say
on whom she can serve the writ. There is
an acting Chief Executive in Peking and
several Presidents in hiding, and when last
heard from the 41st Cabinet since the estab-
lishment of the Republic in 1912 was sitting.
An imposing array of legates and ambassa-
dors of the foreign Powers conducts business
with this Government, but nobody else takes
any notice of it. The provinces have drifted
into a state of autonomous anarchy under
local brigand chiefs. They are brigands in
a large way. since some of them manipulate
armies of 100,000, equipped with aeroplanes
and poison-gas plants.
There are signs here and there of new
States being created which will embrace a
number of provinces. Thus Sim Ch’uan-
fll Jig owns live provinces packed with 112
million people grouped round the great indus-
trial and foreign centre of Shanghai. The
Kuomintang or radical national party owns
most of the South. There is a Yannanese
army in occupation of Kiangsi, which is
000 miles from home. How it got there
has been forgotten, even by itself. The
South has lately joined hands with Feng
the dubiously Christian general, who has
just returned from Moscow and is heading-
tor Hankow, the other great manufacturing-
centre 600 miles up the Yangtse. Wu Pei-
i’U, the British protegd from the North, is
m uncertain alliance with Chang, the Man-
churian satrap, who is the whitehaired boy
of Japan. Wt was supposed to be getting
on well with the unification of the country
but his ally at Hankow seems lately to have
ratted on him. Anyhow, when a gunboat do-
mantled the release of two British steamers
and 300 passengers seized by Wu’s lieuten-
ant, the demand was refused and seven
officers and men, including Commander
Dabley, a native of Sydney and the first
commander of Flinders Naval Base, were
killed in a very gallant attempt to liberate
the vessels. Wu refuses to accept responsi-
bility for his subordinate's conduct, which is
natural, since a large army and a fleet would
probably be required to obtain an apology.
Britain thus finds herself at odds with both
the main parties. She has a large navy in
Chinese watex-s, and, anyhow, the Celestial
fleet is so decrepit that it would probably
sink if a matlow looked sharply at it. But
she is extremely weak on land. Her army
does not amount to more than 2000 men, and
most of it is at Peking, where it is sur-
rounded by Chinese forces armed with eight-
inch guns. Lately she foolishly allowed the
Chinese to infringe the treaty right of keep-
ing the Peking-Tientsin railway open, so that
the large European community at the capital
will probably be trapped if a rising occui’s.
The Chinese satraps between them divide
some one and a half million troops, of valu-
ing degrees of efficiency. There is just a
chaiice that they might combine if any single
foi-eign Power attacked them.
The European Powers have mainly them-
selves to thank for the present difficulty of
bringing China to its.senses. In 1919 they
decided that the country, even in its
divided state, was getting too strong to be
handled safely, so they signed an Arms Em-
bargo declaring that “the Governments of
Great Britain, (Spain. Portugal, the United
States, Ilussia, Brazil, France and Japan
have agreed effectively to restrain their sub-
jects and citizens from exporting to or import-
ing into China arms and munitions of war
and material destined exclusively for their
manufacture,” and Holland, Denmark, Bel-
gium and Italy signed later. Not one of the
contracting Powers has observed the agree-
ment, although Britain has several times
made to ’control a complicated situ-
ation. French firms have quite openly and with
the assistance of their Government supplied
various generals with over 150 aeroplanes;
Britain lias winked at British contracts to
supply China with "commercial aircraft,”
though she knew that previous consignments
had been turned to military uses; she has
also allowed arsenal machinery in because
it was not to be used exclusively for mak-
ing shells; Norwegians are helping Chang
Tso-lin make TNT: the Kuominchun army
is learning the art of laying land mines from
German chemists: a well-known American
brand of aeroplane is flitting about the South ;
Italy landed a large consignment of rifles;
Russia and Japan are in the business for as
much as it is worth.
The result of this unseemly scramble is
that China stands in a better position to talk
back at Europe than ever before in her his-
tory. When the Empress-Dowager Tzu-hsi
attempted to exterminate all foreigners in
1900, a small international force, supported
by the South Australian gunboat Protector,
gave the misguided lady a slapping, and that
part of the country which knew the fight was
on relapsed into order again. At present
there is nobody of paramount importance
to be slapped. The most influential people
after the military bandits are the students.
Previously instructed by returned graduates
from Harvard and Oxford, they now get
their enlightenment from Moscow, where the
Soviet lias built a Chinese university in
honor of Sun Yat-sen. Certainly the first
batch of six boy students and two girls
arrived at Moscow dead, the Russian railway
officials having omitted to supply them with
artificial heat on the journey; but there
have been plenty of volunteers since. They
return to preach Chinese nationalism, which
is a passion that has been growing for some
years, and anti-foreign capitalism. Their
greatest recent success lias been the partial
elimination of Hong Kong from Chinese
trade, in retaliation for the shooting in self-
defence of some demonstrating students by
British troops at Canton. One hundred
thousand strikers, the backbone of the
colony's existence, left ; Hong Kong for Can-
ton ; foreign steamers which called there
were declared black; trade dwindled, Eng-
lish and Australian merchants began to re-
turn home, ruined men, and nothing concrete
has been done about it for a year.
The death fi’om natural causes of cities like
Herculaneum has dramatic chai’m; the slow
demise of Constantinople passed unnoticed
by its inhabitants; but the heart-attack of
I long Kong is in a class of its ow r n. To the
purely militant imperialist, surveying the
impregnable rock, studded with fortifications
and beautiful villa residences, the big busi-
ness city down below and the powerful war
fleet lying in the lovely harbor, it must be a
me] ancholy spectacle.
Both from the military 'and economic
standpoint, therefore, Britain faces no small
proposition. If she could rely on the good
faith and co-operation of the other Powers,
her task would be made easier. But co-
operation and good faith between European
Govern men is in their dealings with the
Orient have seldom been conspicuous.
FENG-SUUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Loafing Road to Ruin.
A point has again arisen which is
recommended to the notice of Judges,
advocates and others who potter along
in industrial courts talking wages, hours
and local conditions as if Australia
was self-dependent. For another year (to
June. 1926) the country has failed badly to
do enough work, measured by value of pro-
duction, to meet the year's liabilities. There-
fore the entire bill for interest on external
debt and part of the bill for imported goods
have to be met out of external borrowings, if
such can be borrowed. This is the fourth
consecutive year in which there has been
the same huge shortage and the same post-
ponement of national insolvency by the grace
of the British or United States money-lender,
so no one can say that the habit of living
on the brink of a financial precipice hasn’t
become chronic. There were shortages be-
fore, but smaller and less regular. The
habit really developed in 1921, but there.


was one subsequent year of betterment be-
fore the community settled down to a regu-
lar way of complacent failure to settle up.
Nobody who considers the situation imagines
that the foreign lender will keep on indefi-
nitely lending the gold with which to pay
himself his own interest, without becoming
alarmed at the tottering condition of his
debtor. He naturally finds difficulty in think-
ing out a way to stop or reduce supplies with-
out bringing down a heap of Australian ruins
on his own head, but as the situation
grows worse he will certainly do some think-
ing. The Federal Government owed to people
outside Australia about £25,000,000 more at
June, 1926, than at June, 1925. That is to
say, it owed that much more to people who
want their interest and principal in gold or
in Australian products which will sell for
gold. In the same year the Commonwealth
lent about another £10,000,000 to sundry
State Governments which don’t pay it in
gold. Exactly how much the whole seven
Governments owe abroad, in gold or pro-
duce, will be known when the belated State
returns come in. An outstanding feature
of the case is that the Commonwealth bor-
rows very little in Australia and a great
deal outside. In the past four years its
local debt increased by less than 21 millions
and its external debt by over 40 millions.
The reason is that the great borrowings are
not for public works, which can be built
with our own paper money—the currency
which the Australian employer and employee
are both paid in. They are to meet foreign
interest and foreign importing bills. The
amount by which production, as measured by
exports, was short of plain ordinary solvency
last year was in the neighborhood of
£25,000,000. It was more rather than less.
But while production is obviously short, the
continuous purpose of the ignorant tyrants,
mostly imported, w r ho rule Australian labor
with a rod of iron is to make it shorter.
Giving evidence the other day in the 44-hours
case, one of the tribe mentioned an instance
where one of his slaves was fined £3 for “set-
ting a pace which other men could not fol-
low.” The man wasn’t fined for making
others work as he did, for it was stated
clearly that they couldn’t. He was penalised
for doing good work himself, which, to the
ignorant Labor boss, is an accursed thing
and the worst crime in the calendar.
Piddington and a Vanishing Fleet.
Mr. Industrial-Commissioner Piddington
recently admitted the N. S. Wales branch of
the notorious Seamen’s Union to registration
under the State “arbitration” law, and all
the privileges which registration confers, in-
cluding that of making life a hell on earth
for mariners who differ from the union
bosses. In doing so, he explained that he
had seen a 12,000-ton British steamer with
a forecastle “no-t as large as this courtroom” ;
that British seamen became intoxicated be-
cause they lived in “floating slum areas”
instead of the palatial quarters provided for
passengers; and that members of a British
crew waiting at Port Kembla (N.S.W.) had
been “decoyed on board by a false pretence,”
prosecuted for refusing duty seven miles out
from Sydney, and sentenced to 12 weeks’
imprisonment in Long Bay Gaol, all in
accordance with “a plot that was duly car-
ried out.” The gentleman asserted further
that “the use of the law as a means of
trickery and evasion to defeat the ends of
justice” accounted for a lot of “the turbulent
discontent among the seafaring class,” and
that the Seamen’s Union, “bad” as its career
had been, was guiltless “of any such abuse of
the processes of law as that which I have
detailed.” Thereupon he said :
It is true that .the inter-State shipping companies
were not involved. But their connection with the
overseas combine, of which Lord Inciicape is the
head, has been established, and they cannot escape
from the inevitable consequences of the oppression of
any part of the craft of those men who earn theii
living on the sea.
This means, if it means anything, that be-
cause Mr. Piddington is persuaded that
some British seamen are, or have been, badly
treated, Australian shipowners cannot expect
the Seamen’s Union to honor its agreements.
Naturally the grant of registration and the
accompanying exhibition of Piddington logic
were followed by a renewal of the job-control
campaign which the union was powerless to
wage while it was industrially outlawed. In
the case of the Bombdla, 3571 tons, the fire-
men made demands for overtime pay just as
the vessel, laden with cargo and passengers,
was about to leave Sydney for Queensland,
and, refusing to place them before the con-
ciliation committee provided for in the last
agreement between the Union and the com-
panies—an agreement in which the organisa-
tion expressly undertook to abandon job-
control—were paid off, together with the rest
of the crew. The result may be that the
Bombala will be sold to foreigners, as the
Wyreema (6370 tons) and the Levuka (6129
tons) were sold not long ago,'in which case
there will be only two passenger steamers
trading between the southern States and
Queensland ports. Before the Seamen’s
Union became “definitely revolutionary” Aus-
tralia had the finest fleet of passenger steam-
ers in the English-speaking world outside
Britain itself. There were 33 company-
owned vessels, aggregating 149,594 tons (12
of 6000 tons and upwards), in the inter-
state trade. Now there are only eight, with an
aggregate of 50,421 tons gross. By one of the
tragic ironies of politics, this rapid extinc-
tion of an industry which had the promise
of greatness has gone on while the faithless
Bolshevik union was sheltered by a Naviga-
tion Act which assured its members of good
and abundant food, decent quarters and the
highest wages in the world. The good Pid-
dington admits that the Navigation Act has
“improved seamen’s conditions,” but says
it is “out of date.” He is right in a way, for
the objects of his sympathy have wrought
such havoc in the coasting trade that the
Act will have to be repealed to let foreign
shipping come in; and over it the
Piddingtons of Australia will have no juris-
diction at all.
*
The Race After H.C.L.
It is taken as read that a solid increase in
the N.S.W. basic wage is impending, by way
of another effort to keep it; ahead of the
High Cost of Living. Said wage was 455.
per week in 1913, 555. fid. in 1916, 60s. in
-1918; then from 1920 to 1925 inclusive it
was 855., 825., 785., 825., 825., and at present
it is 84s. The amount now talked of as a
possibility is 955., and if this comes off it
will represent a really serious and probably
disastrous attempt to put the basic wage in
a good leading position. In its race with the
rival animal, Cost of Living, one has
hitherto done a spurt at about the same time
and to about the same extent as the other,
and during recent competitions the relative
positions have altered but little —except
when extra wages have been accompanied by
reduced production, in which case Cost of
Living has shown the best turn of speed. In
a general way the position works out like
this: —
If the increase of wages happens alone, it, and
perhaps a trifle more, is added automatically to
the Cost of Living, which goes up to correspond.
The items into which a manufacturer’s costs are
habitually divided are wages, fuel and light, raw
materials and sundries. Fuel, light and raw materials
are all wages in the long run, for though the
worker in the boot or clothing factory doesn’t pro-
duce them some other worker does. And the same
applies to the sundries, which include new machinery,
repairs and all manner of oddments. There is
no place where the wage bill can be put except cost
of production, which is Cost of Living.
If the successful demand for increased wages is
accompanied by a successful demand for shorter
hours, on the theory that a well-paid man can afford
to do less work than a worse-paid one, then the
increased Cost of Living gets on faster than the
increased wage. When it is a matter of one ton of
output having to carry 255. of wage instead of 205.,
the increased price may be just ss. But when the
output is reduced to 18cwt. the ss. rise is likely, as
a matter of logic, to add 7s. to the price of existence.
No one has yet discovered how to make 40 hours’
output equal 44 or 48 hours’ output (certainly the
State railways, tramways and road-metal quarries
haven’t) except by improved machinery, and Labor
leaders don’t improve machinery.
Then the Protectionist advocates an enlarged tariff.
This tends to keep the work of supplying local needs
in the country despite increased wages, prices and
cost of living, but it damages the chance of doing
an export business.
And the Freetrader advocates a diminished tariff
or no tariff at all, promising low prices and a low
cost of living, though there may be no work in the
country and no wages at all.
And about this time “leaders” and “organisers”
appeal to some sympathetic Piddington or Beeby
for another rise, and probably another reduction of
hours, in the hope that this time, at long last, the
price of production may go up without the price
of the product going up at the same time.
If better methods and appliances were de-
vised (about which matters “leaders” and
“organisers” are not in the least helpful), el-
even if more and better work was done and
output increased by mere effort, the basic
wage would have a chance in the race against
the Cost of Living. There is no definite
limit to the size of the chance, for there is
a great local market to be exploited when the
importer is properly discouraged. Otherwise
it doesn’t appear that anything can be
achieved, either by the ignorant, unpractical
men who appear in courts and demand more
wages, or by the rule-of-thumb men who sit
on benches and grant them. The salary of
neither is dependent on the selling value of
what he produces in return for the salary,
so both tend to live in a dream world. Now
and then, of course, it may chance that an
industrial class (coal-miners or sugar-mill
employees or any other) scores a really satis-
factory and successful rise, and the result is
that, while the discrepancy lasts, one section
of workers gets the high wage while the
others only get a little more of the High Cost
of Living. But this is not what the dreamers
aim at. They want to do an all-round uplift
without the uplifted doing anything in return.
And the thing isn't possible.
♦
The New Volunteers.
“The policy of the Air Force,” says the
“Commonwealth Year Book,” “is to form in
peace an efficient nucleus which in time of
war will be capable of rapid expansion to
meet war requirements.” That sounds very
comfortable and reasonable until one begins
to think about it, and then, somehow it fails
to comfort. In the first piace, if ever Aus-
tralia has a war of her own on her hands it
is extremely unlikely that even the most
superhumanly rapid extension of her de-
fences will be of much avail. She will have
to meet the first onslaught, which probably
will be entirely unexpected, with what fight-
ing material she has got ready. An intelli-
gent enemy won’t allow her several weeks
in which to organise a new army or a new
navy, and as things are going at present she
wouldn’t have a ghost of a show of organis-
ing a new air force. In the first place—
setting aside the lone-liand achievements of
such isolated enthusiasts as Commander
Wackktt — we can’t manufacture aeroplanes,
and even our Wacketts have to import the
machinery which tugs it through the air. In
the second place we haven’t got nearly enough
flying men. A few pilots are being trained
each year, it is true, but so many of the
trainees are losing their lives in the process
that State training is likely to grow unpopular.
The pity of it, is that a country with a popu-
lation so small and a coastline so long has
at its disposal only one line of defence that
really is within its means. We can’t police
our coasts with naval craft nor establish
a chain of garrisons to guard our sea frontage,
but we can maintain a swarm of aircraft
capable of reaching any part of the coast at
short notice and of giving any aerial or
naval enemy a bellyful of trouble. As things
stand we haven’t got the men and we haven’t
got the machines. The Australian Aero
Club seeks to remedy at least half the defici-
ency by reviving the old volunteer defence
spirit and applying it to aerial defence. It
sends out appeals for members and funds,
and it is getting both. It is an article of the
club’s faith that it can do the job it has
set itself to do better and more cheaply than
the Government can do it. It would seem
that it is right. The N. >S. Wales section,
which is but a baby, has got 15 flying mem-
bers under instruction, 31 enrolled, and six
pilot members flying, and people who believe
its mission is worth while have contributed
about £750. The Government lends ’planes,
and it might go further and subsidise the
donations to tin- club and the members’ sub-
scriptions on a 50-50 basis. The warfare
of the future is going to be conditioned by
aircraft, submarines and tanks ; some experts
even think that the footslogger, the pictur-
esque lads on snorting steeds and the boys
whose pants are blue and baggy will be .just
fodder for the new killing-machines. This
view may be erroneous, but it has a lot of
backing; at any rate there probably is
not a first-rate military or naval authority in
existence who wouldn’t advise Australia and
M.L. to make the air their first line of de-
fence. It has the twin virtues of cheapness
and suddenness. By all means the new volun-
teers ought to be encouraged.
“A Certain Amount of Dead Wood.”
A parliamentary committee which is taking
evidence as to the working of the Common-
wealth Electoral Act has reached Queens-
land, where the Labor party won 43 State
seats out of 72 on May 8, although it could
win only one Federal seat out of 12 on
November 14. At Brisbane the travellers
were told that the Commonwealth roll was
cleaner than the State roll, inasmuch as the
latter contained “a certain amount of dead
wood.” The truth is that there are generally
about 10 p.c. more State electors than the
Commonwealth Registrar or Statistician can
trace, so the “dead wood” is more than a
trifle. The maintenance of a roll burdened
with so much deadness unduly swells the
expenditure, and causes loss of time and
temper among the people who have to enrol
in two departments, one superfluous; but the
Continuous crowd persistently refuses to
arrange for a joint roll, although the fran-
chise in State and Commonwealth is the
same. Yet it wasn’t so hostile once. In
1915 Queensland was represented at a con-
ference of electoral officers which affirmed
that “co-operation by the Commonwealth and
the States in the matter of joint electoral
rolls is practicable and eminently desirable
in the furtherance of public convenience, elec-
toral efficiency and economy.” In the fol-
lowing year the Premiers in conference de-
cided, the Queensland Labor representative
concurring, that effect should be _ given to
the electoral officers’ recommendation. The
usual delay followed, for it is not in the
nature of Australian politicians to be expedi-
tious in the carrying out of even simple and
obvious reforms. But in process of time the
Commonwealth has made mutually advan-
tageous arrangements with Victoria, South
Aus. and the Speck, in spite of these States
and Westralia having Second Chambers with
property franchises to provide for, unlike
Queensland and N. S. Wales. The West-
ralian Labor Government is also committed
to a joint Commonwealth and State Assem-
bly roll. But nothing can induce the Queens-
land Labor Administration to come in. Even
as recently as July, when it had broken the
gloomy news about the £554,000 deficit and
was considering plans for extracting more
revenue from the most heavily burdened set
of taxpayers in Australia, it returned the
customary answer to the periodical invita-
tion from the Priminister. N. S. Wales
Labor, though it achieved a deficit of
£1,274,000 in its first year of office, likewise
refuses to free Ma State electors from the
criminal waste and annoyance incident to
keeping two rolls and departments going
where one would suffice. The motive in
each case may be pure, but the results are
putrid.

The Woman on the Bench.
“Ex-P.M.” : So far as the Commonwealth is
concerned, Victoria is the only State in
which women are not now granted the com-
mission of Justice of the Peace. In each
State the appointment carries with it some
limitations upon the exercise of power. These
the lady Justices are anxious to see abol-
ished and the status of women on the Bench
made to coincide in all respects with that of
men. Such was the expression of opinion at
the recently-held conference in Sydney of
the Women Justices’ Association, to which
came delegates from all the Australian States
and one also from Maoriland—in the same
parlous condition as Victoria in having no
women Justices. N. S. Wales is credited
with having approximately 300 of these
ladies, and it was complained that they were
empowered to do little beyond witnessing the
signing of documents. That is not strictly
accurate. True, they cannot, any more than
male Justices, sit upon the Bench in stipen-
diary districts; but as there are no such dis-
tricts iu Victoria, should they receive the
commission in that State they will be able
to intensify the existing evil of crowding,
known sometimes as “packing,” the Metro-
politan Bench. In the country police dis-
tricts in the Mother State some valiant ladies
have from time to time asserted their right
to sit on the Bench with the P.M. and the
honorary male Justices, but it has never
hardened into a practice. I well remember
the flutter caused by the first lady who
asserted her right in my district —about five
years ago. There was a knock at the door
of the P.M.’s room, where he was smoking
a pipe with a couple of honorary male Jus-
tices, and the sergeant opening it announced
“Mrs. Smith, J.P.” There was a hurried
concealment of pipes, and the lady was for-
mally welcomed. The sergeant, looking wor-
ried, asked for a few moments with the P.M.
In an agitated whisper in the outer room he
explained that it was most unfortunate that
the lady had chosen this day for tin- exercise
of her duty, as he had a very long list of
“language” cases, and some of them were
exceptionally gross. What was he to do?
Ordinarily no squeamishness was shown by
the police in giving evidence of this kind.
If people not under any constraint to do so
chose to come to the court —well, they must
bear the consequences. But this was some-
what different. How could the police utter
all this abomination in the presence of the
good lady perched up aloft where all eyes
could rest on her? The P.M. sighed, for it
was a heavy day, but the only thing to do
was to pass the wretched collocations of
obscene words round on slips of paper, from
the witness to the defendant, then to the
Bench and finally to the deposition clerk.
When the adjournment for lunch arrived it
was hoped the lady would go home and stay
there, but sharp on the stroke of two her
Worship reappeared. The P.M. suggested
that she must be horribly bored by the pro-
ceedings. She only smiled and remarked
affably—speaking, apparently, for her sex—•
“Oh, we must become accustomed to that.”
And still she stayed and did not get home
to her evening meal till past six. She was
kept busy signing many jurats, and politely
acquiesced in all the findings of the Court.
On another occasion where a summons for
abusive language over a front gate between
a couple of women neighbors divided the
Bench, she promptly threw in her vote with
a male honorary who advocated the dismissal
of the case on the ground of it being six of
one and half a dozen of the other; so her
weight kicked the balance. “She knows ’em
all right,” whispered the male honorary. She
was invariably cheerful, patient and, accord-
ing to her lights, conscientious; but her
lights were not always limited to the area of
sworn testimony. She had a way of making
them cover a wide general knowledge of the
domestic and other concerns of the whole
town. Had she persisted in the. punctilious
performance of her judicial duties there is
little doubt the Court, with the able assist-
ance of the male honoraries, who also allowed
themselves a wide discretion in the matter
of testimony, would have become a temple
of Solomon rather than of British law 7 . From
this bit of practical experience, added to one’s
genera] knowledge of human nature, it seems
to be a fair presumption that the presence
of women on the Bench in the ordinary
police-court jurisdiction would have the effect
of intensifying the difficulty at present exist-
ing with the average male honorary. This
difficulty is one that only long training can
even partially eradicate. “The essence of
reasoning,” says an authority, “lies in self-
oblivion.” The average J.P. is never, or
very rarely, “self-oblivious.” The evidence
before the Court is not to him the cold, un-
emotional statement set out in the deposi-
tions. It is always plus something. It may
be a bit of knowledge of the parties, a tinge
of personal bias, class consciousness, even
malice or narrow-mindedness. Probably no
training will wholly exclude these personal
elements, but it certainly goes some way to-
wards doing so. Is there any reason to be-
lieve that the untrained woman on the Bench
is likely to be less influenced by her ego than
the man? Is not the probability all the
other way? She is the more emotional of
the two; as a rule, she arrives at her con-
clusions per saltern —often quite correctly,
despite the hazard —but not through any
process of reasoning. There is no sound
ground, apparently, for the conclusion that
the untrained woman on the Bench is going
to usher in a period of purer law and higher
justice than is hammered out by the defec-
tive male. There may, however, be a place
of real usefulness for her in the Children’s
Courts, and these are just the courts presided
over by special magistrates, from which, as
a rule, women Justices are now excluded.

The New Guinea Gold Rush.
“Boubagi” : New Guinea, which once suf-
fered from lack of newspaper attention, is
now beginning to get too much of it, follow-
ing on the discovery of the big island’s
latest goldfield. As usual in such instances,
the publicity is misleading. The mining
men who really know something about
the field have proved as tight-lipped
as their kind invariably are. But every
steamer coming south from New Guinea
waters brings people who have never
sighted a prospecting dish, but are
ready to supply the press with all the facts
about New Guinea mining, past, present and
to come. One of the most self-sufficient had
a lot to say the other day about the Govern-
ment’s inability to prevent undesirables or
inefficients from reaching the field. His idea
that these can reach it through Dutch
territory discounts the “wide experience in
New Guinea” ascribed to him. The nearest
Dutch territory is hundreds of miles from
the field. In between is a mass of jungle-
clothed mountains running to 15,000 feet in
height, which have so far proved impenetrable
even to elaborate.expeditions. Another idea,
that the size of the claims permitted to the
discoverers may cause “a recurrence of the
chaos which has occurred on previous New
Guinea goldfields,” is equally groundless. The
system of granting extra-large “reward
claims” to original discoverers of alluvial
fields is recognised the world over. When
Sir William Macgbegor adopted the
Queensland Mining Act of 1891 for British
New Guinea, he doubled the size of the
reward and other claims prescribed by the
original Act, to compensate for the extra
difficulties. The New Guinea mining ordi-
nances have followed much on the same lines,
and since the Morobe country, in which the
new field lies, as long ago as 1922-23 turned
out 16,5000 z. of gold on 35 miners’ rights, it
is safe to assume that local officialdom has
some experience of alluvial gold-mining admin-
istration. As to the alleged “chaos” in pre-
vious New Guinea gold-rushes, it may at
once be set down as a figment of the imagina-
tion. Privation and sickness there were in
plenty, especially in such very early rushes
as St. Aiguan’s, in the late ’eighties. But
there has never been the slightest trouble or
friction on any of the big alluvial fields of
what is now Papua, beyond the ordinary
grievances to be met with in any community.
A large proportion of the old hands in the
new field are seasoned Papuan ’weight-
chasers, well accustomed to local methods of
law and order, and themselves emphatic, if
unofficial, upholders of them. If any “rough
stuff” does get past the coastal pickets to tile
new field, the Administration and the old
hands can be relied on to handle it.
How to bo a Bona-fide Union.
What appears to be the basic principle
of the Labor movement of to-day—
the theory that the only good em-
ployer is a dead one—got something very
like endorsement from the Ma State’s
new Industrial Commissioner when the
seamen’s application for re-registration
came before him. The sympathetic Pidding-
ton, after dropping many salt tears on the
heads of those who go down to the sea in
ships, affirmed as clearly as a man of law
could be expected to affirm anything, that

“Si Anu” : The murderers of Mrs. Mac Fie,
the Australian woman who was done to
death m a popular tourist resort in Java,
have at last been found, after a long and
extraordinarily clumsy search by the Dutch
police. They were native servants from a
neighboring hotel, and their motive was not
political, as was suggested at the time, but
ordinary larceny. Such occurrences are so
rare in Java that it is a fair inference that
the prisoners got their inspiration from
American moving-pictures. One consequence
is that white men are now very nervous
about sending their wives and children up
to the hill sanatoria, and residents of Singa-
pore, who have had no choice but to use the
Java resorts, are glad their own Govern-
sorting on tin l building of a
lull station m Malay territory. The Malay,
despite his past reputation for picturesque
piracy, is more interested nowadays in
Soccer than in krises.

have I met any other patient who was so
troubled. After being a sufferer for six
years, with two trips to Waterfall within that
period, I commenced Smalpage’s treatment
in May last. Far from having sustained
any damage thereby, or even lack of benefit,
I have improved to such an extent that I
find no difficulty in knocking about and doing
light jobs. To expect a cure in four months
after having been a chronic sufferer for six
years is to expect too much. Most of Dr.
Smalpage’s patients could give much the
same evidence as myself; and even if the
cure . ls n ot yet, the general improvement
manifested makes one very hopeful. Can the
same be said of our sanatorium treatment?

Strict Veg.”: South Melbourne Council has
been offered by Private Enterprise a £25,000
bathing-shed, with cubicles, hot and cold
showers, lounges and a cafe, to be erected on
the beach at Albert Park. It should seize
the offer with both hands, or one of these days
Melbourne will rise in its wrath and do
something impatient to the blockheads and
reactionaries who dominate the affairs of the
seaside suburbs. At present the city’s (and
the State’s) most valuable asset for breed-
ing healthy and wholesome citizens is largely
put out of action by their refusal to move.
In my suburb there are no facilities at all
except a row of decrepit boxes erected bv
private individuals. A tottering sign in-
forms the intending bather that it' is an
offence for him to pause between the water
and the non-existent dressing-shed, and that
exposure of his knees and elbows to the sun-
light will expose him to a charge of in-
decency. This remarkable council employs
a dingy-looking person to pick up broken
glass and papers, and apparently he also has
authority to scare a sense of shame into
babes and slickline's. Anyhow, I heard him
last season order a child of seven to replace
a shoulder-strap that had fallen off in the
course of a plunge in the brine. In many
parts of England it is customary for small
children to bathe nude, but, thank God, in
this sunny land we have attained to the
higher morality of teaching the children that
their bodies are secret and obscene!

The: crook who wants to enjoy the comforts
ot A letorian prisons will soon have to pro-
tect hi s captors from the attacks of the mob
anxious to liberate him. The other evening
an artisan observed burglars breaking iuto
business premises in Elizabetli-street, Mel-
bourne. He rushed off and aroused the
police, and while they searched the building
lie guarded the front door. They were still
searching when he was pursuing a crook who
had jumped through a second-storey window
Overtaking him in little Lousdale-street, the
artisan threw himself on the thief, but being
trusting enough to explain to the mob that
had gathered that his capture was a despe-
rate criminal, he was promptly pulled off. He
started in pursuit again and caught his man
once more. Again the mob thoughtfully sepa-
rated him from his prize, and this time held
him until the_ shopbreaker had got out of
reach. A voice from the crowd put the
popular attitude in a nutshell. “Leave the
boy alone—he didn’t get anything.” This
remark and the sort of sloppy verdict that
is becoming customary in the courts are so
similar as to suggest a blood relationship.
♦
“Gregok” : The Commonwealth authorities
refuse to issue passports to people with
criminal records. The reason given is that
if they were to start their activities in an-
other country it would be a bad advt. for
the Commonwealth. What tosh! A good
many of those who are thus kept here are
not Australians at all—some have not been
long in the country. Why should we detain
these people if they have the money to go
elsewhere? Most other places are so
anxious to get rid of their foreign-born law-
breakers that they are ready to give them a
lift, surreptitiously or otherwise. Why
should we be the mugs?

The kind of Judge who gives evidence from
the bench and makes a failure of it threatens
to be a nuisance. Arbitration-Judge Bekby
made three unwise breaks of this sort early
in his new career. First he made the gro-
tesque statement, apropos of nothing in
particular, that Australian pastoralists have
"a definite policy” of restricting their pos-
sessions in sheep and cattle (and presumably
their output of wool) in order to keep up
prices. Next he said that “figures show that
the man on the land in Australia is better
off than in any other country”—a loose
observation that can mean nothing. Finally
he hurriedly tried the Labor-union bosses on
a charge which wasn't before the Court —
that of deliberately restricting output and
keeping down wages by prohibition of piece-
work—and returned a unanimous verdict of
not guilty. On the other hand he found the
employing class guilty, by reason of its back-
wardness and incapacity, in this fashion :
Judge Bekby: “Piecework is possible only where
there is repetition work. There is no shop in
Australia turning out a sufficient quantity of such
repetition work.”
Possibly his Honor never heard of the Sun-
shine harvester works (a piecework show)
and lots of other big Australian concerns.
In 1924 this country possessed (!S2 factories
with over 100 employees apiece, the average
per factory being 262. Thus Australian
“shops" are not all the one-horse concerns
which they seem to his Honor. But he will
know better presently—if he will only listen
and not talk.

“J.D.Q.”: Following is a statement of rab-
jit skins exported from Australia during
1925:—-
To lb.
U.S.A. .. ... .. 10,419,963
United Kingdom 4,321,960
Other countries .. .. .. 568,083
Total 15,310,006
Owing to a world shortage of fur, there is
likely to be a big increase in 1926. Quite
a number of European countries have already
absolutely prohibited the export of rabbit
skins._ In every probability Bunny, which
has hitherto been considered a curse to Aus-
tralia, will within a few years become a
valuable asset. Many of the so-called seal-
skin and other fur coats are made of Maori-
land and Tasmanian winter rabbit skins. In
my opinion, if capital were found for a big
rabbit ranch in the colder portion of Tas-
mania, where heavy winter skins could be
grown, a big return could be made on the
venture. Sheepmen need not worry—rabbit
skins grown in the warmer portions of N. S.
Wales and Queensland will never command
the market.

“Solon” : If some kind friend were to give
Mercenary Mary a cheque ’for £7OO and her
blessing, it would be wise for Mary not to
follow the garden-gate custom of lingering
over farewells, but to go at once to the bank
and cash the precious document. Even then
things may not always go right. They didn't
in the case of one Swinburne in England
recently. There a lady expressed her affec-
tion for another lady by handing her a
cheque for £7OO. The recipient presented it
at the bank; and, though there was sufficient
money at credit, the officials held up the
order for verification of the drawer’s signa-
ture. Meantime the donor died. The matter
went to the Court of Appeal, and it was
held that this was an imperfect gift and that
Equity could do nothing to perfect it. The
cheque w r as_ not an assignment of money in
the bank; it was merely a mandate in the
hands of the holder to get the money front
the bank, and the mandate ceased to be such
with the death of the mandator.

The staff work and most of the driving
power in the rival Chinese armies now piling
up trouble in the Heavenly Kingdom are sup-
phed by Russian refugees. A great number
of the old Imperial Army’s trained personnel
slipped through the Red fingers and escaped
to Manchuria. Destitute before long and at
a dead end, it was natural that they should
turn to the sword again for tucker. The
greatly improved field work of the Chinese
armies, notably in the recent fighting in the
North, is obviously due to trained European
leading, for no Chinese troops, led by Chinese,
have ever shown staunchness of the kind.
It would be a strange thing if India’s later
military story were paralleled in the other
Asiatic empire. European instructors and
commanders were common in the Indian
armies of the rival native powers for a
couple of _ centuries before John Company
tightened its grip on Hind. Many of these
men made and overthrew Indian dynasties.
I erhaps the Russian will repeat in the new
China what the Englishman, the Scot and
the Frank did in the old India.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The arrogant Lang-Willis-Garden gang
was staggered on Monday night when I’. F.
Louglilin, N.S.W. Lands Minister and
Deputy-leader of the State Labor party,
turned in his portfolio and announced that
he would challenge Lang for the Premiership
at the party meeting next day. Louglilin says
his move was prompted by persistent repeti-
tion of the Labor Daily story that four un-
named Labor Assemblymen were being
tempted with Nationalist gold ; by the refusal
of Seale, president of the A.L.P., to permit
the allegation to be investigated, as the
majority of caucus desired; and by the re-
newal of “the Communist drive,” which was
so nearly successful at the last Labor con-
ference. Another factor which may have in-
fluenced him was the strong anti-Lang vote
at the referendum. That vote was so clear
an indication of feeling in the country elec-
torates, which decide the fate of Ministries,
that the Nat.-Cockies were at one with the
Reds on Tuesday in hoping that the Lough-
lin revolt would fail.
Some day Australia may hold a referen-
dum in which Victoria, N. S. Wales and
Queensland will give a “Yes” majority of
500,000 each (1,500,000), while Tasmania,
S. Australia and Westralia will give a “No”
majority of one each (3), and the “No” vote
will win. Then the need for cutting Aus-
tralia into more States will stick out, and
some steps may be taken to make the
1,500,000 majority carry 10 States instead
of three.
The referendum results have made two
politicians look ridiculous —N.S.W. Pre-
mier Lang, who appointed a horde of
party heelers to see that Bruce didn’t
rig the Ma State vote, and his fol-
lower Ratcliffe, M.L.A., who assured the
Victorians that, in the absence of State
scrutineers, the Cabbage Garden Noes were
“in for a rough spin.” With nobody to watch
Bruce’s minions, the Noes prevailed in Vic-
toria by nearly 2 to 1. Under the eyes of
Lang’s “scrutineers,” N. S. Walqs cast a
majority of about 34,000 for the Industry
and Commerce question and 9000 for Essen-
tial Services.
A typical bit of evidence during the hear-
ing of the 44-hour application:—
Walter George Cook, Secretary of the Cool Stor-
age and Meat Preserving Employees’ Union, said
that in 1903 iceworkers were working 12 hours a
day for seven days a week. They are now working
a 44-hour week, and with improved machinery and
methods of handling the production has increased.
Well, what is the implication? That “im-
proved machinery and methods of handling
can increase production though hours are
reduced?” But who questions it? The sane
person doesn’t. It is the insane or Moscow
person who suggests that the Langs and Gar-
dens can increase production by merely
shortening hours. A man can drop from a
balloon without damaging himself if he has
a parachute. But to merely drop from a
bailobn is liable to have Unpleasant results,
QUeCnsiaiid lias realised its hopes Of U
worse sugar crop than the previous One', SO
there Won’t be much surplus to be sold abroad
at a loss; Still, tlie exportable balance is set
doWn at 00,000 tdnS. Already a vessel is
being loaded with the season’s first shipment
of the dearest sugar on earth to be sold on
dumping principles, in Nova Scotia, at a
price a shade lower than the nigger product
from Cuba. Debate will yet arise as to
whether it is decent for White Australia
to dip into its pocket in order to undersell
niggers.
The enterprising German did nbt Wait
long after his trading privileges were re-
stored to wangle a way to defeat _ tariff
precautions against dumping. The evidence
in a Melbourne Court showed that the im-
porter and his firm, both of whom were
convicted, hit on the idea of over valuing
the German goods on the invoices. Tins
brought the prices to a parity with English
goods of the same type, and would have dodged
the dumping impost if the Australian Cus-
toms had been as blind and deaf and daft
as had been expected.
At last there is a bright prospect of V ic.
Assembly seats being redistributed after a
fashion. The motley crowd on the Speaker’s
right has arranged that there shall be 39
country and urban electorates instead of the
present 44, and 20 metropolitan constitu-
A MAN’S JOB.
“The White Star Line is building a 62,000-ton ship, the biggest in the world.”
BILL THE GREASER: “I see the White Star Line's gonner build a 62,000-tonncr.”
CHORUS: “ Strewth , Bill! What a ship to hold up!”
encies instead of 21. The metropolitan area
is to be slightly enlarged by taking in bits
of the Daudenong, Evelyn and Bulla elec-
torates. The shifting of five constituencies
from the provinces to the city will mean that
the country’s majority over the metropolis
will be 13 (39 to 26) as compared with 23
(44 to 21), but 50 or 51 electors in the
country will still have the same voting power
as 100 in the city. This is as bad as anything
done (or left undone) by Labor in other
States, but Victoria will get nothing better
until it sees itself divided into two States,
one of them consisting of Melbourne and
its suburbs.
After much backing anil filling, the Vic.
Compo Cabinet has sanctioned an increase
of 5 p.c. on railway freights and fares from
September 15. Clapp asked for twice as
much, but the Allancocks contended that the
prospects for wheat, wool, butter and the
like were so good that there would be
revenue enough for expenses and a pretty
good contribution towards replacements. In-
eluding £130,000 a year from inner-suburban
increases approved in May, it is reckoned
that £511,000 extra will be collected for
this financial year. The new 5 p.c. rates
will operate, of course, for only 9£ months
of 1920-27, but they will be the fat months.
While Labor politicians are confidently
expecting a considerable rise in the N.S.W.
basic wage, as a result of the amiable Pid-
dington’s inquiries about tobacco, boots, corsets
and flapper shoes, the Queensland Board of
Trade has refused to disturb that State’s £4 ss,
a week. A 10s. increase was sought by the
A.W.U., but the board pointed out that
wool, meat and sugar, industries with which
the A.W.U. was particularly concerned, had
struck rough times. The board also re-
marked, in a dry voice* that it was harder to
administer sOme clauses Of the Basic Wage
Act than it was to pass them.
The Greater Brisbane Council is ill tile
difficulties which are so common up that
way. There is the iisiial trouble that it
now takes a half-crown to do the work Of a
shilling, and even then the lialf-cro'wn per-
spires a lot. As a substitute for increased
rates valuations are being skied: and the
man who pays the old rate on £3OOO feels
no better than he would if he paid a new
rate on the previous £lOOO.
One Queensland patriot defended his Par-
liamentary vote in favor of a 50 p.c. higher
screw, just after the State had announced
an unprecedented deficit, by pleading that in
the course of the year ho had to attend 40
fetes p.a. in his constituency, and that they
cost him an average of £2 10s. apiece—£loo
p.a. In future the fools will pay it —to bribe
themselves. Of course it shouldn’t make one
despair of democracy; but it makes one de-
spair of a lot of alleged democrats.
Three States —N.S.W., Victoria and S.
Australia —propose asking the High Court to
declare the Federal Act for subsidising State
roads illegal. Under it the Commonwealth
is to put up £2,000,000 a year for road con-
struction, provided the States find £1,500,000.
The three States don’t want to be helped
on the terms, and they don’t want to pay
for helping their neighbors on the terms.. So
the scheme, which is a piece of foolish
meddling, may be blown out, in which event
the Bruce-Pages will have more money to
spend on their proper business. There is
plenty of that.
Before the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court in Melbourne, the secretary of the
Ironworkers’ Association attested that Met-
iers. Limited, sent two men to the U.S. in
1923, and discovered how a man could
make eight parts iu the time he formerly
took to make 14. The whole argument was
that but for the Noah’s archaism of the
Australian employer, hours could be cut and
wages raised almost without end. The latest
return states the value of plant iu Australian
factories (June, 1025) at £109,242,000. The
value at June, 1010, was £53,897,808. So the
Australian manufacturer had acquired over
£55,000,000 of new apparatus in six years,
in addition to replacing an indefinite quan-
tity of elderly appliances. And when order-
ing he didn’t invariably write “Please send
toe any out-of-date stuff you have, the older
the better.” Incidentally, a Labor Govern-
ment has been in office in Queensland a
dozen years, and its chief labor-employing
business is the railways. What wonders do
they show? _ . , , „
“Fitz”: The Great White Train has “done
Wiugham, on the N.'S.W. North Coast. The
slogan at the welcome given by the Mayor
to the officials was: “Patronise Australian
Made;’’ Whereupon Councillor Maclnn, ot
the Maiming shire council, and a sawmiller
for llis bread-and-ttieat, remarked that the
Tang Government, which was about to intro-
duce legislation to make it compulsory on
the part of shire and municipal councils to
—as far as possible—give preference to “Aus-
tralian made,” was at the moment building
a public school at Woy Woy of foreign
timber. The specifications, lie said, stipulated
all foreign timbers —the weatherboards to
be of Californian redwood, and the lining
of Baltic or some other foreign article.
Mysore, in s.-w. India, has been endowed
with a colorable imitation of a European
franchise. As a vast majority of the free
and enlightened electors can’t read or write,
voting papers are to carry, as well as the
candidate’s name, the picture of an animal,
which he is to adopt during the campaign
as liis symbol or blazon —the method of iden-
tification employed in heraldry. As the
Government is to have the job of allotting
the symbols to all candidates, one could
almost wish the new idea adopted in Aus-
tralia. There would be delicious anticipa-
tion while Lang was picking a symbol for
Bavin, and vice versa.
One of the few industries outside farming
that Maoriland has made an effort to foster
is the production of pig-iron. There is one
co. with works at Golden Bay. In addition
to a moderate Protective duty this gets a
bounty of 30s. a ton. and things looked all
right till some merchant started importing
pig-iron from India at a price that just
Undercut the local industry. When the subsidy
was re-arranged so as to give the home smelt-
ers a better wicket, the price of the stuff
from India was cut to correspond. The
Minister of Customs has almost unlimited
powers to alter the tariff where dumping or
Unfair competition of any sort is suspected,
and wheii it was discovered that the Indian
Government was paying an export subsidy
most people expected the Shivery Isles to
stiffen up the duty. Instead it has been
given out that in such a case the Government
doesn’t know what it ought to do. If
a 3ft. fence wouldn’t keep a wandering cow
out of Coates’s garden, would it occur to him
to try what 4ft. might do?
While plans for speeding up the mails to
England by means of aeroplanes are being
discussed, the Speck’s claims to a service free
from the interference of union bosses are
worth consideration. The other day Tas-
manian mails were all ready to go on board
the regular steamer when the usual labor
trouble intervened, and the bags had to be
transferred to a later vessel following a
slow and circuitous route. By air the jour-
ney could be made in a couple of hours, and
the time-table would probably be main-
tained with a regularity that would astonish
the inhabitants of the islet.
When the Vic. Parliament vacates the
wing of Melbourne Exhibition Building (it
has been in occupation since 1901) tlie edi-
fice may be used temporarily for a girls’ high
school. This wing, which faces Rathdown-
street, has housed poodles as well as poli-
ticians, and was a haunt for printers after
the fire at the Government Printery in East
Melbourne. While the typos, were in the
Ratlidown-street structure the late Speaker
Mackey worked at the case at night and went
to the Uni. in the day-time to study law.
Vic. Parliament is, of course, going back to
its old home in Spring-street as soon as the
Federal trek to ’Berra begins.
Sydney’s City Council was perturbed re-
cently on learning the relative cost of making
streets in Melbourne and Sydney. Concrete
reading costs 14s. a yard in Melbourne and
21s. in Sydney. One Labor alderman, whose
commonsense occasionally gets the better of
his party discipline, complained that the tre-
mendous price caused a lot of streets to be
neglected. Others took the old course of
blaming the expert officers. None of them
had anything to say of the ruinous waste,
extravagance and worse which, under a
Labor-controlled council, has made such an
appalling difference possible.

Seldom has a co-operative effort had such a
favorable kick-off. As the Farmers and
Settlers’ Co-op. Grain Co. (it changed its
name in 1919) it started with the toe of the
Farmers and Settlers’ Association behind it,
and in its first year was actually guaranteed
by the State a definite volume of trade on a
fixed commission basis. It was allotted 12.2
p.c. of the 1917-18 wheat crop to handle, and
the rake-off gave it a fine start: it celebrated
its first term with a 10 p.c. div. In the
following year it repeated the 10 p.c. and
handed back a bonus to consignors. Then
came its big step: on a paid capital of
£41,452 it took over the N.S.W. business of
John Bridge and Co., Ltd., at a cost of
£210,847, of which £24,100 represented good-
will. It was a good deal on the Bridges’
part, but looked rather cheeky on the part of
the young co-op. concern. However, pretty
vigorous share-selling won a fair amount of
new capital, and so much of the balance as
could not be raised on mortgage was carried
by the co.’s bankers.
The Farmers and Settlers’ influence has
proved invaluable. Throughout the co. has
handed out divs.; and, if the financial posi-
tion has not been worth an enthusiastic men-
tion, at least it has been steadily improved.
Here are figures for the past two years:—
1925. 1926.
Liquid assets £354,657 £475,361

With little of the outside debt fixed —fhe
deposits are at call —and with practically all
the co.’s operations subject to the influence
of the weather, the position isn’t the Rock
of Gibraltar. Still, the co. has moved for-
ward at a remarkable rate: almost uninter-
ruptedly succeeding terms have gone from
record to record. This is a summary of last
year’s progress:—
Wool handlings totalled 105,339 bales; increase,
17,761 bales.
The dumping plant turned over 150,105 bales;
increase, 32,781 bales.
The poorer wheat harvest (33,741,000 bushels com-
pared with 59,785,000 bushels of the previous season)
resulted, of course, in smaller figures.
Cattle sold numbered 27,020; sheep 333,541
(120,229 increase) ; station produce, a record.
Sales of farms, stations and city properties aggre-
gated £241,755 —£30,000 greater than the previous
year.
Insurance activities —allowing for the big slump in
the wheat crop—were quite favorable.
On the insurance side the co. has had a
lot of business handed over the counter, thus
saving exes.; and otherwise its experience
has been very fortunate. Underwriting fig-
ures for the past seven years follow:

The management labels each year’s surplus
“net profit” and transfers the amount to
“insurance reserve.” But tlie £29,159 so
accumulated has to provide for unexpired
risks, which means that shareholders can
really claim only £21,585 of it.
Though the board has kept the div. as high
as 8 P.c. p.a., reserves now are in excess of
the goodwill. At April 80 this was in the
the books at £26,691. Deducting from the
insurance reserve sufficient for the usual pro-
vision against unexpired risks, there was
altogether £26,993 clear above goodwill:—
Nominal reserves (as per table) .. .. £61.308
Lew Goodwill .. £26,691
Less unearned premiums .. 7,624
34,315
Net Reserves £26,993
The F. and G. has done very well thus far;
but it lias to be remembered that, apart from
crop failures in sections of the State, pri-
mary producers have had a remarkable run
of prosperity during the last few years. The
co. is still heavily burdened with outside
debt, and while it cannot be expected to be
self-sufficient in finance at least it needs to
reduce the load. The path of the co-operator
isn’t a smooth one by any means; and if the
co. cannot carry its constituents when the
lean times come, experience has proved that
some are not over-burdened with the spirit of
co-operation if they see what appears to be a
better chance outside. Fortunately the out-
look is still bright, and if the co. can have a
few more years to strengthen its position and
educate its shareholders by results, there will
be fine foundations for large co-operative
undertakings. Nowhere are they more wanted
than among the farming community. The
absence of co-operation costs the cockies of
N. S. Wales alone hundreds of thousands
every year.

Last month the Mercantile sold its big Sydney
freehold in Martin-place. The price was
£250,000; the purchaser the Colonial Mutual
Life. The enterprising Life office'is housing
its chief branches in the best available posi-
tions in the Australian and S’African capi-
tals, and the latest purchase practically com-
pletes its programme. The Mercantile has
done well for itself: it bought the imposing-
block from the Mutual Life of New York
12 years ago for £122,000. Nor is its fine
profit the sole fruit of its wisdom: before
closing with the Colonial’s offer an excellent
site was obtained half a dozen doors down
Pitt-street. The price paid for this block
was £BO,OO0 —very reasonable as Sydney city
values go. Those transactions lie beyond the
present accounts. Beyond the accounts, too,
lies an issue of 40,415 shares of £1 each
paid to 15s. at a premium of ss. per share.
The premium takes some of the icing off the
cake; but even with the loading the new
shares yield 74 p.c. and solid insurance stock
returning 74 p.c. isn’t to be picked up on the
market. Hence there are a few shillings on
each share if holders prefer to take their
profit. Most of the new scrip will be held,
of course, for apart from the 10 p.c. divs., the
Mercantile has a few bonus issues to its
credit, £107,500 of the paid capital of
£303,110 representing gift issues. The new
lot will bring paid capital to £333,421 and
add £10,104 to reserves. Obviously the man-
agement is pleased with the prospects of
expansion. In addition to the £40,415 of
funds obtained from the new issue there will
be the net gain from the sale of the Martin-
place block; and although alterations will
add somewhat to the cost of Falmouth
Chambers—the new headquarters—the co.’s
financial position will be strengthened by a
fat sum.
Results for last year were well ahead of
all past figures

At one time the Mercantile was fastidious
about its risks. In these days, however, its
pursuit of new business is as energetic as
most. It was to be expected, therefore, that
it would share in the unfavorable underwrit-
ing experience for the period. Actually the
ratios are somewhat higher than shown in
the table, for premiums include the 10 p.c.
bonus which every “tariff” office normally
distributes, but which the Mercantile includes
in profits and then shows as bonus to policy-
holders. Viewing results of the past four
years it would seem that the old days of the
co.’s modest loss rates have gone: a broad-
ened policy-writing and changed world con-
ditions have played their part there. But
with the more liberal acceptance of risks, the
expense rate has shrunk so much that the
new policy has quite justified itself.
Balance-sheet figures will, of course, be
altered substantially as a result of the pro-
perty transactions. At June 80 liabilities
amounted to £121,644. Assets were £587,100,
in the following form: —
Freeholds (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane) .. £ 231,563
Cash, debentures and Commonwealth stock 265,794
Mortgages 17,204
Book debts, etc. . . . . . . . . 72,539
The co.’s own funds (capital and reserves)
were £429,845. As net premium income was
£874,560, much less than the 150 p.c. of sup-
port usually asked for was visible. But
things were better than they looked; the sale
of the Martin-place freehold showed one large
inner support; the £101,037 of uncalled capi-
tal was another. The Mercantile has never
specifically set aside reserves to secure un-
expired risks, its high standing and unim-
peachable record excusing what would be
looked at askance in a less solid old concern.
At June 30, for instance, reserves totalled
£126,735, whereas 40 p.c. of net premium
income rvould require £23,000-odd more. How-
ever, policy-holders have in the past been
satisfied that there was ample protection
somewhere on the premises, and recent events
justify that confidence. Shares are greedily
taken when they make their rare appearance
on the market and are worth at present about
275., which gives a yield of, say, 51 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis. New capital issues are
obviously expected; and they are bound to
come if the volume of business continues to
grow, and that seems as certain as anything
can be in this unstable world.

Four years ago 6s. was written off each of
the 299,121 £1 ordinaries to clean up the
trouble which followed the collapse in rubber
prices. The co. might have avoided that un-
pleasantness had it not been over-eager in
earlier years to ladle out reserves in bonus
issues. Now it is proposed to write back the
65., which means that practically every
penny visible at June 30 will bo absorbed,
and there was little reason to suspect that
much was hidden. (Reserves of the intro-
ductory table consist of the £18,539 profit
which resulted from the sale of the co.’s
Melbourne warehouse, and the £78,882 p. and
1. balance, less the £22,500 goodwill.) Evi-
dently the remarkable result of the 12 months’
trading has encouraged bold action. Even the
directors could hardly have foreseen such a
leap in business. Gross profits soared to
£287,233, or £85,903 more than for the pre-
vious year. Continued popularity of balloon
tyres plus some handsome contracts kept the
new plant working at high pressure, and the
good rubber-buying contracts which the co.
had made in 1924 helped to swell the net
profits. Under the influence of this pros-
perity balance-sheet figures showed some
lai’ge changes

Money on deposit went from £7OO to £26,050 ;
that movement was responsible for the in-
crease in liabilities. Advantage was taken
of the splendid year to write off liberally. At
the 1925 balance plant, machinery, rolling
stock and furniture was in at £188,684 less
£6799 written off for the term; at June 60
the item was at £186,379 less £15,629 writ-
ten off for the year. Book debts and stocks
took a substantial leap, although £41,185
owing on the sale of the Melbourne ware-
house is included with the former on this
occasion.
An interesting point has arisen in con-
nection with the prefs. It is provided in the
articles that pref. holders participate to 10
p.c. Following on queries as to the position
of prefs. in view of the proposal to wi'ite
back the 6s. on each ordinary share, the
directors state that pref. shareholders will
receive an extra 2 p.c. div. for the year in
which the operation is conducted. With the
ords. restored to their old position capital
will amount to £498,311, prefs. accounting
for £199,190. On profits of the past two
years there should be no difficulty in handing
out 10 p.c. divs. and building up reserves;
but the co.’s raw-material market is liable to
rather sudden movements, wherefore the
more support that is given to capital the less
likelihood there will be of such a drastic
operation as had to be performed in 1923.
Meantime all that can be said is that success
has swung strongly in the direction of
Barnet Glass; and the possibilities of expan-
sion are ven- great.

Australia’s greatest trustee co. recorded
further progress for the 12 months. The
net increase in the value of estates in hand
was £1,332,435—n0t a record, but well up
that way. Actually the number of estates
that came in was greater than in 1925, but
the value was less. And there is plenty of
promise in the record notifications received
of wills in which the co. is named as execu-
tor and trustee. Shareholders may, there-
fore, look for 121 p.c. divs. with a good deal
of confidence. As for anything beyond that,
the.bonus shares handed out after the close
of the 1925 accounts were accompanied by
the board’s warning that reserves should be
added to rather than drawn on for gift issues.
The outlook, however, was immediately
brightened by the announcement that paid-
up capital was to be increased from time to
time: there are 100,000 shares of £lO each
paid to 325. No shareholder will grumble
at the prospect of obtaining 124 p.c. on what-
ever cash he may be asked for.
With values rising almost generally—
notably in the case of city freeholds—in-
crease in the value of trusts administered
is to be expected. Here is shown the co.’s
progress over a number of years:—

1926 . . 26,969,507 .107,362 79,846 74.3
The average cost to estates isn’t ascertain-
able, but allowing that 6 p.c. is won from
investments, the average seems to be about
6s. 6d. p.c. p.a. In the case of many estates,
of course, it would be well under that figure.
The Perpetual charges a single commission on
the capital value and annual commission on
the income. Portion of the corpus commis-
sion is reserved and credit taken for it as
the estate is wound up. Net additions to
this commission reserved account last year
amounted to £4134. The account is treated
as a true reserve and is included in the
total of the introductory table and the £4134
forms part of the net profit for the term.
The capital and reserves are in mortgage
and other loans (£122,693). premises
(£114,000 and worth much more), Common-
wealth stock (£74,746) and cash. The liabili-
ties are only a few hundreds. The stock is
very popular; you haven’t a hope of getting
into the 325. paids for less than 905.; and
when the shares have been called up to 40s.
the investment will still be worth only a
shade over 5 p.c.

Authentic comparative data definitely proves the
superiority of Pioneer Wood Pipe over any other form
of conduit. It. is superior by reason of its absolute
immunity from rust, corrosion and encrustations, as
well as its lifelong ability to deliver full volume
flow under all conditions and temperatures. Light
and. of exceedingly simple construction, it can be
installed with great expedition by unskilled labor,
there is no joint caulking to be done, and, under
ground or exposed to the weather —maintenance costs
are practically nil. The Australian Wood Pipe Co.,

the div. for the second half of last year
was at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a., and it looks
as though shareholders may count on the
full 10 p.c. for the current term. “Juice”
was switched on in 1919, and in the seven
years to date £36,666 of goodwill has been
written off, £2618 accumulated and liberal
provision made for renewals, replacements
and contingencies. At latest, there was
£26,412 in that account, and the amount is
not included in the reserves of the introduc-
tory table. Perhaps some of it is actually
profit. In the case of the big City Electric
of Brisbane (the directorates of the two cos.
are practically the same) a similarly-labelled
account has been used as a storage-tank. And
these figures are healthy:—
1920. 1923. 1925. 1926.
Liabilities .. £15,479 £8,310 £6,901 £9,424
Fixed assets.. 69,477 116,905 141,652 144,777
Liquid assets 1,955 19,914 12,914 26,040
Liquids consisted chiefly of cash and Gov-
ernment bonds. Capital is £127,581, and as
the management is keen not many opportuni-
ties for expansion will be missed. The field,
however, is limited.
Westralian gold-producing mines now total
224; there were nearly 10 times that num-
ber two decades ago. East Coolgardie (Kal-
goorlie) is credited with 49; Murchison, 32;
and East Murchison, Coolgardie and Yilgarn,
26 each. Of the other 14 fields only Broad
Arrow, Mt. Margaret and Pilbara reach
double figures.
Oroya Links (W.A.) showed a loss of
£5621 for 1925. This compares with a
surplus of £1047 for 1924 and £11,105 in
1923, in'which years the gold premium was
a good makeweight. The last div. was paid
about two years ago, and, although the direc-
tors state that the present market valuation
of investments shows considerable apprecia-
tion compared with last year’s figures, the
prospect of any more being paid for a time
is poor. Most of the income derived from
investments is swallowed up in London exes.,
and the grade of ore in sight is barely pay-
able under existing conditions. Some London
shareholders are still clamoring for voluntary
liquidation. They say that if this were done
they would get something above the present
market value of the shares, whereas if the
co. carries on much longer they might get
nothing. The co. continues to spend some
money on prospecting in the old workings
of the Kalgurli and in experimenting with
oil-flotation, but, despite vague official re-
ports, in neither case have good results been
obtained.
**. • * *
Glowing reports have reached Perth about
the value of the Braeside silver-lead deposits
on the distant Pilbara field. The stuff now
being raised is high-grade galena; and trans-
port costs, according to report, have been
considerably reduced. A fair amount of
Perth and Sydney capital has been spent on
the field, and now, according to Jock Thom-
son, ex-M.L.A., who bosses the show, the
corner has been turned. Efforts are being
made to get London assistance to carry on
operations on a much bigger scale.
The shutters are again down at the Glad-
some Sand Queen mines at Comet Yale
(W.A.). These two shows produced a lot
of gold down to 400 ft. and were then flooded
out. A fair-sized payable shoot was said to
be under the water in the bottom, and to get
at this the Bullfinch raised and spent fresh
capital and then mortgaged the properties to
the State Government for £4OOO. When that
was gone the co. gave up and the Govern-
ment foreclosed. Now a Pertli-Kalgoorlie-
Adelaide syndicate has paid off the mortgage
and taken possession. The gold is there, and
under careful management divs. ought to be
easily obtained.
* * * *
Westralia, after a few months’ silence, is
talking about another rich gold discovery, this
time near Hollow and Heaton’s find in South
Yilgarn. "Easily the best thing yet struck
on the field,” is how the discoverer describes
if : but it is too early to talk like that. The
find is in uninviting waterless country near
the outer rabbit-proof fence and about 60
miles south of Burracoppin, on the Pertli-
Kalgoorlie railway. Hollow and Heaton have
done fairly well out of rich leaders in this
locality, but few others have found anything
to hallelujah about.
* * * -*
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.), which was
recently closed down owing to the inability
of the co. to make ends meet, may re-open
shortly. Chairman Prothero Jones is in
Perth negotiating with the State Govern-
ment for further backing, and most likely
it will be given. Other Westralian cos.
want State help too, but are waiting until
the Horseshoe succeeds before pressing their
claims.
* * *
Paskov and Mijat, two Central Europeans
who in a few years have learnt much of what
there is to know 7 of prospecting, have treated
another small parcel of specimen stone from
the Oroya East (W.A.) for a return of
£1250. Some time ago Paskov and partner
visited Perth, and specimens having been
shown in the right quarter, the Oroya East
Co. was floated. The prospectors made one
stipulation in connection with the float— they
were to be engaged by the company as miners.
The co. worked the show for some months,
but did not locate any rich pockets, and very
soon the lease revelled to the vendors.
Australian Radium lately bought the con-
centrate-treatment outfit of the Radium and
Rare Earths side-show at Dry Creek (S.A).
It finds packing supplies and machinery into
Mount Painter as slow as a desert camel-
train can make the job. So a motor track
from the foothills to the mine is to be laid
out, and when completed the co. will see
what it can do compared with Katanga m
radium-production. What stirs up Allen
Bowler is that England is asking for 500
milligrammes of the metal as well as for
regular consignments of uranium oxide. It
is a case of having the goods, but being un-
able to get them to market. Among the posse
of experts clustering round the co. are several
M.D.’s and F.R.C.S.’s. While up north they
jolted over to the Paralana hot springs. Dr.
C. C. Fenton was put into camp there to test
the waters. Results are said to be gratify-
ing, and two 40-acre leases have been pegged
out and another native industry initiated.
A hospice and hydropathic institute are to
be capitalised so that the fat man can thin
down on daily mugs of Paralana spa water.

The Rose, Thistle and Shamrock, Harriet-
ville (Vic.), provides evidence of the high
costs of gold-mining'. The ore averages
21dwt. per ton crushed, and last half-year
2873 tons gave 30260 z. besides 30 tons of
pyrites and blanket sand. Despite this good
return the co. lost £690 compared with £lOB7
for the previous six months. Machinery,
plant and working facilities of the mine had
been improved with a view to reducing work-
ing costs. More power is available to crush
an increased tonnage, so that, if size and
value of the shoots be maintained; profits
are predicted for the next six months.
Plenty of"dead work is being done to open
up the mine and add to ore reserves, but the
problem of high costs remains unsolved.
Collins-street is trying to place 80,000 10s.
contribs., at 3s. down, in the Amalgamated
B. H.j a scheme for throwing the Great
Western, Gt. Northern and Centennial 440
acres into one co. In pursuance of agree-
ments, after a favorable report by W. H.
Gundy, 360,000 10s. shares paid to 7s. have
been issued to holders in the three vendor
cos. The 80,000 contribs. look like being
absorbed, and 60,000 will be held in reserve.
Gundy describes the mines as located on
the western belt of curved-line country at
the Hill, and considers that their lode chan-
nels should see great depths, especially as
surface continuity is assured.
* * # #
B. H. Southern Lode had a relapse in Pitt-
street at the end of last week, when the
second bore was discontinued in schist at
335 ft. Scrip paid to 2s. had soared to Bs. 10d.,
lut the bad news from the mining end meant
a nosedive to 3s. 9d., and bears covering short
sales were the main prop even at the attenu-
ated figure. The Hill had some faith in the
prospects and came in a pronounced bull at
about 6s. in the first instance. All hands
and the cook will now anxiously await re-
sults of further boring 200 ft. west of the last
hole, where a zinc lode 20ft. wide and a lead
lode 10ft. wide were uncovered 6ft. below the
surface.
* * * * .
Sardine’s (N.Q.) latest crushing was 156 J
tons for 18i tons of black tin, worth about
£3300, equal to £2l per ton of stone treated.
And the 21st div. of 3d. per share is pay-
able on September 17, bringing the total
distribution to £50,000. A good record.
* - * * *
D. K. Inglis, a director of Queensland Tin,
Koorboora (N.Q.), has been on the show,
and is impressed. The Excelsior, at Gurrum-
bah, and the Tennyson, at Koorboora, he be-
lieves to contain “the most extensive and per-
haps the richest deposits of tin ore at present
worked in Australia”; and to cope with all
this the co. has “70 head of stampers at its
disposal, with the necessary driving power
and metal-saving devices.” Inglis certifies
that the last crushing from the Tennyson
gave 2.17 p,c. oxide from 600 tons, and that a
large silver-lead body is also coming in, giv-
ing 20 p.c. lead and 20oz. silver in bulk
assays across 6ft. Much will depend, of
course, on whether the plant can be reason-
ably fed.
Queensland Antimony, Northcote (N.Q.),
is developing three lodes simultaneously so as
to keep the new furnace going. On the Tunnel
lease there are two separate lenses of ore in
the formation averaging 2ft. wide and proved
for 30ft. in length, vertical extent not yet
known. On the Ethel lode an old shaft has
been cleaned-out to a depth of 70ft., and two
cuts on the way down have shown 2ft. of
high-grade ore. In the Black Bess lode ore is
probably there, but it is not proved yet. So
far only about 12 p.c. is bagging ore, and
local smelting is undoubtedly the only way
to utilise the bulk of low-grade stuff. As
for the future, nothing much is known of
how antimony lodes behave in depth in North
Queensland. A win is badly wanted in
mining in the Cairns hinterland, for outside
of tin at Herberton nearly every metal has
fared badly.
* * * *
Chillagoe State Smelters are re-opening
on a small scale for a three months’ run
to smelt Redcap and customs ore. The Red-
cap, which is out at Mungana, is shortly
to be examined by a mining expert on behalf
of tlie Government. Reports so far are
favorable as to its prospects, but no one yet
has much idea as to the probable extent
of the lode. If the report is good, mining de-
velopment will be pushed on at full speed
with the idea of helping the smelters to run
an extra month or two.
There is a strong agitation among Queens-
land railway unions to get Baralaba State
colliery (Dawson River) closed down. The
loco, crews blame this fuel for their chronic
inability to keep to time-table. A combined
meeting at Bundaberg demanded that no
more Baralaba coal should be used, and the
railway is the only market the mine pos-
sesses. To counter this the manager has
started screening to cut out about 25 p.c.
as slack —-the principal cause of the trouble.
The Navy tests of this coal show it to be a
semi-anthracite, and the nearest approxima-
tion of Australian coals to the Westport
(M.L.) smokeless.
A new strike of antimony ore has been
made in the Drummond Range, 15 miles
west of Clermont (C.Q.) . Three leases have
been taken up, and the lode has been traced
for 150 yards, showing a yellow oxide for-
mation in slate country. Where the crop has
been trenched the walls are vertical, and
show up to 12in. of solid stibnite (sulphide
ore), with low-grade ore outside. It is too
early to say if the find may develop into any-
thing of much value. About 20 tons of high-
grade ore have been won from two cuts
down to a depth of 10ft. The party has
a small contract for 55 p.c. ore at a quote
of £l7 a ton f.o.b. Rockhampton.

H. I. Jensen has interested the Common-
wealth Government in his diagnosis of the
Marienberg bore of the Ormildah Oil Co.,
Sepik River, New Guinea, and at its request
samples have been sent to Melbourne for
further examination.
* * * *
Waratah Oil is the latest float concerned
with the search in New Guinea. Capital is
a modest £15,000 in £25 shares —250 on
offer; 180 fully-paids and £lOOO in cash to
the vendor; 170 in reserve. The solid pay-
ment to the vendor includes the consideration
to the Sepik River Co. for the usual pros-
pecting license. Tlie plan is to obtain a geo-
logical report on the area; it lies on the
Sepik River, which is navigable past the
block. Geological-surveyor Arthur Lindsay
is in charge of the expedition, other members
being R. J. Winters (geologist), C. A.
Sturm an (wireless engineer) and Captain
Macpherson, all of whom know New Guinea
well. Lindsay knows the area and will look
for gold and other metals, and as this is his
own expedition (he is consulting geological
surveyor to other cos. in the Territory) and
the members of the party are familiar with
the country and its conditions, he is definite
that there will be no waste of time in ful-
filling the programme mapped out. Because
of this the gamble is not so wild as that of
many cos. which are wasting capital in the
island.
# * * *
Mandated Oil has to stop for want of
finance to put in a deep boring plant. The
promoters convinced themselves and others
that oil would be tapped without much fuss
at shallow levels. Five bores vary from 137 ft.
to 766 ft. “All have been abandoned because
the plant would not go deeper,” says the re-
port, although it is not clear why a plant
powerful enough for 766 ft. should have found
bottom elsewhere at 137 ft, Exemption has
been secured till the end of the year ; and mean-
time an attempt is being made to raise addi-
tional capital. The present capital is £30,000
in 20s. shares, all called up. During one
spasm excited folk paid £lO for the scrip.
Sydney Malaya has despatched C. J. Rowe
to the F.M.S. as an option-hunter and borer.
The registered capital is only £lOOO, but its
offshoot, Twyford Malaya, has £lO,OOO avail-
able.

Tongkah Harbor holders get a new issue
of 25,000 at 40s. -in the ratio of one for
eight; and old shares can be bought on
’Change at 425. The 25,000 will lift the
register to 225,000, leaving 25,000 still in
reserve. Holders of the original 150,000 who
stuck right through have had £4 4s. in divs.,
and with a more enterprising policy might
easily have had twice as much. The £50,000
of new money will be put into two dredges ;
applicants are asked for 20s. on November
3 and the balance on February 3.
Alluvial Tin (Malaya) is still adding to
its large holdings of deep tin deposits in
the Kihta-Kampar Valley. The directors
are making a thorough survey of the position
and its possibilities, and some shareholders
are anticipating developments on a scale
not hitherto attempted.
Big John McWliae's Philippine venture is
worse. The fleet is cut down to two dredges,
which now are at the end of their job unless
somebody finds fresh paddocks for them to
dig into. Since the famous black-sand days
the show has struggled against its over-
load of capitalisation. The chief burden is
a debenture debt of £40,000, with accrued
interest of £16,422. Debt to the bank is
practically negligible, and is covered by gold
in transit and stores and equipment. No one
is able to tell whether the £97.075 of shares
in the Paraeale Dredging, Ltd., or its debt
of £10,963, is worth a bean. What
sticks out is that the£174,600 of capital is thin
stuff unless McWhae can spot fresh leases on
which to anchor the plant. Manager Tel-
ford seems to have a pull in some direction.
Otherwise why the sentence that the board is
trying “to arrange matters on a different
basis with our manager with the view of
working our plant on a different part of the
field”? No. 2 dredge dug along for a bit,
then ran into a poor patch and shut down
with a loss of only £l2O. Telford says in
two months payable results might be looked
for, but the board is not in the try-try-again
mood. No. 4 netted £4826 towards saving
the situation. During the eight months since
these accounts closed it scraped up another
1400 oz. gold, but the campaign about ended
everything so far as the old leases go. The
old problem of what next has again to be
tackled by McWhae and Angliss.
* * * *
A boom market lias developed in Malayan
tin shares. New issues are eagerly sought at
substantial premiums, irrespective of the pro-
moters, areas or tin contents. There was a
time when the. values of stocks were governed
by profits actually made, and not by those
expected in the sweet by-and-bye. The wild
rush is due to the now-general knowledge of
what shareholders in some early cos. have
received in dividends. This has resulted in
outsiders coming in with their ears back for
anything with which the word “tin” is con-
nected. The market will, of course, adjust
itself in time, but many a speculator wild be
left high and dry.

“Pink Tape” : A rival for Rudolf Valen-
tino, whose three ex-wives straggled for
precedence at liis funeral, has been dis-
covered in a Sydney railway worker who
was killed by an engine at Redfern. The in-
quest brought to light that the woman who
had been known as his wife for nine years
and had given him six children wasn’t; but
two other ladies turned up who each claimed
PART OF WHAT SHE MARRIED.
YOUNG VISITOR: “What a beautiful old-fashioned set of china , Mrs. Downjohn! Where
did you get it?"
HER HOSTESS: “ I’ve had that for twenty-three years, my dear. It is one of the things
I got with Downjohn."
an honorable widowhood as the result of his
death. Like Rudolf, the railwayman is too
dead to be worried about the matrimonial
argument which is being Avaged over his
grave.
“The Deacon”: His earlier years were
spent before the mast, but he is a prosperous
city man nowadays, though of late he has
fallen into one bad habit. It was in conse-
quence thereof that it w 7 as very late when
his friends got him over the gangway of his
homing ferry-boat the other night. A quiet,
tip to one of the deckhands to put him on:
at his destination, and he was left to his slum-
bers in the darkened bows. It was some
time later that the few belated travellers
were startled to hear a loud howl —“Shang-
haied, by God!” Then an angry voice de-
manded to ' see the skipper, and promised
the wireless operator a job. A grinning deck-
hand ran forward and reassured him as the
boat went zigzagging up the Lane Cove
River.
* * * *
“Bilbav” : A Sydney electrician has good
reason to bless the inventor of the safety
gear now in use on modern lifts. He was
working on the installation of a new lift
in a Kent-street warehouse and was on _the
fifth floor when he heard somebody calling
his name up the lift-well. Looking over
the unscreened enclosure he was just m
time to catch the descending car on the
back of his neck. It squeezed his throat
against the rail, and for a fraction of a
second seemed to be guillotining him; then
the safety grips worked. That saved him,
though he was held like a mouse in a spring
trap till his horrified cobbers dashed up
three floors and set the car ascending. His
only injuries were some bad bruises. Luck
if you like; but a thousand times more than
ordinary luck seeing that the safety device
had been adjusted not more than half an
hour previously.
"Nedric”: Forty years ago a carpenter’s
apprentice left the Cold Country to make
his home in Australia. During the voyage
the ship’s carpenter was on the sick-list, and
the passenger willingly lent his services _as
understudy, On his arrival, the shipping
company, anxious to recognise its obligation,
wrote offering the young man a free passage
back to England if he should contemplate
a trip in the near future. No reply was
received—-at least not for 35 years. Then
the carpenter, no longer an apprentice, wrote
to the company accepting its kind offer, and
asking when it would be convenient to con-
vey him to his Motherland. After some hesi-
tation the co. agreed to honor the ancient
promise by offering a third-class passage. Being
now mayor of an up-country town, the pros-
pective deadhead pleaded that it would be
infra dig. for him to travel steerage, and
stuck out for a second-class passage; but
the company was getting its back up by this
time and insisted on him paying the difference
between third and second out of his own
pocket. His Worship returned from his
trip two years ago, and, being a Scot, lie
never tires of boasting of his cheap holiday.

“Herodot”: A North Queensland woman,
57 years old, had been suffering from excru-
ciating pains in the small of the back. After
a period of observation in the local hospital
a diagnosis was agreed upon by the medical
staff, and it was resolved to operate. To
the surprise of the surgeons, they found no
signs of the suspected condition, but, in-
stead, a revolver bullet of small calibre em-
bedded in the large muscles surrounding the
dorsal vertebra;, Avhere it had evidently been
lodged for many years. The patient was
equally surprised at the discovery, having
not the slightest recollection of having ever
been shot, while there were no signs on the
skin of the entry of the missile. Inquiries
amongst members of her family threw no
light on the matter. The only theory
advanced was that while a baby she must
have been accidentally shot without serious
injury.
“Howard”: Re goanna-oil as fuel for
Fords (B. 15/7/’26). I know an enter-
prising Scot who attempted to repair a leaky
radiator by the insertion of a few handfuls
of oatmeal. The car ran for two miles, after
which it resisted all persuasion to further
progress. Examination revealed a radiator
full of gurgling porridge. The case seemed
hopeless till another Scot in the party sug-
gested the addition of a “wee bit saut.” Par-
ritcli was poor stuff wi’out it, he said.
“Wandering Willie”: A hard-hit British
industry, much less advertised than coal-
production, is bagpipe-making. The Scot-
tish pipe has had the wind knocked out of
it by hard times,
especially in the
north of England,
where it is much
more heard than on
its native hills. The
only thing keeping
the trade alive is
the export markets,
and the best of
these are Maori-
land and Australia.
After this pair

tomers from Alaska

bearing the wearer’s name and the State
from which he hailed, the idea being to en-
sure ready recognition of the scientist by all
and sundry. Unfortunately the visit of some
teams of inter-State footballers clashed with
the scientific pow-wow, and they were
equipped with badges, too. Hence a shop-
girl, scanning with interested eyes the lapel-
ornament of one of Australia’s most distin-
guished savants, inquired cheerfully, “Well,
how’s your team shaping?”

“Maru”: Berry's Bay (Sydney) is the
home of ships with a history; the Inca (B.
28/8/’26) is only one of them. The worn-
out ferry steamer Manly is the latest to
come under the eye of the sliipbreaker. The
Inca and Manly have been moored together
off “Hooky” Einersen’s yard for about three
years. (“Hooky,” by the way, is dead, but
(lie yard is still run in his name.) The
Manly’s engines and boiler are to be in-
stalled in the ex-motor-ship Madal, another
Berry’s Bay identity. The Madal, which
is to be put into the Rabaul copra-catching
trade, was built at Doom in 1920, and the
ex-Kaiser or somebody must have put a
hoodoo on her, as her internal economy has
broken the heart of every engineer who
boarded her. A twin-screw job, she was
towed into Sydney from Rabaul minus a pro-
peller and with her engines so badly out
of gear that a couple of shipyards, including
Cockatoo Island, turned her down. Two
other crocks in the bay are the Anglian and
Gabo. The former is the Oldest Inhabitant;
she’s been drowsing there for nearly 20 years.
“Ces”: The Apollo Inn (B. 12/8/’26) is
not the oldest pub in Melbourne. The first
was Fawkner’s (where now is the Custom
House) ; the second, also Fawkner’s, is now
the Union Club Hotel. J. P. Fawkner
bought the land on which it stands, south-
east corner of Market and Collins streets,
at the second land sale in November, 1837,
for £lO. He erected a wooden and brick
building, and named it Fawkner’s Hotel. It
was here he printed the Port Phillip
Patriot, just as in his first tavern he had
written his manuscript paper, the Adver-
tiser. In June, 1539, the inn became the
headquarters of the Melbourne Club; a few
years later the latter moved to its sombre,
quarters in East Collins-street. The hotel
presently became the Shakspeare and then
the Union Club ; now it is to be modernised
under the name of the Cecil. In IS3B there
were eight pubs licensed in the province,
HOPE FOR THE BEST.
“Oh, just leave me alone — I'm down in the mouth.”
“Well, old top, remember Jonah —he was like that and came out
all right, y' know.”
among them Fawkner’s, the Lamb (now Scott s
Hotel), the Shamrock (Little Flinders) and
the Adam and Eve (Little Collins). This last
was delicensed a couple of years ago; the
Shamrock is still going. The Apollo was not
licensed until 1842. The London Tavern,
in Market-street, recently remodelled, is as
old as the Apollo ; so is the Port Phillip Club
in Flinders-street.
“C.Q.” : A farm-laborer out of a job has
some claims to be considered Melbourne’s
star motor thief. The other day he bor-
rowed a car in Flinders-street, and when
the petrol ran out changed into another out-
side the Dental Hospital, Finding this not
to his liking, he helped himself to a third at
Box Hill, drove back to the city and there
transferred himself to a fourth. Intercepted
by the police patrol he claimed a perfect
stranger as his uncle and owner of the car ;
but the citizen appealed to denied any know-
ledge of either. The thief then admitted that
he had lived in other people’s cars for several
weeks. What he had lived on didn’t transpire.

WEEK-ENDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that for a tiresome week
We have toiled and earned our wages,
Knowing that kind nature’s smile
Trouble soothes and care assuages,
What say you, my friend, if we,
Coastal ways or inland taking,
Pack our traps and roving go,
Town and all its folk forsaking?
Par from market, far from street,
Par from labor’s daylong bondage,
Think of how we shall rejoice,
Round about us leafage, bondage;
Think of how rve twain shall laugh
Strolling light of foot together,
Flowers and trees and birds our friends,
All about us golden weather.
Seeking copper, silver, gold,
Hours more rare than gold we squander;
Mute are we and deaf of ear
When great nature bids us wander;
Cobwebbed are our minds and souls —
Let us cleanse the cobwebs from us ;
Light and elbow-room we crave;
Radiant health and hope they promise.
Now the week is at an end,
Let us, far and forward faring,
Hither, thither where we will,
Give our minds and hearts an airing;
Pink boronia tints the hills,
Wattle-ways are bright to follow
Brother-rovers with the wind,
Let us range o’er hill and hollow.

“Oliver Cromwell’s watch has been stolen from a

What was there of it a thief to tempt?
No trinket-gaud for vain display,
l?ut a steady timepiece to tick away
Sober night and serious day;
Ticking them off till time should yield
The crowning mercy of Worcester Field,
And plain Noll Cromwell, warts and all,
Make restless Europe pause to note
What he dictated and Milton wrote—
Somehow I fancy we’d like to know
Just how it strikes them down below.
By the news in a three-hour sermon checked.
Stand-fast-in-the-faith Josiah True,
Lifting his hands, turns up his eyes
In sour wrath at the graceless scrub.
The pick-thank offspring of Beelzebub,
Spoiling the goods of the Lord's elect.
While deep in the shades where Cavalier blades
Re-fight o’er their liquor old sieges and raids,
A bumper they’ll add to the quick-fingered lad
Who lightened Old Noll of his watch.

“Erua”: The piano, being a large and
unwieldy instrument, occasionally finds
itself in strange situations. I recall a trip
I once took through flooded country in M.L.:
suddenly turning a corner we came to a
small hill upon which stood stranded, as
the ark upon Ararat, an apparently new
piano. It was raining torrents at the time,
and as the flood waters were rising, the fate
of the instrument seemed dubious. We
found that it had been imported by a
wealthy farmer who had abandoned it in
the stress of flood conditions; it was re-
trieved by a bullock-team when the waters
subsided. Near by a party of men took two
days to rescue a piano from a river ; it had
got. there from a lorry that had come to grief.
But the most abused piano I ever met was
housed in a dilapidated M.L. cowshed, where
it was used by a budding musician whose
father objected to the noise indoors. It was
fenced off from Blossom and Strawberry
with bales of straw, and the enthusiastic
youngster who owned it used to practise at
night with the aid of a kerosene lamp. It
says much for his grit that he became a
successful music-teacher in a big town.
“Clifford Snook” : A heated sectarian row
has been progressing in the S. M. Herald
correspondence columns oh the question,
“Can Christians be cremated?” They can,
and hundreds of thousands of them have
been. At one time, in fact, all the best
Christians were cremated. Three notables
among them were called Latimer, Ridley and
Cranmer.
* * * *
“Ibn El Issar”: Something new in the
variegated record of naval visitors to Aus-
tralia turned up the other day when the
British steamer Middlesex arrived in Port
Jackson with seven Egyptian cadets on
board. They are undergoing a preparation
for the Egyptian navy, and are all of high
lineage at home. If the Gyppo navy to-day
is a thing to smile at, it has probably the
most ancient of saltwater histories. Long
before Tyre and Sidon Gyppo fleets ranged
the Mediterranean and Red Seas, crossing
the Indian Ocean to India, and going far
down the east coast of Africa —all tins

well within the period of recorded history.
As a pukka navy it perished at Nava-
rino a hundred years ago, in the last big
clash of the old-time wooden three-deckers.
“Gouger”: In the Gaza hills, after Beer-
sheba, we came on a tragic group: a Tommy
sergeant, his hands tied behind him, two
Turkish soldiers, a bedouin and a donkey.
All had been dead for months, and the atmo-
sphere had sun-dried them. The details of
that grim tragedy we never knew. Close by
was a nomads’ camp which provided us with
another riddle, less sinister but equally in-
soluble. She was a remarkably beautiful
Arab girl, with lily-white skin, black eyes
all ablaze when we excited her, and a mane
of auburn hair that fell to her knees. Ihe
Arabs swore she was a full-blooded desert
queen, but the romantic theory that they
had captured her as a white baby during
some midnight raid found some supporters

LAWYER: “Yes, but how do you know this woman they've got hold of as a witness couldn’t

CLIENT : “Why, man, because she was standing outside a milliner's shop."
among us. One Light Horseman, a bit of
an ethnologist, contended that she was a
throw-back to the Phoenicians; my own view
is that she was indebted to one of Napoleon's
cohorts for a male ancestor. She was a
woman, anyway, right down to her dainty
little toes, and enjoyed immensely the close
interest the barbarian Australians took in
her, to the fierce jealousy of her swarthy
countrymen.
“O. Bumpkin" : A new use lias been found
for the ILA.N. Yachtsmen at Black Bock,
one of Melbourne's exposed beaches, have
wanted a breakwater for a long time, and
have just got it. 11.M.A.5. Cerberus, aged
70, and feeling every day of it, was towed to
the resold, and her seacocks opened. When
she finally settled most of her hull remained
visible above the surface. But it is doubt-
ful whether the residents will always bo as
proud of their breakwater as they are to-day.
Wrecks don't, as a rule, grow in picturesque-
ness with age.

“M.P.D.” : The old name for the avocado-
pear among the crews of British men-of-wnr
on the West Indian station was “midship-
men’s butter,” for the reason that the real
article was mostly absent from the junior
mess-table, and the creamy flesh of this fruit
was used as a palatable substitute. The
Spreckels lino of boats between Sydney and
"Frisco used to serve it as a regular dish,
and the Pacific liners may do so now for
all I know. The pears were served in three
ways, the most popular being on toast, some-
thing like poached eggs. In Central Ameri-
can hotels which cater for tourists the avo-
cado figures at every meal. An iced-pear cut
in two and eaten with salt is excellent, and
spread on brown or malt bread »it tastes like
a delicious, creamy butter. Mashed with
a little mustard, cayenne-pepper and lime-
juice or vinegar, it blonds into an excellent
mayonnaise. If “Akenehi" (B. 26/S/'26)
cat's her next sample as a mayonnaise instead
of with it, she will agree with me. Slices of
the fruit are also made hot and served with
boiled or steamed fish, accompanied by a
tartly-flavored hot sauce. Avocado cooked
and eaten with a grilled undercut steak is
a dish for an epicure. It is often used as a
salad, and sliced with a tart apple, white
celery, a few capers and a capsicum is a
dietetic poem. Do not use, olives with avo-
cados, as both contain a large percentage of
fat.
“Schnorrer”: There are indications that
the two biggest tabernacles of Jewry in Aus-
tralia are to be moved at an early date. The
Bourke-street Synagogue, in Melbourne, may
go to a St. Kilda-road site. Although a_new
synagogue has been created at St. Ivilda,
there are quite enough of the Chosen in that
direction to keep two going; and. as another
synagogue is to he formed in Carlton, and
there is one in East Melbourne, the Bourke-
street location has ceased to be central. The
site is valuable; and the chief temple of the
Chosen will stand out much better in the
new location. In Sydney the Great Syna-
gogue is now dwarfed by mammoth build-
ings on each side, and those in control con-
template asking Parliament to pass a bill to
supersede the Synagogue Act of 1875, and
give the trustees power to sell the present
site. Some tempting offers have already been
made; and a tabernacle at Darlinghurst
would be much handier for the Chosen, who
are supposed to walk to worship.
“.T.H.”: The most considerate suicide of
my acquaintance was a Cobar (N.S.W.) pie-
man. Tired of vending his wares, he took
his way to the local hospital nearly a mile
distant, and severed his jugular with
a razor, having previously laid himself down
on the bench in the Morgue.
“Flagwagger": There are gleams of dis-
traction to lighten the monotony of a
poll-clerk’s job. As soon as the booth
opened on Septem-
ber 4 two middle-
si ge d gentlemen,
both eager to re-
cord the first vote,
rushed to the table
where I sat: a
moment later they
had bumped the
trestles, and ballot-
box and ballot-
papers made a hor-
rible mess upon the
floor. When we had
sorted ourselves our
it was found that the
causes of the dis-
turbance had both
come to the wrong
booth. An hour
later an old lady,
after examining
he r ballot-paper,
declared that sic
didn’t want one
like that she
w ante d one on
which she could
vote to shut up the
h o t e 1 s. Having
failed to convince
her that it was nor
a prohibition refer-
endum, we sent her
to the presiding
office r. A few
minutes before 8
p.m. a chap asked
me, “Has my wife
voted yet? She ran
away last week,
and I want to find
if she is still in the
district.” When I
politely refused the
desired informa-
tion he called me
several names, and
announced his in-
tention of punching
my jaw. He might have, too, had not a
policeman hooked him out of the booth.
“X.N.0.”: What “W..T.T.” says (B.
2/9/’2O) shows that the Gap is not high
enough for heart failure to get in its work
before the bottom is reached (B. 2/9/’26) ;
but the Galleries at Gibraltar are 700 ft.
or 800 ft.. up, which may make a difference.
I know only one other place besides Sydney
where there is a regular spot which the
conventional people choose for their exit.
Behind the Custom House at Malta is a
flagged courtyard at the foot of a nearly
sheer cliff 180 ft. high, with the lovely Bar-
acca Gardens at the top. Suicides always
hit the cliff-face about half-way down, and
the grim marks, which are too inaccessible
to be cleaned off, are thoughtfully pointed
out to passengers ascending the, cliff by
the electric lift.
* * * *
“X.N.0.”: Besides “Congreve” and other
matches that ignite without a box (B.
9/9/’26), indelible pencils are strictly barred
in all British men-of-war. Matches that
will strike anywhere are known as “10A"
matches, 10A being at one time the number
in the punishment list of the penalty im-
posed on tin' possessor. A vast area of
clean wooden deck can be covered by the
broken point of an indelible pencil after a
few bare feet have spread it about a bit.
And it takes an age to get it out of the
wood.

“Coppertop”: Bluey, the humorist of our
section, lost his sight early in 1915,_ and
when I reached London after the Armistice
I visited him at St. Dunstans. He was
in great fettle despite his affliction, and
cheerfully admitted having been crimed that
day for breaking out and spending the previ-
ous evening down town. “But. anyhow,
he remarked. “I'm luckier than the cove next
to me. He’s getting married!” I asked
Bluey if his friend had seen the lady. “No."
he replied with a grin, “and from what I can
hear, lie’s damn lucky he can’t.”
“Samoh”: It happened in a Queensland
town only last week. A young chap retired
to his bed at one of the local pubs after
a puce evening. Early next morning he was
found searching his room for his false teeth,
meantime complaining feelingly of severe
pains in his pantry, rublic opinion lost no
time in deciding that he had swallowed his
teeth, for he was “dead certain” that they
were in place when he turned in. A doctor
was summoned, and the patient being by
this time convinced that he could actually
feel the grinders in his inners, it was decided
to send him by car to Longreach to be X-
rayed, and, if necessary, undergo an opera-
tion for the dredging up of the vanished
property. Some hours after his departure
the publican was called to the ’phone.
“What's this I hear about Z. going to
Longreach for an operation? He was all
A SURE RECKONING.
"How many times has Peggy been engaged?"
“I'm not certain, How many sea voyages has she made?"
right hist night.” said one of the local taxi-
drivers. “Oh. lie swallowed his teeth after
you brought him back.” replied Bung. “That
be damned!” returned the other. “lie let!
’em in my car and I’ve got ’em in my
pocket.” We are still wondering if the
surgeons at Longreach actually started on
the hunt.

When first tall Michael came to me,
What did I see? What did I see?
I saw a young man with horn-rimmed glasses,
Little side-levers and freckles in masses,
Hair that was mousey and getting thin,
And a slow, wide grin.
When tall Michael went from me,
What was he? What was he?
A slim young god with a conquering way—
My heart cries after him night and day.
There was a kiss in the eyes behind the glasses—

And the haunting lips that are mine, are mine!

H. W. Gepp, chairman of the Development
and Migration .Commission, spent his last
few clays before leaving for London with
Priminister Bruce, in hunting up his fourth
member. Queensland was combed—the Com-
mission would have been all the better for
somebody with a first-hand knowledge of the
tropics. The search was for a younger man
who had his thoughts on agricultural develop-
ment ; and he was found in E. P. Fleming,
permanent head of the N.SAV. Lands Depart-
ment. Like the rest of the Commission, he is
no more than middle-aged—43, in fact.
It seems almost as hard for a lawyer to get
into the S.A. Assembly as it is for a rich
man to enter Heaven. The only representa-
tive of the Sixenatc brigade at present is
Attorney-General Denny, who for nearly a
quarter of a century lias been one of the
members for Adelaide. During the last 15
years or so only three others gents, one
have sat in the House—Harwell, ex-Premier
and Attorney-General; J. H. Vaughan, who
was Attorney-General when his brother
Crawford was Premier; and Arthur Black-
burn, who, returning from the war with a
V.C., was elected to Parliament with a re-
cord vote. At the State elections to be
held next year several of the younger Cost-
chasers will offer themselves, but their occu-
pation will be a handicap.
It would not greatly surprise his close
personal friends if Bowser, whose health
is indifferent, threw up the Speakership of
Vic. Assembly before the end of the session.
A. A. Billson, Chairman of Committees,
who ordinarily would relieve Bowser in the
chair, has been ill for months. His resigna-
tion is also a possibility at any time. In
fact, in the last two years the limit of
members’ patience has just about been
reached in providing deputies for him. Far-
thing has come into prominence recently as
Acting Deputy-Speaker. If he doesn’t get
flic Speakership he is pretty sure to become
Chairman of Committees when the job is
vacant.

With two extra seats for tlic metropolitan
area, as is now proposed, there is a reason-
able chance of Labor it os Blackburn, Solly
and Webber retaining their places in Vie.
Assembly. When it was proposed to give
only 24 seats to the metropolis it looked as
if two constituencies north of the Yarra
would have to go to satisfy the demands (on
the quota proposed) of the territory south
of the Yarra. Blackburn would be a bad
loss to the House and Ins party if he were
squeezed or gerrymandered out.
It is hard to fire bullets anywhere in the
world without hitting an Australian: Com-

His father and uncle, scions of a
Wicklow (Ireland) family, came to Ails-
tralia in the early ’sixties. The uncle,
Frederick, who had practised at the Irish
l>ar for nine years, became Chief Justice
and Lieut.-Gov. of N.S.W., and, incidentally,
married a sister of Rolf Boldrewood. The
father, Cecil West Darley, was an engineer
who did a lot for -Newcastle Harbor and
became chief engineer in N.S.W. for harbors
the rivers, but settled in England on
his retirement. Commander Darley, who
was born at Campbelltown f>o years ago went
to Osborne when a boy to train for the
iNavy, and, after seeing service on the Aus-
tralia during the war, was second-in-com-
mand at Westernport (Vic.) fo_- a couple
of years.

J. M. Chanter, Riverina’s M.11.R. for 20
years, has resigned from the Vic. National
Federation—lie was treasurer of the Caul-
field branch —in “utter disappointment and
despair at the result of the referendum
vote. The fine old Australian, now in his
S2nd year, blames the Nat.-Fed. for what
happened in Victoria, and suggests that it
should change its name to something with
“State” in it, since it has turned National-
ism down.
Death fought with the man at the wheel
while the tug Hero—the pride of Sydney
Harbor when it arrived storm-stained from
os years ago—was berthing the
1< erndale at Pyrmont. Captain George Gibson
who has had charge of the tug for 15 years,
was at the wheel when one of the crew
noticed that he was ill and offered to re-
lieve him; but Gibson said he would finish
the job. He did; but directly it was done
lie fell unconscious by the wheel. He died
six hours later.
In 1875 Robert McGeoch, with £5O in his
pocket, went to Berrigan (N.S.W.) and
selected land; when he died last week, 78
years old, he was one of the largest property-
owners in the. State. The first grower of
wheat in Berrigan, lie made big profits and
sank them in pastoral holdings—he held at
one time more than a million acres. Some
of his stations were cut up for closer settle-
ment; the rest were floated into three big
pastoral companies of which the old man
remained managing director.
Chalmoogra oil got a distinct kick up as
a cure for leprosy when Sister Marie Bap-
tista literally returned from the jaws of the
grave the other day. She is a French nun
attached to the Gilbert Island Mission run
by the R.C.’s in the interests of the lepers.
Some years ago Sister Baptista acquired the
scourge and was segregated on an adjacent
island with a solitary black attendant. How-
ever, she persevered with the oil and now
announces a perfect cure. She is back with
her community again.
One of the industrial captains of the
bluenose end of Maoriland died the other day
Over GO years ago Jolip Mill started steve-
doring, and made several big coups at sal-
vaging. At the request of the Government, he
recovered from a wreck much of the building
material for the Waitaki Bridge, one of
the largest in the world in those days. His
bawbees grew as a result of recovering the
frozen meat from the Elginshire, wrecked
near Timaru, but the salvaging of the May
Queen called for a diving suit. Only one
being in Maoriland at the time, John' tried
to hire it; failing, he offered the owner the
job of diving, but was again rebuffed. Then
he took the diver and his suit into what
proved a very lucrative partnership.
Vic. Parliament will reach its 70th birth-
day under responsible government on Novem-
ber 21. The dad of Bill Everard, Ind. Lib.
member for Evelyn, was in the first Assem-
bly (1850-59), although lie was not there
in the first session. The grand-dad of Frank
and Russell Clarke, two of the present mem-
bers of the House of Landlords, was a
member of the first Uppah Ohambah under
responsible government. But there was a
single chamber, partly nominee and partly
elective, misnamed the Legislative Council,
from ’5l to ’5O.
The Christian name of each of the three
Federal Arbitration Court Judges, Deth-
i‘idge, Lukin and Beeby, is George. “Let
George do it.”
There was a unique clause in the will of
Herbert Smith, of Hamilton (M.L ) who
died while on a health trip to Brisbane
leaving £lO,OOO for the development of physi-
cal culture in Maoriland. In his day the
donor was a noted athlete, but contracted
chest trouble in England and died from its
effects. During his illness his mind turned
to a scheme for preventing such diseases by
physical development in children, and his
will provides for a prize for the best system
submitted to the trustees, no scheme to
include the practice of conscious deep
breathing. Born in Wellington (M.L.),
Herbert Smith travelled widely, and during
the war built and ran a small munitions
factory in England.

A. J. Kirkton, who has been selected by
the Nat.-Fed. and the A.W.N.L. to oppose
Lands Minister Downward, a Cockyite, at
next general election for Vic. Assembly, is
a brother to .Toe, who used to represent
Ballarat West and was an honorary in the
Irvine Cabinet. A.J. made some money as
a baker and more as a land speculator. Re-
cently he got into Mornington Shire Council
when other residents were too bored to
bother, and, as Downward is nearly SO years
of age, the nearest Parliamentary seat looked
inviting. But he will have a job to shift
the G.0.M., who has had many a fight
since he downed f £ Smith 82 years ago.
If the compromise reached by Vic. Lib-
cockiest for the redivision of the State into 80
provincial and 26 city constituencies is
ratified by Parliament, as seems certain,
Willie Watt and Chief Justice Irvine, two
former Premiers, will watch the achieve-
ment with more than casual interest. Irvine
is responsible for the present scheme, which
is so much out-of-date after 28 years of use.
There were no women voters when it was
enacted. Thirteen years ago Watt tried
to substitute 70 electorates for 65, but he
went down on his bill and had to give
place to Labor-leader Elmslie for 18 days.
Peacock (in two Governments he led),
Lawson and Allan (last year) tried in vain
to secure some settlement, but self-interest
was always the stumbling-block.
C. ,T. Davenport, of a well known Adel-
aide family, has died suddenly in Shanghai,
at 68. As soon as he left Prince Alfred
School he devoted himself to the medical
side of missionary work, and since 1860
has had charge of various hospitals in China.
For the last 20 years he controlled one at
Shanghai, which, by reason of the variety
of local diseases, the immense native popu-
lation and (latterly) an enormous endow-
ment left to it by a local merchant, is one
of the biggest things of its kind in the
world.
Margaret Lowe, who has retired after 45
years with the Vic. telephone service, joined
up when Melbourne exchange could boast of
only 500 subscribers. It was then a private
concern, managed by the late Byron Moore,
and was situated in the old Stock Exchange
building in Collins-street, where The Bul-
letin's Melbourne. office was for 25 years
and the Commonwealth Bank now stands.
For some years Miss Lowe was manageress
of the service.
The hoodoo that has pursued the R.A.A.F.
all the year caught an eighth victim last
week, and a ninth only escaped by a piece
of masterly airmanship. On Sunday Ser-
geant E. B. Goell, a pupil of five months'
experience, who had been spending his hours
off duty in perfecting himself in his job,
crashed and was killed while practising land-
ing in a paddock near Geelong. A rain-
storm is believed to have confused him. Four
days later, in the same locality, Flying
Cadet Knox Knight struck a cow. Minus
his undercarriage and tail skid and with a
splintered propeller, Knight slid along the
grass to a standstill without injury—a
remarkably clever save.
“Henry Horsecollar” is wrong (B.
Lb) and “Basra” right; there were
throe Indian V.C.’s won in the fighting for
Kut. Here are the records:

“Of , Lance Naik Lala, Jan. 21,
lJlb; No. 1005, Naik Shahamad Khan,
April 12, 1910. Incidentally, the three V.C.
winners mentioned by “Henry Horsecollar,"
Cookson, Cowley and Firman, were all in
the Navy. Only two w r ent to officers of
Indian regiments—one in the Medical Ser-
vice. The other 14 are all in British regi-
ments.
A T. Markman, just appointed manager
v r .? Pacific Cable Board’s affairs in
Maoriland, started as a messenger in the
ALL. telegraphs. Hard work, diplomacy and
a sense of humor ran him up with something
A 1 msh to the job of secretary of the
G. 1.0. in this position he had to hold the
scales between the Eastern Extension Tele-
graph Co. and the State-owned concern he is
now to manage, and he did it with great
fairness. The feeling against the private
English co. was so strong at one time that
Alarkman’s clerks used to alter the instruction
on cables from “via Eastern” to “via Pacific."
One man charged with the offence pleaded
that he considered it his duty, as he was a
Socialist. Markman showed no sympathy
for this method of ushering in the Brother-
hood of Man, and the practice speedily be-
came unhealthy.
The temper of Judge Draper, ordinarily a
placid man, is beginning to wear thin under
the assaults of Arthur Haynes, defending
counsel in the Kalgoorlie murder trial.
Haynes has. improved even on the manner of
the late “Dicky,” K.C., his father, who used
to behave like a terrier worrying a draught-
horse. Dicky, who was a brother of John, of
Sydney, could reduce a school of seasoned
poker-players to a state of nervous hysteria
in five minutes and retain his own equanimity.
\ ictoria s loftiest J. Hop is Constable
P. IP Bonsey, 6ft. sin., who hails from

Senior-constable Tim Hanlon, 6ft. 4in., and
three others measure 6ft. Bin. Before the
strike, the force carried on its pay-roll Con-
stable Renton, of Gippsland, 6ft. 54ft. But
there were giants in the land in those days.
The proceedings of the Caulfield (Vic.)
municipal council have been beautiful to see
since the new Mayor put on the robe and
chain. He is Fred Porter, who held the
light- and middle-weight wrestling cham-
pionships of Australia from 1904 to 1906.
Tragedy was waiting for young Nelson
Hardy, of the Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)
Rugby League team, when he left the field on
Saturday after doing his best to prevent
South Sydney’s victory. Hardy is one of
the season’s best football discoveries, and is
a three-quarter of unusual cleverness. His
21st birthday celebrations were postponed
for a week because he feared that the cakes
and. ale would put back his training for the
semi-final. His father was present to cheer
his son’s team to the victory it failed to
secure, and apparently the cheers and the
excitement were too much for him. He died
as the young footballer came ofl: the field.

Kiritona, Awahou and Katoa, are com-
manded by Clarks—all brothers. At Gis-
borne the other day three of the four ships
were in port together—the only vessels

sailing orders the fourth brother would have
dropped his mudhook alongside his relatives.

DOWN SOUTH.
[For The Bulletin.]
Down south round old Glenkennich
The same blue mountains stand
That saw the lordly squatter
Once king of Tussock Land.
Now south in old Glenkennieh,
Once fenced with gorse and broom,
Within the barb-wire fences
The ragwort is in bloom.
The squatter and the shearer
And sleepless musterer,
The solitary shepherd
And drunken rsbbiter—
All these have passed for ever
To other fields of toil
Since first the mile-long furrow
Tore out the virgin soil.
Yet through the misty cycles
I see that land again—-
Tall women with fair faces
And strong, full-bearded men.
(I wonder where is Mary !
Lord, how I loved her then!
But Love is shy, in boyhood,
Of women and of men.)
From Catlina to Waikaia,
Wide lands but scarce enough,
They ploughed, and sowed and harrowed
From Beaumont to the Bluff.
They hunted the merino
Back to the mountain crowns ;
They took the plain and foothills,
They burnt and ploughed the downs.
Wherever team could clamber,
Wherever share could rip,
The coulter and the mould-board
Clung with an iron grip.
The straight long rig and headland
Were.etched upon the plain,
And round the silver ridges
Black furrows snaked amain.
THE TALLY.
FRIEND: "What did she run yon. into the first year?”
OWNER: " One tramcar, two telegraph-poles, a pedestrian, a meat-
waggon and three court cases.”
From dawn to the long gloaming,
Beneath uprising stars,
The big strong-shouldered horses
Hung to the swingle-bars.
The quick two-handed sowers
lvept to the seed's faint line,
And the wide silent harrows
Levelled with ready tine.
Who plants llie rose and lily
is sure of his reward,
But on unsheltered hillside
Or flood-imperilled sward,
Who shall avouch the seasons
Or guarantee man’s gain
Though he should sow in season,
To reap his wage in grain?
And yet by distance mellowed
There sounds the day-long hum,
Now rising and now falling,
Of the ribbed threshing drum.
A harvest moon is shining,
And far into the night
The panting, coughing engine
Thrusts with Samsonian might.
Long Brand is at the engine,
Bob Jenkin cuts the bands’
Sam Jolly feeds the thresher
With swaying, generous hands.
On stack, at elevator,
The steel-bright forks make play;
A goggled goblin figure
Drags the white chaff away.
The sheaves are short, well-headed;
Brand gives the mill full power;
On the last lap she’s running
Full sixty bags an hour.
With the last whistle sounded
The bullocks haul her out.
I hear the long whip cracking,
1 hear the driver shout.
The harvest home is over.
We load the waggon teams ;
Bnl my heart is with Mary
At harvest homes in dreams.
MAomiiAN-n. DARIUS.
“South-Easterner”: This must lie a record
or near it for lambing. It certainly is the
top of the pole in these parts—the Mount
Gambier district, south-east of South Aus.
A comeback ewe owned by F. C. Caine, of
Kongorong, recently dropped five lambs,’ all
in good condition and matured. Owing to
rough weather conditions one of the number
succumbed. As the mother is only normal
in size, some of her charges are being
taken from her. East season this same ewe
gave birth to four lambs, three of which
were successfully reared. Another comeback

“Birubi”: The shovel (B. 19/8/’26) is
the grid and frypan of huts and camps, but
not of the wallaby. Many a feast of 'mush-
rooms have I enjoyed from a shovel-cooker.
They don’t taste as good any other way
unless cooked on red coals. Stewing or
frying mushrooms spoils them. But on the
wallaby there is no shovel —only a billy and
coals. The billy is used to stow a bunny
or to boil eggs, and in the latter case the
same water does to make tea. The wood
coals are used for grilling, and the char which
adheres to the meat helps to whiten and pre-
serve the teeth.

“J.G.F.”; One of the most noteworthy
journeys made in Papua was that of a battler
over (50 years of age. He got tired of beijig
idle in Port Moresby and imagined that he
could get gold on
the old Yodda field.
He left the port
with his swag con-
taining a blanket,
food, tobacco and
oddments, making
i heavy load, and
carried it up the
mountains until
some natives took
pity on him and
relieved him of it.
They also brought
him native food
and escorted him
over the Owen
Stanley range to
Ivokoda. The dis-
tance from Port
Moresby to Ivok-
oda is 90 miles,
and the track one
of the roughest in
Papua. The old
chap reached the
Yod and a goldfield,
but did no good
there. Eventually
lie met Governor
Murray, who, with
his characteristic
kindness and admiration for all decent and
plucky battlers, saw that he sot safely back
to Australia.
* * * *
“Two Seas": Tell “Raborak” (B.
l!)/8/'2f>) that the most effective method of
ringing trees is to take out a good chip of
the sapwood with a double cut. The arsenic
Process is a quick killer if done carefully. I
have seen the tops of some trees die in a
week. When boiling the arsenic and soda
keep to windward of the fumes. An old
teapot is the best thing to administer the
dose with. About a teacupful for a tree
12in. in diameter. Increase the dose for
larger trees. A good plan is to mix some
limewash with the arsenic, so that when
the operator resumes work in the morning
he can see which trees he dosed the previous
day. The best time for ringbarking is when
the sap is up, and not in the winter months.
If “Raborak” uses the arsenic method ho
should ringbark as low down as he can with
the single cut, wrenching his axe-blade out-
ward at each blow, so he can see that the
cuts overlap and no “strings” are left by
which the sap can bridge the gap. Killing
timber quickly is best for land that is to be
cleared for cultivation. On grazing land it

“’o w do 'ee knaw they poor goats do enjoy it as much as the
boays?”
“'Ow do I know! Wadden I a kid meself onee?”
is better to kill slowly by taking oft about
eight inches of bark when the sap is rising
well without cutting into the sapwood. Trees
thus dealt with toughen as they die, and do
not shed their branches and make a mess of
the paddock like the timber treated by the
sudden-death process.
"M.G." : To kill his refractory timber effec-
tively and expeditiously let “Raborak” (B.
l!)/8/’2t>) make and apply the arsenical
solution according to the following instruc-
tions, and I'll guarantee him a 100 p.c. kill.
Also before he gets half-way round his
200 acres, the trees first treated will be as
dead as doornails. Dissolve lib. caustic
soda and 41b. of white arsenic in 10 gallons
of water. If more convenient, a smaller
quantity of water may be used for dissolving
and the solution subsequently broken down
to 10 gallons. Ring the tree cleanly, though
frilling will do if thorough. Then swab the
ring with the solution, being careful to leave
no part untouched : for the arsenic, though
permeating the capillaries from the smallest
root fibre |o the topmost bough, travels only
up and down with the timber pores anil
cannot act transversely. Even gum-topped
box. swamp mahogany and other notoriously
bad ringers will promptly succumb to the
treatment given above.

"Nosey : I know a busliman in Vic. who
can "smell out" a snake as easily as a tan-
nery. His first demonstration to me was
made one hot day when we were riding
along, a bush track. Suddenly he drew rein,
sniffed a couple of times and casually re-
marked “B smell a snake about here.” Sure
enough when we passed round a bend 20
yards ahead a six-footer was stretched
across the track. That this uncanny de-
lection was no fluke was proved on several
subsequent occasions.
“Burgoo” : I can always smell a fox when
crossing his trail, and have often proved this
by the dogs putting up one shortly after
I have detected his presence. As to camp-
fires, how's this'? I know a young bush-
man, a non-smoker, who smelt his way on a
still, dark night for three miles across a
paddock to a dam where he knew his father
had gone. The old man had puffed his pipe
as he rode. The young chap had never been
in the place before and had no idea of the
direction in which the dam lay.
* * * ’ *
"Retired Volt” : I doubt that the vagaries
of “Mea’s” watches (B. 26/8/’26) were due
to the electricity pumped into him during
a 10-days’ stay in hospital. Certainly, the
human body when properly insulated is a
condenser, but its capacity is minute, and
any charge it has absorbed will be dissi-
pated immediately a portion of the body
comes in direct or indirect contact with the
earth. During all those months after leav-
ing hospital did “Mea” never sit on the ground,
lean against an iron verandah-post or turn
on a water-tap? If he did lie lost all the
current he had ever stowed inside his skin.

Bouragi” : The umpteenth “discovery” of
a pygmy people in
New Guinea has
just been reported
by the Syd n e y
daily papers. Sir
William Macgregor
first definitely made
known the exist-
ence of the true
Pyg m y type in
Papua 30 years
ago, and since then
they have been dis-

navigation of the
Fly and Alice, in
1014, for one—and
scientific expedi-
tions. The latest
find has been made
by a German plan-
ter named Eidel-
bach, who has
located the little
people on the
mountains at the
head of the Rama
River, on the n.-e.
coast of old Ger-
man New Guinea.
This find really has
some interest, as
proving that these
mountain dwellers
are on both flanks
of New Guinea’s
great central moun-
tain system. Auth-
enticated disc o v-
eries have hitherto
located them only
on the western and
n.w. slopes, whether
in British or Dutch
territory.
“Dogela Borrop” : I can assure “Barrap”
(B. 19/8/’26) that bees can and do pierce
the skin of fruit. On the Murray in the
summer, when flowers were scarce and fruit
plentiful, the soft-skinned peaches were
nearly all destroyed by bees. The soft, sweet
flesh of the Sea-Eagle seems to suit their
taste. Some specimens of the fruit were
merely skins full of bees. The mandible
with which the insects work the wax is well
fitted for piercing the skin, and even more
for cutting away the flesh when they have
sucked the juice out of it, so as to get at
fresh supplies. Where fruit is being dried
there is no room for bees, as they interfere
with file work, keeping the men away from
the cut peaches, apricots and dipped raisins
until night comes, and I am quite certain
they deteriorate the fruit by abstracting so
much of the sugar. “Larrap,” of course, is
a bee-man. If. like myself, he were a fruit-
grower, he would see that bee-farms were
kept far away from orchards at the time
of harvesting and drying, even if they were
brought back at blossoming time.
THE ONLY WAY HE COULD DO IT.
“You must find it difficult to support pour
large family these times.”
“ Difficult! I'd find it impossible if they
wasn’t all of ’em out earnin’ their own
livin’s.”

“Ller”: I know a Parramatta man who
claims that his pipe has been in use for Ml
years. It is a common briar and mostly
shell, and there is nothing but the reek to
prove its antiquity, but that is good circum-
stantial evidence. Is this a record?

The service of Dunlops 7
Wherever there are roads in this country
there are motors—and where there are
automobiles you will find Australian-made
doing their share towards the progress and development of
this country. It was the “Dunlop” tyre that made motoring
possible and the same tyre to-day is rendering service—
dependable and economical— to tens of thousands of o wners
of cars and motor cycles. Its outstanding features are
strength, great mileage and ability to withstand hard driving
over all conditions of roads and tracks. For value & service
it has no equal—its popularity amongst motorists is evidence
of that. Use them, it pays! Obtainable all leading garages

“Biro”: The story told by “Delos” (B.
26/8/’26) is a particularly interesting one.
Has the pheasant a pair of spurs? If so
the male could carry the eggs by hopping
along to the new nest. I have often thought
that quail moved their eggs about. Or
rather that Mr. Quail did so, for he is the
domestic creature, and not Mrs. Quail. She
would make him lay the eggs if she could,
for she has taken the male plumage and
some male habits. However, I can’t say
for certain that Mr. Quail removes the eggs
when left to the job of hatching. I know
that larks do.

“Bullwhanger": Captain Cobham’s refer-

over Bima remind me of a legend I heard a
couple of. years ago in the Solomons con-
cerning similar mysterious creatures, The
coons round Marovo Lagoon swear that
Gattekai a small but lofty island to the
south of the lagoon—is inhabited by “big-
feller debil-debils,” and their description of
them tallies with Cobham’s pictured mon-
sters. According to the islanders, these frisky
reptiles live in tunnels in the hill and make
a booming noise before “strong-feller wind
he come. The noise, I suspect, is really
caused by the wind blowing into holes in
the rocks. But here’s the riddle. A local white

from Gattekai, the bones of some outsize
lizard. He packed the remains up and
addressed them to the Museum in Sydney;
but, unfortunately, they failed to reach their
destination, and are now resting at the
bottom of the Pacific in the vicinity of
Mellisli Reef, having gone down in the wreck

“Lucifer”: The reason why the swarm of
bees that settled on “Anaf’s” drunk (B.
12/8/’26) did not sting him was that they
were drunk, too. When a swarm leaves a
hive or nest to seek
another home, it
knows that when it
arrives the cup-
board will be bare,
so its members fill
themselves up with
honey and disgorge
it when they arrive.
Every day they
work they fill their
honey-sacs with
nectar, but this is
not as potent as
the concentrated,
matured honey
stored in the cells,
and it is this that
makes bees drunk.
I have seen a bee-
keeper place the
queen of a swarm
on his beard and
allow the remain-
der to cluster all
round his face. I
ha v e repeatedly
shaken a large
swarm of bees from
a branch into a
hive, and not re-
ceived a single
sting, whereas
under normal cir-
cumstances I could
not have disturbed
it without punishment.
“Fitzjay”: Re inquiry by “S.N.R.” (B.
J6/8/’26). There is, 1 have found, an appre-
ciably greater loss from crossbred than from
merino lambing amongst the older ewes. The
reason for this is that the “roominess” of the
merino permits fuller development of the
lamb before birth.
AdeL.’ : Straying buffaloes from one or
other of the herds grazing upon the vast
swamps in Arnhem’s Land find a way round
the Gulf, always travelling northward along
the southern and eastern shores. Of recent
years many have been killed on Lawn Hill
and adjoining stations. Two or three years
ago one went as
far north as iCroy-
don, where it
caused a great sen-
sation. The whole
of the town’s male
population went
out armed to the
teeth to shoot the
invader; so many
shots were fired
into him with rifles
of all calibres that
the hide resembled
a sieve, and, of
course, was value-
less. Few of the
niggers inhabiting
the south coast of
the Gulf have ever
seen a buffalo, and
such fantastic tales
of these animals
have been circu-
lated that Binghi
lives in constant
dread of meeting
one. When strange
tracks have been
seen or the rumor
goes about of a
buffalo being in the
locality, gins and
children congre-
gate, and, when-
ever possible, seek
safety at the near-
est white man’s
camp. Only the
most stalwart
bucks w r ill venture
out, carr y i n g
bundles of keenly-
sharpened spears;
but on seeing a
grey or black-look-
ing stump standing
in the forest which
lr ad not be e'n
noticed before, they drop their weapons and
with blood-curdling yells run until exhausted
or the protection of their white “caramba”- is
secured.
"Bouragi"; A recent Bulletin yarn re-
called the unnerving submarine experience
of a Broome (W.A.) diver. lie and a ihate
found what seemed to be an empty diving-
suit on the sea bottom. Ilis mate went up
with the boots, etc., and he followed with
the helmet and corselet. Half-way up he
glanced through the helmet-glass, and a white
skull grinned back at him. He arrived at
the top without liis find, and disinclined to
go after it again. Several old Brdome
hands recalled that a Jap diver had been
lost in the locality of the find over a dbzen
years previously. Ilis lines and pipe jsud-
denly parted, and that was all anyone knew
of the occurrence in spite of careful search.

“M.U.”: For skin-trouble in his Persian
cats I would advise “C. 8.” (B. 26/8/’26) to
try dabbing the infected parts with an equal
mixture of iodine and methylated spirit. I
have tried this cure with dogs and cats re-
peatedly, and in every case it has proved a
great success. The lotion should be applied
twice a week, using a bit of wadding for the
purpose. The animals ought to be shut up
when this is done, as it is rather painful. A
friend of mine had three Persian eats all suf-
fering with skin-trouble, and used neat kero-
sene on them. They hid for three days in
the bush by, but it completely cured
them. lodine is less painful.
“Fitzjay” : The disorder amongst “C.B.’s”
cat family would appear to be eczema. If
the infected parts are inflamed and there
are tiny molecules on the skin, and if as the
infection spreads a sticky discharge is seen,
he can be quite sure it is such. Eczema re-
sults from change in dietary, and “C. 8.”
should ascertain what food Tom was used to
with previous owner and revert to it.
Use an ointment consisting of sublimated sub
phur one part, carbonate of potash half part,
vaseline six parts.
* * * *
“The Jostler”: If “Lilv Beale” (B.
12/8/’26) looks in the pockets of Bob Flood’s
waggon he will probably find a “jingler.” All
successful silent bullockies carry one. A
heavy dog chain will do, but a small cable
chain long enough to wrap round the ribs of
the off-side bullock and finish under his
belly with a “click” that lifts him off his
feet, is perfection. “Lil’s” gentlemanly
drivers who never carry a bullock-whip or
speak crossly to their oxen didn’t come in
with the motor-lorry. They “cut the track”
011 t^ie -B° ur be and Barcaldine
(JM.b.Vv.) roads 40 years ago, with half a
ton behind each bull and spokes half deep
in sand. Barcaldine was a place for “show-
ing off" a good team, as the pull was always
heavy. Young fellows, all dressed up, and
carrying a hammer-headed hunting-crop for
a whip, would call on their leader in the
main street. “Go again, Golden!” and folk
would marvel at the manner in which the
bull responded to so polite a request. Tom
Gilbeam, who could make his “jingler” crack,
would call on any bullock, bar the leaders,
you chose to select in his team, and bet a
pound he would pull till he shifted the load
—or bellowed. No good bullock-team was
ever educated on kindness. Like children,
they must be punished, but only when they
deserve it. A dose of the “jingler” stops
with them for a long time, but the everlast-
ing cracking and flicking of a whip only
breeds rogues and rushers.
* * * *
“U.A.Q.”: If not an egg-laying record, this
must be near one. A Waimate (M.L.)
lady purchased at the local markets a duck
for a bob. The duck was intended for the
following Sunday’s dinner, but as she cele-
brated her first night in the new home by
laying an egg, the execution was held over
until eggs had ceased to arrive. On the
assumption that an egg a day would pro-
bably keep the chopper away, she continued
to regularly supply her breakfast quota,
and has now completed 365 days without
a miss.
* * * *
“Jim Domino”: Like “Up North” (B.
26/8/’26) I have frequently seen sheep and
cattle on the road mourn for their butchered
mates. On one trip I was travelling from
Queensland into N.S.W. with 10,000 wethers,
and every night for 10 weeks a plaintive bleat
would come calling through the night, indi-
cating that a lonely jumbuck was seeking his
cobber, slaughtered that evening to feed
our family of 10.
* * * *
“A. Borig”: The efficacy of electricity
applied direct to the soil as a fertilising or
forcing factor seems to be more or less
accepted, but there is another side to this
which may not have been noticed by mem-
bers of the council. In wireless and radio
activities applied electricity is the chief fac-
tor. Now, I know of three places in country
districts where wireless is installed. Instead
of erecting poles for the aerial wire, pine-
trees are utilised, and in each instance the
tree has died since the wireless was intro-
duced. In another case a pine-tree near
to a 60ft. aerial pole is dead, and another
pine-tree, 150 ft. away, to which the aerial
is attached is also a corpse. In one case
there is a catalpa, or white cedar, growing
close to a now dead pine-tree, but it is not in
any way affected.
HITHER COULD DO IT.
A[?]: “I hear poor George was shot in
Melbourne yesterday.”
JACK: “Gun or bottle?”
“'Spadger”: Can any Abo. reader explain
why, for the first time in the history of
Monaro, slight wounds and scratches have
this winter failed to heal? Usually a few
applications of zinc ointment or Friar’s
balsam will, in this climate, heal quite a bad
cut; but in the last few T months I have met
at least a dozen people with incipient blood
poisoning arising out of some simple scratch.
1 w T as myself a victim, and after much use-
less poulticing showed my finger to a doctor,
who laughed and held up his own bandaged
thumb suffering from the same trouble. The
carbolic lotion he gave me cured the wound,
but I would like to know if there is any
scientific explanation of what appears to be
more than a series of coincidences. Don’t
tell me it is the frost getting into the wounds,
because the frosts this year have been very
few and light.
THE GARDEN EVERGREEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Far away from tiie camp-lines, leisure-taking,
Treading a road through Kent at morning’s blaze,
Gardens old in the early springtime waking,
Wrens in the chestnut-leaves sweet stanzas making
Stirred my pulse to a rhyme of fervid praise.
Kim and maple and onk, young leaves displaying.
Flashed white dew to the glances of the sun.
Fragrance borne on (lie morning zephyrs straying,
Hawthorn buds on the hedge-tops gently swaying
Straight from my heart a due thanksgiving won.
Kong ago, when the storm of war was brawling,
Cast on the tranquil shores of peace again,
Gladly I heard the apple orchards calling,
Dreamed in the shade when plundered blooms were
falling
Out of the trees while summer held her reign.
Lilac scent and wings of the skylark led me
Down the old ways on many a rambling quest....
Winds of a cloudy autumn midnight sped me
Under the beechen-leaves whose branches shed me
Leaves to carpet the paths my footsteps pressed.
Strife and storm again and a chill wind screaming.
Thrashing the leafless elms beside the road,
Bending the poplars set for summer dreaming—
Naked blades by the weathered trunks were gleaming,
Sleet rained thick on the rubble stones I strode.
Ghastly dawn and a garden torn asunder,
Spattered with winter mire in war’s red wake.
Far afield was the fitful growl of thunder-
Scant the promise of springtide’s 'golden plunder—
Dearth of pollen for restless bees to take.
Long ago, when the northern guns ceased brawling,
Wind from the south welled soft and sweet and
cleau.
Beacon stai’s awoke while the dusk was falling;
Daylight broke to the magpie voices calling
Pilgrims home to a garden evergreen.
Back on the slopes that lift from sunlit spaces,
Home blooms brighter at each new spring’s com-
mand.
Hope reigns aye through the seasons’ glooms and
graces,
Grants me ever the light of comrade faces
Here in the garden of my native land.

More Power
& a Cleaner Engine
CROSS is a highly-refined POWER kerosene,
specially proportioned for use in Tractors.
Owing to its exceptional volatility Cross provides
complete combustion. This not only guarantees
all the fuel consumed being converted into
power, but ensures a minimum of unburnt
kerosene portions escaping into the crankcase
to impair the lubricating properties of the oil.
For sheer pulling power and
freedom from engine trouble
use Cross Power Kerosene.
A New Perfected Tractor Oil
To meet the abnormal lubricating condi-
tions which are peculiar to Farm Tractors,
SHELL TRACTOR OIL *B-
is a heavy*bodied oil which forms a
better piston seal, and successfully resists
the breaking-down effect of kerosene fuel.

Our old friend Chaucer drops us a wireless
to say Summer is icumen in, and lie is
backed by the clothes conspirators, who are
Idling their plate-glass Edens with highly-
priced trifles which bear the Paris stamp,
but don’t mention how many francs went to
tiie pound when they were bought. The sun-
shades are irresistible. They are of French
cretonne (it has something of the quality of
coarse grass lawn) gaily patterned in Russian
ballet colorings, and have a leaning towards
the bluey-green and rathe primrose of
spring in tlieir groundwork. Another thing
worth noticing among last week’s show was
a model of extreme simplicity made of crepe
de Chine thickly strewn with views of Paris,
after the manner of the Chinese-printed
crepes and silks. The visit-to-Paris. material,
it is said, originated in the brain of Ralph
Bart on, the artist who illustrated “Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes.” What cooltli and charm
might surge even into the clammy soul on
a February day if the body were encompassed
with views of the harbor, the little beaches
and the outer foreshores thereof!
Evening frocks, so a girl just from Lou-
don says, are now named after dances,
instead of being romantic and horticultural
as they were last year. Your Charleston
can be as vampish as you please, but Waltz
should be a dreamy and ethereal affair and
a Two-step probably a pair of chiffon plus-
fours. A new throat idea is a tight neck-
band of diamente with a large tulle rosette
behind one ear and long ends hanging down
the back.
The Society of Artists opened its show
at the Education Galleries in the grand
manner with a private view. This you took
on Thursday any time between ten and five,
and you could absorb impressions in a purely
confidential manner, muttering your criti-
cism into the pages of your catalogue, or in
company with boon companions. The last
was the method adopted by most, and there-
fore the remarks were free and flowing
rather than guarded. Of one wide and free
composition a mere Philistine said that it
looked as though run up overnight, adding
the apostrophe: "Build me a three-ply man-
sion, O my soul!”
There had been an artists’ midday meal
a the Australia, and the brush brotherhood,
filled with cheer, etc., inhabited large areas
w , 1 "' tw° galleries. Of course president
ii 2' Ure Smith was in evidence, a grey-
clad figure against a delicate background of
his own etchings—though that was quite
unconscious on his part. Lambert posed
under his portrait of George Judah Cohen,
though rhe go-to-be-pleased visitor infinitely
preferred his tulip piece. Albert Collins
stood m a corner gloating over the gains
lh.it are to be his from an excursion

sions carried away from the show. It is in

lormed a bodyguard in his honor—l 3 banking

have sat so serenely through the evening.
Ihe Bankers Ball, with the regularity of an
annual bnlange, had come round again and
Jo'o/V h •"' !• boys from the city banks
piggleo their figures m an ecstasy of enjoy-
ment under the very eyes of their chiefs.
Mrs. G. V. Oldham and Mrs. 11. T. Armitage
did the honors, and said the word which
gives the Governor the right to raise his
hat to another bunch of Sydney’s prettiest
girls. Gold lace and gold tissue were cun-
ningly wrought into a garment worn by Mrs.
Harry Dransfield; Mrs. Clifford Hay walked
in grace and black georgettes heavy with
jade embroideries; and Mrs. Charles Walker,
the social organiser for P.A.H., was among
the throng happily combining satisfaction,
jade velvets and silver tissue. Prince Alfred
is the hospital which benefits by this annual
outburst, and secretaries Penn and Swallow
not to mention the chairman, Mr. Ord. com-
puted that this year’s celebration will’bring
in about £6OO.
The Royal Colonial Institute was more
like a steaming censer to Flora the other
afternoon than a sedate house in the decor-
ous shadow of the Union Club. Its bedeck-
ing with fragrant herb and bloom was to
honor the Hugh Denison couple, who have
been to it fairy godparents. This was the
institute s final party which the Knight will
grace before the Gold Coast and the Statue
ot Liberty greet him, and the reception-
rooms and passages still have bulges where
the crowd pressed hardest. The lady, who
had the appearance of peeping over a hedge,
so numerous were the bouquets presented
to her, wore soft green, shrouded in black
muons, and millinery that had climbed down
two storeys and was fiat and black and
altogether delectable. Her tie Kelly arranged
the music that threaded the afternoon, and
his efforts gained melodic support from
Nancy Marsden and Amy Mallett.
The gee-gees of the North Shore lino held
quite a corroboree at Killara Park on Satur-
day afternoon. Every cubic inch of horse-
flesh between Milson’s Point and Hornsby
had apparently been trotted to the gymkhana,
and early in the afternoon the hunt was in
full cry after the sixpence and shilling that
arc to make the Royal North Shore Hospital
a bigger and a better institution, if that is
possible. Besides the sports on horseback
there was a great huckstering at gaily awn-
inged stalls that vied for attention with
newly-washed tree and shrub. There were
chocolate-wheels and cocoanut-shies doing
brisk business to the inspiration of brass
bands, while such characters as Captain
Cook, Red Indian chiefs and Marcus Super-
bus wandered as harmless as boy scouts
among ice-cream floes.
Herewith a picture of artist Marjorie
Srnyth. whose little glimpse of St. Jean do
Java in th e
present Society
of A-r t: isi: s’
show is at-
tracting a lot
of attention.
Marjorie, who
is just back in
Sydney after
ye ar s in
America and
Paris, has her
studio on the
top floor of
the old Burde-
kin home in
M a c q uarie-
street. Here

France an d
the Austrian

Paris and in
Homo the Australian girl studied her art, and
went to the Tyrol for the winter sports.
Here outstanding among the groups of tour-
ists constantly arriving were, parties of Ger-
man girls and boys who had walked all the
way from the Fatherland, part of it on
skis and snowshoes. Marjorie, who ex-
hibited at the last Autumn Salon, has the
joy of knowing that her corner of the Luxem-
bourg Gardens is now adorning the walls
of a well-known French buyer. In Paris
she shared a studio with Myril Bowman
(now Mrs. Lloyd), another Australian, who
deserted her paint-box for clay, and is now
a promising sculptor.
The profits from the first birthday party
of the Society of Women Writers will benefit
the T.B. soldier: the successful growth of.
the company of penwomen was celebrated
at the Golden Shower rooms by a midday
cutlet. The tables were a rhapsody in daffo-
dil tones, from the artistic gold and white
check cloths to the yellowy baskets brimful
of fruit, golden and rosy. Among the mighty
sat president Mrs. Baverstock and original-
organiser Mrs. Aronson. Mrs. Fothering-
harne, too. Mrs. Salmon and Mrs. William
Macleod sat tightly wedged where all the
world could see. ‘‘Bill” Gullett. Mrs. Gaynor
and Mrs. Liddell, with the fragilely-pretty
Miss Hamilton, of Brisbane, were others who
sat in the prow.
Agnes Murphy’s note from London:—
Olga Nethersole, whose performances on the Aus-
tralian stage aroused no end of interest over 30
years ago, has taken up the cause of the English
girls whom Lady Duff Gordon, the fashionable
dressmaker, Sybil Thorndike and others have
declared to be the worst dressed in the world. “It
might have been true a dozen years back,” says Miss
Nethersole, “but not to-day. Modern dress, when not
carried to extremes, is delightful, and I think
Englishwomen are among the best dressed in the
world.” My own experience of the past 20 months,
which has given me the opportunity of personal
observation in Monte Carlo, Paris, Loudon, Rome
and other great cities of England, France, Italy
and Spain, is that there are more well-dressed
women to be seen in Sydney and Melbourne than
in any of the old centres. American women of
fashion are now much more individualistic in their
dress than their sisters in Paris, London or Aus-
tralia ; but the travelling American woman—her
numbers are now legion—may no longer be picked
out by her spick-and-span neatness and the general
trinmess of her attire. She too often wears slopoy
ready-to-wears, such as were hardly anywhere ob-
tainable in the States before the war.
The pretty girl in the picture is Paulette
McDonagh, one of three enterprising sisters
who have writ-
ten, acted and
produced their
own film. It
will be flashed
upon the
.screen of
Prince Ed-
ward’s this
( T li u rsday)
morning to an
audi e n c e of
the trade, the
theatrical pro-
fession a n d
admi r e r s of
these three
devotees of the
"Do it your-
self” gospel.
Sir Dudley de
Chair will be
a front-seater
at the six-reel
story of love
and life framed in Sydney's most exquisite
views. Tliis is how the interesting drama was
made. Paulette, the one alongside, had
taken a course in scenario-writing, and had
sold three of her stories to American pro-
ducers. Isabel, who plays the heroine, had
already had experience in various Austra-
lian films. Phyllis, the baby sister, has a
flair for publicity; and the three of them
inhabit a handsome old convict-built home
up Drummoyne way. This home had been
packed by their father, the late Dr. Mc-
Donagh, with antiques and art treasures.
So plot, place, heroine and herald being
gathered together, the adventure had to
begin. Resides a cast of professionals and
a professional producer, some well-known
Sydney people move through the story—Mrs.
Trefle is the mother and Shad Saxby, the
big chief of the undergrads., takes the part
of the doctor.
Doris Monie put St. Philip’s in a good
temper for the week. On Monday morning
she was waiting on its doorstep, an attrac-
tive figure in champagne-toned georgette's
and laces, to marry William Cooke, who is
third officer on the Maloja. A picture hat
that fluctuated from ivory to deep primrose
tones was worn instead of a wreath and
veil, and her flowers were massed into a coy
little muff of pansies, primroses and forget-
me-nots. The marine touch was in evidence
in the floral decorations at the Wentworth,
where a miniature Maloja in primroses and
pansies was moored on the bride’s table. The
wedding-cake, too, carried an anchor on its
top deck. Bride’s mother, Mrs. S. J. Monie,
did the honors in black .georgette and a hat
of pastel tones.
Another son of the late Professor Ander-
son Stuart contemplates matrimony. This
time it’s Archibald Anderson, and liis bride-
to-be is the widow O’Callaghan. Her first
name is Margaret, and her previous husband
was a lieut.-commander.
Frederick Mewton, tin; organist at St.
Andrew’s, who has given Sydney many thrills
with the beautiful Sunday recitals of his
choir, stirred the city tragically last Satur-
day night by dropping dead even as with
baton raised he was directing a perform-
ance of “Merrie England.” As the soprano
was singing “O Peaceful England” the con-
ductor crumpled up, and that peace which is
eternal had enfolded him before the ambu-
lance could traverse the distance between
Anthony Horderns’ welfare hall in George-
street and the Sydney Hospital. Ilis little
daughter Patricia was, unfortunately, in the
audience. Besides being conductor of the
Hordernian Society Mr. Mewton had been
director of the Sydney Madrigal Society ever
since 1923, when he arrived in Sydney from
Melbourne.
.Still another reason for breaking open
the children’s money-box ! The Crown-street
Women’s Hospital is in urgent need of
£l5OO. Further communiques later.
Heart failure following an operation for
appendicitis last Week caused the death of
the wife of Dr. Hampton Cahill, of Bun-
darra. Before marriage she was Gwen
Wheat Roberts, a daughter of the late J.
Whear Roberts, an old Bulletin writer,
noted for her fair good looks and a fine
contralto which she used in singing for many
Sydney charities.
Daphne Deane will lead her pupils in an
interpretation of the Classic Ballet at the
Conservatorium on the 28rd. Misha Bur-
lakov, who is said to have been through
many tribulations since he danced before
the Czar as a member of the Imperial Rus-
sian ballet, will partner the principal dancer
in her special numbers.
Among those from Sydney who kept an
eye on George King and Mary Queen at
the last Garden Party were the E. J.
Carrolls. When they return before Christ-
mas it will be with a handful of theatrical
winners, but without eldest son Ted, who has
taken such a liking to Winchester school
that he has asked to stay on for three years.
The baby of the family, a dinkum Austra-
lian, eyes education in England with cold dis-
favor, and ticks off each day with one remark,
“We’ll soon be going back now, won’t we?"
The Conservatorium orchestra is working
like a thing possessed to be in readiness for
Saturday night’s concert, when with Back-
haus as pianist it will present Beethoven’s
concerto in G major. The second concert of
this farewell season will be on Tuesday,
when the big work will be the Schumann
concerto in A minor.
Death has come to one of the people closely
associated with the Hodgson divorce suit, the
mother of petitioner R. V. Hodgson passing
out last week. Bitterness between the
daughter-in-law and the lady was cited as
one of the matters which led to the extra-
ooinarily expensive suit. The worry hastened
the elderly lady’s death.
Miss Brisbane’s harvest of happenings
Rose-tinted bougainvillea against dark curtains
with a dim religious light suited to the Muse
decked the stage in All Saints’ Hall for the lecture
on Modern Poetry given by Dr. It. A. McKenzie,
of Melbourne. Mrs. P. J. Symes, in cloth of gold
with kingfisher-blue touches and diamond and emerald
jewellery' recited poems of Masefield, Rupert Brooso,
Hardy, Chesterton and Walter de la .Mare, and
Mrs. Forrest’s “Landing at Gallipoli.” Mrs. Hench-
man played the piano and Mrs. Nettheiin the violin ;
and Dr. de Montchaux gave some Chopin and Brahms.
There was a big roll-up, including the Lieut,-Gov-
ernor Lennons.
The officers of the Orestes waxed the floor for a
dance on the boat; and Beryl Carvosso spread the
trayclotli for Everil Merson at Frascati’s. Pro-
gressive mah jongg passed the hour, and the winner
gave the prize to the guest of honor, whose marriage
will be this week. Blue and gold and many Iceland
poppies decorated the room —blue birds and stars,
and a golden ball which spilled petals over the
company after Everil had been properly toasted.
Beryl Carvosso wore an Oriental ninon, her mother
was in black inarocain, and the bride-elect in .fancy
crepe de Chine.
leva Lucas is to be married soon, and teas are
being poured from many pots for her. Mrs. Thro
Sparkes was one hostess, at Wahroonga, in a setting
of sweet-peas and poppies, the hostess being in pink
and blue, and the guest of honor in pink-patterned
chiffon.
For their anniversary the Y.W.O.A. had a shivoo
at Bowen-terrace. Flowers were sold and afternoon
tea dispensed, and it; was announced that enough
money had been raised for the painting of the
seaside home at Southport.
Bernard J. Mullan, elder son of the Attorney-
General, took Catherine Murphy, of Blaekall Range,
into his keeping at St. Michael’s and All Souls’,
Toowong, among arum-lilies and sweet-peas. The
bride was in ivory georgette, with a Brussels-lace
veil and sheaf of arum-lilies. May Mullan, in
pink, ’maided. The Belle Vue, dressed up in pink
ribbons and orange-blossoms, saw the feasting.
Marie Burke and the rest of the gav company
leave Brisbane on Tuesday, and Dal Monte is the
next event at His Majesty’s. Meanwhile, Morris and
Moon have a. very laughable revue on at the Empire.
There are two new florists in Queen-street, and boats
from Bribie way rock in laden with beautiful
wild flowers, despite the comparatively dry season
and the unseasonable coldness of. September.
Mrs. K. L. Paine hostessed the tea at the test
match betwixt N.S.W. and Queensland at Yeronga
bowling-green. Banana fronds, bougainvillaea, and
Iceland poppies did the decorating. The H. Moores
entertained at the Toowong green, with roses, ger-
beras and sweet-peas on the tea tables.
The Women’s Club broke out into blossomry at
its annual show, and Mrs. Agnew Jackson, who is
going to live in Sydney, was farewelled. Red roses
and fern were presented to her by Mrs. Wedd, and
Martha Burns spoke a pleasant piece.
Old Jinghi Jinghi station, in the Jondowae dis-
trict, which must have seen its half-eentury, if not
more, was decorated for the wedding of Eaton
Webster, of England, to Grace Mary Bassing-

Brisbane wants its civic head to he a Lord Mayor
and won’t be pacified till somebody does something
about it. Aldermen declare that the municipality
has not only the largest area but also the largest
population under the rule of one council in Aus-
tralia; plain Mayor Jolly claims to have more
subjects than the Lord Mayors of Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Adelaide rolled into one. And there’s
a Royal Duke coining.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
Saturday was a day on wiiicli one break-
fasted in spring and bare arms, lunched in
winter and a fur coat, repented of the fur
coat a little later, dined to an accompaniment
of torrential rain, and found the fireside the
best place at which to spend the rest of the
evening. Consequently, though there was a
big crowd at the Moonee Valley races, it
didn’t flaunt finery of the sub-tropical order
to any great extent. The tailored suit was
mostly favored; and some smart specimens
were seen. Those with pleated skirts of
plaid material, with a harmonising all-one-
color coat, made on smoking-jacket lines,
were most effective. Ann Willis, Laura llis-
kens and Jean Mcllarg were a trio of the
younger set whose, well-cut suits were place-
getters. Mrs. Rutherford, who used to hi'
Audrey Dickenson, was there with her new
husband, whom she married overseas. She
displayed the latest in topcoats in pale grey
tweed, covering a frock of bois-de-rose
touched up with navy, which harmonised with
her straw hat. Mrs. W. M. Robins, who
wore all black with a touch of parma violet,
was accompanied by her daughter, Mrs. Nor-
man Price,; and Henry Schwieger, the Royal
Show secretary, was having a ’busman’s holi-
day with the geegees, along with his wife.
The Latin Quarter flavor has a lot of seduc-
tion for a lot of people, so Melbourne now
has its Moulin Rouge. They’ve changed the
color and i»ut the name into English—“ The
Green Mill"—but it's a place where one is
not only allowed but expected to Charleston.
It used to be known as Wirths' Olympia, and
was a dismal sort of a barn, but the decora-
tors and the electricians have done wonders
for it. There’s a floor that will take about
1500 couples—if they don’t kick too viciously
—and the trimmings are elaborate. You
enter under the mill, with its wheel, and find
yourself in a Dutch village, complete with
canal, cascade, rustic bridge and white-
wash. The dwellings form tearooms, dressing-
rooms and such. Overhead is a realistically-
painted sky. In the big ballroom three tiers
of boxes rise to a Dutch skyline with trees
in silhouette, and roads that lead over the
hills and far away. Fred and A. LT. Matear,
who have interests in pastry and pictures,
are in this venture, with Tom Carlyon. About
5000 souls crowded into the building on
the opening night, and there were wild scenes
at the entrance. Marie Tait, in soft drapery
of pink georgette, gave an exhibition of the
Charleston with Frank Alderson, and 16
girls from Jennie Brenan’s academy danced
in shaded pink-flounced skirts to the admira-
tion of all beholders.
Members of the English-Speaking Union
to the number of 70 have been to see the
Federal capital. The pilgrims, who re-
turned on Saturday, travelled in special
trains at excursion rates, and Commissioner
Clapp evidently gave the chef a hint, for
the travellers speak of their experiences in
the dining-car with reverence. Mrs. Alys
Gipps, who is hon. organising secretary of
the Common Interests Committee of the
E.S.U., with her husband, who secretaries
the whole concern, managed the pilgrimage.
There were no dull moments, for when there
was no tour of inspection to be made the
residents were extending hospitable hands.
Tean Rae Campbell, only daughter of the
Francis Campbells, of Tumbarumba, a very
handsome brunette, tall and willowy, turned
up at the Toorak kirk the other evening.
She carried a sheaf of lilies against gold lace
and lame trappings, and was the 10th to
screen her blushes behind a wonderful rose-
point lace veil lent by Miss K. Macartney.
The ’maids were Dulce, daughter of Mrs.
Charles Cunningham (N.S.W.), and Marie,
of the Donald Mackinnon tribe. Both wore
brown mile hats with eaped frocks of pale
ajiricot georgette. The small daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. Hugh Murray, frilled in pink
georgette and val. lace, was trainbearer.
Muriel Campbell, of the Albert-street Con.,
who is a cousin of the bride, came in ivory
satin and crystal beading, and played the
Fritz Hart settings for violin of some Bach
choral preludes during the signing-up. There
were rejoicings afterwards at No. 9. when
congratulations were showered on Herbert
A. Daniel —it was his wedding, too. Mrs.
Francis Campbell hostessed in a black glis-
tening gown and black picture hat. and Mrs.
G. Geary, of Sydney, mother of the bride-
groom, was attractive in cosmos pink with
tracery in pink and crystal embroidery. The
wedding-cake bore polo emblems, a tribute
to the prowess of the newly-made husband,
who skippers Goulburn’s doughtiest quar-
tette.
Lights twinkled amid the romantic tur-
rets ot lay Creggan, the Mortills’ home
at Hawthorn, when a welcome-back dance
was given in honor of Mrs. W. Agar and her
professor husband. Betty and Mary Rose,
two English nieces who came with the
wanderers to have a peep at Australia, were
included in the greeting. Tay Creggan is
supposed to be a replica of a baronial pile
in the Cold Land. ’Tis a place full of oak
panelling and massive rafters, and there is
even a secret room, reached through a sliding
panel. If there were only a moat, a dungeon
and a ghost, the place would be perfect. The
hostess’s leaf-green frock, crystal-embroi-
dered, was worn beneath a cloak of the same
hue of chiffon velvet. Mrs. Agar’s gown of
royal blue likewise sparkled. Painter Harry
McClelland and his sister Nan ; Esther Pat-
erson Gill and her husband, Dr. and .Airs.
A. Lodewyckx, the J. IT. Keatings and Dr.
Frank Apperly were others who used the
floor.
After an absence abroad of two years Mrs.
Russell Gabb returned last week with her
two daughters, Marie and .leaniie, who have
come back grown up. Their education was
finished off at a school in Switzerland, and
before leaving the Old World they were pre-
sented at Court along with their mother.
There was a tea-drinking at London's Carl-
ton in the Australians’ honor when they left.
The Women s Automobile Club threw its
social throttle wide open one afternoon last
week, and put up a record in the way of
bridge-playing, tea-drinking and music-mak-
ing for the Children’s Hospital building
fund. President Mrs. 11. ,1. Robertson and
Eflie Ball directed the revels.
Mrs. John Adamson, Mrs. W. Angliss and
Mrs. F. C. Anderson, who have east benevo-
lent eyes upon the Tweddle Hospital and
School of Mothercraft, united forces in run-
ning a very successful dance at the Embassy
to strengthen the institution’s sinews of war,
some of the younger set lending a hand with
ticket-selling and other such tasks. Mrs.
J. T. Tweddle blessed the affair with her
presence, in a gown of pale amber tone with
gold lace embellishment.
Julius Grant is on his way home via
America, and the King's Theatre staff hopes
to see him in November. Lie and brother
Albert, .bachelors both, successfully withstood
Britain’s million unattached women. The
paucity of good drama in England left them
sorrowful, hence the determination to cross
the Atlantic in search of plays likely to tickle
the Australian palate.
The influence of St. Paul, who regarded
woman as an unavoidable nuisance, was
found to be as strong as ever at the last
Anglican Synod, when the laymen down-and-
outed for the umpteenth time a proposal to
allow women to be elected to the governing
bodies of the church. Dr. Booth, whose wife
is a shire councillor, condemned the views
held by the majority as “antiquated, unintel-
ligent and un-Cliristian,” but the other lay-
men weren’t abashed, though none know
better the extent to which church activities
depend on women's support.
The dark-eyed lass whose crowning glory
is intact, though worn in a halo of plaits, is"
Coral Tre n-
err y, whose

is so well liked
that everyone
looks pleased
when she
marches on to

platform with
her violin.
The mysteries
of the instru-
ment on which
every note is
li and- made
were revealed
to her by the
late Marshall
Hall at the
Albert - street
Con., where
she gathered
fi v e scholar-
ships. For
two years she toured N. S. Wales and this
State with her fiddle, and now spends much
of her time teaching it at Scotch College and
other centres of sport, learning, etc. Siie
has entered into a musical partnership with
pianist Rita Hope (Mrs. Percy Shier), who
learnt her art from the great Leschetizky,
and the two players will give a recital at the
Assembly Hall on September 29.
News of another engagement has blown
over from London. Squadron-leader Cham-
pion de Crespigny, M.C.. D.F.C., son of the
Philip de Crespignys, of this city, has in-
duced Sylvia Ethel Usher, daughter of the
Rev. Robert and Mrs. Usher, of Fovant
Rectory, Salisbury, to make him happy.
Sydney Meyers is about to make his home
in America, and his wife won’t be sorry.
Now there’s a small family and a retinue of
nurses continual travelling has become a
nightmare.
Isabel Handley is busy just now stuffing-
fat into the role which G. B. Post shows a
disposition to make his own in her play “The
Mandarin Coat.” She hopes to have the
required alterations made in time to send the
manuscript to South. Africa by the next
mail. By the way, though G.B.P. was asked
while iu Melbourne to read this play, which
had been produced by the Melbourne Reper-
tory Theatre Players, it was not until he
was in Sydney, where he dipped into stacks
of pieces that didn’t suit him, that he
glanced at her effort. He then asked the
playwright to go to Sydney to talk over the
alterations that would be required to make
it a Post play. As a child Miss Handley
was on the Firm’s pay-sheet, but she has
now found a niche of her own as a writer
and producer.

lie has just gone back to Europe, for the

The passing of that unnatural and fear-
some being, the elocutionist, is at hand.
Nowadays verse and sucli-like literary inven-
tions are “spoken” in the best circles, and
gestures are abolished. Carrie Haase was a
pioneer of the new cult, and it is being car-
ried on by Eileen O’Keefe, who at a recent
gathering of the Australian Institute of Arts
and Literature introduced 11 bonnie girl-
students who formed her “Speaking Choir.”
In solo and chorus they showed how melo-
dious and soothing the speaking voice can
be made. Francis Thompson’s “The Mak-
ing of Viola,” was one of the happiest offer-
ings-in-unison. W. B. Yeats’s play, “The
Hour-glass,” and “The Old Lady Shows
Her Medals,” by Barrie, were also in the
programme. The four char-ladies in the
Barrie piece did nobly, especially Primrose
Spence and Molly Stanley. Miss O’Keefe's
piece was an address on “The Rhythmic
Speaking of Poetry.” She said Dublin pro-
duces the very best English speakers. But
she’s an O’Keefe.
Anglican circles are beating up help for
the delinquent small boy. It is to take the
form of a home on Phillip Island where the
potential criminal who drifts into the Child-
ren’s Courts will be turned into a useful citi-
zen, if there are the makings of a useful
citizen in him. The proposed home is an
extension of the activities of file Mission of
St. James and St. John, Latrobe-street, and
it is hoping for £20,000.
Tagore’s “Chitra” was presented by
Howard Edie’s pupils in the reception-room
of the Lyceum Club. A full house gave en-
couragement to the performers, Florence
Stach, Greta Callow, Beatrice Touzeau and
Mercy Smith. Mrs. Boyce Gibson, who
knows a lot about Sanskrit, prefaced the
piece with some information about its author.
There were bushels of pretty flowers for the
performers at the end. Tagore’s play, “The
Post Office,” is promised in the near future.
Gertrude Hutton, who is taking her mezzo-
contralto voice to America, sang her fare-
wells to Melbourne on a recent evening,
pianist Rene Morrissy and violinist Coral
Trenerry sharing the task of entertaining the
crowd that rolled up. The singer, whose
dark tresses had a bandeau of the salmon-
pink of her gown, made her greatest appeal
in the Gluck recitative and aria “Che Faro,”
Grieg’s “A Swan,” and Thomas Dunhill’s
“Cloths of Heaven.” Rene Morrissy’s taf-
feta frock of jacaranda-blue bore a big bow
upon a much frilled skirt. She played the
accompaniments unselfishly and well. Her
best offering as a soloist was MacDowell’s
“Keltic Sonata.” but her audience preferred
the more familiar music of a Chopin group,
which earned a double encore. Coral
Tronerry, with gold lace attached to some
strawberry-colored chiffon velvet, got Cole-
ridge Taylor's “Danse Negre” off her fiddle
in spirited fashion. There were bushels of
pretty flowers for all three performers.
When the presswomen were taken out to
Caulfield last year, just before the Cup meet-
ing, to see the improvements, someone re-
marked that the grandstand would be an
ideal place in which to hold a charity enter-
tainment. The seed thus dropped struck
root, and a bridge-party and cafe-chantant
for the Women’s Hospital is announced for
October 26. The Hospital Auxiliary’s Arma-
dale-Malvern branch, whose president is Mrs.
T. A. Tabart, wife of the V.A.T.C. secre-
tary, will run the show. The services of
several J.C.W. artists have been bespoken.
Valentino certainly had ’em on a string.
A bevy of picture-going flappers at Prahran
are wearing black ribbon neckbows in
memory of the sad-eyed sheik.
Melbourne will have yet another Yankee
play to digest when “The Torch Bearers”
is produced at the Palace Theatre by the
Theatre Association on November 9. It’s to
be a matinee performance, and the lion’s share
of the profits will go to the Queen Victoria
Memorial Hospital. The Best lady, with
Mrs. W. M. Robins as her lieutenant, Mrs.
J. Gates as lion, secretary, Mrs. Victor Cos-
griff in charge of tickets, and G. G. Arnoldt
as lion, organising secretary are the engi-
neers of the venture.
Pianist Hilda Roberts has taken up her
earlier love, the harp, again. The Firm has
engaged her to play this charming instrument
in the orchestra for the "Katja” season at
the Theatre Royal.
Madame Beaupuis, of Sydney, being over
this way the other day, some old friends
gave her a dinner at the Astoria, after which
there was music, with songs by Walter Kirby
and some of his students —among them Mrs.
Fleming Dunstan, Aileen Mclnerny, Kath-
leen Rochfort and Ursula Duffy.
Sister Adelaide’s well-filled week:—
A dance at Government House set the ball rolling
for the entertainment of the Australian Fleet, and
the committee responsible for the St. Peter’s College
Mission dance (30 of them, headed by Mrs. Frank
Ilarcus) arranged that for a couple of nights later.
There have been civic receptions, too —at the Town
Hall, where there was meat and drink in the
Mayoress's rooms, and at Port Adelaide. For the
men there has been a picnic of monster size organised
by the Cheer-Up Society, with a cheque from the
Navy League to help things along.
The St. Peter’s dance was at the Palais, with a
supplement of blossom and spring flowers to its
usual decorations, and the gold key that is St. Peter's
College badge as the insignia of the committee. The
Fleet was there in force; Lady Bridges came with
Captain Brook, and other officials included the
Bishop Thomases and the Mayor and Mrs. Bruce. The
Glenclg Sailing Club had its ball oh the same night,
and there, too, was gold braid in plenty, while a
dance at Birkenhead catered for the men.
The South Aus. Orchestra made its last winter
concert largely Wagner, with some modern English
and French numbers by way of contrast. Fred Stone
was the evening’s vocalist. Community singers packed
the Town Hall at their last session, and made a
speech or two by way of celebrating their sixth
birthday. The Conservatorium staff gave an excel-
lent concert in the Elder Hall, at which Clive Carey’s
singing was an outstanding feature. A night or two
previously he sang folk songs delightfully to members
of the United Arts Club, by way of illustrating a
lecture.
Mrs. Thorn, president of the Australian Federation
of University Women, is here on a visit from Mel-
bourne and has been entertained at the Lyceum Club.
The w 7 eek has held two weddings—one at St.
John’s, Hadifax-street, where Hope Rutherford was
married to John, eldest of the Lavington Bonython
sons; and the other at St. Cuthbert’s, Prospect, where
Mollie, youngest of the Charles M. Todd daughters,
became Mrs. Leonard Marriot. Pink and white was
the setting for both weddings, and of the three
bridesmaids at the latter, two were pink-clad and
the other in white with pink roses about her waist
and head. At the Bonython wedding there was pink
in the bride’s frock, too, and the one bridesmaid,
Audrey Cleland, was in pink and blue. The honey-
moon will be in England, and a longish one, for the
bridegroom is due back at Cambridge to finish
the round that undergraduates are expected to follow.
Golfers on the way to Seaton to see Mona McLeod
annex the championship and put up a new record
were caught in the aftermath of a derailment on the
Port line—found traffic held up on the Adelaide side
of Woodville, and had to transfer themselves to
taxis and motors (if they could find ’em) to get
down in time.
The Speck’s wave of progress :
Girl undergrads of the Tas. ’Varsity lately tried
their ’prentice hand at entertaining in what w T as
billed as an Australian Evening. The decorations
were wattle, gum-tips, ferns and other boskage, with
cockatoos, parrots and kookaburras perched amongst
the branches. A camp-fire, a waterhole, an abo. scene
and stumps and logs for seats were additional features
of the evening. A chopping match, a eorroboree,
dances and Australian songs made up the programme.
The first Yellow Cabs have arrived to add a touch
of color to Hobart’s drab streets, and curl) the rapacity
of the town’s old-established Jehus, who have been
allowed to charge what they liked for so long that
they have waxed extortionate.

NOTIONS
Those who have backed Fuji San for the
Epsom were eminently satisfied with his showing in
the Tramway'Handicap, seven furlongs, at Randwick
on Saturday. Equal favorite with Mullabawn at
■> to 1, the big bay jumped out briskly, in spite of
his 9st. 11 lb. and a bad marble, and galloped easily
behind the pacemaking Lady Thrill to the home
turn. There Pike began to drive him along, and,
setting up a big lead within a furlong, the Valais
—Lady San gelding won by two or-three lengths in
Imin. 251 see., which time he could have reduced
had it been necessary. Aorangi (7 to 1), who had
been buried in the ruck most of the way, finished
fast in second place, and the M.L. gelding Cawnpore
was a fair third (his tote supporters collected £7
17s. 6d. for 10s. in the grandstand and £4 IBs.
for ss. in the Leger), Lady Thrill being fourth.
Beauford and Rostrum won both Tramway and
Epsom, and Fuji San has a very good chance of
repeating the achievement, though his Epsom burden
(9st. 91n.) is greater. Wedding live (7 to 1) was
heavily backed, hut was never sighted. Neither was
Mullabawn.
It wasn’t the day for English horses, though (hey
had plenty of support. Vitality, who lias been
backed for the Metropolitan, in which he lias Bsi.
61b., could only run third with 131 b. more to
the moderates, North Logan (16 to 1) and Bacchus
(12 to 1)., in the Novice Handicap, 10 furlongs. Yet
he looked a picture, and the ring reckoned him
such a certainty that it was “evens Vitality, 12. to
1 bar one’’ ,in a field of 22. Bagpipes (7 to 1)
also failed in the Welter, eight furlongs, „iu which
there was a nasty accident (.no infrequent circum-
stance on Sydney courses), Bersur being killed and
Vallino (7 to 1) so knocked about that she had to
be withdrawn from the A.J.C. Derby and all other
spring engagements. The-solid Buchanan (10 to 1),
who has 7st. 2lb. in the Epsom and 2lb. less in
the Metropolitan, got the best of a spirited battle
with the Vic. mare Kanchani, who returned a div.
of nearly 16 .to 1, and that unlucky Queensland animal
The Cause (10 to 1). Murillo (7 to 1) likewise
disappointed Eric Connolly in the Spring Handicap,
10 furlongs, but Larkspur (9 to 2) proved a worthier
representative of England, beating everything but
the little Buckwheat mare Chalder (20 to 1), who
can gallop when in the mood. Larkspur will meet
her on lib. worse terms in the Metropolitan, in which
he has Bst. lib, and she 7st., but he should be
better suited by the extra three furlongs, _as also
should Resource (7 to 2), who was a fair third
after meeting with trouble and then being rushed
up to the leaders too soon.
Though Windbag had galloped indifferently on
Thursday morning, punters freely laid 6 to 4 on
him for the Chelmsford Stakes, nine furlongs,
Limerick being at 5 to 1, Pantheon a point longer,
Rapine at 10’s and the others (Farmer and King
Val) at forlprn-hope odds. The result showed that
more attention should have been paid to that gallop,
for Windbag never once looked like winning. He
was second last, to Pantheon in a strung-out field
when McCarten gave Limerick his head, and the
Maoriland three-year-old sailed into the straight
•with a victorious lead. Windbag, hard ridden by
Munro, made up a lot of ground, but was lengths
behind the unhustled Derby candidate at the finish ;
old Rapine was another three parts of a length away,
and Pantheon, who shifted about a lot, fourth, the.
time being lmin. 52fsec. It is clear now that the
gruelling contest with Yalicare left its mark on
Windbag, who was palpably above himself at War-
wick Farm. However, it is nothing hew for a
good three-year-old with a pull in the weights to
beat the best of the older horses in the Chelmsford
Stakes, and Limerick is undoubtedly good. Being
a light-fleshed customer who probably wont stand
much racing, he will now be reserved for the A.J.G.
Derby, nor will Windbag be seen out again till
October 2.

There were no Heroics or Manfreds at
Moonee Valley (Vic.) on Saturday, and winners
were mostly hard to pick. An exception was T.
Oomvay’s Roseworthy—Longueville gelding Long-
worthy (6 to 2), who, equal favorite with Suomi
for the Budgeree Handicap, 10 furlongs, 6tuck it
out well for Duncan to win by three-quarters of a
length from St. Lazar (S to 1), who was half a
length ahead of the ancient and much-travelled
Llanthony. Longworthy has 6st. 131 b. in the Mel-
bourne Cup and 7st. in the Caulfield Cup, but
backers are not rushing to get on. Clan Robert was
served up hot for the Valley Steeple, miles, but
be never had a hope with Brenda’s Son (5 to 1),
who went to the front soon after the start and set a
pace that quickly had most of the field in trouble.
Brenda’s Son won easily by three lengths from Loch
Eaton (14 to 1), with Clan Robert a very tired
third. The winner is owned by H. and M. Bourke,
trained by W. Burke, and was ridden by Bert
Thompson, who has made a most successful come-
back ; the time, smin. 4sec., was a course record.

The Doncaster St. Leger, oldest of the
three great classics of the English flat-racing season,
was won last week by Coronach. As the chestnut
son of Hurry On—Wet Kiss had previously collected
the Two Thousand Guineas and the Derby, he has
joined the select band of blue-blooded prads who have
won the triple crown (the first was the French horse
Gladiateur in 1865), and has earned £40,000 in
stakes for his owner, Lord VVoolavington, who also
bred him. Coronach’s dam is a daughter of Tre-
dennis, who has several representatives in Australia.
“Thormanby”: No one familiar with the county
was surprised to read that the dead-broke North
Country pitmen, forgetting the strike, were hoofing
it to Doncaster in thousands. Many Yorkshiremen
who have never seen another race make it a point
of duty to be on the Town Moor when the Leger is
run. I knew a Yorkshire parson who attended for
40 consecutive years. The meeting is probably
unique as a municipal enterprise, for the course is
owned, and the show run, by the Doncaster Town
Council. Profits are so solid, though the Town
Moor is an open course, like Epsom, that local
ratepayers are on the free list. The idea of' aldermen
running a race-meeting is rather alarming to students
of the municipal history of Sydney. But, like th’
tosses themselves, aldermen run in all shapes.
* * * *
The enclosure at Liverpool (N.S.W.) last
week was like rough-cast cement. Scratching gravel
in the turns played havoc with the hounds’ feet,
and the various events became endurance matches.
In the first round of the Liverpool Stakes, Vick’s
Pick met the favorite, Confusion, outed him, and
TEACHING THE OLD IDEA.
STOUT PARTY: “Bat I don't know enough about cricket to be
umpire.”
SKINNY: "That's all right, Mister —WE'[?] tell yer wot I' say.”
returned on two legs. Sheen then became favorite,
but Vick’s Pick forgot his injuries when the hare
showed up, and outpaced Sheen. Olorv was the
next choice, but again the outsider triumphed. At
the top of the card, Forest King, also damaged, was
working his way through the stake. The, cripples
came together in the decider, Forest King winning
by inches. The most interesting course of the
meeting was that between Harriett and Shiela B.
in the Fifefield Stakes. Shiela is old enough to
be Harriett’s grandmother, yet the youngster needed
all her legs to beat the ancient, whose last course
it was, and first defeat.
Over 8000 people watched the Sydney
Stadium scrap between Teddy Murton (9st. 21b.)
and Australian champion Billy Grime (9st. lib.),
and fully half of them urged the English pug to
spiflicate their own countryman. Billy is not mug
enough to stand and smash or get smashed, but
depends upon science arid speed, together with clean,
safe hitting; so he is not popular. His bobbing
head and dancing feet fooled the English lad, and
his shooting left rarely missed Teddy’s face, while
it ripped into the body with frequency and _ effect.
He was less successful with the right, owing to
Murton’s guard and lieadwork, and the latter. extri-
cated himself smartly when William had him on
the ropes. At in-fighting Murton excelled, but he
wasted scores of punches on Grime’s back. In the
seventeenth, when the Australian was forcing his
man round the ring, Murton suddenly cried “Oh I”
and went to the floor. He was at once dragged to
his chair and awarded the verdict on a foul. Grime
swears he knocked his man out with a fair solar
plexus punch, but the referee ruled that it landed
too low, and there is no Court of Appeal at Rush-
cutter Bay.
* * * *
There was a £2270 gate at Melbourne
Stadium when Ted Thye (12st. 71b.) and Mike
Yokel (12st. 611 b.) wrestled for “the world’s light-
heavyweight championship,” which Thye claims.
Edward, improving on recent exhibitions (the im-
provement was fully anticipated by McShortodds),
was a good winner, thanks to his ability to turn
dangerous-looking situations to his own advantage.
In the sixth round Mike clapped on a half-arm
scissors, but while his supporters were shouting
“Mike! Mike!” in noisy anticipation of a fall, Ted
turned him over and scored. Followed some edifying
use of the knuckles by Mike, Ted retaliating with
the splits and wrist-locks. Early in the eighth bout
the challenger secured a reverse double leg-hold, which
forced the champion to concede the fall, but in
attempting the same manoeuvre in the ninth round,
Mike was again entangled in his own snare and
pinned. Ted knows too much about the game for
Mike. However, both will be richer in pocket and
experience when they return to their own country.

Gainsford, the St. George (N.S.W.)
harrier, maintained his fine form on Saturday, when
he won the “modified” Marathon at Manly. Never
far from the leaders, he went to the front at the
eleventh mile and broke the tape with 300 yards to
spare from R. Bateman (St. George) and M. J.
Mackenzie (Cumberland), in lhr. 7min. 23 3-10 sec.
The distance was said to be 12 miles, but there
is some doubt about it. Gainsford is not going to
Victoria for the Frankston-Melbourne ,Marathon,
26 miles 385 yards, but. the Ma State will be
represented by Bateman and veteran H. Hayden,
who won a couple of years ago.

Sydney’s rowing season opened on Satur-
day with a regatta staged by Mosman, holders of
the senior and junior rowing championships of
N.S.W. This feat has been equalled only four times
in the past, Sydney winning in r9OB-09, Balmain in
1910-11, and Leichhardt in 1913-14 and 1920-21.
Mosman cleaned up the big event of the day, the
senior eights, from Leichhardt, and will probably
again represent N.S.W. in the inter-State race for
the King’s Cup at Hobart next May. It is a pity
that there is still no sign of any attempt being
made to affiliate country rowing with that in Sydney.
In other States, country clubs have a big share in
the sport.

The Americans
are still too strong for
other nations at lawn
tennis, the French fail-
ing signally at New
York last week. John-
ston whipped Lacoste
and Borotra with the
loss of only one set—
the third, o—6,0 —6, to
Lacoste; Tilden de-
feated Borotra i n
straight sets, and Rich-
aids and Williams like-
wise disposed of Cochet
and Brugnon. Wh e n
the destiny ot the
bauble had been de-
cided, Lacoste over-
came Tilden, 4—6,
6 -4, B—C, B—6, but
William may not have
been all out. Appa-
rently if the Yanks are
ever to be deprived of
the trophy in this gen-
eration, it will be by
Anderson—now rid of
a painful mal a d y
which affected his play
for years —and some
other Australian; per-
haps Hone, if he can
lie induced io take the
game seriously.
“The Gaffer'’: The cables tell of a Finnish
runnel*, a member of the Communist Workers’ Sports
Federation, who lias been stopped from entering in
a “bourgeois” club’s race by threats of assassina-
tion. The owners of sprinting teams in _ North
Queensland, when the game was booming in the
’nineties, rarely went so far as that when a
minion rebelled at running to orders, but had
methods .just as efficacious. A surreptitiously
administered purgative was one (perhaps Mussolini
got the notion from N.Q.) and the mislaying of
pet running shoes at the last moment another.
Sometimes a blistering ointment would be “inadver-
tently” applied instead of the customary rubbing-
down lotion, and in one ease at least —that of an
abo. who ran barefoot —the cinder track was liberally
mixed with out-size drawing-pins. Now and then,
of course, a particular recalcitrant had to be dealt
with in cruder physical fashion, but this was always
deprecated as likely to damage stock-in-trade,
,Collins and co. will return from a tour
where more matches have been interfered with or
ruined by rain than any previous English summer,
except perhaps that of 18Sfi. with but a single defeat
io set against some half a score of victories
and a. couple of dozen draws. This, of
course, is a memorable achievement, but it is not
going to lift the team to a place alongside the
best of its predecessors, the sides of ’B2, ’99, ’O2
and ’2l. Test matches are coming to mean more
and more for Australian teams in England and
minor games less and less —largely because the
increase of first-class counties has inevitably
lowered the county standard—and a side must
now expect to be judged, first and foremost, on
Test results. If a week, or even five days, is set
apart for each Test in future years, it will mean
cutting out a lot of the games against compara-
tively feeble opponents, as well as ensuring decisive
results in the big matches. Meanwhile it can at
least be written of the side led by Collins that it
proved unbeatable in all matches except the final
Test, and that it had the better of one of the two
unfinished Tests that got to the stage where com-
parisons are possible.
Considering that the team lacked a fast bowler
of class, or, indeed, a bowler of class at all except
two slow ones —Macartney could hardly be expected
to excel with bat and ball —it is almost a marvel
that it did so well. Bardsley, Macartney and,
in a minor degree, Collins proved their worth,
although all are by way of becoming veterans;
Woodfull, the youngster, taken all through, did
best of all. Ponsford, perhaps, fell a trifle short
of anticipations, and the same may be said of
Ryder; Andrews and Taylor undoubtedly disap-
pointed. Richardson played very soundly for the
first half of the tour and then, possibly through
overwork, lost his effectiveness. Gregory, while
playing some fine innings, was little or no use as
a bowler, and Everett was an even more negligible
quantity. In the end Mailey and Grimmett had
practically to take the bowling on their shoulders,
and both were destructive enough for everyone but
England’s very best. Oldfield established himself
as the world’s best wicketkeeper, and Ellis was an
efficient understudy. Hendry was hors de combat
through illness most of the time; what his absence
cost the side is impossible to compute.
Exceptionally strong sides were faced in the two
last matches, and there might have been close
finishes but for the depressing weather conditions
of 1926 persisting almost to the end. At Scar-
borough, Thornton’s XI included only one man who
hasn’t played for England, Allen, the Sydney-born
Middlesex amateur. It was an excellent performance
of Grimmett (5 for 68) and Mailey (4 for 53) to
get rid of such a side for 244 (Hobbs 85.. Holmes 50,
,)upp 28. Tvldesley 26), but rain made Thursday
almost a. blank day, and the Australians found them-
selves up against Rhodes and Jupp on a wicket
that, was never easy on the last day. Thanks to
Andrews (42 n. 0.), Macartney (38), Woodfull (31)
and Taylor (27) they were kept out of danger,
but their total was 50 behind that of their opponents.
The home side in their second venture lost 3
wickets for 79 (Sutcliffe 42, n. 0.).
The English XI encountered at Blackpool was
not as powerful as the Scarborough one, but in
Root, Jupp, Parkin, Parker and liilner it had some
troublesome bowlers. Australia, batted first and
Woodfull once again emphasised his quality and con-
sistency. It was mainly his dogged defensiveness
that was responsible for the total reaching 281.
Going to the wickets first, the young Victorian re-
mained undefeated at the close with 116 to his
name. Macartney (32) helped to add 50 for the
second wicket, and Richardson (44) co-operated in
a. stubborn partnership of 99 for the sixth. Parker
took five wickets. The English XI had lost 4 wickets
for 126 when rain stopped play.

Saturday’s Melbourne League 'ball saw
some great games and some that didn’t count.
Geelong, level with Collingwood for first place, but
behind on percentages, had to beat Fitzroy by about
40 points to displace the Magpies, and after an
extra willing game won by 55 —104 points to
’Roy’s 49. Unfortunately the ’Woodsmen had
simultaneously piled up 96 points against Carlton’s
47, which achievement left them still several points
ahead, with the double chance for the premiership.
While these little matters were being settled, South
Melbourne was busting its boiler in an effort to
displace Essendon from fourth place by acquiring
about 40 more points than the “Same Old.” The
Rcd-and-whites might have achieved the almost im-
possible but for wasting chances early in the game
and letting ’Don get too far ahead. They put in
a tremendous last quarter and finally won by three
points—74 to ’Don’s 71 —but that wasn’t nearly
enough, so the same four clubs as last year will
battle out the finals —’Wood, Geelong, Melbourne and
’Don. Of the others, Melbourne beat Hawthorn by
121 points to 78; ’Scray paralysed Richmond, 93
to 49; and St. Ivilda downed North Melbourne, 90
to 71. The last-named team has had rotten luok
through the season. It hasn’t won a. solitary game,
and its only draw was gained by a goal scored after
the bell had rung, yet less than half a dozen points
would have given it victory on six or seven occasions.
“The little more, and how much it is!”

The “fairest and most brilliant” player
in Adelaide football, who gets the Magarey Medal
on the collective vote of the umpires for the season,
is Bruce McGregor, formerly of Broken Ilill. He
plays for West Adelaide, which did not secure a
place in the semi-finals. The first of these was won
on Saturday by Norwood, which beat Sturt by 9
goals 11 behinds to 6 goals 12 behinds. A crowd
of 32,000 saw the minor premiers vanquished.
* * * *
Sydney League’s second semi-final was
easy for South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs being beaten
by 21 (5 tries, 3 goal's) to 5 (a try and a goal).
The heads who follow football with a bundle of
notes in hand were always ready to lay a price
against East. The latter, with a stiff wind behind,
started off at a. great bat, but the premiers led by
five to nil at half time, and thenceforward fairly
ran away from the opposition, their score including-
the unusual feature, for the League game, of a
dropped goal from the field —full-back Righton
kicked it. Veterans Blair and V. Lawrence, in
the backs, and Root- and O’Connor, in the forwards,
were their best four, and Rigney, at full-back, did
good service for the badly-rattled Easterners. South
will meet University in the final next Saturday.
The Metropolitan Soccer competition saw four clubs
left in the semi-finals. Gladesville-Ryde dished Can-
terbury by 5 goals to 2, and Granville downed St.
George, 2 —l. The winners will engage Balgownie
and Balmain respectively next week, with Balgownie
and Granville probably qualifying for the final. The
Aussie-rules premiership went to Eastern Suburbs,
vvhic"h beat Western Suburbs by 46 to 25.

Now this is the time when the punter scans
The weights with appraising eye;
He steeps himself in equine lore,
lie has fancies plenty and tips galore
And promising doubles, a goodly store,
And he says to himself, as oft before,
“Though some may go awry,
In various baskets my eggs I’ll stow,
And I’ve lots of arrows to fit to my bow
And any amount of strings.
In my tussle with Mo I shall get some clouts
And some of my certs will prove wash-outs
And some of my best good things
hi the way of Horse will g'o down, of course,
But what I lose on the roundabouts,
Of that 1 haven’t the faintest doubts,
Will all come back on the swings.
Ho! hoi
I shall rake it in on the swings 1”
Now this is the time when Judah’s clans
Come forth serene and high.
Their bags are crammed with goodly store
Of notes and silver, and loud the roar
Of “Lay the Fee-uld” and “Five to Four,”
And slogans 1 know not how many more
Assail and split flic sky.
For the seasons come and the seasons go
But the young spring lamb must be skinned,
you know,
And between the lusty shouts
That rise and roll from the seething rings
When the stage is set for the Sport, of Kings
(And the trade of tugs and touts)
I hear perforce a whisper hoarse,
A whisper borne on the warm wind’s wings,
“The (rifle we’ve got to lose on the swings
Conies back on the roundabouts.
Ho! ho!
All back on the roundabouts.”

THE INKY WAY.
“H.P.”: Let Fred W. Punshon, proprietor
and editor of the Coleraine (Vic.) Albion, go
into the honor-roll of long-distance pressmen.
He has owned and controlled his weekly
paper since 18S8, and has seen almost every
issue off the machine —he has never been
away long enough to miss two consecutive
issues.
Robert Dunn read his last proof in Bris-
bane last month. He was born in Melbourne
in 1850; after serving his apprenticeship in
the printing trade there he went to the
Wellington (M.L.) Evening Post. His next
job was on the Gympie (Q.) Times ; his last
on the Brisbane Courier, where he remained
for 42 years, first as a compositor, later (and
till his death) as head of the reading-room.
Two of Melbourne's newspapers employ
house-doctors, certificates from whom must
he secured before any member of tiie stan
is granted sick leave. There seems some
reason for the precaution. Recently two
men went sick, without reporting to the
house-doctor, and messengers were sent out
to their homes. One patient was found
painting his house; the other was con-
valescing at the races.
The pen slipped from the fingers of an
old wayfarer when Robert Browne died at
Mullumbimby (N.S.W.). It is over half
a century since the 72-year-old veteran
spiked his first side of copy. That was in
India, and he then went to China. Forty
years ago he came to Australia and worked
for the Age, the S. M. Herald and the Bris-
bane Telegraph, before deciding to become
a country editor. Browne’s specialty was a
knowledge of India and China and their lan-
guages. He also wrote a Fijian encyclopaedia.
Two sons follow in his steps, one on the
8. M. Herald, the other on the Sydney
Telegraph.
“Make Up”: Reference to the passing of
the Sydney Theatre (B. 2/9/’26) suggests
that it’s an unlucky name. There have
been two monthly magazines with this title
at different periods in Melbourne, and both
died lingering deaths. Charles Bradley
edited one, 1889-90, a shilling publication,
modelled on Clement Scott’s London
Theatre. The issue for October, 1889,
which lies before me, contains photos of
Louise Jordan and Clara Cowper ; the articles
were by Maud Williamson, Eillie Norwood
and other pros. Fred Patey, an actor well
known here during the Tittell Brune sea-
sons, and one Tutton were the proprietors.
W. J. Moulton, fired with the success of the
Sydney Theatre, started a threepenny one
in Melbourne in 1905, and it lasted a year
or so.
“Blue Stocking”: There is a Society of
Women Writers in Sydney, and members
met this week to lunch on asparagus soup,
cutlets (two apiece) and other things. Not
one of the crowd seemed to be ashamed of
herself —-not even I, who had just risen from
reading the letters of Lady Louisa Stuart.
She had the writer’s itch badly, but scratched
at her manuscripts of one kind and another
for the best part of 90 years, concealing the
impolite disease even from her own sisters.
She tells the tale of a titled lady who had
travelled widely in India, and was pressed
by some indiscreet friends to publish her
journal, which' they declared to be “vastly
entertaining.” She resisted the temptation,
and later on confessed to her husband the
social sin she had contemplated. “Do you
know,” said she, “I was on the very point
of publishing a book!” The astounded hus-
band answered with emphasis: “I am sure
I would never have married you if you had.”
Perhaps he was wise—who knows?
“Sub”: Every Inky Wayfarer is expected
to read his own journal from title to pub-
lisher’s imprint. Some do. But none read
all the other journals in the town. This
great truth was traded on by the laziest
reporter who ever gave me stuff to blue-
pencil. We used to load him up with all
the foolish questions that were asked by old
subscribers —-whether Anne Green was on
lhe_ passenger list of a sailing-ship that
arrived some time between 1860 and 1870;
who won. the first Derby, and in what coun-
try prohibition was first tried, and that sort
of thing. There never was any burning
hurry about printing an answer, and this
lad of ours, though slow, was sure, and he
seemed to welcome questions that would mean
hours of dusty toil in the file-room. If it
hadn’t been that the editor sometimes read
the correspondence columns of his local com-
petitors to find out if they were turning down
- as they had agreed to do —letters that were
circularised to the whole bunch, we should
never have discovered that our ingenious
young friend was shooting his questions at
the other newspapers and reprinting their
answers.
"O.”: The Argus might, in its 80th year,
be excused for believing that it was the first
newspaper ever published in Melbourne, and
even for saying that “the 11 years between
the establishment of the Port Phillip settle-
ment and the advent of the Argus were un-
eventful.” Actually Melbourne’s first news-
paper was the MS. rag of Johnny Fawkner,
the Melbourne Advertiser, which, having
appeared in January, 1868, was officially
suppressed a few months later because it was
not registered under the strict press laws of
the time. The first legalised paper was the.
Gazette, owned by George Arden, which
appeared on October 27, 1868. The second
was Fawkner’s Patriot, which came to light
on February 16, 1869. George Cavenagh
published the third, the Herald, on January
6, 1840, and in 1844 George D. Boursiquot
started the Standard, which amalgamated
with the Patriot and became the Daily
News in October, 1845. The Melbourne
Argus first appeared on June 1, 1846, and
had a hectic two years of libel actions and
editorial imprisonment, until Edward Wilson
bought the property in 1848 and changed
the name to the Argus. The following year
it became a daily, and for some years had
as competitors the Daily News, the Herald
and the Times (formerly the Gazette). In
1852 there were only two dailies, the Argus
and the Herald. The Argus can at least
say it swallowed most of the earliest Mel-
bourne newspapers. The Fink journal, how-
ever, can claim an earlier direct ancestry
through the Port Phillip Herald.

After all, snobbishness may be the solid
foundation of an ordered society; and the
amusing conceit of the people who are in-
tensely self-satisfied with the small glory of
a J.P.-sliip may lead on to the stability of
our economic fabric. Barrie’s “Admirable
Crichton” is the compleat snob; but lie is
an efficient and likeable person in spite of
it. His disapproval of the artificial-equality
rubbish he meets in the home of the Earl of
l oam has its basic reason in the feeling
that it is only in a state of society with
well recognised social distinctions that: he
can shine with full effulgence as a butler.
On the island, where his usefulness and re-
source make him the leader of the commu-
nity, he immediately hedges his dignity with
the marks of distinction which the soul of
a snob finds necessary; but when normal
conditions return, with the rescue of the
shipwrecked party, his reversion to buttling
is the most natural thing in the world.
Barrie’s whimsical satire is sugared with
rather less than the usual Barrie sentiment,
though, of course, there is heart interest
to run with the humor: and the revival at;
the Sydney Royal, which commenced on
Saturday night, had the benefit of produc-
tion by Dion Boucieault, which is to say
that the staging was superb and the per-
formance polished to the nth degree.
* * * *
Brian Aherne cannot rank with some
other exponents of the Crichton part whom
Australia has seen. He extracted adequate
significance from the demeanor and gestures
of the perfect butler, but his Crichton was
given to unnecessary elocution and lacked
the full authoritative note in the island
scenes. Angela Baddely, apart from an early
over-exaggeration of the gawkiness of the
serving-maid, was a very good Tweeny; and
Mary Hinton found a part which fitted her
as Lady Mary Lasenby. It was easily her
most flowing characterisation. Hubert
Harben’s Earl of Loam and Ronald Ward’s
Hon. Ernest Woolley were outstanding in a
large cast, from which, of the little ones,
Reginald Newson’s Lord Brocklehurst struck
eye and ear very pleasantly.
* * * *
While awed flappers with tear-dimmed eyes
watched spellbound every gesture of their
departed film idol Rudolph Valentino, at the
Sydney Haymarket on Saturday night, an
entirely different audience stamped its feet
and clapped vociferously around the corner
at 75 Ultimo-road. On the second floor of the
four-storeyed building belonging to the Kuo
Min Tang (the Chinese National party) the
Yu Tan Hwa Amateur Company was serv-
ing a four-act drama to a Chinese audience.
Except for a profusion of vividly-colored
silken banners and notices in Chinese about
the walls, the hall, with its rows of hard-
bottomed chairs, was a replica of an ordinary
suburban church hall. It was packed tight, and
mild cabbage-gardeners and laundrymen
mixed with prosperous and insinuating
herbalists and aggressive fireworks importers.

Translated “Er Nu Ying Hsiung” means
“The Two Patriots.” It is a purely political
play, although a smattering of humor in
the way of chants and comic characters is
introduced. In this and other respects the
East goes out and meets the AVest half-way:
AVestern stagecraft, both in the matter of the
construction of the play and with regard to
scenic effects, is followed pretty closely. It
opens with a public meeting in support of
a military expedition against those in control
at Pekin. There is a parade of demonstra-
tors carrying flags, and, later, delegates repre-
senting various sections of the community,
and attired each in the costume typical of
his calling, address the meeting. The political
situation is explained and action against the
enemy advocated. Act ii reveals Chao Kuo-
hun, a cadet, torn between duty and love
for Yi Hsiung-fei. The girl urges him not to
remain with her but to join the Expedition-
ary forces. Incidentally—and here you see
a trace of good old bellowdrama —her argu-
ments cause Tai Pow-wo, a park tout, who
resembles Charlie Chaplin and who has been
“listening-in” from behind a rock, to offer
himself also as a recruit. The third quarter
is given over to a scene between Hsiung-
fei and her ma over Kuo-hun, wherein ma
uses strong words apropos the independence
of the modern Chinese flapper. The breach
is healed and a game of mail jongg is inter-
rupted with news of Kuo-lmn being wounded.
Hsiung-fei, despite ma's protest, dashes off
to become a nurse. All ends happily in the
ward of a military hospital, furnished in
oak, where Ilsiung-fei is ministering to the
needs of Kuo-liun. Word comes through
of the expedition's success. Hsiung-fei’s
mother drops in at the head of a band of
flappers, the wounded rises from his bed
and joins in the cheers, and there are no
snails in the garden.

Although it doubtless contained all the
faults a play can possess, the audience got
what it wanted, and there are a lot of tech-
nically perfect dramas that can’t give audi-
ences that. All the female roles were, of
course, taken by men, and Pin Ilsin and
Chiang Hsiao were the pick of the "ladies.”
Kuo Ivwang, Kuo Liang and Liu Tsai also
earned their after-show supper. Mrs. King,
who sang sentimental ballads, and Miss Pig-
gott, a young clog-dancer, were the only
English performers; and they appeared be-
tween the acts. The gorgeous costumes and
the music were features of the show.

“Rose Marie” continues its spectacular
triumph and charming music at Sydney
Majesty’s. The management of the St.
James has no ground to complain about its
new tenant, “Mercenary Mary,” whose lease
will probably be a long one; but “Brown
Sugar” will disappear from the menu at
the Criterion next Wednesday, when the
Renee Kelly season will come to an end.
On the following Saturday Moscovitcli steps in
with “They Knew What They Wanted,” a play
which has stirred the censorious in London.
“The Sentimental Bloke” and Bert Bailey
are to arrive at the G.O.H. on October 2;
but “The Best People” are doing so well
there that they will probably move over to
the Palace. The Palace is being used for
vaudeville since "The Sport of Kings” closed
its bag last week.
** * *
“He Who Gets Slapped” makes the best
film-story seen in Sydney this year; it is
one of those rare instances pf the photo-
drama improving on the original. The story
is that of a modest, retiring genius who
finds himself continually thrust aside by
others with less brains but more push. Em-
bittered by being cheated even out of his
wife, he, to lose his identity with his old
world, attaches himself to a circus, where
as a clown he is able to work off gall-shafted
satires on the crowd; every time he speaks
he is hit and buffeted by the other clowns,
and this rough comedy disguises his insults
to the world. But even in the environment
of the circus he finds again the triumph of
push and wealth over merit, which poisons
the contentment that might have come to
him. The screen drama reaches its climax
when, determined to expose the wrongs he
has suffered, he rushes into the ring to tell
them to the crowd assembled for a gala
night. Every time he opens his mouth to
speak, however, he is buffeted, to the delight
of a laughing audience, until he drops dead

of the poison he has taken. In the play
the end comes in the dressing-room of the
circus, when, after poisoning the circus girl
he has learnt to love in order to save her
from marriage with an elderly satyr, the
Timon-like person talkatively dies of poison
he lias himself taken. The screen version
will certainly be a. great help to the play,
which is staged every Wednesday by the
Pla.vbox Club in the toy theatre in Rowe-
street. The cast which helps in the produc-
tion is amateur and amateurish; but in
spite of the drawbacks of the small stage
arid absence of elaborate backing, it gives a
moving representation of the soul-tragedy
of the embittered genius. Duncan Mac-
dougall is inclined to be preachy in the long
speeches of the central character, and shows,
too, a lack of the whimsicality which lightens
occasionally its gloomy depths; but he pro-
vides all the dramatic force necessary. The
performance is a dish worth sampling by
those who like intellectual seasoning with
their theatrical fare.

A well-pruned Sydney Art show
Vigorous work has reduced the exhibits at the show
of the Society of Artists in the Education Gallery
to about 180 pictures, including black-and-whites;
and yet a few weeds have escaped, mainly the work
of well-known members of the society. Besides
George Lambert’s portrait of George Judah Cohen,
he shows “Dorothea in Fancy Dress,” for which the
catalogue modestly mentions that 400 guineas is a
fair thing. The price suggests that somebody thinks
it the best picture in the show, which it isn’t, although
it exhibits the artist’s cleverness and rather less than
usual of his determination to show it. Norman
Carter is the heaviest contributor, not only in the
number of pictures but in the impression they give
of work laboriously done and short of inspiration.
The craftsmanship is altogether too solid—does not
even attempt to disguise itself under a mask of
spontaneity. He has four portraits, a skilfully com-
posed interior of the Great Hall of the Sydney Uni-
versity, and some other work. Bernard Hall con-
tributes a very attractive interior in “A Studio
Party” and the only nude in the show, an unclothed
lady regarding herself in a mirror with infinite
satisfaction. Elioth Gruner advertises the popularity
of his work, which is bought as soon as produced, by
showing pictures lent by their owners (“Summer
Shade” is the most enticing) ; W. B. Mclnnes, with
three delightful portraits in the Velasquez style
(that of a child, “Geoff,” especially lively and
charming) ; and with two exceptions Hans Heysen
also presents only w'orks loaned by purchasers. But
all these help to lift the show. A Blue Mountains
picture by Howard Ashton is a surprise full of
pleasure; the massiveness with which the subject is
handled and the treatment of the lights are splendid.
This Showman regards the “Winter Light” of
Robert Johnson, priced at only 30 guineas, as the
bargain of the exhibition; but the Art Gallery
Trustees, with a feeling of obligation to buy some-
thing cheap, have paid 40 guineas for John D.
Moore’s heavily lumped “Sea Cliffs” ; that victim to
style has other offerings which are far better. A
small, lively portrait by Henry Gibbons, “Dmitri” ;
a truthful light-study by Percy Lindsay, “The
Brickworks”; the fresh “A Mountain Road” by John
Rowell, and “A Tasmanian Valley” by Vida Lahey,
with some portrait work by George Bell, strike the
eye most pleasantly among the other contributions,
which include M. K. Smyth’s “The Beach, St. Jean
de Luz,” in which women suffering from curvature of
the spine sit on the sands beside bathing tents
played upon by a wind which is apparently blowing-
two ways; and the “Cremorne from Shell Cove” of
Norman Lloyd, who has built his houses on that
pleasant point with a child’s blocks.
B. E. Minns is outstanding in the water-color
section with “Hyde Park,” a subject well handled,
and some others; Harold Herbert has much-as-usual
work, Carlyle Jackson a nice landscape, and Joan
Lindsay several simple but appealing trifles. There
are contributions also "from Norman Lindsay and
Blamire Young, in which both artists exploit fully
their own methods. Kenneth Macqueen takes a
queer view of the earth’s surface; he succeeds in
being extraordinary, anyway. “The Yellow Bath’’ of
Thea Proctor is another freakish contribution.
The black-and-white section is small, and dominated
by Sydney Ure Smith; but some careful pencil
drawings by Hardy Wilson call for mention. Macken-
nal’s bronze, “Diana Wounded,” is the only statuary
exhibit; the etceteras include a display of Rhoda
Wager’s artistic jewellery and attractive book bind-
ings by Wal Taylor.
The Santrey combination has found two
Sydney theatres necessary to house its
popularity, and, the Palace having fallen con-
veniently vacant, the co. divides its time be-'
tween that stage and the Tivoli. Whilst
the other performers who make up the per-
formance keep one house going, the Santreys
are at the other. Twenty-four performances
a week is something very like hard work;
but the programme keeps cheerful. The
Tivoli has added to itself Bruce Green, who,
although he has succeeded in keeping every
vestige of originality out of his act, supplies
broad laughs in feminine garments: and
Arthur and Darling tangle and untangle
themselves in a manner peculiar to contor-
tionists.
Sydney had one of its occasional Yiddish
theatrical entertainments when, on September
4, the Chosen flocked to the Maccabean Hall
to listen to “Dora the Favorite,” by Jacob
Gordin, the most successful and best known
of Yiddish playwrights—Moscovitcli has
played in some of liis productions. This in-
tensely dramatic play deals with a sensual
and ambitious solicitor, Fievel Volohovsi,
who, to relieve the tedium of a stay in a
dull village, enters lightly into a flirtation
with his old sweetheart. Dora takes the
affair seriously; and the climax is tragic.
The Jewish amateurs handled their material
well; but to those who did not understand
Yiddish the curse of Piny a, the brother of the
unsuspecting husband of the play, when his
warnings are disregarded, was the most inter-
esting item. That string of Yiddish invective
might be studied with advantage by bullockies
and golfers.
“Midnight Frolics” continue to spread
happiness at Fullers’ New Theatre (Syd-
ney), where a new shuffle of the cards for
this week shows quite the average of trumps.
The death of Valentino gives an extra
advertisement to “Cobra,” which is shown
this week at Sydney Lyceum. The story
(it is from the play by Martin Brown
whose “The Lady” was produced in Aus
tralia by Pauline Frederick) is that of an
Italian count for whom every woman has
an attraction. The play is well directed, and
the story fairly interesting. Hoyt’s show
“Malay Blood” and “That’s My Baby,” in
which a thin narrative is made very worth
while by the acting of Douglas Maclean, who
gets a laugh with every action. Harry
Earles, the midget who was featured in
“The Unholy Three,” is in the cast, which
contains also a very bright lady in Margaret
Morris.
Melbourne will explode in four places on
Saturday in honor of the Show Week in
vasion. Harry Green will be the principal
prevaricator in “Nothing but Lies,” the
Aaron Hoffman farce, to be related at the
Affhemeum. “Lady, Be Good!” will be an
arresting exclamation at the Princess, and
to make room for it “Abie’s Irish Rose” has
been transplanted to the Palace. The origi-
nal—though not so very original—-“No, No,
Nanette,” company will try to repeat its
former triumph in this new Ward venture.
“Is Zat So?” at the King’s is an American
drollery that has brought its own performers
with it, including Richard Taber, who partly
wrote it and will take the leading rble.
“Katja” will be unloosed at the Royal, Marie
Burke having recovered from her railway
misadventure. Amidst the din His Majesty’s
is heard announcing a minor sensation in the
substitution of Maud Fane, just back from
England, for Dorothy Lena in “Tell Me
More.” This paper knows of another lady
it would sooner see depart than Dorothy.
Amidst the massacre of old attractions in
Melbourne this week “The Sentimental Bloke”
is gratefully remembered. The good recep-
tion given to the Kid augurs well for the
dinkum Australian drama of the future
which will adopt its racy dialect but im-
prove on its construction.
As a shopgirl in a de-partmeutal store,
Gloria Swanson is trifling with the affec-
tions of a handsome young inventor far too
good for her at Hoyt’s Melbourne house
this week. Lured by her passion for expen-
sive clothes, she mingles in the fastest circles.
Nevertheless, her lover, who has made a
fortune in the meantime, need not have
grumbled in the way he did. His future
wife was merely jackerooing in order to
take her place fittingly in Hollywood’s notion
of the best society. “Shophandled” is the
picture’s title. “The Man on the Box” is
the Majestic’s chief claim to attention. It
is a Syd Chaplin farce with few dull
moments in it.

To any Tennis Player
Expert in Tennis Requirements
or Tennis Ball Manufacturer
If the Five following Spalding Claims can be Disproved:
1. That A. G. Spalding & Bros, are the inventors and perfectors of the approved modern
type of two-piece, plugless and stitchless tennis ball.
2. That the Spalding-made Stitchless Tennis Ball is the only ball that uniformly complies,
in every country throughout the world, with the Standard of Deformation as laid down
by the International Federation of Lawn Tennis, which is as follows: —
“A deformation of not less than .290 of an inch
and not more than .315 of an inch when sub-
jected to a pressure of 18 lbs. applied at a tem-
perature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit
3. That no other tennis ball sold in Australia comes as uniformly exact to the requirements
of the New Standard Compression Test as the Spalding.
4. That the Spalding Tennis Ball (which is guaranteed to retain its air-compression) is the
only two-piece, plugless ball filled with compressed air and not chemically inflated as
are other makes.
5. That none other than the Spalding-made, Stitchless Tennis Ball has been selected for
use in the Davis Cup Challenge Rounds for the past six years—l92l-2-3-4-5-6, or the
Olympic Games, Paris, 1924 —the Spalding Stitchless Ball being the ‘‘Choice of Cham-
pions” for reason of its Accuracy and Control as well as Uniformity of Flight and Bounce.
But in Substantiation of these Claims it can be Emphatically Proved —
1. That other manufacturers the world, over have tried unsuccessfully to follow the Spalding
method of manufacture, which is their own secret process.
2. That in the estimation of the Lawn Tennis Associations of Great Britain, France,
Canada and America, Spalding-made Stitchless Tennis Balls hold pride of place, having
been selected for Championship Matches against all other makes.
3. That tests made with the Standard Compression Testing Machine (the first to arrive in
Australia) with other makes of tennis balls, have demonstrated the inflation pressure, in
a dozen balls taken from a single box of any one make, to vary from .185 to .360 of an inch.
4. That Spalding possess and employ the only Patent Air-filling Machine for tennis balls,
whereby each of their balls is automatically inflated to an exact degree and sealed as
a whole ( without recourse to punctures, plugs or chemicals), which is the secret of the
uniformity and long life of Spalding Tennis Balls.
5. That after exhaustive tests the Spalding Stitchless Tennis Ball has come to be accepted
by the Tennis Experts of five of the leading sport-loving nations of the world as an
outstanding example of faultless exactitude, and as covering every requirement of*
modern Tennis in Accuracy, Uniformity, Control, Speed and Endurance.
6. That at least three exclusive Spalding patents are used in the manufacture of Spalding
Australian-made Tennis Balls.

Ford owners from the country will be able
to see what a liorse looks like at Wirtlis’
New Olympia in Melbourne on Saturday.
The familiar building where the lion was
wont to jump through the flaming hoop and
the elephant sometimes sat on the leading
lady is now a dancing-hall, but accommoda-
tion for 4000 has been arranged elsewhere
in the vicinity. Thorpe McConville will pro-
vide a cheerful show, entitled “Wild Aus-
tralia,” replete with 100 head of outlaws,
mules, bucking bullocks, whipcrackers, sharp-
shooters and other alleged features of the
rural landscape. Look Out, a champion high
jumper, has been loaned by Mrs. A. A. Laid-
law, of Ararat. High jumping having been
discontinued at the Show, this last item
should appeal to lovers of the leaping art.

An analysis of the laughter that greets
Jim Gerald’s efforts to amuse at Melbourne
Bijou would be an interesting revelation of
the habits of the people. On Saturday nights
it has a gruff and adult note, and on week
nights it is embellished with the soprano
liltings of the flapper. At matinees, when
there are no facing fixtures and the gents
who lay the odds and their numerous attend-
ants seek surcease from business cares, there
is a neighing or horsey note about it. The
other afternoon this Showman was startled
by a shrill treble like the squeal of a passing
shell, mingled with the loud explosion of
peanut bombs, the machine-gun clatter of
gingerbeer bottles proceeding down the aisles,
and the screams of babies wounded in their
pride by their worried mas. These martial
sounds will prevail until Show Week is over
and the schools resume their soulless round.
The cold reception of the Southern Planta-
tion Revue at Melbourne Tivoli should be a
warning to entrepreneurs who dabble in
the too-exotic. This country doesn’t mind a
bit of Negro with its entertainment, but the
present issue is overwhelming. It is also
overloaded with ancient gags and unredeemed
by natural humor. Other tedious Ameri-
can requisitions are Newport and Parker,
who do a lot of things that could be done
much better. Kittle and Edna Prince, two
sprightly Australian sisters, give an imita-
tion of an Etruscan vase come to life? Cahill,
the pianist, has borrowed Percy Grainger’s
hair, and has some of his manual dexterity;
Brooke, his colleague, airs his' Scliumann-
Schubert voice; and Salerno’s attendant con-
tinues to be comically astounded at his
master’s easy ways with furniture.
** * *
The etchers go to Melbourne:—
The Australian Painter-Etchers’ Society, a mainly
Sydney enterprise, is hanging 127 pieces of needle-
work at the New Gallery, the 127 including some
English examples. They are, on the whole, a drab
lot. T. Friedensen has reproduced everything of a
Venetian canal except the smells; Henry FullvVoocl
is as usual safe and sound ; amidst a panel of dul-
ness, H. It. Gallop’s “Lakeshore” protrudes as a
beautifully rhythmical study of a fine stand of
timber; E. Warner’s “Mountain Pool” is a moving
picture, and some of the Englishmen have great
technical ability. The work of many of the others
resembles painstaking pen-drawing of no importance.
The peculiar advantage of the etching medium is
its ability to express color and suggest mystery. The
art of Cyril Dillon and some of his colleagues is
no more mysterious than a chocolate machine and
less suggestive than even a politician.
*l* »I» -i-
Potash and Perlmutter, at the York in
Adelaide, illustrate the tendency of a
“straight” story to become wildly farcical on
the screen. They start to sell motor-cars,
but Potash, riding the heavens in his night-
shirt, becomes outrageous. Business is big.
"Hands Up” at Wondergrapli is another ex-
ample ; it is contrasted with the Novak
lady in a ride-for-life on a motor-cycle to
"switch” an express. Americau railways
furnish the main motive at West’s, too, in
"The Iron Horse”; Elsa Stralia is singing
at this house. The Prince of Wales stages
the spoken drama with the old “When Lon-
don Sleeps,” complete with idol and (in-
tended) sacrifice. Will Whitburn and his
minstrels revive old memories at the Royal,
and Charles Pope recalls other days when
Irving Sayles was his foil and mate. Also
George Wallace, wildly funny, again has his
co. at the Majestic.
From an Adelaide critic;—
Margaret Preston, better known to Adelaide by
her old name of MacPherson, has an interesting
show of woodcuts at the Dunster Gallery. Many of them
seem to be intentionally crude, aiming to get the spirit
of a century back. But the artist is experimenting all
along the line, with dainty nudes, views of Sydney
Harbor, and especially birds and flowers. These
last are mostly hand-painted—one, of something
flaming in the parrot line, is the most desirable
thing in the room; but the lady is starting to
print in colors, and announces that she has aban-
doned the other line. Public patronage of the
show is as yet not good.

“Daggs is putting on a lot of dog lately .”
“Oh well, he’s conic on so quickly—a month ago he was playing
the hind legs of the eleph ant, now he's doing the front.”
“Caul Boy” : Of the four brothers of the
Lynch Family of Bellringers who originated
the troupe at Geelong in ISH7 only William
survives. Robert died in March, and the
oldest brother, Harry, followed the other day.
Harry was the literary member of the musi-
cal party. He published several popular
books of his travels.
“C. Coral”: Cinema-man Frank Hurley,
who came up with a company of artists last
year to produce a couple of tropic pictures
with plenty of native life and color, returned
to Torres Strait recently to complete an
under-water scene for one of liis thrillers.
Mabuiag Island was the selected site, and
with dress-divers and “skin” swimmers figur-
ing in critical situations, a good deal of the
real stuff has been secured. On this visit
the captain brought with him an eight-valve
receiving set, and the islanders were able
to listen-in to Melbourne and Honolulu.
There was a good deal of divided opinion.
however, as to whom the credit for the new
piece of wizardry really belonged to, and for a
time relations between the native who d
climbed the cocoamit-ft'ee to tix the aerial
and the one wlio'd planted the earth-wife
Were somewhat strained, each claiming to be
tiie magic win-kef.
“Cifis'af'ls tlliOst”: . t%i,l. Walsh, the Aus-
tralian cbnledian who, fired of wandering
Abroad, stayed in Australia after returning
as manager of the Irish Players, is ventur-
ing into picture work. Young (N.S.W.) is
to be put into pictures, a local syndicate hav-
ing subscribed the necessary cash. The town;
which used to be. Lambing Flat, lias an in-
teresting history, including gold rushes, riots,
bushrangers and elections which put the first
direct representatives of the workers, paid
by tlieir constituents, iuto Parliament.
Walsh’s job will be to run a thread of narra-
tive through six reels of the story.
“Hamfat”: Marie Burke, now charming
Brisbane with "Wildflower,” has elsewhere
appeared in everything from grand opera to
pantomime. She made her first appearance
in Australia with a male partner in a vaude-
ville turn at the commencement of the Firm’s
venture into variety at the Melbourne Royal
two years ago. This writer then asserted
that "the Williamson management had at
hand the musical comedy "lead” for which
it had been looking for years. Since the
time of Tittell Brune no stage star has
wakened such warm affection amongst the
gallery girls. I know of one in Sydney who
saw her 22 times in "Wildflower” and
"Ivatja”—she was one of a multitude of
adorers who poured telegrams of sympathy
upon the star after the , Abcfdeeii railway
accident. The gallefy gin makes an idol of
feminine stars, milch more readily than of
the .hiflsfeiiliii'e ; but precisely what the quality
is that attracts the popularity it is hard to
say. Whatever it is, Marie Burke lias it,
although she is entirely different from Tittell.
“llamfat”: Stars
of a brilliance
more boosted than
real who come to
Australia and win
fortunes may have
occasion to love
this country for its
mug public; but
William Ileughan,
tin 1 fine-voiced bass-
baritone, who de-
served much better
than most of them,
must have got a
real love for the
country itself to
announce that he is
coming back.
Ileughan relied in
vain upon the
Highland Societies
to help him. As
lie arrived in Mel-
bourne practically
unheralded and
without the neces-
sary three months’
preliminary boost-
ing, his frost was
not s u r p r i s i n g.
Admirers hel p e d
him to get into
personal touch with
the leading spirits
in > the Highland
Societies elsewhere,
with be 11 e r re-
sults in Sydney
and M.L.; but they
were nowhere what
they should have
been. One thor-
oughly Scotch sug-
gestion, turned
down by the singer,
was the invitation
of a High 1 a n d
Society In Victoria.
It was given in a
large philanthropic
manner —the singer
was to come and
give two concerts
at 2s. and Is., “and you can be sure of large
houses.”
“Mercutio”: Poor old Jimmy Martin was
for very many years one of tile stalwarts of
Alfred Dampier’s co. “Jimmy” Atholwood
was another, and Reg Rede, now living in
dignified retirement in the Old Actors* Homes
at Fitzroy, Melbourne, another,
“Beauseant” : I don’t want to say anything
nasty about it, but if, as “L.G,” Says (B.
9/9/’26), the members of Allan Wilkie’s
company are well looked after because £2OO
has been distributed amongst them, they are
easily satisfied. They were put out of work
many weeks ago, and as there are, according
to “L.G.,” 30 of them, £6 13s. 4d. a head
won’t keep them for long at the Hotel
Windsor, where Allan himself always stops.
“L.11.P.”: Kate Howarde, Australia’s
pushing manageress in the rural districts,
was Lily Howard when I first saw her in
Percy St. John’s burlesque troune in M.L.
in 1894. Jake Friedman, now One J T}le
Veterans of Variety,” Florne St. Clair, rris
cilia Verne, Fred Cambourne and V ill
Stevens tvere also principals in a
did three-act burlesques of 1 aust, Cm
derella,” “Hinbad,” etc. I rovd, the juggler
also in the bill. Priscilla Veine, de-
scribed by Rickards as tlic best serio-comic
of her time in Australia, now lui Q ‘
Darlingburst, and I hope has to hang out
the •‘House Full” sign very often.
“Caul Boy” : Athol Tier, the weird Adel-
aide comedian, who has been a draw on <
Tivoli circuit, will take a new act to Co -
don. If the act fails the legs should walk
him on.
"C O.ckney” : If Leon Gordon’s woman-
less play (B. 2/9/’26) is half as good.as
Macdonald Hastings’s "The New 8m
which likewise has no female charactei
should be worth seeing. The half-dozen men
in "The New Sin” keep the interest moving
in what is indeed a remarkably absoibmg
piece. It has, I think, been done m Aus-
tralia. but only in a tentative fashion, man-
agers here seemingly looking on it as one of
the "denined dull and unprofitable leper-
tory plays, though it had a good run at
London Criterion on its first production.
Hastings has written many plays since, but
never anything so fresh and original. Love
—and What Then?” had some success when
done by Cyril Maude at the Playhouse, but
"The Tide,” which was produced m London
by Ethel Warwick, soon went out.
"Old I n”: Amateur mummers, never oyer-
modest, ate just as amusing now as m the
days of “The Pantomime Rehearsal, ana
their conceit lias grown with the years and
thi' advent of so-called repertory societies.
“Clos V.” (B. 9/9/'2G), who, I take it, him-
self occasionally smears grease-paint on his
face after office-hours, tells us that intelli-
gent, well-educated amateurs can give as good
performances of literary plays as profes-
sionals if the producer knows his business.-
But why this challenging comparison—this
unnecessary heat? When do professionals
get the chance to appear in these literary
plays? The amateurs have the field to them-
selves —the best authors and the fattest parts
ever written, parts which, try as they may,
they can never quite succeed in killing. If,
as '“Clos V.” says, the amateur producer is
capable of turning out a whole cast of ama-
teurs equal to professional players, lie must
be a wonder. Especially considering that
he invariably annexes the best part in the
piece for himself.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Madge Titheradge will
create the leading role in Noel Coward s
latest play, "The Queen in Her Parlor, at
St. Martin’s Theatre. Although there have
been rumors of extra deliberation on the
part of the Censor, the road is now clear.
“John’s Wood” (Loud.) : Even a great
name is not always enough now to make any
serious appeal to the music-loving public
unless buttressed by solid advertising. At
a gathering of musicians recently, m the
home of Michel Clierniavsky, Joseph Hoff-
man related that his recital in London a
few weeks ago showed aross receipts of
£B, Hoffman, who was the only private
pupil Rubinstein ever took, caustically com*
men ted on the fact that iCreisler had been
paid 750 guineas to play to a handful of
guests at one of the season’s private parties.
Hoffman, however, has other markets eager
for his great talents, both as pianist and
composer. His compositions are published
under an Assumed name.
“Hamfat”: The “resting” of local actors
enforced by the inrush of imported cos. seems
to be benefiting the dentists *, in one day I
met three mummers minus some of their
fangs, anxiously awaiting the arrival of
made-to-order teeth. One of them remarked
gloomily that his gummy condition didnt
matter much. “Actors have no use for
teeth these days,” he bitterly said.
“W.E.F.” : At the rear of Duncan Mac-
dougail’s tiny stage at the. Playbox, Sydney,
is a window that looks down into Rowe-
street, three floors below. When Karel
Capek’s “R.TLR.” was produced by 'the
Playbox the window was utilised as one of
the props. In this play the Robots, the
machine-made men, revolt against their
creators and storm the plant where they are
manufactured. Berman, the works manager,
with pockets stuffed with bank-notes, rushes
out to parley with the approaching rebels.
Through the window the last men left ifl
the world are supposed to bo watching Ber-
man. At this moment one night a voice
up aloft yelled, “Berman, have you gone
mad?” A drunk happened to be passing
beneath. He wheeled around, searched
the little street and shouted back, “He’sh
not —hie —down here —niushta gone ’roun’ the
corner!” When loud shouts warned him of
the danger of a fence charged with electricity,
and someone screeched “My God, the current
has killed him! There he lies with half a
billion bank-notes by his side!” the drunk
yelled in terror for the police. No sozzled
one had ever felt more thankful for a cell
than he did that night.
DEATH'S BATON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Frederick M_ewton, organist of St. Andrew's
Cathedral, Sydney, died on Saturday while directing
the performance of ‘Mevrie Kngland’ for the Hor-
dernian Musical Society. At the moment of his
death Miss Florence Barrow was singing ‘O Peace-
ful England.’ ”
What sweeter death
Than this could be—-
Upon a breath
Of melody
To fade and let the baton fall!
His waving hand
Was like a flame ;
At his command
The music came ;
His last song was a madrigal.
In England’s peace
And merriment,
Thus, thus to cease
In deep content—
What other end could be so sweet?
Such happiness
From life he drew,
Death came to bless:
He surely knew
His broken melody complete!

The Opportunity for
“Taking a Drop of Wolfe’s’
This often presents, itself to different men in different
ways, Some prefer it with a dash of bitters as a healthful
appetiser before lunch. Others regard it as tired nature s
sweet restorer,’’ and make it a rite to have one at the
end of a busy day. Others again, knowing its virtues as
a nightcap, take their drop of Wolfe’s just at bedtime.
After all, “One Wolfe’s Schnapps a day for your health’s
sake’’ is the important thing—making the opportunity is
a matter of individual taste.
Wolfe’s is obtainable in
quarter-size bottles as
well as the familiar half -
and large-size bottles.

a New-Type
High-Speed Light
s

u
k
hjk
With Four-
Wheel Brakes
7 this is the announce-
ment of a revolutionary
new-type car . . . radically
different from any you have
ever known before.
A car that combines the ad-
vanced engineering practice of
Europe with new and im-
proved standards of American
performance.
A car that will travel over 55
miles an hour in perfect comfort.
That will pick up in 13 seconds
from 5 to 30 miles an hour.
A car that will go 35 miles on
an Imperial gallon of petrol. . .
more than 1,000 miles on a
gallon of oil.
This new-type car is a challenge
to all former engineering prac-
tice. It casts aside every old
'a?
tradition. And marks the most
important light car engineer-
ing improvement during the
past 16 years.
* * * *
<*•,,, <vv
This new car has a long, low
body of modern design, fin-
ished in durable Appenine blue
lacquer, with black beading
and gold stripe.
It is 5 feet 9 inches high . . .
not as tall as the average man.
Yet it provides more room and
comfort than you’ve ever found
in any motor car of this class
before.
High-power design
It has a “high-torque,” 31 horse-
power motor of small bore
and long stroke—the same en-
gineering principle used in the
fastest racing cars of America
and Europe.
It turns in a 34-foot circle . . .
that’s less than the width of
an average city street. You
can park in 14 feet ... which
is much less than the space re-
quired for the ordinary car.
4-wheel brakes are an integral
part of this new car’s chassis
design.
Measured tests show that it
will stop in two car lengths
from a speed of 25 miles an
hour.
Its center of gravity is extremely
low . . . with ample road
clearance . . . thus giving a
sense of security you have never
found in any light car before.
In traffic the Overland Whippet
gets away with lightning pick-
up—stop-watch tests show that
it accelerates up to 40 miles an
hour, 18% faster than other
four cylinder cars.
It runs like a £t six” . . . pulls
with irresistible power. . . goes
over any average hill on high-
gear.
With the introduction of this
new-type car the whole motcr
car situation is bound to change.
It establishes entirely new
standards of performance and
value, by which all light cars
from now on must be judged.
See this modern Car. Ride in
it. Drive it. A demonstra-
tion may save you from buy-
ing some old-fashioned car of
obsolete type.

MONDAY (FOLLOWING ROYAL SHOW),
27th SEPTEMBER, 1926.
AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY.
Important sale ot' the “Comelybauks” pure registered
Jersey Herd “Twylish” blood, with wonderful test
performances.
At NEWMARKET.
ADAMSON, STRETTLE and CO. PTY., LTD.,
pure stock salesmen, 482 Bourke. Street, Melbourne,
Vic., have received instructions from Messrs W. and
G. Finn, of Comelybauks, Bundoora, to sell, on above
date, the whole of their high-class Jersey herd, owing
to a dissolution of partnership, comprising:—
30 stud cows and heifers, including prize takers
Royal Show, and winners of the Government
herd test, 1924, showing the remarkable aver-
age of 447.531 b. butter fat, twice a day
milking.
12 stud bulls, including the stud sire “Lily’s Lad
of Holmwood” (1051) and “Twylish” or
Comelybanks” (2419), both being by the
invincible dual purpose sire, “Audrey’s Lord
Twylish” (985).
The “Comelybank” herd is practically “Twylish”
blood, and over a series of 5 years’ tests the aver-
age, including first class heifers, runs to over 4001 b.
butter fat per head for the 273 days’ test. This will
satisfy the most fastidious as to dairy quality.
Drivers of Jersey stock in this State have never
before had an opportunity of selecting from a line
of cattle so high in all round standard as is here
presented them.

Although it is lonely out there in
the back o’beyond you wouldn’t
feel so “out of it ” if you had aDecca.
You could hear all the latest English

most famous artistes—all the most
popular dance tunes of the day.
The handy portable Decca was made
to accompany man into all the in-
accessible places of the earth. For
this reason it is staunch and sturdy
in build; its compactness is amaz-
ing, and yet its rich volume of pure
tone is as beautiful as that of the
most expensive models.
Include a Decca in your kit when
you go camping. You can carry it
with the utmost ease, for it is as
light and bandy as an attache case.

P.L.B.: “Adventure" is a good yarn, but
too long for our use....A.Q.: Too superficial for
that page....Cold Steel: You accuse us of thieving
a joke from London Punch of June 9, 1926. That
joke was bought from the artist, who resides in
France, on June 15, 1925 —12 months before our
London contemporary printed it C.K.: Pointless
par. and sapless verse... .H.M.M.: Frankly, it is
terrible... .A.S.S.: We’ll never become real friends
if you write on both sides of the paper—or at such
weary length.... Add: Heavy-footed love verse thuds
its way back... .C.H.B.: “Her tears keep falling,
falling, and what am 1 to do?” Dam her eyes....
Crib: “Damage by White Ants” is really dry rot....
Bellerive: Ah, here’s something different: —
To a few social friends
In a vaudeville way
Coon ditties I sang
And solo’s did play.
’Twas an evening at home —«
And by special request
In quaint minstrel style
I did my best.
Harmony and music
Is cheering at times,
As good as a tonic after
Jotting down rhymes.
’Twas a pleasant revival
Of days gone b.v ;
The guests were pleased,
And so was I.
With the Swanec River
Alj' performance did end;
I'd writing to do,
Which I did attend.
. ...A.P.J., Whaff, Rayua, F.M.N.: You don't quite
earn the space... . D.A.L.: “Dejected” . is also re-
jected. .. .C.M.B.: In “Scooping the Pool" you stir
up too much mud. .. .F.O.: Story of man’s redemp-
tion by woman was told the day after the apple
was eaten. Or it may have been the same night.
....Yelk Cub: Your “Joke with Death” killed you
stone dead. .. .R.M.C.: Too rough....F.M.: The plot
is so decrepit and the telling so ill that we’ve
put the MS. in a bath-chair Arch B.: Even if we
published novelettes yours wouldn't have much chance.
... .C.G.R.J.: Pretty good; but don't be didactic.
. ...N.C.: Fails in the telling. .. .J.ILL.: “Peregri-
nations of Pluvius” are now back in your direction.
... .W.A.R.: Poorly told. . . .E.J.M.: There’s so much
bay about “Blackman's Bay” that it might be a
seadog instead of a quiet inlet. .. .T.Z.D.: The
verse is as thorny as you say your heart is....
Sol D.: Not enough gyp in “Gipsy”.... Keswick:
Pretentious, but very good for its purpose. You
should be able to do work by observing the type of
matter wanted and used... .P.M.D.: The Bulletin
is not a weeping wall, but this much of your elegy
on your dog gets in:—
Ah, how I mind that winter’s morn, when I found
him nearly dead,
Lying out upon the rubbish heap, as if he’d ne’er
been fed. . . .
And when I was on the booze and drunk, ’twas then
he’d show his worth.
He would watch me with more care and love than
anything on earth.
. ...Yabba: “The thund’rous precipice a-noise.”
You’re right. But we spell it “annoys”... .V.G.:
Your hero is an uninteresting and mean type of
criminal.... Gac: Can’t see our way to publish
“Night”... .J.E.S.: Not even the Biblical references
in the margin carry the verses through... .B.I1.H.:
One of the commandments for versifiers is: “Thou
shalt not make unto thyself any wooden image”....
W.J.T.: You entered your Pegasus for a trot; and it
“broke” in several of the stanzas C.B.H.: 112
lines to describe why the parson didn’t write his
poem !... .Graham H.: Golf story fell into the bunker
of forced humor H.M.W.: Could be made con-
vincing, but is not convincing as presented....
A.D.: “The Bridge” is too frail... .B.O.R.: He
jests at wounds who never read your “Scars”....
T.A.J.: A mere pathetic fragment... .Clip: After
rushing along with your breathless narrative we
found it went nowhere. .. .Norma D.: Imagery gets
all astray.... L.L.: Story too obstetric. That theme
wants very skilful handling.... Ripponlea: When the
bodysnatcher defies the “elevated sexton” the story
becomes interesting:—
Returned the body-robber: “Esther Hoqq owes me
this.
May she cavort and gambol where Hell-flames hiss.
And you, Dick Pobjoy, if to argue you continue
I’ll extricate my gat and put a bullet in you.”
Leaning ’gainst th’ grave-side in amaze he"
Sobbed in his arms with his cheek on a daisy.
Suddenly, he flung back his arms and howled aloud
“For my just inheritance must I pick the pockets
of a shroud?”
This pitiful outburst his captor did silently spurn.
He leaned downward, and his bow was stern.
“Beware, brother, that your father’s ghost don’t rise
And knock you kicking, down there, where $he lies.
And remember, John Featonby, that Esther Iloyg,
down there
Was your father’s maiden sister. So beware!”
. ...F.W.R.: Needs a lot of clipping... .R.L.: Too
slight. .. .11.C.: Much better to tell the girl about
it than write mad verses complaining that your
“sunbeam,” your “one love bird,” does not know
of your love... .M.G.: You chase a phantom idea
over half a mile of very rocky verse A.E.D.:
Only a lot of cheap jokes thrown together....
O.S.C.: Your verse is too rough a vehicle for “The
Road.” The remark applies to the others, too. Study
your scansion A.W.S.: Sorry; can’t swallow the
story.... Rose C.: You mention an illicit love affair,
a murder and a suicide as if reporting a suburban
evening'party Edward L.: Cataloguing the stars
like that, you make the verse a sort of overhead
“Who’s Who”... .G.E.H.: “Prayer” fails to reach
the heaven of publication... .A.L.W.; Would make
a. par M.M.: Morbid little sketch J.D.C.:
Basket R.G.I1.: Tried hard to find the laugh, but
couldn’t R.G.: Why with an equal choice select
the unhappy ending? Such tear-sodden documents
add to the smoke nuisance in our incinerator.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
N.G.; Pay more attention to drawing and less to
the lettering of the joke H.P.W.: The cook who
soaks the steak in Condy’s Crystals wants roasting at
his own grill J.T.H.; Scratches, badly put together.
S.B.; Mind the duke with the moustache doesn't
topple over. .. .G.K.: The nervous pen strokes of a
fluttering hand J.T.H.: The jilted lady's left
knee suggests that a kick from her lover caused the
parting... .O.E.T.: You send us a handful of visiting-
cards with inky splashes upon the back and ask
for a staff job. What have we done to deserve it?
- ...D.A.B.; The weeping widow was told to dry
her tears and stand on someone else’s doormat . .
S.G.M.: “Tracing” is a schoolkid’s trick.... .W.R.B.:
Like the gin’s hosiery, the drawing falls short.

Theod”: The Hume Reservoir, now that
the joint State authorities have decided on
enlarging it, is going to break all records in
this part of the world. It has a catchment
area of 6000 square miles, a height of 128
feet; the length of the concrete dam on the
N. S. Wales side is 930 feet, and the length
of the earth bank in Vic. is 2850 feet. There
are 29 regulating gates. The total moisture
containable will be 2,000,000 acre-feet. There
is only one larger, and that is in Elephant
Butte, U.S.A.

“Mako”: Maoriland is taking her Island
possessions very seriously, and has just de-
cided to spend £55,000 on a 1000-ton motor-
ship. This vessel, to be delivered early next
year, will provide adequate service over the
thousand miles of ocean that M.L. has to
cover to get round her Island dependencies.
I here will be insulated transport for tropi-
cal fruits, and accommodation for 26 pas-
sengers, with an official suite for the Gov-
ernor or any other high functionary who may
care to inspect the islands.

“Two Seas”: The coolest customer that
has struck the southern highlands (N.S.W.)
for a long time, is a man who got various
stock and station agents to drive him all
over the district in search of a grazing pro-
perty. The “prospect” informed them that
he was not particular about rabbits —he
would “soon get rid of them.” Consequently
lie saw plenty of “rabbit farms,” and, choos-
ing the one most heavily stocked, had it flung
at him for a trifle and settled down upon it
—as a rabbit trapper.

“0.M.5.” : Art-union promoters in Maori-
land are only allowed to offer works of art
or alluvial gold as prizes. If the latter, the
whole of the prize money must be paid in the
dust itself. The cash equivalent is illegal,
as decided by a recent prosecution. One
bank is holding £5OO worth of dust to cover
the prizes in an art union now being pro-
moted. The first prize is to be £309, and
there are 100 other prizes, including 20
lt’s going to be a rotten job weighing
out the stuff unless all the prize-winners
sign an order to sell and remit by cheque.
* * * *
“Aroha”: Far from postal franking-
machines having been discarded in M.L., as
“Max” _ suggests (B. 12/8/’26), there is a
steady increase every year in the number in
use. All the more important branches of the
banks and insurance and merchants’ offices
find the frankers indispensable. It is no
easier for the office-boy to use the machine
for the family mail than to collar the
adhesive stamps. Every well-conducted
office keeps a register of letters posted, and
of course this lias to balance with the total
recorded on the machine. But even those
that keep no register find the loss from un-
authorised machine-franking far less than
from the open petty-cask box.
“The Traveller” : “Tarago” (B. 26/8/’26),
in describing Vic. Railways Commissioner
Llapp, used a phrase that deserves to live.
“He must do everything at the top of his
voice. That just describes him. But “Tar-
ago” is not right when he speaks of the
elimination of “6-ton” trucks by Tait. There
have not been any 6-ton trucks in the last
40 years; 7-ton has been the minimum. As a
matter of fact, there are few 10-ton trucks
now. Clapp made them into 11-ton—by
painting out the “0” and putting “1” in its
place in the legend “Load 10 tons.” In the
same way he added about 10,000 tons to his
rolling stock's carrying capacity by altering
‘ Load 15 tons” to “Load 16 tons” on the
larger vehicles.
* * * *
“C. Bumpkin”: If all the “pinching”
that goes on from the Vic. railways could
be stopped it might be unnecessary to raise
the fares. There is one shed where the
annual losses are alleged to be in the region
of £lOO,OOO. One man tendered for a lot
of worn-out corridor carpets and carried them
away wrapped round an equal number of
brand new ones. When new chairs worth
£2O were supplied to a smoking compart-
ment, somebody quickly had the old ones
reupholstered and walked off with the new
ones. But one of the most expensive thieves
is the man who uses the department’s time
and material to make fixings for his home
or his I once bought a yacht
whose fittings, its owners boasted, couldn’t
be beaten in any squadron. They were all
made m a railways workshop.
“G.8.L.”: The Lanyon homestead, with
nearly 14,000 acres, is to be sold by auction
at Queanbeyan. The building is a fine stone
one, close to the Murrumbidgee, with Mount
Tennant towering a few miles off. The
builder and first owner was James Wright,
lie and his brother William and J. H M
Lanyon took up land in 1835 about 15 miles
from where Federal Parliament House now
stands. In 1837 William Wright was acci-
dentally shot. Lanyon returned to England,
transferring his holding to James Wright!
The latter named the estate Lanyon, and
built the present homestead with the idea
of making it bushranger- and blackfellow-
proof. It was a_ bit of good work, and 90
years have had little effect on it. In 1847
Lanyon was bought by Andrew Cunning-
ham, the Wright family settling at Cuppa-
cumbalong (Meeting of the Waters), a few
miles away. The property has been in the
hands of the family ever since.
* * * *
“Real Australian”: A whiff of Victoria’s
dear old land boom in 1888-93 floated into
my nose when I read that No. 11 Elizabeth -
street, Melbourne, 40ft. by 65ft., had been
sold for £BO,OOO, or £2OOO a foot. In 1893
this three-storey brick building was sold for
£650 a foot; 14 days later it brought £837
10s., and it was resold the same day by a
friend of mine for £875. How many times
it changed hands in 1892-93 nobody could
say, not even the Titles Office. Hosie’s
Hotel, a few doors down on the corner of
F'linders-street, was sold in 1893 in my pres-
ence for £1355 a foot, Elizabeth-street front-
age. Tim population of Victoria in 1893 was
one million; to-day it is 1,654,000. When
Elizabeth-street land goes over £lOOO a foot
its time to stand from under. Once every
third of a century or so property values get
into a tangle, and interest-yielding tests are
applied rigorously to straighten it out

The Wonderful
McCLARY OVEN.
/VAeOLARY’S OVEN is as smooth as a
I ' l glass dish.
It produces no fumes. Particularly, no
ventilation is necessary; that is why it
operates on the fireless-cooker principle.
Once it has been heated the current can
be switched “off” and the oven goes on
cooking with the stored heat. Look at
the insulation. In addition to the thick
packing there is a one-inch air space
which breaks the contact between the oven
and the cooler outside atmosphere—makes
it like a Thermos bottle, the temperature
being held in the oven and not radiated
into the kitchen —a boon on summer days.
The enamelled inside walls are easy to
clean; the racks and elements can also be
instantly removed, leaving a clear oven
that only requires cleansing with a damp
cloth.

These are the
RCA Radiotrons
for dry battery sets
RCA Radiotrons UX-199, WD-11 and
WX-12 are the world’s standard for de-
tection or amplification —for big per-
formance and economy.
Power Radiotron UX-120, when used
in the last audio stage, gives added
power—greater volume—clearer tone.
With the laboratories of RCA, General
Electric and Westinghouse steadily at
work to develop Radiotrons, radio re-
ception is being improved year by year.
When you replace the valves in your
old set —or when you buy a new radio
set—always look for the RCA mark on
the base and inside the glass of every
valve you buy. It is your protection.

No. 1369.
“C.Q.”: Feathering his nest is not a
recently acquired characteristic of the poli-
tician —it’s hereditary. Fifty years ago all
vehicles belonging to members of Parliament,
however laden, were passed free through the
toll-gates in Victoria.
J. J. Liston, chief spokesman for Bung in
Victoria, lias been elected Mayor of Wil-
liamstown for the fifth consecutive year.
One daily, which makes a point of telling
whether the municipal chairman just elected
is a water-waggoner or keeps something in
the cupboard, painstakingly but superflu-
ously classified Liston as damp.
“Petane” : There were strong men among
the pioneer Maorilanders. The sacks of
flour they were expected to handle weighed
2001 b. A digger at the Richmond Hotel,
Nelson, backed himself for a small stake to
carry three full sacks across the road, pro-
vided they were placed handy for him on a
packing-case. He did it, carrying one sack
under each arm and the third in his teeth.
“Doodles” : I had a dud fruit-picking for
me in the Goulburn Valley last season, and
when I discharged him he went over to a
neighboring cocky to ask for work. The cocky
offered him the usual job of looking after
the horses, milking cows, feeding pigs and
calves, cutting wood, carting water, carry-
ing lunches, and so on. The dud inquired
the wages. “Thirty bob a week and tucker,”
said the cocky. "Never mind the tucker,
boss,” Dud chipped in. “Why, don’t you
eat?” the cocky inquired. “Yes,” replied the
other, “but if I do my job I’ll have no
blasted time to eat.”
“Elsinore” : Maoriland has produced what
is probably the champion bullock. He was
a pure-bred Friesian, reared in Timaru, and
was bought and fattened later on by Mr.
Keith, of Ashburton, by whom he was sold
to Dixon Brothers, of Christchurch, for £9O.
When slaughtered and weighed, the old-time
record held by the famous Durham ox which
toured England from 1801-07 was broken, for
he turned the scale at 2394|1b. as against the
Durham’s 23321 b. The Australian record,
several decades ago, for a dressed beast was
19981 b. Even America cannot touch the
Maoriland figures, which may be regarded
as a world’s record.
Until just a little while ago, there was
a veteran of Uncle Sam’s civil war who
hadn’t claimed a pension. This was Bill
Dunn, who lives on the Coromandel Penin-
sula in Maoriland. He was only 18 when
the trouble started, but he got into the
Federal uniform smartly and fought at York-
town and Gettysburg. After the war he
lived in Samoa for many years, and knew
R. L. Stevenson and his wife well. He had
been settled on Coromandel a great many
years when a friend told him he was due
for a war pension. He proved his claim,
and not only gets 72 dollars a month, but
has a nice wad in the bank consisting of
arrears paid in a lump.
“P.D.Q.”: The Cooma and Dorrigo dis-
asters have revived the old controversy over
the origin of the SOS call. It is simple
enough, and has nothing to do with “Save
Our Souls.” The first call used for a ship
in distress was CQD, a combination of the
general call CQ and D, signifying urgency,
It soon became clear that this call might be
misunderstood through atmospheric distur-
bances and the bad formation of the letters;
so the call was changed to that used at
present. SOS is the easiest formed group
of letters, and stands the least chance of
being mutilated. No call signs approaching
SOS, such as OSS or SSO, are issued to
ships, and it is impossible for the call to be
mutilated. The letters have no meaning at
all.
“L.T.”: The way of the transgressor may
be hard, but it can’t be much harder
than the lot of some of those whose business
it is to lead him into paths of righteousness.
For 18 parishes in Sydney tthe richest dio-
cese in the Commonwealth) the average
stipend of rectors in 1901 was £444 per
annum ; this year the average for the same
parishes is £453, an increase of £9. Eight
parishes only show an increase, six return
the same stipend as in 1901, and four actu-
ally show a decrease. The curates have
been more fortunate. Their average has
increased from £172 per annum to £287
during the last 25 years. Their increase
represents 67 per cent.; the rectors’ two per
cent,—to meet, an increase in the cost of
living during that period of not less than 75
per cent.
“Spenner” : Some of our flew settlers are
certainly gaining experience. I recently en-
gaged one whose only other job since landing
three months previously had been assisting
the chap whose business it is to destroy
vermin on Crown lands. Having a lot of
bunnies and blackberries to deal with, I
considered myself lucky to get him. I turned
him loose with the necessary tools and 50
traps. On my first visit I found him chop-
ping the blackberry off just above the ground.
To my remonstrance, he retorted that Mr.
Blank had taught him to do it that way
“ ’cos we might want this job again next
year.” In reply to my inquiry as to how
he was getting on with the rabbits, he said,
“Oh, not so bad, but I had bad luck this
morning. I caught 17, but had to let 11 of
’em go.” “Let ’em go 7” I gasped. "Yes,
they were all milky does, and I had to let
’em go to look after the young ones.” Now
I know why the Crown is such a rotten
neighbor.
“Billy See”: The recent trial for a five-
year-old Westralian murder by no means
constitutes a record for that sandy State.
Back in 1873 two abos. were brought to
trial for a murder committed eight years
previously. Not only was the case a record
in the time sense, but it also provided the
most conclusive evidence of cannibalism ever
produced against the Westralian abos. Ed-
ward Dunn, a miner, was in the year 1865
residing near Champion Bay. His little son,
four years of age, wandered into the bush
picking wild flowers. A couple of bush
blacks, Yarradee and Mullagelly, caught and
killed him, carried his body two miles into
the hills, and there lit a fire and roasted it.
A couple of abo. boys joined their elders
in the feast, and between them they ate the
whole body. The bones were thrown into
the Megrew Well, where they were dis-
covered two months later. Eight years after-
wards Mullagelly was locked up in the
Geraldton gaoi for cattle spearing, and in
an outburst of confidence he told the whole
yarn to the gaoler. The case was duly tried
and the niggers swung for their crime.

Hundreds of public institutions throughout the world employ Dodge
Brothers Commercial Cars. The Post Offices at Kingston, Jamaica;
at Bombay, India; at Capetown, South Africa; and several Govern-
ment departments in Australia—to mention only a few.
Deep, heavy channel frames, reinforced all-vanadium springs, ample
body dimensions, the prodigal use of fine alloy steels and drop forgings
—all tell a story of exceptional efficiency. All tell why Dodge Brothers
Commercial Cars render better and more economical service than most
light trucks of much larger rated capacity.

Blue Water Call.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Girl of the Blue Waters
Came to me yesterday;
Her eyes are like sky-shadows,
Her limbs are drest in spray;
Her voice is like the singing
Of home seas far away.
“They're letting go the shore-lines,”
She whispered low to me,
“They’re sailing out at sunset
To" many a distant sea,
Where life is an adventure
And men are strong and free.
“They'll stir the wondrous glamor
Of tide and tropic moon,
Down where the dim Marquesas
Are misty in the noon.
In warm seas bright with islands
Their engine songs they'll croon.
They’ll take a lonely sea-road,
As cold and blue as steel,
Into the Roaring Forties
Where howling sea-winds wheel,
To mock the west-bound steamers
And bring the seas to heel.
“To Durban and to Java,
To Hongkong and Port Said,
They’re sailing ere the moon rise
O er roads their keels have laid.”
Oh. honey-sweet the pleading
Of my Blue Water Maid.
“0 Spirit of Blue Waters,”
I said, “my heart says ‘Go!’
I hear the sea songs ringing
In all the winds that blow,
To set the gum-trees swaying
Like tall masts, sweet and slow.
“If I were free I’d follow*;
But since that may not be,
I’ve found new ways to fashion
The magic of the sea,
Without its winds and surges
And shipmen rough and free.”
The Girl of the Blue Waters
Made answer, soft and low:
“They’re letting go the shorelines;
At set of sun they’ll go.
No singers of the forests
Can sing of roads they’ll know.

The road to Guayaquil,

The moonlit road to Santo
Still seems God’s wmrld to fill.”

The Naming of Moses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MANY legends cluster round the name
of “Moses” Joplin, the utterly undis-
tinguished-looking little man who was
brought here to put the Green Funnel Line
on its legs. One of the most curious of
these deals with the events that gave Joplin
his nickname. It happened soon after his
arrival, when nobody knew him but many
cursed him. Patching the leaks and
strengthening the weak spots of a shipping
line that for ten years had suffered under
slack management was' not a job likely
to earn popularity for the man who under-
took it.
Joplin appeared to his subordinates to
work in a very mysterious way his wonders
to perform, but later on they all had to
admit that he had performed wonders. There
came a time when there was only one fly in
his ointment —the skinny showing of the
passenger-boat Dolphinia, which seemed to
be suffering from a sort of boycott.
When the Dolphinia was restored—as she
shortly afterwards was—-to the rank of
an asset, Joplin found he had acquired his
nickname. And it was conferred on him
by people whose knowledge of Moses was
confined to one popular saying about that
celebrated Hebrew.
The story properly starts on a sunny morn-
ing when a common-looking little man with
butter-colored hair, pale grey eyes, three
cheap suitcases and a quiet little mouse of
a daughter walked up the Dolphinia’s gang-
way. Their tickets proclaimed them to be
F. E. Froggatt and daughter. Had you
consulted the directory you would have
learned that F. E. Froggatt was a green-
grocer in one of the least fashionable of
suburbs. The Dolphinia was not to leave
till evening, and Mr. Froggatt nervously
asked that his luggage and that of his daugh-
ter might be placed in their cabins. Quite
obviously he was unused to travelling and
a little bewildered. A merry-eyed young
steward took charge of the suitcases, and
Mr. Froggatt and his daughter went ashore
again to explore the port. They reappeared
about five o’clock and asked to be shown to
their cabins.
A steward indicated the general location
with a contemptuous thumb, but on arriving
there the travellers found that their cabins
were already, apparently, fully occupied. Mr.
Froggatt, who had paid the Line’s highest
tai'iff for undisturbed possession of two deck
cabins, appeared mildly aggrieved, the more
so as he could see no sign of his luggage. He
timidly buttonholed one of the stewards who
were scurrying hither and thither at the
behest of more fortunate passengers, and ex-
plained his predicament.
“You’ll have to see the purser about it,
sir,” was the reply. But it wasn’t easy to
find the purser. He wasn’t in his little
office and nobody could tell poor Mr. Frog-
gatt where he was.
Then the dressing gong went and a little
later Mr. Froggatt and his daughter, in their
street attire, crept into the dining-saloon.
A chief steward with a Napoleonic air inter-
cepted them ere they could take seats at
one of the tables. “Names, please?” he
asked coldly. Mr. Froggatt supplied the
information. “Sorry,” said the Napoleonic
one, not looking a bit sorry, “but you haven’t
been allotted seats.” So Mr. Froggatt and
his daughter, hungry now as well as tired,
had to withdraw from the saloon, half the
chairs in which were empty, objects of much
sardonic interest from a merry group at the
captain’s table. “Second-class passengers
who’ve lost their way,” was one theory.
“Didn’t tip the chief steward,” was another,
and the captain laughed heartily. Mr. Frog-
gatt heard him.
After about an hour or so of pacing the
decks, watching a black sea flecked with
white lace slide monotonously past, and envy-
ing folk who had comfortable beds to go to,
Mr. Froggatt found the purser in his lair.
He professed regret that “the office” had
stupidly sold him cabins that were already
booked. However, he would see what could
be done in the morning.
“In the morning?” echoed Mr. Froggatt
mournfully. “Do you mean to say that
my daughter and I must walk about the
deck all night? We’ve been already turned
out of the saloon.”
The purser shrugged his shoulders. “If I
could do anything for you I would —but there
you are. The office books you for cabins that
are occupied. I can’t turn passengers out
of their berths.”
“But Daddy”—it was the soft voice of Miss
Froggatt that spoke—“l heard a stewardess
say that not half the deck cabins are booked
this trip.”
“I’m sure you misunderstood her, Madam,”
snapped the purser, reddening. “You must
excuse me. I am very busy.”
Mr. Froggatt and his companion spent the
night, which was a cold one, on the boat
deck, on tin' wooden seat there provided.
Fortunately they had brought a pair of rugs
just before coming aboard. An attempt to
secure deck-chairs had been foiled by the dis-
appearance of a steward who ostensibly went
for chairs but failed to return.
In the morning they got seats in the saloon,
the chief steward pretending not to see them.
They waited a long time to be served, but
in time they did eat and they ate very
heartily.
Back on deck Mr. Froggatt spent some
time in meditation before a printed notice
which announced that the captain visited all
parts of the ship at noon each day, and that
passengers were invited to make any com-
plaints to him. “I shall have some com-
plaints to make,” observed Mr. Froggatt to
his daughter. ‘Ale, too," said Miss Froggatt.
“When you were snoozing on the boat-deck
last night that beast of a purser thought I
was alone and came and put his arm round
me.”
“What did you do, Miriam?” asked Mr.
Froggatt.
“I stuck a hatpin in him, and he went.”
“Good,” said Mr. Froggatt, and his eyes
glinted ever so slightly.
The theory that the captain made his
rounds at noon or at any other hour seemed
to lack foundation in fact. Mr. Froggatt
saw no evidence of such a peregrination, and
the late afternoon found him tapping gently
at the door of the commander’s cabin. The
interview was brief. Mr. Froggatt recited
the things that had happened to him and to
his daughter, and almost tearfully threatened
to write a letter of complaint to the manager
of the company. The captain professed him-
self desolated at Mr. Froggatt’s misfortunes,
but felt it his duty to warn Mr. Froggatt
that it wouldn’t do him any good to make
written complaints. Finally he hinted deli-
cately that a few tips might have avoided
a great deal of discomfort and misunder-
standing. “Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Frog-
gatt humbly.
During the rest of the voyage cabin accom-
modation and many other creature comforts
were added unto him and his daughter upon
the production of oblong pieces of tough
paper bearing pictures of gentlemen dis-
covering a country.
But the troubles of the Froggatts were
not yet ended. On the day before they were
to reach their destination —the head office
port—a deputation of two waited upon Mr.
Froggatt in his cabin. It consisted of the
purser and the chief steward, and looking
at their faces Mr. Froggatt, who was a
connoisseur of villains, told himself he had
seldom seen finer specimens. They did not
take long to get to the point.
“Look here,” said the purser with a leer,
“you’re F. E. Froggatt, aren’t you?”
“That’s the name I travel under,” admit-
ted Mr. Froggatt amiably.
“F. E. Froggatt, of Fishburn, green-
grocer?”
Mr. Froggatt nodded. He could sense
what was coming.
“Well,” burst out the purser triumphantly,
“I and my friend here think that Mrs. Frog-
gatt would be very much interested to know
that you’re travelling on this ship with a
woman you call your daughter. We’ve had
you looked up, and you haven’t got a daugh-
ter! Now then, what are you going to do
about it?”
Mr. Froggatt’s face worked for a moment
or two as if hidden forces were seething
within him. Then: “I’ll withdraw my com-
plaint, if that’s what you want,” he said in
a low voice.
The chief steward’s face lit up. “We ain’t
bothering about your complaint,” he jeered.
“It’s our complaint you’ve got to think about.
Turning a respectable ship like this into a” —
(here his remarks became technical).
“I should like to remind you,” said Mr.
Froggatt mildly, “that there’s a young lady
next door. Your language”
“Young lady!” The pair laughed in
unison, and the purser added some refer-
ences to the unmasked Miss Froggatt that
were full of the salt flavor of the sea.
“You arc very insulting,” said Mr. Frog-
gatt, lowering his eyes. ‘How much do you
want ?”
The purser’s criminal visage creased into
amiable folds. “That’s business sense,” he
said. “I wish they were all as sensible.”
And Bill agreed that Mr. Froggatt showed
acumen.
They left the cabin with Mr. Froggatt’s
cheque for £lOO and a sense of gratitude
that obviously was based on a lively sense
of favors to come.
* * - * *
Mr. Froggatt went ashore without his suit-
cases. They couldn’t be found by the stew-
ards, but a detective who boarded the ship
an hour after she tied up had no difficulty
on putting his hands on them. Later a
merry-faced young steward with a police-
record went to gaol for two years because he
couldn’t explain why he hid them and why
he’d sold so many articles belonging to other
people. The same detective arrested the
purser and the chief steward later in the

That backache again!
Why not get at the cause?
MORE than likely your kidneys are to blame. Backache, head-
aches, dizziness, urinary disorders, sciatica, rheumatism,
lumbago, dropsical swellings, gravel and dropsy may all be caused
by harmful impurities which weak or sluggish kidneys have failed
to take out from the blood. Be quick to correct this! Don’t allow
the kidney weakness to go from bad to worse! You run too grave
a risk! Use. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, without any further
delay; they will not fail. Grateful people, everywhere, recommend
this special kidney medicine for relieving and preventing kidney
disorder and its many symptoms.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY
GIVEN HERE.
Mr. Henry Francis, 2 Oxford Street, Bnrwood, Sydney, says: —
“Eighteen months ago I commenced to feel off color. A slight scalding of
the secretions began, and gradually grew worse, until they were intensely
painful, and I could not retain them. A pain then crept up my back, and
I suffered torture. I went into the hospital and was treated there for nine
weeks, and although I came out a little relieved. I was still in pain, and a
week later was as bad as when I went in. By accident I came across a
pamphlet about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and after reading it, I
resolved to give this remedy a trial, so sent for some at once. The first
bottle did not seem to do me much good, but I persevered and while using
the second bottle I got a little ease, and four bottles completely cured me.”
Over twenty years later Mrs. Francis says:—“My husband has great
faith in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always keeps them by him.
This medicine cured him many years ago, and it always acts beneficially
whenever he has occasion to take it.”

PILES AND ECZEMA CURED
BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Eczema Cured.
Mrs. Horwitz, Ethelwood, Hayward
Street, Kensington, Sydney, says : —“I
sent for a pot of Doan’s Ointment, and
used it for Eczema on my little girl’s
forehead. The rash covered the brow
and it was around the eye as well. The
itching was frightful, and it made her
very fretful and kept her from sleeping.
I had used several preparations previous
to getting Doan’s Ointment, but none of
them gave more than passing relief. I
am pleased to tell you that this remedy
cured her completely. We have since
used it on another little girl with
equally good results. Doan’s Ointment
is splendid, and I advise its use in all
itching skin diseases.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Horwitz
states: —“My daughter has not suffered
with Eczema since Doan’s Ointment
cured her eighteen years ago.”
Piles Cured.
Mrs. M. Brown, Toronto, Lyons Road,
Five Dock, Sydney, says : —“Three years
ago I used Doan’s Ointment for a bad
attack of Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previous to
trying this ointment I tried all kinds of
remedies; but they gave me little or no
relief. I was suffering terribly when I
first applied Doan’s Ointment, and had
little hope of it doing me any good; but
its soothing and healing effects were
noticeable almost at once, and by the
time I had used one pot I was com-
pletely cured. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known. It cured me
after other remedies had failed.”
Four years later Mrs. Brown says:—
“I have had no return of my old com-
plaint since Doan’s Ointment cured me
about seven years ago.”

A TIN ALWAYS ON HAND.
day, after they had been to the bank with
Mr. Froggatt’s cheque. They got three years
apiece for forgery and uttering, and narrowly
escaped a further prosecution for perjury,
so insistent were they that one Froggatt,
who at the time was peacefully greengrocer-
ing at Fishburn. had given them his cheque
aboard the Dolphinia as a mark of gratitude
for their kindness to him on the voyage. The
police in these cases owed a good deal to
a source which they referred to mysteri-
ously as “information received.”
As for the captain, he was one of the first
of the seafaring servants of the green Funnel
Line to see Mr. Joplin at the receipt of
custom, as it were. As soon as the
Dolphinia’s ’phone was connected, there was
a call for the captain and a soft voice
asked him to come ashore at once and see
Mr. Joplin at the head office.
“Joplin—who's he?” asked the captain of
the purser.
“New managing-director. Wants to ask
yon to lunch probably,” suggested the purser.
Purserlike, he knew everything.
The captain put on his best uniform and
strode through the beautiful revolving cedar
doors at the head office a blithe and carefree
man. The chief clerk ushered him up the
stairs and left, him at the door. “Just tap,”
he said in an awed whisper, “lie's expecting
you.”
The stout mariner had an awful moment
as he met the calm-faced Mr. Froggatt and
Mr. Froggatt’s quiet little daughter. ”1
was to see Mr. Joplin,” he commenced.
“I’m Joplin,” said the butter-faced man.
“I’m—er informed. Captain, that you don’t
visit quarters as provided in the company’s
regulations, and that you are unable to pre-
serve discipline. I should like you to write
your resignation.” lie spoke dispassionately,
almost sadly, and his eyes were as dull as
lead.
The captain took the pen that was handed
to him and wrote a few lines, lie went
downstairs a broken man and never com-
manded a ship again.
Long afterwards, when his downfall was
complete and the sting was deadened, he
spoke of Joplin to a fellow wastrel on the
beach at Papeete. “He was,” he said reflec-
tively “the meekest man I ever met —and the
most vindictive.”
CHARLES BLAKE.
The Escape of Louis.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LOUIS GOLDBERG, the moneylender of
Portlaud-lane, had no relatives in his
adopted country, and, as far as I could
ascertain, two nephews in V ienna were the
only people who had any personal interest
in him or his affairs. He lived in a well-
furnished room in Darlinghurst, with some
arrangement for food, as required, and he
never entertained. His recreations were an
occasional visit to a cheap vaudeville show,
and the piecing together of jig-saw puzzles
in the solitude of his room. I remember ask-
ing him once why he never married, and his
scornful retort.
“Womans is all fools or bullies —fools that
let a man twist them round his lingers, or
bullies that think all men is doormats.”
“But there are other sorts,” I protested.
“Perhaps so, but I don’t meet them.
Besides, none of them knows the value of
money, except how it to spend.”
“What about that housekeeper of yours V”
I ventured.
“Veil, vat about her?”
“Wouldn’t you be happier with her to look
after you ?”
“I look after myself, thank you.”
And then 1 risked using a word probably
never before heard in that office!
“Weren’t you ever in love, Louis?”
“Love! Love! Acli, vat is dat? A vord!
A vord vitli no meanings.”
“When you were young, wasn’t there ever
a girl you wanted more than anything else
in the world ?”
“I pay you my sigs-and-cightpence for
advice on this bill-of-sale,” he growled, “nod
for talking silly.”
I knew I had touched some little raw spot,
and had to follow it up.
“Never mind the six-and-eightpence,” I re-
plied. “I won’t charge for this interview.”
“There must be some of a voman in you,
eh? Give up a fee to find out what is of
no business to you?”
“Where was it, Louis?” I couldn't stop
now. “And when?”
“A long time ago,” he answered. “Forty,
Gott! Nearly fifty years ago !”
“Was she pretty?”
“As beautiful as —as —oh, I don’t know
now. I forget.”
“And why didn’t you go on with it?”
“Vhy you ask?” he demanded.
“Because I went through with mine, and
I have no regrets.”
“Regreds? Yes, once I had them and
they hurt; they hurt for years.”
“What became of her?”
“She marry my brother, and he is dead
now. She is dead. Her two sons live.”
“Why weren’t they your sons, Louis?”
Then the old man discovered that his eyes
were more than moist, and abruptly ended
the interview.
“I change my solicitor,” he growled, “for
somebody who talk business alone. Vhy
you stir up things from the bottom of the
cup ?”
But before he reached the door he was
the Atlas Finance Company again.
“You promised, eh? No sigs-and-eight for
this interview?” was the end of my effort
to glimpse his soul.
But even with this stereotyped opinion of
“womans” Louis had one narrow escape in
later years. Sudden illness sent him to bed
for a month, with a doctor in daily attend-
ance, and a nurse in complete charge. It was
an entirely new experience. The nurse was
a buxom, competent woman of forty, with a
wide knowledge of human nature.
“You can’t judge a man,” she told me,
“until you have seen him through a serious
illness. I have seen them all —gentlemen,
hogs, heroes, cowards, malingerers, and just
plain men.”
“And which class predominates?” I asked.
“Plain men. Pitiable creatures who must
just be looked after.”
“Which group do you put Louis in?” was
my last question.
“He beat me,” she said. “Sometimes I
felt awfully sorry for him. At others, I
wanted to administer a big overdose of medi
cine. Some days he seemed to be the loneliest
creature in the world, and on others 1
wondered how anyone could give him a
moment’s thought.”
In due time Louis returned to the office,
a grey-faced skeleton with a pathetic whine
in his voice that quite upset the Lane. The
doctor advised him to keep the nurse in
attendance, and for three months she was
on the premises while business was being
transacted in the inner office. As the gaunt
frame filled out again and the old Louis re-
appeared, the Lane became interested in the
nurse. She “managed” her patient with con-
summate skill; humored his outbursts of
irritability, and took him homo every afternoon
at three o’clock, in spite of protests that he
was all right again. Even when he had
apparently quite recovered the nursing con-
tinued, and a rumor went down the Lane:
“()ld Louis has been caught.”
There was no doubt that the nurse was
hanging on with malice prepense. Siie knew
by this time that her patient was wealthy,
and professional intimacy enabled her to
estimate the number of years he would live.
So when the contract ended and the last
week's nursing-fee had been paid, Louis found
that he had a permanent follower.
Once a day Nurse would drop in and sweetly
inquire after his health and offer advice, free
of charge for his physical well-being. This was
a new experience—somebody really interested
in him, someone who was strong, capable,
sympathetic. But for the untimely intrusion
of the Lane’s greatest wit, Romance might
have bloomed on the ground floor of No. 26.
But the wit spoiled it all.
One morning Louis received a specimen
wedding card, with a request for any order
that might be contemplated. The next day
a caterer offered a first-class breakfast at
10s. 6d. per head. Then a bunch of orange-
blossoms was smuggled into the inner office,
and, worst of all, a marriage agency quoted
355. as the fee for a ceremony performed
according to the rites of any Nonconformist
church.
The nurse felt a change in the atmosphere.
Louis was always engaged in the inner office,
and sent out word that In' could not be seen
that day. At last he resolved on final dis-
missal, and leaving a note for delivery, tied
to a mountain resort for a week.
The nurse read the note: “I am quite
well, again and don't require no one to come
and ask me every day how was I. Please
come no more.”
An hour later found her in close consulta-
tion with a solicitor prepared to take up a
breach-of-promise case on spec. Louis put
the defence in my hands with a view of
settlement, but I persuaded him to fight.
Three months later, when the case w r as
withdrawal, he informed me that he
had said something about marriage during
the long period of inaction in bed: “She
vas very kind, and I vas very weak, and I
thought Anyways there vas nodings in
writing, and no presents.”
“Why not marry her?” I asked. “You
might do worse.”
“Might do vorse!” he replied. “That is
saying tings back to front. I must do
better, and Ido better. She vas vun of the
bullying kind. Ant I tell you they are all
fools or bullies!”
Three months later Louis Goldberg re-
ceived notice that the Atlas Finance and Dis-
count Company must prepare for immediate
dissolution. I received an urgent message
to visit his room, and met the doctor on the
landing.
“Serious?” I asked.
“A matter of a few days,” lie replied. “A
month at the very outside. The heart is
falling to pieces.”
I found the old man propped up in bed,
with the housekeeper in attendance.
“I tell you,” he said to her as I entered,
“I vill have no more nurse. I rather pay you
as much as a nurse to look to me.”
I tried to be cheerful, but with little
success. The misery of that shrivelled old face,
with its touch of fear, chilled me through
and through.
■ “He say I die.” he whispered.
“Yes,” I said bluntly, “you’ve got to face
it, Louis. Want me to fix your will?”
“You in a great hurry now, eh? Want to
see the end of me quick, eh?”
“I want to fix your will.”
“But I -know that once a will is signed
I die.”
“Don’t talk damned nonsense. I signed
mine ten years ago, and I intend to live
another forty.”
“Ah, but you have somebody—vife, child-
ren. I —I” and the tears rolled down
liis face.
“Stand up to it. Louis. Every tear you
shed, every second you are excited, takes a
minute off your life.”
“So?” he said. “Is dat true? Don’t say
noding till I speak to you.”
I waited five minutes, and then he said
in calmer tones: “I don’t know what to
do mid all my money.”
“Start off by giving all your customers a
clean receipt.” I suggested.
“Don’t make of my misery a joke,” he
pleaded. “I have fifteen thousand pounds
out. It is all clear in the ledger.”
“I can only follow your instructions. Tell
me what you want to do with it.”
“I must have time to think it out.”
“Look here, Louis, you and time may part
company at any minute. Make up your
mind.”
“Not any minute,” he whispered, “he says
days—perhaps weeks.”
It was painful business, and I had daily
interwiews for the next week, sometimes two
in a day. We got through the preliminaries
—£soo to the Jewish Benevolent Society;
£2OO for his own tombstone; a funeral
regardless of expense, with eight mourning-
coaches ; £J 0 to the housekeeper; a fund to
provide £3O a year for the upkeep of two
graves, his own, and that of Denis Regan.
But beyond that, I could not get him. I
suggested the two nephews, but he was
afraid of them; one was a musician, the
other a painter of pictures. They would
squander his money. At last in desperation
I prepared a will, the last line being: “I
give and bequeath all the rest and residue of
my estate to —” leaving ample space for
the filling in of any names decided upon.
But the will was never signed. True to
his principles Louis Goldberg could not give
things away, and in due course the nephews,
as next of kin, claimed the estate. They
didn’t even leave behind the £2OO for a
tombstone.
