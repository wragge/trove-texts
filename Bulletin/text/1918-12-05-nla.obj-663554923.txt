The Red Page
The Search for Abraham’s Diary
When the war is finished and the Turk
has packed his ignorance in a carpet-bag and
his torpidity in a brown-paper parcel, and
hied him to more congenial haunts, I would
like to see a Literary and Biblical Protecto-
rate formed over the Scriptural lands. It
should be composed mainly of learned men
from Britain, France, Italy, and Greece,
these being the nations best acquainted with
the subject. There might be one Belgian and
one American, but Belgium has never shown
much interest in Scriptural research and
United States religion is rather of the emo-
tional and Moody and Sankey order. 1
would add a capable Syrian who knows the
Holy Land by heart, and a wise Egyptian
who could advise on the Pharaohs, the Jew-
ish community of Alexandria and the close
relations between Hebrew and Egyptian his-
tory ; also a squad of German theologians to
do piek-and-shovel work in chains. The
Protectorate should be well supplied with
funds and given large powers over all the
country from the Euphrates, where Adam
was born, to the Mediterranean. And it
should dig like Sited to find out the founda-
tions of our faith. It is not a very large
country, and most of it is soft soil and easy
digging.
The old people of that land were accus-
tomed, in the absence of paper, to inscribe
important records on tiles or imperishable
bricks. Great edifices, built of futile sun-
dried materials died early, and when they
settled down like squashed toads and became
mounds whole libraries were buried beneath
them. Erudite persons, working in the
limited way that the limited intelligence of
the Turkish Government allowed, have dug
up and dusted and deciphered a great deal
in recent years; yet they are only on the
first leg of the letter A of the business. They
hope to really start when the Turk ceases
to stand behind the investigator and breathe
in his ear.
What is especially wanted is evidence con-
cerning Old Testament characters. If the
Bible lauds are systematically dug up and no
well-defined reef of corroboration is found
it will be disappointing. The Old Testa-
ment was written by Jews of the latter and
more inflated days, who regarded themselves
not only as the centre of mankind but as
the hub of the universe and the chief reason
of God. One of their traditions even repre-
sents Jehovah as looking up the Hebrew
books for guidance and information. There-
fore they give a somewhat one-sided view.
So far as is really known from the records
of the great nations Israel was an outlying
place which was regarded as having a flicker
of importance under David and Solomon, and
a smaller flicker afterwards in the days of
Omri. Only Solomon left a very conspicuous
footmark outside the Hebrew’s ex parte state-
ment of his own importance, and Solomon
appears in tradition chiefly as a wizard, a
raiser of good, bad and dubious spirits, a
person who discoursed with the dead, the
unborn, the disembodied and the stars —in
short, as a cultured potterer and dreamer and
dabbler who could use the public treasury to
pay for plenty of dabbling materials. The
rest of the so-called kings were practically
tributaries, like many more at that place and
time, paying money and apology to some big
neighbor. The big nations around don’t
seem to have been any more aware of them
than of any other race of the same size,
despite the miracle-working abilities of their
prophets. Apparently the Hebrew was just
an ordinary lodger in the doss-house of
Western Asia—the doss-house of which
Assyria, Babylon and Persia were the most
notable landlords —until after he practically
gave up the pretence of independence. Then
Pharisees and the like added an element of
fanaticism to his previous easy-going creed,
and thereby drew attention to him. He be-
came so cantankerous that he was bound to
attract some attention. Also the Christian
passed a resolution that his writings were 5
absolutely authentic —in fact, infallible —
which gave him a new importance. If the
Philistine, who had the next room on the
same landing of the Assyx-ian doss-house, or
the Phoenician on the floor above, had known
that their neighbor was an infallible letter-
writer the notes they left about him ought
to have been less skimpy. The question is,
did anybody know and did he know himself?
When the bit of country from Adam in the
east to Jonah in the west is investigated by
learned and painstaking men it is certain,
judged by the results already achieved, that
hundreds of tons of corroboration will turn
up. And if Hebrew corroboration is absent
or isn’t found in quantities that pay the
cost of crushing—if Abraham’s diary and
every other diary which might be expected
is missing—then the Hebrew record will
remain as one of the poorly verified publica-
tions of the world. The brick document
which is found many feet underground among
the dry foundations of a dead building is
almost always an original manuscript, and
the signature, if any, is genuine. The paper
affair in circulation above ground is a copy
edited no one knows - how often by no one
knows whom. It may even be the work of a
bogus editor who professed to be toiling over
a mouldy original that only existed in his
imagination. The finding of even a page from
Abraham’s diary would be comforting in the
circumstances.

C. .T. Brennan lias written some of Aus-
tralia’s finest poetry, and holds a permanent
place as one of Australia’s greatest scholars.
Whenever he sings or speaks he must com-

of Doom,” does not show either the man or
the poet at his highest and best, it can still
be claimed that the book takes a foremost
place among the volumes of verse which the
war has produced. There is some very force-

wherever
installed
DELCO-L/GHT IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and DURABLE.
DELCO-LIGHT consists of an engine, generator,
switchboard and set of batteries. The engine
and generator are direct connected, which does
away with any transmission losses or belt trouble, in-
creasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage
battery is of the special Delco-Light type, consisting of
sixteen glass jar cells, delivering 32-volt current. Unless
the demand for light and power is very heavy, it is
unnecessary to run the engine, except when the storage-
battery requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of
the generating unit. Wires lead from the light and power
connections to this storage-battery, from which electric
current is used as desired for light or power.
You will find Delco-Light to be a model of simplicity.
When it becomes necessary to re-charge the battery the
engine is started by merely pressing on the starting-
switch located on the switchboard. This electrically
cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts
running on its own power in a few seconds. It can then
be left to itself, as when the battery is completely charged
the Delco-Light engine stops automatically.
f
The supply of kerosene is regulated by means o
a simple lever-operated mixing valve. Moving the lever
to the right or left regulates the supply of fuel.
There is only one place to put oil. The crank case
is designed to hold about three quarts of oil, and a rapidly
revolving gear carries a fine spray to all parts requiring
lubrication.
The reliability of Delco-Light has been proved through
actual service under trying conditions. It has been
thoroughly tested in every possible way, both in the shop
and in practical service on the farm and in the home.
Nothing has been left to chance. The tests have been
more severe than any service an owner would require.
Delco-Light is made by the same Works which have
Delco-Lighted and started over one million Motor-cars.

We wish to stress the fact that ECONOMY is one of the chief attributes of
Bostock Shoe Dressings. It is economical by virtue of the fact that it is more
than a mere polish.
Containing, as it does, ingredients which nourish and preserve the leather, it gives
longer life to footwear.
With the coat of shoes mounting
higher and higher, the daily use
of Bostock’s, with its leather-
preserving qualities, is particu-
larly desirable.

What is Punch in Petrol?
YY7HEN your engine literally
* ’ “purrs” wilh power— when
you feel your car just HUMMING
along and you know that the
acc2lerator needs but a gentle
foot-pressure to make her LEAP
like a live thing —THEN you’re
wise to what “punch” is, and
glad you specified “Plume.”
It’s always best to ask for your
Benzine by name and call for
“Plume” if you want the petrol
with the “punch.”
Most motorists know that “Plume”
gives easy starting, sweet running,
more miles.
Don’t say “Benzine” —ask for
“Plume.” All garages sell it.

Shallow Graves.
After peace is declared a large section of the
A.I.F. is to be detailed for garrison duty in Belgium
and France.
The broken streets are calm at last,
Our soldiers hold the shattered gate;
Blind Evil and his crimes are cast
Beyond the walls to timeless Fate;
And through the moonshine brown ghosts
sweep
On rising grave-dust clouds and waves
The Anzacs’ promised watch to keep,
God-given in their shallow graves.
“Keep guard,” He said, “of all that stands
In stone on blackened stone, and keep
The peace I gave the riven lands;
Take heed that children now may sleep
In quiet through the night again;
And see that women are not slaves
To stolen power anon.” The men
Saluted by their empty graves.
The tall men pacing by the gate
Greet grim-moutlied hosts of shadows tall.
Warm hands clasp cold hands coming late,
And ghostly voices call and call.
The dead and living, side by side,
Watch o’er the city’s broken shell;
And none knows there that he has died
Whate’er the shallow graves may tell.

Grey Days.
Let all endeavor cease, for once again
There comes soft sorrow falling from the
sky;
Drop the worn hands and let the world
go by,
And listen to the whispering of the rain.
So much it murmurs to the brooding heart:
Old things, strange things, vague, fitful
melodies
Charming the soul to wan, Lethean ease
In its sad, silvery fairyland apart.
Ghost-like it moves between the tender
leaves,
Creeping and rustling to the burdened
grass,
And softly thuds, while lingering moments
pass,
The languid pulse of drops along the eaves.

Carrots.
The red-headed boy goes down the way
With threepence to spend or a game to play,
And a whoop and a shout for the day that
comes
With a tramp of feet and a roll of drums.
“Carrots!’’ they cry as' he passes by—
The red-lieaded boy with the good grey eye.
The red-headed boy is a pirate born;
Laws and the edicts he holds in scorn.
A viking of grubby back lanes is he
With a dream-ship moored to the moods of
the sea.
“Carrots!” they call; but their cheeks will
pale
When he draws his blade and he spreads his
sail.
The red-headed boy has a fine lip curled
In scorn of the common things of the world.
Little he recks of the school-time bell,
And the might of his fancy the lanes know
well —
With his heart aglow with the fires of
Spring
Each boy is a lord, but “Carrots” is king.

Leaf Land.
Was it the leaves as they leaned above us,
Or some wild wing in its earthward flight,
Or the sun and the wind that seemed to love
us,
Or a loosened cloud that was far and
white,
A lace of fern in the quiet places,
Almost a glimpse of the fairies’ faces,
The crystal bowl of the hidden spring,
Or the hot earth, pulsing in everything?
I shall take it down to the grave with me
And over the rim of mystery,
The breath of the wind and the scent of the
tree
And the spice of a green bough’s witchery.
The taste of tears on my lips shall lie
When Love’s forever has passed them by!
I shall take it down to the grave with me,
For the wise earth whispers of grass and
tree,
And I knew that these things had guided me
For an hour’s loving to find—and free!
So the moist brown roots that about me press
May thrill my dust with old happiness!

Summer Night
Dear, here’s my life.
Will you make it a song?
Will you make it a rose?
The tune may go wrong.
The flower die —who knows?
Here is my life.
Will you make it a star?
Will you make it a dream?
The planets may jar,
I may wake from my dream.
But you and I are
Under a starry sky—
Here is my life,
Make it or mar,
Cruelly bend,
Clumsily mend,
So foolish am I,
Tt is yours to the end.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1918.
WHITE AUSTRALIA IN THE
BALANCE.
Irish-American societies are combining to present
a petition to President Wilson asking him to use
his influence at the Peace Conference in favor of
the political freedom of Ireland.
Australian Labor leaders have cordially congratu-
lated the Bolsheviks in Russia.
Among the proposals which the Japanese Govern-
ment intends making at the Peace Conference is
that Japanese citizens should ha.ve “reciprocity
rights throughout the world.” —News items.
One of the possibilities of the peace is that
subjects which have nothing to do with the
peace may be dragged in. Certainly well-
meaning people, also ill-meaning people, by
passing resolutions about the internal affairs
of other countries, are supplying precedents
which may prove to be loaded. Australians
haven’t been worse than some others in
that respect, but as they live in the biggest
glass house on earth they should most care-
fully avoid the needless throwing of stones.
Diplomacy has lost some of its old-fashioned
politeness, partly owing to Hun methods and
partly owing to Mr. Hughes's speeches. So
a nation which regards itself as overcrowded,
and is strong enough to state that contra-
diction will be an unfriendly act, is bound
to raise the question of the right of an
almost emptv State to shut out immigrants.
Australia, with nearly 3,000,000 square miles
and less than two persons to the mile, abo-
rigines included, is the one empty place that
is worth arguing about. Its immigration
laws don’t ostensibly discriminate against
Asiatics, but the application of them does.
Japan, with 336 people to the square mile,
is sufficiently stuffy and breathless to have
a case to present. It will be the one Asiatic
State with a place at the Peace Conference
table at which to present its case, and with
force and prestige to back it up. Also it
will appear as the one Asiatic State which
can claim so high a civilisation that its
people can’t be barred as an inferior race.
Some members of the Conference may have
doubts about the height of the civilisation,
but none of them, except, possibly, the
United States, will have the least interest
in expressing their doubts.
Of course, strict justice will be done in
the matter. It always is. The trouble is
that the strongest party decides what is
justice, as the Huns did when they invaded
Serbia. And Australia’s self-governing
rights will be strictly respected. Unfortu-
nately, not being a State, but only part of
one, and a very small part in point of num-
bers, foreign relations are not exactly with-
in our self-governing rights. Still, if Aus-
tralia was independent it would have less
say in the matter than it has now. A large
country with less than two persons to the
square mile and with the bulk of its terri-
tory not even accessible to its own armies
through scarcity of ships and absence of
railways, has no self-governing rights at all
save by accident.
The proposition to be made, when the
Allies sit round a table and begin to con-
sider the affairs of all and sundry, is- that
every Allied person will have free admission
and right of settlement in (very Allied coun-
try. (Incidentally, it is suggested that
Japan shall have the right to preserve order
in Siberia, which may mean indefinite occupa-
tion, and certainly means a lot of free admis-
sion ; but, then, Russia isn’t an Ally now.
Anyhow, nothing is even hinted about a right
to preserve order in Australia.) On these
principles the Australian would be fully
authorised to take up land in Japan where
there is less than two acres per inhabitant —
if he could find land ; and to work at Japan-
ese wages if he liked them. In return, the
Japanese might come to the Northern Terri-
tory (about 100,000 acres per inhabitant) or
Queensland (about 700 acres per inhabitant),
where there has lately been a strike because
£6 a week was an insufficient wage. If the
same sort of treaty of mutual admission and
free settlement had been made between the
Black Hole of Calcutta on its busy day and
Robinson Crusoe’s island before Man Fri-
day happened along, there is no doubt as to
which place would have been swamped by
immigrants and would have lost its identity
and perhaps its independence. Whether any-
thing specially unpleasant will be said about
the use the Australians are making of their
country—whether the theory may be ad-
vanced that they don’t really seem to want
the country —is another matter. This is a
land where the manufacturing population
doesn’t grow very fast., because the people
who make tariffs hate to interfere with the
blessed importer. The agricultural popula-
tion is diminishing after a temporary boom,
because the farmer can’t eat all his own
wheat, and there are few artisans to buy it
from him, while foreign markets are remote
and at present rather crowded. The North-
ern Territory railway is the supreme test as
to whether the Commonwealth wants the
North or not, and it was the condition on
which the old northern Crown colony was
ceded to South Australia. The railway
makes hardly any progress, and there are
papers like the Melbourne Age which sug-
gest that this defensive work should be
abandoned because in its unfinished state it
doesn’t pay interest on the loan. If it had
been built out of revenue, as a great national
and defensive work should be, then no paper
could clamor that Australia should throw its
heritage and its destiny overboard because
this essential part of them didn’t pay interest
on the sordid unburied corpse of the loan.
The necessary outlay would have been paid
and forgotten, like the cost of discovering
America or founding the Christian religion,
both of which achievements might be aban-
doned in disgust even at this late hour if
they had been done with loan money after
the Australian fashion, and people grew tired
of seeing the old bill lying around.
* * « #
So, to put the matter shortly, the White
Australia question is not necessarily settled
yet. In fact, it is, likely to become more
unsettled than it ever was before. The one
Government which has .consistently objected
to the Commonwealth’s immigration policy
is now in a vastly stronger position to object
than it was 17 years ago, and has given
notice of motion. And Australia hasn’t made
so much progress, except in building
up debts and creating a widely-dis-
trusted Bolshevik party, as to greatly
strengthen its case. It has wasted a great
opportunity to pfove that White Australia is
a live institution, and not merely a chronic
cadger with an lOU in its hand—a country
that couldn’t supply ships or munitions of
its own making, or pay its own soldiers, and
which clamored in the worst days of stress
for money to build culverts with and for
the purchase of a reluctant parent of wheat
which it couldn’t deliver. The British Gov-
ernment professed no interest at all in the
White Australia movement 17 years ago. but
there being no real opposition except from
a second-rate Pow’er which didn't matter, it
let the affair pass. Now that the second-rate
Power has become a first-rate one. and
Britain has had the experience of
becoming acquainted with Mr. Hughes, and
has heard that Labor members are talking
about repudiating the public debt, its utter
lack of interest may change into hostility.
THE WAY TO HELL IS WHEAT.
Wheat died last week, and was buried, and
its soul went to perdition. Or, at the least,
it died as an article of exported merchandise,
and the date of the blessed resurrection isn’t
fixed. During the war Australia appeared
before the world as pre-eminently a raw-
material country, dependent on its "great
natural resources” and its loans, and afflicted
by Bolshevik cranks who, in the name of
Labor, opposed every attempt to promote in-
dustry as a device of the oppressor. A Gov-
ernment, that was Bolshevik without know-
ing it, assisted by confiscating most of the
earnings of new industry as “war profits.”
So Australia failed utterly to manufacture
ships, and for want of them its surplus
wheat couldn’t get away. More energetic
countries put on a spurt and increased their
output so as to make Australia s product
superfluous. Even densely-peopled England
made such a sudden effort that it can now do
without the incompetent land which failed so
badly. Being abjectly implored by Prime
Minister Hughes and suite, aided by Navy
Minister Cook and suite, and supported by
High Commissioner Fisher at £5OOO a year
and suite, the British Government seems to
have offered to take some grain at a price
which will yield even the fairly large farmer
a wage of about nothing a year with no
interest on the money he has invested. The
United States has been even less cordial.
Australia was in a position to do some busi-
ness with the Pacific Coast States, they bein-
a long railway journey from the biggest
grain-raising centres. Uncle Saji cut off
that competition by shutting out Australian
wheat in one act. If it is found inside
Abraham Lincoln’s country it will pre-
sumably be burned by the common hangman
—or electrocuted. Canada and Argentina
have also vast crops to dispose of. Most of
our rivals have managed to provide them-
selves with ships, of which Australia is still
short, so they have an earlier call on the
market.
* * * *
At this crisis the drought receives further
official recognition. In N. S. Wales, for in-
stance, the area actually sown with wheat
was 5,122,245 acres in 1915, whereas this
year it is only 3,195,400 acres. Of that one-
third has dried up, and some of the balance
looks none too promising. Wheat represents
two-thirds of all the agriculture in Australia
—in fact, agriculture consists of this sub-
stance and some oddments —so the position
can be estimated. There is talk, of course,
about the necessity for supplying seed to
farmers and for the usual expensive aids.
The old gang of ignorant Foreign-trade
bigots still proposes to settle returned soldiers
on the land and shove them into this
depressed industry and others like it. .Sena-
tor Millen is Minister for Repatriation, and
lie states frankly that he sees no need to
worry about establishing new manufactures.
The old nostrum is good enough for him. It
is estimated that soldiers can be marooned
on the land for about £2OOO each. The cost
so far seems to be about £2500 each for the
bit of dirt, the implements, house, miscel-
laneous improvements, seed, and some sus-
tenance till the crop comes up, if it doesn’t
stay down. Yet, in many cases, it is alleged
that the dirt is poor and inadequate. Of
course, there are liable to be payments, in
subsequent years of drought or flood or low
prices, to keep the settler on the dirt; that,
sort of thing is always happening. The bill
at £2OOO each would be £200,000,000 for
100,000 settlers, many of whom will fail, for
a great rush can hardly be arranged without
pushing out the fringe of settlement beyond
even the precarious, line of payable cultiva-
tion. It may be that they will practically
all fail. In a country where a good crop is
half or less than half as many bushels per
acre as in some competing countries; where
drought-failures are common; where for
want of industrial workers to make a suffi-
cient demand the price realised is any nigger-
labor price that may rule in the most distant
market possible and where even the chance
of reaching that market depends mostly on
the aid of foreign Private Enterprise ship-
owners—in such a country wheat-growing is
a wretched business. It was right
enough till a few years ago, but the
boom in settlement made the distant foreign
market the deciding factor in the matter of
price. Then the dying out of the inland
towns made the One Big City the chief
reliance as a local market, and as the settler
went further out the One Big City became
further away.
* * * • *
The cost of settling a returned soldier in a
manufacturing industry is not £3OOO or
£2500 or even £2OOO. It is, on the average,
£265. That is the value in land, buildings,
machinery, etc., employed per settler. As a
rule the industry is drought-proof, and it
doesn’t go begging very often for seed-wheat.
It pays better wages, on the average, than
agriculture. And though it costs £205 to
settle each employee, manufacturing industry
doesn’t expect the community to float big
loans and find the money as the new agricul-
ture does, with its demand for £2OOO per
head. It has a general habit of finding the
money itself. All that it asks Is that the
State shall not block progress by stealing,
under the name of war profits, half or three-
fourths of all new earnings; and that it
shall be put on something like the same tariff
basis as the big white nations which com-
pete against Australia in the Pacific. Manu-
facturing has a future before it, for there is
a big market right here. This country im-
ports as much as £77,000,000 worth of
goods in a year, and if the manufactured
goods included in this total were made here
it would about double the aggregate busi-
ness, and supply sustenance for 316,000
workers, with their families and dependants,
in addition to the 316,000 the country has
already. There is no such local market
awaiting the man whom Senator Millen is
shoving, at ruinous cost, on to the dust. In
fact, there is no local market at all. for it is
already filled; so he must depend on the
foreign one, out of which the bottom has
dropped so badly. Poor and neglected as
Australian manufactures are, they produced
in 1914 —the last normal year before the war
upset the old order of things—nearly
twice as much value as agriculture.
It was in 1910 that they began to
get in front, and, barring one year of
phenomenal food prices, they have kept ahead
ever, since. Yet manufacturing production
has only half overtaken the local demand; so
it has a future as well as a past. The wheat
business, being reduced in a great degree to
scratch for a living abroad, competing with
more fertile and accessible countries pro-
vided with cheaper labor, has no future
under present conditions. But it will have
one when the artisan population grows 50
or 100 or more per cent.
* * * *
The old Foreign-trade gang which talks
land settlement wdth an automatic jaw
merely overlooks the fact that the boom has
been and has gone. In the Ma State, which
boomed hardest, the wheat area increased
sixfold in the 20 years to 1915-16. Then
the slump set in, and if the causes of it
remain it will do likewise. In fact, it may
rather increase than diminish, despite much
passionate exhortation and liberal advances
out of the loan funds. Exhortation is wasted
on slumps.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Jolt for the Party Joss.
THEBE is a frowsy story behind it all, but
that can stand over. When the Holman
Government submitted to the X. S. Wales
Assembly the other night the introduction of
an Electoral Reform Bill, the question of
what the “reform” contents should be was
left open to he decided on the vote. Minis-
terial followers were divided between propor-
tionalism and preferential ism. The Ministry
could count on a majority for neither. For
this reason Holman and Co. decided to
avoid defeat by letting the majority decide
and then to make the policy of the majority
the policy of the Government. The propor-
tionalists won by a big majority. Holman
who had gone outside to sit on the fence
while the division was taken, promptly
ceased to be a preferentialist, and the Elec-
toral Reform he advocated took shape and
substance. Whereupon burbling noises were
heard about all this being “a lamentable dis-
play of weakness” and “government by pitch-
and-toss” and “a deplorable example of a
Ministry having no fixed principles.” and in-
sulting remarks about Holman were dis-
tributed either gratis or at Id. a copy. Well.
The Bulletin is not particularly addicted
to proposing Holman’s health in a few
aptly-chosen words, but. taking all the
circumstances into consideration, he did
the right thing. The reflection that
he saved his face or found a policy,
or got out of a hole or something, is
only a superficial detail. The real question
is whether he acted in public interest.
The answer can only be —Yes. He accom-
plished this not by making proportionalism
his policy, but by shaking himself and the
Assembly free from the degrading chains of
Party—by allowing the work of Parliament
to be determined in the way it would be
under an Elective Ministry, and would
always be if the aforesaid chains were flung
off the premises. "What would have been the
alternative to Holman’s action? Everybody
knows, including those who gabbled about
“Ministerial responsibility.” There would
have been a caucus. The party drum would
have been banged. Threats of dissolution
would have supervened. The dreary old
wire-pull would have prevailed. Ministers
would have come down dragging their party
along like a dead snake, thrown their pro-
posals on the table, and in the name of the
Great Joss Party the rest would have been
easy. Thus legislation is usually passed in
Australian Parliaments, and it is in hopes
of continuing the habit that Labor-leader
John Storey frenziedly announces that “We
only want two parties here.” Naturally
John wants nothing else. He objects to the
elector voting as a free man. He objects to
the individual thrown up on top at the ballot
voting according to his belief. But John is
not the population outside who pays the bill
and reaps the consequences of Party. There
is the possibility that by some trick the
machine may be worked to kill this Electoral
Bill—that Holman may repent and side-
step. The Bulletn hopes not. and exhorts
its young friend to follow the light. Obvi-
ously much of what is said about propor-
tional representation is absurd. The allega-
tion that it will kill political parties in the
electorate and in the Legislature is ridicu-
lous. That it may kill the tyranny of Par-
liament over the elector is possible.

The Germ that is Imitating the Hun.
Tiie problem of whether Australia would
import a disease of very great virulence has
been wrestled with by the Commonwealth
quarantine officers at Sydney Heads during
the past month. Up to the time of writing
the efforts of the germ to pervade the con-
tinent have been beaten. But the barrier
between this undesirable emigrant and the
blood-stream of the community is narrow,
and until the last germ is lost Sydney is
The Belfries of Strassburg.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the of M. ra Dkitrich. Mayor of Stra-s-
-burg, was sung, in April, 1792, the song of ‘The
Army of the Rhine,” by Rouget tie Lisle, which was
eventually immortalised tinder the name of ‘The
Marseillaise.’ ” —S. M. Herald, 21 jll/’IS.
The Statue of Strassburg is flooded with
light.
The people of Strassburg are joy-mad to-
night :
The belfries, vibrating like ships on the sea.
Peal back through the Ages that Strassburg
is free !
Three hundred brave thousands rejoicing to
tears,
Their firm faith unshaken through forty
dark years!
Look back through five hundred, like haze
on the sea.
And Strassburg was great and her people
were free!
The fame of her marshals was known to the
world ;
The armies of Greed from her grey walls
she hurled.
She sang to the Nations, for your sake and
mine,
The Song of the Army that watched on the
Rhine.
Her belfries are rocking that pealed to the
Gauls:
“In peace or in danger, keep ward on the
walls!”
For Crown and Republic—Republic or
Crown —•
Oh, Strassburg held out after Paris went
down !
* # * *
Her belfries are silent, her people asleep;
Her poets are dreaming of rampart and
keep;
On dream-scapes, of walls that were long
swept away,
The shades of her burghers keep watch tdl
the Day!
N.s.w.
HENRY LAWSON.


going to live on the verge of anxiety. It
is a matter for satisfaction that Australia s
medical men. and particularly the 1 üblic
Health officials, decided—as nearly as could
be decided on the hare information that they
had—that the epidemic recently sweeping
Europe, South Africa and America was not
mere “influenza.” Had they decided, other-
wise, the Commonwealth would certainly be
now suffering the most unfortunate experi-
ence of Maoriland. The quarantine provisions
in Maoriland seem to be so extraordinarily
elastic that the Commonwealth Government
will be evading a very obvious duty unless it
takes swift notice —more notice than it has
so far taken —of quite possible calamity.
The sequence pf events during the last few
weeks have been such as to give the Com-
monwealth Health Department the strongest
reason for turning the cold eye of suspicion
across the Tasman. Through either somno-
lent carelessness or downright ignorance or
worse Maoriland admitted the scourge of
infectious pneumonia to her cities and
threatened it to the gates of Australia. The
inescapable lesson for the Commonwealth is
that the time is more than ripe for having a
few words with its neighbor. There is
apparently no doubt that the epidemic was
loaded into M.L. from the Niagara, even if.
as Massey says, cases of the disease had
been known to be in the isles before her
arrival. The Niagara was the ship that
Massey and }-Premier Ward
arrived back from a jaunt. According to his
own account the Minister for Health wired to
Auckland for information about the sickness
on board, and being informed that though
there had been a death from bronchial pneu-
monia the disease aboard was “purely in-
fluenza.” On that the Minister ordered that
the vessel be cleared inwards. There is
something almost tragic about this. Whether
the Minister was misled by someone or was
oblivious to what was going on elsewhere on
the earth, or whether every intelligent medi-
cal thought had left Maoriland is not quite
clear. Maoriland has been given a raw
deal.

The Discouraged and Disparaged
Holman.
As a man with an aspect of injured inno-
cence and a tendency to forgive his enemies,
combined with a look "of wild surprise that
he should be so misjudged, Premier Hoi-
man, of N. S. Wales, has a record. No
half-burnt Pecksniff at the stake was ever
more magnanimous towards his detractors.
Thus in one of his recent editions, when he
published himself at Braidwood before a
large audience, he almost froze at the con-
templation of his own good qualities and
those of his colleagues. Walking round him-
self and viewing himself dispassionately
from all angles, he was driven to mention
these things, among others: —
... .the unreasonable and unfair attitude of a sec-
tion of the press. For some reason the Govern-
ment could do no risrht. Whatever they did or
tried to do, according to a section of the press, was
wrong. ...As far as it was humanly possible all
legislation had been carefully thought out, and
every item of expenditure thoroughly gone through
and looked over by responsible Ministers time and
again before being given effect to. The Nationalist
Government was in power to legislate for the very
best interests of the State. When they found,
however, that absolutely no encouragement was
forthcoming from the press, it was, to say the least
of it discouraging and disconcerting. ... .During
the war the circumstances had been exceptional
At one period during the war Parliament had prac-
tically to shut up for several weeks to allow mem-
bers to assist in recruiting. How could they, under
circumstances such as these, earmark every three-
pennv piece or place a finger on every small item
of expenditure? Legislation did certainly go behind.
What did that matter so long as the war was won?
Well. The Bulletin can say with convic-
tion that it never discouraged Holman. It
tried to do so more than once on the ground
that his public finance was more crazy,
more ruinous and more shoddy than
anything it ever before heard of, but
he didn’t discourage worth 2d. One
might as well have attempted to dis-
courage Mepiiistopheles, or Gabriel the
archangel. Then in sanguine moments The
Bulletin aimed to disconcert Holman
about various things, including the shameless
and childishly silly Norton Griffiths con-
tract, which even a monetary or cash rabbit
should have seen to be loaded. _ But the
Auditor-General, who had an official status
in the matter, said things about that busi-
ness which should have disconcerted an ele-
phant or a brass image, and the man
addressed onlv posed a little harder as a new
rare type of financial genius. He didn’t dis-
concert. He was never the disconcerting
sort. There is no reason to cast doubts on
his statement that every item of expenditure
was thoroughly gone through, so he need not
worry about that. Holman and his gang
would have gone through six times the ex-
penditure if they had had the chance, and
the press has admitted it. His apparent
delusion that he was a sort of Bill Adams
at the Battle of Waterloo, up to his eyes in
military affairs, and that he really had to
neglect the work he was paid for, and let
the finances go to the dogs, and put on extra
taxes, and let the Civil Service fill up with
superfluous parasites while he drove the
Huns out of Belgium may have been coldly
received. It may even be that almost every-
body save himself regarded it as a braying
ass of a proposition and worse than Web-
ster’s poems. But the Premier certainly
wasn’t so disconcerted or depressed as to give
up the Bill Adams pose. He is still wan-
ning the war, though the w’ar seems to be
over. This paper really hasn’t complained
so much as might be supposed about the
things that Holman has done. Its main
complaint is that he is the sort of man who
naturally does such things. The fault isn’t
entirely his. Holman’s mistake in imagin-
ing himself a financier wrnuld be no better
and no worse if he imagined himself an
admiral or an oil-painting or Queen Eliza-
beth. The Bulletin has not the least desire
to undeceive him about himself, for it never
argues w r ith an imaginary oil-painting. It
only tries now r and then to undeceive other
people about him. _____
Removing the State Capitals.
The complaint about the unhealthy crowd-
ing together of people is loud and chronic in
Melbourne and Sydney; also it is not quite
so chronic in Adelaide and Brisbane. Civili-
sation. of course, makes a certain gathering
together of people unavoidable. They have
to be near the machines. ’Possum-hunting,
for instance, is a solitary industry which
doesn’t lead to the slum life; ship-building
and iron-founding are quite different. The
purely Australian policy which aims at kill-
ing off the small towns and their factories,
and forcing everything into one centre, natu-
rally aggravates the evil. When two-thirds
or three-fourths of the factories and work-
shops of a State half as large again as
France or Germany, and more than one-
third the size of Russia, are deliberately
herded into one city, the artisan population
must live not only in the city but in that
part of it which is devoted to factories. It
is a rare Australian disease, and one that is
carefully cultivated. Australia, in addition,
has another disease which makes for conges-
tion. It consists in putting the seat of
government in the biggest city, so that, so
far as possible, all the vast mass of public
servants will hang out there, and reduce the
sleeping and breathing space to a minimum.
This makes the cost of public buildings as
high as it can possibly be made. They are
built where wages are most lofty (they
usually are in the biggest city), and land
most expensive. Also, it doesn’t help the
country producer, who wants several mar-
kets scattered over the country instead of
only one. Incidentally, it means that every-
thing is run from the big city, in the big
city’s interests, and by people with the big
city’s point of view. To them the country
and the small towns are foreign possessions,
with strange, uncouth, bush-like instincts.
Some countries, including the United States,
South Africa and Canada, have reversed
this idea. The U.S. capital is the 15th or
16th place in point of population. New
York, which is close to being the biggest
thing of its kind in the world, isn’t even the
capital of its State; Albany, which is smaller
than Brisbane, and ranks a poor fifth on the
State list, has the job. Chicago has a popu-
lation of 2,500,000, but the State capital is
Springfield, which is about twice the size of
Bathurst. Philadelphia has over 1,600,000
people, and Harrisburg, eighth in the local
category of towns, and possessing about
60,000 inhabitants, is the political centre.
Out of the 46 States in Uncle Sam’s country
34 have carefully dodged selecting the big-
gest city as the political centre. It is really
rare for the place selected to be even second
in rank. Canada’s capital is the fourth city
in point of numbers, and in four of the
Canadian provinces the Provincial Govern-
ment doesn’t hang out in the most congested
spot. The South African Union made a
curious compromise between the British and
Boer elements by having two capitals, and
they rank third and fourth, according to the
number of their white inhabitants. India’s
political centre has lately been shifted in-
land, from the biggest and most commercial
city, to the seventh, counting by the census
returns. Italy hangs out its political shingle
in its third biggest town; Holland in its
third ; and there are other examples. Also,
there is a very widespread tendency among
countries of hard experience, as shown in
the cases of Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Vienna,
The Hague, Pekin, Delhi, Brussels. San-
tiago, Mexico City, and many more, not to
dump the whole Government apparatus and
military headquarters and Treasury on the
coast, where it may be surprised and very
much astonished and dispersed by a sea at-
tack. Australia might consider these points.
A general removal of the political machines
to far-inland State capitals would make
more room for the working population. A
whole lot of people, for instance, might be
accommodated on the site of Sydney Lands
Office. The sale or leasing of the sites or of
the whole structures would probably pay for
the erection of new buildings on cheaper
land. The work would supply a vast amount
of employment for returned soldiers. It
would break the monotony of life. In their
new quarters, Parliament and the Public
Service would, for the first time, get a view
of the One Big City from the outside instead
of the inside, and they would learn for the
first time that there were other places. And
when the Bolshevik insurrection commenced,
which it would naturally do in the big, wor-
ried, heated, industrial and commercial
centre, it would have a long way to go
before it “took over” the Parliament,
Governor, Government offices, Treasury, cash
reserves, archives, barracks and police head-
quarters. It might even faint by the way.
Bounties.
The Australian tariff contains (or con-
tained when the Year Book was published)
132 items under the heading of “Metals and
Machinery”—some of them very complex
items embodying as many as 20 sub-items.
And in 66 cases imports, provided they come
from the British Isles, are marked “Free.”
In all other cases British goods come in at
a special low tariff-rate. In one line all im-
ports are free. There are 115 ad valorem
duties on the list, and in 66 cases even the
foreigner only pays 5 or 10 per cent. Con-
sidering Australia’s fairly high wages and
short working hours, the high cost of build-
ing and of machinery, also the small scale
of operations in the early days of an indus-
try and the comparative inexperience of the
early workers, these rates are not one r fifth
what they ought to be. They were never
intended to promote industry, but rather to
prevent it, so that there might be lots of im-
ports to collect small duties on, and lots
of profit for importers, and much “com-
merce” to brag about. Now*, in a half-
hearted fashion and as a method of changing
the subject, and by way of a Freetrader’s
feeble apology for the faith he really doesn’t
believe in (save by habit, just as he believes
in Genesis) it is proposed to help along the
iron and steel business with a bonus. No
one has much faith in bonuses granted for
a short term by a grudging Ministry. In
the present case, as usual, there are many
restrictions —in fact there are more restric-
tions than bonus. The subsidy is not to be
paid when the profits of the business are
over 15 per cent. It is not to be paid when
the freight on similar imported goods is
£4 10s. per ton or more. When the freight
is below £4 10s. it seems that the manu-
facturer may get Is. per ton for every Is.
reduction in freight, but not more than 40s.
per ton in all, even if the freight drops 50s.
or 60s. So in the years when the mnnufac-
turer makes a loss, owing, perhaps, to a
great increase in wages, he will get no bonus
if freight is £4 10s. per ton. And in the
year when he makes 15 per cent, profit he
will apparently get no bonus, even if freights
are temporarily down nearly to nothing,
and the importers are laying in big stocks
to smite him with when the carrying charges
rise. Nobody ever dreams of putting up the
tariff when the importer is making over 15
per cent, or when freights go down sud-
denly. Being an importer he is privileged
to be as rich as he likes. The bonus will,
of course, involve much filling in of returns
and much costly official supervision and in-
spection. And every time there is a diffi-
culty in finding money for the passage to
England and hotel expenses of some wordy
person travelling with limelight and “suite”
the usual member of the importing persua-
sion will draw attention to the way the iron-
founding “pauper” is “battening” on the
community. A great deal of attention of
that sort has been drawn at various times,
yet very little has been done for manufac-
turing industries. These were the figures
as nearly as they can be arrived at from 190 S
to June, 1917: —
Bonuses on babies, rich and poor alike .. £3,103,390
Bonuses on raw products .. . . . . 2,587,909
Bonuses on manufactured goods .. .. 308,612
£5,999,911
The baby bonus is for 5£ years only, so. it
is a mighty item. Yet it hasn’t visibly in-
creased the birth-rate. The sugar bonus,
included in “raw materials” (£2,573,037)
is, of course, a dubious item. The idea was
to charge an excise on white-man-grown
sugar and a much heavier one on black
Sugar. What is called the sugar bonus isn’t
what the grower receives, but what he would
have had to pay if he had employed black
labor. In other words, having £1 of his
own about him he is bushranged of 10s. and
gets the other 10s. as a gratuity. On the
whole the amount done for manufacturing
industry, spread over nine years and divided
among six industries isn’t much. All the
biggest one got in any one year wouldn’t
keep the Bureau of going
for 12 months, or Australia House for
six. The whole business is rotten and pom-
pous and bogus, but it keeps some people em-
ployed poking a laborious nose into things
they don’t understand. Mrs. P arpiggle,
invented by Dickens, would be an ideal
head for the Bonus Department.
The War of the Sexes.
“H.H.”: When the Woman’s Legal
Status Bill gets through N. S. Wales
Parliament there will be one State in
the Commonwealth in which woman is
authorised to be practically everything except
a son or an uncle, and even that isn’t form-
ally prohibited. If she can find out how to
be an uncle she may do it without authorisa-
tion. Yet, after all, the question of the
equality of the sexes remains. Reform gets
so far and doesn’t get any farther. Woman’s
career at the Bar or on the Bench or any-
where else must be jerky and interrupted
through periodical retirements to bring little
Bill or Sarah into the world. There are
plenty of occupations in which success de-
pends on not being interrupted, yet if little
Bill or Sarah are not brought into the
world a time must come when nobody has
any success and everything leaves off per-
manently. Assuming that a healthy male’s
working age is 40 years, it is necessary to
train, say, five or at least four generations
of female workers for one of males; for if
woman doesn’t leave the office or the factory
after an average of eight or ten years’ servi-
tude aud be fully occupied in making little
Bill and Sarah desirable inhabitants, it is
a poor lookout for the country. If. as a
general thing, she stays on to the age when
the worker is most valuable, between 30 and
50. there will be a decaying race and a
frightful demand for cats and spectacles.
There being, in a general way, about five
times as many beginners among women fac-
tory and shop and office workers as among
men the average wage is necessarily lower.
There are two possible ways of making the
sexes equal. One is to fix a minimum wage
for mothers so that the one essential job
which a woman can do better than a man
shall be paid accordingly. (This idea must
not be run to excess; for instance, a mini-
mum wage for niggers granted on the ground
that only a nigger knows how to be a nigger
would be absurd.) The other idea is for
man to be a mother occasionally. This has
never been tried, so far as I know, and I
don’t think it would succeed. There has
been more than one good king—though kings
are generally a bad lot —who went down to
history as the father of his country, but
never one wdio was hailed as the mother of
his country. Yet curiously enough, while no
man has been a queen, there is at least one
case on record of a woman being a king. It
was a rough and ready expedient for dodging
the Salic law in a time of hurry. At the
same time, it shows the versatility of the
sex. and its capacity for rising to an emer-
gency.
The Soldiers’ Next Battle.
“Solomon M.” pessimises:—
A crazed Government having announced by the
mouth of its Minister for Repatriation, that there
is no apparent need for new industries to supply
employment for returned soldiers, the way is now
open for the gigantic swindle of “putting them on
the land.” It is a broad road and all downhill.
The number of speculators, frauds, agricultural
and pastoral failures, land agents and stock and
station agents who have land to sell or can find
land for a commission is remarkable. It will be
more remarkable unless some of them are put in
gaol, and the gaol accommodation is limited—worse
luck! There is talk in a wild sort of way of
settling 100,000 men at a cost of £2OOO each
(or £200,000,000), which seems absurdly low. The
little that has been done is already costing more
than that in some places, and the boom in values
caused by the unprecedented demand, hasn’t started
yet. If one-third of the available soldiers are put
on the land and the other two-thirds are left to
scramble for work in the new industries which
Minister Millen regards as needless, if not obnox-
ious, it seems, roughly speaking, that the paper
wealth dashed into circulation for boom purposes
may about equal the gold output of the last 20
years, which included the Westralian boom-years.
Or it. may equal something like 10 years’ output
of all the minerals of the Commonwealth on the
present scale. In these circumstances the Bill for
the raising of Compulsory War Loans is being pro-
ceeded with, though, the unpaid balances of old
loans should be far more than enough to finish- up
any fragments that remain of our share of the war.
The loan money will, of course, reach the Treasury
in the shape of paper. It will be used to buy
land, to effect improvements, to furnish implements
and seed, also sustenance allowances till the crop
eventuates. The Government will possess an im-
mense asset in the shape of the lOU’s or other
long-dated acknowledgments given by the soldiers
in return for the la nd, etc. So where there was
formerly only the la rid there will then be (1) the
land; (2) the papier wealth raised at, say, five
per cent, to buy the land from previous holders;
(3) the paper wealt'h received from the new buyers
which will consist of mortgages, based partly on
artificial values with no margin of security and
partly on perishable goods with no margin of secu-
rity either. It ougrht to be a land-boom equal to
all previous land-booms put together. The great
advantage of it will be that it can’t really and
truly and wholly 'burst until the sustenance allow-
ance given to the settlers pending their first crop
holds out, and it ought to last a while, unless the
Treasurer dies of heart-failure at the handle of the
printing machines.
Some sanguine individuals have suggested that
only 25,000 soldiers will want to go on the land
at £2OOO each, and that with a housing scheme for
100,000 the whole business may be done for
£200,000,000. But the Ministry, in its desire to
have lots of soldiers in its land-boom, apparently
proposes to keep down industries which might
supply work without Government and without fur-
nishing employment and self-importance to a buzz-
ing army of inspectors, advisers, boards and heavy
fathers generally. This kind of competition is
viewed with disfavor. So the War-profits Tax is
being extended bo smite anybody who is found start-
ing a new industry. He is to have, so far as
the printed summary of the measure goes, only 10
per cent, on capital, if he makes that amount,
or more, and tc* stand all the loss if there is one.
And apparently, though the temporary Protection
given him by t the ship-famine in war-time may
shortly disappear, there is no idea of giving him
any further tariff Protection. He is to be on the
old semi-Freetraile wicket, with the handicap of in-
creased wages, and of a new tax to subsidise the
land-settlement scheme. On that basis there should
be plenty of land settlers.
At the rate of progress some misanthropies
have reckoned that it may take 14 years to get all
the applicants put into the agricultural industry, and
that something may have to be done for them out
of loans in the interval. Anyhow, settling soldiers
on the land has already become a great industry,
employing a great many officials, and the longer it
lasts the more salary they will draw. Professional
philanthropy isn’t a circumstance to it. Disabled
soldiers must be separately provided for, and the
return of the able-bodied ones will leave the popu-
lation still a good deal smaller than it would have
been in the natural course of things if there had
been no war and no repatriation. And there is
practically no material damage to repair. So the
need for quite all this upheaval isn’t apparent.
It suggests muddle or dishonesty or both. Any-
how, the soldiers who make a failure on the land
will doubtless be provided with a new start some-
how. As for those who make a success and buy
up the allotment of the failure next door, they
will be denounced as base monopolists and a healthy
row will ensue. And when the whole thing sim-
mers down, if it ever does, the herd of professional
repatriates will expect to be pensioned in their
old age. Meanwhile the soldiers who don’t go on
the land, and can’t be provided for in the new and
specially-taxed and ill-protected industries that are
said to be unnecessary, will not be expected to go
Bolsheviking.

“G. Arden Hill The turning-down by the
coal-miners of N. S. Wales of Beeby’s invi-
tation to come in under the new State
Arbitration Act was not unexpected. The
Minister for Labor and Industry had previ-
ously twitted the officials of the Miners’
Federation with being afraid to take a ballot
because the bulk of the men were with him.
but not only was a ballot ordered, but some
of the officials advocated the acceptance of
the Minister’s proposals. But the advice
was a half-hearted effort, and it would have
sounded much better had they told the men
to pitch out Beeby’s proposals. Meanwhile
the Minister’s jaunt may be somewhat sad-
dened by the reflection that after all his
efforts and double-column advts. in the press
he could not gain the confidence of the coal-
hewers. As a matter of fact, the miners are
just about tired. During the past decade
they have been so plagued with a mul-
tiplicity and complexity of boards, concilia-
tion committees, industrial courts, special
tribunals and so forth that most of them do
not know where they are legally or what
particular award governs their working con-
ditions. It is rather perplexing for a man
whose eyes are blinded by sweat during
working hours to be confronted at every turn
by legal obstacles. Possibly the confusion of
boards, etc., had something to do with the
rejection of Beeby’s invitation, but there
was also an element of distrust of Beeby.
The Hun’s occasional post as a simple
child of nature and an untutored son of
the soil is amazing. As an instance: Herr
Eezberger, a man with spectacles in high
authority,-asks that that scrap of paper, the
armistice, shall be altered, because: —
(1) Foch distrusted the Hun delegates’ sincerity
and acted accordingly, instead of giving these honest
and faithful creatures his entire confidence. The
look of dog-like fidelity was wanting.
(2) He did not seem to realise “that we were
forced to sign the conditions, because Germany must
have peace.” (He thought they were merely doing
it for amusement).
(3) The retreating troops are worried lest some
of them shouldn’t get out in time, though any
able-bodied man could have reached the Rhine in
a quarter of the period allowed. They are afraid
of being interned for lateness, which would hurt
their feelings. Also they have to leave some things
behind in their haste.
(4) The surrender of one-sixth part of Germany’s
railway rolling-stock to partially replace the stock
destroyed in Belgium and France will “make the
situation difficult.”
(5) All these things may have a bad effect on
the “young German democracy.”
What the effect on the young German
democracy will be when the bill for damages
is really presented the man with spectacles
doesn’t say. But the Hun has already got
his tail up sufficiently to pose" as a. cruelly-
treated child.

German Wilhelm and Other Untidy
Sundries.
According to Lloyd George some of the
greatest British jurists have advised that
the Kaiser “has been guilty of an indictable
offence, for which he ought to be held re-
sponsible.’’ And according to numerous
other commentators on the performances of
the Great Assassin, William can be extra-
dited from Holland and placed on trial for
murder. Between being “held responsible”
and put behind the spikes there is a substan-
tial legal difference —and while the business
incidental to holding his nibs responsible
might present no great difficulty the job of
placing him in the dock would appear to
have some of rather formidable magnitude,
in England anyway. Still, the trial of the
Kaiser by a common jury would be a strik-
ing incident, legally and otherwise, and this
paper entertains a great hopefulness that
the event may be put on the cause list.
If it happened that the last European auto-
crat had been removed to the place from
whence he came and there susnended by the
neck, the Democracy of the future would
possess a sort of historical scaffold-mark
having extraordinary significance and giv-
ing solemn warning against the instability
of forged partnership papers wth Provi-
dence. Meanwhile other intelligence about
the Kaiser is as meagre as ever. Allegedly
he last week dulv executed a document an-
nouncing his abdication —which may be any-
thing or nothing. It certainly does not
mean that if by hook or by crook William
can get back to the atmosphere of Prussia
he will willingly go anywhere else. Kings
are not built that way, nor ever have been.
Still, the fact that he has taken himself as
far away from Potsdam as it is possible to
get without meeting a Fritz Hop is an
impressive indication of the relations be-
tween him and the rest of the community.
In the meantime war appears to be raging
at full blast in Siberia. Also there are
yarns about German officers being in com-
mand of Bolshevik armies in Russia and
about additional troops being sent to 1 ladi-
vostock to put the local Bolsheviks in order.
But the whole situation of which these inci-
dents are mere details is buried in gloom.
Why it should have been part of the terms
of the armistice that German troops were
to remain in occupation of the conquered
Russian territory has never been explained.

Another Cogged Machine.
The Nationalist machine, which blundered
heavily into Sydney municipal elections,
backed out of the fray when the numbers
went up on Monday night badly in need of
repair. “Nash” had got it in the neck again,
Labor (13) emerging from the wards with a
majority of two over the alleged civic Re-
formers (11). a couple of Independents
who had looked on Nash with a cold eye
before, and can be fairly relied upon to now
have an even more critical outlook in that
direction, making up the total of 26 alder-
meu. Coming in the wake of the proceed-
ings at Monaro, this mishap to the
National brigade magnifies the writing
on the wall. A conspicuous feature of
the poll was the collision between Lord
Mayor Joyful Smith and the calamity
which seems to be inseparable from going to
the ballot in rabbit-skins. At the last three
Sydney elections the L.M. has been biffed.
Only at one previous election did he escape
annihilation. A possibility arising out of the
state of the barometer is the return of R. D.
Meagher, who polled the highest number of
votes on the day, to the furs—a happening
that would reflect a vast dignity on local
citizenship. Labor got two seats unopposed;
the other side four. Ror the 20 seats on the
Council determined by vote there were 47
candidates. As proportional voting is in the
air of N. S. Wales just now, the results of
the vote from that aspect have a special in-
terest. There were 32,476 votes cast appa-
rently by 16,238 burgesses. On a propor-
tional basis for 20 seats the system of a
single transferable vote exercised by 16,238
electors would necessitate a quota of 812
votes to secure election. In this case some
candidates were elected on more votes than
this—some on fewer. Some were beaten
though they got a proportional vote; some
were not, though they failed. For instance,
Joyful Smith, with 867 votes, omitted to
get in. William McEliione, John Doyle
and Pat Stokes, though polling below the
quota, were returned. Apparently every
group of 670 electors (each voting for two
candidates) elected an alderman for Labor.
An alderman waS returned to every 863
electors who voted for the Nash, and one
for every 1312 who voted the Independent
ticket. Proportionalism would have given
the independent elector three aldermen
instead of two—and probably four. Likewise
it would have led to fewer Laborites super-
vening. To the so-called Reformers the
difference would have been nothing unless the
votes not exercised in the wards where no
conflict took place would have had some
effect on the general situation as between
the respective candidates elsewhere. Assum-
ing the ratio of party votes to hAve remained
the same, a proportional Council on Mon-
day’s poll would approximately consist of
11 Laborites, 11 Nashites and four Inde-
pendents. Taking everything into considera-
tion, and taking the most indulgent view of
what would be likely to happen under such
conditions as that, The Bulletin cannot
see anything to make it suspect proportional-
ism delivering any materially different goods
to what was handed out the other day. The
main fact sticking up out of it all is that
the average Sydney citizen with a vote cares
less about what happens up at the Town Hall
than he does about the lay-out of a stranger's
whiskers.
——_—-♦
Something; that Requires Clearing Up.
Apparently the Defence Department con-
siders it a fair thing that Australian citizens
having relatives in captivity in Germany
should have the choice of believing whatever
they like about the treatment these men are
getting. The Bulletin does not, and sug-
gests to Watt that ordinary humanity de-
mands of him a statement of the facts. For
several days recently harrowing stories were
published about the appalling condition in
which Australian prisoners were reaching the
allied lines and the frontier of Holland. It
was specifically and frequently stated that
these men were starving—were spectres—
were in the last stages of physical exhaustion.
Then it was announced, simultaneously with
an instalment to the preceding effect, on the
authority of the Prisoners of War Depart-
ment in London, that the men were not starv-
ing, were not spectres, but were in good nick
though ragged and dirty. There is a deal of
difference in these two yarns, and it is not
very decent that an Australian mother or
father should be left in a state of bewilder-
ment about them. Obviously someone is
doing some good hard lying, and if Pearce is
content to go on knowing nothing as usual,
Watt ought to arise and indicate where the
perjury is and where the truth.
A Great Work in the Ma State.
The present N. S. Wales Ministry would
really be the best one in Australia if it could
only acquire a sense of the value of money,
and the simple measure of financial acumen
which is required to run a successful build-
ing society, and if it would buy a good arith-
metic book, and pass an examination in
accountancy, and read up the bankruptcy
law. Its Local Government Bill is a
highly creditable measure, though it is
hard to find time to pass it amid
the rush of spending; and the new
Venereal Diseases Bill would make the
reputation of a Ministry which wasn’t so
heavily in debt. The Bill is an effort to deal
seriously with the worst curse of the human
race —one which has been covered up and
disguised and protected by orthodoxy and
Grundyism and talk about the “recognition o
vice” till it has become so rampant that it it
is a choice between it and orthodoxy it is
orthodoxy that should go overboard, tut in
the fewest words, this is the Holman
Government’s scheme: —
None but qualified doctors are to treat venereal
disease. The advertising fraud, the patent- medicine
man and the casual chemist are barred.
Any patient who doesn’t submit himself to treat-
ment' will be penalised. He must remain under
treatment till cured. Free treatment is, of course,
available when desired.
The doctor must notify every case though without
giving names. Particulars will only be furnished if
the uncured patient does the vanishing trick. Then
it is necessary, with a view to following him up.
Any person communicating the disease to another
person, or marrying while suffering from the disease,
will be heavily punishable.. (A Melbourne doctor
declared recently that he could fill a sanatorium with
ladies in good circumstances who had been infected
by their husbands, which is a whole essay on the
necessity for this proviso.)
All prosecutions will be done by special officials
not by the ordinary police, who are hardly a diplo-
matic race, and can’t be expected to be wildly diplo-
matic considering the wages they get and in the
present humble state of the Police Superannuation
Fund.
The same week that these interesting parti-
culars were published it was mentioned that,
largely through the increase of railway and
tramway rates, the revenue of the State for
the past five months is £1,507,190 more than
for the corresponding period last year. It is
thus increasing at the rate of £3,883,270 for
the year; yet with all this extra money
coming in the Government seems have no
more idea that the same old loan call be dis-
pensed with than if the public income was
falling out of sight. If the borrowing mama
could only be made a notifiable mental
disease !!!
Stood his last watch. It. F. Douton, the

the deceased mariner had taken his last
command, the coaster Canberra, under Ad-
miralty requisition. From the master of the

superintendent for a while, but on the
launching of the Canberra he was commis-
sioned to bring her to Australia, and had
retained command since.

“Edo” : The Westralian O.L.P. union boss
is at last being pushed well into obscurity.
Less than a year ago he absolutely had to be
invited to public functions at which he took
precedence over all others, but now his name
is not on the guest-list excepting in rare
instances. Even at Kalgoorlie. once Labor’s
great fort, Major Leslie has for some time
ignored the union officials. There was talk
of an awful vengeance, but the other day,
when Leslie stood for another year’s ser-
vice, no one was game to oppose him.
“Larry” Wells, latterly head of the Fed-
eral Taxation Office in Adelaide, gets back to
work which should be more congenial as
chairman of the new Land Board of South
Australia. He started in the Surveyor-
General’s Department of that State, and did
his best work, perhaps, in the eighteen-
nineties as a member of the Elder, and
leader of the Calvert, exploring expeditions,
in the regions where S.A. and Westralia
meet.
From the Secretary of the Department of
Defence:
In your issue of 31st October appeared a corres-
pondent questioning the quality of artificial limbs
issued to members of the Australian Imperial Force,
and I am now directed to state that the practice in
the matter is as follows:-^-
(1) As soon as a man can wear it he is supplied
with a temporary (peg) leg. Arrangements are
being made for the supply of temporary arms.
(2) When the permanent artificial limb has been
made and the stump is ready, the permanent limb
is supplied.
(3) The type of limb depends on
(a) The occupation of the invalid.
(b) The position of the amputation.
For clerical work a more expensive type of arm is
supplied than for manual work, though each type is
the best for the work required. Many men imagine
that the more expensive arm is the better arm, but
this is not the ease.
(4) The invalid’s pension is not affected by the
issue of a limb. For loss of a limb a man receives
full pension for six months and thereafter 3s. 4d.
pension unless he has to go again into hospital, when
he gets full pension during his stay.
(5) The question of influence does not apply. The
most suitable limb is supplied in every ease.

[For The Bulletin.]
(As written bye a deep-sea bard with the chantey-

Eight bells gone and a show hull down
(Yo, ho, ho, and some, birds for sale!)
“Oh, Oh, Delphine!” is coming to town.
(Fare ye well, “liatinka"!)
Oh, I love them all as they come and go,

The news that the roaring mariner is trying
to convey (with appropriate deep-sea hic-
cups) is that the “Katinka.” season at Syd-

Oil, Delphine !” makes a start on Saturday.
After a fortnight at the Cri. (Sydney)
“Madame X” will, in spite of overwhelming
evidence of guilt, lie acquitted of the charge
of murder for the last time to-morrow night.
The only reason for the jury returning a
verdict of not guilty against the lady is that
otherwise the dramatist would have been in
serious trouble. And the only reason for
Madame’s decease soon afterwards is, of
course, that she had to be got rid of some-
how or other, anyway. Yet it is this anti-
climax that saves the play from falling into
a heap. On Saturday night Muriel Starr
will put aside the habiliments of woe and the
countenance of dejection, and appear as

The J. and N. Tait Piepertory Co. had
another full and appreciative house at the
Palace (Svdney) last week, when John
Galsworthv’s “The Pigeon” was produced,
with Shaw’s “How He Died to Her Husband”
as a curtain-raiser. “Her husband was play-
ed by George Bryant with a fine vigor which
got all the humor possible out of the ridi-
culous situation created; and Olive Wilton
as “She” came right out of her shell and
thoroughlv earned the applause she received.
Raymond' Lawrence, the poet of the romantic
attachment, scarcely looked the part, and
occasionally spoke his words with the rattle
of a juvenile lead in melodrama, but did
not fail so conspicuously as to spoil the
part.
* * * *
In “The Pigeon” everything ran with
buoyancy and sparkle. The chief honors
went to Gregan McMahon, who gave a
curiously interesting and pathetic reading of
the part of Louis Ferrand; and Eardley
Turner, who, as Timson, the ex-cabman
with a taste for rum, was a perpetual joy.
Cecil Brooking, as Canon Bertley, was
admirably in character, and probably got
more out of his parson’s job than the author
could have expected. Alfred Bristowe, as
Professor Cal way, made the utmost of a
comparatively small character study; and
A. E. Greenaway, as the gentle “pigeon”
who could not save himself from his own
generous impulses and the consequent pluck-
ing, gave a quiet and even presentation
which was altogether satisfactory. John
Do Lacey, as Sir Thomas Iloxton, was far
too noisy to be heard with distinctness, but
his uproar did not occur at points where it
could greatly mar the movement of the
John Ford as Petrov

“ Katinka .”
play. Of the
wom e n, Monica
Scully, as Ann
Wellwyn, acted
with a simple
naturalism which
was as perfectly
sustained as it was
convincing; while
Esther Mitchell
gave a very charm-
ing account of her-
self as Guinevere
Megan. It is true
she did not quite
rise to the highest
possibilities of the
difficult part. Wild-
ness, according to
the text of the
play, should be the
chief quality of
the flower-seller;
but Esther Mit-
chell made her a
rather t a m e,
path e t i c little
thing. Still, her
restraint gave a
certain fineness to
her work which
greater vivacity
might have spoiled. “'tTaken fts a whole, however
-.—and that is the only way in which repertory
work can be taken—the production was a
triumph. There was genuine pathos there
and more honest laughter than in any of
the most popular musical comedies seen in
the neighborhood for a string of years.
The Conservatorium (Sydney) resounded
with the tramp of marching feet on Saturday
evening. Gone was the great hush that
ushers in a Beethoven revival. Pink-cheeked
schoolgirls chattered volubly as their youth-
ful mates stamped round the platform, while
Ella Gormley, 8.A., the Education Depart-
ment’s instructress in physical culture, softly
breathed the lessons for the day: “ ’Ten-
tion !” “Bend arms !” “Stand at ease !”
This big display of Swedish exercises, deport-
ment such as TurVeydrop would have
envied, balance, life-saving drill, song and
skipping, was carried out with the greatest
spirit. The poise and discipline of the young-
sters, their fine physique and the easy,
prompt response of even the smallest hair-
bow to Miss Gormley’s confidential murmurs
brought volleys of applause from a packed
building. The Educat’on authorities were,
for obvious reasons, unable to give an aquatic
exhibition, yet there are many budding
Annette Kellermans amongst these lithe-
limbed Sydney kiddies who swim and (live
like seals as part of their school curriculum.
Australia means to keep true to type. These
athletic, gentle-mannered schoolgirls are
going to be the mothers of a race as virile as
those who stormed the classic heights of
Gallipoli.
At Hoyt’s and the Haymarket (Sydney)
Pierrot drops over the garden wall and
brushes a kiss across the cheek of Prunella;
hut Pierrot, as all women know, is a change-
able fellow, and so on a night lie slips away
as unexpectedly as he had come. But the heart
of Prunella Marguerite Clark is filled with
restlessness and longing, so she decides to
trace her lost property, and how she jour-
neys in a circle, as all travellers do, and
comes back to the old garden to find a peni-
tent and this time permanent Pierrot is
charmingly told in “Prunella.” At the
Crystal Palace Norma Talmadge presents
her excellent make-up on the screen in the
picture presentation of Ethel M. Dell’s
novel “The Safety Curtain.” Norma is a
beaten and bruised little vaudeville dancer,
married to a perfect berrute —the strong
man of the company. When the theatre
catches fire, in the first act, the girl is
saved from the fiery furnace by a pukka
officer from India. Of course, there are
complications, which would have been
avoided if the heroine had remembered that
no wise girl signs her marriage-lines with
the second man before she holds the death
certificate or the decree nisi concerning the
first. However, it is to this want of fore-
thought that we owe the story, so it is
overlooked on this occasion. At the Strand
Kitty Gordon is demonstrating the worth-
lessness of the tinsel of social allurements
as compared with the gold of true love. She
does it very well with the aid of a fine
wardrobe, an inytinue daughter and a
divorced husband. Mabel Normand as
“Joan of Plattsburg” is the star of the
Lyceum programme.
The big Griffith film, “Hearts of the
World,” is in its third week at the Itoyal
(Sydney). It may be prescribed for any-
one who feels sorry for the poor Hun.
** * *
Perhaps the most striking thing about “The
Better ’Ole,” now at the Royal (Adelaide),
is the optimism which pervades it. One
watches it now with a cheery feeling of,
“We said we would win. and we did” ; but
when Bairnsfather’s stuff was devised and
filmed, the whole attitude was,“We will win,”
though nobody knew whether we could. The
picture is doing immense business. In com-
petition with it are Francis Bushman, in a
mystery-play at the Pav.; Petrova, at West’s,
in a powerful “Life of mask” drama; and at
Wondergraph the cheerful Fairbanks, and
Mary I'ickford as one of the most lovable
heroines of recent fiction—Locke’s Stella
Maris. At the Tivoli, the Anderson Co. has
a fine drama of “The Confession” and the
duty of a priest to maintain silence even at
the expense of his own brother’s life.
A i the Majestic there is a bright mixed
bill, with Davey, the soldier juggler, and
Brightie and Carlyon, of whom the lady (in
particular) is a real humorist, though some
of her humor is a bit on the reckless side.
* * * *
“Hello, Everybody,” is still the reason why
indiscriminating people are heading for Her
Majesty’s (Melb.). That disjointed enter*
tainment continues to afford Minnie Love
much practice in putting rainbows to sleep
with" her gaudy raiment, what time Jack
Cannot appears as several other persons
without suppressing the Cannot who domi-
nates each one. Also the girls are as numer-
ous and piquant as ever, and in most in-
stances fulfil every managerial requirement.
It is only in the wheat-stack scene that there
are not enough damsels to decorate the huge
revolving bouquet in the centre of the stage.
But sooner than have any vacancies on the
pyramid, a resourceful management lias
drooped in two or three young men, who are
carefully camouflaged in flaxen tresses and
try to look as soft and winning as their
masculine visages will allow.
•fi * v ❖
“Everybody’s Doing It” vanished from the
Tivoli (Melb.) on Saturday. The current
show is “Iloni Soit,” apparently weakened
by the absence of the elastic Lupino. At any
rate, Lupino’s name is not mentioned among
the celebrities who were to be revived in the
revue last Monday.
When he put on “The Wearin’ of the
Green,” at the King's (Melb.) on Saturday,
Allen Doone exposed the resources of a green
wardrobe in honor of the event. Green was
rarely, if ever, absent from his apparel. In
one scene he wore a suit the virulent color
of fresh grass, and a short-sighted cow might
be pardoned for mistaking him for a three-
course meal. Even when he warbled Ire-
land’s anthem to J. Bull’s perfidious deputy
in the Dublin Hall of Harmony, his favorite
color flared in a dozen fancy gradations
from his shoes to his shirt. Edna Iveeley
gets more of the hero’s society than custom-
ary in “The Wearin’ of the Green,” but
then she is poor but beautiful, and Allen’s
predilection for enchanting poverty is every-
where notorious. In this caste be clings to
Edna with an adhesive constancy unshaken
by the temptations of his grandpa, who wants
to marry him off to the rich daughter of a
friend. It is a great example of faith and
tenacity, but as a theatrical spectacle it is
becoming monotonous. Next Saturday Allen
will finish his season with a revival of
“Sweet County Kerry.”
The reappearance of Gertrude Alger was
the chief musical event at the Melbourne
Auditorium on Saturday. Gertrude opened
her programme with Paganini’s “Witches’
Dance,” the technical dexterities of which
were almost belittled by her confident bow-
ing. Beethoven’s “Kreutzer Sonata,” with
pianist de Bourguignon, could deny little to
the young artist who was searching for its
wonders, though the tone occasionally was a
little thin and might have been enriched by
a warmer impulse. Bach’s aria on the G
string was the item of the final bracket, and
she produced it practically undamaged along
with a couple of Hubay’s compositions, in-
cluding the lovely “Scherzo Diabolique.”
Songstress Peggy Center sang the Waltz
Song from Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliet”
with a charm that only needed the interven-
tion of some emotion to be withcraft. Peggy
is an aloof young person whose voice and
heart are such strangers in song that it looks
like a case of constructive desertion. Pian-
ist de Bourguignon, who accompanied with
discretion, gave his piano transcription of
Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries,” which,
compared to the original music by a com-
petent orchestra, somewhat suggested a ride
in a ’bus.
The “Hearts of the World” war film at
the Royal (Melb.) is at least a credit to the
industry of D. W. Griffith in amassing the
details of blood and battle which thicken
the anguish of the story. Necessarily
the producer has been compelled to syn-
chronise events in the conflict with the
actions of his characters, but the illusion of
reality is not strained by the fact that the
French and English are made to arrive at
the moment when the hero and his donah are
on the point of being slain by the Huns. A
good deal of film is devoted to elaborating
the mutual heartache of the two young-
angels, and there is an unnecessary flourish
of superfluous information, as, for example,
the scene where Asquith, Grey and Lloyd
George solemnly wait while the clock ticks
off the last five minutes of the time allowed
for German compliance with the British
ultimatum. It is characteristic of the Yan-
kee producer to bring the audience into inti-
mate touch with the incident by giving a
close-up view of the clock, ..but everywhere
the “close-up” trick is practised with a
humorless insistence on its value to the tale.
In one instance the camera registers the
huge visage of a Hun ravisher frothing with
the fury of a baulked desire, but that feature
is not comparable in artistic reserve to the
tableau of the long line of Teuton warriors
lying low on their stomachs as they fiercely
chant the Hymn of Hate. The incidental
warfare, however, is interesting, but much
of the trench fighting is pantomime biff pro-
vided by a mob of bloodthirsty supers. Still
J.C.W. tries to overcome the effect of those
artificialities by burning gunpowder pro-
fusely and imitating some of the uproar of
battle. Further, the stealthy music by Gus-
tave Slapoffski’s orchestra accompanies each
episode so appositely that it might almost
be said to be married to the film.
“THE WEAR IN’ OF THE GREEN” AT
MELBOURNE KING’S.
Gill McDougall (Onslow Edgeworth) and
Squire Fitzgerald (Frank Cullenune).
The film version of Granville Barker’s and
Laurence Housman’s “Prunella,” at Hoyt’s
(Melb.), owes a lot of its artless phantasy to
the personality of Marguerite Clark. Margue-
rite formerly, played Prunella on the stage,
and iii the photo-drama she has the air of
knowing the character intimately. To turn
from the unconcealed poetry of “Prunella”
to the crude realism of “The Family Skel-
eton” is rather a jolt, but Australians will
enjoy the latter thriller because our own
Sylvia Bremer is faintly disguised as the
heroine. “Peg o’ the Pirates,” with Peggy
Hyland in charge, is the frankest melo-
drama, but the neat pantomime of Peggy
weakens a lot of the opposition to the trend
of the tale. At the Melba “The Red, Red
Heart,” was on the screen on Monday, and
exhibited a Redskin’s love for a white girl
with all the enthusiasm of one who was a
friend of both parties. To-day the Melba will
become the safe-deposit of “A Gentleman’s
Agreement,” from which Nell Shipman and
Alfred Whitman draw the biggest salaries.
At the Britannia Petrova’s dark, effulgent
beauty glittered behind “The Life Mask for
three days this week. To-day the barrier is
down for William Desmond, who starts for
the Popularity Stakes in a tumultuous scrim-
mage called “Wild Life.”
** * *
Two Melbourne sideshows: —
None of the painters in Australia can approach
the ornate respectability of Clewin Harcourt, who
is now exhibiting a number of his efforts at the
Athenaeum. Only in one or two of his small land-
scapes does he depart from the staid and heaiv
decorum which gives a ponderous dignity to his
lightest performance. It is true that he presents a
couple of nudes, but their poses are entirely conven-
tional, and there is something almost ugly and cere-
monious in his rendering of their curves. i lie many
portraits on the walls are undeniably well drawn,
but the various men, women, flappers and children
are rosy, plump and complacent, and are probably
the descendants of several generations of bishops.
The rather mduay-looking blonde (No. 2) might be
worth taking out to dinner, but one feels that her
conversation would almost inevitably be confined to
the Anglican Synod and Annie Swan. Some of the
others have a High Church aspect, but the lady
called “Carmen” looks more promising, and might
venture an opinion on bridge and Botticelli. Copies
of a Gainsborough and a Romney fill in a couple of
vacancies that would look desolate without them,
but the masterpiece of the show is a decoration
entitled “L’EtC,” which has had the honor of appear-
ing in the British Academy and the Paris Salon. It
is excellently painted; composition and color are
equally correct; yet the small girl solemnly holding
the apple in the rear registers with her Madonna-
like mamma an impression of devout futility which
it is impossible to escape.
Penleigh Boyd has inspected the Australian gum
without discovering anything very fresh about the
overworked giant. Nevertheless, some of his studies
of big timber at the Fine Art Society have th£
quality of personal recollections endeared to the
artist by some surprising opulence of color or some
enchanting accident of atmosphere or design. “The
Swamp Gum” (No. 26) suggests just the sort of
effect that an artist sees rarely, and t(*ics to capture
ere it disappears. In three or four other places—
particularly in the uncatalogued “Golden Sunlight”
—there is the same ambitious performance, though
the pictures vary in their distance from a complete
revelation. • Pen Boyd, however, is to be commended
for tempering the monotony of big gum pictures
with some views of wattle, mountain and plain.
But the wattle is only treated in the mass to force
some dull or sombre scene on critical attention. The
bloom is cleverly employed in “The Wattle Gather-
ers,” and in “Silver Wattles” it gives a note of
clamor to a canvas that would be otherwise in-
capable of the faintest exclamation. The mountain
effects are mostly sketches of distant eminences, but
there is one large and unusual contribution, “White
Noon,” which is remarkable for the artist’s deference
to the importance of the white road which hurries
in a band of pallor, undiminished by the perspective,
over the hill in the middle of the picture. This
wan road would appeal to Maeterlinck, but all the
same it is distinctly well painted. The war picture
“The Sapliead,” which the artist also hangs, is an
unwarranted intrusion in a .landscape exhibition.
With all proper respect for its subject, it is artistic-
ally a dud.
Clarke, Minister for Lands, breaks it
gently that there is not much land available
for repatriation in Victoria. He does not
speak merely as a departmental map-reader,
but claims to have inspected all the land.
He deals with the two most magnificent
patches. One is in Gippsland, and needs a
railway, costing half a million, over or
through the mountains. The other patch
would, take the poor soldier five years to
clear 'off the splendid timber. Thus, there
would be destroyed hundreds of thousands
of pounds stored up for the future. Clarke,
therefore, says he can only fall back on
closer settlement. And there, he says, he
finds the paring has been to the quick, and
no very large estates are left.
Died at Sydney a few days ago, aged 89,
William John Dark, eldest son of William
Dark, who lived in the neighborhood of
“Jack the Miller” in Governor Darling’s
time. Jack the Miller had a windmill at
Miller’s Point. The harbor bight under
Windmill-street was, in Dark’s boyhood, a
busy spot for shipwrights and shipriggers,
the whale fishery being a live industry at the
time. There were a few pubs (or perhaps
more) thereabouts, and what happened in
those days on the Rocks, the haunts of the
sailors, no man knoweth.
“The Deacon”: Tanned his last hides in
the late sixties, Andrew Thompson, king
of the little town of St. Marys—
known to all the Western (N.S.W.)
teamsters as South Creek. He began
life from scratch. With no education
to help, he lived to build up a big tanning-
business, which industry lie pioneered on the
“Crick.” Standing 6ft. 4in.. of commanding
appearance, generous to all, and with the
winning simplicity of a child, lie was the
central figure in the little township. Aider-
man and mayor many times, he stood for
Parliament once in the Labor interest, and
was beaten.

*Exclusive of appropriations to Reserve for War
Taxation and Contingencies.
Out of the profits of the past three years sub-
stantial amounts have been transferred to a
reserve for war taxation and contingencies.
If these appropriations be included with the
profits, the figures have been as follows: 1916,
*50,161; 1917, £68,910; 1918, £73,599. But
in comparing those profits, the growth of
capital must not be overlooked ; 1916,
£400,000; 1917, £501,355; 1918, £552,032.
So far the reserve for war taxation and
contingencies has not been called upon, all
taxes having been met out of current profits.
The reserve now amounts to £58,979 —
a very handy stocking to dip into, if neces-
sary, to meet future heavy taxation calls, to
help the co. should dull times come along, or
to protect stock if prices slump. Quite
possibly a lot of that £58,979 may not be
called for; but the management acted
wisely in taking advantage of the prosperous
times to put something up its sleeve.
There have been some big changes in this
old-established business during recent years.
It was established 78 years ago, and the
present co. took it over about 22 years ago.
Capital then was £150,000. held mostly by
the old partners and their friends, and with
headquarters in London. Later on the pub-
lic w’as invited into the business, and as the
Australian interests grew the head-office was
transferred to Sydney. A lot of new capital
has been got in during the past couple of
years—mainly for the purpose of purchasing
property to give the co., a complete end of
one of the most valuable blocks in Sydney—
fronting Pitt, Market and George streets.
Paid capital, £552,032. is now made up in
this way : 200.000 6 p.c. £1 Ist prefs. fully
paid ; 202.710 7 p.c. £1 2nd prefs. paid to
15s. (£152,032) ; and 200,000 £1 ords. fully
paid. The uncalled ss. on the 2nd prefs.
is now being got in to meet the final pay-
ment, due a few days ago, on the property
purchase.
How has the war affected Farmer’s?
Compare two four-year periods—the cash
assets in each case being shown less current
dividends :

That shows steady progress; but the sur-
plus accumulated during the past four years
may be cut into by war-time profits taxation.
Anyhow, the co. has been got into a very
solid position. None of the capital is repre-
sented by hypothetical assets; and though
the goodwill of the business is very valu-
able, the £30,000 with which that item was
represented in the balance-sheet four years
ago has been written right out. Stocks are
very heavy now ; and though in many busi-
nesses danger lurks in big accumulations
purchased at war prices, in this case there
is reason to believe that valuations have
been made on a very conservative basis.

The Co-operative Assurance started in 1911
with the object of introducing house-purchase
insurance in addition to doing ordinary and
industrial business. House-purchase insur-
ance has proved very popular in England ;
and the idea is a good one. By taking out
a w hole life, limited life or endowment policy
the insured, after a certain proportion of
the premiums has been paid, can secure an
advance, not exceeding the face-value of the
policy, to purchase a home. Take the case
of a man of 25 effecting, say, a 20 years’
endowment assurance policy for £5OO, with
profits. The annual premium would be
£23 11s. Bd., and at the end of five years
he would be eligible to borrow the full face-
value of his policy. The life risk begins
from the date of the issue of the policy, and
in case of death any property acquired under
the policy would go to his estate, plus any
surplus which the account show's after the
proceeds of the policy had been credited and
the mortgage discharged. However, the war
has seriously interfered with the co.’s opera-
tions in this department. Building materials
have been at almost prohibitive prices, and
conditions generally have been unsettled. To
September, 1914, 02 advances, representing
£28,947, had been made, but since then only
a further 10 advances totalling £5750 have
been made. Altogether £34,097 has been
advanced on 72 policies to date, but 41 have
been wholly repaid, policy-holders having
realised on their properties in a favorable •
market and wiped off their debt to the co.
and shown a profit. The result is that at
September 30 last the co. had only £10.154
out in mortgages—less than half the amount
at the end of its first year. A limited num-
ber of new house-purchase policies with de-
ferred loan conditions, however, have been
issued during the past couple of years.
In the Ordinary department the Co-opera-
tive Assurance has shown good progress for
the past year, the net increase of business
in force being £59,000. The total claims in
this department, were only £560 on a pre-
mium income of £8959, and all but £5
represented war losses. Progress in the
Industrial branch was more difficult, but
the co. made some headway there also.
But though in both departments the total
income for the year increased by £1555 ex-
penses were £1594 more. That is the
weak feature of the year’s operations. Ex-
penses ran away with no less than 72.2 p.c.
of the total income, compared with 69.3 p.c.
for the previous year. On the other hand,
the 1918 losses were less than in 1917—7.2
p.c. of income compared with 9.4 p.c.
Accumulated funds now amount to
£22,244. The other side of the balance-sheet
shows that £40,126 has been spent on "Foun-
dation, organisation and extension of busi-
ness.” Hence the deficit of £17,882 shown in
the first table. However, the actuarial inves-
tigations of a year ago showed that all policy
liabilities were adequately provided for. At
September 30 the co. held £26,534 in cash
and War Loan, £10,154 was out in mort-
gages under the house-purchase insurance
scheme, and £2746 represented odds and ends.

This is another rubber disappointment. The
co. began when the rubber market was boom-
ing ; but it has had other troubles besides
the slump in prices. For a start, there was
litigation concerning possession of portion of
the Port Swettenham estate, and the co. lost.
A couple of years ago a cyclone devastated
the plantation, acres of trees being torn out
by the roots and the rest badly mauled.
This put the co. in a bad way, and the hopes
of getting profits from what was left were
slight. The management saw that the only
way out was to acquire auother plantation,
and later the Australasia, 70 miles away,
was secured for £15,500, and also 1000 acres
of adjoining jungle country for £457. Last
year 500 acres of this jungle area were dis-
posed of for £1364. Of the total of 790. acres
in this Australasia estate, 290 acres contain
trees five to seven years old, 200 acres are
being got ready for planting, and 300 acres
are nothing but jungle. Meantime the posi-
tion at the Port Swettenham estate is im-
proving—14,600 trees were in tapping at the
end of June, compared with 10,820 left after
the cyclone three years ago. For the 12
months the yield was 43,0781 b., compared
with 30,6341 b. for the previous year. The
harvest at the Australasia was 72,8001 b.,
compared with 36,4581 b. for 1917. The total
rubber got for the past vear was therefore
115,5751 b., of which 82,9991 b. were sold at
2s. 21d. per lb. Stocks on hand were valued
at Is. 34d. The final result, after paying
interest, etc., was a profit of a few pounds
under £l5OO, not quite 3 p.c. on the capital
of £57,500. Expenses are still heavy, chiefly
owing to the high wages demanded by the
Chinese tappers, but for the current year,
with an estimated yield of 145,0001 b., the
management hopes to reduce costs. If the
rubber market improves, as anticipated,
there should be good profits ahead, provided
the estates remain free from trouble. On a
crop of 145,0001 b. the co. would have to show
a pet profit of about Sd. per lb. to pay a 10
p.c. div. Shareholders have not had a taste
for five years, but considering all the trouble
the co. has encountered the balance-sheet
bears a better appearance than might have
been expected. Capital is £57,500, and lia-
bilities amount to £13,164. Estates stand
in the books at £60,608, and £11,341. has
been spent on development-areas not in bear-
ing. Liquid assets at June 30 were £4061.
So the excess of liabilities over liquid assets
was £9103, compared with £10,243 two
years ago.

Though during the past half-year Block 10
received £91,951 for its products compared
with £82,377 for the previous term, the
net profit is £7661 less. Costs, owing
to Scarcity of efficient labor and increased
prices of materials, advanced considerably.
Extraction costs leaped from 21s. B.Bd. per
ton milled to 255. 1.9 d., and treatment costs
from Bs. 6.9 d. to 12s. 4.7 d. per ton. Further,
the half-year’s profits had to carry £4740
more in taxation and royalty than the pre-
vious term. The ore mined for the six months
was 28,319 tons, and total mine expenditure,
apart from depreciation, worked out at 435.
sd. per ton, compared with 345. lOd. per ton
for the 27,612 tons crudes produced during
the half to March 31. The co.’s costs can
never be low, but the increase recently has
been very solid.
The Block 10 co. has now been at work
just over 30 years, and the mine is being
gradually worked out. During its first five
years the co. exhausted the rich kaolin ores,
which brought in well over £900,000. Then
it put up plant to treat the low-grade ores,
and to date not quite 2] million tons have
been treated. Capital is £965,000 —100,000
shares each paid to £9 13s. Dividends to
Sept. 30 had amounted to just £l4 per share.
At that date there was a surplus of liquid
assets over liabilities of £76,953, equal to
another 15s. sd. per share. In addition
there is £37,525 in shares in other cos. Ore re-
serves were last estimated in 1914 at 228,900
tons, and about 30.000 tons has been about
the average half-yearly output since. Some
development work is still being done, but
there’s little left but odds and ends.
A few years ago the co. decided to go in
search of a new property, and then-manager
O. B. Ward had a look at Papua and secured
the Misima for the co. But it cost him his
life —and an appreciative Board puts on
record its acknowledgment of his ser-
vices. The Misima is at present treating
about 1250 tons a month, but another ss. per
share has been called up to provide plant to
handle 5000 tons a month.

This co. is now in its ninth year, and. as the
table shows, it has seen a lot of trouble. To
begin with, it was established on
dations —of the paid-up capital of £35.000
no less than £17,965 was paid for the good-
will of two then-popular Sydney restau-
rants. The first balance-sheet issued showed
that there were tangible assets of £13,285,
which had to provide dividends on £35,000
of capital. Further, the co.’s two big cafes
were in premises held on short leases. Cater-
ing is a difficult business, and the table tells
how this co. fared. When the lease of
Baumann’s cafe expired it was not renewed,
and last year, when the A.B.C. lease ran
out, the management swept out the last
crumbs of its former extensive caf6 busi-
ness —and with the crumbs went the £9384
of goodwill still standing in the books. But
the co. was not altogether down and out.
Two years ago there were changes in man-
agement, and Clifton Clarke, manager and
sec. of the Sydney Tivoli Theatre, was in-
vited in to help clean up. The A.B.C. Co.
had some time previously acquired the busi-
ness of Miss Bishop, who had become widely
known as a manufacturer of good cakes.
Clifton Clarke, with the showman’s instinct,
saw the possibilities of extending the co.’s
interests in the tea-and-cake business under
Misj Bishop’s name. Now there are 44
shops in the city and suburbs, which for the
past half-year were giving a net profit equal
to over 18 p.c. p.a. on the written-down capi-
tal. Of course, the co. had to sweep away
the old wreckage, and 6s. per £1 share thus
disappeared. Coodwill has entirely dis-
appeared from the balance-sheet, which is
now ouite clean. At September 30 the co.
owed £15,012 —£1000 in debentures, £4OOO
on mortgage, and the rest due to sundry
creditors. On the other side £17,000 was
tied up in freehold property, and £10,7(58
was in plant and fittings. More or less
liquid assets amounted to £14,723. A couple
of years ago the co.’s £1 shares were quoted
as low as half a crown; now 15s. 3d. is
being asked for the 14s. shares. Both this
co. and Sargent’s have demonstrated that
there are good profits to be made out of the
quick-lunch, afternoon-tea and cake business.
But everything depends on a continuance of
good management.

Hydro-Electric Department of Tas-
mania. —This Department’s report for the
year to June 30 shows a considerable im-
provement over the transactions of the pre-
vious year, notwithstanding the many diffi-
culties'and losses as a result of the war. The
capital account of the entire undertaking
now totals £643,281, construction having cost
£498,641, and the lighting branch (pur-
chased from the Hobart Gas Co.) £144,039,
involving an interest charge of £14,944 for
the power branch, and £7OOO for the lighting
branch, or a total of £21.944 for the whole
scheme. The lighting account showed a
profit over working costs of £10,479. In-
terest and other costs amounted to £7714 ;
thus this branch showed a profit over all
charges of £2765, against a profit for the
previous year of £l3Bl. This result would
have been increased but for the fact that a
steam plant had to be used as a consequence
of the delay in securing some necessary
machinery. The bulk-power account showed
a profit over working costs of £7573. In-
terest charges amounted to £14,944, which
leaves a loss of £7370, against a loss last
year of £11,698. Thus the whole undertak-
ing showed a loss for the year of £4600. com-
pared with a loss of £10,300 for 1917. During
the past term revenue increased by 45 p.c.,
while expenses advanced only 15 p.c.
Owing to the delay in securing plant the
Electrolytic Zinc Co. was unable to obtain
its full block of power for the whole year,
and the revenue from this source was only
£5600 instead of £14,000, whilst the Hydro
Electric Co., at North-West Bay, owing' to
war difficulties, only used power to the value
of £390, whilst their full requirements will
mean a total revenue of £lO.OOO. The latter
co. has now surmounted all its difficulties,
and should be in a position to require its
complete block of power during the coming
year. So next year the Department should
show a considerable profit over all charges.
Under the adverse circumstances it has
pulled through satisfactorily. There is little
doubt that the development of the magnifi-
cent power resources of Tas. will result in
immense benefits to the State.

The Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assur-
ance Co. has capped a brilliant war record
by deciding to refund to its soldier-policy-
holders the whole of the war-risk premiums
they have paid since hostilities began. Cer-
tainly the co. did not rush in and load itself
heavily with new war risks. The manage-
ment was naturally not anxious to take un-
known risks; on the other hand, it very pro-
perly did not wish to make a profit out of
the men in the trenches. Altogether the
M.L.C..had policies aggregating 21 millions
subject to war risks; and war claims actu-
ally paid have amounted to £450.000. Most
of these policies, of course, had been in force
for a varying number of years and carried no
extra war premiums; but the actual war
losses have been very heavy. This co. took

When Alurninoferric is used in connection with
reservoirs its application is extremely simple. The
cakes or slabs (which measure 22in. x Tin. x 6in. and
weigh about 561 b. each) are placed on edge in a per-
forated wooden box, or other suitable cage, at the
inflow to the reservoir, and as the slabs dissolve
readily the rate of Alurninoferric applied is in-
creased or diminished in proportion to the rise or
fall of the water passing, and may be readily regu-
lated to a nicety. One pound will clarify up to
3000 gallons of most turbid waters. Particulars .from

For grinding all classes of material in Gall Mills
and Tube Mills it is necessary to have a suitable
grinding medium. The mines in West Australia,
also numerous cement plants, are using balls of forged
tyre steel, and find- that they give excellent results.
These balls may be obtained in various sizes from
the Austral Otis Engineering Co. of Melbourne, who
have put in a special plant for forging them, and
can give delivery of most sizes from stock. This
company also manufactures forged steel shoes and

“Good Australian’’: Something more than
an idle rumor is filtering through Melbourne
financial circles relating to inquiries from
New York as to the prospects of establish-
ing a U.S.A. bank in the Commonwealth.
Because they have not hitherto fostered
foreign trade, thanks to an all-absorbing
domestic consumption of their manufactured
goods, the Americans have not troubled about
opening their own banks abroad. The Germans
have always known the value of German
banks as an aid to German trade in foreign
countries, and Argentina and Brazil afford
excellent proofs of how helpful and necessary
the banker is to his comrade the merchant.
In London, the big German banks, the
Dresdncr, the Deutsch and the I) i scon to',
nearly monopolised the foreign discount busi-
ness before tin 1 war, and should their history
ever be written it will give startling evidence
of the supineness, amounting to stupidity,
of the financial and Governmental authorities
in allowing the Germans to get such hold
of the exchange and banking business of
Great Britain. The BrUikli banks have never
valued the presence of their brftnch.es in the
Continental capitals, and. hate lost much
business and influence in consequence. It
is questionable whether the Americans or
any other foreign people should be allowed
to establish banks here in opposition to our
Commonwealth and joint-stock banks. Our
own banks are quite capable of doing our
own financial business. There is no need for
foreign banks (<> come in and share our
banking profits. From the Protectionist
point of view our bankers, who are really
only trustees for thousands of Australian
shareholders, are entitled to Protection
against foreigners just as much as our manu-
facturers.

The Hill End field (N.S.W.) just at pre-
sent is busy on developmental work. The
tunnel from the old Amalgamated mine has
missed 200 ft. under the Patriarch shaft, on
the Central’s leases, and has been taken a
further 200 ft. north, which brings the face
to within about 20ft. of the boundary of
the Deep Levels ()o. The tunnel will be
taken a considerable distance in the same
northerly direction, the Mines Department
having subsidised 1000 ft. sit the rate of £1
a foot, which is equal to about half the cost
of the work. The drive will thus run through
the whole of the existing shows and will
unwater the field to a depth of about 800 ft.
The only work paying its way on the field
at present is the drive north in the bottom
level of the Deep Levels, where the stone
averages about 14dwt. —lOdwt. to 12dwt.
covering exes. The Amalgamated, which has a
tribute over a limited make of stuff in the
old mine at the southern end of the field, is
getting highly payable stuff, but there isn’t
enough of the stone to justify a shout. A
lot of dead work is being done through-
out the field, generally in conformity with
Geologist Harper’s recently established new
•theory concerning the deposition of the gold.
It will be a long time before the argument
is backed up or exploded by actual test.
Gold-mining activity at Dark Corner, on
the old Sunny Corner field, in the Bathurst
district (N.S.W.), has taken another spurt
with the discovery by the Sure Gift syndi-
cate of a reef traceable for about 700yds.
and up to 2ft. wide. The 30 tons of stone
taken out of the two shafts on the line have
given an average of loz. 16dwt. The show
is eight miles from Sunny Corner and three
from the old Paddy Lackey, which produced
fair values in days gone by. The reef is
supposed by some to be a continuation of
this make. The developments so far do not
allow of a definite statement of general pros-
pects, and, further, the treachery of the old
Sunny Corner reefs must not be overlooked.
Pay stone has an aggravating knack of
cutting out very suddenly.

From Westonia (W.A.) : Edna May is
gradually exhausting its ore reserves, but
the mine seems likely to disburse in dividends
a sum equal to the combined future distribu-
tions of the other three cos. And Edna May
will not require to pay a very big sum to do
that. Deeps is endeavoring to hurry down
two winzes from the 666 ft. level in order to
open up at 766 ft. as quickly as possible, so
as to make available a moderate quantity of
high-grade ore above the deeper level. The
mine will then be able to make an improved
showing—temporarily; but any substantial
distribution of dividends will be as far off
as at any time during the past nine months.
Consolidated has shown the best it is cap-
able of. and that has not been very much.
Bad ground is a drawback in connection
with this co.’s mining operations, and
dividends are difficult enough to attain with-
out difficulties of this sort. Central is trying
hard to preserve its life, and has proved
remarkably successful in this way. The mine
has the lowest average grade ore on the field,
and in circumstances where many mines
would have succumbed the Central lias kept
not only alive, but is actually aiming at
dividends. With Central, however, it seems
that whatever profit is made will be required
for developmental purposes for some time
to come.
Edna May Battler (W.A.) has at last
come to its senses and abandoned operations
on its Westonia property. As The Bulletin
stated many times, the show was never good
enough for a cb. The same remark applies
to the one at Southern Cross which the
Board is now nibbling at. The public will
be well advised to keep off unless the show
is backed bv •> favorable report from an
independent mining-engineer of repute.
Associated Northern’s old mine at Ival-
goorlie seems to be full of surprises. Years
and years ago, in the late Capt. Kodda's time,
the end was thought to be in sight. Yet
hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of
gold was extracted after that. Later on, tin*
property was declared to be on its death-bed,
and the treatment plant was taken away.
Later still, a select tribute party got on to a
make of ore near the Ivalgurli boundary, out
of which its members have made fortunes.
Now comes tin* announcement that four other
tributors have stumbled across something
else, out of which they cleared last month
about £7OO per man.
* * * *
An effort is being made to resurrect the
Empress (W.A.). 'After the original
owners, Crosse and party, had taken out
over £40,000 from near the surface a Mel-
bourne co. of the hand-to-mouth variety
came along and tried its luck. Shares
boomed at first, but as all the capital called
up and all the gold taken out of the mine
was frittered away on plant and mostly hap-
hazard development, the market soon broke,
and share values fell from 30s. to pence.
Finally, after a fruitless search had been
made at 400 ft.. the co. gave up. The
show is still considered by some people to
have prospects under capable management;
hence the efforts to give it a further trial.
* * * *
Mt. Monger (W.A.) is in trouble again.
First it was the inability to get in capital,
then it was the want of water and lack of
crushing facilities, and now it is the pulling
up of an adjacent wood-line over wdiich ore
has hitherto been railed to Boulder for
treatment. The reefs have been proved
down to 200 ft., and although they are not
big enough for cos. to work, values are
sometimes high, and the ground is easily
wmrked. The trans-Australian line passes
within a few miles of the field, and the
Federal railway authorities have been asked
to erect a siding and provide for the trans-
port of ore to Ivalgoorlie in order to enable
local owners to carry on.
* * * *
The Melbourne-financed Golden Gate co.
has got an extension of its option on the
Turn of the Tide, at Kunanalling (W.A.).
The co. reckons that prospects are favorable
enough, but considers that the development
already done is not sufficient to justify it
closing the deal. The show is in a locality
where mines are short-lived, and the co. is
well advised to see that the purchase price
and fair interest on same is in sight before
doing anything.
Like the rest of Daylesford (Vic.), Nug-
getty Ajax is living mainly on short shoots
and long calls. Bill Gulloek still runs the
show, and the best he can say of the vital
No. 10 level is that he gets strong makes of
stone and fair streams of water. This sort
of puff-pastry doesn’t hide the poverty of
the rest of the mine. A few ounces have
been panned out of No. 7 level, and Gulloek
has hopes of picking up the shoot 100 ft.
underfoot. This is about all the Christmas
cheer lie shows, unless the drive north of
the Ajax lode should help him out. The
near-by Ajax expects to hit the lode in the
No. 5 crosscut in the next fortnight, but the
outsider has got so shy of Ballarat-Dayles-
ford share boosts that he doesn’t c-are much if
it does. Yet a big stir will take place if Ajax
Central at 1500 ft. gets a tidy shoot of stone
below' the barren belt of country from 800 ft.
down. The reef carries gold, but so far it is
patchy and below the pay mark. This is
the deepest bit of prospecting done on the
Ajax line.
Another old-timer shuffling into the light
is the Rose, Thistle and Shamrock, of Har-
rietville (Vic.). C. F. Procter, opening out
on the Landtax reef, has crushed a little lot
of 772 tons for 3940 z. and 22 tons pyrites.
His shaft is on a 7ft. reef, and as it carries
pay-gold he anticipates with confidence that
the veteran show will look up again. A lot
ot risky work has had to be done to get
workings safe and connected up. That job
is pretty well out of hand, and with shaft-
sinking out of the way the battery will
talk. If results are decent Procter will be
the first to get a return out of Oven's reefing
for a decade.
Up Mitta Mitta way (Vic.), 11. C. E.
Brooks is giving the Angus-Nitchske Adel-
aide crowd a run on some of the tin-bear-
ing granite country of the mountain slopes.
Brooks chants a swan song of how a new
crusher is to smash the formations up on a
scale and more cheaply than any stamper
battery ever devised. Seeing that he has been
trying out a working model, Brooks may be
striking the right note. But lie will have
to do big things to get ahead of the records
put up by .1. B. Lewis at his Blue Teir
Anchor mine. Brooks has the side of a
range to practise on. so if he wins out the
Mitta has big possibilities.
* * * *
You can’t knock a million pounds out of
a gold-mine and expect to keep yields up
for ever; so Oswalds. Maldon (Vic.), is
down to a profit of £745 on its last six
months’ tussle with old-age conditions.
Some stone went lOdwt., but prospecting
had to be kept going without result at 220,
7(H) and 1000 feet to try and scrape up a
decent bag of crushing material. One find
was made west from the 800 ft. level. There
Langsford got into a formation 12ft. away
from the drive, file stone running up to |sft.
in width. 8o far he has gone ,40ft. north and
south on the shoot, but as he doesn’t en-
thuse it looks as if a lot more gold has to be
got in the stone to class it as pay dirt. Since
Oswalds got to the co. stage cash re-
serves have been built up; so the Board has
lifted a wad out of that fund to pay a couple
of shilling divs. There is still a fair amount
at credit; so. with the aid of the SOOftj.
shoot things may yet look up, though to-day
it is all hard work on poor-grade quartz.
* * * *
The Hydro-Electric Co., near Hobart,
after a long struggle to obtain plant during
the war, made a start in/May to produce a
good grade of carbide, but owing to the
delay in securing regular shipments of elec-
trodes from America it was forced to close
down after a short run. The co. efiergeti-
cally set to work to erect its own electrode
plant, so as to be independent of outside
supplies. This is now complete, and con-
tinual production of carbide should now
result. In addition the co. will be in a
position to supply electrodes to outsiders.
These are two entirely new industries, and
this persevering co. deserves the best of luck
for its enterprise. A start has also been
made with its metallurgical plant, and as
soon as peace enables the management to
secure the necessary machinery activities
will commence with the treatment of zinc
ores by the Gillies process from the two
valuable properties on the West Coast
which are controlled by the co.
“Blue Stone”; A few months ago there
was a spirited rise in the value of N. S.
Wales 1915-16 wheat scrip—a jump from
fd. to lfd. per bushel, with forward pur-
chasers at higher rates. This was on the
strength of certain whisperings that there
would be quite another 3d. per bushel avail-
able for dividend later. On November 27 the
Victorian Wheat Commission published a pro
forma balance-sheet based on its local trans-
actions and figures supplied to it by the
Australian Wheat Board. Those competent
to judge conclude that the Victorian 1915-16
pool will not pay more than Id. per bushel to
holders of 1915-16 wheat scrip. The Audi-
tor-General’s report attached to the balance-
sheet demonstrates this when stating that
4s. 9.8 d. per bushel f .o.b. is the average reali-
sation of local sales and transactions through
the Australian Wheat Board, as against a
similar average of 4s. 9.92 d. of all the con-
tributing States combined. Recently it has
been whispered that the prospective dividend
on the 1916-17 scrip would be more than the
market indicated. These forecasts assumed,
however, future sales at 4s. 9d., and made no
provision for loss in weight, which if only 10
p.c. would mean sd. per bushel in addition
to a loss of about a similar sum of earlier
reconditioning of wheat damaged by mice and
weevil. In the face of the fact that about
half the 1916-17 crop had been sold at an
average of 4s. 4d. per bushel f.0.b., it is
difficult to see how any further dividend can
eventuate, particularly when it is remem-
bered that millers for 1916-17 wheat are
charged only 4s. per bushel, as against
4s. 9d. for the 1917-18 grain, which is well
cared for and in good condition. By reason
of its low f.a.q. standard (56Jib. to the Im-
perial bushel) the intrinsic value of the
1916-17 wheat was originally per bushel
below either that of the 1915-16 or 1917-18
f.a.a. standards of N. S. Wales, and now the
1016-17 wheat, after treatment, will not
average 56flb. to the Imperial bushel.

RENEW YOUR STRENGTH BY
TAKING PHOSPHATE.
RESTORATIVE OF VIGOR AND
VITALITY.
The condition of the man or woman who
has lost his or her strength is pitiable, for.
above all, it is strength that makes life worth
living and renders possible the full enjoy-
ment of all that life offers. Illness, worry
or anxiety may have sapped your vitality
and robbed you of your strength, or old age
may be responsible for tissue-wastage and
consequent loss of power, but whatever the
cause it is possible for you to renew your
strength, to regain the vigorous health which
is your birthright, and to defy the advance
of old age by simply furnishing your system
with bitro-phospliate. This product is
natural to the human body; it is present in
abundance in vigorous youth, but in later
life, or in consequence of illness or excesses,
the quantity is reduced, and its reduction is
marked, by. such symptoms a s weakness,
depression, insomnia, debility, languor, irri-
tability. inability to withstand mental or
physical strain, etc., and, noting one or more
of these symptoms, you should at once com-
mence taking this restorative bitro-phosphate
treatment. No difficulty should be experi-
enced in obtaining the treatment, for bitro-
nhosphate is now stocked by practically all
high-class chemists in the form of small com-
pressed tablets. The desired results are
obtained in practically every case, and you
do not have to wait long for proof that bitro-
phosphate is doing you good.— Advt.

"C.D.”: The recent death in Tasmania of
the Rev. Samuel Waterhouse breaks the last
direct link with the old tragic days of
Fijian history. Waterhouse went to Fiji as
a Wesleyan missionary at the time when the
native had a sharp fancy for human flesh. So
terrible were some of Waterhouse’s adven-
tures that he returned a broken man and lived
in retirement in the Speck, quite unfit to take
any active work about his church. He was
moving to the 90th milestone when the last
call came. G. W. Waterhouse. 8.A., LL.M.,
perhaps the soundest lawyer in Tassy, is a
son.
The station-gates of this planet closed be-
hind one of the real old-timers when Edwin
Pitt died, suddenly, of heart failure, at
Artarmon, near Sydney. He was 75
at the departure. Educated at King’s
School, Parramatta, he was in charge of a
big station when a boy of 16. One-time
owner of Coorali, in the Moree district, he
later acquired Bronte, Richmond, which pro-
perty is still in the Pitt family, as it; has
been since March, ISO 2. He was a son of
late Geo. Matcliem Pitt, founder of Pitt.
Son, and Badgery, Ltd. The other surviving
brothers are R.M. Pitt (managing director
of P., S., and B.), Colin, Harry, and C. B.
Pitt.
From The Bulletin’s Secret Service:—
Peter Simonofl, the Bolshevik “Consul” in Aus-
tralia, used to be a miner, but he now describes
himself as a journalist. “Journalist” is, like
“actress,” a misused word. The lady of some educa-
tion, a trace of beauty, certain traces of clothes,
A GENUINE OLD MASTER.
THE ARTIST: “ Thinking of getting married,
eh? Well, I'll hare to look up some
little original for yon."
THE MODEL: "Oh, but I have u big one. He's
an Ansae.”
even when she is in evening l dress, and a lingering
hint of morality usually calls herself an actress.
In like manner the miscellaneous regeneration of
society professes to be attached to the press,
though the , feeling may not he mutual. Simonolf’s
line of eloquence is simple and obvious. He
tears passion lo tatters about the dreadful doings
of Czars and Grand Dukes, admittedly a rotten
crowd; and about the horrors of the dungeons beside
the Neva, and the mines of Siberia, and about the
snow and ice that hem in that last possibility
in frozen horror, the penal settlement at Icebergoslav,
near Glacieroffski, where even the howl of the wolf
is frozen so that it breaks off short. Then he lashes
himself into a culmination of fury and urges
loose-mouthed, slack-lipped, large-eared people to
rise against the oppressor, until they are more
than half inclined to rush out and invade the
Savings Bank, with all their savings in it, under the
impression that it is an hereditary monarch, or to
flood the A.M.P. mutual assurance office and release
the captives who languish on the premises for a
salary from 10 to 3. Nine-tenths of the animosity
directed against the Commonwealth Bank, all the
profits of which belong to the Australian people, is
due to the verbal froth of aliens with criminal
countenances, who shout till they are half-dead (and
should be the other half) about the alleged misdeeds
of the Russian secret police force. In fact there
is a really strong anti-Grand Duke movement in
this country, the idea being to save the people from
the depths of misery by suspending their right of
self-government and placing them under a self-
constituted Soviet of regenerators, who will open
all the prisons and print a ton of paper money. No
doubt a good many Australian voters may he killed,
injured or robbed in the scuffle, and worse things
may happen to the lady voters, but sacrifices can’t
he avoided. The Grand Dukes that Simonoff raves
about call for suppression, even if the Civil Service
Co-operative store is wrecked and the cash-register
looted in a burst of honest indignation. And any-
thing that is left will be gathered up and carried
away by the hurst of dishonest indignation which
scavenges behind the main body.
The very useful service rendered in the
operations against the Turks by the Camelry
Corps has received little recognition
from war-writers in the Egyptian and Pales-
tine spheres. Without the patient but
smellful camel it is hard to say how General
Allenby’s army would have fared. “Trooper
Bluegum” (Major Oliver Hogue, formerly of
S.M. Herald staff, and a frequent contri-
butor to The Bulletin) has written a book
dealing entirely with the work of the
Camelry forces in and around the old
Biblical region. “The Cameliers.” the title
of the work, is to be published by Andrew
Melrose (London). Hogue was captain in
command of a Camel Company in nearly all
the operations in Palestine. As an original
Anzac he is expected hack in Sydney at
Christmas.
An original Anzac due to step ashore pre-
sently is Lieut. “Jock" Davidson, D.S.O. He
left Sydney with the Ist Light Horse, and
took part in every engagement with the ex-
ception of the Landing. He saw service
with his unit at Itomani and Katia, in
Egypt, and joined the Imperial Camel Corps.
During the first two attacks on Gaza his
reckless bravery was the talk of his unit;
ai\d with the exception of General Royston,
and Lieut.-Col. W. B. do Lancey Forth pro-
bably no other soldier in Palestine enjoyed a
more charmed life. Before the war he
ploughed and harrowed in the New England
(N.S.W.) district.
“F.R.”: Just before Abdul skied the towel,
George Langley, Melbourne footballer and
school-teacher, was promoted to Lieut.-
Colonel. Langley left Australia as a lieu-
tenant with the 21st Battalion, and when
the transport Southland was torpedoed, near
Lemnos Island, he was blown from the deck
to the engine-room below, and had a miracu-
lous escape from death. Later he served at
Anzac, and after the evacuation transferred
to the Camel Corps at Tel-el-Kebir. 11 is
unit was stationed for a time at Mogarah.
an isolate| post in the Libyan Desert, and
here the men endured more hardships than
any other bunch then in Egypt. The party
under Langley's command had to patrol a
vast stretch of wilderness, arid although they
met few of the Senussi troops they had a
continual battle against thirst and sand-
storms. Langley’s company of Cameliers
was the first in the Corps to engage the
enemy, and, striking a warm corner during
the lighting at Romani, would probably have
been all killed or taken prisoners had it not
been for the timely arrival of the Light
Horse. Colonel Langley’s promotion was
more rapid than that of any other officer in
the Camel Corps, and he wears a couple of
decorations.
William Smith, vaguely alleged to be
really John Roberts, but to have concealed
the fact; for reasons of his own, has passed
out in the Old Colonists’ Home, Melbourne,

aggravated type,' his years being 100. Also,
h' had been a prohibitionist for 75 years
and a non-smoker all his life. Which isn’t
so rare as it looks. All the patriarchs were
non-smokers—while they lived, anyhow.
Cain, however, is reported to have smoked
after death.
Daniel Slattery, who died the other day
at Briefly, Warruambool (Vic.), was a
Western District native with a reputation
as an active sport. Most of his life was
spent in raising assorted stock, and he was
a horse-handler of repute. He rode his own
prads in many local events, and often navi-
gated a winner. Apart from these diver-
sions, he took an intimate interest in
agricultural education and had a consider-
able fund of bush lore, having passed nearly
a decade, of his early manhood in outback
Queensland. His widow is a sister of the
late John Murray.
The influenza epidemic in London has
accounted for J. L. Dunstan, a brilliant
young Western Australian. In 1912 he was
a scholar at the Scotch College, Claremont,
and the general opinion was that he should
have been selected as the Rhodes Scholar
in that year. A fund was accordingly
started to send him to Oxford, and £9OO was
raised for the purpose. Dunstan went to
England and had a brilliant career at the
University, where he took up the medical
course. On war being declared he joined
the Flying Corps, and served in France and
Flanders. Seriously wounded he was com-
pelled to leave the service and returned to
medical work at the St. Bartholomew’s Hos-
pital, where the ’flu’ caused his death. He
is the son of John Dunstan. mining-engineer
and former inspector of public batteries.
Donald Melville, “father” of the Vic-
torian Leg. Council, was 90 last week. The
old man has been an extremely regular atten-
dant at the House for 36 years, and is still
going strong in pursuit of Labor’s trailing
coat-tail. He can generally find a few words
to say in opposition to State Socialism and
the abolition of the Parliamentary refresh-
ment-rooms, or to offer some judicious
obstruction to the car of Progress whenever
that vehicle begins to roll onward at any-
thing more than a safe walking pace. Mel-
ville, who made his private competence in the
grain business, shares with Laborite Daniel
McNamara the representation of Melbourne

George Franklin, who died at Hobart the
other day, was a survivor from the long-
extinct school of Tasmanian rowers, who
used to drive whaleboats over nine-mile
courses. In his youth, when lie was a black-

“Centurion’s” obituary :
The late Captain J. 15. Maylan, referred to b.v
“Bowyang” in a recent lir i.i.kti v. was Q.M.S. of
O Squadron, Ist A.L.11. before getting his cone
mission. When his squadron was in Western Egypt
he fell foul of the Arab contractor who supplied
the forage, because of the unduly large percentage
of sand and Other make-weights therein. Protesta-
tions from the robber were of no avail and an offer
of baksheesh led to personal violence. The con-
tractor was much perturbed. One evening, when
Maylan was playing cards with some mates in his
tent he saw the Arab hovering outside. His right
hand clasped what looked like a knife-handle in the
breast of his kaftan. A swift grab—Maylan was a
big man -and the skulker was yanked into the
tent. lie hastily drew something from his bosom
and dashed it on the table. “I—l lofe you,” lie
yelled and fled into the darkness. It was a full
bottle of beer. Just after he got his commission
Maylan fell foul of a Tommy officer in the National
Hotel at Cairo, and the latter put him under arrest
for being under the influence of liquor. All the
evidence offered for the defence at the preliminary
inquiry was that Maylan had just finished a 100
break in a game of billiards he hud been playing.
Tile ease got no forrader.
THE CHALLENGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not like a vat in a pit
Would I weakly die;
But with, a torch lit
Facing the dark sky,
Facing the last dark with a great cry,
With a brave word for my soul —“It is I! It is I!’’
They have set me ever about
With walls of stone.
How shall I break out
To stand alone?
How shall I, free with death from all I have. known,
Lift the challenge of life in my heart’s tone?
All that my hands have done
Under the sky,
Evil and good in one—
Shall I ask why?
All that I have not done shall be in the cfy
When I say to the utter dark: “It is I! It is I!”
They have set me ever about
With words as a sea.
How shall I break out
That my sold may be
In the trumpet shout that is as the soul of me?
I had been kind as God, had my hands bee" free!
AH that my eyes have seen.
Let it stand by,
Witness of gold aid green
Sea-deep, star-hi ...
Let it hear me lift to the d.uk that last full cry,
The one brave word of my soul—“lt is I! It is 1!”

The Call to Economy Places Quality First.
MANY men are economically minded but fail to
appreciate the difference between apparent
and actual saving in the purchase of their
clothes. To pay a low price merely in order to limit
one’s spending is in reality the worst form of extrava-
gance. A definite standard of quality should be looked
for as the first essential —this is the wisest thing to do
from a personal standpoint and the surest way to save.
In an “Austral” Sac Suit men will find that
“Quality” establishes an unusual offering in Ready-
to-Wear Clothes.

A Former Chamber Magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions and Deputy Clerk of
the Peace speaks highly of Clements Tonic to those subjected to nerve strain.
Here is a copy of Staff-Sergeant Mac Nevin’s letter, written from his home:
S 2 Sunv Street, Darling-hurst,
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD. »•' S. Wales, 23/5/18.
I was so much a martyr to ill-health and bad nerves that I used to “jump out of my skin” at the least shock or
noise. This condition continued until I used your Clements Tonic, and now I have a different tale to tell.
Where I could not eat or sleep, I now enjoy my sleep and meals.
When I was C.P.S. and Chamber Magistrate, Registrar of District Court, and Deputy Clerk of the Peace, under two
of the leading Judges of N.S.W. in various country towns, for many years I relied a great deal on your tonic for mental
and physical energy during the exhaustive trials at the Criminal Sessions when I had to act as Deputy Clerk of the Peace.
After leaving the service in 1893. and following commercial pursuits for eight years, 1 still looked upon the tonic as
a fine standard medicine. lam now in my 53rd year and am Sergeant in the A.Q.M.G. Home Service Staff.
I permit you to use this letter as a token of my thanks for the great benefit
received from it, and my recommendation of it to others. . signed)
If you have any regal’d for your health keep this medicine beside you in winter or
summer. It is invaluable in cases of Brain-fag, Insomnia, Debility, Poor Appetite, Weak
Nerves and Facial Neuralgia. Get it and try it, as thousands of others have done.

A return laid before the Representatives
recently states the cost of the abortive
voluntary recruiting ballot at £11,565, which
was, of course, wholly wasted, just as Labor’s
outlay on its Perth Conference referendum
was thrown away. But what details there are
in the return are surprising. Victoria spent
£5371; Bananaland. £2096 ; N.S.W., £1095 ;
W.A., £116; S.A., £55; Tas.. £25; adminis-
trative expenses account for the balance.
Now somebody ought to ask for a return
giving the detailed cost of obtaining the
415.685 recruits sworn in since August. ’l4.
Dr. London, of Adelaide, strongly advo-
cated cremation before the committee in-
vestigating the West Terrace Cemetery. He
brushed aside sentimental or religious objec-
tions with. “I study the living more than the
dead.” Cremation, he explained, should be
made compulsory when death is from infec-
tious diseases such as cancer, since the
germs may reside in the soil: also, the
bodies of people dying with any malignant
diseases should be burned. What Lendon
noticed about cremations in Adelaide was
the extravagance of providing elaborate oak
coffins, which were ‘consumed in about two
minutes. The cost of cremation —£5 5s. —
he considered too expensive. Twenty to
twenty-five years ago the Cremation Society
was formed in Adelaide, and he was asked to
become a life member. To become a life
member one had to pay £lO 10s., whereas to
become a dead member the charge was only
£5 ss.
“T.” : Reverting to the French expeditior
to Australia in 1800: —
An atlas published in Paris in ISO 7 contained
two large charts which showed that nearly every
cape, island, gulf and peninsula on the southern
coast had been named after French men and women
who were prominent during the Revolution or the
Napoleonic regime. St. Vincent Gulf was Golte
Josephine; Spencer Gulf, Golfe Bonaparte; Kan-
garoo Island, L’lsle Deeres; Cape Jervis, Cap
d’Alembert; Turhbv Bay, Baie Masscna; Port
Germein, Baie Turenne; Louth Bay, Baie
Mart't ; Port Lincoln, Port Cha.mpagny; Inves-
tigator Strait, Detroit de Laccpede; and Back-
stairs Passage was Detroit do Colbert. Port Gawler
was probably Cap Lafayette; Edithburg, 1 Cap
Jeanne d’Arc; Wardang Island, Isle Dalberg; Wal-
laroo, Baie Pascal; Glenclg, (,’ap Nemours; and
Hungry Point (Y.P.), Cap la ltocliefoucault. Other
names used on maps of South Australia prepared
by the French were Murat, Carnot, Tourville, Jean
Bart, Vendome, Voltaire, Corneille and Lagrange..
Port Lincoln, or, as the French called it, Port
Champagny, was enthusiastically praised by Peron.
lie described it as the most favored point he had
■seen. Clad with thick forests it provided a delight-
ful contrast to the sterility and monotony of other
parts. While no fresh water had been discovered
there were indications of brooks. Its many advan-
tages, he wrote, guaranteed it much importance,
and of all the points explored it was the best
adapted ,or receiving a European colony. The port
was a magnificent one in which all the fleets of
the world could float, and it was a worthy rival of
Port Jackson. Many maintain that Port Lincoln
should have been the capital city of South Aus-
tralia, and if the French had carried out their
intentions it probably would have been.

If Ryan of Queensland goes into Federal
politics, which he seems to think of doing,
for he denies it so often, he will have just
one plank in his platform—cheap food. That
may mean either food that is cheaper than
it used to be. or food that is as
cheap as it ought to be. When it
used to be and what it ought to be
are other matters. Food that is as
cheap as it is ever likely to be
doesn’t come into the case. Cheap
food includes articles grown by
cheap labor or by economy of
effort; stolen victuals, garbage,
wild animals and human flesh.
Very fat monarchs have lived
cheaply because the grocer dared
not present his bill. The cost of
board and* lodging in Palestine
was 2d., but for how long the
boarder lodged isn’t stated. On
the other hand, a donkey’s head
once fetched something like £8 in
the same country. Cheap food is
comparative, like a long time or an unparal-
leled outrage. Also it is in the same category
with the house that is a stone’s-throw from
the railway station. They all require defini-
tion.
A further testimonial to the Defence De-
partment’s early war-time keenness was
given the other day at a meeting of the Aus-
tralian Chemical Institute, when Captain
J. M. Main, of the A.1.F., backed by Prof.
Orme Masson, of Melbourne University,
credited Australia with the invention of the
first box-respirator designed to protect the
Allies against Hun poison-gas. Richard
Fletcher, a chemical manufacturer from Gee-
long. who invented the device locally, gave
A.C.I. members his experiences with the
Defence authorities in placing the details
before them. He had hastily worked out his
respirator, shortly after the news of the
first Hun gas-attack came through, and had
filled a room with chlorine, put on his mask
and dived in. The respirator worked, leav-
ing him alive and happy, and in the first flush
of his joy he broke the glad news to Pearce’s
minions. They, according to Fletcher,
“seemed to find it not particularly useful,”
so the originator presently spent a bit more
COUSIN-JACK PHILOSOPHS.
"Ow's thy son geltin' on wot went to the war four pear ago?"
“Splendid: cudden be better."
“I spoase thee 'ear from un regular?"
“No; the young beggar ain't wrgate a line since he went; but no news is good news."
of his own money in patriotically cabling the
details of the respirator to the British War
Office. The reply was that the principle had
already been adopted, somebody else in Eng-
land having apparently hit upon the plan
and seen it successfully applied while
Pearce’s Department was yawning over it
here.
“T. 0.1.” : The late Charles Bowu, pioneer
fire-lighter, had some curious experiences in
bis career as superintendent in Sydney. At
one time a fee of ss. was paid for first infor-
mation of a fire. A short, nuggety young
fellow named Dunn earned many crowns by
bringing first information. He was so ener-
getic in this work that Bown had suspicions.
One night the scout brought to the station in
Batlmrst-street the report of an outbreak at
a bedding factory on Brickfield Hill. This
proved to be a fatal fire. A woman was asleep
in an upstairs room, and, being awakened,
jumped from the window, and sustained
injuries from which she died. A resident
of Kent-street, at the rear of the
factory, proved that she saw Dunn at
the back of the building immediately before
the alarm of fire. He was tried before Act-
ing-Justice Windeyer, convicted and sentenced
to death. This was commuted to life im-
prisonment. After some 12 years he was,
with a number of other long-sentence men,
released on condition of exile from Australia
—South Africa got most of them.
Some public works are beastly permanent.
The State joinery enterprise at Rozelle
(Sydney) was burned down five years ago,
and abandoned in disgust. But it still cost
£77 last year for “working expenses”—pre-
sumably inspection of the debris —and £1204
for interest. Three abandoned or suspended
N.S.W. State enterprises—joinery works,
limeworks and brickworks —managed among
them to earn a loss of £5689 for the year,
and the accumulated losses are £52,636. A
device in such a case would be to pay
off the vanished capital out of revenue, and
put the interest bill and the loss and the
unpleasant incident and the dead horse out
of sight. Mistakes are inevitable in every
business, and they should be paid for and
buried. Many people are a mistake from
first to last, but keeping their remains in
the house after death doesn’t improve the
situation, and it deteriorates the house.

DECEMBER SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here’s December come again
With blossoms in her hair;
Boses at the window-pane
Laugh on every air.
All the sea’s a merry blue;
Scarce a foamy feather
Flies before the breeze that, grew
Out of laughing weather.
Last year’s sighs are past and gone
With all we loved and lost;
Happy summer ripples on—
Who shall count the cost?
Here’s the .sun, with wealth unspent,
Still a gracious giver;
Goorge-strcet tills with good content,
So does George’s River.
Young December runs so fast
Wi th feet of joy and fire;
One white morning burns the past
Into new desire.
Catch the fancy how you may ;
Only this discover:
Every dawning brings a day,
Every night a lover.
Last year’s tears are shed and dry
With all that went before;
Little happy feet go by
Tinkling past the door.
This is true, though time be fleet
And a. sigh come after;
All the gods will mortals meet
In December's laughter.

Goodyear Conveyor and Elevator Beltings
Every mining- engineer is well aware of the very severe
conditions which his Conveyer and Elevator Belting has
to meet. Ordinary belting which had not undergone
special preparation for this strenuous work would give
only a very limited service Goodyear long ago recog-
nised that Conveyors and Elevators require an extra
high-grade and specially-constructed Belting to meet
the demands imposed upon it.
The canvas duck in Goodyear Conveyor Belts is a special
.veave or heavy construction, yet with greater tensile strength
than ordinary duck of this weight.
The special weave eliminates the stretch and produces a fabric
that can be properly impregnated with rubber, so that the
finished Goodyear product is practically free from stretch, thus
eliminating the annoyance and loss due to stoppage to cut out
.stretched portions of belt.
We use the word “impregnated” for the reason that there is a
vast difference in the manufacture of belting, between ordinary
coated duck and Goodyear impregnated duck. The latter is
more expensive, but renders the duck moisture proof and
flexible. In addition to this, Goodyear Conveyor and Elevator
Belts have a thin sheet or skim coat'of high-grade rubber
between each and every ply.
The belt surface is filled with the best rubber, cured to resist

WHAT DOCTORS PRESCRIBE FOR
INDIGESTION.
Physicians who have specialised in the
treatment of stomach troubles are naturally
in a position to judge intelligently as to the
best thing to use. It is therefore a matter
of interest to those who suffer from indiges-
tion, gastritis, dyspepsia, pain after eating,
heartburn, etc., to learn that physicians who
have devoted, their lives to the alleviation of
human suffering are more and more instruct-
ing these sufferers to get a package of
Bisurated Magnesia from the chemist and
take a half-teaspoonful in a little hot water
immediately after eating or whenever pain is
felt. Doctors who prescribe Bisurated Mag-
nesia do so because they know it gives quick
relief in nearly every instance—because it is
not a secret remedy, and because no ill-effect
follows its use. For these reasons sufferers
from dyspepsia, indigestion and stomach
troubles generally are strongly advised to
get. a package of Bisurated Magnesia from
their nearest chemist and begin its use with-
out delay.— Advt.

‘‘O.L. ’: Pondering the loss on the State
Parliamentary refreshment-rooms, mentioned
recently in The Bulletin, I conclude that
the introduction of the cafeteria system, pro-
perly worked, would probably solve the pro-
blem of how to overtake the yearly loss,
£3OOO, for the past financial year. Looking
THE CENSOR, AGAIN!
VISITOR FROM THE BACKBLOCKS : “What's oil the shindy over the rood?"
EXCITED PATRIOT: “ Ain't you ’card? Peace!"
VISITOR: “Go on! Which side, guv' in?"
over some old records, I find that the deficit
for 1910 was a comparative trilie of £l3OO,
so the present situation is plainly a despe-
rate one. I would suggest the provision of
a. series of simple meals, each enough to sus-
tain life without pandering to gross appe-
tites. Inexpensive but filling buns, tarts
and assorted pastries could be sold at a 25
per cent, advance on their cost, the supply
being renewed every couple of days. Coffee
and tea, made once a day and stored in large
urns, with an alcohol-lamp under each, is
considered good enough for the train-travel-
ling public of the State, and should be quite
adequate for Parliamentarians. The hard-
stuff section might be opened once a day for
half an hour or so, when members could buy
enough for the next 24 hours, storing the
same in their coat-tail pockets. Those desir-
ing a bite, and being too lazy or too busy
to go outside for something more savory and
expensive, would grab a tray from a' pile,
snatch a sausage-roll here, a penn’orth of
ginger-nuts there or a jam-tart further along
the counter, and pour himself out a cup of
coffee from one of the urns. Then he would
take the filled tray along for inspection by the
Usher of the Currant Bun. who would re-
mark “sixpence-ha’p’ny, please,” and be
ready with change as required. Acting as
Usher of the C.B. wouldn’t be this official’s
steady job, of course. That might be, say,
Black Rodding or dusting out the' Parlia-
mentary library. The foregoing neat plan
would inflict no actual privation nor incon-
venience on members, while it would cer-
tainly mean a large saving of public money.
Who, then, will be upstanding in the House
to advocate this really important reform?
Perhaps Treasurer McPherson, who is con-
tinually harping on the need for economy,
will be consistent and come forward at once
with a motion to deal with the business.

“Dial Sight”: Some strange edifices have
been used as hospitals in France during the
war. Perhaps the most ancient and historic
commandeered was an old fortress on the
outskirts of Doullens. The fickle hand that
juggles with soldiers’ fortunes lodged me in
there a few months back. The old citadel
has seen stormy days; it was captured by
the Spaniards after a gory fight as far back
as 1595. The high walls, the now dried-up
moat, the sally-port and most of the other
features of the medieval fortress are still
there. Prior to being taken over by the
Canadians as a specialist hospital for ears
and other organs of the head, it did service
as a reformatory for wayward flappers. There
was a fair sprinkling of Aussies in it in my
time, and the tops of the walls provided an
excellent possie for sunbaths, two-up and
other aids to convalescence. A hard-doer of
a Yankee, who had joined up with the A.I.F.
in Sydney, discovered the entrance to an
underground tunnel. With him as cicerone
the walking-cases had several unofficial tours
of this dark and noisome passage. Its length
and depth show that the old-time warrior had
a mighty capacity for fatigue work, and. like
the modern scrapper, apparently realised the
virtue of having a substantial dugout to
retire into when the besieging force was send-
ing them over rather too thick and heavy.

“8.T.”: I rode home from a friend’s
funeral with the mild, little, fat, ginger
clergyman, and he told me, without the
smallest intention of being humorous. His
cloth had its experiences too, dear friend.
For instance, in the
small township from
which he had provi-
dentially been called
within the last few
months one of his
most devout parish-
ioners was ITobbs, of
the general store.
Hobbs haggling over
was holy but parsi-
monious, he desired to
have his soul saved
but at cut-rates, and
when he married the
good shepherd was
not astonished to find
Hobbs haggling over
the fee. He knocked
it down to two
guineas, and then de-
ducted six per cent,
for cash. Mrs. Hobbs
kept her place for
nine weeks and then
eloped with a corn-
mere i a 1 traveller.
Hobbs divorced her,
and presently wanted
to marry again. The
clergyman stipulated
for four guineas.
Hobbs demurred, and
induced the shepherd
to agree to take three.
“But, after all, he
married the second
Mrs. Hobbs before the
registrar,” said the
minister, “ because I
would not give him a
two years' guarantee .”
“Gouger”: Have you ever been in a
signalling corps? Neither have I. Don’t
ever want to be now. In the old training
days—ever so long ago it seems—we used
to envy the signallers and throw malicious
borak at them. They never did a picquet,
never did a guard, never did one solitary
fatigue duty. Just stood all day long wav-
ing flags, and at night played with flash-
lamps. But in the desert campaign things
were different. There we would see a troop
of signallers, under shell-fire, gallop full
belt across the open to the nearest hill from
where they could flash back intelligence to
H.Q. And on that hill they would have to
stand, splendid' targets for the concentrated
fire of Turkish guns. As men fell they
were replaced by reinforcements in the early
part of the campaign, but soon the reinforce-
ments dwindled and dwindled, and at last
failed to come. I have seen some of these
troops reduced from 30 to eight men, and
these, exhausted by months of fighting, great
loss of sleep and desert hardship, had to
carry on the work of the 30 that make up
a full troop. It was impossible to have
done it, except for the men's sense of
honor. Out there it was the unwritten law
to “Carry on,” until a bullet put an end to
all things, or a man collapsed physically or
mentally.
“Gunner”: It was a very dark night
and the digger on sentry duty had just been
in trouble for “neglecting duty in that he
did not challenge men in a voice loud
enough.” When he saw a shadow coming
towards him he cried in a voice like thunder,
“Halt!” No response from the figure.
“Halt! Why the don’t you well
halt 3” Out of the dark floated the scornful,
“What the hell's wrong?” Tfie sentry
calmed down. “All right, digger,” he said ;
“I thought it was the C. 0.”

“B.” : Much apprehension exists in our local
V.A.D. circles. At an inspection recently
the mandarin in charge found fault witii
several of the girls who paraded in white
hose. After reminding them of the regula-
tion on the subject, he broke up the parade
by firmly stating: “Black shoes and stock-
ings must be worn, and nothing else.” Thank
Heaven, the summer is with us!

The Hughes Ministry has a scheme
whereby the British Government is to “co-
ordinate” with Australia in developing the
Papuan oil industry, about which Hughes and
co. have been pottering all their official lives.
“Co-ordinate” is one of the hazy terms, like
“organise” and "develop,” that the Prime
Minister wraps round himself like a gas-
attack. Oil is a precious thing nowadays.
Britain fought its first disastrous campaign
to preserve the Persian supply. Roumania
almost committed suicide to save its oil-wells.
A mixed Allied force raised Sheol at Baku
to cut the Huns off from the priceless sub-
stance. Yet Hughes, the remarkable, can’t
get the stfifft out of the ground, when it is
almost certainly there and near the surface,
without co-ordinating. He is the sort of man

“Bert R.” : There were always droves of
soldiers adrift in every detail camp in Eng-
land besides the chronic absentees in London
and other places. When I first struck Per-
harn Downs the camp was 2000 over
strength. The biggest parade was outside
the pay-office once a fortnight, while the
scramble at meal-times was hard going.
Everybody carried a knife and fork in his
puttee. It saved time. One day the “heads”
sent ont a band during parade hours. The
idlers flocked from all directions to see what
was doing. A cordon of military police was
drawn round them, but they smelt a rat
and broke through. The only captures were
new arrivals and men awaiting classifica-
tion. In the hills behind Wareham, Tommies
had constructed trenches, dugouts, etc., dur-
ing manoeuvres. These were soon discovered
by our boys and made comfortable with a
plentiful supply of blankets commandeered
from the camp. Braziers were improvised,
packs of cards appeared, and occasionally a
bottle of whisky helped to pass the time-
This lasted right through the winter, but
on the 6th Division being fonned the authori-
ties took action. The military police organ-
ised a raid with dogs. It will long be re-
membered by the bitter fight which ensued.
There was no better gauge of popular feel-
ing than the unanimity with which every-
body—officers included —joined in. The
crowd’s blood was up, and for four days
the whole camp participated in reprisals
upon the police. Having paid off a few old
scores, they settled down quietly to work
again; but the courts-martial consequent
upon the outbreak were running on for
months.
DEVOTIONAL HAIR.

that as our pets’ superfluous hair is being requisi-

It may be I’m rheumatic;
Have got no strength to spare;
Am vacant in the attic,
And no use anywhere;
But, thank the Power that made me,
I still can grow some hair.
My bounteous locks shall billow
Where wounded valor lies ;
Mv curls shall be its pillow ;
While heroes of some size
.May sleep upon my whiskers
Until they care to rise.
When some keen youngster, skipping,
Mill ask before the throng:
“What did you do?” Why, tripping.
Shall flow my glory-song:
“My lad, I gave my whiskers
To help the war along 1”

In every stage of its manufacture every precaution, however tedious or expensive, is taken to exclude
inferior materials from
“ADAMAX” ROOFING.
For we have always proceeded on the theory that a big and permanent success must be founded on the
enduring satisfaction of the buyer. The “Adamax” phrase, “The Best Roofing Value in the World,” is not
a mere slogan. It is a real provable fact which we defend with an enviable reputation gained through
over 30 years of honest dealings with the public.
“Adamax” Roofing resists all the ravages of the elements—Rain, Cold, Heat, Wind, Sea Air, Gases,
Chemical Fumes, etc. Rust has no effect on it —there is no pinholing, and as the basis is long-fibred
felt, thoroughly impregnated with pure mineral Hydro-Carbon—it contains no fish-oil or tar, which
quickly dry out, leaving the felt dead and liable to rot.
“Adamax” gives the best service under all conditions—good or adverse, and as it can be laid on
perfectly flat roofs the true economy in using it is clearly apparent.
It Costs One-third the Price of Galvanised-iron.
It rolls into small compass, and means a great saving in freight to people living out of town.
Sold in rolls 72 feet long x 3 feet wide—each containing 22 sq. yds., allowing for 2-inch overlap.
In 1-ply (thin), 2-ply (medium), 3-ply (thick).

POLITICAL
POINTS
Our Government is always cabiegram-
ming at great expense about things that
don’t matter. For instance, Mr. Higgs
asked if it was true that Mr. Hughes in
London had refused for three months to
speak to Mr. Joseph Cook in London. Mr.
Watt telegraphed, at the public charge, to
find out if Mr. Cook had been not spoken to
by Mr. Hughes. When Watt gets the news
about Hughes he will tell what he has
learned to Higgs. Then Higgs will probably
want to know what it was Hughes didn't
speak about when he kept his long, silence,
and Watt will go cablegramming again.
Incidentally, the whole story is probably
absurd. Hughes couldn’t avoid speaking
even to a worm for three months.
The latest gag is that Hughes must re-
main in Loudon to administer that end of
the Commonwealth’s repatriation policy.
This, of course, omits to account for Joe
Cook remaining; but the fertile Watt gets
over the omission by explaining that when
the time comes for Hughes to tear himself
away the Ministry will consider whether
Cook ought to stay behind, and proceed to
do the administering, or come home with his
very dear friend. This whimsical arrange-
ment seems to leave Joseph hanging in the
air, so to speak, and gives color to the rumor
that Cook is being detained in England
through fear of what Hughes will do if he
loaves, and of what Willie Kelly may say
if he arrives. But what is this “policy” that
THE NEW GOOSE-STEP.

tice conferences at Spa. Herr Erzberger and
General von Winterfeld frequently affected great
irritation, striking the green table with their fi-is."

requires the presence in London of Prime
Minister and robs Australia of Cook? Has
any other country found it necessary to in-
sist upon the head of its Government con-
cealing himself thousands of miles away from
his regular job, and allegedly give attention
to the details incidental to loading trans-
ports? Surely there should be some expla-
nation on these points, and some details
about what the multitudinous civil officials
and military officers in London are doing for
their money. Also a few words about the
reason for continuing to give A. Fisher
nothing more to do than show exalted per-
sonages over the million-pounds-worth of
edifice he inhabits. The impression given by
the sequence of events lately is that Andy is
regarded by the Federal Ministry as of less
use than a rouseabout at £1 a week and his
tucker. As Andy gets £5OOO a year. the.
problem of how he earns the money deserves
clearing up.
Somebody at the Hobart recruiting-office
posted up this notice when the armistice
news came through : “The Kaiser is out of a
job; so are we.” The same words, with an
equally truthful but less cheerful meaning,
might also be posted outside the Repatria-
tion Department's Melbourne headquarters,
where there is a constant waiting list of
many hundred returned soldiers. Australia
has promised her fighting men that they will
get proper treatment when they came back;
but there is a poor augury for the future in
the present condition of affairs —500 men
waiting along the kerbstone, on a limited
sustenance-allowance, with thousands more
of them to come! Something will have to
b • done about it. How about importing
some more kerbstones?
“N.A.”: The emphatic decision of the
Eden-Monaro electors, authorising “Jack”
Bailey to occupy the late Gus Miller’s seat
in N.S.W. Assembly, adds another name to
the Australian Workers’ Union’s roll of Par-
liamentarians. Right since the inception of
THE OUTCASTS.
THE KAISER (to the shirker): "Mine poor
jriendt. war is truly hell, especially
when it ms over."
the Labor Electoral League, in 1890, the
then Australian Shearers' Union, now the
A.W.U., has retained a pretty tight rein on
the political ribbons so far as the caucus
party was concerned. Among the first batch
of Labor members elected in 1891 were three
A.S.U. officials. Arthur ltae, then an official
of the Riverina branch of the organisation,
tackled the Murrumbidgee seat, winning it
only to lose it again in ’94. However, he
got into the Senate many years later. Frank
Cotton, who, during the maritime strike, re-
presented the Wagga shearers, and was
elected one of the members for Newtown
(N.S.W.), also had a brief term. The third
of the trio to burst into Parliament in 1891
was T. H. Williams, of the Scone branch
of the A.S.U., but. like his two colleagues,
he failed to survive the general election of
1894, and disappeared from the political
records. W. G. Spence, in 1898, being
general secretary of the A.W.U.. pocketed
the Cobar seat: but at the first Federal con-
tests he shrewdly selected the Darling elec-
torate in the Federal arena, and after a brief
arid profitless Ministerial spell as P.M.G. he
rounds off as Nationalist member for Darwin
(Tas. L Cobar (N.S.W.) was a snap for the
late Donald Macdonell, who had several
limes failed to win the Barwon, once only
by a few votes on a recount. He became
Chief Secretary in the Mc-Gowen Adminis-
tration of 1910. and died in 1911. The late
Private C. S. Fern succeeded him, and died
this year after being invalided home. At
the N.S.W. elections in March, 1917. Tom
Smith, an A.W.U. official of the new school,
ousted Morrish from King. A.W.U. officials
elected to the House of Representatives from
New South Wales included the late, Corporal
W. .1. Johnson, killed at Pozieres, who from
1910-13 sat for Calare ; and Arthur Blakely,
who defeated his former sponsor—W. G.
Spence—for the Darling. The president of
the New South Wales branch of the Labor
party is an A.W.U. official (W. H. Lam-
bert), and eight members out of 30 of the
State executive are also A.W.U. officials.
X. S. Wales Premier Bill Holman should
go down in history as Bill of Sale. YV hen
his next loan is floated he will have pawned
everything.
Possibly one of the terms of peace will be
the removal of a certain stone beast from
above the door of the Hun Parliament
House. The animal is trampling on a ball
marked "Elsass-Lotlieringen.” For over 40
years this hulking emblem reminded the
annexed peoples that they were conquered
folk of no account, and that there was no
d—d equality or brotherhood about the
business. As a further
reminder, the deputies
from Alsace-Lorraine
had no votes. Curi-
ously enough. rhe
Hun population in
Alsace-Lorraine never
protested: it was
worth while being
disfranchised so loug
as their French fel-
low-citizens were an-
noyed. The Ilun mind is that of the boy of
arrested mental development who tortures
eats for amusement.
Premier Peake, of South Australia,
took an unusual course when a motion
of no-confidence was moved at the fag-
end of the session. Instead of adjourn-
ing the House as soon as ( ipposition-leader
Gunn gave notice that he would move the
supposedly lethal motion the next day,
Peake calmly proceeded with the day’s work.
And the next day, when Gunn actually
launched his gas attack, the Premier was
calmer than ever. Gunn moved his motion,
O’Flaherty followed it up as seconder. Peake
added a few bantering remarks, and after
that one of his supporters calmly moved for
the closure, which was promptly carried in
spite of the loud protests of the Opposition.
The no-confidence motion was then lost on
a purely party vote in record time. No
farce should be drawn out.
William Gibson, the Farmers' Union can-
didate for Corangamite (Vic.), is a brother
of David Gibson. ALL.A. for Grenville, one
of the clutch of V.F.U. men who succeeded
at the last Assembly elections. William
farms at Lisniore, on the plains north of
Lake Corangamite and within a few miles of
David, whose ranch is at Oressy. Shortly
before the V.F.U. made its selection, the
Union executive put a rather sporting offer
before the Returned Soldiers’ party, which
had chosen its man. The V.F.U. proposed
that both selected aspirants should submit
themselves to Arbitration, if the K.S. party
cared to do so, sooner than jostle each other
out of a place at the election. The intro-
duction of preferential voting settled the
matter, however, and both candidates are
now going to the poll.
At the last meeting of the outgoing City
Council of Adelaide the usual pleasant
things were said about Mayor Glover, who
is proposed for another year in office. Coun-
cillor I,undie contributed the cheerful re-
mark : “About time the back-scratching was
finished,” adding that the mayor is paid
£lOOO “for sitting back, looking wise, and
sometimes doing nothing.” Cohen, who has
at various times been mayor himself for a
record total of seven years, said in a pained
tone that he had never known a “discordant
voice” raised at such a moment before. As
a matter of fact, the, children’s playground
on the park lands, which Glover has fitted
up instead of giving the usual “reception” to
fat citizens, is understood to have cost, alone,
well over the £lOOO voted to him for the year.
Labor’s latest effort in Victoria to raise
political funds was a “king” competition—a
ludicrous business, though the three competi-
tors brought in over £.”00 between them.
Frank Ilyett. with £l7O. headed the list as
“King of the Railways,” Federal Opposition-
leader Frank Tudor (“King of Labor”)
taking second place with £125. The sup-
porters of Frank Anstey, M.H.R., who in his
absence was given the painful title of “King
of the Rebels,” were only rebellious to the
tune of £40 —poor encouragement for the
Bolshevik element.
Red Tape is always strangling somebody.
Certain returned soldiers, temporary em-
ployees in Alelbourne of the Federal Govern-
ment, at 10s. a day. took time off to attend
a competitive exam, for a permanent position
in the service ; and their pay was docked for
the days they spent in trying to better their
positions. It seems a quaint way of reward-
ing patriotism and encouraging ambition, but
the Federal Government is a quaint crowd.
One conspicuous Federal statesman is
a regular attendant at the picture-theatres
in his own suburb, and takes especial
interest in the Australian Gazette when
he is among those on the screen. On a
recent occasion a rail gentleman arrived in
the dark, and seated himself next a pleasant
citizen, who immediately engaged him in
general conversation. Presently the Gazette
was displayed, and the affable person re-
marked with quite unnecessary warmth:
“There’s that blighter Blank butting in

way that man pushes his barrow gives me

unrepresented during demobilisation. Labor-
man Prendergast insisted that an A.G. was
needed by Vic. to “float loans and sell pro-
duce.” The view of the Ministry was that “a
business man is needed to look after the in-
terests of the co-operative organisations
likely to be formal .” After these illuminat-
ing observations or pot-shots or whatever
they were, the expenditure of £5500 was duly
authorised. Manifestly the outlay repre-
sents an insolent breach of trust by the
Assembly, for if there are no better reasons

authorise the proceeding have not even the

INFLUENZA
An Ounce of Prevention Worth a Pound of Cure.
99
IT has been truly stated that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The
Australian public are face to face with the possibility of an Influenza epidemic similar to
that which has been raging' elsewhere. It has already broken out in New Zealand and is
at the very doors of the Commonwealth.
At such a time it stands each individual in the community in hand to keep a close watch on
themselves and maintain their usual standard of health. A dose ot Dr. Morses Indian Root
Pills two or three times a week, or one or two pills each night, is advised. It would also be
advisable to take from sto io grains of AS I IRIN two 01 tin ee 11 nres dmix, 1 e <
sorts or 10 trains of OUI NINE on retiring at night at the same time the pills are taken. A
common cold can usually be broken up if either QUININE or ASPIRIN is taken with Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as directed, on the first indication. Petroleum Oils, Salts, I onics
and other so-called remedies are of little use to cleanse the system and keep these gemrs in check;
in fact they will have a tendency to aggravate an already deranged gastric condition. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching, cleansing remedy, and will drive these germs out
of the system.
Should, however, an attack of Influenza develop, lose no time in sending for the family
doctor and go to bed at once. This is the best advice that can be given. Don t try and doctor
yourself. If you have the real Influenza your digestion will be a wreck, your head, legs and
back will ache, your heart action will be affected, and you will have a temperature. These
conditions need the attention of a skilled medical attendant. He may continue the tieatment
indicated above or he may not, but it will only be safe for the person affected to at once go to
bed when the first definite Influenza symptoms appear, and place himself wholly and unreservedly
in the doctor’s care.

ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Geob”: Frome Bob, of Mount Searle, is
one of the oldest aboriginals known in South Aus-
tralia. He met John McDouall . Stuart when that
explorer was making a trigonometrical survey of the
Mt. Searle country. The black states that Stuart
gave him flour and bacca, but not knowing their
value he threw them away. Old Bob is now blind
and unable to walk. In the words of his gin: “Hini
close up finish ; no more walk about.” When the aged
abo. first saw a motor-car he gave the following
description of it: “Him bin all same buggy, turnerh'
handle, big fella run about all day growlem, stink
all same camel.”
A DIPLOMATIC CURSER.
MILITANT MINER: “I’ve 'ad some terrible
come-out with the manager, Jimmy. I
called un all the blasted, lurid blighters
I cud lay tongue to.”
THE OTHER MINER: “ Thee'st 'ave sack now,
sure enough.”
MILITANT MINER: “No I won’t. I said it all
to meself.”
“F.”: Australia has had only one Chinese
bushranger. In the ’sixties one Sam Poo, who had
been at the Mudgee (N.S.W.) diggings, took to the
road and emulated in a small way the deeds of his
contemporary, Thunderbolt. He went so far as to
shoot a policeman and, later, put up a good scrap
against three troopers and a black-tracker. They
proved too much for him, and he was hanged at
Bathurst.
“Hooker”: After examining 15,000 people
in the area between Townsville and Cooktown Dr.
Waite, of the Rockefeller Institute, says that 20 per
cent, of the whites and over 85 per cent, of the
aboriginals have the hookworm parasite. He puts the
loss of efficiency in adults caused by the parasite at
from 20 to 30 per cent., but that is not its worst
side. As his series of photographs shows, it causes
a dwarfing and stunting of the children and youths.
Not only are they undersized, thin, miserable and
lacking in brain-power, but in bad cases they are
practically unsexed. The disease, Dr. Waite asserts,
can be cured in 75 per cent, of the cases, and, better
than that, the root cause, which is filth and careless-
ness, can be overcome and the horror got rid of. The
Rockefeller Institute, which is tackling hookworm in
30 countries, is prepared to get busy if it can get
reasonable co-operation; but the Queensland Govern-
ment does not think there are enough votes to be got
out of it to bother about. Federal Minister Glynn
says that he knows how serious it is, but that it is a
matter for the State. So the hookworm stands a good
chance of going on getting into the bowels of Aus-
tralian citizens and sapping their life.
■***■*
“Lantana”: A real jim-jam was recently
brought into Cessnock (N.S.W.) in the form of a
small snake with fins. The absurdity is about a
foot long, of greenish-brown color with black spots,
and, unlike the ordinary snake, the tail ends rather
abruptly, as if offended. The fins (or whatever they
might be called) are two in number on each side of
the body, about two-thirds of the way down from the
head. Several old bush-hands affirmed they had
never seen anything like it when sober.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: If you want to save your-
self time and a lot of hard work when skinning a
beast, procure an air-pump—an ordinary bicycle-
pump will do. Hang the carcase up and make a
small hole in the hide, preferably at the chest, and
pump in atmosphere. The cellular tissue which
•connects the skin afid the muscles contains a large
number of vesicles, which lie on each other, and in
which the fat is contained. When too much air
enters these (as it does in certain illnesses) they
burst. When the air is artificially introduced the
skin entirely leaves the flesh, and it then takes only
a few knife cuts to remove the envelope. A pelt
divorced in this way is much cleaner than one taken
off in the usual fashion.
* * * *
“Silas Snell”: Wigg’s homestead was
within a mile of our tents on Pint Pot, where three
of us were trenching for the reefs, and we were glad
to drift down there on occasions to break the
monotony that three mep can set up in the pristine
wilderness. At the Wiggs homestead there were
three sons, old Dan Wiggs and Mrs. Wiggs. The
sons were young, the eldest perhaps 22, the youngest
18, and all over 6ft. Wiggs was a big, hulking man
of 60, tough as a red-gum butt, un-
kempt and about as amiable as a polar-
bear on a hot day. But the one thing
we all commented upon after our first
visit was the broad, stout, leather strap
hung up behind the door of the Wiggs’s
kitchen. We had noticed, too, with
what an expression of sullen ferocity
Wiggs senior had sat and glowered upon
the weapon, for obviously it was nothing
else. We all remembered just such an-
other strap (not quite as weighty, per-
haps) hung up behind the door at home
for thij proper correction of wayward
small boys. “Fancy any of those great
slouches of lads being larruped with a
strap like a, bit of a kid,” said Evans.
We agreed that Dan Wiggs looked the
man to do it. Then Wiggs was absent
for g day «r two to the manifest dis-
tress of his. family. Evans gathered that
the old man went on occasional bursts.
I struck across on the following Sunday
afternoon and found something doing in
the Wiggs hou-«ehold. I heard continu-
ous blows and roars of imprecation and
pain. In the back yard Wigg3 (I took
it) was castigating one of his giant
sons. The victim was face, downward,
Mrs. Wiggs was holding his head, two
of the boys held his legs. But here I
made the inspiriting discovery that
Dave, the eldest son, was the family
flagellator. The party face-down in the
dirt who was getting a pearl of a hid-
ing was father. Then I realised that
that strap behind the kitchen door was
an influential Rechabite influence in the
home lif.e of Daniel Wiggs.
* * * *
“Myall”: How is this for a record catch
for a single dog-trap at one setting? I placed the
device on a pad which had been followed by a dog
for several successive nights, and next morning found
eight of the tribe awaiting attention. A dingo bitch
had been caught in the trap, and during her enforced
detention had given birth to a litter of seven.
* * * *
“Melos”: When I read “Billy Bong’s”
menu (B. 24/10/’18) to Black Jack, he suggested the
following additions and alterations: Kangaroo-tail
soup; wild duck (roast) ; pigeon-pie; quail on toasted
bread and meat plant; porcupine (roast) with yams
and garnished with wild parsley ; iguana (fried), with
native onions. (If you are on friendly terms with
Mrs. Binghi ask her to give you a few instructions
on preparing this item. The N.T. abos. serve up the
’go with immature gum-leaves, in the absence of
Brussels sprouts; but I wouldn’t advise a novice to
attempt it.) Corned wallaby ; bandicoot (stewed). On
MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE OF IT.
AUNTY: “Wherever did you get that costume? Everybody’s looking at you."
NIECE: “From your own daughter."
AUNTY: “Ah; well borrow my son's in future.”
no account take on kangaroo-rat, which is passed
even by the dogs. Puddings: Billardiera scandens,
with lillipilli sauce, stewed figs and honey. Native
fruits: wild raspberries, grapes, oranges, figs, etc.
lvurrajong coffee (grind the seed and prepare as
you do the ordinary coffee-bean) ; infusion of tea-tree
leaves (sparingly). If you take the full course, try
a dose of native cascarilla as a corrective. P.S.—
The best bush crockery I know is stringy-bark. Strip
a knob or projection of its rind, and you have a
cup; slice pieces from the tree-trunk and use as
plates.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : Among the cheeriest and most
lovable birds in the bush are the babblers, which
should be highly valued by the orchardist —though
that suspicious and jealous grower seldom values any-
thing that flies —if only for their partiality for .the
codlin-moth. They are commonly known as the
happy family, and associate in little companies like
the apostle-birds. They are restless, evqr-chattering,
fussilv-cheerful creatures, so tame that they will
dance within a few feet of a person sitting under a
tree. Bush entertainers, some call them; they are
also called chatterers and hoppers. They work sys-
tematically, destroying the larva: of many pests that
lie hidden about the root of a tree, and thrusting
their slightly-curved bills under loose bark and into
every crevice and hole as they hop up and down the
trunk and branches. The birds are stationary and
widely distributed. They are often confounded with
the grey jumpers, or apostle-birds, though there is
little resemblance except in habits. The jumpers
are leaden-grey in color, with black wing-feathers
and tail. In winter they are often seen in
companies of 12, from which they get their
name of Twelve Apostles. Each pair builds a small,
round mud nest on top of a limb. The babblers, or
happy family, which are a trifle smaller than the
apostle-birds, build a fairly large structure of stick
and leaves, wedged among small upright branches.
A favorite haunt is among the cypress pine in sandy
country.
* * * *
“Pick”: On Monaro, the best watered
region of N. S. Wales, springs that in the recollec-
tion of the oldest inhabitant or his grandfather
never previously failed have this spring suddenly
gone dry. Has the bottom fallen out of the plateau,
or does this presage an unusually blistering drought ?
* * * *
“Te Whare”: The kite family, as a rule,
are not gregarious in nesting habit, but Tom Ward,
in his “Rambles of an Australian Naturalist,” states
that he found (in the Spencer Gulf district of S.A.)
more than a dozen nests, placed like a great plat-
form on a low tree some SOft. above the ground.
They were so close together that they actually
touched. Ward climbed up and inspected the
“rookery,” and found that the foul nests contained
either three white eggs, rounded in shape and
splashed with broum, or three unfledged kitelets;
but in one nest there were four eggs. The square-
tailed kite family, from writer’s experience, usually
builds alone, on a tall gum, at any rate in settled
country. But Ward’s birds may have been the
brown hawk (berigora in abo. lingo), which is often
observed in small companies hunting about South
Coast (N.S.W.) salt lakes. Rabbit is a favorite
dish with this bird, but it varies the menu with
lizard and grasshopper, or locust. The brown hawk
may occasionally renovate a nest, and use it yeai
after year, as the wedge-tailed eagle does with its
great clothes-basket-shaped incubator.
THE REST CURE.
SOAKE : “No! No more boozing for me. I've
cut it out. Feel splendid; an' d'you
know, I find I can take two or three
more pints c' day than I could when I
was drinking."
“Nunawading”: There is a wide-spread
discussion going on as to whether cormorants are
beneficial or mischievous. The point appears to be
settled by the Maoriland Government having paid
£75 last fishing season for the destruction of 606
birds. A Victorian fishery inspector was lately on
the Tambo River, Gippsland. He saw a flock of
about 100 cormorants voraciously devouring the
splendid mullet and bream that were abundant.

Meggitt Limited’s (m]m) Linseed Oil Meal
“The no-trouble fodder” for all classes of stock, is “EQUALLY
AS GOOD AS MILK.” So says Mr. Charles Newings, of Berry,
the successful breeder of Ayrshire Stock.
If Meggitt Limited's Linseed Meal “is ever left out of their
ration, they are not at all satisfied,” says Mr. J. H. Johns,
Frewville, S.A.
Meggitt Limited's Linseed Meal “is without question one of
the very best foods for cattle,” is the opinion of the duny
Friesian Stud Farm, Wellington, New Zealand.

HIS SPHERE OF USEFULNESS.
IMPORTANT COP: “Here, get out o’ this. What arc yer doin’ there?”
LOAFER : “Well, now, if it comes ter that, wot are you doin’ here?”
COP: “Me! I’m doin’ me duty.”
LOAFER: “Ah! Well, I’m makin' the duty fer you ter do.”
“Sarto”: At the beginning of spring I
leased my lionejsuckle creeper to a very pretty
little couple who built themselves a dainty two-
storey mansion of girass, wool, pieces of rag,
feathers, cobweb, etc., and then proceeded to bring
up their family of three without taking the slightest
bit of notice of the children playing about. The
lessees’ part of the contract was to keep down, to
the best of their ability, all the useless, vegetable-
assassinating insects in my garden, and I must say they
fulfilled their obligations. The nest is a work of
art, hung by pieces of cotton, string, web, etc.,
woven round the branches, about eight inches long
and four wide, tapering to a blunt point at the
bottom. The upper, bowl-like apartment for father
isn’t as well furnished as mum’s and the kids’ room,
which is lined snugly throughout with feathers, and
has only a small round opening at about the
middle of it. The proprietor is the tiny yellow-
• tailed tit, a greenish-grey chap with a yellow mark
over each eye and a bright yellow tail and back
under the wings. He is the only bird in the world
who indulges in two-storey establishments.
“Yarrum”: To euchre white-ants build on
blockg liberally dosed with common salt. Ari old
hand at Nelligen (N.S.W.) did that, and had no
trouble, although his neighbors' humpies were being
eaten down by the pests. A wooden school and
residence there were chewed up in five years, and
a comparatively new hotel in the district was in a
very wobbly state when I left. I reckoned
that it wasn’t safe to go into it, and used to have
my drinks let down from the balcony.
“E.”: The platypus has a wonderful
homing instinct. 1 carried one in a bag from its
native river (where it was caught op a night-line
set for eels) to a shallow lake about a mile away.
It was gently slid into the water, but promptly
swam ashore and started on the long crawl, straight
for the home river. The duck-bill was recaptured and
replaced in the lake, which, by the way, had no
banks into which it might burrow, but again it swam
out and made tracks for the old address. Eventu-
ally the beast was put far out in the water and left
to do its d —dest. A few days afterwards the platy-
pus was found dead in a patch of scrub about half
a mile distant from home, and in a direct line with
it.
* * * *
“E.” : If you go to Thistle, North-Eastern
District, Vic., 17 people out of the 18 adults now
inhabiting that depressed township will tell you the
story of Willie Lee’s courtship. Carrol, the 18th
adult, is deaf and dumb. Lee lived across the river
below Falls Bridge from Mrs. Chester, and was a
bachelor of long standing. When Chester died, and
left his widow 300 acres of river flats and all the
appliances and means of a farm in good going order,
Lee would appear to have begun to think that per-
haps, after all, “this here marriage life” had its
fascinations. At any rate, he got out his punt, armed
himself with rod and line and a can of angle-worms,
and went and fished up the reach almost under the
widow’s window, lie caught nothing on the first day,
not even a glance from the widow’s bright brown eye,
although it is possible she observed his employment
with some amazement from behind the parlor blind.
On the second day Lee fished as before, sitting with
exemplary patience, one eye fixed upon his floater,
the other eye, which had a slight swivel action,
rotating to some extent over and about the widow’s
pleasant property. This time Mrs. Lee drifted into
the garden and cut three roses; but it was not till
three weeks had passed that Mrs. Chester came to admit
that Lee was actually in evidence. “My gracious,
man,” she said, “whatever are you doing there?”
Lee looked up ; he drew in his hook and provided it
with a neat new worm. “Fishin’,” he said. “Well,
Willie Lee, all I can say is you must have precious
little to do.” “Oh, nothin’ in p’tickler, Mrs. Chester.”
“And you must have a strong prejudice against
fish.” “ ’Cause why ?” “Because nobody ever saw a
fish in that fork in 80 years.” “That isn’t to say
there ain’t good fishin’ here.” “It is to say you’re a
lazy, good-for-nothing lout, Willie Lee.” Mrs. Chester
flounced indoors. Willie Lee looked long and stead-
fastly at his float, broke into a faint smile, and said,
“Abusin’ a feller already!” Evidently Willie Lee
thought he was getting on. Presently he
said, “I got a bite,” and started drawing
in his line. His whole manner suddenly
changed, he uttered an oath eloquent of great amaze-
ment, and sat. staring, open-mouthed, grey-faced, in-
capable of further motion. Mrs. Chester had screamed
aloud, and, backing away, had fallen into a sitting
position, and she, too, stared with distended eyes,
her cheeks as white as paper. Lee had caught some-
thing. The object drawn to the surface on his hook
was the both’ of a drowned man. The next day was Sun-
day, and at three in the afternoon Willie Lee knocked
on Mrs. Chester’s front door. He was admitted to
the parlor. One minute he spent in minute exami-
nation of his hat, then he said: “I ’spect a matter
o’ three ’undred would do a lot o’ good on this farm,
Mary—ma’am?” “Well, and what of it?” “That body
I cot in the river yes’dec—it was Tommy Don’s!”
“Tommy Don’s!” Lee nodded. “There was three
’undred ’n’ fifty pounds on his head, Mary—ma’am;
dead or alive. They say he fell into the river when
drunk after stickin’ up Hyland's homestead.” “Three
’undred ’n’ fifty pounds on his head!” Mrs. Chester
moved closer up to AVillie and took his hand. “I'll
be in mortal terror of living here now—alone,” she
said. Willie smiled his slow smile and slipped an
arm about her waist.
“South Coast”: I appear on behalf of the
black-listed shag. It is true that he is a glutton
on fry of*valuable food-fishes; but he is also a terror
to the infantile lagoon-turtle, whose smellful
parents are themselves voracious and persistent
devourers of fish-spawn. It is probable, too, that
the pond snail —host of the liver-fluke —finds a grave
in the shag’s stomach. The lagoon-turtle is very com-
mon about South Coastal (N.S.W.) rivers, lagoons and
swamps, but also haunts inland rivers, etc., in warm
districts. So far as writer knows, he has never
yet crawled over the coast ranges to visit the
Monaro (N.S.W.) highlands. Perhaps it hasn’t
occurred to him. I’ve found him dead beside a
wire-netting fence he wanted to get through, and
have occasionally helped him over the stile, lie will
wander around an obstacle that he cannot surmount
for days—weeks, perhaps, and die in his tracks. He
never turns back —nor somersaults.
“J.E.D.”: Perhaps the reason why
“E.S.S.” (B. 7/11/’lB> has not seen a naked cocka-
too in its wild state is that as soon as cocky becomes
unable to fiy he becomes an easy victim to his
enemies. It is not uncommon to see wild cockatoos
with only about half their feathers left on, so it
seems reasonable to believe that they sometimes lose
the lot. On Thursday Island last year a very dilapi-
dated old fellow that I cut an acquaintance
with, was absolutely featherless. He had both
legs turned, so that his toes faced straight
inwards. Both wings and his beak were broken, and
he had the most vile flow of language that ever bird
was blessed with. Nobody ever acknowledged owner-
ship of him, and you could hardly blame them for
that. •
“D.F.”: The black trackers were set to
work about 1826 by Governor Brisbane. In an order
he observed:—
Officers are recommended to attach some of the
most intelligent of the Natives to their Parties, as
these People m&y lie made extremely useful, if
properly employed, in tracing the Bushrangers and
discovering their Haunts. It will be left to the
Discretion of the Officers to Reward the Natives
according to their exertions; for which purposes
some slop Clothing will be put at their Disposal and
they will be at Liberty from time to time to furnish
them with such Provisions as they may require when
employed/

“Silas Snell”: The old man tells me:
“Coinin’ down from the hills towards Cassilis, East
Gippsland, where we’d bin workin’ the most aggra
vatinist quartz leaders the Devil ever strung along a
range to delude pore blokes like me, we struck a
bullocky with a ten-head team of pitch-black cattle,
ploddin’ along in no sort of a ’ell of a hurry towards
nowhere. He had a biggish jinker behind, V nothin’
on it at all but what looked like a bit of a box
under a black blanket. I asked him was he lookin'
fer loadin’. Oh, no, nothink of the kind—he had his
load, ’n’ couldn’t take on no more. He wouldn’t even
lift our swags for us. We cursed him up and down
fer a unreasonable ’n’ cantankerous cow ’n’ passed on,
leavin’ him ploddin’ solemn ’n’ slow aside his bulls.
Never a curse had he give us back. About midnight
we’re shook up in camp by the arrival of the silent
bloke with his ten-cow team iv niggers. He’s travellin’
all night. Next day we get a lift on a ’awker’s waggon,
’n’ overtakes ole dummy monkey-face t'other side
Wells Bridge, lookin’ like the Dead March. He's
got a long black rag he’s picked up somewhere round
his ’at, and is evident well satisfied with hisself.
We’d reached the township, ’n’ had dinner ’n’ a
clean-up, ’n’ was airin’ our boots on the rail of
Maconochie’s pub vrander, when long comes the silent
bullocky, with his team iv ten blacks draggin’ their
slaverin muzzles in the dust. He answers nothin’ to
what we gives him, but procheses slowly by. A
coupler hours later, drawn be hints iv events, we
makes the township cemetery, ’n’ here’s his nibs
agin ’n’ his ten black bulls. But they’ve hoisted the
box off the jinker, ’n’ they’re lowerin’ it into a hole,
’n’ the bullocky is lookin’ at us that sad ’n’ reproach-
ful it ud break a cat's ’eart. Now, ’ow was we to
know it was a funeral ?”
NOTHING WRONG WITH TITS MEMORY.
THE STORMY MISSUS : “You brute; you seem to — boohoo —forget that I’m your wife.”
THE WEARY BOSS : “Appearances must be deceptive, then.”

THE MILL CAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sensuous shadows round us falling,
Fold the bush in long embraces:
Down the twilight ways enthralling
Night-winds seem like voices calling
Through the darkening forest places.
All the long day's toil completed,
Silenced is the saw-blade's screaming,
And around the camp-fire seated
Pipes are lighted, rest is greeted,
Now with song, and now with dreaming.
Soft chords of a banjo’s noting
Wake a deep-voiced old-time chorus,
While the_ mopoke’s weird throating
On the stilly night comes floating.
And the stars hang trembling o'er us.
Now one tells a bushman’s story,
Full of laughter, sport and roving—
How he won an axeman’s glory—
Or cracks a joke, antique and hoary
Heard in far-off days of droving.
Darker shadows round us falling
Hold the bush in night’s embraces,
And the soft wind's song enthralling
Seems a voice enchanted, calling
Up the jo3S of forest places.

a Cold, it is of the utmost importance that not only is the BEST
REMEDY taken immediately, but that the Remedy is one that
does NOT cause any Heart Depression, nor in any way weaken
an already frail constitution. In such a case, HEARNE’S Bronchitis

lift of great delicacy and beauty. This
description of Belgium would be hard to
beat:—- f
An inch of sword holding a foot of land;
A folk of men, showing a man for king.
Here again, is the story of the opening of.
the war as seen by the watcher in Australia:
Ah, the waiting, since the stroke
Of his foul conceiving broke
Through the crystal dome of sky
Where our Quiet hovered shy!
Here I sat and even here,
From my casement saw the dear,
Hesitating, virgin Spring,
Bridal-gauzy, visiting
Waters silken with delight,
Little happy beaches, white
Where her argent footprint fell ——
And the world drove fast on hell.
11l describing the “Doom” as it falls on the
Kaiser and his works, the verse has a fine,
stately movement; and the tense strain of
the hour is reflected admirably in the choice
of words. For instance :
A panic whisper round the galleries
Runs twittering; then the hush,
And in the dimmest nooks divining eyes
See blackness throng and crush.
A curious feature of the collection as a
whole is the exteiit to which Chris Brennan
speaks in the voice of John Milton. The
usual talk about “echoes,” which is the un-
failing mark of the critic who has nothing of
his own to say, will doubtless be heard ; hut
such talk is sheer praise. To imitate Milton
is as difficult a literary task as could be
undertaken ; and the fact that Brennan has
caught his very manner, even to his worst
faults, gives this book a unique interest.
Brennan will do bigger things than this. A
little slipshod in places, occasionally fum-
bling for expression, losing power by over-
crowding or choice of a long-discarded word,
Occasionally mistaking hysteria for strength
—these are the chief faults of the hook. But
the author, by careful study of technique,
can get over the passing phase of his develop-
ment and win back to the full, rich song
which once came to him by inspiration and
which must return as a settled habit. “The
Chant of Doom” will make a lot of Brennan’s
admirers angry; it should make them glad
for the new promise it reveals. The volume
is finely produced by Angus and Robertson
(Sydney) and contains an excellent portrait
of the author by Lionel Lindsay.
The Inky Way
“The Oldest Inhabitant’’: The Bend Do
Advertiser, which was established in 1853
and for more than half a century was in the
hands of the Mackay family, has been pur-
chased by the Bendigo Independent Proprie-
tary. .For many years George Mackay was
editor, Angus Mackay was manager, and
Rqbert Mackay was of the proprietary.
Angus Mackay, the son of Murdoch
Mackay (of the 78th Highlanders) and
Elizabeth McLeod, his wife, was born at
Aberdeen in 1824, and was brought to Syd-
ney by his parents when only three years
old. He was educated at the Australian Col-
lege (Dr. Lang’s), and was intended for the
Presbyterian Ministry, but became a school-
master, his residence being in a house on the
corner of Castlereagh and Campbell streets,
which later became the Golden Fleece Hotel.
He was a contributor to the Atlas and
the Australian Magazine. He became
editor of the Atlas, but gave up the job to
become manager of a business for Henry
Parkes, at Geelong. Later he returned to Syd-
ney, and became connected with the People’s
Advocate, went again to Victoria in 1853, and
in the following year joined in purchasing the
Bendigo Advertiser. He also fathered the
Riverina Herald. In February, 18(58, he
was returned to the Vic. Assembly as mem-
ber for Sandhurst, and in 1871 and in 1874
was again elected. At the general election,
May, 1877. he was defeated owing to his
support of James McCulloch ; but Blackham,
who had been elected, was unseated on peti-
tion, and Angus Mackay again got the seat.
In July, 1879, Mackay started the Sydney
Daily Telegraph newspaper on behalf of a
co., of which he was manager till February,
1883. In the office of the D.T. he left a
valuable file of the Atlas, marked in his
oivn handwriting, which, somehow, got out
of the Telegraph office, and was alleged to
be in the possession of the late John llenni-
ker Heaton in London. Mackay died on July
7, 188(5.
“Southern Cross”: I don't know the edi-
tor of-the School Magazine, issued by N. S.
Wales Education Department, but the follow-
ing description of a binghi after a cockatoo
for his supper (in November issue) is no
credit to him :
The kiley or boomerang quits his hand as if it
would strike the water, but when it has almost
touched the surface of the lake it spins upward.. ..
In vain the terrified cockatoos try to avoid it. It
sweeps wildly and uncertainly through the air, and
with fell swoop is in rapid pursuit of the terrified
birds, some of which are certain to be brought
screaming to the earth.
Several hundreds of thousands of youngsters
read this piffle, and no doubt believe it. My
one desire now is to get one of these patent
boomerangs and bring an editor screaming
to the earth.
Passed out at Albury, the other day, aged
S 3, George Adams, chief proprietor of the
Albury (N.S.W.) Banner. Emigrating from
the Cold Country at the age of 10 he was
employed first by the Melbourne Argus, and,
later, at Beechworth (Vic.), Albury and
Deniliquin. In the early ’sixties he pur-
chased the Banner, which was at that time
on the verge of bankruptcy. By changing it
from a bi-weekly to a weekly journal and
avoiding politics as far as possible he made
it into a flourishing concern. From a failure
it became what is perhaps the wealthiest
paper between Sydney and Melbourne. It
lias a circulation throughout Riverina and
the north-eastern district of Victoria. In the
Outback districts they call the paper the
“Cocky’s Bible.” Adams was an ardent Pro-
tectionist and a bitter enemy of the Labor
movement.
“R.S.”: Many Inky Wayfarers are sorry
to see Bendigo Advertiser pass into other
hands after a long and generous career. One
correspondent confides that it was not an in-
frequent experience for him to be told in a
gruff rebuke to “Wire it!” when he ’phoned
to tell his paper of a murder or political fire-
works display. The ’phone message, which
had to be paid for, anyhow, would cost Sd.,
while the wire (special operating official to
be paid for at the office after hours) cost Cs.
lOd.! Then, again, the linotypers who have
lost a billet were not blameless in “feeding”
the management up. Another correspondent
tells me of an occasion when, to save writ-
ing on a fresh sheet of paper, he turned the
tail of a word on to the margin for the
space of half an inch. Next mail brought a
courteous request that, since the linotypist
had lodged a complaint, would he please not
write on the margin !
“II.” : The Australian war-poet has arrived
at last, lie is Lance-corporal Cobber (at least
that is his pen-name), and he has produced
“The Anzacs’ Pilgrim’s Progress: Ballads
of Australia’s Army.” London Morning
Post welcomes his advent with a highly
laudatory column review: “A virile, rugged,
natural war-poet, without frills, fussiness or
literary prettiness, who precisely expresses
the fighting spirit of the Dominions. We
have been looking for him for the last three
years... .brother-in-art of Henry Lawson
and the other Australian realists.” The Morn-
ing Post considers his “Suez Scrap” the
best war ballad of its kind yet published, and
his tribute to General Birdwood, the com-
mander of the Australians, is announced to
be the finest paid to a born leader of men
since Kipling apostrophised “Bobs.”
Admiral Cyprian Bridge, who for a time
commanded on the Australian station, has
published a 12-shilling volume of recollec-
tions. He says he jotted them down pri-
marily for the entertainment of the members
of his own household. He joined the Navy
as far back as 1858 and had chats with Jack
Tars who remembered Nelson and fought
under him in the Napoleonic days. Bridge
mentions that in his early time at sea the
conditions were exceedingly primitive and
happy-go-lucky. An officer selected for a
command found an empty hull, no crew or
equipment or stores, and hoisted his pennant
on any chance pole. Short commons were
the rule, and officers had to provide many
necessaries out of their own pockets. His
experiences in Australian waters have given
him a profound admiration for the South
Sea yarns of Robert Louis Stevenson, which
he praised for their realistic power and
fidelity.
THE “PLUMED” KNIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Knight started out with high intent.
Ilis pen would be a lance,
Arid he a knight to circumvent
The ills of Arrogance,
And,,as in old romance,
From dragons scaly and uncouth
To rescue Innocence and Truth.
With epigram and subtle rhyme
He’d stab the tyrants prone.
And scathe the monsters of the time,
The serfs that Fraud may own,
Their king upon his throne.
To skulking Vice and foolish Sin
He’d let the light of Reason in.
He married (still with high intent),
And sundry children came,
And Knight wrote things to pay the rent,
His soul still held the same
High rev’rence for the game;
But Crime must bide while he may reel
Off wood and coal, or write a meal.
He hated Tyrannies, but these
Might still in purple reign
While he wrote lots of bread and cheese,
And boots, and dresses plain.
So many knights, who fain
Would right the great world where it rocks,
Are busy writing babies’ frocks !
VICTORIA.

A Satchel of Books
Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, by May Gibbs. (Sydney
Angus and Robertson). Here is a book full of joy
and rollicking entertainment for the kiddies. May
Gibbs has done it all, both pictures and story; and
done it in that charming fashion of hers which has
now become so well known. Gumnuts and blossoms
are the chief actors; but there are lots of other
creatures of the bush there, too, from the kookaburra
to the ’possum ; and they all convince to the last
feather or whisk of a tail. Very pleasant are the
fancies that crowd into every picture. The lizard
poses for the photographer; Mr. Frog ferries the
little boat called The Kurrajong over the river:
Snugglepot, on his prancing beetle, fights the Red
Gumnut, his lance padded with spider silk ; the cab-
stand is there with the line of waiting kangaroos;
the hatshop has a pool for a mirror, and choice
specimens of millinery' hanging on the twigs. The
book brings the bush very close and makes it into
a fairyland of true Australian pattern. Nothing
better to give the youngsters at Christmas.
Hymns of an Infidel, by Anticus (Adelaide). “Ridi-
cule is the antitode for Absurdity,” says the fore-
word. Somehow the scheme doesn’t seem to work.
The verses are tolerably absurd; but the antidote
isn’t handy.
The Solitary Pedestrian, by Joice M. Nankivell
(Australian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne). A small
book of Australian sketches simply and brightly-
written.
Lightning Sketches, bv Helen Simpson (Oxford;
B. H. Blackwell). Four little tales in dramatic form
that hold the interest and move brightly.
Alfred De Vigny, edited by E. Allison Peers
(Longmans, Green and Co., London). The French
text of the poems with a good introduction, notes,
bibliography and index. A useful book for students
of European poetry.
The Butterfly Man, by M. C. Oemler. (Angus
and Robertson, Sydney). If you want to read
a novel that is off the beaten track, written
with infinite skill and with a plot altogether unlike
any other, get this book. A crook saved by crookery
directed to noble human ends is one of those ideas
which link up with the notion of universal kinship
in a fashion which a Bolshevik must approve and
even a right-thinking person couldn’t fail to applaud.
Running through the book is a good love story ; and
the thread is held by a priest of the sort that all the
forces of ecclesiasticism can’t dehumanise.
The Unknown Anzac, by Victor Kennedy (Cam-
bridge Press, Bendigo). A booklet of verses which
the author wrote “for the mere pleasure of the
writing.” That statement looks old; the verses
themselves appear like the work of one who is still
very young. Everything turns on the rightness or
wrongness of that supposition. If the author is
very young they show good promise.
Business, Robbery, etc.
If the Government had not proposed
a bounty for the local production of
galvanised-iron, it would soon have to
gazette the substance as a precious metal.
Though the price has fallen a trifle since
the armistice, ordinary roofing-iron is about
500 or 600 per cent, in advance of pre-war
prices. The scarcity is largely responsible
for the present soaring cost, but a casual bit
of price-fixing by the Government has helped
to lighten the consumer’s pocket. Tudor
told in the House of Reps, last week how the
Win-the-War crowd had ukased the maximum
charge for new iron without troubling to
fasten down the price of second-hand
material. The consequence was that some
traders punched a few holes in their sheets
of fresh metal and were able to sell it
second-hand at a delirious profit. Those
brigands were more grasping than the philan-
thropists who are willing to exchange a new
jarrah fence for an old iron one, and hand
the owner a wad of cash into the bargain.
Lately, according further to Tudor, the
Frankston (Vic.) Racecourse had acquired
an unexpected bag of coin by selling their
iron fence for twice the price given for it 4U
years ago.
“Edo” : Let me warn intending travellers
on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway
to carry with them much extra cash. To
gain ordinary attention on the long journey
passengers must continually shell out tips.
The car-hands guilty of this buccaneering
are all members of a union, and receive fair
wages with free bed and board while on the
train. It’s saddening to see the independent
Australian degenerating into a scheming tip-
hunter.
* * * *
When coal-mining was getting a move
ou in N. S. Wales half a century
ago there was no Coal Mines Regu-
lation Act or union code to regulate the work-
ing conditions of the miners. Men started
and knocked off work when they liked, and
rarely saw the sun. When hard coal was
met with it was customary to make a hole
with a jumper (an iron bar about six feet
long, pointed at one end and chisel-shaped
at the other), and blast the coal down with
a coarse-grained powder called “black jack.”
On one occasion in Mt. Pleasant (South
Coast) two young inexperienced miners
were endeavoring to prepare a shot when old
Jack Madden happened along. Madden was
a shiftman, and had enough red hair on his
head, chest and limbs to stuff a couch. “Well,
bhoys,” was his greeting, “how are ye get-
tin’’ along?” “We’re trying to make ready
for a shot,” said one. Madden took in the
position at a glance. “Shtand back,” he
roared, “till I give her a lift!” It was not
long before he jumped a big hole into which
lie emptied two tins of black jack. Then, after
tamping up he withdrew the needle, inserted
the squib, and with his tallow lamp poised,
told the men if they valued their heads to
get as far around the turn as they could.
Madden then ignited the cotton-waste and
leaped down the heading, roaring, “Shtand
back let ye; shtand back! I’m tollin’ ye
there's enough powtlier in there to blow Hell
out be the roots!” A moment later there
was a deafening roar and rush of air that
put out every light in the pit (the area was
circumscribed in those days). Subsequent
inspection revealed that Madden had indeed
given the mine a lift, for the bord was
stowed out with coal, stone and splintered
timber.
* * * *
“Bill Badd” : I meet him every day. the
cheerful optimist who thinks that the end of
the war means cheap imported timber again.
Cheap timber from overseas is a thing of the
past, so we may as well look to our own
forests now. Many millions of feet of Baltic
timber were formerly cut in Norway.
Sweden and Russia at a labor cost of roughly
£1 a week per man. It never will be again;
costs will go up against the importer, and
there is nothing more certain than that he
isn’t going to be a loser. Timber is due to
rise within a wek or two. And that won’t
be the last lift, either.
* ■# * *
“Glen Huntly” : We have become used to
the insanitary banknote in place of the
shining Jimmy Goblin, and it looks as if we
may soon have to accustom ourselves to
scraps of paper instead of copper. A penny
is one of the things that Australia
cannot make, and the war has inter-
fered with the output at the other end,
while it has been interfered with some more
by the increased cost of living at this end.
Fourpenny beers, sevenpenny lunches and
eightpenny newspapers have placed a tre-
mendous strain upon available supplies of
copper coins, and the strain is being in-
creased now that the penny tax on 3d. and
6d. picture-show tickets has come into opera-
tion. For the first week after the arrival
of the tax Melbourne picture-showmen were
driven to the verge of baldness by the cursed
lack of pence, as not more than one patron
in 27 remembered the tax. everyone planking-
down a “zack” or a “bob” at the ticket-box.
which meant that always one, and in the
case of the cheaper seats, two, of the pre-
cious “browns” had to be handed out in
change. An enormous number of coppers go
into penny-in-the-slot gas-meters, which are
emptied only once a month, so that a large
proportion of the available and totally inad-
equate supply is permanently out of circula-
tion. In the current year the Commonwealth
issued £28.500 worth of imported copper
c0in5—4.564.800s —4.564.800 pennies and 4,574.000 ha’-
pennies ; but orders placed in India eight
months ago are still unfulfilled. A country
that can’t make a ha’penny for itself de-
serves to have to pay sixpence for its beer
owing to the lack of copper change.

The bottle-tree seems to offer material
for rope or binder-twine as good as
any we insist on importing. Fibre from the
bark can be turned into lengths tough
enough for average wants. The tree, which
grows freely in Bananaland, has got a good
leg in throughout the western plains of N. S.
Wales. It grows to about 12ft. in girth.
To date its commercial possibilities seem to
have been overlooked —probably because it's
Australian.

Eight Points of the “COLO” Tyre
(1) TREAD. presenting small sur-
face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE RUBBER.—Pure Rubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(5) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIE SPACE.
(/) SIDE WALLS.—Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a feAv months’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-
coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

“Smike” : The idea that the physical love-
liness of an actress should be productive of
added kindliness in a critic is impressed on
me forcibly by a recent event. A stage-
charmer happened to come under the
notice of a critic who, refusing to consider
beauty the outward symbol of genius, judged
her entirely on her theatrical merits and
lodged her politely among the second-raters.
This made the lady very dismal, and persons
who came within range of her tear-sodden
voice heard all about the cruelty of the
wretch who had hardened his heart to a
lovely vision. So much lias been said on
the subject that at present I am waiting to
see the trouble brought up in Parliament.
Certainly nothing less than Parliament will
be adequate to deal with the matter.

“II." from London :
Passed out, Eugene Stratton, most popular corner-
man of the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, who held
possession of St. James’s Hall, London, for up-
wards of half a century. Born at. Buffalo, U.S.A.,
he started at ten selling peanuts in the gallery of
the local Academy of Music. Taught himself danc-
ing-, singing and acrobatics, and thus qualified him-
self to join a circus at 15. After touring with
il all over the States he joined lfaverley’s Mastidon
Minstrels and accompanied them to London, where
he achieved such success and popularity that he
decided to remain there. As corner-man of the
Moore and Burgess Co. lie made a big hit with
the IVhistling Coon,” which he had to sing and
whistle thousands of times, lie married a daughter
of the head of the firm, George Washington Moore.
During recent years he took to the variety theatres,
where he starred with continued success in a series
of spectacular songs and dances provided specially
for him b.v composer Leslie Stuart: “The Lily of
Laguna,” “Little Dolly Daydream,” “The Coon

that paint to make it stick on? I

Drum-major,” etc. Stratton was a delightful dancer
in the soft and feathery style, and there was an
atmosphere of exceptional delicacy and refinement
about all his stage work. As one press admirer says, he
‘‘brought to his songs and dances a degree of inspira-
tion and poetic romantic fervor that was instant
in its appeal.”
There is talk about Dr. M. J. Ennis, Direc-
tor of the Adelaide Conservatorium, resign-
ing on account of the unsatisfactory state of
his health, after being connected with it (the
Conservatorium) since 1902. He was born
in Dover, studied music in .London, and
arrived in Australia in 1900. He achieved
the distinction of passing the examinations
for the degree of doctor in four consecutive
years at the London University.
“Harrison O.’s” statement
(U. 7/11/’IS) that Gwen Burroughs, properly
directed, might easily improve on Theda Bara
as a screen siren is disputed by “Andrew
Ralph” (B. 21/11/’IS), on the argu-
ment that all the coaching possible would
not give Gwen Theda’s “alluringly expres-
sive and darkly passionate eyes.” Well, if
Theda’s title to greatness rests entirely on
such a claim as that, she is a very careless
ladv in betraving the secret of it all so

recalled that from
1721 until 1894
this “National
Theatre” had the
J loyal privilege of
a military guard
consisting of six
men and a ser-
geant. They had
a well - appointed
guardroom of their
own on the first
floor* During per-
formances they
patrolled the front-
ages of the theatre
with fixed bay-
onets. The theatri-
cal management

in old, dimly-lighted London. The wonder
is that they survived to such a recent period
as 1594.
Harry Roberts’s prolonged absence from
the limelight is explained by some recent
heavy work in the movies. Roberts is pre-
paring a film of “Struck Oil” with himself
and Maggie Moore in the venerable roles of
Stofel and “Leetle Leezie,” and the film will
get a trial reel-off at an early date.
Daly’s Theatre, London, has been show-
ing a neat and attractive poster advt. for
“The Maid of the Mountains.” The lady
is shown on a lofty ladder, with “The Merry
Widow” opposite, on the 778th step, the
number of performances which the Wido\y
reached at the same house. The Maid
is shown steadily climbing, and at the begin-
ning of September stood on the 650th step.
At the rate of eight performances a week,
then being given, she should pass the Widow
just about Christmas.
“E.”: llow quickly a film becomes old-
fashioped. A large number of the picture
plays of the vintage of 1913 have been
turning up in the suburban houses lately,,
and they all have a fagged air and an aspect
of having escaped from the ark in the clothes
they stood up in. Nothing ages so quickly
as a film-play; nothing carries its age so
badly. Everything seems to give the show
away, especially hats, more especially
women’s hats. Possibly old films will have
an interest of their own when they are old
enough to be archaic, but so far old plays
of a serious character are only old enough
to be stale, faded, frumpy and foolish, and
the managements all make the same ridicu-
lous mistake—they try to ring them in as
new goods. You might as well try to pass
off a bovine skeleton for a good milch cow;
and if managements heard the expressions of
hatred and disgust their -ringing of the
changes inspires they would abandon the
customary imposition, realising that it is
better to turn business away than to kill it.
“Melb”: “Maritana,” as given by the
’Victorian Opera Co., at the Athenamm, is
the kind of rough production that delights
the bush; but it also delights the old-timers
m Melb. It is often said that Wallace
composed “Maritana” in Sydney. Not ex-
actly. This wondrous and copious sheaf of
ballads accumulated in his mind during his
travels, which extended to Maoriland, India
and North and South America. Doubtless
he published a good many. WAen he reached
London, after many years’ absence, Fitzball
had composed a libretto from the popular
drama “Don Cmsar de Bazam.” Wallace
superimposed the delicious patchwork of
“Maritana” upon this.

‘ E.H.P. : E. D. Haygarth, who died re-
cently at the age of 78 in Wanganui (M.L.).
claimed to be the oldest Australian actor
and the oldest M.L. actor-manager. He
was horq in Armagh, Ireland, on April
8, 1840, and reached Melbourne witli
his parents in 1855. In 1859 he
acted with Brooke. He was in the original
easts of. “The Colleen Bawn” and “The
Octoroon ’ at Melbourne Princess’s. At
.Dunedin Theatre Royal he played harlequin
in Clarence Holt’s panto. “Babes in the
Bonds’ (said to be the first panto, pro-
duced in Maoriland). This was in the early
sixties. In February, 1804, Haygnrtii
opened the Royal at Invercargill—the first
theatre there.
“Auss.” : It occurred some years back, at
Bendigo, where Cole’s Bohemians were dis-
pensing the local brand of Dick Turpin
drama with the aid of a large marquee and
very cheap rates. The villain’s part included
the annihilation of the heroine's brother
I Ins event being the cue for the hero to
arrive opportunely and join in tin- argument
1 (jinting his stage-gun at his prospective
victim, the wretch pulled the trigger, hut no
report followed. \\ ith the coolness of a
veteran, he replaced the pistol, produced a
pocket-knife, and, shouting out that stab-
bing was better, proceeded with the messy
slaughter. At this stage, the hero arrived
with an impetus suggestive of a 14-stone
prompter. Assuming a listening attitude in
the centre of the stage, he sent all hands
home happy by remarking aloud, “Methinks
I heard a pistol-shot.”
THE ACTOR'S MODEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M. B. Figman, the American comedian, tells
Melbourne Argus that actors ami actresses should
study from the living: model. “I established and
conducted a life-class in the American Academy of
Dramatic Art.”
The actor who would climb Fame’s tree
And reach the higher branches
Must study up humanity
In cities, ships and ranches,
lie’ll be no shakes if lie’s content
His laziness to coddle.
When Hamlet he would represent
He’ll study Ham’s quaint temperament,
And from the living model!
If Borneo lie has to do
Your conscientious man’ll
Go catch a youthful Montague*
And pin him to a panel.
Thou watch him wriggle arid acclaim,
And ape his tricks with vigor.
If great Othello is his game
He’ll naturally do the same
With some peculiar nigger.
This method must necessitate
The use of many tractors,
And trains and ships of heavy freight
In moving leading actors
And all their models; so the mime
Will still seek such instruction
His mirror in, and every time
Give of his model a sublime
And perfect reproduction.

HALF-YEARLY REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE BANK OF AUSTRALASIA
With the Accounts.for the Half-year to 156 h April, 1918.
Presented to the Proprietors at the Half-yearly General Meeting, held on Thursday, 3rd October, 1918.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at 15th April last, with the Profit
Account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and Aus-
tralasian rates and taxes, and for a Bonus to the Staff, and after making provision for bad and doubtful
debts and other contingencies, the net profit for the half-year amounted to £212,827/1/5.
To this sum must be added £123,309/6/10, brought forward from the previous half-year, making a
total of £336,136/8/3, out of which the Directors have declared a dividend for the half-year at the rate
of 14 per cent, per annum, or £2/16/- per share, and a bonus at the rate of 3 per cent, per aiinum, or
12/- per share, together £3/8/- per share, free of income-tax.
The Dividend and Bonus will absorb £170,000, and the Directors have further appropriated £40,009
to the Reserve Fund. There will then remain £126,136/8/3 to be carried forward to the next account.
The Dividend and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on the 4th October.
The Directors have to record, with much regret, the death of the Karl of Lichfield, who had been a
valued member of. the Board for more than 30 years.
The sphere of the Bank’s operations is restricted by the Charter to certain geographical limits. The
Directors are of opinion that the time has arrived when this restriction should be removed or modified,
and they will seek the sanction of the Proprietors to apply to the Government to alter the Charter in this
respect. An Extraordinary General Meeting has been called, at which the Proprietors will be asked to
sanction the application referred to.
At the same meeting resolutions will be proposed
(a) To substitute one General Meeting annually in place of the two meetings now held in terms of
the Deed of Settlement, in order to conform to the general practice now prevailing.
(b) To increase the amount divisible among the Directors by £2OOO a year, free of tax, or such
sum as the Proprietors may determine.
Owing to depletion of staff, the Bank's Branches at Mangonui and Whangamomona, in New Zealand,
have been closed. C. G. HAMILTON, Chairman.

This co.’s capital is a trifling £B5OO, and its
reserves £14,008. It does not go in for finan-
cing its customers to any extent, though the
amounts owing at September 50 (£48,0001
were more than usual. <*f course the co. s
funds are ins lflicient to even carry these
advanc'3, and apparently it prefers to go
outside for the' greater proportion of the
money. Thus at Sentember 50 bank over-
draft amounted to £20,155, while other lia-
bilities were £10.751. The co. is co-opera-
tive in character, and apparently devotes
practically all of its energies lo commission
agerifcy business. Wool has been fetching
splendid prices, and naturally earnings have
shown big increases. Hut exes, have also
grown rapidly:—•

While the 25 p.c. div. looks very fine, after
all it i crnia! to not quite 10 p.c. on the
total shareholders' funds. I’ossibly the co.
could do better by getting in more capital
and financing the whole of its operations
with its own money. That, however, is
purely a matter of policy, and seemingly the
co. wishes to restrict its pastoral financing.
Premises, property, sale-yards and plant now
stand in the books at £11,521, and the
surplus of assets other than the above fixed
assets over liabilities at September 30 was
£15,818. compared with £9977 in 1915. Pro*
vided advances are fully protected against
losses and ample allowance has been made
to cover depreciat.on, the co. is about £3OOO
better / ff than it was three years ago after
returning in divs. an amount equal to , three-
quarters of the capital.
Metallurgist A. W. Dye discusses plati-
num :
“Wild Cat." (B; 17/lb/TS) refers to tlie troubles
of the platinum-getters of the Kifteld district
(N.S.W.). back of constant water-supply has
always been a hindrance to developments of
platinum-mining in the Fifield district, but the
miners should not blame the English firm referred
to for the position in which they find themselves.
It is only in the last few years that any progress
in the matter of the recovery of platinum in Aus-
tralia has been made. Jewellers and dentists will
readily agree that some years ago no buyers of plat-
inum metals or scrap were trading here, and at the
present time none of the large concerns such as the
Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Co. Ltd., Broken
Hill Proprietary Ltd., or Sulphide Corporation Ltd.,
will buy materials containing platinum, and if the
latter metal is contained in gold and silver residues,
none of the above concerns will pay for platinum
even if present to the value of, say, £2OO in a £5OO
parcel. The same applies to the Australian branches
of the Royal Mint, where all gold or silver bullion
containing platinum is rejected, that is, if the
presence of the latter is detected.
By the introduction of electrolytic methods of
refining, the Hamburg Mint (Germany) found that
gold from practically all parts of the world con-
tained sufficient platinum not only to cover the costs
of electrolytic refining but to leave a handsome
surplus. This has been confirmed in the Govern-
ment refineries in New York and at some of the big
English refineries, where the electrolytic process is
now extensively used. Until recently native
platinum had not been refined in Australia, but
there are now two or three houses refining this
product with more or less success.
Practically all the Australian requirements of
platinum were obtained from Britain prior to the
war, but the majority is now produced locally, and
not from Fifield platinum but largely from
the platinum recovered from false teeth. Due
to lack of purchasers in the past, huge quan-
tities of old teeth, each of which contain
two platinum pins approximating a grain of
platinum worth, say, 9d., have accumulated.
The prices ruling for manufactured platinum in
Sydney vary from £l9 to £23 per ounce at
present, according to quantity or requirement;
therefore, based on local rates, the price paid
to the Fifield miners is not altogether an unfair
one, when the highly-refractorv nature of their pro-
duct is considered. The quality of the material produced
varies, and in my experience has been as low as
65 p.c. and as high as, say, 80 p.c. No
sample of Fifield material yet handled in my works
has exceeded 82 p.c. of platinum, and many contain
much visible silica. The following is a typical
assay report: Platinum, 73.8 p.c.; iridium, 2.4 p.c.;
osmiridium, 4.3 p,c.—total, 80.5 p.c.
Regarding the non-payment for osmiridium, this
touches on more or less technical ground. The
osmiridium contained in Fifield native platinum
cannot be recovered or handled in a form of com-
mercial utility, as can the native osmiridium of
Tasmania. The latter product is used, in the form
in which it is mined, for tipping, so-called iridium-
pointed pens, being merely graded on sieves for this
purpose. The osmiridium in the Fifield product, how-
ever, can only be recovered in the form of a com-
paratively useless black powder, which may
subsequently be separated into the constituent metals
of osmium and iridium.
Some time ago osmium was of great commercial
utility in many forms of electrical work, but of later
years it has fallen into disuse, and firms handling
the platinum group metals are confronted with ever-
increasing stocks of this metal. Due to the highly-
volatile nature of its compounds under the influence
of heat, etc., osmium cannot be used for many of
the purposes to which platinum, palladium and other
metals of the platinum group are put, such as the
platinising and palladinising of asbestos in the newer
methods of sulphuric and nitric-acid production, and
for which huge quantities are now used.
■ If the foregoing were thoroughly understood, the
Fifield miners would, perhaps, be more content with
the prices received by them from recognised bullion
houses for their product, which is, as has already
been pointed out, only 70 p.c. to 80 p.c. fine, the
balance being material of little commercial value.

various sizes. Great quantities are regu-
larly discarded as not being up to the
Beale standard. Not only must our veneers
be right in quality, but the graining must
be well marked. This making of veneer
shows how thorough is the determination
of the Beale organization to thoroughly
control all processes which can affect the
quality of thei?" instrument.
This illustration shows
a vertical saw which
is used for breaking
down the huge logs
into “flitches” and
’slabs” of workable
size. These are further
cut up into boards and
planks by our large
circular saws or cut
into veneers by the
veneer-machine.
Every log is carefully
chosen with the idea
as to its ultimate use.
Every Beale Piano is
guaranteed in writing
for twenty five years.
This is just about twice
as long as most makers
guarantee their instru-
ments. It is a“worth-
while”guarantee, too.
The Beale Organi-
sation is here in
Australia, where it
can be called upon to
make good. , The
guarantee of a maker
15,000 miles away is
pretty hard to enforce.

Bushmen, “The” Watch.
The Super “Fx and R” Watch has no equal for
hard bush wear. With 80 years of experience we
KNOW this. What a watch it is! Every improve-
ment. known to horological science is in it. It is
specially made for us for Australian hard-wear con-
ditions. Knowledge, effort, money unstinted have
been used to produce a watch that a man can set at
standard time, and go with it into the bush for six
months, and return to find his watch on time.
All needed is that it be wound. Jewelled where
wear occurs, we guarantee it for 15 years and keep
it in order free for 12 months, breakages excepted.
The price is not low (63/-, in a steel ease), but
what really first-class tested mechanism is? But the
value is there, and more. The watch will give
PERFECT results for 25 years.

Heart of Empire Series, No. 4.
Westminster Abbey
founded by, Edward the Con-
fessor about 1050 and’ rebu It
by Henry 111., though only the
beautiful King Edward Chapel,
the Choir, Chapter House, the
Crypt remain of his work.
Henry VII. made some notable
additions, including his famous
Chapel, a perfect specimen of
the skill of mediaeval architects.
All our kings, from Harold and
William 1., were crowned in the
Abbey, and many
are buried there,
together with
poets, statesmen,
and heroes.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY is a most beautiful and complete link with the glorious
past, round which most great events in England’s history have centred, and it is
fitting that every approach, whether from the Embankment, stately Whitehall,
Old Palace Yard, or Victoria Street, is through broad and spacious thoroughfares,
excellent for vehicular traffic and delightful for motoring.
But for all roads the tyres should be Avons, which are built for speed, resiliency and
durability.
Fit British AVON Tyres—Seven types to choose from:
a weight for every load and a tread for every road\

Appropriately enough the gold railway-
pass worn by Gardiner, who has established
an Australian record by talking in the Sen-
ate continuously for 11 hours 10 minutes,
was originally issued to “Jawbone” Neild.
Ruled by S.A. Speaker Coneybeer that it
is quite unparliamentary for a member of
the Assembly to address another as “old
chap.” On the other hand, Butterfield spoke
of Billy Hughes as “the penny-dreadful re-
presenting Australia,” without rebuke except
a casual one from Premier Peake.
“Vic” : The Dudleys’ legal outing is danger-
ous in the present state of the public temper.
Millions of struggling Britons must now be
asking where Dudley gets all his money from
and what right he has to it. This kind of
query will abound during the coming English
general election in December. The wife of a
lord who can’t struggle along on £9OOO a
year and a husband who can afford to throw
in another £lOOO for pin-money are likely to
notice the baleful eye of a Bolshevik fixed
upon them in a contemplative manner.
“D.” : What became of the grand artistic
competition for the mural decorations for
Australia House? The scheme was pro-
pounded just before the German measles
eventuated in a violent eruption, and every
considerable artist I know got down to work
on it. Some of them put in quite a lot of
hard thinking and arduous labor before the
arrival of the official announcement sus-
pending the piecework till after hostilities.
Now we are given to understand that Aus-
tralia House is a finished product, and all
the mural decorations are in position, having
been provided by some person or persons
unknown. Nothing more appears to have
been heard of the grand allegories that were
to decorate ceilings and walls, and a number
of remorseful Australian artists are left with
considerable designs on their hands for which
they can have no further use.
“G. Arden Ilill”: It was customary in the
Postal Department some years ago for
stations to let each other know the where-
abouts of the inspector when he was in the
district. On one occasion the operator at X
called up Z and asked him if old Froggabolla
had been mooning about there yet. “No,”
said Z, “we expected the old scratcher to poke
his nose in to-day, but he hasn’t come to light
yet. Perhaps the old soak’s drunk again.”
Then circuit was opened at an intermediate
station and the sounders clicked out: “In-
spector —; — is at present at Y. and in good
health ; he will call on you two officers in the
course of a day or two.” I was the operator
at Y at the time and noticed a twinkle in old
Froggabolla’s eyes as he closed the key.
S. M. Herald, in an article called
“Taxation and Economy,” dealt with the
efforts made by other countries, in the way of
self-denial and extra hard work and extra-
ingenuity, to meet war demands, and asked
blandly: “Why have we no national move-
ments of the kind in Australia?” The reason
is one that the Herald would probably rather
die than mention. It is that the loan policy
and the importing policy preached by the
Herald and its kind have educated the people
in the moral dry-rot of the old French
nobility. It used, in the fiction, at least, of
pre-Revolution days, to take three large,
strong men—often foreigners from Switzer-
land—walking in a flunkey procession, to
bring a really high-class French nobleman his
morning chocolate. It took about 223 big
foreigners to bring a very ordinary Australian
Woman her breakfast in the pre-war days, for
the tablecloth was imported, and practically
all the dishes, and the cutlery, and the
flower vase, and the bread platter, and the
pepper and mustard, and often the salt, also
the toast-rack —in fact, everything except the
bread and the meat, and sometimes there was
imported tinned fish instead of meat. The
pickles were often imported. Sometimes the
table and chairs were imported. These
persons and their kind had learned in
the school of the S. M. Herald to be just as
parasitic as the French nobleman of bygone
days who required three flunkeys to bring
him his morning meal. The answer to the
S. M. Herald’s question is fairly simple,
though the S. M. Herald is the last paper
that is likely to supply the answer.
“Henry Ilorsecollar’s” letter:—
Recently a clinic for the treatment of venereal
disease was opened in Melbourne, and when 800
patients promptly eventuated the Health authori-
ties decided that they had struck a prosperous line
of business and arranged for much larger premises.
I haven’t been following the record very closely, but
I presume the industry is doing well in the larger
premises. Every year this subject becomes of
greater importance. Science is getting to the
conclusion that the great bulk of crime is done by
persons of deficient intelligence—to say nothing of
a vast amount of waste, folly and unpleasantness
which isn’t exactly crime. Persons of deficient in-
telligence are carefully classified. There is the
absolute idiot who never develops—who was born
without intelligence like other people and remained
that way. The imbecile develops till the age of
three or four and then stops. Other types cease
their mental growth at 12 or 14 or 18. The 14-to-
-18 variety is the most dangerous, for he leaves off
improving when the sexual and fighting instincts are
already in full force. Bushrangers, dangerous hood-
lums and men who surreptitiously bury their wives
are largely of this class, and they are a particular
evil because they are sufficiently advanced to look
like ordinary marriageable individuals if they marry
young. The bridegroom of 30 with the brain of 17
may be so conspicuous as to attract notice, but the
bridegroom of 21 with the brain of 17 isn’t.
Among imbeciles certain medical authorities declare
that fully 65 per cent, have inherited a syphilitic taint
so distinctly as to put the matter beyond question.
As to other persons of arrested development the
taint is believed to be generally present in a milder
form —in other words the diseased ancestor was a
generation further back or wasn’t quite so bad an
ancestor.
The worst evil which afflicts the human race can
only be dealt with by rigid supervision, whether
vice is thereby “recognised” or not; by the compul-
sory treatment of sufferers; and by taking really
effective precautions against the transmission of the
evil to new generations. In short, the matter should
be dealt with in almost any way that the cleric
who specialises in these matters disapproves of. And
if he disapproves too loudly he should be suppressed
as an ordinary, unlicensed medical practitioner. A
cleric who can show a medical diploma has the same
standing in the matter as any other doctor. The
one who says he gets his medical knowledge from
On High, when every careful student of the Scripture
knows that he doesn’t, has merely the standing of a
quack and an intolerant, self-important one at that.

The American-Australian League’s big
stall in Moore-street (Mrs. .T. Brittain,
president) was the Mecca of women buyers
on each of the Days whereon TJ.S. and
Australian M-omen have proved their devo-
tion to our soldiers. Exquisite needlework
and lavish gifts from the League M-orkers
were, as usual, surrounded bv earnest
searchers for bargains on War Chest Day.
From ’Frisco came by last mail some deco-

At the next N. S. Wales Horticultural
Society’s slum- one familiar figure will |>p
absent. That’s Ilenr.v 11. Burton Bradley,
aged 7.'!. who died on November 23. He was
one of this State’s oldest and most enthusi-
astic amateur gardeners. For many years
his white whiskers. M-liich. like his great
daffodils, M-ere a prolific groM-th. have waved
over the busy nib of the lion, sec.’s end of

After two years duty as V.A.D. in a
Leicester military hospital, one of the huge
havens for wounded soldiers which have
sprung up like mustard-cress since the war.
a cable flashes the sad news of Adele Bren-
nan’s death. Influenza vffas the cause. The
handsome Sydney girl, a fine swimmer, ten-
nis player and good all-round sport, was on
the face of her the last likely to succumb
to any malady. She had a magnificent
physique and the buoyant spirits of perfect
health brought her happily through heavy
hospital M-ork since 191(5. When the Red
Cross called for voluntary aids to pay

Every other woman has cast longing eyes
for many weeks at Mrs: Kelso King's gift
to Jack’s Day assets. £lOO worth of house-
hold linen in a handsome cupboard of
Queensland maple M-as the bait. Tickets at
2s. (id. M’ent off by the thousand, and the
record sum for this treasure of £5lll flowed
in a steady stream, of halfrcroM'ns even
fiom the Pacific Isles and the lone outposts
of iliv Never Never country. General Finn

official draMMilg in St. James's Hall the
other morning. Three sacks of tickets M-ere
stuffed into a cavernous barrel. which was
vigorously turned to mix well. Then volun-
teers M-ere called for. \vith narrou: sleeves, to
dip their hands in and take at random 20
tickets to bo put in a small barrel. These
again M-ere tossed like pancakes, and an-
other volunteer- - a boy—picked out the fate-
ful ticket, M-hidi M-as to make somebody the
envy of hoi- neighbors.. It was No. 200; and
that's all anybody but the lucky winner
knows of tbe linen-owner’s identity. To
Paris House after this performance Mr. and
Mrs. Kelso King took a party of guests.
The Queen's Club, most exclusive of
women’s bridge and food menageries in this

is the anti-climax to
staccato cries of joy
from the disciples of
iris. The man re-
sponsible. parks su-
perintendent Geo. \Y.
Cooper (here is
Jud i t h Fletcher's
photo of lam), has a
reply ready. “iVe are
not going to interfere
with the avenue that
runs through the centre of both these parks
—from Queen’s-square to Liverpool-street—
but we are going to reduce, in other places,
the heavy-feeding Moreton Bay fig to make
l oom for the more beautiful and umbrageous
Port Jackson fig. The latter lives and lets
live; the former u-ants the earth!” An
ardent disciple of Australian horticulture,
and one of the few leading landscape gar-
deners in the Commonwealth, superintendent
Cooper m;is appointed by the City Council
about 17 months ago. He was born in Mel-
bourne. and bis father and grandfather were
professional gardeners. At 12 he started
with the drudgery of being handy boy in
training under his father. At 20 he got the
job of assistant landscape-gardener to help
carry out the work which has made Alexan-
dra Avenue and Gardens (Melbourne) so
often quoted as instances of what can be
achieved when Art picks up a spade. His
chief, the late Carlo Catani, who taught and
showed the M-ay for 17 years, was a noted
landscape-gardener to whom Melbourne owes
much of its decorative velvet laM-ns and
shrubs. Of another good man. the late IV.
R. Guilfoyle (formerly of Double Bay, Syd-
ney), Cooper, M'lio served under him in Vic-
toria, is equally enthusiastic. At 38 in the
prime of life', and effervescing with the joy
of transforming the dreary, bald places in
Hyde Park into grassy hillocks, the new
superintendent is digging out the heavy clay
bed which has been Hyde Park’s old menace.
Trenches —it has gone untrenched all these
years—-and suitable soil will in due course
grow all the most beautiful native shade
trees in the State, amongst others the
ethereal jacaranda. the silky oak. the M-attle
and the finest of the floM-ering eucalypts. In
a few years the city’s lungs will be the pride
of Sydney. It takes time, but Geo. W.
Cooper promises results that will surprise
even the optimists.
Leah Meyers (Mrs.
Fred Russell) is still
in her early twenties.
She began to warble
in public nearly 10
years ago. At an
age usually devoted
to chocolate creams
the youthful Leah's
SM-eet. bird-like chir-
rup was frequently
uplifted on man y
local concert plat-
forms. Matrimony
temporarily inter-
rupted a career. But.
With the songster's
instinct for study,
the Sydney mezzo-
soprano (a brilliant
pianist, by the way.
thanks to tier old music master, the late
Josef Ivretschmann) has recently spent two
years working at French and Italian opera
under Albert Goossens at the Cohserya-
torium. Last Meek she tried out her voice
at her concert in the King’s Hall. Looking
like a snow-white powder-puli', she .sang her
best, and M-as rewarded with trophies of
blooms. This smiling young artist (photo
by Judith Fletcher) has just been engaged
for a season of grand opera in Melbourne.
Dead at Suva from the dread pneumonia
trouble, Mrs. Tom Dalton, of North Sydney,
wife of the head of the big firm of Dalton
Bros. On account of his extensive good
works, especially his .endowments to Lew-
isham Hospital, lie M-as made some years
ago a Knight of St. Gregory, which entitles
him to he called “Sir Thomas” in R.C.
circles. The title has about the.same signifi-
cance as a “Birthday” one. and is equally
valueless. When Apostolic-Delegate Cerretti
arrived here he M-as immediately taken in
hand by the Daltons and entertained lavishly,
a thing that Cerretti appreciated muchly.
The tangible result showed in Mrs. Dal-
ton being made a Dame of the Holy
Sepulchre. This is an ancient and disused
institution from the days of Pope Alexander
VI. The significance lies in the tremendous
pull Cerretti has in Rome to be able to secure
the title 1 for a mere "Mrs.” There are only
three other “Dames.” amongst them a
marchioness. Big, handsome and singularly
gentle. Mrs. Dalton's place in the charity life
of Sydney will be hard to fill.
Dead, as the result of a fall from a faulty
horse, at IS, Marjorie Coghlan. eldest daugh-
ter of Tim Ooghlan. ex-X.S.W. Government
Statistician and ex-Agent-General. Nowa-
days dad. who married one of the Western
District Donnelly girls, looks after big in-
terests in London—-mostly the mining specs,
promoted by brother Cecil out here. Barri-
ster Charlie is another brother, while Iza,
sister, at present examining schools for the
Education Department, was one of the first
lady medicoes to hang out her sign in
Sydney.

Militia men are pulling up their tent-
pegs at Liverpool camp. Amongst those
mJio will be the last to leave is the popular
Commandant Colonel Lamrock, G. 8., who
wears the magic A. A keen gardener, it’s
mainly due to his efforts that the flower-bed
enclosure in camp lias been a lovely oasis in
a brown field of khaki.
If one V.A.D. girl in the Lane Cove River
division is feeling more proud than another
it’s little Joyce Kettlewell. Her young man.
Lieut. Cameron Sharp, of S. Australia, re-
cently mentioned casually in a letter (he
forgot to say anything about it for some
time) that the M.C. has come his way. He
is one of the original Anzacs, who linked up
with the Light Horse in August. 1914. but
didn’t embark till early in 1915. Born under
a lucky star, he missed the Turkish missiles
right through Gallipoli, but has been
wounded several times in Palestine. He M-as
at x\leppo a feM- weeks ago.
Last week’s big batch of Anzacs had a dizzy
time amongst the youngsters. N. 8. Wales
State-school kiddies, M-ho have Morked like
the best to help the war funds, assembled
in all the M-ell-,starched majesty of white
muslins and hair-bows, or the knickers of
the cheering small boy, to greet the
heroes. In theory it M*as a Tom-ii
Hall concert, and the young voices
sang lustily in chorus, but the waving
of tiny flags and the gleeful hails of the
youngsters in the audience made any pause
in the programme a joyous tumult. In
the same week the Old Originals, M-earing
the little red, white and blue rosettes on
their sleeves, were motored to various
schools in which they had themselves once
tackled the three Rs. And again there was
a great and rowdy welcome.
A recent marriage at Rose Bav. celebrated
by Archdeacon D’Aicy Irvine, recalls a
romance of Norfolk Island. The contracting
paities Mere Miss l)e \ ere, only daughter of
the Hon. Edmond Aubrey Templar Pery, and
Hugh Harold (late A.1.E.). youngest son of
Fredenok lleatheote, of London. In the time
of Governor Bourke ( ISBI to 1837) W. 11.
Pery was a clerk in the Sydney General Post
Office, with lodgings in Elizabeth-street. H«
M-as a grandson and heir-presumptive to the
second Earl of Limerick. The Governor, a
Limerick man. ivas asked to find some em-
ployment for the youth and to keep a tight
rein upon him. as be was somewhat ‘wild."
When Major Anderson arrived with the 30th
Regiment, and was appointed commandant at
Norfolk Island. Bourke sent Perv with him
as clerk. Anderson gave Pery an invitation
to stay tit Government House on the island
—<i very comfortable home, by all accounts
until arrangements could be made for him
at the regimental officers' mess. Amongst
the officers of tin* 3<)th was Lieut. William
Sheaffe. Who had his family with him. Young
Pery married a daughter in 1838, and the
lady died in 1841. There M-as one son by
this marriage—William Hale John Charles
Pery—who was born on Norfolk Island in
January. 1849. The widower made a second
venture in 1842. when' he wedded—in Syd-
ney. presumably— ti daughter of Captain
Nicholas Horsley, of the o(>th Regt. This
lady got a_ judicial separation in 1803, and
died in 18(5. By the second marriage Pery
had six sons, of whom the father of the
bride, for many years employed in the N. S.
Wales Justice Department, is one. The
child born on the island came into the title
and estates, but could not take his seat in the
House of Lords without producing a certifi-
cate of birth. The Colonial <)ffice wits appealed
to. and a search revealed that tin- original re-
gisters had been lost, but that 11. Kerrison
James, who had been a clerk in the Bishop’s
office in Sydney, had a copy of all the Angli-
can registers, and on affidavit the august
personage was allowed to take his sent. Good-
ness knows what he did after that.
“The Charm of Sydney,” with delightful
sketches by Syd l re Smith, and letterpress
chosen by Bertram Stevens from our best-
known writers, is on the market for 'Christ-
mas. Yet it’s not so many years ago since
even our season’s greetings disguised in snow-
storms studded with holly-berries, were the
correct form of saying “Merry Christmas” in
surfing Australia.
Mrs. T. 11. Kelly will be among the first
flitters to the old world now that the war

made free of ocean travel. She will take her
eldest boy to Eton, where he will learn all
about Australia.

Lady Helen had a party on Thursday
afternoon for army nurses returned from
active service. The day wa\ stormy, with
showers, so the party was shepherded to
the sheltered private gardens at the side of
Government House, where there were
verandahs and morning-rooms to cower in
when the rain pelted down. Lady Helen,
in black, wore a Paddy-green feather in her
hat; and niece Doris Blackwood helped with
the tea in a dove-grey frock —that is, Doifs
was in a dove-grey frock. Well-cooked
food and blue larkspur in gold baskets were
spread on buffets in the State dining-room,
and music was free for all in the drawing-
room. The Creswell and Monash dames,
Mrs. Landale, Mrs. Pearce and Mrs. Sell-
heiin were among the guests.
Society, etc., is still simmering over a
bit of excitement at a smart dance. A
man touched a young matron on the
shoulder, and claimed the “next dance” in a
free-and-easy way. The lady’s husband,
just returned from the Front, wanted that
dance himself, and also expressed his dis-
approval of the cavalier method of the
other’s way of asking. The matter was
settled by a couple of rounds in the moon-
light. It gave the otherwise tame function
a strong sporting interest.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen go each Sun-
day to the kirk, and sit —one at each end-
of the big pew in Scots’, with plenty of
space between for members of the house-
hold, who rarely appear.
The Blackwood children, now at Federal
Government House, are to return to Eng-
land and mother at the end of January.
The Dalrymples are very proud of their
aviator son. He lately conveyed the Prince
of Wales somewhere toward the Italian lines
in his ’bus —and you have to be in the A 3,
class of fliers before you get a job like that.
Chaplain Smith Macßain, of the A.1.F.,
now thinking of a trip back to Australia
after a long term abroad, had a ministry at
Queenscliff when the war started. He left
it presently to take a temporary job with the
foi’ces, but sent his resignation back to the
home flock when he saw what things were
like overseas, and decided to stick it out with
the boys as long as permitted. He is a
nephew of the late James Macßain, who wgs
a prominent and unusually respectable figure
in Victorian pre-“Boom” politics. The old
man, who had no children of his own, re-
garded Australia enthusiastically as a land
of promise, and therefore imported several
nieces and nephews from his native Scot-
land. Smith Macßain w r as one of them, and
he married a daughter of the late Henry
Wrixon, President of the Vic. Leg. Council
for many a long, dreary year. Through this
union he became a grandson-in-law of the late
Henry (“Money”) Miller.
Pearce’s department can always be relied
upon when it comes to really big things.
The other day it issued an order that all
men of the sea transport service who are
being demobilised must hand in three pairs
of socks, or the cost would be deducted from
their stipends. Many of the., men who are
being discharged have been in training for
six months, and the much-darned hosiery
now in their possession would be rejected
with scorn by a self-respecting deadbeat.
The things could not with decency be re-
issued, even for the purpose of warming the
feet of eligibles at the Victoria Barracks,
and Pearce should be urged to find some
genuine work for the Old Sock Squad.
It seemed inevitable that Armageddon
should produce stories similar to Tennyson’s
“Enoch Arden.” One comes to hand from
Shepparton. A Billjim having been offi-
cially reported killed, the girl who reckoned
she was his widow re-married, and has now
learned that Billjim. who had been a
prisoner of war, is on his way home.
Lieut. Thorold Waters, once of Sydney
D.T. and Melb. Age, is now assistant-garri-
son-adjutant at one of the largest military
depots in Egypt.
Major “Wally” Conder, the sporty bache-
lor C.O. of Langwarrin military camp, has
been appointed, to a position on the quaran-
tine staff. A Tasmanian by birth and a
schoolmaster by profession, he has a non-
serviceable right arm as a memento of
Gallipoli.
The Niagara is carrying to America many
anxious wives going to meet soldier hus-
bands. Amongst them is Mrs. Jim Burns.
Mrs. Chandler (once Jean Ross Munro, of
Bananaland) is also aboai’d. She hopes her
soldier will greet her at Honolulu.
Mrs. Cumming and a daughter are on the
way to America to join daughters Dorothy
and Rose. Dorothy is playing a good part
in a Belasco production, and Rose is secre-
tary to some ambassador or other.
The death of young Dr. Roy Lister in
London, of pneumonia, is a great shock to
his many friends. A brilliant young medico,
lecturer in anatomy to Melbourne Univer-
sity, he w r as assured of a brilliant future.
Much sympathy goes out to his pretty little
wife, who was Meryl Waxman.
Lieutenant Clive Fairbairh, Senator
George’s only son, has brought himself and
his pretty wife (she was Marjorie Jowett)
safely back home again. When they have
shaken hands with all their pals they are
going for a rest to the Fairbairn summer
humpy, which is perched on a hill near
Mount Martha.
Mrs. Fred Payne has reached Melbourne
again, and the Best People are taking furtive
peeps into their wardrobes in case she enter-
tains on the gorgeous pre-war scale. The
lady looks younger and slimmer, and her
clothes have a nice London hang about them.
She reports many good Australians “all
well.” The list includes the Dick Caseys,
Stuart Murrays, Norman Arinytages, Buck-
leys, Osbornes, Percy and George Chirnsides.
Melbourne’s new Gaud Mayor, William
Cabena, seems to be something of a Solomon.
The other day a Melbourne daily requested
Cabena’s opinions about post-war possibili-
ties. Cabena duly gave them, and concluded
gravely: “If we have good seasons I think
we will continue prosperous, but if we have
dry seasons I think conditions will certainly
not be nearly as good.”
Captain Nutting, who gent-helped for a
while on a former Governor-General’s staff,
and has since served two years in France,
now wears the family title. Just before suc-
ceeding to his father’s baronetcy the tall
soldier received a nasty kick from a horse,
which laid him up for a bit. His wife is an
Irish girl.
Mrs. George Ghirnside is tracking back to
Australia. Said that daughter Audrey and
son-in-law Captain Harold Pape, who lately
earned an M.C. while on tank duty, may
visit the Commonwealth presently.
Mrs. Henry Harper has just endured the
appendicitis operation in a private hospital
and is feeling cheery again. Son Colin, who
is with a British regiment, has cabled that
he weathered the final war burst safely.
The annual juvenile dance given by Mrs.
William Green and daughter Florrie will

December 9.
The Jowetts are giving a big spreajd and a
danCe to welcome daughter Mrs. Clive Fair-
bairn back from England.
Barrister Hender-
son, whom Ruth
Ilollick has photo-
graphed here, is sec-
retary of the Re-
turned Sailors and
Soldiers’. League for
the whole of Aus-
tralasia. A keen
South Australian,
he practised in Adel-
aide until he enlist-
ed. After two years’
fighting he was in-
vadided home with
rheumatism. He has
relinquished all his
old business inter-
ests and thrown
himself completely
into this important
work. It is good luck for Billjim generally,
for he is a fine type of executive officer and
has the proper training for the job. He is
ready to tackle his part in the repatriation
troubles—the biggest problem Australia has
to face at present.
Mrs. Austin Enabling fed a large party at
Menzies’ last Thursday. The Dutton Greenes
from S.A. were on hand, also the Harry
Emmertons and Mrs. Norman Brookes. The
Ross Fenners pecked a bit, and the Edwin
Millers, Ledinghams. Mrs. Groom and Mrs.
Mcßean, of the Falkiner clan, also accepted
some nourishment,
Chief-Officer Chugg, of the wrecked
barque John Murray, who recently arrived
in Melbourne after four or five months’
wanderings among the islands of the South
Seas, was well treated by the various King
Billies with whom he came in contact. The
(phief of Rakahanga came to light with a
curved canoe and paddle inlaid with mother-
of-pearl. At Manihiki the tar was intro-
duced to King Apollo, a youthful sovereign
of 80,000, whose hospitality was limitless.
It included, amongst other luxuries, a gift of
his own granddaughter, a fine, plump lass of
18, to be the salt’s daughter. Chugg, not
having £lOO loose change to cover the usual
White Australia guarantee, the lady did not
make the voyage with her honorary father.
Among the strangers collided with on the
cruise was one of the Grices, of Melbourne,
now guano king in the region of Malden
Island. The Ancient Mariners are to give
their wandering comrade a night out to cele-
brate his return, and, meanwhile, are impati-
ently waiting for a reading of the log.
Th e Education

Adelaide’s list for the week: —
The first big batch of Anzacs on furlough arrived
on Sunday, and next day the soldiers were officially
welcomed by the Anzac Hospitality Committee after
their march through the streets. The luncheon was
in the Exhibition Building, and Clara Serena sang
twice —“Rule Britannia” and “The Perfect Day.”
If the men get their discharge instead of brief fur-
lough, the Anzac Committee has decided to spend its
funds in entertaining all South Australian members
of the A.I.F. as they return, instead of limiting its
activities to Anzacs who had been granted furlough.
r fhe Soldiers’ Fund has decided to make an allowance
to all men returning for discharge—£l for married
and 10s. for single men—to 1914 men for four weeks ;
1915 men, three weeks; and men who enlisted in
1916, or later, two weeks. It will be given to them
in a lump sum at the commencement of their fur-
lough. The same fund has also the £lOO,OOO in
hand which was necessary before it could start its
widows and orphans’ insurance scheme, and a special
committee has been appointed to deal with that
branch of its work.
Lieut.-Col. E. T. Dean has added the Legion of
Honor to his D. 5.0., and a D.S.O. has come to
Brigade-Major R. H. Norman, who already had the
MX'.
Kathleen Kyffin Thomas is still in Melbourne,
taking a well-earned spell after over four years of
Red Cross work. On Wednesday the Thomas dame
left for a brief holiday in Victoria.
The Galway dame is leaving for England by the
Niagara early in January. The patriotic workers
will miss her. Miss d’Erlanger goes with her Ex.,
and after their departure the Governor will go to
Marble Hill for the summer.
Mrs. Edmund Wright and Marjorie Craig, bound
for London, have booked their passages by the
Niagara. The Duncan dame and her two daughters
leave London in February for Australia. They have
done three years’ war work in the Fog.
Adelaide Society of Arts is showing a war relic
which is also a real work of art. It comes from the
destroyed church at Albert in France —the one where
the statue of the Virgin hung out at a right angle
from the spire for several years till the place was
finally smashed up. The souvenir, sent home by a
lieutenant of the 50th, since killed, is a head, in
colors, of (probably) St. Peter. It was evidently a
bit of a wall-painting, or rather of some large work
attached to the wall, on a fabric into which the
colors have sunk deep, giving the effect of a fresco.
J. H. Vaughan, one of the two S.A. ex-Attorney
Generals on active service (W. J. Denny is the
other), left Australia as a ranker. News has now
reached Adelaide that he worked up to a commission
before the war stopped ; also, he was just out of the
English hospital in which he had lately spent a long
time.
Sylvia Desmond, the Bananaland niece of
Mrs. Frank Ratvlinson, is showing her
engagement-ring, and collecting congratula-
tions. The man singled out for what is
coming to him is Allan Maine, a soldier-
brother of Mrs. Hume Cook.
Alice McCullagh is the next sassiety girl
on the orange-blossom list. She is to be
married on December 10, and Hamilton is
now getting ready for the celebrations. Mr.
Laidlaw, of that town, is the bridegroom-
elect. Mrs, McCullagh has been busy in
town ever since the races buying trousseau
finalities. Alice is one of our leading horse-
women, and when in Melbourne she “does”
Collins-street on the roof of a grey moke of
monumental size.
Major McCallum has had a cable from
his son. Captain James, that he managed
to get Blighty leave from France to marry
Miss Webb Stanley, a niece of Lord Stanley.
Charles Bright, Deputy P.M.G., has taken
another plunge into matrimony. The bride,
Miss Hay, is the daughter of a late N. S.
Wales squatter and was a trained nurse.
Hilda Power, only daughter of the Toorak
Frank Powers, has booked for a December
orange-blossoming with Ned Mann, of Syd-
ney.
Fritz Hart and the Melba pupils are
doing opera at the Playhouse to-night
(Thursday) and Saturday. Melba will
supervise. The two lots of Governor folk
are booked up for the first evening.
Pianiste Doris Madden is setting off to
America presently. Just now she is recu-
perating from an appendicitis job in a private
hospital.
When not fingering a typewriter at Dal-
gety’s, Mary Wilkinson, who some years back
carried off the prize for a long poem offered
in connection with the big Women’s Work
Exhibition, has lately been hard at work com-
piling a comprehensive collection of Aus-
tralian verse, which is shortly to be issued
in six volumes, the contents of which will be
grouped under various headings, such as
“Light Verse,” “Verses by Women,” etc.
Before the war “Whither,” a play by Miss
Wilkinson, was presented by Gregan
McMahon under Repertory auspices.
Vance Palmer, poet, author, soldier and
idealist, was on the Barambah, the troopship
which has been held up as a shocking exam-
ple, although Heaven knows many other
examples could have been quoted long ago
had the Censor permitted.
The recent peace demonstration at Fed-
eral Parliament House showed the form of
a cross, with the top on the steps, and the
populace spread thickly north and south
along Spring-street and west down Bourke-
streot. It is curious that when the cross is
illuminated on top of St. Patrick’s tower
on Eastern Hill it appears, when viewed
from Bourke-street West, to be over Par-
liament House. O’Shanassy proposed, about
70 years ago, before St. Pat’s was com
mended, that there should be a Grand
Square on the hill, with Parliament House
on one side, Government offices on another,
and St. Patrick’s on a third. This scheme
was capsized, but to the enormous advan-
tage of St. Pat’s.
Before the Hun had enough England was
getting to the end of its resources in work-
ing women. Over 700,000 were in the
munition line, while .‘lOO,OOO toiled on the
land and nearly 300,000 did their hair in
the Government offices. Unnumbered thou-
sands earned elsewhere in commercial and
industrial life. The very big wages led to a
strange increase of smoking among women,
as a supplement to much extra dress and
jewellery.
Prime Minister Hughes’ favorite seaside
haunt, the Clifton Springs Hotel, is on the
market, after 18 years’ ownership by Tom
Nunan. The immense old pub is a boom
product, having been built 00 years ago at a
cost of £30,000. The Defence Department
ran the place for convalescents for a time,
but the local attractions, which mostly con-
sist of paddocks and hedges, a neat beach
and a row of mixed springs, apparently made
them sleep too much; so the buildiug was
presently turned into a pub again.

Tlie “restrictions on racing - ’ imposed by
the Federal Government go overboard at the end of
the month. It is the best place for them. As a
means of winning the war these “restrictions” were
obviously futile. Looked at from any other point of
view they were farcical. The way will be open in a
week or two, therefore, to return to the mid-week
effort by the Sydney pony, the regular Saturday
suburban pony and horse skelter, and proceedings in
the interval on the “outer” courses. Of course this
will give additional employment to alleged trainers
and to jockeys, and blacksmiths, gatekeepers, booze-
dispensers, tipsters, and additional dividends to race-
course proprietors. Taking everything into considera-
tion, though, this page would risk giving a shade of
odds that so long as hard-up Treasurers are allowed
to make piratical raids on the totalisator, the multi-
tudinous “race” meeting familiar to Sydney-siders
will be viewed through the political eye with indul-
gent benevolence. So long as the Government can
annex anything from £5OO to LIOOO from a rgee-
meet ing, what would it matter whether horses do the
racing or the flying and the welter are open to
camels and william-goats?
“Trot”: As the race meeting is to be
restored to its former frequency, I merely want to
point out to Brother Milieu, the repatriation special-
ist, that he Ought not to overlook the great national
industry ready to bis hand for the absorption ot
Williamjim. If there is anything the matter with
handing the suburban racing menu over to the re-
turned soldier, Milieu may perhaps explain what it
is. if not—well, then, the time will be ripe. II
all jobs incidental to the hurry-up for small stakes
were made open only to ex-soldiers—if all the train-
ing, riding and betting had to be done by the same
individuals —the restoration to civil life of the soldier
would be robbed of many of its difficulties. Why
not, anyway? it would give the soldiers an easy
living, and quite a lot of other able-bodied indivi-
duals a chance to go and get work at increasing pro-
duction. # #
Tn point of performance a thoroughbred
landed at Sydney last week has something to com-
mend him, ior he is the only winner of an English
“classic” in Australia. This is Night Hawk, by
Gallinule from the Ayrshire mare Jean's Folly. The
nag was bought by E. It. White for use at Merton,
but as that stud'has been dispersed the harem \vill
apparently be decided by competition.

The Maorilander Finmark, who is princi-
pally remarkable up to date for not winning Derbies,
has been exchanged by owner Lowry for a scrap of
paper—with several figures on it. The new owner
is proprietor-of-Colugo Wade, and the allegation is
that the figures were not less than L5OOO, and pro-
bably more. Wade is a pretty good judge, and has
a lot of pluck. But it seems a lot of cash. Possibly
he has the two Legers in view. If they don’t come
off it will certainly seem a lot more.

There were eight races at Itosehill (Syd-
ney) on Saturday, and though six favorites failed to
win, the half-dozen others who turned up first were
a iong way from bringing unanimous joy to Israel,
for they " led to some fairly substantial wads being
handed 'back. The most noticeable happening of the
day was the spectacle of the ex-Maorilander Bimeter
hitting the line at last. This was in the Clyde
Stakes, for which there were 18 starters, including
Dame Acre, who drifted off at 10’s. The Bimeter
following threw in their cash again, and this time
got some of what they had parted with back. The
horse got away well, and after Dame Acre blew up
half-way up the straight it was a question of whether
Wood could keep the black deceiver going. He
managed it right enough, winning by half a neek
from Coolstone, with the well-backed Speedfast,
Dungannon, Goorianawa, and Riz Biscuit well
astern. Bimeter keeps his pace all right. The six
furlongs were run in “135.” His main trouble is a
rooted objection to galloping in a field or having
anything but his own way.
The November Handicap, a mile and a
quarter, brought a field of 13 moderates into the
picture. There was a sweep on the event, so to
some of them the race was for something more sub-
stantial than usual. The Newcastle gelding Red
Cardinal was made a short-priced .favorite, for
reasons that were not very clear. Two Blues and
Gall to Arms were next on the list, and the simple
storv of the proceedings is that neither they nor
any" of the rest had a hope of beating the ex-
Bananalander Kenelic. He was easily the best-condi-
tioned horse in the race, and, running to the front
at the turn, he streaked away over tlie last furlong
as if pursued by a multitude of Bolsheviks. The
judge said six lengths. It looked a dozen. Another
former Bananalander, The Bounce, was with them up
to a mile, and then petered out. The Newcastle
goods delivered themselves second.
Prince Bardolph’s brother, Garibaldi, who was
taken to Melbourne last month but omitted to
do anything in justification of tlie step, liked -the
going better at Roschill on Saturday. The ex-
MaorilaDder First Rain, who had attracted attention
at Randwick, was made a nearly red-hot order for
the Trial Stakes. But it didn’t come off. Garibaldi,
cutting out the mile with Bst. 51b. in lmin. 40lsec.,
won easily, and Harcliff, who has been over hurdles
lately, pushed First Rain away from second money
in the last few strides. Garibaldi is a workable
looking animal, who may yet be heard of over a
distance. He is owned by one of the proprietors of
Bronzetti.
A juvenile with exceptional pace had a
win at Rosehill on Saturday—Xauteli Girl, a filly
by the defunct Syce. There were a dozen others in
the second division of the Nursery Handicap, and
unless some of them wanted an airing they might
as well have been kept at home. The young lady
won easing up by half a dozen lengths. A few of
the rest were very green. Among them was a brother
to Poitrel. He showed the way to the turn, and
then kept straight on to the outside. It seemed a
pity to see him on the premises.
In the weights for the A.J.C. Villiers mile
and the Summer Cup, a mile and five furlongs,
Rebus, the only nag besides Cetigne of any importance
in both, is top weight with Cetigne (9.10) for the
short journey, and with 9.G is only lib. off the top-
weight, Bursar, for the more extended trip. This
may leave him a chance*in both, but not a very big
one. Up to 9st. weight does not seem to trouble
Rebus, but when he carries a bit more it, appears to
trouble him quite a lot.
* * * *
Perhaps it doesn’t matter one way or the
other, but it looks rather strange to see an old slave
like Bee handicapped in the Villiers Stakes to be
better than Fight Ever, Satin Bird, Sir Paddington,
Kilmaine and Garibaldi; and in the Summer Clip
ahead of Two Blues, Destroyer, Garrus and Camp
Out. Apparently this old ’un is being weighted for
the numerous races she nusn’t won —a not infrequent
happening.

“Snipster”: At a recent Morphettville
(S.A.) meeting a full-grown citizen attacked the
proceedings with a really clever system, lie works
it out on a Chinese recipe. Taking the race-book
the sera tellings are first scored out. Then the thir-
teenth from the top is given no chance and ruled
,out. Each successive thirteenth is subsequently
outed, and so on until there are left the three
place-getters. You think the ultimate winner would
be the last left in. Oh. no! The second, according
to the Chow method, is first. This emphasises the
skill which enters into the matter. lie certainly
picked only three winners, but they were the-largest
dividends, averaging over £lO- which of course
provf-s that the system is not serious when dealing
with short prices. But for getting on fo the rough-
’ll ns you can’t beat it. Just put a hundred or two
aside and give it a go.

Lieut. Norman "Lemon, a prominent ama-
teur rider before the war, returned to Adelaide with
one of the last batches from the Front. He saw
some racing in England, and describes the Derby
winner, Gainsborough, as a solid little customer, all
grit and determination. He selects Panther to win
the Vietorv Derby next year. Lemon spent most of
his leave' with Robert Wootton at Epsom, and
states that the old Sydney-sider will now soon
return to Australia. The training establishment ■at
Treadwell House, where about-' 60 horses are in
work, would be carried on by Lieut. Stanley Woot-
ton, M.C.-

“Jacko”: I’ll nominate the Bathurst dis-
trict. (N.S.W.) as being able to produce a list of
thoroughbreds famous on the course as long as any
other string credited to any- part of the Common-
wealth. - A list of the neddies has just been compiled
and looks more like a sales catalogue than a collec-
tion of records. All the principal races are men-
tioned. The- Lees, of course, have been the most
prominent in the business —George at Leeholme, John
at liarralee, William at Millbank, and Thomas at
Woodlands. The greater part of the winners run
back to Sappho, who, on the authority of the late
George Lee, was originally used to draw water from
tin- Macquarie to the bouse. Anyway, her descend-
ants have from time to time collared fhß following,
among other events: Melbourne Cup, Viet mi an Derby,
Sydney Cup, A.J.C. Derby, Maribrynoug Plate, V.R.C.
Oaks, Champagne Stakes, Caulfield Guineas, Adelaide
Cup, Carrington Stakes, Debutant Stakes, December
Stakes, Brisbane Cup, Canterbury Derby, Wanganui
Derby, Tattersall’s Cup, Perth Cup and Gim-
craek Stakes. The stud business was started
at Bathurst with Sir Hercules, who went from
T. R. Iceley to .T. Redwood for £25. Iceley is still
alive at Coombing Park. Amberite is credited to
Bathurst, and his dam was reared in the district.
* * * *
Accounts of the w.f.a. Stead memorinl at
Christchurch (M.L.), received by the delayed and
fumigated mails from over yonder,, show that
Sasanoff’s win from Gloaming was of the quite com-
fortable variety. The Derby winner got out a length
and a half at the start, but was collared at the turn
and well beaten at the last furlong, Sasanoff drawing
right away from him. Apparent! v the Greenwoods’
nag had gone off a lot. He won the Derby a day or
two before easily, and a week earlier at Wellington
took the Champion Plate. Or Sasanoff must have
improved a. ton, for in the Plate run over the same
distance as the Memorial he couldn’t get near the
younger animal. The mile and a quarter, by the
way, about which there was a confusion in the cabled
time, was negotiated by Sasanoff with 9st. in 2min.
ssec record for the Ricenrton course and only
Asec. outside Cetigne’s Craven Plate.
* * * *
In a recent week’s racing at Christchurch
(M.L.) the tote turnover at three days’ galloping
was £133,702, and at three days’ trots £136,643.
If Sydney had trots like that the local Government
would appropriate £9300, and it is more than likely
that someone would make a few demented remarks
about the great saving to the aggregate punter
through being relieved of his splosh by a machine,
from which lie can win bfick nothing, instead of by
Tsaac. It is when the figures relating to what hap-
pens at small places where the tote is given a free
innings ar e looked at that the rapacity of the Syd-
ney grab of .7 per cent, can be properly measured
and the reason why the machine in N. S. Wales only
gets the fag-end of the betting can be appreciated.
There is very little point of comparison between a
place like Christchurch and Sydney so far as volume
of betting is concerned, but when they average
£45,000 a day at trots in M.L. and £55,000 a
day at Randwick—well, you can guess at how much
of the prevailing business the tote didn’t get at the
place where Desert Gold hit trouble.
If they got him right in the Electric Plate
at the recent C.J.C. (Maoriland) meeting the Stead-
owned Surveyor is something out of the ordinary as
a sprinter. ~ The time given for the half-mile was
45§sec. The previous best time for the distance
was 46 l-ssec., registered on the same course in the
same race by old man Stead’s Conqueror—46 l-ssec.
There is a nice little calculation for time fiends in
the problem of how much quicker Surveyor travelled
than the other prad. It runs out at 9-20ths of a
second for the whole journey. Translated into dis-
tance this would mean a speed better than 19yds.
a second, and that the record-breaker beat Con-
queror’s effort by 2Jth yards per furlong. It is a
terrifically fast pace for a horse to achieve this.
When an animal is foaled that can continue doing it
for another quarter-mile, then whatever else wants
to win the Flying Handicap has to do better
than lmin. BJsec. There is record of “7 1-5”
standing to the credit of Master \S illie at Epsom,
England, but the journey was partly down hill. The
Tetrarch is, however, credited with doing the trip
on the level in “1' 3-5” on June 3, 1913. According
to that he would have beaten Surveyor for the Elec-
tric Plate by a good couple of lengths.
* * * *
A gelding winning a Derby is a circum-
stance having hilarious aspects. It happened this
year at Randwick Riecarton (M.L.) and Ken-
tucky. But Ole Kentuck isn’t going to have it
any more. After Exterminator won the other day
the rules were altered, and the Kentucky Derby
follows the lines of the English event. The last
gelding to win at Epsom was Democrat. The nag
was afterwards presented to Kitchener for use as
a “charger.”
Dead at Melbourne last week, Charlie
McLeod, one of the best all-round Australian cricket-
eters of a dozen or so years ago. He went to Eng-
land with the teams of '99 and ’O5, but did better
on wickets hereabouts than over there. Still some
of his performances in England were really good, the
best perhaps being 77 in a test match on the Oval
in ’99. As a bowler he at times was deadly. Taking
everything into consideration it may be safe to say
that Charles hitched up his pants more often than
anyone else. Before every delivery his hand would
go'to the back of his i belt, give a couple of quick
pullfc—and then he was ready to run. It was a queer
mannerism, and stuck to him all through. After
giving up cricket lie became well known on the turf.
Finished at 49.
* * * *
Au episode in just-dead Charlie McLeod’s
career -which led to "a lot of argument happened in
a test played at Sydney. He was skittled by a
no-ball. Being slightly deaf he did not hear the
umpire’s call, and, thinking it was all off, started
for the pavilion. As he left the crease Storer, the
Derbyshire keeper, ball in hand, [lulled up the remain-
ing wicket and got a verdict —run out.. This was
good enough cricket but rotten sport. Storer seemed
to take that vie\V of the matter too, for he made
diaries a present of his best bat to assist forgetful-
ness.
In the 20 chosen to practise for the final
selection of N.S.W. XI against Vie. this, month are
most of those who have done big things in Sydney
first-grade cricket this year. Six were in the ’l4-’ 15
Sheffield Shield matches. Two are oldsters —M. A.
Noble and E. L. Waddy. The other dozen have yet
to play in inter-State cricket for the first time. Six
of Ma’s reps, of ’l4-’l5 are, however, in khaki. A
not unpleasing feature of the selection is the encour-
agement given to W. G. Brown (Newington) and R.
H. Bettington (King’s), two lads who have hit up
centuries in school cricket during the season.
Wicket-keepers C. J. McKew (Western
Suburbs) and A. A. Ratcliffe (Balmain) are enjoying
hard labor in Sydney first-grade cricket this year.
In five rounds of matches McKew has given away
only 20 byes in 1313 runs. Meanwhile he stumped
three and caught two. Ratcliffe’s vigilance has
allowed 30 byes in 1117. His catching! number five
and his stumpings four. Ratcliffe will again be the
stumper in Ma’s XI against, Victoria this month.
Last year Ratcliffe’s aggregate (572) was fifth,
and his average 35.75 ; while a hurricane whack of
170 not out was only two behind club-mate B. J.
Folkard’s best individual wallop of the season.
In consequence mainly of fine double scores
(19 and 83) by Newman (Newington College) on
Saturday, at Sydney, King’s School lost its grip
on the Great Public School premiership. A win
for King’s would have meant a final with Sydney
Grammar; but Newington (124 and 3 for 220) won
on the first innings by six runs. Since 1893 the
Grammar School has been successful on 17 occasions.
Also it shared first in ’93 with Newington a,nd St.
Joseph’s and did the same in ’l3-14 with Newington
and King’s.
* * * *
There was some tall scoring in a North
Adelaide-East Torrens match the other Saturday.
Richardson, who a few weeks before piled up 162
runs, gave the spectators something to recall old Jack
Lyons. Associated with Loveridge the two put to-
gether 373. Richardson’s share was 250 —184 from
boundary hits (31 fours and 10 sixers). He was
3 hours' 14 minutes on the job. Loveridge treated the
howling more politely, finishing with 126 not out.
Another brilliant smiter, Townsend, scored 109 in 99
minutes in this match. He is an old inter-State
footballer, and centuries are becoming a vice with
him. East Torrens’s total was 538 for five wickets
in reply to North’s 128., This is the only kind of
scoring to make cricket popular. But S.A. seems
weak in bowling just now.
“Adelovl” : Well, if I was Billy Hughes I
would limit the time of each team’s innings to three
or four hours. Then the selectors could choose a few
men to potter around for half an hour before making
a run in order to tire the bowling for the smiters.
This would give the crowd something to wait for, as
hitting would have to follow the scratching inter-
lude. With, say, half an hour to go and a few
wickets in hand, cricket ought surely be lively enough
to tempt spectators away from the excitement of hops
and pictures. In the ’9o’s thousands in Adelaide used
to flock to see men like Jack Lyons and Ernie Jones
hitting ’em up. The only slow part of the game was
waiting for the ball to be retrieved from outside the
ground. Furthermore, if I were Hughes, the bowlers
would get a little attention, too. The umpire would
be given the-powers of . Inter-State Commissioner
Piddington, with right to instruct the bowler after
sending down a number of off-theory deliveries to
bowl on the wicket —and no-ball him if he didn’t do
it. Run-getting is the thing that ought to be
encouraged. And a cricketer either ought to make
runs quickly or get flung out.
See-saw : Lancashire is barracking for
the eight-ball over in English county matches As
any suggestion for “meddling” with the rules of
cricket is in England regarded as an impiety, the
controversy will most likely be long and bitter. But
it is a sure thing that unless the game is speeded-up
a lot more than is possible by putting eight deliveries
into an over, cricket will never again get the hold on
Australia as a spectacle that it had in the long
ago. In any case, cricket in- England and Australia
is not the same thing. Over there the backbone of
the thing is the county game and the person of
leisure. It has a certain social significance. Here-
abouts cricket must either be the game of the crowd
or nothing—and the crowd which can look interestedly
on at the dreary combats into which cricket had
degenerated before the war is even smaller now than
it was before. Tennis-players, footballers, bike-
riders, pugs and the rest of them, cannot dig them-
selves in for hours at a stretch. They, have got to
hurry up. So should a cricketer, arid there is
nothing for it but a time-limit for innings and match
if cricket is to be saved from getting to the same
place as bowls. As a game to play, even undeij the
prevailing rules, it has a lot of good points, in' the
same way as golf and marbles. But as a conflict to
watch and read long yarns about in the papers—
well, now how many people would pay three days
in succession to see a match at the movies?

Sydney Motor Cycle Club’s 24 hours relia-
bility trial over 404 miles was a triumph for the
side-car. Of 11 machines to come through without
loss of points, ill but one carried side passengers.
This result should convince controlling clubs that
something more difficult is necessary if an ultimate
winner is desired. How about some tree climbing?

Melbourne Gun Club, being seized with an
idea that the men who throngh four years risked
all —when they didn't lose all in defence of freedom
and civilisation might like to keep their hands in,
offers “special events for returned soldiers and
novices,” said events comprising four- and six-bird
sweepstakes at starlings and pigeons. The Club's
ground is at Brighton (Vic.), which suburb always
did possess a crude sense of humor. Witness its
worship of Bent.

“G.L.H.”: Can any bloque account for
this? Have a new gun that will put more AAA
shot into a benzine-tin at 45 yards than when using
No. 1 shot. With three cartridges using former size
shot, 10, 10, 18 were the number of hits. Through
not knowing above shooting quality of gun, lost a
large dingo the other day.
“It.M.” : A good sport I know was railing
his dog to the country from his suburb, on the back
of old Prince’s travelling label he wrote this appeal:—
“For God’s sake, guard, give me a drink. If you
haven't got water, give me beer.”
Vinrace Lawrance, of Adelaide, lias been
reappointed, for the 30th year, an auditor
for the coaching business of Graves, Hill
and Co. (formerly John Hill and Co., and
originally Cobb and Co.). The Adelaide
papers suggest that this auditing of 00 half-
yearly balance-sheets may be a record for
Australia.


YOD’D BE AN EASY MARK FOR A
f
SCIENTIFIC BOXER ——
because you’re inexperienced and untrained You'dl be: flurried and ex-
cited, and consequently leave openings which would enable j oui opponent
to “deal it out”' to you. His scientific knowledge would enable him to
draw vou on He’d be calm and collected, and make every blow leave a
mark.‘ YOU’D be unable to penetrate his defence, and have to suffer the
humiliation of being defeated —possibly by a smaller man.
There’s no excuse for you not knowing how to box I can teach yo
in your own home.

scientific boxer. My course explains simply and con-

rive: The “Night Attack” is a fine vivid sample:—
A sentry on duty a
Faithful vigil did keep,
During the silence of night.
While his comrades did sleep.
Shrill whistled the wind
As he paced to and fro,
When he was cowardly shot
By a spy of the foe-
He crept to a trench, and
With an effort did shout,
Comrades to arms,
The Germans are out.
Aroused were the gallants,
Whom rushed forth to attack,
And with fixed bayonets drove
The crafty Huns back.
You’ve routed ’em, lads, were
The last words he did say,
When on the verge of death
The brave sentry lay.

ruined an old joke J.H.C.: Alphabet not for us.

to hand Roderigo: Don’t like your patent wowsers.

L.V.A.C.: No use.
The Labor following at Albert Park
(Vic.), the State constituency which for so
long returned the late George Elmslie with
a thumping majority, is offering an unusual
example to the rest of the party throughout
the State. In memory of the dead Labor
leader, a local committee is about to estab-
lish a scholarship at the South Melbourne
“tech.,” a fine establishment which Elmslie
helped to found.
“Glen H”: Victoria’s alleged “economy”
Government is inclined to look with favor
on the proposal, frequently turned down in
the past, that the leader of the Opposition
should be provided with a salary in addition
to his pay as a member. John Bowser, pro-
bably foreseeing the day when he may him-
self 'be Opposition leader, has promised to
ask the Cabinet to agree to the proposal.
He says he feels a sense of personal reproach
because several Opposition leaders have had
breakdowns in health owing to overwork, but
does not make it clear hojv an increase in
salary is going to decrease the amount of
work the recipient is called upon to perform.
Arguments based on the alleged value to the
State of criticism of Government measures
supplied by the captain of the “Outs” cer-
tainly does not apply to Prendergast, whose
leadership is conspicuous for nothing.
He has been more or less in com-
mand of the Labor party for many years,
and Victoria is the one State in the Com-
monwealth that has not felt inclined to trust
Labor in office. There seems no good reason
why those who have failed to trust him
should pay Prendergast an additional £3OO
i a year as a consolation prize.

A Summer Tonic,
Summer is a hard season for those who
have no stored-up reserve of strength. The
coining of hot summer weather means sick-
ness for. many, because debility robs the sys-
tem of its power to protect itself.
One person may go through the whole
season without any ill effects, while another,
whose blood is thin and whose nerves are
run-down, will he confined to bed after a few-
hot days.
Keeping the blood built up is the secret
of keeping wmll in summer. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People are the best and
most convenient tonic for the blood. Put
up with complete directions for use they are
a family remedy that can be depended upon
in conditions of thin blood, debility and
many common forms of weakness.
The blood goes to practically every part
of the body, and if it is rich and red it
carries health and strength to every organ.
The digestion is toned up, the nerves are
strengthened, and aching muscles are made
strong. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are especi-
ally useful to run-down women who worry
about their daily tasks and duties.
A few wmeks’ treatment has in hundreds
of such cases brought the most remarkable
improvement.
A useful booklet on “Diseases of the
Blood” will be sent on application to Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Box 504 C.P.0..
Sydney. It tells women of all ages how to
be well. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold
by most chemists or storekeepers at 2/9 per
box, 6 boxes 15/3. —Advt.

J. IRELAND LTD., Newcastle.
Samuel Whitehead, director of Tic. Immi-
gration Bureau, has raised steam in anticipa-
tion of an early influx of immigrants from
Europe. lie prophesies that, "If we have a
few prosperous years, rural industries will
absorb all the labor that we can possibly
secure.’’ Probably Whitehead is quite right
about the quantity of labor that will be avail-
able by-aml-bye, but its absorption in rural
districts is quite another matter. Federal
Statistician Ivnibbs, in a recent estimate,
stated that within the next 10 years, if
nothing unforeseen happens to block the pre-
sent tide of population flowing into the city,
Melbourne will have a million inhabitants.
Many of these will be ex-bushwhackers, fully
capable of many years’ further work behind
the plough; and a large proportion of the
others will be Eldorado-seekers from over-
seas, attracted hither by beautiful pictures of
rural Victoria, and kept in Melbourne by a
better cash prospect than the bush offers
them. Allowing for the influx anticipated
by Whitehead, only the wildest optimist can
believe that, with what is before the land-
chaser under existing settlement-conditions,
the population of rural Victoria will be
swelled in a manner proportionate to the
bloating which Ivnibbs foresees for the city.
Whitehead, apparently, is not concerned with
the settlement of a large swarm of inde-
pendent farmers on the land, but merely
anticipates a better time for the rural-produ-
cers already well-established in the business.
That is hardly an adequate outlook for a
Government immigration department. The
lamentable history of Victorian land-settle-
ment, considered in terms of actual produc-
tion, shows only too plainly that the State
will require more than an influx of immi-
grants to Port Melbourne to guarantee its
permanent rural prosperity. What the Vic-
torian bush needs most is an incursion of
self-acting farmers, fitted with as many of
the latest improvements as possible, working
their own land with their own hands. The
big employer of rural labor, occupying a large
area of good land, is an excellent asset as far
as he goes: but an army of smaller land-
holders, toiling for themselves on the same
area, will bring more grist to the country’s
mill in the long run.
Dead on his ship, off Port Adelaide, sud-
denly, Captain William Thompson. He be-
longed to the sea from the start, being born
in an English lighthouse. In 1876 he came to
Australia, at the age of 22, went pearling to
Thursday Island, then traded on the Queens-
land coast for the A.U.S.N., but afterwards
joined the Adelaide Steamship. Co., with
which he remained till his death.
“Country Ped”: Two fine instances of the
Australian boy’s pluck and x’esource: Some
Nortkcote (Vic.) school-kids were swim-
ming in a deep quarry hole. One, Melvor,
became exhausted. Whittaker, a good
swimmer, went to his assistance, but the
drowning boy grappled with him. King, who
was standing on the bank, 14ft. above, dived,
freed Whittaker, and with his assistance
brought Melvor to land. The other case
occurred at Moonee Ponds (Vic.). A 10-
year-old named Besanko was bathing with his
mates in the creek when he got into deep
water, and, being unable to swim, sank.
The lads near by ran up and down the bank
shouting for help; but one, Dudley Town-
shend, aged 13, swam to the aid of the drown-
ing boy, who clutched him fast. However,
Townshend managed to bring the other to the
bank, and then fell exhausted. Two other
boys, Mee and Lovelock, began the treat-
ment for the apparently drowned, which they
continued until they had brought to life the
rescued boy.
When General Pau told the people of Port
Pirie (S.A.) that he would never forget their
town, it was something more than the con-
ventional politeness of his nation He is,
by birth, of Alsace, and his wife of Lorraine,
and it was at Pirie that the news came of
the final freeing of those provinces from the
grasp of the Hun. The French visitors had
inspected the Broken Hill cos.’ smelters, and
were at an official luncheon when chairman
Baillieu, of Melbourne, read out the news.
The veteran soldier shed a few real tears of
joy. The other member of the party most
nearly affected was Dr. Siegfried, a - univer-
sity professor, whose German-sounding name
is accounted for bv the fact that his parents
were old residents of the border province;
they left it when it was annexed by Germany
in IS7O.
“8.T.”: The Irish sometimes act their
“bulls.” Look at Tom Doyle, a “ppm” from
Connaught, who was working for Casper at
Foot Bridge, sinking a well. The well was
down about 40ft., and at length a ladder was
introduced to facilitate the ups and downs
of that hard life. The ladder was made of
two sapling butts fastened together, end on,
with cleets nailed across for rungs, and it
was hung at one side of the shaft. Casper,
who was working below, irritated at the non-
appearance of Doyle after calling a dozen
times, climbed to the surface, and in the
course of a hunt located Tom in the sapling
scrub, felling a stick. “And what is this
for?” demanded Casper as the “pom” pro-
ceeded to lop off the branches. “ ’Tis for the
other ladder. What ilse?” Tom replied,
mopping the honest sweat from his manly
brow. “What other ladder?” “For the hole
beyant, to be sure.” “But we’ve got one
ladder down: what the devil do we want
with another?” “That’s fer goin’ down, all
right,” said Doyle; “but, man, yi’ll be
wantin’ an-nother to come up be.”
, Sweden is mentioned among the places
which have an incipient revolution on hand.
It is a beastly cold country which struggles
to maintain a king (though he is a cheap
one with £98.000 a year for self and family),
and too many second-rate nobles (there were
recently three counts in the Ministry). On
the other hand, the capital is beautiful, with
a suggestion of Venice in its waterways, and
it contains only one-fourteenth of the popula-
tion instead of one-half after the Australian
plan; the debt is being paid off; the State
enterprises, including the railways and the
bank, are worked at a solid profit; there is
workmen’s insurance, compulsory education
and a tax on bagmen, who are heavily fined
if they go bagging without their license. It
won’t matter if the king and the climate and'
the superfluous counts are lost in the scuffle,
but some of the other ideas seem valuable.

graph and give you my
full permission to make

there is nothing so good. Gin Pills are sure to help you. This sounds
a big thing to say, but it’s true.
I remain, yours faithfully,

Fantasia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MYRIAD fancies of a myriad kind
People the plains and cities of my
mind,
And dream and work and fight and bleed and
\ changing changeless multitude, and I,
I'm their creator, whom they never see,
Yet who, they know, must surely be
Throned in eternity.
My laziest wish to them is like some great
Cyclone of fate
That reels across the calmness of their sky,
Driving them suddenly, they know not why,
To what fantastic labors I dictate.
Yet of these myriad fancies that are swayed
Upon the swirling strife
And strange unending turbulence of life,
More than the most of them are dull anc
staid,
And born to toil at some ancestral trade;
To plod forever in a well-worn way
And dress in the depressing black and grey
Of everyday;
To rule red lines in ledgers, whence they tell
The profits of the factories of Hell;
Or juggle with the mystic sum of seven
To calculate the seating space in Heaven ;
To feast on warmed-up scraps of bad advice,
And value threadbare thoughts at more than
twice
Their pawning price.
They live their lives of stress that seem
repose,
And serve their purpose, just as liorsedung
goes
To beautify the rose ;
For here and there amid that myriad strife
Some bright boy-fancy leaps to sudden life,
Scatters the dull traditions with a frown,
And treats the grey solemnities with scorn;
Then striding from the sacerdotal town,
Goes overlanding with the herds of morn,
And boils his billy by the crackling sun,
Pitches his camp beside the sky-lagoon,
And for a hammock, when the days are done,
Lolls in the crescent moon.
These are the ones I love and unto these
I give the keys
Of my broad universe. They doze and dream
In mossy grottos where the glow-worms
gleam ;
Or in the lofty stadium of the night
See the bright star-motes dancing in the light,
And two gods pounding in a ten-round fight.
They watch the schoolboys of the Milky Way
Kneel in the thoroughfares of space and play
Marbles with meteorites as taws. And then,
Rack to the wonders of the world of men.
They clamber where the bouldery crumbs are
spread
Around the mountain of a loaf of bread ;
And journeying on the tabletop plateau,
Pause deafenedly below
The towering waterfall that roars from out
The booming cavern of a teapot-spout.
Or, eager for the singing summer sky,
They ride a-straddle of a dragon-fly,
And laugh to see the sunlight once again
Glint on the gauzes of their aeroplane.
Or hand in hand with small winds wandering
free
They stride from mountain-peak to peak and
see
Cities like garden-patches far below,
Where hurrying people show
Smaller than midget-ants and harbors be
Sljallow lagoons and schooners are but swans.
Of lost among the jungles of the grass
They crouch and peer where centipedes that
pass •
Are basilisks, and ants are mastodons.
But once more wearying of the walks or men
They hear the clear call of the star-tracks.
Then
Gaily they saddle a gale and galloping go
Out from the homestead of the world, and so
On past the paddocks of the nights and days,
On where the camp-fires of the comets blaze,
Till in a far and starry-lillied land
They 101 l on opal sand,
Or like the gods of ages long gone by
Bathe in the seas of azure light and stand
Naked and beautiful beneath the sky.

BARTLETT ADAMSON.
An African Christmas,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE group of anxious people on the
terrace of the hotel St. Rey at El Biar
did not care a button whether it was
Christmas Eve or Easter Sunday. The white
mountains of Kabylia shone over the placid
waters of Lake Mustapha, in the shimmer-
ing African evening. Below, the lights of
Algiers winked and twinkled on the Medi-
terranean foreshore; Gibraltar kept his dis-
tant guard grimly over the Straits; and the
old fortress of the Casbah brooded in the
silent blackness of the Arab town.
Miss Gower turned to Rex Assheton. “Was
Ted very bad last night, Rex?”
“Oh, nothing to speak of, you know, Billy.”
Miss Gower sighed and followed Mrs.
Graves into the lounge. The velvet African
night came suddenly, with no twilight herald.
Below, the arc lamps of the Rue de Rovigo
made a hectic glare that looked like a distant
fire between Assheton and the night; all
manner of evil and danger hid in the houses
and streets between. Far out across El Sok
Morocco brooded, where slaves are bought
and sold to-day, and no man’s or woman’s
life is safe from hour to hour; five hundred
miles away the Sahara heaved and burned.
Assheton sighed in his turn and lit another
cigarette. The Christinas holiday in Algiers
that the little group of friends had hoped for
didn’t look like being a success.
Ted Brodie was a bad egg. He was the only
son of a romance. His father had inherited a
Riverina station, which he saw about once
a year; the rest of the year he searched the
world for diversion. He came to rest at
last on his marriage with a Moorish Spaniard
in Granada, a beautiful woman. Brodie
took her to the station, and there they lived
and died; and there Ted was born. He
remembered his mothers black eyes and coal-
black hair; he remembered the Eastern still-
ness of her face and hands. From her his
high cheekbones and dark color came, and
his silence. Sybil Gower was his cousin an
childhood companion.
Graves joined Assheton on the terrace; ]
walked to the balustrade and sat down
silence.
“Well,” said Assheton; “have you g
him?”
“No.”
“No sign of him?”
“I said I hadn’t got him. I’ve seen him..’
“Seen him? Why didn’t you collar him
and bring him home?”
“You know that little mosque we sa
yesterday down by the Casbah? I saw him
in a burnous going in to pray. He looked a
me and smiled; but he went in withou
speaking. I followed; but I couldn’t pic
him out of the crowd of white figure
although I spent nearly half an hour in th
place.”
“Good Lord !” said Assheton. “You’re no
drunk, too, are you, Graves?”
“No,” Graves said indifferently. “Neithe
is Brodie now.”
Assheton threw away his cigarette anc
stood over the lazy figure of Graves. Grave
looked up at him with complete indifference
he had already made up his mind about Tec
Brodie, as thoroughly as he knew wha
Assheton was going to say.
“But, damn it, man, whether he’s drunk o
sober, lie’s got to be found and brought back
And if he’s fooling about with these niggers
as you say, he’s in serious danger. Chasinj
some girl, I suppose. How can we get hole
of him again?”
Graves got up and yawned. “I don’t thin
it can be done, Assheton, and I am going t
have a bath —I’m beat. If you want to g
and arrest him, I’ll stop here and look afte
Billy and the mater. But I don’t envy you
your job.”
“Why don’t you think it can be done
Graves?”
“I don’t know. But that’s the impression
I’ve got.”
“Did you see Mitchell anywhere?”
“Yes. I kept running into him all day
He’s at the English Club bv now. He tolc
me to say that he wasn’t coming back here
without Ted, and that we were not to wai
meals for him.”
“All right, Graves, I’ll take it on. Explain
to the others at dinner.”
“Righto; keep sober.”
Mrs. Graves went to her room immediate]}
after dinner ; Sybil Gower and Graves wen
out to the terrace to smoke cigarettes anc
watch the leering, winking lights of Algiers
“You don’t tell us much of your search
Bob?”
“There is not much to tell, Billy.”
“Did you find no trace at all of Ted?”
“One trace. I saw him.” And Graves
told her of the white figure-going in to pray
When he had finished she leaned back in hei
chair; her face looked pale and worn, anc
her voice was suddenly tired.
“What does it mean, Bob? You know this
terrible place after the years you lived here
—what does it mean?”
Graves sat down beside her. “Billy, I’m
going to be quite frank with you. I was the
firm’s agent for three years in Algiers, anc
I know the place pretty well, but the thing
that I learned first —and never saw occasion
to unlearn—is this: nobody knows Algiers,
as nobody knows Port Said or Cairo or any
other town where the West has disturbed the
East. You ask what Brodie’s going into
that little mosque means. As I figure
it out, Billy, it means this: Brodie has
followed some throw-back or some East-
ern spot in his blood, and changed his
clothes—and liis heart and mind. We are
strangers to him and potential enemies ; he
knows nothing of his own people, and from
now his own people do not know him—
henceforth he will pass them with unseeing
eyes. He will live out his life in a one-
roomed house of divans and silence, of hang-
ing lamps and heavy, burning perfumes. As
the sun goes down he will kneel and turn
towards the tomb that hangs between earth
and Heaven, and in the next batch of suffo-
cating, seasick pilgrims he will go to Mecca.
And you and I will not see him again.”
Miss Gower was leaning on the balustrade
and looking away. It was some time before
she spoke.
“But you can’t assume all this from his
going into that place, Bob, surely?”
Graves said nothing.
“You’re thinking of his mother, I suppose.
But Ted is absolutely white in everything.
He went to the Front, and —oh, everything,
Bob. You can’t be right!”
“Well, I hope I’m not. But listen to this:
Y» hen I took over the Algiers office there was
a man from West Australia who had been
chief clerk here for ten years. Twice the
firm had offered him good' agencies at home,
in Sydney and in Brisbane, and he had
refused them and said he preferred Algiers.
As a rule the men will cut their salaries in
half to get back home after a year of it, but
Cannon refused a good increase in both cases
—he preferred to stay here, he said. When
I had been here three months he ‘went east’
walked out of the office one night and
never came back. He was last seen in a
carpet caravan on his way to Morocco.
Brodie has gone the same road.”
Miss Gower shook herself and laughed
bravely. “Oh you’re just talking! People
don’t drop everything and just fade away
like that. Ted is doing it for excitement.
He will come back—to me,” she added under
her breath.
“Did you ever hear of men going black?”
“I have heard the expression. Why?”
“Do you know what it means?”
“Yes; I think I do.”
“Well, that is what has happened to
Brodie. The life of the Arab is not so
primitive as that of South Sea Islanders—
that’s the only difference.”
Miss Gower’s chin went up, defiantly.
“But that’s dirty, Bob! It’s what a slacker
and a coward would do. Ted will come back
—I am sure of it.”
Graves sighed and stood up. He had done
his best. “Good night, Billy,” he said, “and
a better Christmas to you than I think is
possible.”
“Good night, Bob, and thank you. One
Christmas present will be Ted—come back.”
As the lounge clock struck eleven, Asshe-
ton strolled down the terrace.
“Well,” said Graves, “have you got him?”
“No,” said Assheton, “Good ■ night.”

BACKACHE DAYS and NIGHTS
Do you realise that Pains in the Back, Limbs or Joints, Weak Heart, Irritability,
Languor, Sleeplessness, Dizziness and Urinary Troubles, are symptoms of SERIOUS
KIDNEY WEAKNESS?
Kidney Disease comes on quietly and may take you unawares, for often its
symptoms are put down to other causes —a serious mistake in many cases. Early
symptoms are pain and tenderness in the back and groin, bladder irritation, stiff or
aching limbs, scarcity or excess of urine, reliment, night sweats —chilly, moist or
swollen extremities —drowsiness, blurred sight, dizziness and morbid depression.
For when diseased the kidneys fail to purify the blood, so that uric acid and other
poisonous matter is collecting in the system, causing rheumatism, stone, dropsy, gravel,
sciatica, lumbago and other complications.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a tonic for the kidneys, which they heal and
strengthen, enabling these all-important organs to rid the system of poisonous deposits
that are setting up disease throughout the body. They promote a healthy flow in the
urinary channels, which relieves irritation, soothes the bladder and dissolves stone and
gravel.
Keep the kidneys well and they will keep you well, but you must get the right medicine.
A "WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. L. Wood, 18 Abercrombie Street,
Itedfern, Sydney, says:—“As the result of
my kidneys being out of order I suffered a
lot from backache, and at times was in such
pain that I could hardly move. If I stooped
the agony was almost unbearable, and it was
as much as I could do to stand up straight
again without assistance. Backache is a most
trying ailment, the pain never seems to leave
you day or night; at any rate, that was my
experience. After using all kinds of medi-
cines without deriving any benefit I saw
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised,
and the thought occurred to me to try them.
I got a bottle at once, and by the time I
had finished it I felt ever so much better.
Thus encouraged, I continued taking the
pills, with the result that four bottles cured
me completely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and recom-
mend them to other sufferers with every
confidence.”

A MAN'S CASE.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St.
Peters, Sydney, says : —“For a long time I
suffered from pains in my back. I got little
rest at night and would toss and turn for
hours. I began using Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills and they gave me relief almost
at once, and a course of the remedy com-
pletely banished the pain. They hare proved
a marvellous medicine, for it is eighteen
months since they cured me, and I have
never suffered with my back since. I am
glad to tell others what Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills have done for me.”
Nine years later Mrs. Adams confirms the
above and says:—“My husband's cure has
proved permanent. He has had no return of
backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured him. nearly eleven years ago. He
always keeps a bottle in the house, and takes
a dose now and then ; for he thinks the kid-
neys need a tonic sometimes.”

PILLS
Ibrahim had a string of other names which
were all shortened by the infidel guests of
the Hotel St. Itey into lb. Ib was officially
the porter; in reality he was purely orna-
mental. lie seemed to spend his life stand-
ing stafuesquely in the sun from its rise to
its setting, and no one seemed ever to want
him to work or move.
Miss (lower had spent a practically sleep-
less night. Graves had apparently resigned
himself to an inevitable tragedy. Assheton
and Mitchell knew nothing but the beaten
ttack of club and European haunt in Algiers.
Towards dawn Billy made up her mind: if
these loafing men couldn’t or wouldn’t find
'lied she would find him herself. She sup-
posed it was dangerous and foolish ; but Ted
iiad to be found somehow to-day.
In the porch Ib was sitting in the early
morning sun, sunk in obviously depressing
thought. He stood up as Miss Gower
appeared. An idea occurred to her. Here
was her guide ready-made, and he would
probably be “straight” for the sake of his
situation at the hotel. It needed only a soft
word or two and a promise of gold if they
wore successful. The porter eagerly followed
the girl down the well-kept road of bougain-
vilhvu walls and drooping pepper-trees till
presently lie took the lead, and she
seemed to spend hours toiling through
narrow, noisome streets, full of screaming,
naked black babies and silent, grim grown-
up:. Ib held low-voiced colloquies in an un-
known, tongue in doorways and in court- 1
yards ; and the ‘whole world was clad in white
and stared at the white woman with black
glittering eyes of profound contempt, while’
she waited for the porter. At length Ib began
to walk more quickly and definitely—some
black-faced ghost must at last have said an
illuminating .word. Under the walls of the
Gasbali lie stopped before a hovel of broken
cedar poles and rags; beside the torn mat
that hung where the.door should In* an Arab
sat, looking with unseeing eyes at the pas-
sers-by.
Ib looked carefully at the seated Arab;
finally lie salaamed before him, stood upright
and turned in triumph to Billy ; the gold was
earned. Miss Gower looked at Ib uncertainly
She was not lacking in courage, but it had
been a nervous morning and hitherto Ib had
done all the talking; now lie apparently
wanted her to talk, and she was tired out.
In another ten minutes she would give up
the search and go home, and let Ted find his
own way back. The Arab stared through them
both, deep in” some far, unfathomable dream.
She glanced down at him. It was Ted
Brodie!
“Ted!” she said. “Ted!”
The man’s eyes rested on her for a second,
and lie looked again over the blue Mediter-
ranean waters to the far dream. lie did not
speak.
“Ted,” she said softly, “it’s Billy. Speak
to me, Ted.”
The man still sat in silence, oblivious of
her presence and her voice. She turned to
Ib ; he was standing in statuesque, expression-
less dignity beside her. His work was done;
he waited now for the money. White shadows
seemed to glide out of the lichened walls, like
the ghosts of Haroun A 1 Rashchid’s slaves.
They gathered in a little silent group in the
glare of the road ; other joined them and sur-
rounded the white woman and the figure of
the seated, silent Arab. ?so one spoke, but
an atmosphere of danger, of menace, hung
over the little crowd; the girl felt like a
trapped rabbit. She turned again to lb; but
lb was not now the servant of the infidel —he
was among his own people and one of them.
She might look to "the Casbah walls them-
selves for as much help as lb would give her
here. Her chin went up for the third time ;
she walked quickly to Brodie’s side and sat
down; she put one arm about his shoulders
and spoke in his ear.
' Teddy, come back to us. Leave all this
dirt and savagery and come back!”
Brodie said nothing; he sat quite passive
under the halt-embrace. He seemed not to
hear the words or to care. A low muttering
came from the watching crowd.
‘‘Come back. Teddy. Show me the wounded
hand you got in France.”
Brodie looked at her at last, but with dull,
expressionless eyes; he held out his right
hand, which had only three fingers. She
took it in hers. The muttering in the crowd
seemed to grow in volume.
She put both arms about his shoulders.
Instantly a white figure detached itself from
the murmuring pack. Centuries of harem
teaching were affronted by this shameless-
ness in the open street. A man stood over
the seated couple; suddenly he wrenched
tln> woman free from Brodie —stood her up-
right and hustled her into the ominous
throng. Brodie stood up like a man suddenly
wakened from sleep, with troubled, lustre-
less eyes. “Ted, help me 1 Help !”
Brodie leaped into the mass and caught
the girl in his arms, leaving men on
the moss-covered stones. Down the street
lie ran, carrying his burden through the tor-
tuous alleys of a short cut to the docks.
Knives flashed into the astonished black
hands; a whispering sound of running, slip-
pered feet came rushing on his heels, warn-
ing cries sounded from the doorways as they
passed. But the flight was not stopped.
It was a sane European in regulation
clothes (her purse had paid for the trans-
formation) who escorted a tired and slightly
hysterical young woman back to the hotel an
hour later.
“Been investigating the native quarter,*’
he explained curtly to the silent party. “Yes,
it’s interesting but horribly dirty. Sickens
me rather. T don’t want to gee it again.”

The Rope.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RYAN and Stenlow had been sent into
the ladder shaft of the Old Pioneer at
Wildbee to repair a section of the
ladders that was no longer considered secure.
They had rigged a mere apology of a plat-
form across the shaft, a narrow slab, suffici-
ent for a footing and no more (an ordinary
example of the recklessness of workers in
the presence of dangers with which they are
familiar) and were fairly on the job when
20ft. of the ladders they were operating upon
carried away, taking the candles too. and

rately to the flimsiest support in a black
shaft, the bottom of which was over JUOtt.
below, and the surface 300 ft. above, and the
swollen centres so close and greasy with
slime that they offered no more grip than so
much buttered glass. Presently Stenlow
spoke out of the impenetrable blackness.
“Are you all right, Mike?" .
“I dunnaw ! I dunnawßyan replied in
a voice scarcely above a whisper and shaky
with terror.
“For God's sake, man, don t funk on it.
Stenlow cried. .
“I dunnaw! I dunnaw V y was Kyan s only
reply, and presently be began to whine like
a frightened dog. “I’m done fer ! I’m undone
man! Blessed saints, help a poor man .
Stenlow could hear the click of his chatter-
ing teeth in the intervals between his own
shrill halloos for help. Presently the brace-
man’s voice came faintly down the shaft,
giving re-assurance.
“They’ll come down the hauling shaft; and
break through the centres,” Stenlow said
encouragingly. “Just hang on.”
“I can’t; I can’t do it. I’m goin’. I'm
goin’. Jim !”
His faint cries became more piteous and
hopeless. Suddenly Stenlow leaned as far
forward as he dared from his side or the
shaft.
“For the love of Heaven, Mike, pull your-
self together,” he said. “Lean back against
the slabs, and hang on to this.”
He steadied Ryan with one hand, and
thrust a rope between the man’s fingers, top-
pling precariously himself. Mike leaned back
on the wall of the shaft, against which a
man’s back might slide like lard on a hot
board, and he became silent.
“Are you all right now, Mike?” Stenlow
asked.
The answer came in a faint whisper. “Yes,
yes. Glory be to God, yes !”
“A few minutes more,” said Stenlow.
“They’re in the next shaft.”
Six minutes later two men, working on
top of the cage in the hauling shaft, broke
down a couple of centres, and Billings, the
shift boss, grabbed Ryan just in time, for
that individual by the light of tin l .candles
had seen that the rope he held in his hands
so desperately was a piece Stenlow had put
in his pocket to caulk a leaky joint in one of
the pump lifts. It was attached to nothing,
and was just, nine inches long.

To the Unborn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I suppose you had heard of George being killed in
France. His poor wife is near her time.”
—Letter extract.
LIGHT that sang highest when Love’s
throne was set —
Love, aspirant and yearning for the
wing,
Stir thee to see the earth’s green carcanet,
And hear through aisles of bloom the call of
Spring ;
Grateful be ye as in its grave of clay,
The seed thanked that which bade it bloom
to-day.
“God made man in his image,” as men say;
But mother-love, to keep her child from
shame,
Love in his image makes by night and day.
And to her darkness sends both pride and
flame;
Feasting on the world's beauty, that the eyes
Of thee shall find on earth thy paradise *
Changing to worship, fear ; soft flesh to steel;
Building a clean child with no thought
unclean ;
Bearing the cruel pangs that mothers feel.
Holding high thought that thou shalt not be
mean;
Easier it were to die, and thee betray.
She stares down Death until he looks away.
Night-voices, reverent, reticent and calm
Tell thee of beauty that can never die;
Under the Song of Earth Life sings bis
psalm;
Bring tliou the music in thy memory.
Linking the chain of other worlds; the when
Thou shalt break through into this world of
men.
Life that, for its high aim, holds safe the
woman—
Deep-breasted mother and the nursing wife—
For that new hidden thing that shall be
human;
Child that is roof-tree of the House of Life;
That he shall know the lesson and the rule.
His mother learns long patience in her school.
Life is, to thee, pillar of flame by night;
Love is, to thee, pillar of cloud by day;
And to thy gloom thy mother sends aright.
Scent of the flowers that wait to show thv
way;
And thou, from space, her self-made wage,
self-paid—
The young soul prisonered in Love’s tran-
sient raid.
In thee, flesh and the soul meet soul and
flesh;
Form into substance stamped; light wed to
heat; •
Spirit entangled in incarnate mesh,
With red desire, a poppy in the wheat;
These all are thine —life’s chalice for thy fill.
When dawn shall open doors of daffodil.
Or from the ocean whose wave laves that
strand
Where, at a madman’s bidding, men do slay:
Come, thou Unborn! Unto our sorrowing
land,
Where the sad, waiting mother grieves to-
day ;
Make landfall soon —the quiet sea a-swoon,
The sails hang silver-heavy to the moon.
Child of this Summer and the centuries!
Woven of Now and Ever in love’s loom,
Here wait while sunlight, green grass and
green trees.
And, clean as thou shalt be, the apple-bloom;
To write thine history on a virgin page;
And, ill or well, to rule thine heritage.
And some brave spirit, fallen in the fight.
May, in thy birth, find life again a boon:
May, through thy vision, see again the light.
And, in thee, haply, glow again at noon.
Haste then, to resurrection ! Waiting thee
Are the kind land and the majestic sea.
QUEENSLAND.

Tkc Medicine for You
must possess certain advantages without which it would hardly commend
itself to your confidence. It must be perfectly safe under all circumstances.
It must be mild in its action but none the less efficacious on that account.
It must be, par excellence, a family medicine, that is, suitable for
old and young of both sexes and be freely obtainable in town or
country. It must be easy to take, regular and reliable in its curative
effects and possess a great and genuine record of success. Such a
medicine is Beecham’s Pills which still hold, and will continue to hold,
the highest position in popular favour. It is very interesting, after so
many years service, still to find Beecham’s Pills “at the top of the
tree ” among digestive remedies. They ar ■ everywhere acknowledged
to be unrivalled in the treatment of such troubles as biliousness, sick
headache, heartburn, constipation, giddiness, failing appetite, poorness
of blood and a general run-down condition. If you are in any way a
sufferer from digestive ailments take
Bccchaw’s pills
BEECHAM’S PILLS are specially suitable £of females of all ages*
