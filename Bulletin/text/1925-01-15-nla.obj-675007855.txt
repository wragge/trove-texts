Luther's Devil
Probably Luther’s personal Devil merely
represented his wretched health. There is
an excellent description of it in Hartmann
and Grisar’s monumental Life of Luther;
and Dr. CabanCs has reviewed it in the light
of modern medicine in an essay of which a
prdcis was published in the St. Louis “Uio-
logic and Cutaneous Review” for November,
1924. Also Dr. W; W. Ireland reviewed
50 years ago in his book, “The Blot Up<
the Brain.” But Ireland did not allow sufl
ciently for Luther’s physical illness. A
that we can do here is to go over once mo
what has already been done.
Luther from the age of 27 used to suff
from terrible attacks of noises in the beat
giddiness and fainting fits; sometimes 1
would even fall from his stool in one of tl
attacks of giddiness, and work was impo
sible. Towards middle life he seems to hav
become intepsely neurasthenic, doubtle
from his sufferings and fighting. As
grew older he became very deaf. All thes
symptoms, combined with the noises in th
head which so constantly affected him, seei
to point to some trouble in the inner ear
what is called MSnibre’s disease of the laby
rinth. This is a disease of middle lif
though it occasionally attacks the youn„
It probably added its tragedy to Dean Swift
already tragic life.
While Luther was already so frightful!
afflicted, his savage contention with the Pop
was going on, and from time to time h
would be attacked by pains over th
region of the heart, with attacks of breatl
lessness and fear of death. It must not b
thought that he broke from the Pope witliou
desperate mental agony and struggles wit
his Devil (that is to say, spiritual strug
gles) ; for undoubtedly, rough and contei
tious though he certainly was, Luther actec
entirely from what he thought to be con
scientious motives, and his mental struggle
probably affected his health in other way
that we shall see when we come to view him
a-dying.
It is easy to laugh at his famous egotis
tical prayer to his God; but it become
rather pathetic if we remember that h
really thought that he stood in the presenc
of the living God, in whose interests he hac
embarked upon so terrible a struggle; whom
he looked upon as the only friend that li
had left, since the Pope could never possibl
make peace with him, so long as Luthe
was Luther, and Pope Pope. Nowadays,
this age of science, we have lost that sens
of being in touch with God, and it is doubt
ful whether the world will ever recover it
but at least we can try to understanc
Luther’s- infinite struggles before he too!
the mighty step which so changed the world
Although he does not seem to have actu
ally suffered from gout, undoubtedly he wa
of the gouty diathesis, and suffered from
uric acid, which, circulating in his blood
would probably add to the gloom of hi
already gloomy * temperament—manic-depres
sive, as I have said. And probably it had
a great deal to do with his Meniere’s disease
Those who still look upon Luther as
sort of gentle monk who was driven into
revolt by rage against indulgences and the
sins of the Papacy should read his Table
talk to see what he really was. And pro
bably, after reading that book, they wil
come to the conclusion that the Pope was
as much sinned against as sinning; for
violence of language and intolerance no
modern theologian could possibly have ex-
celled Martin Luther. Much of the angei
felt by the Papacy against Luther was en-
tirely his own fault, for. never was there a
more violent and intolerant man. Nowa-
days, when burning has gone so much out
of fashion, it seems ridiculous that any man
could so work himself up into a passion* about
things that no person could possibly know;
but there is the fact that they did in those
times. Indubitably much of the intolerance
shown by everybody during the Reformation
was owing to the extraordinary violence of
the great Protestant reformer; and one can
most mercifully explain that violence by
remembering that he was constantly ill of
almost distressing complaint. His gout and
his violent emotions, together with the con-
stant pain and giddiness from hig ear-disease,
had probably sent up his blood-pressure,
winch showed itself by almost constant pain
and distress in the region of the heart! that
seem to have almost reached the stage of
angina pectoris.
It may be true that he once threw a pot
of ink at the Devil, for the mark is still
shown; but it appears to be certainly true
that he attributed to the Devil everything
which he did not understand ; that is to say,
he was totally ignorant of natural science.
Rven the howling of the wind in a great
storm was to Luther a fixed and certain
surety of the actual voice of his Satanic
Majesty. In course of time Luther became
quite friendly with his Devil, and once at
the Castle of Wartburg when he heard a
great noise on the stairs which woke him
up he called out, “Is it thou, Devil Well
be it so!” and recommending himself to the
Lord Jesus Christ he returned to bed. The
noises were probably in his own ears.
The death of Luther, in 1546, was compara-
tively sudden, and has for some extraordi-
nary reason been attributed by Hartmann
and Grisar to apoplexy; but Caban&s is far
more likely to be right when he attributes
it to heart-failure following on long-continued
high blood-pressure. I quote directly from
Caban&s:—
A letter which Luther wrote to Melanchthon four
days before his death makes known to us his desper-
ate condition at this date. From day to day his
sufferings increasing, he hastened to arrange the
differences which divided the Counts of Mansfield.
His att a cks of vertigo and headache recurred; he
attributed them to the closure of a sinus in his
leg On Sunday Feb. 14, 1546, he suffered in-
tensely, and on the following Wednesday he was
nearly spent In the evening after dinner he
complained of the old oppressive feeling in the chest •
he ate moderately and went to bed earlier than was
his wont. Hardly had he got into bed than the
terrible oppression and fear of death returned One
of the watchers by the bedside suggested* some
medicine, which he ran to get.
And Luther got off to sleep; but early in
the morning his real Devil awakened ‘him
again—-not the imaginary Devil of his super-
stitious fears, but his real genuine devil of
angina pectoris, which is one of the worst of
devils and far worse than any fanciful devil
imagined by a superstitious church. It is
strange that the leader of the movement
which ultimately broke away from Papal
dogma and got us on the road to science and
rationalism should have been the most super-
stitious and arrogant of men —one who was
actually ranked among the criminal classes
of great men by the late Dr. Whitby. How-
ever, be that as it may, Luther again awak-
ened with his Devil clutching at his heart
and in the most deathly fear. “My God, I
do feel so ill!” he ejaculated; “I feel as
if I were dying.” He became unconscious;
his doctors found him pulseless and bathed
in a cold sweat; he seemed to have ceased
to breathe. Presently there was a last
flicker, and his breathing assumed the up-
and-down character that we know as
Cheyne-Stokes, so that some of the sighs be-
came audible. Then, after two deep sighs,
he died, and the Papacy was for a time left
untroubled by the most virulent enemy that
it ever had. But only for a time; for we
owe it to Luther that a doctor in Sydney
is now able to discuss scientific truth and let
the medieval church go hang.

The Story of Anzac
The second volume of “The Official His-
tory of Australia iu the War,” which com-
prises the story of Anzac from May, 1915,
to the Evacuation, will be welcomed by
readers of the first volume who then became
acquainted with C. E. W. Bean’s qualities
as historian. It is not too much to say that
in The Story of Anzac (Angus and Robert-
son) he has combined the two gifts which
made Kinglake’s “History of the War in the
Crimea” a classic—the one the gift of order
and accuracy; the other of literary present-
ment and picturesque setting.
At the beginning of May, 1915, both the
forces Which had landed a week earlier on
the Gallipoli Peninsula had secured a foot-
hold, but a foothold only. Neither had ap-
proached its objective. Opposing the ad-
vfince from Holies stood Krithia, in front of
which Turkish trenches had already begun to
spread across the Peninsula. Hamilton’s new
decision was to make use of all his available
strength, break through this incomplete line
and advance to Achi Baba before the Turks
had brought up sufficient reserves to prevent
mm. Birdwood, under instructions, withdrew
from Anzac the 2nd Brigade, commanded by
Col. McCay, and the M.L. infantry. The men
embarked were safely landed at Helles, and
on May 5 the new advance began. As day-
light faded three days later Hamilton real-
ised that his great effort had failed. The two
Anzac brigades were relieved from the line
on the night of May 11 and returned to
their own/force a week later.
Mr. Bean then turns to the position at
Anzac, and goes fully into the difficulties
which there presented themselves to those in
command:—
Fiom the first day the proximity of the opposing
fronts m the two central sections forced the Aus-
tralian and M.L. Army Corps to engage in an un-
ceasing struggle to extend its foothold. This had
been established in the Battle of the Landing by
a line of men who simply lay exposed on the crest
by day and dug in by night; but, when once most
o*a 0 * a j.£ rencd l ln e had been dug and communication
cut through to it, almost all further extensions
were made by sapping; that is to say, by working
trom inside the extending trenches. At such places as
Quinn’s, Courtney’s, Pope’s and Steele’s the foot-
hold was at first so slight that, while the men in
the firing-line occupied a trench a few yards beyond
the crest, the supports were maintained on the slope
immediately behind it. There they remained day
and night, repeatedly, on the receipt of alarms
hxing bayonets and preparing to rush over the
summit to meet the enemy as he advanced, or to
drive him out of the front trench if he should have
taken it. But early in May the sapheads, which
were pushed out from all parts of the front, began
to be joined laterally to form a new and advanced
front line, the old front trench becoming now the
support trench. Thus not only were the early
rifle-pits transformed into a deep and practically
continuous line, but in most parts a new front trench
began to extend parallel to and a few yards in
advance of it, with numerous short communication
trenches like the rungs of a ladder connecting the
This gives a very lucid picture of the posi-
tion of the Anzac garrison early in May.
The task of the opposing parties was one of
strategy in a war of trenches. The author
describes the difficulties that had to be over-
come with the Australian and M.L. artil-
lery. When nearly two weeks had elapsed
since the Landing, less than half the guns
of the army .corps were in use, the remainder
being still unshipped. And the artillery that
came to hand was unsuitable for the rugged
Anzac area. _ The field-gun was primarily
a weapon designed to destroy men and not
defences, excellent perhaps in the open area
at Helles. but unsuited to the conditions at
Anzac. The vivid narrative Mr. Bean gives
of the problems that confronted the Anzacs
such as that of Monasli Valley; of dramatic
incidents, such as the break into Quinn’s?
following the crushing defeat of the Turkish
attack of May 19 and the ejectment of
the enemy, of the multiple operations in June
and July, affords a very comprehensive view
of the tremendous task the Anzac forces
had been set to accomplish.
Of the fighter side of the campaign in
Gallipoli, if war may be said to have a
lighter side, Mr. Bean gives us some vivid
pictures:—
When the struggle of the Landing had subsided,
the beach on summer days reminded many on!
lookers of an Australian coastal holidav-place The
shorehne itself resembled rather an old-time port
with its crowded barges (often beached to prev'-nt
their being sunk), a few short piers, piles of biscuit
of X t e a S r a nf °i der s . tack f ed behind, the smell of rope-
of tar, of wet wood, of cheese and other cargo • but
in the water the hundreds of bathers ami ™
hillside the little tracks winding through the low
« Cn £’ w r i eSlStlbly recalled th e Manly of New
South Wales or the Victorian Sorrento! while the
sleepy “tick-tock” of rifles from behind the hills
suggested the assiduous practice of batsmen at their
nets on some neighboring cricket field.
From the story of the local struggle of
f troops, burrowed into a few acres
of Gallipoli hillside, the historian carries
I.™ °_ n to th e plan for a second offensive.

The Overland Sports Special
“Whitey //,"
Sweeps the Board
at Penrith, N.S.W., Speedway Carnival!
Remarkable performances have been known to have been made on Racing
Tracks throughout Australia, but here is yet another proof of Overland Speed
and Consistency.
In competition with the fastest Cars in New South Wales, the Overland Sports, driven by Mr.
D. Harkness, accomplished a greater record than ever by completely outclassing the fastest
cars in New. South Wales in every event at the Penrith Motor Speedway Carnival at Sydney
on New Year’s Day.
THE OVERLAND SPORTS SPECIAL WON EVERY
CAR EVENT ON THE PROGRAMME.
But read these amazing results:
The Overland referred to is a Special Sports Model, and differs only from the famous Model 91
inasmuch is it is fitted with overhead Valves, high-pressure lubricating system, two Miller
Carburetters and a Noonan (Willys-Knight representative) head. All reciprocating parts,
connecting rods, pistons, etc., are standard, but machined down to secure lightness, as is usually
the case in all sports models or racing cars.
These performances serve to demonstrate the wonderful speed and endurance of the Overland.

Hamilton’s disposal, and the first step was
to determine how to employ these with most
effect. Then followed the landings at Suvla
Bay, a surprise packet for the Turks, the
splendid attack on Lone Pine and the night
advance of the Anzacs on Sari Bair. It was
the critical period of the whole campaign, and
it even looked as if victory were in sight;
but
On the northern flank of Anzac the Suvla landing
force was not yet in touch with Anzac troops.... On
the southern flank the struggle at Lone Pine was
raging more furiously than ever. In the centre
the greatest effort of the campaign, intended to open
the Dardanelles and secure the almost unlimited
results of that achievement, had been launched but
had not succeeded in the first rush as planned. The
fronts at Helles, Lone Pine and The Nek had held
open the coastline of Sari Bair until the morning
of Aug. 7, but the assaulting columns had failed to
reach the summits during that precious interval.
It was victory punctuated with “buts” ;
nevertheless the attack had altered the posi-
tion so materially that success was still in
view. The climax in the campaign was
reached at Chunuk Bair, held for a little
time, only to be yielded up again to an
irresistible assault by the Turks. So ended
the main thrust of the August offensive: that
it did not succeed Mr. Bean attributes not
to the senility of the leadership at Suvla Bay,
or the inexperience of the troops, but largely
to causes which lie deeper in the mentality of
the British people. “An enterprise such as
that of Suvla demanded more than the ability
to follow; it required that each man, or at
least a high proportion of the force, should
be able to lead ; and the necessary quality
of decision, which even a few years’ emanci-
pation from the social restrictions of the Old
World appeared to have bred in the emi-
grant, was—to colonial eyes—flacking in the
Suvla troops.”
This effort practically ended the campaign,
and the volume closes with a graphic de-
scription of the admirably contrived con-
ditions under which the evacuation was so
successfully carried out. The volume is
liberally illustrated, not only with full-page
photographic reproductions but by inset
plans which elucidate the text.

In a Literary Garden
In the Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, by
Frank Clarke (Robertson and Mullen), is
an adventure in literature as much as an
exposition in botany. It is for bookfellows
more than for gardeners, grandly for those
who are both. President of the Legislative
Council of Victoria, the author (helped by
Professor Strong) shows himself an essayist
who knows and feels that “a thing of beauty
is a joy for ever,” whether of life or of art.
He weaves myth, history and philosophy into
his prettily-done apotheosis. Even politics
and sports are not tabu. Clarke sees and
delightfully sees
Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in everything.
To him “there is nothing to equal the Gar-
dens in all Australia, nor in Europe either,
for here the snow plants and the palms
flourish side by side, and the hothouse
cineraria germinates in the open at the time
that the maples redden.” We learn that
“Guilfoyle made the Gardens what they are
.... Paderewski said of him that he did with
his trees what a pianist tried to do with his
music... .His sole monument is an oak, as
lie would have wished.”
After reading their “history, art and de-
sign, with stories of the trees,” as Clarke
charmingly but never cheaply presents them,
one is ready to endorse the opinion that the
Gardens “are the rarest thing in all broad
beloved Australia.” (Down, Sydney, down!)
Here is a guide-book that isn’t, but serves
better. It is the account of a favored stroll
made full of flavor by the author’s enthusi-
asm and learning. Seven short chapters deal
with lakes and lawns (and anything else
handy), and there are 12 beautiful pictures,
one of them “the old bed of the Yarra,” fas-
cinatingly gossiped on, and “past Baron von
Mtiller’s old house.” The incidental in-
formation is ravishing. On the lakes scared
wild duck notably increase during the shoot-
ing season. This begins on February 15, and
about the 11th the ducks come to the Gar-
dens. Reason or instinct? There are 130
varieties of birds. “Nestling cuckoos have
phosphorescent patches on their palates that
the old birds coming with food from the glare
to the gloom of the nest interior may make
no mistake about their gape.” On July 1,
1851, a public meeting beneath an old red-
gum congratulated itself on Separation—
hence Separation Tree. Once an oak-tree
brought £675. “The oak is the tree of great-
ness for all the nations.” “William the Con-
queror liked well to do justice under an oak
you may see to ! this day in Windsor Park.”
And “There is, after all, no tree history that
means so much to human kind as that of
Quercus robur (the English oak) if freedom
be the theme, for it has borne a part in all
that freedom means.”
Romance is near the saunterer all the
while. Robin Hood, Domesday Book, old
china, animism are cheek-by-jowl with
Melba, color-schemes, flower-harmonies,
Baconian theory and—jokes. “Mr. Hughes,
the Prime Minister, in an after-dinner speech
to a medical congress, once said, ‘We poli-
ticians make a mistake and you howl it from
the housetops, you never forget it; you doctors
make a mistake and you bury it.’ ” Of
plants the running commentary is as pleas-
ing as it is informing. Of the sacred lotus
—“which to the Buddhist is what the Cross
is to Christians” —we have several pages end-
ing in this piece of self-revelation: “But I
know of no religion save Buddhism that takes
the view that individual survival of death is
to be avoided if possible; that continuance
is punishment, and euthanasia the desirable
goal of life. May it not be in man’s growing-
soul ultimately the universal wish, most in-
spiring because least selfish?” The papyrus
—“our word ‘paper’ is directly derived from
‘papyrus’ ” —inspires thoughts of the Nile,
trackless marshes, Tutankhamen and Egyp-
tian paper-making. Of the ki-ris we learn
that “their dark lilac flowers are one of the
heraldic insignia of the Mikado.” Here is
a moderner touch: “The bananas, by the
way, are becoming acclimatised, and propa-
gate of their own accord in the Gardens.
They have, surely, the largest leaves in the
vegetable world. I measured one leaf with
the eye to be eight feet long and two feet
broad, but they have the terrible defect of
splitting into ragged ribbons under the lash-
ing of our winds, and in winter the frost
makes scarecrows of them.” There is a neat
eulogy of the despised ti-tree and an out-
burst against “rotten round beds on lawns,”
with this theorem: “A lawn is a lawn, a park
a park, and a landscape a landscape.”
Some interesting obiter dicta: “Modernise
the spelling in our arbitrary way, and you
will realise we inherit, willy-nilly, an old,
old tonguq with old, old, good freedoms and
starknesses in our blood that might explain
a lot to kings like John and Charles
and Philip of Spain. to Napoleons,
Kaisers and Bolsheviks.”... .“The loss of
Verbrugghen was the greatest setback that
Australian musical culture ever experienced.
An extra £5OO a year and a little more en-
couragement would have kept him. He was
not only a supremely great conductor, but
was, in addition, a dynamic personality as an
organiser and teacher.”...'. “I never knew a
man yet succeed in the strenuous battle of
life who allowed himself to stop and dream
during working hours.” Of a particular
lawn (the Hopetoun) : “The best growths on
it are the healthy people who come on Satur-
day and Sunday afternoons to listen to the
band, and to give their souls an airing.”
In this monograph one gets nearer to the
human Clarke than via Hansard. Let
loose in his Gardens he is almost as Vol-
tairian in his soil-emotions as is. Candide.
Enthusiast and artist, his walk is to him
what the library was to Anatole Frances
superb scholar of d’Esparvieu.
R. S. ROSS.
The Island of Slaves
Forty years ago, when the highbrowsers
of Britain, led by William Archer, began
to champ noisily in the rather rank pastures
of Scandinavian culture, one fed-up Philis-
tine revolted. He wrote, in protest, a story
of an intelligent youth who, finding he
could do no good in the tongue of his English
fathers, invented a culture and a literature
hitherto unheard of—that of Esthonia. He
also invented a great deceased Esthonian
writer and translated his works into English
with appropriate introductions and foot-
notes. Since there were none in those days
to say him nay, or to criticise the merits of
his translations and researches, his fame
became great and his shekels many. But,
in this late day, fact has overtaken fiction.
The White Ship, Esthonian Tales by Ainos
Kallas, translated from the Finnish by Alex.
Watson (Jonathan Cape), makes that very
certain. It is a collection of 18 short stories
of Esthonia which, as John Galsworthy, who
has written a foreword to them, says, “are
a new dish —of a strange flavor and coming
close to primal things.”
Ainos Kallas is the Finnish wife of an
Esthonian, and these stories come to us
twice translated. But, just as the attar
in its transfer from still to phial loses some-
thing but not all of its savor, so these
strange stories of a little known race come
to us with an unforgettable tang of truth
and simplicity. The Esthonians have dwelt
between the devils and the deep sea—in
their case Russia, Prussia and the Baltic—
for 1500 years. Originally a wild and
warlike pagan people, they were converted
to Christianity with fire and sword by the
Teutonic knights in the thirteenth century,
lor seven centuries on, their lands par-
titioned among their conquerors, Teutonic
knights, Swedes, Poles, Danes and Russians
in turn, they have been a nation of slaves.
Through this long night they have kept the
lamp of nationhood alight, and so strong
and enduring is the national fibre that the
foundation of the Esthonian Republic in
1019 found the race willing and able to take
up and maintain its task. When they passed
under the rule of the Teutonic knights they
became slaves in all the feudal sense of the
word. They remained in that condition for
700 years, till in 1862 Russia was forced to
abolish serfdom, and the Esthonian was again
allowed to own his own land and to s*o
about his own occasions. In that long inter-
val, his manor lords had right of pit and
lash and gallows over him, of forced labor
from him and his women, and over these last
the droit du seigneur.
The stories themselves are, says the
authoress, almost all based on actual inci-
dents. To understand some of them it is as
well to remember that in the long history of
Esthonian oppression, every century at least
has been marked by a bloody and fruitless
uprising of the unconquered people—the last
was as late as 1905. Most of the stories
are of the Island of Slaves, Saaremaa, a
wild and poor land bordering the Baltic,
yielding scanty crops of rye, ill watered
and treeless. There is that of Gertrude
Carponai, who, a baron’s daughter, found
herself in the time of the Black Death left
alone in all Saaremaa with a young peasant,
and with him set about the duty of re-
peopling the land. Seven years after, when
civilisation and the church returned, their
five sons were baptised on the same day
and the highborn Gertrude had to sit for
three Sundays on the bench for immodest
women ere she was forgiven and married
to the father of her children. But she
“had lived through a world hiddefi since the
days of Paradise from men; a world with-
out grades of value, without caste or class,
a world with two lovers dwelling in it
alone.” “A Bathsheba of Saaremaa” is
the story of a young wife whose husband is
drafted to the Russian army. She goes to
the Lord of the Manor for a letter like that
which Uriah the Hittite bore to Joab, and
herself gives it tjo her husband. “The
Wedding” is a chronicle “of village feast-
ing interrupted by the Jus primae noctis.
As evening falls, her father and her mother
send for the young bride. “Thou
art ordered to the manor for to-night.”
“Mother—and thou?” she questioned. “Thou
art neither the first nor last, my child,” her
mother said between her tears. “Couldst
thou take me back —after that?” she asks
her husband. Suddenly the man bent for-
ward, his lips moving. “Couldst thou dare?”
“I dare,” she answered as silently. “But
with what shall I?” the girl said. “With
this,” the man replied, drawing the knife
from his belt. “The Sacrifice” is a poig-
nant story of a village leper self-immolated
for his fellows’ sake, and “Alien Blood”
tells of a shipwrecked foreign sailor and his
passing love for Peet. who became “the
foremother of a dark-skinned race in whose
veins throbbed a hotter, bolder blood, call-
ing them to distant seas and ventures.”
The last rebellion, in 1905, is chronicled in
“The Death of Org,” the old pensioned cow-
keeper, who goes to the rescue of his beloved
kine in the great new cowshed set on fire
by the insurgent peasants, and perishes hor-
ribly in a welter of flame and maddened
cattle. “The White Ship,” which gives its
name to the series, is a story of the strange
religious hysteria which has often been a
feature of Esthonian history. Men, women
and children, giving up homes, possessions,
wives, husbands and parents, flock to the sea-
shore in thousands to await the coming of
a White Ship which is to bear them to the
Isles of the Blest. They wait in hourly,
daily, weekly expectation till starvation, ex-
posure and disease bring disillusionment,
Then those that are left go back to what
is left to them.
The series is of a remarkably even quality,
and, though the atmosphere is always the
same, the stories vary infinitely in treatment,
Through them runs more than a hint of the
remorseless march of Greek tragedy, and
often something of that pathetic endeavor
to make the best of a bad business that
marks the strongest work of Henry Lawson,
Some people may object to that juxtaposi-
tion, but the Masters and Lawson sometimes
glimpsed the same light, even if from widely
differing points.
J. B. HIGGINSON.
Edmund Fisher
Before I made my home in Melbourne
Edmund Fisher was known to me only by
his work; in the days when I, too, had a
fear of what critics might say, and a greater
fear that they might not say anything at
all, I heard of him always spoken of amongst
my fellow-actors as the surest-footed critic in
Australia. Since then I have met Edmund
Fisher everywhere: a man whose memory
lives so strongly must have had a remarkable
personality. He had made such a place
for himself that to a great extent he was
taken for granted; the size of the niche he
filled was only revealed by the gap he left.
“This theatre will never seem the same with
old Edmund Fisher gone,” is typical of the
remarks that are made about him in prac-
tically every “house.” Or suddenly some-
thing that he said years ago is recalled.
About a pretentious mummer, for instance
—“Do you remember what Edmund Fisher
said about him? ‘As an actor he is a poor
clergyman; as a clergyman he would pro-
bably make a good actor.’ ” The whole
theatrical atmosphere is filled with the
memories of the man.
For 41 years The Bulletin gave him the
opportunity to express his critical opinions;
and it is impossible to imagine the man
allowing his pen to give anything but hard-
hitting honesty. His strong judgments would
have impressed themselves upon any journal
for which he worked; but they were what
The Bulletin wanted. Once, after a series
of fearless criticisms whose truthfulness was
particularly hurtful, a demand was made by
the management that Fisher should be with-
drawn. Of course, he was not withdrawn ;
and it is significant that the present repre-
sentatives of the management which felt so
affronted speak the most regretfully about
his passing.
Sincerity was the hallmark of all he wrote.
His criticism was frequently biting, but it
was always scrupulously fair, and was never
strained to score effect. He had a kindly
readiness to make allowances, or to recog-
nise unadvertised ability. In the course of
his work it came in his way to give assist-
ance in many causes and to many people;
a word of encouragement from him went a
long way. His lielp is remembered by many
—the Melbourne Repertory movement,
amongst others. He bantered its supporters
upon “doing good by stealth,” and assisted
them to a larger publicity for their efforts.
Naturally he had his foibles: his distinc-
tion appeared to make that inevitable. He
was a good deal of a dandy, and in liis per-
sonal as distinct from his literary life he
maintained some sentimentalities that ap-
proached the grotesque. Without being a
pedant, he was a precisian: with strong
opinions about words, their values and their
inflections, he could easily be brought
into an argument by a challenge issued on
his own choice of language. It was his
kindly spirit, his regard for truth —and that
meant also a regard for the right word —
which made him very jealous of his work
and kept him in harness right up to the
time of his death. Sometimes it was neces-
sary that he should have relief, but he
saw to it that it would be only in minor
criticism, fearful lest a harsh word should
be said that was undeserved, a “smayt” twist
given that went beyond honesty, or
that ill-selected language might be im-'
puted to him. Even in the minor criticism
ho almost invariably found some cause for
objection, and the conscientiousness of his
work is shown by the agony he endured to
feel that any unfairness had been inflicted
by a sacrifice of critical veracity to smart
phrasing. He himself could achieve the
clever phrase without forsaking truth; and
his desire that nothing less should be credited
to him drove him to work even in the face
of sickness. Up to the day of his death,
towards the end of the recent grand-opera
season, he was The Bulletin’s Melbourne
critic—its sole critic —and he felt his respon-
sibility.

SHOCK ABSORBER
on its recent record run of 2100 miles from Darwin to Adelaide in 9
days 9 hours.
On arrival at the South Australian capital Birtles stated that he
would never have got through had it not been for the Absorbers.
The Stewart Shock Absorber was chosen because it was known
to be of “Stewart” high quality.
Car distributors everywhere speak highly of it, and for cars fitted
with the popular balloon tyres it has proved itself specially efficient.
Obtainable at £lO/10/- per set of four, £5/5/- per pair, from all accessories dealers, or
from the undermentioned Stewart Service Stations:
Bennett & Wood, Ltd., SYDNEY; Berry & Roche Pty., Ltd., MELBOURNE; Martin
Wilson Bros., Ltd., BRISBANE; Arthur Christian, PERTH; Cornell, Limited, ADELAIDE.
The Stewart differs in design
from all other devices for
absorbing shock. It is not just
a spring and a strap; the shock
is absorbed by means of double
friction discs. There is no possi-
bility of strap breakage, no oil-
ing or greasing is ever neces-
sary, nothing to rattle or
squeak.
The Stewart
Shock Absorber
is furnished with
a wrench which

enables the car-owner to adjust
the absorber to suit his own

A windmill turning in the rain,
Backwards and forwards and round again,
With clanking anus that strive and strain.
Across the muddy road from me,
A wet tin roof and chimneys three
As red as polished porphyry.
Tall poplars past the ice-black flags,
Round-shouldered in the wind, like hags
Trembling in all their tattered rags.
A waggon splashing up the road,
With silver milk-cans safely stowed;
A burly man upon the load.
Greyness that gathers like a tide
And drowns the plains immense and wide:
Greyness without —greyness inside !
My thoughts that turn with gusty pain,
Driven around and back again,

These things will always gladden me:

Young girls, a lilac-lighted tree
Quivering in sunlight joyously.
Dawn like a golden-sandalled girl
Treading dim beaches while waves curl
Round her light ankles and unfurl
In glimmerings of green and pearl.
Books that hold ’twixt their glamored leaves
Strange dreamings golden as the sheaves
In Elfland garnered; starry eves
And the embroidery mo<rnlight weaves.

Into the twilight melts away
Through tender rose; and—sweet to say—

The Swans’ Haunt.
At Dccwhy when the sea sends in
A velvc.t nor’-east breeze
That stirs Ae wine-red swampside flowers
And honeysuckle trees,
The passer-by on road or rail,
Beneath the gleaming moon
Or glowing sun, may see swan-hosts
Upon the wide lagoon.
Like higli-prowed craft that cruised the seas,
Far-ranging, long ago,
Beaked ships long- sunk beneath the waves,
They wander to and fro;
Or. called by distant waterways,
In sable squadrons rise,
And southward wing or westward wing,
Down-sending farewell cries.
A snake-like line, a sinuous line,
The strongest in the lead,
Above the smoke of seaside towns
Through smokeless skies they speed;
A changing line, a swaying line
O’er height and beach and bay,
A phalanx now, a crescent now,
They take their airy way.
Where, wandering through she-oak trees
The night-wind softly croons,
Far ■waters give them welcoming,
Lone coves and still lagoons;
Down-wheeling, circling swiftly down,
A noiseless host, they glide
On water-wastes by tides made sweet,
And wastes that know no tide.
West-heading, west-away go some,
Necks craned, with sable breasts ;
Macquarie’s marshes they shall haunt,
There build their reedy nests;
There shall they bide ’neath sun and moon,
Wild water-kin among;
There guard and guide in gloom and glow
Their shy and whimpering young.
But ever, ever hieing home,
They journey late or soon,
O’er spacious plains and rugged heights
To Deewhy’s still lagoon.
Is it the winds that call them back,
Soft stirring frond and leaf?
Or can it be the midnight waves
That thunder on Long Reef?

Elegy.
I belong to nowhere —
Where do yon belong?
Once I loved a lady
And put her in a song.
First we loved with laughter,
Then we loved with tears;
And that’s the way a life goes—
Oh the years, the years!
I’m for sun and sea-liglit.
Do you seek them too?
If there’s azure ever,
Then her eyes were blue.
Say there’s precious glinting,
So her hair was gold.
Free the captive future,
For it’s old now, old!
Love’s a pretty poison.
Have you known it fail?
She and I are ghosts now
Haunting an old tale,
Proud as thwarted marble,
Meek as mignonette—
Only the gods are happy;
Only gods forget!

THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 1925.
THE CENSUS OF 1926.
Old Israel took two censuses, one under
Moses about 1490 b.c., and one under David
about 1018 B.c. There was the father of a
row over the second event. Maoriland buys
itself a census every five years, and will
have one in 1926, bar accidents. So will
France, and probably, at least as far as its
white population is concerned, the erratic
S. African Union. It counted its w 7 hite in-
habitants in 1904, 1911, 1918 and 1921.
Germany has its five-yearly count in 1925.
It w 7 ould be a reasonable idea if the Com-
monwealth fell in line w 7 ith Maoriland, and
also held a national audit next year, or, fail-
ing that, a tropical audit. It is a long time
till 1931; and, unless Australia finds a Gov-
ernment which will stand up against this
country’s mostly imported Lenins and Trot-
skys, no Commonwealth, as we know it, may
be here to audit anything in 1931. It is
a trite saying of that fat and fatuous crea-
ture Podsnap Australis that no person
will ever live long enough to see the Aus-
tralian worker go revolutioning; but an in-
creasing suspicion exists that the Australian
worker will soon do, especially about Christ-
mas time, pretty much what his nigger-
drivers, with instructions from Moscow, bid
him do. There is an underlying idea that
the Government suspects possibilities ahead,
but lacks the grit to do anything with its
suspicions. The Australian statistical de-
partment furnishes definite information
wherever it is possible to do so, and remark-
ably accurate estimates to fill the spaces in
between, but there are points regarding
which something more than _ the best
estimates is wanted, and is wanted
before 1931. It is important to know twice
in a decade, and not merely once, just how
fast and how large the handful of huge cities
are growing, how many provincial towns are
decaying, how rapid is the process of decay,
and how much net settlement can be shown for
all the “settlement” loan funds which have
been expended. (The total was over
£53,000,000 at last advices, which advices
are now IS months old; and it was a re-
markable fact that, though much of this
was Federal money, all the outlay was in
the States, and no settlement was done in
the Commonwealth’s own Northern Terri-
tory.) Then it is important to learn whe-
ther large districts are in process
of abandonment as N. S. Wales’s northern
tableland and north-western slope were in
1921. Most of all, it is advisable to
know whether traces of new settlement can
be found in that vast area beyond a line
drawn from about Cooktown (Q.) to about
Geraldton (W.A.), or if the prevailing winds
are obliterating such traces as once existed.
* * V *
When the figures were collected four years
ago the white Australian population was
said to be something like 98 per cent, of
British (including Irish) origin. It wouldn’t
have mattered if the non-British section had
been larger than that, provided the materials
of which it was composed were a desirable
sort; still the position was gratifying. Very
few countries could show a result remotely
comparing with it—certainly not Canada,
which has gathered a curiously mixed lot to
its bosom in addition to the original French
stock of inhabitants. As events are moving
fast it might be well to inquire seriously
(in 1926) how much the British proportion
has diminished, how fast it is diminishing,
what kind of folk the strange new people
are, and where they mostly are. If any
specific part of Australia is in process of
being lost, it is advisable to know what is
lost, and who is finding it. For the nine
months which ended on September 30, 1924,
a considerable immigration was reported, of
which 89 per cent, was set down as British.
The other 11 per cent, was mixed, and that
was hardly a case of living up to the old
standard. During the subsequent three
months the influx of sundries is commonly
supposed to have brisked up wonderfully,
and it includes Macedonians, Maltese and a
cargo from the Suez Canal district, who
arrived in an ancient craft under the flag of
Egypt. While the United States door was
wide open the trouble here with the impe-
cunious riff-raff of Europe and adjacent half-
colored parts was hardly perceptible, and
that Bolshevised Asia which melts into
Europe hadn’t then entered into the calcula-
tion. So the work of keeping Australia
select seemed easy, and consisted mostly in
repression of Ah Sin. Now, Uncle Sam hav-
ing closed his door and gummed a stamp
over the keyhole, Australia’s real troubles
are likely to begin from all manner of new 7
quarters. It has fewer troops to police its
great area than it had 25 years ago, less
credit outside, more traitors inside, and a
less convincing explanation to offer regard-
ing its empty lands than it ever had before.
A census wouldn’t improve the situation, but
it w r ould help to explain what the situation
is.
* # » #
Not only w T ould it be informative to
know 7 , oftener than once in a decade, how 7
many people there are, and what kind of
people they are, and where they are; it is
advisable also to know what they are doing,
apart from living on public loans, and build-
ing a jumble of small branch railways, and
floating bubbly insurance companies, and
selling each other allotments of land and
imported softgoods. According to the offi-
cial record the quantity of all sorts of
things produced in 1922 was less than that
of any of the seven years 1907-1913, and
also less than in 1915 and 1922. The value
(in paper money after gold went out of cir-
culation) w r as certainly larger in the latter
years even though the quantity was less, but
as the price of the things Australia bought
rose just as fast as the price of the things
it sold, there w r as no joy in that. To have
more people and more machinery and less
results is an unlucky anachronism. It
suggests a steady increase in the unproduc-
tive classes, to w 7 hich the loan boom policy
would naturally lead. If the Commonwealth,
despite its anxiety to know more and oftener
about all these matters, considers that it
can’t afford to shout itself two whole censuses
in a decade, it should at least have a careful
and elabomte stocktaking of Tropical Aus-
tralia in 1926 and 1936 and the subsequent
“sixes.” That luckless land of absentee
Governments clamors for frequent investiga-
tion.
THE SLAVE’S OUTLOOK.
When the Roman legions withdrew from
Britain and Gaul the people of those coun-
tries were left almost entirely at the mercy
of raiders from the Teutonic lands. Those
raiders were no new peoples who had sud-
denly occupied the Roman frontier to secure
a base for their attack. They had been there
during all the centuries of Roman occupa-
tion and for many centuries before; but
before the wars of Julius and the com-
pleted conquests of ojther leaders Gaul and
Britain had been able to hold their own
against their ancient foe. It w T as the 400 years
of security under the shadow of the imperial
eagles that sapped the defensive strength of
these lands and left them at the mercy of
small bands of invaders far lower in civilisa-
tion than their ow r n people. Reliance upon
somebody else to keep murder aw'ay from
the front gate had created a habit so strong
that even in the face of the Overwhelming
ruin that rushed upon them there was no
serious effort put forth to avert disaster.
It was not that the Gauls and Britons had
lost the courage they once showed under
Yercingetorix and Caradoc, for the con-
tinuance of that courage was hmply shown
in their descendants; it was merely that the
habit of taking shelter could’ not be all at
once broken. The world had seemed alto-
gether too safe while the CLesars ruled; it
was impossible to think of that mighty con-
centration of protective force as having sud-
denly broken down. Their ease was exactly
parallel to that of other races of men who,
having lived constantly by the sword and
knowing that every hour brought its murder,
were unable to accept peace or understand
it. With them the habit of bloodshed was
too strong; they were accustomed to recog-
nise death as the only means of life.
* * * #
The world to-day lias a good many
settled habits of thought which twist its
eyes away from a fair and square gaze at
realities. The habit of security in certain
lands like England and France was rudely
disturbed by the recent war, but not entirely
broken. There are, in fact, almost as many
people now who believe that another war on
a grand scale is impossible as there were in
the early months of 1914. But there is an-
other habit which links very closely with
the habit of security that is far wider in
its general scope and threatens far greater
disaster in the future. This might be called
the habit of the slavish outlook. For the
whole historical period of world survey the
greater part of the world’s people existed in
a condition of practical slavery. The actual
number of serfs in the lands we are accus-
tomed to think of as having been free from
a remote antiquity is shown to have been
startlingly large. In the Doomsday Book it
is recorded that, while two or three eastern
counties of England had scarcely any slaves,
in the western and northern portions of the
country slaves sometimes outnumbered the
free people by ten to one. The Norman
Conquest did not liberate those slaves, but
added enormously to their number. In the
best days of Athens those in bondage in
Attica stood at the ratio of twelve to one
free man. In the best days of Rome the pro-
portion was greater ; while Corinth in Roman
times was almost all slave. The liberty de-
manded at Marathon and Thermopylae was
only liberty for a very few; no one dreamt
that it could possibly apply to the hewers
of wood and drawers of water. As for Ire-
land, it is recorded that when Ruraidle
O'Conor’s great helpless army drew back
beyond the Shannon at the first clash with
Norman knights in armor, the people, believ-
ing that it was the judgment of Coo on the
slave-holders, liberated hundreds of thousands
of those formerly in bondage. If the coun-
tries of Europe which most loved freedom
were thus crowded with slaves it is toler-
ably evident that the others were in no
better case. And it must further be remem-
bered that the alleged freedom of those who
were classed as free was very restricted. The
small slave-master was apt to cringe under
the whip of power as abjectly as the man
in the fields who could be bought and
sold. Nor did the alleged liberation which
came in the more recent centuries really
alter things much. In the days of our great-
grandfathers an English laborer who dared
to seek work beyond his own parish was still
legally liable to be whipped; and much later,
in the terrible factory age which marked
the first half of last century, the whip of
hunger drove’ the free man to his job at the
wheel or in the mine just as effectively as if
he had been bought in the open slave market.
So it may be taken as a bald fact that the
majority of those who sit in trams and vote
at elections are the direct descendants of
slaves who could show an unbroken slavish
ancestry for thousands of years and who
even when nominally made free were still in
a bondage which differed little from the real
thing. That such people should have the
habit of the slave mind is not surprising.
* * » *
But the habit of the slave mind is not
and never has been a habit of docile obedi-
ence. Disciplined obedience to an acknow-
ledged leader is rather the mark of the free
man. The slave attitude is that of getting
through with sufficient pretence of obedience
to escape direct punishment. The slave’s
prospects and responsibilities were narrowed
down to a mere pinpoint. Somebody else
must give him food and covex-ing; good work
or bad work would yield much the same re-
ward. His family outlook was of the mean-
est kind; he had no possible tribal or
national vision. Of course, there w*ere ex-
ceptions to all this. A slave sometimes was
given his freedom for services rendered; a
slave sometimes came to hold an honored
place in his master’s household; a
slave was sometimes a man of learn-
ing and culture before his bad luck
or folly threw him into servitude. But
the general average of slavery was low —a
mere animal life of toil without brightness or
hope. The persistence of the slave habit
of thought to-day when all men are supposed
to be equal and free is about the greatest
danger the modern State has to face. It is
seen very clearly in the dole system now
operating in Britain. Men -who have been
taught something in the primai’y schools and
who have been flattered by candidates for
Parliamentary election as free and enlight-
ened are content to remain permanently un-
employed and take a dole from the country
to supply them with the bare necessaries of
life. They do not ask where the pittance
comes from or whether it can be indefinitely
continued. They are simply slaves who think
they are outwitting their masters every time
they take something for nothing. The slack
workman with the “go-slow” notion is of a
similar habit of thought. To give the least
and get the most has always been the slave's
ideal. What the person with the slavish habit
of thought does not know, however, and what
his leaders never take the trouble to point
out is that slavish thought must in the end
lead to slavery. Sooner or later the State
must wake up and set its permanently unem-
ployed people to earn their bread; and en-
forced labor of the kind would mean nothing
else but a return to the old order. No State
can afford to have a constantly increasing
bill to pay for mere idleness. Similarly with
regal'd to the paid workmen who do not give
a fair return for their wages. Sooner or later
the. industrial tribunals must take account
of the speed and quality of labor. Persistence
of the “go-slow” habit of slave thought can
onl£ lead to a compulsion which is slavery.
No modern law can make a slave free from
the narrowing conditions of his own mind;
all that it can do is to give him a chance
to outgrow them and reach after bigger
things. Unfortunately, recent developments
of trade-unionism tend to make the man with
the sieve outlook master over the destinies of
his fellow's.
HOW ABE WE GOING TO BE PAID?
If there is one politician in Australia who
really has the interest of our producers at
heart, it is time he demanded a show-down
on this London exchange business. For the
past 12 months the rates at which the Aus-
tralian banks have discounted drafts on Lon-
don have been soaring beyond all reason,
until they have now reached a point when
they amount to an export tax of practically
5 p.c. net on all the wool, wheat, meat,
butter, metals and other commodities ex-
ported from Australia. If somebody in Aus-
tralia was reaping a benefit from the tax, the
business would not look quite so insane. For
a time the uninitiated blamed the banks for
their apparent rapacity in asking such rates.
The reply of the banker was convincing:
“Gentlemen, if you think an 85s. rate for
discounting a 30-days draft on London is
excessive, do not ask us to do the business.
We prefer to be without it.” As happily is
the custom with the Australian banker, he
told the truth. But nobody is getting any
benefit from this disguised tax on exports.
It is simply a fatuous piece of financial in-
efficiency for which lack of cohesion between
our bankers and our Governments is respon-
sible.
Measure it in cash and see what it looks
like. The fact of the matter is that, speak-
ing broadly, the Australian banks cannot
purchase the drafts on London because they
have not any money to do it with. Their
money is already in London, and cannot come
back except in the form of goods. The Aus-
tralian Governments, both Federal and State,
by borrowing in London, have deprived the
banks of the chance of getting their indus-
trial money back to Australia. In a word,
“borrowed-money goods” have been shipped
to Australia and the “industrial money” of
the banks has been left behind in London.
And while it stays there (a) the producer
pays this tax of 5 p.c.; (b) local industry
declines because of lack of capital, and em-
ployees are thrown out of work; (c) the
Governments continue to borrow money in
London and make the position worse.
Last year an arrangement was completed
between the bankers and the Commonwealth
authorities whereby it was “hoped” this ex-
change difficulty would be solved. There
was so much “hope” in the arrangement that
just as it was completed the exchange rates
rose to still dizzier heights. Ask any banker
whether the present arrangement is going to
solve the difficulty, and he will tell you he
does not know. Which is again true. The
arrangement in question whereby the banks
were lent Government notes was apparently
not designed to bring about a reduction in
the exchange rate. In effect it merely aimed
at making some of the banks which usually
do no London business carry some of the
burden. But the burden was still on, and
the producer had to be loaded up by his
banker.
A solution of the trouble seems to me clear,
but it requires a polLician of courage to
sponsor it. First, let me state the facts of
the case
(1) The Commonwealth Government and the vari-
ous State Governments have borrowed money in
London. The loans are capable of being purchased
on the open market there.
(2) The Australian banks have cash in London
which they are powerless to bring back to Australia.
It is badly wanted here. Industry is being paralysed
for the want of it.
By arrangement with the banks the Com-
monwealth Government can take so much
of the banks’ money in 'London as is re-
quired for the purpose and buy up Aus-
tralian loans on the London market. Con-
temporaneously the Commonwealth Govern-
ment can hand to the participating banks in
Australia an equivalent in Australian notes,
and by that means the money is transported
to Australia at a merely nominal cost of
brokerage. The notes used for this purpose
could and should be made a special issue,
to be earmarked for special redemption. For
purposes of redemption the interest accruing
on the loans which, in effect, had been pur-
chased with them would be available for
the purpose.
There is no sound economic reason why
this should not be done. To urge that a
further issue of notes means inflation or
some other stupid thing just as relevant as
Mesopotamia is quite beside the question.
This issue of Australian notes would take
the place of what really are notes already
issued, but are called bonds or stocks in
loan parlance. They would, therefore, be
backed by existing assets —unless Australia
admits it is a liar.
Now, if Australia starts to buy up its loans
in London (even if only to the limit of ex-
pediency for exchange purposes) it will give
the first evidence of a national knowledge
of finance. The Australian can w T ork —wrnrk
harder than any other man on the face of
the globe if he likes. Londbn realises it,
and is more or less ahvays willing to lend
us cash. America is beginning to realise it.
and is now sending us financial ambassadors
with the same object in view. But the
Government which, under existing conditions,
places additional burdens on our backs by
raising loans outside of Australia deserves
all that is coming to it. This 5 p.c. export-
tax on our production must be banished
speedily. The banks are entitled to have
their money made quickly available to them
in Australia, so that they may perform the
service that local industry has previously
never demanded of them in vain.
FRANK HAMBRIDDE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Ministry of Dreadful Funk.
An opinion begins to be entertained that the
Bruce Government (the Page half of the
concern having gone away) will win through
the marine struggle, which must end some-
time and somehow, with a clean sheet. It
will be too clean to be wrnrth calling a sheet.
The record at time of writing was that in a
strictly Uederal matter the Federal Cabinet
hadn’t done one item of its duty, or shown
one sign of resourcefulness and upstanding
courage, or been of the least usefulness to
anybody save the truculent gang which has
Australia’s commerce and industry by the
throat; and that is the passive kind of activ-
ity which a stuffed image can do in bed. It


doesn’t appear to know what to do, or what
it can do, or how to do it, or experience the
least desire to do it. Even that capacity for
godlike anger which is said to make the
worm, under certain conditions, revolve on
its axis has been left out of the Ministerial
make-up if the evidence counts for anything.
An imported individual of a reach-me-down
sartorial aspect, who scoffs at White Aus-
tralia and discourses treason by the yard, has
explained to it that its decisions and the
decisions of its Courts will be of no account
unless countersigned by him, and so far he
has piled injury on insult by proving his
words. It isn’t on record that the disgrace has
brought a flush of shame to the damask
cheek of the best-dressed Administration this
great country possesses, something might
be done in the way of a paper censure by
demanding the deregistration of the law-
breaking unions, and they might be shut out
of the Arbitration Courts which, in the
absence of any material support, have ceased
to count in any case, but a reluctance to
speak harshly to the meanest or the rudest of
the Lord’s creatures is a serious difficulty.
There exists a statutory power for the de-
portation of imported undesirables, though
when two individuals came here to collect
funds for an insurrection the barrister Prime
Minister, out of the wealth of his ignorance
or of his forgetfulness, denied its existence.
A State Premier explained to him what he
apparently didn’t know and did for him what
he certainly didn’t do. Possibly lie lias for-
gotten again, or possibly he is waiting
for somebody to do his work for him
again. An unquestioned power is vested
in the Federal authority to suspend
the Navigation Act and admit all manner of
vessels to the coasting trade if Australian
craft are unable to perform the work. The
employment of this power might have made
it clear to the unionists that they were
due to turn down their imported Com-
munist taskmasters and perform some work,
but the Prime Minister shrank from that
line of action as from every other line, and
all the satisfaction that the applicants got
was the back view of a pair of spats fleeing
from temptation. Australia has for some
time been blockaded as even a successful
Hun fleet could hardly have contrived to do
the job, and unless some benevolent Austra-
lian dictatorship arises to change the posi-
tion the most likely finish appears to be tame
surrender to the demands of the foreign dic-
tatorship which has arisen already. Means
of defence are of no value if those who have
the job of applying them are treacherous, or
hopelessly inefficient, or terrified at the sight
of responsibility. There are people who
would give the Bruce Ministry a prize under
the second and third headings without the
least hesitation—as not having the faintest
idea what to do, and as being too badly
overwhelmed at the sight of its own shadow
for knowledge to be of any use to it. In fact,
they would give it first place for hesitation
and second for trench feet, and possibly
third for being, at the moment, the least
respected institution this land possesses.

The New N. S. Wales Railway
Commission.
N. S. Wales is to have three Railway Com-
missioners in place of one, as the result of
the visit of the two English experts, and that
is the most conspicuous result. Their recom-
mendation that the entire financial control
should be handed over to the Commissioners
was turned down, because the politicians
won’t let go their hold on railway construc-
tion jobbery or any part thereof, and their
proposal that other ports beside Sydney
should be connected with the interior wasn’t
made because that most important matter was
left out of the order of reference. And de-
spite the experts’ advice that the third Com-
missioner should be a man of figures, the
appointment went to Forster, the engineer,
in place of Hartigan, the accountant.
According to report the Chief Commissioner
wanted Hartigan, and the Government
wanted Forster and carried its point. There
is a suggestion that the Yellow Pup intruded
to the prejudice of the accountant, but there
is a more probable explanation of Harti-
gan’s non-advancement. Fay and Raven,
the English experts, doubtless know a vast
amount about the business management of
railways, but as regards the political engineer-
ing of railways the doorkeeper at Parliament
House might easily be able to give them
points. A purely financial Railway Com-
missioner, furnished with ability, a trouble-
some conscience which made him want to
earn his salary, and a long engagement, would
be always liable to raise the big ghost which
infests the premises. The purport of the
apparition is that the intense building of frag-
mentary lines, sometimes three or four
abreast and at short distances apart, in dis-
tricts which have no visible claim for more
accommodation save that they belong geo-
graphically, or are made to belong artifici-
ally, to Sydney, is becoming an impossible
load and a clumsy jest. It might be deli-
cately conveyed to three engineer Commis-
sioners, or even to 30 such, that this problem
of high finance is off their beat. It would
be difficult to say that to a purely financial
Commissioner. So the Chief Commissioner
might very naturally desire a full-blown finan-
cial colleague, clothed with authority, who
could say things, and the politicians who lead
their stodgy lives in the old Big City groove
would very naturally dodge the issue because
they preferred that these things should be
left unsaid.

Tariffs and Tramways.
Australian manufacturers are handicapped
by the fact that their market at present is
small; and in effect it is smaller still when
it is not one market but many. There is the
nutter of tramway rails, for instance. The
other day the Brisbane Tram Trust wanted
2000 tons in a great hurry—a hurry, by the
way, that reflected no credit upon its per-
spicacity. Six tenders were received, one of
them from the Broken Hill Prop.; but it
was for a railway rail with guard plates, and
“was not considered acceptable.” In the
result a contract was made with an Ameri-
can firm_ for 1500 tons and with a British
firm for 500 tons. Later the acting-chairman
of the Trust said that “the question of
adopting the B. H. Prop.’s railway rail for
tramway purposes was very fully discussed
at a conference of tramway engineers in Mel-
bourne in 1923.... and with the exception
of the N. S. Wales representative the dele-
gates were not favorable.” At the best the
demand for tram rails in Australia must be
small for many years, and unless we make
a substantial concession in the matter of
price it will not pay any Australian com-
pany to put in the necessary plant even if
the whole of the orders come its way. But
if the dozen or so authorities controlling the
tramways of Australia will not agree upon a
standard rail and pledge themselves to use
it, then the probability of the industry being
established in the Commonwealth is ex-
tremely remote. That they will come to an
agreement without a good deal of pressure
being put upon them seems unlikely. Yet
it can be put quite easily. A duty of
£lO a ton upon British tramway rails, with
an extra £2 on foreign rails other than
British, to be collected as soon as the proper
authority certifies that tram rails can be
made in Australia, will probably do all that is
required. These fiddling little duties that we
play with merely produce revenue. In this
matter of rails, for example, at the time the
Brisbane tenders were invited British rails
were actually free and American rails carried
only 10 p.c.—say 20s. per ton. The Brisbane
Trust has beeif howled at for passing Aus-
tralia by and doing little for British indus-
try ; but what right have we to throw bricks
that way? If the Commonwealth wants its
own trade, then it should say so; and the
only way it can say so and be listened to is
through its tariff. If it has strong feelings
also on the subject of British preference,
then it should express them through its dif-
ferential tariff. It is no use merely talking
at large about these things. In this
case the tariff was shoved up to 355. per ton
British and 755. per ton other, but that was
not till after these tenders had been accepted;
and since, that being so, the higher rates
don t alter the direction of the contracts, it
simply means, so far as this job is concerned,
that the Commonwealth collects another
£4500 or so at the expense of the Brisbane
Tram Trust.

Italians in the North.
From the Queensland sugar country:—
North Queensland, the part of Australia that
should be occupied by 100 per cent. Britishers, is
becoming an unofficial colony of the King of Italy.
In the March, 1924, “Monthly Record of Migra-
tion”—a product of the International Labor Office
(League of Nations), Geneva —an outline is given of
recent migration developments in Italy. The point
most worthy of Australia’s notice is the brief outline
of the Italian Government’s Legislative Decree No.
3148 (15/12/’23). This decree set up a “National
Credit Institute for Labor Abroad.” The first of
the four objectives of the Institute is as follows: —
To give financial assistance, wholly or in part,
to labor or settlement undertakings abroad which
employ Italian workers exclusively, or in which
the majority of the workers are Italian.
The report explains how the Institute raises necessary
funds. Among other things, 10 per cent, of the
sums deposited by emigrants in the Savings Bank of
the Banco di Napoli and the Banco di Sicilia are
invested progressively in bonds issued by the Insti-
tute. Credit societies, shipping companies, under-
takings for the transport of emigrants, for investing
emigrants’ savings, or for any other business in
connection with emigration whose headquarters are
in Italy, or which are represented in that country,
are required, whether Italian or foreign, gradually
tu invest from 2 to 20 per cent, of'the reserve funds
which they are legally obliged to constitute in
bonds issued by the Institute. The State Emigration
Fund is in return to guarantee a minimum interest
of four to five per cent, per annum on the shares,
and three to five per cent, per annum on the bonds
issued by the Institute. When the decree to this
effect was signed, Mussolini addressed a letter to
the Commissioner-General of Emigration expressing
the opinion that all good Italians should take a
keen interest in assisting the work of the Institute
in view of the great importance of propagating
Italian ideas and encouraging the sale of Italian
goods, which the creation of compact centres of
Italian culture outside the Kingdom, conscious of
their own importance and possessing a proper
economic organisation, could assist. One wonders how
much assistance the Institute is granting the Italians
who are “colonising” North Queensland.
Though probably not one in a thousand of them
has any knowledge of the Decree No. 3148, the
Australians resident in North Queensland are bitterly
opposed to the introduction of Italians. What, then,
are their objections? What might be called the
Italian’s virtues are most often complained of.
His working hours extend from before daylight until
after dark, and his womenfolk work in the fields
with him, only retiring at intervals to prepare meals.
This and his mode of life are looked upon as likely
to reduce the standard of living in North Queensland.
Further, except in isolated instances, the Italians
are not inclined to contract inter-racial marriages,
preferring to keep their breed pure.
The A.W.U., instead of welcoming them as com-
rades, has a decided dislike for them on account of
their constant breaches of the industrial laws and
the difficulty experienced in detecting such breaches.
The merchants are opposed to them, and recently,
when a small batch of 25 English lads arrived in
Cairns, the Mayor, a business man with big interests
in the North, welcomed them on the wharf, and
again at night with the Mayoress and a crowded
hall of other prominent citizens assisted to entertain
the lads. The entertainment itself was arranged by
the District Executive of the R.S.I.L.A. The speakers
left no room for doubt that their welcome was not
so much to entertain the lads as to express their
pleasure at seeing Britishers arriving instead of
the usual Italians.
Agreeing with Mr. Bruce that Australia is not'
yet in a position to inaugurate a quota system of
immigration on the U.S.A. pattern, there are still
many ways in which the ever-growing stream of
undesirable Italians might be checked. For example:
(1) insist upon a strict dictation test in all cases ;
(2, and perhaps most important) tighten up the
naturalisation laws and so make it more diffcalt for
an alien to become the owner of freehold land. The
adoption of these suggestions would not entirely
eliminate the trouble, but would at least modify it.
♦
The Outlook in the Mandated Territory.
Australia has had little luck with the
Mandated Territory of New Guinea, but
things are said to be looking up. At all
events, the Prime Minister announces that
a profit of £25,000 was made last year, and
that in consideration of the improved situa-
tion the expropriated properties, or some of
them, will be “offered for sale at an early
date.” The 1922-23 accounts showed a credit
balance of £12,293. The Expropriation Board
actually spent £175,759 more than it re-
ceived, but £188,052 was set dowffi as “esti-
mated capital expenditure on non-bearing
plantations on the basis of Is. 3d. per palm.”
Concerning this expenditure G. M. Allard
and Yarwood, Yane and Co., the accoun-
tants commissioned by the Government to
examine the affairs of the Expropriation
Board, report that “the basis of Is. 3d. per
tree is somewhat excessive.” Presumably
the £25,000 was arrived at in the same way
as the £12,293; in other words, Mandated
Territory “profits” are conjectural if not
imaginary. When the Expropriation Board
entered upon its duties in 1920 there were
sanguine souls who prophesied that the Ter-
ritory would soon be turning in a tidy
amount for reparations. As a matter of
fact, the Possession, or whatever it is, has
cost Australia upwards of a million sterling,
and the expenditure is expected to reach
£1,300,000 by June 30, 1927, “when,” the
accountants advise, “it should commence
to diminish.” During the first ten months
there was a trading loss of £87,090
(£121,033 if administrative expenditure is
added) in respect of five “prescribed” Ger-
man companies, the loss being due, in a
large measure, to Germans having a say in
the management and to “the Australian ship-
ping strike, which rendered it impossible to
market a large quantity of copra as it was
produced and available.” Against an ap-
proximate outlay of £1,150,000 the Board
holds 268 plantations covering 294,530 acres,
together with plant and equipment, trading
stations, wharves, a wooden pub and half a
sawmill. The cultivated area is 117,860
acres, of which 59,398 acres are under bear-
ing cocoanut-palms and 55,498 acres under
coeoanuts not yet bearing; the rest is under
rubber and cacao. Cocksure of ultimate
victory, the Germans planted briskly during
the war years, but there has been very little
planting since. According to the Versailles
arrangements Australia has the right to
sell all the property taken over from the
Germans in New Guinea (their own country
has undertaken to compensate them) and
apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of in-
dividual claims against Germans or Germany,
any credit balance in favor of the defeated
nation to go into the reparations fund. In
1922 the Expropriation Board tried to dis-
pose of 30 plantations by advertising in
various Australian, Mlaoriland and London
newspapers, but the bald record states that
“only one satisfactory tender was received,
and that was for a leasehold plantation on
Avhich is situated the Tomo Hotel.” Un-
less very favorable terms are offered by the
Government the properties presently to be
placed on the market will not be rushed.
There are doubts witli regard to land titles
and the permanence of the mandatory sys-
tem. There are doubts with regard to the
marketing of the copra, thanks to the .Sea-
men’s Union and its annual strike and its
perennial Bolsii. And the Yarwood-
Allard report contains other doubt-breed-
ing paragraphs:—
At present the native plantations are a breeding-
ground of pests, from which infection spreads to the
neighboring European plantations. . . .In many locali-
ties plantations have been made on soil which is
apparently lacking in some necessary constituent,
as the palms are not making the progress or giving
the crops which would usually be anticipated. In
other cases where palms have been planted for
many years, and have borne well, the output is
decreasing, probably owing to exhaustion of the soil.
It has been suggested that the plantations
should be cut up into 500-acre blocks and
leased to returned soldiers; and A. R. Cob-
croft, an expert from Samoa, was asked to
discuss this scheme in reporting on the
expropriated properties generally. He states
that 500 acres of palms yielding 175 tons of
dried copra per annum would be worth
£22 per acre, and that plant, machinery,
bullocks, etc., would cost another £IOOO,
or £12,000 altogether. Receipts in a good
year are estimated at £3392 19s. Id., and
working expenses, taxes, cargo freights and
handling charges are set down at £2094
ss. In effect: —
The net profit on the year’s working is
estimated to be .. .. .. £1238 14 1
From this would have to be deducted
interest on £12,000 at, say, 6 p.c. p.a. 720 0 0
Leaving a credit balance of .. .. 518 14 1
It isn’t much for a year’s work in a malarial
country; and then nothing is allowed for
the malignancy of T. Bolsii.
The Labor Government of Queensland.
Randolph Bedford stands by his figures:—
Solomon Malaprop says: “It is remarkable that
ic [the spurt in the Queensland cotton industry]
didn’t begin as soon as the new people took office.”
The “spurt” was the renewal of a dead industry:
it didn’t begin in 1915 because the demand occasioned
by war dislocation didn’t begin until 1918. Against
all facts Malaprop says that “progress [in cotton
growing] would seem to be slowing down again.”
He takes an industry which in 1919 planted only
72 acres; and because in 1923 it planted 40,000 acres
(31,284 acres over the 8716 acres in 1922) he
believes the industry is slowing down because the
1925 planting is only 60,000 acres. Sixty thousand
acres is 50 P-c. increase over the 1923 crop; but
apparently he. wants cotton to increase its crop
in the ratio of his own foolishness, and that is
impossible.
The amount of State taxation per head he gives
correctly, but falsifies by insinuation. He says:
“Queensland collected less per head in 1923 than
in any of the three previous years.” So it did ;
but it doesn’t suit him to give the figures. These
are; 1920-21, £4 18s. Id.; 1921-22, £4 95.;
1922-23, £4 4s. 6d. And the revenue per head for
these three terms was £l6 15s. 9d. ; £l6 os. 6d. and
£ls 19s. 6d. Shocking difference of a shilling or
two that Mr. Solomon Gloom weeps for! So much
for his “drying-up process” !
As he says, Queensland has 835,000 acres
under crop to Victoria’s 4,862,000 acres, S.A.’s
3,575,452 and W.A.’s 2,274,998. But Queens-
land produced 135 million pounds of wool
of the Australian total of 640 million pounds, and
wool is not to be despised in these days, as I have
heard “Solomon” often preach when he has been
attacking the Australian “mania” for growing wheat.
He admits that “Queensland factories are more
manned and less womaned than those of N.S.W.
and S.A.” He might have added less womaned than
those of Victoria and the other States. And to
account for this he says that some Quarterly
Statistics figures “suggest that these two States,
S.A. and N.S.W., pay their women better than
Queensland does its men.” The reply to his mean
and false suggestion is the “Commonwealth Year
Book” figures of the average wage for male and
female factory hands for 1922-23:
N.S.W. Vic. S.A. Q’land.
Males .. £213.83 £215.56 £202.85 £199 57
Females.. £97.23 £97.21 £82.87 £85.13
There are few of “the gang of cranks, visionaries,
political engineers, pro-Huns and experimentalists”
who support Theodore in Queensland cranky
enough, or fraudulent enough, to make from those
figures a “suggestion” that S.A. and N.S.W. “pay
their women factory workers better than Queensland
does its men.”
And a Northerner adds a few:—
Randolph Bedford says (B. 25/12/’24) that
Queensland railway employees per mile of line have
decreased during the Labor period (1915-24) and
revenue per employee has gone up from £257 to
£336. But that is only part of the story. Here
are some particulars overlooked (the figures are
per employee) :
1914-15. 1923-24.
Train miles run .. 802 687
Passengers carried .. 870 913
Tons of goods and stock.. 332 252
One hundred and fifteen fewer train miles run
and 80 tons less merchandise and livestock moved
per employee—that is the record in the latest
Labor year compared with the latest Liberal year,
set off by the trifling increase of 43 passengers, or
not one a week J
Out of these movements Queensland taxpayers re-
ceived :
Net Earnings per Employee.
1914-15 .. .. £95 15 3
1923-24 . . .. £42 14 0
But interest on capital cost has to come from
earnings, and after allowing for interest the follow-
ing net results are revealed:—
1914-15— Profit per employee .. £3 5 1
1923-24— Loss per employee .. £94 0 10
As Mr. Bedford says, the misuse of railway
statistics is dishonest, and all that he has written on
the subject is calculated to deceive the uninformed
by displaying a few facts and concealing others
far more important. A comparison of working
expenses per train mile, he says, is “obviously the
only true test of management” and in this respect
he shows Queensland to stand well enough. But
surely a better test is net revenue per train mile:
N.S.W., 3s. ll^d.; Victoria, 3s. 64d. ; S.A., 3s. 4d. ;
W.A., 3s. lOd. ; Queensland, Is. 3d. Queensland’s
railway profit in the year before Bedford’s party
got into office was £48,651; last year there was a
loss of £1,593,066. Railway losses in nine Labor
years total £11,475,550. Last year nearly every
other State made its lines pay. Queensland lost
£4,364-odd a day.
Mr. Bedford offers us a shocking example of the
misuse of statistics. “As to bleeding the taxpayers,”
he says, “the Commonwealth Statistician shows that
last year the following amounts were collected per
head of the population in the various States by the
State Governments: Westralia, £2O 19s. 7d. ;
N. S. Wales, £l6 12s. Bd. ; South Australia, £l6
18s. 7d. ; Queensland, £ls 19s. 6d. ; Victoria,
£l3 12s. Id.” The Statistician gives these figures
not as showing tax revenue, but as showing total
revenue. The N.S.AV. total includes about £3,700,000
of tramway revenue, and the Queensland total not
a halfpenny of such revenue. The tax-revenue col-
lected in the year Bedford refers to (1923-24) in
the different States was: N. S. Wales, £3 11s. 9d. ;
Victoria, £2 11s. 3d. ; South Aus., £3 10s. lOd.;
Westralia, £2 17s. 6d. ; Tasmania, £3 6s. 6d. ;
Queensland, £ ) t J/s. 6d. Last year Queensland’s per
capita share of State taxation was over a million
less than the amount actually collected.
Queensland’s Labor finance is a tragedy—such a
tragedy that the Treasurer is escaping from it in a
few weeks’ time. Perhaps when Caucus meets to
elect Theodore’s successor as Premier and to put-
Brennan on the bench, Mr. Bedford will be a
candidate for the Treasurership. Let us fervently
hope he will riot be elected.

The Source of Wealth.
“H. Horsecollar” : Labor, in the trades-
union sense of tlie term, doesn’t “produce all
wealth,” and the chatty propagandists who
say it does always mean labor in the trades-
union sense of the term. I suppose 80 per
cent, of wealth is produced by machinery, and
by the kind of brain which invents machinery,
and by the other kind of brain which organ-
ises and manages the show. This may be a
gross overstatement of labor's share, but let
that pass. If all results were due to hard
manual toil, then it wouldn’t matter what
machinery an army carried, whether boomer-
angs or automatic rifles, so long as the rank
and file labored industriously. And it
wouldn’t signify whether the man in charge
(the manager, answering to the employer or
capitalist) was a Napoleon in his prime or
an old he-woman in his decay, the “yakker”
of the dead-level multitude being the one
essential. When machinery for making
things and shifting things was only just be-
gun, the young Briton of 12 or so worked 13
or more hours per day in a factory for half
a crown per week, and yet his exploiter and
employer wasn’t anything like a rich man
as the term is understood to-day. Rich land-
owners were known, but the rich manufac-
turer hadn’t yet been invented. Philanthropy
and Christianity and revolutionary fervor
could find no remedy of any size though they
skirmished round with good intentions; but
machinery has done a good deal, and is doing
more. The outstanding reason why the New
Australians in Paraguay came down to an
average earning power of £7 per annum, and
didn’t seem likely to keep up to that, was
that they trusted too much to their own pet
theory as quoted above. Soviet Russia began
with the idea of disqualifying the inventor,
organiser and scientist, along with the land-
owner and mere loafing man of wealth, and
based its hope of earning a comfortable liv-
ing on plain but misdirected toil, with revo-
lutionary fervor to supervise, and Communis-
tic orthodoxy to run the engine. To judge by
the begging letters which Soviet Russia sends
out and the eternal peregrinations of the
famine-stricken hat, the country is in a bad
way despite all the salaries it has saved.
Trade unions have done a lot of good work,
but I don’t think any one of them ever
founded a new industry or invented a new
labor-saving and wealth-producing machine,
no matter how badly the “proletariat” wanted
it. Wherefore it is pleasing to note that
some of the despised folk who aren’t eligible
for trades-union membership here, and aren’t
eligible for anything worth having in Soviet
Russia, are again pursuing their old games.
One current idea is that the turning of cane
refuse into celotex may supply this country
with a new building material and save some
of the vast amount of money which now goes
out in payment for imported soft woods. An-
other is that, at present prices, the distilling
of motor alcohol out of sugar-mill waste lias

become perfectly feasible, and that some of
the great outflow of money in the purchase of
petrol may thus be stopped. Hopes are enter-
tained that not only may a pair of profitable
new industries be started, but that the old
industry of sugar-growing may be made more
solid and payable through securing fresh
sources of income. Some go so far as to
suggest that a few brain devices may do as
much for the sugar industry as would all the
different varieties of strike on the union
organiser’s menu, even if they were all struck
at once. Labor is a great thing, and many
of the people who hold that it is the sole
source of wealth ought to do more of it; but
without brain-devices to help it it wouldn't
keep a hard-working family in ’possum.
Communists and Wild Beasts in General.
"Clifford Snook” writes :
Just before Christmas the author of “The Un-
speakable Scot” passed hence in dire poverty, so
the work of writing up “The Unresistant Australian”
is left to other hands. The Australian is certainly,
in some respects, a submissive cove. On January 1
the Visible alternatives seemed to be that
this continent would have to do without shipping
altogether, or else shunt Tom Walsh back to his
homeland with a warning that mighty serious
things would befall him if he returned, and send
with him on the same terms all his imported accom-
plices who could be located. The uncrowned king
and virulent ex-fireman had gone to Westralia and
annulled the strike settlement that had been arrived
at. He had taken things practically out of the
hands of the State Labor Government. He was
returning east to stop any settlement that might
be in prospect there. The supreme Arbitration
Judge had been informed by letter that no decision
he might give on marine-strike subjects would
amount to a row of pins unless it was agreeable
to T. Walsh, and instead of an earnest search
being made for the writer of the insult,
with a view to giving him a sentence
which would help him through the coming
year, his Honor meekly remarked that the document
was not the cheese, or fell short of being the
proper caper. The ex-fireman was the visible head
of a movement which was subjecting Australia to
vast inconvenience, amazing insolence and the loss
of many thousands of pounds per day. He was the
malignant vulgarian who made faces at a continent,
so to speak, and did it with absolute impunity.
No law was put into operation to meet the case, nor
was any Parliament called together to make a
sufficient law, if none existed. The morning of
January 1 found a well-spanked community taking
its gruel in a humble and contrite spirit.
That law exists authorising the deportation of
uninvited guests, especially when they are brutal,
expensive and arrogant nuisances, whether they are
subjects of the Empire or not, is quite certain. The
law was applied some time ago in the matter of
two Irish gentlemen who were harmless by compari-
son, for they didn’t propose to make war here, only
to make war in Ireland. That more law can be
made is equally certain. That a good deal can be
done without law is proved by the goings-on of
the present strike leaders, who ignore the courts
altogether. There is a high and /recent precedent
by which a person was sent, not home from a foreign
country, but abroad from his own country, which
was, perhaps, overdoing things. Charles of Austria
was a harmless young man who had the misfortune
to inherit a half-finished war, and the ill luck to
fail in his efforts for an immediate peace. The
fact that he was first exiled to Switzerland, and
later hustled away by British authority to Madeira,
where he ended his life, showed that the world is
full of possibilities. And Charles was a real polite
king, and not a coarse imitation.
A previous upheaval, though not so bad a one
as this, collapsed all of a heap when a magistrate
gave T. Walsh a sentence of, if I remember aright,
three months in gaol. That would be quite insuffi-
cient now, but it suggests the way to do things.

More complete details about the discoveries
made by the Allies in 'Germany are not cheer-
ing. They are to the effect that the Fritz
country, the army of which is supposed to
be limited to 100,000, has trained 500,000
new men since the war, while it keeps a fine
organised reserve of old soldiers, and trains
and reinforces a staff proportioned to an
army of two or three million men. It is
added that the peaceful-looking chemical fac-
tories and ironworks are so arranged for a
prompt turnover to war purposes that within
three months after Allied supervision ceased
Fritz could be producing war material at
a greater rate than before he was “disarmed.”
In fact, British and foreign military experts
consider that, if the Allies evacuated the
occupied territory, which gives then a strong
line of defence on the Rhine, the next World
War would be ready in a year at most. This
paper begins to doubt whether any countries
have disarmed much except Britain and Aus-
tralia. The latter has less than 1750 men
under arms, and it has more than twice
1750 of the other sort of people who heap
scorn on the “alarmist” who doesn’t take the
pacific assurances of any possible enemy
(Hun or Asiatic or Bolshevik) at their face
value. No doubt it is good for the Hun
to have reliable friends who assure the world
that the bogey of possible invasion is laid,
just as he had reliable friends who assured
us before the war that there was no Hun
bogey to lay, and who strenuously assert, in
like fashion, that tfiere is no other bogey of
the same sort. But what do they get out ot
it themselves?
In Sydney recently 166,125 persons paid
£16,602. exclusive ! of members’ tickets, to
see a cricket match, and innumerable other
Australians knocked off work for various
periods to discuss the score. When the same
teams reached Melbourne the spectators
numbered 238,812, and £22,463 Is. was taken
at the turnstiles. Each match lasted into
the seventh playing day, and nearly every
scoring stroke was described by the news-
paper reporters, wtiose efforts were supple-
mented by those of numerous photographers,
caricaturists and commentators, the com-
ments being more or less prolix and the cari-
catures mostly inane. Also, the games were
preceded and succeeded by acres of dreary
speculations as to whether “the ashes’ will
remain in Australia, or return to J. Bull’s
country. “Test” cricket is a quadrennial
business, and is perhaps as good a method
of killing time, for both players and on-
lookers, as any other. All the same, a sport
that requires seven days for the playing of
one match is not much of an inspiration to
a nation which has got to earn its living,
and which has more than enough examples
of go-slow already.

AN ethnological survey :
Protests from all parts of Australia against the
rising stream of immignation from South Europe have
roused up the usual band of apologists. One enthusiast
recently held up the Italian and Greek portions of the
flood as representatives of the races of Pericles and
A MAN IS JUDGED BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS.
Augustus, and he delicately hinted that an infusion
of the blood would dc Australia good. The trouble
is that few of tSie Greeks and Latins we
are getting can boast a stud-book pedigree. Portu-
guese and Spaniard from the Mediterranean littoral,
southern Italian, Sicilian, Greek, Balkan Slav and
Maltese have this thing in common, a perceptible
infusion of one colored alien blood or another.
Portugal and coastal Spain are poisoned with the
colored cross, negro and Berber in the begin-
ning. The t.netration of African blood, by slavery
and long unchecked Moorish piracy, has put an
ineradicable stamp if?on the southern Italian and
the Sicilian. The coastal and island Greek carries
the same reproach, and this in turn is aggravated by
the Turkish cross. The alleged Slav of the Balkan
States is so strongly impregnated with the blood of
his long-time conqueror and oppressor, now as ever an
Asiatic, that it is difficult to note any outward dis-
tinction between the two other than lies in dress.
A party of Serbs and Bulgars who were stranded
recently in Newcastle were, in features, manner and
despairing apathy, the counterpart of the Turkish
prisoners of the late war. And the Maltese has
crosses of Phoenician, Greek, Carthaginian-Numidian,
Roman, Crusader, Saracen, Turk, Knight of St.
John and H.M.R.N. The U.S.A. has given the
southern European a fair trial, and its opinion of
him nowadays is best expressed by its action in slam-
ming a belated door in his face.

“Henry IIorsecollar” : There is nothing of
outstanding interest in such cries as that
of “G.D.M.” (B. l/l/’25), but there is m
speculation as to the purpose that lies be-
hind his class of literature. Nobody could
help being pleased with the promise that the
Japanese won’t move south while they have
Northern Asia to exploit. Certainly they
have moved south to Formosa, and further
south to little groups not far from outlying
Australia, and they comprise nearly halt
the population of Hawaii, and they have
fussed a bit about the right of entrance to
California, and they begin to be known in
Mexico. And the interest they took m the
Singapore naval base almost looked as if the
South Pacific was a personal matter with
them. On the other hand they lately aban-
doned Eastern Siberia, leaving their client,
the Chita republic, to its fate. Still, grant-
ing everything that “G.D.M.” says, to be cor-
rect, what does he gain by killing myths
with a lofty gesture and a supercilious
mouth? I suppose everything leads up to
the moral that Australia should abandon all
idea of populating the fertile North, of rais-
ing new States and State capitals there
(which is the only way that much popula-
tion is accumulated anywhere in Australia),
and of building the South-to-North railway
and making tin; Territory (which is Federal
property) accessible. “G.D.M.” doesn’t parade
this moral or inference, but the attitude of
one particular tribe of northern ghost-slayers
appears to be that there is no sense in mak-
ing profit out of the promising young North
unless the Japanese are coming there. And
as they aren’t coming, all available effort and
money should be concentrated on the pam-
pered little old South, where the Japanese
aren’t coming either.

“Jesmond'’ : “Stellsby’s” protest against
the ungenerous treatment accorded to other
war-sufferers compared with limbless men
(B. 25/12/’24) was long overdue. The
limbless man—to whom all honor ! —may,
and often does, enjoy excellent health, and
there are many positions which he can fill
usefully and efficiently. Finally, he has no
pension worries. There are men just as
permanently but less spectacularly incapaci-
tated by the war who are in far worse case.
They must be very careful what they do, not
only as regards their health, but because there
is always somebody ready to report to the
liepat. If they blow their noses, their lungs
are all right; if they walk half a mile, their
legs are all right; and unless they pull a long
face their health is all right. They have to
fight for the retention of their pensions all
the time.

“Ex-Dig” : The muddle of Repatriation has,
amongst other things, broken many fine ex-
soldiers who were on the administrative side:
the last, .a responsible officer who has been
in the Department for the last six years,
was committed for trial the other day, and
his reputation will be more or less spoilt
however his trial goes. An indication of the
size of the muddle is given in the fact that
the peculations with which this man is
charged date back to the middle of the year
before last; yet, with a special audit staff
supposed to keep a check upon all trans-
actions, the alleged defalcation has only just
been discovered. As a matter of fact, the
means of becoming illegally possessed of
money is painfully easy in some jobs in
Repat.: on the other side is the hideous
underpayment_of officers who are subject to
the temptations. Many queer things have
occurred in connection with the management.
But, through it all, no censure or punish-
ment has come the way of the higher offi-
cials ; and for the moral destruction of num-
bers of poorly-paid officials, who went wrong
almost as a natural result of the muddle-
men t, only an unprofitable pity can be felt.

per week. When the business was run on a
big scale years ago the Communistic job-
controllers met it with strikes, terrorism and
miscellaneous demands, including £l6 per
week for males over 18. So the works
closed, the best part of the population left
and the worst part sank into chronic pauper-
ism. And the same old round will probably
begin again, no interest being taken in keep-
ing the Soviet emissaries out.

“Wodgii,” : One of the questions discussed
at the recent manufacturers’ conference was
how to spread the gospel of preference to
articles made in Australia, but the delegates
got no farther forward. Why don't manu-
facturers combine with the A.D.F.A., the
A.N.A., the new Preference League and simi-
lar bodies to issue metal badges to citizens
who will undertake to give preference to
Australian goods as a matter of principle?
The device might be a miniature map of
Australia, with the letters A.F. (“Australia
First”) embossed or stamped within. There
are thousands of Australians who would
cheerfully give the necessary undertaking
and agree to sport the badge at least once
a week. The A.F. sign, worn on the left
lapel of an Australian-made coat, would be
a certificate of good citizenship and a re-
proach to bad Australians. And it would
certainly get preference widely discussed.

One of the functions of the League of
Nations is to “standardise working condi-
tions throughout the world,” and with this
object it sent a Commission recently to
Shanghai, which is the biggest aggregation
of factories this side of the Suez Canal.
The Commission is of the cautious opinion
that the age of factory workers might be raised
from nine to eleven years within the next four
years, and that the hours of labor for child-
ren under 14 could be safely limited to 12
in the 24, without wrecking many industries.
The manufacturers of the foreign settlement
are, however, in competition with native in-
dustry outside; and the market rate for
adult unskilled labor in China proper is about
Bs. a month for a working day of 14 to 17
hours. The League of Nations will strain its
heart if it endeavors to standardise that up
to the Australian laborer’s £l5-odd a month
for a working day of eight hours.

Japanese newspapers bitterly criticise this
country for demanding a base at Singapore
as essential to the defence of Australia.
“From a military point of view,” says the
Osaka Mainichi, a big commercial paper,
“the argument is sound.” However: —
We oppose the plan on the ground that it is
contrary to international justice. Japan, it is true,
is over-populated, but peace reigns. We would then
ask whether it is fair for Britain to devise plans
for bombarding such a peace-loving people. Would
it not have been better and wiser to have thought
of some means whereby the surplus population of
Japan could be effectively disposed of?
The answer to which is that Japan’s surplus
population is Japan’s own business. Also,
since the surplus population wasn’t effec-
tively disposed of before it was born, the
Singapore Base is the only sort of argument
that does seem to fit the case. Nevertheless
wo are grateful to our Japanese friends for
the assurance that it is sound “from a mili-
tary point of view.”

The Prime Minister’s remedy for what he
calls “the paralysis of the shipping trade,”
which result has been brought about by
“people who publicly announce that they
stand for revolutionary action,” has been
announced at last—it is deregistration of the
Seamen’s Union. Considering that the said
people have been exposing his Government
and its Arbitration Act and Court to the
ridicule and contempt of the lawless elements
of the community for many weeks, and that
more weeks must elapse before the medicine
can be applied-—if it ever is applied—it is a
pathetically futile proposal. - Nothing will
now avail but a special session of Parlia-
ment to pass measures for restoring the
dangerously weakened authority of the
people’s executive. One of these measures
should provide for the deportation of foreign-
born citizens who, in lawless defiance of
registered agreements, incite to the stoppage
of transport services on which, in the last
resort, the very lives of Australian-born
citizens depend.
From the smoking-room :
Perhaps the most brazen feature of a villainous
business is the pretence that the ill-conditioned hood-
lums responsible for the shipping strikes are, in
some unexplained fashion, “saving Australia from the
clutches of Lord Inchcape.” The cry is repeated,
parrot-fashion, by Labor politicians, although they
know perfectly well that the Australian Government
has been the target for the most vicious attacks.
The s.s. Volumnia, under charter to the management
of the Commonwealth Government line, was the first
vessel to be held up. Though the line is losing a
million a year or more, Tom Bolsh, it was explained,
doesn’t allow the management to charter British
vessels when there are idle Commonwealth ships m
Sydney Harbor. The same “reason” was given for
the banning of the Clan Munroe. In deference to
the great Bolsh, the Dongarra was commissioned in
Sydney and loaded with wheat, only to be laid up
because a stoker or slushy wasn’t engaged at the
Communist Hall. The Westralian steamers Kangaroo
and Bambra, bought by one Labor Government and
run—until recently—by another,- were rendered idle
for “sympathetic” reasons. Then the Commonwealth
liner Largs Bay, ordered to Tasmania to pick up
stranded passengers, had to tie up again because the
deckhands quitted the moving steamer in obedience
to union orders. Many of these stranded passengers
were working people with scanty resources who had
“saved up” for an island holiday. Not a few were
girl-teachers whose pupils are, very largely, the
children of trade-unionists, members of the Seamen’s
Union among others. When Senator Bob Guthrie was
at the head of affairs the seamen would have
scorned to play such monkey tricks at the expense
of their own countrymen and countrywomen. But
Guthrie is dead, and sullen ruffians who look to
Moscow for instruction rule in his stead.
One of the conditions on which the
Priminister “settled” the wharf-labor
wrangle was that the Waterside Workers’
Federation should unload the steamer Olan
Munroe, chartered by his Government, on
its arrival at Fremantle. But the Clan
Munroe was worked neither by the Fre-
mantle branch of the union nor by the branch
at Port Adelaide when it reached that port.
Consequently the “settlement” is null and
void; the W.W.F. can’t have its agreement
and break it too. The position at Sydney
is that the Fuller Government is standing
behind the soldier-wharfies of the Shipping
Labor Bureau, the abolition of which was
the object of the strike, and was thought to
lie secured in the “settlement”; and ship-
owners are between the Devil and the deep
sea. If they don’t patronise the Digger
Bureau they will be prosecuted under the
Returned Soldiers’ Preference Act; if they
do they will be under the W.W.F. ban in
other ports. Apparently there will never
be peace on the waterfront until the Bureau
wlmrfies are admitted to the W.W.F. with
their legal right to preference guaranteed for
a term of years; and the matter has gone
so far that the State Labor party will have
to be one of the guarantors, seeing that a
change of Government is possible this year.
NOT ONE OF THE FAMILY
AUSTRALIAN FARMER: “So you want to marry one of my daughters, do you, and settle
down?”
GIOVANNI MUSTARDINO : “ Well, I-a notta go that far. I like-a to be whatta you calla
the boarder .”
With a perverted sense of humor the Com-
munist bosses delayed the hold-up of the
Commonwealth steamer Largs Bay until all
the passengers were aboard, and the screw
had begun to revolve. The desertion at the last
moment being a foreseeable incident, in some
countries sufficient police, assisted by soldiers
if necessary, would have been at hand fo
gather in the deserters and see them to the
police station, ready to interview the magis-
trate on Monday morning, and thus show
that there is some law in existence beside that
served out at the Communist Hall. It would
have been some encouragement for those
who, if they didn’t feel themselves utterly
abandoned by blue-funkers in high places,
might be less subservient to the Communist
Hall. But, as usual, nothing was done.
Last Friday the Federal Arbitration Court,
having the Seamen’s trouble before it,
alluded to a “breach of the award,” and
threatened to make a new award and grant
an application of which the Seamen’s lash-
users disapprove. Thereupon the union
official warned the Court that “serious trouble
would arise” if it did anything of the kind.
As usual, nothing happened, except that the
gentleman was given time to consult the
other Bolshies, presumably to find out
whether they would take any notice of the
Court.
The public has been shouting “On, Stan-
ley, on!” But the historical gentleman
apparently won’t on at any price.
It is vaguely proposed to strengthen the
Bruce-Page Cabinet with an additional
Minister. Probably the result will only be
to lengthen it. If there is any hope of
strengthening such an institution The Bul-
letin would be glad to see Goliath appointed
immediately.
Almost does The Bulletin become a be-
liever in imported politicians. The aggres-
sive Walsh and Johanson are imported, while
Prime Minister Bruce is locally raised. The
first two have the support only of a small
minority of unionists, backed by a larger
minority which has been bulldozed into sub-
mission by shouts of “Scab \” They do as
they darn well please and cost the country
a small war-indemnity per week. The Gov-
ernment, on the other hand, has behind it a
solid Parliamentary majority, almost the
entire press, its own two parties and, so far
as the shipping hold-up is concerned, a good
many Opposition supporters, the law, the
law courts (including the Arbitration Court,
presided over by Justice Powerless, who is
himself a local product), the army (1703
permanent men, including 285 chaplains), the
naval forces (over 3600 on actual service
who might have manned a boat or two), and
the Treasury. And up to time of writing
it hadn’t pulled off a single victory. It is
doubtful whether it had even pulled a drown-
ing fly out of its coffee.
The Australian working man will never
revolush, the fatuous person says who
wouldn’t deport anybody or stop anybody’s
pestiferous organising. How much revolu-
tion do these people want? What is the
thing that is happening in Australia to-day
hut revolution? The waterside unions were
allowed to take over the Government at
Fremantle; they prevented the Constitutional
Government from exercising its functions;
and further east Tom Walsh’s forces defied
the Courts. A revolution needn’t be sticky
with blood to be a revolution: the people’s
freedom can be taken from them without a
throat being cut.
“By 1932 there will be 2,000,000 fewer
workers in Great Britain,” said the London
County Council’s education officer to a pre-
sumably flabbergasted Educational Confer-
ence on a recent day. He professed to base
liis lamentation on tlie lack of children to fill
the schools. Comparing 1920 with 1923,
births in England, Scotland and Wales fell off
by 224,245, while deaths diminished by only
26,239. So the nation grows older, children
diminishing eight times faster than patri-
archs. And as there were 99,210 fewer
marriages, it is to be expected that births will
fall off for a while longer. Very likely the
prophet had even later and worse figures to
go upon. It was just after 1920 that the
pressure of competition from Protectionist
and cheap-money countries which were getting
over the war made many Britons think that
Freetrade was a fallen and busted Dagon,
and they were right. The last estimates
(1924) showed Scotland, for the first time,
as a country which was actually decreasing
in population. Even in the war time that
didn’t happen.
In accordance with its usual custom
Sydney University Senate has decided to in-
vite applications from all over the world for
the newly-created fIOOO-a-year job of Pro-
fessor of Obstetrics. Does the Senate want
to advertise its opinion that after all the
years the University has been maintaining
a medical school it has not yet succeeded in
producing anybody fit to hold a chair in
obstetrics ?
J. J. A. Curtin, editor of the Westralian
Worker, was declared “black” by the Sea-
men’s Union because he refused to publish a
letter —libellous, in his opinion—from one
of Tom Bolsh’s Fremantle satellites; and
“black” he still is. Now the Sydney Laiior
Daily is “black” to the Trades and Labor
Couhcil because the editor is not Ited enough
for the Council, which is bossed by Com-
munists, and also because the staff has been
reduced, o\*ng presumably to financial em-
barrassments. The position will probably be
adjusted by the Labor editors forming a
union and declaring the Communists “black,”
and then everyone will be satisfied.
Up on the Myall River (N.S.W.), which
flows through great forests into a northern
branch of Port Stephens, they want a rail-
way, 65 miles long, to run down the valley
to the waters, of that great and idle harbor,
and have formed a league to further its
prospects. So much in earnest is this body
that it is ready to accept a betterment tax
to defray any loss the Commissioners may
suffer. That the line will develop the hinter-
land of Port Stephens, reach the port at
deep water, and connect it with the existing
North Coast line by the most practicable
route are further reasons why the league
thinks the Works Committee should give its
desires favorable consideration —and on past
disgraceful experiences, are also reasons why
it probably won’t.
The kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes is still one of Europe’s storm areas.
A recent cable reports a Belgrade decree
ordering the suppression of the Croatian
Peasants’ party and the arrest of the execu-
tive. Inside the boundaries of the State set
up by the Treaty of Versailles are 54 million
Croats, Slovenes and Dalmatians, who are
R.C.’s and get their culture from Europe,
and who regard their Serbian relatives,
Greek Orthodox and half-Turkish in culture,
as uncivilised heretics. Stewing with them
are half a million Montenegrins, 800,000
Mohammedan Bosnians and 1,000,000 Bul-
gurs, Magyars and Roumanians, all of whom
iove their Serb overlords no better. All the
disaffected minorities are engaged in furious
intrigue with bordering Governments of their
own nationality. This melting-pot whose in-
gredients won’t mix is always likely to boil
over and scald the rest of Europe. If Aus-
tralia is to become a melting-pot, too, it is
to be hoped the cooks responsible will select
the constituents with care.
Artist Sid Long, who has just returned
from Europe after many years’ absence, com-
plains of the discouraging effect of the tariff
on the struggling young Australian artist
abroad; but as the duty does not apply until
the young Australian has struggled abroad
for seven years, he does not seem to have
much of a grievance. In fact, the grievance
seems to be all on the side of the Australian
people, who have to admit, duty-free, the
students’ immature efforts, which, when he
grows older and more skilful, he is often
very sorry for. Anyhow, there is nothing
to prevent the aggrieved artist repatriating
himself at the end of the seven years’ period
and giving his own country the benefit of
his ripened experience.
Maurice Blackburn, solicitor, formerly
M.L.A. for Essendon, beat the other 30
candidates in the Labor pre-selection ballotfor
Fitzroy, the seat made vacant by the death

49 votes more than the next on the list.
Fitzroy is a Labor pocket-borough, and
Blackburn has as good as won it. When

Alderman Burke—-late leader of the municipal Labor

Commission that his living was partly earned by
the commissions he received for attending races and

We fight for the under-dog, one and all, we Labor
stalwarts, the long day through,
Wringing from greedy Capital some part at least
of the wage-slave’s due;
And ever our loins for the fray we gird, and march
where money is stacked in tons,
To get a trifle of it transferred from bursting pockets
to empty ones.
There are some who ruin the squatter’s sleep, and
have blessings heaped on their hearts and heads
With every rise in the rates for sheep that gladdens
the serfs in the shearing-sheds.
To tilt at combines is our delight, to loose the cash
in their grip hard-held,
But the ring for my fellows’ sake 1 fight is the
one where the racecourse odds are yelled.
We have sworn an oath in our brotherhood, wherever
are profiteers and plutes,
To biff their moneybags hard and good—and there’s
work for all, you can bet your boots.
Some concentrate on the shipping rings that in ill-
got riches else might roll,
And queer their sinful pitch with things like tied-up
steamers and job control.
There are others with Old King Coal engage and
make that bloated monarch pay
A trifle more than a living wage from the thumping
profits he socks away.
But / lighten the load on backs that ache, and ever
I ease the weekly strain
Of working chaps who have bets to make, and couldn’t
gets odds like I obtain.
Isn’t every Midas a Labor foe and a monstrous eft
that invites attack
From Sam Merino to Iky Mo, from High Financier to
Shortodds Mac. ?
Say, which is it sweats poor comrades more—the
shipping-ring or the ringman who
Lays the hapless punter 6 to 4 when the proper
odds should be 7 to 2 ?
But when I blow in, see him pale and pause! Observe
his niggard price extend !
For he knows I work in Labor’s cause and he can't
play tricks with the workers’ friend.
Some toil for the toiling masses where dour unions
wrangle or judges sit,
But where “Lay the Feeuld” rends the air, I do
my bit, s’truth! Ido my bit.

“Harold Hardupp”: The barman in a
Melbourne pub which collects its fair share
of my salary deserves to be regarded as a
casual bloke. He had been absent the pre-
vious day, and seemed sore over something;
and when I asked what it was he exploded.
“Gripes! We had an old woman living in
nour ’ouse since a month after we was mar-
ried—boarding, I thought. The wife called
her ‘Mum,’ but I thought it tvas only in a
friendly way, like yon might use it to any
old woman ; and I never even knoo ’er name
until she died, day before yesterday. Now
the missus says she was her mother, dinlcum,
and I’ve gotter pay for her blanky funeral.”
In his indignation at the way he had been
put upon he forgot to hand me my change,
and I hadn't the heart to remind him of it.

“Percy P.”: Melbourne possesses a thief

skirted human. The person of ill-repute

reclaimed the goods. Afterwards she gave

added a picturesque detail. “I think his

It was.

Quero : She was quite the most pic-
turesque old lady we had ever seen, and
even though she was taking up a seat in the
small smoker of the crowded train everyone
forgave her, quite realising that at her age
she could hardly be expected to read the
notice on the carriage. We vied with each
other in paying her small attentions: we
closed the window, pulled down the shutter,
handed her a paper and adjusted her wrap,
and she thanked us delightfully. Then the
ticket-collector arrived. “Guard.” said our
old lady, “do you sell fags on this train?”
“No, mum.” replied that startled menial,
“we don’t.” “Well,” inquired our Venus

“J.IT.M.A.”: The Anglican cathedral at
Newcastle (N.S.W.) contains a memorial
to the dead of the A.I.F. that has not been
equalled in Australia, either for the beauty
of its architecture or for the spirit of affec-
tionate remembrance of sacrifice and great
deeds that has inspired its construction. The
Warriors’ Chapel, dedicated to the memory
of men and women of all denominations, is
worth a climb to the hill behind the Coal
City. However well meant, some of the
visible war memorials throughout the Com-
monwealth are almost grotesque in their
effect; here there is nothing but good taste
and a noble conception of something worthy
as a tribute to the dead. All the material
used in the building is Australian, as well as
nearly all the decorations, and. witli the
exception of the 13 stained-glass windows
and the panels of the altar, the craftsman-
ship has been carried out by Australians.
In a deep, arched recess in the south wall
is a shrine which contains “the Book of Gold”
—that is to say. when it is not at the bank
for safe-keeping, a Volume bound in gold
covers, in which are the names of 1000 mem-
bers of the Anglican diocese of Newcastle
who gave their lives in the Great War. An-
other volume, less ornate, holds the names
of the 20.000 men of N.S.W. who died on
service. The idea of the erection of the
chapel was that of the Dean, Dr. Crotty, who
himself served as a chaplain in the A.I.F.
Costs of building were largely borne by the
late Hudson Berkely, principal proprietor
of the Newcastle Herald, but in addition
to other large donations- —notably that of
Commander Gardner. R.N.R. —all classes of
people contributed to this fine memorial to
Australian soldiers who never returned.

“Toby C.”: The chap who “drank the old

second to the chance acquaintance I had a
few pints with the other day. After the
third mug he became reminiscent. “Yes,”-
he confided to me, “first a selection on the
Dorrigo, then four Ayr Laddie colts in Tam-
worth, next five houses on the Irvinebank
field, and, last of all, a 10-ton fishing smack
in Cairns —all gone down me neck. And,”
he concluded as one who struggles with an
insoluble problem, “I tell you straight, I’m
still thirsty.”

“Pesrgy O’Neil”: “Rumpus’s” Italians (B.
l/l/’25) who are “da blanka Australians

small maiden of eight, who told a Queensland
State-school teacher that she was Irish. The
dialogue continued: “But your father is an
Italian?” “Oh. yes. papa is Italian.” “And
your mother?” “Oh, yes, she’s from Italy
too.” “Then you must be Italian. Angela.”
“Oh, no, I’m Irish ; I was born in Brisbane !”

“Werrimee” : Here’s a concrete example of
bush mateship. Three little huts, standing
close together near Tuggerah Lakes, were
occupied by three old-age pensioners. The
veterans lived separately, but on Christmas
Day they clubbed together, meeting at Old
Ned’s hut one year, at Bill’s the next, and
so on. Old Ned was 84. and still hale and
hearty. ITis next-door neighbor and mate of
half a lifetime was an octogenarian handi-
capped by a useless arm and other infirmities.
Behind his hut was an immense stack of
wood, all brought in and cut up by Old Ned.
A visitor, finding him still adding to the pile,
suggested the -work was superfluous. “There’s
more there now than he can use,” he ven-
tured. “Only five years’ supply,” returned
Ned, running a calculating eye over the
mountain of fuel. “You see, Bill’s a lot
younger than me. He might live eight or ten
years after I peg out, an’ what would he do
for wood then?” As if the matter admitted
of no further argument, he spat on his horny,
claw-like hands, and resumed chopping.
“W.1.U.”; I don’t know how to classify
him in the catalogue of bridegrooms, but he
was certainly an unusual one. He was
working afternoon shift—4 p.m. to mid-
night. When the boss came roufid he asked
permission to work the following shift, from
midnight to 8 a.m. The boss demurred and
asked the reason. It came after some hesi-
tation : “I’m getting married to-morrow
afternoon.” “Then you want a shift off; you
won’t come in to-morrow 7 night,” replied the
boss. “Oh, yes. I will,” said the intending
benedict. And he did.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: “Centurion” may be right in
criticising Allenby’s leniency with the
Moslems, but the massacre of Sura-
feud (B. 25/12/’24) remains a blot
on the perpetrators. It is highly im-
probable that the man who shot the M.L.
soldier was in Surafeud on the night of the
massacre. He may have been tracked into
the village, but the tracking must have been
a dubious business in a footprint-covered
neighborhood. Even assuming that he had
entered it he had plenty of time to eseape
before pickets were posted; it is almost cer-
tain that he would have hastened through so
as to get as far as possible from the scene
of his crime before daybreak. Nobody can
say for certain that the murderer was an
Arab; one of this race would have been
much more likely to show a dusky pair of
heels than to halt and shoot his pursuer. But,
putting these considerations aside, and assum-
ing that the criminal was certainly in Sura-
feud, was that an excuse for civilised troops
THE WRECK.
“Poor old Jones has gone all to hits since he got married .”
“Oh, very likely. Everybody said he was cracked to think of such
a thing!”
to massacre most of the male population in
cold blood and burn the village? Actually
such action, as after events showed, didn’t
even diminish lawlessness amongst the tribes-
men. What happened at Surafeud was a
descent by A.I.F. and M.L. troops to Turkish
methods. Can Allenby be blamed for the
steps he took to mark his disapproval of their
action ?
* * * *
“Yarrum”: After all. there is very little
difference between society customs in the
bush and in the city. Up here in the wilds
somebody gives a dance and a gorge; and
after all is over the hat is passed round to
pay for the, music, tucker and liquor. One
morning not long ago I saw the cady thus
circulate twice. And in Sydney—well, a
fortnight ago I had a wire: “Can you join
us dinner at . Christmas Eve?” I could,
and said so; but what was my surprise
to find that afterwards I was called upon
to pay my whack of the bill. Luckily I had
the exact amount with me. I v/as told it
was a common occurrence in Sydney, and
that nobody noticed anything mean or nasty
about it. Why not call it a tarpaulin-
muster? We do in the bush.
* * * *
“Simon”: Pat McGarry, ex-M.L.A., w r as a
member of the N.S.W. Public Works Com-
mittee when a witness -was putting up the
usual strained ease for a railwav through the
bottom end of his paddock. “Phwat is the
land suitable for : queried Pat. “Poultery
farming, did ye say? Come, now, did ye
ever know a hin that didn’t die in debt?”
* * * ft
“Zabut”: “Centurion’s” reminiscence of
Surafeud (B. 25/12/’24) leaves the tale un-
finished. The harm done to Imperial senti-
ment by Allenby’s treatment of the division
which did more than any other to make his
name was in danger of growing. To let
troops come home with anger in their hearts
against tire C.-in-C. would have been a great
mistake. One Australian sensed this fact,
and saw that something ought to be done to
counteract the evil that had been worked.
He was H. S. Gnllett, up till then Lieut.
H. S. Gnllett, official correspondent with
the A.1.F.. and as' such under military con-
trol, but now a private citizen gathering data
*or the distory of the A.I.F. in Egypt. He
bearded the lion in his den, and explained the
nature of his mission. Allenby w T as taken
aback at the intrusion and impudence of a
subordinate, but ealmed down on learning
that the status of his visitor had altered.
The result of the interview 7 was the Special
Order of the Day, issued by the C.-in-C. to
the A. and N.Z. troops on the eve of the
departure of the first troopships. Enough
copies were printed to give one to each man.
and the original may be seen in the War
Museum.

“Herodot”: Touching quaint occupations
for ex-parsons (B. S/l/’25). I know a former
priest who keeps a pub and a one-time
Methodist minister who is a dentist. Also,
Queensland once had a highly successful
bookmaker who started his career by graduat-
ing with honors from University College,
Oxford, taking holy orders and coming to
Australia, where he
held a curacy in
one of Sydney’s
most fashionable
churches. A fast
lady supplied some
impetus to what
might otherwise
have been an un-
eventful life, and
by the time that
the dust of scandal
had settled, the
chief actor in the
affa i r had fled
north to the cane-
fields. and with a
bag slung round his
neck was lustily
bawling the odds at
unregistered meet-
ings. Later, hav-
ing amassed more
treasure upon
earth than he could
ever have done in
the vineyard, he re-
turned to England
and leisured ease.
There are several
barristers in the
Commonwealth who
were once Presby-
terian or Methodist
clergymen, and I
know one medical
practitioner with a
good suburban prac-
tice who first en-
tered the Church,
labored abroad in
the mission field for
nearly ten years,
and then returned
to Australia and
graduated in medi-
cine when he was
just on 40 years
old. Finally there
is an ox-parson among tho Sydney waterside
workers, and the general manager of a S.
Aus. hank who took to the black cloth.
* * * *
“Sixenatc”: Talking about vicarious pun-
ishments, a country family was staying at
our seaside boarding-house, and the conduct
of the four kids was so nearly perfect that
it occasioned general remark. “They’re not
a bit like those wild youngsters you see nearly
everywhere nowadays,” said one of the guests
to Dad. “You must have a good method of
training them.” The father beamed proudly.
“Yes.” he said; “when they were little nip-
pers every time they did anything wrong I
used to give the missus a hiding for not
training ’em better.” The lady looked quite
comfortable and happy, and no worse off for
the discipline employed to impress on her
the value of disciplinary methods with her
progeny.
* * * *
“P.X.”: The escape and recapture of half
a dozen lepers who had been brought in to the
Darwin native gaol from the Roper River
—all bad cases—recalls the methods of Dr.
Seabrook, who for a while was medical
officer in the Territory. Seabrook, who really
oozed the milk of human kindness, though
he often disguised it, had two or three bad
cases of leprosy thrown on his hands. His
plan was first to draw for them a vivid pic-
ture of the horrors in front of them and
then put them—one at a time of course—in
a boat and give them ample opportunity of
dropping overboard. The fine old man—he
was one of the first lecturers in the medical
school at the Adelaide Uni. —was quite dis-
appointed when his humanitarian little plot
invariably miscarried.
* * * *
“Cantab Saussie”: You find an interest
taken in Australia in the most unexpected
places. A South Australian who was a
member of a recent Oxford expedition to
Arctic Spitzbergen discovered that one of
their guides—Scandinavian, of course—had
two sons in “Noo South”; and, as they
were always begging the old man to join
them, he knew T a whole lot about the coun-
try—really far more than some of the Oxford
scientists. I wish he would go and take
10,000 of his brother-northerners with him:
they are a wonderfully fine type.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw the new-lit lamps arise
Like low, warm moons along the street;
I sought the query in her eyes,
And followed her with shambling feet.
Soon in the wistful candle-light
She drew a ribbon from her hair,
And laid her little bodice white,
A crumpled handful, on a chair.
And then the rich blood surging came
From feet to rosy finger-tips;
For all her girlhood gave her shame,
And all the mother sealed her lips.
And from that little sainted place
I strode to meet the joyous years.
One jasmine girl had hid her face
And waked my manhood with her tears.

“Flaming Youth”: Something of the old
feudal spirit which caused the retainers of
the Montagues and Capulets to scrap on
whenever an occasion presented seems to be
manifesting itself between the drivers and
“crews” of the privately-owned ’buses and
the new Tramway Board conveyances which
were let loose in Melbourne at the New Year.
Regarding the new arrivals as interlopers,
the others started right from the start to
obstruct their vehicles and cut them out of
fares. Naturally there were reprisals, and
the vendetta is now in full swing. The good
wishes which a relief driver on an Elstern-
wick ’bus showered upon the man he was
relieving the other morning as the latter
dropped off puzzled me, until the locum
tenens, who was in communicative mood, told
me that he was doing the job for this trip
out of sheer good fellowship. The regular
driver, it transpired, had arranged to go
round the corner to have a mill with “one
of the Board’s blankards,” and had rung up
for relief, thereby showing commendable con-
sideration for the passengers, who might
otherwise have been detained till the differ-
ence was settled. Next day the regular
driver re-appeared with a rather battered
face; but the smile upon it said as plain as
words: “But, cripes, you ought to see the
other bloke!”
* * * *
“Trevdee”: Queer shouts? I once took
three droughty-looking cockies into the bush
store-pub-G.P.O. and put the usual question
to them. The first one nominated beer;
the second didn’t drink and said he would
have a cigar; the third didn’t drink or smoke,
but instead of excusing himself he looked
across to the grocery counter and coolly pro-
nounced “I’ll have a tin of jam.” And he
did !
NOT QUITE THAT BAD.
“I feel so giddy that I want to stop dancing.”
“All right; I know a bonzer place in the
conservatory.”
“Great Scot! I don’t feel as giddy as that.”
“The Listening Insect” : There was some
merit in the plaint of the man who wrote to
the S. M. Herald complaining that, if par-
sons were to continue to be made the butts
of professional comedians when “on the
air,” he would be compelled to forbid his
family to listen-in, and would destroy his
set. Radio in other countries is rapidly
supplanting the daily newspaper, and will
doubtless some day do the same in
Australia. Most of us subscribe to the jour-
nal that faithfully reflects our ■ own
“opinions” ; and the man who regards a parson
as a fit subject for ribald laughter is likely to
consider a brewer sacrosanct. In order to
please everybody the broadcasting companies
will therefore have to send out “exclusive”
programmes to “exclusive” classes of sub-
MISSED HIS POINT.
“Had a ripping time in Melbourne — theatres, dances and suppers
every night. Didn't want to come home a bit.”
“Did your wife go?”
“I don't think you're been listening.”
seribers; which could easily be done by issu-
ing receiving sets sealed to particular wave-
lengths. Doubtless this is what will happen
in the long run. It effectually disposes of
the delusion that wireless will lead to “a
breaking down of barriers” and “a freeing of
the human spirit” and all the rest.

“Mill Hill” introduces an upset Latin :
Young Giovanni, of Babinda, intended spending the
week-end in Cairns, but there were two trains at
the station, and by mistake he boarded the Innisfail
one. It, had pulled out and was gaining fair speed,
when he, suddenly realised he was travelling in the
wrong direction. Rushing to the carriage window
he waved frantically to the fireman, who in return
threw Giovanni a playful kiss. Transferring himself
to the opposite window to repeat his gesticulations,
he intercepted a whole bunch of flying kisses from
the driver. Looking back along the train, he found
the guard giving similar evidences of frivolity and
affection j and, worse still, this sort of demonstration
being contagious, he soon discovered that passengers
leaning out of adjacent carriages were following tile
lead of the railwaymen. Pausing for a moment to
take stock of his carriage mates, Giovanni’s flaming
eyes caught mine, and he broke out in impassioned
speech. “What for you no give-a me da help to
stoppa da train, mister? I wave-a dis end, he
ehucka da kiss. I wave-a dat end, he chucka da
kiss. Every man he chucka da kiss. True, mister,
I not da love; I too sicka da heart.’’ Please,
mister, you helpa me stoppa da train.” I was about
to use my influence on Giovanni’s behalf when we
pulled up at Mopoke, the first stop on the run.
The next moment Mussolini’s disgusted countryman
was sprinting back along the line like a thirsty
navvy making for the nearest pub on pay-day.
* * * *
“Leamington”: How’s this for unskilled
burglary? After laboriously cutting their
way through the bars and locks of several
doors, a group of elementary operators gave
their undivided attention to the safe in a store
at Paddington, Brisbane. Having carried a
dozen bags of sugar some distance to deaden
the explosion, they blew the door completely
off in the usual amateurish fashion —anil
found nothing inside but valueless papers.
Their chagrin must have been increased next
day when they read in the dailies that the
safe door was not even locked. There will
doubtless be some handle rattling before they
commence their next job.
“Anaf”: The disclosure that the late
General Townshend offered a bribe of
£2,000,000 to the Turkish commander at
Kut-el-amara to let the besieged force march
out and get away (B. l/l/’25) recalls a yarn
that obtained wide currency in the early
months of the Australian occupation of Ger-
man New Guinea. It was to the effect that
the German Governor who negotiated the
agreement of surrender had paid a large sum
in gold to certain
members of the
Australian staff in
consideration of the
lenient terms he
secured. These
terms included per-
mission for all the
officials of the cap-
tured territory to
return to Germany
under a safe pass;
and the occupiers
further undertook
to respect the pro-
visions of the Ger-
man law with re-
gard to the resi-
den t s who re-
mained. The rumor
was mixed up with
another story that
a large amount of
gold known to have
been in Rabaul just
before the Occupa-
tion had mysteri-
* ously disappeared,
and many of the
troops were ready
to give it credence.
Actually, of course,
the Germans re-
ceived considera-
tion they could
never have hoped
for otherwise be-
cause the German
Governor had it in
his power to pro-
long the fighting
for months, and
could have made
the cost in lives
and money of sub-
duing the place
horribly heavy. On
the other hand,
German New
Guinea was en-
tirely cut off by
sea, so that sur-
render in the end
w a s inevitable.
Both sides knew
the facts and made
the best bargain
possible in the cir-
cumstances. That
part of the story which had to do with the
vanishing of the gold is less easy to explain.
That it was there, and that it did go missing,
is undoubted.
* * * *
“The Dip”: There is no such thing as
“honor among thieves” in the decayed under-
world of to-day. Nearly every second crook is a
“pimp,” “shelf” or “villain,” the three worst
degrees of criminal intamy, and no man
takes a mate on some burglarious enterprise
without taking an extra ticket on a spall in
gaol. In only one section of the underworld
are the majority of men “solid”; these are
the high-class magsmen, confidence-tricksters
and “dip artists*,” who, by keeping to them-
selves, enjoy fair immunity from police
prosecution. In all Australian prisons
“shelfing” is rife, and with a view to getting
into the good books of the governor or earn-
ing a substantial reduction of sentence, the
crook is only too willing to give away his
mate. If the necessary evidence is not forth-
coming he thinks nothing of manufacturing
it. The only chance of success a criminal
has to-day is when he works on his own as
a lone wolf.
•** * *
“Adamascus” : The North is not the only part
of Australia where relics of old-time Spanish
visitors have been found (B. 18/12/’24). The
wreck of a Spanish vessel lies buried in sand
on the Victorian coast near Warrnambool;
it has been there since at least 1800. At
Port Curtis, on the Central Queensland
coast, are traces of an attempt at Spanish
settlement for which De Quiros was probably
responsible; a cannon was found there
marked “Santa Barbara, 1596.” This is
the oldest relic yet found in Australia. In
Victoria was a coin dated 1717 found on the
abo. camping ground at Hamilton. In Whit-
sunday Passage, further north than Port
Curtis, there are the remains of a galleon in
a mangrove swamp, from which coins and
silver cutlery bearing Spanish marks have
been recovered. In Torres Strait there was
a mass of Spanish dollars, found by F. L.
Jardine, which weighed 921 b. and realised
£3700. Similar finds of lesser weight, some
of them coral-encrusted, have been made in
the Strait, and there are doubtless more
waiting. - ■• •
“Coot": Ministers of religion are re-
cruited_ from all sorts of callings (B.
l/l/’25) ; how about a word on some of the
equally anomalous jobs to which they go
when the high collar is found irksome or the
vineyard gets overcrowded? One of Mel-
bourne’s auctioneering firms employs as its
leading knocker-down of suburban allot-
ments a retired Baptist parson who, on his
return from a padre’s job at the war, found
no Bethel calling. Quite a number of
“stiekit” ministers in Victoria canvass for
life-insurance companies. One would natu-
rally expect to find the bookseller’s job
appealing to a retired parson, but I have
never found one in such a shop.
* * * *
“The Dip’’: How far can a man walk or
run after being badly injured? The point is
raised by the Lithgow (N.S.W.) case which
the police regard as one of suicide. Many
laymen contend that Dwyer could not have
walked from the top of the hillside to the
spot 30 or 40 yards away where his body was
found. Nevertheless “Taylor’s Jurispru-
dence” records quite a number of such cases.
In 1832 a man with a badly-cut throat ran
23 yards and climbed a gate, his body subse-
quently being found on an open road. In
another case a woman whose windpipe had
been partially severed, and a number of blood-
vessels divided, managed to walk from the
ground floor to the first floor of her home.
Even stabs that have penetrated the heart
and bullet wounds in the chest have not
always proved instantaneously mortal.
“Ex-Dig.” : It is quite true that limbless
men are not the greatest of war sufferers
(P». 25/12/’24) ; but there are neurasthenic
cases which are much worse off than the
t.b.’s. It is a curious fact that ex-soldiers
who lost limbs very rarely suffer from nerves.
The blood-letting may have countered the
effect of the shock, just as an open wound
may be less painful than a contusion. What-
ever the reason, amongst the many “maimed”
men I know I cannot recall one whose nerves
are shaken. Yet I know of scores with all
their limbs who are otherwise wrecks.
“Cartot” : Relics of Spanish maritime ex-
ploration in the Pacific (P>. 18/12/’24) turn
up in many parts, especially in New Guinea
and the Solomons. A year or so ago a
native on Guadalcanar was found in posses-
sion of a rusty flintlock musket of Spanish
workmanship, with some undecipherable
initials on the stock. This, like the belt-
buckles and pieces of broken cutlasses which
have come to light from time to time, w T as pro-
bably a relic of the attempt to found a
Spanish colony in the Solomons by Mendana
—who gave the group its name —in the
latter part of the sixteenth century; sick-
ness and the hostility of the natives caused
it to be abandoned. On the New Guinea
coast, near the mouth of the Warriar River,
are some rock-carvings unmistakably of
Spanish origin. They consist of pictures of
a typical high-pooped ship of the period;
a man in a helmet and other odds and ends
look like unfinished efforts of the artist.
There are records of Spanish articles having
been found in the possession of the natives
of Cape York and Northern Queensland,
near where Spanish ships were wrecked there
centuries ago. Apparently the Spanish ex-
plorers of the time kept well to the north,
A MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION.
JONES : “Can you recommend me a good
boarding-house ?”
SMITH : “It all depends. Do you want to
stay fat, or do you leant to reduce?”
the majority of them probably coming from
the Philippines or across from South
America. Apart from the carvings on the
rocks at Woollahra (Sydney)—the origin
of which is still doubtful —there are no traces
of any of them so far south as Sydney.
Nevertheless it is probable that more than
one Spanish vessel made its way into our
southern waters during the latter part of
the sixteenth and the early part of the seven-
teenth century. But these adventurers wore
mainly in quest of gold and such treasures
as they had found on American coasts, and,
seeing no indications of what they sought,
they sailed away again.
THRIFTY ROMANCE.

“Young man, in permanent position, wishes meet
young lady or widow view above, residing Elphinstone
line preferred ; genuine.”
In days of old when knights were bold
And tinny suits were cased in,
The debonair guest did not care
What spot his love was placed in.
To be well girled he’d walk the world,
Though paths with danger sown wore ;
Nor care a jot to count up what
The fares to Elphinstone Were.
Through east or west he’d seek the best
Girl fitted to his fancy ;
He’d ride his steed, if there was need,
To Timbuctoo or Nancy.
Alas! these days have meaner ways:
The unromantic lover
Ties down his fair to live somewhere
Small coins the fares will cover.
Less fair seems she, though fair she be,
Whom fares to see cost shillings,
Than plain young Jane who gives no pain
In reckless money-spillings.
It would be rash to waste his cash;
So, since it is his own line,
He Wants his dear to live quite near,
Upon the Elphinstone line.

But the Wild Cat will not be much annoyed
if you don’t take some of those figures very
seriously. The co. had been doing business
for nearly three and a half years when the
last accounts were made up, and in the first
19 months it issued 3911 policies assuring
£1,105,350. Some are, no doubt, life policies,
but the chances are that most of them are
endowments for long or short terms. What-
ever they are those that have survived carry
now a considerable liability; and so do those
that have been issued in the pait 22 months.
Whatever that liability is (and that can’t
be ascertained without an actuarial valua-
tion) it must be added to the deficit of
£75,994 shown above. It would certainly
take it well over the _ £100,009. The posi-
tion has, nevertheless, improved considerably,
though not yet enough to justify the direc-
tors’ hosannas. For the first time the out-
goings have been less than the income:—
First 19 months. Excess outgoings . . £32,380
Next 12 months. ~ „ .. 10,534
Past 10 months. Surplus income .. 559
For a good many years—at any rate, until
claims start to come in—the improvement
should continue, if only because the interest
earnings ought to pile up. This is how they
(with some help from sales) have moved:—
Ist period .. .. £3,003
2nd „ . . . . 14,990
3rd „ .. .. 19,925
Probably there was a larger improvement
than that in the past term compared with its
predecessor, because in the latter the direc-
tors wrote up their assets to some unknown
extent. But the co. has to go still a long
way before it can say that it is living within
its income, because each year, provided it
adds to its policies at all, it must lay by a
larger amount to provide for the claims that
loom in the distance. So far claims are
hardly worth mentioning.
The trouble with the young life office is not
so much to do business as to keep it. One
story is good until another is told, and many
a new policy is allowed to lapse after the
agent or friend of another office has got hold
of the policy-holder and poured in a broad-
side. T. ,T. Confoy, the man who promoted
the Southern Cross and is its managing
director, knew a thing or two. It was a
cheeky prospectus he issued: he had really
not a thing in the wide world to sell except
his services'; but while other men go around
offering bonuses for jobs, Confoy asked and
got £lOOO cash and 25,000 10s. shares—not
plain ordinary shares, but 8 p.c. cumulative
prefs.! And perhaps he was worth it; at
any rate, he evidently saw that the one way
to succeed was to get hold of a big share
capital, sufficient to see the office through five
or six years of hard campaigning. With the
early capital he plunged, and, shrieking
hallelujahs at the top of his voice, was pre-
sently able to sell 125,000 10s. ordinaries—
this was the fourth issue—at ss. premium.
It was great salesmanship; for up to that
time the co. wasn’t within sight of a dividend
—isn’t, in fact, within sight of one yet—
and all the time a liability in respect of the
pref. divs. was and is piling up at the rate
of £5OOO p.a. Notwithstanding the success
of the share-selling campaign the mortality
among the policies has been pretty heavy.

It seems that only about half the policies
are sticking. There is a shocking w r aste in
this, of course; a policy which a person
allows to lapse at the end of a year
does the policy-holder practically no good,
and doesn’t pay the co The cost of get-
ting new business (following the 10 to 1
formula) ran into just over two years
premiums in 1023 and just under IS months
premiums in 1924.
The co. has more than an off-chance of
pulling through and giving its shareholders
a good profit. (There are now 125.000 profs,
and 475,000 ordinaries, all of 10s. each.)
Of course it will have to depend, for some
time, at anv rate, upon the fact that the
public (and especially the young insurer)
doesn’t know much about insurance. The
premium rates for most of the older offices
were drawn up at a time when 34 or 4 p.c.
was quite as much as they thought they could
expect to earn on their funds; and actually
some offices reduced their expectations to
below 3 p.c. Obviously the less you expect
your money to earn the more you must pay
in year by year to produce a given
amount in a given period. Hence pre-
mium rates are, as a rule, much higher
now than they need be, seeing that 5 to 54
p.c. can be earned comfortably. What too
many people don’t realise is that a mere
comparison of premium rates isn’t enough:
you can’t tell that way where you are get-
ting the cheapest insurance. The compari-
son that does matter is one of net premium
rates: that is, premiums less bonuses. And
it is tremendously difficult to get such a
comparison. Obviously this office can’t pay
any bonuses for some years to come.
From one point of view it has an advant-
age over older offices: none of its money is
invested in assets earning the old low rates.
If, therefore, its premium rates are much
the same as those of the old offices, it should
show fine profits from this source; and those
profits will be a set-off against the high ex-
pense rate which is inevitable for a few
years. When (and if) it can bring this rate
down to normal (to the amount, that is,
which was provided for when the premium
rates were being calculated), the profits from
the earnings of investments should give
shareholders something worth having. “Divi-
dends,” the prospectus said, “are limited to
the payment of 12 p.c. on the paid-up capital
and 20 p.c. of the not profits of the co.”;
and that is obscure. But it probably means
that shareholders are entitled to 12 p.c.
plus 20 p.c. of the actuarial surplus—that
is, the funds out of which policy-holders’
bonuses are ordinarily paid. In a well-
managed office they are big in these days of
high interest earnings. But, though this co.
may reach such bonuses, it has a long way
to go yet.,
There is also an accident branch. In the
10 months it just about paid its way: started
off with £6009 and finished with £6039. Ex-
penses continue very high—over 53 p.c. of
premiums.

Australians, if interested at all as share-
holders in this great old money-maker, are
interested to only a small extent: there is not
even a local director in these parts—only
various local advisers. The Board in Lon-
don has generally taken a mournful view of
this young country’s goings-on, and once it
thought of selling out and putting the money
into S. America; but though it made a start
in the Argentine it never got far, and a profit
of over a quarter-million on a share capital
of £900,000 may be some comfort to it for
staying in Australia. The co. has been a
large run-holder itself, and most of its proper-
ties have been in the parts where nature
makes up for droughts by astonishing fecun-
dity at other times: hence the very erratic
conduct of the column devoted to profits.
Ilcserves are, however, so large that when
there is an actual loss the Board turns its
blind eye that way and pays a dividend:
except in the drought years 1903-04 share-
holders have had anything from 24 p.c. to
20 p.c. p.a. for half a century back—mostly
upwards of 10 p.c. It has been helped of
course by its debenture stock: there is still
£2.000,000 of it, £1,900.000 carrying 4 p.c.
and the balance what in these days seems
an incredible 3 p.c.; but the co. has bought
and holds £101,360 worth. At 6 p.c. this
debt would call for £114,000 a year; actu-
ally the co. pays out only £75,304.
How this and other money is represented
the next table shows: —

The cash position is stronger even than that,
because fixed deposits of an unknown amount
are included with mortgages, stations, etc.
Besides its squatting and finance business
the A.M.L. and F. has its wool-sales and
general agency work, and has lately bought
out Hill, Clark and Co. (Syd.) and J. M.
Peck and Sons (Melb.). Along with these
deals there has been an increase of capital*
from £520,000 in 1919 to the £900,000 of to-
day ; and there is likely to be. another issue
of 60,000 shares at par. A 15 p.c. div.
costs £57,000 more these days; but, even
so, and apart probably from very solid
additions to internal reserves, over £lBO,OOO
lias been added to visible reserves in the past
three years. Australia won’t get much of
the extra div.-money; but it is interested to
this extent —the co. is in a great position to
stand by its clients in the days of drought
that are bound to come. What Australia had
better pray for is that, in view of the high
prices which some people are paying for land
and live stock, a slump in wool doesn't
arrive along with drought. Incidentally,
the co.’s articles were altered in 1921 to allow
reserves to be capitalised; but nothing has
been done in that way yet. The new par
issue is, however, equal to a good cash bonus.

More settled conditions in the jewellery
trade, helped probably by advantageous buy-
ing (one of the working directors visited
Europe during the term, and the visit proved
“financially satisfactory”), gave the co. a
good year: after deducting the prefs.’ 7 p.c.
there was enough profit over to show Ilf
p.c. on ordinaries. Yet, considering the
amount of money in the business —liabilities
are over £lOO,OO0 —there is nothing very re-
markable about it; the co. is working lines
in which prices are cut and overhead exes,
are heavy. A big area has to be covered
to do a comparatively small turnover: there
are small subsidiary cos. in Queensland and
Maoriland and branches in Melbourne and
Adelaide. However, chiefly by developing the
jewellery side of the business, good use has
been found for a steadily-increasing amount
of capital—in 1912 it was £69,663, and it
is now £l29.BB4—and all the time, the co.
has been handled with prudence and Regard
for future profits. Various movements are
shown in this comparison :

The co. was making a fairly rapid forward
movement after the war, but like a good
many more was checked ; having set its
house in order it appears to be stepping out
again. The directors have, therefore, decided
to offer present pref. and ordinary share-
holders the unissued 20,116 shares at par—
one for every six. Shareholders are given
the option of applying for either 8 p.c. cumu-
lative prefs. or ordinaries.

As a rule the directors pay their staff a
bonus after the April balance, and that makes
a lean half-year and a zigzag profits column.
But there are wiggly bits in the dividend
column too. From 1908 to 1919 more or
less regular annual bonuses of Is. per share
were paid to shareholders, and were swal-
lowed in simultaneous calls of Is. each. By this
means Bs. per share was got in on the 20,000
shares. After 1019 the bonus was handed
over in cash; and when a couple of years
ago a lump ,of money was needed to pay for
new offices in St. George’s-terrace, £9OOO
was got in by the issue of new shares at at
premium which added nearly as much to
reserves. This is the Westralian practice t
the State Parliament long ago, to attract
newcomers, decided that when new capital
was necessary—say, for the West Australian
Bank-4,outsiders must be allowed in. That
explains the big Westralian premiums; for,
of course, if,’as in the case: of this co., there
are reserves equal to the capital, the new-
comer must expect to contribute a similar
proportion of reserves with his capital. Re-
serves have thus grown to such corpulence
that if the funds (capital and reserves) earn
5| p.c. they will provide a 15 p.c. div.
Whether they do earn 5f p.c. the Wild Cat
doesn’t know; but if they don’t there is the
business to help. And it must be a pretty
fair business: trust funds in hand now
amount to £3,599,105. having more than
doubled in 10 years. Even 2s. p.c. on that
little lot means 13 p.c. on capital The co.’s
own assets include £55,530 in premises and
£14,841 in cash, advances and public secu-
rities, and there are no liabilities. Assum-
ing the new office property is sound the secu-
rity for capital is all right; and the ease
with which the dividend (average 154 p.c. )i
has been earned, even while much of the'
capital has lately been unproductive, ought
to leave little doubt as to its maintenance
under the present more favorable conditions.

Prior to the 1920 balance the directors-
cleaned up shop. The 40.29 S shares were re-
duced from £5 to £3 and book value of
“advances” from £250,829 to £174,353. The
table takes up the story from that point. As
usual in such cases, the blade was put in
deep while the axemen were about it, and
the past year’s- £19,841 disclosed profit
probably includes some surpluses from sales
of these written-down assets. Here are

The last of the old deposits were to be
liquidated in 1923. The £B9Ol now standing
in the books plus odds and ends make liabili-
ties of £15,055, which are more than covered
by cash balances; so creditors may sleep
sound. For shareholders there is the rem-
nant of cash left over, plus small assets;
amounting to £2802 and loans on mortgage
with the lately-reduced book value of
£177.166. The reserves, which seem thor-
oughly sound, are equal to about 14s. 6d,
per £3 share; and the average undivided profit
for the past three years has been just upon
5 r> c. p.a. of the capital. That all sounds
good.

The matter here is past miscalculation and
mismanagement. Again and again the pre-
sent Board has wrung its hands and pleaded
“circumstances beyond our control.” It was
so a couple of years ago: it was so in the
early part of last year; and now, with an-
other ordinary div. passed, the accumulated
profit has to go towards paying for fire-
escape appliances, etc., which the co. has
been called upon to instal. Doubtless the
shareholders, or some of them, know the
various “circumstances” which have been—
probably still are —beyond the directors’ con-
trol ; but the public doesn’t know, and it
will therefore naturally fight shy of the
stock. Among other things considerable
structural alterations have had to be made;
and, although they have been charged up to
capital, they have only made the building
what it should have been. The same with
these new fire-escape appliances. The ques-
tion is whether in such cases dividends ought
to be suspended. The proper course
seems to be to write down capital, inasmuch
as the co. paid for something in the first
place which it didn’t get. However, writing
off won’t reduce either the mortgage or the

It will take good management to pull the co.
through : though earnings have lately shrunk,
exes, have grown, and it looks as though
there will have to be. a system of close
checks: in no business are there larger pos-
sibilities of waste of one sort and another
than in the modern residential hotel. The
property is held under lease till 1963, so
there is just on 40 years to pay off the mort-
gage and lay up enough capital to represent
the irremovable property. And meantime
there is ground rent to pay. There are
60,000 pound ordinaries.

The re-opening of the Stock Exchanges
was marked by brisk business and good turn-
over. On the opening day in Melbourne
Barriers showed great strength consequent
on the continued improvement in metal
prices. North making £5 95., an increase of
9s. 3d. compared with the last sale before
vacation. Souths’ gain was 25.: they sold
at 60s. 3d. Tin stocks also improved, and
even Mt. Lye-11 made a slight gain on brighter
reports about copper prospects. The fact
that industrial trouble is considered unlikely
at Broken Hill helps the firmness in Bar-
riers ; but a weakening of the metal market
and a temporary burst of selling steadied
buyers a bit.
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) having paid
on January 1 a 3d. div. on pref. shares,
making Is. in all, the whole of its 2,100,000
issued shares now rank alike. To pay a
3d. div. on this lot would absorb £26,250,
and on the word of the manager the co. is
hopeful of making this distribution annu-
ally for the next four years at least. The
resurrection of this mine is a damning com-
mentary on past Ivalgoorlie management.
Six years ago it was alleged to be finished,
and not one mining authority on the field
dissented. The liquidator was called in, and
he handed over the “worked out” mine to
tributors, who dug out about £750,000 worth
of gold. From royalties the liouidator paid
divs. totalling 2s. a share. Then, as rhe
property was declared to bo “looking as well
as ever,” the shareholders woke up, and the
co. was reconstructed.
* * * ’ *
Rase metal-mining in Westralia is very
sick. With the exception of a little activity
-n the copper fields of Phillips River and
Whim Creek and limited operations on the
Northampton lead-field, there is little doing.
Greenbushes and other former tin-nroducing
centres are moribund or dead. Inaccessi-
bility and costly transport are mainly re-
sponsible for this inactivity.
* * # #
Dr. Clapp’s unfavorable report on oil
possibilities in the nor’-west of Westralia
lias drawn upon him the criticism of Assist-
ant State Mining Engineer and Geologist
Blatchford. Sooled on by the Minister for
Mines, Blatchford declares (1) that Clapp’s
conclusions are mostly based not on obser-
on second-hand “evidence”; (2)
that His unfavorable opinions in at least
two instances are contradictory to his own
statements contained in an article he wrote
in 1922; (3) some of Clapp’s deductions are
contrary to the expressed opinion of other
geologists who have been on the spot. Finally,
Blatchford declares that Clapp’s report is
not worth serious consideration because “he
reported on what he did not see, contra-
dicted his own statements, and did not
adhere to the facts as they presented them-
selves.”
* * * *
To the end of 1924 Westralia had pi’o-
vided the world with over £152,000,000
worth of gold. The trouble is you can’t
turn the mill-wheel with the water that has
passed.
“Horseshoe Bend”: It wasn’t Harry
Gregory who “inaugurated State batteries
in the West” (B. 8/l/’25). Two Ministers
of Mines, Wittenoom and Lefroy, had held
sway before Gregory arrived in 1901, and
it was the first of these, the much-execrated
“Ten Foot Ned” of the alluvial days, that
the small claimholder had to thank for State
crushing plants. Lefroy extended the system
—Lord! what a lot of liquor and oratory
used to flow at the opening of a new battery
in the late ’nineties!—and it was in good
going order when Gregory came along.
* * * *
The Westralian Government has engaged a
S’African Commissioner to tell it how to
achieve low working costs in ore-raising and
treatment. His report will probably start:
“First, find your mines.” Westralia had
some; it worked them out. That is the
simple truth that we don’t always care to
admit. Possibly amalgamation might effect
economies, but nothing of note has resulted
from the amalgamation of the Ivanhoe and
Lake View and Star. Gold-mining in W.A.
is on the wane because no new lodes have
been found to replace those worked out, and
when this is realised it will be understood
what is wrong with the industry. Never-
theless the Commissioner might give a few
hints as to how best to handle the big
Wiluna antimonial lodes, which, as regards
size, might be compared to the deposits of
South Africa.
* * * *
Ives Reward (W.A.) shareholders have
waited five years or so for a treatment plant
and dividends. At last they have got the
plant, but, so far, it has produced nothing
but mechanical troubles. And nothing has
yet been heard of the clean-up promised for
December 20. The manager reports: “Resi-
dues assayed indicate that eventually our
working costs will be low,” whatever that
may mean.
* * * *
London having decided to spend £30,000 in
main-shaft sinking and driving at Wiluna
to see whether development will confirm the
high values reported from the bores drilled
last year, the price of antimony assumes im-
portance. Price now ruling is £65 per ton,
and the Wiluna lodes are high in the metal.
Average gold content may be accepted defi-
nitely as something between 445. and 48s.
per ton, which, with the antimony value
thrown in, should, if the treatment problem
is solved, leave a margin over all expenditure.
Treatment of this type of ore has, however,
always proved difficult.
* * * *
“R.N.W.’s” memory is stirred: —
Reference to the present attempt to revive old
shows such as the Wealth of Nations at Dunnsville
(W.A.) recalls the afternoon Dunn arrived at die
Union Bank, Coolgardie, in 1894, with blocks of
gold-impregnated quartz packed on camels. The
Warden’s Office was closed when the caravan arrived,
so the excited crowd had to wait until next morning
before Dunn could post his notice of pegging. All
that night Coolgardie was thronged with excited and
speculative men, and the hotels worked double shift.
Meantime George Lindsay—explorer David’s brother
—had arrived at the 25 Mile, en route from the
90 Mile to Coolgardie, and there, hearing of the
treasure and that Dunn had passed through, headed
his camels north again and watched for the contact
of Dunn’s camel pad with the 90-mile road. Success-
ful in this, he followed it up, located the find, and
had pegged leases north and south of Dunn’s main
property by the time the dust-begrimed heterogeneous
human wave from Coolgardie broke over the ridge.
It was Dunn’s black boy who “specked” the rich
“floaters” which were supposed to have been shed
from the reef on the ridge above. I saw one
floater broken in the presence of Alex. Forrest in
front of the old Bank of Australasia in Bayley-
street. The shattered pieces were held together with
strings of gold like tape. Yet the reef pegged as the
main lode was valueless! The blackboys employed
by camel-equipped prospecting parties in those
days had wonderful eyes for “specking” gold, even
the dulled and weathered specimens lying on the
surface. Palmer, a North Queensland boy, sighted
from a camel’s back the first specimen which led
to “Lindsay’s Find,” near the Hit or Miss.
G.-m. Williams, of the Borneo Oil Option
Syndicate, lias returned to Perth, where
most of the shares are held. With Ilngen-
raad, Dutch petroleum engineer, he explored
the concessions in Borneo, and says he is
quite satisfied. Country surrounding the
syndicate’s area is held by various members
of the Oil Trust, and Williams says there
is a chance of one of the established oil cos.
becoming interested in the syndicate’s option.
* * * •#
A telegram from Eumungalan (N.T.) in
December stated that a party had started
out from the Victoria River (N.T.) with a
herd of cattle, to prove the new goldfield
found s.-w. of Tanami, near the W.A. border.
Specimens brought in were very rich, and
it is said the reefs are strong and kindly-
looking. Tom and Jack Laurie and Jim
Wickham had been out there with camels for
a long time, and in addition to gold found a
lake, 20 miles round and 40 feet deep in
the centre, in first-class pastoral country.
.Tack Laurie died on the track close by
Tanami in October last. From time to time
natives have brought pieces of gold-studded
quartz in to Tanami, and pointed south as
its place of origin. Allan Davidson got gold
there in ’9B. but missed the water, and could
not stop. Dr. 11. I. Jensen examined and
sampled Tanami, and considered it would
prove to be one of the finest goldfields of
Australia, and in this he confirmed the David-
sons’ opinion expressed years before.
Alec Gordon’s office rep' ; that the South
Australian Jil Wells are calling for tenders
for storage tanks to hold 50,000 gallons
to compiy with the requ .cments of the
Fede: al Government's bonus of £50,000 for
oil. That sounds like business —o_ some kind.
If the co. doesn't get oil it is certainly likely
to get a better market for its shares.
* * * *
Mt. Cuthbert passes from W. B. Arnold's
embrace to that of the London metal firm
of Brandeis, Goldschmidt and Co. The secret
is kept of how much the Commonwealth
Bank has to write off owing to the sale. If
it had clung on it might have helped the
shareholders to get a crumb back, but with
Denison Miller gone no one in the bank
seemed to want to carry on a mining derelict.
Even with Cuthbert’s collapse Cloneurry’s
tally isn’t as deplorable as that of Chillagoe,
for however deeply its list of losses is scored,
both Mt. Elliott and the Duchess down to
the 3 p.c. zone paid well. For Trekalano,
Hampden and the outlying shows the only
hope is to pool with Mt. Oxide. Brandeis,
Goldschmidt is one of the old group of metal
buyers that controlled Broken Hill products
up to the war. Since the dove of peace flut-
tered forth from Versailles Mt. Elliott is
supposed to have slid into the firm’s control;
but Collins House may be in the Cuthbert
deal in some way. At any rate, as its most
recent Cloncurry move was to prepare the
way for fusing Mt. Elliott and Hampden, it
looks as if Cuthbert will fall into the lap of
the big Collins-street amalgamating experts.
But it may have to make a start on its own
account: the Queensland Government may
tire of having the show shepherded and call
for work. Cuthbert has cost its shareholders
about £400,000, debenture-holders £55,000,
and the holders of prior- lien debentures pi-ob-
ably £15,000. The trouble started with the
war, which crippled finances; and'the erection
of a costly smelter helped its downfall.
# * * *
There is another hang up at the Golden
Gate, Mathinna (Tas.), to allow the mine
to be got down further and the Zig-Zag reef
cut. After that, and with proper connec-
tions established, Billie Cundy is confident
profits will flow. As to which it may be
remarked that Mathinna isn’t Bendigo.

Trustees G. W. Shirrefs and ,T. Mc-
Meikan, with G. D. Meudell, of the Lake
Bunga and Lake Tyers oil syndicate, having
visited the bore, report being “quite satisfied
with the existence of petroleum gas and
petroleum.” The world is told that 70,000 ft.
of “wet” gas a week forces its way up the
bore, through a column of water 1076 ft. deep,
and that this gas is guaranteed to produce
petrol, carbon and helium. The trustees re-
commend that a sipall gasometer be erected
“to supply gas to heat the boiler and light
the camp,” and that an application be sub-
mitted to the Tambo Council for permission
“to lay gas-pipes to reticulate the growing
town of Lakes Entrance.”

For the 25 days ended December 29, 2452
tons of ore were smelted at the New Guinea
Copper Mines for 340 tons of matte esti-
mated to contain 96 tons copper and 1620 z.
gold. Work is progressing in the open
cut. Shortage of skilled white labor inter-
rupted work at the converter. Additional
workers were to arrive this week.

Lander Oil Co. resumed drilling at No. 2
bore on Jan. 4. At the close-down before
the holidays the drill had reached 1345 ft.
The formation is reported to be similar to
that penetrated by the first bore —chiefly
sandy grey shales full of organic matter, with
considerable coal.

“0.M.”: Stanthorpe (Q.) is evidently the
home of the green diamond —the rarest of
all gemstones. At Wembley Park one weigh-
ing a carat and a half was on exhibition.
It was valued at £1750, and was said to be
the only known stone of the kind. Two or
three years ago my eye was attracted by a
coruscation from a heap of tailings on an
abandoned Stanthorpe tin-claim. I found
its source to be a green diamond, a flaw-
less stone of limpid beauty, a perfect octa-
hedron, and weighing two carats and a half.
I offered the stone to Sydney gem merchants,
and the utmost I could obtain for it was
20 guineas. lake the apothecary in “Romeo
and Juliet” my poverty but not my will
consented, and the gem was sacrificed. I
strongly suspect that this is the stone
which was exhibited at Wembley. Now two
more of these rare stones have been found
at Diamond Vale, a couple of miles from
Stanthorpe, on freehold land. They weigh
about three-quarters of a carat each, and
are perfect octahedrons. In addition, two
white diamonds weighing a carat each, and
two golden diamonds, slightly smaller, have
just been found in the same locality—all
perfect octahedrons. One of the miners tells
me that he has found about 20 stones alto-
gether. At the Franco-British Exhibition
the Queensland Government exhibited two
fine white Stanthorpe diamonds, which were
purchased from the late A. H. E. Barton,
member for the district. Hitherto, however,
the size and number of the stones which have
been found here have not been sufficient to
engage the serious attention of miners. The
discovery of three green diamonds within so
short a time suggests that the geological con-

GENERAL J. K. FORSYTH, who has been
leading the forces of the National Fed-
eration in Victoria of late.
On a queer character: —
C. J. de Garis, who made a spectacular exit from
Melbourne last week, described himself as “a super-
optimist.” At lunch one day lately he told us
a yarn about an argument with a politician over a
business deal. The politician declared that even
the greatest financial authorities were sometimes
astray. “I told him that I didn’t consider myself
a great financial authority,” said De Garis; “I
was just De Garis. Directly he heard the name—we
had not been introduced —he fell in immediately with
my ideas.” Not a gleam of suspicion that his
vanity was ridiculous showed on the man's face. As
one of his friends has stated, when he had a cheque-
book in his hand he was like a child with a
favorite toy. That propensity, and an equally childish
craving for applause—gratified at certain periods of
his life in very unchildlike ways—have spoilt a
career that might have been useful to Australia. For
the pleasant-spoken, good-looking fellow had ability
above the average and was loyal in many of his
friendships. Now that the crash has come tncre
are many people along the Murray Valley, and
some even at Kendenup, who regret it.
Mrs. Margaret Corlis, who has died at 85,
on the N.S.W. North Coast, was the pioneer
woman doctor of Australia. Born at On-
tario, she attended the Canadian University
of Kingston, and taking her degree joined
her medical husband on the Bellingen in
1891. Followed a trip to W.A. in the days
of the gold boom, but both returned to
Sydney 15 years ago. Three sons followed
in the footsteps of father and mother, and
two are still practising on the North Coast.
A trio of N.S.W. railway heads: —
James Fraser, who has had his appointment as
Ghief Commissioner renewed for seven years and
£2OOO added to his salary, is 63, and a native of
Braidwod (N.S.W.). His assistants, who will collect
£2400 p.a. each, are O. A. Brain and A. D. J.
Forster. Brain, who hails from Gloucester (Eng.),
was one of “Eddy’s men,” and has lately been Chief
Electrical Engineer. Forster, who is only 34, is
an old Fort-street boy, and graduated from the
Eveleigh workshops. He secured the Railway Jubilee
Scholarship, tenable for four years at the Sydney
Uni., took his B.E. degree when he was 21, and
spent three years abroad. For a while he was
assistant works manager at the Government Dock
Yards, Newcastle (N.S.W.), but when the Government
wanted the plans of the city railway prepared in
1914 he was shifted over to the Metropolitan Rail-
way Construction Branch and became principal de-
signing engineer.
Vickers, who will
probably succeed
Mac Lean as secre-
tary to Premier
Allan (Vic.), has
served under 17
Premiers as clerk
and chief clerk.
Before he entered
the service, 36
years ago, he was
a reporter on a
Bendigo paper. He
is not nearly so
solemn as he looks,
and had he been
more pushing he
might have been in
a top job long ago.
PETER ALLEN,
the humorist of
the S. Aus.
Parliament.
Chief Justice Murray, of S.A., is going
to spend the rest of the year in Europe, and
will be farewelled by the Bar at a dinner
op January 30. Judge Poole will be acting-
Chief, also Lieutenant-Governor, in the ap-
proaching absence on furlough of Governor
Bridges. F. W. Richards. Crown Solicitor,
becomes a temporary Judge, and into his
place Hannan, Parliamentary draftsman,
steps up.
While Bishop Phelan, of Sale (Vic.), who
has just died in Dublin, was dean at St.
Pat.’s under Archbishop Carr, a Collins-street
parson chided him for being hospitable to
pressmen when they called. He and his
chief, said the critic, asked the reporters it
they had mouths on them or something equ-
ally pernicious. And the best of it was the
dreadful charge was true. A hue human
man, the bishop would have died too soon
if he had lived to be a hundred. •
Victoria’s fine Education Department lost
two 65-year-old veterans at the end ot
1024 —J. H. Betheras, Chief Inspector, and
J. ,T. Bothroyd, Senior Inspector. The pair
know their job to the last pothook, -they
started half a century ago as pupil-teachers
at eight shillings a week, then stewed tor
the M.A. degree at a time when there was
no Tate to grandmother people through the
University, and by grit and bulldog energy
forced their way to the top. For a quarter-
century Betheras has been caring ior the
physical well-being of Victorian nippers; and
Bothroyd, during the war, organised the
schools’ comforts fund work.
Maoriland’s latest Judge, H. H. Ostler,
who succeeds to the late John Salmond s
pest, has had a remarkable career. Born
in M L in 1876, he was sent to England
as a child, and returned to farming in Levin.
At 24 he changed the plough for the brief,
and went to Victoria College. Ihen, after
being in turn Robert Stout’s associate and
Crown Prosecutor in W ellington, he joined
an Auckland firm. Here the famous Small-
field case was one of his triumphs. It was
over a £lO,OOO insurance by the widow ot
a man drowned in the Waikato River: tlie
insurance co. suggested suicide, and the rela-
tives claimed accidental drowning. Ostler
took the matter to the English Privy Coun-
cil. and returned with judgment for Mrs.
Smallfield. Add to this record a couple of
lengthy big-game expeditions to Africa —the
new Judge is part-owner of 10,000 acres in
Tanganyika—and you have part of the
record of a full life. What Auckland chiefly
likes to remember about Ostler, however, is
that in the days of the ’flu epidemic, when the
city was in dire straits, he. with his usual
energy and thoroughness, organised a party
of helpers and put in considerable time in
the humanitarian task of digging graves for
tlie plague victims.
A picturesque figure faded into the sunset
the other day in Watriama. king-claimant of
the Loyalty Islands, a group under French
control, lying between New Caledonia and
the New Hebrides. Watriama contended
that the French had ousted him because he
did his best to bring his people under the
rule of Beretania. His admiration of
Britain was something more than lip service,
for he served with N. S. Wales troops in the
S’African War and also in the big rough-up,
being wounded in France. He never missed
a chance of putting forward his claims, but
in neither Australia nor England did he ever
get a serious hearing. He was a keen mem-
ber of the R.S.S.L., and it was he who
hoisted the Union Jack at Sydney Town Hall
when it had been left out of the decorations
in the days when the affable Lambert was
Lord Mayor.
Gone to his last camp, “Old Bill” Clarke,
veteran carrier and blazer of tracks. He
was one of the first to , attempt the long
overland journey from Bowen to the Gulf
fields, when the route was infested with war-
like abos. After resting from his labors as
hotelkeeper at Townsville (Q.), Bill again
took to the roads and carted most of the
machinery for the Etheridge field.
11. L. Conran, who died in London on
Christmas Day, was well known in Aus-
tralia at the end of last century. A midship-
man at the same time as Admiral Cress-
well, he left the Navy early, only to suffer
shipwreck in the Queensland drought of the
’eighties. Then he moved down to Adelaide,
and did well in the Broken Hill and Kal-
goorlic booms. “In early and out early” was
his marketing motto.
Cap’n Bone, who recently hauled down his
flag as superintendent of the New Zealand
Shipping Co., first met Bill Massey 55 years
ago. Bill was a lad of 14 when he shot
his luggage aboard the City of Auckland to
join his parents, who had emigrated to the
Windy Isles while the future Prime Minister
stayed behind to complete his education in
his native Ireland. The future superinten-
dent of the great shipping co. was. one of
the young apprentices on the City of Auck-
land.
“Oenpelli”: The late Paddy Cahill was
a type of Protector of Aborigines that
we can ill afford to lose. His word
was law in his district, and _ his
methods of enforcing it were original.
Two boys were always fighting, so he
tied them back to back by the elbows all
day. They became friends. Another boy
was lazy, and Paddy told him that if he
wouldn’t run he would hop like a kangaroo,
so he short-hobbled him for a day. The
blacks called him Kangaroo from then on.
The cures were lasting.
“T. 0.1.” : Everybody knew about Cockle’s
pills in our grandfather’s day; and it was
through that Justice Lutwyche mentioned
in “Judges and Lawyers” (B. l/l/’25) that
we got one of the pillmaker’s family in Aus-
tralia. Lutwyche, called to the English Bar
in 1840, went the Oxford Circuit until
1853, when failing health sent him to N. S.
Wales. As a member of the N. S. Wales
Leg. Council he was Solicitor- and Attorney-
General, and in 1859 he was appointed Judge
for the Moreton Bay district, and later was
sole Judge in the new colony of Queensland.
A few years afterwards Sir George Bowen,
the Governor, ignoring Lutwyche’s services,
wrote the Secretary of State for the Colonies
asking for a Chief Justice—it was not so
much a lawyer they wanted, Bowen said, as
a gentleman. The Sec. of State was a cynic,
and sent the son of the patent pillmaker.
Dead in Switzerland, Arthur Reginald
Butterworth, barrister, of the Inner Temple,
who settled in Sydney in 1883. From ’B7
to ’9l he was Crown Prosecutor. On re-
turning to London he practised mostly before
the Privy Council and other appeal courts
until 1914, when he went abroad to live on
his ample means.
A record surely! On New Year’s Eve Mr.
and Mrs. John Hoy, of I.ithgow (N.S.W.),
celebrated the golden jubilee of their wedding.
There were present 12 children (8 daughters
and 4 sons), 21 grandchildren and 3 great
grandchildren. Death has not called on the
family for four generations.
One of . the most noted of the sheep and
cattlemen along the Clarence (N.S.W.) gave
it best recently. Wherever horsemen con-
gregated William Barnett, of Hernani, was
toasted as the finest horsebreaker of his time.
Learning the game on Liverpool Plains, he
made his way to the Clarence 40 years ago.
and finished up a land-owner at 72.
“Clerk”: Redfern (N.S.W.) is not the
only suburb with an ’umble Chief' Bumble.
The Mayor of Port Melbourne is a lamp
foreman in the Vic. Railways, his abhor-
rence of dirt being surpassed only by Clapp
himself. His name is Patrick Murphy. He
is not a Mason.
Walter Herford,
the Anglican padre
who went out tra-
gically in the Gos-
ford (N.S.W.) dis-
trict lately, was a
son of that .T. J.
Herford who helped
to pioneer the
leather industry in
N. S. Wales. Estab-
lishing a tannery
in old South Creek
(St. Mary’s) half a
century ago, he
prospered so well
that he was in-
duced to move to
the big Botany
establishment which

mains.
GEORGE
HIGH LARD,
the C. William-
son theatrical
producer.
A queer identity was “Ted” Young, peren-
nial leader of the unemployed, whose senti-
ments earned him the name of “Trotsky”
amongst his Melbourne pals. A human
bottle of vitriol burning to hurl itself at
“the capitalistic oppressors,” he had wan-
dered over a good part of the world, railing
against conditions as they are, and neglect-
ing to improve his own. He regularly slept
in the open, even when he had money, partly
because he had got used to it and partly be-
cause he objected to pay tribute to the tyrant
landlord; and he ate meals only to keep him-
self alive and v spite the capitalist. He was
accidentally drowned in the Yarra on Christ-
mas Day, and it was a week before, his. body
was recovered. After the colonial inquiry, a
handful of communistic comrades gave him
a “Red” funeral. The “Red Flag” was sung
instead of hymns, and the funeral sermon
consisted of an oration on the “murder” of
the departed brother.
“Akran”: How’s this for birth coinci-
dences? Three members of the Clark
family, two boys and a girl, living at Burra-
gorang (N.S.W.) and aged respectively 22,
19 and 17, all came to light on November
19.
“The Deacon” : At the triennial elections
held by the Dominican Nuns at their Mait-
land (N.S.W.) headquarters, three, good
Australians were elected to the most impor-
tant offices. Mother Mary Philippa Byrne,
who succeeded her sister, Mother Gonsalve,
as Prioress, is a daughter of late Police-
Inspector Byrne. The Sub-Prioress is one
of the old southern family of the De Laurets,
and the Mistress of Novices is a member of
the well-known Keys family, of Maitland.
Since responsible government in N.S.W.,
dating back to 1856, the Ma State has had
26 Parliaments, which works out at a little
longer than 2 \ years to each Parliament.
During that time it has had 923 M’s.L.A.,
which means that each election on the aver-
age brings in 36 new men. In that grand
total the Smiths and Browns have held their
place—the former have had 12 of then-
name returned and the latter 10. The Joneses
(6), on the other hand, have been beaten
by Campbells (S) and Thompsons and Clarks
(7 each).
N. S. Wales is to have four Area Com-
missioners to see to the smooth running of
its trains: C. A. Hodgson, who will look
after the Metropolitan area at £l6OO p.a., is
a Cambridge M.A. who learned railways with
the London and North-Western. He was
imported by the late E. M. G. Eddy, and be-
came superintendent of lines, and afterwards
chief traffic manager. The other three will
commence on a salary of £6OO p.a. less. W. C.
Quinton, who will keep an eye on the north,
started watering station gardens at West
Maitland at half a crown a week. From a
goods clerk he rose to be superintendent of
goods and live stock. F. J. Williams, the
western-area potentate, is a Mudgee
(N.S.W.) native, and passed through practi-
cally every grade in the traffic branch, rising
to outdoor-assistant to the chief traffic mana-
a-er. The south will be controlled by J. D.
Reid, ex-telegraph operator, stationmaster
in various parts, and superintendent in the
Goulburn district. The Melbourne express
runs through his territory.
A RARE SPECIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Percy McDonald, the escaped prisoner recently
re-arrested at Morphettville (S.A.) races, was described
in the police handbills as a ‘Sydney Domain orator.’ ”
They’ll tell you rhetoric is dead in these degenerate
days
When nobody with chunks of it a Senate thrills and
sways.
The truth of that assertion I emphatically doubt;
’Tis only in a different place the dope is handed out.
Demosthenes with pebbles filled his talking cavity
And bellowed out his periods beside the sounding sea.
’Twas in the Roman forum or the legislative hall
That Cicero’s seductive tones were wont to rise
and fail.
The Burkes and Grattans, Pitts and Floods, reserved
their gift immense
Of forcible loquacity for educated gen is.
There’s mighty little of it now in Hansard to be
spied ;
Our last of statesmen-orators went out when Deakin
died.
The Church has had some silver-tongued divines, I
will allow.
But tell me where the Wesleys are, and where the
Spurgeons now !
The mastery of stirring words the modern prelate
lacks
That icaugnt the Welsh revivalists and knocked the
Cousin Jacks.
Still in the Courts the voices rise in glib impassioned
pleas
Of agitated juniors and ponderous K.C.’s ;
But should a Curran come again in wig and gown
to spa r,
D’you think to rise to instant fame and fortune at
the Bar?
Vet tell mo not that rhetoric’s dead. It’s simply
greased its straps
And rolled its swag and lobbed away to haunts of
poorer chaps
Than those who make the laws, or sit the jury-box
within,
Or go to hear the parsons talk about the wage of
sin.
One orator, and only one, about Australia strayed,
And many a “Wanted” placard starred his almost
vanished trade.
He hadn’t been an ornament of pulpit or of court,
Nor did he wear the railway pass that legislators
sport.
They roped him in at Morphettville. His luck,
’twould seem, was crook;
He wasn’t using eloquence the punters’ bets to book.
Yet lynx-eyed cops at half a glance could read his
calling plain.
You can’t mistake an Orator —-not ev’n from the
Domain.

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“8.5. A." : According to C. F. Murray, who
for nearly a quarter of a century was manager of
the Oordillb Downs station, in the north of S. Aus.,
blacks up there are getting too tired to ride a horse.
When he went to Blanchewater first, about 30 years
ago, it had some of the finest riders in Australia,
but now it is a trouble to get a black boy to mount
even a quiet horse. The abos. get money too easily
to take on anything where any sort of risk is
attached. They go out dogging, and make big
cheques from dingo scalps, especially when the
bitches are pupping. Some of them run a buggy
with a flash four-in-hand, and it won’t be long
before aristocratic binghis are sitting back in their
Fords.
* * * *
“Anon”: The Flindersias are a fine family.
Yellow-wood (Flindersia oxleyana), known as long
jack of the N.S.AY. Northern
Rivers, is much esteemed by
coachbuilders. It is also useful
for flooring, but, like most of the
family, it requires to be well
seasoned, as it. shrinks consider-
ably. There is another member
of the family (I do not know the
botanical name) known as crow’s
ash in Queensland, and teak in
N. S. Wales. It is of a hard,
close-grained, oily nature, and
makes the best dance floor of any
Australian timber; and it shares
with spotted gum (Eucalyptus
maculata) the distinction of oe-
ing the best fuel-wood we have.
It burns with a black smoke like
coal, creates a great heat, and if
you boil your billy on a fire
built from it you find the outside
of the vessel thickly coated with
soot. Another member of the
family (F. schottiana) , bumpy ash
or eudgery, might be put to better
use. W hen properly seasoned, it
makes splendid tool-handles, being
long in the grain and tough. I
believe there is an opening for
someone to start making axe-
handles out of it. It is some-
times used for lining and floor-
ing, but unless well selected will
have ugly knotty spots (“bumps”)
in it. Unlike their relation, teak,
F. oxleyana and F. schottiana
are very bad-burning woods.
Maple, the best, cabinet wood in
Australia, is also a member of
the family ; but it grows only in
the north of Queensland.
“Mimax”: If ordinary precautions are
taken, a rifle will never lead up (B. 11/12/’24).
Buy a good rifle and clean it with a good cleaning
rod. Don’t use black powder cartridges, but use
English ammunition where procurable. I am aware
that smokeless powder deteriorates in the tropics
in the wet season, but I have yet to find it do so
in one year, and the man who keeps a year’s supply
of ammunition ahead is rare. I refer to metal
cartridges, not cardboard cases. Smokeless powder
tends to rust the barrel rapidly if not cleaned out,
but B.S.A. “Safetipaste” used according to instruc-
tions will prevent this. I have never had a leaded
barrel since I gave up black powder, and that is
15 or more years ago. A final warning. Never use
Eley .22 Long Rifle smokeless cartridges in a Yankee
rifle. I have never found anything to equal them,
but Yank rifles won’t stand them.
* * * *
“Budg*”: I want some member of the
Council to tell me a quick means of getting rid
of a swarm of bees that have taken up residence
in the side of our house. They are the genuine
article all right. M r e can’t sleep on some nighls
for the ceaseless murmuring drone that goes on
inside our bedroom wall. The house is of hardwood
and roughcast, and we don’t want to pull down half
the side to get them out.
“Ino”: “Saaedi” asks (B. 4/12/ 24) ‘Ts
the rabbit learning to live without water?” No,
he learned that when he became a nuisance or
probably before. Between Orange and Forbes
(N.S.W.) there are hundreds of paddocks netted
in where water cannot be found 24 hours after
heavy rains. For months at a stretch every year
you could not find there a drink for a mouse. In
SELF-CONTROLLING.
DAD: “Didn't I tell y’ to tie that horse up?"
CUOOM : “I did, sir. I tied the reins to the scat."
the 1901-02 drought rabbits were plentiful in these
paddocks when not a blade of grass, green or dry,
could be found. Every weed and leaf had been
eaten by sheep and cattle. The rabbits not only
lived through this period, but were fat all the
time. For more than six months not a drop of
rain or the least sign of dew could be found there.
Ten feet down the dirt was dry as ashes. f On the
other hand, rabbits near the creeks died in thousands
when water gave out.
* * * *
“Mynesabier”: A visitor to the Oaks gold-
field (N.Q.) in the years 1908-10 would have seen a
frequent use made of the chain for restraining pris-
oners. In the early days of the rush the two police
w'ere in tents, and to secure their first prisoners they
had to make use of a trace-chain, which was fastened
to a tree near by. During the absence of the police
at Georgetown, 80 miles distant, some sport cut the
lockup down. After this the forked stick of the
bough-shade had to serve till such time as a hut was
built for the force; then an adjacent leaning tree was
made the lockup. One hard-case, after recovering
from his burst, climbed the tree, and, after a long
struggle, managed to pull the branches through the
loop of the chain, and was in the act of walking off
when he was made fast again by the “watch-house”
keeper.
* * * *
“Ilerodot”: Tlie reclamation of malarial
swamp-country in Palestine by the planting of Aus-
tralian gums suggests that the widespread destruction
of these trees in the coastal belt of Eastern Australia
may be followed by serious results. The area down
to Sydney’s back door, just north of Manly, is poten-
tially malarial country, and the anopheline mosquito,
the carrier of malaria,
abounds in millions,
awaiting suitable hosts
to give it a start. To
a certain extent it is
held in check by the
gums which flourish
along the coast. Yet
in many parts the trees
are being cut down
and wasted wholesale,
without any effort be-
ing made at re-affores-
tation. Meanwhile
other countries in
which malaria is a
scourge are spending
large sums in planting
gums in the hope of
driving out the mos-
quito, and thus re-
claiming areas at
present uninhabitable.
Greece recently decided
to plant a million
trees, the United States
Government has been
carrying out eucalyptus
afforestation on a large
scale for years past,
and much success has
attended the work in Palestine.
* * * *
“S. Q. Whyffe”: Yes, frogs can change
color all right (B. 4/12/’24). As I was crossing a patch
of brown gravel bordering a creek, my eye was caught
by what appeared to be a yellow pebble, but was
really a frog. It was about the length of a tree-
frog, but slimmer of body and sharper in snout
and of a uniform canary tint. Further scrutiny
disclosed another, it being the color of the gravel,
Returning a few minutes later, and desiring further
study, I could not at first find the frogs, but when
detected they were both the color of the gravel.
“Longo” : I liave seen quite a number of
white snakes here in the South Burnett (Q.). Once,
when corn-pulling with half a dozen abos. from the
Barambah Settlement, we chanced upon one of the
reptiles 20 inches long; that’s the biggest I have
seen. The boys back-pedalled in terror. I advanced
to the attack with a waddy amidst warnings of
“Look out, boss, that pfeller been jump all-same
deattnadder and killem man all same quick,” but
the only casualty was the snake. They are canvas-
color, which is near enough to white. A unique
feature is the extreme sharpness of their nose, which
adds to their repulsiveness.
“Akran” : My mate and I were falling scrub near
Rous (Richmond River, N.S.W.), and were half
way through a ti-tree sapling, when I heard an
awful din behind me. My mate was cutting all
sorts of capers and yelling. And no wonder —
3ft. of white snake was leaving his neck and
streaking for the bush. I streaked too. and catching
up to his nibs killed him with a stroke of my axe.
It seemed that the snake had fallen from the tree
my mate was working on, and coiled round his
shoulders. We took the corpse home and bottled
it in spirits, and it is still at our place for anyone
to inspect.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: As one w'iio has baked a
few hundred camp-oven loaves, let me endorse
“Troophorse’s” recipe (B. 18/12/’’24) for “cocoanut”
yeast, with the added remark that the cocoanut
juice doesn’t matter —the rice, flour, sugar and salt
will make as good a baking yeast as anyone could
wish. It is a “lively” yeast, and new hands are
advised not to open the bottle cork downwards over
the flour.
“Tarago”: “Animals don’t reason.” No?
I was walking along the bank of a drain; on one
side of it was a thick scrub, into which my two
dogs had gone to chase wallabies. I could hear the
tykes yelping far back in the scrub; then the steady
thud, thud of a wallaby coming along a pad. I

the “B” battery is out of order.”
“If I wasn't a perfect gentleman, my dear, I’d feel like saying they

stood still and watched. The hopper broke from
cover a few yards from where I was standing, and
sat on the bank of the drain for a few seconds
listening for the dogs. Then, without haste, lie
jumped into the channel, which contained about
six inches of water, and leisurely followed its course
for about a chain ; then, turning on his tracks, he
hopped back through the water and left the drain
at the exact spot he had entered it, disappearing
along the pad from which he had first emerged.
I don’t call that instinct. It’s plain dinkum reasoning.

MY RIVER OF DREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, wide across the world 1 went
And walked by many streams,
But still forever called to me
The River of my Dreams.
The weeping willows softly throw
Green shadows in a pool,
M’here spec kled gudgeon used to wait
For sportsmen—after school.
A painted float of cork and quill,
A burnished fly-hook small,
A wriggling earthworm and the sky
So blue above it all!
The rustling bulrush whispered to
The slender swaying reeds,
And you could smell the trodden mint
And musty waterweeds.
1 watch that painted float go down,
In recollection, yet,
M’ith all my leaping heart athrill,
On finny capture set.
Ah, Youth is like a cup of wine
That each in turn will drain,
And never man or maid enjoy
Its golden draught again!
By Dillon’s farm a creek outran
To meet the river bend—
The river with a magic that
For me shall never end:
IN MELBOURNE NOW.
“Wot’s the time, mate?”
“Sorry, my — er—watch isn’t going.”
“Ain’t going! I'll bet yer it is!”
The river of a childhood lone
But filled with fancies fine;
The river with a silver voice
That evermore is mine.
To cross the Mississippi wide,
Or boat the Murray down,
To see the splendid Clarence sweep
In flood by Grafton town—
Each brought in turn its glamor ’neath
My later moons and suns;
But ne’er a music like to one
Small mountain stream that runs
By Boggy Flat, past Oberon,
And down by Whalan’s mill ;
The River of my Youth that brings
Me soothing echoes still;
The river that, throughout a life
Of care and effort long,
Still sweetens all the strident years
M’ith an unfailing song.
Old Dillon, with his snow-white hair,
And Biddy, his good wife,
Have long ago been numbered with
Tne vanished things of Life.
Beneath their roof of thatch no more
I’ll listen to the tales
That Maurice told with Irish wit
Of early New South Males.
His fairies and his leprechauns,
His ghosts of murdered dead,
Mill not attend me as 1 creep
In childish fear to bed.
Nor shall the story of that wind
That laid the cabins low
In Ireland, on a haunted night,
Affright me as 1 go.
But ever when the yoke of years
More hard and heavy lies,
M hen Mecp, reluctant, will not eome
To lest my weary eyes,
To Dillon’s farm 1 turn my thought
And tread with buoyant feet.
Once more that pathway where the creek
And shining river meet.
No poppy of the Orient
In opiate distilled
Ere brought a slant-eyed devotee,
M’ith restful fancies filled,
To sounder slumber, trance more sweet,
Than that which calls and gleams
In visions dim as 1 recall
The River of my Dreams.

GENUINE BALLOON TIRES

Q
rs
Greatest f&Iue HUDSONEver O/teredf
Hudson’s consistent leadership in value is emphasized again in the
adoption of genuine balloon tires as standard equipment on all models.
Do not confuse with “semi-balloon” types. Hudson’s are genuine
balloon tires. Compare the difference. Also note that Hudson has
not simply “added balloon tires.” Both running and steering gear
have been specially designed for the radical differences balloon tires
bring. The result is the easiest steering and riding Hudson ever built.
In All Ways a Finer SUPER-SIX
Note that in Hudson this costlier tire
equipment is not reflected in the price.
It merely adds another factor of con-
trast to Hudson’s advantage of low cost
among fine quality cars.
Of course, as always, Hudson’s chief
advantage is in the superiority of me-
chanical design and construction.
In speed, acceleration, hill-climbing and
endurance it holds marks that are
famous among all stock cars. Many of
its official records have never been
equalled by any car regardless of price.
In this territory, as elsewhere through-
out the world, the great number of
Hudsons you see in service is the best
proof of the value and satisfaction they
consistently render. Greater fuel and
oil mileage, exceptionally low cost for
replacement parts, and easy accessibil-
ity give the new Hudson remarkable
economy of maintenance and operation.
And the position of its builders —the
sixth largest producer of cars in the
world —assures the standard of quality
you may expect, as well as the acknowl-
edged policy of satisfaction to owners,
that stand back of the Hudson Super-Six.

“Yarrum” : A lady at Haberfield (N.S.W.)
recently adopted an orphan muscovy duckling. It
was put into a basket, but sulked and refused to take
food. Somebody advised putting a small mirror in
with it, and this made all the difference. The duck-
ling fancies it has company, and is now happy as a
big sunflower.

“Keppel”: “Tuber’s” dock (B. 18/12/’24)
is easily beaten by nut-grass. The root goes down
a tremendous distance; well-diggers when 40ft. down
have found the roots. At the end of the root are
•dozens of nuts, and the weed cannot be pulled up
bodily. It will grow through asphalt and concrete.
I.ately I’ve been trying to form a tennis court (ant
bed) and had 20 loads of good soil carted. Every-
thing was going well when nut-grass appeared. Now
it is in complete possession and spreading rapidly.
Arsenic and caustic soda, which will kill practically
any weed or grass, have had no effect. Can any Abo.
suggest a remedy ?

“Munjong”: I had an argument recently
with a friend who stated that crocodiles cannot express
themselves vocally, and backed his contention with
quotations from “Aboriginalities.” He’d have won
the argument but for the fact that I have repeatedly
heard, them make a noise—a blend of croak and
bellow —when fighting. Across the Fitzroy River
(W.A.) from where I was camped was a kind of
Manly, where dozens of the amphibia sunbaked in
The late afternoon. Occasionally two of them would
rush into the shallow water and create the noke
above mentioned. I am not certain if they were
fighting or courting; all I know is the noise could
be heard for half a mile.
* * * #
“Tauwarra”: “Bouragi’s” graveside story
(B. 20/11/’24) reminds me of a funeral at Wood-
lark Island (Papua) in the old days. Nobody on
the field possessed a prayer-book, and the warden,
whose duty it was to attend to such matters, was
absent on patrol. The diggers stood around the
open grave with heads uncovered, and the body of
their mate was laid reverently to rest to the strains
of “Good Old Jeff” rendered on the storekeepers
newly-imported gramophone.
THE OUTSIDER.
“They can say what they like, but this ’ere Bruce’s not a dinkum
Aussie. ’E ain’t one of us, I say—’c ain’t one of us!”
“AdeL”: Mud houses, some entirely con-
structed of antbeds, with thatched roofs of rushes
or cane-grass, are sometimes met in Northern Australia.
The remains of one in the Gulf country show that
it was constructed of blocks chiselled from termites’
mounds; these blocks were 6ft. x 9ft. at the
foundation, and 3ft. x 6ft. at top of walls. Eaeli
block interlocked with the next. The house was
divided by a central -wall, supporting a dome-like
roof of the same material, the outside walls closiug
in on the central support by other wedge-shaped
blocks. A smaller adjoining structure functioned as
a kitchen. In both buildings no other material than
antbeds was used. Long ago, when the owner passed
over, hundreds of birds took to nesting in the walls,
perforating galleries in them till they tumbled
into ruin.
“Gouger”: While travelling bush through
Cape York Peninsula just after the wet season, the
thick mat of tall grasses cuts the horses’ knees co
pieces. The leading noddies have to break a way
through the entanglement, with the result that on
the morning after the day before it is the Devil s
own job to get the knowing ones started, as none of
them want to be among the first three. Once started
the rest scamper after* and follow in the beaten
LOOKING AHEAD.
THE COMFORIER: “ Well, how arc 'c doin’ now? You're showin’
pretty bad.”
THE SICK ONE : “No, I’m not too good,”
THE COMFORTER : “I was just thinking as I come in it’d be an
awkward house to get a coffin out of.”
track. The narrow trodden-down path of a string
of horses through a tall-grassed plain can be seen
from the surrounding hills for miles. In about four
hours the leading horses tire and endeavor to break
through the wearisome obstruction in a series of
short leaping bounds. After a few days of this
experience without a spell I’ve known a whole team
to bunch up and refuse duty, evidently losing all
heart.
“Keppel”: I have seen a banana and paw-
paw cross, similar to the one mentioned by “Nitric”
(B. 18/12/’24), grown near Rockhampton (C.Q.).
The bananas were protruding from the paw-paw, and
had the appearance of horns. The trees were close
together, as in the instance narrated by “Nitric,
and I agree with him that it is the cross-pollination,
and not the fertilisation, that is mutual. It is cer-
tainly a very uncommon cross.
* * * *
“ Jesmond”: Molly-hawks, gulls and lizards
Oil Phillip Island (Vic.) have had quite a festive
season, thanks to the prohibition of mutton-bird
egging. In fact, they have had a surfeit, for
hundreds of eggs are left lying in the sun, addled, of
course, and quite use-
less, while the number
of shells must run into
thousands. Why Dr.
Argyle should have pro-
hibited the picking up
of eggs as well as the
“hooking” of them is
inexplicable, for eggs
that are laid outside
burrows are left there
and not taken under-
ground at all. Conse-
quently the islanders
have had the satisfac-
tion of seeing a valu-
able food wasted
through the ignorance
—it is nothing else —
,of those in high places.
The authorities claim
that very few eggs are
laid outside, but they
admit that last season
between 5000 and 6000
were picked up on one
rookery alone, so that
20,000 is a conserva-
tive estimate of the
number lost this sea-
son. If the Govern-
ment would co-operate
with the local council
—the latter is quite
willing—in planting marram grass and in
the preservation of the rookeries, there would be no
fear of the extermination of these interesting birds,
especially now that the islanders have had such a
success in their war against foxes.
* * * »
“545”: I wonder if anyone has hrd a
nearer approach to death than a man I knew, years
back, on the Longerenong plains (Vic.) ? A grass
fire was at its height, when his horse, sticking a
hoof into a rabbit burrow, pitched him. He landed
on his head, and lay senseless in the long grass
while the flames reached him, licked him all over,
burnt every vestige of clothing, ■ and passed on. His
camp was near, and his mates, who got to him
immediately the fire left, used a quarter-bag of
flour, and all spare underclothing for bandages, before
carting him to the Horsham hospital. I met him
again some half a dozen years later, and he was as
right as a trivet. His hair was more luxuriant than
before the happening. The only difference was that
in the old days he had a weather-beaten hide, which
had been changed to that of a child with an
extra-pinkish flush.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Buncliy-top has played havoc
with the banana crops of Queensland and N. S. Wales,
and Professor Goddard, who is in charge of the
investigations, has now stated that it may be easiei
to concentrate on the breeding of a resistant banana
plant than to discover the causal germ of the disease.
Even if the cause is .
found, “the chances are
against discovering a
cure” —exactly what
was suggested in The
Bulletin a year or so
ago. Queensland
might have learned
this from Fiji, which
produced a resistant
type. But the chief
Fijian trouble now is
the disease sigatoka,
which is even worse
than bunchy-top cr
Panama disease. The
extraordinary thing is
that no embargo has
been placed on the
importation of
Fijian fruit, though
Professor Goddard is
now asking the Federal
Government to adopt
such a measure. It.
is to be hoped it is
not too late. It is
further proposed to set
aside an island off the
Queensland coast (prob-
ably Peel Island) as
a quarantine station
for the purpose of cultivating bunchy-top resistant
plants. Meanwhile the curative campaign -will still
be carried on, and a glass-house for experimental
work will be erected at Tweed Heads.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Harvib” is mistaken in Ms
cure for a wound containing wood fragments. Pot-
assium permanganate will effect the cure, but not
by “eating the wood away.” It cleanses the wound
owing to its high oxidising properties, and the
healthy tissues then expel the foreign matter. On
a par with this is the expulsion of shrapnel pellets
from heads and other parts of a Digger’s anatomy
long after the wound has closed. A common experi-
ence is the working out of tooth fragments through
the gums. Incidentally, if pot. permang. ate away
the wood, as “Harvib” suggests, it would certainly
destroy the flesh also, as it too is organic material.
* * * *
“J.A.E.”: To check his Bacchanalian ten-
dencies his wife had procured some of those powders
which are advertised widely in the bush as guaran-
teed to make a. temperance advocate of the most
inveterate boozer. This physic was secretly adminis-
tered till the day when he arrived unexpectedly and
watched the missus “lacing” his tea. After some
caustic remarks he confiscated the balance of the
powders and adjourned to his favorite pub, where he
called for pints all round. Into each pint was put
a powder, and the assembly drank all together to
the cause of temperance.
“Jimmy Possum”: What about a “gun”
cutter? Can any Abo. say how that term originated?
The phrase is in common use on the canefields, a
“gun” among canecutters being the equivalent of a
“ringer” in the shearing-shed.
* * * *
“Larry Longun” : I don’t know anything
about the shrinking capacity of Westralian jarrah
(B. 4/12/’24), but if it is any worse than Banana-
land’s yellow stringybark it must be “a fair cow.”
I’ve seen dwellings built of “seasoned” yellow stringy
which when put up were without cracks, but in less
than a year a man’s hand could be passed through
the spaces between the slabs. Even when timber
from large and aged trees is used, the latter being
less prone to shrink than young wood, there is much
ventilation in a few months. Floors of stringybark
tightened up after having seasoned for several years
will also open out in time. Tallow-wood, an allied
timber, has the same fault; in fact, pretty well all
members of the stringybark family own it.
“Wonki”: If “Trevdee” (B. 11/12/’24)
wants farming records, how about this? Seventy
acres were ploughed with a ten-disc Sundercut drawn
by eight horses in four days, working between sun-
rise and sunset. It was stubble ground, 14 months
old, and the job was done in the middle of March
in the Wyalong district (N.S.W.). I drove the team.
* * * *
“Jim Domino”: A humorous incident of
the Prince of Wales’s visit to Canonbar station
(N.S.W.) was provided by a member of the staff who
was referred to by the station-hands as “the ’tec
from Scotland Yard,” and who was obviously lacking
in horsemanship. After smoko with the shearers,
H.U.H., made outside to where a group of shivering
mokes stood waiting to be ridden to the homestead,
some three-quarters of a mile distant. First the
Prince mounted, then Admiral Halsey, followed
closely by Lord Mountbatten, and so on until only
the alleged “Yard” man remained. With long-
necked spurs gleaming under a frosty sun,
he flopped into the saddle. By this time
the rest of the field were well ahead, so, no
doubt with the intention of overtaking the leaders,
the ’tec spurred his mount. One, two, three strides
did the nag take; then down went its head in delici-
ous preparation for a bucking display should more
spur be felt. Realising that something was amiss,
the “Yard” man put a genuine stranglehold on the
pommel grip, simultaneously turning his toes into
the prad’s sides. It was good tactics; he averted a
capsize.
* * * *
“Longo”: The other day I proved that
the Australian bard didn’t talk through his neck
when he wrote, in the old bush recitation, “John-
son’s Antidote,” that the big black goanna, to finish
the battle with the snake, “swallowed his opponent
whole.” My abo. boys had secured a go. and were
preparing for a variation of the salt-junk menu, when
the disembowelling process revealed a fair-sized death-
adder “swallowed whole.” I saw the go. opened and
the viper produced.
* * * *
“T.K.T.”: In this Far North “ringer”
isn't the star man among the shearers. A “ringer”
up here is a stockman —ringer being the second
and respectable word of the two which make up
the full title.
“Akran” : Some chaps take on queer pets,
but the belt must go to Tommy Addison, a market
gardener at Tumurimba, Upper Richmond (N.S.W.).
A slit in the partition between his two rooms was
the home of his pets, and he asked me to come
close and look. 1 did so, and then retreated a few
yards, for I saw the biggest pair of tiger-snakes L
had ever clapped eyes on coiled up in a nest of
straw. They started to hiss and the old chap
stroked them. “That ain’t all,” he said; “you
wait.” He whistled. Two bantam fowls flew in
and made for a pot on the floor. I thought they
were good enough as pets, but skedaddled when the
two wrigglers climbed out of their hiding-place
and lined up with the bantams for their mid-day meal.
» * * *
“Tarago”: Bill Brown’s pet parrot hail
over-gorged itself on maize and was found next
morning lying on the bottom of the cage in a state
of coma. Knowing that it was a case of kill or
cure, Bill made an incision in the bird’s crop,
scooped out the maiz;e with his finger and sewed
up the wound with cotton. Within an hour Poll
was sitting up taking a little notice' and after a
couple of days was as lively as ever.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: Seven years ago I was
onchid-hunting in the Finisterre Ranges, behind
Yaimas, on the Rei Coast of ex-German New Guinea.
We were attacked while climbing up a steep pinch
near a village, and one of my “boys” was struck
by an arrow. It entered at the back of the liit
shoulder and the point came out above the right hip.
The bows used are about Oft. long and the arrows
the same length. The tribes here have several vari-
eties of arrows, one of which is used for “dropping
shots,” being fired high in the air to descend vertically
in thick grass or scrub where enemies may be
taking cover. Frequently there may be seen on or
near the tracks close to a village a tree with a
number of arrows sticking in the trunk, about 12ft.
from the ground. By these the traveller can esti-
mate tfie feeling between the tribes. Where tne
arrows point towards the village, it is an intimation
that the inhabitants had better not venture far
afield. Where they point towards the oncoming
traveller it signifies that the road is closed. Gener-
ally this is done during some important ceremony or
occasionally as a bluff —I, for instance, once saw the
dodge tried outside a village whose men folk were
going away for several days and leaving their women
unprotected.
THE WRONG SHOP.
“ ’Ave yer got any of them pornograph
records, miss?”
“J.G.”: I’ve just been reading a letter
written to a Wallan (Vic.) woolgrower by a Mel-
bourne firm of brokers 23 years ago. They said
that the comeback wool which the grower had sent
for sale, was of very good quality, but the best price
they could get was 3d. per lb. They thought, how-
ever, that if they held it for six months they might
be able to get 3ld. To-day, the same quality is
worth over 40d.
GUM TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'The summer rains have made
The blue-gum saplings grow*
;So fast, red leaves have weighed
The tallest branches low.
They sweep the ground like willows
That the wind waves and billows.
They are like romping girls
Running against the wind
With masses of red curls
Blowing in waves behind—
Slim legs in grey silk stockings
Beneath the dark green froekings.
To-day I quite expect
To see them romp away
Before I can collect
My wits and join their play.
Nothing but mocking laughter
Will stay to me after.
TASMANIA.

The Seaside
and your Skin
Does salt water and sunshine spoil
the full enjoyment of your holi-
days by spoiling your complexion?
You can bathe all day and lie bask-
ing in the sun if you use a little
pure Mercolized Wax each night.
Mercolized Wax, gently massaged
at night before retiring, keeps the
skin of face and neck and arms so
clear and healthy that it positively
prevents the ravages of sunburn
and sea water.
The secret lies in the fact that
Mercolized Wax helps Nature to
renew the complexion every day
by imperceptibly dissolving away
the particles of the old, dried,
worn-out skin that otherwise
would choke the new perfect skin
underneath.
Get a package of Mercolized Wax at any
chemist and enjoy your holiday to the full.

The Test brought most of the best-known
back from sea and mountain-side, and thou-
sands of young men knocked off work reli-
giously each afternoon to observe the
national festival. Even housewives forgot
to be annoyed when butchers and milkmen
arrived on their round an hour or so late
if they brought the latest score. The vice-
regal Forsters, with Mrs. Pitt Rivers, were
regular attendants; nor was the State Gov-
ernor often missing, and daughter Helena
Rous was usually seated with her dad. One
day the G.-G. brought Lord Airedale, a visit-
ing peer. Flappers flapped attractively all
around, with arms fearlessly bared to the
sun from wrist to shoulder, their tanned faces
but lightly shielded by little pull-on lids.
Before the Melbourne match Lord Forster
brought English and Aussie Test players
together round the vice-regal dinner-table,
with a smoko and sing-song to follow. This
must have come as a relief to the visitors
after the torrent of jazz-parties poured on
them. The old gods of cricket assembled to
meet the new young deities. The G.-G., who
had Lord Stradbroke rs liis right-hand guest,
artfully condensed the toasts to “Cricket.”
He had quite a lot, but not too much, to say
about it, and said it very nicely. The sing-
song was further livened by a conjurer, an
old-fashioned amuser considered out of place
nowadays by a generation devoted to the
monotony of foxtrots.
The slap-dash way in which the M.C.C.
Ground was cleaned up after each day of
the Test match moved W. F. Gates, sec. of
the Town Planning Association, to bemoan the
untidiness of Victorians- —this in a lecturette
the other day. More disembowelled baiiana-
skin and unwanted paper-bag can be found in
Melbourne in a day, he declared, than in an
English, French or German city in a week.
Children copied their elders, he regretted
to note. Gates knows what he is talking
about, as, after he gave up the job of
assistant-chief inspector of State schools, he
travelled extensively abroad.
Melbourne’s foremost woman journalist,
Mrs. Serjeant-White, has been tragically
carried off by scarlet fever after barely three
days’ illness. The lady, whose delightful
personality and unfailing kindness endeared
her to all her sister penwomen, represented
her sex on the Council of the A.J.A. The
male members showed what they thought of
her work as a councillor at the annual elec-
tions when, the women’s nomination having
failed to turn up in time, they themselves
nominated her and returned her second on
the poll. Of late Mrs. White, who was the
widow of a well-known pastoralist and
daughter of the late'Canon Serjeant, of Wil-
liamstown, has been looking after the Coun-
tryman’s pages for women ; before that she
was on the Herald. Her 18-year-old daugh-
ter Helen, who helped her, was the first
Victorian girl cadet to train under the
A.J.A. system. Mrs. White wrote with a
breezy humor, and if journalism had not kept
her pen so busy might have won fame as a
story-writer.
English Society is scenting a romance in
the news lately broadcasted by the Court
Gazette that Prince Henry was packing a
valise for a week-end with the Duke and
Duchess of Buccleuch. This is the impor-
tunate young man’s fourth visit in less than
two years—quite enough to make Mayfair de-
clare that Lady Mary Scott, the eldest
daughter of the house and Henry P.’s favor-
ite dancing partner, is the end in view.
Who’d be a prince and do his wooing under
the gaze of two hemispheres! The interest
on this side lies in the fact that the Duke
is nephew to Admiral Lord Charles Scott,
who married a Melbourne girl, Ada Ryan,
sister of the medical knight Charlie.
A week-end gathering in the Whitings’
Macedon home was blown off the social
calendar on Friday when the tyre of the
big Minerva in which Harry Whiting was
driving the party exploded. All the occu-
pants thudded heavily on to the roadway
except Keith Officer, who remained pinned
under the burning car. Fortunately a neigh-
boring farmer came to the rescue, and with
some assistance from Harry Whiting, who
had one eye cut badly, was able to lift the
car high enough to save the pinioned man
from being roasted alive. Young Bill Winter-
Irving got off with two broken ribs, an in-
jured knee and several minor injuries, Betty
Moule with shock and abrasions of her face
and shoulder, and Keith Officer with a
damaged leg. All are doing well. The man
who nearly became a burnt-offering recently
returned from Nigeria to join his father’s
firm.
Thirty-three years ago the first Victorian
women doctors graduated at the Melbourne
Uni.; and Dr. Clara Stone still practises in
her Collins-street surgery. Dr. Margaret
Whyte graduated with her: and the pair had
to fight hard against the prejudices of male
medicoes. They were followed by Dr. Helen
Sexton, Dr. Lilian Alexander, Dr. Gertrude
Halley and Drs. Constance and Mary Stone
(the one a sister and the other a cousin of
the pioneer) ; then came Dr. Janet Greig
(now chief medical officer of the Education
Department) and Dr. Freda Gamble, who
married Dr. Buchanan. Over Drs. Greig and
Gamble, whose names appeared high in the
honors list, a battle with the male opponents
raged in 1896, and out of the carnage emerged
triumphant the right of women to be resident
m.o.’s at the Melbourne Hospital. Women
doctors are everywhere in the city to-day,
and one hospital, the Queen Victoria, is
entirely staffed by them.
The W. J. T. Clarkes have been living
in a welter of farewell frivols showered on
only son Trevor. After a year's polishing at
Cambridge, he is going to the Western Dis-
trict to learn how wool grows before taking
over the reins of the family sheep acreage,
Mount Schank, in S. Australia. Sister
Wilma sheltered her farewell jazz in Car-
lyon’s ballroom the other night, following
a dinner for a crowd of the best-known flap-
pers and dancing-men. Another series of
good-bye parties, of a less frivolous type,
is now cheering the eldest Clarke daughter
and her husband, Colonel Eric Harrison, on
their English trip. The Colonel, who is
attached to the Gunners, has been granted a
year’s leave.
Sid Long, who is still “an Australian
artist” in spite of long absence, is on a visit
to his native land. The impressionism of
Long’s style”roused a hot controversy about
25 years ago, when the young man was
darkly suspected of revolutionary tendencies.
He has progressed such a distance since that
he is often called Sidney nowadays. At the
moment he is mostly complaining about the
tariff law, which says that Australian artists
who have stayed away more than seven yeai’s
shall pay duty on the goods they send back
to their deserted country; but there are whis-
pers of a show of Australian-artists-abroad
pictures under his management in the future.
News of a brace of prospective matri-
monial announcements has been broadcasted
from two different branches of the squatting
Russell clan. The first comes from England,
where Joyce Russell, who is there with her
mother and stepfather, the George Black-
wood pair, has promised to make a wedding
date with the Edward Yenckens’ elder son,
Arthur. The young man has been buttering
bis crust in the diplomatic service since
shedding khaki. The youthful bride-to-be
is an heiress and a good-looker, who got
her educational trimmings in England. The
second announcement has been sounded by
popular woolgrower Philip Russell, of Carn-
gliam, who has persuaded the medical Her-
man Lawrences’ elder daughter, Beryl, to
make him happy soon. The golden-haired
damsel is already connected with the wool-
ocracy on her father’s side by way of the
Dennises. Her mother was an Aitken.
The intelligent face which looks at you out
of this Broothorn-made photo belongs to
Marjorie Pether, the Westralian girl who,
as previously chronicled in this Letter, rode
into Melbourne
on her fine old
’cello the other
day to try her
fortune in the
wider sphere.
She scraped
her first bow
in the public
ear with the
St. Kilda Pier-
rots ; and if
Michael Che.r-
niavsky is a
true prophet,
she will one
day make her
home town
very proud of
her. From the
Pierrots to a
London concert
platform is a
big jump, but
the little Perth
girl is quite strong enough to clear the dis-
tance.
An average of 238,000 persons pass
through Flinders-street Railway Station bar-
riers every day. At peak hours passengers
are squashed together in the Tait carriages
to the point of immodesty; and delicate
chiffonery gets the bloom rubbed well off.
The late Thomas Bent always showed a
kindly thought for the weakei? sex. It was
he who had seats on every station branded
“Women Only.” Nowadays they are the
exclusive property of smokers. If Tom could
come to life again he would blaze with fury
to see nearly every man passing through the
barriers puffing pipe or cigarette with a care-
less disregard for feminine susceptibilities;
yet the sex is counted bold if it strays into
the compartments kept sacred to the smoker.
Without the ’buses nearly half suburbia
would not be able to get home in time for
its evening stew.

heaved up above the not too far-off horizon.
Broothorn made the picture.
Architect Rodney Alsop, who had been ill
for some time, has steamed off by the Orama
under the wing of his devoted little wife
to try the tonic effects of European travel.
On Sunday afternoon Mrs. Alsop’s father
and stepmother, the Nicholas Lockyers, beck-
oned friends into their Toorak parlors to
cheer the pair. The Ernest Poolmans and
the Andrew Gillespies, voyagers by the same
boat, were there to share in the an revoir
wishes. Amongst others there were the Robert.
Garrans, the Bernard Halls, the Daryll
Lindsays and Rodney Alsop’s artist sister,
Edith.
The “Good Morning. Dearie,” company
has ordered in a ton of confetti to be un-
loaded on Bessie Blackwell and Jack Dunne,
two popular members of the troupe, when
they make their bolt from the church door
at St. Peter’s this week. Assistant stage-
manager Norman Lane will lead up the
bride, Dan Reddan has undertaken to look
after the ’groom, and Josie Melville, Thelma
Burness, Ivy Bell and Dot McCormack will
be attendant maids. The pair are Sydney-
siders. Jack has been in a whole series of
LO W. musical shows, and put up a record
in “Sally” by playing every male role one
time or another during its 12 months’ run.
An overseas coo-ee tells of the passing of
Mrs. Charles Bright at the ripe age of 84.
The dead lady, who was a Manners-Sutton,
daughter of a one-time Governor, Viscount
Canterbury, married here during her father’s
term of office—in 1868. The bridegroom was
a brother of the late silver-haired Reggie
Bright. A nephew, Alfred, now represents
the family in this city, earning his crust with
the old family shipping firm of Gibbs, Bright.
A bride-elect was showing her trousseau
and wedding presents to a group of friends.
They passed from the bridal gown to the
undies, the table linen to the crystal. “I ain
having a Georgian living-room and a Queen
Anne bedroom,” she told them as she folded
away the last tissue-paper parcel. “I hope
you are not having a Henry VIII. husband,”
murmured the feline of the party.
Jean Sutherland, who holds the 1923
travelling scholarship of the National
Gallery, left, under the wing of her aunt
Jean, who first taught her how to mix
paints, by the Orvieto, to see how the old
world deals with problems of perspective
and atmosphere. Bernard Hall offered her
his views on U forms and diagonals for five
years at the National Gallery, and now Jean
is capable of giving a good account of her-
self. Marion Jones, of Bendigo, a former
holder, is firmly established in her own studio
in Chelsea.
Under the title of the Australian Scottish
Ladies’ World-tour Pipe Band, 20 kilties (in-
cluding two chaperons) left the other day to
pipe themselves round the world for the
next 16 or 18 months. They will show what
they can do in the Ma State and Queensland
before leaving for M.L. Of course, the Land
of Haggis is the Mecca of their pilgrimage.
Chief Justice Irvine and his wife landed
back from Europe in time to say “Bless you,
my children.” to Bill, their good-looking son,
and Dora Wood, elder daughter of the Ellis
Woods, of Malvern. Young Bill is follow-
ing in the legal footsteps of his dad. His
mother was a Ballarat Wanliss.
Jim Purves and his wife have been nurs-
ing their only son, Bill, who struggled back
to convalescence for the New Year. Young
Bill, who carried off a sheaf of laurels at
Geelong Grammar, is now at the ’Varsity
qualifying to follow the legal track blazed
for him by his dad and late grandad, Purves,
K.C. Mrs. Purves is farewelling her sisters,
Mrs. Rolls, of Westralia, and Florrie Green,
who are preparing to spend a year or so
across-seas, doing what our grandmothers
knew as the grand tour.
Two world-wanderers, returning to Papua,
have made the interesting discovery that
Brown Brother of those parts is the world’s
champion waiter. He never listens to table
conversations; he is never mistaken for a
giiest; he doesn’t care if the lady is not your
wife; and, above all, he never expects a tip.
Who lias forgotten Amy Slierwin —the Tas-
manian Nightingale? Sue has been enter-
taining old Australian friends at her London
flat. They found the old-time dazzling and
abundant auburn tresses snow-white—and
shingled! But time has not shorn Amy of
the magnetism of old days. Her reputation
as the wittiest of all Australian singers and
the most polished and easiest of hostesses
remains unimpaired. Her daughter, Jean-
ette, god-child of Paderewski, is married and
settled in America.
The newest in London is “Which is the
Prince’s favorite month?” June, of course—
it happens to be the name of the attractive
little dancer in “Tonio,” at the Shaftesbury.
A jeweller lias produced the “June” bangle,
and the thistledown lady wears one of the
brand, holding a precious diamond, said to
have been handed to her by royalty.
The Sam McCaugheys spread jazz and
jollity for the English cricketers in Carlyon’s
ballroom. Amongst the guests was Miss
Lowry, of Maoriland, who is booked for a
life partnership with Test-player Percy
Chapman.
St. Paul’s Completion Fund has been
weighted with £17,000 through the legacy of a
good churchman, the late Mr. Metcalf. About
£40,000 is now in hand, and a start on the
steeple and towers will soon be made. When
the whole design is complete St. Paul’s will
be one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical
architecture in the Commonwealth.
Dr. Alexander Marshall, who lately re-
tired from the pulpit of the Collins-street
Kirk, won’t need to worry about bread and
butter. His retiring allowance has been
fixed at £4OO a year.
Adelaide notes :
In January this village is about as festive as a
family vault, but those of us who aren’t in Mel-
bourne recovering from Test cricket, or at the sea-
side trying to keep warm, are doing our best with
polo and racing. For the latter, at Morphettville,
there was a biggish muster of smart femininity.
Mayoress Glover—who has been chosen, with her
husband and Miss Eva Waite, to fill a gap on the
Children’s Hospital Hoard—was in navy with embroid-
eries of gold and henna, and another frock of that
smart color had a band of old-gold embroidery about
its skirt and gold tissue on a deftly modelled hat.
So far as frocking went, ’twas a definitely summer
meeting till towards the last race. Then furs
and wraps were thankfully unearthed from the
depths of motors, and lovely woman was back in
the spring that has pursued her all this wonderful
summer.
Clare is extra busy putting a polish on itself for
its junketings at the end of the month, and on
Saturday half the district turned up to cast a
critical eye on players’ form, and drink tea after-
wards with the wife of the Polo president, Mrs.
E. W. Hawker.
The British Labor Party has a new supporter in
Margaret Darnley Naylor, daughter of the Professor,
who went from here to work with the Save the
Children’s Fund. She is also helping to save the
world with the League of Nations conferences —
she was the South Australian Branch’s secretary—
and is one of the committee of the International
Women’s Suffrage Alliance. So far she has no plans
for coming back to this side.
The Art oallery has a new picture, a study of an
Interior, by H. S. Tuke, the gift of the Governor.
R. C. Bald, a youthful Uni. lecturer in English,
whom Adelaide took over after he had worked 12
months at Perth, is now on his way to Cambridge to
do a course there before putting in some time if
possible in a Continental seminary, paying his own
way, of course, out of his ill-gotten gains as a prof.
He set out to be a lawhound, but has already
achieved such success in the academical world that
he is probably condemned for life to a University
career. In his school days he was editor of the
Scotch Collegian (Melb.), which is about the best
thing in schoolboy journalism in Australia.
S. Government hears from Edward Lucas, its
Agent-General in London, that Spahlinger of Geneva
has a lot of Australians still coming to him for
T.B. treatment. Dr. Wyllie, who was on the staff
of Governor Weigall in Adelaide, has been appointed
an honorary Commissioner to look into things at
Geneva. He reports that patients arrive in a hope-
lessly advanced stage of disease; one of the six
Australians who arrived during his own visit died
the same night. Lucas wants it widely known in
Australia that ‘‘it is folly for pei’sons suffering
from the disease to go to Geneva on the off-chance” :
in fact, he doubts whether any vaccine will be avail-
able in the near future.

GLOVES
The evening crush on the Drama brought
Sydney to Woolloomooloo. Not the Sydney
that marched through those gates to the
troopships in the cheerless dawns of the war
years, but a softly riding, well-dressed throng
to whom a luxurious passage to Europe is
all in the year’s stride. The Orient Co. had sent
out 100() cards for the party, and apparently
1600 guests had turned up to walk the wide,
shallow staircases that connect the decks and
take jaunts from the top deck to below P'lim-
soll in the electric lift. The leviathan is a
floating palace, all French-grey woodwork,
silver-plated fittings, gay—almost reckless-
looking—chintzes and tropical cane chairs
unmoored about the music-room and saloons;
and everywhere grand pianos and lifts and
radiators suavely hint at comfort. Private
suites in miraculously polished maple, walnut
or rosewood, and fitted with low wooden beds
—just like the beds in the Pogany illustra-
tions of the Three Bears —can be had for a
few hundred extra drachmas. The Jimmy
Burnses have annexed one of these; but the
most luxurious has been reserved for Mona
Daly Godhard and her husband, while the
horse-racing Corteens have secured the next
best.
Cyclamen lights that were positively pas-
sionate pints a romantic moon filtered the
light through to a top deck as big as an
English county; and here the thousand-odd
visitors (some of them more odd than others)
revolved to a tornado of jazz ; and ladies who
hid their years in transformations and
gentlemen who hold the winter of their days
in cheque revolved each with the other’s
nieces and nephews and called the night fair.
But the pride of the ship is the. mile or so
of lounge on the third deck. It is all plate-
glass, French-grey wood and silver fittings.
There are candles in sconces clamped to the
panelled walls, and the place is a nest of
sloth-indulging couches and chairs. Sooner
or later, as the night went, everybody perched
here, if only for the same space as the dove
on Mount Ararat. As soon as the birds dis-
covered the lounge, was dry they breezed off
looking for the cocktail in which to drown
the olive branch. Here passed the captain,
squiring a party, in which Mrs. Vivers looked
like the inspiration of a Moonlight Sonata,
her frock of coral deeps with Rhinestone
coruscations. The naval Craufurd couple
were in this group, and the Keith Smiths,
the lady in a short-kilted mass of white
ninon and ostrich fronds. Pamela Watt’s
pale-gold shingle glowed above silver and
cherry froeking; the new Mrs. Godhard,
sumptuously cloaked in blue embossed velvet,
chaperoned a slim, dark stepdaughter; Mrs.
Sep Levy wrapped her legs in fur and her
shoulders in sable, and in between were
Persian-red brocades. Judge Rolin’s wife
was one of the night’s beauties, and the
Waley lady was one of the rare wearers of
black. Magnate of the Shire Line Gordon
brought a small, blue-clad wife. A Titian-
haired Tait girleen came with E. J.; the
Lloyd .Tones and James Burns and medical
McKelvey couples were in the melee; the
youthful Mrs. Edmund Playfair turned on
primrose moires; Suttors. Dowdells, Pitts
and Hugheses seemed to be on every side;
and a visiting rajah of the Orient line, Sir
John Beale, tall, suave and impressive, was
all things to all men.
One beautiful dress that floated like a
dream through the evening was of periwinkle-
blue georgette, of straight knife-pleats,
girdled mediaeval-wise in silver, the drape
which floated from its shoulders having a
lining as nebulous and tenderly silver as that
of the proverbial cloud.
Each of the seasons has its marriage
market. Spring summer, autumn, winter
—wherever the goldfish swim Dame Society
plays her girlhood. Penny plain and tup-
penny colored, the lasses float untiringly
from ballroom to winter sports, from polo to
Randwick, from Test match to picnic races.
So Tirranna on its opening day drew its
hundreds of well-dressed women and girls,
though it was far from being the record
attendance the local papers claimed. There
were not nearly so many cars on the grounds
as last year, and if the value of those pre-
sent really reached over £150,000, as assessed
by one scribe, there must have been more
Rolls Royces among them than met the eye
of the oldest inhabitant. The day before’s
weather had kept the sleeveless sex guessing,
and the meeting started off in a cool breeze
under a cloudy sky ; but later the sun, striking
from the edges of thundery-looking clouds,
made many of the peeled sex long for some
cold cream.
The froeking was top hole, the racing
was good, and the “Cup” provided an
exciting finish. The success of Colonel Rut-
ledge’s Ceo, which ran second to Mrs. Tony
Hordern’s Amberise for last year’s prize, was
very popular, and “Tom” received congratu-
lations with that beaming smile for which he
is famous. Everyone was sorry that Presi-
dent Lucian Faithfull was absent owing to
illness and a recent death in the family. His
daughter Valerie, emerging radiant from sub-
dued grey froeking and shady black millinery,
was the only representative of the family
present. Mrs. Leo Watson, of Wollogorang,
newly returned from Europe, smote the eye
and the imagination in an Oriental scarf;
Mr. A. A. Dalglish divided his attention be-
tween his new duties in the judge’s box and
his new bride (she’s a daughter of the late
Monty Arnold), who, when not admiringly
walking beside her husband, sat with her
popular aunt, Miss De Lauret. Her super-
stition-defying parasol, lined with peacocks’
feathers, attracted as much attention as her
frock, which was of cinnamon, heavy with
braiding of the same toothsome shade. Mrs.
Maple-Brown was gay and hospitable under
her new shingle; and the fact that her horse
failed to run up to expectations took nothing
from the warmth of her smile. The Tony
Horderns and a bright group refreshed them-
selves between races in the shade of their
two Rolls Royces.
Mrs. Rutledge, mother of the well-liked
Colonel, who presented the trophies, had the
pleasure of handing the cup to her son. Now
the Colonel will be able to place his first
Cup beside the two carried off by his grand-
father in the old days. F. S. B. Falkiner
brought home an armful of trophies for
daughter Enid. The Pat Osborne, Jim
Gordon, Maple-Brown and Tony Hordern
matrons were others who took away earnests
of the gees’ struggle for place.
Local wool kings entertained their friends
in the time-honored gunyas—Burrungunoo-
long, Inveralochy, Ivippilaw, Brcewon, Gun-
dowunga, Wyanella. The Cripps Clark
couple entertained an outsize party that in-
cluded the tall Osborne England couple—she
very correct in grey tailorings—the Misses
Ryrie and the gallant Captain Gilbert
Nobbs. There were Gordons and Dangars,
Osbornes, Dudley Gibsons, Allens and Chis-
holms coming and going throughout the two
days, whose hours were thick with beauti-
fully frocked girls as the honeycomb with
bees. The first evening the usual monster
dance was staged in the skating-rink; the
gate-money goes to the district hospital. The
second day’s meeting was rounded off with
a ball given by the Tirranna Racing Club.
This is a Bernice Agar picture of Mrs.
A. R. Maple-Brown, of Gundary Plains,
Goulburn. Her horse Tullyrush was a great
favorite dur-
ing the Tir-
ranna meet-
ing. It failed
to run up to
c x p e c tations
the first day,
but on the
next it ran
second in the
In ve r alochy

Maple-Brown,
whose hospi-
tality is a pro-
verb in the
district, is
one of a small
group o t
women who
ran their own
gees at Tir-
ranna. Enid
Falkiner, Mrs.
Tony Hordern
and the Jim Gordon and Pat Osborne
matrons arc others.
The girl in the flat opposite says that man
is the vain and woman the ask-in-vain sex.
This was pretty well demonstrated over the
country tennis on Saturday at the White
City courts. Man, fair and flannelled,
bounded with the resiliency of rubber and
the grace of the jaguar on all the courts
within eye-reach of the club balconies and
the terraced green where the onlookers con-
gregate, and the maid and matron from Bar-
ra ba and Wyalong were pushed to the courts
beyond human ken, where the most adven-
turous Lenglen leg-swing was cramped by
the howling wilderness of the new grandstand
where no man goeth, and the wind bloweth
as it listeth between the open spaces below
each seat, and the domestic odor from the
horses stabled in the basement leave the visi-
tor incensed indeed! Anyway, the visiting
girls at the nets are proving strong of arm
and fleet of foot, judging by the records put
up by Mrs. Martin and Miss Blackhall.
Backs of necks crimson as a sunset were
worn during the week, and the wonderful
eye that Australia seems to breed—at once
starry and velvety—glowed above sun- and
wind-flushed cheeks. Not all the world is
shingled. Small country girls, in town to
watch big sister or brother, carried regular
Mary Bickford crops of curls, or the Gret-
chen pigtails of former days, a beribboned
plait over each shoulder. The White City
will find any country girl or boy tennis-
enthusiast until the 17th.

A daughter of Bill Dailey by his first wife
(she was the good-looking Miss Fattorini)
was married the other day in St. James’s.
Her name is Yolande, and she’s a berry-
brown lass who just about lived in the surf
at Manly—it is said of her that she wore
out more bathing-suits than frocks. Her
newly-acquired husband is Gordon Taylor,
youngest son of merchant Pat Taylor, who
died last year. Gordon, who has inherited
a fair income, spends most of his days yacht-
ing, and short of a Boyal Mail liner the
bride knows how to run every shape of boat.
The honeymoon is being spent nosing about
the Ilawkesbury on a motor-launch. A
brother of Gordon’s, Don Taylor, was for a
time secretary of the Royal Yacht Club at
Ivirribilli, and next month he goes across to
Tasmania to sail the Governor-General’s
yacht in the Apple Island’s yearly big re-
gatta.
Australia’s champion sprinter, “Slip”
Carr, laid his freshly-plucked Olympic laurels
at the feet of May Queenie Tyson, of Wall-
roonga, formerly of Hay, on Saturday night
at St. Andrew’s. The wedding was a family
affair, but the bridal finery might have
graced a Royal knot-tying. Ivory georgette
glistening with diamente and soft with
ostrich feather was worn under the charm
of Limerick lace. Four bridesmaids, a rain-
bow of color in flame, pink, blue and grey
softness, floated up the aisle on the arms of
four stalwart ’groomsmen. Bride’s mother
hostessed a family reception at the Went-
worth. The bride is one of the many in-
heritors of the Tyson millions.
Kenneth Burrow, assistant librarian at
the Uni., went to Mudgce on Saturday to
link up in wedlock with Kathleen Graham,
Avhose dan has been in that district since the
beginning of things. Kenneth is of Bathurst,
and Kathleen has a job as Priestess of Physi-
cal Culture at North Sydney Girls’ High
School.
St. Clement’s, at Mosman, was chosen
by Olga Campbell for her wedding with Wil-
liam Hatherell, eldest son of the medical
Hatherells, of Mittagong. The silver tissue
bridal dress and a cascade of wdiite tulle
were the forerunners of a long sinuous trail
of white tulle, weighted with one lonesome
prize-size silver rose. Nea Pike and V.
Hatherell ’maided in hydrangea blue and
silver lace. Bride’s mother hostessed a large
reception later on at Whangaroa, the E. D.
Pike home at Bradley’s Head.
The two daughters of Justice Harvey face
matrimony early in this new year. Horace
Dalziel, of Borneo, has placed his diamond
seal on Helen; while Janet, who has been
bridesmaid so often that she hadn’t a hope of
escaping, has given her promise to .Jim
Litchfield, son of Arthur Litchfield, of
Cooma. .Tim has just returned from Eng-
land.
Camille Mary, the elder of the F. W. Tiet-
yens’ olive branches, of Albury, and Harold
Patrick Bowler, of Wingidgeon, Jerilderie,
have just announced their engagement.
One of the best-beloved of the teaching
profession died at her home at Edgecliff last
week after a long illness. She was Mrs.
Macintosh, who, with Miss Bailey, had
ruled so wisely and so kindly for many years
at Ascham, Darling Point. Before marriage
—her husband was killed in the war—she
was Annie Cornwall, a daughter of a well-
known Bananaland family.
Kate Rooney is brightening Sydney with
a gem of a smile and a truly wonderful
brooch. It is nearly the size of a soup-plate,
is in beautiful soft gold, and is a replica of
the brooch worn by Brian Boru when he and
the Red Branch Knights held court at Tara.
The original, which, strangely enough, was
picked up only 60 years ago in the sand by
Tara’s halls, is in Trinity College; and the
one Kate wears was made for her and pre-
sented by the Mayor of Dublin to com-
memorate the first occasion on which an
Australian artist sang in the Irish capital.
One of the first calls the old St. Vincent’s
girl made in Sydney was on the Garcia
School; and part of her holiday will be spent
at Dubbo, her birthplace. Farmer’s Broad-
casting has engaged her to sing through
space for a fee of one hundred guineas, and
this cheque the generous artist is passing on
to the Hospice for the Dying. Only six
months can the Australian spend witli us,
because, not being an American citizen, she
must return to the Land of Liberty within
the half-year.
James M. Dunlop, managing-director of
Edwards, Dunlop and Co., was waylaid by
his staff the other day and presented with
a portrait of himself to remind him that he
had become president of the Chamber of
Commerce. The portrait was deftly done in
oils by Norman Carter, and the chief’s fellow-
directors were present to signify their
approval of the presentation.
One of the gayest Australia parties of last
week was given by Mrs. W. O’G. Hughes, of
Neutral Bay, for niece Mary Regan, who
sandwiched a week’s surfing between her tra-
vels and her Tamworth home. On the tables
“the harbinger of autumn,” the chrysanthe-
mum, haunted mockingly in the teeth of
Sydneysiders who have had no summer. The
hostess striped herself in black-and-white
marocain, and Mary smiled above white
French muslin embroidered in the blue of
forget-me-not. Most of tin 1 guests were old
Rose Bay school-chums of Mary’s; of these
Mary Lane Mullins, having sipped the bead-
ing of the social cup, decides there’s more;
joy in service, and has decided to take up
nursing. The Itcnwick Babies’ Hospital is
her objective.
The Sir Abe Bailey mentioned in the
cables as one of the South African hosts of
the Royal Bachelor has a Sydney connec-
tion : it is his son that the Ewan Fraser
chick is to wed. The Bailey farm at Coles-
berg will supply the tea and damper for
the heir to England’s throne, and no doubt
its owner will enliven the meal hour with
reminiscences of the Jameson Raid.

Sister Brisbane’s jottings
For his birthday on the third his Ex. had a big
party at Government House. The George Nathans,
Mrs. .-Eneas McDonnell, Mrs. Leonard Turner (who
has since left to finish the summer at Bowral), the
Glyn-Connollys, Tullys, Whittinghams, Ross Munroes,
Lyn McPhie, Penelope McCay and the Victor Bells
wished him happy returns and ate his dinner; and
for the dance afterwards came the Bruches, Irma
Dearden, Hal l’Estrange and Norah Halford, Kivas
Tully, Captain Goodwin and others.
The wedding of the week was at St. John's
Cathedral, where Canon de Witt Batty claimed
Matron Betty Davis of St. Martin’s Hospital. Arch-
gaiters Sharp tied the knot, while the organ responded
to George Sampson’s fingering. A Nuptial Eucharist
followed on the 8 o’clock ceremony, and the bolls
pealed out, while Sisters of St. Martin’s made the
tall ’groom and his pocket Venus of a bride look
like two iced cakes with rose leaves and confetti.
She wore cream georgette and lace, an old lace
veil and orange blossoms, and carried pink and
white roses. Brother-in-law Wilfred Blakey gave her
away, and the A. J. McConnells’ flapper daughter
Amy bridesmaided in white crepe de Chine. Canon
Campling was best man, and the bride’s mother
spread breakfast at the National. The honeymoon
rises over Tambourine Mountain.
The Stanley Chapmans are back with the old, old
story of how little Australia is known in the Cold
Country, where people won’t eat Australian butter
unless it is labelled Danish and won’t wear Aus-
tralian bunny unless it is marked at exorbitant prices
as skunk or coney.
Mrs. Garfield, of Behan station, gave a dinner at
Lennon’s as a farewell to sons Harold and Ken, who
leave shortly for the Cold Countries. An adjourn-
ment to the Valley Theatre finished the festive even-
ing. The Orama carried off the voyagers.
A tournament has been keeping the caddies busy at
Southport Golf Club. Grafton’s Bishop |Ashton
gave out the prizes, and many Brisbane golfers
turned up at the 19th hole —amongst them Andersens,
Bells and Petries, Mrs. Virgil Power and Mrs. Pen-
leigh Boyd.
Over 40 years’ service in Queensland railway
engineering was to the credit of C. E. Quinlan,
who passed out this week. Educated at Dublin
Trinity, bachelor of engineering and of Arts, he
joined Queensland railways in ’7B. He helped in
the construction of the Warwick-Killarney line. His
son Cecil is laying rails in the Soudan sand.
There is talk of St. Helena being handed over to
the Greater Brisbanites for a health resort. It has
one of the finest climates in the world, which its
present occupants don’t seem to appreciate as they
might. Even the H. C. of L. on the mainland and
a long swim through shark-infested waters hasn t
deterred prisoners from trjdng to escape from their
island sanatorium. There’s no pleasing some people.

Although Peithias had won at his last
two starts, evidence that he was in excellent fettle,
and had placed a fine stake to timber-man Sharp's
credit on the last day of the V.R.C. Cup meeting,
many backers at Sandown Park (Vic.) on Saturday
prefered Smoke Bomb (6 to 4) and Shanky (9 to 4)
to the imported son of Corcyra—Doagh (5 to 2) in
the Sandown Park Handicap. Possibly his apprentice
rider, J. Besanko, had
something to do with
the comparatively lib-
eral odds offered about
the importation in a
field of five, one of
which, Sonny Foy, was
a 100-to-l shot. At all
events, the youth rode
a nice race and had
Peithias a length in
front of the unfancied
Valrona and Smoke
Bomb at the end.
Shanky failed to re-
spond when pressure
was applied by Demp-
sey. Apparently he is
not much good.

Sweep-money swelled the field for the
Canterbury Park Handicap at the Sydney suburban
course of that name, but some of the starters were
in no condition to see out a strongly run mile and
three furlongs. It would have been better for
confiding punters had they been kept in their stables.
Farceur, the good-looking favorite, was done with
at a mile and a furlong. Greendale, the next in
demand, looked a winner at that stage, but through-
out the race he covered a lot more ground than was
necessary, and Eudorean (4’s), artistically handled
by little Farthing, beat him narrowly in the run
home ; Pixie Pad was third and the time was 2min.
21£sec. Eudorean, a shapely but hitherto intract-
able chestnut mare by Eudorean —Jean, is owned by
J. J. Leahy and trained by Dan Lewis, who has
had a run of luck this season. Four of the seven
winners were favorites, but MeShortodds is very
cautious at these suburban meetings, and he did
no harm. There was more money for Tingle, in
the first division of the Highweight Handicap, than
for two, perhaps three, of the successful favorites,
and Tingle refused to leave the barrier.
The W.A. Goodwood Cup, worth £lOOO all
told, went to Char (Charlemagne II. —Munara) after
an exciting finish with the Westralian-bred Ailsa
Belle and Ivilreid. In the course of a fortnight
Char had run third in the Perth Cup and second
in the Imperial Handicap, but on Saturday the
distance (10 furlongs) was reckoned too short for
him, and punters let the consistent animal run loose
at 20’s. That is to say, 20’s was his price with
MeShortodds. On the s.o. tote he returned £24
6s. for 10s., and on the place (equal-division) machine
his dividend was £5 9s. —just on 10 to 1. The
ancient Irish Comedy, second in another race, paid
£8 2s. for 10s. It’s a wonder the sensible W.A.
system isn’t adopted at Randwick.

“Chiron”: The T.A. J.C. Cup, run at
Elwick (Tas.) on Jan. 10, was won by King Diff,
a son of Sir Diff —Baronga. Sir Diff had a decent
record in Victoria before going to the Speck, where
he is doing stud duty and siring a good ’un
occasionally. King Diff beat a field of 13, all, or
nearly all, cattle from the mainland. It has become
a fashion in the Speck to buy elderly jumpers’-
flatters and the like on the continent in preference to
locally-bred stock, and the fashion is assisted by
clubs that ought to know better. There should
be more races for Tasmanian-breds instead of the
so-called Encourage Stakes that only encourage de-
terioration. Tasmania bred good horses once, and,
if suitable inducements were offered by the con-
trollers of racing, would do it again.

“Lour 1 ”: An obliging little book by the
famous “Bat” Masters, “How to Win at Racing,”
claims that the English weather must be carefully
reckoned with by the professional backer who bets
every day as a matter of course. (There is always
plenty of racing to bet on in England, but fields,
as a rule are smaller than in Australia.) In the
Spring, the proportion of favorites winning is only
33 per cent. ; by the end of May it has reached 40 ;
in August, half the favorites win. “Any bookmaker
will tell you that he would be glad to shut up his
bag during July and August”; but backers lose
again from then on, till the end of the season.
Even the Press selectors “keep ahead of the book”
only during the middle five months ; the opening and
the wind-up of the season beat them. As for the
totalisator (or parimutuel as seen in France), 25
.vcare’ steady checking of results shows that the
bookmaker lays better prices against first or second
favorites, and worse prices against anything outside
that. It is said that a. lot of Parisians always, in
wet weather, back every starter on the tote excepting
the three best favorites.

“D.M.”: A quaint characteristic of the
average racegoer is his eagerness to encounter good
omens (or what he regards as such) and his anxiety
to avoid bad ones. Years ago, one of Flemington’s
most constant patronesses was a “society” lady who
was cross-eyed. It was amusing to watch the
dodges practised by veteran punters to avoid meeting
those eyes in the passage from the railway to the
betting-ring. Some would sneak round at the back
of the stand, while others kept out wide and made
along the fence by the judge’s box, always turning
their heads away from the terrace. One day a
backer with some good inside information got safely
past the hoodoo. He was booking a wager when,
happening to look up, he saw the cross-eyed one at
his elbow engaged in the same business. “Just my
luck,” he groaned and went to see the race. The
good thing won, but was disqualified because the
young gentleman on top deemed it his duty to strike
the second horse across the nose when he saw a
probability of its beating his mount.

“Machete”: News comes from Bombay of
a tote dividend which should make the mouths of
Sydney “investors” water. Five natives from Luck-
now had each a 15s. ticket on a horse belonging to
one of their number, and each received a divvy of
£4OO. Indian totes pay first past the post only,
and returns are worth troubling about. Much
of the dissatisfaction with the wretched dividends
paid in N. S. Wales would disappear if a straight-
out machine were established.

“Trovdee” : When an international cyclist
makes his first appearance on the Melbourne Exhibi-
tion track, a brass band strikes up the national
anthem of each individual’s country. If the national
ditty isn’t known, a popular air is substituted. Thus
when Faucheux (France) appeared, “The Marseillaise”
rang out; Vedrine (Belgium) was greeted with
“Madelon” ; and Bailey (Britain) with “Sons of the
Sea.” Then Bill Hedspath, a tall African negro,
walked out, and the band conductor began scratching
his head. But he soon came to earth, and hastily
rapped out instructions. The musicians raised their
instruments, took deep breaths, and let go “For He’s
a Jolly Good Fellow.”

The All Blacks invaded France last week,
and gave the pick of Gaul an awful doing: 37 points
to 8. The score was curiously close to that put up
by the men of 1905, whose tally was 38 to 8. France
met the M.L. Services side four times in 1919 and
lost all four games: 20 —3, 16 —10, 16—6 and 14 —13.
Another match is to be played before the tourists
start their homeward trek.
“Past Grammar”: “A.H.,” discussing old-time
Rugby scoring (B. l/l/’25), rightly says that in
1888, when the M.L. Native team descended on
Britain, a try counted one point and a goal
three points. Long before that, Australasian players
had raised the values. When Queensland, as the
Northern R.U., began “inter-colonial” games with
N.S.W. (that was in 1882), a try counted two points
and a goal from it three, a dropped goal counting
four and one from a mark three. This system pre-
vailed when the Maorilanders first came to Australia
in 1884 and remained until 1890 ; in that year a
try’s value was raised to three, and that of a goal
from a mark to four, while a converted goal counted
two. A year or two later the penalty goal for
infringements not adequately punished by a scrum
came in, and counted two. This ratio remained until
quite recently, when the penalty’s value was raised
to three points. When Stoddart’s team was here in
1888, Queensland and M.L. temporarily adopted the
English scoring of 1-3-4; N.S.W., however, played
her games against the visitors on the 2-3-4 basis.
It was after “Stoddy’s” return that the British Unions
increased their values, Scotland falling in last, as
usual, about 1892.
“Shrewsbury”: It is reported from Eng-
land that a first-class Soccer team has been got
together for the Australian tour which is due to
commence in W.A. on May 9. As the professionals
must be back with their clubs by September 15, the
team will have to leave Fremantle again on Aug. 3.
Maoriland has so far refused to take a share in
the venture, which is expected to cost £15,000,
though this is not final. If the team is really first-
class, Australia will get its first glimpse of real
Soccer, and will be willing to pay handsomely for
the privilege.
Sam Kahanamoku. of Hawaii, made the
pick of Australian sprint swimmers look second-
raters in the N.S.W. 100yds. championship at the
Domain (Sydney) baths on Saturday. He began
slowly, but caught the opposition at 75 yards, and
was grinning broadly at the board when F. Doyle
arrived a couple of seconds after him, with F.
Carberry third. The winner’s time (55 3-ssec.) was
1 4-ssec. slower than his brother Duke’s Australian
record made 10 years ago. Doubtless the absence
of the Olympic representatives, Henry and Charlton,
made the exercise more comfortable for Sam, who has
a nice, clean action, but going by the watch neither
could have defeated him. Frank Doyle, who was N.S.W.
junior champion last season, now takes the senior
title, for which only Australians are eligible. Copple-
son, the previous
holder, swam disap-
pointingly. In the
880yds. race, Moss
Christie gave none of
the others a hope; he
led almost from the
plunge to win by 40
yards from Owen Grif-
fiths and A. Taylor.
Of Westralia. Christie's
time (llmin. 38sec.)
was 2 2-ssec. faster
than Frank Beaure-
paire’s last year, but
a long way behind
Charlton’s world’s and
Australian figures of
lOmin. 51 4-ssec. Two
other titles changed
hands: W. McDonald
(Newcastle) won the
100yds. country cham-
pionship in 60 l-ssec.,
and C. Wilson (Bondi)
took the 220yds. junior
in 2min. 44 2-ssec.

Assuming that Ern Waddy is only BG,
as he says, although Ernest was boxing years before
the war, he gave Blackie Miller, the naval pug.,
15 years, 171 b., sin. in height, and a beating at
Adelaide on Monday night. Miller was on his feet
at the end of the twentieth round, but he never
once looked like depriving Waddy of his crown,
or whatever it is that champions affect. The
elderly Lloyd is presently to essay that feat. A
Slavin or Goddard would whip Lloyd, Miller and
Waddy in the same ring, but our Slavins and
Goddards are mute and inglorious nowadays. Per-
haps it is just as well.

“Schnorrer”: “Kid” Lewis, whose real
name is Gershon Mendeloff, told a more or less
unsympathetic Court that extravagance was not the
cause of his bankruptcy, and put part of the blame
upon an Australian venture. He said that he had
made £16,950 in three years out of boxing, and
only actually spent £10,060. But he lost money all
round the compass on various ventures, £lOOO going
on a proposed Australian boxing enterprise which fell
through, and £l5OO on the revue “Hullo, Sweetie,'’
which, being a very poor show, should have suc-
ceeded better than it did.
“FY7”: According to the cables, Johnny
Dundee, the Yankee featherweight who was born in
Italy and called after a Scottish nobleman, has been
received in audience by the Pope and is the first pug.
to be so honored. The surprising part of the affair
is an alleged reference by the Pope to his own love
of boxing as a youth. It is on record that Cardinal
Manning played cricket for Harrow, while Cardinal
Vaughan had a reputation as a swordsman when he
was a cornet in the Guards; but'has anyone any
record of the Pontiff’s juvenile prowess with the
gloves? s..

L. V. Gun, a youngster from Adelaide Uni.,
has good cause to remember his first inter-State
cricket match. Picked as twelfth man, and in-
cluded in the XI at the last moment, he made a
sparkling 136 n.o. in South Australia’s first innings
on the Adelaide Oval, and 36 in the second knock.
He also took two N. S. Wales wickets —those of
Gwynne, who top-scored, and Tommy Andrews —
for 38. Pritchard (101) was the other leading factor
in the home team’s first, knock, which realised 389,
and Murray and Grimmett obliged with 46 and 38
respectively. Vic Richardson failed for once (4 and
1 were his contributions) ; Arthur Richardson did
not play. Scott, the Marrickville fast bowler, got
five for 92. N. S. Wales scored 408, thanks to
Kippax (122), Gwynne (138), Andrews (38) and
Ratcliffe (37) ; and the Adelaide crowd was especi-
ally taken with the Manly batsman’s free and
. chanceless innings. Kippax was slower than usual
but always sound. Still, the visitors were fortu-
nate, inasmuch as Grimmett was unable to bowl
while they were making 300 runs; after that he
took three for 43.
* * * *
The position on the seventh morning of
the second Test match was that England, with four
wickets in hand, had 113 to get on a wicket that was
still pretty good. Sixteen thousand people thought it
worth while to see a fragment of a day’s cricket; but
that gives no idea of the manner in which the
interest held up business. Nearly all Melbourne
abandoned work to wait for the result. Actually the
end was surprisingly tame. Gregory and Mailey
seemed to lack bite when they opened the bowling;
and six came from the fast bowler’s initial over.
Gregory felt stiff from the previous day’s hard going
—in anv case he takes about three overs to wind up
—and Mailey, too, required a bit of time. After
20 runs had come quickly, the batsmen were suddenly
in trouble. One run came flukily from a Mailey
over, Gregory bowled a maiden, and then Mailey got
Sutcliffe. The Yorkshireman snicked a tricky one
into Gregory’s sure hands, and a knock memorable
for its patience was over. Still England’s chances
seemed worth a bet, with Chapman in and shaping
confidently; but Douglas was swiping at Mailey and
missing or mis-hitting time and again, just as he
did at Sydney four years ago. Presently his wicket
was rattled, and England wanted 82. with Gilligan
and Tate to go in. But Gilligan hit the first ball
he received back to Mailey, and Tate (after Chapman
had added one more run) was bowled by Gregory.
The amazing match was over. It was rather a
pitiable finish, seeing that the wicket played no
tricks and that the Englishmen, with 372 to make,
had 3 down for 211 at one stage, but these things
happen in cricket. Gilligan took the risk of changing
the order of his batting, putting Strudwick in first
wicket down and keeping Chapman in the pavilion
till seven wickets had fallen. Such experiments are
seldom ventured by Australian captains even when
the wicket is bad, and they hardly ever come off.
“Centurion”: By making two centuries in a Test
match, Sutcliffe equalled Bardsle.v’s achievement at
Kenmngton Oval in 1909 ; Bardsley’s scores were
136 and 130. Thus far the Yorkshireman has amassed
477.(59, 115, 176 and 127) in his two games against
Collins’s XI, and Australia will be lucky, if, in his
present form, he doesn’t add substantially to that
tally on the perfect Adelaide wicket. In three of'
his four innings he has fallen to Mailey, caught once
by V. Richardson and twice by Gregory. Just turned
30, Sutcliffe has been sealed to Cricket since boy-
hood; he played for Yorkshire’s Second XI when he
was 16. He served with the Yorkshire regiment in'
the war, gaining a commission, like Woolley, and for
the five seasons since the Armistice has averaged
over 41 for his county, totalling 7272 runs. He is
not at all the characteristic type of Yorkshire pro-
fessional batsman, and, though he is said to be an
imitator of Hobbs, he has one or two shots of his
own, notably his leg hitting off fast bowling, which
recalls that of the late Kenneth Hutchings.
“H. Hardupp”: The barrackers were lively when
the Englishmen began their first innings, but as
Hobbs and Sutcliffe addressed themselves doggedlv
to the making of runs, silence fell on the proceedings,
broken only by applause for some good stroke or bit
of fielding. Derisively an English supporter demancled
to know where all the loud voices had got to. “Can’t
you see,” retorted a voice from the crowd, “that the
bat has beaten the baw-1.”
“Wink”; Test cricket has become so serious a
business that the player who jokes on the field takes
the risk of being misun lerstood and becoming un-
popular. Even so good a sport as Jack Hobbs got
into bad odor with a section of Melbourne’s “outer”
through a prank he played on Gregory after the
big fellow, smothering a yorker, had broken his bat.
Two more balls w'ould bring the adjournment, so
Oldfield offered “Ivanga” his blade. As Greg, started
to trot up the pitch to swap, Hobbs, who had the
ball, went through the motions of throwing him out.
It was only gammon, of course, but the supposed
unsportsmanship was loudly resented by over-serious
persons who could not see the grin on the Surrey
veteran’s mobile phiz.
* * * *
“Hamer”: There were many cheerful citizens about
Melbourne in the evening of the day on which Aus-
tralia won the second Test match. One revellci
stood on Prince’s Bridge and, in sheer enthusiasm,
called upon the passers-by to give cheers for Mailey
and Gregory. With a dramatic gesture towards
the Yarra, he announced that if the river were
composed of beer he would give it all to them and
their cobbers. Also he opined that it was all rot
to talk about the Asiatic peril—if we had beaten
England we could beat Asia, too. We Australians,
he went on, were the greatest cricketers in the
world, and he essayed to show the best stances, with
the aid of his walking-stick, to the kindly philan-
thropist who was endeavoring to get him away. “All
right,” said the philanthropist. “You show me
when we get home. But come on, now. Where’s
your hat?” The drunk made an artistic leg glance
with his stick. “Jusht hit it oversh the bridgesh for
shix!” he gurgled proudly.
“Hambone”: Barney Oldfield, the Australian XI
’keeper, was “Bert” to his mates at the Newtown
(Sydney) public school, where, 14 or 15 years ago,
he was a lithe, well-knit lad, the school’s best runner,
cricketer and footballer. Even then Oldfield was
a fine Aunt Sally, and it was good-night to anv
juvenile opponent who dragged an unwary foot across
the crease. I like to think that the stamina which
enables the slight, dapper young man to stand up
to a day’s gruelling work behind the sticks was
founded on a lunch-hour game indulged in by a
coterie of us youngsters. It was a “hare-and-hounds”
business, in which many a pair of boots was hurried
to an early dustheap in covering miles of streets in
Newtown, Enmore and Erskineville during the mid-
day respite from schoolbooks.
* * * *
“Muggleton” : I wish the dailies in their
cricket reports w'ould revert to the old practice of
publishing, or re-publishing, the scores in full every
day, instead of merely giving the total of either
side’s first innings after the second has begun. It
would cost them a few T inches in space at the most,
and that amount surely needn’t be grudged when
whole _ feet—sometimes yards—are given over to
voluminous comment, long-winded airing of the corn-
mentor’s views and theories, recapitulation of various
smashed records and so on. The full score sheet of
a cricket match cnly too often tells its tale more
clearly than dead loads of personal impressions ; yet
it is the one thing we never get nowadays.
* * * *
“Wodgil” : Add this to L. O’Connor’s
fine achievements with the bat this season: for
Queensland v. England he let only two byes pass
him while the Englishmen were making 526 —and
they were leg-bves. On this form. O’Connor is
clearly entitled to keep wickets for Australia’s Second
XI, and I hereby suggest a three-davs match between
the Second XI and the First (say, the one that beat
the Englishmen at Sydney): locality, Brisbane; time,
after the last Test; object, unemployed Diggers’
fund. With Mayne as captain, Wallace, Hartkopf,
Ryder, Tarrant, Scott and Macartney (if available)
to bowl, Woodfull, Kippax and Pritchard to help in
the batting department, and O’Connor behind the
wickets, the Seconds would give Collins’s lot a good
go for it. In fact, I would take a shade of odds
about the Maynes.
* * * *
“Sturt” : Rifle-shooting is kept up strongly
in the Adelaide hills, especially by the German and
Danish stocks which, coming here in the ’sixties to
get away from Prussian domination, have given so
much solidity to the South Aus. character, and
which sent so many good soldiers to the war —their
names contrasting oddly with their good Aus-
tralianism. The Ambleside “kingship” went this
year to J. T. Lake. There were two unusual points
about the win. Lake is a veteran who won the
same event three times consecutively away back in
1900 to 1902 ; and in the last 11 years it had been
won only twice by sportsmen with English-sounding
names.
BALLADE OP A PLAYFUL PASTIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“English football writers are agreed that the
educational effects of the visit of the All Blacks are
likely to be most potent. Incidentally, it is added
that a good deal of roughness in Rugby is due to
the absentminded exuberance of players in exciting
moments.”
If the shrinking neophyte
Turns away his staring eyes
From the game, with visage white,
And towards the exit hies,
Grip him firmly as a vyce,
Though he murmur “quantum, suff” i
Tell him gently, as he flies,
Rugger really isn’t rough.
Possibly it may affright
Those who mark its seeming guise
When a player, in his might,
Sets his teeth and grimly shies
Adversaries to the skies;
Yet it is but cheery bluff
Germane to the exercise—-
Rugger isn’t really rough.
Referees are sharp of sight;
Should exuberance arise
To a too unseemly height,
Then the whistle’s melodies
Absentminded youths apprise
It is time to cut that stuff
And to love one’s enemies.
Really, Rugger isn’t rough.
Envoy.
' Prince, no need for dread surmise.
Youth resilient is, and tough;
And, despite the weaklings’ cries,
Rugger really isn’t rough.

It Pays to Invest in
Pioneer Leather Belting
An investment in Pioneer Leather Belting pays for itself many
times over. Provided the correct Pioneer Leather Belt has
been selected for each particular drive, and reasonable care
used in its maintenance, you can forget your belting problems
for years to come.
Could there be better evidence of the enduring quality of
Pioneer Leather Belting than the letter reproduced herewith?

Dear Sirs, _
We are returning to you one Pioneer Double Leather licit,
each 15in. and IJfUrl. wide, which we have no further use for,
as we have dismantled our Electric Light Plant and connected
up with the Municipal Council Supply.
These wei'e purchased from you about 25 years ago, and
are still in very good condition after all these years of service.
They have proved to be a very good investment to us, for apart
from their long and efficient service, they are returning to us
more than we originally paid for them.

THE “WEE MacGREGOR” PORTABLE PETROL DRAG SAW
will cut ten times as much wood as two men by hand.
Invaluable to Farmers clearing land, and can be used for other power purposes, pumping, feed cutting,
grinding, running circular saw, and other similar work.
CONSTRUCTION.—-Frame built of hardwood, the cross members
being mortised into side frames to prevent wear and keep the
working parts in rigid position. The frame is of three-point
suspension, two points on the log, one on the ground. All working
parts of this machine, including engine, are placed on the frame
in such a manner that no part extends below the bottom of the
frame, which allows the machine to be slid over logs or loaded into
waggons without danger of breaking any of these parts.
POWER. —The motor is a 4-li.p. water-cooled type, two-cycle.
B£in. bore by 4ln. stroke. Remarkably simple and easy to start.
Equipped with water-proof magneto. The engine has self-oiling
connecting rod, and crank case is cast in one piece and reamed to
standard size.
IMPORTANT.—AII parts are machined to standard size and
interchangeable.
SAW HOLDER.—The saw holder is used exclusively on our
machine, and is a real time saver, and is superior to anything yet
devised for this purpose. No time lost in fixing; simply place saw
against saw-holder, tighten saw-hook bolt, and you are ready for
operation. This feature is exclusive with the “Wee MacGregor.”
OPERATION. —The illustration shows the “Wee MacGregor” on
the log ready for operation. The saw is adaptable to any
position, and makes a true cut, no matter whether log is on a
side hill or on level ground. One man operates and moves it from
cut to cut in the log, while two men carry it anywhere.
Feed the “Wee MacGregor” with petrol,
water and oil, and it will keep up its
work hour after hour, day after day,
and never get that tired feeling.
The “Wee MacGregor” carries our guarantee, and
is manufactured in Australia.

In Melbourne’s theatrical firmament the
stars remained fixed during the last week;
but “The Truth About Blayds,” at the
King's, was to be hushed up for the last time
last night (Wednesday). Irene Vanbrugh
and Dion Boucicault have a well-earned free
leg for a couple of nights, and on Saturday
the company will produce “Trelawney of the
Wells.”
** * *
Josie Melville continues to live in the
hearts of her countrymen—and women—at
Melbourne Majesty’s, where “Good Morning,
Dearie,” is uttered nightly by the good-
looking young man who makes Ms entrance
by the window. The slight music of the
pleasing frivolity has already superseded on
the near-midnight pianos of the gayer sub-
urbs the even slighter “Rosie O’Reilly” music
which but recently held sway.
Melbourne medicoes are still able to read
their unpopularity in the cheers which ascend
to Heaven at the Theatre Royal when Anton
Ragatzy makes his sallies about the pro-
fessor’s manners and inefliciency. The suc-
cess attending the production shows that it
is not only quack medicine that lias its mar-
ket: quack playwriting has it, too.
** * *
When last she was visited “Cinderella” —
chummily addressed nowadays by the other
characters as “Cinders” —smiled upon a
packed house and said she was quite well,
thank you. Not even comedians who are
occasionally painful can keep the crowds
away.

A change in the programme at Melbourne
Athenaeum has given an excuse for revisits
to the bright show of the Hawaiian Trouba-
dours, who have every likelihood of getting-
good houses until the end of January, when
the ukulele will cease to uke about the
beauties of Waikiki and similar places.
Lawrence Power is providing melody during
the interval: and he haa violinist Bradley
to help him—a pleasant innovation for those
who remain in the theatre, which most do
now. On January 31 the adventures of that

salty old hero Cappy Ricks, who has made
Cunliffe B. Hyne familiar to many readers,
will be rendered in dramatic form by a new
company.
The “Midnight Frolics” have shuffled them-
selves into a new array of scenas, which
keep the ball of their hilarity tossing about
the stage at the Melbourne New Palace; and
although Clem Dawes is about the only one
of the company who makes any attempt to
make himself different, the new sauce gives a
fresh taste to a show which desires least of
all to be taken for cold mutton.
** * *
Melbourne Tivoli has added some “French
Musical Clowning” to the programme, and
the clowning passes because it is musical, and
the music because it is wrapped in jest.
Id. and E. Martel and Broughton and Cree-
don provide moderately amusing acts; but
it is still the Six Brown Brothers who make
the show worth while.
** * *
Alice Hollander is singing at Melbourne
Bijou ; and she owes a lot to Arthur Sand-
ford, her partner at the piano. Alice shows
a tendency not to care how she does it as
long as she gets there, but songs like “Annie
Laurie” and “The Bells of St. Mary’s”
gather the vigorous handclaps that go with
success. Jack Cannot is also on the bill;
and the man who was never reluctant in
stubbing his toe in the cause of humor is
doing very well. There is a ventriloquist,
one Walter Vernon, who is about two rungs
above the ordinary; and the Harris Family
—pa, two daughters and two sons, one of
the boys still of a smackable age—are bright
enough to see a joke by.

Melbourne gets a shadow view in advance
of the approaching visit of Guy Bates Post
in “Gold Madness,” which has taken posses-
sion of Melbourne
Majestic, with sup-
port in a film view
of “Going Up.”
The idea of put-
ting a stage en-
tertainment of the
“Going Up” sort
on the screen
seems dangerous;
but the film is \
really a vast im-
provement on the
stage version which,
as seen by this
Showman in Lon-
don, was popular
but poor. At
Hoyt’s De Luxe a
nobleman and a
chef make efforts
which succeed as
well as they de-
serve to rescue

underworld; and “A Story without a Name,”
but a very passable story, is the support.
“Betty” is in her last lap at Sydney
Majesty's. The curtain goes down on the
social relaxations and love affairs of Britain’s
old nobility to-morrow week.
At Bondi and at Coogee crowds will roam
the sands till summer’s out, and breast the
foam; but only eight more days and nights
remain to see “The Bunyip” at the Hippo-
drome.
'!* '*■
“Wildflower” pursues the spirited tenor of
its way at Sydney Royal. Fascism may be
tottering in Italy and upheaval threatening
in Spain, but the quality of the melodies and
the dances in “Wildflower” remains unim-
paired.

There’s love and hairbreadth ’scapes and mystery

William Heuglian has been holding court
at Sydney Conservatorium since the begin-
ning of the New Year. The basso is most im-
pressive in such numbers as “The March
of the Cameron Men” and “The Two Grena-
diers,” and “Loch Lomond” becomes through
the haunting richness of his voice a very
poignant thing. “The Bonnie Earl o’ Moray”
is another romance that never fails to _ stir
Mr. Heughan’s listeners. But the kilted
songbird might speed up his delivery without
grave danger of prosecution; and a little
restraint in the play of his face would give
hearers a better chance to concentrate on the
song itself. However, these are the small
faults of an art that is great. There will
be other concerts this (Thursday) evening
and on Saturday.
** * *
The individual performers at Sydney Tivoli
this week are good, but the programme is
unbalanced. Too much time is given to
turns that arrest the eye and too little to
those that tickle the ear. Oswald Williams
is an original illusionist, who does every-
thing elaborately. He is ably assisted in his
mysterious undertakings by Rae Warwick,
whose frocks are also worth seeing. Rupert
Ingalese is a juggler whose manipulation of
eggs and flaming torches is quaint and un-
canny ; and the Hadji Kader Arabs still
gambol and bounce across the stage like
spring lambs whose lives are unclouded by
the shadow of the slaughter-house.
❖ :k * ❖
Willie Lancet, Sydney Fullers’ tiny
laughmaker, is a clever child and the source
of a great deal of boisterous hilarity, but he
lacks the restrained artistry of Wee Georgia
Wood. Alex. Regan is a smart singer of
snappy songs, who would go further if he
could oil his voice. Phil Smith’s new revue,
“Just a Girl,” is tuneful and sprightly as
far as the comedians and the “Smiling Six”
ballet are concerned —the rest is dull. Don
Merle, a slick conjurer, is a benefactor <o
the thirsty—there is a bottle of beer to be
had merely for the trouble of walking on the
stage and assisting him in one of his turns.
* j|: * *
“The Clean Heart,” by A. S. M. Hutchin-
son, which occupies the Sydney Lyceum
sheet this week, is one of the finest films
screened for many a day. Percy Marmont
makes an ideal Philip Wriford, the over-
worked editor who breaks down through
worry and overwork and goes wandering
about tlie countryside with Puddlcbox, a
tramp whose genial philosophy is largely
instrumental in restoring Wriford to sanity.
Mary Pickford, whose appearances these
days are few and far between, has taken the
place of “Gerald Cranston’s Lady,” at the
Crystal Palace, and is the wayward little
spitfire daughter of a nobleman of Queen
Elizabeth’s time. “The Man Who Fights
Alone,” at the Strand, is not a Redfern
policeman engaged in one of his week-end
tussles with half a hundred larrikins, but
William Farnum in a battle against inherited
vices. “The Mask of Lopez,” at the Empress,
is sensational and stirring, and the Lyric
claims that “Darwin Was Right.” and pro-
duces a trio of monkeys in leading parts to
prove it. There is not a still moment in
“Wanderer of the Wasteland,” at Hoyt’s,
which is filmed in color and contains a num-
ber of excellent views of the awe-inspiring
Death Valley, California. There seems no
possible hope of removing “The Ten Com-
mandments” from the Prince Edward.
** * *
Hot weather has been against all indoor
shows in Adelaide. Harry Weldon and
other clever people from the Royal have
moved on to Perth, but George Wallace and
Co. still do things twice a day at the Majes-
tic. The Prince of Wales’s brightened up
with a children’s pantomime, and is now re-
viving the good old Andersonian “Squatter’s
Daughter.” In the open, Humphrey Bishop
and Billy Maloney compete briskly and with
success on opposite sides of North-terrace.
The latter might profitably cut out some low-
comedy turns with dialogue of the “I beg
your pudden” type, the slap-stick and the
explosion finale, which one had supposed
extinct. In pictures, West’s, Wondergraph,
York and Pav. are interesting, but not dis-
tinguished.
“A.P.”: The present Boucicault season at
Melbourne King’s, with its one play running
for several weeks, bringd to mind a visit to
Adelaide Royal in the middle of ’B9. In
five weeks the Brough and Boucicault co.
put on “The Squire,” “Betsy,” “Sophia,”
“Shaughraun,” “Colleen Bawn,” “Bachelors,”
“Kerry” and “Our Boys.” A good offering,
and well done by Titheradge, Ward, Anson,
Carey and Boucicault (junior, as he was
then). The ladies were Pattie Brown. Meta
Pelham, Emma Temple and Fanny Enson;
the last-named had just arrived from
London.
“S.T.S.”: The new book by Sarah Bern-
hardt, “The Art of the Theatre,” on which
she was engaged at the time of her death,
gives a useful hint to players who forget
their parts. In the “Etrangere” of Dumas,
she went on one evening under the influence
of opium, given her by the doctors, with-
out which she could not have played at all.
The result was that in the third act, when
she should give a long recital of her misfor-
tunes, the whole thing vanished from her
memory. So she said calmly: “I sent for
you, madam, to apprise you of my reasons
for acting as I have done. But I have
thought it over, and have decided not to
tell you them to-day.” And she declares
that the audience never had any idea that
she had improved on the author.
“Curlew”: I wonder if “Wing Forward’s”
thought-reading “Professor” (B. 25/12/’24)
was our old friend Rice, who in his palmiest
days toured Central Q. as a conjuring, mes-
merising and phrenologising one-man show,
and not a bad one either. On one occasion
our crowd in a bar parlor included a squatter
—one of those strange combinations of osten-
tatious flashness and innate meanness. Rice
entered in the exercise of a profession that
had become precarious; and the squatter
hailed him with “Here, I’ll give you half a
crown if you can read my thoughts.” The
Professor took his hand, gazed intently into
his eyes, and announced: “You are thinking
this is a good chance to unload that cronk
half-dollar of yours.” It brought down the
house, for nearly everyone knew the squatter
had been stung with a snide coin the night
previously. The end of it was that Mr. Pas-
toralist had to fork out two unexceptionable
half-crowns besides shouting for the crowd.

Villains “Black Out” has met: —
“Nelbur’s” par. (B. 25/12/’24) reminds me. 1
was playing once with Jefferson Tait at King’s
Theatre, Brisbane, when Victor Fitzherbert, the vil-
lain of the co., left, and Tait had to take his place.
I was waiting to scream “off” one evening when
Tait came alongside, after a heavy scene, looking a
picture of dejection. The audience, he explained,
did not want him for a villain, and had protested by
letters to the management. “Can you tell me why
I can’t play a villain?’’ he asked. “Because they
know you as a good character actor,” I replied. Nowa-
days Tait is an arch-villain fully approved of, and his
character-acting is forgotten. The same applies to
Milroy. I once heard a feminine patrcn of the old
King’s say, when Milroy and Gwen Dorise were hero
and heroine there, “Mrs. Smith tells me Austen Mil-
roy is a good villain and is going to play the part.
I wouldn’t come near the place if he did.” Victor
Fitzherbert remains in the memory of thousands of
melo-theatregoers as the ideal stage villain. Few
know that he once played in pantomime, and ex-
tremely well, too. Fitz had the genuine sepulchral
voice of the ideal home-wrecker. Tait’s voice is that
of the villain of terror. Ronald Riley represented
the sly and cunning type. For sheer hellish devilry
Richard Bellairs gets the palm. His eyes were his
strong feature. Bid anyone ever see him steal money
from a child or poison a baby’s bottle on the
boards without wanting to say what the gallery lady
said to Oscar Asche when he was professionally mur-
dering his Lily in “Othello,” “You br-rute”?
“F.”: Spending Sunday night at 11 Rowe-
street the narrow lane that skirts the Australia
and is the home of florist-shops and one-
woman tearooms, is becoming a habit with
a section of Sydney’s literati. Duncan Mac-
dougall is the lodestar, and the haunt of the
escapees from Sabbath-evening church ser-
vices is the Playbox Society’s rooms on
the third floor. The wiry little actor-pro-
ducer generally reads plays that tackle
modern problems along the lines of advanced
thought. The revolutionary atmosphere is
lowered at intervals by the introduction of
light, impressionistic dramas with a little
Rabelaisian coloring. Readings to date in-
clude plays by Shaw, Anatole France, St.
John Ervine, Laurence Housman, Granville
Barker, Elmer K. Rice, Charles Rann Ken-
nedy and Audreyeff. After Macdougall come
tea and cake, and the assorted gathering
breaks into groups that sip and munch and
hold post-mortems. An ex-I.W.W. leader,
a well-known sculptor, an austere income-
tax official and a penny poet are some of
the more conspicuous visitors.

Largest exclusive builders of Tractors in the World.
THE HART-PARR TRACTOR
is the
lADDY OF THEM ALL!
The true test of a Tractor is not in the results it gives in a so-called “field demonstration” of

Marchagee, W.A.
18th July, 1924.
To Malloch Bros.
In answer to your inquiry for particulars
of work done by my “Hart Parr” Tractor,
15/30, purchased 21st February, 1923,
I have pleasure in stating that my Tractor
is giving perfect satisfaction, and I sin-
cerely claim that she has ploughed over
1000 acres of land, besides all belt work
and haulages on the place, and at present
is scrub rolling in heavy scrub land. To
date the Tractor has cost me 7/6 for
spares, which, no doubt, you already
know, as spare parts are not purchased
from anywhere but your firm for “Hart-
Parr” Tractors.
I highly recommend her for scrub-roll-
ing. I can roll 20 acres per day with a
7ft. 6in. roller, costing about 2/- per acre
for kerosene and lubricating oil. My costs
for ploughing in stiff gimlet and salmon
country are 3/7 per acre for kerosene,
lubricating oil and grease, including labor.
With regard to delay in work: as I have
had no breakages, I have had no stop-
pages, nor have I had occasion to call for
your expert. I have cleaned the engine
out twice, and on neither occasion have 1
obtained one ounce of carbon, and I claim
my compression is as good as the day I
purchased the Tractor.
I have ploughed with the Tractor after
sundown, and have done as much work
before midnight as the horses would do
in a full day. lam still using the original
pinions and bull gears, and these will
easily do another 500 acres of ploughing.
I do not recommend overloading a Trac-
tor in heavy, stiff ground. I find a 6-
furrow mouldboard is the most profitable
load to pull. In lighter ground, of course,
I can pull up to 1 0 furrows.

Dear Sirs,
My opinion about the Hart-Parr is that
it has proved itself absolutely satisfactory
with all work done. The Tractor worked
throughout the harvest without a hitch,
and I feel sure that it would have pulled
a 12ft. header without trouble. In my
opinion, the life of the engine will be long
with reasonable treatment.
Yours faithfully,
R. JOB.
With his Hart-Parr Mr. Job put up a
World’s Harvesting Record during last
harvest by taking off 302 bags off 30
acres with an Bft. header in one day. With
this Tractor Mr. Job took off the whole of
his harvest, 3700 bags, from 530 acres,
in a little over four weeks, during which
time the Tractor was also used for chaff-
cutting and sawing.
QUEENSLAND.
What the HART-PARR can do is
clearly stated by Mr. John Kallaris:—
I hauled 560 tons of cane on portable
rails, and find the Hart-Parr just the Trac-
tor for this job. The grades on my farm
range 1 in 12 to 1 in 9. I have let down
four loaded trucks on the 1 in 9 grade,
and have pulled as many as five loaded
trucks up the same grade. I have 83
chains of portable rails, and have trucked
out 40 trucks of cane in seven hours. 1
had four hills to climb, making eight dif-
ferent grades. The time was taken from
when I coupled on to the empties to bring
them into the paddock until I had the last
of the 40 ready for the mill loco. I had
only one man and myself on this job, and
the fuel consumption when trucking out
was eight gallons of kerosene per day. 1
have pulled 40 full trucks on the level. To
do the same work with horses it would
need two teams of three horses pulling up
the hills, and one team letting down, and
two men to each team, to do 40 trucks in
12 hours.

Extract from “Farm Implement News,”
Chicago, of the 28th August, 1924:
Tractor Works Twenty-three Years.
In the Pittsburgh-plus report farm trac-
tors were given a life of four years. There
is one on exhibition at the lowa State Fair
this week that has just been retired after
a service of twenty-three years. It might
have been continued in operation longer,
but the manufacturers wanted it returned
on account of its historical value, for it
was the third machine produced in their
plant.
The Tractor in question is a Hart-Parr,
and is now known as Old No. 3. It was
one of fifteen tractors shipped from the
Hart-Parr plant at Charles City, la., in the
Spring of 1901. It was bought by a
farmer near Charles City, one George
Mitchell, who has owned and operated it
every season since he obtained it. Last
month it was bought back by the Hart-
Parr Co.
Old No. 3, after showing off at Des
Moines this week, will be sent to the Min-
nesota Fair, to be held next week. Then
it will be shipped back to Charles City,
where it will form a portion of the Hart-
Parr historical exhibit, showing the devel-
opment of farm power.
Before buying a Tractor, Investigate the HART-PARR,
then you will buy a HART-PARR.

“Caesar’s Ghost” : I can quite believe that
Maurice Moscoviteh, playing the part of the
medicine man in “The Outsider,” should meet
people who take him seriously in that role,
and ask liis advice as to their ailments. When
I was with Binkleton’s Galaxy of Dramatic
Stars the chap who impersonated a doctor
responsible for the remarkably rapid recov-
ery of the sick heroine used regularly to score
drinks from people who drew him aside and
pumped him for free medical advice. There
was one man who sent him a grateful letter
and a cheque for £lO, asserting that the
actoi’’s advice (which was mainly about
whisky) had cured him when half a dozen
doctors liad failed. But perhaps there was
a relapse, and the patient stopped the cheque.
Anyway, it was dishonored. That, however,
merely embarrassed the confiding citizen who,
to oblige the mummer-medico, had cashed the
document.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Artist Weigall’s
death in England makes me a little reminis-
cent. At the tercentenary of the hirlli of
Shakspeare, April 25, 1864, a movement was
initiated in Melbourne to raise a statue.
Summers, the sculptor, had modelled in
plaster a figure of the poet, seated; this was
uncovered in front of the Public Library by
Barry Sullivan, the tragedian. A commit-
tee was formed to gather in funds for the
completion of the work in bronze. Barry
Sullivan and I were of the committee, and
Theyre Weigall, a young barrister, who then
held a position in the Public Service and
later became Curator of Intestate Estates,
was secretary. The committee was sitting
on a day in 1866, at Summers’s studio in
Collins-street east, when news arrived that
the secretary’s uncle had married a daughter
of the Earl of Westmoreland, and business
A FRIEND INDEED.
"Why did old Giddihoy leave Flossy in the
chorus half his fortune?”
“She once saved his life.”
“No! How was that?”
“She ignored him one time when his wife
was with him.”
was suspended while Fred Wilkinson, the
chairman (lie was Master in Equity),
plunged into a florid discourse on the old
nobility. In the end the statue scheme was
abandoned in favor of a scholarship, G. W.
Rusden’s proposal.
“Jeune Premier”: Shakspeare does spell
ruin—for the actors. One of our well-known
mummers recently figured in the cast of a
Shakspearean production in Melbourne. The
play ran 11 nights, and the mummer had
given three weeks’ rehearsal for it without
salary.
“Lud” : Sorry to have to contradict “Cen-
turion” (B. 8/l/’25), but Kipling did not
try to dramatise his novel, “The Light That
Failed” ; neither did he “make a good job” of
the stage version of his short story, "The
Man AVlio Was.” The first-named was
adapted for the boards by “George Egerton,”
a. lady who had had much experience in the
game. The latter was the work of Kinsey
Peile. Rudyard, as has recently been men-
tioned, has only once tided his hand at
dramatic writing, and then with no remark-
able success. "The Light That Failed” was
done in Australia by the late Cuyler Hast-
ings—he was the blind hero. In England
and America Forbes Robertson made it one
of a repertory of pieces. Beerbohm Tree
staged “The Man Who Was,” which, after
all, was only a curtain-raiser.
“A.H.H.”: References to Kipling’s “Light
that Failed,” which didn’t fqil as a book
but was more or less of a frost as a play
(B. 25/12/’24 and 8/l/’25), made no men-
tion of the essential difference between the
original story and the stage version. In
the story the heartless Maisie turns down
the blind artist, who then contrives to get
to the Soudan and perish gloriously, but im-
probably, in battle. According to all tradi-
tions, tlic play simply had to have a happy
ending, so Maisie was made to relent and
attach herself to the hero as life-partner in
his affliction. I saw Florence Le Clercq
play Maisie with a company that toured the
provinces in England. She was a sound
actress, but no art could make the flinty
Maisie of the book and of the early part of
the play the divinely compassionate creature
of the last act. And the little guttersnipe
girl who defaced Dick’s masterpiece in spite
was even more detestable on the stage than
in the novel.
A study in natural colors: —
A young man and a girl in a box broke out into a
quarrel. The careless brute had lost her fan. The
audience turned and glared. It was a priceless
thing—she was irreconcilable. The audience said
“Shoosht,” but she refused to be pacified. The
orchestra stopped to listen, and somebody suggested
sending for an usher. The young man distractedly
promised her anything—a new and better fan. He
stood up and pointed at the stage. The music
crashed out again and a gorgeous ballet filed on
representing the, exquisite ivory fans of China. The
girl pouted and refused them. They went off and
a ballet dressed in fans of peacocks’ feathers and
the flaming wings of tropic birds succeeded. The
girl stared at them, mollified, but still protesting.
A sequence of fan-ballets, each more gorgeous than
tne last, filed before the delighted eyes of the
audience, without quite satisfying the taste of the
capricious creature in the box. At last all the
ballets stood on the stage together in a final explosion
of dazzling splendor, and behind them, reaching from
stage to sky-cloth, slowly materialised an immense
fan, marvellously painted with nude female figures.
The house roared its rapture. I saw this in Paris
in 1920. Can any Poverty Pointer quote other
instances of live femininity utterly unadorned in
reputable playhouses ?
“Simon”: Tlie first numbers broadcast
in Queensland, which has just installed its
first radio station, were songs by Anna
Burke and Charles O’Mara, both imported to
this country with the Irish Village Co. a
couple of years ago. The distinction might
just as well have been given to a couple of
Australians.
“Caesar's Ghost”: An interesting return
to the theatrical business is that of Bill
Anderson. In years that are gone he was
so mighty in the eyes of those gods who like
gore in their theatrical fare that contem-
porary drainmers which curdled the blood
became known as Billatidersons. William
was a billposter when the ambition came to
him to become one of our Great Managers.
His first big splash was made at Sydney
Lyceum, which he engaged for a long season ;
from there he sent out touring companies
after they had played a city season. His
re-entry is at where a short season
of panto, has been succeeded by bellowdrama,
with George Cross amongst its exponents.
“Peter Pan”: “Nelbur” (B. 25/12/’24) is
unfortunate in singling out Austen Milroy
as one whom the public would not accept
in hero parts. In my experience of Milroy
he has rarely been anything else. As lead-
ing man with Nellie Bramley at Melbourne
Palace, and during long seasons in. the same
capacity in Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide,
he has rarely, if ever, played the “heavy.”
“Louden” : “Demos’s” reference to George
Dawe (B. 11/32/’24), hero in many an
Anderson blood-congealer, recalls my last
meeting with him in the Port Phillip
Club Hotel. Melbourne. His talk touched
on many things—memories of the Bland
Holt days, stars of the past, tours of the
“smalls” and lodging-house keepers he had
known. I liked best his story of a perform-
ance at Goanna Creek: the heroine ex-
claimed, “Hark. I hear footprints!” as Dawe
was about to enter for her rescue. I can
still see the broad smile on the actor’s face
as he added, “Even the tomtits in one old
cocky’s whiskers twittered.”
“Middle Blue”: Brandon Cremer, who is
producing a children’s film for E. J. Carroll,
should know how to manage the couple of
hundred infants engaged for the picture—
they are from Chrissie Royal’s dancing
studio. Cremer handled many kid-produc-
tions with C. E. King at the old King’s
Theatre, Brisbane. A good actor as well
as a good producer, he was always ready
to hop into a part if one of his people
dropped out. Gertie Cremer, who, as an
amazing child-actress, made the presentation
of “The Blue Bird” in Australia possible,
calls him Dad.
THE BLOCKADE.
DAUBER : “I notice that Camelhair has given
up landscape-painting. How is that?”
BROTHER ARTIST : “He can’t get out of his
studio to do any, old man. There’s
always a string of creditors waiting on
his doorstep.”
“Hamfat”: It is seldom that a quite
candid criticism is heard at concerts of the
sort which people attend to show that they
really are musical; but I heard one the
other night, The boring soprano had fin-
ished, and in the blur of conversation which
followed the usual polite applause, the lady
near me addressed her neighbor to the effect
that it would be “dreadful” if Madame
Squaller lost her voice. There was the
sound of a chair scraping the floor just at
the back of us. “It would be dashed dread-
ful for whoever found it,” said the man who
had risen. An awed silence fell in the little
circle round us as his boots creaked towards
the door.
"Hambone” : Just-dead Alicia Delysia was
one of the brightest stars in the gloom of
war-time London. She had a magnetic and
vivacious personality, a good voice and fas-
cinating feet that appealed to many a war-
weary Digger. Her best part was in “Car-
minetta,” which had a good run at the
Prince of Wales Theatre under the manage-
ment of unlucky Charles Cochran. “Car-
minetta,” which I don’t think has been
produced in Australia, supposedly tells the
story of Carmen’s daughter, who captivates
an Irishman betrothed to a haughty British
aristocrat. Carininetta’s ultimate selt-sacri-
fice is the piece de resistance, and Delysia’s
deliverance of a vibrant farewell song showed
the actress at her best. I saw the piece on
New Year's Night, 3918, and recall that
Delysia carried the show on her capable
French shoulders, despite the presence in the
cast of a leading French comedian, Leon
Morton.
“C. Ockney”: Connie Ediss, who started
her career as a music-hall comedienne, after-
wards going to the London Gaiety for musi-
cal-comedy parts and staying there for close
on 20 years, has lately taken on a new line.
Since she left Australia she has played in
farce and “straight” comedy in England, and
by latest news is appearing as a fairy in a
revival of Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird.” In the
same cast are Ernest Hendrie and Norman
Page, as the Dog and Cat —the same parts
these mummers played a good few years ago
on this side of the world.
“Jesmond”: The film, “Exploits of U 35,”
showing the sinking of merchant ships by
German submarines (B. 25/12/’24), was
exhibited with “The Auction of Souls” at
the Melbourne Princess’s in March, 1920. I
quite believe the thing was filmed by the
Germans, for I was acquainted with three
of the vessels pictured, and every mast and
spar were as I had known them. “The
Auction of Souls” was a gruesome record of
Turkish frightfulness, and was unique in that
the leading lady, Aurora Mardiganian, herself
an Armenian refugee, re-acted a part which
she had played in real life during two years
of living hell.
“P. Pawnticket” : A show which once em-
ployed me was helped to keep going by a queer
feud between some well-cashed Maoris. The
first I knew of the bitterness was when a
Maori stuck me up in front of the hall at
Taihape and asked whether I recollected the
visit of another member of the tribe, whom
he described, to the show at Wanganui, and
if so how many tickets he had bought. Scent-
ing money from home, I replied that Ilorari,
whom I recollected perfectly, had
taken two front seats; whereupon
Henare promptly asked for three
of the most expensive variety. He
had hardly gone in to occupy one
of them when another Maori, re-
cognisable from the description as
Ilorari, loomed from the shadows
and demanded to know how many
seats Henare,had purchased. Then
he bought four seats, and with his
three empty chairs beside him
glared in triumph at Menare. But
the latter beat him by stealing out
and buying two more seats before
the box-office closed and while the
emptiness was till
available. At Manga-
weka Ilorari arrived
first, and Henare had
to buy six seats to re-
gain the advantage;
but Henare got in
first at Iluntervillc,
and his purchase of
the whole centre row
knocked Ilorari out
in spite of a managerial offpr to let the loser
have a whole block of seats, at a discount
in order to keep the competition alive. We
left the profitable pair behind us with real
regret. Their quarrel—started, I understand,
by Horari’s boasting about his munificence
as a patron of the drama—paid us well while
it lasted.
“Philm Up”: Melbourne Argus, after
having in its academic manner praised through
a number of years most of the screen rubbish
imported from Hollywood, suddenly the other
day jumped on a film being shown in a
Bourke-street “palace”—jumped with loud
screams and both feet. The picture was no
worse than scores that have been screened
of late, but the ’cute old newsp jpor, seeing
which way the wind is blowing, seized the
occasion to show that it is ever on the. side
of the angels. The film has since been cen-
sored.
“The Deacon”: This delving among the
sob-songs of the past reminds me of that
masterpiece, “Tom and I’ll Go Too.” The
regular props, were all in order: court-room.
Judge and the childring. Pa was to get
Eveline, but Bill, being a sturdy prop., was
relegated to the old lady. When Pop was
about to collect his share of the dunnage
little Eveline came to light with something
like this:—
My ’ome shall be wiv Muther,
For I’ll nevur ’ave no other.
If I shud leeve ’er naow wot wud she do?
I luv yer, Dad, sincerely,
I luv Muther just as deerly—
Take Muther rome, an’ Tom a’ Ni’ll go to-00.
Of course, the old man did what was re-
quired of him.
“S.T.S.” : How things alter! The remark
of “Dr. Nil” (B. 27/11/’24) about the “wild
cacophony” of the band tuning up in the
presence of the audience brings back that
now extinct ceremony, which used to be very
welcome to an early-door patron as a sign
that things were really to get a move
on. It was the whole point of a joke against
the Shah of Persia on his visit to England
about 1871; asked after a performance which
tune he had liked best, he declared warmly
in favor of the very first one the band had
played.
“Lud” : Pity Arthur Huberts never visited
Australia! Arthur’s methods of singing a
comic song and pointing his dialogue would
have been a revelation to those playgoers
and vaudeville patrons who have been con-
tent through long years to accept the press-
agent’s view about imported comedy-mer-
chants who weren’t fit to black Roberts’s
boots, or carry his band-parts. The veteran
was given a benefit at the London Alhambra
in November. The vast audience that filled
the house (one of the largest in England) to
overflowing paid £2OOO for admission. An
auction sale conducted by brother-mime
George Graves, of the original black-and-
white sketches that had been reproduced on
the programme, realised £lOO. And there
was also a subscription list to be added up.
Roberts himself, “with all his old capacity
to sing and interpret a song,” obliged with
a ditty called “Good! Damned Good!” and
at the finish made a little speech beginning
with a reference to his age (73), and con-
cluding, “If anyone in 1925 should want a
juvenile lead” A great artist if ever
there was one.
THE JAZZ KING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No temple hidden in the heart of Egypt,
With treasures buried ’neatli the hungry sand,
Can point a moral like the one prophetic
Of a new temple in this modern land —
The jazz-mad king upon the throne of Chaos,
His bizarre servants bowing at the door
To blare of cymbals, while his painted subjects
Dance at his bidding on a reeling floor.
Old temples sleep with mountains gathered round
them ;
No blare of trumpet breaks their long, long rest;
Forgotten with their griefs the greatest rapture
That thrilled ' each heart and each unquiet breast.
But in the Jazz King’s temple peace has vanished,
A mighty tumult fashions all his (lays,
While tremulous above the hectic tempest
The heavens are deafened with the hymns of praise.

Vision Increased
Comfort in the Home
THE vision of Westinghouse was all-embracing. Through this
foresight, the comforts of electricity have been made available
not only in the works, in the mine and on the street but in the home
as well.
What would our forebears have thought of cooking with a fire
miles away? And yet, with a Westinghouse Electric Range, not
only is this possible, but the housewife can prepare the food, put
it in the oven and go away shopping or visiting and automatically
the heat will be turned on and off, assuring well-cooked food.
Such are the wonders attained by Westinghouse in its develop-
ment of this greatest force of nature —Electricity.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia, Westinghouse will be
pleased to hear from firms interested in acting as distributors.

“Seotchie”: “Hamer’s” pet typographical
error (B. l/l/’25) reminds me. A Mel-
bourne Scotchbyterian professor always finds
a little difficulty with the “s” ; he invariably
pronounces it “sh.” One Sabbath morning
this led to his solemnly announcing to an
amazed suburban congregation that he was
unexpectedly occupying the pulpit in conse-
quence of their own minister being “slack.”
“Stellsby”: Recently handed over to the
Bhip-breakers, the tug Hercules, which
arrived in Port Phillip from Dundee 75 years
ago to the order of Captain .James Deane,
one of the founders of the Melbourne Coal
Co., now the Melbourne Steamship Co. Lat-
terly she had been used as a water-tank in
the company’s yards at Williamstown. Cap-
tain John Williams, for 45 years connected
with Bay tugs, and now living in retirement
at the waterside suburb, served as a young
man on the Hercules.
“Nikko”: The use of two small letters in-
stead of a capital for beginning certain sur-
names (B. l/l/’25) has come under my
notice in the IT.S.A. as frequently as in Ire-
land or England. There are Yankee families
-so-spelled ffouhls, ffoulkeses and lloyds are
some of them—who hang on like grim death
to what they regard, quite mistakenly of
Course, as their certificate of ancient lineage.
'.They are a nuisance to everyone, particularly
to people with the same names who are con-
tent to open with a capital and frequently
to dispense with the superfluous second letter
ns well.
Much romance was stored in the life of
William Cunningham A T ho, on the border of
90 years, has called it a day. When the
diamond boom sounded in S’Africa he
and his brother beat the starter to
the field, and were amongst the first to
garner in the pebbles lovely woman sells
her soul for. Followed a spell amid the
heather, and then Australia called again.
Settling down on the Logan River (Q.)
where the railway will some day link up
with Kyogle (N.S.W.), he pioneered sugar
and tobacco growing, and kept stores along
the railway line. Manly (N.S.W.) has been
his evening home.
“Mephisto”: “Foreigners” or “foreign
jobs” are the name given to any order a
workman executes for himself in his em-
ployer’s time, and usually with their
materials. In some of the big foundries and
steel works there is a great deal of it. A
man in the know may have an article cast
in the moulding shop, turned in the machine
shop, and so on, until it is complete. The
difficulty is getting it past the watchman at
the gate with the goods. One man who had
fashioned a long steel rod for himself
wrapped some bagging around it, tied some
peach twigs to the end and explained that a
friend had left some fruit-tree cuttings for
him while he was at work. Another, a car-
penter, had made himself a wheelbarrow. He
solved the problem of getting it out by buy-
ing a big box from the company and wheeling
it home.
“Verri”: For yeai’s the Maoriland farmer
has complained vainly to the Government of
the high cost and inadequacy of rail trans-
port ; he was told in effect that if he didn’t
liKe it he could go without it. With the
advent of motor competition the position sud-
denly and completely changed. The motor
companies, by an active campaign of the
country, managed last season to secure the
carrying of the bulk of the wool and dairy
produce at rates much lower than the rail-
ways charge. Hence the farmer now finds
himself being petitioned by the Government
for his custom, and tempted with promises of
lower freights and a better service. The
Minister at the head of the Railway Depart-
ment, the very energetic and capable J. G.
Coates, has organised a thorough canvass of
the disgruntled districts with considerable
success. But as the grievances of the man
on the backblocks farm against the railwavs
are many and long-standing, he is unlikely to
entirely remove his custom from the motor
services that have brought the Government
to reason.
“F.L.H.”: “Arrived at Melbourne yester-
day from Hobart after a voyage of 105 days.”
Such a notice might have excited little com-
ment in shipping circles SO years ago, but
the scow Cathkit’s latest record is a bit
startling nowadays. The dirty weather that
blew her north till she fetched up, after many
tribulations, at Sydney, was surpassed by
that she met on lieading south again, and
the vessel was forced to shelter in Twofold
Bay and Sealers’ Cove for a while. The
Cathkit’s cargo consisted of 75ft. piles
stacked on deck, and these, getting slippery
with constant wetting, made the working of
the ship difficult. The tug Minah towed the
wanderer from Twofold Bay, and the job was
such a long one that it was feared she
would have to cast off owing to coal run-
ning shoi-t. If this had happened the Cathkit
miglit have hit Maoriland in time. A new
crew had the dismal job of working her
round from Sydney, and their deep-sea
vocabulary was just about exhausted when
they took leave of the poor old hooker.
A page from the Romance of Gold: — .
They began life early in those days. Just 90 years
ago a lad of 17 returned to Sydney after two years
of packed adventure that reads like romance. He
had been in search of beche-de-mer and tortoise-
shell in Torres Strait and the Malay Archipelago.
At Batavia the crew was stricken down with yellow
fever. Twenty-seven of the number went under, and
of the few survivors this lad was one. Yet he still
pined for adventure, and the mild form of it that
pastoral life offered in those days did not satisfy
his craving. Then came to Australia news of the
now Eldorado in America, and he set out for Cali-
fornia, returning two years later with some know-
ledge of prospecting for gold. Shrewd and observant,
he had made a guess at truth to be later demon-
strated. In 1851 he and a young companion, John
Lister, two fellow-adventurers and a girl of 15, named
Ann, stood -with others before the pub at Guyong.
The young men were off on a mysterious search to
test the value of the guess at truth made by their
leader, Ned Hargreaves. Not long after Ann saw
them return, and with them they brought the few
specks of gold that were to change the history of
Australia. Hargreaves went his way, but Lister
remained to claim the hand of Ann. This long-ago
romance has been linked to the present by the
survival of Ann, who reached the age of 88; and
now she, the survivor of the little group, has also
passed over and made the roll of death complete.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A’o notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Marne and address must appear on the MSS. Mo
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
G.A.L.: Hardly worth it... .A.C.H.: But,
hang it all! let the other fellow make a slip some-
times. You yourself, for instance, talk of Abbott’s
“Lieut. Wiggs,” whereas Abbott’s creation is Wicks.
....Gee See: As exhilarating as cold boiled cabbage.
.... Half Back: Too vague. When a man writes
like that we always suspect that he doesn't know
, any more than the next man about the subject....
0..T.L.: There are a few striking sentences towards
the end, but the first five pages should be put into
two at most. . . .W. Iloi: Yes, but were they the
same birds? That was the point of the other story.
. ...Dicko: It isn’t quite doggerel.... Lounge L.:
Have no recollection of it; but looks as though you
didn’t put it very enticingly if four papers turned
it down.... Pet of the Camp: But all that doesn’t
explain the origin of the word, and that’s what
all the talk was about.... Almond Blossom: Nice
enough verse, but it only says that night and day
follow one another Jonquil: Lacks interest. .. .Pair
of Specs: Makes rather a dull homily... .Una C.:
Doesn’t strike us hard enough. .. .Molly H.: “Bash-
ful Lover” can’t kiss her here... .W.H.L.: Haven’t
the faintest idea what they mean. .. .H.C.S.: There
have been many worse first attempts, but there is
not very much in them except words... .Wallace W.:
Not well enough done.... J.S.D.: It says all it has
to say in the first stanza.... Molly O.: The gentle
moral and religious commonplace is suitable for
“The. Curate’s Clarion” or “The Sunday-school
Comet”....G.E.L.: Not up by a long way... .George
D.: The sestet spoils it. It is commonplace and
bad in form.... E.R.R.: The sonnet is very poor and
the other verse very crude. Contractions like
“f’nought” and “m’brow” are impossible. .. .Belle-
rive: The song of the beloved weed is very heart-
calling :
Fragrant cigars are
For luxury in life ;
I’m well satisfied with
My tobacco and pipe;
’Tis a notorious habit
Which undoubtedly is right.
But beloved is the weed,
Dark Havelock and light.
Doctors express ’tis
Bad for the health.
So is champagne
Among sons of great wealth.
To the poor, roving tramp,
More hard is he’s life,
When out of tobacco
To fill he's clay pipe.
... .Ripponlea: Mechanical... .Madge C.: Fair verse,
but gets to nothing.. . .T.F.S.: Too crude. .. .Curlew:
Nothing “fresh” or “modern” about it: simply bad
verse of a very old pattern Arthur M.: Couldn’t
be much worse... .E.S. (Prospect): Doesn’t get any-
where near. .. .W.S. (Auckland): “Happy Days”, are
choked with commonplace, and the verse shows little
5ki11.... Vera L.: The first does not much resemble
verse; the others carry a small thought, but are
too slap-dash to be worth while. .. .H.G.8.: Far too
many humps on it. ...H.W. (Rose Bay): That “If”
idea has been worked to death; and yours is a rather
clumsy sample. . . .T.J. (Warren) : Misses, l.ut is not
unplcasing. . . .The Outcast: Sorry, but you have not
nearly enough 5ki11.... M.N. (Brisbane): A rugged
little scrap of the obvious. . . .Koala: Not well enough
done. . . .E.8.L.: Not the apples for this barrow....
W.C.E.: You ramble straight on whether you get
a rhyme or not. And it is wooden phrasing. .. .
Thomas H.: The verse is far off.... Syd S.: All
are a long way below standard.... J.M.S.D.: “Dress”
is the feeblest flutter we have seen for days....
•T.W.H.: Nothing in it. .. .H.D.A.: One is old, the
other not very thrilling. .. .G.M.M.: The yarn doesn’t
stir us.... Sandy; Mere dull, stodgy statements of
facts don’t interest us. Even the pork butcher finds
it necessary to dress his window these days....
N Mariner; If you don’t see the implication of that
“imp.” you are not so bright as you used to be.
If a man has been imported he can also be deported.
....Proto; You won’t get your ticket for the
Harpists’ Union in Paradise if you fall out of tune
so often.... J.8.T.; Rather well done; but you
don’t make it as believable as you might... .Norwood:
Run a plane over it. Or perhaps a road roller would
be better. .. .The Mussel: Much shell and little
fish... .N.S.M.; It has been done better... .Bunchv
Top: There is good stuff in it, but you’ve got it aIJ
tangled.... Old Reader: As a matter of fact, James
Edmond is still The Bulletin's principal leader-
writer. Of the 163 articles printed in the “leading”
columns last 3' ear, Mr. Edmond wrote 48; nobody
else wrote more than 28.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R. 8.; Two imperfectly stuffed examples of the
species, male and female, exchanging in vacuo per-
fectly ancient gag. Declined with thanks... .D.M.:
As above; but add one rickety settee and painful
study ,of nude, also in vacuo... .8.R.: Ditto, but
figures female; add also background of two ruled
lines indicating wa11... .E. 8.5.: You needn’t worry
about not being able to draw. If you’ve got ideas
that we like we will buy them... .5.8. K.; “A
Sandham who has been omitted for the second Test”
misses the selector again... .L.R.8.: Send your
“drunk” picture to Grit ; it’s good prohibitionist
propaganda... .A.E.E.; Three chances and out for a
duck... .M. 8.; Timid little fragment and quite
hopeless... .M.8.J.: Careful studies, but without
vigor; and the gags are frightful. ... J. Goff: Strange;
the same joke came from Werribee. ' Was it a case
of collusion or telepathy ?...'. .G.D.: Your style is
all your own; you can have the pictures back, too.
. ...J.H. and H.W.T.: Not up....L.8.: Good; but
not exactly in our line. .. .G. 8.8.; Art editors
should welcome your patent suicide machine.
“Uramao”: Archbishop Mannix’s piloting
of the Aussie pilgrims to Rome this year
reminds me that the late Cardinal Gibbons,
of Baltimore, made a visit to the Holy Father
some years before he died, and at a great
reception on his return a Protestant lady,
turning to him, said: “Eminence, do you
really believe the Pope is infallible?” “No,
madam,” Gibbons replied, “I do not. When
I took farewell bf him a couple of weeks ago
he said, ‘Addio, Cardinale Jib-bones!’ ”
.“Nitric” : The New Year was ushered in at
Murwillumbah (N.S.W.), as elsewhere, by
the customary discord of tin-cans, whistles
and bells. During the process the firebell
was very vigorously tolled, and was not un-
naturally accepted as one of the joy-makers.
But it wasn’t. The fire brigade dropped to
its message just in time to save a large
business establishment from becoming a bon-
fire.

POWERFUL
EASY-RIDING, AND
MODERATELY PRICED
It is supremely well-sprung, it is uncannily silent, it is a miser on petrol, it steers
no heavier than a wisp of cigarette smoke, it climbs like a chamois, it will crawl in
high at two miles an hour, and yet without any fuss or flurry do its modest seventy
on the level—in short, it just does anything that it should, and most things a
good deal better than you would think possible.
We invite you to enjoy behind the wheel of the new Single-Six an experience
which no words of ours can adequately portray in advance.

Essentials
to Clean Shaving
Shaving Cream must be
absolutely perfect to ensure a
good shave. Impurities blunt
the blade and the resulting
shave is poor and often painful.
SHAVING CREAM
yields a profuse creamy lather
in either cold or hot water;
it refreshes the skin and pro-
duces a delightful feeling of
spruceness and invigoration.

“Pip Tok”: The flag of the Irish Free
State (B. 11/12/’24) isn’t the only new
one in our ports. With a Greek skipper,
Italian and Greek officers, and carrying a
polyglot crowd of parti-colored immigrants,
the Amazonia steamed into Fremantle in
time to witness the discomfiture of T. Walsh.
This vessel, the property of the Egyptian
Enterprise Maritime Co., is the first to fly
the crescent with three stars of the Gyppo
Mercantile Marine in Australian waters.
* * * *
“Birre Gurra”: That good old Australian,
Daniel Jones, has returned from Manchester
with the encouraging news that the spin-
ning city is prepared to buy all the ratoon-
cotton Bananaland can produce. Samples of
ratoon-cotton submitted by Jones were valued
by the spinners at 2s. per lb., which is 4d.
in advance of American Middling. The vet-
eran is trying to pioneer another Australian
industry. Some Manchester furriers in-
quired of him as to the possibility of utilis-
ing flying-fox skins in their trade, and he
has undertaken to forward specimens so that
their commercial value may be ascertained.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: Growing tea (B. 25/12/’24)
was first tried in Australia about the time
that sugar-growing was begun in earnest at
Port Macquarie. In July, 1827, the Sydney
Gazette remarked: “Mr. Frazer, the
Colonial Botanist, is preparing a specimen
of tea grown in the Government garden, for
the inspection of his Excellency the Gover-
nor. The utmost confidence is entertained
that this important article will one day rival
that of China. The flavor of the present
specimen is of the most delicate kind.” In
the 9S years that have passed since then we
seem to have done little to justify the con-
fidence of the trusting pioneers.
* * * #
“Machete”: The alarming shortage of
whisky, especially in the West Indies and
Mexico, both suspiciously close to the afflicted
land of prohibition, and the inability of Scot-
tish distilleries to cope with it, seems to open
an avenue for Australian spirit manufac-
turers, hitherto without much open honor,
even in their own land. If Mexico has taken
such a violent fancy to whisky, why not
supply the demand? Australian whisky can
be sold at a price which would delight the
simple Mexican and leave him such a margin
of profit as woultT throw him into positive
ecstasies should he elect to sell it to a dry
neighbor.
* * * #
“Coot”: The P.M. at Melbourne City
Court dismissed a charge for driving a motor
without a license, on the ground that the
driver, being on duty for a Commonwealth
Department, didn’t need one. If this ruling
is correct, no member of any Commonwealth
Department when driving an official car need
be licensed. Even the drivers of postal vans, it
would seem, may ignore the regulations which
demand a certificate of efficiency. I don’t
know whether The captain of a Common-
wealth boat has to hold a ticket; but I
suppose not. Why should he have to if
the driver of a Commonwealth motor-car is
exempt?.
* * * *
“Notfarg”: When Joe Carruthers was
N.S.W. Premier he told the people of Mac-
lean that an acre of Clarence River water
was more valuable than a similar amount of
land. Clarence fishermen have been doing
well lately, some sensational hauls having
been made of jewfish, the larger of which
are cut up, treated and sold in Sydney re-
tail shops as blue cod or something to that
effect. The occupation is a precarious one,
howevei*, chiefly owing to uncertainty of
transport. The railway authorities might im-
prove conditions by providing insulated vans
on the North Coast line for the conveyance
of fish ; after all, the business is worth fos-
tering just as much as the production of
butter and bananas.
* * * *
“Hasen” : He was nothing if not a sales-
man, the little .Tap pedlar who boarded our
ship at Kobe. He owned all the dogged per-
sistency that wins battles and the suave
plausibility that dodges ’em. With a ready
wit went a conscience sufficiently elastic to
allow some latitude in the description of his
wares; but even he faltered a little when it
came to the strings of pearls that he offered
for two or three yen (about 3s. 6d. to 55.).
“But they’re not Ciro pearls,” baldly in-
sisted the possible customer, a ship’s officer.
It was for a moment only that the salesman
hesitated. Then he answered, with a fine air
of frankness: “No, not Ciro, sir. But they
are the genuine imitation of Ciro pearls.”
I’ve heard of life-like copies, good fakes and
so on ; but a real, lionest-to-goodness, genuine
imitation of an imitation is something new.
* * * *
“Verri” : Until a few years ago the MX.
oyster-beds were free for anyone to operate
on. A party of Greeks settled near the
great Coromandel beds in the Hauraki Gulf,
and by industrious picking managed to de-
plete them within an incredibly short time.
No oysters were sold locally, the entire crop
being shipped to Australia, where higher
prices more than made up for freight. Pro-
tests from MX. dealers caused the Govern-
ment to take over the whole industry, pick-
ing all the oyster-beds in the Dominion and
retailing from Government depots to the
public at reasonable prices—about three
dozen oysters in the shell for Is. Thus
Antonio and Co. were deprived of a profit-
able living, but not until the Coromandel
beds had been practically worked out. Ayson,
the enthusiast in charge of MX. fisheries!
calculated it would take close on 30 years
for the beds to fully recover their old pro-
ductiveness, though replanting was commenced
on a huge scale. The chief plaint of the
oyster expert is that the careless picker fails
to remove the under shell from the rock, and
as the oyster spawn cannot settle on the
smooth surface of the old shell an immense
amount of rock space is rendered useless.
The Government supervision over the oyster-
beds is strict, and the penalties for illegal
picking severe. Not even on the privately-
owned islands of MX., with one exception
may anyone pick an oyster; up to high-
water mark is Government property. The
exception is Ivawau, near Auckland the
island presented by Queen Victoria to
George Grey, which is held under English
title, where the oysters may be picked in and
out of season by any who care to take them.

for The Bulletin’s _ “Aboriginalities.
Townsville loses a good citizen.
“FY7”: Fresh testimony to the efficacy of
chalmoogra oil is afforded by the discharge
of three more lepers from Peel Island lazaret
in Moreton Bay (Q.). A long period of tests
has declared them clear of the curse, though
they must report monthly for some time to
come to their local health officer and con-
tinue their treatment with the oil.
“Pip Tok” : Re the award of the F.R.G.S.
to people who have done their pioneering in
the suburbs (B. 11/12/’24), probably the
youngest Australian to gain this distinction
was a Fort-street schoolboy, the son of an
F.R.G.S. The award was made solely on
the strength of the youngster’s winning the
Geography Medal in the Sydney Uni.
Junior.
The Northern Territory loses a valuable
civil servant in Inspector F. G. Burt, now
on long-service retiring leave. He it was
who kept law and order during Darwin’s 10-
year boom, when thugs, spielers, murderers
and urgers outnumbered the dinkum workers
and rushed to the killing ground, bringing
with them grog shanties, gambling hells, two-
up schools and etceteras, mostly female. In
these days the jobs he used to do are split up
amongst three higher-paid men and a typist
or two —all overworked.
An interesting personality who has just
gone off the pay-roll of the Education De-
partment of N. S. Wales is C. R. Smith,
M.A. This worthy pedant has served the
Department for over 40 years. He secured
his M.A. at Aberdeen, and entered the N.S.W.
service in the late ’eighties. Among his first
charges were Fort-street, Newcastle and the
Model School at Leichhardt. But his great
work was done as headmaster at Sydney
Boys’ High School, where he is to be suc-
ceeded by G. C. Saxby, who is an Old Boy of
the school.
“D.F.”: Cable messages about the disaster
at Hobart, Oklahoma (U.S.A.), remind me
of the time when I learned .that Hobart,
Tasmania, was a long way from being the
only pebble on the beach. I went into a
post-office in England and addressed a cable
to Hobart, under the impression that there
was only one in the world. “Do you mean
Ilobart, Oregon, or Hobart, Michigan?’
asked the clerk. As a matter of fact, there
are four Hobarts in U.S.A., though appa-
rently there is only the one in the British
Empire.
“Light Horse”: According to the cables
Commander Burney, the airship expert, has
struck a brilliant idea in an aero engine
which will need no oxygen, enabling a
machine to be entirely enclosed. The idea
then is to ascend to 100,000 feet, where there
is no atmosphere, and there attain such a
speed that the earth could be girdled in 24
hours, because friction would be almost non-
existent. It sounds plausible, but how is a
’plane going to travel with no air for her
propellers to bite on? If friction were abol-
ished a machine could neither go on nor stay
up, since it is essential to both processes.
“Nitric”: Queensland’s Prickly-pear Com-
mission has been on the job for four mouths,
and chairman W. L. Payne reports that 220
tons of pear poison has been sold to land-
holders. These poisons are found to be effec-
tive, and the quantity so far supplied repre-
sents 1,500,000 tons weight of pear destroyed.
It sounds a lot, but before the pest can be
even held in check several million tons of pear
plants will have to be destroyed annually.
How futile was the old method of grubbing,
stacking and burning! The Commission
meanwhile is testing biological agencies on
pear so dense that it is too costly to treat it
by other methods. So far 2500 cases of
cochineal insects have been distributed. At
least and at last something is doing.
Frank J. Dunleavy has just driven on
ahead at Los Angeles, California, where he had
been living for some years. “Dun” drove
Cobb’s coaches in the Wilcannia-Menindie
district as a young man, and then went to
the U.S., where he became naturalised. He
was an authority on co-operation, and had a
book in the press at the time of his death.
He was an expert in oil geology, and bought
much oil-land in Mexico as agent for a big
American corporation. Two years ago he
came back to N.S.W. and spent six months
on horseback searching for a bed of asphalt
he had discovered in his youth. When he
found the deposit it turned out to be com-
posed of black volcanic ash.
Prof. David (who has just stepped out of
his chair at Sydney Uni., to be followed by
one of his own “boys,” the home-grown L. A.
Cotton) is of opinion that by far the most
important potential source of oil in Aus-
tralia is coal, of which there is probably 35
thousand million tons in known deposits, and
that total might be increased to 70 thousand
million tons with improved methods of work-
ing and better ventilation. Treated by a low-
temperature carbonisation process this would
yield, at the lower figure, 69 thousand million
gallons of oil. Australia’s annual consump-
tion of liquid fuel is about 74,000,000 gallons,
so the supply at that rate would last 1000
years or more. Shales are looked to for only
a minute quantity compared with coal —
It. H. Cambage’s estimate in that direction
is 83 million gallons—and even including
probable reserves, David thinks the maximum
amount of oil from that source would be
less than 3 p.c. of the possible extraction from
coal. Regarding free mineral oil in Aus-
tralia, he 'looks upon Roma (Q.) and Kim-
berley (W.A.) areas'as possibilities, but has
more definte expectations of a large oilfield
within the 11,000 sq. miles lying within that
area of New Guinea bounded by the Sepik
River, the Dutch frontier and the coast. He
recommends a thorough survey there.

NEW EDISON
triumphs in amazing test
This is what the Perth
“ West Australian" said about it!
“Miss Stella Power, the noted
soprano, stood on the platform of
Queen’s Hall last night (December 19)
and sang to an audience manifesting
the liveliest interest and expectation.
Then her lips closed, but the voice of
Stella Power rippled on—the Tone
Test of the New Edison had been
passed triumphantly.
. . .sometimes it was possible for
an intent ear to detect a slight differ-
ence when Miss Power of the flesh and
blood momentarily ceased singing and
the “re-created” voice of the handsome
cabinet went on. . . .but the significant
fact about this just perceptible differ-
ence was that it applied entirely to
quantity.
“In quality one could detect none,
as between the sounds issuing from the
living singer and the New Edison; the
tone color of, the one voice was repro-
duced with fidelity in the other....
in Lehmann’s ‘The Cuckoo the test
went a step further. The lights were
switched off at one point for a moment,
the song continuing. When they were
switched on again, the phonograph
stood alone on the platform and Miss
Power beamed on the applauding audi-
ence from the floor of the hall. Who
could say when her ‘real’ voice ceased
to sound?”
The New Edison alone dares this test.
It is the only phonograph you really want.

Be a Rexona Girl!
Use only Rexona Soap
for Health and Beauty
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beautiful skin and hair. To be a
Rexona Girl is to use only Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural beauty of the
skin and hair which cannot he imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams a 3
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in
the treatment of skin affections is known through-
out the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap regularly
once or twice a day, and see
if it does not quickly soothe
and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples, and
leave the complexion clear,
fresh and velvety.

“How
Mates.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLD Mate, I am dreaming this end of
the day.
A south wind that ruffled the waves
on the bay
Js dropping with sundown ; long tree-shadows
grow,
\nd black swans are banding and blue herons
go.
Old Mate, I am watching the birds in their
flight
To haunt and to covert with coming of night,
White clouds being dyed with red blood of
the sun,
And dim hills recalling a day that is done.
Old Mate, I am thinking, a tear in my heart,
How love could be sorrow with true loves
apart —
The world in his wisdom or folly might sneer
To know we’ve been lovers for twenty-four
year.
Old Mate, I remembered but only this morn
The day that I greeted our mewling first-born.
My joy was as high as my pockets were
down—
X mind that I borrowed that day half a
crown.
Old Mate, I’ve remembered this sunset, me-
seems,
The morn of our mateship, the dawn of our
dreams —
Oh, sweet as the briar you were, and so
young,
Mo sweeter nor fairer by bards ever sung!
Rut ’twasf not your beauty, your youth, nor
your charm,
The blush on your cheek or the curve of your
arm ;
’Twas the wonderful woman I took as a toll
For shattered clay idols, you, body and soul.
Old Mate, I’ve been thinking. The night
has come down
With me in the busliland and you in the
town,
And life may be mournful with comrades
apart-
Old Mate, I’ve been thinking, a tear in my
heart.
The south wind has fallen, the stars are
a-shine,
The black swans have lifted in musical line ;
The forests are shaded ; far out on the reef
I hear the seas singing their pleasure or
grief.
So here I am mooning, with you far away;
The south wind that ruffled the waves on the
bay,
The dawn and the sunset, the clouds and the
blue
Are shadows of nothing, my Mate, lacking
you.
Old Mate, I am longing and longing again
To build us that castle. 4hat castle in Spain!
And ah! I am mournful; and now I confess
I’ve builded a cottage, no more and no less.
If plans have miscarried, as sometimes may
be.
Then, God is my witness, the blame is on me :
Old Mate, I am watching the birds in their
flight—
Come back, my beloved, oh come back to-
night!
* * * *
W e’ve carried Life’s swag and the black billy-
can
That oft brews ill-fortune for woman and
man;
I have ne’er heard you murmur, but, mile
after mile,
You strengthened my courage and made it
worth while.
Old Mate, I am owing you more than a song ;
I owe you a saga a thousand lines long.
I’ll kill me an eagle and pluck from its wing
The quills for that saga of you when I sing.
I’ll get me a ring-dove to flute to the stave
Of . one who was gentle, of one who was
brave:
With sun-fire and moon-beam, with laughter
and tears,
My song should be written to live through the
years.
Old Mate, I will have it an Iliad new
Of Life’s grand adventure, the Southland and
rr, you.
The new iporn has risen, the night fogs de-
part.
I m reading your letter, a song in my heart.
Old Mate, I am laughing, my heart full of
r _ glee,
To learn you are speeding the home miles to
me ;
thinking, belov&d. together again.
W e’ll look up the plans of that castle in
Spain.
/’ or somehow. I fancy, away on the shelves,
That other Old" Mates have put plans like
om-selves;
Though some folks might titter and some
folks might stare,
Twould bring us all pleasure those plans to
compare.
Mates, don’t you think, now my story’s
been writ,
There’s somewhere, or somehow, a moral in
it?
The quills of an eagle, the call of a dove—
Hie key of the riddle, I fancy, is Love.
Tye, love in the sunlight, and love in the
_ rain!
he clouds that pass over our castles in
Spain
v 'hall close not their posterns, shall bar not
-p, their gates,

is “Mates!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
4 RROWSMITH’S room was on the
street level, and opened on to the
street. The room behind it was
°Ocupied by his friend Dr. Morrison, who
ilj *d lafgly graduated at the Sydney University.
Arrowsmith and Morrison had known each
other for many years, and one was never
lonely while the other was near by; neither
did one ever need for anything while it was
in the power of the other to help. Being
friends, it went as a matter of course that
when one spoke frankly to the other, the
other did not doubt that the frank words
were meant for his benefit. . .
Arrowsmith seated at his writing-table
could hear Morrison moving about in the
room next door to him, but somehow or
other the sounds made by Morrison did not
seem like those made by one so close to him.
They appeared to come from far-oft, as
though deadened by distance. Arrowsmith
wondered if he were going deaf. Certainly
his sense of hearing appeared to be dulled—
perhaps he had done too much surfing lately,
or, perhaps, wliat Morrison had said to him
yesterday had some truth in it.
“Jack, you’ve got to go quietly. You ve
got blood-pressure, old man, and . that’s not
a good thing to have about you in weather
like this. Put the brakes on, and go as slowly
as you can. Blood-pressure, when it deals
it out to a fellow, hits him with, an axe.
Arrowsmith had promised his friend that lie
would mend his ivays and go slowly. With
a laugh he said it was easy advice to fol-
low. All his life he had loved to take
matters carefully.
On the table in front of Arrowsmith lay
a letter faded by age. It had been written
in the early days of the colony by another
John Arrowsmith to a sweetheart in Eng-
land, a bonnie Devon girl. Arrowsmith
picked it up and re-read it. This was the
tenth time, at least, he had done so. What
was the fascination in this letter, not found
in any other of the many letters las grand-
father had left behind him, that made lam
read and re-read it? Did it lie in that one
passage which he knew well enough to
quote word for word?
Dear there is a rascal here, a convict, who hates
me. He is named John Sable, and the name fits him.
Black-haired, black-eyed, black-hearted He is a
mighty man, inches over six feet. He wears a
livid scar, reaching from ear to chin my gut. lie
will wear it to his dying day. I gave it to him.
Authority demanded that I should do so. He struck,
and 1 struck back—he with his fist, I with a sword.
1 know that he will hate me to the end—but there,
dear, since 1 do not fear the ruffian, and since 1 am
soon to have you with me, let us talk of .pleasant
matters.
Arrowsmith put the letter away, with
his elbows on the table, leant liis forehead upon
his hands. How the veins in Ins head
throbbed! There was something, too, that
seemed to be scabbing into his brain, like a
sharp steel point. It was the ticking ot the
old French clock on the mantelpiece, the
clock had been in his family for three genera-
tions, keeping even step with Time seldom
lagging behind, seldom speeding before.
Somewhere, in some old town in France, a
master craftsman had endeavored to put per-
fection into its mechanism and had well-nigh
succeeded. Tortured by its ticking, which
had never before so impressed itself on Ins
notice, Arrowsmith raised his eyes and looked
at the clock. The hands marked twelve, and,
even as he watched, slowly, solemnly, the
clock struck the hour.
In the room next door Morrison heard and
counted the strokes. Then, taking his watch
from his pocket, he compared the time with
that of the clock. “Right to the tick—it s
a wonderful old timekeeper. Pity men don t
make the like nowadays.”. Then, turning
another page of the scientific magazine that
was helping him to pass the hours, he went
on reading. , , , ,
Arrowsmith turned from the clock and
took up a book. In another hour Morrison
would call out to him, and they would go
together, as they had done for years past,
up to the little eating-house at Miller's
Point, have lunch, smoke a pipe or two, and
play a game of draughts or dominoes. They
liked the little.eating-house with its darkened
cedar panelling. It seemed to be cobwebbed
with old-time memories, redolent of some-
thing more appealing than that which bur-
thened its tables.
Yesterday the book had chained him to its
pages, to-day the red blood of interest seemed
to have gone out of it. Presently he thrust
it aside, and lay back in his chair. His eyes
were burning, his head throbbing. How
appalling the noises of the city had suddenly
become! Never had he heard them so loud,
so insistent. It seemed to him that they
clamored to be heard. Bells clanged,
whistles shrilled, wheels ground their way in
grooves of steel. Yet it was curious to
realise that amongst all these noises
the ticking of the clock, thin, measured, dis-
tinctive, asserted itself. It was as though
Time were telling all other things that it
alone was permanent.
Presently, as though called by it, Arrow-
smith turned towards the clock again. Then,
leaning forward in his chair and scarcely
breathing, he stared steadfastly at it. He
opened his mouth, and a grotesque sound
issued from it. Had Morrison in the next
room been listening he might have heard
that sound—half groan, half chuckle. Yet
Morrison, too, if he had seen what Arrow-
smith saw, might have given vent to just
the same sound. What Arrowsmith saw
was this—the hands of the clock stood at
five minutes to twelve. Since the clock had
struck, time had retreated five minutes.
What did it mean? The dial of the clock
held him, fascinated him, as a snake holds a
bird. What did it mean? Still leaning for-
ward, still scarcely breathing,, strange
thoughts came to him. W T hat. if all the
clocks of the world were behaving as this
was. What if all their hands were circling
from right to left, instead of from left to
right? Well if this were so it would mean
that time was on the reverse—that it was
going backward, instead of forward. What
was true of the clocks would doubtless, also,
be true of the universe.
Arrowsmith, bewildered, amazed, took no
notice of the pains in his head, the heat in
his eyes.
The earth, every planet, every star, might
even now be revolving in the revetse direc-
tion to that in which it had revolved since
the beginning of things—unreeling itself, as
it were, unwinding the thread of history. If
so, what would happen—what would remain
when the process of unwinding came to an
end?
Eyes intent on the clock, Arrowsmith per-
ceived that the big hand had crept back
another five minutes. It was now ten
minutes to twelve.

ACCIDENTS will happen, and the germs of skin-
disease are always round about us. To be fore-
armed with Zam-Buk is a wise precaution.
Whether it be a simple injury, a worrying outbreak
of rash or pimples, or a painful attack of eczema or
ulcers, Zam-Buk is equally indispensable. Of herbal
origin, Zam-Buk has antiseptic, healing and soothing
properties all associated in the purest and most effective
manner possible.
Zam-Buk makes and keeps a wound or sore clean
and healthy, whilst its unique healing properties ensure
the growth of new skin. The skin that is once made
healthy by Zam-Buk has the best chance of keeping free
from future troubles. Another advantage of Zam-Buk
is that it keeps its medicinal power No
matter how long you keep a box of Zam-Buk, it will
never turn rancid and useless like common ointments
and salves made up of animal fats and mineral drugs.

Suddenly it seemed to Arrowsmith that a
strange stillness had befallen the world out-
side. No bells chimed or clanged, no whistles
shrilled, no wheels ground in their steel
grooves. Could it be that all traffic had
stopped, that the trams had ceased to run,
the ferryboats to ply, the ships at the
wharves to load and unload their cargoes.
Had the city fallen asleep. And why were
the cicadas singing? How came they to be
about?
The doorway of his room was in the centre
of the front of the house. He rose and
stepped to it, stood midway, and looked out.
Then he knew his clock had registered truly
—that time was, indeed, on the reverse,
Opposite him he remembered there had stood
houses, acres of them, between his house and
the western shore of Circular Quay. Now
there were none; a gumtree or two occu-
pied their places. And Circular Quay—what
had happened to it! Where had all the
wharves and the sheds on the wharves gone?
And what had become of all the big liners?
He had seen a picture of Sydney Cove,
drawn by an early artist. How near to
truth that artist had been! There were the
rocks he had shown and there the little
beaches. And out there, past the point—
Dawes Point—the very sloop he had pictured
riding at anchor.
It was noon, a summer sun was pouring
down its still, fierce heat, cicadas were sing-
ing.
He wondered for whom that woman m the
grey dress with the scarlet scarf round her
throat down there on the rocks was waiting
—for her man on yonder sloop, perhaps.
Here and there in the distance he saw groups
of men—men dressed in grey also. Now and
again he saw some with red coats on-
soldiers, no doubt.
So this was Sydney Cove —just rocks and
sand and blue sparkling water; not a liner,
not a wharf, not a ferry. Yonder at the
Cove's head, running inland, must be the
Tank Stream. How few buildings there
were, and how mean and small they looked!
But the trees on the hills looked fine, and
how fine was the warbling of the magpies in
their green, floating, filmy tops! He wished
the clock behind him would stop ticking,
because it interfered with the music of the
magpies.
A squad of men, grey-garbed, with axes
in their hands and marked with broad arrows,
were coming down the road in front of his
house. Soldiers marched beside them. No
doubt they were going somewhere to do more
clearing work.
Who was he at the rear of the squad
who towered over all of them—a mighty
man, black-haired, black-eyed, with a livid
scar stretching across his face from ear to
chin? Why did he turn and face Arrow-
smith and come towards him swinging his
axe ?
Had Morrison in the next room been list-
ening he might have heard Arrowsmith say
in a voice tense with fear: “No, no, John
Sable, I never did you harm. Keep down
that axe.”
But Morrison a moment after did hear
Arrowsmith’s great agonised cry for help,
and the heavy, dull thud of his body as it
struck the floor.
A minute afterwards Morrison put away
his stethoscope and allowed the dead man s
head to fall back gently.
“Blood pressure,” he said. “It hit him like
an axe. But too soon, oh, too soon.”
Then he took his watch from his pocket
and noted the time—half-past 12. Looking
from the watch to the clock he saw that the
clock Jiad stopped at half-past 11.
“But I could have sworn that I heard it
strike 12,” said Morrison, bewildererd.
RODERIC QUINN.
Travelling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OVER the miles of sun-baked plain
and spinifex ridge the weekly train
crawled like a wounded snake, and its
passage was not fast enough to stir a breath
of wind. There was nothing to give relief
to the eye, and even the light foliage of the
mountain-gums looked sickly in the after-
noon heat. It seemed a landscape made ot
metal —metallic rocks, metallic trees and
spiky blades of metallic grass. And out of
the ground rose waves of heat that hovered
about like the fumes from molten masses in
a crucible.
Such of the passengers as had coats had
shed them long ago and placed them under
their heads for pillows. Their boots were
scattered about the floor and their legs
stretched promiscuously along the seats, ex-
cept for the little bald-headed man who dozed
with his head on the window-sill, fully
clothed and in possession of his dignity. The
dignity of a hooked fish lying with open
mouth on the bank of a river! In the next
compartment the four drovers were all asleep,
huddled among their swags, but one of them,
a bearded young fellow, roused himself when
the guard came crawling along the footboard.
“Hey. how far is it to Dumbarra now,
Guard?”
“Call it half an hour, Johnny. It’s maybe
more.”
“Well, wake me when we get there. My
tongue’s hanging out for a drink like a week-
old calf’s.”
Then, as the guard crawled away, carrying
a water-bag to someone up forward who had
discovered a bottle of whisky, the drover re-
peated in a sort of litany: “We’re the blokes
that brought down the Rainey River cattle.
Stuck to them till they was wore out and
couldn’t raise a canter.”
“Eh?” said someone.
“The worst blank scrubbers along the
Gulf,” droned Johnny. “Horns as long as
your arms and the pace of kangaroo-dogs.
And we’re only blanky noo chums at the
game, the whole bunch of us.”
lie was a little quick rat of a fellow,
very different from his mates, who were big.
sun-bronzed men with the slumbering potency
of the bush in their blood. When we finally
reached Dumbarra he was the first to hop out
of the carriage.
“Dumbarra, boys! Shake a leg, every-
one.”
“Eh?” said one of the big drovers, feeling
for his boots.
“The soak we’ve been waiting for,” said
Johnny. “No grass, but the chance of a good
drink for the wdiole mob.”
There was certainly the chance of a drink;
apparently that was all the place existed for.
The ramshackle pub lay a couple of hundred
yards away, across a dusty space where a
handful of goats were wandering disconso-
lately among the empty jam-tins and coils of
wire. A little dazed, we trickled across in
twos and threes,, a man here and there stop-
ping to lace his boots. The atmosphere of a
dream hovered over everything. Was it yester-
day, or only that morning, the train had
started out on its slow passage through the
spinifex ridges? And had the smouldering
sun ceased to move across that stretch of
steel-colored sky?
A,t the bar twenty or thirty men breasted
staring dumbly at the gaudily-
dressed navvy with pink cheeks and a glass
of advertised beer in his hand.
“We’ve come all the way down from the
Rainey River,” Johnny was telling the bar-
man. “A hell of a trip, too! What do you
reckon are the worst blanky cattle along the
Gulf?”
“Why, the Rainey River cattle, sure,” said
the barman, brisking among the glasses.
“Well, we’ve brought down a thousand head
of them.” said Johnny. “A thousand blanky
head! Stuck to them for weeks till they
wouldn’t gallop if a tree fell in the night.
And we’re only noo chums at the game, the
whole bunch of us.”
There was such a clatter in the bar that
the full odyssey could not be heard. lie
repeated it to each one of us in turn, his
little, restless eyes peering into our faces.
He had a cheque so big, he added, that even
the storekeeper at Camooweal could not
change it; but there was no need to change it
here, for there was a litter of notes on the
counter, and the barman took toll from them
indiscriminately after every round of drinks.
At the end of the counter Johnny’s three
mates drank and had nothing to say. They
seemed dazed and muzzy, as if they had not
slept for weeks, but wete determined to sleep
now, even when they were on their feet. Their
lank hair straggled out from underneath their
shapeless hats, and both their clothes and
their skins seemed to have absorbed a full
complement of dust. What were the pictures
moving in front of their heavy eyes? SpinL
fex ridges, tangled horns in the crush, camels
plodding along through the sand.
“We’re the blokes that brought down the
Rainey River cattle,” came Johnny’s voice
from the end of the bar, “and you know what
they're like.”
“Look out that train don’t go,” said some-
one.
“It can’t go while I’m here,” grunted the
guard. “The boys from the engine will be
over in a minute.”
Over by the tin shed the engine panted,
radiating heat, and two women in a front
carriage looked out wearily at the ridges of
spinifex. Their hats were off, and they leaned
back in attitudes of complete abandonment,
fanning themselves with newspapers. Now
that it had come to rest, the deserted train
looked like a fixed part of the landscape, an
outcrop of dark, metallic rock. Only the two
horses, penned in a truck near the guard’s
van, asserted its fugitive character. They
thrust lean heads out of the opening and
gazed with strange, moist eyes at the tawny
hills, the ramshackle pub and the handful of
gOatS. J £ 11
In the bar a fictitious liveliness had fallen
on everyone. Voices were raised in banter,
and the barman moved around with strained
eyes and dexterous hands, doing complicated
sums in his head. His chief concern seemed
to be that each man, in that confusion of
notes and silver, should get his right change
and his ordered drink. Not his to move m a
timeless world among phantoms! His black,
alert eyes were alive and real.
“Now, then, boys,” said the guard. ‘Only
time for a last drink!”
In the busy silence that followed, the
only sound to be heard was Johnny’s refrain,
rendered more liturgical than ever by un-
counted drinks.
“We’re the blokes that brought down the
Rainey River cattle —the cattle no one else d
touch. Stuck to them till they wouldn’t
gallop if a shell fell among ’em. And we re
only blanky noo chums at the game, the
whole bunch of us.”
We wandered over to the deserted tram
again, pausing to stare abstractedly at the
tawny ridges with their myriad spears of
spinifex. A little cool wind, come wander-
ing down from the Gulf, began to stir up
tiny spirals of dust.
“That little fellow’s about done in,” said
the guard. “Wants a good spell away from
it all, lie does. He’s been talking that way
ever since he came aboard.”
“Talk, yes,” said one of the tall drovers.
“It’s a sort of habit with some.”
“Stones rattling in a kerosene-tin,” said
his mate sleepily. “He’s been at it ever
since we picked him up this side of Camoo-
weal. Our cook went on the spree there,
and we had to take this fellow on for a
# week or two. His tongue is the only part of
him that works proper: but in most ways
lie’s harmless enough.”
They climbed aboard with the rest, settled
their coats under their heads, and were asleep
by the time the train began to crawl away
through that land of silence.
VANCE PALMER.
After Sickness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I had been ill a summer long;
I had not sung a single song.
Pain drowned my soul where shadows keep
The lost lagoon of lotus sleep.
I watched the great blooms open wide
In dewy silence sanctified; _
I tried to pluck one cool with ease
Of death’s divine uncertainties.
Time whispered softly, “Nay, not yet.”
But how may I so soon forget
That peace from deeps unsounded brought,
Too calm for contemplative thought?
Stillness has wonder great as strife
And timelessness her own rich life....
The fragrance of the flower of death
Some day shall take away our breath.

In the Country Home not served with electric
current the lady in the home is still working far
harder than necessary. She needs more time to
devote to her children and to make her home more
comfortable and beautiful.
She needs equally as much as her partner, and
perhaps even more, the freedom from drudgery
that brings.
Consider the value of correct lighting alone.
Good lighting in the farm home and in and
around the farm buildings probably contributes
more to the comfort and happiness of all members
of the family than any other single convenience.
Every member of the family uses this convenience
in all hours each day, and more days of the year,
than any other one thing—even including the
automobile.
The value of sufficiently bright lighting pro-
perly located and protected, and instantly avail-
able by tipping a switch, can hardly be over-
estimated. Oil lamps burn the oxygen out of the
air, making it unfit to breathe, and thus often
cause ill health.
The comparatively poor light they give discourag.es reading
and study, and if used extensively may impair the eyesight. With
them there is the ever present danger of fire.
Electric lighting is odorless, consumes no oxygen, and gives
the most flexible kind of artificial illumination with the least danger
of fire.
It is of such great value to rid the country home of the fire
danger of oil light that it cannot be estimated. The Home
Light and Power Unit supplies this medium. In addition it will also
drive the electric clothes-washer, electric dish-washer, electric
vacuum-cleaner and electric iron, electric toaster and electric
percolator.
