GEORGE ELIOT AT SEA.
I have read somewhere that George Eliot was “ a
fiery soul.’ Perhaps that is the reason she was
never at home in the venter. I suspect she could
not swim ; and when the characters in her novels
go boating she is always at sea—even if they are
only sculling on a river.
This is a pity, for she drowns heroes and heroine 8
with ag little compunction as if they were kittens.
I complain that they do not drown naturally. One
does not object to Dunstan Cass, in “ Silas
Marner,” walking into the stone-pit to perish;
although you think that he, a hoy bred in the
neighbourhood, should have had more sense. Nor
do I care to dispute about probabilities when
Adam Bede finds his father in the Willow Brook.
But these are simple cases, which it would be
hard to bungle if one tried. It is when she
attempts complex drownings that we feel George
ElioFs deficiencies.
For example, Tito’s death in “ Romola ” is not
well done. A fine swimmer, as he is said to be,
would not get exhausted in a few minutes. In a
river, he Could easily swim five or even ten miles
with the current. Or he could simply drift along.
No swimmer would persevere to exhaustion in
such a case. He would either make for the shore
when he grew tired, or turn on his back and float.
If Tito had lus mail-coat on I could understand
it, but “he no longer wore his armour.” Of
course it is necessary for him to become exhausted,
or he would not fall a prey to Baldassarre. But
machine-gods should confine themselves to the
land, and not meddle with people in the water. I
am a pretty fair swimmer myself, and in the
name of Leander, Byron, . Gormly, Self and Co., I
protest against such unwarrantable catastrophes.
Were Tito alive, he would protest, too. If lady
novelists think a fellow gets exhausted after
swimming a few hundred yards in a river, with
the stream, lady novelists must be taught dif-
ferently.
Then, as to the fate of Tom and Maggie Tulli-
ver, one’s indignation is excusably warm. If Tom
could not manage the boat so as to avoid being
stove in, he should have given the sculls to his
sister. I am positive Maggie would have saved
both lives, in spite of the conduct of the floating
debris, which is truly extraordinary. To begin
with, buildings are not usually broken into “ huge
fragments ”by a flood. If they float away at all,
they nearly always float bodily. Nor do “ huge
fragments make one wide mass across the stream.”
Variations of the current prevent that. And
even supposing that Tom was in the way of a
mass of huge fragments, carried along at a
speed of six miles an hour—a sufficient esti-
mate under the circumstances —how was he
overtaken when his beat was presumably drifting
just as fast? What hindered him from turn-
ing the boat’s head and pulling away with the
current ? Or why did he not endeavour to obtain
footing on a “huge fragment”? Sailors, in a
collision, have leaped upon the bows of an
approaching vessel, or upon an iceberg. The
picture in my copy of “ The Mill on the Floss ”
shows the approach of a “ huge fragment” which
looks like part of the foundation of a crane. One
of Tom’s sculls is gone, and he has stopped pull-
ing. He is standing up in the boat, a light 15ft.
skiff, clasping Maggie in his arms and waiting for
annihilation. What I should do, in his place,
would be to make the skiff fast to a ring-bolt on
the “ huge fragment” (there is one convenient in
the picture) and float downstream looking for
something to turn up. No doubt Maggie would
have done this had not her brother flurried her.
It is provoking to see two young people drowned
so foolishly. Ido not regret Tom much, but
Maggie was a girl in a thousand.
The manner of Grandcourt’s taking-off in
“ Daniel Deronda ”is equally unsatisfactory. I
do not grieve for Grandcourt any more than for
Tom, but he was not a bad fellow at bottom.
There was no cant about him, at all events ; and
Gwendolen is rather worse off when he goes, since
she is torn by remorse, and Deronda will have
nothing to do with her, In any case, the affair is
clumsily managed. I have never sailed a boat in
the Gulf of Genoa, so I do not know what the
wind is like ; but Grandcourt was probably trying
to jibe when a puff came. This would agree with
Gwendolen’s statement: “ I don’t know how it
was —he was turning the sail —there was a gust
—he was struck.” The fishermen thought
maybe he had been “ knocked overboard by the
flapping of the sail while putting about;”
but this is hardly likely. If he carried
a boom, and handled the boat very care-
lessly, he might have been swung overboard,
but where was Gwendolen sitting that she
wasn’t hit too? And, even if the boat jibed,
would Grandcourt be “swept over” without her
capsizing ? Then what is he about to drown so
quickly ? Gwendolen was not sure that he could
swim ; but is it probable that an English country
gentleman like Grandcourt had never learnt?
Would he be likely to take his wife out sailing if
he could not swim ? Deronda thought “he must
have been seized with cramp,” but people do not
get cramp the minute they fall into water; and
even if they do, and can swim, they keep afloat.
Of course I would like to know what kind of boat
Grandcourt hired before pronouncing a decided
opinion; but the accident is certainly mysterious.
I do not go so far as to say that George
Eliot’s works are entirely spoilt by her failure to
appreciate these considerations; but, as a swim-
mer, I would be much better pleased had Tito
floated five or six miles down the river, then
landed fresh as paint and killed Baldassarre after
a brief struggle ; or if Tom Tulliver had swum
ashore on his back with Maggie on his arm. They
had plenty of time to take off any clothes that
encumbered them; and Tom, as a miller’s son,
who had doubtless bathed in the mill-pool
as soon as he could walk, should have been
easily equal to such a feat. Grandcourt
ought to have capsized the boat and sup-
ported Gwendolen in the water till help came,
when her feelings towards him would have under-
gone a complete change, and they would have lived
happily together. Of course, we must take our
author as we find her ; but I am astonished that
Lewes, with all his versatility, did not know
enough to set his wife right. One thing is plain :
we should, for the sake of future lady novelists,
teach all our girls to swim. The only alternative
is to insist that doomed personages be removed by
poison or the cord.

The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing as (hey J do"the wonderful success of the ‘‘KEEPER”

country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to

We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,

properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”

A BIG BIZI
Our Trade is Big I Our Store is Big 1
Our Ideas are Big I
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and dep'orably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Pew Swear by Us I
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with ns the better dividends you receive.

SKINS ON FIRE
With Agonizing Eczemas and other Itching, Burning, Scaly, and
Blotchy Skin and Scalp Diseases are relieved in the majority of cases
by a single application of the Cuticura Remedies, and speedity, perma-
nently, and economically cured, when phy-
sicians, hospitals, and all other remedies
fail. Cuticura Remedies are the great-
est skin cures, blood purifiers, and humor
remedies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and may be used in the treatment of
every humor, from the simplest facial blem-
ishes to the severest diseases of the blood,
skin, and scalp.
CUTICURA
The great Skin Cure, instantly allays the
most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, clears the scalp
of crusts and scales, speedily soothes and
heals raw and irritated surfaces, and restores
the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
Skin Purifier and Beautifier, is indispensa-
ble in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuti-
cura Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin
Purifier, and greatest of Humor Remedies,
cleanses the blood of all impurities and poi-
sonous elements, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Reme-
dies cure every disease and humor of the skin, from pimples to scrofula.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY
Much Distressed,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her Majesty the Queen was much distressed at the ter-
rible news of the wreck of the steamer Kibe.
The noisy urchins scampered round
Amidst the careless crowd :
“ An orful wreck ! Three ’underd drown’d !”
They cried the news aloud.
We bought a paper, paused, and read
With melancholy zest,
Then winked our other eye, and said —
“The Queen will be distressed.”
We felt it coming from the first;
Court flunkeys took the hint,
And promptly got a royal burst
Of sorrow into print.
The cable told the touching tale
Exactly as we guessed
We never knew her grief to fail,
The Queen was much distressed-
In time of war, should British blood
Be shed by niggers mean,
Or when an earthquake, or a flood,
Appears upon the scene ;
Or accidents in mines excite
Some public interest,
Then, posing in a blaze of light.
The Queen is much distressed.
The “ gag ” has charmed our loyal friends
For many foolish years :
They seem to think the monarch spends
Her “ screw ” in gracious tears.
But homeless poor, without regret,
Sink starving to their rest:
These live and die in rags, and yet
The Queen is not distressed.
Dear reader, did your mother weep
Upon your sister’s neck,
And couldn’t your good lady sleep
For thinking of that wreck ?
These women true forgot to grieve,
You cheerfully protest—
Nay, what is more, they don’t believe
The Queen was much distressed.

The Melb. papers are loud in praise of the
performances of certain well-advertised detectives
in re the “great tobacco robberies.” Yet the
matter was sprung by a man in the force “on
approbation,” who gets none of the praise and
little of the .£2OO reward. He found the root and
the clever ones found the tree.

Captain William Jackson Barry, the his-
torical Maoriland crank whose fish-stories—espe-
cially the one about his ride on the back of a
whale—are the most amazing things of their kind
in this hemisphere, is reported to have an entirely
new version of the Tichborne mystery. According
to the Captain, Cresswell and the famous Claimant
and the mysterious pauper who was buried at
Geelong are all equally bogus. The real Roger
Tichborne is now living in seclusion in N.S.
Wales, and the Captain, who knew him well when
he was a boy, reckons that he could find him if he
is badly wanted. As it happens, he isn’t wanted,
badly or otherwise. This afflicted generation
couldn’t stand any more Tichborne Claimant.

The Victorian drink statistics show that,
in ’9O, £6,730,430 was- spent in liquor, and 18,407
people were convicted of aggravated drunkenness,
or a total of £365 13s. spent in drink for each
drunk convicted. In ’93, on the other band, the
aggregate liquor-bill was £3,749,577, and the num-
ber of drunks captured by the police was 12,688,
equal to only £295 7s. worth of liquor consumed
for each drunk officially captured. This suggests
three possible explanations. One is that the
country has given up champagne and taken to
beer. Another, that owing to the prevailing
scarcity the police can’t select their drunks as
they used to do, and instead of only taking the
rare and picturesque specimens, have to be satis-
fied with whatever specimens they can get. And
the third possibility is that drink is cheaper, and
that a man who formerly required £365 13s. worth
of liquor to make him tight, can now get
gloriously fuddled for the comparatively small
outlay of £295 7s.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1895.
Bung, the Poisoner.
Within the last few weeks New South Wales
has suffered an unpleasant awakening in re
the mysteries of the drink-traffic. The
awakening has had no sort of connection
with teetotalism, and has not served to bring
the Cold Tea millennium one whit nearer.
The public is already aware that water, even
allegedly “pure ” water, contains germs, and
mineral salts, and traces of decayed vegeta-
tion, and dead horse, and old, defunct dog,
and deceased ’possum, and native-bear that
has joined the great majority, therefore the
rampant apostle who demands that the world
shall drink nothing save cold water does not
appeal strongly to the clean-living section of
the community. It knows also that tea is a
strange substance which may have been trod-
den on by leprous feet and packed by scaly
hands, and which is eminently calculated to
arouse suspicion. It has learned that milk is a
substance which is very often squeezed by a
dirty man out of a dirty, tuberculosed cow ;
that the milk, even when it isn’t exposed to
the atmosphere in an unclean dairy, and put
in an unwashed can, and deteriorated through
the cow getting its hind foot in the pail, is a
substance which gathers infection almost
faster than any other ; and, therefore, it has
begun to view this fluid also with a distrust-
ful eye. Also it has learned, at different
times, strange and objectionable facts about
almost everything else which it eats and
drinks. And lately the people of Australia
have ascertained that their various alcoholic
beverages are as unwholesome and as badly
adulterated as the rest, and that art is just
about as unclean and as objectionable as
nature. This discovery doesn’t help on the
temperance cause, for the fact that whisky
is poisonous doesn’t make milk any less
poisonous, and the fact that beer is dirty
doesn’t make tea, or the Chinaman by whom
it is packed, any cleaner. But it creates a
feeling of vague unrest, and a shadowy idea
that something not very well defined should
be done to alleviate the gigantic evil.
* • •
So far as can be gathered from the evi-
dence available, the drink trade is a vast and
complicated system of thievery, adulteration,
dirt and slow poison from beginning to end.
The process begins in Europe, and its ending
is in the back-blocks cemetery where the
victim of the last of a long series of adultera-
tors is buried after his final orgie. Much of
the alleged brandy and whisky imported into
Australia is a ghoulsome compound known
as “ Belgian spirit,” which can be landed in
Sydney —so several experts declare upon
oath—at three shillings per case of two gallons.
The price is not much higher than that of
road-scrapings or any other form of refuse,
and the quality strictly corresponds with the
price. A German horror of about the same
character is another prominent feature in
the importations. A very large item—pro-
bably as large as both the above combined—
is the white spirit of illicit local manufacture,
which is secretly turned out in enormous
quantities and sold at Bs., or less, per gallon,
a figure which fairly corresponds with the
villainousness of its general character. The
amount of thisawfulcompound which is puton
the market cannot be ascertained, but some
idea can be formed of the extent of the trade
by the constant seizures made by the police.
Considering that the discovery of an illicit-
still, conducted in a suitable spot by a reason-
ably intelligent law-breaker, is about as diffi-
cult as the discovery of the long-lost bones
of Leichhardt, the capture, within a small
radius, of eight distillers inside of three
months probably represents many scores
more distillers who are still at large and
undetected.
#
Another branch of the trade is represented
oy the large importations of methylated
spirit, which is supposed, by a stupid fiction
of the law, to be unfit and unavailable for
human consumption, but which can be
rendered drinkable, after a fashion, by a
very simple process well-known to almost
everybody except the legal authorities. This
represents another large item in the spirit
supply of Australia, and accounts for the fact
that the man who buys a glass of Sydney
public-house spirits often has a hazy sort of
idea that he tastes and smells paint in his
glass. Another great feature of the trade is
the alleged whisky and brandy manufactured
by chemists. The lawful stock-in-trade of
the chemist includes everything required for
the cheap compounding of villainous alcoholic
drinks which, in the matter of aroma, taste
and general appearance, can pass inspec-
tion by nine out of ten among ordinary
drinkers. A still larger item is the raw
white spirit “ doctored ” by the publican on
his own premises. This is done so openly
that a book was recently published and circu-
lated, in Sydney, giving full instructions how
to compound out of all manner of cheap and
loathsome ingredients, the beverages which
are matured under the publican’s bed instead
of beneath the sunshine of Burgundy or in
the fogs of Scotland. This volume was
apparently issued under the auspices of a
leading Sydney trader. Further, there is
no security to be gained by buying the
most reputable brands in sealed bottles,
with the label and capsule as a guarantee
of reliability, partly because cheap and
horrible forgeries of every well-known
brand can be imported from Germany or
elsewhere, and chiefly because every pub-
lican, importer, and wholesale-dealer can
buy the labels and capsules in any quan-
tity, and make all his own Hennessy and
Martell and fine old Highland whisky on
the premises.
*
Therefore, the chances are about 100 to 1
against any purchaser being able to get a
single drink of reasonably pure liquor in
N.S. Wales. Even if the average importer
wants to keep faith with the public—
which he doesn’t, because if he does keep
faith with the public he is undersold by un-
scrupulous competitors until he is driven out
of the trade—he is always liable to be
deceived by the German, or Belgian, or
British, or other swindler at the European
end of the trade. If the wholesale dealer
wants to act “on the square”—which he
mostly doesn’t either, for exactly the same
reason—he is deceived, either by the im-
porter or the European manufacturer. If
the retailer desires to be honest—and he
can’t afford to have any such desire, even
assuming that he has a natural tendency
towards honesty, which is wholly improbable
—he is defrauded by the wholesale dealer
and the other two. But, as none of them
has any natural leanings towards honesty, the
importer introduces Belgian spirit at Is. 6d.
a gallon, and the next middleman “blends”
it with other horrors ; and the retailer buys
a certain quantity of it to give his business a
feeble outward pretence of honesty, and
obtains the rest from the chemist, or the
illicit potato-spirit fiend, or else makes it
himself out of minerals, acids, tobacco,
vitriol, aniline dyes, and other beautiful in-
gredients. And the law, as at present con-
structed, in the rum-founded land of New
South Wales at all events, is unable to stop
the sale of books containing recipes for the
manufacture of bogus whisky ; it has no
power to examine or otherwise interfere with
the bogus imported spirit in bond, or to pre-
vent it going into circulation ; it cannot stop
the trade in raw “ white spiritand it
seldom catches the illicit distiller whose
name is legion and whose product is the
condensed essence of the bottomless pit.

The community has long endeavored, in a
feeble sort of fashion, to devise some remedy
for this state of tilings without going too far
out of i its ordinary rut, or interfering too
much with the tired old fetish of “private
enterprise.” Every time the question has
come up the importer has announced confi-
dently, in his own interest, that the high
import duty is the cause of all the trouble,
and through much reiteration of this state-
ment the public has at last come to believe
in it, just as the public believes in anything
which is told to it with sufficient confidence
and persistence. In support of this theory,
Inspector Lenthall, of Sydney, recently
pointed out that in Victoria, where the duty
on spirits is 2s. more per gallon than in N.S.
Wales, the quality is even worse, and that in
Britain, where the duty is from 2s. to 4s. less,
the quality is of the best. Unfortunately,
these statements rest on no very certain evi-
dence. It is a well-known fact that spirits
which are refused admission to Victoria as
being unfit for human consumption are often
sent on to Sydney, where there is far
less effective supervision, and therefore it is
evident that the cornstalk article is, in some
cases at least, the worse of the two. More-
over, the recipes according to which the
N.S. W. publican is instructed to make’his
bogus liquor are the same which circulate in
Victoria, and the drinks produced according
to those recipes are so utterly villainous that
it is almost impossible to conceive how any-
thing worse could be produced by human
ingenuity. Again, though the Victorian Cus-
toms tariff on imported spirits is higher than
that of Britain, its excise is decidedly lower,
therefore, according to this process of reason-
ing, Victoria must have a particularly loath-
some brand of imported drinks, and an
exceedingly excellent brand of local manu-
facture which would necessarily drive the
imported iniquity out of the market. Con-
sequently, if Victorian spirits are especially
bad, as alleged, despite the low excise duty,
it goes to prove that bad spirits are not the
result of high duties, but come to pass
whenever the opportunity offers. As for the
inspector’s childlike faith in the quality of
British alcohol, it also rests on no sure
foundation. A few years ago, Scotland, the
home of the finest whisky on earth, was
shaken by an awful series of revelations as
to the quality of the liquor sold by the
retail publican - exactly the same series of
revelations as those which now trouble New
South Wales. In the course of that up-
heaval every one of the trade iniquities of
Sydney came to light over and over again—
to say nothing of several other iniquities
which have not yet been publicly mentioned
in this country. Since then the evil has
either been mitigated by vigorous super-
vision, or else the community has ceased to
kick against it and regards it as past remedy;
at all events, the subject seems to have
dropped.
*
Even as a mere matter of figures, the
theory that a lower tariff must necessarily
lead to good liquor is distinctly illogical.
Under the present tariff a genuine spirit
may cost, duty paid, 325., while the Bel-
gian imitation costs 275., making a profit of
15| per cent, in favor of the latter. If the
duty were reduced one-half, the good spirit
would cost 20s. and the imitation 155.,
making the profit on the latter 26 per cent.
If the duty were reduced by three-quarters,
the profit on the bogus article would be 42
per cent. A lower duty might possibly tend
to reduce illicit distillation, though even that
is doubtful, for it is hardly possible to get the
duty so low that the illicit trade will not
yield a handsome profit; but it would
distinctly tend to increase the importation
of poisonous alcohol, and the only
difference would be that a local industry
would be injured to assist a foreign one
equally nefarious. Except by the creation
of a State Drink Department, there is no
visible remedy for the existing evils. When
the State makes or imports its own liquors,
analyses them, and sells them, and when it
is the only importer and wholesale and retail
dealer, then the market for German, Belgian,
or illicit alcohol, and for local “blends” of
vitriol, and the like, will be effectually
stopped. No one can import these articles,
for all importations, except those of the
State, Avill be stopped. No one can sell them
to the retailer, for the State will be the only
retailer. The remedy is, at once, simple and
effective. Its only disadvantage is that it
lies outside the old, dismal rut of “private
enterprise,” and the very idea of getting out
of an old, respected, well-established rut is
abhorrent to the public soul.
The Costa Rica Packet Case.
Most Australians have been, during the last
three years, vaguely familiar with the name of
the Costa Rica Packet. The average reader
has dimly understood that by that name there
hung a tale of wrong inflicted by the Dutch
Government upon an Australian captain in the
Malay seas; of vain Australian efforts to
obtain compensation for that wrong ; and of
the British lion crouching with his tail between
his legs before the spectacle of a gross affront
to a British seaman and the British flag. But
the documents in the case, comprised in the
New South Wales Legislative Council return of
Sept. 20, 1894, only in part justify this under-
standing. The Bulletin is not enamoured of
the British connection ; it gives full credence
to Captain Carpenter’s account of the outrage
to which he was subjected ; it recognises that
this outrage was shown by the issue to be quite
unjustifiable; yet it considers that, on the
evidence, a large amount of wild commercial
rhetoric about the case was equally unjustified,
and that much of the irritating delay in settle-
ment has arisen simply and solely because Aus-
tralia attempted to bite off the Dutch Govern-
ment considerably more than she could chew.
* • •
On Jan. 24, 1888, the Sydney-owned barque,
Costa Riba Packet, was 32 miles from Boeroe
Island, in the Moluccas. A derelict prow was
sighted. Capt. Carpenter lowered a boat, and
part of the prow’s damaged cargo of spirits—a
few cases—was brought on board the Costa
Rica Packet. Portion of this was drunk by
the crew ; portion was thrown overboard ; and
portion was (by the crew) exchanged for 751 b.
sugar at Batjan, a Netherlands-India (Dutch)
port at which the barque next touched. Capt.
Carpenter noted the finding of the prow in
the ship’s log, which was placed at the disposal
of the Batjan port authorities; he also men-
tioned the matter verbally to the authorities ;
but he did not, as seems to have been expected
by the Dutch, state the facts in writing in the
port return which he filled up, because he did
not understand the Dutch language. Capt.
Carpenter denies that there was any mark -on
the cases, and makes no mention of any on the
bottles. The Dutch say that many of the cases
were branded “Frieser”—the name of an
Amboyna merchant, who, they allege, took over
the business which Capt. Carpenter carried on
there from 1880 to 1885. Capt. Carpenter
denies that Frieser took over his business—
which, he says, he simply closed. However,
the first and second officers of the Costa Rica
Packet, while affirming that there was no
mark on the cases, say that on some of the
bottles there was a trade-mark which Capt.
Carpenter told them was his own mark when
trading, at Amboyna. At all events, the
Chinese who bought the spirits complained that
many of the bottles were filled with salt water,
and the Oontroleur of the port dismissed the
complaint as trivial. But he subsequently
wrote to Frieser, at Amboyna, telling him of
the finding of the prow and the sale of the
spirits ; and Frieser complained to the Court
of Justice at Macassar. First question : How
did the Controleur know the prow belonged to
Frieser, if the marks were insufficient for
identification ? If they were sufficient for the
Controleur, why were they not sufficient for
Capt. Carpenter? Did he not know what
firm at Amboyna was using his old trade-mark?
* * *
Second question : Supposing even that Capt.
Carpenter could not identify the owner of the
spirits, was he justified in permitting his crew
to use them and sell them ? The Dutch say
No; and quote Ferouson on “International
Law,” part 1, p. 345 :
If ships or goods have been salved or picked up at sea,
without either the master or other commander or the
owner of the cargo being present or known to the sah ois,
the objects salved shall be transported to the place neares.
to that of the salvage and delivered to the chief magis-
trate (17 and 18 Vic., chap. 104, sec. 45).
And this seems reasonable. Of course, it is the
custom of mariners to consider flotsam lawful
booty, to be used at discretion; but such a
view cannot be defended at law. Supposing
the cargo of the prow had been gold coin, would
Capt. Carpenter have been right in giving
some to the crew, throwing some overboard,
and permitting the sale of the remainder ? And
does the value of the cargo make any difference
to the principle involved ? The Dutch say
No; the action of Capt. Carpenter was an
offence against Dutch law and international
law, which the Netherlands-India tribunals
were competent to deal with.
« « •
And here, apparently, is where the Dutch
was wrong. For Netherlands-India jurisdic-
tion extends only three miles from the coast,
whereas the alleged piracy took place 32 miles
from the coast. The Dutch were misled by the
inaccurate, perhaps biassed, evidence of a pas-
senger on board the Costa Rica Packet. But,
considering the trivial nature of the offence,
and the obvious bond fides of Capt. Carpenter
regarding a cargo which could never have paid
him for salvage, his technical fault might well
have been passed over. The matter was, in
fact, allowed to lie in abeyance for nearly three
years —until Nov. 1, 1891, when Capt. Car-
penter was arrested at Teruate, though he had
been at that port twice since the alleged
piracy, in 1889 and 1890, and at Macassar in
April, 1888, three months after it happened,
without hearing anything of his alleged offence.
He was sent from Ternate to Macassar, 1000
miles away, by steamer, which left on Nov. 6
and arrived on Nov. 16. At Macassar (the
Dutch laws not admitting of bail) he was im-
prisoned till Nov. 28, when he was released —
partly, it appears, owing to the representations
of the British authorities at the Straits Settle-
ments, and partly because the Dutch found the
evidence did not warrant the contention that
the alleged offence took place in their waters.
Capt. Carpenter asserts that after leaving
Ternate he was harshly treated, classed with
the lowest criminals, and subjected to in-
dignities which injured his health. This the
Dutch deny, asserting that he was treated just
as a Dutchman would have been in similar cir-
cumstances. His child was permitted to stay
with him. Three officers, whom he took from
Ternate as witnesses, had their passages paid
by the Government; though the accommodation
provided, both for them and for Capt. Car-
penter, was third-class and very bad.
* « *
On the whole, there seems no doubt that
Capt. Carpenter was very hardly used, with
only a shadow of justification. The Dutch
claim the right of arrest on “ reasonable sus-
picion,” but the circumstances disclose no
ground of “ reasonable suspicion ” warranting
the imprisonment of Capt. Carpenter, particu-
larly when the alleged offence was committed
outside the jurisdiction of the Dutch courts.
Capt. Carpenter is certainly entitled to com-
pensation, and the owners, officers, and sailors
of the Costa Rica Packet, who were jointly
interested in the whaling cruise, should also be
compensated for the loss of time or loss of
skill when the captain’s services and those of
three officers were unavailable. But whether
the claim should reach the stiff figures of
.£lO,OOO for Capt. Carpenter, .£lO,OOO for the
owners, and £5OOO for officers and crew, may


justly he questioned. The figures are defended
on the ground that expected whaling profits
were missed, and that the Costa Rica
Packet lay so long at Ternate that she had
to be sold at a loss. But for these
things Capt. Carpenter himself seems to be
mainly responsible. Third question : Why did
not Ca'pt. Carpenter, when arrested, permit his
vessel to continue the cruise in charge of two
officers? It is said they could not find the
whales, whose whereabouts was known only to
Captain Carpenter. Could not Captain Car-
penter have communicated his knowledge?
But 'the vessel’s whaling-master says that
during her detention at Ternate he was “ fre-
quently informed by captains and officers of
steamers trading among the Dutch possessions
that they\had seen great numbers of whales a
short distance away.” (Return, p. 20.) If
these captains and officers could see the whales,
could not the Costa Rica Packet’s officers ? Or
why did not the vessel follow the captain to
Macassar, in readiness to take up the cruise
when he was acquitted, as from the flimsy
nature of the charge he must have believed he
would be ?
* * *
And, fourth question : Why did not Captain
Carpenter return immediately to his ship
when released, and continue the cruise, making
official claim for compensation in writing, re-
porting t ie fact to his owners in Sydney that
they might take action, and leaving personal
pressure till the cruise was over? Why did he
leave his ship rotting at anchor for five and
a-half months, while, without going near the
ship, he went round to Sydney via Singa-
pore, and deputationised G. (then) Republican
Dikes? The Dutch gave his three officer
wdtnesses passages back to Ternate, and
would doubtless have provided a passage for
Capt. Carpenter, also. He was released at
Macassar on Nov, 28, and says there was no
boat to Ternate till Dec. 20—a delay of 22
days, though at Ternate he had only waited
under arrest six days for the steamer to
Macassar. He says, too, that the return
voyage would have taken 16 days, against 10
days to come. Grant all this, he would still
have reached Ternate on Jan. 5. The whaling
season would have been practically lost, though
something might have been done in the three
weeks which Capt. Carpenter estimates as
remaining (Return, p. 8). But a second season
was anticipated, subsequent to January and
before June, the profits of which Capt. Car-
penter estimates at ,£13,000 in his statement
of loss (Return, p. 35). Why did he not go
ba«k to Ids ship and secure that ,£13,000? His
claim* against the Dutch would have kept till
June, and could have been pressed in his
absence. Or, if he was determined not to go
back, why did he not hand over the ship to his
five officers, with instructions where to fish in
his absence ? Supposing Capt. Carpenter had
died instead of being arrested, would the ship
have been allowed to lie at anchor till shebecame
unserviceable, or would the officers have sailed
her back to Sydney without making an attempt
to carry out the objects of the cruise?
• • «
The Dutch idea is that Capt. Carpenter
(who is by birth a Yankee from Newhaven,
Connecticut, where The Buleetin guesses folk
are pretty spry) “ viewed the affair from the
beginning as a kind of milch cow.” Anyhow,
while he was absent at Sydney, his ship, officers,
and crew were idle at Ternate, the men ailing,
the gear rotting, and the vessel spoiling. Capt.
Carpenter returned, according to his whaling-
master’s account, on April 13, 1892 (according
to his own account, on May 1) ; the Costa Rica
Pa ;ket left for Singapore on May 3, arrived on
May 18, and was sold “ at a great sacrifice,” a
few days after, for £1250. As her value nine
months previously was put at ,£3588, it is diffi-
cult to see why she was not sailed back to
Sydney and refitted, in order to make the esti-
mated profit ©f ,£23,400 next year. Probably
it was thought necessary to square accounts for
the claim against the Dutch. When that claim
reached the British Foreign Office it was cut
down from £25,000 to £2500 for Capt. Car-
penter’s personal damages, though the owners
and crew are fairly entitled to compensation
for probable loss during the time Capt. Car-
penter was compulsorily absent. The Dutch
repudiated liability, but offered to refer the
matter to arbitration ; and this offer has now
been accepted, apparently in respect of the
original claim of £25,000, although G. ex-
Republican Dibbs thought it a cumbrous and
expensive way of dealing with so small a sum.
What the alternative was he didn’t say. Per-
Ifkps, had that painter been cut, Australia
might now be engaged in a war with Holland
id the instigation of the infuriated Chambers of
Commerce. The Costa Rica Packet case doesn’t
seem quite worth that. And, by the way, sup-
posing (fie arbitrators judge the claim excessive,
who will be called upon to pay the costs ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Monotony of Man.
A Farmers’ Association "Convention, held at
the Kanakaland township of Mackay, has en-
ihmai’acsfii.» h ; i v,
lution -- remarkable reso-
mi , * . ~ ,
mat, in view of the increasing number of employers of
labor, and the difficulty of obtaining labor, the Govern-
ment he requested to forthwith renew the assisted ini mi-
it ration of agricultural labor from Europe, or else facilitate
t ie introduction of New Guinea labor.
The audacity ot the italicised phrase is colossal,
Many hundreds of white men are tramping to
and fro along the coast districts of Queensland,
fight in among the nigger-driving, slave-renting
sugar-growers, and are ready and willing to work
at any living wage, but unable to obtain employ-
ment. The wages offered by these Farmers’ Asso-
ciation delegates range from about ss. per week
to 15s. per week in extravagant cases. And
note this: The men who thus call for cheap
and ever cheaper labor are not capitalists—not
hat Men. A few years ago they were all
laborers ; to-day, they farm patches of 50 or
100 or 200 acres, with the aid of three or four
Kanakas and such whites on the point of star-
vatiou as they can induce to accept their miser-
able terms. At the same time every w orking-man
m Kanakaland is taxed heavily to support these
renegade workers who are now eager to tyran-
nise over the class from which they have lately
sprung. The 'North Eton central mill, which
last season made a gross profit of .£lO,OOO
(depreciation and interest not deducted), and
the Race-course central mill, which made a
similar profit of £9OOO, were both erected at
the cost of Government. The money was lent
on security which would have been worthless
had not the industry proved splendidly profit-
able, and with the understanding that white
labor only was to be employed. This under-
standing was almost immediately set at nought;
and the profits which the farmers have made
have been earned almost entirely by Kanaka
labor. Now, while asking for a further supply
of cheap immigrants, they demand also that the
Kanakas be forbidden to take more than a
certain wage, and forbidden also to remain idle
longer than a definitely-limited period. They
desire, in short, an exact reproduction of the
English legislation of the Middle Ages, which
fixed in the interest of employers the conditions
of labor and the rate of wages ; and the cir-
cumstances afford another illustration of the
immutability of the human atom. The passage
of several centuries has not altered in the least
the instinct which leads man to exploit his
fellow-man. Here we have laborers who, with
the assistance of other laborers, have become em-
ployers, doing their best to degrade the men of
their own country and to limit the freedom of the
aliens on whose blood and sweat their fortune
flourishes. Yet socialists tell us that all our
troubles spring from the current competitive
system, and that to abolish human misery it is
merely necessary to abolish that system. It
never seems to strike them that this system is
merely a product of creator man, and that an
imperfect product implies an imperfect creator.
The competitive system, with all its blots and
errors, is a faithful reflex of the competitors.
Pure collectivism, if ever it could be estab-
lished, would still have to deal with a com-
munity of individuals guided by self-interest,
and the millennium would remain as distant as
ever. Only the slow process of evolution can
eradicate the monotonous meanness of mankind.
The “Purified” Elector.
1 he Purification of Rolls Act, which old James
Munro rushed through the Victorian Parlia-
ment during his brief and ignominious Premier-
ship, promises ere long to disfranchise the
whole Victorian population. The Act is a
cmious and elaborate complication. The rate-
payers roll is made up at certain regular—or
irregular—intervals, and 18 months later the
electoral roll is made up, the ratepayers’ roll
being used as a basis. No man whose name is
not on the ratepayers’ roll for the same house
which he occupies when the electoral roll is
made up, can be registered as an elector. If he
has removed during the interval, even though
he has only removed to the house next door, he
is disqualified. He may, since his removal,
have got on to a new ratepayers’ roll for his
new residence, but that doesn’t count ; he must
occupy the same premises which he held when
the old roll was made up, or he can’t vote.
Consequently, the qualification for a Victorian
elector now is somewhat as follows : He
must be a natural - born or naturalised
British subject, out of gaol, in his right mind,
and not convicted of any serious crime. He
must have lived for about two years in one
house. He must have been properly registered
on the ratepayers’ roll when he entered that
house. When the officer came round to make
up the electoral roll he must have been at home,
and able to prove his identity, and his name
must have been accurately copied from one roll
to the other. If he has been objected to by any
meddlesome person, and a notice to that effect
has been sent him, and it happens to have been
delivered—which it often isn’t, and the notice
calls on him to appear at some place and time
not clearly stated, before some court not speci-
fied, and prove that the objection, the nature
of which isn’t even mentioned, is unfounded—
that being the regular process now in Vic-
toria, and he succeeds in finding out
when and where he is to appear, and loses
one or two days’ work in attending the
court’s convenience, he must then be able to
prove that the objection—the nature of which
he doesn’t know so that he can bring no evi-
dence to confute it—is unsound. Then he
must take his chance of having his name
omitted by accident after all. And if he
succeeds in escaping all these snares and pit-
falls, and the authorised functionary doesn’t
refuse him his electoral right at the last moment
for no visible reason whatever, then he becomes
a full-blown elector of the province of Victoria.
To become a Victorian voter nowadays is about
as simple a process as catching an echo by the
tail or setting fire to a cataract.
Tariff Comedy.
A certain amount of comedy attaches even to
the serious-minded Victorian Tariff Commis-
sion. The Commission itself is a profoundly
sedate affair, but many of its witnesses belong
to the giddy order of unintentional humorists.
Hie humor lies mostly in their blank and awful
ignorance, which is, presumably, only a fair
specimen of the blank and awful ignorance of
the community. On second thoughts, however,
it is probably not a fair specimen; the illiterate
testifiers before the Board are mostly trained
experts who apparently don’t know; the simplest
matters affecting their own business, and when
an expert doesn’t know' even his own business
a person who isn’t an expert can’t be rea-
sonably expected to know anything. Among
recent witnesses, one of the most eloquent
was an importer named David Altson, who had
been ruined by that Protectionist iniquity,
the stock-tax. This duty had struck his
business such a blow that his wage-sheet
declined straight off from £BOOO to £3OOO per
annum. Therefore he wanted the stock-tax
taken off at once. When he had quite exhausted
himself it was pointed out that, according to
his own books, the collapse of his business took
place years before the stock-tax was put on,
and that his trade revived again when that
duty came along. The astonished witness then
retired in confusion. Another man came for-
ward and swore that his industry was ruined by
the wholesale importation of saddle-trees, and
unless the inrush of these articles could be
stopped, he would be utterly lost or there-
abouts. The Commission then looked up the
Customs returns, and found that last year
exactly 48 saddle-trees were imported into Vic-
toria, and 12 of these were re-exported, leaving
only 30 in the country. This witness then
apologised in great bewilderment and dispersed.
Some other witnesses—quite a stream of them,
in fact—declared that they were much injured
by the heavy duty levied on reapers and
binders, which made the prices so high as to be
almost prohibitive, and when these persons
were informed that there was no duty whatever
on reapers and binders, and that the high price
was the work of a Freetrade importing ring,
they were petrified with astonishment, and
remarked that they had been “ misled.” Also,
various people, at different times, complained
bitterly of the iniquitous duty charged on
certain dairy implements, and when they learned
that the articles in question came in free, they
also went home in a badly broken-up condition.
Considering that these are samples of the people
who come forward to shed a light on the tariff
question, it is interesting to speculate on the
possible state of the people who stay away
because they don’t feel sufficiently intelligent
to tackle that intricate subject. This opens up
such vast possibilities of illiteracy, that the
subject had better be dropped just here in
despair.
The 15-Man Cabinet.
Wm. M'Oulloch, M.L.C., is to be the new
Victorian Minister of Defence, vice the bump-
tious and belligerent Sargood. M'Culloch is
chiefly notable because it is commonly sup-
posed that he isn’t any stupider than his
colleague, Cornelius Job Ham, but otherwise
there is nothing in particular to distinguish
him from other men. In other provinces the
dullest nonentity of the Cabinet is made Post-
master-General ; in Victoria the biggest and
most unpleasant nonentity is made Minister of
Defence, and the next one is appointed P. M.G.
Victoria, by the way, is the only Australian
province which keeps a Minister of Defence,
and the only one which keeps a Minister
of Water Supply. Australian Ministries are
things of infinite variety. There are only
eight separate billets in the W.A. Cabinet.
There are 13 separate portfolios in the New
South Wales Ministry; in the Queensland
Ministry, 11; South Australian, 9; Victorian, 18.
There are sometimes as many as 15 men in a
Victorian Cabinet, while S.A. gets through
with six, Queensland with seven, and New
South Wales with ten. In addition to the
ordinary members of a Cabinet, the Vic.
Government includes, as already mentioned, a
Minister of Defence and a Minister of Water
Supply; also a Solicitor-General, a Commis-
sioner of Trades and Customs, a Minister of
Health, a President of the Board of Land and
Works, a Vice-President of the same, and a
Minister of Agriculture. Also, it sometimes
includes as many as four supernumerary Minis-
ters without salary or portfolio, who take
office for the pleasure of printing “ The
Hon. John Smith,” in big letters, on
their portmanteaux when they go travelling.
Victoria will never get properly started at the
work of retrenchment until it abolishes the
Minister of Defence and the Solicitor-General,
and ejects from the Cabinet the Minister for
Water Supply, and the Vice-President of the
Board of Land and W orks, and the Postmaster-
General, and all the supernumerary Ministers,
and gets the Cabinet down to a plain working
basis.
Mr. Saul Joshua, Melbourne distiller, simplv
dances on the Freetrade allegation that local
spirit manufacture is unduly subsidised by the
concession of 4s. per gallon in excise duty.
Victorian whisky yields ,£50,000 per annum less
in revenue tax than the same quantity of im-
ported ditto would pay. “But,” says Mr.
Joshua, “ the manufacture of beer in Victoria
for 1893 was over twelve million gallons. The
amount of money ‘ lost to the revenue ’ by not
charging this with the same duty as if it had
been imported was .£450,000 for one year.”
Apart from the absurdity of making “revenue”
a first consideration in the fearfully and wonder-
fully complicated question of liquor, there is
the Freetrade fallacy that Victoria has been
“losing money” by Joshua Bros, for years
past. As a matter of fact, the duty paid upon
native spirit to-day is Is. per gallon more than
the duty on the imported article in 1884. If it
were ss. a gallon less—what then ? A com-
munity is always prepared to expend its full
amount of available drinking money. The fact
that Victoria loses £50,000 a year by not taxing
local spirits ss. a gallon more, is merely on a
par with the equally obvious fact that the
province loses £1,400,000 a year by not trebling
the spirit-duty all round, and that it loses
£7,000,000 a year by not increasing it ten-fold.
Also, we are brought face to face with the
dreadful fact that it loses £21,000,000 a year
by not increasing it thirty-fold. The cost
of alcoholic liquor to the consumer is mainly
the amount of tax charged upon it. The
country can, and will, pay all the tax it can
afford, taking one year with another, and no
unnatural raising of the tariff, or tinkering with
differential duties, will make the blessed revenue
much richer or poorer. Whether the welfare
of the country’s stomach may be affected by
injudicious legislation is the question that no
Government ever gives a thought to.
Sydney Daily Telegraph points out that the
fact that J.P.-ships “should be the reward of
electioneering service, as they undoubtedly are,
• • • . is a satire upon the laws which
these political ‘justices’ have to administer.”
But that is a feeble satire compared to the
heavier fact that the Attorney-General, who is
also a grand jury of N.S. Wales, or Victoria, or
Queensland, as the case may be, holds his office,
from which all active “ justice ” (so-called) may
be said to flow, merely as a political reward,
and frequently because of a political neces-
sity. There is nothing to prevent, but every-
thing to encourage, Beelzebub, Q.C., and
Lucifer, Q.C., holding this legal port-
folio alternately. A satire? “Govern-
ment by Contradiction ” is a beehive of satires.
What makes an Attorney-General? His
law? No, his club. What in N.S. Wales
makes a Minister of Mines and Agriculture?
His geological and botanical attainments ? No,
his malleability and ignorance. What makes a
N.S.W. Secretary for Lands? His agrarian
culture? No, his solidity with his constituents
and his fidelity to his party. What makes
a N.S.W. Minister of Justice? His machine-
like and unerring judgment ? Not so. His
ready impressionism and Conservative idolatry
of ancient fetishes of “ the party.” Whalb
makes anything administrative? Blind, un-
questioning, reward-seeking, reward-grabbing
voting power. A satire ? The whole game is a
satire.
At Melbourne, a few days ago, an exceedingly
swell Chinaman, with many diamonds upon
him, was charged with brutally assaulting an
aged European, by driving a big door-key into
his ear and mashing him about the head with
the same weapon. He was fined .£3 and 30s.
costs. The injuries would probably have killed
a man of feeble constitution, in which case the
gaudy Chow would doubtless have been hanged;
as they didn’t prove fatal he was fined 60s,
Australian law is exceedingly particular about
murder, and hangs the murderer with remark-
able punctuality, but almost any brutality short
of murder—anything in the way of blinding a
victim, jumping on his chest and head, staving
in his ribs, ot otherwise making him a cripple
for life—can generally be compromised by a
payment of 60s. or so. That is to say, it can
be so compromised, except under two special
sets of circumstances. The policeman who runs
you in after a murderous assault may put it
down as “assault” only, in which case the
aforesaid 60s. applies ; but, on the other hand,
an especially saturnine constable may get hold
of you after a much less serious shindy and
charge you with “assault with intent to
murder,” and then you are probably rushed off
to the gallows in the shortest time on record.
Or, on the other hand, instead of horribly
mangling a man out of pure cussedness, you
may merely shake him a little and take six-
pence out of his pocket, in which case you pro-
bably get three years and 20 lashes. But if
you take the precaution of kicking the other
man so hard that he doesn’t recover his senses
for a month or two, so that he isn’t aware that
you have taken the sixpence from him, the
proceeding probably costs only 40s. The law
is a curious animal—more curious even than the
bunyip or the ornithorhynchus.
In Sydney, the other day, a lawyer turned up
in a light summer suit to defend a client charged
with a capital offence, whereupon the Judge
promptly adjourned the case for an hour, and
sent him home to put on lugubrious raiment, on
the ground that his butterfly costume was not
“in keeping with the gravity of the charge
against the prisoner,” or something like that.
When the legal person returned in hjs most
sombre “ clobber,” the case proceeded. This
kind of small interference isn’t even amusing,
and, besides, it looks like prejudging the
case. If the prisoner was an innocent
man wrongfully accused, then it was ap-
propriate that he should be represented by a
solicitor dressed in white, and the Judge
couldn’t tell at that stage whether he was
wrongfully accused or not. The average
Judge’s idea that everything connected with
justice should be of a solemn black hue is a
wicked reflection on the law’s murkiness.
Moreover, the Judge himself, The Bulletin
has reason to believe, wears white underclothing
and a pale boiled shirt, and these things are not
in keeping with his own theories. Moreover,
the same Judge goes to see pallid ghosts at
spook-materialising meetings, which is another
anomaly. Also, the Bench is incongruous in
other ways. Some day when a red-headed
Judge sits on the Bench to hear a capital case,
some barrister will object on the ground that
his hair isn’t suited to the solemnity of the
occasion. Then there will be trouble.
The Sydney Telegraph, which, in matters of
arithmetic, may fairly claim to be the stupidest
paper in Australasia, last Saturday published
in its leader columns a shriek entitled “How
Protectionist Duties are Paid ” :
A clear explanation of how Protectionist duties grow in
the process of reaching the consumer of dutiable goods
was given by Mr. Martin, M.P., in an address delivered
at Enfield last night. He took £lOO worth of goods and a
10 per cent, tax as his basis. The Government, he said,
reckoned that £lOO worth of goods increased in value by
10 per cent, on their arrival in the harbor. Duty had,
therefore, to be placed on £llO, which made the tax 11
percent. The importer who had money invested in the
duty charged interest on this, at the bank rate of, say,
7 per cent. As no merchant calculated to a fraction
of 1 per cent, the cost of an article on which
duty was paid was usually based on the maximum rather
than the minimum. Mr. Martin gave it as his opinion
that the average merchant’s advance in advalorem goods
which had paid 10 per cent, was never less than 15 per
cent., more often 17£ per cent., and sometimes 20 per
cent. The retailer having paid this extra price must get
an additional price when he sold again. This was usually
another 5 per cent., and the 10 per cent, was thus
augmented to 22J per cent, or 25 per cent, between the
Custom-house and the consumer. A large part of the 11
percent, which the State obtained was swallowed up in
salaries, &0., paid to Customs officials, so that while the
consumer paid, say, 25 per cent., the Government re-
ceived considerably less than the original 11 per cent.
The Bulletin now invites the badly-deranged
organ to do its own calculation over again.
Assuming the paper’s own figures to be correct,
which is immensely improbable, the result pans
out thus : Duty, £11; 20 per cent, on £ll, said
to be added by the merchant, £2 45.; 5 per
cent, on £l3 45., said to be added by the
retailer, 13s. 3d. Total, less than 14 per cent,
by the Telegraph’s own figures, taken on the
highest scale, instead of 25 per cent., as
alleged. The cost of collection, by the way, is
7d. in the £, the Customs being, without excep-
tion, the cheapest of all the important taxes to
collect. Why doesn’t the great Freetrade
organ hire someone who understands ordinary
compound addition to check its figures?
Prince Joseph of Battenberg has arrived

that The Bulletin is quite glad to know that the
young man’s name is Joseph.
A grim Queensland suicide : At the 1 ar of
a shanty stood a traveller, who said to the woman
■who served him : “ Have you any message for St.
Peter?” “No,” was the reply. “If you hal I
would have taken it,” said the man, tossing off a
draught of prussic acid, which killed him in-
stantly.

My DeabMoorabinda—
Messieurs B. and B. seem bent on giving us
anachronisms, Rosamond, in Regency cos-
tume, couldn’t be caught with even the finest
chaff, but in “The Sportsman,” Mrs. Briscoe,
who is presumably right up to date, is deceived
by the very flimsiest excuses that ever insulted the
mental capacity of a young married lady. Women
must be retrograding, from a playwright’s point
of view, or else Mrs. Briscoe surely would have
worn the sandals, instead of Helen Gray’s logical
daughter. The long-tailed portion of Mrs.
Brough’s wardrobe would seem to be taking a
rest lately. In “The Sportsman,” a couple of
cotton frocks were the only wear, and in “The
Open Gate” (a bit of sentiment only poetically
possible in a neighborhood where nobody kept a
goat), a plain, though artful, grey gown (grey-
liaired woihen look their best in grey—they be-
come studies in silver then) was Mrs. B’s. attire.
Grace Noble, garbed in the dusty lines of atom-
tit, wasn’t a gay spot on the landscape, which
didn’t brighten excessively even when the long-
lost Titheradge turned up in what looked like a
deeply-dyed moustache.
As for the grooming of the men in the after-
piece, Mr. Dorrington, who paims himself like
scarlet fever or aggravated frostbite, and always
reminds me of a bonnet-pin—he has such a very
small round head on such a long body—certainly
wore the prettiest clothes. But the blades look in
vain for the last word of he-fashion from the B.
and B. young men, now that Percy Lyndal has
departed. Lyndal’s raiment was always fearfully
and wonderfully constructed. He introduced
baggy evening breeches, with a silk stripe at the
outer seams, and it was he who first wore a short
dress-coat, to the rage and envy of one of the
“ walking gentlemen,” who heard vague rumors
beforehand of this wondrous garment and deter-
mined to go one better. So he gave elaborate
orders to his tailor to make him a bob-tail, and,
when the eventful evening came, out popped
Lyndal on to the stage in the bang-tail jacket so
many fat men have since adopted, regardless of
the possible back view, and out came his rival
wearing one of black velvet. Lyndal’s triumph
was complete. “Nice smoking coat, old man,”
he said, enthusiastically. And yet men laugh at
women because of their dress rivalries.
Poor Governor Duff hasn’t found Tasmania as
healthy as most people seem to do, for he has been
“ taken ” with what one Sydney daily calls “ colic,”
andj another congestion of the liver. In horsey
parlance. Gov. Duff has shown colicky symptoms
ever since he landed in Australia, and, perhaps,
now the attack has come to the surface, His Ex.
will return to his loving subjects feeling a great
deal better. The attendant doctor attributes the
attack to a draught—not one of the doctor’s own
draughts, but the kind of thing that blows through
a window and is no respector of persons. All men
are equal when they sit in a draught. Likewise,
all men are equal after a Masonic banquet, and it
was after a Masonic banquet that the laird of
Fetteresso first fell ill. He puts it down to the
fruit.
Admiral Bridge (please do not forget that his
front name is Cyprian !) and his good-looking
suite got to Hobart in time for the Governor’s
ball, to the delight of Tasmanian belledotn. I
believe the hop was exceptionally fizzy —so
much so that one or two society belles are
alleged to have thrown such spirits into their
engagements that the golden-haired Lady Gor-
Ladies and gentlemen, remember that to
prevent a cold is much better than to cure it, and
by using the sanitary toilet requisite, “ Amykos,”
according to the advices on the circular wrapped

guard yourself against a eold, but find what a plea-
sant and refreshing taste Amykos has compared

continent it is universally used by all who esteem

mansion (who, despite her coquettish appearance,
is said to pose as a reformer, and means to leave
Tasmanian society more clear-headed than she
found it) has struck their names off the book while
she is in office. This will nob make Govmentouse
wildly popular, and if Lady G. doesn’t try to
please the case is hopeless, for Gov. Gormanston
never will. In the first place, he has committed
the deadly sin of refusing his subscriptions to
sports of any kind ; therefore clean-shaved men
with bow-legs eye liim critically, and all the
hairy sporting pack refuse to yelp rapturously
when His Ex. lunges across the horizon. No
wonder he gets such piebald receptions.
One thing the federating Premiers did in Tas-
mania was to visit Port Arthur, where the blood-
curdling stories come from, and the feature of the
picnic outing was that the feminine odds were as
five to one aboard the Oonah. Premiers Reid and
Kingston (a large man, of the flovver-in-the-button-
hole variety) are alleged to have been most atten-
tive to the ladies on the trip. Mr. Kingston wore
white, I am told, in whicli lie must have resembled
a whitewashed wall, and in which he turned so
cold later on that he finished the day in a nest of
women’s wraps, and was, therefore, the pet of the
party. Women only really begin to love a man
when he sits with their shawls on while they pre-
tend its a balmy afternoon. It seems that our
own Georgey Porgey, in a straw hat, was a spec-
tacular disappointment to the Tasmaniennes, who
thought it was a joke at first when somebody
showed them the Premier of N.S.W. Parkes
really should have been there to hear the remarks
about it. “What! that monstrous little puff-ball
of a man !” said one of ’em, quoting Meredith.
In the gardens of the model prison the distin-
guished guests caught sight of the fruit-trees, and
a rush ensued, though I don’t think I would
fancy fruit grown in that dismal soil. The
Bananaland Attorney-General was given a leg-up
a peach-tree by Premier Forrest, while ex-Premier
Patterson shook the plums off another, and Reid,
Nelson and Go. picked them up. But what an
allegorical scene it must have made? One politi-
cian shaking down fat plums, after which his
brother politician went grovelling on hands and
knees, while another man helped his political
friend to get to the top of the tree. ’Twas a
regular Tableau Yivant.
I am in receipt of two songs. One, “Love’s
Last Appeal,” by Aug. W. Juncker, the composer
of “I was Dreaming,” is well within the vocal
powers of any mezzo soprano who can hold her
breath for three bars without exploding, and the
melody has quaintly caught the true spirit of the
prettily amorous words. Flo. Esdaile sang it in
the pantomime at Her Majesty’s, where it always
met with success. The other song is a football
ditty called “Crom-a-boo” (why not “Scrum-a-
boo ”?) and deals with the plaster-of-Paris aspect
of that merry game. It is not a drawing-room
song, but anywhere in the opera with a strong
chorus “ Crom-a-boo ” might have a terrific
success.
If the Law piles much more clothing on to
itself it will become necessary for the “great”
dailies to send special frock-reporters to
the Courts when these places of public
amusement resume busings after vacation.
At the opening of N.S.W, Banco Court
last week, for instance, when women crowded
the court attired in bright array, nobody
had eyes for anybody but the Judges in their
royal red robes picked out with rabbit-skins—
which always remind me of flayed sheep with
part of the wool sticking on, and a dazzled law-
reporter drew public attention next day to the
fact that “Mr. Justice Owen wore the finest gown
of all.” But it’s an odd thing that the Adminis-
trators of the Law should make such gaudy spec-
tacles of themselves, considering that Justice
herself is always depicted witli so little on ! I
suppose they do it to keep distinct. Sometimes
when a Judge has a very square mouth and a
bullet head, I suppose the beads and wampum are
necessary to prevent Policeman X making awk-
ward mistakes.
The lion is almost in the path, and yet I haven’t
heard of any special orders for Chinese lanterns.
H.R.H. Prince Joseph of Battenberg arrived per
Rome, yet nobody official seems agitated. When
your Governor is down with the stomach-ache,
your Admiral is absent, and your Mr. Mayor
isn’t quite broken to the collar, it seems to me
that a distinguished visitor stands a very fair
chance of getting a little amusem -nt out of his
trip round the kawliaies. Darling Point won’t
let the poor Prince feel bored, at any rate. When
the Duke of E linburgh was here (only, mind you,
I wasn’t born then), he was stopping the night at
a big-wig’s house, and laying abed in the morning
beheld the door swing open, and his host’s pretty,
dashing daughter tumbled into the room and then
rushed out again. She had been skylarking outside
the door with some girls and “they” pushed her,
so she said.
I hope somebody will give Prince Battenberg a
few tips as to his behavior in Australia. He
should always remember to leave bis sacred brush
full of hair when he’s spending the night any-
where, so that adormg women can make true-
lovers’ knots of his German locks, and keep them
for ever and ever until the next prince comes
along. His shaving-lather should never be care-
lessly thrown away, and any old boots, false teeth
an 1 hollow pill-boxes should always be left in con-
spicuous positions, for their price is far above
rubies. To be really popular a prince must leave
as much flotsam and jetsam behind him as if he
were a new reading of the “ B ibes in the Wood ”
and wanted to find his way back by ’em.
The very oddest things happen to people in
Australia, For instance, a Westralian lawyer
travelled up the coast a long way the other day
to look after an important case for a Japanese
client, who, on his arrival, offered him hospitality.
When the lawyer was about to retire for the night
guess his astonishment on finding a pretty little
Yum Yum curled up in his couch ! He indig-
nately fired her out, but on rising in the morning
he found another and still prettier Mdlle. Chrysan-
themum under the aforesaid couch. If this sort
of thing catches on no timid old bachelor would
dream of retiring without looking for the woman
under the bed !
What with one thing and another, I always
looked upon ex-Premier Parkes as a kind of tin-
pot Australian edition of Solomon in his know-
ledge of the female character—but after his speech
in a country town I mun h.ie ma doots, as
Governor Duff’s ancestors probably used to say.
“As sure as truth was truth” (though I don’t
see what a politician knows about that) “women
would have votes, and the inclusion of women
would make the election record- sounder, wiser,
and more truthful.” These are the sort of
speeches which, though flattering on trie surface to
a man’s petticoated connections, do not impress
anybody but the author of them—and not even
him sometimes. For myself, I always think of a
man who appears to be full of such solemn convic-
tion that if he let his reason prevail he would hand
his business affairs over to his grandmother and
take to knitting stockings himself, I always
wonderjust howlivelyaXantippesuoh orators have
at their elbows? No man unappalled by the glare of
cold grey eye across the coffee-pot ever advocates
the cause of the he-woman or romances about the
Parliamentary purification which must follow on
when she drops her ballot-paper in the slot.
In this stage of advanced woman, when my
dear sisters show every sign of a wild longing to
wear trousers, it is genuinely refreshing to read of
that Melb. law-suit when Mrs. Daih sued Mrs.
Blank for the recovery of a petticoat. It chanced
that Mrs. Dash was at some open-air festivity,
and Mrs. Blank was there too. All at once a
zephyr that was doubtless a whisper from a
lawyer, agitated Mrs. Blank’s draperies, and the
underskirt which Mrs. Dash claimed as hers came
to view. Mrs. Blank was accused of “snow-
dropping,” but a wise Judge decided that she was
not guilty and the case was dismissed. For my
part, I wish she had stolen it. Such a truly
feminine longing for the garment the Enlightened
of her sex show symptoms of doing away with,
that she must needs “nip” it off a clothes-line
would be a promising development, it seems to
me.
The cycling woman—whom even the ’bus horses
shy at as she jig-jags over the loose metal, with
her skirts hanging like a couple of chaff-bags, and
her body bent over the steering-gear as if she was
in training for a hunchback—the cycling woman
has at least encompassed us. Ladies’ cycling
clubs are established in Sydney and Melbourne—
the Sydney collection being captained by Mrs.
Maddocks, the lady who wheeled to Melbourne,
but whom the doctor sent back by steamboat;
while Mrs. Brentnall, pioneer wheelwoman of
Victoria, is to be high priestess of the Melbourne
club, which gives its tyrst run next month.
I saw one lady—she looked like a monkey on
a grindstone—wheeling for dear life on the South
Head road, the other day, and as the horse I was
driving fairly danced with horror at the spectacle
I couldn’t help wondering how the landscape will
look when it is peppered with cycle-ladies, with
yellowish or snow-white faces and hollow eyes,
straining up the hills or coining flying down them
with their Australian feet twined lovingly over
the handle in the masculine style? Now that
ladies’ clubs have started the situation is hopeless.
Women, larrikins, and dingoes all feel courageous
only when running in a p ick, and the establish-
ment of clubs will pub grit into every backward
wheelwoman who has hitherto restricted her
prowess to garden paths. Knickerbockers come
next—though why, in these hard times, a woman
should exhibit her legs for nothing when theatre-
managers pay salaries for the very same thing, is
a puzzles to
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING VVRRK.

Theatre Royal “Tae Union Jack."
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “Cinderella.”
Bi.iou “A Wife’s Ordeal.”

The new double bill ab Sydney Lyceum
does not promiss to catch on quite so brilliantly
as did its predecessor, and a judicious manage*
nient announces that it will run for one week only.
Toe fault lies chiefly with the bulkier item of the
programme, the “Open Gate,” by Haddou Cham-
bers, being a sufficient y pleasant and poetic trifle.
It concerns a maiden lady who quarrelled with her
lover and sent him away, and then, repenting, left
the gate open as a mute invitation to come back.
The gate stands open as a silent appeal for 20
years before lie returns. On the night of his re-
appearance his nephew and his lost love’s niece
have quarrelled in exactly the same fashion, and
as the finale the two lovers both come through the
open gate and make it up. The gate then closes
and remains shut ever afterwards. Miss Noble,
Mrs. Brough, Titheradge and Dorrington fill the
four characters, and the gate appears personally,
and the whole thing goes off to the satisfaction of
everybody.

The “ Sportsman ” is chiefly notable
because it calls up memories of “ Pink Dominoes ”
and the “Magistrate,” without being quite so
ingenious as either of them. It belongs to that
order of comedy in which a flippant husband goes
forth on the burst, leaving behind him a lying
tale, to the effect that he has gone to see his friend
Perkins ; and his wife, hearing of his wickedness,
goes out to tell her woes to an old friend ; and
they both get into the same house. Which pain-
ful coincidence causes the premises to become full
of compromised ladies hiding behind doors, and
anguishe 1 female voices calling for help, and being
implored through the keyhole to keep quiet or
they will ruin everything, and belated gentlemen
wandering round town in cabs and borrowed hats,
and a dreadful state of mind, and not daring to
go home. The compromised female hiding in
the next room is an item which this paper vaguely
recollects having seen before, and nothing is alto-
gether novel, except four putrid fowls —produced
as evidences of the sportsman’s exploits—which
are smelt by all the characters in turn, and re-
jected with a shudder. The “Sportsman” is
< musing enough, in a certain invertebrate fashion,
b it it suffers from a lack of material, and there is
a cei tain gradual ness about it, which is a serious
disadvantage. The company seems to feel this
a good deal, and has a somewhat martyred
expression in places. Mrs, Brough does not
play her part with her wonted enthusiasm. Miss
Rom°r gives an excellent representation of a land-
lady who has seen better days, but there is very
little of the landlady—not nearly enough to give
the piece the lift it badly requires. Messrs. Ward
and Brough do nearly everything that two rather
sketchy characters permit, and Mr. Clitherow is
about the best sample of a doddering old gentle-
man with something on his mind that The Bulle-
tin has seen for a year past. Yet, despite every-
thing that is done or left undone, about the most
original feature in the “ Sportsman ” is the
fact that it will be succeeded next Saturday by
“Aunt Jack,” with Bouoicault in the cast. The
news that it is to be succeeded by anything with
Boucicault in the cast is enough to mak“ anything
gu.
** * *
Concerning the “Union Jack,” at Sydney
Royal, The Bulletin rises to acknowledge that it
last week did that play an injustice.. There is
very little about the Union Jack in it, and it
doesn’t drivel so oppressively about that vene-
rated flag as might be expected. It is an ordinary
and respectable melodrama, in which Miss Agnes
Knights is betrayed by a gaudy rake in the parson
of Albert Norman, and thereupon beseeches him
to make her an “ honest woman. ” Norman isn’t
honest himself, and the idea of making anyone
else honest strikes linn as amusing. Bikei comes
home from sea about this time and -Irikes him
also. Two exceedingly nice girls in pretty frocks
—Misses Hilda Spong and Virgie Vivienne—roam
through the drama, each with a ghoul in pursuit
of her. Miss Kuights, looking for a quiet place to
weep and think about her honor, gets into the
wrong man’s rooms and brings unjust suspicion
upon the beauteous Inman, and there are
several chaste and elegant free fights, and Baker
is court-martialled, and is vaguely understood to
be sentenced to be fatally reprimanded, and then
executed for seven years, with hard labor, and dis-
missed from the service. He escapes through a
window, and so does Miss Spong, and Norman is
joyfully disembowelled by Cosgrove, and Miss
Vivienne is imprisoned in a lonely house beside a
moaning river somewhere, and then everything
comes right with a bang in the fourth act, and
everybody embraces everybody else. Even Cos-
grove isn’t left out, for he is seen being embraced
by two policemen in the background.
* # •
The piece is lavishly mounted, and played
by an excellent company, and is altogether a
moral spectacle of considerable merit. Misses
Hilda Spong and Virgie Vivienne, as two orphan
sisters, are an exceedingly pretty pair, and the
latter’s orphan is decidedly the best thing she has
yet done to The Bulletin’s knowledge. Also, it
is quite equal to the best things which many other
actresses have done. Baker, as the person who
comes home from sea and strikes Norman, is a
fine character, and Bland Holt is eminently
pleasing. Mrs. Bland, Miss Knights and the two
villains are satisfactory, and except for a certain
highly moral but ineffective young man in the army
there is no one on whom the haggard talon of
aspersion can reasonably be laid. Even to him
the only serious objection is that he doesn’t look
very striking as himself, and probably wouldn’t
amount to much as anybody else.
** * *
The new bill at Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
consists of that dear old salt-horse drama, “Black
Eyed Susan,” and a burlesque thereon which it
better than the original. All the same, The Bul-
letin has serious doubts about the success of the
experiment. “ Susan ” belongs to the harrowing
type of drama in which a noble but impossible
sailor shivers his timbers and dashes his tarry top-
lights with dreadful earnestness. The people who
pay for this sort of thing like to be harrowed and
want to keep harrowed as long as possible, and to
the person who can take the “Susan ” variety of
drama seriously Bert Royle’s wild, weird parodj
looks like some kind of an outrage. It is vaguelj
suggestive of “ East Lynne ” finishing up with a
skirt-dance by the consumptive Isabel, or little Eva
doingacomic song after death. Still, the large class
which appreciates “Black-Eyed Susan” is so un-
accountable that no one can say for certain what
it will do under any given circumstances. The
drama is the same solid, moral drama as afore-
time, and the burlesque is a bright entertainment
which holds the touching story of Sailor Bill up to
ridicule in a joyous, irresponsible sort of fashion.
There is much elegant ballet in it, and a large

“ Jimmy ” M‘Mahon’s V Haunted Swing ”
got in motion on Saturday, and lias been coining
money ever since. It is a pleasant little illusion,
which isn’t calculated to excite any ill-feeling or
to shook anybody’s modesty, and after the visitor
has been swung round several times and has dis-
covered that she—the most excited visitor is
always a she—can revolve in a series of somersaults
without her hat falling off or her skirts becoming
disarranged, the motion is rather comforting than
otherwise. For a sorrowing widow, or a maiden
with a lacerated heart, the swing can be recom-
mended as a form of mild and soothing consola-
tion, and all bereaved relatives ought to try it.

The Tivoli continues to be about the best-
patronised house in Sydney, and Rickards is now
coining money with two shows at once. The
Sakers have caught on; Messrs. Irving Sayles,
Faning, Pope and other “ cullud pussons ” have
got a solid hold on the public ; and the Japanese
jugglers are a thing of mystery and a darksome
conundrum for evermore. These individuals from
the laud of the painted fan are marvellously clever
in their art, and set the recognised laws of gravi-
tation at defiance. The Bulletin, as a paper
which has always comidered gravitation an over-
rated institution, cordially approves of them
accordingly.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback- the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous us© of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats,
Woodloch’s Circus has started on a tour of
the Sydney suburbs. The three last days of the
present week are to be filled at Parramatta. The
show makes a one-night stand at Burwood on
Monday, and at Entnore on Tuesday. Wednes-
day and Thursday are to be devoted to the pre-
cipitous regions of North Shore, and Balmain will
be exploited on Friday and Saturday.

Melbourne sassiety mustered in some force
at the Bijou on Saturday, otherwise the Dacres
would have suffered a disheartening first appear-
ance in Australia. A crowded house was not a
reasonable possibility. Most people objected to
going anywhere to look at anything save a long
drink, but those who had booked dress-circle seats
came along and formed the baokbone of a demon-
stration which was almost as warm as the weather.
Umler normal conditions “ A Wife’s Ordeal,” by
G. R. Sims, will seem rather sultry. It is the
story of a virtuous woman’s desperate expedient for
saving her husband from ruin* He is a weak, uncori-
vincing embezzler, but his wife kisses the top of bis
bowed head and waters the parting with her tears
when the crash comes, and determines to pull the
poor devil through at any cost. For she had seen
him —off the stage —with a pistol pointed at his
heart. Previous to this a chartered libertine, a
recognised invader of domestic peace, essayed to
add the strong-minded matron to his list of con-
quests, but failed miserably. In the hour of
trouble he happens to try again, and the lady
hints at a surrender. He looks for no explanation
of this strange inconsistency, being a languid
millionaire sentimentalist with a wide experience
of the other sex, as he supposes. Of course he
doesn’t know he is being dealt with by a devoted
wife who must raise £5OOO within a week.
• • »
Unhappy Mrs. Branscombe has one
humorous chance of getting the coveted sum by
respectable means. Her father, a broken-down
gambler and military gent, is allowed to rush
off to Monte Carlo, taking £3OO in cash, the
savings of her unmarried sister (father and sister
live with her), in order to break the bank. The
Colonel believes in a new “system” he has dis-
covered, and promises to return at once with the
proceeds. The bank breaks him. His daughters
telegraph for news of his luck, and he replies :
“Lost everything.” Then the wife assumes a
very black veil, and presents herself at the cham-
bers of Lothario saying, in effect: “ Consider
yourself my lover when you have given me a lot of
money.” He has in his desk a receipt for the
£5OOO he had left in charge of the lady’s husband
at the office of his stookbroking employers—the
financial working of the plot is rather compli-
cated —and she takes the document eagerly.
* « «
Lothario is not a beast of prey. Per-
ceiving that he has bought the lady under dis-
tressing circumstances, he refuses to claim delivery
of the goods, so to speak. The wealthy masher is
glad to pay £5OOO, or more if necessary, for the
pleasure of being magnanimous to a self-sacrificing
woman. Then the husband comes to the cham-
bers to confess to his theft, and explanations
ensue. Also, the artless younger sister comes, on
her own account, to borrow £5OOO from Lothario
and put things straight. He behaves handsomely
all round. He becomes the affianced husband of
this confiding girl, whose married sister he was
pursuing all through the piece, and he is very
severe upon one of the stockbrokers, a shrewd
Scotchman, for having expected to discover the
defalcation aforementioned. The ending is un-
natural but happy. By the way, nobody gives a
thought to the aged parent who didn’t break the
bank at Monte Carlo. He is left on his uppers in
that salubrious principality.
* • ■
“A Wife’s Ordeal ” is a clever counterfeit
of a fine play. Some of the situations are powerful
and possible, whilst the language ranges from
familiar journalese to nervous, stirring English.
Also the seducer’s cynicism is sometimes witty.
The two leading characters are thoughtfully
drawn and coloured ; the minor figures more or
less neatly sketched. The introduction to the plot
is dull and hazy, and the husband excites no sym-
pathy. Frank Cates’ feeble, mechanical perform-
ance of this commonplace person is the play’s
chief misfortune. Wilfrid Shine likewise is-un-
equal to the very short part of thegambling father,
and Miss Mabel Hardy, as a stockbroker’s amiable
lady, seems a weak spot in the cast. Elton plays
a dry, cantankerous Scotchman unobtrusively.
Miss Muriel Carr, the artless sister, is just
a winsome young lady who has the face and
voice of a first-class ingenue, and an evident
disposition to act up to them. A handsome
presence is half the battle with Arthur Dacre, in
his lady-killer capacity. His method of love-
making now, as of yore, is somewhat feminine and
stagey, but he converses on other subjects
most effectively, and is an interesting “swell.”
Miss Amy Roselle (Mrs. Dacre) made a brilliant
success. She is no longer youthful-looking. The
leanness of Frank Oates might have been a serious
drawback to a. less gifted actress of equally
generous outlines, but Miss Roselle soon
brought tears into critical eyes, and there-
after they could see no fault to find with the
impersonation. For the matter of which the wife
in this case is not supposed to be very young, and
Miss Roselle is an attractive woman with a still
shapely figure and fine carriage. If “ A Wife’s
Ordeal ” is to remain long on the Bijou bill it will
be because the genius of the leading artist keeps
it there. No English-speaking actress could play
such a deeply emotional part with more power or
naturalism.

Other Melbourne shows had to contend

Rickards rejoices over his recovery of the boom
which was lost pro tern. Miss Ada Delroy, a

The Savings Bank of N.S. Wales has prospered
reasonably well throughout the past 12 months. During
1894 it has earned in interest over £172,000. It has paid
4 per cent, on all accounts closed during the year, and 5
per cent, to those depositors whose accounts still remain
open. The interest earned on investments averaged £4
18s. 2d. per cent., and the expenses of management are
only Bs. 7Jd. per cent. The deposits have increased by
£280,000 during the year, and the only depressing feature
is that the reserve-fund has decreased by over £7OO. On
a total reserve of £226,000 the amount is very small, still
it is a decrease. A full statement of the funds is
appended, which shows that they are well and carefully
invested.
* • * ♦
It is interesting to note that Victoria, with a
smaller population than N.S. Wales, had, on 31st Dec.,
£6,773,238 in savings bank deposits, against £6,620,092 in
the older province. Also, Victoria has nearly twice as
many depositors.

The authorities of the Commercial Bank of

that the bank would admittedly have difficulty in meeting
its deposits at the fixed dates. The remaiks of Mr. Ser-
vice conveyed that when the deposits fell due the hank
would demonstrably be in so strong a position that
it would he to the advantage of the depositors to renew.
The Bulletin regrets that the remaiks of Mr. Service, as
wired to Sydney, should have been misconstrued.

The Victorian G.P.O. savings bank suspended
payment, the other day, at one of its Melbourne
suburban branches through an unfortunate blunder.
Customers presenting cheques, otherwise P.0.0.’5,
on the Vic. Government were besought to have confi-
dence and call again next day when they would be
paid in full. It seemed that the local tradesmen were
having a sort of semiofficial holiday, and the local
bank (with which the post-office in qmslion ‘fines
its cash business) had joined in the occasion without
giving warning. Thus the usual supply of gold was cut
off, and the Government institution, having no reserve-
fund to draw upon and seemingly no idea of raising the
wind in any unusual manner, confessed itself a “ broker”
for 24 hours.

The British papers are whooping again about
another remarkable rise in consols, which now stand at
104 J. But, in reality, (here is nothing especially remark-
able about it, and by following the same devices N.S. W. or
Victoria could, in the course of a few years, convert all her
public debt into a 3 per cent, stock, mostly held in the
province, and make it boom even at that figure. English
consols have a forced circulation and don’t rest on their
own merits. All the trust-funds held by public depart-
ments are compulsorily invested in them, which absorbs
nearly £120,000,000, and the amount is steadily increasing.
Then trustees, except when otherwise directed under the
old man’s will, are compelled to invest the trust-funds in
consols or one or two other favored securities, and this
absorbs nearly all the rest. The supply of consols is
decreasing, and the rush of compulsory investors is in-
creasing, so that Goschen’s 2| per cents, may easily go to
140 in course of time, instead of merely 104. Just let some
heaven-born financier try a similar experiment in N.S.W.
by passing a law somewhat as follows:—(1) All future
loans, oonver.-ion or otherwise, shall be issued at a maxi-
mum of 3 per cent. (2) All private trust moneys, except
when otherwise directed under the will of the testator,
shall be invested in N.S.W. stock. (3) All public trust
funds shall be similarly invested. (4) All banks doing
business in the province shall invest at least £50,000 in
N.S.W. stock and deposit it with theTreasureras security.
(5) All fire and life assurance offices shall make similar
investments, from £lO,OOO upwards, according to the
business done in the province. A heaven-born financier
of that type could, in a comparatively few years, make
the N.S.W. public debt a purely local concern, and save
£500,000 a year in interest besides.

Brunswick (Melb.) Council has £27,000 of rates
uncollected, £15,000 being very ancient arrears. The
Council is almost bankrupt for want of this money, and
the prospects of getting it seem exceedingly slender.
Almost every municipal body in Australia is more or less
in the same predicament; the writer knows of several
municipalities around Sydney where rates have accumu-
lated for many years on plots of vacant land, the owner-
ship of which is unknown, and seem likely to keep
accumulating. Why shouldn’t a municipality be author-
ised to sell the land when, say, three years’ rates have
accumulated, if the owner can’t be found, or if, being
found, he refuses to pay ? The margin which has to be
allowed for bad debts makes the rate so much the heavier
to those who pay up regularly.

A retired haberdasher has been giving away

of 10 or 15 per cent, in your sales.”

To cope with the enormous and fa«t-growing
evil of illicit distillation, the Sydney authorities propose
at last to trace the liquor from the still to the publican’s
bar. In England, liquor in transit must be accompanied
by a permit, and both sender and receiver must keep a
stock account. Nowhere is the supervision as bad as in
Sydney.

Canvassers go round to women when their husbands are
at work and then bring them into Court to frighten them
into paying. The husbands are not responsible, and the
woman must have a separate estate before judgment can

The Bulletin has just heard of a Queensland
attorney who collected a hundred and three pounds
trust-funds for a widow and gave her a cheque for the
amount postdated seven weeks. Cheque duly dis-
honored. Gent One put on a friendly gent (say Gent
Two) to induce the widow to sue him (Gent One) by writ
for the amount of dishonored cheque only. The verdict
was against the widow, on the pre-arranged defence that
the Stamp Act rendered a cheque post dated a month a
promissory note, and that, as the cheque only bore a
penny stamp, the document was Valueless.
If Australia be really desirous of encouraging

A weak point in the campaign to municipalise

shareholders in the to-operative Ferry Co. The argu-

Manly pier should be banded over to neither of

Mr. Moreton Frewen has erected a Crawford
crushing mill and amalgamator at the works of the
Austral Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne.
The feature of this plant is the exceedingly fine pulverisa-
tion of the materials and their gradual amalgamation.
The process is particularly adapted for ores carrying gold
in a fine state of division, or for what is popularly known
as‘‘float ” gold. It is also anticipated that the process
will find a very successful sphere of work in the treat-
ment of pyritic ores by mechanical amalgamation. Ex-
haustive tests are now being made on a variety of
refractory ores.

Mrs. Hannah Lloyd, Waterworks-square, Solo-
mon Town, Port Pirie, S.A., who writes on June
Bth, 1893 For about seven years I suffered with
heart disease and liver complaint. I was so ill
that I had to go to the Jamestown Hospital.
I was treated in this institution for a considerable
time, but I gained no benefit whatever; I then
consulted various doctors, but I got no better, in
fact,' I was looked upon as incurable. About four
years since, I commenced to use Clements Tonic,
with the result that I soon found I was much
better, and after continuing its use for four weeks
I believed myself quite cured. I sometimes since
have had slight attacks of pain and palpitation
in the region of the heart, when I immediately
take a dose of Clements Tonic, and am at once
relieved from suffering. In conclusion lam most
happy to state that I am in far better,health now
than ever I was since childhood. You are at
liberty to use this statement as you will. —Yours
gratefully, Hannah Lloyd, Waterworks-square,

MEDICAL ADVICE TO JOCKEYS.
A former crack jockey, who has grown so stout
that he had to give up riding, met the winner of
the Melbourne Cup. “ Jim,” he asked, “ how do
you manage to keep so thin? ” “I used to be as
fat as you are now,” was Jim’s answer, “but I
consulted Dr. Macnoodle, did not eat anything
rich, drank no beer, smoked only Frossard’s
Oavour cigars, and you see the result.” “ Well,”
said poor fat Charley, “I was once,as thin as’a
lamp-post. I went to Dr. Macnoodle, dlcJ not eat
anything rich, drank no beer, smoked only
Frossard’s Cavpur cigars, and—l weigh 15st.”
They discovered that what was right for one was
wrong for the othen, but they both agreedMhat a
mild, fragrant Cavonr cigar at eight Ur one shil-
ling is the best smoke one can get for the money.

Demise : Ex-Judge Trench, Ballarat, age
83. A frail and feeble wisp he was, a lengthy
reed, shaken by the wind, while Aspinall, Ireland,
Dawson, Fellows, Stephen, Webb, Bunny, Bin-
don, Atkins, and the rest, were in full bloom, but
he would diet himself on a strawberry a day, if
needful. Such men take birdlike sips of very dry
champagne, or old sherry, but won’t make granu-
lated Jenolan Caves of their stomachs. The
lordly Trench was a quaint spectacle as a demo-
crat, lending Berry a hand in Cabinet-making,
but, like Hori Grey, he had sound democratic ideas.
So impressed was he with the wrong-doing of judi-
cial sentences, that he published a little book on
the subject, and helped to launch the present sim-
mering for sentences to be decided by the juries,
as in America. Mining law was Trench’s forte,
and Ballarat his locale. He had a pull at all those
famous eases of the Hand and Band, Band of
Hope, Kohinoor, Sir William Don, Inkerman,
and what not, which afforded so much pabulum
for Judge Molesworth, with his sniffings, and
spider-crawls of the ink, out of the bottle, in his
familiar hieroglyphic judgments, on small, square
blue foolscap sheets tied with blue ribbon.
Thomas Joseph Byrnes, Attorney-General
of Queensland, who, at the Federal Council, moved
that Queen Victoria be prayed to promote an
Australian Judge to the Privy Council, was born
at Brisbane in Nov., 1860, and is, therefore, not
yet 35 years of age. His early political success
shows what the conjunction of luok, pluck and
ability may do for a man—ability being, in Byrnes’
case, the least of the three factors of fortune, for
his talent is of the plodding; nob the brilliant
order. He started his career on a low rung of the
social ladder, and the Q. Labor press, with bad
logic and less taste, still jibes him because as a
boy he used to carry round milk to the family
customers at Bowen. His father died when he
was still young, and Thomas Joseph owes the
foundation of his fame to his recently-deceased
mother, who spared no sacrifice to give her boy a
good start in life. He was educated at Bowen
State school and the Brisbane Grammar School,
and—always working persistently—took a State

scholarship to Melb. University, where he got his
degree and was called to the Bar in ’B4. Re-
turning to Brisbane he studied for a year with
Pat Rea], and then commenced practice under
the patronage of Griffith. He did well from
the beginning; and, later, took up the Catholic
connection which Pat Real dropped on his eleva-
tion to the Bench. His religion has always been
Byrnes’ best friend; and it was as a representative
of the Catholics that Griffith took him into his
infamous Coalition Cabinet in ’9O, as Solicitor-
General. In that year lay for Thomas Joseph
Byrnes the parting of the political ways. He is a
Democrat by instinct and conviction ; and he had
to choose whether he would henceforth nurse his
democratic opinions in obscurity, or whether he
would bow the knee to Baal as so many better
men have done. He preferred Fat Man’s cash to
the long-deferred credit of Democracy, and filled
his purse while he killed his political reputation.
He had the distinction of drawing the largest fees
paid to counsel in the notorious Robb arbitration
case; after, presumably,, as Solicitor-General, agree-
ing on behalf of the Crown to the amount to be
marked on his own brief as barrister. When
Sam Griffith became Chief Justice, after
consenting as Premier to the passage of an
Act which increased the Chief Justice’s salary
by .£lOOO a year, Thomas Joseph Byrnes was
made Attorney-General. At the ’93 election he
exchanged his Legislative Council seat for a seat

constituency under the thumb of W. H. Swallow,
of Hambledon sugar plantation, who pulls busi-
ness and Masonic strings and generally runs the
township. Byrnes wanted a seat; Swallow
wanted a man who was safe on the Separation and
black-labor questions. Byrnes readily agreed to
what was required of him, and the thing was
done. The Labor-party put forward a man of no
particular account, and Byrnes had an easy
victory. Since then Thomas Joseph has enjoyed
a very good time; and, as it is now too late for
recanting, The Bulletin expects him, primed by
the craftier Griffith, to develop into a very con-
siderable obstacle to Australian National progress.

T. P. Jenkins.
Though disguised in “Rational Dress,” Mr.
Jenkins’ physique is eloquent of great stamina.
He began cycling 19 years ago, started raoing 13
years ago, and has proved himself one of the
finest champions that Australia has produced.
He has won over 60 races. He beat T- W. Busst,
the English champion rniler, for the one-mile
championship of N.S.W.
In ’B7 he won the three-
mile interprovincial race in
so brilliant a fashion that
the N.S.W. Cyclist Union
and the Vic. Cyclist Union
combined in presenting
him with a handsome ad-
dress, expressing their
admiration. In the same
year he took altogether 16
prizes, including all the
N.S.W. championships.
Although now 35 years
old, Mr. Jenkins hopes yet
to put up a sensational
record. In a few weeks’
time he is going to lida
from Sydney to Melbourne,
578 miles, and will try to
eclipse Armstrong’s time
of 4 days 3| hours. It is
only a wonderful stayer
like Jenkins who could
attempt this herculean
task, for Armstrong was a
phenomenal man, who,
during his ride, rested only
six hours out of the 24,
and slept with the greatest
contentment under a wire
fence. Still, Mr. Jenkins
has many precedents of his
own from which to form a
judgment. Racing, on the
track, he was best at long
distances, but successful as
he was at 10-miles, his
road-riding for 100 miles
and upwards is still more
extraordinary. He holds
the road record for 100
miles; he has ridden 134
miles (the last 50 over a
very heavy road) in 9hrs.
22min. ; the other day he
started at 5 o’clock in the
morning and rode 117 miles in 7\ hours, after
covering which distance he felt as fresh as ever.
When he first began cycling, the old high-wheelers
were in vogue, and Mr. Jenkins rode a 60-inch
one. Now he uses the familiar low-wheel type;
the machine he will ride on from Sydney to Mel-
bourne he obtained at the Bicycle Depot of his old
opponent, 0. W. Bennett, of 159 Clarence-street,
Sydney.
The lately-deceased squatter M‘G>aw, ®f
Kooba, N.S.W., hailed from Ballymena, in the
North of Ireland, and the swagrnan who could
talk about that town was sure of a job, or of
plenty tucker if the station was full-handed. This
becoming known, the Munsterman who had never
been North of Drogheda, would say he had
“Wance passed through Ballymena.” One day,
a Chinese cook, seeking employment, exclaimed,
when all else had failed, “ All li, Missee Magaw,
me from Ballymella allee same.”
William Greenlaw, for years manager of
the Colonial Bank, Melb, and for a generation one
of the chiefs of Southern finance,"died last week.
When he got into the box in court to give evi-
dence for the bank he used to blunder terribly.
“Gentlemen,” said Justice Hartley Williams in
charging the jury in a Cblonial Bank case, “ when I
was at the bar and appeared for the bank I shivered
in my shoes whenever Mr. Greenlaw entered
the box.” Greenlaw came into power on the
deposition of Adam Burnes, the first manager,
who fell to the ground when Glass broke. Hugh
Glass was a squatter, with the bank in his toils.
Confidence in him led also to O’Shanassy being
deprived of the chairmanship in favor of Alder-
man Teddy Cohen.

Griffith’s solicitors’ reciprocity

but as the amalgamation of solicitors

Since the Tasmanian Main Line

necessarily more costly than private
management —looks as heal thy as ever.
One cheap method of retrench-
ment could safely be adopted by the
Yic. Govt. —viz., doing its business
correctly. Crown law is always
blundering; the Education Depart-
ment has been wrongfully dismissing
its teachers (at a cost of £3000);
Railway Dept, has just been ordered
to pay damages for wrongfully dis-
missing a stationmaster; Lands
Dept, has allowed rents to get in
arrear, £750,000, and frequently duns
the man who has paid up.
Brodribb, ex-Secretary of Yic.
Education Department (a lavishly-

Peacock is appropriately sarcastic.
Look at all the bearings. Mr. Brod-
ribb uses his departmental know-
ledge, to the injury of the poor old
cow who furnishes him with her milk.
Then, again, this heavy-metalled
pensioner comes and “ snavels ” cases
out of the mouths of struggling bar-
risters, who unavoidably subscribe to
his pension.
Mr. Northcroft, P.M. at Blen-
heim (M.L.), in the course of a recent
case affecting a Government con-
tract -. “At one time I was in a
Government office where it was part
of my duty to open tenders. I was
surprised at the great difference in
the amounts of the tenders, and
asked the engineer for an explana-
tion. 1 Well,’he said, ‘ some of them
intend to pay for the work and the
material; some intend to pay for the
work only but not for the material;
Mid some don’t intend to pay either
for work or material, and these
beggars are always the lowest ten-
lerers.’ ”
The Queensland Labor members made a
rery serious mistake in refusing the J.P.-ships
offered them by the present Government. One
Labor M.L. A., who accepted the proffered honor,

iquatter.
Preraier Kingston : “The S.A. Govern-

cession.

grower of cane and refiner of sugar. Let Queens-
land beware.
It is complained against the S.A. Commis-
sioner of Police that he is afraid of asserting him-
self against either political complaints or political
patronage. Hence the disorganisation which at
times makes itself so manifest in the force sup-
posed to be under his control. He is even more
“attentive” to “distinguished” globe-trotters
than Sammy Way.
The Gothenburg licensing system, which
G. D. Clark calls an invention of the Devil, is
admitted on all hands to have diverted the Scan-
dinavian drink habit from ardent spirits to beer.
Australian advocates of that system merely desire
an analogous diversion in Australia”from ardent
spirits to wine, and, if Australian human nature
be like Scandinavian, who, as a patriot, can oppose
the experiment ?
The Royal assent was given to the S.A.
Adult Suffrage Act on Feb. 7, and the official
document intimating the consent is expected in
Adelaide about the middle of March. Then
the Sheriff will proceed to enrol the names of
70,000 women. To enable them to vote at the
general election in April the rolls must be com-
plete before the end of Sept., as names must be
registered six months.
Total population of Bundaberg, Q., dis-
trict, 13,712. Kanaka slaves (a generous esti-
mate), 2700. Total deaths, 307. Kanakas, 170;
white, 131 1 The white death-rate (including
infants) is thus 11 and a decimal per 1000, the
Kanaka, 62 and a decimal (exclusive of infants 1 11).
Yet the Australian Star, of Sydney, which
whoops for Queensland nigger-slavery, says it
wants “definite charges” made against the slave-

A CCOMMODATING.
SWAGMAN: “I can't get no work; will yer give me

OLD PARTY ( who wants some cheap aid in her garden):
“Can you tell one kind of flower from another?”

AIN'T the best brand.”
The all-absorbing British capitalist, it
seems, is desirous of acquiring exclusive territorial
rights in New Guinea, and has approached Gov.
MacGregor upon thesubject. The Governor is, how-
ever, opposed to such rights being granted, as he
believes that it would be distasteful to the Austra-
lians. As a business speculation let the con-
trollers of New Guinea let the land on lease if it
is to be parted with at all. The (English) Hamp-
ton Plains Co., which lately sharked so much
valuable Westralian land, is, it will be noticed,
letting same on lease—not selling it.
Apropos ex-Premier Parkes’s fervid apos-
trophe concerning the glories of what the Aus-
tralian Star calls “the foul old rum hospital,
soaked through and through with the odours of
the bygone convict time” —which building is
identical with the Sydney (N.S.W.) Parliament
Houses of to-day—nobody has yet remarked on
the eagerness with which Parkes aforesaid, who
now so enthuses over “ the only historic building
in Australia,’’seized the chance, in centenary year,
of laying the foundation-stone of the new N.S.W.
Parliament Houses—still an institution of the dim
and misty future.
Dunedin Congregational Union has decided
against advocating Bible-lessons in State schools,
So long as the Bible is kept out of State-schools
there is some chance of the two big rival religions
remaining at comparative peace. To Biblicise the
schools is simply to Protestantise them.
Sir Henry Wrenfordsley, the “journeyman
Judge,” writes to London Times, proposing that
Australia should make its Federal Parliament by
the simple process of lumping together the six
Legislative Councils and giving them supreme
power to run the show. This great suggestion
deserves to be remembered as the most awful hunk
of imbecility yet contributed to the Federal discus-
ston. Plainly, it doesn’t require much brains to
be some kind of a Judge.
SHORT HAIR ITEM.
THE VICTIM (to barher, who is telling him an endless yarn): “ Cut it
short, old man.”
BARBER: “Cut it short I Why, damn it, man, do yer want it

Maoriland Minister for Labor Reeves, who
recently toured Australia, exhausts all his super-
latives in praise of Premier Kingston. Perhaps
Reeves regrets the absence of a Kingston at Wel-
lington to lead the solid Democratic phalanx.
What possibilities of progressive legislation can be
conjured up had Ballanoe lived to lead the over-
whelming Liberal majority returned in “one-
person-one-vote ” Maoriland, at last general elec-

Premier Nelson (Q.) tells a Brisbane news-
paper man that, at the recent Hobart Conference
of Premiers, “ a general desire was expressed that
the Chief Justice of each province should be
eligible for election to the Convention.” Let
public sentiment thunder back “No!” It is a
case of bad varicose veins that an Attorney-
General is primarily a political bounder ; it would
be fatal blood-poisoning of the Constitution if a
Chief Justice, or any other Judge, were per-
mitted to be also a party politician. No ; Judges
must be the eunuchs of politics.
“ The Kanaka must take a smaller wage
or be replaced by the laborer who will.”—Brisbane
Courier. When will some proprietor begin to
introduce the educated and brilliant Hindoo uni-
versity graduate to be a cheap editor in Australia
and show the Courier man that he must also take a
lower wage or be replaced by the nigger who will ?
Then what a change there will be in the morning 1
It is always the man that the cheap nigger doesn’t
compete with who thinks that the cheap nigger
should compete his hardest with some other man,
and who thinks the other man a degraded ruffian
for not seeing it in the same light.
Mr. “Jack” Want, who was appointed
N.S.W. Attorney-General during the vacation,
and who straightway started for Honolulu on full
salary of <£4o a week, has gone on to ’Frisco. By
the time he returns to Sydney, Mr. Want—a
most uncompromising opponent of payment of
members—will be legally entitled to draw £6OO
without necessarily doing a single scrap of work.
As a motion of censure is very likely to be
tabled against the Reid Government soon after
Parliament meets, it is possible that the erratic
Mr. Want may return too late to do one single
stroke of the work attaching to his office—which
would be a service in this way, that no Govern-
ment would dare to perpetrate a job of similar
flagrancy for a week or two at all events.
The Sunday following the adoption of
standard time, Rev. J. Gilbertson, Anglican par-
son at Wedderburn (Vic.), (formerly of Rockhamp-
ton, Q.), thus prefaced his sermon :
My brethren,— During: the past week an extraordinary
attempt has been made by Parliament to alter the time of
day. I wish to announce that I intend to take no notice
myself of such alteration—nor will the sun do so either.
Ttie sun will rise and set as heretofore, regardless of the
unauthorised mandate of men in temporary authority. I
do not know of sufficient cause for such alteration, and I
repeat that I shall adhere to the only true time, and let
those who are weak enough to adopt this false Parliamen-
tary time do so if they wish. The text for this evening’s
sermon will be found in the nineteenth verse of the one
hundred and fourth psalm—“ The sun knoweth his going
down.”
His fine old Conservative reverence continues to
ring his bell by the old time, 20min, after the
other churches. Being a parson, he is naturally
behind the times.
The P. and O. Co.’s local manager declares
that Australia has no right to demand the aboli-
tion of Lascar labor on board the State-subsidised
P. and O. mail-boats, because the Lascars are
“just as much British subjects as are the Aus-
tralians,” and are entitled to exactly the same
privileges. Let them have the same privileges,
then. As soon as the British authorities recognise
the Indian’s equality by giving him a Parliament
based on manhood suffrage, and a nigger Ministry
to run the whole business of Government, and
entirely withdraws the British armed forces, and
as soon as the P. and O. Co. recognises the
Lascar’s equality by filling their boats with cheap
nigger captains and officers, then The Bulletin
will recognise that the Lascar is the same sort of
British subject as the Englishman and the Aus-
tralian. But for the present it states, on the
authority of the British Government and the
P. and O. Co., that he isn’t, and acts accordingly.
At Kiama (N.S.W.) last week, Parkei
asked: “Where his the man hin Hingland to
replace Gladstone ? Where his the man to replace
Sorlsbury ?” But what the old fox was really
driving at, of course, was : “Wffiere his the man
hin Noo South Wales ’oo can replace ’Enery
Barkes?
It is doubtful whether woman can be
elected to S. A. Legislature under the Adult
Suffrage Act. There is no section which provides
for such a privilege, but the Act provides that
women shall “possess and exercise” the same
“ rights ” as men, and it is alleged this only covers
voting. In the original bill a clause was included
enacting that women should not sit in Parliament,
and it was rejected in the Council.
TheS.M. Herald's
tip:—“The work ol

would make the Judges

it is desirable they
should be. They are
paid quite well enough
to isolate themselves
from scrip and other
dealings, and there
would never be the
slightest difficulty in
getting excellent men
to accept office on such
terms. Wanted, a

In Victoria, a newly-admitted barrister
has to pay 40 guineas as a library fee, which is one
of the many methods of keeping the profession
select. It was lately proposed to reduce the fee
to 10 guineas, but the Tories of the Council threw
out the proposal with scorn and horror. Yet the
same Tories, during the maritime strike, stood
aghast when they heard that the wharf laborers
charged £5 for admission to their union to keep it
select, and called it “unexampled tyranny.”
Parkes, having become desperate, has be-
taken himself to Kiama and Jamberoo, where,
talking Federation, he quotes Coghlan to the
effect that 10 years hence the population of Aus-
tralia and Maoriland will he between six and
seven millions. By then N.S.W. should have on
her rolls, including women, just half-a-million
voters, and 70 per cent, of the whole population
of Australia will be Australian-born. The old
man said nothing about the original Kiama Ghost,
but trotted out the Chmese-invasion bogey,
George G. Turri, the clever patents agent
and expert, of Melb., is a perfect mine of infor-
mation on patent rights and laws throughout the
world. He was mainly instrumental in obtaining
the provision in the Vic. Patent Law for the very
necessary examination into novelty, inducing
Wrixon to insert the clause at the last minute.
Many an inventor has to thank Turri for the per-
sistent efforts he has been making for years to
protect genius against fraud. F. Harley Davis,
the inventor of the Calyx drill, the appliance
which is supplanting (he costly diamond drilling
plants, was a client of Turri’s, and obtained
<£2500 the other day for the right to use five
drills. “The Inventor's Guide,” by G. G. Turri,
is a sterling work on the subject of patents.
Toxa, the nonpareil rabbit - destroying
specific, is establishing wonderful records in the
Southern colonies, and circumstances are ap-
parently conspiring to banish all the old-fashioned
poisons in favor of this latest scientific prepara-
tion. The Melbourne press published a telegram
from Albury on 12th inst., that the devastating
fires which have recently swept through Riverina,
have been unmistakably traced to the spontaneous
ignition of the phosphorised preparations for
rabbit-poisoning, and a specific instance of the
destruction of 30,000 acres of grass is definitely
quoted. It is one of the special features of Toxa
that it is not inflammable, and cannot, in fact, be
set fire to; and it has been further proved that
cattle, horses and sheep will not eat Toxa, as they
will invariably eat phosphorised preparations of
wheat, pollard, etc. The National Wool Co. of
Australia Ltd., of Melbourne, are the agents for
Toxa in Australia and New Zealand.

THE ARGUS,
■SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1895.
Suicide is a subject at once unpic-
turesque and unpleasant, and the natural
impulse is to forget such a distressful
theme as expeditiously as possible. But
two casds of self-slaughter reported in
our columns during the week are of so
striking a character that they must
arrest general attention. In one case
ah Australian student in London, just
22 years of age, took his own life in
■apparently the most motiveless fashion,
and left behind him elaborate instruc- i
tions for deceiving everybody into the"’
belief that his. death was an accident.
THE AGE,
s
MELBOURNE, SATURDAY,
9ra February. 1395
A single tragedy near home like that of
Jane and Jessie Perkins, in South Mel-
bourne, is sure to oppress the mind with a
special horror. And yet it is but a drop in
the constantly flowing river of suicide, like
that of the youth Lloyd Burdekin, who, at
the age 0f.22. having exhausted his in-
genuity in order to dramatically act a lie
ae to the cause of his death, blew oat hU
brains, seemingly lor no other reason than
to try and cheat some coroner into return-
ing a verdict'of accident

Miss Micbie, the Yic. Q.C.’s daughter,

The newly-formed Melb. female cycling-
club has decided to be sartorially irrational.
Though the raison d’etre of the club is woman’s
reasonable desire to show her legs, which are often
so much more fetching than her face, a rule has
been framed absolutely prohibiting fair members
from donning baggy breeches. It is understood
that the movers in this matter were some flat-
chested “ frumps ” with attenuated shanks, who
were fearful of incurring the ridicule of the street
urchin. One or two full-limbed girls strove boldly
for breeches, but were impotent before the power-
ful skirt coterie.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Why is it that man,
when he wants to look more than ususally impres-
sive, always gets into skirts?” In prehistoric
times scarcely anybody wore clothes who was not
powerful enough to rob some hunter, or was a
mighty hunter himself and annexed the hides from
the beasts of the field direct. Thus a big ward-
robe became synonymous with fame, power and
dignity, and as most folk wore their entire ward-
robe on their backs, the more togs a man wore the
bigger potentate he was thought to be. It’s only
a relic of out-of-date barbarism.—Yours, Y,

Miss Sutherland .(the opposition of the
Melb. Presbytery having made a New Woman of
her) says that “ man was never meant to rule the
world. That is woman’s mission. Man’s mission
is to work for woman.” But the lady has
generously admitted that woman couldn’t very
well get along without man. And yet a good
many have to—especially New Woman. There
were a few widows present on the platform when
the above ideas were enunciated —a coalition of
the new and secondhand, as it were.

The other day a young Victorian bride,
when the customary rice was thrown after her and
her male accomplice, turned back and broke her
umbrella over the head of the principal rice-
thrower, and had to be hauled off her mangled
victim before she could be induced to resume the
simple joys of the honeymoon. Yon can’t throw
rioe at the New Woman with impunity.
“ Is church-going a
perishing habit ? ” asks
Melb. Argus. The Bul-

proper manner.

About one-third of

An ingenuous little
maiden penetrated a
Sydney newspaper-office
recently and presented a
short notice of her
mother's last reception.
The notice not appearing
in ordinary course, she
made inquiries, and
learned that “only
leaders of society receive
notices gratis; when
tradespeople and shop-
keepers desire to have
their evenings at home
chronicled they are ex-
pected to pay cash per
inch.”
Governor Brassey, Victoria’s new vice-
gracious, pronounces his name “Bracy.” This is
the first step in the process by which Smith
became Carington, and Mullins became De
Moleyns, and “Duke Smithson of Northumber-
land ” became Percy. By-and-by, Brassey will
snell himself Bracy; then he will call himself De
Bracy which will probably be as near De Bressi
as he’ll care to go. Bracy has an old Norman
sound. Brassey is only vaguely suggestive of
the coarse old progenitor, king of the wheelbar-
rows who spoke of money<as “ brass,” and whose
coat of arms was a pick rampant. The enriched
Brassey or Mullins always developes a truly
Hinglish craving after a pedigree and a Norman
ancestor. Old Marshal Junot, who was as coarse
as any Brassey of the crowd, knew better. “I
don’t need ancestors,” he said when someone con-
doled with him on the obscurity of his family. 1
myself am an ancestor.”
N.9.W., long idle, has now promised his em-
ployes six weeks’ work. The Bulli miners are in
desperate straits. Scores of the unfortunate men
have of late been earning a few pence a day by pick-
ing blackberries, which grow wild in great pro-
fusion locally, and are now being extensively used
for jam.
One picture now at Hobart Exhibition
should certainly be secured by N.S. W. National
Gallery. “The Death of Brutus,” by Gustav
Wertheimer, represents a travelling showman and
his wife lamenting the death of their lion, whose
corpse has just been taken from its cage. It is a
splendid and pathetic picture. As the N.S. W. gal-
lery already possesses “ The Widower,” it might
be injudicious to buy “ The Bribe,” now shown at
Hobart Exhibition—a broadly but trickily-painted
picture, possessing human interest of the same
sort as “The Widower.” “The Bribe,” which
represents the father of a sick child dangling
before it a gaudy toy to induce it to take the
medicine offered by the mother, who kneels at
the other side of the bed, is full of clever light-
effects, and is a picture out of which a smart
showman with a talent for lying about how much
it cost him could easily make a little pile.

The Sydney “Churchman’s Alliance” last
week was discussing the best means of getting
more men to come to church. Teetotal Parson
Boyce advocated brightening the services (few
mented wine is a brightener, by the way !)
“mixing more with the men” by “evening visi-
tations ” (what penal blessings !) and joining male
“ societies.” Layman John Kent seemed to think,
that men should not be required to “ wash vip ”
and don “Sunday clothes.” Parson William
Martin condescendingly laid down the rule that
“ clergymen should converse more with the work-
ing men, who really like being talked to.” So
long as parsons adopt this posture of lofty
patronage towards the poor of their congregations,
so long will the obstinate and independent male
not only stay away from church, but consign al!
“ pastors and masters ” to —Heaven.

In the case of a Sydney “ daughter of joy,”
beak Addison advised her to be dealt with sum-
marily, instead of going to a jury “ Thechanoes
are that you will get two years there, whilst you
could only get six months here.” Lawyer Levien ;
“ But then, the chances are that she will get out.
I wouldn’t mind betting that she will.” Mr.
Addison: “I suppose a jury is more easily gob
round than I am.” ....!!! There are several
interesting aspects in which to consider this epi-
sode. There is the primarily paternal attitude of
the magistrate to the unfortunate girl, and his
free worldly advice. And there is afterwards his
undisguised contempt for the amorous impression-
ableness of the average juryman when confronted
with Lais with her hair down.

Two cases have, within the last week,
come before the N.S.W. courts of men who first
went to gaol in their boyhood for trivial offences,
and have been in gaol ever since. A slab from
one case: —
When it came to M'Guire’s turn, the gaol authorities
read out an appalling list of previous convictions. Al-
though quite a young man, the greater part of his life
has been passed in prison, with which he made his first
acquaintance when he was 15, and from which he was only
discharged last January. His last sentence was for
robbery with violence, and it was one of seven years and
two floggings. M'Guire urged, in extenuation, that he
had never known friends, education, nor kindness of any
sort, had never been taught a trade nor done a day’s work
in his life. What chance was there for such as he ? His
Honor sentenced him to seven years’ penal servitude.
“ The mixture as before !”

In these days when the Advanced Woman
pervades Maoriland, it is becoming a common
thing for parties of girls to go for a holiday,
without any male protector, by some of
the U.S.S. Oo.’s excursions. Concerning
this subject, a Maoriland paper briefly
reports: “Quite recently five girls
from this city went on the round
trip. The parents of two of these
girls are now sorry—yes, and
much more than sorry—that they
went.” In which sentence is
contained the whole

Williams, who killed his fellow-prisoner,
O’Connor, in that apparently disorganised insti-
tution, Bathurst Gaol, by hitting him on the head
with a broom, was tried at Sydney last week and
found guilty of manslaughter only. He was
excellently defended by Mr. R. D. Meagher,
Williams admitted the deed, bub pleaded great
provocation, and that O’Connor’s death was the
outcome of a blow in a sudden quarrel, and nob of
malice aforethought. The prisoner much improved
his case, in the eyes of the Court, by the evidence
he gave on oath on his own behalf. Judge Win-
deyer agreed with the verdict, and in sentencing
Williams to a year’s additional gaol, read him a
fatherly sorb of sermon. Williams is a lucky man.
From the manner in which his case had been
handled by the press apparently inspired by the
Bathurst gaol-officials he was regaled by out-

Mr. Meagher, aforesaid, by the way, appeared
to defend his man in a gay suit with a magnificent
“button-hole’’under his legal nose. Wmdeyer
J. sent the lawyer a private note, that the solemn
occasion deserved a solemn suit, and adjourned
the court for an hour. At the end of which time
the advocate appeared in black and without the
bouquet. His Honor having snorted approval,
the case proceeded.

The N.S.W. Minister of Justice ought
really to ukase that no police-magistrate should,
under pain of dismissal, dine, or lunch, or drink
with anyone having a case before his court. Like-
wise, that no police-magistrate should constantly
drink at low public-houses with low attorneys—or
even occasionally fall down drunk in public places,
in or out of business hours. As police-magistrates
have to administer the murderous flogging-act,
and deal out lashes to such—haw—unbelltoppeerd
offenders against the person as appear before the
Bench, it is some what expedient that their Wor-
ships should all invariably be at least partially
sober.
N.S.W, Crown Law officers have decided
for purposes of marriage registration that a
divorced woman coming up for marriage may be
set down as “unmarried,” and, if she likes, she
may use her maiden name. It sometimes happens
that it is more convenient for her, on account of
children, to retain her late marriage name, and in
such cases her new marriage may take place under
that name with the designation “ unmarried ”
still attached. The Law officers were driven to
define these niceties owing to the bewildering
state in which registration papers have been
arriving from celebrants. Women were therein
described as to “condition” as “divorces,”
“divorcees,” “divorced from,” “divorced by,”
“widows,” “ex-wives,” “ legal widows,” “Act
of Parliament widows,” “ Windeyer widows,”
and many other sorts of curiosities.

The ordinary amateur Justice expects to
while away the morning only in playing the
Magistrate, and, if a case be lengthy, the unfor-
tunate defendant, whose defence is naturally last
and more diffuse, certainly do'es not receive fair
play. Another of. the advantages arising from
persons in business writing J.P. after iheir names.
However, some of the Stipendariea also have got
into the habit of working mornings only, and are
very nasty if compelled to expend brain tissue
after lunch.

A depressing spectacle of the time is a por-
trait of the principal actors in
a recent fashionable wedding,
on view in Collins-street.
The bride looks the beta,
but her bridegroom’s
knobby knees, kilted
in the most swagger
style, attract all
eyes from the con-
templation of her
graces. Spectators
think, with a sigh,
of the Sydney loan-
picture, “Wed-
ded,”-.in which the
young husband
shows twice as
much anatomy with
far more pleasing
effect. A modern kilt,
like an elbow-sleeve, dis-
plays the weakest point of
a limb, at the same time con-
cealing all extenuating circum-
stances.

“Why men don’t go to church.” One
reason is that, as a S.M. Heeald correspondent
puts it, “ Men aren’t women.” Another reason is
that the men have been to church.

they mostly find in the pulpits the fools of the

eyed rabbits and Italian greyhounds of humanity.

Apropos a recent Melb. tragedy. The
piano, remarks a Bulletin correspondent, is
always the last article which a Melbourne family
disposes of. They may eat their food off gin-cases
and sleep on the floor, but the piano they have
always with them, and the eldest daughter jingles
out “Dysy ” and other horrors, just to show the
neighbors that they haven’t reached that stage of
degradation and poverty known as “selling the
planner.” The yarn of the man who threw his
wife out of the second storey window of his burn-
ing house and carried the feather bed downstairs
in his arms, could not have been told of a Melb.
man, as he would have wanted his wife to help
him to carry down the piano.

The house where the S. Melb. double-
suicide took place is one of a row of about 20
wretched wooden cottages facing a triangular
reserve at the intersection of the St. Kilda and
Port Melb. railway lines. In the summer this
space is occupied by hundreds of children who use
it as a cricket-ground. It is all “made” ground
of river silt, and not a blade of grass appears on
its surface. In winter, a large portion of it is
covered wdth an inch or two of water, on the
top of which there floats a white slime, which fact
gives to this delectable region the name of Salt
Lake City. And yet people wonder at the
suicide.

Melb. Heeald howls weirdly because
there is no funeral service read over the bodies
consigned to the pickle-tub at Melb. University
for the use of the medical students. “Students
will cut and hack for six months more,” wails the
agonised editor, “ and shapeless human envelopes
will be committed to earth without Christian ser-
vice as of yore.” The Bulletin suggests that a
parson be engaged by contract to perform the ser-
vice once a week over the harness-cask in the
Medical School, after which the pickled Christians
might be buried without compunction when
worked up by the sucking sawboneses. The dead
vagrant, we notice, receives a deal more sympathy
than the living variety ; the latter is rarely gushed
AT THE MATCH.
Miss Ethel and her suitor spruce
Indulged in cricket chatting
The while big Harry Trott and Bruce
Were spiritedly batting.
Their names fell glibly from her lips
Whene’er her young adorer
Said, “ Trotty got it through the slips 1”
Or “Billy cut a fourer !”
She knew not t’other one from which,
Their figures oft mistaking—
She thought the bowlers wanted “ pitch ”
To keep the ball from “ breaking ” —
But like a darling girl she came,
Her heart with ardour ticking,
To see Australia win the game,
And England get a licking.
The score was what she understood :
Miss Ethel watched it mounting—
“ Trott’s 20 now,” she said. “ How good !
I wonder if he’s counting?”
Then fast across the level sward
They started off to run “ byes.”
Still gazing at the scoring-board
She cried, “ Which man is Sundries?"

A discussion has been
taking place in English
journals as to whether
girls should be married in
ignorance of the duties and
responsibilities of the posi-
tion, or whether the plain
facts should be placed be-
fore them. An English
High Church dignitary
gaveJt as his opinion that
“the Bible, with its chaste
descriptions ” —that is the
dignitary’s phrase—was
a sufficient introduction to
married life.”
For a series of “Scrip-
ture exercises ” for girls a
Victorian religious monthly
chose lately the book, of
Ezekiel, through which it
was necessary to go min-
utely to get the answers.
Ezekiel is about the most
obscene book in the Bible
—worse even than Leviti-
cus—-but its impurities are,
fortunately, of such an
outrageously diabolical
kind that they would be
as Greek to the average
girl.

Dr. Ahearne, at the Science Congress in
Brisbane, attacks the Q. educational regulations
asvbeing unfit for a tropical country—wherein Dr.
Ahearne is not far wrong. But Dr. Ahearne also
attacks the Queensland climate, as being unfit for
Europeans. Ansemia, fevers, dyspepsia, men-
strnal excesses, are the troubles of the Northern
clime, says the doctor. Undoubtedly, the climate
of the North was often fatal to the pioneer. But
the climate of nearly all newly-opened countries is
open to the same charge. Many Queensland towns
which had a terrible mortality 20 years ago are now
among the most salubrious in Australia. And if
the'Queensland climate be unsuited to the white,
statistics show it to be less well adapted to the
black, for the white race in the North is flourish-
ing and multiplying, where the sable and saffron
heathens are quietly rotting out of their slavish
existence.

The Church of England, at Temora
(N.S.W.), is threatened with the bum-bailiff,
and the poor parson didn’t have a square meal to
face even on Christmas Day. This is the story
told, and public pity is asked for. The philo-
sopher has no pity to bestow on such a case. The
bedrock idea at the root of mankind’s spiritual
yearnings, and even the alleged Christian’s pre-
tended ideal, are that “salvation is free,” and
that “ to the poor the gospel is preached.” Taking
these as beacon principles, it becomes a natural
conception of the most exalted kind that the shop-
herd who seeks to make a living out of the gospel
debases it and deceives both himself and his sup-
posed flock. The evangelist of the future will be
bke the primitive apostle—he will work with his
own hands and head at worldly craft to sustain

MR. COCKATOO: “ Now, look here, Mr. Smith, do you practise

REV SMITH: “ Yes—till I know it by heart.”
and maintain himself, and he will preach the
gospel “fornowt.” Just at present the salaried
parson is a huge satire on a Christianity that thus
provides Jehovah with a special civil service of
graded and degraded flunkeys. A parson who is
not content to take his chance with voluntary
contributions has no right to be a parson• he
ought to be a bill-discounter.

to the.suburbs where Chinese gardens abound, and
the European retailer, if honest, will tell yon
that his shop is stocked by the neighbouring
Chows. This is the position, the Chow is polite
and punctual, and sells English-grown goods ; the
European fs not either, and sells Chow-grown
vegetables.—P. M,

Henry Yarley, butcher - evangelist to

which we could expect a blessing, Ido not think
it is irreverent to say that very few people are

Williams, the Bathurst (N.S. W.) convict
who killed his fellow-prisoner, O’Connor, had pre-
viously been flogged for destroying gaol furniture.
The lash acts as a potent deterrent. Also, in
Sydney, last week, a man who had been twice
flogged for garotting, came up and got another
sc' 1 ""'* years for robbery with violence.
# * *
It is averred that the two Stipendiary
Magistrates who revived the lash in Sydney, the
other day, actually, before the subsequently con-
victed offender was tried, had him, a legally inno-
cent man up to date, medically examined as to his
powers of physical endurance under a flogging.
In short, it would appear that the punishment
was, in a sense, prescribed before the formal hear-
ing < f the case.

Gov. Hopetoun’s recent visit to Camper-

with poignant regrets. Never before had the
health of this venerable Rechabite been drunk in
strong drinks, and he shed tears over his fall from

gloomsome teetotal oration based on the fact that
he was 70 years old, and had never spent 6d. on
drink in his life. After which his lordship, very
much affected, proposed further healths, and
drank them in fizz. The man who never spent
6d. on liquor is, after all, not much worse than
the one who spends every 6d. in drink.

From S.M. Herald : —
Brisbane, Thursday.
Mr. Tozer, Colonial Secretary, has decided to declare
Monday, the 20th instant, a public holiday, instead of the
preceding Saturday, which is St. Patrick’s Day.
The brand of dimethylamidoazobenzosulphonio
acid that demoralises the almanac,, like this, that
shifts St. Patrick’s Day into February, that
knocks a Wednesday into Monday, a Sunday into
Saturday, and'the 18th into the 17t'h with a fresh
adjustment of the week all round—must be the
real old stingo, and ought to be passed round to
the other newspaper offices by way of brotherly
festival.
Neighbor : “ The piano fiend, cornet fiend,
banjo fiend, sewing-machine fiend, are ascending
scales of tor-r-ture, but what escels the pious
family, with the bumble-bee harmonium?”
Since the Wairarapa
disaster, great attention is
being paid to life-boat drill
on the various in ter provin-
cial steamers. Life - boat
drill at the best, however, is
a melancholy joke. Every-
body knows when it is going
to come off and turns up
calmly at his post. The
boats aren’t got out, so that
if the gear is rotten, or the
ropes won’t run, or the men
really don’t know how to
lower boats in a rough sea,
the defect isn't discovered.
The drill comes off in fine
weather and by
day, whereas the
frantic rush for
the boats in real
life generally
takes i lace on
a pitch-dark
night, when all
hell seems to
have broken
loose on the
waters. There
is no frenzied
scurry for the
life-belts, no
hysterical wo-
men wailing on
a deck that is
knee - deep in
water, and none
of the usual con-
comitants of a
wreck. Boat-
drill, on a
steamer which
is busy breaking
records for all
it is worth, is
always a farce, more or less, but the kind of drill
which is supplied is even more of a farce than it
need be.
MORE RETRENCHMENT.
These are retrenching times, and everywhere
One hears the bitter cry of men
Who had five quid on which to dress and fare,
Reduced, alas ! to two-pun ten.
The fall in prints, speakers understand,
For these reductions compensates,
And yet the outlawed babes at “Lloyd’s”
command
The old, inflated, boom-time rates ! ”

the land produces no wealth without man, therefore it is
quite as fair to say that all wealth comes from man. (3)
The value of most articles consists of something like one
per cent, value of raw material supplied by the land and
99 per cent, value added by labor and human intelligence.

get from land where there is absolutely no water. (5)

The firm of Crawford, King and Co.,
which has won such wide popularity as a trading
bouse in the Southern province during the past
five years, has, under the stress of very extenuating
circumstances, been forced into liquidation. It is
very unlikely that the goodwill of so sound a
business will be sacrificed, and it may be reason-
ably expected that when the present trouble is
over, the business will rise again bigger and better
than ever. Meanwhile, the trustee has his execu-
tive hand on the concern, and the purport of these
presents is to intimate that the large and valuable
stock is being sold at a great sacrifice. A few
good lines in men’s necessaries are referred to by
advt. elsewhere.

Discretionary Investments
Are also undertaken AT THE POST for diems who

STEEL (Member of Tattersall’s) apropos of which please
read the following :
PRESS OPINION.—“ Mr. STEEL FREQUENTLY
makes those of his clients who cannot PERSONALLY
attend raoes, and who entrust to him a few pounds to
invest FOR them, GOOD WINNERS.” (10 per cent,
charged on winnings only.)
DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS.—“Mr. STEEL
fairly eclipsed himself on Saturday last, each of his Dis-
cretionary Investing Clients of a ‘fiver’ on that day
receiving with their account a cheque for £4O 10s., after
deducting his commission of 10 per cent.”
I**- And, finally, PRESS OPINION of Feb, 6, 1894.
“These Discretionary Invest merits undertaken by Mr. A.
W. STEEL must perforce be better than backing
‘ Doubles,’&c., for Big Races (albeit Mr. S. also under-
takes such Commissions when desired), and also better
than Sweeps, where the chances are 1000 to 1 against you,
whereas HERE the chances are all IN YOUR FAVOR.”
These DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS are under-
taken by Mr. Steel on ALL the Races, and he is so
operating, and anticipates a SUCCESSFUL time at
CAULFIELD(V.A.T.C.)RACES on the 23rd FEBRUARY,
and also on the FOLLOWING SATURDAY (2nd March),
NEWMARKET HANDICAP DAY, and the FIRST Day
of the BIG AUSTRALIAN MEETING.
N.B.—Clients who have not SUFFICIENT TIME to
send their money for INVESTMENTS by post can do so
by WIRE.
Mr. A. W. STEEL is the ONLY ACCREDITED
PUBLIC INVESTOR in Melbourne, and the ONLY ONE
who often has A GOOD WIN HIMSELF, and who causes
his DISCRETIONARY INVESTING CLIENTS to do like-
wise. Therefore,
COMMON SENSE
points to your entrusting HIM (and HIM ONLY) with
your INVESTMENTS.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Amongst the Newmarket light-weights, Esau —
Sep. Miller's —looks like having a chance. He started at
Aspendale Park the other day and won two rac es, beating
fairly good fields, and on the following Tuesday won the
Mentone Flying Handicap, and ran a dead-beat later on.
Practically four wins in as many starts. He carries 6 - 9
in the big event t The fancy top-weight, Whakawatea,
has also shown form, winning at Cootaniundra in a canter
with 10-7. But the quality of the field must be con-
sidered.
♦ • * • •
lb is unfair to Byron Moore for the cricket
authorities to clash with the Newmarket. As the New-
market happens regularly every year, its fixtures should
be respected. As things are, most racing people will see
the Newmarket on Saturday and the match on Monday.
• ♦ * •
Byron Moore, on behalf of the V.R.0., en-
deavored to get a postponement of the Mclh. “rubber"
match until after his club’s forthcoming mec ting, but the
M.C.C. couldn't entertain the idea. Thedat.es were pro-
bably fixed with the express purpose of giving the teams
a chance to get the Thursday—if not the Tuesday also —
at Flemington after finishing their tussle.
* » * •
Dear Bulletin, —Re favourites’ chances in the
Newmarket, you remark: “But how seldom do early
favourites win big events?" I wish to ask, on the con-
trary, how often does an early favourite—afterwards
neglected for some flash-in-the-pan— turn up and win,
causing innumerable exclamations of: “’Slrew'th, why
didn’t I stick to him 1” After years of close observation,
I conclude that the favourite on the day of the race sel-
dom wins. For his Melb. Cup, Malvolio was an early
favourite, while last year Patron was favourite s r me time
before the race, hut started at long odds. So, also, Paris
for Caulfield Cup.—Walter Stock.
« * • •
A straight-out tip for the Newmarket Handi-
cap is Whakawatea, and nothing else. A Maonlander
won it last year in Hova, and Lochiel won it previously,
when he just pipped Abner. Then Whakawatea is the
fastest sprinter in Maoriland, and may win from end to
end.
• » * •
The reason why Humphrey Oxenham takes to
promoting consultations is not far to seek. From the
way legitimate bookmaking is running down he knows
that within, say, three years, there won’t be any ante-
post betting, and very little, and precarious at that, in
the paddock. There is even now no real bookmaking—
no getting round and laying to your book. There are
never more than three horses backed at suburban races,
and not more than six in a race at Randwick, and, as a
consequence, it is the layers who plunge, not the punters.
The public are frequently right, too, so that when a
live ’tin gets home the “books” have not tak> n enough
to pay their losses. If any reader doubts this let him
count up and see how many of the sound men of seven
to two years ago, are to be seen with the bag on, nowa-
days.
• • * •
An interesting comment on racing “form,” as
shown at the little outside meetings, was published in
a Vic. daily last week. The paragraph put the case
rather delicately:—" , another Newmarket candidate,
started in the Handicap. Although he finished out of a
place, his supporters for the Flemington event were very
well satisfied with his running.” On pai tr there was
much cause for the horse’s supporters to tear their hair.
* ♦ • •
Now that Carbine has departed, how long is
Australia to retain his illustrious rival, Abercorn ? As far
as good looks and breeding go, the latter suffers nothing
from comparison. In w eight-for-age races, it was almost
a dead-heat between them.
* • * *
Said that Carbine was offered at 15,000 guineas
to Haggin, the American sportsman, who declined to buy
at the price.
* • • *
After all, Carbine didn’t go so very cheap.
Taking freight, insurance, &0., into account, he will have
cost Jumbo Portland nearly ihrioe as much as Sam Hor-
den gave for Nordenfeldt, as well-bred, as good-looking,
and almost as good a performer.
• • • *
Musket’s first son in Maoriland was Fnider, the
most arrant of duffers. The writer was abusing him one
day when he was pretending to race at Ellerslie, and
Bennett, now owner of Euroka but then a director
of the M.L. Stud Co., chipped in with, “Yes, curse him ;
if that brute had never been foaled our company would
be thousands richer to-day.” And there was truth in the
remark. Snider depreciated the first crop to an inestim-
able extent. They were all Muskets right enough, but
till James White bought Martini-Henry they wouldn’t
go off!

Spagnoletti: “ I have just been astounded out-
side Spenoer-st. Railway-station, Melb. A small boy, per-
haps 14, came up, and wanted to know if I would hack a
good double for Mentone. He had a complete printed
threepenny betting-book, with a lot of the stumps where
he had laid wagers.”
• • • ♦
At Avenel (Vic.), the other day, Arthur Bayley,
of Bayley’s Reward, ran his old pack-horse, Coolgardie
Ben, against a local crack, Reporter, for £lOO aside. The
latter, which had won many races, was looked on as a
dead cert., and a big crowd assembled to see the old ’un
put down. There was plenty money going, and Bayley
took all he could get. The horses kept together for a
mile and a-half, when Reporter was under the whip, but
to no purpose, as “ the packer” came away and won a
splendid race by half-a-length, to the great disgust of the
ring. Ben is a chestnut, is about 15’2, and apparently
12 or 13 years old. He is said to be identical with a once
well-known Vic. racer shipped years ago to Westralia.
• * • *
The unvarying fidelity of the jockey-boy to his
employers in roping bids fair to become a thing of the
past. As a rule, when asked to explain, the jockey
always insisted that his orders were to “getaway well
and win if you can.” The other day, however, at some
Melb. pony-races, a rider, when asked the reason of his
evident anxiety to lose, declared that he had ridden as
instructed. Pony and owner were rubbed out, while the
boy was dismissed, with a caution. He was waited on,
however, by one or two of the “push” and forcibly
argued with. * * »
Dear Bulletin, —That Carbine picture was a
cruel blow. For years I have been dodging that white
near hind leg. It has driven me to do my own shaving,
and to be a teetotaller—so far as pubs, are concerned.
Only two hotels in Melbourne have not got the picture
hung up in some shape, and they are not on my beat.
Ever since the proposed sale of tfm beast was announced
I have abstained from buying ordinary newspapers that
were bound to reproduce the wi etched animal. I have
sworn off sport until he has been dead 50 years. English
papers will now soon be also closed to me. Gradually my
life is being denuded of every enjoyment. I have even
had to drop church and the religious journals to avoid
statistics as to how many loaves of bread might he bought
with £13,650. And now you deal the final bl< w. Tell me
straight, do you intend to reproduce a picture of Car-
bine’s first “get” on the other side? Do you intend to
reproduce that accursed white leg etc., when the horse
dies, or when its owner dies, or upon any other feeble
occasion ? If so, give me due notice, or The Bulletin
and I must part for ever.—Yours, Cop.
• • • ♦
The Moorefield stewards are most unhappy in
their choice of fitting "examples.” Flagrant cases of
roping are somehow passed over, whilst a jockey who
eases his mount when he has no show of winning is
severely treated.

Mr. Bartlett, of Sydney, has bought the trot-
ting stallion Era, about the best of the Chiide Harolds,
fora reputed A 650, with the object of taking him to Eng-
land. Go< d boise as Era undoubtedly is, it looks like
taking coals to Newcastle. Mr. BanKlt, a couple of years

mander.

The Australian thoroughbred is much in
evidence in the Slates. Sir Modred loads the winning
stallion list for '94, Cheviot is high up, and Darebin has a
good showing. Empire, a Chester Australian east-off,
won a couple of races recently ; and seventeen Australian
stallions are doing duly in California.

A good little pony named Pickles is now
running on Melb. suburban comsis. He measures about
14 hands, and got a place behind Esau the other day.
Pickles’ owner was ver\ wiol b, declaring that bis pony
bad been blocked, and offend to race Esau for a stake,
the wanner to take both quadrupeds. Will r declined,
however, evidently not thh king it worth W'hile to risk
losing his Newmarket candidate.

A small sporting news-sheet, published in Mel-
bourne, gives away the fact that it is usual for racing
clubs to provide “members of the fourth islate” with
refreshments. And, whereas the Geelong club official
didn’t “dole out ” luncheon tickets to the reporters until
the victuals had been mostly devoured, the representative
of the rag aforesaid paid 2s. for his own tucker and felt
grossly insulted. The self-respect of a pressman who
expects to be fed gratia by ttie mauageuic nt when he
writes a paragraph about a show is a very delicate thing,
and very easily wounded, apparently. Also, his habit of
exposing a bleeding spirit to the world is doosid affecting.

The N.S.W, Royal Agricultural Show adver-
tises a £5O Time Handicap Trot on Easier Monday. As
all the better class of Sydney horses are in w ork for the
event, would it not be a good oppoitunity to give the
trotters another show? Mr. Mm tough’s new course
should be in full swing by Easter, and a handicap with
decent prize money would draw a big entry.

The Y.R.C. stewards marched slowly and

At time of writing the odds against a wet

Wicket-keeper Jarvis is very pleased at his
success in the big matches, more especially as he was evt n
discarded by S.A. selectors last stason. The S.A. team
against Victoria was picked before the Australians re-
turned from America, and M’Kenzie was substituted for
Jarvis, but the former being injured before the match,
Jarvis was picked and gave a brilliant exhibition. S.A.
cricketers aver that he was never in such fettle as he is
now.

Brnnton, South Adelaide wicket-keeper, has a

the pavilion-fence. Brnnton played on !

A Melb. Civil servant has invented a bicycle
which, it is predicted, will revolutionise cycling. In the
new machine the rider sits directly over the pedals, and,
by an ingenious method of gearing and leverage, is en-

hack-kick, which is wasted in the present style of machine.
The hands are also brought into use, the action being
said to resemble that of walking. The inventor is being
backed by some experts who seldom make an error, ai d
patents have been secured throughout the world. Sixty
miles an hour(!) is the rate of speed expected from an
average rider on an ordinary road, while a professional
will give Fortunatus half way and a licking over six fur-

THE RABBIT INVASION!
Melbourne Age of 12th February, 1895, published the following telegram
Albwiy, Monday.—Good evidence is forthcoming that some recent bush fires in the northern part of Riverina
have been occasioned through the ignition of the phosphorus used for rabbit poisoning. A fire which is supposed to
have originated by this means destroyed over 30,000 acres of grass.
TOXA, the only scientific destroying specific, has no inflammable constituents. TOXA WILL NOT

birth, though a white man in other respects, and Corbett

A writer in the Clarion (Eng.) scoffs at the
trash which, as he evidently is not aware, gets cabled to
Australia as E iglish crick't criticism. “Who,” he asks,
“is the invenlive pressman garnishing the reports on this
side of the water ? If the long description of the game
(first test-match 1 which we read in last week’s p ipers are
true reports from Australia, what are we to think of the
gentleman who laid great stress on the fact that M’Laren
and Stoddart a’tered their usual style of baiting to that
of the barn door order, so that the Englishmen might
make a draw of the game? The reporters on the Sydney
side knew that the match would be played out, and this
makes me look with dubious eyes on the descriptions of
the game which appeared in the papers over here.”

Coningham seems to have lost his temper in
the Brisbane mitoh. In some suspects he is a model,
for he neither drinks nor smokes. The Bulletin, by the
way, knows a Sydney man who also, fortunately for him-
self, neither drinks nor smokes—for he has a nasty habit
of biting his thumb till the blood comes if he feels bad
about anything.

It is an established fact that nicotine is
injurious to health, sufficient being contained in
an ordinary cigarette or pipeful of tobacco to
poison a dog. Does it not, therefore, become a
duty to every man to smoke an article that does
not contain nicotine, yet retains all the essential
qna'ities of a fragrant cigar ? Frossard’s Cavour
cigars have the nicotine extracted in vacuo, and
are recommended by the highest authorities as
non injurious. They are sold everywhere in
packets of eight for Is.
At the close of ’93, when the Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of New York totted up accounts, it
found t iat its assets had been increased by about
.£2,0 0,000, its surplus by about <£500,000, and its
income by some .£300,000. At the close of last
year, as the Australian general manager (Major
Rennie) has just learned by special cable, the in-
crease of assets over those of ’93 was more
than .£3,500,000, of surplus nearly .£1,000,000,
and of income <£1,200,000. The figures as they
stood on 1st Jan., ’95, were : Assets, .£42,000,000 ;
surplus, over all liabilities to policyholders
and others. £4,600,000; income, <£9,800,000.
Business muse have hummed with the co. during
’94 to produce such results. An increase of in-
come of nearly a million and a quarter sterling in
a single year is something phenomenal, even for
this leviathan among life insurance offices.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with' weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, wffiich im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham-modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairmenfof the general health. In justice
to this celebrated speclhlist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.

PRICE, £lB.
Wc are prepared to supply Agricultural Implements at prices hitherto unequalled in Queensland
Australia, chewing much meat with false
teeth, is not uninterested in the outward visible
appearance of Edwin Lenthall Oldfield, of Mel-
an accomplished dentist and quite famous
tenor singer. His voice has nothing to do with
the publication of his photo., in this instance.
Mr. Oldfield is figuring just now as the anxious
father of a Dental College and Oral Hospital,
which will also be, according to terms of registra-
tion, “ a charitable institution for the admission,
as in or out patients, of the deserving poor.”
Prior to his election to the conservative Dental
Board of Victoria, this live practitioner sug-
gested, by circular, the scheme he has now
taken in hand. A school of dentistry is
needed in every big city of Australia.
Speaking for his own province, and for
Melbourne in particular, Mr. Oldfield waxes
eloquent upon the theme. Until the year 1887
there was no protection for qualified dentists in
Victoria. Anybody could furnish a small room
with an operating-chair, hang out a colored lamp.

EDWIN LENT HALL OLDFIELD.
and invite the unwary to have first aids to diges-
tion pulled out by the roots. In ’B7 the Dental
Board started with a slop-made Act of Parlia-
ment at its back, and a eertif. of efficiency from
the examining body became the recognised card
of introduction to the profession. Students have
had the University and School of Pharmacy
whereat to run their educational coarse, but the
idea of a Dental College, with clinics, post-
graduate classes, &c., was left for an individual
dentist to introduce. Naturally, Oldfield’s action
has excited snorting comments in certain quarters,
although his claim to do this good thing
for the general good, as well as his own im-
mediate advantage, is beyond question. Standing
in the front rank of his profession, and being
specially esteemed by the medical fraternity, ho
appeared the right man for the work; and, again,
he is in a position to make a success of it. Mr.
Oldfield, some time ago, secured a lease of the
house adjoining his well-known residence, 36
Nicholson-street, Melbourne, and number 34 will
be formally opened, anon, as the Dental College
and Hospital aforementioned. Two gentlemen of
high attainments in the dental and medical pro-
fessions are associated with the founder, so the
College will have a sufficient staff of masters at
the outset. The idea “caught on” as soon as it
came before the public. Mr. Oldfield has already
several students entered for the course of four
years’ training necessary to a pass at the Board’s
exam. Moreover, two or three ladies promptly
tripped into the new college for a twelvemonth
course of tuition in the art of “filling.”
Lovely woman is an important person in
American dentistry. Mr. Oldfield expects to turn
her to as much account here. The feminine hand
deft and steady—not, as a rule, shaken by over-
nightwhiskies-and-soda—and a properly-instructed
vision in an undivided skirt may put gold or silver
into a cavernous tooth as neatly as the best of the
baser animals. Even if the Dental College of
Victoria had no other purpose than the education
of ladies in this branch of the profession it would
fib a long-felt want. The thought of a golden-
haired girl dropping precious metal into one’s
“ toof ” is exceedingly appetising.
At Aden, the water for the poor has
usually to be fetched 28 miles on camel-back. A
lady there lost an ear-ring. It was mysteriously
recovered in possession of an Arab, which led to
the disclosure that her bath-water had been sold
by a servant for poor people to drink.
Melb. Argus remarks of Hon. W. P.
Reeves, of Maorilund, that he “seems to have had
a smattering of education in early life.” Reeves
is a University man, an excellent scholar and no
mean poet. His smattering of education isn’t the
same sort of smattering that the Argus is smat-
tered with. Which makes the Argus wild.
Nothing but dread of the cant-brigade

A new German law decrees that any person

New Sooth Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ;
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to alt md to my business. I tried several doctprs
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
RaSSMUSSEN’S PURELY HERBAL “ ALFALINE
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-

years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

The well-known and popular representative
of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose
testimony carries special weight, writes thus :
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, -I think it my duty to inform you
that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe ease of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours, CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

GREAT SHIPMENT OF
CAMELSI
JUST ARRIVED.
Now on View near Perth .
Pack & Biding Camels of the best Breed,
From
I- LIARAN,
BELUOHISTAN, and
AFGHANISTAN.
Most reliable for carrying and travelling purposes,
unsurpassed by any hitherto imported from India
—real beauties.
These camels are now at Lime Cliff Paddock,
about miles from Subiaco and 3 miles from
Claremont, where they will remain for three
weeks to undergo the necessary quarantine regu-
lations.
They are undergoing one month’s quarantine,
during which period they will be fed on good,
strengthening food, and no expense will be spared.
These are not Calcutta camels—or, rathei, those
that are known as such—but the real Hill breed ;
accustomed to feed on bushes and grass identical
with those of Western Australia; as only used by
the Army Commissariat Department of India,
consequently they can be thoroughly recom-
mended. They are directly shipped from Kurra-
chee, the nearest seaport to Kbaran, Beluchistan
and Afghanistan.
The s.s. Claverley, a first-class steamer, giving
comfortable accommodation to 400 camels, was
chartered for the special purpose of bringing from
Kurrachee these 320 camels. All these camels are
in good condition, as we have taken great trouble,
no expense having been spared by Messrs. D. and
J. Fowler on our behalf.
Diggers and JProspectors are
invited to deal at once.
All telegrams and letters should be addressed
to me at “ Criterion Hotel, Perth,” until further
notice.
For prices and full particulars address—
Capt. 0. DOUGLAS SAUNDERS,
Manager;

Bankers: ... Union Bank, Coolgardie.
N.B. —As these camels are from a cool part of
the East, they will by the time they leave quaran-
tine be in magnificent condition. I insert this as
Indian camels are considered useless by some of
the judges in Coolgardie. This may apply to the
Calcutta camels, but cannot be taken as applying
to Kbaran camels.

‘A GOLDEN
Mr. Fletcher Watson, the popular water-
oolor arttst, lately of' Sydney, writes that he is
progressing fast in England, and has been elected
a member of many societies. He' is represented
in the Academy this year.
A digester, a huge boiler containing 200
carcases of sheep, exploded at a Deniliquin boii-
ing-dbwn works the other day, and distributed
about two tons of stewed mutton over the district.
The oldest inhabitant was heard to remark that
he never before witnessed such a sud'den rise and
fall in mutton. The dogs of Deniliquin have
since developed quite a religious strain, and sit
on their tails, looking heavenward with the devo-
tion of saints.
A Rangiora (M.L.) publican recently said
a glass of beer to a travelling saint on a bicycle,
w f ho thereupon laid an information against him,
for ‘‘supplying a man who was already under the
influence of liquor.” The publican’s defence was
that the cyclist showed no signs of liquor, but the
man on the spidery wheel swore that he was drunk,
and pointed out that he was in a better position
to know that he was drunk than the publican to
know that he wasn’t. The court finally decided
that a man was the best judge of his own drunk-
enness, and fined the miserable grog-merchan'
10s.
The Colonial Sugar Co. and Queensland
planters generally look with dislike and fear at
the increase in the number of co-operative mills
which are threatening to compete for their profits.
The Sugar Co. has once more substantially reduced
the price of sugar, doubtless partly with the view
of frightening off small capitalists ; and an agita-
tion is now proceeding to hinder further Govern-
ment subsidies from being granted to co-operators,
on the ground that the export margin will shortly
be reached and the trade made profitless. Bluff 1
Conan Doyle, the physician and novelist,
thinks that brain-paralysis will be the horror of
the future. - Scientists are learning how to tackle
almost all the especially fatal diseases of the pre-
sent and the past, but no one has made any pro-
gress worth speaking of in dealing with paralysis,
which keeps steadily increasing as other horrors
diminish. Paralysis is the disease that you get
through long and agonising research after ways of
curing other diseases. It comes on the man who
lives in a rush all the days of his life to get out a
paper, and the man who has a diseased bank
weighing on his mind, and the man who totters
under too much dead weight of learning, and the
man who invents new things and new ideas, and
the man who hustles generally. Nobody knows
exactly what causes it, but it seems to arise from too
much hustling as often as from any other cause.
Paraflysis is one of the consequences of success, and
what shall It profit a man if he discovers a dozen
entirely new microbes, or gets his paper to press in
good time every night for 20 years, when at last
he finds his speech beginning to get thick, and ho.
has to stop every now and then because lie can’t
find the word that he wants, and he has a sensa-
tion as if the top ofdiis head was lighter than the
lower part of it, and his tongue has an enlarged
and helpless feeling in ins mouth, and lie begins
to write “ by sound,” so that when he wants to
set down “ beginning ” he, as likely as not, writes
“ gehenna” simply because the two words have a
faint resemblance to one another? Then if he
has any one dependent upon him, about the only
thing that is left for him to do is to insure his
life as often as possible, and to appomt a peepect-
able trustees co. as his executors, and sell his
bank shares for whatever they will fetch to save
his widow from calls. And after that he can lie
back and reflect that he is going to end ins days
as a patient idiot smiling at all the world, with
an attendant to wash him because he won’t know
how to wash himself,..and to prevent him wander-
ing peacefully into the dust-bin, and to bring him
in out of the wet.
Sydney “In Memoriam” notice:-
Farewell, dearest mother, from us thou art gone;
cold hand hath snatched thee away.
Thy pain and thy trouble now end in the tomb ;
For in peace you are suffered to lay.
We have often wondered where the high-toned
boarding-house eggs came from.

" It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength. ’’
"If every mother knew of
Its value no other would be
used.”

When a Salvation Army lass died recently
in a M.L. town, the local paper innocently came
out with this: “The funeral is noticeable as the
first Salvation one that has occurred in this town.
Let us hope it will not be the last.”
At a meeting of the Science Association in
Brisbane, it was stated in a paper by a member
that slaves are transhipped at Singapore and sent
off to Java and Borneo—aforesaid proceedings
taking place under the supervision and surveil-
lance of British naval authorities.
W. Errington, C.E., who constructed the
first locomotive ever built in Victoria, died the
other day in Auckland, M.L. Errington designed
t le two graving-docks in Auckland Harbor, one
of which, said to be the deepest in the world, is
now used chiefly as a swimming-bath.
On Queensland communal settlements the
cost of living has certainly attained the irreducible
minimum. Under the care of a paternal Govern-
ment it is down to Is. per week per man.
The minimum for paupers “in English workhouses
is put at 2s. 6d. per head per week.
Northern sugar-lands are wonderfully rich.
Land on the Burnett has produced cane for nearly
20 years in succession. Innisfail, on the John-
stone, has raised cane for 13 consecutive years.
Last year the land lay fallow, and the crop this
year is rich enough to have sprubg from virgin
soil.
The business of the suburban police-court
o Esse idon (Melb.) had to be adjourned the other
day, because the chairman only turned up, and
the police failed to find a second beak in any of
the “ likely places.” The same trouble couldn’t
ar.se in connection with a. certain court nearer the
heart of Melbourne, whose magistrates, or some
of them, attend “likely places” at given times for
the purpose of receiving likely visitors.
A wife giving evidence lately in a main-
tenance-case tried in a N.S. W. police-court, stated
that she told her mother-in-law, when she was
beating one of her (the wife’s) children, that the
child was not to be knocked about, as “ it was of
honorable birth.” “ And why did you say that ?”
asked defendant’s solicitor. “ Because it was
more than my husband could boast of,” was the
reply. A neat and effectual way of making things
sultry for husband and mother-in-law in one act.

A Maoriland inventor named Jones lately
discovered an instantaneous and infallible cure for
burns and scalds. He got together an audience of
about 50 people in a paddock at Mas ter ton, and
after lecturing on his antidote he dipped his hand
into a pot of boiling water. Then amid his howls
of anguish he applied the remedy, but it didn’t
produce any effect, and three medical men had to
hold him down and dress his injuries. Strangely
enough the badly-scalded Jones still believes in
his discovery, and is going to give another exhibi-
tion. True faith endures even though boiling-
w iter is thrown over it.

“Her Majesty the Queen is being urged
to try the new treatment for reducing weight. As
is well known, the Queen has almost entirely lost
the power of walking, owing, to a great extent, to
ley increasing stoutness, and it is thought that, if
thi ■ could be reduced, she would regain the use of
her limbs. The necessary regimen has nothing in
c 'inmon with the ordinary Banting or dietetic
c lies, but consists merely in taking a certain
animal preparation in the form of tabloids. In
the case of the Prince of Wales, the treatment has
been successful H.R.H. having, it is said, got rid
of 2it. of his adipose tissue in the space of a fort-
night.’ In plain English : “ Queen Victoria, now
too fat to walk, will try thyroid tablets, which
took 2st. off Albert Edward in two weeks.” Always

A NEW VIRTUE
Has been discovered in
♦Vliich will be welcomed by all who regularly
keep it in their houses ; in the first syniptons of
Influenza, some Homocca, quantity immaterial,
applied in the nostrils has been found to check
the further spread of this distressing malady,
and in a very few hours the system is
able to eject the infect'on and prevent further
mischief.
It will stop a painful Influenza
cold almost like magic.
tv-
%
IM
1
A cold begins with inflammation of the memura-
r.eous lining of the intricate little passages of the
l ose (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
nail scale). Homocea at once subdues the in-
.lammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
thieving the feeling of stuffiness.” Moreover, it
terms a protective covering for the delicate mem-
wane, and prevents cold air, fog, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play.
Not much is known about the way in which influ-
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
H omocea may, therefore, be confid n t!y recomended
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
Stiff Joints, Pains in the Back, Lumbago,
Strained Muscles, Cramps, can be got rid
of at once by Homocea, which instantly
touches the spot afflicted. Homocea as a
pain relieving, soothing, and curative
lubricant has no equal in the world of
healing remedies; it is a specific for
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Pa-
ralysis, Convulsions, Bruises, Strained
Muscles, Pains in the Joints, Aches and
Sprains, Eczema, Burns, Tooth-ache,
Face-ache, Chilblains, Piles, Boils,
Ulcers, Stings, Chaps, and all kindred ills
and complaints.
Henry M. Stanley writes: “Whitehall.
London. Dear Sir, Your ointment called
‘ Homocea ’ was found to be the most soothing
and efficacious unguent that I could possibly
have for my fractured limb, as it seems to retain
longer than any other, that oleaginousness so
requisite for perfect and efficient massage. The
fault of embrocations generally, is that they
harden and require warmth, whereas yours,
besides being particularly aromatic, is as soft as
oil, and almost instantly mollifying in the casr
of severe inflammation.
“ Yours faithfully, Henry M. Stanley ’’

The statistics of gold movements lately pub-
fised have given unwelcome confirmation to the beliefs of
Vic. banks in the existence of private hoarding. Melb.
itea published the following return on the subject
Mint issues: £ £

It has hern assumed that this balance unaccounted for
has all gone into private hoards—it will be seen lower
down that certain di duet ions have to be taken into con-
sideration. As, however, private hoarding ha* been of
longer continuance than the Age suspects, it happens
that the figures are not far from what appears to be the
truth. As a preliminary to this enquiry the figures
should be tabulated of—
(а) Coin issued from mint and imported into province.
(б) Coin exported or officially withdrawn from circu-
lation.

Comparing the figun s for the 16 years ended 1888, we
have: —
1873-88 .. Coined and imported .. 39,446,077
Exported and withdrawn .. 33,882,-164
5,563,613
Of this amount £2,500,000 can be accounted for by the
increased Bank holdings. The remaining, say, £'3,100,000
may be treated as the nminal “disappearance” in 16
years. Much of this would be taken away by passengers
to other provinces and to foreign parts, some would go
into ordinary ■< insulation, and some would be privately-
melted by jewellers, &c., &c. It must be recollected,
however, that the ordinary shipments by banks, shipping
agents, Chinese merchants, and so on, are accounted for
among the exports.
As regards the 1889-94 period, an amount of
£1,750,000 is accounted for by the increase that has
occurred in the bank cash reserves. An allowance should
also he made for increase in the circulation of sovereigns,
consequent on the unpopularity of bank-notes since the
crisis. It is also douhthss true that during the crisis,
and during the exodus to Westralia, specially large
amounls were carried away by passengers (in th"ir
luggage, in lieu of drafts. With due consideration for
such deductions, the private hoards may' now be cal-
culated.

The amount of Victorian private hoardings at the
present moment, then fore, reaches the extraordinary
amount of £2,600,000 —and may well strike awe into
the soul of him who speaks of “ returning confidence.”
Very little of this hoarding appears to belong to ’94—it. is
carried overfrom ’93—and it may he seriously doubted that
any of the hoards will be return'd to the present banks
in til" present condition of affairs. The total reserves of
coin a- d bullion held by Vic. banks on 31st Dec. last were
£8,337,959, being abnormally large as some preparation
against surprise—but the private hoardings amount to 31
percent, of this sum! It is stated that the Australian
banks have to find £35,000,000 before the end of the cen-
tury, and in the interval before the State Bank comes, or,
at any rate, till the thirty-five millions are paid, it may
be safely anticipated that hoardings will increase.

Australasia’s two land-grant railways—the Mid-
land • *f Westralia and the other Midland which Stout and
Vogel fixed on the unfortunate population of Maoriland—
continue to muddle along wretchedly to very little pur-
pose. The Westralian Co. is now floating a third loan by
way of mortgage on its little streak of unfinished rails;
the first loan was guaranteed by the W.A. Government,
and the other ranked as a second mortgage on the pro-
perty, but the new one is now to be considered the second
mortgage, and the old second mortgage becomes a third
lien on the co.’s rather shadowy security. Most of the
time and the spare cash of the Westralian Midland O.
seem now to be spent in operations for raising more
loans, and the line itself makes very slow and expensive
progress. The Midland of Maoriland, after long negotia-
tions, many bitter quarrels, and many attempts to induce
the Govt, to guarantee its loans, or to hand over land
before the work specified in the contract is accomplished,
has now, by virtue of a clause in the agreement, gone to
arbitration. A huge bill for law-expenses is therefore in-
evitable, and if the award goes against the Government it
will probably cost Maoriland more to leave the railway-
unbuilt than it would have cost to build it in the ordinary
fashion. The Midland Oo., of Maoriland, did very little of
the work it promised to do, and got various small con-
cessions in the early days of the enterprise, but it con-
tinued to leave the work undone and to ask for more con-
cessions until Parliament decided that it wanted the
earth, and swore-off future negotiations. The W.A.
Parliament will also come to the swearing-off stage by and
by. These two experiments with the land-grant railway
curse should satisfy the people of Australasia for all time.

Many sad or romantic sequels have followed the
Wairarapa disaster, but until now no one thought that it
would cause the wreck of a big business concern. One
of the saved passengers was insured in a certain
Accident Insurance Co. His claim, £20 clrl, for injuries,
medical attendance, &c., was admitted by the co., which,
on application, paid £5 on account. Nothing could extract
the balance —indeed, the co.’s manager expressed disgust
at pressure being exercised for the balance, inasmuch as
(so he said) the claimant “ wasn’t hard-up, as he had seen
him in the street dressed in the height of fashion, wearing
a gold chain and tan boots.” A writ was issued, served,
and judgment got, but the execution was defeated on the
ground that there was nothing seizable in the office, there
being £600 owing for rent alone. If half the co.’s liabili-
ties were to mature in 12 months it would be liable for
a million.

A Vic. hotelkeeper, whose good nature brought
him into insolvency, staggered the newly-fledged lawyer
(who accused him,during bankiup toy examination, of avoid-
ing service of a writ) by retorting: “ You must be very
young, my dear sir, and very green at your business, if
you don’t know that for 12 months prior to my insolvency
I specially set Mondays apart for the reception and
recording of writs, summonses, and the like, and that on
no other day could 1 devote time to the tremendous rush
of business with which exjei ienced solicitors invariably
favored me on that particular day.” He had had 137
writs and over 100 summonses in one year.

big biz. has to be shown for that.

Some day Australia will wake up with a pain in
its Treasury chest to find that it has been done once more
—by stamp-forgers this time. Sheets of stamps will
arrive from parts unknown, and will not be marked

N.S.W. law-courts are unsettled as to what

another gave judgment with 8 per cent., while two or

Messrs. Pitt, Son, and Badgery, of Sydney,
furrjish an interesting return showing the sources of
Britain’s meat-supply. In 1881, Australia furnished a J I
the frozen mutton sent to England. In ’B2 Maoriland
chipped.in, and last year sent over two million carcases,
equal to half the total supply. Australia, with five times
as many sheep, sends only 900,000 carcases. Queensland
has made a vigorous grab for the frozen beef trade, and,
though it only started in ’B9, it sent 15,000 tons last year,
while N.S. Wales sent 850 tons.

That Australian squattocraoy is very much

That gorgeous specimen “from the Shamrock,

Under the present competitive system wages
filter through the carbon of necessity, and there is no
bedrock except zero. Some portions of the contracts for
N.S.W. Government buildings have been sub-let over and
over again to the fourth starving contractor, until the
wages paid to carpenters were from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per day.
Thus £lOO worth of contract-work would be sub-let by A
to B for £BO ; from B to C for £6O ; from O to D for £5O ;
and from Dto E for £4O. E has to make £4O pay him for
his material, his time, hia paid labor and his own profit.
So he roots among the “ scab ” carpenters and pays them
2s. a day each, instead of 10s. or 12s. 6d., and keeps them
up to the mark as far as he can by working alongside of
them and “shouting” an occasional beer. All the
“hidden” work is scamped, while the outside makes a
fair show. If the £4O job doesn’t pan out as he expected
—E “slips up” his men for the balance of wages due,
and either absents himself from his haunts, or goes in-
solvent, or “gets robbed,” or has a “sick wife” and
“doctor’s bills,” or anything. D makes £lO without
putting a tap to the work, and with the chance of dodging
E without even paying him, if it suits his hook ; O makes
£lO, with similar side-ohanoes ; B makes £2O and A £2O.

“ Administrative guile is suspected of keeping
back the Duff Dibbs correspondence demanded by Parlia-

thing done ? About 1887, Gillies being then Premier, &0.,
the Vic. Parliament ordered that a return be compiled of
diamond-drill expenditure, distinguishing districts. The
return when completed showed Ballarat district to be
easily ahead, Colonel Smith, one of the members, being at
the time in prominent opposition. It was put to Gillies
that Mr. (now Farthing) Fink, Ministerial M.P. for Mary-
borough, would hebraicalb' snort if he saw how his dis-
trict had been deserted for Radical Ballarat. Neither
Fink nor Parliament ever saw the return.

A London city paper is responsible for the state-

Apropos a recent imposing Sydney cere-

A newspaper-proprietor, lately offered an
Australian serial story for his “great weekly,”
said: “Who’ll read it? I don’t buy a pig in a
poke.” “ I suppose your editor could look through
it,” was the reasonable suggestion. “He has
plenty to do ; besides, there are not three editors
in Australia fit to judge a serial story in manu-
script. Every time it has been done for me I’ve
been sorry before the tale finished. No ; I prefer
taking my serial matter from syndicates, and not,
as you may think, because I get it cheaper, but
because I get it from people upon whose judgment
I can rely. Why don’t Australian authors get in
with the syndicates? I’d rather take yours than
the work of a stranger : but I must obtain it
through an experienced and approved source.”
There is only one N.S. Wales (licensed)

In a Melbourne court, recently, a witness,

where he would go when he died. Whereupon
David Gaunson got up and stated that he didn’t
know where he would go either. The Bulletin
now gets up to state that it also doesn’t know
where D. Gaunson will go. It has certain grave
suspicions, that is all.
Dear Bulletin, —Re the man who learnt
brewing from books, what is shallower than the
sneer at “book-knowledge?” What could one
man’s experience do, unassisted by the accumu-
lated experience of his fellows; and what are
books but the store-houses of that experience?
Individual theoretical knowledge should be sup-
plemented by individual practical experiment.
True —but what, after all, is individual theoretical
knowledge but the practical experience of many ?
—collected in books from all the world and all the
ages? The fallacy is akin to that which would
make “head-work” a thing apart. AH work is
head-work—the greater contains the less 1 Stun

skull, and how much muck will he shift till the
head has resumed operations ? — Heretic,

S. E. Gregory began real cricket with the
Oriental Club, one of the crack juniors. He was
then only 16, and was given a chance at the re-
commendation of Donnan, who thought well of
him as a bowler. The other members of the club
did nob expect much from the diminutive young-
ster, bub in his first match (against Double Bay
Club), Gregory, bowling slow leg-breaks, (“whir-
lies ”), took six wickets for 23. Playing with the
Orientals he developed his bowling and fielding,
but for a long time gave no promise of becoming a
great batsman. He joined the Sydney Club with
Donnan, became a remarkable field, and began
batting. Donnan, his mentor, was at this time
going great guns in interprovincial cricket-
had been playing it from ’87 —and in ’B9
had gained the premiership with an average
of 72. It was in ’89 —this year of Donnan’s—■
that Gregory first played interprovincially.
The ’9O team for England was being selected.
Ten men were chosen ; they voted unanimously
for Donnan. Ti.is was at night, when it was tov*
late to apprise Donnan by wire. In the morning,
the two members who were going to telegraph had
a confab, which resulted in wiring for Gregory.
The rest of the team were dumbfounded when
Gregory joined them on the ship for England.
He had been put in as a draw—he was a fair
bat, very little, and wonderful in the field.
Many people say it was Gregory’s English
trip that made him what he is—perhaps the
most dexterous of living batsmen. Gregory’s
luck has fallen upon an enterprising young
Sydney man who has dared to make bats
himself in competition with the oldest English
firms. The bat which Gregory holds is a present
from this Sydney maker. Gregory tried it in
practice, liked it exceedingly, scored 201 (not out)
with it, the first time he used it, in the match
against the combined country team. Donnan,
who used a bat by the same maker, in the same
match, also scored 201 (not out). Gregory has
gone on this season making wonderful scores with
the new bat : 201 (not out), 153 (not out), 87, 201
(in the first test-match). 101 against Melbourne,
when the rest of the team succumbed, 42, and
minor scores; in all, 855, giving an average of
85.5 per innings. Iredale, Callaway, Turner,
Bannerinan and Mackenzie have each a bat by the
same maker. Ha is Mr. A. Dye, of 41 Cleve-
land-street, Redfern, Sydney.

Judas: A Strike Incident .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Judas ! lloi'o ho comes—“ Judas, the
traitor !”
He passed among them with downeast head,
glancing fearfully from side to side at the
ominous, lowering faces. All reviled him; the
women spat upon him; several of the men
attempted to strike him. It was all the two
policemen could do to save him from the fury of
the crowd. Presently stones began to fly. Most
of them passed wide of the mark, but one of them
found its billet. He reeled as the missile struck
him, and then recovering himself, ,he broke from
his escort, and rushed wildly down the narrow
street, followed by a shower of stones and curses,
and the execrating shouts of “Judas 1 Judas 1”
• • •
It was the time of a great strike. The
strikers knew not the curse of their heritage as
they battled against starvation with ever-
dwindling strength.
Itwvas reserved for one man to bring it home to
them —one of their own number—a traitor—
Judas ! He was the first to fail, as he had been
the last to join them. In going back to the yoke
and pittance, he paved the way for others to
follow, one by one, until it seemed as if the"long
slow weeks of suffering and self-sacrifice had been
once more in vain.
Can you wonder that they hated him ? And
the Law of the land—the Law which put forth all
its powers to thrust them back into the abyss—
can you wonder that they hated that too, and
rebelled against it ?
And he, the traitor? Ah, those are not merely
the execrations of a handful of betrayed brethren
that greet him to-night: they are the voices of un-
born generations which send up, as lie slinks along,
that universal shout of “Judas ! Judas 1”
* * •
Later he stands hatless, beneath a lamp in
the deserted street. His faoe is covered with
blood where the stone struck him. He has had
more than one bitter experience this evening.
Soon after he escaped from his pursuers he stag-
gered, sick and faint, into a hotel. The bur was
filled with men, many of whom were strikers,
though he failed to notice them till it was too late
to retreat. He reeled to the counter.
“ Gave me some brandy, quick,” he said, “ for
the love of God ! ”
The bottle was passed to'him in silence. The
room had been filled with clamour when lie
entered ; now an ominous silence prevailed. He
would have given worlds to search the assemblage
for one pitying, relenting face ; but be dared not
lift his eyes. He hastily swallowed the spirit and
thrust a coin across the counter. Then a voice
was heard.
“ What, Hennelly, would you touch his cursed
silver—blood-money! ”
The publican hesitated. His sympathies were
with the men ou strike, yet lie could not help
feeling some faint sense of pity for the abject
wretch before him. But pity at times is a non-
p tying sentiment. He flicked the coin back
it 'am.
“ No,” he said, “he has had the drink; but I
will not touch his money ! ”
“Curse you!” cried the hunted wretch, as he
shivered theglass upon the floor. “Oh, curse you
all !’’ and he rushed Jrom the place, followed by
derisive laughter.
He is recalling the scene now, as he stands
beneath the street-lamp, with the rain pattering
upon his uncovered head.
“My God!” he cries, “I cannot stand this
much longer.
• # •
Later still. He is walking, he knows not
whither, although the street seems familiar. In
truth he is close to the factory. Suddenly he
hears a sound of sobbing. A child—a little boy—
is crouched against the fence, crying bitterly.
“ What is the matter?” he asks.
The child tells him—he is lost.
“ Come with me,” he says ; “ I will take you
home.” He knows the boy—for over twelve
months he worked alongside his father in the
factory.
The child gives his hand trustingly, and they go
on together. A little further on he stops to look
at his watch, and the boy gets a glimpse of his
face.
Instantly the child endeavours to wrest himself
free, at the same time crying out, in terror, “ Let
me go ! let me go 1”
“ What is the matter ?” he asks. “ Come with
me ; I will take you home.”
“No, no,” exclaims the child, beating frantically
the detaining hand, “not with you —I know you.
You are Judas!”
Instantly he releases the boy.
“ Even the children !” he groans. “ Oh, God, I
am heavily punished!”
* * »
He is at the door of his lodgings. Although
it is very late now, there is a faint light within.
He ope.ns the door softly and enters. As he is
passing up the passage, the door of the sitting-
room opens and his landlady calls him.
“ I have been waiting up for you, sir,” she says
as a beginning. “ I am very sorry to have to do
anything unpleasant ; you have been near two
years now in my house, sir, but I must give you
warning. You see, sir,” she went on, seeing that
be was about to speak, “ it’s the other boarders.
They’ve heard about you going back to the
factory, and to-night they all came to me and
said that thfey would not live in the same house
as a ‘scab,’ and that if you did not go to-night
they would all leave in the morning ; and so you
see, sir, I could do nothing else except to ask you,
althpugh I am sorry to lose you,,!if
“To-night!” he said, bitterly, “they are in a
hurry—to night ! ”
“If you please, sir, that’s what they said, and
if you could make it convenient to go, sir—.there
is that little matter of arrears, we would call that
square.”
“Very well,” he said, turning on his heel
abruptly, “I will think over it.”
“To-night!” he muttered, as ho lit the candle
in his own room ; “ to-night ! Ah well, as well
to-night as to-morrow, or the next day.”
« * •
In Hie morning a small crowd gathered in
the street, discussing the news.
“Poor fellow !” said a woe-begone woman who
was nursing a wan and woe-begone infant; “ poor
fellow ! ”
“ Fom pity him !” exclaimed a man at her side ;
“only for him we should have won. As it is—
look at me, look at yourself, look at the child,
half-starved now, and likely to be whole-starved
soon, thanks to him —and you pity him !”
And one by one the crowd took the question
up, and discussed it; for by this time the news
was generally known.

Dear Bulletin, —If 12 tons 15ewt. is the

Dear Bulletin, —You think a J.P. should
“ pay for the honor.” Well, some of them do. I
know one elderly, honorary magistrate of rather
more than ordinary intelligence who is much in
request. Whenever the sergeant of police at a
township 13 miles away wires for hi,m he has to
start off so as to reach the place by 10 a.m. Being
a business man, he must either close his shop or
pay someone to look after it.for him. Then when
he reaches the township he is often-detained by
his magisterial duties till sor 6 p,m. He has to
pay hotel expenses for himself and a pair of horses,
and to risk a smash by driving home along an
imperfectly-cleared bush-track at night.— Justice.
As a general average, 8000 persons disap-
pear yearly in various parts of the British empire,
and are never seen or heard of again. This makes
no allowance for the class whose disappearances
pass unnoticed, because they have no friends ; it
deals only with people who vanish from their
homes, and are sought after more or less diligently,
yet concerning whom neither a footprint, nor an
echo, nor a conjecture is ever found. No spookist
ever raises the ghost of one of these persons, and
gets from him an account of how he stepped out
over the rim of the earth and fell into space, or
how he walked up into the atmosphere and didn’t
come down again, or how he turned the corner of
time and marched straight into eternity with his
boots on. It sets one thinking of the weird theory
of a “ disappearance disease,” which has no
symptoms,' or degrees, or outward signs, and
which, when it comes to a climax, simply abolishes
the patient and his clothes and boots and carpet-
bag, all in an instant, so that you see him for one
moment on a ladder and the next you see an empty
ladder and a falling paint-pot, and nothing more.
Meanwhile, by way of postscript, The Bulletin
cordially suggests that Parkes should disappear—
that he should go out of N.S.W. Assembly House
some sunny afternoon, just for a moment, and
vanish away at the door as utterly as if he had
never existed, leaving only a poem on the door-
step as a sign that he had been there. It would
be a romantic ending to the old man’s career. To
grow old and querulous and out-of-date is common-
place. To die in the ordinary fashion is still more
commonplace—everybody does it. But to evapo-
rate suddenly and utterly is novel and weird and
romantic. People have searched for Leichhardt’s
bones for half a century simply because he dis-
appeared, and they would hunt for Parkes’ bones,
in all probability, for twice as long. And, on the
other hand, if he dies in the ordinary way, inside
of five years nobody will remember that he ever
had any bones at all.
Editor Bulletin.— Sir, — Be your article
“A State Grog - Department.” I have been
both a licensed merchant and a brewer. The
general public have little idea of the wretched
stuff sold them in the name of wines, spirits and
beer. Sixty years ago you could buy good, still
peat-reek whisky for about Bs. a gallon ; now
you have to pay something like 255. for so-called
Scotch wfrisky which is, in many eases, neither
more nor less than raw grain or potato spirit kept
in sherry butts. Irish whisky never pretended to
be distilled from malt, but it is, on the
average, a purer spirit and generally well
matured. Rum is more easily adulterated per-
haps than any other liquor. One gallon of good
over proof West India rum, with the addition of
chemicals such as gum catechu, burnt sugar
and potato-spirit can, by manipulation, be made
into five gals. There are hundreds of ways of
adulterating brandy. Gin or geneva used to be
made of rye flavored with juniper-berries. Now
it is potato-spirit and turpentine. “ Londqn
gin ” is, on the average, perfect rot-gut. The ale
and beer served out is said to be made from
pure malt and hops. It is but rarely any-
thing of the kind. Sugar, or saccharin, made
from beets, turnips, and carrots, is largely used.
And “ hops -substitute ” takes the place of
hops. This is largely manufactured in England.
I was once agent for an English maker of this
material, which was used extensively in Liverpool
and the neighbourhood. Did you ever see the
stuff called “finings” that many of the brewers
put into the casks as they leave the brevrery ? It is
of the colour and consistency of dog’s-vomit, and
is made from hoofs, horns, and sinews of animals.
If you saw it put in you would never have a
“ long-sleever ” again.-— ZoziMUS (Tas.).
The Anarchist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dawn hangs heavy on the distant hill,
The darkness shudders slowly into light;
And from the weary bosom of the night
The pent winds sigh, then sink with horror still.
Naked and grey, the guillotine stands square
Upon the hill, while from its'base the crowd
Surges out far, and waits, to silence cowed.
Impatient for the thing to happen there.
Listen ! The bells within the tower toll
Five naked notes ; and down within his cell
The prisoner hears and mutters : “ It is well.”
Tho’, like that other knife, each cuts his soul.
His sick nerves from the probing echoes shrink.
“This is the end,” he says ; “ let me be strong ;
Let me be brave till then—’tis not for long;
I must not think of it—l must not think 1”
See, thro’ the courtyard guarded, comes the slight,
Thin figure of the anarchist. ■ Amazed
He sees the thousand faces swiftly raised;
The billows of the crowd break into white.
One narrow, alien glance below, and then
The scene fades dimly from his film-glazed eyes;
And, shuddering, he sees his past arise—
The cycle of his life begins again.
And, as misshapen memories crowd fast
Upon him, jostling in unholy strife,
Athwart the dull, drab level of his life
Stand sharply out the blood-stains of his past!
His youth, before he knew he had it, lost.
His father’s body by an accident
’Neath the rich man’s remorseless mill-wheels
pent—
A corpse ; and sister, mother, brother tossed
Out to the mercy of the merciless !
His stricken mother next, her humble niche
Was needed by the reckless and the rich ;
And death was easier than life’s loneliness.
His sister, she had fortune in her face—
She won it, too, till vice’s fingers tore
The freshness from her figure, and no more
In idleness she flaunted her disgrace.
He lost her, stifled in the world’s wide smother,
For years ; till one night on the street they met:
She seized him —he can feel that hot thrill yet !
She spoke him—knowing not he was her brother !
Wrong reeking of the rich incessantly !
Oppression and oppression o’er again !
Till from the smouldering hate within his brain
Mad fever fired the fuse of Anarchy !
Then plot and cunning, weak, futile and mean,
The maddened one against the many, thus—
He strove to strangle Order’s octopus—■
He gained the goal at last—the guillotine !
It waits him grim and grey ; he sees it not,
Nor hears the rising murmur ripple out
To the crowd’s edge, and, turning, die in doubt;
The vague, uncertain future threatens —what?
What, shall he speak, fling out his last reply?
Why waste the time in trivialities?
One throbbing thought now holds him ; and
there is
No room for sign or speech—he has to die !
Swift are the too-few preparations made ;
The block is waiting, waits the eager knife.
And for the last few minutes of his life
All facts but that life’s ending from him fade !
Only a murmur wavers up and shakes
The sullen air, then hesitates and dies.
And the grim hush of horror stifled lies,
Suspended like a billow ere it breaks.
One bitter prayer, half-curse, he mutters when
The knife hangs high abot'e, and the world
waits,
And e’er it swoops an age it hesitates ;
The word is given, breaths are drawn, and then—
With eyes and soul close shut (be swift, relief!)
The prisoner waits the end that does not come.
For hark! that heavy, low, tumultuous hum
That surges, surges till it shouts “Reprieve !’’
“ Reprieved and pardoned !” All his senses swim
In one rose-mist. As Sleep’s soft hand that
soothes
The tense, strained limbs of fevered day, and
smoothes
Life’s knotted nerves-so comes release to him.!
Refreshed he wakes. His weary soul*, set free,
Was flung out far, and for a minute’s space,
Had seen the sadness of God’s silent face —
The mighty calm of immortality.
How like a triumph his home-coming ! Then
The glorious news that mpthira, how that Right
Had routed Wrong, for ever faction’s figjit
Was finished, and the world was one !
Then swiftly, through his swimming, mist-dimmed
eyes,
He sees the good and great uprise again ;
And reason rings the knell of grief and pain;
The gladdened new world lapped in sunlight lies.
Long life was his with honor. On fame’s breath
His name was borne, until in perfect peace—
Glad like a mellow fruit to fall and cease—
His long life ripened richly into death.
But none knew this but he. The crowd still wai ts ;
Shoots swift the lightning of the knife, and loud
Roars the hoarse thunder from the sated crowd;
And justice has been done !
God compensates.

Melb. Arous unearths the fact tjhat Barren
Carrington, when at - college, could drink a bottle
of Bordeaux in the shortest time on record. At a
drinking competition the intellectual peer held the
bottle vertically over his speaking yawn and
swallowed the contents in 11 seconds. The next
fastest drinker took 15 secs. If Carrington is on
for another competition The Bulletin knows a
Chinaman who will sup a bottleful of wine out of
a bowl, with two bits of stick, and give the Barren
—also with two bits of stick—30 secs, start.
Stakes, .£1000. Money and Chinaman will be
produced at this office.
The Haunted House .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no question that the house was
queer and weird and ghastly. Not only have I
seen it with my waking eyes, but in my dreams it
has come to me and mademe tremble. It was built of
ordinary rough red-pine boards and its foundations
consisted of silver-pine piles, driven deep into the
shingle bed of the creek that flowed directly
before the door. The creek-banks were steep, and
composed of walls of bluish-grey sandstone, 30ft.
high. The tall, straggling edifice clung to those
walls like the vine to its trellis, and reached the
top and towered one storey over the plateau,
across whieh wound the road. The surprise of
the traveller was extreme when an examination of
the place revealed a building 50ft. in height.
The rooms were as uncanny as the house.
Every room was a square. There were four
squares on each flat. In the floor of each room,
excepting those on the base, was a square aperture
just sufficient to allow an erect human figure to
pass. Each aperture had in its corner a rope reach-
ing to the floor below. These served for descent.
There were no staircases, but on each landing was
a portable ladder. Grooves and chocks fixed in
the floor made the ladder available for ascent.
Myriad half-inch cracks, as if economy in timber
had been a primary consideration, admitted day-
light through the floors, and in the wet season
transmitted rain vertically from room to room.
The owner of this eerie pile was mad as they
make them. None dared call upon him ; but when
the sun had set, the passing digger, pipe in mouth,
would pause to hearken to the dweller in the
abode of ghosts. Curious rumbles would be heard,
varied from time to time by hoarse shrieks, hor-
rible imprecations, and hideous, mocking laughter.
Suddenly the voice would be toned down to soft,
mellow, tremulous cadences ; these would be sup-
planted by wild gyrations that sent a thrill through
the listener akin to the shiver which appals
the passenger when the captain has wrecked the
ship. Also, there were swishing noises as of
bodies sliding down at reduced rates of friction,
and the heavier draggings of more cumbersome
materials; and interspersed with these weird sounds
were certain mighty bangs and crashes.
• # »
In the spring of ’73, a short man with a
fringe of white hair round his chin and other
appearances indicating an age of well-nigh sixty
years, advanced resolutely up the creek. His
movements were not sprightly, but there was a
sternness in his every motion not characteristic of
the aimless wayfarer.
“ And so,” soliloquised the traveller as he came
opposite the Haunted House, “ this is the resi-
dence of my mad brother.” Walking swiftly
over a long but very slightly graded plank he.
reached the lower door and knocked, but there was
no answer. He went through the rooms on the
ground floor. They were empty, but he heard a
thud overhead that made him wince. Catching
the ladder he gained the first flight.
Again that awful thud. Soon he was on the
second landing. Bending over one of the aper-
tures was the brother of 30 years ago engaged in
pushing an oil-drum through it. Down it went
and resounded on the floor below. A maniacal
laugh followed. The next instant the lunatic was
clasped in his brother’s arms.
» « »
“ Yes,” said the exultant madman, “ I
caught him—l killed him, the real murderer, the
scoundrel who got me transported 30 years ago for
the murder of the brewer at Coope’s. I put his
bones, after I had boiled him, into that'drum. I
flattened the projecting neck and riveted all
together. I built this place on purpose. For 20
years I have been happy dashing those bones from
room to room.”
“ My God ! ” exclaimed the other in tones of
horror, “you killed the wrong man—you have
dashed the bones of an inngcent person. The
real criminal was the husband of Isabel.”
The insane brother passed his hand over his
forehead, as if feeling for a tangible junction of
hair-roots and brain, and said, with curious logic :
“Doesn’t matter a damn—l wanted compensa-
tion—l thought her brother was the murderer,
apd that he blamed me to prevent our marriage.
Perhaps this brute was worse than the villain she
married ; who knows ?”
« # »
And when the district grew more settled,
the police, “ from information received,” arrested
two old crazy men in the haunted house.

Rev. S. B. Fellows, New Guinea mis-
sionary, in Australasian Methodist Missionary
Review
T.he native women here have also earned an unenviable
notoriety for impurity, and I had been told to expect a
greeting in filthy poetry taught them by some men with
white skins and black hearts. However, the presence of
my wife in my home has completely stopped anynmpure
advances towards the missionary.
How completely satisfactory ! But the New
Guinea climate being so trying to white women,
nearly all who go there find a yearly trip
South necessary, while th.eir husbands remain
tethered to the vineyard or cocoa-nut patch. The
noble male saints who have gone out with glad
tidings for the heathen are thus exposed to a sore
annual trial from which, through prayer, they no
doubt emerge triumphant. Another'bit; —
It is becoming quite the fashion for mothers to bring
their babies to the Mission House for inspection. I would
not like to reckon how many have been washed and oiled
on the verandah.
We are thinking of starting a Neglected Children’*
Fund, so as to purchase suitable condensed milk, &0., for
infants who are deprived of their natural sustenance.
“Feeding-bottle my lambs I” Admirable mis-
sionary !
Children over six month* of age could be kept for about
£2 a year —clothes included.
Note the true parsonic stress on clothes. Clothes
are the thin end of the wedge which splits up the
natural man, and opens the way for progress,
civilisation, phthisis, churches, stipends, the eol-
lection-plate, the sustentation fund, fat ministers
frolicking round at kiss-in-the-ring picnics, Heaven
and harps, Hell and sulphur, and everything else
worth having; and all for X 2 a year. Noble
Fellows !
