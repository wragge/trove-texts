CAMEOS OF SCIENCE.
There is a great tendency in these days towards the cultivation of the Arts and Sciences. Excellent works on
every subject are constantly being produced to this end and there is good hope that, if peace reigns supreme
as it has done for some time, men and women who think will be able to cultivate their minds by the read-
ing of good literature—and the study of Art. Relined taste is not, as many suppose, au accident of birth but
is the consequence of education and habit. When your education is complete, you will consider it infra diqnum

Alex, Montgomery writes —
ITou correctly suppose that the sentences in the
4 mangrove - flat ’ and * head - house * passages shaped
themselves without any consciousness on my part that I
was falling into iambic measure. The psychological ex-
planation of a temporary lapse into this rhythm is
(doubtless with others, as with me) as follows. The
iambic pentameter of English blank-verse—notably that
of Milton—has soaked so thoroughly into roy sub-con-
sciousness that, when instinctively I feel the need of a
graver and more deliberate note, my difficulty is not to
get the iambic swing, but to avoid it. In the passage
which you quote it seems to me that I had a vague feeling
asof prelusive solemnity—opening chords—curtain-raising
—what you will in that way ; and though I agree with you
in deprecating the ‘affectation of prose-verse,’ neverthe-
less I think that a sparing employment of the iambic
pulsation is here and there admissible—if used simply as
a change of key, and not as an altogether legitimate
element of prose composition. To show' that one may be
much more iambic in effect than in intention, let me scan
as jt sounded to me a sentence whioh you quote—
“Acrdss the 16ng perspective of the mangrove-fl&ts the
sffi# glared fierce and crimson.”
You have here in one case a collocation of three short or
weak syllables, and, in another, of three long or strong.
So also with other passages whioh would not be markedly
iambic, as read by me.’
» » * *
Thus Montgomery’s prose iambics, if one cor-
rgQtly understands him, are due to the influence
of Milton and the blank-verse poets, which makes
itself felt when there is need of a solemn, pre-
lusive strain in his prose. But there is still some-
thing to explain. Montgomery’s phrases, for
example—“ opening chords—curtain-raising
seem pointed directly at a famous passage in De
Quincey’s 4 Opium-Eater’—the passage beginning:
The dream oommenced with a music which now I often
heard in dreams—a music of preparation and of awaken-
ing suspense ; a music like the opening of the Coronation
Ahthem, and which, like that, gave the feelinguf a vast
march—of infinite cavalcades filing off—and the tread of
innumerable armies. The morning was come of a mighty
day—a day of crisis and of final hope for human nature,
then suffering some mysterious eclipse, and laboring in
spme dread extremity. Somewhere, I knew not where—
somehow, I knew not how—by some being, I knew not
whom—a battle, a strife, an agony, was conducting—was
evolving like a great drama or piece of music.
Why is there here no marked iambic rhythm to
express the 4 prelusive solemnity ’ whioh De
Quincey certainly felt and desired to make his
readers feel? De Quincey also knew his blank-
verse poets ; yet their iambics could have brought
no effect of ‘opening chords’ and ‘curtain-rais-
ing ’ to him, or he would surely have em-
ployed them in the most signal 4 opening chords ’
passage in his writings—in all English litera-
ture. So that the ‘prelusive solemnity’ re-
sides, not in the iambic rhythm, but in Mont-
gomery’s mental associations with it; and for
people who have not his mental associations—
who have not borne away from the blank-verse
poets his ‘curtain-raising’ impressions—his effect
is possibly missed. Taking his own theory, that
is, that the force of the iambics does reside in the
mental associations. But partly, at least, it must
reside in the essential rhythm. Montgomery says,
in effect, that there were kings before Agamemnon,
and that Agamemnon holds his sceptre in the way
they taught him. But who taught them ? What
impulse swayed the original iambic metrist ?
————♦
Writes 4 J.M.’—
Your Sis had once an elder brother, Hesh. He was the
outcome of the incestuous
(Why ‘incestuous’? Who should dally if not
He and She ?)
dalliance of He and She in the cerebral mazes of one
D , an Oxford graduate, whom too much learning
had brought 4 under restraint.’ D was proud of
his bantling, and lauded its lovely Hebraic form and
sibilant forcefulness. But, called in consultation, edi-
torially I slew it. Only a Volapuker or one * under
restraint ’ could endure such verbal teratogeny .
(‘Teratogeny ’ is a 4 good word’—even Vola-
piikers and people 4 under restraint ’ have few
better. To save unfamiliar readers the trouble of
reference or cursing, it means ‘monster-making.’)
as results in Hesh and Sim and Sis. For the sake of
Language and Literature and Art and Everything, put
Sim and Sis under your 4 Unabridged,’ and sit on it hard
and heavily.)
* * * *
‘ J.M.’ seems a fair specimen of the pedantic
little insects who block the pathway to reform.
The new pronoun—Nom., se; Gen., sis ; Dat.,
sim; Acc., se —formed by eliding the h of the
masculine pronoun and substituting s from the
feminine ditto, was invented to imply both sexes
by a scribe tired of going round about the stupid
collocations ‘he or she,’ ‘his or her,’ ‘ him or
her.’ First used in jest, it is approving itself
in earnest as of real utility, and the 4 foreign
feeling ’is disappearing in the habit of use. As
yet, however, the new pronoun is only used pro-
visionally, till someone can supply a better.
» * * *
There are obvious objections, which grow
email when examined. 4 Se’ is arbitrary—so is
every other word. 4 Sis ’ is unpleasantly sibilant
—so is sister. (‘ Ser ’ was originally suggested in
place of ‘sis.’) ‘Se ’ may be mistaken for ‘she’
—in practice the user has not found it so mis-
taken. And advantages shine conspicuously.
Here is a passage from a recent newspaper—
Whoever the writer of the article may be, ha or she
Is evidently well acquainted with the subject
Take it in the new way—
Whoever the writer of the article may be, se is evi-
dently well acquainted with the subject.
Is it not worth while overcoming a little un-
familiarity—a task achieved every week by
writers and readers of the new words continually
becoming part of the language—so to improve
such an awkward sentence ? There is a gain in
sound, time, space, and perspicuity.
a * * •
‘Hesh’ is (of course) not so neat as 4 se,’and
seems to have wanted ‘ declining,’ but the word
gives proof of a laudable desire on ‘ D.’s ’ part to
bridge one of the troublesome gullies in English.
‘ J.M.’ may continue to dally down the gully and
up again if he chooses. No crusade is preached:
no proselytes are sought.
And, on the same subject, ‘6xB’
Lawson makes out that nobody cares for our Australian
bush as it is, but thinks “we might love it” if it could
boast of mountains, deserts, and mighty forests, etc.
Who are ‘we’? There are two distinct types of bushmen
—the real and the mongrel. The former are men who
have taken up bush life when young, from choice ; and
the bred and born bushmen —the sons of squatters, over-
seers, selectors, drovers, fencers, tanksinkers, stockmen,
and boundary riders. They love the bush, desolate and
monotonous though it be, as dearly as the Swiss loves his
Alps, and the Arab his desert. Why they love their
weird, drought-stricken, sun-smitten back country they
can no more explain than Arabs or Esquimaux in their
case.
The real bushmen are not outcasts out back. On the
contrary, they are at home and happy there alone, and
outcasts everywhere else. I knew an out-back station
manager’s son who was sent to town to study for a pro-
fession. To use his own words: ‘ The yearning for the
bush gnawed so strongly at my heart, that one fine morn-
ing I chucked it and took train to Bourke.’ Stepping out
of the coaoh at his station he exclaimed: 4 Thank God i I
am back in the mulga and smell eucalyptus once more 1’
And the ring in his voioe convinced me the thanks came
from the bottom of his heart.
The real bushroan is unassuming and quiet as his sur-
roundings. He thinks much and speaks little. In mixed
camps he is the listener. The mongrel bushman always
has most to say, and gives no one else a chance to speak.
The real bushman is full of poetioal feelings, and loves
poetry of the Gordon, “Banjo,” "Glenrowan” and
“ Breaker ” type, but seldom if ever writes verses. His
whole heart and soul are in the bush, and in his horses,
dogs, cattle and sheep; and to win the Mulga Hack-Race
is the height of his ambition.
Real bushmen are always in good demand as laborers,
especially on cattle-ruris out back, and can command
good wages. They are rarely long out of work and more
rarely still hard up ; and they hardly ever ‘ carry their
swag.' As for cadging a pint o’ flour, they abhor the idea
of it. The average bush native would sooner steal a
horse out of a police-paddock, or break into a Govern-
ment store, than 4 hump bluey ’ and beg. Of the many,
thousands of swagmen, or ' outcasts,’ as Lawson terms
them, who are roaming the backblocks to-day, not 3 per
cent, are bush natives.
The mongrel bushmen are city-bred, and come out-back
to get away from themselves or hide from others; or they
come to make money and get back to town as fast as
possible. These latter (in N.S. Wares) are mostly Maori-
landers, Tasmanians and Victorians. They stay only as
long as they can get shearing, and they would go to the
North Pole if they could make money there. Scenery is
no object to them. But their stay in the bush is too pass'
ing to be of any account.
The mongrel bushmen who stay and die out-back (much
against their will) are men of all trades and professions,
and from all parts of the universe. They are Bill and
Jim—the swagmen who carry a bundle of valueless rags
about the bush and 4 tramp for ever through boiling
mulga scrub and baking lignum ’ for no particular pur-
pose except cadging and to do a few weeks’ rouseabouting
once a year at shearing time. (The real bushman shears
or musters in the wool season.) I imagine that some of
the lowest specimens of the human race are found amongst
them. The • come-down ’ and 4 seen-better-days' men
are also much in evidence in this olass. These men are
outcasts in the full sense of the word—but not because
they are in the bush, for they would be outcasts any-
where. They are as much out of place in the bush as the
real bushman is in their homes—the slums of Sydney,
London, New York, Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg.
Always longing to get back to their city-haunts and
threepenny beer-shops, they bitterly hate and curse the
bush, and prefer ‘ not to take it at all,’ and eternally vow
to quit it at the earliest opportunity. When they do get a
cheque they carry it with astonishing regularity to the
nearest snakejuice foundry, and when broke they carry
their bundle of rags across some more * blazing plains ’
and crawl along some more ‘endless tracks of red dust
and grey*—seeking undeserved sympathy, cadging flour,
cursing the bush and vowing to quit some more, till
shearing comes round again. Being unable to ride and
useless among stock they can get but little work to do
between shearings. And these—or some of them—are the
men who, when their brains are softened by their un-
natural mode of life, fish diet, lack of women, and occa-
sional superfluity of snakejuice, write doggerel about
‘shining rivers’and ‘ rippling streams.’ The real bush-
man looks with just contempt upon the mongrel bush-
man.
To get an insight into Australian bush life one must
read ‘The Banjo ’ and similar Bulletin writers, as well as
Lawson. ‘The Banjo’ and others give us the real
bushman and his sentiments as truly as Lawson shows the
pseudo or mongrel bushman. The two characters make
up the back-country population, and both are well worth
writing up and reading about.
Writes ‘ Ignotus ’ —
It was in ’6B I read Lyall’s ‘Theology in Extremis.’
The verses deal with a decent Englishman, a freethinker,
who is offered his life by Sepoy rebels if he will abjure
Christianity. He looks at his pious comrade praying, and
muses—
‘Not for a moment faltereth he,
Sure of the promise and pardon of sin ;
Thus did the martyrs die, I see,
Little to lose and muckle to win ;
Death means Heaven : he longs to receive it,
But what shall I do if I don’t believe it? ’
And later on —
• Ay, but the word, if I could but have said it*
I by no terrors of hell perplext;
Hard to be silent and have no credit
From man in this world, or reward in the next;
None to bear witness and reckon the cost
Of the name that is saved by the life that is lost.’
And he elects to die.
* * * •
Some years later—in some magazine—I saw 4 Medita-
tions of a Hindu.’ I quote a few lines—
‘All the world over, I wonder, in lands that I never have
trod,
Are the people eternally seeking for the signs and steps
of a god ? . . .
‘And the myriad idols around me, and the legion of
muttering priests,
The revels and rites unholy, the dark unspeakable feasts !
What have they wrung from the Silence? Hath even a
whisper come
Of the secret, Whence and Whither? Alas! for the gods
are dumb.
‘ Shall I list to the word of the English, who come from
the uttermost sea ?
“The Secret, hath it been told you, and what is your
message to me ? ”
It is nought but the wide-world story how the earth and
heavens began,
How the gods are glad and angry, and a Deity once was
man.’
* • • *
And now there has come to me a little book whioh holds
these lines and others—“ Verses Written in India by Sir
Alfred Lyall(Lond., Kegan Paul, 4th ed., ’96). Many of
the pieces are so simple and direct that one seems to
read one’s own thoughts whispered back by a lover, by j
twin brother, by the breath of the scented Indian even-
ing, by . . . ? I will quote a few verses. A soldier
sees his friend buried in the jungle and hears the musio-*
‘ Full and clear from the pacing band,
Passionate strain of a love-lorn story—
How can they breathe it in strangers’ land
Air of our northern “Annie Laurie"? . , ,
•Chaining his spirit’s upward flight,
Staying his soul, though at Heaven’s own portal,
With the soft refrain of a lost delight,
With the shadowy charm of a fairy mortal.
‘ Lured by the sensuous melody’s spell,
Little he recks of the angels’ glory,
Piercing sad is the Earth’s farewell
Sighed in the music of “ Annie Laurie.’"
* » » •
Another soldier stands waiting with his colonel and the
colonel’s wife. Rebels surround them. The colonel
eleots to stay.
*. . . And she bent from her saddle low,
And she touched my cheek and whispered “Go!”
With her eyes all full of despair and woe
“ Good bye, sweetheart, for ever i ” ’
The last verses are exactly in Gordon’s manner, if yon
read them all through. And, indeed, they are very like
Gordon in many things—differing, however, in this: that
Gordon continually sets one’s teeth on edge by dragging
in French and Latin and Greek, of which languages he
knew nothing, with ludicrous effect. I remember once
screaming with laughter at earo being made neuter. It
reminded me of the very oomio lines I had to learn by
heart as a child— ! ‘
‘ Caro carnis mavult se
Femininis addere.’
Comic, taken one way. Well, Lyall is evidently a good
classic, though he doesn’t obtrude it. Take his para-
phrase of Horace, Lib. 11., Ode vii. The last verse runs—-
• Let propriety go to the devil,
Be Anonyma queen of the feast—
I can’t see the harm of a revel
With a friend who is home from the East.’
He must have understood Horace well to have caught his
manner so exactly. Who Lyall is, I never could exaotly
find out. I believe he was in some very high position in
the Civil Service in the N.W. provinces of India. Ten
years ago I wrote to him to ask where I could get his
verses, mentioning my clear memory of the piece pub-
lished in ’6B. He replied to the effect that he didn’t
know—didn’t apparently think his verses much good.
He ought to know, one would think, but I can’t say I
agree with him.
* • • *
[According to the reference-books, Sir A. Lyall
(aged 61) is still above ground as Lieut.-Gov. of
the Indian N.W. Provinces. His brother, Sir
James, was Lieut.-Gov. of the Punjab. Alfred
has other literary merits in the shape of social
and religious studies of Asiatic life ; he wrote
‘ Warren Hastings ’ for the 4 Eng. Men of Action ’
series; and his ' Rise of the Brit. Dominion in
India ’ reached a 3rd ed. in ’93. The father, an
Eng. clergyman, travelled, wrote, and philoso-
phised to some extent, and for several years edited
the Annual Register.]
Writes 'J. Jingle’—
Lawson's tirade against the backblocks is wild, vague,
and in places distinctly untrue. For instance, to say that
‘ out West ’ there are not, nor ever were, ‘ shining rivers,
grassy plains, western hills, dawn, morn, gloaming,
gigantic trees,’ &c., is, to put it mildly, “ a verity upside-
down.’ In the backiest backblocks each and all of these
occur in their place and season, in conjunction and
separately. That the bush-bard (of late much maligned)
should prefer to write of the dawn when it is flushing a
grassy plain and shining river, rather than to picture the
plain scorched and withered and the river dry, only shows
the bush-bard’s appreciation of the beautiful, which is
the first quality required to entitle him to the name of
bard at all.
A while-back Bulletin correspondent made out the
bushman to be a stolid individual with no note of music
in him, no poetic soul. Now Lawson comes along to say
that Bill and Jim are teeming with fictional genius and
imagination, and reel off poetry whenever the billy is
boiliDg. He says, moreover, that they shouldn’t do it,
because they are thereby misleading the poor devils living
on the Australian rim whose thoughts might wander
westward. Certes! here flies a spark from the soul of
the man who wrote ‘The Men who Come Behind.’
' Stand back, Bill and Jim! while I point out to the Aus-
tralian rimmers the drear results of trekking West.’
Now, there is nothing upside-down about the verity that
humping bluey in the backblocks—either in flood-time,
drought-time, or good season—is a hard life ; but where
does the rear-guard find life easy?
That the bush is often ugly enough to breed pessimism
is the worst of reasons for deriding unpessimistic bush-
poetry, and so robbing the real, genuine bush-dwellers
(not the rim-dwellers like Lawson, who make one hard trip
and vow it will last them a life-time) of the pleasure
of welcoming in the words of others an interpretation
of the (possibly rare) beauties which they see and feel yet
cannot themselves interpret. Also, why should we love
our West if it were a desert with an oasis here and
there ? or composed of ranges of inaccessible mountains
unfit for the pasture of anything but chamois? and how
does Lawson know that we don’t love it as it is, anyway ?
Men and women go and live there permanently, yvhile in
English Africa they have had their choice of deserts,
jungles, mountains, and pastoral paradises to love and
live in, and in none of them have they settled as Aus-
tralians settle.
I herewith beg to propose a motion that in a certain
modified form we do love our West, also that we
love and respect the second detachment of track-blazing
men and women who dwell therein. (The men who came
first didn’t blaze all the tracks, by Jupiter !) Hands up.
I thought so. Thank you. The meeting will adjourn
with two lines from that stirring little poem of ‘ Glen-
rowan’s ’—
‘ Our pride is the path of our fathers,
Our hope’s in the sons of our home.’
That’s the sentiment!—don’t forget the fathers, but give
the sons a little credit too !
A BALLADE OF BY GONES.
Into what dim, unlettered night
Do our romantic idols stray?
Whither has Trilby taken flight
And where does Ben Hur’s chariot sway?
The Little Minister is gray ;
No more does Robert Elsmere pose ;
Where do the favorites delay ?
Nay, where is yestermorning’s rose ?
Forgotten is The Manxman's might;
And what of Tess do bookmen say?
The Prisoner of Zenda’s plight
Is one with Fauntleroy’s at play.
Mulvaney, Ortheris! Where are they?
On Sherlock Holmes the shadows close;
Why do their memories decay?
Ah, where is yestermorning’s rose?
They walked Romance’s flowery height,
Nor Howells’ self could them dismay ;
Made all of sweetness and of light, !
For which Philistines loved to pay.
Now each his unlamented way
To libraried oblivion goes,
And on their tombs we toss a spray
Of yestermorning’s faded rose.
ENVOY.
Prints! 'twas not yours the fate to stay
With all the art the era knows,
For fame in this decadent day
Is but as yestermorning’s rose.

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and j
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated Remedies, which strike
at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
ALL CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persofis residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of
treatment will not in any way interfere with their
business.
Every person applying to the Doctor will rQjeive a
straightforward and candid opinion of the case, and the
possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ; if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no
case which he cannot cure.

si
But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronio case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished dootor your be*b friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart

ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing

Perhaps you are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, but have a DERRY on SILKS,
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you’re almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you’d rather see your money in the bank than on
your back, and dividends are better, say you, than
Ribbons and Laces. Well, have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with “ youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm,” you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS, and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

Cleanse your blood with Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla —the most thoroughly
reliable alterative ever compounded.
For scrofula, boils, ulcers, sores, car-
buncles, pimples, blotches, and all
disorders originating in vitiated
blood, this medicine is a specific.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is equally bene-
ficial as a remedy for catarrh, rheu-
matism, and rheumatic gout. As a
Tonic, it assists the process of
digestion, stimulates the sluggish
liver, strengthens the nerves, and
builds up the body when debilitated
by excessive fatigue or wasting
illness. Physicians everywhere con-
sider Ayer’s Sarsaparilla the best. It
is a skilfully-prepared combination
of the most powerful alteratives and
tonics. No other blood-purifier gives
equal satisfaction or is so universally
in demand.

THE MEN WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
When God’s wrath-cloud is o’er me,
Affrighting heart and mind ;
When days seem dark before me,
And days seem black behind ;
Those friends who think they know me—
Who deem their insight keen—
They ne’er forget to show me
The man I might have been.
He’s rich and independent,
Or rising fast to fame ;
His bright star is ascendant,
The country knows his name ;
His houses and his gardens
Are splendid to be seen ;
His fault the wise world pardons—
The man I might have been.
His fame and fortune haunt me ;
His virtues wave me back ;
His name and prestige daunt me
When I would take the track ;
But you, my friend true-hearted—
God keep our friendship green !
You know ho.w I was parted
From all I might have been.
But what avails the ache of
Remorse or weak regret?
We’ll battle for the sake of
The men we might be yet !
We’ll strive to keep in sight of
The brave, the true and clean,
And triumph yet in spite of
The men we might have been.
HENRY LAWSON.
ME AND M‘GILL.
Me and M‘Gill was mates, yer see,
A matter of twenty year ;
If ever yer run agen him or me
The other ye’d know was near.
For if luck was in or if luck was out,
Sober or drunk or ill,
We battled it out through flood and drought
Me and my mate M'Gill.
We pooled our cheques at the shed we rung
With a glorious tune in hopes ;
Our picks at each other’s side we swung
In the Barrier’s stewing stopes;
And out where the glittering sun-rays bake
At Wilcannia, fit to kill,
We chipped out chunks of opal flake,
Me and my mate M'Gill.
When cheques were blued and we’d lost our nags
As many had gone before,
We’d grab our billies and hump our swags
And start on the road once more.
But never ye’d hear us squeal or fuss;
River or plain or hill,
Dust or mud was the .same to us,
Me and my mate M‘Gill.
We got through onst to the town all right
And like toffs we played it high,
Till a cop got on to M‘Gill one night,
And Mac got on to his eye.
Another came up and I fetched him one —
We was dealin’ it out with will—
Then three months’ hard in the gaol we done:
Me and my mate M‘Gill.
But a girl appeared, and our senses flew,
And me and M‘Gill fell out;
For we’d acted the fool, as a man will do
When a cunnin’ woman’s about.
She kidded us each that she liked him best,
While we’d money to fill the till:
Then one went East and the other went West—
Me and my mate M'Gill.
But, by-and-by, when the both of us land
At the homestead up above,
To see if the cove has reserved a stand
In the shed of eternal love —
Well ! if there ain’t room for both him and me,
We’ll step it out straight down hill,
And be mates in hell, as we useter be —
Me and my mate M‘Gill.

MONTAGUE GROVER.
THE CRY OF THE COOKIE.
(After Thomas Moore.)
I never had old sheep to sell
Whose wool was parting down their back;
But what it turned as dry as—well,
Until they faded off in stacks.
I never prayed it might keep dry
But what there fell a foot o’ rain
To send the price o’ sheep so high
That I could ne’er stock-up again.
I never raised a crop o’ corn
To glad me with its golden ears
But it was reaped and held in pawn
For overdrafts of droughty years.
I never threshed a stack o’ wheat,
But when I took it to the mill
The price was sich, ’twould scarce receipt
That wily miller’s grocery bill.
I never knew the price so high
That growin’ wheat ’ud really pay,
But what the season turned so dry
I had to cut it down for hay.
I never had a chance but once
To get my neck from out the yoke—
I sold out well, and lodged “ the bunce,”
And then the blessed bank went broke.

Tobacco Manufacturers.
The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SOIn S, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Pl*iC6 HitllCPtO XTll“
kHOWH Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d,!!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “BONANZA”
oomes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note-—Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

SATURDAY, APRIL 3, 1897.
“Will You Walk into My Parlor?”
Almost as soon as the Federal Convention
opened the Queensland Government tried,
by a quaint and characteristic device, to put
its subtle spoke in the wheel and bring the
whole movement to wreck. The device was
not, it is true, a very brilliant one ; still it was
a piece of well-contrived cunning of the
kind with which the Byrnes-Tozer Ministry
is so familiar. According to the voice which
came unexpectedly out of the North,
Queensland now desires, for some quite in-
comprehensible reason, and under various
impossible circumstances, to join the Con-
vention at the last moment or a little later.
When the last Convention met, Queensland
professed to be, in a certain rather uncertain
fashion of its own, a friend to the policy of
union, and not only promised to make one in
the movement but agreed informally to
choose its ten delegates by the same process
of popular election as its neighbors. Then
the Nelson Government fell away by in-
stalments. First it proposed to deprive the
people of the right of election and to select
ten sound, reliable boodle-representatives
itself by means of its Parliamentary majority.
Next it created a beautifully realistic-looking
quarrel between the Houses of Parliament as
to the election of the ten delegates ; having
stolen the right of election from the people
the two branches of the Legislature pro-
ceeded to quarrel, or pretend to quarrel,
over the plunder. Finally it threw the
matter up in real oV affected disgust, and
announced that Queensland would stand out.
Having thus left the Federal movement
itself, the Nelson Government proceeded to
do all it knew to break up the concert of the
other provinces. It became seized with a
sudden reverence for the miserable, impo-
tent Federal Council which has been such an
utter failure for the last 10 years at Hobart,
and tried to set up this dead thing in active
rivalry with the live movement at Adelaide.
It had schemes for making the Council elec-
tive, for increasing its authority, for inducing
the dissenting provinces to come in, and
generally it did its best to drag the old insti-
tution across the scent and thus distract
attention. When this failed, the principal
Queensland politicians became the voice of a
Jeremiah in the distance, deriding the new
Federal movement and prophesying all kinds
of disaster.
* * * •
Then, when the Convention actually met,
and it began to appear that Federation was
really a possibility, the Queensland Govern-
ment came forward with a new and un-
expected proposition. It now states that it
is,- after all, really anxious to join the
Convention, and' if that body will adjourn
indefinitely the Queensland Parliament will
mqet by-and-bye, and, some time after it has
met, the Government will introduce a Bill
nominating ten delegates, and if the Bill
passes in course of time, the ten Queenslanders
will be ready after a while to take a hand
in the work. And. if it doesn’t pass the
Nelson Government will possibly have
something else to suggest. And if it isn’t
intended to pass, it will be merely another
red herring drawn across the track, and a
long delay to no purpose, and, during that
delay, the Federal movement will probably
have grown scT cold that it will be hard to
find even a single spark among the ashes.
* * ♦ *
The gorgeous insolence of the proposal
calls for a certain admiration. Queensland
dropped out of the movement many weeks
ago, and ever since then its Government has
been openly hostile. During all these weeks
it made no attempt whatever to resurrect
the Federal Enabling Bill ; it had unlimited
opportunity to come in, and it refused
to avail itself thereof for the sufficient
reason that it wanted to stay out. Hav-
ing fooled away all this time it now
asks the other five provinces to wait
for an indefinite period while it changes
its mind. It doesn’t propose, apparently, to
call Parliament together at once, and pass
the Enabling Bill, but suggests that the
other provinces shall suspend operations till
Parliament comes together in the ordinary
slow course of events. Having broken its
implied promise to appoint its delegates by
popular election, and having also broken its
promise to push the Enabling Bill through
Parliament—having broken, in short, every
promise it made on the subject—it now
invites the other Australias to rely entirely
on its new promise, and to hang up
all business pending fulfilment. Also,
having declared that it couldn’t get the
Enabling Bill through owing to the hostile
attitude of the Legislative Council, it now
invites the other five provinces to wait on the
understanding that it can getthe Bill through.
And it asks its neighbors to believe that it is in
dead earnest about the matter, and is full of
a desire to go straight to work, in proof of
which the two principal members of the
Government are on their way to England,
and won’t be on hand to do any work at all
for several months. Queensland’s desire to
come in just now is a woefully thin pretence,
and, regarded as a plausible lie, it is far
below the Boodle Government’s usual stan-
dard of plausibility.
* * * *
In viewing the position of the Nelson-
Byrnes-Tozer Ministry it must always be
borne in mind that that Ministry is against any
Australian Federation which includes Queens-
land. Such a Federation must, sooner or later,
abolish black-labor; no matter what stipula-
tions are made at the outset in favor of the
Kanaka and the Chow the influence of the
five white provinces and the white element
in Queensland must some day bear them
down. Even if the Kanaka is especially
provided for in the Constitution it only
means that the Constitution will presently
be amended for the express purpose of
throwing out the piebald races of the North.
Also the Federal Parliament, being an Aus-
tralian and not a mere Brisbane institution,
would probably listen, sooner or later, to the
Northern demand for separation; if it hasn’t
the power at first to interfere in such a
matter it will probably acquire it later on.
For these two reasons, and possibly for
several others, the Nelson Ministry loathes
the idea of a union of the six provinces.
Also, it is almost equally hostile to Federa-
tion without Queensland. Queensland might
remain outside at first, but. the necessity of
getting inside the Federal Customs tariff in
ordertofinda marketfor its produce, of having
its credit supported by the Federal Govern-
ment, and of enjoying the same railway facili-
ties as the other Australias, the need to have
a share in the Federal defence system, and
many other considerations, will inevitably
make Queensland come in later on. And
when it comes in late its pet nigger is just as
much doomed as if it came in early. Whether
Australia federates with Queensland or with-
out Queensland it is equally the beginning
of the end for the cheap nigger labor system
and probably for the subjection of North
Queensland to the South. Therefore, the
present Queensland Ministry is against
Federation all the time. It first tried to
wreck the movement by standing out; having-
failed in that it now attempts to wreck it by
professing a desire to come in, but it is
equally against Federation either way.
* * * «
If the Queensland proposal had been
accepted—or if it is still accepted—the
Boodle Government gets quite a number of
chances in the illimitable chapter of acci-
dents. The Convention would adjourn with
practically nothing done. Hie Premiers
would go to England and would lose touch
of the question, and their doings there
would divert attention from Federal matters,
and their absence would seriously prolong
the delay." When they came back it
would be necessary to call Parliament
together in all the five mainland pro-
vinces, and present the overdue financial
statement and the Estimates, and to get
Supply, and do other urgent business, and
again Federation would be hung up. Imme-
diately afterwards (about October), the Vic-
torian general elections are due, and, in the
absence of the Victorian delegates, who
would be busy hustling for their own seats
and keeping the MTntyre-Gillies crowd
out of office, there would presumably be a
further postponement. If the Turner
Ministry went down its defeated members
would presumably resign their seats
Convention, and more time would be lost in
the election of their successors. Between
the things that might happen and the things
that alihost certainly would happen the post-
ponement asked for by the Queensland
Government would probably end all pos-
sibilities of pushing through any Federal
business this year. And by next year so
many matters would have intervened to
divert public attention, and there would have
been so many re-shufflings of the political
cards, that the subject would perhaps be
about as far away from the public mind as is
the late lamented Moses, whose tomb is sup-
posed to lie somewhere in a south-eastern
direction from the Dead Sea.
* * * •
Then the Queensland Government would
have two courses to choose from. It might
bring in its Enabling Bill after a lengthy
delay, and wrangle over it for many days,
and then drop it as was done on the first
occasion, and inform the other provinces
that it had again resolved to stand out. This
is the course it would probably pursue if
there was reason to believe that the delay
had so far killed the Federal movement, for
the time being, that this last fiasco would
destroy any public interest which remained.
Or it might pass the Bill as gradually as
possible, and send down ten solid Tory
nominees to wreck Federation all they knew
by making impossible demands ; or, if it
couldn’t be wholly wrecked, to make the
Federal Constitution as Tory and as unpopu-
lar and as useless as possible. In any case,
it must be remembered that Queensland does
not propose to send popular representatives ;
it promises—-whatever its promise may be
worth—only to send ten nominees of the
true Boodle Government pattern, and the
sort of Constitution which Nelson and
Byrnes and Tozer’s nominees will advocate
is certain to be as unlike the kind that New
South Wales and Victoria and South Aus-
tralia and the Queensland democracy desire
as anything can possibly be. The Queens-
land Ministry really asks the other provinces
to wait indefinitely, at great inconvenience,
so that it may, or may not, send down ten
men to do as much injury to the Federal
cause as possible. And the fact that
Premier Reid supports this indefinite
delay, and that he started suggesting a
postponement even before the Convention
reached Adelaide at all, supplies a stronger
reason than the many which went before it
for doubting that fat and shufflesome person’s
sincerity. Much lingering is the surest
way to wreck Federation. Reid indirectly
suggested a possible postponement when he
returned from his famous Queensland mis-
sion. He suggested it again in Melbourne
two days before the Convention met. He
suggested it some more at Adelaide before
the Convention had even formally set to
work. Altogether, Premier Reid’s yearning
for postponement is growing too obvious.
The Great Patent Medicine Swindle.
The Bulletin uses the above term advisedly.
It believes that nine patent medicines out of
ten are more or less swindles, and that seven
or eight out of ten are wholly swindles with no
redeeming feature about them whatever. In
this respect they are no worse than many other
things, but they occupy a position of privilege
unlike that of any other swindle in this country.
The individual who gets money from a healthy
person by presenting a valueless cheque, on the
false pretence that it is good, is a criminal, and
liable to a long term in gaol. The individual
who gets money from a sick person by falsely
pretending that certain slush in a bottle is
something quite different from what it is, is not
a criminal ; at least the law in this country
has never treated him as one. The person who
gets value for what is valueless, by putting the
name of a non-existent person to a bank-order,
is run in. The individual who gets value for
what is equally valueless, by putting the name
of a non-existent person to a testimonial alleg-
ing that the individual, who never lived ami
whose address is wholly imaginary, was
snatched from the brink of the grave by the
use of something at 7s. 6d., is, for some occult
reason or other, not run in. The law is be-
ginning to worry a good deal in some places
about the authenticity of prospectuses and
balance-sheets, but the authenticity of the
patent medicine testimonial is a thing of
which it takes no cognisance. It is ° also
commencing to trouble itself considerably
about food and drink being what they pre-
tend to be; the idea of trying to ensure
that medicine shall be what it pretends to be
troubles nobody. The code agitates itself
greatly to protect the public against its own
weakness in trusting to confidence men, three-
card men, bogus-cheque men, welshers, “ long-
firms, counterfeit-coiners, dealers in bogus
notes, sham bankers, and the like; but the
patent-medicine confidence-man is free of all
supervision. This immunity is wonderful and
unaccountable.
* * * „
The patent-medicine quack is about the
meanest of all the frauds above ground. He
lives on the sick, the suffering, the miserable,
the incurable. He probably makes his biggest
income (in proportion to their numbers) out of
the incurable ; the desire to remain a while
longer in this most disappointing of all worlds
is so strong that the average individual, when
given up as hopeless by the medical faculty,
will believe anything, and pay 7s. 6d. a bottle
for anything, that promises him relief. In that
respect the medicine fraud is on a par with the
mediaeval friar who sold pardons and thus kept
people out of hell for a consideration. He also
undertakes to keep people out of hell for a con-
sideration ; it is the latent fear of hell, or some-
thing unknown and unpleasant, whether it is
called by that name or any other, which is the
fear of death ; and the man with the mystery
in the bottle trades upon that fear and lives by
it. Also he does it with a ghastly and fraudu-
lent insolence which, in almost any other walk
of life, would result in penal servitude.
• * * *
The thing above all others which sells the
lying mixture in the bottle is the published
letter from the patient who had suffered for
years from more diseases than any one human
being could hold, and who tried the mixture and
was brought back to life. Most of these letters
are lies, and most of those which are not abso-
lute lies can’t bear inspection. They are a
curious study. One patent medicine dealer
lived for years by publishing a solitary testi-
monial from an alleged patient who was cured
in the ’6o’s. (He is still publishing it, by the
way, and seems to trade successfully on that
more or less real document of many years ago.)
Most of the tribe, however, publish a con-
tinuous stream of grateful letters from indi-
viduals who were cured in Great Britain or
America—mostly people named Smith who
can’t be verified, and who are alleged to hang
out in small villages, some of which appear in no
gazetteer, and presumably lie at the other end
of nowhere. As they are too far off to be in-
quired into, they serve their purpose well
enough without involving any risk. The local
testimonials carry more weight, but also
involve more trouble. The present writer
recently investigated a number issued in
this country by two or three advertisers.
The majority, so far as could be found out,
were bought and paid for; in a country where
an offer of a billet at 20s. a week will bring
along 400 applicants, there are thousands of
people who, for a very small sum, will sign
and swear to a declaration that they had any
incurable disease that was ever heard of, or all
the incurable diseases on record, and recovered
through using one bottle of anything under
the sun. At all events the writer knows of
people who have been always in apparently the
best of health, but whose names appear under-
neath published letters setting forth that they
were laid up for incredible periods with all man-
ner of horrors until their attention was drawn
to Blank’s great what-is-it at 3s. 6d. or 7s. lid
per bottle, and they took 19 bottles instantly, or
something to that effect, and were cured. (The
19 bottles are a wise device which tends to make
the incurable purchase large consignments.)
And the writer presumes that these people were
paid for saying such things, as hardly anybody
would make that kind of an exhibition of him-
self gratis.
* * * *
Some of the others, apparently, are not paid
for. Quite a number bear the names of people
who can’t be found in the directory at the
alleged address. Sometimes the address is
there, but some other person is in possession ;
sometimes the address can’t be found, either.
One recent case dated from number one
hundred and something in a little street
where the numbers, according to the direc-
tory account, don’t run as high as thirty,
An instance that the writer knows of was a
matter of mere forgery ; the medicine dealer
had a nodding acquaintance with his victim
and presented him with a bottle of his particu-
lar horror, and then published a letter pur-
porting to be from him setting forth that the
gratis customer—who was in perfect health—
had just recovered from a shuddersome variety
of complaints, and had been practically a walk-
ing charnel-house. In another instance the
medicine-dealer obtained the signature of a
friend in blank, and then went back on his
friendship by filling in over it a statement of
weird symptoms which made all who knew the
alleged owner of them view him with sus-
picion for long afterwards. One person whom
the writer can produce received a letter from a
perfectly unknown medicine-fiend, to the effect
that his testimonial had come to hand, and the
fiend was deeply grateful, and would publish it
at once, and congratulated him on his recovery.
In this case publication was stopped by prompt
threats of legal proceedings and assault and
battery, and the letter—which bore no resem-
blance at all to the alleged writer’s real cali-
graphy—was impounded and destroyed. Some
of these testimonials are unspeakably weird
affairs; one of the weirdest—it went the rounds
of the Australian press some years ago —set
forth that the writer, now perfectly recovered,
had been in a dreadfully bad state and used to
swell up so suddenly in the street that the
buttons flew off her clothes with the unex-
pected enlargement. The only really genuine
testimonial that the writer knows of was one
signed some years ago by a well-known Aus-
tralian politician. He had been cured of an
incurable complaint till he died, and, feeling a
good deal better almost in his last moments, he
signed a statement attesting his complete re-
covery. Then he pegged out, and a most valu-
able testimonial had to be promptly withdrawn
from circulation.
* * * *
Ihe average patent nostrum consists of a
weak and non-committal concoction of some
ordinary drug with which every physician is
acquainted, and this compound is aimed pro-
miscuously at every complaint under the sun.
Its sole merit, as a rule, lies in the advertising
and the (mostly bogus) testimonials. Every
year one or two hundred thousand pounds of
good Australian legal tender go out of the
country in payment for this mullock ; in five
provinces it is chargeable with a verv moderate
duty, but in N.S. Wales it comes in absolutely
free, and yields the State no revenue whatso-
ever. Under these circumstances The Bulle-
tin suggests four much-needed reforms. In
the first place, all patent-medicines should be


heavily taxed. Secondly, they should bear
on the label a definite statement in
plain English of the ingredients of which
they are composed, said statement being
supplied by the State analyst and cer-
tified by him. Thirdly, the patent medicine
dealer should be allowed to publish in Australia
the testimonials of his Australian cured patients
only, so that there will be a reasonable chance
of verifying his statements. Also, the publi-
cation of bogus testimonials, whether they are
the testimonials of people who don’t exist, or
those of alleged people with no address attached
for purposes of verification, or those of people
with bogus addresses, or those of people who
exist and can he found, but who never had the
diseases alleged against them or were never
cured of them as stated, should be recognised
by law as what it is—about the worst kind of
an attempt to get money by false pretences —
and should be visited on the first conviction
with a minimum fine of wfilOO, with the alterna-
tive of twelve months. Extra convictions
should he charged for on an increasing scale.
This is merely bringing the law as to false
pretences in medicine into line witli the law as
to false pretences in everything else. A code
which is so particular about the man who
swindles the healthy population with a bogus
cheque for <£l, and takes no notice of the one
who swindles the sick out of vast sums
witli bogus accounts of imaginary cures, is an
anomaly that needs strong treatment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Party Government in the Commonwealth.
The first voice raised in the Convention against
importing the clumsy foolishness of "Govern-
ment by Contradiction into the Federal Legis-
lature was that of Richard Baker, of S.A. It
is a noteworthy circumstance, by the way, that
most of the Conservative members of the Con-
vention who have developed themselves up to
date have proved reasonably liberal and pro-
gressive. Probably their conservatism is largely
a matter of habit and association, and when
they get away from the old atmosphere and the
old environment a lot of the Tory instinct is
left behind. Baker, K.C.M.G.—the man whom
Kingston went out looking for with a gun—
was certainly not the man whom anybody
expected to raise the first demand for the
abolition of the ancient bosh of Party
Government, and his pronouncement is all
the more gratifying. His theory—one which
The Bulletin has persistently advocated for
many years-—is compressible into four pro-
positions : (1) A system which requires one
party to uphold practically everything the Go-
vernment does, however bad it may be, and
another party to denounce practically every-
thing the Government does, however good it
may be, is demoralising ; (2) a system by which
the country pays (say) 45 men to do everything
that is wanted, and (say) 35 men to prevent
them doing anything that is wanted, is idiotic ;
(3) a system by which Parliament must accept
or reject the whole Ministry, and must accept
or reject the whole Ministerial policy—by
which it can’t keep Turner and throw out
Duffy, or keep Reid and bounce the fish-like
Gould, and according to which it can’t accept
those features of the Govt, policy that it wants
without also accepting those it doesn’t want, and
under which it can’t have Freetrade without also
approving of Reid and his mendacious budget,
or have Protection without cordially endorsing
Lyne and his heavy-going Toryism—is utterly
pig-headed. Also (4) a system by which a
great part of the time of the House is taken up
by considering whether the Government shall
be thrown out or not is wasteful and wearisome
and utterly profitless. The remedy advocated
by this paper, and supported so unexpectedly
by Baker, K.C.M.G., is the Swiss method of
government whereby the House elects Ministers
for a fixed term ; retains the right to endorse or
alter their policy instead of merely retaining
the right to follow them blindly or eject them
blindly ; has no want-of-confidence motions,
and isn’t compelled to support a bad ad-
ministrator because he has become identified
with a good policy, or support a bad
policy in order to retain a good administrator.
The utter accursedness of the Party system, if
it is applied to the Federal Parliament, will be
that it will be necessary to organise an Opposi-
tion, then it will be necessary to find something
for the Opposition to quarrel about, and, when
the quarrel is thus carefully constructed, it
may open a breach which will keep open for
centuries. Yet there must be an Opposition
if the Party system is to last, and there must be
a quarrel and a chronic row and a bitter ani-
mosity to keep the Opposition alive. Party
Government is bad enough in the old Legisla-
latures where the quarrel is already estab-
lished and in full blast; to import it into a new
Legislature which might otherwise get along
without any such established shindy is sheer
insanity.
The Wrong 1 End of the Stick !
The Sydney Alfred Hospital authorities have
been pointing out to Government the “ necessity
for taking some action to cope with the marked
increase of phthisis in N.S. Wales.” Consump-
tives, they assert, should be assorted, according
to stage of disease, into three classes, each of
which should receive special treatment, in a
special hospital, in a special situation. Which
suggestion—humane, and rational, and thera-
peutically up-to-date though it doubtless is—
impels The Bulletin once more to “move the
previous question,” and to assert that the Royal
Commission asked for would be rather more
usefully employed at the bottom than at the
top of the question. Causation—where cure
is practically hopeless is much the more
important consideration of the two; and
that much of the tuberculous disease in
New South Wales lies directly and unques-
tionably at the door of Government itself,
let a con file of choice little items help to
show. At Balmain police-court, the other day,
a slaughterman at Glebe Island abattoirs was
fined for having cut away from a pig’s carcase
the sub-maxillary glands, which, according to
the prosecuting official, were “ one suppurating
mass of tubercle.” At Glebe court, same day,
the owners of a bacon-factory were fined for
having a tuberculous pig’s carcase in the salt-
ing-room amongst the sound meat. Now, the
circumstance that in both these cases the
inspector “ happened-in ” at the right moment
for the public is no proof that he doesn’t much
oftener fail to happen-in at the wrong moment
for the public - poisoner. The former of
these offenders, in fact, had been warned
before for tampering with diseased carcaSes,
and it is pretty certain that, if—even under
the reputedly rigid Glebe Island system of
supervision—carcase-faking is not uncommon,
the tubercle-propagating possibilities of the
comparatively uninspected suburban slaughter-
houses are a ghastly reproach to a community
which calls itself civilised and professes to be
vastly concerned about the consumption-crop
due in large measure to its own murderous in-
difference to the sowing of the seed. The un-
licensed and non-supervised private slaughter-
house is more than a nineteenth century
anomaly ; it is a national crime ! And even
such Government inspection as exists is ren-
dered mostly perfunctory and incomplete by
the ridiculous inadequacy of a staff, which
should be doubled—trebled—quadrupled, if
necessary. If any case should be one of
“ D n the expense ! ” it is that of the conser-
vation of the public health. But there doesn’t
seem to be a very massive chance of driving
this into the skulls of a people which, while it
shrieks itself into hysterics over a poor half-
dozen alleged killings by one Butler, goes
placidly on poisoning itself by thousands and
its posterity by incalculable multitudes of
disease-inheritors. Phthisis, besides being
hereditary to the extent of transmitting an in-
creased liability to infection with its specific
germ, is more inevitably, if more tardily, fatal
than small-pox, cholera, or the plague; and
yet, while we guard ourselves with feverish
assiduity against these enemies from without,
we calmly take to our bosoms—or our lungs—a
disease which has in Europe destroyed, first
and last, more lives than all the wars of history
and all the non - indigenous epidemics put
together. Truly, as regards this matter, the
end of our national nose appears to be unduly
remote.
The Tasmanian Fly-Speck.
When the Federal Senate comes to be planned
out Tasmania promises to be an obstacle. It is
practically agreed that the (nominally) Lower
House of the Commonwealth shall represent the
States according to population, therefore in it
N.S.W. and Victoria will, at the outset, own
more than half the votes. If the Senate is fixed
on the same basis then the less populous States
(S.A., Westralia and Tasmania) will be practi-
cally annexed ; their share of votes will not be
large enough in either House to command any
serious attention. Therefore, it is proposed—
rightly enough—to compromise by giving
all the States, large and small, an equal
number of votes in the Senate. So far as
the mainland provinces are concerned this idea
is good enough. Westralia, S.A., and Queens-
land will some day hold as large a population
as either 1 N.S.W. or Victoria, and then the
present inequality will right itself. Some other
day, having more room than either Vic. or
N.S.W., they will probably have a much
larger population, and then the equal State
representation idea may do a good turn
to the two provinces now on top, and pre-
vent them altogether losing their politi-
cal consideration. But Tasmania makes the
thing ridiculous. Tasmania is so small that
the inequality, in its case, will never
right itself. It can never hold enough popula-
tion to make it equal with any of the mainland
provinces. With the others the equal State
representation will justify itself by-and-bye ;
in the case of Tasmania it can’t. Westralia
will probably separate later on into three or
four provinces, or perhaps a dozen. The Terri-
tory will certainly set up for itself some day
apart from S.A. Queensland will probably
split into at least three, and even N.S.W. may
separate into two pieces in course of time. But
even one-twelfth of Westralia would be three
times the size of Tasmania, and one-third of
Queensland would be eight times its size.
Tasmania is too small to be taken seriously; to
have a full-grown Government and Opposition
and two HousesofParliamentanda Governorand
a separate debt and political policy and deficit
for 160,000 people and 26,000 square miles of
territory is sheer waste. If the Isle of Sleep
could devise some way of amalgamating with
Victoria, it would save a great deal of needless
expense, and the two together would still be
the very smallest province of Australia—just
about one-third the size of the next smallest,
N.S.W. The idea may seem impracticable at
present, but if Tasmania would think it over
next time it is awake and decide to annex Vic-
toria—it wouldn’t sound so bad if it were put
that way—the results should be beneficial for
both parties. If something of the sort isn’t
done, Tasmania and Victoria will by-and-bye
be the two least important provinces in the
Federation, or out of it, as the case may be.
Through mere want of elbow-room they are
bound to be left hopelessly behind in popula-
tion and importance. Combination would at
least keep them to the front a good while
longer.

That brief and hurried globe-trotter, editor
Cooper, of the dreary Tory Scotsman, says,
among other good advice, that if he could bring
out 10,000 Scotch artisans, they could all find
employment in the N.S.W. backblocks inside a
few weeks. Mr. Cooper having been a week
or two in Sydney, and having enjoyed the (vide
S.M. Herald) “well-deserved compliment of
being elected an honorary member of the —haw
—Union Club,” naturally knows all about the
unemployed, the rabbit plague, the drought
horror, the ticks, the low price of wool, the
railway freight difficulty, the bush-fires, and
all the other obstacles out back, and can see his
way to so far overcome them as to find work
for 10,000 men right off. Meanwhile, over
a great part of the north of Scotland
the population has been decreasing for
many years, and though that place is much
nearer and more convenient to him the
bounding Cooper never thinks, apparently, of
finding work for his 10,000 artisans there.
Also, The Bulletin draws attention to the
fact that out of 54 great cities enumerated by
Mulhall the only ones that have grown less in
the last half-century than Cooper’s own city
of Edinburgh are Amsterdam, Cairo, Calcutta,
Constantinople,Dublin, Lisbon, Madrid, Naples,
Palermo, Smyrna, Tunis, and Venice. If the
Edinburgh globe-trotter can’t keep his own
city moving in the great world procession, but
it must needs lag at the tail among the lost-dog
towns of Turkey and Egypt, he is a nice
individual to advise Australia as to how to
create a population boom. Mr. Cooper,
by the way, runs the dreariest city paper
in Great Britain. The Scotsman is a how-
ling wilderness of Presbyterianism and
dust, and, barring the old Edinburgh Daily
Review, which died years ago after a vain
effort to be as depressed as its contemporary
in the adjacent thoroughfare—the Scotsman
came out in a crooked side street off the old
High-street and the Review used to be pub-
lished in a bye-way up 127 steps —it has long
held the record for tomb-like solemnity. If
Cooper can’t run a paper decently, considering
that he should know something about papers,
his attempts at running a country which he
knows nothing about are likely to be interesting.
The party in the Convention which wants to
federate the railways seems to be growing
stronger. Most of the members who have
alluded to the subject are in favor of railway
federation, while its opponents have, so far,
lain very low. It is hardly possible to make
out a decent case for the retention of the pre-
sent system, with its various gauges; its ruinous
differential rates ; its provincial system of
building lines to connect every place with the
seaport of the province, however remote it may
be, and refusing to connect with the nearest
seaport, however near it may be, if it lies in
another province; its many different manage-
ments, and different varieties of rolling-stock
necessitated by various gauges ; the consequent
needless loading and unloading at the borders,
and other clumsy expedients. It is utterly
impossible to make out anything like a de-
cent case for provincial railway management,
but possibly the provincialists will rise up like
John Brown’s soul and give a silent massive
vote when the time comes.
4,
Three of the Premiers— Turner, Braddon,
and Kingston —definitely announce that their
visit to England will not be allowed to interfere
with the progress of the Federal movement.
Their respective Parliaments will sit in their
absence with an Acting-Premier in charge, and
consider the draft constitution, and when the
three bosses get back from their record-reign
grovel the Convention can meet again and go
on with business. Under these circumstances
the proposal mooted in N.S.W., that the Con-
vention Bill shall be hung up till Premier Reid
gets back, is absolutely inexcusable, and looks
like treachery. If this idea is adopted, N.S.W.
will be three or four or eight weeks behind
the other provinces, and they will have to wait
until it catches up ; the Enabling Bill will have
to be amended to allow of the extra delay;
then the Vic. general election will come along
before the Convention is through with its
second sitting, and all will be confusion.
“ Fluffy ” to The Bulletin :
David Syme’s victory at the Vic. Federal elections
frightened friends and foes alike. There are many Radicals
who now gird at the Age because its power is too like
despotism to be pleasant. And yet there is a big proba-
bility that the inclusion of Fat-man Fraser and Fat-man
Zeal was a masterly stroke of tactics that snatched
victory by a seeming surrender. If Fraser and Zeal
had not been included in the Age ticket, Wrixon and'
Sargood would have been elected. There is a good deal of
evidence for this statement. In the first place, there
were only seven representative Radical candidates,
namely, Turner, Deakin, Peacock, Isaacs, Tr.enwith,
Berry and Higgins. The other Radicals were Styles,
Cook,Vale and Lormer. Styles is smart enough, but he has
not yet “ arrived ” —his speeches are too statistical to be
popular, and he is practically unknown outside Trades
Hall circles. Cook is miles away from being a genius.
Vale is impracticable—and Lormer the same, only more
so. The difficulty about these four men was that they
were not class enough for a Federal Convention. But are
Fraser and Zeal class enough ? Of course not. Fraser
and Zeal got into the Convention with Age plus Argus
support. Either journal alone could not have got them
there. David Syme skilfully picked on these two as being
the least harmful of the Tory Ten, arid thereby dished the
Tories. The Argus recognises that, if it had been tac-
tician enough to drop Zeal and Fraser as soon as the
Age championed them, the Tories would not have suffered
so smashing a defeat on the Fourth of March, but it does
not dare to say so. In a luminous analysis of the elections,
Professor Nanson, of Melbourne University chair of
mathematics, practically proves the voting of the three
principal tickets to be :
Age followers 25,000
Argus followers 22,000
Trades Hall followers ... 19,000.
Higgins was on both Age and Trades’ Hall tickets, and
secured 25,000 + 19,000 votes. Fraser and Zeal were on
the Argus and Age tickets, and scored 25,000 + 22,000
votes each. Styles and Cook, with Trades’ Hall support
only, scored 19,000 votes each. Higgins, Fraser, Zeal,
Cook and Styles got practically the votes here stated
and no more. Take away the Age support from Fraser
and Zeal and give it to Styles and Cook (the highest of
non-newspaper candidates), and they would have got
34,000 votes each. This would have been quite insufficient
to place them as winners—because Wrixon and Sargood
each scored more than 42,000 votes. Wrixon and
Sargood would have been numbered with the chosen,
and Sargood would not have abandoned his trip to
Japan for nothing. It is all very well to gird at
King Dawvid, and tell stories about Zeal’s wee bit
doggie and Fraser’s yellow pup. Let the prophets,
who are wise when the numbers are up, please state
specifically how the elections could have been better
generalled. The sum of it is that the Tories had to be
represented, and instead of getting Wrixon and Sargood,
as they would have wished, they got Frazer and Zeal.
Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.

Dobson, of Tasmania, brings into the Federal
Convention an atmosphere of old, crusted
Toryism that is almost refreshing. Tasmania
is the most Tory province of Australia, and
most of Tasmania seems to be the Dobson
family in one aspect or another. Social recog-
nition in Tas. consists in being invited to Mrs.
Henry Dobson’s parties ; not being recognised
by that charming lady means being in outer
darkness. The Dobsons are the great boss
fossils of the fossil isle, and naturally their
representative isn’t enthusiastic about Federa-
tion. The Dobson crowd can more or less run
Tasmania, but in a Federal Parliament they
would have to jostle with keen, eager, hawk-
like men who had risen from the ranks, and who,
with their new ideas and their haste, would
run right over the Dobsons. Therefore the
Tasmanian potentate beseeches the Convention
to go slow. When one compares the old, stolid,
earthy conservatism of Dobson with the vigorous,
up-to-date article of Richard Chaffey Baker
and Simon Fraser, it is evident that Tas-
mania’s Toryism is so far behind that it can
hardly keep up with the dust that the last
fossil in the procession of Australian fossildoni
leaves behind him as he scoots along. >
S.A. Treasurer Holder advocates that Federa-
tion shall be practically confined to defence,-
quarantine, lighthouses, and a few other trifles.
He doesn’t “see his way ” to include the debts,
because they vary so much in amount per head
of population, &c. ; or the railways, because
they don’t return anything like the same rate
of interest; or the customs, because one province
might contribute more per head than the others.
In fact, Holder’s idea is that until the Federa-
tion can start on a basis of absolute justice it
must not start at all—on which basis nothing
in this world would ever start. The S.A.
Treasurer is also against representation in the
Senate according to population because it would
swallow up the smaller provinces, and he is
against equal State representation because it
would be manifestly unjust. Holder is one of
the great crowd of learned pessimists who see
48 ways of not being able to do something, and
not one effective way of doing anything. The
idea of simply doing the thing as accurately as
possible, and saying nothing about any small,
unavoidable discrepancy, never occurs to pain-
fully accurate people like Holder.
The beautiful T. J. Byrnes, Q. Attorney-
General, now announces that Premier Nelson
and he instigated Gov. Lamington to cable
Chamberlain, when the Premier’s record-reign
invitation arrived, that Byrnes would like to
go too. Byrnes wasn’t asked ; apparently he
wasn’t wanted; and probably Chamberlain
was not even aware there was a Byrnes. But
he perforce responded with an invitation ; the
rules of hospitality didn’t leave him the option
of the North Brisbane electors. He omitted,
however, to cable what he thought of the pro-
ceeding. What does any host think of the
proceedings of a person who fishes for a welcome
at the tail of an invited guest? The secretary
of every banquet committee has to face many
such applications from the horde of self-
respectless bummers. But, in spite of Mr.
Byrnes’s rather remarkable political ante-
cedents, no one exactly expected to find him in
such an attitude.
Barton, Symon, and Glynn were the first
three Federal delegates to pronounce definitely
in favor of a Federal Court of Final Appeal.
Turner, R. E. O’Connor, and Carruthers
were the first three to rise on the other side
and whoop for the good old system, whereby
an Australian Judge is sent to England, 16,000,
miles away, to help in hearing Australian
appeals, while the plaintiff and the defendant
and the whole case toil there after him, instead
of the same man hearing the same case on the
spot. Turner, with his new British gaud on
his soul, thinks the Privy Council appeal
system should be preserved, because it is a
“ link ” binding us to the “mother country.”
Which is a fine example of loyalty at someone
else’s expense. Turner, being personally loyal,
wants a “ link,” and the litigant who is ruined,
in law expenses by his case being carried to the
Antipodes, has to pay for Turner’s link.

Further American advices report the con-
tinued success of saltbush-cultivation on the
Californian alkali plains and in other places
whither Von Mueller’s seeds have travelled.
So great was tire demand for the plant that
seeds, privately raised, were realising up to
sdols. per lb. at the end of ’95. Meantime, the
bank and mortgage co.-ridden squattages of
N.S.W., perpetually overstocked, are being
denuded of the plant, and to a still greater ex-
tent of the even more valuable cotton-bush.
These fodder-plants, covering tens of millions
of acres of State lands, constituted a national
asset of first importance. Yet the province has
allowed all that made these lands of value to
be steadily wiped out; and nowhere has any
encouragement to cultivate the plants been
given. On hundreds of square miles of Wes-
tern grazing country, rolling a few years
back in saltbush and cotton-bush, the latter is
now as extinct as the diprotodon, and the
former as scarce and dwarfed and diseased and
drought-weakened as the blacks are that camp
behind the half-filled shed during shearing and
live Heaven knows where and how the rest of
the year.
Quibble came a cropper, for a wonder, in the
Vic. Supreme Court lately, in his first serious
tilt against the Factories Act. That bite noir
of the sweater and the huckster curmudgeon
and the early morning Chow provides that
every shopkeeper shall permit his assistants to
take a half-holiday each week. “ But,” said
Quibble, “permission implies asking for per-
mission.” “And asking,” replied Common-
Sense, “spells ‘the shoot.’” But, as Law’s
blind eye is towards common-sense, it never
sees consequences, and the counter - jumpers
quaked and didn’t want half-holidays above a
whisper. “Ah! happy thought!” said the
Full Court, “ set a quibble to catch a quibble.
The Court will take judicial notice of the fact
that the assistants desire a half-holiday when-
ever they can catch one, the Act imposes on the
masters an active duty to respond to this de-
sire, and there you have your half-holiday
secure, and the tail of the peacock uninjured.”
There’s a Q.E.D. here somewhere, we are told,
but, anyway, Common-Sense gets home all
right this time.
Up to the time of writing, The Bulletin:
is pleased to note that the Federal Convention
has hardly mentioned even once that the Common-
wealth will be the brightest gem in the diadem of
Hingland, or the grandest jewel in the Ber-ritish
crown ; and Australia’s glorious destiny, and the
Greater Britain in the Pacific, and the beloved
mother-country have scarcely been alluded to.
Also, the Southern Cross is having a well-earned
rest, which that tired constellation must great]y
appreciate, and the National Anathema hasn’t
been sung once. Most of the giddy frill and beer-
froth of tiie ’9l show seem to be absent th.s time,
which is a blessed promise of better things. Aus-
tralia can’t attend to its own business and tie
itself up in convulsions of loyalty at the same
time.

Two Sydney theatres, the Royal and the
Lyceum, gave up the struggle rather suddenly at
the end of last week. Westmacott, ex-manager of
the Royal, gets an influential benefit there next
Monday afternoon (May 5) ; Bracy, the Lyceum
ex-manager, doesn’t get anything in particular.
The experience of the last two years shows clearly
that Sydney can’t keep four theatres and two
variety shows going at once ; out of the six, it
generally happens that two are utterly hopeless,
and one or two more are doing very moderate
business, while one, and only one, is booming.
Two theatres never boom violently at the same
time now ; the material isn’t available. Some-
times there isn’t any boom at all, or the semblance
of one. Whether the theatrical frost that has
been steadily settling down on Sydney for the last
five years is still getting harder, or whether it is
as hard as it is likely to be, is an unsolvable ques-
tion. Meanwhile a lot of public sympathy, and
very little public coin, goes with Bracy, whose
pieces were well-staged, well-played, and in every
way deserving of support, though somehow the
support consistently stayed away. The Royal is
expected to open again shortly under new manage-
ment, but no news of any new lessee for the
Lyceum is to hand.

“ Matsa ” closes at the end of next week,
its last days being soothed by the presentation of
a new edition of itself. The only things which
are notably new about the new edition are some of
the songs and certain breakings-out in a fresh
place by Lauri and Little Gulliver. No one, for-
tunately, has laid a sacrilegious hand on ancient
Memphis with a view to making a new edition of
it, or has interfered with the flood in the Nile, and
Howard Vernon’s mummy is the same soul-filling
old edition as heretofore.
* * * *
“ Sweet Lavender ” is announced for next
Saturday at the Criterion. It is several years
since this pretty little play was staged in Sydney,
and since Dick Phenyl last donned his dusty
barristerial gown, and gathered up his brief, and
tried to dim the radiance of his drinky nose as
counsel for the defendant; and it is about due for
revival. “ Lavender ” is a far more artistic play
than the “ Bookmaker ” —in fact, nothing prettier
than it has been produced in recent years —and
Dick Phenyl, with his mustiness, and his fallen
fortunes, and his aroma of pessimism and beer,
is a live character alongside whom Joseph Trent
is mainly a shriek. Trent is a noble and moral
shriek certainly, but by comparison his shriekful-
ness is painfully apparent. Sydney always had a
profound reverence for “ Sweet Lavender,” who
is a loveable little girl in a neat print frock, and
she should be good for a fortnight at least.
* jfc * *
Business is respectable at the Tivoli and
very flat at the gorgeous Palace, which shuts up
on Saturday for an indefinite period pending the
arrival of new talent. The old talent, which was
quite plentiful enough to keep one house booming,
was insufficient when spread over two, and for the
last week or so the Palace co. has been rather thin
and commonplace. Godfrey has a benefit on
Saturday and departs for England, but as there
will still remain Coleman, Alice Leamar, little
Alma Grey and the Allisons, there should be
enough to keep the Tivoli alive until Rickards*
next batch of attractions begin to arrive.
* * * *
Small shows are uumerous in Sydney just
now. James M‘Mahon has another display of new
picturesathis Cineinatographe, and thenew “Cin.”
at the Crown Studios is doing well. The Royal Stan-
dard, which was practically dead for several years,
is now in possession of a dramatic co., which
slumps on the horror variety of drama—a new
horror every week, or twice a week if wanted—
and runs on the “admission by silver coin ” prin-
ciple. A small and obscure variety co. has
arisen and asserted itself at the Gaiety, another
old-time theatre long abandoned to the ghosts and
the beetles. Still another obscure variety co.
wanders round the suburbs, and raises its soul-
wail in Botany and Camperdown and other such
places. Altogether there is much variety among
the Sydney shows just now, and at least one of
them can only be adequately alluded to with road-
metal.

The Vitascope people at the Edison
Electric Parlor (Pitt-street), announces the receipt
of a phonograph in which can be heard the voice
of Butler, the alleged Glenbrook horrorist.
Butler spoke into quite a lot of phonographs in
San Francisco ; on one occasion he spoke poetry at
an extra high price, but the poem proving not
original the showman sued him for the recovery
of the money. In the present instance Butler
speaks plain prose in his ordinary voice—the one
he is supposed to have negotiated with Lee Weller
in ; and his verbal signature at the end of the re-
marks serves as a guarantee of good faith —at least
The Bulletin presumes so.

This being the last week in Melbourne of
Mr. and Mrs,. Brough and Go., the three farewell
performances of those admirable artists should
need no special recommendation from the press.
The Broughs have deserved well of the city where
B. and B. started business ten years ago, and
where, at the most prosperous moment of its life,
the young firm was burnt out. Also, Melbourne
in general freely acknowledges the debt, therefore
the few opportunities that remain for pouring con-
science money, so to speak, into the Bijou treasury
ought to be rushed by a tearful public. Any-
thing short of a crowded house for the last
(Thursday) night of “Mrs. Tanqueray” will
leave room for an allegation that the aforesaid
public is an ungrateful beast, and if “ Dandy
Dick ” doesn’t bring the season to a glorious finish
The Bulletin will make a point of saying “ dam”
on Robert Brough’s behalf. Meanwhile there is
every reason to hope that “ dam ” will not be
called for.

“Two Little Vagabonds,” which might
have achieved a great success, but didn’t, is re-
tiring from Melbourne Princess’s on Friday night.
A short second innings of “ The Prisoner of
Zenda ” will open on Saturday, and play the pre-
sent company off the premises, where they will re-
appear later with “The Sign of the Cross.”

The Distressed Actors’ Fund takes a
matinee benefit at the Princess’s on Friday (April
2nd). The D. A.F.’s cash in hand is so nearly ex-
hausted that a series of matinee performances —in
lieu of another Dramatic Fete —will be required
to keep this excellent charity going for the next
12 months. This performance, the first of the
series, appeals to the public appetite for “astound-
ing bargains,” rather than to the uncommercial
sentiment of brotherly love. Every man who
buys a ticket receives exceptional value for his
money, and if he can derive further satisfaction
from the knowledge that almost the whole of his
little outlay goes straight into the hand of an in-
digent pro. instead of getting swallowed up by
working expenses, then the ticket-purchaser
doubles the magnitude of his entertainment
accordingly. The bill includes acts from
“A Village Priest” and “Prisoner of Zenda,”
also a new comedietta, a selection of concert items,
and turns by Chirgwin and Will Whitburn.
Finally, the Trial Scene from “Pickwick,” with
J. C. Williamson as the presiding Judge; Purves,
f).C., as Buzfuz ; Miss Florence Terriss as Sam
Weller, and a strong display of well-known
actors, and other professional people presenting
features of interest. Among these will be the
■candidate who was returned at the bottom of the
poll for the recent Federal election.

“ The Derby Winner ” is about to quit the
Royal after a well-sustained run of 42 nights, and
the weird, peculiar laugh of the baffled adven-
turess, when the plump Gussie escapes from her
clutches, must soon fade away into silence. “ A
Woman’s Revenge ” takes the stage next Satur-
day (3rd) with the modest intention of staying for
11 nights only.
* * * *
At the Opera House matters remain about
as lively as usual, or even more so. Chirgwin’s
piebald identity is gratefully received, likewise
Bellman and Moore and My Fancy, and the pro-
gramme in general. A few astounding announce-
ments for Easter will, no doubt, be fired off as
soon as the present condition of absolute furore
and overwhelming ovation begins to cool down.

Seeing that competition is the immortal
soul of show business, The Bulletin observes
with pleasure that Bach’s “Passion” will be per-
formed at St. Paul’s Cathedral this (Thursday)
evening, by organist Wood and a good musical
company. A curtain-raiser, in the form of a short
parsonic monologue, is to precede the oratorio,
and the audience will get at least an opportunity
to join in a chorus during the evening. Tickets
(2s. fid.) are now obtainable at the box-office, on
the distinct understanding that infants in arms
will be refused admission, for, although the King-
dom of Heaven has been likened to a little child,
the sanctuary is no place for an agonised baby
when other music is going on.
Wr * * *
A member of the St. Paul’s (Melb.)
Cathedral chapter puts in a reasonable reply to the
contention that no gate-money should be charged
when the choir gives a special performance. “ Is
anyone prepared to say that those who are willing
to subscribe to the production of this music are
solely bent on amusement, while those who wish
to hear it for nothing are only desirous of an oppor-
tunity of worship ? ” This seems a fairly honest
way of meeting the hypocritical argument that
plate-money is more religious in character than
gate-money. Experience pro vet that a large pro-
portion of the audience at a cathedral musical
entertainment (or “ act of worship ’) don t
contribute a red cent to the plate. Ane
purchaser of a half-crown ticket practically
admits the justice of the plate’s claim to
public support, and is, therefore, a more sincere
churchman, as a rule, than the non-paying wor-
shipper ” whom he elbows out of the tabernacle.
Anyway, there cannot be free music in any church.
From one source or other it is invariably paid for
as an act of worship, more or less, homebody
must provide the cost of this luxurious musical
form of prayer. “No pay, no pray,” is a fairly
good rule to apply to special cases; quite as good
as the doctrine that “ he prayeth best who payeth
least. ”
#* * *
Perth begins to consider itself no small
beer of a show-town. Geo. Jones and Lawrence,
who have made a considerable pile from an “ Olde
Englishe Fayre ” in the Western capital, are the
first lessees of Molloy’s new Theatre Royal, and
partner Jones is coming along to Melbourne to
secure talent for the opening. It is possible that
Brown-Potter and Bellew will be tempted to take
the trip. Business round the goldfields is not
very booinsotne, but the Perth showmen get big
audiences and high prices. Fitzgerald Bros., for
instance, were shocked at their own moderation in
charging only 10s. and ss. per head when they
witnessed che “unseemly rush” for seats in the
tent a few days ago.
At Poverty Point.
A young and effeminate Victorian tenor appeals thus-
wise for praise from any friend who may drop into the
artists’ room during a concert: “ Did you —er —hear my
first song? I’m—er—afraid it didn’t —er —(blush and
simper) go very well. Will you be staying for my—er—
next song? Yes! O, that is nice of you. I will ask you,
then, to kindly go round to the front— with your stick.”
The banging of only one impassioned walking-stick upon
the floor can make a vocalist very happy.
Haresfoot: “ Julius Knight was the recipient, the other
night, of a laurel-wreath from lady admirers. What noble
achievement to deserve the laurel ? Apart from this, the
flower business over men is ever a nausea. Any actor in
the last generation would have regarded it as an insult.”
According to Kalgoorlie Miner, Henri of Navarre
Brownlow is about to marry Miss Rhoda Hay, the charm-
ing Tasmanian brunette who formerly slew the world
with her smile at Heathorn’s, Hobart, and afterwards at
the Sydney Royal Hotel. Even Eastern womankind con-
ceded that Miss Hay was a beauty.
A new comedy company, with Titheradge as manager,
is spoken of as probable in succession to the Broughs. It
would be popular.
“ ‘ Dot ’ Boucicault is stage-managing for George
Edwardes, at the Garrick, Justin M’Carthy’s new comedy,
‘ His Royal Highness,’ ” writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent. “ In the caste are Fred. Kaye, Aubrey
Boucicault, Blanche Massey—looking as of yore, like a
capital T in petticoats when she smiles—and Percy Lyndal,
of the starchy virgin linen. ‘Dot’ was looking for a
theatre, but evidently couldn’t find what was wanted.”
“ Australia’s Ada,” writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “ this month (Feb.) is on tour with Edward
Lloyd, Watkin Mills and Mark Hambourg in the North of
England and Scotland. Every day in the 28, excluding
Sundays, there is a concert, and Miss Crossle.v’s repertoire
consists of two songs with a possible vocalising of the in-
evitable ‘ Sunshine and Rain.’ Her ‘ notices ’ at Birming-
ham were gorgeously grandiloquent, but the unspoilable
Australydy wisely reckons by box-office criticisms only.
She is now fully engaged a year ahead.”
Harry Paulton took to the stare 36 years ago, and made
his first London appearance in 1867. But it is quite pos-
sible that Young Australia will cotton to Paulton’s
humor, which is much less ancient than Johnny Toole’s
“ funniness.”
The Epsom crowd, in Holt’s “ Derby Winner,” Melb.,
consists of 30, at a shilling a night.
Melb. : “ The Salvation Army paid £3O for the Theatre
Royal, all Sunday, and had a ram, jam and cram, but was
out of pocket through the miserable dub-up. They first
went for the Princess, but Williamson sensibly said he
would not let them have it for £150.”
The Melb. Softgoods Association had bills all over town
of a programme of 13 numbers, to be sung between the
acts of the “Little Vags.,” on their night. The stage
performers ought to sit down.
Miss Malone, Australian star of the Fisk Jubilee Singers,
with a Nagel voice, died in America a few weeks ago.
She had been a slave, and her maid was daughter of her
former owner.
Albert Whelan, of Bracy’s Opera Co., is identical with
Waxman, well-known in Melbourne for his imitations of
actors. His Tapley imitation used to take the cake in
that line of entertainment.
Capt. Jack Sutton is a great favorite wherever he goes ;
his genial manner pleases everyone. An instance of his
affability : When touring Maoriland in charge of the cow-
boys with Wirth’s circus the captain was introduced at
Nelson to an Anglican parson. The Satan-puncher was a
great admirer of horseflesh, and expressed his doubts of
the ability of Sutton’s men to tame and ride a certain
well-known “ bucker ” they were announced to tackle the
next day—he was afraid some of them would get hurt.
The captain wasn’t a bit angry at the reflection on the
skill of his men. “ Don’t you flurry your liver, old man,
don’t you flurry,” he replied. “ My boys ’ll ride any
goddam thing with skin an’ hair on, you bet.
S. : “ Critics of ‘ Two Little Vagabonds ’ miss two very
creditable efforts, all the more deserving of praise because
they are small. Atholwood, as an old innkeeper, is on
the stage for about three minutes, but the picture is
accurate and full of little clever touches. Long young
Majeroni, as a liveried flunkey, repays close attention for
a few seconds in one act. To ignore conscientious effort
in small things is to justify the pro. who slurs a part
because there is 1 nothing in it.’ ”
The popularity of “ The Sign of the Cross ” is not likely
to be helped by the sale of the novel in which its story is
told. It is a brutal thing, unredeemed by good writing.
It is dabbled with pore and bulged out with atrocity
Yet parsons have helped to boom the play in London
The clergy, however, seem to have a morbid fancy for the
bloodthirsty and the horrible example, as for example
Fitchett and the Bleed that Smudged the Empire. ’
“ In Sight of St. Paul’s,” Bland Holt’s next novelty at
Melb. Royal, includes a terrific fire. The old Royal was
burnt, the play that night having been the “ Streets of
New York,” with its fire-scene.
It is worthy of note that as soon as an English actor
receives an engagement from an Australian manager he
becomes “ the famous Mr. Buskin ” in the columns of the
Australian press, though previously unheard of at this
end.
At a concert. Cycle enthusiast (as a singer finishes a
skilful rallentando): “By Jove, she can back-pedal all
right, Jack.”
Toole chokes Irving off Australia. Johnny is a sys-
tematic defamer of this hole.
Peart’s dive has been beaten by one Finney, who, at
London Aquarium, dives from the dome into a shallow
tank beneath the floor level, having first ignited his
clothes. This human comet is promptly extinguished on
reaching the aqua pura.
Remember-me-no-more Robinson, according to London
World, is putting the finishing touches to a new opera,
“The Nut-Brown Maid,” “which is very similar to one
that was produced in Melbourne last year.” In Melbourne,
it was called “ Predatoros” —probably because of the sug-
gestions of brigandage from other people’s music made by
the score.
Pinero’s new play, to be produced at London St.
James’s, is a five-act comedy—“ The Princess and the
Butterfly ; or, The Fantastics.”
Pro. : “ I can trace the ‘ Prisoner of Zenda ’ idea in
Madame Celeste’s ‘ House on the Bridge of Notre Dame.’
Celeste acted the Count Feraudy and Zambaro, a gipsy
vagrant boy. Two ruffians tumble the Count through a
trap, into a watery grave. In a few minutes Zambaro
turns up, and is used in personation. Marcus Clarke’s
drama, ‘ Plot,’ produced at the old Melb. Princess’s, dealt
with the Man in the Iron Mask, and had a ‘ Zenda’-like
substitution, Eloise Juno doubling the parts.”
The old-time ironbark pro. who lately joined Melb.
Salvation Army, and who slangwhanged the stage so
vigorously, has “seceded” and gone back to the foot-
lights. Religion, marrow bones and graft, and no
treasury day, were tough morsels to swallow, and not half
as nourishing as the old game, despite its many ups and
downs.
One very plain reason for Johnny Coleman’s triumph
over the broken-hearted Crackles rests in the fact that
Coleman, as an artist, is publicly modest, never appear-
ing to look for applause, but unassumingly going through
his biz. with a doorknocker face. Crackles, on the other
hand, punctuated every point with a painful wait for
gallery' demonstration.
The very latest theatrical novelty comes from Chicago,
where a manager stages a sausage-machine in full blast.
The hog appears on the stage alive and departs in the
form of sausages, distributed among the audience as
“ souvenirs.”
Irving so drills his people that they become replicas of
himself. A plucky little woman, at a rehearsal, drew
herself up, exclaiming, “ If this goes on we shall all be
Irvings 1 ”
Under Cowen’s direction, Lilian Tree lately sang with
the Halid orchestra, at Huddersfield. Every number was
encored ; and Cowen, who is very chary in congratula-
tions, was enthusiastic over Miss Tree’s success. As one
result, she found herself booked for several good engage-
ments. To an impresario who suggested Australia for a
tour in the near future Miss Tree “offered a cold refusal.”
Editor Bulletin, —I regret to inform you of the demise
of James Leo Lewis, a member of my co. for the past four
years. He succumbed to paralysis in Hongkong hospital,
7th inst., and as I can find no address of his relations in
Australia among his papers, I would like to know if his
mother, who belonged to Adelaide, or his wife, who came
from Grafton or the New England district, are still living.
His friends will be comforted to know that everything
medical science could suggest was done for him, and,
having taken charge of his affairs, I have had him buried
in the English Cemetery with customary religious rites,
and have had a handsome tombstone erected over his
grave. I have in my possession several articles of jewel-
lery and other effects which I am anxious to hand
over to his next of kin. If they will communicate with me,
enclosing satisfactory means of identification from local
authorities, with their permanent address, I will be
pleased to send them fuller particulars. Our co. sails for
Shanghai 4th March and remains until April, then Yoko-
hama. —Yours, Bert Willison, proprietor Great World
Circus.
Dear B.—Are your remarks about the “cold cheek” of
Mrs. Maesmore Morris within a mile of being fair and
reasonable? The writer cannot condemn her perform-
ance as the nurse in “The Two Little Vagabonds,” and
so frigidly discounts its merits by assuming all to be due
to arctic impudence. There might be some excuse for
this if the pretty lady had merely “ to stand motionless,
at perfect ease, upon the stage.” But she has to do more ;
she has to act and to talk, and she talks with charming
naturalness and in a voice of uncommon sweetness, and
she acts in a manner that would not discredit an actress
of talent and long experience. Because this was not to
be expected, is it fair to fish round for excuses that repre-
sent her success as discreditable on the whole? As for
the assertion that she will only do well “ as long as there
is nothing particular to be done,” it is easier to win honor
in one's own country by acting than by prophesying, I
believe. —Yours, S.
Phil Stuart will open his Tivoli Gardens at Perth (W.A.)
some time in May, and is now preparing a great inaugural
splash.
Albani does not come to Australia, simply because she
has been offered more to stay in England.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
The scheme of the proposed A.J.S, Bank re-
arrangement is now announced, though it is not definitely
known how far it is on the road to absolute acceptance.
The institution owes to its depositors about £5,100,000 at
414 per cent, and about £1,000,000 at 3£, which makes
£6,100,000 owing and £264,500 a year interest. It is pro-
posed to subdivide these into about £1,500,000 “A”
deposits at 3 per cent, certain ; about £4,200,000 “ B ”
deposits carrying 3 per cent, certain and an additional 1
per cent, if the profits allow, the said 1 per cent, to be
due after certain provisions not yet definitely explained
are made fora reserve fund and possibly a dividend to share-
holders ; and 400,000 inscribed stock (perpetual)deposits
at 3'4j per cent, and an additional 1 per cent, if earned.
On this basis the interest could be kept down as low as
£185,000, being a saving of £79,500, or, if the profits
allowed, it would go as high as £231,000, being a saving of
only £33,500. A side-proviso, however, sets forth that
the ordinary depositors shall have the option of convert-
ing £2,000,000 of their deposits into perpetual inscribed
deposits the 3i per cent, variety. Presumably it is
mainly the “ B” deposits which will be thus convertible,
partly because there are not £2,000,000 of “ A” deposits
altogether, partly because to convert the 3 per cent, of “ A”
deposits into 3!4 and possibly 4£ per cent, inscribed
deposits would be a big sacrifice. Assuming that the
depositors grab eagerly at this privilege for the sake of
the extra interest—which seems tolerably certain—things
will pan out something like this : £1,500,000 “ A ” de-
posits at 3 per cent. ; £2,200,000 “ B ” deposits at 3 per
cent., to be raised to 4 if possible ; £2,400,000 perpetual
deposits at 3£ per cent, to be raised to 4£ if possible.
Therefore theinterest may be as low as £195,000, making
a saving of 169,500, or it may be as high as £241,000,
making a saving of only £23,500.
The largest probable saving, as above shown, is
£69,500 a year, and as the last six months for which
figures are available showed the A.J.S. to be going to the
bad at the rate of £48,200 for the half-year (£96,400 per
annum) the concession isn’t nearly large enough to
make things square. Even if the depositors did not take
up the perpetual 3£ per cent, stock the saving would be
only £79,500, and would leave the bank still going to lee-
ward at the rate of £17,000 a year. Therefore the only
hope seems to be that things may shortly improve, and
what chance there is of an early improvement only those
who know the real nature of the bank’s securi-
ties can say. Hitherto affairs have gone downhill
rather steadily. The “A ” deposits are to be
repaid between jan., 1898 and 1907 ; the “ B ” deposits are
repayable apparently at any date from 1907 to 1917 ; the
inscribed stock deposits are repayable only at the bank’s
option on six months’ notice. A further complication,
however, sets forth that the “B” deposits shall be
secured on certain of the old assets, not yet fully specified,
and whenever the proceeds of their realisation reach
£50,000 the money shall be used to partly pay off the “ B ”
crowd. It is further provided that all new business from
1893 onward shall have absolute priority, and shall be
guaranteed by all the assets of the bank, so how certain
assets are to be specially ear-marked for the security of
the “B ” lot is not yet quite clear. The first impression
is that the scheme doesn’t provide enough relief; the
second that it is lamentably complicated, like all British
reconstruction devices. Another feature is that the
British depositors, who have the smallest interest in
the concern, and who have already got a larger propor-
tion of their money back than the Australians, seem to
be making all the row and doing all the arrangement.
The British depositor has been a reliable curse ever since
’93. The only bank with no British deposits—the Colonial
of Melbourne—got a reduction to 2£ per cent, with no
trouble and no complications, but the J. Bull creditor has
a yearning for elaborate schemes with much incompre-
hensible circuitousness in them. The prospects of the
A.J.S. shareholders are difficult to estimate until more
particulars come along, but they look very moderate at
present.
It is cabled that the House of Lords has altered
the London Bank of Australia’s Reconstruction Bill to
read that the amount of interest immediately payable to
depositors may be reduced, but that the difference
between the new and the old rate shall be a debt still
owing by the bank, which must be paid before any
dividends are declared. If this is really what the House
of Lords intends, then the bank gets no relief at all, and
the reconstruction might as well be dropped. The differ-
ence between paying money which isn’t earned and
owing money which isn’t earned is not large enough to
keep any institution afloat.

The Mutual Life Association shows a very
respectable year’s business for 1896. Renewal premiums
are £126,223, which is £3090 less than last year and £7OOO
less than in 1893. New premiums (£15,278) are £3OOO
more than last year. Interest on investments (£54,580)
is £lOOO better than in ’95, and the total income (£197,722)
is £2OOO better than that of ’95 or ’94, arid only £3OOO
worse than the total for ’93. This is about as good as
could reasonably be expected, and the improvement as
compared with last year is very marked. Out of the above
income £47,993 is added to the funds—fully 19000 more
than last year’s saving—making them £1,135,760. The
association pays away a very large amount in surrenders
(nearly 130,000 in ’96 and over £31,000 in ’95),
else the saving would be much larger. The in-
terest realised on the funds keeps up very well ;
there are practically no arrears of interest—the amount
under this heading is too small to be worth mentioning,
which speaks volumes for the safety of the investments ;
and the item, “properties acquired by foreclosure”
(£64,875) is less than it was last year, which also says a
great deal for the good management of the concern. The
securities have been written down by £10,531, making
£42,806 written off in four years. The woeful slump of
recent times makes depreciation absolutely inevitable in
the best-managed business, and the Mutual Life Associa-
tion takes the wise and honest and solvent course of
meeting the inevitable, and keeping itself square as it
goes along. Altogether, barring the expense account,
there is absolutely nothing to which exception can be
taken.
The Mutual Life Association’s expenses in ’93
were a shade over 28 per cent, of premiums. They got
down below 27 per cent, in ’95, and now they have risen
again to nearly 30 per cent. Barring only the Mutual of
Victoria, the Life Association has now the biggest expense
rate among the seven large life offices of Australasia ; and,
as the Mutual of Victoria is effecting an amalgama-
tion which will result in a very large saving, the Associa-
tion is in a fair way to have the bad pre-eminence of being
the most expensively managed office of any note in this
country. The expense rate is probably inevitable. There
is comparatively little new business to be done in these
bad times. There are seven large Australasian offices,
three small ones, and three American and one English
institution scrambling for what insurance is to be got
among only four million people. The easy terms on
which surrenders are granted makes a big drain under
this heading alone, and it is necessary to find enough
new business somewhere to counterbalance it and the
ordinary losses, so as to keep up the prestige of the
offices. Therefore, a lot of money has to be spent in get-
ting the new business. If the N.S.W. Government, when
it made life insurance compulsory among newly-appointed
civil-servants, had had the courage to make all civil-
servants insure in a new State Life Department—which
would thus have started with a big clientele, a big pre-
mium income, and no expenses to pay for procuring busi-
ness —it could have run its insurance business with an
expense rate of something like 3 per cent as against the
above-mentioned 30. And the advantage to the public of
an office where the difference between these two figures
went in bonuses instead of in ex.’s would be something
enormous.

The Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. (Sydney)
issues its balance-sheet for ’96, and the ordinary life
branch (as distinguished from the industrial 6d.-per-week
department) seems to boom wonderfully. New premiums
are £16,897 against £16,380 for ’95, £12,593 for ’94, and
£7836 for ’93. Renewal premiums are £34,014, whereas
in ’95 they were £24,435 and in ’94, £16,098. Interest on
investments is set down at £4565, whereas in ’95 it was
only £3269, and in ’94, £2387. Out of its total income
of £55,483 the co. has saved £31,059, raising its funds to
£110,510. This result is achieved largely by keeping
the expense rate down to 15 per cent, on total in-
come, and that is apparently done by charging that
much and no more to the ordinary business, and fasten-
ing the rest on the industrial department, which,
of course, is vastly the more expensive branch. The
result is that out of over £30,000 office expenses,
apart from commission, the ordinary branch pays £4529
and the industrial, with about 2£ times the income, pays
£23,131 —over five times as much. In addition, the whole
of the dividend (£2000) and the amount written off furni-
ture are charged to the industrial. What will happen when
the ordinary branch grows so large that the industrial
can’t stand the weight is quite another thing.
The industrial branch doesn’t look quite so well.
Premium income is £129,954 —£4500 better than in ’95,
£10,()00 better than in ’94, and an increase of £22,000 on
’93. Interest and rents (£7973) and sundries bring the
ordinary income up to £138,103. Out of this very large
sum the co. saves and adds to its accumulated funds just
£3112. But a casual windfall —“ profit on realisation of
securities, £8543” brings up the total addition to
£11,655. In ’95, the industrial department saved out of
ordinary revenue £10,500 ; in ’94, £lO,OOO ; in ’93, £22,000.
Comparing these figures with the very humble £3112 of
this year, it seems that the industrial business is getting
very near to the time when all its big income will be re-
quired for claims and expenses. Out of the income of
£138,103 expenses swallow up £74,630, equal to 54 per
cent, of the entire revenue, or nearly 11s. in the £. This
is certainly not so bad as in some previous years, still it
is a heavy item. Apparently, by the way, the ordinary
branch gets somewhat the best assets, as well as the
small end of the expenses; according to the actuary’s
report its assets yielded £4 16s. 2d. per cent, interest last
, v hiip those of the industrial only panned out £4 7s.
6d. per cent.
One point which the average insurer seldom
considers is that the Citizens’ is a proprietary, not a
mutual, institution. Therefore the management rests
wholly with the shareholders; the policy-holders, who
have £275,000 in the concern, have no control, and the
shareholders, who are interested to the extent of £20,000,
run the entire business. Even if the directors borrowed
the whole of the policy-holders’ funds, there is, apparently,
no way in which the latter can interfere. At the recent
meeting an attempt was made to raise the question of
directors’ borrowings from the society, but the motion
was ruled out of order. The Bulletin hears, however,
that the amount borrowed from the Citizens’ Life Co.
on mortgage by certain directors, partly, it would appear,
on their own account and partly as trustees, is fully
£71,000. It has no evidence and has heard no
allegation that the security isn’t good enough or
that the interest isn’t paid regularly. But in the ordinary
course of human nature, if the director applies to himself
for a loan, and passes his own security as good, and
grants himself the loan, he is liable to take a biased view
of the value of the property. Also he can’t be expected
to sue himself for unpaid interest, and foreclose on him-
self, and sell himself up so enthusiastically as he
would some one else, for the sufficient reason that
no one ever kicks himself so hard as he kicks the
Other fellow. Further, the office collector or valuer or
auditor can’t be expected to take such strong measures
with his employer as he would with another man. Alto-
gether, in Tiie Bulletin’s opinion, directors should not
borrow from their own companies—least of all should
they borrow the policy-holders’ money when the policy-
holders have no control over the money—even if the
security is worth three times the loan. The transaction
may be absolutely safe and clean, but nothing will ever
make a censorious world feel sure that it looks safe and
clean. Directorial borrowings were one of the evils
which the Turner Government set itself to stamp out in
Victoria, and what the Victorians don’t know about mis-
managing companies is not worth knowing.

Sydney Civil Service Co-operative Society
shows a half-year’s profit of £3785. Shareholders receive
10 per cent, dividend, 10 per cent, bonus on their cash
purchasers and 3% per cent, on their monthly accounts,
which absorb £3765, leaving a very small balance of £2O
to the good. Capital paid-up is £6993; reserve fund,
£11,500 ; so the position looks thoroughly sound.
* * * *
Perkins and Co. Limited —the old Queensland
brewing business of the oft wrecked Jonah Perkins, now
turned into a company—publishes a balance-sheet which
is calculated to make the big Melbourne blue-ruin men
turn green with envy. The year’s profits are £12,945. A
10 per cent dividend absorbs £6125, leaving £6820 to
carry forward. The previous balance on hand was
£18,593, so this makes a total of £25,413 accumulated pro-
fits on hand. By way of bonus, it is proposed to give
every shareholder one additional share for each four
shares he now holds, thus converting £14,583 of the
accumulated profits into capital. Considering how many
wrecked ships the original Perkins got safely ashore
from, the buoyancy of his co. is perhaps quite natural.
* * * *
One of the many mysteries which had to be
sorted out when the B.N.Z. became a Govt, concern is
that of Walter Guthrie and Co. The Guthrie concerns
apparently lived more or less on the B.N.Z. for years
past. The beginning was the firm of Guthrie and
Larnach, which was a great timber affair in the boom
days. It was floated into a limited co. which went from
bad to worse for some years, and finally closed up, and it
was alleged in some quarters that the B.N.Z. lost £lOO,OOO
altogether in the wreckage. Then Walter Guthrie and
Co. emerged, and after a time this grew to be
Guthrie and Co., Limited, and became more or less
connected with the Pine Co., the Gore Timber Co.,
the Colonial Co., the Southland Co., the Dunedin
Timber Co. and the City Saw-Milling Co. These concerns
owned a lot of each others’ shares, and owed each other
money, and drew bills on each other, and ran up another
big overdraft, or series of overdrafts, with the long-
suffering B.N.Z. When the B.N.Z would supply no more
money the inevitable winding-up set in, and seems likely,
by present appearances, to last till the crack of doom.
The present writer’s knowledge of Maoriland affairs goes
back into the seventies, and he doesn’t remember a time
when a Guthrie co. wasn’t bossing the Otago and South-
land timber-trade, and reputed to be in some trouble or
other with the B.N.Z.
The record balance-sheet of the year comes to
hand from the Assets Purchase and Realisation Co. (Mel-
bourne). It sets forth that, for the six months ended
13th February, the receipts were £3 13s. 9d. and the
expenses £4463, so the loss is £4459. The accumulated
loss two years ago was £2014 ; it is now £15,796, so the
co. seems to be having a real good time. As the paid-up
capital is £31,114, it thus appears that more than half of
it is already gone. The co. owes £16,000 to the City of
Melb. Bank and ChafTey Bros. Limited, both in liquida-
tion, so it evidently had quite a remarkable gift of putting
its money into the worst kind of investments. It has £60,000
worth of alleged property, and the balance-sheet doesn’t say
anything about one penny being received as interest or
rent, so it would almost seem as if all the investments
were up a tree together. If so, it would be interesting to
know how much the Assets Co. hopes to pay in the £.
The principal asset seems to be £40,000 worth of
city property mortgaged for £28,500. The Assets Co., by
the way, was run into its present astounding situation
under the management of some of those business men of
“ the right stamp,” who, it was said, would be scared out
of the directing business if the Government started
interfering with company management. The advisable-
ness of not scaring these valuable men out of the business
shines forth in these two items : receipts, £3 13s. 9d. ;
expenses, £4463.
The recent alleged frauds (to the tune of =£4000)
on the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society by means of
forged mortgages seem to suggest looseness in both man-
agement and auditing. Of course it is easy enough to forge
a mortgage —especially where the property is held under
Torrens’ title—but a mortgage has to be supported by
the title to the property, and it is not easy to forge that
and have it passed by the co’s solicitor. Every well-
regulated co., lending on mortgage, requires its solicitor
to certify in writing that everything is in order before the
money is paid over, and, as a further check, it is the
auditors’ clear duty to see periodically that all advances
are vouched by the production not only of the mortgage
but the title-deeds and the solicitor’s certificate. Recent
banking and other disclosures seem to show that audit by
officials nominally appointed by shareholders is more or
less a farce, and (The Bulletin says this for the thou-
sandth time) legislation is urgently required making
compulsory a yearly State audit of all banking and insur-
ance institutions.

Melbourne (writes a commercial correspondent)
is on the up-grade again. The shoals of bill-shavers and
other bummers who disappeared during the dark days of
depression are creeping back from Lord knows where to
their old haunts. Daily, faces familiar in the old days,
but which suddenly evanished, meet you unexpectedly at
Collins-street corners, and in reply to ordinary greetings
these ghosts of the past remark that they have just re-
turned to the old pitch to see how things are moving
along. Some of them fade away again, but a great many
stick to the pitch full of schemes that have millions in
’em. They never appear to hook anyone, but there they
are, up to date in dress, living on the fat of the land, with
cash in their own pockets and both hands in those of
other peop I '' whenever opportunity offers.

“ The will of W. Pattison, one of the Mount
Morganaires, has been lodged for probate. The estate is
valued at £447,000.” Surely some mistake. W.P. was
supposed to have lost all his money years ago in buying
Mt. Morgans up to £l7 and making gigantic wagers that
they would go to £2O. He made short work of a heap of
money. One election trip to Rockhampton is said to
have cost him £20,000. All the other big holders seem to
have taken warning by Pattison, who was a good butcher
but a bad mining speculator.

Rhodes, and Co., and he now draws more money from his
S. African speculations than from Mt. Morgan.

Kalgoorlie : “ All the batteries are fully sup-

purchasers.” If the pumps at work in the water-shafts
don’t soon make a wonderful difference in the supply the
accumulation of ages in a drought-stricken country—the
place will be the water phenomenon of the world. The
soft auriferous channels of the Boulder lodes are just the
places to find water, but the chances are that, as in the
case of other dry camps, pumps and time will greatly
diminish if not entirely exhaust it.

“ Phenomenally rich stone has been struck in the
Fortune-of-War, W.A. It is the best yet taken out of the

rich ore.” Thus endeth another W.A. pocket.

A start has been made to re-open the copper and
lead mines of Northampton, Westralia. They were
worked over 30 years ago, and the first W.A. railway was
built to connect them with the coast. An early WA.
Governor declared that the production of copper and lead
would be the staple industry of the country. The mines
went down with the price of those metals, and the district
changed from the leading mining to the chief pastoral
region of the province. This scheme is apart from
Brookman’s, to work copper and erect smelting-works in
W.A. Whatever the result, there is bound to be more
discrimination than in the gold-boom, and much less rob-
bery and money wasted on “cats.” It is hard to salt a
copper-mine, and impossible to float one on rich copper
specimens. * * *
The amazing richness of the discovery made in
the Golden Ridge mine, W.A., is indicated by the share
market-sales, 9d., Bd., 7d. “ Put not your faith in
news wires from Westralia,” is engraven on public
memory. % «
From one of the big managers of one of the big
mines at Hannan’s to The Bulletin : “ Our camp is
developing wonderfully well, every drift we drive and
sink we make developes rich ore. The Boulder is a great
success on the 300 level. They have a west lode which is
about 7ft. wide. The ore next the walls is a schist, while
the centre of the reef is a blue quartz. The schist will
average 3£oz., and the blue quartz 7oz. per ton. The sul-
phides are rich, but there is a high percentage of free
gold. The fever is very bad here, and the country is
overrun with labor. Do what you can to keep men away,
for there is really nothing for fresh hands to do. The
producing mines as well as all leases with any prospect
are full-handed. By the death of ‘ cats ’ many hundreds
of men have been thrown out, and other 1 cats ’ are dying
daily with the same result.”
• * » *
The silence of a graveyard is not in it compared
to the quietude surrounding the Maritana mine at Han-
nan’s. Surely its great richness cannot have petered, and
yet the management would hardly turn out thousands of
ounces of gold in the dark. That would not be right in
these days of mining freedom and enlightenment! The
writer has much pleasure in reminding the public of the
good things said of this mine a few months ago. “Care-
ful inspection leaves no doubt that the Maritana has
struck the main lode of the Great Boulder, and has get it
richer than the Boulder itself.” Nothing is yet known of
the size of the lode in the Maritana, as only 3>4ft. has
been driven, but there is no doubt the whole formation
will average over 20ft. and the prospects average over soz.
to the ton.” . . . “It is now considered certain that
all the mines on the line must get the Boulder lode, while
the green lode of the Croesus is pronounced to be the
main reef of the district.” There are columns of this
sort. Said of Bravo Jones, who was one of the first
directors, that being asked if he had suffered on his Wes-
tralian trip he replied, “ No —only from the shock of see-
ing the Maritana mine.”
Westralian mining prospectuses, asked for by
the writer recently, are coming to hand, and they show
such an awful gulf between anticipation and realisation
that many of the W.A. experts must wish them out of
print or destroyed. Sooner or later these things must
rise in judgment against them. One at a time : Hannan’s
Napier, once called Maritana South. Bull put up £20,000
working capital for one-fifth of the co. on the strength of
reports and assays. “One of the ironstone specimens
from the Napier showing no visible gold was assayed by
Johnson Matt.hey for 128 oz. 16dwt. to the ton.” One
expert : “ I have not seen the equal to the Napier in the
district for the number of r'eefs and richness.” Another :
“ A great quantity of gold was taken from this reef esti-
mated by the prospectors to be about £l5OO worth.” A
third : “There are 10 reefs all carrying gold.” What has
become of the mine ?

Coolgardie : “ The Hon. W. Casey, who floated

“ The public batteries at Northam will be ready
to start next week. Contracts have been made with
several mines close to town to send ore down amounting
to 120 tons a day. Large numbers of leases are raising

teries right in Coolgardie instead of training the ore three
hundred miles? Want of water? Then all we hearabout
the removal of the water trouble is a lie. Or is it want of
gold?

Lode cut at the 300 ft. level. It is under 2ft. thick, and,
so far, only samples about an oz. to the ton. It is ex-
plained that, as in the case of the Boulder, some driving
has to be done before the lugger and higher grade ore
body is met with. Also, that at this level the ore is a
little better than it was at the same point above.

Premier Forrest, at Bunbury : “Don’t let any-
one forget that we are crossing the stream, and that this
is a very anxious time in the history of W.A. and for those
in power. There has been a great deal of booming in our
mines, and in some cases the investors had got no return,
while in others they have received ample reward.
Development must take the place of booming. No
country can go on living on booming.” All hope of the
new boom coming early this year is abandoned ; prayers
for a new boom are mingled with curses on account of
the boom that has passed away. Zeb Lane attributes the
“slump” to the war scare. Lane is no fool and knows
better. Great is the name of Lane—because of the acci-
dental greatness of the Boulder group of mines.

N.S.W. Public Service Board has made sub-
stantial additions to the first-fixed salaries of the out-

goes up £9O to £650 ; J. Hebbard, the inspector at Broken
Hill, goes up £lO5 to £350 ; the other inspectors, Milne
and Godfrey, £3O each, making the pay £275. The pay
now may be good enough for the officers ; but it is none
too much for the offices. The opinion of a man drawing
£245, or even £350, a year could hardly be expected to
be quite convincing to the thousand and two-thousand-a-
year B.H. managers. And in the present state of the
N.S.W. mining regulations, several of the most important
of which have been judicially declared to be rubbish, the
inspectors have to depend almost entirely for their
influence with the managers upon the weight of their
individual opinions.

From London to The Bulletin : —“ The big
monthly yield from the Gibraltar has attracted attention
here. Shares are in demand, and they will, I think, go
higher if the market is led to believe that anything like
3000 oz. a month can be kept up. It will also help along
N.S.W. mines owned in London, and cause others to be
sold.” .The general impression has been that the mine was
not nearly big enough to keep up such an output, that
the vein was so small and the ground so hard it was only
a matter of a few months when the mill would have to
wait on the mine for ore. It would seem, however, that
other veins in other mines acquired by the co. have been
developed and are likely to furnish large quantities of
stone, that the Gibraltar vein itself has been proved of
greater length than formerly worked, and altogether the
future of it is bright. Owing to the complete failure of a
boring-plant and the great difference in the cost of hand-
work where all the power is supplied by water develop-
ments are a little behind, and consequently a smaller
output for two or three months will soon have to be
faced, but a regular and continuous output and yield are
promised. Certainly the co. for its pluck deserves it all.
Northern mining men are dropping off quickly.

Chief-Secretary Chamberlain is treating
the Australian Premiers rather shabbily on their
visit to London. He is lodging them in a hotel.
Now, when old Li Hung Chang visited London
he was given the use of a mansion in Carlton
House Terrace. When the son of the Ameer of
Afghanistan was there last year he, too, was given
a mansion, with servants, &c. Surely an Aus-
tralian Premier is as important a person as a dog-
eating, pig-tailed Chow Viceroy, or a harem-keep-
ing young savage from Central Asia. Any two-
penny-halfpenny German princeling would have
rooms in one of the Palaces around_ London—St.
James’ Palace, Hampton Court—or in one of the
. numerous official residences. But an Australian
Premier is made the “guest of the nation” in a
pub.—which pub., by the way, was mostly built by
Jabez Balfour, Esq. Perhaps Chamberlain is
under the impression that the Melbourne boomsters
are still in office.

A little story is going round the Northern

Inspectors who wanted carriers from a native
chief who was not disposed to be friendly. The
Papuan, after some barneying, directed his men to
plant a cocoa-nut on a stump and then stood his
best marksmen off at a distance and bade them
shoot the cocoa-nut full of arrows, which they im-
mediately did. Spearmen then transfixed the
nut with spears in featly fashion. Whereupon
the boss sharpshooter among the whites placed a
salmon-tin on the cocoa-nut and shot a hole
through it from a distance of 200 yards. A
friendly chief, however, brought the parties to
reason and peaceful arbitration.

Justice Simpson in a last-week Sydney
divorce-case—
He was of opinion that clearly adultery had been com-
mitted by the wife. At the same time the husband had
conduced to the adultery by his cruelty and negleot;
nevertheless, that adultery prevented the wife obtaining
the relief she asked for. Both had committed faults
against the marriage contract, and the law was clear on
the matter. Neither could obtain any relief.
O, admirable law ! If one party is proved
thoroughly unfit to be united in marriage, a
divorce is granted ; if both parties are thoroughly
unfit, they must drag their chain until the end.
One crime dissolves the marriage bond, two crimes
tighten it! What logic ! what wisdom !

peared in The Bulle-
tin a good while ago,
when that lady’s vocal
excellence and oper-
atic possibilities were
not generally recog-
nised by Australian
critics. Up to that
time Marie Elster’s
appearances in grand
opera parts had been
confined to an unlucky
Westralian season,
and barring one or two
short engagements in
Melbourne she got no
chances to turn her
notes into gold on this
side of the world.
Early in ’95 Miss
Elster went ’Ome, a
buxom matron, with
a physique of the
genuine prima-donna
type and a beautiful,
well-trained soprano
voice which Jwas still
young enough to grow
stronger. Also, the
enterprising artist had
much brains and a
limited knowledge of
stage business. . After
arriving in Great Bri-
tain she fell ill, and
lost some time in
recovering her health
before she could make
a fair start as the new
Australian prima-
donna of Neilson’s
Opera Company. Miss
Elster was an immedi-
ate provincial success
on the charm of her
singing. Presently she
began to score as an
actress likewise, in
“Eaust,” “IlTrova-
tore,” and English
opera, and two months back she made her
London debut as Santuzza in “Cavalleria
Kusticana. Ada Crossley, who was present
on this occasion, reports that her friend from the
Antipodes was voted “ a magnificent Santuzza ”
by certain magnates in the operatic world. A
Covent Garden engagement for Miss Elster has
been runted at, and her name, already made, seems
certain to expand into a “great name’’ within
the next few months.

Some months ago, a schoolmaster opened
a private school in a N.S. W. 'country district. His
pupils’ fees soon got in arrears. Verbal and
written requests to their parents for money being
of no avail, he one day locked the scholars up and
sent a boy to their parents with the message that
Jim and Lucy were impounded, and would be
kept in pound until released by payment of amount
owing for school-fees.” The last of the nine im-
pounded urchins was released at half-past ten that
night, and two days afterwards The Bulletin
informant met the schoolmaster, with his drum
up, making for Mulga town at the rate of four
knots: an hour.

At Melb. University annual commence-
ment the other day nine women were made
Bachelors of Arts and four Masters of Arts ; like-
wise, one was capped Master of Science. Three of
the six matriculation exhibitions and all three
entrance exhibitions in musical subjects fell to
girls ; likewise two Arts exhibitions, all three
music ditto, and one in medicine. Three final
honor scholarships in Arts, two Wyselaskie
scholarships (big cash prizes running into three

Rev. M‘Donald, of Westralia, told, in
Rockhampton the other day, how he preached at
Mullewa (W.A.) in
the dining-room of
a large hotel. While
preaching, he no-
ticed the congrega-
tion kept slipping
round a screen to
the rear at intervals,
and discovered,after
service, that the bar-
keeper had told the
hearers that they
could call round and
have a drink if they
felt at alldry during
the sermon. What
a magnificent idea !

Melb. commercial-travellers held a male
beauty-show at their picnic, the other day, and
seven lady-judges plunged for a beautiful drum-
mer named Chapman, who has supplied the illus-
trated weeklies with pictures of his lovely face
and is flourishing as a society beauty in the space
usually devoted to a classically-draped barmaid
with a limp lily and consumptive expression.
True, beauty is only skin-deep, but in a drummer
that depth is considerable depth.

The jury sittings for the trial of Sydney
oauses concluded on March 26, leaving ten
remanets, nine of which must stand over till May
30. Inis means to the litigants concerned both
wearymg suspense and grievous expense. In the
Webb-Larpent-Leaver case witnesses were at
hand and another day or two might have ter-
minated the proceedings, but now a shoal of per-
sons will either have to scatter all over Australia
or be maintained in Sydney for two months.

vor of two gilded

with the celebrated
N.S.W. Corps) hav-
ing made over to the

goon and 700 acres of
surrounding lands,
whence the Harmy

exclude the public,
who have been ac-
customed to camp
and fish there. Go-
vernment will be
petitioned for an ap-
proach to the lagoon,
which is declared to
be tidal and there-

“A requiem

N.S.W. Public Service Board recently
advertised for a shorthand-and-typewriter clerk.
There were over 50 applicants, including four well-
known newspaper reporters, also a man holding
the Victorian law courts’ reporting certificate.
The fact that it is worth the while of such well-
qualified persons to go after a £3 a week billet
casts lurid light on the oft-repeated statement of
shorthand teachers and typewriter importers that
there is an unlimited demand for competent
operators.

A fact as strange as Bret Harte’s fiction.
A true tale from Eastern Gippsland. A store-
keeper in a small township between
Bruthenand Omeo “ packed ” some
goods out to a miner’s hut on the
Gibbo Range, and found on arriv-
ing there that the miner was away
somewhere in the surrounding deso-
lation on a prospecting tour, and
that his wife was in bed, and a
little stranger was quite imminent.
Necessity knows no law of con-
ventionality. The storekeeper
“Sairey-Gamped ” the little stran-
ger, and both are doing well, but
that grocery man has acquired a
nickname that he will never out-
grow, and finds life not worth living
on account of being knocked up at ungodly hours
by bucolic jokers, who inform him with much ap-
parent excitement that his services are in urgent
request down at Mrs. Blank’s on the flat or up
the creek at old Whatshisname’s.

In a Sydney court, the other day, a bank-

interests of social economy, and the results of his

How they die in the bush. On Boatman
Station (Q.), lately, four hapless swaggies ran short

Rudall, the man who is conducting the
search for the two lost explorers, reports, re the
pair of skeletons which he found in the desert:
“ I remarked to Trottman at the time that one
man had large feet.” That is practically the
whole epitaph and obituary of the pair. No one
knows who they were, or when they died, or what
they died of. There isn’t even a recollection of
two men having dropped out of notice anywhere,
or a theory as to why they went out into these
regions. All that can be said is that two men
sometime or other left their bones out there, and
one of them had large feet. The other one doesn’t
even get that scant allowance of personal obituary.
He is merely the man who was with the man that
had large feet. It is impossible to die much more
indefinitely than that, even in this Great Disap-
pearance Land. Name, age, birth-place, date and
cause of death all lost, and not even a personal
characteristic to hang as a tag on to his bones.
Simply the dead unknown who was found along
with the unknown who had bigger feet than usual.

The funniest thing in connection with
the late monster meeting of the Salvation
Army in Melbourne passed without com-
ment. When Panjandrum Booth handed the
£ 1000 Indian famine-fund cheque to Mrs. Booth
he requested the immense audience—over 3000—
to smile so that the photographers on the platform
might be able to snatch a flashlight picture of one
enormous grin of benevolence. They smiled- -the
whole 3000 of them—simultaneously. Now the
average ‘Army’ mouth —distended as it is by
much hallelujahing and ‘ volleying ’ —must be at
least 4in. wide when at full stretch. Therefore,
if these 3000 smiles were placed in a row they
would make one vast, appalling grin 300 yards
long—a chasm of affability which could have
demolished a corned - beef sandwich weighing
nearly 7cwt.—at an ounce to the inch —in one
terrific bite ! What a blood-curdling sight for a
caterer !

Many of the Methodist parsons of Australia
are playing on a small scale the part which some

Ovide Musin’s company
of musicians visits Sydney
for the third time (for the
principals) during Easter
week; and instead of
“Stabat Mater,” on Good
Friday, the Town Hall will
echo cheerful concert strains.
Musin is a manly musician
whose hair is cropped com-
paratively short, and whose
only airs are those bracketed
with his name on the pro-
grammes, He says he is a
Belgian, but the rollicking
way wid him justifies his
friends’ suspicion that he
really hails from Ballyhooley.
On this occasion, besides
Mine. Musin and her smiles
and her voice, and Mons.
Violon, and his collection, of
stamps, Musin brings with
him that trusty pianist,
Eduard Scharf, and Alfred
Hill, the young Maoriland
violinist, composer, and con-
ductor. Baritone Burns
Walker will specially assist
on Good Friday. But it is
on Miss Constance Hat-
herly that perhaps the keenest
hopes centre. Miss Con-
stance, who is a kind of
Crichton in petticoats, being
a chess-player of weight and
a swimmer of amazing
mettle, has already, though
young, won distinction as a
harper.- She is a medallist
of the Lond. Academy, and
was pupil to tb s great
Oberthiir—than vhom no
harper has been more cele-
brated since David himself.
Miss Hatherly is said to
have added something of his
magic to her own, and it
is confidently hoped that
Sydney audiences will greet
her not only with pleasure but with enthusiasm.

Though the Victorian Government is a not
over-merciful crowd, young Phillips will probably
not be hanged, in view, among other things, of
the fact that the jury said, in answer to the Judge,
that they believed t\p bought the pistol to send to
his brother, and that he did not take it to Cooper s
office in order-to shoot Brady. To hang a youth
of 19 years in .face of such a finding would be
utterly at variance with the strong and ever-grow-
ing public sentiment that capital punishment,
where inflicted at ail, should only be awarded for
murder with malice aforethought in the lay sense
of the term.
To hang the condemned youth Phillips
Vic. Govt, would have to get a fresh apd competent
executioner, the old ghoul, Pauling, having dis-
appeared months ago. It’s hard to get hold of a
hangman who really knows the ropes, and Pauling
was a perfect windfall when he assumed office.
The previous strangler, Jones, cut his throat in an
attack of d.t’s on the day before Mrs. Knorr, the
Mons. OVIDE MUSIN.

whole of the officials were in a quandary a wire
came from Pauling (who had previously acted as
“assistant ” at two or three functions of the kind)
applying for the hideous billet.
All last week there was to be seen around
the entrance to Cole’s Book Arcade, Melb., a little
crowd of women (varied by an occasional kerris-

sign a petition for the reprieve of “Willie”
Phillips. But Willie, nevertheless, is a very dis-
puted point. At the principal pubs, and irreli-
gious city business houses, also at the Stock
Exchange and such-like haunts of the ungodly,

the local hangman might have worked up quite a
big petition in favor of enforcing the Law’s sen-
tence. “ Corrupted innocents,” who shake the till
and slaughter the head-bookkeeper when settling-
day arrives, don’t appeal to the worldly sympathy
of commercial circles.

The other day, at Singleton (N.S.W.), two
sheep-stealers were sentenced to three months’
gaol. How does this compare with Judge Gibson’s
monstrous sentence of three years for stealing a tin
of baking-powder, value about ninepence ? Is there
any sense of proportion among N.S.W. Judges, or
does each Judge go entirely by his liver ’
S.M. Herald takes Justice Williams (Vic.)
to task for giving two years (with periods of “ soli-
tary ”) to an oft-convicted petty larcenist who had
again come up for sentence. “ There is something
shockingly inhuman in a sentence of two years
hard labor, and the solitary confinement amounts
to barbarity,” says the Herald— which, however
is strangely silent re an apparently far more cruel
case at its own front door —the above - quoted
ninepenny in which N.S.W. Judge Gibson, the
other day, gave three years (involving nine months
“ solitary ” !).

A Leichhardt larrikin was fined £3 or two
months’ gaol by a Sydney magistrate a few days
ago. A little before that another magistrate m a
Sydney court fined an illicit-still worker £3OO or
six months’ gaol. If the larrikin’s cash basis was
all right it should have been 200 months, or over
16 years for the still-worker. Or, the other way
about : if the latter’s fine bore a fair proportion to
his term of imprisonment it should either have
been £3 or If days, or else £lOO or six months for
the larrikin. As magistrates persist in these dis-
proportions, why does not Parliament take the
scandal in hand ?

INUNDATION OF THE NILE.
Forty Miles Wide at Memphis.—Great Damage to
Property.
LONDON, March 22.
The River Nile has rapidly overflowed its banks, and
the country is inundated. At Memphis the river is 40
miles wide. Great damage has been done to property.
Fifty persons have been drowned.
The big Webb-Leaver (Sydney) slander
case shows how entirely the public is at the mercy
of the daily press. The Herald and Telegraph
versions of the trial give totally different impres-
sions of the evidence, the parties, and the merits.
Some evidence: —
Mr. Heydon : Were these the only two occasions on
which you searched your husband’s pockets ?
Witness : I think those were the only occasions. •
Mr. Heydon : Are you sure ?
Witness: Well, when I was at all suspicious I always
searched Mr. Webb’s pookets.
Mr. Heydon : Was it not hundreds of times ?
Witness : No, it was not.
Mr. Heydon : Were you not suspicious-many; times ?
Witness : I searched many times, and I did not find
Mr. Heydon : How many times did you find letters ?
Witness :On three occasions. I searched every time I
was suspicious. . , „
Mr. Heydon : What did you do with the third letter?
Witness: It was taken from me before I had time to
securt it. Mr. Webb was writing in the office and I
watched him, and read it when he was out of the office,
but I had no time to take a copy before he returned.
Mr. Heydon : Then that is the way you used to compass
him round with sweet observances?
Witness : Yes.
THE STORY OF THE FLOOD.
Grandmamma went to the play,
(Grandmamma is ancient very)
There she saw in bright array
Memphis (now a cemetery).
Poor old Granny ! Poor old dame !
Thought that “ Matsa ” was no fiction,
So when the cable message came
She told her lore in choicest diction.
Memphis on the Nile (a dream)
Was to her still bright and chippy,
And she knew not, it would seem,
Memphis on the Mississippi.
Who can blame her, for it may
Once have happened as she stated ;
Granny’s merely (that’s her way)
Some six thousand years belated.

Lenkowe: As Judge Gibson appears to dis-
tinctly admit that the sentence (three years for stealing a
tin of baking-powder !) was awarded partly because of the
theft—which was the only thing he had any right to deal
with —and partly because of the £l9 9s. which the country
is out of pocket, by reason of the fact that the accused
refused to let the Police-court deal with him, and insisted
on being remanded to quarter sessions; also, partly
because of the worry of trying the prisoner at all; his
Honor should be requested by the authorities to say
exactly how much extra gaol was put on by reason of the
two latter considerations, and that part of the sentence
should be remitted. Also, he should be advised of the
unwisdom of opening his mouth to give reasons and
putting both feet in it; and recommended to keep his
temper. Just think of it—three years in gaol (including
nine months’ solitary confinement) for stealing nine-
penn’orth or so of soda-and-acid ! Lloyd J. : Now, do

only for the man in workman’s garb. We challenge you,

last 50 years in which a young blackguard of “society”
parents has been tied up and flogged. We challenge you
to name one instance in which a sexual-offender of the
broadcloth-and-belltopper order has been lashed—though
there have been hundreds of such offenders bowled out,
and we have seen several of them behind the spikes with
our own eyes. There is no magistrate who dare lash a
young man with a society mother and nice, scented
Government-House-list sisters; whereas any brute of a
beak can safely lash a poor fisherman—never, it would ap-
pear, previously before court in all his life for any offence
—who had been guilty of not altogether voluntary expo-
sure while drunk on board a harbor steamer. Yes, that
fisherman was the very first person flogged under the new
N.S.W. lashing regulations.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 30,1897.
Mr Dear Myee—
The Centennial Hall was nearly, but not quite,
filled on Saturday afternoon by people who paid
for admission to Miss Constance Evelyn’s farewell
sing-song, and as all the artists filled the bill
gratuitously, Miss Evelyn will have a substantial
residuum of profit to take her to the under-world.
The front-seaters were all in elaborate attire.
Women dress more for a Town Hall concert than
for the theatre in Sydney, because in the large
spaces of the vestibules and corridors their glories
are more gazed upon ; in Melb. it is the other way
round. The Princess foyer sets off a graeefully-
godetted skirt, but Town Hall aisles are crushing.
The draw of the concert was the new baritone,
Mr. Burns-Walker, a Byronie youth whose photos,
have been beautifying George-street lately. He
knows how to sing, and was rapturously received.
The women love him —his baritone raised in pas-
sionate Italian ditties makes ’em cry, and he threa-
tens to take the place of the lamented Ryley. Miss
Evelyn, in yellow silk with lace and fur adornings,
sang “ Che faro,’ and the inevitable “ Sunshine
and Rain,” and bowed over many bouquets.
Everybody was encored—the performance conse-
quently lingered on until nearly 11.
While dailies continue to keep gushing over us
as a distinctly musical community, I observe that
the distinctly musical units who help to make up
the community continue to keep on departing
from us. Every week one or two aspiring song-
birds or instrumentalists sail away to get a musical
education, which education, when achieved, they
carefully keep away with. Past week Yvonne
Leverrier went away in the German liner with
her family to visit her ancestral land of Brittany;
and Nellie Young, leaving by same boat with her
bridegroom, Wiedermann, was adorned, ere de-
parting, with a golden lyre on behalf of Sydney
Liedertafel.
While the vessel was tied up at the Quay the
Barbarossa band used to play selections every
afternoon on deck, to the delight of passengers by
the North Shore ferry-boats, always ending up
with “ God-save ” as an attention to Grandma ; if
the “Watch on the Rhine” was played, it wan-
dered into the programme incidentally. The ter-
rifying notice to beware of the screw, painted on
the enormous stern, wasn’t translated as it was on
the Friedrich. To be chopped up by a twin screw
would be bad enough, but it would add to the
horror of the situation to be minced by a “doppel-
schraube.”
Some new plums were inserted into the “Matsa”
hotch-potch on Saturday. Florence Young
dashea through Royle and Caron’s “Federation ”
song with spirit and the help of chorus, waving
the Australian flag ; but it suited J ules Simonsen’s
manly tenor better when sung by him a fortnight
ago without orchestral aid. Little Gulliver and
Lauri burlesqued the topical song of panto, by
merely naming the subjects and saying nothing
about them, a profound method of treatment
which caught on. A coon song was sung by Carrie
Moore and Ivy Scott in verandah hats and striped
cotton clothes. The d.c. was crammed with
juveniles for the matinee. Two or three curled
darlings were got up in Fauntleroy style, and
several fairies of about five or six looked sus-
piciously aureolined as to the hair. But, as a
rule, the Australian mother can’t be accused of
overdressing her cherubs. She sensibly ties a
large, floppy hat on her daughter’s curls and en-
cases her in a print or muslin “ Mother Hubbard,”
and rigs her boys out comfortably in “Jack Tars.”
Queen Victoria’s benevolence to the extent of
■£lo has been awarded an aged couple named
O’Neill at Port Hacking. For years the old lady,
whose first husband was cook in the Royal kitchen
at Windsor in Uncle William IV.’s time, has
retailed scraps of antique reminiscences to tourists,
and a kindly visitor seeing the destitution of the
pair—the old man is an ex-soldier, short-serviee-
without-pension man—interested himself, and was
the means of getting the royal bounty forwarded.
A good opportunity this for the “ loyal ” press to
have the recipients of H.M.’s gift photographed
for publication. The cheque might also be repro-
duced pictorially and gazed at re vertxitially by
adoring subscribers.
Church millinery is the cause of many ructions
and much ill-feeling between the lately-departed
Bishop Smith and some of his clergy, who consider
the Primate’s view on the width of a chasuble’s
hem to be dangerously heretical. The “high”
contingent, who like a fancy ceremony, pay their
pew-rent to see the parson proceshing around the
church every Sunday, hands pressed together and
thumbs up and a piece of needlework pinned to
his coat behind, and feel swindled if the rites are
not conducted on those lines; whereas “ Mary
Ann Smith,” as the late Canon Kemmis used to
call him, is grovellingly “ low,” and the contempt
felt for his ideas of running a service by the brass-
candlestick-and-cope-and-all party is more bitter
than the hatred of the Greek Christian for Islam.
At a certain city theatre, one night last week,
pros, played to a d.c. numbering six ; at another
show, suburban, only four had handed in the neces-
sary silver coin at opening time. Actors now
swap stories about record poor houses. Up to date,
nobody has gone one better than an experience of
the Dan. Barry co. Showing one summer evening
in a remote town they waited until considerably
after opening time for some audience, but in vain.
At last in the dusk of twilight figures were seen
coming along the dusty road. The co. rushed
behind and prepared to ring up, but the “ audi-
ence ” scampered hurriedly past the door. It was
a mob of horses.
E. Fitts will exercise his fine voice in “ I Love
but Thee ” till the end of “ Matsa ” season, when
he will close his own mouth professionally and
make other people open theirs. He returns to
tooth-doctoring, and will probably give Collins-
street a treat by letting that moustache grow
again.
Rose Musgrove, second daughter of her father,
has at last succeeded in removing the parental em-
bargo against her playing in public; she will
appear with the fashionable amateurs who are to
occupy the Princess’s soon in “Le’lamine.” About
two years ago Rose made a brilliant success as
The Gutta Percha Girl in the “ Arabian Nights,”
played in Prahran Town Hall for local charities.
A.fter two performances the laudatory notices of
his daughter’s song-and-dance accomplishments
seemed to annoy G.M., for he forbade her to play
any more.
Summer tourists to Tasmania generally return
with the two sassiety conversational plaints of the
islanders —the wild jealousy that exists between
the two cities about Govt. House location, causing
Launceston to agitate for the building of a vice-
regal palace for itself, and the manlessness of all
toney gatherings. The much-rushed visiting
youths are given such an overwhelming dose of
attention by Tasmanian belles that they feel like
Alexander Selkirk, and murmur * * They are so
unaccustomed to man their tameness is shocking
to me.”
A recent M.L. paper publishes an advt. from
the very newest woman, calling upon her husband
to remove his goods and chattels from her house,
threatening, otherwise, to auction them for storage
expenses. Name and address appended. A re-
freshing change from the old-time agony advt.,
imploring the absent one to return home to his
heart-broken Susie.
A servant-gal-worried Sydney matron has solved
the difficulty of hired help by employing “ real
lydies ” in reduced circumstances as domestics.
She declares that being “missis” to one’s equals
is a real pleasure, and finds comfort with a large
house-staff for the first time.
In Westralia, what with Afghans running amok,
Hindoo menials at a big Perth hotel trying to do
for the proprietor, and Chow club-servants revolt-
ing, the white inhabitants have no time to re-
member to be thankful for alien hired help. The
Weld Club, which is Perth sassiety, has been
lately much troubled by a very literal sort of strike,
in which the chief-steward was bumped hard on
the head among the Chinkey under-hirelings, the
chief cause of complaint being “too muchee
work.”
Despite all the writing-down it has had, the
theatre-hat continues to be the same pompous and
aggressive head-piece as ever. It is most likely
puffed up because about the first time it was
noticed was when Heine sat behind the rose-red
gauze hat in the French theatre, and all the horror
of the tragedy appeared to him bathed in the
most cheerful rose-light. Millinery that has got
itself into literature won’t condescend to take any
notice of mere newspaper abuse.
It is the Newcastle ? not the Sydney School of
Arts, which is proposing to turn its lady readers
out of their room and introduce billiards instead ;
but now members have voted to have the click of
the cues heard in the lecture-room. The secretary
of Sydney School of Arts writes me reproachfully
that the 700 women-readers on his members’ list
have their special room brightened weekly by the
Eink cover of The Bulletin. The authorities
aving provided a properly-equipped reading-
room for subscribers threw it open to both sexes.
The real reading or studying woman doesn’t go to
a library to chatter ; but man, the superior crea-
ture, imagines that all she wants to do is to gossip,
and so he runs her into a little room of her own,
and tells her to be a good little girl and amuse
herself with all the pretty picture-papers.
Sydney Lancers will have a procession through
the city on the day of departure, so that every-
body may have a chance to gaze admiringly on
the noble 25, who are all bong-tong. For some
time there has been a determination to keep the
whole corps strictly blue-blooded. Once upon a
time (long, long ago) their ranks included a sordid
person who actually sold collars and braces. They
wouldn’t have minded had he vended them in
large quantities, but he dealt in them one at a
time. He was a nice-looking fellow and a good
horseman and his moustache was not dyed, but
the other Lancers didn’t take to him because he
sold socks. None of them sell socks now.
Discussion is raging in Melb. just now about the
scheme of the women doctors to raise funds and
run a women’s hospital on their own account. The
Nicest, following the lead of Mrs. “Big” Clarke,
are cold-shouldering the new movement and sup-
porting an idea to build an infectious-diseases
hospital, so the lady-medicoes appeal to the women
of Victoria to push a shilling-subscription called
the “Queen’s Shilling,’ in order to replace the
present temporary building where Drs. H. Sexton
and her mates minister to their suffering sisters,
and make up prescriptions in a cupboard
only large enough to hold one small
woman and the drug bottles. About a dozen
lady doctors take turns and are kept hard at it.
These declare that the opposition of men doctors
to the new scheme is caused by pure jealousy, and
bring forward the “ modesty ” plea as their trump
card for their own sex’s support. But men doc-
tors are down on the idea of a hospital officered
altogether by women, allegingthat no Australian-
trained woman doctor has yet had enough experi-
ence to be trusted with life-and-death operations,
and instancing the great percentage of deaths oc-
curring during the female regime at the Carlton
Women’s hospital.
There is an old bed in a dusty room in the
Colonial Secretary’s department in a certain pro-
vince, but the bed is never used. However, the
Premier and his wife were very late in town one
night recently, and ’phoned for the room to be got
ready that they might camp therein. Prepara-
tions were hastily made, and the head of the
Govt, and his wife retired for the night only to
fight hordes of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. A fat
Premier in pyjamas chasing mosquitoes in the
dead of night is not a dignified sight. The
struggle proceeded until dawn, when the attend-
ant could be got at for mosquito-nets, which the
tired Premier had to fix up himself as he balanced
on the wire-mattress edge. But he consoles him-
self for the night of woe by thinking that, at any
rate, there are no skeeters at the Hotel Cecil.
They held a harvest-festival at an up-country
church. When completed the arrangements made
the edifice look like a vegetable John’s cart.
Marrows, pumpkins, smellful onions, even ple-
beian but well-washed “murphys,” were shown
conspicuously. Waving grasses tickled the
preacher’s ear at the reading-desk, and a good
fruity trophy was fixed up in a large box loudly
labelled “Keen’s Mustard.” Another case, on
which stood a mighty melon, was marked “ Some-
body’s Whisky.” “ Praise God from whom all
blessings flow.”
A jumbo-drapery had an interested crowd around
its windows lately, all pressing and pushing to see
an absorbing object in a neat glass box. The
thrilling sight was a pair of silk stockings once
worn by Queen Victoria. Are Australians more
grovelling than Britishers? Such an exhibition
as a pair of royal hose wouldn’t attract any atten-
tion in a London shop—-not even a sneer for the
simplicity of the tradesman who could imagine it
an attraction.
A suburban Bethel, in a dilapidated state of
disrepair, is flanked by a bright, neatly-kept par-
sonage. The parson takes care to be comfortably
settled himself, while the ‘ ‘ House of the Lord ”
is merely an easily-pulled-down temporary struc-
ture. On the same principle are the tumble-down
shanties seen in old-established suburbs with
expensive stabling : the original settler erected a
run-’em-up for himself, while he arranged the
stables to fit in with the grand mansion he
intended to build w'hen he made his pile. Then
he died or went bung or sold the property, and
the mansion never got itself built.
Down-trodden governesses are going to strike
for higher wages, and, as an initiative, form them-
selves into a union. It is a dark horse of a move-
ment as yet, but any step in the direction of
wringing better terms from stingy employers, who
rate “ board and lodging” as an equivalent for
imparting the polish to a family, will have a good
effect. If better terms are granted on one side,
the other ought to concede a higher standard. In
a cheap engagement it isn’t always the poor gover-
ness who falls in.
The “missis” has her side of the story to give.
Very often, in a back-blocks household, the in-
structress from “ town ” who has made an outlay
in showy blouses, and warbles at the piano fluent
ballads all the evening “without a husk,” im-
presses with awe the soul of her non-musical,
shabby employer, but grinds not much grammar
into Tommy and Ethelinda. The incompetent
who hasn’t “got up to vulgar fractions,” and the
triple-armour-plated, University-trained, musi-
cally-degree’d damsel, both call themselves gover-
nesses.
“ The pietists of a staid suburb still bemoan the
deceitfulness of human nature, as revealed by the
conduct of a once-revered brother. The ancient
in question, like St. Paul of old, posed priggishly
as a celibate, contenting himself with the minis-
trations of a like-minded niece. This devout
damsel employed her talents in collecting for
righteous objects, and invariably prefaced her
requests with the convincing words : ‘ Uncle says
Christians ought to distribute ! ’ One morning
fellow-saints read, to their intense surprise, in the
local paper, that someone described as the wife of
the good man aforesaid had died in another pro-
vince. Next day the widower and his alleged
relative were seen coming out of a town church all
blushes and orange-blossoms.
“ A party of Melb. folk, wishing to visit London
during ‘ Long Reign ’ festivities, have been can-
vassing round to find persons belonging to their
own top-lofty set who are willing to join a ‘ second
saloon party ’ on one of the mail-boats. The
accommodation offered at second-class rates more
than satisfies these snobs, but they dread the chance
of contamination by the indiscriminate ‘ second-
classer,’despite the fact that the passenger-list of
a recent outgoing mail proved that many folk of
unquestioned position travelled second class, while
the saloon was dedicated to bookies, pub.-keepers,
and persons of even weirder callings.
“ Judging from pictures by some Melb. photo-
graphers, sassiety girls here have as little hesita-
tion in posing to the camera-man in an advanced
state of undress as the most hardened ballet-
misses. To slip the bodice entirely off the
shoulders and bust, and to envelope the nude parts
of the figure with faint gauze, appears to be the
most popular arrangement for a photographic
toilette. To possess the smallest taint of modesty
is to be confessedly demodi, but one of Melb.’s
most up-to-date maidens felt her cheeks flame
when on showing some proofs of her photographs
to an old family friend the ancient remarked : ‘ Fie,
my dear young lady ; in my young days those
would have been considered smoking-room pic-
tures.’
“ Either as a proof that Lord Brassey intends
to get rid of all his superfluous belongings pre-
paratory to departing from these shores, or as a
merely speculative venture, His Ex. has given out
to the yachting fraternity that he is willing to sell
his beloved Helen, the yacht—of course, should a
suitable price be offered. A recent article in an
English periodical stated that as she now floats
the Helen is the smartest craft of the kind in Aus-
tralian waters.”
“ Word comes from Germany that Percy
Grainger, the musical Victorian lad, facially ful-
fils as exactly as ever one’s mental conception of
that nursery-rhyme saint—* the curly-headed boy
who never told a lie.’ But years, ’tis said, are not
passing over the cherubic urchin’s head without
developing more or less of the usual fickleness of
boyhood. Music is no longer his only love.
Painting claims the lion’s share of his youthfui
affections, and, if he had his own way, much of
the time at present devoted to compulsory piano-
drill would be spent in sketching from Nature.
“ Alberto Zelman (senior), accompanist-in-chief
at the Coy concert, had apparently brushed his
curls for once and threw a characteristic touch of
soul into the music, much of which the sam *
vocalists had sung under his guidance as conductor
c agono. Apropos of those tangled tresses
of his, a pet pupil, a gushful young matron, once
begged him, after an apologetic preamble, to get
his hair cut and so put an end to the irreverent
jeers of non-musical philistines. The old man
chuckled and said if that would make her happy
he d do it m a * jeef. ’ So he seized a scissors and
there and then mangled off his ringlets in one fell
swoop, leaving bald spots here and coarse, hideous
tufts somewhere else. Then he looked at himself
m a scrap of broken glass and laughed and said,
* now he was even no more wenerable ! ’ Since
then he has been let alone and his skull thatch has
gone its own wild way without outside interference.
“ At a recent Toorak wedding a female relative
of the bridegroom wore a magnificent gown of
spun glass. Broken bottles are now converted
into the most beautiful fabric imaginable, which
hangs in wonderful folds and has a lus-
trous sheen on it, eclipsing the glossiest
satin. In building a spun-glass costume the
modiste has to use infinite pains in binding over
the seams and covering rough edges of every sort
as there is a faint danger of minute particles of
glass working their way into the flesh of the
wearer. The material looks richest in the darker
tones—deep red, navy and black particularly, and
is as yet very expensive indeed.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
Queen Victoria’s message to the National
Convention was a rather tardy. Salisbury doesn’t

Of the men new to interprovincial politics
R. E. O’Connor (N.S.W.) has made about the
best impression in Adelaide. His speech on Bar-
ton’s resolutions was far the shrewdest effort on
the Conservative side.
Gov. Gormanston, of Tasmania, failed to
turn up in person at the Mt. Lyell banquet. The
steamer conveying H.E. got half way there,
but, owing to the rough sea, turned back to
Hobart. When the weather moderated another
start was made, but this time the gallant fisher-
man “ wasn’t taking any,” and was represented at
the banquet by Private-Sec. Rawlinson.
Up to the end of the third day of the Con-
vention it seemed evident that there was to be but
a poor show of a fight on the question of representa-
tion in the Senate. In fact, at the end of the
third day Simon Fraser (about the worst speaker
of the 30 for Vic., N.S.W., and S.A.) “assumed
that the principle of equal representation was
generally conceded in that body and need not be
argued.” And “hear-hears” fell thick upon him.
Already the wisdom of Premier Turner’s
suggestion, that the Federal Convention should
take all the preliminary oratory for granted and
go straight to work at drafting a Constitution, has
become apparent. Too much talk is the trouble
up to date. The Convention began with an
abstract motion that it was advisable to do certain
things with a view to promoting a closer union,
&c., &c. Then every soul in the Convention
started to expound all his views on the great sub-
ject at full length. They have been at it now for
a week, and, at time of writing, were still ex-
pounding, and more than half of them have yet to
be heard from. And all this talk leads to nothing.
When the draft Constitution is ready, it
will have to be debated, clause by clause,
and all these things will have to be said
over again as a reason why the clauses
should be altered or should not be altered. The
preliminary discussion is sheer waste of time. The
Westralian delegates now announce that, if the
Convention doesn’t get along faster, they will have
to leave in order to look after their provincial
elections before the real business is anything like
finished, and consequently they will have no voice
in the Constitution-making after all. This may
result in W. A. standing out of the Federation in
disgust. The member who saw that too much
irresponsible fluency was the rock ahead of the
Convention was the level-headed man of the
gathering. When it is remembered that all the
stupendous financial problem is still to come, it
looks as if the debate might go right ahead until
June.
Howard Denver, the wealthy Englishman
who bought Butler’s clothes in ’Frisco, is known
as “Jack the Ripper, jun.” He earned his title
by buying from every source the suits worn by
murderers while committing assassinations. As
the murder-anniversaries come round Denver
dresses himself in the suit of the day and goes out
to “ repeat the murder ” by walking over the
haunted path. Already he owns 90 murderers’
n!u^ S ’) them hideously blood-splashed.
The ’Frisco papers absolutely teem with Butler
matter: 240 columns of Butjeriana appeared in
the local daily press alone within a week. The
most engaging article (which, as the prisoner is to
be tried in Australia it would ba unfair to repro-
duce) is by clever, picturesque Alice Rix, in the
Examiner. Among other things she says that
Butler says he is 37, but looks 50, and a worn 50
at that.

repartee. The other day at a chapel-fair, after
reading the hand of a sceptical local preacher, who,
at the conclusion of the stance, impressively en-
quired “What makes a clever woman like you
carry on with this humbug?” the lady replied
“Oh I don’t know, but, after all, there isn t
much to pick between a palmist and a psalmist
nowadays.”
A N.S.W. barrister, who has just returned
from England, met Judge Windeyer in London
After some conversation His Honor remarked, I
suppose you know what lam doing here . Ihe
lawyer knew very well, but he did not care to
bluntly say so. The Judge, however, made no
bones about the matter. “ You know they intend
to appoint an Australian Judge to the Bnvy
Council, and I am going to stay here and see it
through.” He has seen it through.
Premier Turner, it is
whispered in Melb. legal cir-
cles, suffers from an awful
anxiety re his private prac-
tice, which could scarcely have
been improved by the physi-
cal breakdown of his old
partner, Bam Lyons, notwith-
standing the well-known fact
that each partner always
managed Ms own branch of
the business with a free hand.
Clients don’t drop into a law-
yer’s mouth, like ripe plums,
in these financially degenerate
days, and some of the clients
who do fall to Honest George’s
lot whilst he is there to re-
ceive them in person may be
tempted to drop into another
office when he is away on
that dangerous trip ’Om 3.
After all, Queen Victoria’s
deep concern for the welfare
of her loyal subjects isn’t
worth much to most of them.
If the old lady had any prac-
tical knowledge concerning
Premier Turner’s welfare she
would probably command him
to stop in Melbourne and kiss
her Royal hand by cablegraph.
The Earl of Kilmorey
should have livelyrecollections
of the time when, as Lord
Newry, he visited Victoria on
the Duke of Edinburgh’s staff,
30 years ago. He got into
scrapes innumerable, includ-
ing a fierce battle with the
stalwart relative of somebody
at, Geelong. He was also pre-
sent at the West Melbourne
cock-fight when the choristers
of the Wesleyan Church ad-
joining the house in the back-
yard of which the roosters did
battle, broke down in the
middle of a hymn because
they, from their gallery, could
see and enjoy the cocks battling and the feathers
flying. Police-Commissioner Standish and the
Duke were at that cock-fight too.
Syrnon Q..C. (S.A.) is the bald-head of the
Federal Convention. He is even balder than an
egg. Premier Reid (N.S.W.) is the fat man of an
Assembly singularly free from adiposity on the
whole. The Tasmanian delegates are nearly all
grey-haired. Deakin (Vie.) is the handsomest
man in the Convention : Drunker (N.S.W.) the
]la nest; and Abbott (N.S.W.) and Kingston
(S.A.) the “ finest specimens.”
A CHEAP SEDATIVE.
VISITOR: “My husband would like yer to come an ’ read the Bible to him; he thinks
it would do him good.”
PARSON: “Is he dangerously ill? ”
VISITOR: “ Well, no—the doctor calls it insomnia!”
A couple of thrifty N.S.W. barristers,
tapped gently as to whether they would accept
“ silk ” in honor of Her Majesty’s Record, as
gently whispered nay. The barrister who becomes
a Q.d. handicaps himself in several ways, and, to
still more heavily weight the honor, has to hand
out some 60 or 70 guineas in fees to one and
another etiquette-made claimant.
Mr. Horwood - Butler - Weller-Asche-Ne w-
man has figured—according to his latest apocry-
pha —as ironworker, man-o’-warsman, signalling
expert, infantryman (English), policeman (Eng.),
infantryman (Eng., 2nd time), coal-miner, cavalry-
man (Eng.), ditto (U.S.), military engineer,
railway hand, policeman (British North America),
infantryman (do.), artilleryman (do.), meteorolo-
gist, cavalryman (U.S., 2nd time), silver-miner,
and merchant seaman. But his dates are ludi-
crous misfits.
GETTING INTO CONDITION.
Premier Turner did not take his K.O.M.G
gew-gaws with him to Adelaide, and he was the
only knight at the banquet without half-a-pound
of gold and enamel on his shirt-front and a star on
his coat. Little C.M.G. Todd was resplendent,
Braddon was gorgeous, Fysh looked as if he had
slipped out of the waxworks; but Turner was a
plain figure in black and white.
Everyone admits that Premier Reid made
by far the best speech at the National Federation
banquet. Gov. Buxton was twaddlesome, Turner
commonplace, Braddon dry-as-dust, and Kingston
lost force by sticking too closely to his notes.
Reid said exactly the proper things in a most
attractive way, and he has won a big reputation
in Adelaide on the strength of it.
The deadly monotony of the first day’s
Federal Convention proceedings was relieved by
an extraordinary incident. There was, of a sud-
den, a report like distant thunder. “ A military
display,” said some of the delegates. “ Then there
rapidly followed a noise as of a thousand people
shaking rattles, laughing the while. “ Somebody
drowning a laughing-jackass,” said another dele-
gate, and a messenger was despatched to stop the
row. Then there came a creepy, nerve-shaking
cry akin to the last despairing wail of a lost soul
in Sheol, and every delegate’s hair stood on end.
The disturbance was, however, by this time located.
It was Vic. Chief Sec. Peacock’s laugh.
From Woronora (N.S.W.) Chronicle
NOTICE.
mHE proprietor of this journal begs to intimate to All
T whom it may at any time Concern, that, in future,
persons desiring their names omitted from the “ Court
Chronicles” column (indictable offences excepted) may
obtain the concession on contributing the sum of 2s. to
the Hospital Fund.
This step is taken to protect the proprietor from charges
of favoritism in the suppression of delinquents’ names.
A receipt will be given for all such sums, which will be
handed over to the treasurer of the Bulli Cottage
Hospital.
G. H. Reid’s enthusiastic championship of
Speaker Abbott’s claims to the Presidency of the
national Convention may be explained by the fact
that most of the Premiers go to England presently,
and if one of them could go as President of the
Australasian Federal Convention that one would
stand a step or two higher than the rest. So
Kingston had to be kept out, if possible. But
Kingston having been appointed, the tacticians
decided that their case would be stronger if they
could show that the mere accident of locality had
everything to do with the filling of all the offices.
So Baker was elected to the chair in committees
instead of the senior Speaker, and E. G. Black-
more was made clerk.
The latest intelligence about the “dying
Victorian poet ” Wm. Gay is that he is about to
get married —
Now really, Mr. Gay,
This is good news indeed
To think that you from fear
Of Death will now be freed ;
For when a man doth wed
And dare the nuptial strife,
Death will not be so dread
A fear to him as life.
When a boy, Premier Reid was a bit of a
practical joker, and he still delights in relating
one little incident of his younger days. A grocer,
on whom he, in common with others, had a “ set,”
used to clean his windows with a mop and bucket
of water. George, in passing, dropped a small
iron nut in the pail, and repaired to a safe dis-
tance to watch the effect. When the small-goods-
man had almost finished, he dashed the remaining
water on the window, completely smashing it!
George * 4 gat. ”
Thomas Elder, the just-deceased S.A.
millionaire squatter, spent the last two years of
his life playing with colored counters. His large
bequest to Adelaide hospital, by the way, would
probably have been struck out, owing to the politi-
cal squabbles in that institution, had testator been
mentally capable in his latter days. Dr. Perks,
formerly Resident Officer, and the first to leave
the Hospital, was his medical attendant up to his
death.
An old identity in the person of Mrs. C.
F. Gerler, “the mother of the German station,”
a settlement near Nundah (Q.), died there the
other day. Pastor Gossner, founder of the Lutheran
mission, brought Gerler to Queensland in ’43.
Gerler prospered greatly, and built a capacious
dwelling on the site of the slab hut which first
sheltered him. In ttiis dwelling the couple cele-
brated a few years ago the 50th anniversary of
their marriage.
Premier Kingston publicly offered to bury
all past differences with Symon and Baker, two of
his Convention colleagues, but Baker excluded
Kingston—although the latter had that day been
elected president from the invitations to a
reception to certain of the delegates, and
Symon and Baker both absented themselves
from the banquet given by the Ministry next
day. These facts illustrate the spirit which ani-
mates Kingston’s political enemies, but they also
explain why the masses stick to him. Even S.A.
Register, which has made desperate efforts to
be fair of late, had to break out into a sneer at the
S.A. Premier’s election to the presidentship.
In answer to The Bulletin’s assertion
that the Tories cannot raise a poet, the Argus has
adopted a young man who was discovered by the
local Freetraders, and who has the rhyme bias
strongly developed. This genius is allowed to air
his patriotic “ pomes ” in the Argus, in considera-
tion of the fact that he occasionally refers to Pim-
perialism, Freetrade, and conservatism in an
appreciative way. His last outbreak is “An Aus-
tralian Anthem ” of such virility that it suggests
the wild enthusiasm of a sick hen moralising under
a tub. Sample appended :
Let no bold foemen come, insulting,
Raiding our coast and treading our shore;
Or, swift to meet them, may we uprising
Drive them afar, that they oome no more.
This is decent Fitzgibbonese, and, if the Argus
keeps its new poet going till the general election,
there probably will not be a single Conservative in
next Vic. Parliament.

Charles Bonney, who died in Sydney on
March 16, aged 84, was South Australia’s last
pensioner. He had drawn =6250 a year from the
province since 1856, when the new Constitution
Act was passed and he lost his permanent appoint-
ment as Commissioner of Crown Lands. He came
to Sydney in ’34, and in ’36 went to C. H. Ebden’s
station, where Albury now stands. Thence he
led an exploring party with a flock of sheep to
Port Philip in Jan., ’37- He returned to Albury
by way of Launceston and Sydney, and, taking
10,000 sheep with him, formed a station at Kil-
more. He travelled twice to Adelaide with cattle
before 1839, and continued his journeys overland
with stock until 1841, when Sir George Grey, then
Governor of S.A., made him Commissioner of
Crown Lands, a post which he retained until Re-
sponsible Government came in ’67. He was also
a member of the first (Finniss) Ministry formed
in S.A. Mr. Bonney returned to Sydney nearly
30 years ago, and during the closing period of his
life he was quite blind. His son is still a S.A.
civil servant.

himself, and providing against prevalent ailments
in mining camps. He finds that the liver gives
out quicker than any other vital organ : he keeps
the liver active, healthy and well by the timely
use of W aruer’s ‘ * Safe ” Cure, which is the
acknowledged specific for torpidity of the liver,
constipation, jaundice, drowsiness and lassitude—
prominent symptoms which characterise any ir-

A well-known Coolgardie miner and prospector,

which shows the value of forethought, and his
experience is corroborated by hundreds of miners

POLITICAL
POINTS
Parkes, Robertson and Dibbs were rejected
by their constituents on the first general election
subsequent to their acceptance of titles. A memo,
for G. H. Reid, Seddon and Kingston.
W. J. Lyne, a Tasmanian by birth, was
the first to state openly in the Convention that he
was determinedly opposed to allowing Tasmania
equal representation in the Federal Senate.
All the S.A. delegates but Baker and
Downer were anxious that Kingston should pre-
side at the Convention, but the two knights
wanted Barton. The election caused much heart-
burning.
THE NEW WOMAN.—AT HANNAN'S, W.A.
A District Court action which arose out of
a claim for remuneration for composing speeches
for candidates at the recent Convention elections
was settled out of Court the other day, in Sydney,
for half the amount demanded.
“We give a vote in Tasmania to the man
who deserves it,” said Premier Braddon at the
Convention. All The Bulletin can say is that
there must be a dreadful lot of impersonation
carried on at Tasmanian elections.
The set-back received by the Australian
Labor-parties at the Federal elections is likely to
prove beneficial. The workers may now see the
necessity of swapping the man with the mouth
for the man with the mouth and brains.
Premier Nelson’s variations on his rela-
tion to Australian Federation, and his coming into
or staying out of the Convention, resemble closely
Swanhilda Butler’s vacillating explanations as to
how he came by Lee Weller’s property.
So far as it has gone the Federal Conven-
tion of ’97 appears to be head and shoulders above
the one of six years ago in brains, knowledge and
earnestness of purpose. A vast number of
mediocrities have dropped out —Dibbs, Suttor,
Jennings, Rutledge, Macdonald-Paterson, Bray,
Thynne, Gillies, Munro, Wrixon, Shiels, Collard-
Smith, and Nicholas Fitzgerald are a few good
samples. The Victorian contingent has improved
most, and it had also the most room for improve-
ment ; the Vic. delegation of ’9l didn’t contain a
man, bar Alfred Deakin, who knew when to come
in successfully out of the wet. The N.S.W. and
S.A. delegates are at least as bright a lot
as those which represented these two provinces in
'9l, and on that occasion they were about the
best of the whole collection.
Carruthers, at the Convention :
Everything pointed to Sydney as the proper place for
the Federal capital. The Primacy of Australasia was
there, and so was the head of the Roman Catholic Church.
Peacock : Yes, but Melbourne has the head of the Sal-
vation Army.
At Bathurst. Two old Irish women meet
after Cardinal Moran’s Convention-election defeat.
“So the Cardinal did not get in, after all! ”
“ No ! And glad I am—he might lose the other
billet.” Prudent old girl! If Tom Slattery only
had as much horse-sense !
Stout’s dreadful earnestness in advising
Seddon to go to England is one of the reasons
why Digger Dick has been so very undecided about
going. Stout also wants Parliament to go on
sitting in Seddon’s absence, and the natural infer-
ence is that the Cold-Tea Knight thinks he sees
his way to making Jock Mackenzie do something
supremely foolish in his chief’s absence.
Premier Braddon (Tas.) thinks that care
should be taken to prevent the Federal Govern-
ment having too much revenue, because “ a
deficit is useful in various ways.” A deficit
involves either temporary or permanent borrow-
ing, or else default. Which of them is “ useful in
various ways ? ” Also, in which ways ? There are
likewise various ways in which it is useful to have
your pants too short at the feet, if Braddon only
knew it.
At the wind-up of the Wesleyan Confer-
ence in Melbourne a resolution was carried to the
effect that the Conference wishes “ to secure the
embodiment in the new Australian Federal Con-
stitution of a formal acknowledgment of God as
Ruler of Nations.” And these are reverent men !
Reverence as generally existing amongst parsons
is a something that depends upon the total absence
of a sense of humor and the existence of a bloated
conceit, a form of moral elephantiasis.
Premier Reid has, it is alleged, received
the personal assurances of a majority of Assembly
members that they will allow N.S.W. Parliament
to adjourn till he returns from England. The
plan of campaign will, therefore, disclose itself
thus : Reid will boldly declare his intention to go,
and will wind up with a motion for the necessary
adjournment. A member will promptly apply the
closure, and the House will divide. A man sure
beforehand of his majority can afford to be daring.
A curious subterranean movement, of
which Premier Reid is supposed to be the origina-
tor, has been going on in the Federal Conven-
tion, the idea being to force a sudden adjournment
for an indefinite period on the ground that the
present time is “inopportune.” Almost all the
rumors of delay seem to somehow centre round
Premier Reid. He is accused, on apparently good
evidence, of having suggested a postponement
even before the election. He mentioned a possible
adjournment the other day in Melbourne, and
again in Adelaide. He was connected somehow
with the latest scheme for waiting till Queensland
might come in about next July or August. He is
also the only Premier who proposes to hang up
the Federal movement till his return from Eng-
land. Altogether there seems to be a mist of
suspicion round the rotund man from N.S.W.
England has a carriage-tax, a
footman-tax, and an armorial-bear-
ings tax. Who says no more direct
taxes are needed in Australia ?
The Melb. metropolitan commit-
tee of the Australian Natives’ Asso-
ciation is probably the nearest Aus-
tralian approach to Tarn man}' Hall }
both in the nationality and religion
of its inner ring and in—other things.
Melbourne Age, suddenly dis-
covering that N.S. Wales has borrowed
.£1,230,000 for defence purposes, while
Victoria has borrowed only .£98,000,
urges the Government to borrow some
money forthwith and buy rifles and
cannon and things with it. In this
great loan land the pained feeling that
comes over a province when it finds
that it has omitted to borrow as
much as its neighbor is truly pathetic.
Rho : “ ‘Kish the buke’ is abso-
lutely unknown in France, Belgium,
Austria, Spain and Italy. Even in
mossgrown Britain any man may
demand the Scotch form of affirma-
tion, without stating his reasons for
objecting to ‘ kish the buke,’ under
the sth section of Bradlaugh’s Act.
V ictorian law only allows the refusal on
the ground of alleged conscientious
reasons, and the section so reads as to
imply that only adverse theology can
be a conscientious reason. Surely a
man may have conscientious reasons
against accepting a dose of syphilis
from, say, a previously-sworn prosti-
tute, or a dose of cancer or leprosy from
any other predecessor. A case recently-
occurred at South Melbourne where a
doctor J.P. ordered a fresh Bible to be
got, having noticed that a witness
just sworn had a cancer of the lip.
London Times has just started an agi-
tation for the utter abolition of the
worthless and dangerous book oath and
substitution of a plain affirmation
covered by a perjury punishment.”
Rho : “ Tribune Trenwith is a ‘ cert.’ for
the extra Vie. portfolio which will be rendered
necessary by Turner and Duffy’s exodus. Isaacs
will be the next Premier, and Peacock will remain
Chief Sec. and Minister of Education.”
The United States did not settle the slave-
question before federation, and the consequence
was a civil war. Let us hope that Queensland
will definitely stay away from the Convention, so
that Australian Federation will start with the
slave-State outside.
“ An inquiry into
the management of
N.S.W. Marine Board
will shortly be under-
taken by the Public Ser-
vice Board.” Ha, ha 1
Already can you hear
the dry bones rattle in
ship-chandlery circles.
A SHORT STAY IN TOWN.
MRS. CHOLMONDELEY-TAYLOR : “ Oh, I am so disappointed, Mrs. Be Jones. Only an afternoon
call, when I expected you to stay with us a fortnight !”
MRS. DE JONES : “ I'm so sorry. I would if I could —but I have an exertion ticket, and it
perspires to-morrer.”
The Australian Premiers are to have
honorary membership of the Carlton Club during
their stay in London. The Carlton is blue Tory
from the door-mat to the last purple-jowled,
gouty Earl. Will those Premiers who accept the
hospitality ever succeed in getting away from the
Carlton Club ?
S.M. Herald remarks that when Gov.
Buxton proposed the toast of “ Australia,” at the
time when the Federal delegates took a snack with
the S.A. Ministry at Adelaide, the sentiment was
greeted with a ‘ ‘ deafening British cheer. ” Ap-
parently, in this poor, miserable country, even the
cheers are borrowed from England.
USEFUL, IF .
BOSS COCKIE : “Now, I
wonder if I cud git
that there feller to
spend his holidays up
at my place? ”
When the Federal Enabling Bill wasgoiim
through S.A. Assembly in ’95, John
then Opposition leader, said, in tones of deepest
melancholy: “It is not much use iny taking an
interest in shaping this measure. If the country
votes in one constituency it won’t elect me
because I have not played to the gallery suffi-
ciently. I won’t even have the temerity to stand. ”
“Oh, yes, you will,” retorted Kingston; “cheer
up ; they’ll put you in all right.” And they did,
although, when the time came, Kingston would
rather that Downer’s prophecy had been fulfilled.
A point of great importance struck the
Federal Convention last week in the question
whether the whole business should be hung up to
meet Queensland’s latest whim. Sydney Tele-
graph responded next day with a particularly apt
and able leading article--S.M. Herald, as usual,
waited to see how the cat would jump.
Seddon is about the only Australasian
Premier who can go to do the Record Reign grovel
with a light heart and reasonable safety. He isn’t
in the Federal movement, and his financial year
closes 31st March, so he can get his financial state-
ment through in April, announce his surplus, then
shut up the premises and depart in a blaze of
glory.
The O’Sullivan, M.L.A. : “In 1830 the
population of Australia was under 300,000 ; nowit
was 4,500,000. At this rate of progress, within 50
years we would see 30,000,000 people inhabiting
these lands.” Quite so. In 1830, or thereabouts,
G. R. Dibbs was one foot high. In 1870 he was
six feet high. At this rate of progress in 1910 he
will be 36 feet high.
Westralia Forrest’s jubilation over achiev-
ing a record in an uninterrupted Premiership
directs attention to the extreme variableness of a
first Premier’s tenure of office in Australia. Forrest
has exceeded six years by a couple of months, just
beating Queensland Herbert, who ruled from 10th
Dec., ’59, to Ist Feb., ’66. But Donaldson, the
first N.S.W. Premier, was on deck only a couple
of months, and Charley Cowper, who succeeded
him, scarcely five weeks. The first Premier
(Haines) in Victoria held on for 14 months, but
O Shanassy, who followed, fell in six weeks.
Premier Finniss (S.A.) lasted ten months, and
Baker, who succeeded, held the fort for nine days.
Tasmania’s first Premier, the stately Champ, held
good for three months, and Gregson, his successor,
for two. So that a record in first Premierships
would seem to be allotted to the individual as
red hair or a hooked nose is.

Rumored that the next big N.S.W. Govern-

tain extensive land alienation on the Clarence.
What have the Melb. University students
done, for good or evil, that they should get their
“ Anthem ” verses quoted by the local press ?
When Halford left the meds.,
They felt keen grief at partin’:
Their “ cheek ” was drenched and their heart wag
wrenched,
And now they say “ It’s Martin."
The poet, in this case, had a drenched cheek like-
wise.

It is reported that Melbourne Age pro-
poses to run a candidate fbr every Vic. constituency
at next general election, and thus decide the ques-
tion whether David Syme really owns Victoria or
not. if David the Dictator would run a Liberal
candidate for every seat in the Council, and use
his immense power to shift the fossils bodily, he
would do a lot more good. Almost every Vic.
reformer devotes himself to Liberalising the As-
sembly, which is as easy as falling downstairs,
seeing that the Assembly is reasonably democratic
already ; and denounces the Council afar off, while
leaving the difficult job of reforming it to some-
one else. In other words, they all go out and slay
the Toryism that is already dead, while leaving
the live article severely alone.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The final night of N.S.W. Wheelmen’s Carnival
saw far and away the best racing of the meeting, but in
cash the League panned out badly on the night’s biz,
profit being 6s. 4d. A good crowd would have come but
for the rawness of the night; there is not much fun
watching Megson and Payne out-manoeuvre Green and
Edwards when one is wishing for a warm bed and a hot
brick. The triplet race was a magnificent one between
most jealously rival crews ; Marshall’s triplet beat Green-
wood’s by half-a-wheel. Australia v. England, one mile
unpaced, was a truly stirring contest. Never before did
Payne and Megson ride with such pace and judgment.
They out-generalled the Englishmen in tactics and left
them hopelessly in the sprint home. In the paced five
miles Payne -asily beat Edwards, and Megson beat Green
by perhaps uie best effort yet seen upon a Sydney cycling
track. To leave his own exhausted pacers in the last lap,
to catch Green and his fast triplet, to hang on to Green’s
wheel, and then to come round on the outside and beat
the Englishman home is a feat of which the most
enthusiastic of Megson’s admirers never thought him
capable. Megson’s form just now is perfect.
• $ $
Vic. League’s March meeting opened with fine
facing but mediocre gate : £250 was taken in the after-
noon, and less in the evening. Fact is the general public,
having but a superficial knowledge, don’t care a rap for
“scientific ” cycling; they want to see the game anyhow.
They can see it on the unbanked Melb. cricket-ground
grass track, and they can’t see it on the St. Kilda and
Exhibition paths, where, owing to the greed of the man-
agers in bringing the fence right up to the track’s edge,
only the front row can view the whole race.
The “ points ” of the meeting were the splendid
sprints of the dauntless Megson, the failures of Bilmartin,
the fine handicap riding of the rapidly-improving youth,
O. O. Tebbutt, and the sickening smash that took place
in one of the heats of the Federal Handicaps.
Megson takes long to strike form. During the
early part of his English trip his riding was ridiculed, yet
in his last half dozen races his finishes were hailed as
“ revelations in sprinting.” In the Mile Championship of
Australasia he did not meet Martin, who was beaten in
the preliminary heat by both Middleton and Relph, but
he won his heat with great ease, and when half way in
the last lap of the final, he swung round and flew past
everybody and flashed in with a three-length lead.
In his heat of the Mile, Martin did what he
has never done before. Pushing out at the half lap,
Relph collared him as they turned into the straight.
This is just the spot where Bill makes his final kick and
wins all his races, but on Saturday, though he kicked his
hardest, the Englishman’s lower gear got away steadily,
and, as Middleton came past both with a great rush, the
Plugger gave in.
Martin was evidently so disgusted with his
form that he failed to come out for the Federal Handicap,
where he had to give Megson 30yds; but after tea he
showed up among tne 26 starters in the Five-mile Vic.
championship, in which, strange to say, there was but
one fall and no hurts. Martin, fearing Megson’s final
sprint, tried to run the latter off his legs, but the Sydneyite
kept them all company, and when “Bill” made his final
rush, he swept past the Yankee on the curve with Walne
right on his back wheel. Martin faded away as in the
Mile, allowing Parsons to get third place.
Megson has never ridden better ; his finishes
are of the sort with which he astounded Melb in the ’93
Austral. For the last 18 months the country has been
raked to find someone able to down the man with the
iron jaw. It looks for the moment as if the man had been
found in Megson. Just now, however, Martin is obviously
not at his best.
Tebbutt (90yds.) won both his heat and the final
of the Federal Handicap in fine style. During the past
week this cyclist, practically unknown ere he won the
£5OO of the A.N.A. race, carried off two races at Benalla
as well —£6 Jin all. He should be a scratch man by the
time he is 21.
Of the outer division of first-class men, O.
Prowse, Hickox, and Berry look the most likely to de-
velop into champions.
The “ ordinary ” race, won by Kellow, would
have been a throw-in for any of those individuals who
still ride the antiquated high machines about the streets ;
the riders who used to shine in by-gone days seemed
utterly lost on returning to an altitude of sft.
Rolfe is probably the world’s oldest racing
cyclist. Though 46 he is still in condition, and on March
17 won the Bendigo Hibernian Handicap of £3o—his son
won the Half-Mile dash at the same sports.
The Jewell family of Maryborough (Vic.) goes
even one better by clearing the whole board at the local
March sports. Of the five events three were won by A.
Jewell and two by his brother Don. The last-named
cyclist lately cleared “ the card ” at Ballarat—heats and
finals—a total of 10 races.
One of the most sensational-looking smashes
ever seen on a cycling-track took place in the fourth heat
of the Federal Handicap 30yds. from the winning-post.
When all the leaders were straining every nerve, Carter,
of S.A., skidded and fell, bringing down Middleton, Gar-
gurevich, and several others. The two named were
stunned and badly bruised, but no one was seriously hurt.
The cycling accidents that appear most fearful only end
in bruises or cuts. It is when a man steps slowly and
gracefully from his machine as it is going dead slow and
then drops to the ground that he receives fatal internal
injuries.
* * * *
The L.V.W. knows how to make its goose part
with the golden eggs. Its present meeting extends over
two Saturdays with afternoon and evening performances,
so that the enthusiast who wants to see the races through
is called upon to pay four times. This “to be continued
in our next” business disgusts the public, the programmes
being so artfully arranged that there is no satisfaction
worth mentioning in any one of the four acts.

Clem. Fisher, ex-eycling-champion of Maori-
land, who has of late years ridden chiefly in Melbourne,
has “ given the game best.” His smash up on A.N.A.
day satisfied him that it would be wise to step out whilst
enough of him remained to swear by. As it is, he has
plugged the cracks on scores of asphalt racing-tracks with
scraps of his anatomy, and watered all the grass paths
with his gore. He claims to be the unluckiest rider on
earth, and is tired of travelling from one metropolitan
track to another merely to afford the spectators the thrill
of seeing his mangled remains hawked off in a truck.

At the big annual amateur M.L. cycle-meeting,
held in Wellington on the new track (3 laps 201 yds. to
the mile), the five-mile championship was a gruesome
spectacle. Sixteen started, and fifteen fell, some more
than once. Four toppled at pistol-fall, ten came down
later, when there w-as gore galore and smashed noses
and arms. The accident was repeated later, when five
fell, and the race was declared void. Reynolds (Auck-
land) won eventually. The track is good, but looking
round and wobbly wheeling will yet end in a graveyard
plot.
* * * *
“ Carbine ” Hunt and amateur Reynolds are far
and away the best cyclists in their classes in M.L. In-
ducements have been vainly held out to Reynolds (a
cycle-maker) to throw over lily-white amateurism and
meet Hunt for £2OO. “Make it £5OO and I’m on,” says
Reynolds.

Boidi returns to Italy in April. He has never
been able to go the pace in Australia, and blames the
food-supply in choice Italian. He says all the cooks sent
by the devil emigrated to Australia. Some Australians
agree with him, having married the cooks.

X.Z. : “On the look-out for a sound roadster
bike, I have spent a fortnight chasing round for a good
second-hander to suit. I have struck already about 5000
machines which are the original machine that Lord
Brassey rode when he first came out. With straw in my
hair, I seek the explanation. Is the Gov. a cycle-agent in
disguise who brought with him 5000 cycles? One curious
point is that the more inferior the article the more
Brassey-ness was used as an inducement.”

In a Sydney bicycle shop cyclist Porta unwit-
tingly seized hold of an almost red-hot handle-bar. His
subsequent description of an encounter with a man whom
he mistook for a chemist is graphic : “ He say not sell
medseen ; he denteest. My hand burn like red-hot. I say
‘ Go-o to-o hell! —go-o to-o hell! I seej r ou on de ground;
I keeck you; I jomp on you ; I see you dead. Go-o to-o

What’s the matter with a tax on cycles ?
Another cycle victim has been trying to cut his
throat at Maryborough, Vic. Long-distance racing means
insomnia and madness to most people. A competitor in
a Warrnambool-to-Melbourne race told his trainer casually
on dismounting : “ A skeleton paced me all the way from
Werribee.” Bike d.t.’s are very much more dangerous
than the old variety,

Curious that it should have been left to N.S.W.
Justice Cohen—one of the Chosen—to decide that cash-
betting on the racecourse is illegal. But there is Scrip-

What a boom the kinetoscopic and cinemato-
graphic pictures of the Fitzsimmons-Corbett fight, which
was lightning-photographed all through, will have when
they come along ! Presumably some Australian showman
has arranged for the series.
* * * *
Corbett said : “I will take no chances with
Fitzsimmons, and I think I can whip him in 15 rounds.”
By the style in which he went for Fitz. right from the
start, he seems to have kept his word in the former
respect, and he very nearly brought off the 15th round—
for the wrong man ! After his Sullivan fight, Corbett
told an interviewer that he had all but perfected the art
of easing-away from a hard-un—a notion over which more
pugilists than himself have fallen in badly.
* * * *
During a conversation on the Fitzsimmons-Cor-
bett fight, in a Melb. bar the other night, the barman
chipped in with a reminiscence of John L. Sullivan’s visit
to Melbourne. One night Johnl was taking nobblers at
the bar “ like pills,” when Mrs. Johnl entered arid tried to
get him home. Failing, she lost her temper, and swooped
down on the slugger’s ears with sounding smacks, and
flounced out, leaving John grinning sheepishly. Which is
the most complimentary thing The Bulletin has ever
heard of John L. Sullivan.

“P. Chenery, a Goulburn Valley 12st. boy,
represents Australia in the Interhospital Boxing Compe-
titions. A pupil of Dan Creedon’s, with a heavy right, a
clever left, and an ironbark punching-piece, the medical
honor of ‘ down below ’ will be gallantly fought for by
this doctor in embryo,” writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent. “ King’s College Hospital has his assist-
ance in the Rugby scrum, and relies on the straight kick-
ing of another Australian, R. H. Strong, late of the
Carlton F.C. and son of Melbourne’s Mayor, a smart,
clean-limbed athlete, when a shot for goal is secured. St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital mopped the sward with King’s in
the Rugby Cup tie, and were led to victory by an Aus-
tralian captain—Carruthers. We may be cronk at bank-
ing and financing generally, but we are sound as red-gum
blocks at W”

“ The hope of the billiardistic world is that
Peall will beat Roberts in the present big game,” writes
our London correspondent. “ Most billiard-bailers are
aweary of the spot-barred ‘ push ’-played champion who
will have his own rules and stipulations, or no one’s. He
bars the spot-stroke—a clever one plainly visible to the
audience —and makes two or three hundred foul nursery
cannons in an evening with his perfection ‘ push ’ that
not more than two or three can see or be at all sure of
either way. The ‘ spot ’ is not half as tiresome to watch
as such nursery cannons. You might just as well bar
Lyons hitting ‘ fourers ’ at cricket and limit him to pokey
singles. The game of billiards is all that is fair, and no
player counts the ‘ push ’ fair.
“ In this match,” proceeds the writer, “Roberts
performed a record ‘ push.’ His ball was eight inches off
and facing the right-hand baulk-pocket. The red six
inches away from and covering the left centre hole.
(Measurements roughly gauged by eye). The Push Pro.
followed his ball in one sweeping push until the butt
reached his hand-rest and the ‘ white’hit the ‘red.’ It
went three-quarters through the vermilion and fell in the
left centre pocket. A phenomenal ‘ push.’ ”

Despite inspired pars, in the dailies, the various
provincial rowing associations are not a happy family re
the amateur rowing definition. In May, ’96, a conference,
in which N.S. Wales, Vic., and Q’sland were represented,
agreed that any rower who had competed in any branch
of cash sport should be debarred from rowing in an inter-
provincial eight-oar race. Q’sland has informed N.S.VV.
that Vic. has decided that any athlete who has not com-
peted for cash since the beginning of this year shall be
eligible. An answer as to what definition the race is to be
rowed under is now urgently pressed for by N.S.W., and
unless the amateur definition as decided upon in the ’96
conference is adhered to, N.S.W. will send no crew.

George Towns, of the Hunter River, sensibly
declines to meet Stanbury before going to try his luck in
England. Towns proposes to work his passage as fire-
man, so should be in good orderto meetsome of the second
or third-raters, just to see what he is made of. His beat-
ing of Neilson was not a performance good enough to
place him alongside first-flight men, and he shows sound
sense in proposing to tackle some of the dimmer lights, and
row himself into form for a go with Gaudaur, should he
win up to that point. Taking a line from Neilson’s show-
ing with him, Towns’ chance with Stanbury would be
simply nil. No rowing men in Australia look upon
Gaudaur’s victory over Stanbury as any criterion of the
latter’s form, for judges of the game think Stanbury as
good a man in a wager-boat as even Searle.

Swimmer Percy Cavill has proved himself best
man in Australia from 440yds. to a mile. He was born in
England, but came to Australia when three or four years
old. His father, born and matured in England, measured in
condition 49in. round the chest, stood sft. 9in. and weighed
14st. 111 b. Ernest Cavill, the eldest son, comingto Australia
when 11, goes in condition 44 round the chest, stands 6ft.,
weighs 13st. Chas. Cavill, the second son, gives chest
measurement 41, height 6ft., weight 12st. 71b. Percy
Cavill, the fourth son, measures 38 chest, stands sft. llin.,
weighs list. 21b. As all the Cavills were taught to swim
as soon as they could walk, and have had daily prac-
tice at this best of exercises, and have lived in the
open air always, it follows that their development has
been well ensured. But why this falling away ? Clearly
the boys who were youngest when they came to Australia
are the weedyish ones. The eldest brother has 7in. chest-
expansion ; Percy has but three. The father, as a young
man, was a favorite model with sculptors and artists ; in
fact, one statue of the Prince of Wales has the Prince’s
head and Cavill’s body. No artist, however, would take
Percy Cavill for a model—he is too emphatically Corn-
stalkish. The falling away of the Australian sons troubles
their mother not a little.' She says : “ All my boys were
born little models of their father, and continued such until
they got into their teens. Then gradually they grew lanky
and their chests flattened; they are Australians, not
Englishmen.” Percy Cavill is an exhibition swimmer; he
travels in a dead straight line ; the water hisses and
bubbles between the strokes of his sinewy limber legs,
and his hands and arms cut their way as do fishes’ fins.
His grit is undeniable: all his would-be rivals concede
him that. When he gets a fighter like he got in Regan
last Saturday, he swims him into cold exhaustion, and
clips 34 3-ssec. off the world’s half-mile amateur record.
The swimming enthusiasts are talking of sending him to
England. But could the Australian ever swim the
Channel as his English father did before him ?

Last week Mr. H. C. White shipped for ’Ome
the horses Form (Cranbrook —La Mode) and Georgie
(Clan Stuart—Mirzapore). The latter should do well if
she goes on all right, for as a two-year-old she was very
“slippy,” easily beating Wallace and Hova at w.f.a. in
A. J.C. All-Aged Stakes. When her racing career is ended
she is to be mated with the famous sire St. Serf (St.
Simon Feronia by Thormanby). The Martini-Henry
mare Acmena, now at ’Ome, is to be put to the same sire.

Unless something unlooked-for happens between
this and the end of the season, Glebe must again take first
place for the Hordern Shield, and Sydney University come
a bad last. It is a question whether University is now
“ form” enough to take a place with the first-class clubs.
They not alone keep other teams from using the first-class
grounds, but it is pretty much the same as drawing a bye
for the club having the luck to be drawn against them.
Outsiders cannot understand how the members comply
with the residential clause, and, taking one consideration
with another, University should next season be missing
from the teams battling for the pennant.

Dear Bulletin, —It was the rule with certain
of aboriginal sprinter Charley Samuels’ “ backers ” to put
a tolerable suit of clothes on his back after he had achieved
a win, and then set him adrift among jugs and bottles.
After a fortnight or so, he would be told that his money
was all vanished. By the way, his return is made just at
the time when those in the know say that it only needs
an enterprising man with a few hundreds to set the ped.
business on its feet.—T.D.

At the recent great carnival of the N.S.W.
Wheelmen’s League all the placed men in the great paced
race used Dunlop tires. J. Fitzgerald won the big handi-
cap—the Sydney Wheel Race—on Dunlop tires, and Joe
Megson, riding Dunlops and Westwood rims, surprised
everybody by his easy defeat of Bilmartin in the 10-mile
paced race.*

Condensed horror as reported from Mel-
bourne :
A young bank-clerk named Trader cut his throat on
Friday night at Maryborough. He is in a very critical
condition. It is supposed that he became insane through
the excessive strain of bicycling in a road-race from
Warrnambool to Melbourne. He was unable to speak,
but wrote on a piece of paper that it.was sad that he was
an atheist.. He endeavored to escape from Dr. Miller,
who was stitching up his wound, and wrote that he had
already done for one doctor. He is not expected to re-
cover.
What a subject for the ordinary “ ranting ” par-
son to maunder about in his Sunday evening dis-
course—the insane bank-clerk with his throat cut
writing on a scrap of paper that he was sorry he
was an atheist.

a dog. The dog carefully avoided the coach as
we approached, taking the poor old fellow out of
danger. I wonder how he gets water ? ”

for the Rev. Z. P. Wilds, a well-

and brother of the late eminent
Judge Wilds:
“I was for many years a sufferer
from boils and other eruptions of a
like nature, caused by the impover-
ished state of my blood. My appe-
tite was poor and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observa-
tion of the good it had done to others,
I began taking it. My
Appetite Improved
almost from the first dose; then my
general health improved, and now it
is excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent, stronger, and I attribute this
result to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as
the best blood medicine ever
devised.”

Pearson’s Weekly, of 9th Jan., 1897,
contains the sensational announcement that
“ while everybody is talking of the gold-mines of
the Australian continent, and while company after
company is being formed for the purpose of ex-
ploiting them and digging from the bowels of the
earth the metal which dazzles the eye of man and
so frequently turns his brain, a humbler but far
more brilliant source of wealth has recently been
discovered —coal! Where coal is,” continues
Pearson, “ wealth must inevitably follow. . . .
present indications proclaim the fact that there is
a continent of fuel.” Talk about going abroad to
hear home news. Coal was discovered in Aus-
tralia in 1797 in different places north and south
of Sydney. The gross ignorance of Pearson,
which claims a huge circulation in England, is
hardly made more manifest by the fact that the
output, which was 40,732 tons for the year so long
ago as 1847, expanded in 1891 to 4,037,929 tons.

S.S. : “The committee of Melb. national
gallery is organising a loyal, royal peep-show in
honor of Her Majesty’s sexagesimal jubilee, and
requests all persons having paintings, etchings, or
prints, the subjects of which bear directly upon
Queen Victoria’s great and glorious reign and are
of special interest, to be kind enough to lend them
to the trustees for the exhibition. It seems to me
that it is the duty of The Bulletin to encourage
this worthy object by sending along half-a-dozen
or so of Phil May’s loyal cartoons, particularly
those epitomising Her Majesty’s devotion to
Thrift —the one virtue that is its own reward.”
A sidelight on the work of a more-or-less-
backblocks bishop :
Editor Bulletin, — I have had iritis, and have not been
able to read or write, but I am told you have been chaff-
inn me for driving about my work with four ponies. I
had that picture taken by a photographer whom I met by
chance in a desolate lignum swamp, near the border of
Q. and N.S.W., and hoped to evoke sympathy thereby,
but it seems I have failed. No one drives four horses
in Q. for show. The roads are too bad. It is grim
necessity. One must either drive the four or run a pair
loose, with a man to drive them/ That means six horses,
and carrying feed and at times rugs for six horses is
serious. If you have ever been blacksoiled, you will
know what the four horses are for. A gentleman kindly
came down here to drive the Bishop of Brisbane and me
from Miles to Tarwon, some 90 miles. He had, I think,
14 horses, three four-horse teams, and two men driving
the loose horses. The last three miles took four hours,
and six horses, and I have always felt distressed at the
thought of the self-restraint which the presence of two
Bishops forced upon the several kind people who came
out to assist us. No. Driving in Q. is hard graft, not
show. I managed to do 2000 miles on that trip with
eight horses, and kept my appointments right through,
with one regrettable exception, though to do it I once
had to pay L 2 ss. for a bag of maize, holding less than
four bushels. And I did not take up any collection,
though I must next time, as I find I do not get any credit
for my forbearance. That same trip, I had been driving
a good many hours along a very-little-used track, where
one had to swing off into the scrub to avoid fallen trees,
and chance getting back without tangling up one’s horses,
when I saw a man riding along the road. I drew my
horses up on an ant-hill, where the inhabitants were all
in full work, so there was much kicking till I got into a
more peaceful place. I then asked him “How far is it to
station?” He: “About five miles. Are you
going to play to-night?” I (puzzled): “No. To pray,
perhaps, if I get the chance of a service.” He : “ What ?
Aren’t you Ashton’s circus?” I: “No. I am only a
bush-bishop.” This is the result of driving cream ponies.
I regret to say he did not turn hack with me, as perhaps
he would have done had I been “ going to play.” Don’t
you think that, after this, we deserve sympathy, and that
a grateful country which sends Premiers and riflemen to
England might send a colonial product in the way of a
bush-bishop to represent it at the Diamond Jubilee ? If
the country really desired it, and would pay, I would re-
luctantly consent to go. This is, I think, the right way of
putting it.—l am, &c., John F. Stretch, Bishop-Coadjutor
of Brisbane.

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfalme Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become s 6
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible I
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your Gfaline Piils completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight,.writes thus: To Heir Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir,—l think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHaM.

Dear Sir,—lt gives me great pleasure to inform youthat
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. r UTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).

Mr. Buit n writes later:— “The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next, day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”

I am jubilant to inform you that your wonderful Alfa-
line Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate com-
plaint ; and that, although I am now over 70 years of age,
I feel as strong as any young man, and shall always be

) am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline Blood
Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can
testify to. I have recommended your Alfaline Herbal
Remedies to several of my friends, who have reason to be
very grateful for it.—Yours gratefully, J NERVIN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of jour
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long he spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity;'—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,— l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.

A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. 1
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J. KILLERIDGE,
Lucknow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles. ,
It affbrds me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
,the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,

OF HIS FAR-FAMED

♦
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press: —
Sydney Bulletin. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”

shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-

fore the public for over ten years.”
N.SK. Mall, Wellington.—“ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
The Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Bassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Australisclic Ze'itnc g, Brisbane.- “We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-

Australian Star. Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become

A Lady’s Troubles.
FOUND HOUSEHOLD DUTIES
FATIGUING.
WANTED TO REMAIN IN BED ALL DAY.
HAD NO AMBITION TO DO ANYTHING
AND FELT TERRIBLY LANGUID.
From the Australian Courier.
“Up to the Spring of 1890,”says Mrs. Margaret
Layfieid, of 09 Surrey-street, Darlinghurst, Sydney
(in answer to a reporter’s inquiry concerning her-
self), “I was comparatively healthy, and could
carry out my household duties without feeling in
the slightest degree fatigued, and would enjoy a
sound and restful night’s sleep. Then I began to
suffer from weakness, and a feeling of depression.
I had a fullness and a pain at the chest and
round the sides ; I was also troubled with palpita-
tion of the heart and a sense of overbearing ex-
haustion, lost a great deal of sleep ; in fact, I kept
tossing about the bed all night. In the morning I
awoke unrefreshed, and looked at the day before
me as one of positive torture. Frequently I had
to remain in bed all day, and call in the assistance
of a neighbor, being really too weak to do any-
thing; I also had a terribly languid feeling.
Having inherited a good constitution, and being
always averse to calling in a medical man, I en-
deavored to battle through my troubles, trusting
that a certain amount of determination would
throw off this terrible nausea. Exhausted nature,
however, at last gave way, and I was on the eve
of sending for a doctor, when a friend drew my
attention to a remarkable cure of dyspepsia, and
nervous debility effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People. I got some of the Pills as
an experiment, and at once proceeded to take
them in accordance with the printed instructions.
After a few days, and before I had completed the
first box, I felt a visible improvement, my appetite
returned, and once more food agreed with me. |I
continued taking the pills, and am now happy to
relate that I seem as well and strong as ever, and
have suffered no more from that terrible indi-
gestion. I feel deeply grateful that chance threw
in my way Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, as I tell
everyone ; in fact, I should consider myself a
heartless woman if I should not make this thing
public, and endeavor to alleviate the troubles of
my suffering sisters.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are not
a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scientific
preparation, the result of years of careful study on
the part of an eminent Edinburgh University
physician, and they were successfully used by him
in his every-day practice for years before being
offered for general sale. They positively cure
Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago, and Neuralgia,
and are a specific for all diseases of women, such
as anaemia, poor and watery blood, female irregu-
larities, nervous headache and hysteria. They
are not a purgative medicine, but brace up and
permanently strengthen the whole system.
To obtain Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills apply to
your chemist, or send to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Sydney, who will forward (post paid)
on receipt of stamps or post order, 1 box for 2s. 9d.,
or dozen for 14s 9d. #

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. _ It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

Dear Bulletin, —Re Butler. In every
“Morning Liar ” and “Twilight Dreadful” I’ve
met this : “ Shortly afterwards several people
passed his (Butler’s) camp and were surprised to
notice that the tent was down and everything
gone.” This sort of thing makes me mad.
What, in the name of Bully Hayes, were these
people surprised about ? Tents are pitched nightly
and pulled down next morning by travellers as
regularly as sunrise and sunset near every Aus-
tralian bushtown. —6 x 8.
A Bulletin correspondent writes from
S.A. :
“ Politics tabooed ” was the injunction which the com*
mittee-men of Mount Barker (S.A.) Agricultural Society
issued with their invitations to luncheon on the occasion
of the recent Jubilee show of the society. And this is
how they carried out their injunction. They invited
every representative of the genus Fatman who could claim
the slightest connection with the district, and carefully
excluded Dr. Cockburn, who resides in the district,
represents the district in Parliament, is Minister of
Agriculture, and has done more for the producers than
any other S.A. Minister of the Crown. He is vice-patron
of the society, he subscribed to the show prize-fund, he
evinced his practical interest in the producers by exhibit-
ing at the show, and he was on the grounds and, what is
more, was the most popular man there. But against all
these was put in the balance the fact that he is a leader
in the Forward Democratic movement.
Writes the Rev. E. G. Moberly from
Walcha, N.S.W. :
Editor Bulletin,— ln a kindly paragraph which you
devote to me in “ Personal Items ” of March 6, I am sorry
(for my own sake) that there are two inaccuracies. In the
first place, I did not leave a Northern incumbency, to go
to Fiji. I had to resign it, more than two years ago,
partiv from being once more almost starved out, partly
from physical incapacity for the amount of travelling
necessary to do the duties efficiently. Being unable to
obtain any other clerical work, I was living as assistant
to a country photographer, when the agent for the Vicar
of Suva appointed me to leave Sydney in a week, to take
temporary charge of the chaplaincy. I gave up my billet,
came from Armidale to Sydney, to find that the agent,
having failed to inform his principal of my appointment,
the latter had already filled the vacancy. So I have not
gone to Fiji, but am out in the cold. Such are “ life’s
little ironies.”
Tasmanian Parliament opened on March 9
in the most hopeless confusion. First, there was
a lengthy deadlock over the election of a Speaker.
This trouble being surmounted, leave of absence
was granted to a member, Attorney-General
Clark, but, as a matter of fact, Clark is not yet
a member, not having been sworn in. Everything
might have passed off fairly well, but just here an
Oppositionist asked leave to put a motion without
notice. Then rose a Ministerial uproar that no
business could be done till the following day, in
accordance with the standing; orders, followed by
Opposition uproar that business had been done
re Clark. In consequence the House had to
deliberate for something like an hour as to how it
was going to put itself in order without making
Clark forfeit his seat, and whether it could be done
at all. At last it was decided that the House
should simply resolve that it was in order, and
that any rules which prevented it being in order
were hereby suspended to whatever extent might
be required. Then the Oppositionist asked, leave
to put his motion, and after much fuss a division
was taken and the permission was refused on
the ground that the House didn’t feel sure that it
might not be putting itself out of order again.
Then the brief session ended suddenly amid con-
tumely.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hardman put down his “ Oleeve upon Contracts, ”
got out of his easy chair, and went lazily over to
the mantelpiece for his pipe. Next moment it
fell from his fingers, and—cherished meerschaum
though it was—lay broken and unheeded in the
fender, while Hardman, with the look of one who
has received a heavy blow on the head, stood star-
ing intently into the mantel-mirror until his little
Irish terrier, glad to see the book laid aside, came
over and reared up against his leg. Then, with a
sudden movement, the man turned his back upon
the glass and looked down with an air of relief at
the dog.
“ Why, Paddy,” he said, “ that was a curious
thing ! A very curious thing ! ”
He took out his handkerchief and wiped from
his forehead the perspiration of shock. The im-
pulse was strong upon him to look again into the
glass, but—self-dominated by nature and methodi-
cal by training—he resisted.
“ Not yet, Paddy ; at all events ” —still with his
eye on the dog—“ not till we have eliminated
some possible causes of this very extraordinary
phenomenon. First place, I don’t drink. Second
place, I am, to the best of my belief,, sound in
mind and body ; not likely, at 28, to be threatened
with insanity or apoplexy. Third place, I have
not, so far as I know, been overworking myself.
Pooh, Paddy ! it must be some freak of the optic
nerve,” and, wheeling round with a half-laugh,
Hardman looked again into the glass. The smile
died suddenly away from his mouth ; the sweat
sprang out again upon his forehead. “ Great
God ! ” he said, and took a couple of steps back-
wards. It was as before; the mirror reflected
neither himself nor the room he stood in ! A
bright little den, the latter ; with gilt-framed
pictures upon the delicately-tinted walls, and a
tall silver sculling-trophy shining to the brilliant
gas-light from above a host of glittering nick-nacks
upon the buffet. Singlesticks here ; boxing-gloves
there ; everywhere the insignia of lusty, unfan-
tastic young bachelorhood.
“This thing cannot be!” Hardman muttered,
as he gathered in all this at a glance. “ My sight
is disordered—that is all. I’ll see Couchwell to-
morrow ; he’ll soon put the matter right, I know !
I daresay such cases are common enough in his
experience.”
But not a word did he believe of his own reas-
surances—and he knew that he didn’t, as he turned
again and forced himself to gaze upon what the
glass presented.
A large, lofty room, dimly lighted by two candles
that stood in tall iron candlesticks upon a small
table rudely carved in some nearly-black wood.
Of dark wood also were the few chairs and the
ceiling, but the walls, unbroken by any windows,
were of naked stone.
This want of windows curiously exercised and
irritated Hardman’s mind. How did the room
get daylight ? he asked himself, and the matter
seized upon him—mastered him in an unaccount-
able way at which he wondered. He felt an irre-
sistible desire to put the question to an old gentle-
man seated at the little table, with his back
towards Hardman.
“ Pardon me, sir ” —the words would out —“ but
would you kindly explain to me how the daylight
is admitted to that curious apartment of yours ?
I see no windows.”
The old man deliberately got up and turned
round. The light was behind him, and all Hard-
man could make out was that the figure was tall
and straight, and had its leanness accentuated by
a long-skirted, tightly-fitting frock-coat. Keeping
% finger between the leaves of a large book, as if
to mark a place, the old gentleman made an
elaborate and antiquated bow.
“ I am sorry, sir, that I have not the pleasure
of your acquaintance ; but, if you will do me the
honor to step in, I shall be happy to explain to
you why no windows are required in any apart-
ment I may occupy.”
“ Step in ? ” echoed the astonished Hardman.
“ How can I do that ? ”
“Nothing simpler, my dear sir! Move aside
that clock ; bring a chair ; get upon the mantel-
piece, and, as I said before —just step in ! ”
Automatically the bewildered Hardman dis-
placed the mantel-clock and brought the chair.
“But how am I to get through the glass?” he
said to himself as he climbed up on the mantel,
and then, to his amazement, he found that
there was no glass ! The mirror-frame surrounded
merely an open space in the wall, through which
he had no difficulty in reaching the chair which
the old gentleman placed for him to descend upon.
“ This puts me in mind,” Hardman thought as
he climbed down, “ of something I’ve read some-
where.”
“Probably of ‘Through a Looking-Glass,’”
observed the old gentleman as categorically as if
Hardman had asked the question in so many
words. “ But that, my dear sir, is a mere child’s
story. This story will be a very grown-up one,
indeed.”
“ This story ! What story ? ”
“ Why, yours. But, pray be seated; and, to
begin with, let us settle the window-question.”
The light fell now on the old gentleman’s face,
and Hardman saw that it was dark, and lean, and
delicately-featured, with an inscrutable expression
and undecipherable eyes. The hair was grizzling
black ; the pointed beard was nearly white ; and
the man might have been any age between 55
and 70.
“ But, tell me, first,” the wondering Hardman
said, “ how you knew what I was thinking of just
now ? ”
“What you were thinking of?” The old
gentleman crossed his legs and elevated his pecu-
liarly sloped eyebrows. “Why, my dear sir, I
always know what everybody is thinking of ! It
has just now occurred to you, for instance, to
wonder if you will be able to get back to the —er
—actual world, as easily as you have just stepped
out of it.”
‘ ‘ The actual world ? ” Hardman repeated-
turned his head, and saw that there was now no
opening behind him—nothing but the roughly-
jointed stones of the prison-like wall. He got
hastily to his feet. “Why,” he said, “ you must
be the Dev ”
The old gentleman held up a deprecatory hand.
“Not that name!” he said. “Please, not that
name ! It is so offensive—and I am sure you have
no wish to be insulting.”
“ Well, Belial, then ! —or Beelzebub ! ” said
Hardman recklessly. “ Whatever you like.”
“ My dear sir ! —my dear sir ! ” —the old gentle-
man was profoundly shocked—“ I cannot tell you
how much it surprises me to find a gentleman of
your profession so preposterously ignorant of dis-
tinctions in—er—down there /”
And The Old Gentleman—he is entitled now to
the capital initials —got up and paced the room
disgustedly, while Hardman sat and swore inter-
nally that he never could have believed this thing
without actual demonstration. There was, after
all, then, a concrete, personal Devil!
“Once more, sir,” The Old Gentleman put in
severely, “let me beg of you to forego, even in
your own thoughts, the use of that objectionable
appellation.”
“Oh! —ah! —yes, certainly,” said Hardman,
taken aback. “But, now, what’s the next move ?
Y#u don’t want to make a bargain for my soul in
the good old regulation way, I suppose ? ”
“Oh, dear, no!” said The Old Gentleman,
softening a little. “ Quite unnecessary, quite —
with a member of your profession. Go on, my
dear sir ! —go on and prosper in the Law, and the
result is—er—you will pardon me, I’m sure—a
foregone conclusion. ”
“ The devil it is ! ” Hardman broke in angrily,
and in an instant the candles went out, leaving at
first a pitchy darkness, through which came The
Old Gentleman’s voice in accents of severe repre-
hension.
“You are abusing my hospitality, sir ! and, by
way of return, I will satisfy your impertinent
curiosity as to the absence of windows in this
room. The simple fact is that I can, if necessary,
provide from within me whatever light I happen
to require.”
“ From within you ? What, then, do you want
with candles ? Pouf ! —how hot it is growing ! ”
“ Because—you observe a faint glow in this
direction ; because—don’t you find it getting un-
comfortably warm ? ”
“ Warm ! it’s getting simply intolerable,” and
Hardman twisted about on his seat as he noticed
near him a faint, reddish light that grew every
instant brighter as the heat increased, till at last
was clearly visible the Old Gentleman’s figure,
glowing from head to foot like molten metal;
filling the room with an angry illumination and
with the heat almost of a smelting-furnace. The
fiery features wore a mocking smile, and Hardman
rolled upon the floor.
“ Ah ! Oh ! Ugh ! Stop it! Put yourself out!
Switch yourself off, before I’m completely
“There !” The Old Gentleman re-lighted the
candles at his nose, and his incandescence
diminished as rapidly as it had increased. “You
understand, now, what I want with candles ; or,
rather, what you want with them. If I were
obliged, you see, while I have the honor of your
company, to make continued use of my personal
effulgence, you would be —er —well—the frizzling,
so to speak, would be —er—premature. ”
“ Premature ! ” gasped Hardman, as he got up
from the floor and mopped his streaming forehead.
“ I don’t understand.”
“You soon will. How long, let me ask, have
you been in practice ? ”
“Two years or thereabouts.”
“ And your age is ? ”
“ Going on twenty-eight ? ”
“Just so. Well, we’ll subtract 28 from, let us
say, 55—for you will prosper and retire compara-
tively early. That gives you 27 solid years of
practice, yet. Why, my dear sir, it would be the
grossest mismanagement on my part to close up
suddenly such a long and promising perspective
of rascality !—especially since, as I have already
observed, the ultimate result admits of no doubt
whatever. It is, perhaps, a long time for which
to say au revoir, but ... it was as tough a
grinder to get out as ever I tackled. Only for the
gas, it would have given you pepper ! ”
» * * *
The dentist laughed as he stood over Hardman,
with his forceps grasping the molar that had for
days been excruciating that astonished person’s
jaw.
“ How long, in Heaven’s name, have I been
under the influence of the gas?” Hardman asked.
“An hour?”
The dentist smiled and looked at his watch.
“ Why do you ask ? ” he said.
“ Because I’ve been having at least an hour of
the most extraordinary experiences.”
“Yes, nitrous-oxide does affect some subjects in
that way. You’ve been insensible about forty
seconds ! ”

S.M. Herald makes the captain of the

“ cross jack topsail ” and the “after quarter.*

From Oondobolin :
As showing the state to which the present drought has
reduced local stock-owners, a selector out back, who has
cut down all the edible shrubs on his holding to keep his
sheep alive, has now started to educate his sheep up to
eating “ mallee,” of which pest he has a plentiful supply.
He cuts bunches of the latter and soaks them in a solution
of salt-and-water, and offers them in this tempting form
to his perishing stock. It may have an educative influ-
ence, but it cannot be far-reaching, as the bulk will perish
watching the few who eat.
In a Sydney shop-window there is a copy
of “ The Virginians ” containing the following
autograph letter :
Kensington, W. June 2, 1859.
Dear Ned,—l will be with you to-morrow night; you
may expect me. Here is a story I heard but yesterday.
Listen. An acquaintance of a certain Scotch bailie made
a grievous complaint to him one day of the hard times
and the impossibility of scraping together a livelihood in
that wretched country. The bailie’s own experience ran
directly counter to these croakings, for his industry had
realised a handsome competence ; but he knew too much
of the world to attempt proving to the complhiner that
his ill-success might be partly his own fault. He con-
tented himself with remarking that it was surely possible
fora tradesman to draw together a tolerable business.
“Not in this country,” his friend repeated. “ Weel,
then,” said the bailie, “ What say ye to emigra-
tion ? I have heard that some push their way
weel in Australia.” “ Yes,” replied his desponding towns-
man, “ that may be the case once in a day ; but if there is
business there, mair folk are there than can get a share
of it." “ Weel, it may be true, ye say,” replied the bailie,
“ but ye might gang farther—ye might gang up into the
interior.” “ There’s naebody there,” said the grumbler,
“ but kangaroos.” The worthy magistrate, concluding
that kangaroos were a tribe of native savages, among
whom a careful peddler might make indifferent good bar-
gains, replied, “ Weel, a-weel, and isna a kangaroo’s
siller as guid as anither man’s ?”(I!)—Ever thine, W. M.
Thackeray.

I have discarded all others.”
The Wool Fleet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have other tales for telling, we have other
songs to sing, * ,
Who have looped the planet’s waters in a plait of
tarry string;
With a tarry rope a-tether, with the sun, the
wind, and weather,
From the muddy banks o’ Yarra to the ice-bound
Arctic ring.
We have ladled up the oceans in the hollow of a
spoon;
We have hailed the iceberg sailing ’neath a grey
midwinter moon;
We have been to greet the devil when the water
lifted level
And the whirring line made answer to the whiz of
the harpoon.
You have seen the gas-lamps glisten on the water
where they lie,
With the southern stars far showing through their
rigging in the sky.
You have heard the clear bells clanging while the
rowdy winch is banging
To the squeaking screw’s caresses, to the sobbing
of the presses,
When its “Bully in Our Alley,” and “ We’ll Meet
You By-and-Bye.”
Have you heard the night wind talking to the
Wool Fleet ere the rose
From the blushing face of morning, like a dream
of lovers, goes ?
Have you fevered for the lotion of its ever-potent
potion
For the calm of open ocean and the freest breath
that blows ?
You must see them at the sun-up, with their
redd’ning sails aglow,
When the gangs begin to muster and the laden
lighters go,
When the night clouds wheel and scatter and their
crews commence to chatter
In the polygot palaver of a dozen tongues, or so.
They have rallied to the gorging. At the uproar of
the feast,
They are swooping South to swallow eighty thou-
sand bales at least,
With an appetite unsated, with a hunger unabated,
For a greedy London market and the markets
further East.
Oh, the ragged ewes are bleating on the downs
among their lambs,
Where a squatter man hath mated them with
Tassie’s choicest rams,
And our shearer men are riding, for there’s little
time for biding
When the noisy North starts knocking and the
silken East salaams.
So, its “ Haul upon the bowl’n ! ” and another
clipper in.
With a salt-dried score of & )ners who are wasting
for their sin,
While the crowd that gathers round her turn to
cheer the out ward-bounder
That with locks and fleeces freighted, with our
staple product weighted,*
Slips her slackened hawser gaily in the ramping,
rousing din.
Have you hearkened to the night-wind that hath
drifted over-sea,
Where the dead men lie a-rocking in their deep
graves restlessly?
In their weighted hammocks rotten, on the outer
ways forgotten,
On the unremembered inner ways these countless
dead men be.
And the night-wind tells his story of the ghostly
ships that sail
By their ghostly helmsmen guided till the dawn-
light cometh, pale ;
Of the sallow arms that beckon, of that drowned
Vanderdecken
Who for ancient sin unshriven, still, by storm and
thunder driven,
In the teeth of tempests horrid sets his course
against the gale!
But a sweeter tale for telling hath the night-wind
as he rides
Of the flaking foam fast-flying from a roving
trader’s sides,
Of the sunlit waters swelling where the sea-man
makes his dwelling
’Twixt the parting of the oceans and the meeting
of the tides.
There's a drowsy Dutchman’s over, who will sing
his “ Wacht am Rhein ”
When this Frenchman’s finished shouting for
“ revanche ” and further wine:
There’s a dainty English clipper, with a dainty,
dandy skipper
Who was educated early at Newcastle-on-the-
Tyne.
There’s a squat, big-bellied Belgian with a fore-
hold like a tank ;
There’s a Swedish barque ’longside him and the
other side a Yank ;
There’s an old New Bedford whaler rubbing noses
with a sailer
Of the latest modern fashion and the highest
modern rank.
There’s a jaunty White Star liner and her decks
are scrubbed and clean,
And her tall white spars are spotless, and her hull
is painted green.
Don’t you smell the smoky stingo ? Ech ! ye’ll
ken the Gaelic lingo
Of the porridge-eating person who was shipped in
Aberdeen.
There’s a whiff of foreign cooking and a stronger
stink of tar,
And the rattle of the chop-sticks and “ ’e dunno
where ’e are.”
Oh, it’s “ Crachious ! Vot’s der madder?” Oh,
it’s ankles down the ladder,
And a woman laughing softly where the cabin
door’s ajar.
There’s a pretty girl a-flirting with the second
engineer;
There’s a virgin shy declining skipper Yonson’s
pottled peer;
And you’ll find them gaily tripping in their gew-
gaws to the shipping,
“Jan, I lofe you.” “Oui, you lof me! No spik
Englees moch, my dear.”
So, you’ll grease the whole caboodle, and the pis-
ton-rods you’ll shine;
So, you’ll paint em aft and forrard, though
they’ll blister on the Line;
Oh, you’ll clean the whole caboodle to the tune of
“ Yankee Doodle,”
But you’ll sing another ditty at the Horn, oh,
skipper mine !
Ye have answered to the message that they flashed
along the ooze,
Now the ink it drieth quickly, and there’s
time to lose;
’Tis the Philistines’ to barter. Take your mani-
fest and charter,
Hence, ye trouser-hitching legion, we have busi-
ness with the Jews !
Let the Four Winds rise and whisper as ye carry
over sea—
Let them speak of drowned dead men, it hath
naught to do with ye.
Be it yours to freight our plunder o’er their grey
bones rocking under :
Be it yours to freight our plunder o’er the plunder
of the sea.
There’s another song for singing, there’s another
tale to tell,
When the rim of Heaven toucheth on the upward
rim of Hell:
When they’ve spliced the stars together with a
tarry rope a-tether—
When the dead men all foregather with the sun
and wind and weather,
Who have tied the seas together, who have tied
them very well.

Settler Nixon, on the Mossman (N.Q.),
had an experience the other day. After crossing
the river he found he had forgotten his pipe, and
returned per punt to secure it. On stepping out
of the punt and commencing to wade inshore a
large alligator seized him and dragged him under.
Nixon struggled furiously, and finally escaped
with two broken ribs, torn clothes, and a severe
mauling generally. A man who can wrestle
with and escape from an alligator must be pretty
tough.
S.A. Licensed Victuallers’ Association re-
cently gave a delirious whoop of joy because seven
out of the ten S.A. candidates elected to the
Federation Convention are friendly to the Drink
party. The way in which everyone has been satis-
fied is simply marvellous. The Bible-Readers
look upon the result of the election as a direct
message from God, the Register says it shows the
public abhorrence of the Kingston Ministry’s con-
duct in hospital matters (the three Ministers
headed the poll, by the way), and even the Wes-
leyans can see clearly in Premier Kingston’s elec-
tion a direct command from the Almighty in the
direction of Methodist union.
Duncan Gillies drove one more nail into his
political coffin at Ballarat the other day, when he
rose to explain how he wasn’t solely responsible
for his infamous, ludicrous, odorous, “octopus”
Railway Bill. Duncan —the One Wise Head of
the Conservative party in Victoria —“ took this
opportunity to point out that the Bill was first
introduced by Mr. Bent in the Leg. Assembly
when Sir Bryan O’Loghlen was Premier.” The
explanation set his hearers thinking of the Athan-
asian Creed and the Blessed Trinity. Therefore,
there was not one Octopus Biller, but three Octopus
Billers —Bent, the proposer; O’Loghlen, the
seconder; and Gillies, the patriot who tried to put
it through. The people of Victoria, perceiving
here a divided duty, have got their knife into the
three responsible persons for evermore. Amen.
Bill and Jim Nearly Get Taken
Down.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ You see, jt was this way,” said Bill reflectively,
as we sat on the rails of the horseyard, “me and
Jim was down at Buckatowndown show with that
jumpin’ pony Jim has, and in the high jump our
pony jumped seven foot, and they gave the prize
to Spondulix that only jumped six foot ten. You
know what these country shows are ; a man can’t
get no sort of fair play at all. We asked the
stooards why the prize was give to Spondulix, and
they said because he jumped better style than
the pony. So Jim he ups and whips the
saddle and bridle off the pony, and he says
to the cove at the jump, ‘ Put the bar
up to seven foot six,’ he says, and he
rides the pony at it without saddle or bridle,
and over he goes, never lays a toe on it, and Spon-
dulix was frighted to come at it. And we offered
to jump Spondulix for a hundred quid any time.
And I went to the stooards and I offered to back
the pony to run any horse on the ground two
miles over as many fences as they could put up in
the distance, and the bigger the better ; and Jim,
he offered to fight as many of the stooards as
could get into a room with him. And even then
they wouldn’t give us the prize—a man can’t ever
get fair play at a country show. But what I
wanted to tell you about was the way we almost
got took down afterwards. By gum, it was a near
thing !
“We went down from the show to the pub.,
and there was a lot o’ toffs at the pub. was bettin’
Jim a pound here and a pound there that he
wouldn’t ride the pony at this fence and at that
fence, and Jim picked up a few quid jumpin’ ’em
easy, for most of the fences weren’t no more than
six foot six high, and, of course, that was like
drinkin’ tea to the pony. And at last one cove he
points to a big palin’ fence, and he says : ‘ I’ll bet
you a fiver your horse won’t get over that one
safely.’ Well, of course, it was a fair-sized fence,
being seven feet solid palin’s, but we knew the
pony could do it all right, and Jim wheels round
to goat it. And just as he sails at it, I runs up to
the fence and pulls myself up with my hands and
looks over, and there was a great gully the other
side a hundred feet deep and all rocks and stones.
So I yelled out at Jim to stop, but it was too late,
for he had set the pony going, and once that pony
went at a fence you couldn’t stop him with a block
and tackle. And the pony rose over the fence,
and when Jim saw what was the other side,
what do you think he did! Why, he turned
the pony round in the air, and came baek
again to the same side he started from ! My
oath, it astonished those toffs. You see, they
thought they would take us down about getting
over safely, but they had to pay up because he
went over the fence and back again as safe as a
church. Did you say Jim must have been a good
rider —well, not too bad, but that was nothin’ to —
hello, here comes the boss; I must be off. So
long ! ”

“For
some years I was
quite out of health, and
took much medicine
which did me no good. I
was advised hy a friend to 1
try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla!
which I did, taking a dozen!
or more bottles before stop-!
ping. The result was that I'
felt so well and strong'
that I, of course, think there is'
no medicine equal to Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and I take great pains
to tell any suffering friend of it and
what it did for me.”—Mrs. L. A.
Murray, Kilbourn.'Wis., Feb. 11,1896.
WEIGHTY WORDS
FOR
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
The above are indeed weighty words, of great import and value to
thousands of pale-faced, languid men and women, now tired and worn out
with worry, overwork, and disease, and who would be made well and strong
by the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Read also the following interesting
testimony of a prominent athlete :
627 Bourke St., Surry Hills, Sydney,
New South Wales, June 21, 1895.
“After being a victim to Typhoid, Brain, and Rheumatic fevers, in 1892, my
system was left in a terrible condition. Besides being very weak, I had numerous
abscesses on the lower part of my back and spine, from which a great number of
pieces of bone were taken As fast as an abscess would appear and was lanced
another would form. I was treated at two different hospitals without success. The
surgeons in attendance informed me that I was suffering from blood poison. The
abscesses continued to appear, and I was never without pain, till six months ago I
was induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. When I had taken the first bottle I found
an improvement, and after finishing twelve bottles to-day I feel as well as ever I did
in my life; the abscesses have ceased to come, the old ones are all healed, and my
health is splendid Before I used the Sarsaparilla I weighed 154 lbs., and now, after
using a dozen bottles, my weight is 200 lbs., which is a sure sign that I have been
taking the Champion Blood- Puri tier of the world.”— George W. Walker, “Jumbo,”
Champion Foot-baller of New So. Wales.
