BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Some Hints about the Hair.—An Excellent
Shampoo.—Few women realise how all-impor-
tant a really pood shampoo is if the hair is
to be kept in perfect condition. To shampoo
the hair properly, sh.-ke it down, comb it out,
then dip the fingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil. and thoroughly massage the
scalp. Then mix a teaspoonful of stallax
granules in a cup of warm water. Fill a basin
with warm water, into which the ends of the
hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax mix-
ture into the roots in the usual way. Rinse,
and dry by fanning, or in the open air, if the
weather permits. Should the hair be excep-
tionally greasy, the oil massage of the scalp
should be omitted. Stallax can be bought at
any chemist's in quarter pound sealed pack-
ages. It keeps indefinitely, and one package
is sufficient for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A Tonic for Thin or Falling Hair. —When the
hair falls unduly, or lias become- thin and im-
poverished, a tonic should be applied every
night for six or eight weeks. To make a
simple and inexpensive but most efficacious
lotion, at home, take a quarter of a pint of
bay rum and add to it one ounce of boranium.
Shake thoroughly, and leave for 30 minutes;
then strain, and add sufficient water to make
half a pint. Every night massage the scalp
for .10 minutes, going over the entire head,
then dab the mixture into the roots with a
soft sponge. Regular brushing for a few
minutes every morning will also help to im-
prove the condition of the hair.
A Greasy Skin and lilackheads. —A greasy,
oily skin, .with blackheads and enlarged
pores, is a sore trial, and many a girl goes
through life with her appearance entirely
spoiled with these unsightly blemishes, which
may now be so quickly and effectively removed
with but little trouble. To remove blackheads
and the (lull, dirty look of the skin which
accompanies them, dissolve one styrnol tablet
in a glass of hot water. Allow the efferves-
cence to subside, then dip a small soft sponge-
into the liquid and bathe.the face. Leave on
the skin for a few minutes, then dry with a
towel, and the blackheads will come right off.
For a greasy skin, bathe the face three times
a week with styrnol and spray with cold water
every morning, using a vulcanite throat spray.
The Secret of a Good Complexion.—The secret
of a good complexion is so simple that, were
it only more widely known, there would be
no such thing as a rough, blotchy skin.
Nature has decreed that the. outer cuticle,
when it shrivels and dies, shall be removed;
but so many women fail to realise this. To
remove, by absorption, the dead outer skin,
and preserve the complexion in all its pris-
tine beauty, mereolized wax is recommended,
ordinary creams and lotions being quite in-
effectual for this purpose. Smear the wax
over the face and neck, rub it gently into the
skin, and leave for the night. In the morning
wash it off, using a good soap, such as
Pilenta, and all the dead skin will be removed
with the wax. Then apply a lotion to re-
move any trace of greasiness and brace up
the skin, making it firm and white. The lotion
can be made at home quite easily, by mixing
one ounce of clominite in four tablespoonfuls
of hot water. Bottle, and, when cool, apply
to the face with a soft sponge, or the tips of
the fingers, allowing it to dry on the skin.
C.B.—Clynol berries will reduce your weight.
They are harmless, ar<d no alteration need be
made in your diet. They have also one great
advantage over other flesh-reducers: they re-
duce so gradually that there is no fear of
loose, flabby skin and wrinkles.
ZULA. —No, I am afraid I cannot tell you how
to prevent yourself from biting your nails.
You must exercise your will power.
CONSTANCE.—To remove the/ ess
from your skin, get a tin of wax
tn d t* ever .- y ’h’Sht riiuoing it well into
it on till morning; then wash
1. on with warm water and a good soap. (2)
To give a color to the cheeks, get a little eol-
liandum and rub some on a leather. Apply this
to the cheeks. It gives a perfectly natural-
looking flush to the face, and is quite unde-
tectable. (3) To remove the blackheads, take
a stymol tablet and dissolve it in warm water.
When the effervescence has subsided mop the

lotion over the face, allow to remain on for
a few minutes, then wipe off, and the black-
heads will disappear.
GEORGIE.—I am not surprised to hear that
the electrolysis treatments were not success-
ful. They seldom are. Get an ounce of phe-
minol and a tube of tekkxi-paste. Use
conjunction, and yon-will soon be rid of the
troublesome ' sup v ef£iuous hair.
SriElLA.—To restore your hair to its original
color, get two ounces of tammalite and mix it
with three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the-
baic every night or morning. In a couple of
weeks there will be no sign of the greyness.
Tammalite is not a dye, but a natural re-
storer.
ELSIE.--T 0 remove the roughness from your
skin, use a lotion made by mixing cleminite-
with warm water. Allow the lotion to cool,
then bottle, and use after washing the face
every morning. [1

The Red Pa ge
George Gordon McCrae
When Adam Lindsay Gordon was at the
top of his local fame George Gordon
McCrae, his senior by about a year, was
making-sustained flights in notable verse.
In 1870, Gordon, dispirited and for the
moment defeated, decided to throw in the
towel; in 1918—nearly half a century
later McCrae published a work of fiction
full of excellent character portrayal and
breathing a spirit which had about it much
of the buoyancy of youth. Very few men
at the age of 86 have ever done anything
like it.
John Rons is a tale of the time of Queen
Anne, in which the grandson of . one of
Blake’s captains, with a passion for the
sea and naval service, becomes by a series
of accidents an East India merchant. John
is a good friend, a faithful lover and a
sticker when it comes to honest work ; and,
by way of reward, he finds life a pleasant
thing in spite of its disappointments. His
friend Daniel Defoe puts him on the track
of literature; but the game of the pen, as
Steele and Swift and Addison played it in
that golden age, is not for him. Instead
he goes out to Bombay, shoots a bullying
officer there in a duel, gets a fever and
comes home to a junior partnership and
his best girl. His son goes into the navy
and puts up a splendid record; and in the
prologue it is indicated that his son’s grand-
son brought the naval tradition of the family
on to Australia.
The setting of the book is excellent.
Without much in the way of detailed de-
scription the reader is made to feel the
atmospliei’e of London in the beginning of
the eighteenth century, with its full snuff-
colored wigs and dress swords and gallants
whose ruffling had lost something of the
cavalier flavor of the days before the revo-
lution. Anachronisms there are —notably
when “Rule Britannia” is sung a genera-
tion before James Thomson wrote it—and
just occasionally there is a suspiciously
modern word in the narrative; but these
are minor faults rarely absent in the work
of the historical novelist.
In the references to the sea the author
is happy and at home. Some sailor chan-
ties are introduced which ring true; and
Daniel Defoe’s lesson in working his tale
by the chart, with a knowledge of wind
and. coast, has not been lost on his modern
pupil. The yarn has no plot; the incident
is slight; but the characters are quietly
convincing. You could pick this boolr up
aiid, without reference to title page or pro-
logue, imagine that it was written by a
master hand in the early part of the nine-
teenth century. The absorber of modern
novels may find the movement too slow; but
George Gordon McCree has the goods and
delivers them in a vay which must be
described as excellent. The omission of
inverted commas where they are obvioiwß
needed is a typographical error whig£ occurs
once or twice. Still, this may intentional
on the part of an auth«- ;,yho desires to give
the exact effect , an old family record.

E. S. Emerson (“Milky White")
Emerson was an Australian through ant
through, and the writer of the best of hi
work (well known in The Bulletin) coulc
have written much more with permanen
quality and with both an Australian an<
a human appeal. But opportunity limitec
him very often to the less permanent kjnc
of writing, and' he left only two books o
general Australian circulation. “A Shanty
Entertainment.” first published in Melbourne
in 1904 and in a new edition about 1910, i
a pleasant volume descriptive of a group o
travellers delayed in a bush shanty, anc
of the tales they told. It introduces narra
tive and other verses, of which the bes
are a rain song (“There is Music in tin
Mallee”) and a story of a quarrel between
bush-mates and a lonely track. “Santa
Claus and a Sundial” (Melbourne 1909)
is a well-written fairy story, with ap-
propriate illustrations by Percy Lindsay,
for whom Emerson had a high regard.
Most of Emerson’s other writings—verse,
stories and miscellaneous—remain scattered
in files of The Bulletin, the Lone Hand.
the Worker (Sydney), the Sydney Mail,
and other Melbourne and Sydney publica-
tions, with some in Perth and Brisbane.
Born at Ballarat (Vic.) on November
10, 1870, Emerson was the son of a cousin
of Americans Ralph AValdo Emerson. In
some reminiscences which he once wrote
he added that he attended the Farraday-
street school, Carlton, Melbourne, and
afterwards worked as office-boy for Bennett,
Attenborough, Wilks and Nunn, a Mel-
bourne firm of solicitors. His wages helped
him to obtain private tuition. Failing in
an attempt towards qualifying for chemistry,
he went to the bush beyond Booligal, and
followed various occupations. In the ’BB
drought he did a droving trip of more than
600 miles on foot.
Emerson’s journalism began under Mau-
rice Brodzky. at that time proprietor and
editor of Melbourne Tarle Talk. He next
became sub-editor of Clare’s Weekly in
Perth, and later was editor and part-owner
with “Jack” Cameron of the Perth Sunday
Chronicle. (Cameron, a brother of Mrs.
Mary Gilmore, afterwards went to Southern
Europe, edited a paper in Monaco, and wrote
some Australian novels.) Westralian jour-
nalism was varied for Emerson by short
prospecting trips. In 1898 lie began to con-
tribute verse to The Bulletin as “Milky
White.” For a time he edited the Westra-
lian Worker, and he also had spells as
editor of the Queensland Worker and of
the Cairns Post (N.Q.). In Brisbane he
ran the Btg Australian, a short-lived mag-
azine designed to express views of the
laudable kind implied by its title. In June,
1906, he married Elsie Dry Meredith, of
a well-known Tasmanian family, who died
before him. They were good pals to each
other and to their friends. Emerson had big
brown eyes that were those of a seeker, yet.
like many seekers, he never perhaps found
what he sought. Among other handicaps he
liad at times illnesses which were probably
a forewarning of the cruel malady which at
last has ended his days. He put Australia
into his work ; he loved the bush, its trees
and its people; and he had a clear, clean
style and a genuine power of pathos.
"No Gentleman”
I was lunching in a London restaur an
last September when an odd-looking ma
came in. It was Winston Churchill. H
is tall and has heavy, bowed shoulders. Hi
hair is something between sandy and ginge
and the little there is of it is worn anyhow
But he has a great head and wide bold eye
and a mouth and chin of iron. My com
panion, a London business man in a smal
ish way, looked at the apparition with loatl
ing. 1-Ie said that Churchill “ought to b
shot” ; that he was a “disgrace to the coun
try”; that he would ruin the Goverumen
and lose the war; that he was a scoundre
and a fool, and finally and inevitably—bii
terest charge of all —that he was an “ou
sider,” “not a gentleman.” The ungeutb.
manliness of Winston Churchill is an artici
of faith in modern middle-class Englanc
God only knows what it means. The allegec
“outsider” is the grandson of a duke and
product of Harrow ; a solvent citizen with
out a stain on his moral character; and h
is welcome, apparently, in any society tha
he cares to enter. Yet wherever the Daily
Mail is read the creed prevails.
There is nothing novel, of course, abou
the accusation. It is a quaint feature of th
national psychology that some prominen
character is always under the blight of tin
insane reproach. I got a fixed idea, as
small boy, that Chamberlain was a foul
mouthed ruffian who went about spitting on
carpets and robbing people. After the Jam
eson Raid the suburbs decreed that Rhode
wasn't quite a gentleman. When Fisher startec
to reform the Navy the small Londoner win
grabs a top-liat and tears into an ill-paic
city job every morning, proclaimed coldly
that “Jackie might know something abou
sailor ing, but he was hardly a gentleman.’
There were doubts of Kitchener to the day
of his death. The lampooners of a century
ago made a feature of the fact that Napoleon
was not a gentleman, and last August j
found a priceless letter in the Daily
Express arguing that the Kaiser was no
a gentleman because of an ’Arry-like yacht
ing costume he had worn somewhere oi
other!
Boiled down, it all probably amounts to
this—that the bourgeois English hate and
distrust a disturber. Churchill, like “the
little Welsh attorney” of the Insurance Act
epoch, is a great disturber. Viewed from
the impartial standpoint of an Australian
he also seems to be a very great man. He
has packed an amazing amount of action
into his 44 years of life. He has fought in
Cuba, India, Egypt, Africa and France. No
competent judge lias ever questioned his
courage. His “Lord Randolph CJ- Ui chill”
was pronounced by Morley to ' uti t j le great .
est smcc ' “ Thc Life of
Vy He had been three times a Cabinet
Minister before he was 40. .He was a
sensational success as President of the Board
of Trade. He had not held office as First
Lord of the Admiralty for a year before
he decided to abolish the punishment known
immemorially as “10A.” and institute the
“Mate scheme.” A blizzard of protest followed
from the Service Clubs, but lie persisted.
To-day conditions in the British Navy are
more satisfactory, so far as the Lower Deck
is concerned, than they are in even the Aus-
tralian Navy. And most naval officers are
the readiest to state that Churchill was
the greatest First Lord the Navy ever had.
He has made his mistakes, and since he is
what he is they have been well advertised.
But both the Antwerp expedition and the
Dardanelles venture were great conceptions.
The Antwerp scheme probably saved the
Channel ports, though it lost Britain a
Division. The attack on the Dardanelles
might have won the war out of hand. Speak-
ing last year in London Venizelos said: —
I insisted that Greece should disembark an arm v
at Gallipoli. Had my policy not been frustrated by
dissent on the part of the Crown, I can assert, with-
out exaggeration, that the occupation of the Penin-
sula, which was then unprepared for defence, would
have been the work of a week.
By. so little Churchill lost the credit of an
action that would have saved the world
hundreds of thousands of lives and incal-
culable treasure. There is no need to stress
his extraordinarily adroit and successful
work as Minister of Munitions. In Lloyd
George’s new Cabinet he goes to the War
Office; and the Daily Mail, organ of the
small London city man, is cabled as saying:
‘Mr. Winston Churchill’s appointment as
Secretary of State for War is a sure cause of
future mischief.”
But the catch-cries about Churchill’s self-
seeking and incompetence and cynical
absence of patriotism and all decency grow
fainter, less assured. He begins to emerge
as one who, however unlikeable personally,
is Circumstances have not helped him.
His family connections, for various reasons,
have been a handicap to him. He has been
poor, relatively, all his life, and he married
a poor woman. He has an absurd lisp due
to a malformation of the palate, and an un-
pleasant voice. Yet he has made himself
one of the greatest debaters in England. So
far as sheer intellect is concerned he stands,
admittedly, on the highest plane. His pre-
dominant characteristics, otherwise, for good
or ill, have always been nerve and energy.
As a boy of .22 he attacked his own Com-
ma nder-m-Chief as vigorously and 'as non-
chalantly as he was later to attack Chamber-
lain. Tie was prescient enough 18 years
ago to put the case for the Boers before
the scandalised readers of the Morning
Post ; and in February, 1915, when things
looked black indeed for the Empire, he said
in the Commons:—
During the months that are to come the British
wavy and the sea-power which it exerts will increas-
ingly dominate the general situation, will be the
main and unfailing reserve of the Allied nations,
will progressively paralyse the fighting energies of
our antagonists, and will, if need be, even in
default ofall other favorable forces, ultimately by
itself decide the issue of the war.
Surely the man who could do such things
and who, three and a half years ago, could
speak those words, is all that one means by
great. J

can be made to=day. .Merchandise secured by
us as far back as the latter half of 1917 at low
costs has recently come to hand, permitting us
to offer assortments at prices that are without
equal anywhere. As these goods have consider=
ably advanced in price since we purchased
them we £re able to give our Customers such
value as cannot recur, particularly as there is
no immediate prospect of manufacturing costs
being reduced in the centres of production.
Quantities available are specified. In some cases it
will be noted that supplies are limited. A
second selection therefore is desirable.
We pay carriage to any part of N.S.W. on Family
Drapery and Fashion Goods, Cutlery, Electro-
plate, Men’s Wear, Jewellery and Fine Art; on
Inter-State and Pacific Island Orders we pay
carriage to the nearest port.

The Delco-Light Engine and Generator
which generates Electricity.
The Delco-Light Battery in which
the Electricity is stored.

wherever
installed
DELCO-LIGHT IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and DURABLE.
ELCO-LIGHT consists of an engine, generator,
• switchboard and set of batteries. The engine
and generator are direct connected, which does
away with any transmission losses or belt trouble, in-
creasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage
battery is of the special Delco-Light type, consisting of
sixteen glass jar cells, delivering 32-volt current. Unless
the demand for light and power is very heavy, it is
unnecessary to run the engine, except when the storage-
battery requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of
the generating unit. Wires lead from the light and power
connections to this storage-battery, from which electric
current is used as desired for light or power.
You will find Delco-Light to be a model of simplicity.
When it becomes necessary to re-charge the battery the
engine is started by merely pressing on the starting-
switch located on the switchboard. This electrically
cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts
running on its own power in a few seconds. It can then
be left to itself, as when the battery is completely charged
the Delco-Light engine stops automatically.
The supply of kerosene is regulated by means o
a simple lever-operated mixing valve. Moving the lever
to the right or left regulates the supply of fuel.
There is only one place to put oil. The crank case
is designed to hold about three quarts of oil, and a rapidly
revolving gear carries a fine spray to all parts requiring
lubrication.
The reliability of Delco-Light has been proved through
actual service under trying conditions. It has been
thoroughly tested in every possible way, both in the shop
and in practical service on the farm and in the home.
Nothing has been left to chance. The tests have been
more severe than any service an owner would require.
Delco-Light is made by the same Works which have
Delco-Lighted and started over one million Motor-cars^

The Strength of ATLAS in a drop of
PLUME BENZINE
THE ability of Atlas to carry the Globe on his
broad shoulders is positively outdone by the
ability of “Plume” to create power.
Fill up with “Plume” and you get a spirit so rich in
heat units, so full of energy,' that the maximum of
horse power is developed in your engine.
Every gallon of this popular Benzine is of the same
high quality—a quality that ensures “easy starting
sweet running, more miles.” All garages sell it.

A Silver Thread.
Across a tapestry that Fate wove ill
Years ago,
A shining silver thread is running still
To and fro,
As up and down the picture’s April hill
Shadows go.
And in my heart it makes for me a road,
Night and day.
That leads me to a half-seen far abode
Green and gay,
Past starry hedges laughing at my load
All the way.
I know not if the foad will last the years
Falling fast,
Or if the pitfalls and the raining tears
Win at last;
There may be some new sunshine for my fears
God will cast.
But up and down the wall the silver shows
Stubbornly;
Now bright and strong—now dead —now,
living, flows
Wide and free
Towards nightfall for my homing soul that
goes
Out to sea.

Ballade of Lack of Time.
There is a store of little scraps of things
Hid in dim, cobwebbed aisles within my
head—
A dusty pile of half-rememberings,
The doubloons and the silks of books I’ve
read;
Most precious goods well wrought by men
long dead,
Or fellows who still struggle with life’s
skein.
Though all should be ranged neatly there,
instead
A dusty treasure-chest lies in my brain.
Here is a jewelled token Homer brings
And there a ruby phrase of Wilde glows
red;
In the far corner, glints of seabirds’ wings
Which Conrad garnered as a slim craft
sped;
A bright, keen diamond word which John-
son said;
Sweet, perfumed tapestries . from old Mon-
taigne—
The cloths are .faded and the gems lack
thread;
A dusty treasure-chest lies in my brain.
There are the silver sounds of silver strings
Which Swinburne’s ringing touch to music
led; |"
There glimmer Dumas’ heavy signet rings;
The thoughts \yhich flamed through Hen-
ley’s hours f dread ;
The great ideals for which men lived and
bled,
Odd pieces of great joy and bitter pain,
Mixed with the cheer upon which smiles
are fed—
A dusty treasure-chest lies in my brain.

Heigh ho! These things are in disorder
spread
But someday I will sort them out again ;
Meanwhile, as I have got to earn my bread,
A dusty treasure-chest lies in my brain.

Nocturne.
Surely this was the very Queen of Nights,
Who walked in silver spangles and a gown
Woven of purple shadows shot with lights
From moonbeams that the full moon
scattered down,
And wore the stars for jewels in her
crown!
The lilac softly breathed a perfumed prayer
And roses laid their fragrant beauty there.
The wattle-trees had caught the full moon’s
gleams
Fast in their leafy tangle; holding tight
The elusive beauty of her silver beam,
And straining out the splendor of her
light;
Making all plain her magic to my sight,
Till all the ancient glamor of her name
Seemed half revealbd by these trees of flame.
Among the moonlit trees the magpies sang •
Their souls out in a lyric ecstasy ;
And as I listened ancient memories sprang
From out some olden house of memory
That long had been an unknown part of
me;
And then I knew that I was one with these—•
Moonlight and magpies si|ging in the trees.

My Love Is Near.
O Moon above the poplar trees,
O star hung in the green above,
O vine-clad god that flouts the breeze
How can I sing to-night of love?
How can I lift my voice in song,
And will the notes rise sweet and clear?
All choked with tears a tune goes w’rcng,
And my dear love still hovers near
To brush with careful lips a cheek
Pink-tinted in the newest way.
From tight-closed lids my tears still leak,
I wring my hands—alack-a-day !
My love is near and bends him down
To touch a little wayward curl,
Black as a storm my eyebrows frown,
My love is near—the other girl!

GODS AND GIBEONITES.
The gods, or at least the demi gods, are com-
ing home and bringing a wonderful record
with them. For the first time in history a
really large section of the working com-
munity got away from the poisonous atmo-
sphere in which it is taught that the Aus-
tralian is a poor, feckless creature unfit to
do the things that other men do, compelled
to import everything that represents highlj-
skilled industry, including silks and watches
and archbishops and machinery and muslins
and railway commissioners and tall silk hats
He escaped from the mephitic theory that
all works must be executed with boi rowed
money because he can’t earn money,
he didn’t see the Argus or the S. M. Herald
for weeks, and he seemed none the worses for
their absence. There were no plausible: land
agents in the camp trying to sell dust and
rabbits at £2O per acre for soldiers ,to be
repatriated on, and preaching the miserable
doctrine, because they had dust and rabbits
to sell, that Providence made the Australian
a natural producer of raw materials to be
sold cheaply, so that better men might turn
them into* finished goods. In a new environ-
ment away from meddling and muddling
political axe-grinders it came to light tha
Australians had sufficient ingenuity to manu
facture anything; sufficient courage ta fac
anv enemy, even one the size of the wondei
fu/public debt, if the way was only pointed
out to them; and sufficient self-reliance t
enable this country to stand by itself if
the self-reliant quality was only, made use of
in the right direction. It was said ot the Aus-
tralians that they were all ‘storm troops
the kind of men that could be trusted to
lead the way and do the impossible. When
there was a perpendicular Position to be
taken they took it as part of the days
work If the position had an overhang, and
the sides of it had been battered to prevent
the assailant getting a hold they took it
lust the same. Yet because they brought a
Seat deal of intelligence to bear on the
woik their losses were not extraordinary, like
those of the Serbians, who were equally,
rpadv to rush a greased position, with an
overhang in it, but put less ingenuity into
the business.
Vow* the demi-gods are coming home to
be^Gibeonites —hewers of wood and drawers
of water, also carriers of baggage at the
rear of the industrial army. They are
urged to rank with the Chinese humble,
useful, well-meaning, ill-paid folk who were
em ployed for digging and haulage and brute-
force purposes behind the lines in Fiance,
and who looked the great problem of life
in the face and said dully, \\haftor.
They are invited to take on the old 30b
of gouging up the great natural resources
of the country, and washing a little ot the
dirt off them, and sending them away in
other people’s ships to be made up in all
manner of ingenious forms by the advanced
races that do that sort of thing. No new
industries of the slightest importance have
been created in their absence—in fact, even
vith the illimitable possibilities ot muni-
tion-making thrown in, the number of ]obs
has been steadily diminishing for years.
No ships have been built. No new tariff
has been put together. W hen the men ot
1914 come back in 1919 the only fresh
things of any importance to show that time
hasn’t been standing still are the extra debt
and the. drought and the Bolsheviks. The
Minister for Repatriation, a 1 oreign-
trader with a great knowledge ot land-
agency, holds that the establishment of new
industries is unnecessary. And his crowd
really thinks they are more than unneces-
sar y—they are actively objectionable
because they divert people from the earth-
grubbing occupation where their presence
creates unearned increment. A factory is
an asset which loses value every day as
the bricks grow older, but the presence ot
a large number of unsuccessful people on
the clav that makes bricks may give a fancy
value not only to it but to the adjacent
soil. Even the rumor that people are
liable to come may make a value. lhus

Stephens, which the railway carefully avoids
lest the place should compete with Sydney,

nil and the roads are ordinary and the fer-
tility nothing unusual, £5O per acre was
lateiy demanded for a scrap of Government
resumption, on the ground that the long-
forgotten report of the Decentralisation
Commission suggested that people might be
coming there by-and-bye. It is a great
business, this getting of returned soldiers to
partially starve on high-priced land, where
their prescence is liable to gild the value of
adjacent properties which can be sold later
to other peoole who will partially starve
likewise. Every man employed in some
necessary and profitable and drought-proof
manufacture means one bony, disappointed
creature less to sell a selection to. And
the selling is such a simple industry. Any
liar can do it. Every kind of art and
craft and science requires constant study it
the practitioner is to keep up to date, but
this occupation hasn’t changed in its essen-
tials since the time of Abkaiiam.

The repatriation people apparently saw
the battered hero coining before he knew he
was coming himself. He was witnessed afar
off. Long before the war ended the policy
was adopted of squashing incipient manu-
factures with a War-time Profits Tax from
which agriculture is of course exempt, lhe
idea was, apparently, to close every door
except one, and that one has a plausible
invitation over the lintel and a pitfall inside.
It. doesn’t really matter to a lot of the people
concerned whether the repatriated soldier
grows anything or not. If the community
per medium of the usual loan puts him on
the soil he probably won’t be very much
worse off, barring wasted tune, than it he
hadn’t gone 011 it—that is to say, provided
he doesn’t take the land too seriously. The
man who sells the land when, as mostly
happens, it is a private resumption, will be
better off. Posterity will be a heavy loser
bv reason of the bill, but the end of the
world may come suddenly and settle the
matter. The settler is a necessary incident
or excuse or explanation, but if a scarecrow
or a clotlies-prop could sign the necessary
papers it would do as well in many cases.
Certainly there will be the father of: a row
later on among settlers who don t see the
joke, but that is liable to befall over every
salted claim or bogus gold rush. Then the
onlv thing to do as regards a great part ot
the" business will be to start the real repatri-
ation and regard this as an episode that
happened by the way and which is best roi-
gotten.
THE GREAT ATTEMPT TO GET
RACK TO THE YEAR A.D. 1.
One of tlae Australian supporters of Bol-
shevism said recently: “The End is the
thing; the Means don’t matter.” The Means
have been stated over and over again
in the Syndicalist formula: “Demand upon
demand, strike upon strike, blow upon blow
until the Capitalist State is destroyed.” . If
The Bulletin could bring itself to believe
that the destruction of our present economic
system would bring more general happiness
and prosperity, it would be willing to face
the hell which is a condition precedent to
every big change of the sort. But .there is
no evidence in either history or reason to
support such a claim. There is plenty ot
evidence, on the other hand, that this
sophisticated, not to say cynical, community
is particularly unfitted to even start, much
less permanently carry *
The alternative to “the Capitalist State”
is a form of collectivism, the details of which
are never gone into by Bolshevik writers or
speakers in any but the sketchiest fashion.
Collectivism has been tried often on a small
scale; and it has usually failed within an
absurdly brief period. A form of it suc-
ceeded once —for a time. The early C. hust
ians made something of it. They were the
truest democrats on record. Social and
personal antipathies of the abruptest sort
are noticeable among our modern Comrades.
There appear to have been none among
the Christians. The present-day Comrade
of means—and there are plenty of them—
does -not make his home a sort of free
boarding-house for outcasts. The old-time
Christian did. Humble submission to con-
stituted authority in all matters that did
not conflict with their religious principles,
and an utter indifference to material things
—these were the chief characteristics of the
Communists of the first century. There is
nothing even faintly analogous to that spirit
amongst the Communists of to-day. Col-
lectivism succeeded in the very early days of
Christianity for much the same reason that
it is still holding its head up in parts of
Russia. When people are starving or
persecuted and helpless, they tend to come
together. The lower their standard of
living the more they are in a position to
do for one another. But when the world
ceases to be against them, and prosperity
arrives, they drift anart. The same Christ-
ians whose attention and devotion to one
another had shamed the Pagans in C.esar’s
days, were destined, later, to deluge, the
world with the blood of other Christians;
and the same Russians who treated even
their German prisoner's as men and brothers
before the revolution, became murderous
looters after it. The lesson of all which is
that Communism, if it is to be even initiated,
must have as driving forces misfortune and
a deep-seated spiritualism; and if it is to
be maintained the conditions which created
it must be maintained. How does a pros-
perous and rather irreverently materialistic
nation like Australia respond to such a
requirement? # #
Even if it were possible to get Bolshevism
going here on a more or less established
basis, The Bulletin fails to see. who would
benefit. Nations live by the creation and the
distribution of wealth. From the dim epoch
when the civilisation which we know first
started to grope towards the light in the
valley of the Euphrates, up to the present
day, mankind has been working tirelessly to
devise the most equitable way of dispersing
wealth. The Capitalist system isn’t a per-
fect one, any more than our legal system or
our Governmental system is perfect. But it
is the best that the race has been able to
evolve after 50 centuries of effort. The mil-
lionaire and the giant corporation are out-
comes of it, but in the more progressive
countries —notably America —the working-
classes, instead of cursing, have begun to in-
telligently exploit these one-time bugbears.
The human constitution being what it is, it
is impossible for the most bloated, of mil-
lionaires to bloat beyond a certain point.
The capitalist who over-eats or over-drinks
rums his health and his business. He can
only smoke a limited amount. In rare in-
stances he is a spendthrift, in which case
he returns his money to the community m
the speediest manner. But usually lie is
the type described by Carlyle in his famous
picture of Dr. Franoia —one who “wants
nothing, as I am assured, but three cigars
daily, a cup of mate , and four ounces cv but-
cher’s meat with brown bread. .He can
never hope to be more than a distributor so
far as nineteen-twentieths of the money he
makes 4 s concern«d.
* * * *
The early Christian asked for no more
than work diversified by leisure in which to
meditate upon eternity. People have been
leading this safe but drab existence m
monasteries and convents for many cen-
turies. It is also calculated to appeal to
the poorest sort of Russian —to the members
of a class of whom 97 per cent, are illiter-
ates, and who, as regards the amenities of
life, are away back in the Middig Ages, But
what good is it to that virile taker-of-chances
whom the world recognises as the Aus-
tralian? Such a type must always struggle
for higher wages, for better conditions.
for more and more responsible positions,
for that sense of power which comes with
the trusteeship of wealth. The achievement
of Bolshevism means the removal of the two
greatest incentives to work that the modern
citizen possesses —the license to win wealth
and the assurance that when won he will
not be inequitably dispossessed of it. lo
expect any number of renresentative Ans
traiians to exchange those hardly-won rights
for the Bolshevik panacea of small. and easy
jobs for all is like expecting a similar num-
ber of healthy youths to. jump at monasti-
cism as an escape from life.
HEALERS, WHOLE-HOGGERS AND
THE HOLY.
In the clays when the whole European
vocabulary could have been written on the
bone of a decent-sized mammoth, there was
a certain clarity of idea about matters which
succeeding ages of war, tailoring, dyspepsia,
religious controversy and afternoon tea have
tended to confuse. A man in those days
used the same word as often as he now
uses the same newspaper phrase; but when
he said it, although he applied it to a lot
of different things, it always had about the
same meaning. Thus “w r hole,” “holy’ and
“healthy” all come down by long descent
from the same word, and ought still to con-
vey the same idea. The thing that isn t
healthy can’t be whole; and if it isn’t whole
it can’t be holy. #
To a certain extent that underlying idea
persists, though it needs explaining to the
man who has never absorbed the romance
of the dictionary into his soul; but the
complications of modern life lead to an
abuse of terms. Things called holy are
often unhealthy; and lots of things de-
scribed as whole are neither healthy nor
holy. Still, in the business of human reform
which is just now engaging both the Peace
Conference and the advocates of One Big
Union, not to mention the variegated . revo-
lutionaries slaughtering their brothers in the
name of fraternity and howling for destruc-
tion in the name of world-salvation,
the relatives of the old word referred to are
capable of covering the entire field. All
would-be reformers may be placed in three
groups: the Healers, the Whole-Hoggers
and the Holy. Among the Healers must be
included all the moderately reasonable. P9II-
- who want to patch up existing
things, clean out social drains, abolish
parasitical institutions, give the world light
and air, and generally nurse the nations —
beginning with their own —back to health
and sanity. True, there are any number
of moderate politicians so moderate that
they never had a thought of anything
of the kind —in fact, they never had
a thought of anything of any kind.
There are also persons in politics
with excellent ideas as to modes of brigand-
age and well-defined notions about salary
and office, as well as others with inverted
brains and reactionary souls. But none ot
these need be taken account of, except in
as far as they provide occupation for the
zeal and energy of the others, lhe Whole-
Hogger is an" animal of different species.
He must be taken account of and very large
account at that. His contention always is
that the Healers have failed, that the sores
of humanity are too great for political
medicine, and that only by severe surgical
operation is there any chance of general
health. He may be found talking in the park
or shooting in Russia or merely consuming
beer in the pub ; but he gets a footing now
and then in Parliament as well as a place
in gaol. Differing again from all these are
the Holy—men who agree with the Whole-
Hoggers about the, damnable and all but
incurable nature of humanity’s disease, but
who attribute it to different causes and seek
other methods of cure.
* * # *
The Healer generally works, and some of
his plasters stick, while some of his oint-
ments are belauded as having effected cures ;
the Whole-Hogger generally yells and occa-
sionally theorises, with a tendency between
yell and theory to put in a bomb or create
a revolution; the Holy person prays, and
between prayers takes up a collection for - the
heathen. The Healer hasn’t very much time for
the heathen, though he desires to give them
a decent show ; the Whole-Hogger claims the
heathen as men and brothers, but doesn’t sit
next them more often than he can help;
the Holy person likes the heathen much
better than the heathen like him, and uses
them to show the superiority of his aims
over both those of the llealer and the Whole-
Ilogger. The Healer looks upon the world
as his job, and upon the piece nearest to
him as his particular job; the Whole-Hogger
looks upon the world as a perpetual insult
calling for perpetual resentment of the most
violent kind which can be conveniently man-
aged ; the Holy person looks upon the world
as a painful business, slightly mitigated by
afternoon tea and church tennis, and gazes
afar to a life to come in which things are
to be all right if his praying has been up
to standard while on earth. Outside the
three groups are a vast number of people
in all stages of hope, fear, trust and intoxi-
cation who belong to none of them They are
engaged in getting money to get meals, or in
spending monev which might get other people
meals, or in getting meals on credit and
leaving them for other people to pay for out
of money that might be over after getting
meals, or they are making pictures or clothes
or newspapers, or merely leaning against a
post; in any case, they are not immediately
concerned about reform, though they may be
more or less interested in the reforms or the
reform of other people. They watch the
triangular wrangle of the Healers, Whole-
Hoggers and Holy in a tired way which they
reflect by quotations from the daily news-
papers: but they never get up much enthusi-
asm over an affair which lias been going on
without a crowning victory for any party
for 7000 years and as much longer as the
best historian can guess.
Yet if the world could be roused to some-
thing like enthusiasm there would be much
doing. In a country like Australia there
is no reason why Peace should not be cele-
brated by a union of the three forces which
our very language shows to be one in under-
lying idea. Nothing could be more holy
than the healing of our own land; no part
of the world could offer greater scope for
going the wliOle-hog. If the anarchist could
bomb half Europe he would not clear as
much space as is available already for the
freest manhood in this continent. If the
vision of a saint could be realised it would
not make a better heaven than a century of
enthusiastic co-operation could create
between Cape York and the Leeuwin. We
should get down to the job as a religion. If
health and holiness are one, and can only
be found by keeping things whole, the call
of Big Australia is the call of all the years.
That idea is already vaguely in the public
mind : if we can invent that new animal—
the Holy-llogger —the future will be good
enough for all.
WOMAN REGARDED AS A
CAPITALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where everything is being put on a new
basis, it is absolutely necessary to decide
the status of woman and put her on a
basis. Where all the old problems are being
met with a new solution, woman lias to be
solved. She has been a problem ever since
the days of Eve and the boa-constrictor. Pro-
bably she was a problem millions of years
before that time, but Eve is mentioned be-
cause the naked. lady is accepted as a his-
torical or mythical landmark.
She has upset political and all other cal-
culations from that day, if it was a day,
to this. David married Bathsheba, and
wrecked the Hebrew Empire so that that
astute lady’s son might snatch the kingship.
(Bathsheba was washing herself when she
caught the eye of the one great Hebrew
monarch, so again the nude element came
into the case.) Mary, with her three hus-
bands, upset the old order of things in Scot-
land. Catherine and her three sons, all
kings, made hay of France.
The question whether woman is a lull-
blown legal inhabitant or a. chattel has been
argued until the human voice has given out
with argument. , . . ,
So also the question of equal, payment ana
equal opportunity as between women and
men has been debated until the gas has been
turned off to end the sitting. Always the
problem has brought up short against the
fact that woman has to leave off her trade or
profession just as she is becoming an expert
that she may prepare for bringing a new
citizen into the world, and she .can nevei
resume it in a whole-hearted, fashion because
her time is occupied in keeping the new citi-
zen clothed and fed, in washing him, teach-
ing him manners, and rescuing him out ot
the wash-tub when he tries to drovn 1
self. The struggle to strike an aveia»e be-


tween woman as an ordinary citizen and
woman as- —to put it bluntly—a stud animal
is a difficult one.
Also there is a difficulty about distinguish-
ing between woman as a capable soldier part
of"the time, and the same person as a prac-
tically defenceless being when she is encunu
bered with a baby and has to find food for
two while unable to do the work of one.
In a primitive form of society, when law
and government are abolished and war is
made on all forms of capital, woman is apt
to have a poor time. The Russian Bolsheviks
have declared unmarried females over 18
years of age to be State property, to be
given in marriage to any claimant, which is
putting her back in her old place as a repro-
ductive animal. Bolshevism is the first at-
tempt on a large scale and in historical times
to return to first principles, and woman
naturally fails in. In a heroic revolution
she never gets the place to which her num-
bers entitle her, because so many of her stay
at home to prevent the partially-developed
citizen going hungry or dirty or drowning
himself in the wash-tub. When it comes to
a question of force she is the army that is
hopelessly encumbered with baggage, which
is infant, as distinguished from the one that
flies light.
In some Russian districts, where even the
semblance of order maintained at Bolshevik
headquarters doesn’t prevail, woman seems
to have become State property without any
pretence of marriage, compulsory or other-
wise. That is her general fate in a promis-
cuous upheaval. She is a capitalist—the
most numerous and the most envied and the
worst defended capitalist on earth. Even
the poorest of her kind has something to
give or something to be stolen —hex-self. The
value of the gift or plunder is uncertain, but
the fuss made about it has piled up a moun-
tain of history. If Helen was a real char-
acter she represented a bigger proportion of
the available capital of her day than the
Standard Oil Trust did in its day.
Only a very level-headed revolutionist —a
Robespierre or a Danton, but cei-tainly
not a Trotsky —can declare war on capital-
ists and yet pi-event his followers mixing
up woman with other forms of capital. Only
a hard and self-contained upheaver like
Cromwell or Juarez, but not one of the
Lenin type, can declare war on old aristo-
cratic privilege and yet keep his adherents
from mixing up woman’s privilege to own
herself with the other privileges. Sometimes
in the confusion she is confiscated first, and
the chateau of the local peer is a poor
second.
Seeing that the advanced Labor leaders of
Australia have avowedly taken the Russian
Bolsheviks as their model, the question arises
whether the aggregate Australian woman
shouldn’t ask them to find substantial bail
or put down a cash deposit. Certainly the
weaker sex isn’t specified among the things
to be “taken over.” But she never is, being
always lumped in with the “means of pro-
duction.”
HORACE CHEESE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hope Springs Eternal in the Human
Beast.
If the cables may be believed, and even
cables have lucid intervals, the Hun isn’t
the crushed worm he was two or three
months ago, or even two or three weeks
ago. Things have been happening in his favor,
and other things threaten to happen. In
the first place the Bolshevik movement
which threatened to cripple his military
force, and reduce it to chaos and beggary,
and furnish reason for a complete Allied
occupation, has simmered down. There is
no longer a fresh republic or Soviet every
day. Berlin is reported to be quiet. Lieb-
knecht, once the god of a German Social-
ist party, which counted nearly one-third
of the voting power in tlie Reichstag, is
understood to be dead —killed either by his
retired worshippers or by his opponents, and
certainly killed in a disorderly and unofficial
way. Rosa Luxemburg, once the goddess
of the party, is so dead that her body went
amissing in the streets. The Imperial
counter-revolutionists have ceased from
troubling for the time, which removes or
postpones another risk of further Allied in-
terference. Above all, the Spartacus upris-
ing has afforded an excuse for keeping a
large section of the army together and has
even made it popular again. The force
whose tail was down because it failed to kill
I’och has got its tail at least partly up
again because it has at least had a hand
in killing Rosa Luxemburg. No doubt as
a result of all these things the Ebert Gov-
ernment—and it begins to look like some-
thing of a real Government with Hinden-
burg at the back of it —has declared that it
will refuse to make peace except on the
basis of President Wilson’s 14 points. That
hazy and mild and schoolmasterly document,
which included the idea that there should
he no tariff discrimination against the com-
mon enemy, has been a constant source of
trouble to the Allies, and evidently the Hun
hasn’t yet lost hope that the President may
stand on his dignity over it and become
peeved and cause dissension. And they have
other causes for hope. In particular the
Allies who came from distant parts are
beginning to go home. Pearce and
family and the baby and the secretary are
hurrying to England to send the Australians
home. The Canadians and United States
ppople and South Africans and Maorilanders
are going home. The Japanese are mostly
going home out of Siberia. It would take
some persuasion to bring these weary folk
together again. The Huns, on the other
hand, aren’t leaving for any distant home
and are always handy. The prospects of
a genuine upheaval in Ireland with a dis-
sentient Parliament in Dublin are brighter
than they were at any time during the war.
And there is actually a nice fresh party in
Australia which is allowed to preach Bol-
shevism openly, and threatens to keep not
only this country but to some extent Britain
employed by establishing Soviets and repu-
diating the public debt. The chance that
Italians and Serbs may come to a
scrimmage over Dalmatia and keep each
other employed isn’t absolutely lost.
A British statesman has admitted that his
country was much nearer being fought to
a standstill through sheer lack of money than
was commonly imagined. This lends color
to the belief that Britain will stand out of
the vast shapeless Russian embroglio, even
as the other wearied or remote Allies are
likely to do, and that the Hun, wjth infinite
patience and much subterranean engineer-
ing, may carry out the work of re-organising
that country as a friend and supporter. He
has lost his fleet, but it proved of little
use; and his old colleagues (unless he can
assimilate German Austria), but they were
broken reeds; and his colonies, but only
one of them was a source of profit. Yet
he clearly begins to think that a very great
deal may be saved out of the wreck. A
careful sowing of the seed of dissension
among Bolsheviks in Australia and Sinn
Feiners in Ireland and people with color
grievances and people with fuzzy-minded
humanitarian aspirations may do something.
Something may be done by a go-slow
policy which drags out the fulfilment of the
conditions of surrender to the last moment.
In this the Teuton may take a lesson from
the Unspeakable Turk who owed Russia an
indemnity in 1878, and is still owing most
of it, all by reason of the fact that a nation
which is weary of war fought in hot blood
for a principle is reluctant to resume in
cold blood as a mere debt-collector. We are
solemnly assured that the armistice inter-
rupted a Franco-American movement which
must inevitably have crushed the Hun army.
It may turn out to be a world’s calamity
that the interruption happened.

The Miscegenation Spectre.
W. M. Hughes stated Australia’s position
on the question of Japanese immigration to
the Commonwealth last week in terms that
should leave the world in no doubt on the
subject. After his habit, he appears to
have not so much put his case as shrieked
it. Yet he spoke for the- biggest and best
school of thought in Australia when he
said that a Japanese element was undesir-
able here —and he no doubt voiced at the
same time the sentiment of the best school
of thought in Japan. The Japanese are at
least as racially exclusive as we are.
Modern Australia recognises in them a
people who are great in almost every sense
of the word ; and they have, for their part,
expressed admiration for the qualities of
Australians. But neither wants to mix
blood with the other, and so produce that
melancholy hybrid whose existence is a
tragedy to himself as well as to the society
that is to blame for him. The very dis-
tinction of the Japanese, their force and
their intellectual gifts, majje them a more
serious menace in the eyes of those Aus-
tralians who aspire to keep the race pure.
The introduction of indentured Kanaka
labor was not strenuously opposed by White
Australian advocates on racial grounds. It
was recognised that only a few of the very
meanest local white women would mate
with aliens so low in the scale of civilisa-
tion. The type of Japanese whom Austra-
lia has been encountering of recent years
stands so high in the social scale that,
where they are concerned, the color line
tends more and more to be overlooked.
That is the chief reason why the peaceful
penetration of the Commonwealth by immi-
grants from Japan is so undesirable. For
the same reason Baron Makino would un-
doubtedly oppose the settling in Japan of
large numbers of Australians, if it were
on the cards. A nation can view with a
certain amount of complacency the arrival
of inferiors of another color, more especially
when they come on the sort of terms that
such persons will readily accept. But no
people, unless they were looking for misce-
genation, will absorb an indefinite number of
foreigners who differ in little besides color
from the flower of their race.
Ploughing the Barren Field.
In the interests of importers with the goods
of all nations save their own to dispose of;
and land agents, jobbers and speculators
with dust to dispose of; and dull-witted
politicians who can’t tackle any bigger idea
than that of shooing men on to the bunny
and the drought and leaving them there,
the repatriation business plods along the
old track. Yet the latest returns from
N- S. Wales, the State which leads the
way in the two great raw-material indus-
tries of agriculture and mining, is sufficiently
dispiriting. The figures given cover the
period of the great wheat boom and the
great loan boom and the great developmental
railway boom. So they should be different
if the old superstition of persistently
ploughing the most barren field had any-
thing to say for itself: —

These figures do not cover the drought year,
so the decay of agriculture as a source of
employment cannot be charged to that. They
do cover the years when the construction
of railways to uromote settlement was fastest
and most furious. Of course there was a
shipping difficulty; but while that helped
some manufacturers it impeded others by
intercepting the supply of many raw
materials. The Government incurred mil-
lions of debt in financing the agriculturist,
and it didn’t finance the manufacturer. It
cut down railway freights on agricultural
produce to the lowest —to less than half the
cost of carriage, in fact, seeing that the
average charge levied last year on all goods
(7s. 9d. per ton 100 miles) was barely
payable, while wheat was carried at 3s. 4d.,
and hay at 3s. Bd. It didn’t provide the
manufacturer with land on long credit or
seed wheat or anything of the sort, but it
did its best to squash him with the tre-
mendous War-Time Profit Tax, from which
the agriculturist is exempt. And it gave no
extra tariff assistance. Yet manufacture
was the only productive industry that
showed progress, on the whole, despite the
fact that it pays far higher wages than
agriculture, and the wages have greatly
increased of late. The explanation seems
simple enough. There is a huge local market
for manufactured goods as shown by the
vast amounts that go out to pay for imports.
This is the market which the selfish im-
porter—a person often of foreign extraction
and with only a moveable “stake in the
country”—tries to keep for himself by
manipulating the tariff for the suppression
of local industries. In so doing, of course,
he is helped by the land-jobbing interest,
(and there is so much land to job), and they
boom land settlement with one voice afid
one interest. On the other hand there is no
local market in ordinary years for the staple
vegetation produced in Australia, and the
principal foreign market is as far off as the
shape of the globe allows. The inference is that
manufacturing industries, if not repressed
by special taxes and special railway charges,
and if given something like the tariff en-
couragement they get in rival countries, can
repatriate the returning soldiers better than
the “natural” industries. And there are
more than the soldiers to be repatriated.
That increasing crowd which is without
visible productive means of support—the 61
per cent. (58 per cent, a few years ago)
which is neither pastoral, agricultural,
mineral nor manufacturing—can’t go on in-
creasing for ever, especially as the borrow-
ing policy isn’t quite what it was. The
Bolsheviks, at least, appreciate the situation.
They propose to “take over and own the
workshops.” They don’t propose to steal
or nationalise the wheat industry. So far
as they are concerned, anybody can have it.
The Great National Industry of Building
Railways.
It wasn’t possible to do much during the
fag end of the great war year, but with
the advent of the peace year the N. S. Wales
Government leaped into the London market
like the agile kangaroo, and borrowed
£8,000,000 at 54 per cent. This will pro-
bably be quite 6 per cent, when discount
and expenses are allowed for —possibly more
than 6 per cent. Still the case is urgent with
a Government whose rule is that, no matter
how much revenue money may come in, only
loan money must go out for works. Hol-
man’s State is up against two propositions
just now, and they don’t agree. The rail-
way and tramway men ask for more wages
and better conditions, which is reasonable
enough. Also the vast industry of loan-
railway-building, whether the lines pay or
net—building into the desert or to the moon
or anywhere—has been carried by the present
Government to such a point that it has cre-
ated a special class of workers which is too
strong to be ignored. This class demands
more railways—even 6 per cent, loan rail-
ways—to keep it employed, as the Roman
lion used to demand Christian with its
morning coffee. So the situation is like
this: —
The existing lines, burdened with a first charge
for interest at the rate of 4 per cent., don’t earn
enough over the interest charge to pay existing
wages. If they had been built out of taxes and
land-sale money, they could pay about 60 per cent,
more wages without turning a hair, but no lines
were built that way, and none are being built.
The margin left for wages is likely to grow
smaller, for the old, cheap loans are falling due
and being renewed at alarmingly high rates.
The building of new lines at a rapid rate,
partly because a great railway building class has
been created, and must be kept more or less em-
ployed, tends to further diminish the margin avail-
able for wages to the railway managing class. The
new lines are all made with expensive money, and
they are practically all in districts where people
and traffic and earnings are scairce. Built out of
revenue the worst of them might pay fair wages,
but with the 6 per cent, first charge eating at
their vitals, they don’t look like paying any wages.
In 1875 there were 1360 people to furnish business
for each mile of line; in 1895, 501 people; in
1905 443 people. Now there are only 390.
The obvious remedy is to put up charges. But
they can’t be put up on many of the new 6 per
cent, lines, for there are hardly any people to put
them up on. They are being, built to attract
people by cheap carriage. So the increases must
be on the lines that pay already and there aren’t
too many of them.
It. is a fine problem, but the men who build
railways out of loans have all the advantage
over the men who work railways built out
of loans. The wages of the former may be
any amount, for they are not regulated in
any way by the earnings of the lines. And
the more the builders get the bigger the 6
per cent, interest bill which eats into the
workers’ earnings. Unless the Labor party
which is largely the responsible party
squashes the loan policy which puts that
wonderful bill ahead of the railway men’s
wages, there will be a still bigger problem
very soon.
Man—Still of Some Consequence.
Fop. three years most people on both Sides
believed that it was a war of machinery, and
that the human equation might, compara-
tively speaking, be disregarded. During all
that long period of blood and agony both
sides were obsessed —certainly the Allied
side was —with tlie idea that a line prepared
without stint of either time or money must
at least be smashed before it could be taken.
The British high command held to this view
the most doggedly; the French had some
doubts about it. and their General Nivelle
made at least two attempts to break through,
first at Soissons-Rheims and later in the
Champagne. He failed; but he failed not
because he attempted; too much but because
he attempted too little. Not putting enough
trust in his infentry, he used the old bom-
bardment as an overture to his direct
attack. Even the Crown Prince had sense
enough to rush-men.up to the performance,
and it was a tremendously reinforced Hun
army which threw the Frenchmen back.
Then came BYNGy and, even conceding that
he was guilty of one error of judgment,
when just estimates can be formed of values
rendered in the great war it already seems
probable that few British generals will
stand much higher than he. That what he
did was not of great immediate value to the
Allies reflects no discredit upon him, but
only upon that unimaginative higher author-
ity which was unable to see the possibilities
of his enterprise. To prepare for his infan-
try attack he asked for only two things: (1)
a very brief but fierce bombardment to
“rattle” the enemy rather than destroy the
enemy’s material defences; (2) a fleet of
tanks to smash a way through the barbed-
wire entanglements ahead of the enemy
trenches. He succeeded—this was at Cambrai
late in the autumn of 1917 —only to find
that, because even British generals did not
know how magnificent British Tommies can
be, success was not foreseen and the harvest
of it could not be gathered in. Actually,
indeed, that success cost us more within the
next six months than we got out of it; for un-
questionably the awful German offensive of
March, 1918, which came perilously close to
being the final Allied disaster, was governed,
if it was not prompted, by Byng’s perform-
ance. One thing, of course, the Hun did
which the British did not do: he had secretly
gathered enough force behind him to follow
ui) his first blow. Some of those astonishing
Diggers of ours know what happened. De-
moralised by being thrown out of their pre-
pared positions by overwhelmingly greater
numbers, the Allied troops went back 45
miles before one breathless drive: went back
until they were flung almost upon Amiens.
Outside little Villers Bretonneux there is a
hill—a mere pimple—on which that awful
wave was first held ; and the holding of it
was done by an Australian division. At
that hour the tide turned. The human equa-
tion had once more asserted itself- The
myth of the impregnability of the prepared
field-defence had been exploded- We learned
our own lesson. Nothing, indeed, seemed
impossible after the Australians had cap-
tured Mont St. Quentin. And in the way
of taking prepared lines nothing has been
impossible.
Repudiation, Revolution or Something
Else?
At a special meeting of the Perth Returned
Soldiers’ Association it was decided that if the
cost of living and house rents are not reduced
the branch advocates the repudiation of the public
debit. — W estralian news item on a recent day.
Mr. McCallum, Labor Federation secretary, said
that in a year there would be 20,000 returned
soldiers in Westralia and 10,000 would be un-
employed... .If a bloody revolution was desired
the Labor leaders need only sit back and allow
the Government to continue its present inaction.
The hours of labor should be reduced to provide
more work but without a reduction in wages.—
W estralian news item same day.
Westralia is up against an extraordinary
problem. It is difficult to remember any
white community of the size that has ever
been up against anything so remarkable ex-
cept in time of plague or invasion. And
even when Florence was depopulated and
Jerusalem was sacked, and Pompeii was
smothered, there was no public debt of £2OO
or so per inhabitant owing by the debris.
In its good days gold represented over nine-
tenths of Westralia’s minerals and much
more than half of its output of every sort of
raw substance. No other State has trusted
so much to the crude Chinese or Kaffir job
of digging, or borrowed so much on a perish-
ing security, or become so imbued with the
idea that because this is a new free coun-
try it should be able to pay high-class arti-
sans’ wages for something not much more
complex than mule’s employment. It is
certainly difficult to see what the State can
do unless it sets about some better kind of
work. The idea of putting three meq at
the same old wages to bake the same amount
of bread as two men did, or to build the same
amount of house or dig the same amount of
gold—or rather a much less amount of gold
—can only make prices 50 per cent, higher,
all except the price of gold, which wouldn’t
go higher, so the industry would stop. And the
demand is for lower, not higher, prices—that
is to say,higher*pricesfor makingthe bread and
lower prices for it after it is made. With
20,000 men coming back to a market which
was bad when they left and is much worse
now, the gold yield having dropped one-third
during their absence, there are occasional
suggestions that blanky revolution may be
tried. But no revolution, however blanky.
is an immediate money maker. As a rule
it reduces production, for a time, and it is
very expensive apart from the breakage. The
handy-looking alternative device of repudi-
ating the public debt has a great many advo-
cates. But while Westralia might, if per-
mitted, repudiate its State debts, it can’t
repudiate its share of the Federal debt. The
Commonwealth Government collects, through
the Customs and otherwise, the interest on
that. Probably the Commonwealth would stop
all subsidies payable to the State and allot
the money to the creditors, in which case
Westralia would have a lot of excitement but
very little advantage. Further, nobody lends
money to a country which announces that it
can’t or won’t pay the interest. The year
to June, 1915, was a good average year be-
fore the Federal authorities insisted on State
loans being temporarily reduced on account
of _ war demands. In that year Westralia
paid about £1,600,000 for interest on old
debts —a terrible amount for its handful of
people—and floated about £2,500,000 of new
debts, so it had £900,000 surplus for a tem-
porary razzle. If it had repudiated its debt
that year its razzle would have been
£900.000 worse off through the stoppage of
its credit. If the Australian Treasurer had
withheld its subsidies and used the money to
help pay the repudiated creditors, it would
have been about £1,700,000 worse off. That
"would have made the deficit at least
£2.800.000 for the year instead of the
£600,000 it was. The spectacle of a popula-
tion equal to less than half that of Sydney
with a shortage of these dimensions would
be something quite new. With the practical
stoppage of taxpaying which always happens
at a time of financial chaos and with the
cost of the blanky revolution which happens
at the same time, it is certain that great
doings would supervene. There might even

The Trouble on the Transports.
The gist of the Sardinia troopship trouble
is evident enough to returned men of any
experience, however puzzling it may seem
to civilians. Mixed up with the genuine
soldiers was a batch of “undesirables, or
men “returned for other_ reasons” —vari-
ously estimated at from 150 to 200. The
“undesirable” views everything upside down.
He takes pride, for instance, in having
evaded service in the line. Where other
men point to decorations and stainless con-
duct-sheets, he sets out the tally of his
desertions, the women lie has lived on and
swindled, the convictions he has had in the
military and civil courts. He can be relied
on, in the course of ten weeks at sea, pro-
vided there are enough of him, to upset the
discipline of almost any ship. It is to be
hoped that the Government will presently
see the wisdom and equity of returning such
men—habitual deserters and men who have
served sentences of over three months —in
separate ships and under efficient guards.
Meantime the self-respecting troops in every
home-coming' ship should, for their own pro-
tection, single out this section at an early
stage of the voyage and let them understand
that grievances about shore leave, scanty
bacon at breakfast and so on, are preferable
to the “undesirable’s” method of coping with
them. If it isn’t done there will be a series
of dirty-linen washing competitions which
will do the Digger no good on his return.

A “Fancy” Industry.
The world’s beet-sugar crop for 1918-1919,
according to the latest estimates, will yield
4,356,000 tons, or more than one-quarter
the total production of sugars from all
sources. The fact, however, cuts no ice
with Treasurer McPherson, of Victoria.
He isn’t interested in beet-sugar. Bailey,
M.L.A. for Port Fairy, has suggested that
the Government might provide a factory in
the Western District, on the condition that
the local farmers put in 1500 acres of
beet —an apparently reasonable proposition,
providing that the works are built
in a region with an annual rainfall of over
25 inches, which is to say anywhere in the
vast area between Colac and Portland. All
that the treasurer can do, however, is to
declare, with a benign indefiniteness, that
the Ministry “will help any genuinely co-
operative movement which tries to help
itself”; and he fails entirely to explain what
the Government will do or when it will be
done. In the U.S., according to Dr.
Cherry, formerly Vic. Director of Agri-
culture, “the production of beet sugar rose
from 164,000 tons in 1902 to 540,000 tons
in 1912.” The 1917-1918 crop was 682,000
tons. Cherry also explains, in his chapter
on beet-growing, that the beet-sugar of the
U.S. is grown by the highest-priced agri-
cultural labor, in “white” States, while
cane sugar is produced by lower-priced
colored labor. The vegetable can be grown '
and usually is grown as an adjunct to
mixed farming ; the leaves, crowns and pulp
are all excellent cattle-foods; the sugar all
comes from the air; and the necessary
summer-cultivation releases large supplies
of plant-food. Yet this industry has been
described as a “fancy” one and unsuitable
for returned soldiers. The lamentable fact
is that the average Vic. farmer “can’t
be bothered” with such a market-gardenish
crop —too much hand-work and not enough
time to lean over the fence and talk about
Strawberry. But the returned soldier has
so far shown an almost amazing willingness
to “try anything once,” so long as it shows
a prospect of success in the long run. The
soldier on his mixed-farm in the Western
District would hardly regard himself as
doing a foolish thing by putting in a few
acres of beet, likely to produce a gross
return of £l2 per acre under fair conditions.
But there must be enough of him at work
to supply a “juicery,” at least. McPherson
ought to go down to the Western District
and examine the possibilities-

A document that has come into the hands
of the French Judicial Committee appointed
tjb investigate the ex-Kaiser’s responsibility
for the war deserves to be framed by every
Pacifist and every apologist for the blood-
glutted ruffian. It is a letter written to
late Francis Joseph at the beginning of the
war, and, in part, is as follows: —
If necessary, everybody and everything must be
put to fire and sword. Peonle must be slain re-
gardless of sex and age. Thus will the war be
ended in a few months. Humane considerations
will only prolong the war.
The genuineness of the document is attested
by the exactitude with which the perform-
ance followed the policy. but
direst severity exercised upon the Kaiser
and his brood will only enhance the pros-
pects of the flood-gates of blood being re-
opened when least expected.
From the Swiss point of view, the sudden
inrush of Germans from the two defeated
empires and the noise of German capital
clattering into new business concerns among
the mountain's may seem to make amends for
the serious losses which the little republic
suffered during the war: but. as seen by
those who have admired Swiss democracy in
the past, the picture is not quite so fair.
William Tell may have been a German of
a sort, but he- left a good footprint on the
road to democratic liberty ; and the idea of
Uri, where the arrow-and-apple act was
staged, coming to be a mere adjunct to a
German mill which employs Germans to the
disadvantage of the hardy mountaineer, is
like introducing Charlie Chaplin in one of
his depraved eating stunts on the balcony of
a troubadour’s romance. Bdt trade is trade
just as truly as war is war ; and when the
big countries smash the little countries must
expect something of this sort.
“Muzaffer” from Singapore: —
I agree with “Malaysia” (B. 3/10/’18) that Aus-
tralia is not getting its fair share of the trade of
this part of the world because of the woeful ignor-
ance of Australian manufacturers. They have a
lot to learn from the Japs, who have recently rented
a large building in the centre of the city for a
commercial musuem —a fine advt. for Nippon’s goods.
The Australians missed a great chance during the
war, when most British-made foodstuffs were unob-
tainable, owing to shortage of ships, and merchants
here were compelled to send to Australia for jams,
pickles, biscuits, rolled oats, etc. Had the Aus-
tralians been awake they would have captured this
handy market and prevented English firms coming
back. But one day you got a specially-good
Australian jam; the next you asked for the same
brand and found there was none to be had. Aus-
tralians setting out to get a footing here must
keep stocks big enough to assure a continuous sup-
ply. It would surprise most Australians to see
how even the poorest natives tackle biscuits, and I
am glad to say that just now Australia supplies the
whole of this part of the world. But I fully expect
to see the English in possession in a year’s time.
Australian merchants should combine to start an
Australian commercial showroom, where importers
could see samples of all Australian manufactures,
and be put in touch with the makers. The
manager of this show might have a few travellers
touring the F.M.S. and Siam, not" to mention
Borneo; but his principal business would be done
here, as Singapore is the great trade-centre of this
part of the world. This, with constant advertising
and carrying large stocks of the most saleable lines,
would soon capture the whole of this great market.

Two deaths at the Sydney Quarantine Sta-
tion in one day, from tubercular trouble
following upon influenza, ought to be
nearly enough to get some attention
paid to one or two of the unpleasant
practices of that institution. Lately a
thousand and more people have been
crowded in two or three small compounds,
and the water they have drunk has been the
water that has been caught on the roofs of
the low-built pavilions. Further, as a con-
tributor lately pointed out, this water is con-
served in tanks which cannot be flushed out;
and they have been so long in use that some
of them have holes in them. These holes are
plugged up with anything that is handy—a
stick with a rag wrapped round it in one
instance at least. There are other grossly
unhygienic conditions observable at the sta-
tion ; but these are enough to go on with.
“One of Many” : The British War Office
has a quaint humor of its own. My son was
killed on Gallipoli, in the first days. Three
years later, last May, “George R. 1.” signed
a commission appointing “our trusty and
well-beloved” a lieutenant “or such higher
rank as we may from time to time here-
after be pleased to promote or appoint you
to.’’ ip “Our Land Forces.” Base Records
has just forwarded me the precious docu-
ment, explaining that it refers to “the regu-
lar forces of the British Army.” The joke
is rammed home by an endorsement in large
red letters that the appointment, made May
3, 1918, three years after the lad was killed,
is merely “temporary.”
Woodrow Wilson, the Hope of the Huns !
Every official German reference to Fritz’s
attempts to avoid restitutions contains a
mention of President Wilson and" his Four-
teen Points. For instance, General Von
Winterfeld: —■
A refusal must be made in all circumstances to the
demand that Germany shall replace machines [stolen
from occupied territory] by others essential to Ger-
man industry, because such a step would inaugurate
the economic war which is deprecated by President
Wilson.
Inaugurate economic warfare! The Huns
inaugurated it years ago, when they stole
the machinery and did every possible kind
of commercial damage to Belgium and
Northern France. If a bully stole a blind
man’s dog, would the world say that all his
own dogs must be sacred because he needed
them for foraging?
In the struggle to slide out of present
difficulties, it has already been proposed that
German East Africa, Hun South-W est
Africa, the Hun islands in the Pacific, Syria,
Palestine, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Constan-
tinople, and possibly Asia Minor shall be
more or less neutralised and put in charge
of a committee of nations. A somewhat
similar philanthropic plan is suggested for a
number of indefinite States that are begin-
ning to appear in old Russia, and a sort of
Board of Guardians is suggested for Poland
and even China until they emerge a little.
It looks as if the world might develop into
a gigantic school kid, with a benevolent old
maid aunt to keep him out of mischief.
M’lver withdrew his application for the

another hundred a year.
Steve Barker, who shares with John
Barnes the representation of Vic. Labor
in the Senate, has of late been as reserved
as a bandicoot in its burrow —possibly
owing to a difficulty in adequately express-
ing himself about the New Revolution, the
0.8. U., Bolsh-hic-ism and so forth. Occasion-
ally he gets into print in a mild manner —-
a little something, perhaps, about taking the
chair at a tea-meeting or as having been
among those present at an electoral-reform
gathering. The other day he ran to a par.
or two by eating a portion of tinned
ptomaines. He is better now; but mean-
time his stable-companion, Barnes, gathered
a whole lot of crimson limelight by definitely
declaring his sympathy with the Bolshing
bunglerliood.

The Privy Council has been puzzling over
a very fine point, the word “the” in a lease
of the Red Lion Hotel in Adelaide. The
lease, made long ago, bound the S.A. Brew-
ing Co. to pay all rates and taxes “except
the land tax.” The owner therefore paid
the State land tax, but when a Federal tax
came along he argued that it was not covered
by the exception. Symon, K.C., failed to
pefsuade the Full Court of S.A. that the
co. was right in holding every kind of land
tax excepted, and the Privy Council has
dismissed an appeal without calling on the
other side to argue. As a Federal tax could
hardly have been foreseen when the lease
was made, some 30 years ago, the inclusion
of the word “the” was probably just a
chance; but, being there, it limits the ex-
ception to the one thing in sight, whereas
“except land tax” might well cover any tax
of that kind, present or future.
“Peter” : Woodrow Wilson’s fondness for
the typewriter (B. 23/1/T9) is hardly less
than his enthusiasm for shorthand. Many
of his speeches are first roughly drafted in

stenographers and typists. Next to Tumulty,
his official secretary, who is a dexterous
shorthander and typist, he reveres Charles
Shem, Pitman’s acknowledged speed king
in America. After those two there is a long

writers who only use a pen to sign for their

From the Gallery :
I shall not forget the evening when Robert Harper
sailed impressively into the Reps, with a medal
like a star hanging to his watch-chain. He had
made a good financial speech that afternoon, and was
still wrapped in the odor of authority.' Anstey on
his feet, answering some of Harper’s arguments, be-
held the apparition approaching, and with a scorn-
ful wave of his hand he shouted: “Here comes the
financial Solomon with the star of his unadulterated
mustard gleaming on his chest!” It was one of
those devastating impromptus that made Anstey a
terror to all his political enemies.
“0.L.”: Official inquirers in the U.S. have
discovered that, in their country’s silk-weav-
ing industry, 1000 tons of vegetable or min-
eral “loading” are used each year. A good
deal of this dressed-up silk, some of which
largely consists of scrap-tin treated with
chlorine-gaS, comes to Australia. Consider-
ing the difference between the Australian
retail prices and the actual landed cost of
materials imported from the U.S. and the
“East,” there is surely an opportunity here
for the Federal Government to do something
to establish the local manufacture of silk
fabrics. The U.S. imports the raw material
for its silk-weaving. Even if it can be
proven that, because of labor conditions,
Australia can never compete with other
countries in the production of raw silk, what
is there to stop this country from importing
its own raw material and doing what has
been done for years past in Connecticut, a
State in which thousands draw white-
people’s wages out of a steadily-expanding
silk-weaving industry? Nothing, appar-
ently, but a prohibitive tax on the manu-
factured article from abroad.
A Light Horseman sends a word or two
to steady Mrs. Rumor: —
By this time I guess you will have heard of the
hullabaloo in Cairo the night of the armistice. Let
me assure you that the Australians were not the
culprits. Our boys kept well aloof. Indeed, so far
as they were in it at all, our Light Horse helped to
do the decent thing. As one veteran Anzac put it on
returning to camp: “If it had been just Mafficking,
I’.d ha’ been in it up to my neck. But smashing
and looting from these poor devils is no good to me.”
“Trooper Bluegum”: Since their first
acquaintance with “Beachy Bill” at Gal-
lipoli the Australians have given fancy
names to all the enemy guns that have
devoted special attention to their lines. The
latest is “Jericho Jane,” though some of the
Tommies call her “Nimrin Nellie.” Any-
how, Jane will probably visit Australia
later on and be lodged in the Australian
War Museum. This gun, a long-barrelled
5.9 in. monster, used to be hidden somewhere
in the Wadi Nimrin, whence she shelled
Jericho regularly. But in one big scrap
when Abdul bolted, Jane was too cumber-
some to run with, so she was pushed over
the cliffs into the bed of the Wadi. There
our Light Horse found her. But it will be
a big contract getting her up again.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
New South, being unable to risk any
more while the Federal and Victorian Health
authorities were solemnly arguing whether
the tragedy in rehearsal in front of them should
go on the bills as “Influenzal Pneumonia”
or “Pneumonic Influenza,” has shut all
shows off at the meter. Tiie Bulletin had
made up its mind just before the stop-signal
to have a night out with the girls at the
“movies” —Theda Bara, Enid Bennett, Flor-
ence Reed and a few more; but that’s off.
Still, there is this consolation —the picture-
play critic has now time to write a comedy
for Charlie Chaplin entitled “Influmaniacs.”
By a recent suspect: —
A pest ship left the Pacific Coast when ’flu was
at its worst there. Vancouver and San Francisco
were in a state of shivering funk. For nearly a
week the agents had the greatest' difficulty in get-
ting a gang to board their ship, for she had loaded
at Maoriland, and was reported to be “reeking with
disease.” Among the passengers —there were nearly
400 of them —were 45 or 50 Anzac men, all or
nearly all senior officers. They had been well
trained not to show any fear, if they ever felt it.
I think many of them didn’t know what it was.
There was General Brand, for instance, who had
made a splendid hobby of inspiring his men with
confidence. The influence of these officers was soon
manifest. From first to last there was no funk
on that ship. Temperatures were taken and a
fumigating spray was provided; and if anybody
insisted on going beyond 98.8 and staying there he
was isolated. But the round of games and the
tournaments went on; there were concerts; there
was the inevitable fancy-dress ball; there was the
equally inevitable book-evening. The ship crawled
across the Pacific; for her coal was poor and she was
undermanned in the stoke-hole. And, worse still,
she lay for over a week in Auckland harbor. Yet
the only death on board was that of an old lady
who suffered from some internal trouble—cancer, I
believe. Certainly not from influenza. The moral
of all of which is: Take reasonable precautions; keep
cheerful; and don’t get scared.

The J. and N. Tait repertory company
tackled Isben’s “John Gabriel Borkman” at
last Sydney Palace matinee with much vigor
and a measure of success. As a play, John
Gabriel’s sorrows seem poor stuff. There
is not a dramatic situation shown, thougl
there appear to have been plenty before tin
rise of the curtain. The players, with
two notable exceptions, spoke their lines
as if they were in melodrama, and
melodrama in which one person preaches
in a thunderous bass for the greater part
of three acts is over the odds. The excep-
tions were Monica Scully, whose Frida
Foldal, though a small part, was ex-
quisitely worked out in tone and action;
and Gregan McMahon, who, as Vilhelm
Foldal, presented a perfect character study
of a person who seemed to fill no real part
in the action of the play. Here and there
the others showed emotional power and did
work that was convincing; but George
Bryant’s stentorian lead ' seemed on each
occasion to driVe them from the naturalistic
method to one that was painfully artificial.
Whether Ibsen’s rather futile play has the
power in itself to destroy the craftsman-
ship of the actors is a point worth discus-
sion ; certainly, the J. and N. Tait company
had already proved that it could make a
dull play appear brilliant.

One thing very evident about the “Bork-
man’’ matinee was that the management had

been at no pains
over the staging of
the piece. If
repertory plays are
to have a chance
they should a t
least be taken seri-
ously by those at
the cash end of the
affair. Any actor
must be depressed
by having the same
dull pictures on the
walls of his house
whether he is sup-
posed to be in
London or in Nor-
way ; and that de-
pression cannot
fail to spread to
the public. It will
be a thousand
pities if Gregan
McMahon’s fine
effort fails because
the proprietors,
while accepting the cash and credit, cannot
enter into the spirit of the thing.
“Bloggs” visits one of Art’s byways:—
The Gaiety in Oxford-street (Sydney) provides a
thoroughly friendly gathering, especially op an Ama-
teur Trials night. Small children push about the
stalls and fall into the orchestra, and either bolt
through a side-door leading to the stage, or are fired
into the street through an aperture marked “Exit”
—to presently reappear and do it all over again.
Mothers suckle their offspring in the reserved stalls.
It might cause embarrassment at a Melba concert.
Here nobody notices.
The reserved stalls are not bigotedlv so. Two
youths sitting near me went out in the interval,
and a girl, who, having arrived late, had only an
improvised seat under the footlights, promptly col-'
lared one of their seats. When they got back her
chair was also gone. In London, wheie folk’s nerves
are frayed by anxiety and short rations, this would
have led to a row lasting for hours—a row which
. would have spread, and in which the language would
have been dreadful. Here the boys put their case
with smiling politeness. The girl, also politely but
very firmly, intimated thjjt she didn’t mean to shift.
An usher was called. He diagnosed the trouble at
a glance, and affably faded away. The youths con-
tinued the discussion, but after the weakening man-
ner of men who fight a lost cause. In another
minute or so I saw them dive under the stage and
emerge with two old chairs, which they planted near
the drum, the relations between them and their
supplanter remaining amiable to the last. It was
a wonderful lesson in good manners.
The performers are mostly juvenile, and they
are presented by an M.C. in this fashion: ‘‘Now,
ladies and gentlemen, I arsk yer kind attention for
little Vera Smithers, uv Darlinghurst. Vera will
sing ‘’Uckleberry Finn!’ Cummon, Vera.” The
child has the cataleptic glare of extreme nervousness.
She begins in a feeble bleat, strongly supported by
the piano. Cries of encouragement break from the
M.C. The audience joins in. She is saved. No one
gets the bird who can prevail on the audience to
join in—which is, no doubt, why 90 per cent, play
for safety with “Huckleberry Finn.”
An odd feature of the show is the insanely inap-
propriate costumes of most of the older girls. The

maximum of un-
clothedness and glitter
seems to be the goal
aimed at. Why a
young woman should
sing a moral ballad in
a lunatic dress that
would get her arrested
in the street is a
mystery.
Two boys got the
bird in an attempt to
sing what appeared to
be the Marseillaise,
it was the pre-ordained
result of one of them
having made up his
face with blood-red
stripes. Taken in con-
junction with his
clothes, which were
those in which he had
been doing his day’s
work, the stripes were
over the odds. His
companion fled, but
the other sang on, and
was beginning to gain
ground when the M.C.
ordered him to desist.
With a magnificent
gesture of repudiation
and contempt he retired, game to the last.
The sort of boy, this, that will get on in life, in
some line or other.

The Eigo Co. submitted the antique
tragedy of “Rigoietto” at the Princess’s
(Melb.) on Saturday; but excepting Filip-
pini, who was more at-home than he was
last week, none of the party seemed con-
scious participants in the dingy little drama
of anger, horror, and blood. There was
young Lois singing admirably, of course,
but avoiding the appearance of an abound-
ing profligate duke. He turned his gracious
facade to the audience whenever he could,
and with his paw on his breast he gave
the lovely “Questa o quella” and the tattered
“Donna e mobile” without suggesting that
the tunes were founded on the richest per-
sonal experience. This was not the com-
paratively vivid Lois who did Turiddu on
the previous Saturday, but rather a grave
young gentleman in whom long quiescent
Baptist principles had suddenly developed
to the detriment of sinful pleasures. Ger-
trude Johnson, as Gilda, can be excused
her incomplete impersonation on the ground
of dramatic immaturity. Musically she is
winsome and unaffected in her lower and
middle voices, but in following her Up to
the highest peak in her register one is
occasionally struck by the flatness of the
intervening scenery. Mosca, who doubled
Monterone and Sparafucile, has a bass that
seems to begin in the earth beneath, but
contains very little of the heavens above.
Indeed, it seems to gather in momentum and
unmelodiousness as it rushes upward to
publicity. liigoletto is evidently Filippini’s
favorite part. He sang it throughout with
unusual aplomb, and made it eventful on the
dramatic side. He was especially good in
his moments with Gilda, which he rendered
with the requisite Verdian pomposity.
Thelma Carter (Giovanna) and Leah Myers
(Maddalena) were equal to their share of
the music, and Barontini led a bunch of
courtiers who were always worth their place
in the proceedings. The c ly incongruous
note was achieved by John Crook (Count
Ceprano), whose few lines of English
sounded odd and awkward amid the Italian
of the others. Also two of the intervals
were unnecessarily tedious, and the furnish-
ing of the scenes was simple to the verge of
vacancy.

At the King’s (Melb.) “Jack and Jill” have
been ascending the hill in accordance with
the lines of rhyme which they suddenly re-
member in the middle of the show- The'inci-
dent, however, is not very important, and the
blessed little hill would be hardly worth
recalling if Barry Lupino and Bert Bailey
did not make it the venue of their most
protracted display of mutual assault and
aspersion. When Lupino has described
Bailey’s face and Bailey lias returned the
insult the hill has become quite an old
friend; and by the time the pair have
turned all the favorite gags into serial
stories, the eminence seems almost a pre-
historic feature whose legend goes back for
thousands of years.

Despite the allegation that places of en-
tertainment are the resort of ’flu, business con-
tinued brisk at all the Melbourne theatres.
At Her Majesty’s particularly the person
who was willing to risk a high temperature
and a backache to follow Goody Goody in-
visible adventure with a couple of small
shoes, seemed just as numerous as usual
on Saturday night. Nothing but straight
prohibition would keep some people away
from the panto. The Bulletin doesn’t need
that inducement to stay away; but this is
to be a peaceful paragraph, so one will re-
frain from mentioning names.
Enid Bennett was capturing Hoyt’s Mel-
bourne audiences early this week in'a special
circus picture, “The Biggest Show on
Earth.” Enid, more matured than when
Australia last saw her, seems good enough
in the narrative to adopt the title for an
alias. Youth has its fling in another Hoyt
feature, Sandy,” wherein Jack Bickford
and Louise Huff manage to bridge the gap
of their social dissimilarity and ask the
parson in. At the Lyceum Virginia Pearson
was making a massed attack on a misogy-
nist in All For a Husband.” Virginia is
the All of the title, and as she is the type
that keeps fashionable di(essmaker;s from
insolvency, she is a fascinating circumstance

Bairnsfather’s “Better ’Ole,” booked for
Melbourne Tivoli, makes its first appear-
ance (’flu walling) at the matinge next
Saturday. The management desires all
prospective customers to understand that
“this is the play, not the motion picture.”
Adelaide shows were lately waking up.
The Tivoli reopened with the same old fare
of Andersonian melodrama, played by a co.
headed by Roy Redgrave and Nellie Fergu-
son, with such old favorites as Cannam and
Stephenson, Marie Wilton and Maud Gold-
spink. At the Royal, Allen Doone put on

the public is large enough to support both.
“Yak”: The cinema has claimed for its
own many a London house formerly the
pride of the “legitimate” ; but at least two
former famous theatres which had been
dedicated to the movies are returning
to the old loves, owing to the shortage in
West End houses. These are'Terry’s, in the
Strand, and the Scala, in the wilds of Soho.
Ihe last generation knew the Scala as the
old Prince of Wales, where Marie Wilton
and Squire Bancroft made their stage repu-
tations, not to mention hatfuls of money.
The theatre had no luck after the Bancroft
regime, until a wealthy London medico, Dr.
Distin Mad-dick, who is widely known and
esteemed in greasepaint circles, bought, re-
built and re-named the house and endeavored
to restore its ancient glories. Owing to the
stand being off the beaten track the effort
tailed, and the screen presently replaced the
footlights. The most striking instance in
fjondon of the cinema ousting the older
entertainment is that of the London Opera
House, in Ivingsway. This expensively-
equipped house never caught on,as regards
the original idea, and Oscar Hammerstein
returned sorrowfully to N’York. Oswald
ptoll now runs the place as a cinema show-
house.
(ilen ITuntly”: Charley Lecocq, best
known here by “La Fille de Madame Angot,”
who died recently in Paris, made his debut
m company, with Bizet, of “Carmen” fame.
the ’fifties Offenbach, then manager of
the Bouffes Parisiens, offered a prize of
1850 francs for the best setting of a one-
act operetta, “Le Docteur Miracle.” There
were 78 competitors. Lecocq and Bizet
(who was 18 at the time! were a dead heat,
and their settings were played on alternate
nights in 1857. “Madame Angot” was first
produced at Brussels in 1872, and the first
London production took place in the follow-
ing year at the Islington Philharmonic. The
opera proved such a success that Hollings-
head secured it for the Gaiety, where Emily
Soldene scored a hit as Mdlle. Lange. Later,
when the show was transferred to the Opera
Comique, the business was enormous. It
was with this piece that the era of the 10s.
6d. stall was begun in London, seats being
booked at that price weeks ahead.
There was a remarkable cast of supers in
an “orchestral concert of humorous music”
lately given in London for the Red Cross.
It w r as not at all a collection of comic songs,
as might be supposed. Haydn’s Farewell
Symphony and Gounod’s Funeral March of
a Marionette being the superior style of
humor allowed by the rules. But in a Toy
symphony the extra parts were taken by
Ada Crossley and Albani as cuckoos, Haydn
Coffin and Cowen with rattles, and Mark
Hambourg and Frederick Bridge with cas-
tenets, while the great Elgar clashed the
cymbals.


THE DISTURBER.
The Supreme Council spent two hours and a half hearing the Dominion delegates' arguments for the retention of the german colonies. The opinion is freely expressd the
Dominion delegations that the proceedings were not characterised by an attempt to discover the truth or justice, but by a cold by a cold aloofness and indifference to the small nations' pleas. Mr. Lloyd
George and other British statesmen appear dissatisfied with Mr. Hughes’s statements.- Cable.

If a new decision holds this will be the last
time the Commercial Bank of Sydney will
issue accounts in January. For the future
the directors propose to meet shareholders
only after an annual balance at the end of
June. There is little or nothing to be said
against the new plan, and the staff at any
rate will find a good deal to say in favor of
abolishing the old practice of balancing in
the midst of the chief holiday season. Few
European banks report to their shareholders
oftener than once a year; and, seeifg that
they all have to submit quarterly averages,
there is even more to be said in favor of
the annual system in Australia, where
banking figures are influenced so largely by
once-a-year harvest results. Of course the
new plan will not prevent the payment of
dividends half-yearly. In fact, the Com-
mercial’s neighbor, the Wales, lately began
to divide its profits quarterly. Far more
important than the question of half-yearly
or yearly balances is that all banks should
balance on the same day. Through lack of
a law to that effect instances have been
known where two lame ducks have propped
up one another. They haven’t either of
them been stronger; they have only looked
stronger.
But shareholders in the Commercial of
Sydney will be less interested in the cutting
out of a meeting which very few of them
ever attended than in the directors’ announce-
ment of a pending issue of shares. The
present capital, all paid, is £2,000,000 in
160,000 shares of £l2 10s. It is proposed
to create 40,000 more “to be issued to
shareholders at par.” As the shares are
worth something over £24, the new issue
will represent a nice cash bonus- —or, in
the alternative, a nice gilt-edged 10 p.c.
investment. Well, fairly gilt-edged. Noth-
ing in these unquiet times is dead-sure —
except death. The Bolshevik will disappear ;
but the forces which have brought the Bol-
shevik to the surface have to be reckoned
with. Nobody knows how far they will drive.
They are quite respectable forces, some of
them. They have already given us the
Commonwealth Bank; and they are going
to make that bank a much bigger com-
petitor with these private banks than it is
even to-day. They don’t, by any means,
call themselves Bolshies who support that
policy of extension. Acting-Prime Minister
Watt, for example, has just made a proposal
to the States that the Commonwealth Bank
should take over the Stpte Savings Banks,
on the highly questionable condition that
the bank should hand over to the States
(that is. the State Treasurers) 75 p.c. of
the increased deposits. Further: —
If the. Savings Bank business was amalgamated there
should be co-operation also between the Common-
wealth and the States in relation to the whole of
the business of banking. It was therefore proposed
that all State banking business in Australia and
abroad, and the flotation of State loans, as well as
payment of interest and flotation exes., should be
entrusted to the Commonwealth Bank.
Whether this particular scheme is adopted
or not this Commonwealth Bank is going
very soon to have a very large capital, made
out of handling loans and so on; it will be
under no obligation to earn dividends, be-
cause it will have no shareholders; and its
benefits to the community will be gauged
very largely by its liberal treatment of the
individuals. It is a competitor which the
banking investor has to take into account.
Just for the present, no doubt, it is con-
trolled by men who have been*brought up in
the atmosphere of private banks and more or
less venerate them or some of them; but it
will be controlled in time to come by men
who have grown up in its own atmosphere.
And that may make a lot of difference.
If the future of the Commercial of Sydney
is anything like the past shareholders will
have nothing to complain about. This
shows, first, how the capital has been in-
creased :

1849 .. 90,000 1893 .. 1,000,000
1853 .. 200,000 1907 .. 1,250,000

1874 . . 500,0.00 1914 .. 2,000,000
The 1907 issue was at £2 10s. premium.
Apparently all the others have been at'par.
For many years down to 1892 the dividend
was 25 p.c. In the next eight years the
bank was repairing the damage done in the
boom .smash, and meantime slowly improv-
ing tfie dividend to 10 p.c. ; and that rate-
very reasonable considering the size of the
shareholders’ undivided profits—has been
maintained ever since.
Apart from £1,966,719 lent to customers
to take up war loans, there have been
no movements calling for notice during the
past year. This comparison goes back to just
the other side of the war:—

Debts to the public total £25,773.050. More
than half of that is held liquid. The bank’s
own funds represent £1 for every £7 of
the public’s. Those two facts, taken together,
indicate a very strong position. And now
from the public’s point of view it is to be
further strengthened by the issue of capital.
From a w T ell-known Laborite :—■
I was interested in the remarks of “Ex-Banker”
(B. 9/l/’l9) regarding banking amalgamations, and
his suggestion that three specified banks should join
and take advantage of the new financial era that is
approaching. But “Ex-B.” surely does not think
that Private Enterprisers going to be permitted to
collect “every pound of new profit.” Nationalisation is
in the air, and the people are beginning to think that
the time is ripe for some reduction in the profits
of private banking institutions. The figures quoted
by “Ex-B.” are indeed illuminating. The paid-up
capital of the three banks referred to totals
£3,176,700 ; yet a sum of £18,420,317 has been
lent to customers and invested in Government securi-
ties. These banks have been able to lend this
amount out of the £20,000,000 deposited by the
public, a proportion only of which is interest-
bearing, the rate of interest being about half what
the banks get for the money. These facts have
not been lost sight of by Labor, nor have the lessons
taught by the war been forgotten. If £80,000,000 a
year can be raised for war purposes, a similar sum
can and will be raised for development. It is all
a matter of credit, and the credit of the Common-
wealth will stand the raising of further large loans
for railways and irrigation schemes. If the money
is not made available, the provisions of a Compul-
sory Loan Act will be resorted to. If £200,000,000
can be raisfed and spent without any assets to show
for it, then surely a like amount can be spent
when the spending will result in the creation of
assets to the value thereof. Nationalisation of bank-
ing is a plank of the Federal Labor platform, and
when the party comes into its own an endeavor will
be made to give legislative effect to the proposal.
No doubt some so-called financial experts will point
out the impracticability of making banking a Gov-
ernment monopoly, and stress the point that the
necessary money could not be obtained for the pur-
pose. But if there is only one bank in Australia,
all money will have to be deposited in it, or else
in a hollow log. Confiscation is not intended, and
the holders of shares in the various banking institu-
tions will be credited with the face value of same
in the books of the Commonwealth Bank, the whole
transaction being merely a bookkeeping entry. The
shareholders of the private banks will thus have
their capital to invest in other concerns, but will
not be permitted to take it out of Australia. The
export of gold will be prohibited as it was during
the war, Labor thus following the precedent created
by the present National Government, which would not
allow capital to flee from the country. The natural
corollary of this prohibition is an alteration of the
tariff, so as to ensure that the value of the exports
will exceed the value of the imports, and thus pay
our outside obligations in goods. The foregoing is
Labor’s proposal regarding the future era of banking,
and “Ex-Banker” and his friends will be wise if
they make the necessary preparations for the deliver-
ance of their swan-song at an early date.
To refer now to only one point—the alleged
intention of Labor to pay only face value
for shares. What about undivided profits?
If a farmer buys a farm and, instead of
spending all his earnings, uses one-half of
them to improve the farm, would this
Laborite say that the State should have the
right to expropriate the farmer by paying
him just what he had paid and no more?
Or that a worker shouldn’t have the right
to recover any wages he had left with his
employer?

Of that amount £13,973 has been transferred
to tlie renewals reserve, £2034 to the sink-
ing fund, and £2254 has been utilised for
loan repayments. That left a net surplus of
only £2284. Two of the lines operated by
the Trust —-the Whiteliorse-road extension
and the Burke-road extension—showed a
loss of £2374 arid £1481) respectively. The
former loss is met by the Camberwell muni-
cipality and the latter by four local govern-
ing bodies. Adding these amounts, there
was thus £0147 to be distributed among
six constituent councils of the Trust and
the City of Melbourne. There’s nothing-
very fat about the enterprise, and the Trust
aid well to show a surplus at all in view of
the increased wages bill' (including £0321
retrospective pay) and the heavy cost of
supplies. This was met by abolishing over-
lapping sections and increasing Sunday and
certain holiday fares —the latter bringing in
£8S1)0, though the Trust admits that the
effect was to lose a number of passengers.

Shareholders got S p.c. by way of dividend
and a further 6 p.c. as a bonus—all free of
income tax. And after writing £25,000 off
premises there still remained profit to
strengthen the reserves equal to a shade
over 6 p.c. on the paid capital. You would
assume that the nice, old gentlemen who
collect their divs. in London would be per-
fectly satisfied to see their money earning
a net profit of something over 20 p.c. Not
at all. There were wails at the share-
holders’ meeting to the effect that the
British and Australasian tax collectors
were grabbing twice as much as share-
holders were receiving in divs., and that
“it was not encouraging for the people who
invested in cos. of this description” to be
“nenalised” in this way—sentiments which
the old gentlemen who had pocketed their
14 p.c. heartily applauded.
The taxes paid by Dalgety’s in England
and Australasia serve very well to illus-
trate liow hesitant local war finance has
been:—

1917 . . 175,710 62,767 238,477
1918 .. 126,457 116,918 243,375
The English taxes for the past year were
about the same as for the previous year,
for £20,001) odd of the 1017 collection was
returned when the British Government de-
cided to oblige by lightening the double-
taxation burden. Just prior to the war the
Australasian Treasurers were getting more
than the British Exchequer. But Britain
decided to meet its war expenditure in a
business-like way and pay a fair propor-
tion out of revenue. The Australian mud-
dlers decided to let the bill mount up and
present it to the unborn. Thus in the past
five years British taxes have amounted to
£375,120, and Australasian £228,046, and
over half the local amount was handed over
during the past twelve months.
The war years proved wonderfully profit-
able for Dalgety’s. Compare some of the
aggregate figures of the past four years
with those for the previous four terms: —
4 yrs. to 1914. 4 yrs. to 1918.

The directors talk of the “many disadvan-
tages under which we have to conduct our
business,” and are hoping for the time when
the Governments withdraw their control of
various products. But though red-tape
may have got Dalgety’s orderly business
tangled here and there, Government control
has been very kind—even if only for the
reason that during the war the co. was
allowed to make bigger profits than ever
before. In some respects the Government
interference was a decided blessing—par-
ticularly when it gave Dalgety’s a monopoly
of portion of the metal business. The fact
that the Governments financed the various
pools when products could not be shipped
must have been a great relief to this and
other such cos. With the world’s markets
closed to Australian produce (solely be-
cause we had no ships of our own) the
position would have .been decidedly un-
comfortable if the State cash-box had not
been made available and relieved the cos.
of practically every penny of risk. The
effect of this Government control, aided by
the high prices paid by the British Govern-
ment for some of our staples, is shown in
this comparison of the balance-sheet figures:

Thus during the past four years the deben-
ture debt has been reduced by £117,884 and
other liabilities by £720,637. Meantime
cash, War Loan and other gilded stock has
increased by £851,324, £99,331 has been
added to other more or less liquid assets,
while advances, etc., have been reduced by
£1,247,294. Though the reduction in advan-
ces has curtailed one source of profit, it
would be a very dull crowd of shareholders
who could not see the advantages of having
a co.’s finances strengthened in this way at
a time when the future was full of doubt.
The premises item is one which is utilised
to carry inner reserves. A further £25,000
is being written off the figures shown in
the table, and that is quite apart from the
£11,893 depreciation charged direct against
the P. and L. account. The Australasian
premises now appear in the balance-sheet
at considerably less than half their cost.

Gundagai Long Tunnel (N.S.W.) is still
the butt of the bears, and the market refuses
to be consoled by John Allen’s report. He
was the mine-manager who sampled the
show for an English crowd some years ago,
and when the market collapsed the other day
the directors called him in. Allen says he
passed the rich chutes by and took 16
samples of 201 b. each across the lode from
between the No. 3 and tunnel levels, and
that the assay gave an average of 17dwt. 13gr.
per ton. At the No. 1 level he figures 2600
tons ot “good ore,” and further states
that “there are some thousands of tons in
sight, and a good average result should be
kept up by careful blending.” He sums' up:
“I am confidant and have no hesitation in
saying that the mine is a valuable one under
good management.” Incidentally, Allen
reckons that 14dwt. “should give regular
divs.” While Allen’s report may provide
some comfort for shareholders, Mines Dept.
Harper’s cheerless words leave the position
unsatisfactory. The directors allege that
Harper was misled in his investigations, and
that he had about as much chance of finding
colors in a Sydney street as along the con-
tact zone on the surface at Gundagai. But
this doesn’t dispel the doubts. Meantime
the argument is left to manager Hepburn
and the battery. The clean-up is at the end
of the month.
Bodangora (N.S.W.) is to be sold up
after having crushed 26,630 tons. Not a
cent will have come back unless the liquida-
tion div. turns out a sprat or two and the
sands and slimes yield a crumb. The ore
is complex, but with 21s. per ton to work on
in the tailings some profit ought to flow out
of the vats. What has killed this fledgling
from Teddy Dyason’s nest has been high
costs, narrow veins and short shoots. The
co. lost £1427 on working account last half
year, and that has decided the crowd to put
the brakes on till the chemist tells them
their fate over the treatment of the sands.

Good values continue to be got out of the
old Sunny Corner silver mine in the Bath-
urst (N.S.W.) district .by W, R. Wilkinson
and party. The stone being sent to the
coast for treatment is worth from £7 to
£lO a ton, but smelting charges reduce re-
turns to such an extent that Wilkinson is
hungering for a complete treatment plant.
There is a small reverb, furnace already on
the premises, and this is handling about
half of the output. The main working face
is now about 1200 ft. in from the shaft.

A Sydney syndicate has taken an option
over the bismuth show at Duckmaloi, near
Oberon (N.S.W.), held by Alexander Riddel
and Son, who have been sending away small
parcels of concentrates obtained by primitive
processes. The deposit is in the nature of
a contact formation, and the stone is easily
broken in open cuts. Riddel has been able
to turn out £lOO worth of bismuth a month
for the past year. The ore averages from
£4 to £4 10s., and there is said to be much
of this grade of stuff in sight.
N. S. Wales Mines Department has turned
down an application for the conversion
of certain special leases on the old Lead-
ville field into conditional purchases on the
ground that things thereabouts are likely to
look up. The Mt. Stewart and Mt. Scott
mines contain large tonnages of sulphides.
Under-Secretary Cambage points out that
sulphur deposits are scarce in the Ma State,
and also mentions the possibility of the two
shows being handled for their lead and zinc.
But wmrk would have to be on an extensive
scale for profits to show up.

The old Lucknow field (N.S.W.) may be
revived by the new Mining Act, with the
help of modern processes. The tailings that
have remained untouched ever since they
were dumped on private lands are to be
treated, J. S. Gordon and N. C. Selae hav-
ing been given a title over the property by
the warden.

Two voices speak for Loch Fyne, Matlock
(Vic.). One is John Friel, of mountain
fame; the other, legal-manager James Mac-
kay. Friel considers prospects assured. This
must be on the strength of a shoot of stone
proved to be 150 ft. long varying in width
from 2 to 7ft. and averaging 12 to 15dwt.
He has two reefs in the level unprospected,
and counts on picking up something worth
while in the south end of the mine below
where Tricks’s crowd broke out rich stone
in the good old days. But all that is still in
the air. Mackay comes forth with the
opinion that the floors of quartz live to any
depth, as their walls are as firm and as hard
as granite. If they are “floors,” how can
they extend to great depth unless tilted on
edge? Anyway, two sixpenny calls are
reckoned to be all that is needed to set Loch
Fyne profit-earning. With Scotch care
Mackay keeps the co. out of debt, save for
a liability of £2OOO to be liquidated by a
charge of 5 p.c. on the gross value of gold
won. As the battery is to drop on to some
of Freil’s 150 ft. shoot pretty soon, the debt
ought soon to be wiped off the slate.
When Tyrconnel North went to Queens-
land it burst. Repaired, it wheezed to
Westralia. Burst again, it returned to Alec
Peacock’s office; and now it is off to Black-
wood (Vic.). This is a has-been field of short
shoots and long memories, amid which
Tyrconnel North hopes to find a happy
abiding place. The present idea is to ex-
tend the old tunnel beyond 2400 ft. to catch,
if possible, the downward continuation of
the shoots of gold on which the field had
a boom thirty years back. The chief pro-
ducer then was the Sultan, which having
the run of five reefs, got out 24 tons of gold.
Not a bad record by any means, especially
as a quarter of a million of profit came
out of the 750 ft. level. So the Tyrconnel
North looks to be on a good wicket if the
old-’uns didn’t do what they almost invari-
ably did—sucked the orange so dry that
even pips weren’t left behind. _ Still in the
adit the Tyrconnel has cut a sft. formation
on which it is hustling north to see if some
of the old shoots pitch down to the tunnel
level. Of course, it’s a gamble, but the
chance is there; and, as it costs only a few
pounds monthly to keep going, not much
harm will be done even if nothing is got..

J. B. Lewis’s report on Mt. Murphy, the
wolfram-molybdenite show up in the snow-
clad Benambra recesses of the Alps (Vic.),
counts up 11 lodes living on the granite
contact with the slates. No. 2 level has
been put in to get the lens 100 ft. further
down. So far, work at this point has
brought to light three other shoots. Still,
as only scratching has been done about the
place by little parties during the war, all
the co. can show are prospects. So Lewis
won’t testify to ore contents or to ore
proved ; but he does declare that if handled
“with boldness and judgment” Mt. Murphy
should be a permanent producer of consider-
able quantities of wolfram. The co. has
used up all its available cash, and is out to
float off a block of unissued shares.
* * * *
“O.B.”: One thing is certain if the gold
industry in the West is to be buoyed up:
many more men will have to be put into
the field and kept there. Circumscribe the
prospector by all sorts of conditions and
expenses, as at present, and there is very
little inducement for the pioneer. In the
U.S.A. a prospector can hold a lease on
24 days’ work per annum, and after five
years can get the fee simple. There are no
rents to pay, five years are allowed to get
a lease surveyed, and if the holder wants
to hire his own surveyor he can do so pro-
vided his choice is licensed by the Govern-
ment. Survey fees are nominal. The result,
is that nearly every miner there either owns
a mine or is looking for one, whereas in
the West there are thousands of reefs with-
out owners. At the same time the Govern-
ment would have to be careful before giving
up the fee simple to anyone. In England
the metals belonged to the landlords, and
the effect in Cornwall was described by a
Bulletin man some years ago: with
tin standing at about £2OO a ton, there were
ten times as many mines shut down as there
were working. A system of long leasehold
with nominal rental in the case of working
prospectors, and absolute forfeiture in the
case of dummying, would probably meet the
case in Westralia.

From Greenbushes (W.A.) : The tin-pro-
ducers here are in a very rebellious mood.
There is little or no sale for their product
in Australia, and America has prohibited
its import since November. There is a
market in Britain, but the Federal Govern-
ment won’t, or can’t, provide any shipping
space, and up till now (January IS) won’t
say when any is likely to be available.
* * * *
An old prospector and former member of
the State Parliament named Isdell asserts
that in country beyond the Murchison
(W.A.) there are any number of lodes
from 5 to 15dwt. But nothing less than
2 to 3oz. pays a prospector to work, as
there is no battery within a day’s walk and
cartage rates are sky-high. Big reefs that
would pay to work on a large scale abound
in the locality, he says, but poor men can-
not open them up and develop them without
the assistance of capital. Some who have
hung on are living on salted kangaroo and
damper.
* * * *
At Cue (W.A.) about a month ago Gt.
Fingall was recommended exemption, but
in order to give the local miners’ union and
other objectors a chance to be heard the
Minister ordered a rehearing of the ap-
plication. This took place the other day,
when, on the co. agreeing to throw open the
'ground to tributors, six months’ respite
from labor conditions was granted. During
the hearing it transpired that when the
mine was shut down last year after pro-
ducing nearly £5,000,000 worth of gold and
paying If millions sterling in divs., the co.
owed the Government between £BOOO and
£9OOO on account of advances. However,
the debt has since been paid off.
North Kalgurli (W.A.) held a meeting m
London recently. After announcing that
the co. had £5OOO invested and £6OOO in
cash the chairman said he wanted the meet-
ing to decide whether the Board should sell
the property, which, though it had produced
nearly half a million sterling, has given
shareholders nothing. As an alternative, it
was suggested that some money might be
spent in boring, in the hope of picking up
the continuation of a rich shoot now being
worked just across the boundary in As-
sociated Northern. After an animated dis-
cussion it was decided to give the directors
a free hand. But if a satisfactory offer is
made for the show it will probably be
accepted. v
Meekatharra (W.A.) is now supported by
four props. One, the Fenian, has yielded
nearly a million sterling, of which about
half has been paid to the small local syndi-
cate which owns it. The second, Ingliston
Extended, has produced several hundred
thousand pounds worth of gold and has dis-
tributed among its owners, also mostly local
people, a number of good dividends. The
third, the Gwaiia, has yielded- over £33,000
worth of gold in the past 12 months and
is still going strong, while from the
fourth, the Ingliston, some splendid crush-
ings have been obtained. The district con-
tains also the remains of the Queen of the
Hills, formerly worked by the Lake View
and Oroya crowd, the Ingliston Extended
the old Commodore, Kyarra and other de-
funct shows.
* * * *
Kalgoorlie casts envious eyes on some of
its tributors. Those on the old Associated
Northern have got gold valued at £11,523, of
which the co.’s cut was £2291. Tributors on
the Associated have not yet announced the
value of their return, but seeing that they
paid just under £lOOO in royalty it must have
been good. The royalty collected from tribu-
tors on Lake View amounted to about £4OO,
and several on the Perseverance have done
well. Of course there are some who are
getting very little.
* * * *
“Edo”: Managers on Kalgoorlie’s Golden
Mile are letting further slices of their
properties on tribute. High costs are not
the only factor. The union bosses are not
only continually demanding more pay and
encouraging men to go slow, but in other
respects the union bosses are really the
managers. The co.’s representative finds
that he can only distantly indicate how
things might be done. All details are
decided bv the union boss. To meet the
position, the managers are trying a middle
course by letting the unionists work things
their own way in sections. The result must
be a lot of pig rooting and much disappoint-
ment to many toilers, because all cannot
make wages. But, as a manager pathetically
put it the other day, “What else can I do?
The alleged toilers want more money than
they can produce. If I have a narrow body
of good stuff and let a contract, the con-
tractors, who are paid on a tonnage basis,
take out too much waste and I’m in trouble.
If, on the other lidnd, I put on wages men,
they slow down.”
* -* # *
Mt. Elliott (Q.) has blown- in? its big fur-
nace again. The co. has been off file dividend
list during the war, mainly due to inter-
mittent smelting, alterations to plant, and
high labor costs. Prospects at this co.’s big
mines, the Consols, the Gt. Australia and
Mt. Oxide, are good, but unfortunately the
last-named show is 80 miles from the rail-
head. A scheme has been outlined to es-
tablish treatment works at Cloncurry, the
enormous calcite lode, averaging 2 to 3 p.c.
copper, at the Gt. Australia forming a
natural fluxing base. Elliott’s annual
accounts have made dismal reading, and
something must be done to save the co.
from disaster.
A Melbom'ne crowd has acquired the
Heemskirk tin leases, on the Speck’s west
coast, and a co. is being formed to provide
equipment. J. B. Lewis, in a report, refers
to the size and number of the lodes outcrop-
ping on the property. With a plentiful
water supply and working on the open-cut
system low costs are anticipated.
* * * *
“R.H.”: It is an open secret amongst the
Wheat Scrip fraternity that the bears have
heavily short sold, and all sorts of yarns are
being put around to get holders to unload.
Though it is well known that the B pool
has been shockingly mismanaged, it is cer-
tain to pan out much better than “Blue-
stone” predicted (B. 5/12/T8). One has
only to refer to the pamphlet recently issued
by the Australian Wheat Board to show
that this is correct. Anyhow, notwithstand-
ing the. bears’ amusing attempts to belittle
Australian wheat values Norway’s purchase
of almost two million bushels at ss. Bd., to
be carried in her own ships, proves that
Australian wheat at ss. Bd. is the cheapest
in the world.
* * * *
“Pay Clerk”: Another needless joy-ride
to London is foreshadowed, this time for
Macpherson, Treasurer of Vic. A loan of
£4,000.000 falls due next October. Well,
what is Agent-General Peter Macßride do-
ing about it? Surely he knows the current
rate of interest for conversion loans. If not,
he has only to telephone Nivison, the stock-
broker, who has floated Australian, Canadian
and Indian Government loans for the past
30 years. As a check on Nivison, Macßride
might also ask the London and Westminster
Bank, which has handled every one of Vic.’s
loans since 1855. There are lots of people
from whom good advice may be had for
nothing, such as the Governor of the Bank
of England, the chairman of Dalgety and
Co. and the chairman of the London Stock
Exchange. MacPherson would have to ask
their opinions and act on them. Surely the
Agent-General is paid to do such work.

OLD AND NEW INDUSTRIES.
The new departure, which under pressure
of war necessities, converted a portion of
Cadbury’s works at Bournville into a fruit
and vegetable drying establishment, is likely
to remain a permanent industry of the Com-
pany, but not at Bournville. The Bourn-
ville works will remain cocoa and chocolate
works, and the newer industry will be
domociled at Badsey, in the Valley of the
Avon, where it is already in operation.
In addition there are the Knighton (Staf-
fordshire) and Frampton (Gloucestershire)
Milk Works, devoted to the preparation of
milk for Cadbury’s Milk Chocolate purposes.
Both of these factories are situated in dis-
tricts noted for high-class milk production.
Touching the farming community at so
many points, Cadbury’s are issuing a maga-
zine called Farm and Factory, devoted to
milk production and fruit and vegetable
growing in relation to food manufactures. lt
deals also w'ith sugar beet cultivation, which
is another of the war’s addition to the in-
dustries of Great Britain. Farm and
Factory, as regards its object, is co-oper-
ative in all functions in which the farmer
and the firm, as manufacturers, are mutu-
ally concerned. The tendency of the time
is towards the elimination of the middlemen ;
so the manufacturer goes to the farmer’s
gate to pick up his produce at first hand, to
the advantage of both, and not less that of
the community for which both are catering.
The war is now over, but time must elapse
before Britain can accumulate stocks, and
factories get into their stride again. No
undue time will be lost in restoring Bourn-
ville and Cadbury’s Cocoas and Chocolates
to their old places of honor in the shops
again.— Adyt.

“D.F.”: History-books and other alleged
authorities still say that the Hentys were
the pioneers of Portland and the first set-
tlers in Victoria. None of them seems to
have heard of John Griffiths, a Parramatta
man who went into the shipbuilding business
at Launceston (Tas.) and opened up trade
with Portland years before the Hentys
heard of it. From 1829 onwards his schoon-
ers were trading to Portland for seal-skins,
kangaroo-skins and whale-oil. In 1832 he
set up a whaling-station at Portland. He
went over himself,
built a house there,
and, according to the
family tradition, had
his wife and children
there. This station
was going strong with
William Dutton in
charge when the
Hentys first arrived
in 1834. Mrs. Scott,
a daughter of John
Griffiths, died in Mel-
bourne last year, and
a daughter of Captain
Campbell, who com-
ma nd e d one of bis
schooners in the old
days, is still living in
Victoria.

There are 23 survivors of the 50 delegates
to the third session of the Federal Conven-
tion which fixed up the Constitution at Mel-
bourne from January 20 to March 17 just
21 years ago. They are: N. S. Wales—
Barton, Carruthers, McMillan and Walker;
Victoria —Deakin, Fraser, Higgins, Isaacs,
Peacock, Quick and Trenwith; S. Aus. —
Cockburn. Glynn, Gordon, Howe and Symon ;
Tas. —Clarke, Fysh and Lewis; Westralia —
Walter James, Briggs, Loton and Henning.
Jack Fitzgerald, N. S. Wales Minister
for Health, has just got word that the
French Republic has decorated him with the
cross of Officer of the Legion of Honor. It
is not exactly the sort of honor he
originally hoped to attain to ; but it is the
sort that fits him like a glove.
A recently-cabled list of arrived-in-Eng-
land soldiers gives the name of L. Hubbard,
of Hobart, “previously reported prisoner of
war.” It is surmised that this Digger is
the Tasmanian crack rifleman, Leonard Hub-
bard, whose persistence eventually, after
three years’ effort, overcame the military
authorities’ objection to accept for service
abroad a man with
only one eye, and
landed him in France
last March. In Sep-
tember he accom-
nanied British troops
to Russia, and was
last heard of from
Archangel. In his
pre-Australian days
Hubbard spent some
years in Ivan’s coun-
try and learnt the
language. Prior to
his enlistment (home
service was as far as
he could get for a
year or more) he
was s u b-editing
Hobart Daily Post
(now the World),
and the ink-stained
old white coat in
which he cut a figure
at Bisley in 1918
still hangs in the
sub-editorial kennel
of that paper.
Governor Galway
(S.A-) is one of the
rare instances of a
Governor staying
longer than he has
to : his five years will
be up in April, and
he has accepted an
extension for another
year. Galway (who
spelt his name “Gall-
wey” till just before
he came this way)
is a soldier who saw
a lot of service. in
Africa; and after-
wards was Governor
of St. Helena and of
bits of the mainland'
He probably knows more citizens of S.A.
personally than did any of his predecessors;
his participation in all kinds of games takes
him quite outside the official set.
The recollections of “Furness Born :
Recently-deceased John Plumper Iloolan never
received half enough credit for all the devil and
wit and courage and originality that was in him.
John, took to the Queensland Labor Party, not be-
cause he wanted an easy, job as jaw-warrior like many
of its impecunious aspirants, but because the Labor
Party in his day was the under-dog, and the under-
dog was always sure of John for a champion. In
the same way he took to Glassey, who in those days
was a lone Labor crusader fighting valiantly against
a horde of Tory bigots and black laborites. “I
saw Tom Glassey fighting all alone,” he said, “and
I reckoned it was time he had a mate.” And
Glassey had a mate forthwith and a staunch one.
When Hoolan acted as Leader of his party for some
time he distinguished himself by his vigor in fight
and his tact in managing the crowd. But in one
respect he failed. He had no time for the local
Trades Hall and its meddling engineers and con-
sequently incurred their bitter animosity. That
was only natural, for a party man, in the strict
sense of the word, Hoolan never was. “I am the
wild unbroken warrigal down from the hills,” he
once boasted, “and the yard was never yet built
that could hold me in.” And that was the neatest
and most truthful summary ever made of John
Plumper Hoolan.
Credited with a century on January 9,
John Clifford, of Priory (Tas.). He came
to Y.D.L. in 1837. On the voyage from
England he was shipwrecked* and with
others drifted on a raft to the shores of
S. Africa. He probably holds a world’s
record- —fifty-eight great-grandchildren and
two great-great-grandchildren.
Arthur Blakeley, who defeated veteran
Frank Lundie, of Adelaide, for the general
presidency of the A.W.U., is only 33. Eight
years ago he was shearing; since then he
has become successively organiser, union sec.,
M.H.R. and general president of Austra-
lia’s biggest union. At the 1916 Labor
conference he took a leading part in cen-
suring Holman for failing to take steps
to abolish the Upper House, and was
deputed by the “secret junta” to reply to
Holman’s speech in his defence. The new
man will have his work cut out in presiding
at the convention now sitting, as storms
are certain to arise when the time comes
for the A.W.U to define its attitude towards
the One Big Union scheme of Judd and his
friends. The A.W-U. has its own scheme,
consisting of the swallowing of the smaller
unions. Blakeley now holds old-man
Spence’s late jobs in both the political and
industrial fields, i.e., M.H.R. for the Dar-
ling and general president of the A.W.U.
The war has treated ex-Senator Arthur
Rae very badly. The splendid little Labor
battler received news last week of the death
of his son Donald in Scotland, where he
had gone on furlough after being a prisoner
in Germany for about 12 months. Another
son—the eldest—was killed about lour
months ago.
THE INTERNATIONAL.
THE WICKETKEEPER: “Now, I wonder how
many this fellow is going to score before
we get him out?"
David McKenzie, one of the first settlers
on the west coast of S. Aus., died last
month. When he landed at Franklin Harbor
59 years ago there were only three white
men on that coast,- though the mallee was
thick with none-too-friendly Binghis. Mails
at that time were received twice a year, and
food supplies to last for a year were taken
by a sailing-vessel which called for wool
McKenzie grew the first wheat in the Frank-
lin Harbor district, imported the first reaper
and winnower, and from 1899 to 1905 re-
presented Flinders in the Assembly.
“Nemo”: “Teddy” Mulcahy, of Hobart,
elected by the Speck’s Parliament to the
Senate, vice Long resigned, is a versatile
fellow; he can set up printer’s type, work
as a blacksmith, is an expert in wool, con-
ducts a church choir, sings a good song and
plays the fiddle. At Mr. Roper’s school in
Hobart he had for school-fellow E. W.
O’Sullivan, afterwards N. S. Wales Works
Minister, and in 1864 the two worked as
“comps.” on the Hobart newspapers of the
day—the Mercury and the Advertiser.
Edward Hams, of Terowie (S.A.), who
reached Australia in 1848, celebrated the
65th anniversary of his wedding recently.
They are well-preserved Hams: the years
of parents and their children living total

Frank Gallin, of South Fremantle, is
the first blind boy in Westralia to gain a
diploma as Associate of the London College
of Music. He is 19, and Robert Jackson,
of Fremantle, is his teacher.
Young Vernon A. D. Sturdee has come
back a lieut.-colonel and a D. 5.0., after
holding the position of second general staff
officer to Douglas Haig for some time. He
was at the landing and the evacuation, and
in France took over the command of the
engineers of the sth Division. Then the
big chance came and Birdwood recommended
him for G.H.Q. staff, where his work won
recognition. A son of Colonel A. H.
Sturdee, Principal Medical Officer for Vic-
toria, the Chuirch of England Grammar
started him out on his career.
Sailors the world over will regret the
death of Agnes Weston, which occurred re-
cently in the Sailors’ Rest at Devonport
(Eng.). This great worker (they made her
Dame before she died) toiled for 50 years
for the welfare of the seamen, and that
splendid Australian, the late J. S. Shears-
ton, followed as closely as he could upon
her lines.
Streeton won the honors at a recent
London show of the work of “colonial"
artists. Lambert had good work there, for
he is a very fine draughtsman; but
Streeton’s war pictures were, in the words of
the Times, “immeasurably better than those
of his comrades.”
Justice Pring (N.S.W.), who had a
birthday last week, is 66. He is native-
born —came from near Wagga (N.S.W.)
and his austerity has been a feature of the
Bench for 17 years.
Another noted Cornishman, who came to
Australia in 1851, P. B. Eddy, of Eddy
Park, Havilah, and Albion Park, has had a
funeral. He was half owner of the famous
old claims Gem and Albion at Stannifer,
and was 81 when the book closed.
Paid the final account at Iverang (Vic.),
William John Davey, proprietor of the
Iverang Observer. In 1877, in conjunction
with the late J. M. Harcourt, he founded the
district’s first paper, the Kerang Times.
Harcourt at that time was also owner of
the Bendigo Evening News —at one time
the only ha’-penny paper in Australia. In
’B5 the firm dissolved, and Davey launched
the Observer, lie slid off at 78. A son, a
lieutenant, fell at the Landing.
Dead at 62, F. W. Cross, a well-known
Brisbane identity, who for years had a hand
in running the old Gaiety Theatre. The
best shows Queensland saw then were
brought by the Gaiety people. Later Cross
went into business as a partner of .T. 11.
Dickson and still later managed the. Silver-
wood Dairy Co. His father was Joe Cross,
who once ran the Paddington Times, in
Sydney. Zora Cross is his daughter; and
two of his sons fought in the great war —
one to give his life; the other to return
wounded with the Military Medal.
“Horatio” calls for a halo: —
A. G. Mackay, a Wanganui (M.L.) metaphysician,
was engaged by the local authorities to assist in the
fight when the epidemic was at the height of its
virulence, and he was given an almost entirely

111 cases, visiting twice daily the severe ones; three
only became serious enough to warrant removal to
hospital, and of the whole 111 not one died. Con-
sidering that 112 persons died in Wanganui during
the month of the visitation Mackay is entitled to
wear a larger hat. He had a suspicion that the
microbe was one of the Hun variety that wanted
the world to accept it at its own valuation, and
he refused to do that. His methods were chiefly:
(1) Get to bed; (2) cut out all solids and any
liquids likely to send the temperature aeroplaning;
and (3) BUCK UP! Mackay moves round telling
funny stories; a week after you are out of danger
he pops in casually just to tell you that you were
two inches off Eternity the day you laughed the
loudest.

CWYDIR BILL TO SUBIACO GEORGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Much indignation is expressed at Senator. Pearce’s
holiday to England with his retinue.
Mr. Webster says that the public attitude helps
Bolshevism.
—Two news items.
Ho! never mind, George! Let the ’oi polloi
Bray til! they bust themselves with spleen and
stress;
Jus’ you go off to Inglan’, dear ole boy,
An’ learn my Ode unto Officiousness.
Don’t notice these ’ere public frowns an’ scowls—
An' drink ’ot water to assist yer bow’ls.
Mo. comrade! No! ’twas in another sphere
Of public life that blessed word we spoke.
Not even “brother” is the language ’ere,
Since first the bloomin’ Labor ranks we broke.
But “George” will do—me pal, George Foster
Pearce —•
If I was you I’d arnsee something fierce.
“Effishency's” the word! Bear that in mind,
An’ if you want a joy-ride, ’ave one, George;
They make a fuss, but bless yer, they’re resigned !
We done our w’ack in shearin’ shed an’ forge.
You go, George Foster Pearce, an’ let the flood
Bust after. They don’t rcely want yer blood.
Your enemies are only soldiers, George; and mine
Are only poets livin’ on the game;
They ’ate to see me writin’ ’art' a line,
An’ call me “blackleg”—once a word of shame.
Don’t mine ’em, George; soldiers and poets are
Naeherly envious of a brighter star.
“Effishency’s” the word, so do it well;
There ain’t much time before we’re called to die.
Spare no expense like any tourin’ swell—
It ain’t your coin an’ notes that’s goin to fly.
Your motter’s “Do It Well!” an’ damn their scowls—
An’ always drink ’ot water for yer bow’ls.

LADY : “ And so you saved the life of one of
your officers? You must have been very
devoted to him."
BILLJIM : “Oh, I dunno. Y’ see, 'e'd pro-
mised me a good job after the war.”
“Camelero” : This showed better one side
of Bill jini’s character than any other inci-
dent I know. When a picked German unit
was brought from the Western Front to push
our men back from the Jordan Valley, it
was found after the Hun had failed that a
Lighthorseman had worked the machine-gun
of a dead comrade and singlehanded had held
up the enemy’s advance on one of the flanks.
After the fight the gun was found deserted
with about 60 dead Huns m front ot it.
In the dark the Digger had returned to
his unit, and, despite the efforts of officers to
ascertain the bloke’s name, he refused to step
forward and reveal himself. There s a
D.C.M. waiting for the chap who was behind
that gun if he will step out, said the
O.C. When I left the Jordan they were stilt
looking for him.
*** * t
“Kopai”: It happened at a speech-night
the annual occasion when the head-mistress
read out to 2000 admiring people the roll-
ing periods of the school report. And ttiej
did roll —they made Cicero a back numbei
and Demosthenes a South-street elocution-
ist. They were beauteous, erudite, scented
with the sweet oil of midnight preparation.
The lady, too, was prepared—-enamelled,
coiffured, costumed and stayed into youth
and picture-postcardship. She looked not
a day over 35. To add to the glories of the
evening was a captured lion as prize-dis-
tributor, a local magnate of some tonnage
fat,, fatherly and bald, and fifty. The re-
port read, the turn came for the lion to
roar his little piece. It was very short,
breezy ] just an anecdote, but how eilec-
tive r “My presence,” lie said, “reminds
me of years gone by, when I, a lumpish
boy, sat in class and a young lady teacher
stood in front trying to instil knowledge
into my thick head. I need not mention
the teacher's name.” He bowed gallantly,
and 200 children stamped and clapped de.
lighted applause. Then a large assorted
smile began to spread over the gathering.
The headmistress acknowledged the lion s
wit and aptness with the smile that masks
the raging heart; and 1000 women broke
into smiles of gratitude and glee. No risks
will-be taken with elderly lions next year.
* * * *
“Guinea Please”: Nobody can tell pre-
cisely how the “foreign” ’flu differs from the
home-grown variety. Yet the State Health
Departments have had doctors watching sus-
pected cases to determine whether they are
one or the other. All that these doctors
can possibly say is whether the disease is of
a severe type or not; and if it is severe it
doesn’t matter two straws what you call it.
As a matter of fact, the alleged Spanish
’fiu of which we have now had numerous
cases at the Sydney Quarantine station has
been generally of quite as mild a character as
that which has come within many Sydney
doctors’ experience during the past three
months. The three or four patients
who have died in qaurantine have in
I believe every case been handicapped
in some way or other. For instance,
the lady who died after being put
ashore from the Makura was a martyr to
gastritis, and her resistance was almost nil
when she picked up the ’flu germ. The
worst service that Health Departments or
anybody else can do the public is to create a
scare; 'and I don’t know any better way to
do it than to give the idea —or even sus-
picion—that some new and devastating mon-
ster has been cooped up in quarantine and
has just got loose.
“Gerardy”: Some queer things happened
when Abdul had lost hope and the seat of
his pants. After the Turkish line was
broken in front of Nablus, a Tommy of poor
physique found himself in sole charge of a
whole company of Jackos. No assistance
was in sight, so the bantam solemnly pro-
ceeded to march the’ captives towards the
nearest compound, a few miles distant. The
Turks stumbled along, and the rough nature
of the country threw the column into such
confusion that Tommy often found himself
surrounded by prisoners. Once, while
negotiating a difficult descent, he fell head-
long among the boulders, his helmet and
rifle flying before him. For a moment the
situation seemed critical; but a stalwart
prisoner promptly restored order by lifting
the guard carefully to his feet and replacing
his cumbersome headgear. Then, picking up
the rifle, Abdul restored it with a graceful
bow, and the column marched on to captivity.

“Phoongyee”: “Winderauge” (B. 6/6/T8)
and “Bananalander” (B. 27/6/’18) are both
off it regarding the origin of the Aussie hat.
In 1885 the late Colonel Tom Price was
asked to form two regiments, one of mounted
rifles and the other of infantry. He
formed the Victorian Mounted Rifles and the
Victorian Rangers, handing over the latter
to Colonel Otter, while retaining command
of the former till that regiment was merged
into a Light Horse Regiment. When the
question of uniform came up, the then Gov-
ernment told Price to design his own mil-
linery. For the V.M.R. he decided on khaki,
with crimson cuffs and neckband, a
slouch hat turned up at the right and no
puggaree. The Rangers wore tunics and
slacks, the slacks with a thin crimson stripe,
the tunics without facings. They did
not wear a slouch. The reason for the
turn-up on the right side was to give the
rifles clearance at the old order of “Shoulder
arms!”
SAFETY IN FLIGHT.
SHOCKING TENOR: “They are urging me to sing. Will you accompany me, dear.”-
HIS MUSICAL MISSUS: “Yes, love, — home.”
“Drofsed”: While little Georgie was
away at school one morning a baby brother
arrived. As George rushed home for dinner
he was accosted by his father at the door.
“Ssh!” remonstrated Dad. “You’ve got a
little brother.” George was pleased but
doubtful. “Straight, Dad?” A squeak from
an adjoining room answered him and with
a bound he was off on urgent business. A
stern query from his parent pulled him up.
“Where are you going?” “I’m gonner tell
Mum !” gasped Georgie.
More decay of reverence! The two Tas-
manian Houses of Parliament met together
lately to elect a successor to Long, late of
the Senate. In former times the Assembly
would have risen to receive the visitors
from the Council, and would have remained
standing until the Council President asked
it to be seated. Nothing of the sort hap-
pened the other day. Not only did Assembly
members keep their seats, but some of them
seemed to find humor in the entrance of the
Island peers. One member jingled :
The animals came in two by two,
The elephant and the kangaroo.
And there was a chuckle all round.
From an Australian nurse in U.S.A.: —
“Reconstruction” will be worn as threadbare as
“camouflage” soon. This country talks of hardly
anything else. The opportunity is to be taken to
upend everything'—not in the nasty Bolshevik man-
ner, but just as thoroughly. Especially, women
must have something to do. They have grown used
to war-work ; they cannot return to idleness. Child
welfare organisation is being revitalised, too, by
reconstruction enthusiasts, who in many cases have
got control of the patriotic machinery brought into
being in war-time —organisations to do this, that
and a thousand other things. Problems formerly
kept for the dissecting-room or the chemical lab.
are being brought forth for the naked eye, and
women to-day talk of syphilis, its cause and its
consequence, as yesterday they talked of freckles.
State homes are to be abolished, and the cottage
system substituted. Homelife is to be made more
attractive to counteract the pull of the movies. Bold
spirits are even discussing population questions
in bald terms of polygamy; and there are “circles”
for being nice to the unmarried woman’s child and
others for spreading the glad tidings about inocula-
tion for parental purposes. When the whole thing
has been well sifted out some sane principles will
possibly evolve. At present the babblings suggest
hysteria following in the train of a long-awaited
peace.
“J.T.M.”: Most people will remember
Haig’s famous Special Army Order, issued
when the Huns were hammering hard last
Spring. It said at great length : “Put your
backs to the wall, men. The Kaiser is com-
ing.” It was the wrong sort of message to
send to such hard doers as the Aussies, and
most of the boys considered it a squeal.
After reading it to my platoon I saw a
Digger cross over to an estaminet and chalk
up his message, in large capitals: “PESSI-
MISTS SHOT ON SIGHT. IF YOU
CAN’T BE AN OPTIMIST. SHUT UP.”
I shouted that Digger a bottle.
SHIPS GOOD AND BAD.
MAY: “Cheer up, dear. Some day your chip
wil come in.”
BELL: “My dear, that's the worst of it. It’s
bringing Billy, and I’m engaged to
Bertie, too.”
“F. Rank”: At an officers’ dinner one
night, when the Prince of Wales was the
guest of honor, the talk got on to the sub-
ject of how cheap thrones were becoming in
Europe. One blunt warrior asked young
Wales what he thought of the prospects of
an upheaval in England. His Shyness smiled
wrily, and observed that, if it was going to
happen, he hoped it happened in father’s
time.
(Continued on page 18.)
THE UPLIFT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Several more or less public men in this country
have spoken in appreciative terms ot Bolshevism
during the past few weeks, and expressed the pious
hope that Australia will presently have her full
share of it. Yet the cable tells us of one Bolshevik
Commissary at Petrograd who signed 8000 deatn
warrants. His successor was dismissed because he
could not sustain that death rate.
We have a land of corn and oil,
A land of gold and wine,
Where comfort comes of honest toil,
And freedom is divine;
But what the people need to gave
Them happiness complete
Is Bolshevism where they live,
Fell order to defeat,
And so infuse into their lives a little light
and heat.
We jog along accustomed ways,
We wear familiar clo’es,
And much the same are all our days—
We’ve no dramatic woes.
Our grandpapa is never shot
When walking in the streets;
A man’s existence here is not
Adventurous and fleet.
There’s never much to scare you, always
quite enough to eat.
How good to wake with warlike notes
Reverberant in your head,
When patriots are Cutting throats
Upon your pansy bed!
Your pulses stir with thrills intense
As fifty men and two
Are neatly shot against a fence,
All in the public view—•
Of course it’s clearly understood one of
them isn’t you.
For years Australians have not known
What was their greatest need;
’Tis civil strife with law o’erthrown,
And Famine loosed with Greed.
Ah! this will be a happy land
For simple people when
Full graveyards stand on every hand
To keep within our ken
The splendid work we’re doing to uplift our
fellow men!

“Lower Deck" : Partly owing to the cen-
sorship and partly through the lack of
press-correspondents, the naval arm of the
Australian fighting forces has not re-
ceived nearly as much attention as is given
to the army, though plenty of risks have
gone with the sailor’s job. Some lads, who
were unable to get into the army. because
they were too young, have done their bit in
the navy sooner than let their youth keep
them out of the argument. These willing
nippers, as well as their older pals, find
that the deserving Billjim gets three cheers
and an invitation to have a hop-beer, with
all manner of admiring speeches and wel-
come-home effervescence, while Billjack is
mostly taken for granted as having had a
pleasant, safe time on the heaving billow.
It is not yet too late to start handing
around a few bouquets to our deep-sea
battlers. Not that nothing at all has been
done; but it is a simple fact that, without
knowledge of the doings of Australia s
sailors, the general public which provides
the cheers, liop-beers and hear-hears doesn’t
usually regard a body of Billjacks as worth
noticing beside a bunch of Bdljims. Let
us hear some more about Billjack’s activi-
ties, anyway.

Another page has been turned in the log
of the Dart: the vessel has been sold by
the Vic. Government to private owners.
She left the slips sixty years ago as a yacht
for an English county potentate. Since
then the little craft has been a tender to
the Dartmouth Naval College, a chaser of
slave dhows off the coast of Africa, a survey
ship and a wherry for the Governor of Fiji.
There have been exciting times on her
deck —which is no reflection on the Governor
of Fiji—but ammunition lockers are the
only outward and visible sign of them left.
Her oak sides are as staunch as when m’lord
first came aboard, and she is believed to be
intended for trade in the North. As we
have started to build ships it is fitting that
the Victorian Government should decide to
sell the means of training the crews which
are said to be useful things to have about
a lugger.
TIME WILL TELL.
I.: “Did I ever look like that ?”
II. “Will I ever look like that?”
A scheme is on foot for the construction
of a road from Sydney to Newcastle, every-
body having been too pre-occupied to make
a real highway between the Ma State’s two
biggest cities.' There is a way round by
Beat’s Ferry, but it is about 80 miles longer
than it need be, and some stretches of sand
make it the scorn of motor cars. A pedes-
trian may get along by trespassing on the
railway line for some distance to Brooklyn,
which can be reached lawfully by train or

boat or airship. He is fined for doing this.
Then lie crosses the railway bridge and is
arrested. Next he follows the line some
distance and is jugged and finally lie is
run over in a tunnel, after which he is
fairly safe. It is a curious method of
travelling between two fairly adjacent cities,
but in Australia when a thing is discussed
for many years, like the North Sydney bridge
or the city railway, it is dead sure not to
happen till after everybody is dead.

“Harrison O.” : When I arrived home the
other evening I found a card under my
door intimating that someone had sent me
a telegram ; but as my wife and our entire
staff of servants were out when the rnessen-
rer called, the precious document had been
taken back to the post
office, and I could ob-
tain delivery if I called
for it. Owing to the
facts («) it was 11.30
p.m., (k) the post
office is three miles
away, and (c) our
Rolls-Royce was laid
up for repairs, the
message was not called
for. Next day, when
I was in the city and
the wife was not at
home and the house-
hold staff was out some
more, the telegram
was brought by the
common or garden let-
ter-carrier and pushed
under the door with
the usual batch, of bills
and gubernatorial invi-
tations. What I am
pining to know is why,
if the thing could be
pushed under the door
on a Tuesday, the
same could not have
been done on a Mon-
day. The letter-carrier,
with whom I subse-
que n 11 y conducted
pourparlers, tells me
that what happened
was in accordance with
regulations; so I in-
vite Webster, as one
poet to another, to explain the true inward-
ness of the procedure-
* * * *
“Marqui”: The U.S.A. looks like going
dry, and I wonder what is to become
of New York when the last cocktail
has been sent south. The shutters
will surely be pulled down on many
of the glittering cabarets and expensive
restaurants of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and
Market and Powell-streets, as well as scores
of other places. The custom was to spend
hours supping and sipping, watching the
cabaret gjrls, and listening to sentimental
ditties “rags/’ or -even tabloid grand opera.
It is 'a form of dissipation that seemed to
require a steady supply of alcohol and I
can't .imagine them worrying through on
fresh grape-juice. Drink was the mainstay
of these restaurants, and when it goes
they go, too. Delmonico’s, the old and popu-
lar Fifth-avenue overeating house, not long
since passed into the hands of receivers. The
war had hit it, but the creditor’s claim was
small and the co. evidently had some reason
for hurrying into liquidation. The manage-
ment probably wanted to get rid of the valu-
able stocks of wines and spirits .while the
market held extra-good. For the first eight
months of 1917 that one restaurant raked
in cash at the rate of a million dollars a
year! Opposite Delmonico’s is the almost
equally famous and prosperous Sherry’s,
and down on Broadway many others. There
will be much tribulation and gnashing of
toothpicks in those parts. When, a few
years ago, a prohibition scare shook ’Frisco
like an earthquake, this notice was posted
in a popular hostelry: “There is no hell;
but if San Francisco goes dry, hell will be
right here!”
“A.H.” : Last week’s press wrote eulogies
of an Anglo-Indian cotton merchant whose
will had just been proved at eleven millions
sterling. We also read lately, of
Coats the cotton kings, having
gained £3,000,000 during the walk
This week an Anglo-Indian mis-
sionary is begging funds from
Australian taxpayers for some
millions of starving women and
children in the cotton districts.
The price of rice, he says, has
greatly increased since the war,
and the people’s wages have shown
no advance. Said wages are from
four to six rupees per month for
a 14 hours’ day. I begin to fear
I am a Bolshevist.

“L.L.W.”: This is gospel. A Uni. stu-
dent home on vacation found things going
rather slow at the old home. His people
were inclined to wowse, and when they
asked him to help organise a tea-meeting
and concert for the Sunday-school he
groaned in spirit. At meet-
ing he was introduced to a sweet young
thing who complained to him that the com-
mittee had put her down to recite, “and
there’s nothing new., you know, to recite.”
A wild idea surged into his brain. “Do you
like dramatic poetry?” Ire asked her. “Oh,
yes! I don’t go in for humor.” He pro-
mised to pick out some pieces for her. This
is where I come in. He persuaded me to
attend the concert. After I had listened to
a young man with beer-bottle shoulders
groan “Ora Pro Nobis,” the sweet elocutress
stepped on to the platform. My! how they
applauded her stuff, and demanded more
and got it. The minister said afterward
that, “although highly dramatic, each of
the poems carried a high moral message.”
I recognised them. My friend had piled on
to her “Bellerive’s” goriest achievements.
What may fairly be claimed to be the
longest drink on record was in evidence in a
Gippsland Police Court case the other day,
when a blacksmith was convicted of steal-
ing beer from a barrel in a hotel outhouse
per medium of 50ft. of garden-hose.
“Bad Australian’’ (from Dublin) : There’s
a great revival of the Celtic language in
Ireland, both oral and written, and the ris-
ing generation have so much Irish that the
old men who have little or none are getting
sere about it. For a time they were in-
clined to regard the study as a passing
fancy; but its popularity is evident from
the number of books, pamphlets and news-
paper articles printed in the old language,
and its frequent use throughout the country.
Street names in many towns are now shown
in Celtic and English and the titles of some
railway stations are posted up in the same
way. It begins to look as if the foreigner
who arrives in Ireland about 1950 will need
to “have Irish’’ if he hopes to get away
with the goose.

“Melb”: Chinese cafds here keep on
developing, with white custom. There have
been two moves onward within the last few
weeks. The Oriental moves out from Little
Bourke into Russell-street, rivalling the
pioneer*, which is the Pekin Cafe. The
Chung Wah has just taken a four-storey
store in Little Bourke. None of them could
get on without Europeans. Present tony
Chinese cafOs: Pekin, Canton, and another
in Swanston-street; Nankin in Bourke-
street; Oriental, Chung War. Total, six.
There is something grossly unhealthy about
this.
* * * *
“Costs” : Any returned soldier in the legal
profession might be provided with a legiti-
mate job as temporary judge of N. S. Wales
Divorce Court. There are 450 cases waiting,
and some of them have been waiting two
years. The congestion has been steadily
growing worse, despite the fact that so many
possible petitioners and respondents have
been away at the war, where desertion
didn’t count and cruelty was impossible un-
less the missus was walloped by cablegram.
Now thousands of married men are coming-
back, some of them bigamists and some of
them liable to find out what has happened
in their absence, and the tangle in Divorce
will get no better unless something heroic
is done.
Following a well-worn and generally-
stupid custom, large quantities of letters
for the U.S. and Europe were recently
superscribed “per Makura,” the senders
believing that this was the next boat for
the ’cross-pacific trip. The postal people
duly bagged all such letters and kept them
for the Makura, over a period of several
weeks, although the Ventura sailed before
the other. It was then the harried Oxen-
liam’s job to explain why this bunch of let-
ters had been delayed. His explanation,
which contained a lot of verbiage, amounted
A REGIMENTAL NECESSITY.
THE REJECTED RECRUIT : “How often have
I told you that I am miles too small for
the army!"
THE KIND GIRI : “But have you tried to get
in as a mascot ?"
to the statement that the letters were kept
back simply because the senders desired
that they should go by the Makura and not
by any other boat! Presumably if the
Makura had been burned at her moorings
those letters would never have gone at all.
AFTERNOON TEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gay little wind, that through the window slats
Comes jeering at me of wide-open sands,
Of fluttering leaves, of seaweed-scented flats,
Of bannered blossom and of clinging hands—
Of all this secret wander-world of mine,
And of things bold, and big and masculine!
Not feminine small beer of frocks and frills,
Domestic troubles and the servant pest,
But a low, maddening symphony of hills
And breeze-tossed hair across a pulsing breast —
Thoughts that are sea and sun and life and bloom,
Gypsy intruders of a drawing-room!
“Two lumps?” “More cream?” A chuckle round
the blind.
It was “more kisses then” suggests the wind!

THE COMPLETE COCKY.
A Stockholm message says that the Swedish Min-
ister for Home Affairs confirms the report that
General Ludendorff, under the name of Lindstroem,
is living on a lonely farm at Hesleholm, Sweden.
Cable.
LUDENDORFF (incog.): “’Shun! Fatigue
barty vill advance on der svede turnips.
Mark dime! Vorwarts!”
A tale of 10,000 N. S. Wales unemployed
is being told in the papers. The wonderful
loan policy natu; ally created a class of men
who lived by doing the sort of work that
the Government pays for out of loans. Some
of them forgot how to do anything else.
Some never knew how to do anything else.
When the Labor Government more than
doubled the loan expenditure it took on a
new lot of loan employees, and the young
man who just came of the pick-and-shovel age
then may be 27 now, with loan work for his
life’s occupation. The loan splash went
down to about £4,000,000 a year, which was
bad for these men, .but many of them went
to the war. Now they are coming back to
resume the old loan job which was to be
kept open for them, and their union —the
Loan Workers’ Union —naturally calls on
Holman to get a move on, and run the annual
lOU up to the old £8,000,000 or £9,000,000
and keep faith. They have a vested interest
in the pawn-ticket. Meantime Australia
imports about £80,000,000 worth of goods a
year. It is even importing this year 20,000
tons of sugar.
Acting-Prime Minister Watt proposes that
the whole British Empire’s war loans shall
be consolidated. Most of the present loans
are short-dated; and as they fall due, or
before they fall due, the One Big Union
should, he thinks, convert them. He reckons
that the One Big Union would thus be
able to save millions in interest to the vari-
ous partners. It might; on the other hand
it might cost Australia millions. The best
thing that happened to this country during
the war was the flotation of loans at home;
we gave ourselves our own lOU and pay our-
selves our own interest. If these loans are
converted by a body which governs from
London the chances are the money will be
raised there, or in other foreign parts, and
thereafter we shall pay interest to somebody
else. Whether we pay 4 or 5 p.c. isn’t
of so much consequence as that we pay our
debt, whatever it is, to ourselves.
State politicians deserve sympathy to this
extent, anyway: while they have no control
over the tariff and therefore very little say
as to whether the people shall be provided
with jobs or not, they have to carry the bur-
den of unemployment. Now the Common-
wealth is going to reduce the 255. per head
allowance to the States, bringing it down by
half-a-crown a year to 10s., and State Gov-
ernments scent more trouble than ever. The
obvious remedy is either to abolish Feder-
ation and get back to the old bad conditions
when every State had its own tariff and its
own border Customs officers, or increase the
responsibility of the Commonwealth. The
present divided control is a wasteful
absurdity.
When the Commonwealth took over the
Post Office it naturally took over the P.O.
Savings Banks ; and for Holman to call that
“an anomaly, a mischief and a curse,” as he
did at an iuter-State financial conference
last week, is absurd. What is an “anomaly,
a mischief and a curse” is that, with the
post offices in existence to do savings-bank
business, the States should have gone to the
expense of setting up rival concerns in vari-
ous parts of the country, hiring or provid-
ing special buildings (which the depositors
have to pay for) and engaging special staffs
(which the depositors have to pay too). The
truth is that State Governments in general,
and N. S. Wales in particular, regard sav-
ings banks merely as a backstairs means of
collecting money for their own use. Their
troubles about the public saving. All they
are concerned about is that they shall have
the spending. Watt, who proposed a scheme
of amalgamation, exposed the innards of
the whole business by offering to hand over
to the States 75 p.c. of the increased
deposits, which is more than a fair thing,
considering the enormous need of money
for the industrial development of Australia.
Peacock was sounded as to whether he
would take the Victorian Agent-Generalship,
but he didn’t rush it, and Mcßride’s chances
of re-appointment for at least a year have
improved. The regular allowance is £2500,
but Taverner and Mcßride accepted £l5OO,
though the Government now also pays £4OO
or so a year in taxes.
“Australia’s war debt.” said W. M.
Hughes to the New York World man, “is a
frightful handicap.” Australia’s war debt
is going to be less than half as much per
head as Britain’s if the latest estimates are
realised. And Australia, if it likes to
acquire a manufacturing population, can
multiply its inhabitants by ten at very short
notice and then it will have only one-twenti-
eth as much war debt per citizen as Britain
has. Britain can’t do that sort of thing.
England has already about one person per
acre, and 10 persons per acre is impossible.
Australia’s whole Federal debt, of which
the war liability is a part, amounts to about
3s. per acre, including the acre that the
Bank of New South Wales stands on. That
doesn’t sound so much in a country where
the “wonderful undeveloped resources” keep
us awake at night. The United Kingdom
looks forward to clearing up the present
muss with a war debt of something like £7O
per acre, including the Bog of Allen and the
Grampian Hills and the Peak in Derbyshire.
It is really this country’s peace debt that is
the “frightful handicap.” The accumulation
of war debt must stop when the war stops,
but the piling up of the peace burden goes
on for ever.
South Aus. Treasurer Dick Butler would
be honest if he could. Replying to the
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, which is
fighting the proposal to raise the charge for
“excess” water, he pushed forward the obvi-
ous fact that it is impossible for any Govern-
ment to run public services, such as railways
and waterworks, at a loss (last year it was
£200.000), and balance accounts without
resorting to taxation. When the Warren
and Millbrook schemes are completed and
the interest is charged to revenue (it is
bring charged to capital during construc-
tion), the annual loss will be £100,000; and
it will be still greater when various country
schemes now in course of construction are'"
completed. Victoria, N. S. Wales and
Queensland charge one shilling a thousand
for “excess” water, whereas in S. Aus. the
rate is Od. “Higher rates or taxation—
which?” says Butler, who rebels against the
easy but ruinous plan of dipping into loans
to cover deficiencies.
DIRECT ACTION.
THE LUNATIC : “Yes, the key’s in the lock,
the combination’s set, an’ I could easily
turn the handle and help myself. But,
bless you, that’s not my idea of opening
safes!”
Thete is little prospect of the report pre-
sented by P. A. Anthony on the South Aus.
railway muddle resulting in any improve-
ments worth talking about. The discovery
of the defects was easy; but the devising of
means to remedy them has proved the un-
doing of other reputations besides the
Malayan expert’s. At present Crowland has
1687 miles of 3ft. 6in. gauge, 1011 miles of
sft. 3in. gauge, and 504 miles of 4ft. 84in.
gauge. The Minister, in seeming wonder and
despair, tells us that last year there was a
deficit in the working of the system of
£135,000 in spite of increases in fares and
freights amounting to approximately
£300,000. So the Government proposes to
sack a porter here and there, and wrings its
hands in impotence over the big problem.
“G. Gravelpit”: Leave Minister Pearce
alone. Give him rope—he’s the contrariest
of mortals. When the Defence Commission’s
report was published he was asked to go.
He stayed. When he booked a passage to
England he was asked to stay. He went.
When he gets to England don’t for the love
of Mike ask him to stay, or he’ll come back.
“Hawk” : It is cheering for those of us
with only small resources, who scratched up
every spare bean to buy a bond and help
win the war, to know that our little lot helps
to pay the passage of Minister Pearce’s
family to England, five of them, mother and
kids, all going, I suppose, to help demobi-
lise. Honest, I didn’t know what I was
buying when I put my own missus and kids
on short commons to spar up for that bond.
Though he shied at the idea at first,
M’Pherson, Victorian Treasurer, now seems
to have made up his mind to go to London
to float the conversion loan. Four millions
will fall due on October 1, but it is pro-
posed to pay off £1,000,000, that amount
having been found by the ingenuity of
Minogue, who distributed the cable-tramway
money among the metropolitan municipal-
ities, and then compelled the councils to
pay off their debts to the State. Minogue
will go with M’Pherson if the trip comes off.
“One of the Hungry” : The Commonwealth
Government isn’t yet fully awake to the
possibilities of the situation. We have the
ex-Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, a
Minister of the Navy, and a Minister of De-
fence near the Fountain Head of titles, etc.;
but there is still room for a Minister for
Graves and Cemeteries, and several of us
who support the Government were built for
the billet. Also there is a loud call for a
Ministry of War Memorials; in this case
it would, of course, be essential for the Head
‘to visit the Allied countries, to see what
they are doing in the matter, likewise Ger-
many, Austria and co., to see what they
aren’t doing.
France asks for Alsace and Lorraine:
Italy claims Dalmatia; Japan demands parts
of Siberia; Britain requires certain German
colonies ; Billy Hughes wants
a cut; Belgium reckons on
some long-lost territory ; Ser-
via will fight for a seaport.
As usual, it’s really a Piece
Conference.
The average wage of a
S. Australian factory em-
ployee has jumped from £B4
to £132 in 10 years. The
number of people with a sav-
ings bank deposit has in-
creased in the same State
from 462 to 744 per thousand.
The amount in the savings
banks per head of the popu-
lation —men, women and
children —has grown from
£l5 Bs. sd. to £26 ss. 9d.
Bolshevism isn’t very popu-
lar in S. Australia.
President Wilson, as a
philanthropist and the lead-
ing citizen of a philanthropic
country, is inclined to let the
ex-Ivaiser off under the First
Offenders Act. This is the
first time William has over-
turned civilisation, and he
should be bound over, in two
sureties and his own recog-
nisances, not to do it again.
In that respect he is like
Nero, who only burned Rome
once, and he was very young
at the time. William’s of-
fence was really kleptomania-
He noticed that there had
been a wonderful increase of
population during the last
hundred years; so, being a
kleptomaniac, he mixed in
the crowd and tried to steal
the globe. The same thing
might happen to anybody.
Wilson’s attitude of philo-
sophical toleration is strictly
logical. But only an aero-
plane expert, who has been
up 50,000 ft.; can breathe in
the rarefied moral atmosphere which a man
like the President inhales as a matter ot
everyday habit.
From over the border:—
Instead of going- to the defence of Ryan, the
alleged food-cheapener, I wish Randolph Bedford
would come to mine. Ivnibbs’s sordid figures
demonstrate that Queensland is the dearest of the
mainland States to live in. In 1914, before Ryan
took charge and appointed so many new officials
that there is hardly breathing room, it was the
cheapest State —that is to say it was No. 1. In
1917 it was No. 3. Now only Tasmania beats it
by a thin hair for expensiveness.
“Wart”: Well on to the middle of Janu-
ary I received a circular from the wonder-
ful Defence Department. It was signed by
Orchard, Minister for Recruiting, and
solemnly urged me to read a pamphlet (said
to be posted by the same mail, but it hasn’t
reached me yet) and, if convinced by its
reasoning and appeal, to submit my name
for enrolment for active service. Apart
from the probably unimportant fact that the
war is over, I have already several times
filled up different cards explaining that I’m
an invalid and would have to be wheeled
to battle in a chair.
Probably to support his old implication
that a high tariff and new industries are
not necessary, Repatriation Minister Millen
puts it this way :
Up to October 31, 70,000 men had returned to
Australia. On that date only 1700 out of the 70,000
were on the books of the department.
Those early-returners were wounded men
or unfit. That was why they came
back before October 31. They were spread
over, say, three years. Some of them died.
Many aren’t on the books looking for em-
ployment because they are crippled. Many
got billets because new recruits going away
left billets ooen. Some got tired and ceased
to worry the department. And still 1700 were
still on hand. Now something like 200,000
healthy men are coming to call on Millen
when there are no departures to make
vacancies; and if Millen can place them
satisfactorily without a high tariff and new
industries he will have amazing luck.
Certainly he may stave off trouble for a
time by borrowing £50.000,000 and having
a scramble for it, but there isn’t any need
to borrow £5,000,000. A high tariff could
be built without borrowing twopence to
do it.
AUCTION SALES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An Amsterdam message states that the Aus-
trian Government is selling the castles formerly in
the hands of the Hapsburgs to the municipalities in
which they are situated. The civil bodies are con-
verting the castles into museums, and their grounds
into parks.”— Cable.
Oastles to sell 1 Old castles to sell!
The serfs of the Hapsburgs built them well.
Tower and buttress and grey mossed wall,
O’er the vine-clad valley their shadows fall ;
And high and far in the growing light
Shine the narrow windows of waning light
That tell of the sword and the iron heel
And the terrible lordship lapped in steel,
That ever with death in its red right hand
Made a Right Divine in a cringing land.
Castles to sell! Who’ll buy? Who’ll buy?
The blood that the llapsburg shed is dry;
The fence of steel is broken and gone ;
The kings are down and the world moves on.
Hands are redder than theirs of old ;
For the times are changed and the serf grows bold ;
And never a castle wall could stay
The maddened rush of the vengeful Day—
Oh, the old grey stones of the watch-tower tell
That the lesson of blood was learned too well!
Castles for sale! There’s an auctioneer
Shouting - the bids in the whole world’s ear.
The wall is high and the moat is deep;
But truck of the dead like this goes cheap.
Look and see! In the vaults below
Nought but fungus of doom will grow;
And the banquet hall no more can ring
To the idle laugh of a drunken king.
No more offers. Jt’s going! It’s gone!
Sold for a song—and the world moves on. ,
.Castles to sell! Old castles to sell!
What are they good for? Who can tell?
Dry museums of ancient things
Are scarce as dry and dead as the kings.
Bring the mummy and mammoth bone
And the chopper sword and the axe of stone;
Set up the armor of ancient fear
And the tattered flags of yesteryear;
And over the portal set the line:
“This is the end of their Right Divine.”

GAS IN THE STOMACH IS
DANGEROUS.
DYSPEPTICS ADVISED TO TAKE
MAGNESIA AFTER MEALS.
Sufferers from indigestion or dyspepsia
should remember that the presence of gas or
wind in the stomach invariably indicates
that the stomach is troubled by excessive
acidity.
This acid causes the food to ferment, and
the _ fermenting food in turn gives rise to
noxious gases which distend the stomach,
hamper the normal functions of vital inter-
nal organs, cause acute headaches, interfere
with the action of the heart, and charge the
blood stream with poisons, which in time
may ruin the health. It has frequently
been shown that to quickly dispel a danger-
ous accumulation of. wind in the stomach
and to stop the food fermentation which
creates the gas, the acid in the stomach must
be; neutralised, and for this purpose there is
nothing quite so good as half a teaspoonful
of bisurated magnesia taken in a little water
immediately after meals. This quickly neu-
tralises the acid, thus stopping fermenta-
tion and the formation of gas, and
enabling the inflamed, distended stomach
to proceed with its work under natural con-
ditions. Bisurated magnesia is obtainable
of chemists in powder or tablet form, but as
there are many different forms of magnesia
it is important that the bisurated magnesia
should be distinctly asked for.—Advt.

THE DIGGER: “Now, look ’ere! B double
E R spells BEER, not BEAH!”
“Leo Lear” : In the rush to introduce Eng-
lish song-birds to our land the importers have
often overlooked the local article of similar design.
For instance, one would think that we had no
skylark of our own. But we have two, the brown
and the rufous, that will make any Skyer from
Europe shut up and listen for points. Both birds
are migratory and don’t often come to my district
(S.W. Vic.), but during the last two summers they
have appeared in numbers. They are a true sky-
lark, rising from the ground in a jerky flight,
singing all the while, and then descending with
motionless outstretched wings, trilling it out as a
challenge to any imparted chorister in the locality.
* * * *
“Mazoe" : Here is the only dinkum cure
for veldt sores I have ever struck. Apply hot
fomentations every two hours or oftener until the
sore is perfectly clean and free from pus; then
use tincture of iodine and keep bandaged up until
the skin heals over. I have tried everything else
except amputations and “Bill Bowyang’s” cure
(B. 4/7/’18), and have found the above to be the
only remedy worth a stamp. “Bowyang’s’’ cure
would be rather painful where the patient, as is
not uncommon in this country (Rhodesia), averages
one sore to the square inch from his elbows to
his fingertips. By the way, is there any difference ■
between veldt sores and Barcoo rot?
* * * *
“Musketoon”: Not so long ago mj
neighbor at Forbes (N.S. V.) was presented with
two baby kookaburras. The young Jacks were
taken out of their nest on Saturday afternoon,
•brought to Forbes on Sunday, and on Monday
morning were handed over to the owner of their
new home. On Tuesday morning the old Jacks
turned up at the place shortly after daylight, having
tracked their offspring for over 20 miles, which
was remarkable, considering the roundabout route
taken by the bird-catcher. From the Tuesday and for
about a fortnight the parent birds arrived punctually
twice a day with an immense quantity of food,
such as dead frog's, worms, etc., and the young
ones lived like fighting cocks. One night, * after
the old people left, the young Jacks died. The
old ones did not again return. I have *been
wondering whether the parents, seeing there was
no chance of the youngsters getting away, passed
them some poison.
G. : Writing on that interesting Aus-
tralian, the emu, T. P. Bellchambers (South Aus.)
in his book “Nature—Our Mother” made a queer
slip. “I have seen the proud mother with her
newly-hatched brood,” he says. It is not the
pioud mother,” but the proud pa that takes charge
of the young chicks. Ma emu has her fair shar»
of the hatching duties, but as soon as the youngsters
come to light she makes off into the bush and
takes no further interest in the family for months.
Even then mother’s love and care are not known
to baby emu, as the male takes over all the
responsibility.
“Gouge]*” : About 11 years' ago. when the
opal fields were in full bloom, Lightning Ridge used
to manufacture its own whisky, brandy and rum.
Hundreds of abandoned shafts made ideal hiding-
places for a still, and as the diggers had lots of
money and an unquenchable thirst, there were plenty
of men who were willing to ease the drought. One
big strong chap drank two bottles of “Ladies’ Favor-
ite straight off. lie wandered away and, the whole
field turned out to search for him. The second
day we found him strapped between the forks of a
gum-tree with his own belt. It was impossible
to get him out of the tree by talking to him: he
just screamed and kicked the atmosphere. Two of
our most athletic men tackled the problem. One
shinned up the trunk of the shrub, and when near
the fork started tickling the madman’s bare feet
with a sapling. This naturally drove the jiirijams
berserk. Meanwhile the climber’s mate had scrambled
up the opposite side of the tree, and in the heat of
the yells and language he slashed a knife through the
belt and gave a hearty push. Jimjam fell fair on
op of the galoot who had been tickling him. Both
men hit the ground a thud and the whole search-
party rushed in; but before a separation could be
effected the tickler had his left ear bitten off. After
a fortnigiit in the bush hospital the brandy-fiend
came back to the field. He was under the impression
that wild cattle had been chasing him for a week
trpL th£ !p, US on l y way of was by climbing
trees. Then a chap with a bandage round his head
came along and showing where his ear had been
wanted to know what the chewer was going to do
about it. During the next hour I saw one of the
goriest fights in the history of the Ridge. Even
to this day both combatants think each other mad.
* * *
“Test”: Ever heard of a bird whose cry
resembles a woman screaming? This freak makes
its appearance in the Gundagai (N.S.W.) district
uring a drought, and on one occasion the alarm had
Inrkf™"# mana jF ei ’ ! n that vicin 'ty out at midnight

Melos”: To keep small feathered maraud-
ers out of the orchard, fasten the corpse of a
butcher-bird in a natural posture to a pole and
hoist m the centre of the plot. First remove
entiails windpipe, tongue and brain—the last-
named by making an opening in the roof of mouth
and inserting a small wire with hook on end.
then put into the cavities thus formed a little
pepper fine salt and ground alum. Hang in an airy

an' waylayin’ passers-by,
divil a wink av slape kin I
get on this heal at all, at

“Gecko”: I can assure “K.S.’ J (B.
i.-,) that at least some Australian snakes are
cannibals. Near the Namoi, at Manilla (N.S.W.),
I secured a black-and-white-ringed wriggler
( I'urina occipitalis), 18 inches long, endeavoring to
devour a blind snake (Typhlops polygrammicus)
almost as large as himself. Ten inches had already
passed his gape, and there were just four mere
inches to go when I considered it wise to pickle
the pair for future reference. Dudley Le Soucf
says that cannibalism occurs occasionally while rep-
tiles are being fed in captivity, and photographs I
have made confirm that. Incidentally Le Souef says
that snakes do not live more than two or three
year's.
*'* * *
“Subscriber”: Worms in the stomach are
a common cause of fits in puppies, and in all
probability they are at the root of the trouble
quoted by “Robert B” (B. 9/l/’l9). Recommend
this treatment: Apart from an occasional drink, the
pup should not taste anything for. 24 hours; then on
an empty stomach give powdered areca-nut mixed in
water in the form of a drench, in the proportion
of two grains for each pound the pup weights. Ten
minutes after, administer a dose of castor-oil —a
tablespoonful.
“H.V.E.” : Strange so little economic use is
made of the omnipresent brown eel which surrep-
titiously introduces itself into all fresh waters.
Fried and nicely browned he makes a rich .and
tasty dish, and in eel-pie form he goes down without
sauce. Yet these wrigglers are most frequently
either thrown aside or cut up to serve as bait for
other fishes that have a lower food-value. The fact
is his serpentine appearance is against him. He
isn't pretty. Small squirmers of this genus are best
for cooking. The old-time Maoris had a way of
cocking eels which preserved all the rich flavor and
natural juices. After making a small slit in the
belly, they hung the eels up on a trellis and smoked
them with fires made of green bushes and brush-
wood. The snaky fish were .reputed to be excellent
done this way. The ancient Maori warrior, when on
the march, could easily carry his dinner slung around
his neck.

1.A.K.”: I’ve solved the jibbing-horse
problem—at least the skipper of a steam road-
crusher solved it for me. The horse went on strike
on the steep pinch at Milson’.s Point, North Sydney,
and nothing that I could do would convince him
that it was his business to get on with his job.
The admiral on the steam-roller then took a hand.
He steered his barge behind the lorry, and ringing
“full steam ahead,” sent, it along at a steady pace
for about 200 yards. By that time the horse,
deeply puzzled, took on the pull himself. Moral: To
cure a jibber buy a steam-roller.
“Ragin'”: The native divers of Torres.
Strait don’t worry much about the risks they are
alleged to run from giant clams. When these shell-
fish are . to form part of the menu for their next
meal the boy's find a likely reef, submerged some
three or four fathoms, and then go down to investi-
gate. After picking their giant they drop a large
stone into the open shell. This prevents it from
closing. The rest is easy. The big muscle that holds
the fish to the shell is cut, first on one side -and then
on the other, and the white rubbery mhss is dragged
out and taken to the surface. The operation
doesn’t take two minutes. One old diver of over
70, who is still going strong, declares that no clam
ever reaches more than 4ft. Oin. in length, and as
he has tramped more miles along the sea-bed than
the average man has along country roads he should
know something about it.
“Barcoo”: In the southern States the
tree-kangaroo of North Q., known locally as “mappy-
mappv,” is ignorantly, regarded as a myth, or it
is believed that, if there is such an animal, it can
climb only leaning shrubs and low bushes. As a
matter- of fact this peculiar-looking little chap
pins his affections to the straightest of the tall

timber found all over York Peninsula. There are
several species of tree-kangaroo to be found in New
Guinea and adjacent islands. Australia has two
on!y, both located in N.Q. They can make very
hong jumps from tree to tree when hunted by
Binghi, who looks on them as a luxury'.

THE WHOLE DAY ROUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
N.S.W.
In the first sweet hour
When the dawnlight beams.
And the tree and the flower
Awake from their dreams,
Soft and low, soft and low,
Through the radiant rosy glow
Rolling through the Eastern gate,
The thrush wakes the whole world,
A-whistling to his mate.
Dew gems the thin web
That the spider spins;
That’s the pretty song he sings
When the day begins;
Well, well the thrush knows,
Singing in the pine
When the dawn is on the land,
Morning-love is fine.
In the warm, soft hush
When the moonbeams spread,
And the tall saplings blush
With bronze hues and red,
Sweet and soft, sweet and soft,
Now on earth, now aloft,
Wistful now, and now elate,
The thrush charms the green world,
A-whistling to his mate.
Swift runs the lit stream
O’er the golden sand;
That’s the pretty song he sings
When the noon’s at hand ;
Well, well the thrush knows,
Singing in the heat,
When the sun is high above,
, Noontide-love is sweet.
In the rich earth-sleep
When the sun goes down,
And the little lizards creep
O’er rocks, ribbed and brown,
Now aloof, now a-near,
Through the splendor broad and clear,
Rolling through the Western gate,
The thrush soothes the tired world,
A-whistling to his mate.
Slow fades the last light
In the purple sky;
That's the pretty song he sings
When the night is nigh ;
Well, well the thrush knows,
Singing in the wood,
When the day is at its end,
Love is always good.

THEIR LITTLE NEST.
MARM: “What does that spell? (Dead silence .) Come note, where do you go at nights?”
CHORUS: “To the pictures, please, miss.”
“Snakes!” said Bill the barman, to the
pommy who was questioning him, “I should
well think we had ! The other day Jimmy Flannery
came in and got a billy of beer to take with him
down the line. While we were yarning he stuck
the quart on the floor. By-and-bye he looks down,
and strike me if there wasn’t a five-foot tiger with
the lid of the billy swinging on its tail and getting
the beer down its neck like Flash Mick!”

“Gouger Not so many years ago an
old chap used to kill hundreds of wild p‘gs for
their gall alone, in the Limestone country near
Charters Towers (Q.). He rigged up a rough
bush yard on the banks of the Star River. This
yard had one opening, above which was a rough
gate that slid to the ground between two runners
on the removal of a peg. The fall of the gate
closed the yard. The old hunter would Diace part
of a dead beast in the yard, tie the entrails to a
rope, hitch the rope to the pommel of his saddle
and ride for miles in a circle around the yard, trail-
ing the entrails on the ground. Finally he rode
back into the yard. Then he hoisted up the gate,
climbed above it to where he had a roughly camou-
flaged hiding-place, and camped all night. The pigs
for miles around, out seeking sustenance, would
come across the bouquet of the trailed in’nards, and
would follow it until it led them through the gate.
About daylight the old man would pull out the
peg, down would fall the gate, and that was the
end of the section. There are many places in N.Q.
where wild pigs are plentiful, and I want to know if
the animals can be turned into good monev.
* * * *
“E.M.W.”: Don’t know the beetle de-
scribed by “110” (B. 2/l/’l9), but the mole-
cricket makes a track just under the surface of the
sand. I have often come across these tracks on
beaches in Westralia, and could always find a cricket
in them. The name mole-cricket is derived from a
pair of hands turned outward like those of a mole,
and used for burrowing.

Jessop were working the leaders on the rise just
across the creek from Tommy Ord’s rendezvous
with Tish Swinnerton, and a meeting took place
under their eyes daily. Their hut faced upon the
same depressing event on Saturday afternoons and
Sundays, and it was not at all surprising that
a nervous, susceptible little man like Helliwell should
find the dismal dreariness of Ord’s wooden style
in amorous dalliance a source of growing irritation.
Tommy met Tish on a box log under a lightwood
tree on the slope. It was always the same log.
If Tommy arrived first, he sat on the log and
waited for Tish. If Tish arrived first, she sat
on the log and waited for Tommy. Then the
two sat on the log and waited for something
indefinite, with the dull patience of stuffed things.
Helliwell, at the windlass, or on the threshold
of his hut, watched the pair, and jessop, hearing
him curse, knew that the long, slow, silent, inert,
inconsequent smeoge opposite was telling upon him.
“If they’d kiss once —on’y once!” Helliwell com-
plained. “If he’d give her a hug!” “It'd relieve
the monotony if he’d hold her hand,” Jessop might
suggest. “Or pinch her ear,” said Helliwell. But
Tommy Ord did none of these things. He came
to the log from his place up the creek, and Tish
came to the log from her father’s house down
the creek, and they sat on the log, and that was
all, while 14 months passed. Helliwell’s mind,
or something, gave way under the long strain.
He went one night, dug under the log, and put
in such a charge that the explosion shifted the
log and the lightwood tree out of the country, and
blew a cavern you could have buried an elephant
in. Next day the mates watched for Tommy,
wondering what he would do. He came along the
hill. From a distance of 20 paces he viewed the
chasm, and pondered on the absent tree; then
overcome by the unusualness of things he turned
and went home. And all the time Tish sat unseen
where she had taken her place to wait for him —
at the bottom of the hole.

“Hawkesbury”: H. Mason, of Nelson
(N.S.W.), has shot near his home over 50
foxes with a pea-rifle. Method: stalking them at
dawn in rubber sand-shoes. The fox appears to
have the country apportioned and subdivided; a
pair killed, another pair—sent for by wireless ap-
parently—take their place. The British fox is
red and short in the legs; the local product,
yellowish, long in the leg and with a strong
resemblance to the dingo. Have the two inter-
crossed? Are there any red foxes in Australia?
The dingo is far more timid than the alleged fox,
going about in twos or threes, and does not trouble
poultry. Reynard usually works alone, and, with
a family at home, Madame Reynard calls any old
time, morning or afternoon, and takes the pet
goose from under our nose.

“Frank R.”: Stories are told of Binghi
when caught by an alligator having thrust his fingers
into the reptile’s eyes and thus released himself. It
does not happen often, but it does sometimes. A
one-legged abo. who wanders about Ayr (N.Q.) was
spearing fish in the Burdekin River when an alligator
seized him by the leg and dragged him below' the
surface. Twisting around, Binghi thrust both his
thumbs into the brute's eyes and the ’gator let go,
but the almost severed limb had afterwards to be
amputated.

“Jack S.” : Probably the most war-travelled
marsupial on earth accompanied the Ist Divisional
Train, A.I.F. It was a ’roo, and reached Egypt in
December, 1914, lived through the training days
in Mena Camp, was smuggled on board the Minne-
waska (“Birdie’s” flagship), saw the Landing, re-
turned to Egypt, was again smuggled to the fighting
zone and returned to Alexandria to be invalided
with a broken arm (a mule did that). The good
Australian is now in the Alexandria zoo. What’s
the matter with bringing him home?
“Riverina”: Henare’s failings had been
many, and the judge dealt out separation and ali-
mony to Mrs. Henare. Henare dolefully told the tale
to a sympathetic pakeha. “At any rate, Henare,”
said Pakeha, consolingly, “you are free now.” “Wot
good that?” wailed Henare. “I’ve got to pay ’im
te brurry aluminium!”
* * * *
“D.F.”: Amongst Australasian birds
which have become extinct are the Macquarie Island
parrot, the Tasmanian and King Island species of
emu, and a Maoriland quail. And if a night parrot,
once fairly common in some parts of South Aus.,
has not gone out it is very near it. The Macquarie
Island parrot seems to have been closely related
to another isolated species found on Auckland
Island. As late as 1830, 20 years after the discov-
ery of the Macquaries by Hasselberg (or Hassel-
brough, or three or four other spellings), the par-
rots were plentiful enough, for in that year the
crew of the sealing-vessel Faith brought to Sydney
numbers of them. They were described as “the glib-
best of the loquacious tribe.” At home they
nested on the ground, because there are no trees
on Macquarie Island, and the cats that were let
loose have long since cleaned them out.
* * * *
“Silas Snell”: We bad been told of a
show worth investigating at Griddle Creek, Speer-
grass, out from Ararat (Vic.). “There are a couple
of the settlers having a cut at it in a piffling sort of
way,” the grocer told us, “but doing nothing worth
mentioning. Give it a fair trial; but mind Bowleg
Lowrie doesn’t fall foul of you.” Bowleg Lowrie,
we gathered, was one of the parties working the
creek, invested with that sort of divine right the
cockies in mining country try to trade on. We
went out to Speergrass with traps and ware and
found Griddle Creek, a gallon or two of water
dodging among loose stones. As we approached
through the trees cries of bitter revilement came to
us from the scene of operations, and presently we
came upon Spicer. Spicer was a small, thin-legged,
wasp-necked, grey man of 50, with whiskers that left
little of his face visible; but such of Spicer’s
features as were visible in the welter of hair exhi-
bited indications of recent derangement. We were
total strangers, but Spicer cornered our sympathy on
sight. “Look et me flue!” he cried. “See what’s
bin done to me sluice-box!” The flue and his sluice-
box had both been contrived from lengths of gum-
bark beaten off the logs, and retaining their semi-
roundness. “Bowleg Lowrie done it,” said Spicer,
pointing, and again an outburst of profanity crackled
from the middle distance where the head and shoul-
ders of the said Bowleg Lowrie showed out of a
small hole. Spicer was muddy, but he was driven
snow compared with Lowrie, who was black and
caked with the peculiar vegetable loam that made
Griddle Creek the dirtiest field I ever put a pick
into. Squatting near Lowrie's claim were three kids,
two boys and a girl, all under 12, and all black
with the clay of Griddle Creek. “Who turned the
creek?” squealed Lowrie. “Think when I bin’ ’n’
took all the trouble to turn the crick I’m goin’ t’
let that woolly aphis work it? Let him try—let
anyone try —’n’ they’ll have Bowleg Lowrie to deal
with.” ‘‘Now I’ll fight yeh!” cried Spicer, jumping
up with sudden inspiration. “Come on if yer game
now there’s them what’ll see fair play. Come on!”
Spicer danced about in grotesque valor, like an exas-
perated bull-cricket. “Fightin’ fair ’n’ square I
was,” he explained, “ ’n’ them kids cut in, hangin’
on me, kickin’ ’n ’bitin’, ’n’ all the time Bowleg
beltin’ in with a stake. Then when I’m licked they
tears up me sluices. Come on! We’ll soon see
who’s bes’ man. Come on!” Bowleg Lowrie came
up from the hole, a moving mass of mud. Bowleg
Lowrie advanced upon him, with a splutter of objur-
gations, and looking ominous enough to scare the
heart out of a young Nubian lion. Spicer stood his
ground for three seconds; then he turned and fled
with all his bison-like whiskers. And we did not
blame him. You see, Bowleg Lowrie was a lady!

“Ida D.”: If “Robert B.’s” puppy (B.
9/1 /’If)) isn’t dead yet tell him to dose it with
sulphur and milk—about a teaspoon of sulphur
to a saucer of milk—three times a day; or with
copper filings and milk. Another pick-me-up is
soap and tobaoco. I have seen a dog very badly
affected with fits recover on this cordial. Cut the
tobacco up fine and mix it with very soapy water.
* * * *
“Polecat”: If my speedometer is correct
the comfortable pace for the emu is 29 miles per
hour. Here at Yalgoo (W.A.) they run ahead of
the motor-car along the rabbit-proof fence at the
same steady pace for miles. Go faster and you
overtake them; go slower and they pull ahead. For
short spurts of a mile or so they can go up to about
35
* * * *
“D.F.”: The record place-name was worn
by a district in the north-east of Tasmania, beyond
Scottsdale, which for a long time was “Nowhere
Else.” This is worse than “Tempy” on the Mildura
(Yic.) line; so christened because it was a
“temporary” station —abbreviated by the railway
men to “Tempy.”
* # * *
“11.W.F.”: Anybody seen the ringtail
opossum raiding birds’ nests for eggs or young?
In 1897, near Baringhup racecourse ( Vic.), I noticed
a pair of crows with nest and" young evidently not
long hatched. One day I heard a great squawking
at. the home tree, and looking over saw a ringtail
opossum going up towards the nest. The hen bird
knocked fur out of ’possum, driving him back to the
shelter of a clump of sprouts. The animal went
down backwards striking at the birds with his
front claws. This performance happened twice. Next
morning the parent crows were at the old address,
but no young ones. Evidently ’possum did a
bit of overtime at night. Since then I have been
camped in Gippsland mountains where ringtails are
numerous, and I notice that parrots, magpies and
jackasses rarely rear young about our camp, though
the birds lay and sit. Probably ringtails eat eggs
or young, according to their freshness.

■?_cjWty-)mm;
Japan at First Hand
Old Dr. Gar ran, for so many years editor
of the S. M. Herald, didn't like a journalist
who “knew too much about his subject.
Joseph I. C. Clarke, who wrote Japan at
First Hand (Dodd, Mead and Co., New
York), doesn’t know too much about ins
subject. So he never bores you—unless you
are a person who knows a lot about Japan
already. For the serious student seeking
guidance the book isn’t to be recommended.
But for one who wants a smattering ot tne
big subject there is nothing better or more
entertaining. A man who could write so
interestingly and with so much understand-
ing about “The Theatre in Japan, tor in-
stance, or “The Fine Arts in Japan,
couldn’t really be expected to make a very
good list with “Japan’s Finajice. and Bank-
ing” or “Japan and Big Business. On
such subjects we want not impressions so
much as facts down to decimal points.
However, even impressions are of value, r 01
example:—
Thirty and more large cotton-mills are operating
2,000,000 spindles and using about 1,000,000 bales
of cotton. The industry is immensely profitable. . . .
Cheap and abundant female labor accounts for much
of this.... In most mills work is continuous, a
night force and a day force changing ranks at
intervals. The girls, it seems, do not work in the
factories for more than three or four -years. 1
supply does not, however, seem to tail ott as tne
workers who survive generally go home with money
saved, and a little goes a long way in rural .Japan.
The dormitories, Mr. Clarke adds, do “double
work, like the machines.” But this writer
rarely has anything to say of Japan except
in praise. He will not have it that the
TJ.S.A. or any other white-man’s country
has anything to fear from Japan:—
The great, the alluring thing, is the hearty union
of these two strong nations [U.S.A. and Japan] to
make the Pacific Ocean a great pathway of peace.
In the upshot of the world-war that is something
that every friend of America and friend of .Japan
must keep in mind.
And again : —■
It is the will to war that is necessary. I do not
believe that it exists in Japan, even in the irre-
sponsible quarters. It is absent from the Govern-
rnent. I uni willing to rest on tli&t statement.
It is good news. At tlie sninie time, in
another connection, Mr. Clarke tells us that
the Kawasaki docks at Kobe, which up to
a few years ago could go no further than
gunboats, has lately “launched the Hurano,
a battle-cruiser of 27,000 tons, and at the
time of my visit had a super-dreadnought
of 30,000 tons on the stocks.”
But, to go back to the beginning, the
value of the book lies in the pictures it
paints of the social and domestic life of
the people. Here is a sample of the farce
or little comedy-sketch of the Japan
theatre: —•
A. country man comes to town wanting to buy six
life-size statues . of Buddha, and' consequently is
looking for an image-maker. A rogue overhears bun
and savs he is the man. It will take a year, he
says, to make them, and the country man should pay
some money; but the country man wants them the
next day The rogue then calls-in two confederates
and they arrange to exhibit the statues as ordered,
three in one temple and three in a temple next door.
So they don masks and robes and take Buddhist
emblems and pose very effectively. The country
man is so pleased that he worships the three knaves
and then in the next temple worships them again
in three different positions. But the rustic is not
quite satisfied. He wants some alterations and be-
comes harder and harder to please. this keeps
the rascals on the jump, all sorts of comic postures
resulting, until at last the intended victim comes
on them struggling to get into place.
Incidentally we gather that, though the
jap theatre knows little of either, it has
thus far preferred Ibsen to Shakspeare.

“Brother” Hun in Wartime
A valuable book is German Social De-
mocracy During the 11 ar, by Edwyu Bevan.
The writer isn’t heated or angry and he
doesn’t even seem sorry. He is simply dis-
passionate. In 1914 the Social Democratic
Group in the Hun Rficlistag was 110 strong
out of 397, so it was no small party. it
thought it was an international brother and
a rebel, and it regularly voted against the
Budget as a protest against militarism and
against the autocratic methods which made
Parliamentary Government a farce. (As
a matter of fact, the Reichstag, with its sys-
tem of nomination of Ministers by the
Sovereign and 11011-responsibility of Ministers
to the people’s representatives, is a replica
of the United States House of Reps. Llie
system worked well in one country and badly
in another, because the people are different.)
Then the war came, and the party found it
wasn’t a rebel but a broken reed and a hollow
mockery. On July 29, 1914, it was solid
against the war, and the voting of money xor
the war, and the whole iniquity. On August
4 it gave its block vote —-Liebknecht, the
Spartacus man, included—for granting all
the war expenses (£250,000,000) the Gov-
ernment demanded. On December 14, 1914,
it again voted for another big supply of
money (£250,000,000) for the war, though
by this time the Belgian horror was visible
in all its nakedness. That is to say, 109
votes were given out of 110, Liebknecht being
the dissentient. In March, 1915, £500,000,000
was demanded for the war, but this time
the vote was made part of the ordinary Bud-
get ; therefore the Social Democrats had
either to vote against the war or give
up their old regular protest against the
Kaiser’s system of government. Some
stayed away, but of those present all
save two gave up protesting against the
Kaiser’s tyranny for the sake of supporting
the war. As the misery and hopelessness
accumulated a fraction, the Minority. Social-
ists screwed up courage to vote against the
war-credits ; but so long as hopes were high
the vote in the House was pro-war. Whether
the Minority would have broken away if the
war credit hadn’t been made part of the
ordinary Budget, so that voting for it in-
volved an endorsement of the whole Junker
policy, no one can tell. It is curious to read
that at the Stockholm Socialist gathering
of many nations in 1917, the German
Majority Socialists came with these peace
proposals: —
(1) That ruined countries such as Belgium
should be helped if necessary by contributions from
all the belligerents —Britain, the tinted States
and the rest helping to pay for the Hun damage.
(2) Germany and Austria to give up no tern-
(3) No annexations, but Ireland, Egypt, Morocco,
India, Russian Poland, Finland, Tripoli, Tibet and
Korea to be taken from the Allies and set up as
nominally independent States. Britain to give up
control of the Strait of Gibraltar, the Suez Canal
and the mouth of the Red Sea, and the U.S. the
command of the Panama Canal.
(4) No indemnities.
(5) No question to be raised about responsibility
for causing the war.
The formal conference that was to succeed
this meeting never came off, but it is re-
corded that the German Majority Socialists
went home from Stockholm astonished men.
They had realised for the first time that their
country was a thing of loathing, and that
their conduct in Belgium wasn’t admired.
They couldn’t imagine why, and they are
nrobably wondering to this day—these Hun
“brethren.” (Published by Geo. Allen and
Unwin, Ltd., London.)
A Satchel of Books
Twelve Sonnets, by Bartlett Adamson (Wlut-
combe and Tombs, Ltd.)- This slim booklet has
a lot more in it than many volumes ten times
its size with well-known names on their covers;
for Bartlett Adamson has delicacy and force and
skill combined with some real inspiration. The
work is clear-cut; the lines are full of melody;
the complete harmony is admirably held and re-
strained for the close of the sestet. Here is the
sonnet entitled “August, 1914”: —
Time was grown weary and the gods were fled;
Gone were the glories of the days of old;
The legendary wonders all were dead ;
And earth lav slumbering under stars grown cold.
But sudden a ’ magic set the skies aflare;
The world awoke; and now, by sea and shore,
Adventure calls to men to do and dare,
And wonder walks the common ways once more.
Monsters are slain that poison all the breeze;
And wyverns fight and flame across the sun;
And jovial fishermen, in misty seas,
Net the leviathans; and deeds are done
Worthy the gods of eld, since far and near,
The silver call of August echoed clear.
There is an “a” which seems beyond requirements
in the fifth line, and the printer has, in the
book, arranged the lines wrongly for the Shak-
spearean form; but no one can miss the full
resonant note or the exquisite movement. Much
of the work in the little book is quite up to that
level. Bartlett' Adamsdn should do great things
yet.
Melburnian Sonnets and Songs, by Edward .T. B.
White (Diocesan Book Society, Melbourne). Most
of this verse is worked out in well-worn phrase
on proper, conventional lines. The construction
is fair; but there is little freshness. There is a
pulse in the “Eureka Stockade” ballad and here
and there through the book, but it is not a rapid
pulse nor is there any accompanying fever.
Poems on the Great War, by Florence Elizabeth
Meynell (Star, Lismore). Some lines are not
without force, but there is little ingenuity and
no lift or inspiration.
Fantasy and Reality, by Ruth M. Hawker (The
Mate, Adelaide), A book of rather slight verse
which has some quality. Simplicity, music and a
little insight make it worth while. Sample:—
My lady of dreams wears a lavender gown;
Lavenders fair.
My lady has eyes that are shining and brown;
So is her hair.
My lady has lips of' a ruby-like i red ;
Lavender’s sweet.
My lady is lovely from shining crowned head
Down to her feet.
My lady is happy the whole livelong day;
Lavender’s rare.
Woo her who want her, win her who may—
Wayward and fair.
The Man from, the Clouds, by .1. Storer (Houston
(Blackwood and Sons, London and Edinburgh). A
naval volunteer officer jumps with a parachute from
a wind-blown balloon, believing that he is over
German soil. He lands in the darkness in a field,
meets a man and addresses him in German. The
man replies in German, warning him not to speak
that language there. The place proves to be a
Scottish island; and the job is"fß find the German
spy. Unless you are too good at guessing you
won’t find him till you reach the last chapter.
Cleverly written stuff of a very English kind.
Revoke, by W. De Veer (John Lane, London).
A yarn of Java with good color. A Dutch official
and the globe-trotting daughter, of an English
general are drawn together, but the ways of “the
East” have set moral barriers between them. Not
much more than that, but that very well done.
The Inky Way
“Marqui”: Recent reviewers of Captain
R. Hugh Ivnyvett’s book, “Over There with
the Australian's,” don’t know that the brave
and brainy author is dead. The S. M.
Herald even tenders advice and hopes that
the one or two inaccuracies will be corrected
by the author in future editions. Ivnyvett,
after a strenuous career on Gallipoli, in
France and as a lecturer on American
platforms, collapsed and died in New York
last April, two days after his book was
published. His passing was recorded in
The Bulletin.
The Times, published at Gundagai
(N.S.W.), celebrated its 61st birthday
lately. For a country rag it is rather
remarkable: it has been owned by one
family—the Elworthys—ever since it was
foaled. *
Edward Tregear, who so long handled the
Labor Department in Maoriland in a fashion
that made the most unworkable industrial
measures run to music, and who many
years ago startled the world with his closely-
reasoned theory of the “Aryan Maori,”
appears to have lost none of his literary
ability at the age of 72. His old verses
were good and some of his prose was
better, while the initial letters of the learned
societies which have elected him to fellow-
ship would fill half a column ; but the vigor
in the poem, “A Whisper of God,” which
he published the other day is unabated.
This is the hour of “the still small voice” —this
the Immutable Word,
Justice and mercy and service! —or —the edge
of anarchy’s sword!
Tregear always had something of the
prophet’s vision and way.
Norman Malcolm gets back, with the com-
ing of peace, to his old billet on Adelaide
Register. He was on Gallipoli with the 9th
Light Horse and in Egypt afterwards, and-
since being invalided home has been on the
instructional staff at Mitcham camp.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Gleniris” : I hate to be a croaker about
an Australian industry, but before any re-
turned soldier embarks in eucalyptus-distil-
ling, as advised by “Arthur R.” (B. 9/T/’l9),
he should examine the position very closely.
“Arthur R.” remarks (1) that the initial out-
lay for a medium-sized distilling-plant is not
great and (2) that even for crude oil there is
a great demand. As to (1), the fact is that
a small-priced plant only produces low-grade
oil. Regarding (2), I understand that the
distillers are largely dependent on the export
trade, and the scope for selling, owing to
existing lack of shipping facilities, is very
limited at present. Then there is the ques-
tion of getting the right to pull the leaves,
which isn’t the easy one it may seem. Per-
haps some of those battlers who are sticking
to their stills will testify. ,

“Marlinspike”: Macquarie Island, the
specklet in latitude 55 deg. S., 900 miles
south-east of Hobart, is about the cheapest
bit of land in Australasia. It is attached to
the Speck, and is leased to .Joseph Hatch,
who runs the business of. boiling down pen-
guins for oil, at £4O a year. As there are
about 225,000 acres in the territory, this
works out at roughly £1 for 5000 acres, or
23 acres for a penny. Macquarie Island was
a lively enough spot for a score of years
after its discovery by Captain Ilasselbrough,
of the Perseverance, sailing out of Sydney, in
ISIO. Six ships left that port for the new
land within a month or two of Ilasselbrough s
return, and for a while Macquarie Island,
which then swarmed with sea-elephants, was
one of the greatest sealing grounds in the
Southern Hemisphere. There are still sea-
elephants there, but not enough to bother
about.
“Broker” : Buyers may hope for a quick
slump in the price of other merchandise, but
Scotch whisky will still increase in price.
In passing an Act, some years ago, that
locally-manufactured potable spirits shall be
matured for two years in wood before sale,
the Federal Government imposed a wise re-
striction which immeasurably raised the
standard. Many of our best ideas have been
lifted by other countries, and as a War_ pro-
vision, England, in May, 1915, enacted iden-
tical legislation respecting a three-years
maturity period. After this measure was
passed distillation practically ceased. The
age limit is as much a fixture there now as
it is here. Normal conditions cannot be ex-
pected for at least four years after the com-
mencement of re-distilling, and, as a result,
stocks of bulk whisky, which are being grad-
ually depleted as they come of age, will be
so short in Australia as to be quite beyond
the detection of an expert moonshiner.

Dr. Hargreaves, director of the S. Aus.
chemical-research department, finds that
local production of wood-pulp for paper-
making is at present commercially impos-
sible. Which recalls that the day after the
Australians had taken Mont St. Quentin in
France, a British general declared that the
thing was “from the military point of view
impossible.” However, putting that aside,
Hargreaves might now inquire whether the
manufacture of paper from straw_ is also
“commercially impossible.” It isn't found
commercially impossible in the U.S.A. even
though the product has to compete there
with cheap wood-pulp paper.

Up on the deck in the morning, sniffin’ the land

Man rants.
And see that the butts ain’t covered with smuts
To mess up a passenger’s pants.
I ’ave the laugh on the stokers. The stewards ’ave
got me set
’Cause I goes to me meals like a first-class ’orse in
the ’ands of a first-class vet.
I tuckers along of the steerage, and the stewards
you ought to see!
No' ’ope of tips—they puckers their lips
To ’ave to be servin’ me.
Upon the bridge in the sunset, the coast aslidin’ by,
Looks just like a passing picture scene I saw
back home at the Cri’ —
Hills and valleys and rivers, and sands more guessed
than seen,
As the sun drops swift to the ocean’s lift
An’ the gulls wheel in between.
I ’aven’t to go aloft, thank God, by the ratlines’
greasy ways , ,
Athiek with smoke and grime and grit, nor L
’aven’t to tar the stays;
I mooches about the deck all day, but keeps me
eye on the mate —
The bloke ’oo swears at the main deck chairs
An’ must ’ave ’em all put straight.
The Old Man doesn’t know I’m aboard as long
as ’is brass is bright,
An’ the second and third and fourth, good Lord,
they ain’t got me in sight.
The doctor he tries to get me in to clean up his
stinkin’ muck,
An’ the cook ’e swats at ’is pans and pots
An' trusts a ’eap to luck.
The greasers and trimmers call me down; the A.B.’s
pass me by
AVith never a word, or look, or joke, but I don’t
pipe me eye.
The quartermaster gives me jolts (as long as the
mate ain’t near),
An’ the bo’sn calls and the chief ’e bawls
But never a one I ’ear.
It’s up in the air and sea winds fresh —that’s where
I spends me day ;
I don’t care a blank for the rest of the crew 01
any d— thing they say. j
I’ve got me job and I sticks to it, and that i 3
enough for me —•
They can draw their screw (the same, sir, to
you)—
Give me clean air and the sea.

“COLO" Tyre,
Eight Points of the “COLO” Tyre
(1) TEE AD.—Corrugated, presenting small sur-
face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TEE AD.—A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BEEAKEE STEIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PUEE EIJBBEE. —Pure Eubber is placed
under Breaker Strip.
(5) CAECASE. —Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) FULL AIE SPACE.
(7) SIDE WALLS. —Eealising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a few months’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-
coated with rubber, to prevent rust.

POVERT
POINT
Barry Lupino is to be the Australian
Chaplin, if Australia is willing to have
such a thing about the house. He has already
entered upon the fabrication of a series of
extravagant comedies to test the extent for
which Australia is for the Australians.
“S”: One of the Hugos passed out in
Melbourne the other day, and old playgoers
were reminded again that the last of the
one-time favorite team of minstrels has for
years been earning a poor living as a bill-
sticker. Alas, I know only one old vaude-
villain who is cosy in Australian retirement.
He put his stuff into horseflesh, and saved
his "ponies” for a rainy day. A few years
ago an offer of a benefit was made to the
bill-sticker, but he declined. “I don’t want
people who knew me when I was somebody
to be reminded that the old brilliants are
now paste,” he said.
FORETHOUGHT.
CASSIDY : “England ought to give Oireland
Home Rule, bad cess to her.”
MACPHERSON : “Aye! But I wad male’ it a
condeetion that she r-r-resairves the
movin’ picture rights!”
“Melb”: In Rigo’s opera co. Cacialli,
Balboni, Lois and Filippini sing in Italian.
Everybody else in English. Musgrove in-
sisted on his German operatic men and
women singing in English. It was torture
both to performers and audience and Muzzy
soon relented. Edwin Booth successfully acted
Hamlet in Berlin, speaking in English, with
a German-speaking co. Rossi, the Italian,
acted Shakspeare with approval all over the
United States. He spoke his own language,
supported by English-speaking mummers.
Salvini and Booth acted “Othello” together,
Salvini in Italian as Othello, Booth in Eng-
lish as lago.
“75”: “Sister of the Gippsland giant
family” was the proud announcement in
a death notice in Melbourne the other
day. Melbourne tried to remember the '
family, and mostly failed. The “giants”
were two daughters and a son of
William Snell, the only abnormal mem-
bers of a family of 11. Tom did not remain
in the show business, but returned to the
land, and by hard toil reduced hinrself
almost to normal proportions; but the gLth
of his sisters, Clara and Anna, was for years
a source of profit to themselves and Phil
Stuart, who exhibited them in most parts
of Australia. Anna weighed 255 t., and
Clara, if her advertisements were to be
believed, 30st. 101 b. They drew great
crowds to Melbourne Waxworks, and did
fairly well in S’Africa, but England refused
to be interested.
“Oxygen”: Touching Melbourne Town
Hal), it isn’t so much the want of air, or
even fresh air, that pressmen complain of.
Their grievance is that the hall is dis-
gracefully chilly in winter and draughty at
all times. To sit in a line with the en-
trance to the reserved seats is to feel the
icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter
wind which breathes bronchitis. Further
ventilation would, as a rule, only aggravate
the draughtiness of the glorified barn, and
then nobody in the audience would ever look
self-satisfied save the gigantic pictures of
mayors, dead or alive, that panel the walls.
Some of these robed and chained figures of
an inglorious past died before the term
“Lord” was prefixed to the title of Mayor,
and somehow their self-satisfaction seems
clouded by the thought of what might have
been. This, perhaps, explains why the wind
is apt to sigh dismally when it blows in
through the open doors during an interval.
The pathos of the picture-gallery appeals to
rude Boreas.
“C,”: Ever notice how badly the movie
actors get on their horses? The average
star hero has a horrible way of standing off
at right angles to his mount and poking its
ribs each time he puts foot in the stirrup.
Similarly when he dismounts. I actually
remember seeing an actor (supposed to be a
cavalry officer) who had a trick of pulling
his foot out of the stirrup with his right
hand each time he got off. Pretty dangerous
trick with a young horse.
“Demos”: “Dinkum” was introduced to
London mummers long before the war by
Australian George Dawe, who used to play
in Bilanderson’s blood-curdlers. Dawe
worked his passage to England, and after
a bitter struggle managed to get a start in
the chorus of a musical comedy. He was
making fair headway until the tyranny of
a stage manager became insufferable. Dawe
told the despot in bushfire language what
he thought of him. Before departing he
was presented with a match-box inscribed:
“To dear ‘Dinkum’ from his friends at the
Shaftesbury Theatre.” Dawe afterwards
took it out of Fritz and is now probably
somewhere on the Rhine.
Peggy Pryde, the bustling little English
comedienne who is Mrs. George Pearson
outside the theatre, is returning to Australia
with her husband. She was at London
Hippodrome in November.
“W. J.M.” : Some of “Valentine Day’s” par
(B. 16/1/T9) re productions of Dickens is
news to me. He says that Katie Putnam pro-
duced “an American serving up of Dickens’s
‘Tale of Two Cities’ at Sydney Gaiety in
1889.” I was a member of the co. at the
time and have no recollection of it. The
three pieces we played there were “The Old
Curiosity Shop” (in which A. R. Lawrence
played Quilp), “Irma the Elf,” and “Fan-
chon the Cricket.” I remember that Sydney
season particularly well, as our manager
failed to materialise with our first week’s
treasury, and we needed the money pretty
badly. By the way. during our performance
of “Old Curiosity Shop,” a son of Dickens
used to come round nearly every evening and
watch the show from the back.
“K.”: Bill Dyson used to enjoy raising
blisters on some actors when he was doing
the theatrical drawings for The Bulletin.
Frank Thornton was supported during one of
his Australian visits by a mincing young
hamfat whom nobody cared for. In due
course he paraded before Dyson, who seized
upon him like a hungry spider. The result
delighted me so much that I wrote to Dyson
thanking him. Bill replied briefly: “Glad
you liked the drawing. He provided me with
some good hating.”
“L.11.P.”: Despite family prejudice, a
remarkable number of parsons’ sous and
daughters go to the stage. Irene Vanbrugh
and sister Violet are daughters of Rev. P.
Barnes, of Exeter (Eng.). Lily Langtry’s
pa was Dean of Jersey. Basil Gill (here
with Wilson Banett in 1891), Bill and
Charles Hawtrey, Ivyrle Bellew, Matheson
Lang and Frank Benson —all sons of the

manse. So was Charlie Brookfield. Among
playwrights Anthony Hope, Jerome K.
Jerome and Bob Hitchins had reverend
fathers; so had Reginald De Koven, whose
“Robin Hood” figured for a time in the
repertoire of the Royal Comics.
“C. Ockney” : A few days before Rostand’s
death Marie Lohr staged the French drama-
tist’s “L’Aiglon” at her AVest End theatre
(the Globe). This was the first presenta-
tion of the piece in English in London.
Louis N. Parker, whose adaptation was used
for the Tittel Brune production in Austra-
lia, and, previous to that, for Maude Adams
in America, revised his original somewhat
hasty script for the occasion. The young
Sydney-born manageress was, of course, cast
for the star part (now called “Francis
Charles”), and her supporters in the long
list of characters numbered several well-
graced mummers well remembered in Aus-
tralia.
“J.F.IL” (London) : Arnold Bennett has
discovered a way of dropping a few of the
thousands he has made out of books and
plays. He has leased the Lyric, at suburban
Hammersmith, and intends running a revue
and children’s panto., written by his friend
Milne, of London Punch. There was a
boom in suburban theatres some years ago,
but it soon burst. Most of these places are
now picture palaces and the original owners
groan when they pass by in frayed pants.
To chase the panto. Bennett has planned a
revival of “As You Like It”; following
that a new T comedy of his own. The ven-
ture shouldn’t fail for want of variety,
anyhow.
“H”: Marie Lohr scored a big success
at London Globe with her special matinee
performance of “L’Aiglon” in aid of the
King’s Fund. Rostand’s play, built for
Bernhardt, came as a novelty to the new
generation of London playgoers, Sarah
gave a few performances at Her Majesty’s
in 1901, since when London has managed
to get along without it. Marie collected
three princesses and a crowded house with
stalls at five guineas apiece.
“0.L.”: John Lemmone's great “benefit”
reminds me that some little time ago a
writer in London Queen stated that
he had discovered flautist E’red Griffith
playing a piccolo for alms in a Lon-
don street. Griffith, now dead, had
been a well-known member of the orchestra
at Covent Garden, and did some flute-
work as one of Melba’s concert-helps during
an Australian tour. To judge by the size
of the money-bags filled by the' Lemmone
benefit, Griffith struck his bad luck in the
wrong country.
“R. J.S.”: A circus performance was
lately held up at Molong (N.S. W ) owing
to the crowd refusing to pay 2s. 2d. for
the back seats. The showmen eventually
agreed to make it Is. 2d., and the band
played in the first act. The correspondent
of a Sunday paper described the strike as
“unusual.” It isn't unusual for Molong.
Early in 1914 I reached the town as one of a
touring Costume Comedy Co. Our show was
above the average, and in a tiny hall such
as Molong possessed, it was necessary to
charge 3s. and 2s. to give a profit. ' We
were duly warned that there would be a
strike, and a strike there was. I was the
pianist, and with the manager’s help
mapped out a line of action. The pro-
gramme started with the doors wide open,
so that the crowd could see enough to arouse
its curiosity. Then suddenly the doors
shut. This trick repeated once or twice
had the desired effect; one or two began to
waver, and then they nearly all decided
to give it a go. At half-time'all that were
left of the strikers came along and suggested
paying a bob for the last half of the show;
but it was still 2s. or stop out. They paid.
London is making its new theatre-suit
out of father’s pants. The turning of suc-
cessful old farces into up-to-date musical
comedies is quite an industry, and, appar-
ently, a profitable one. “Betsy,” by the late
Francis Burnand, one-time editor of Punch,
is now being made into a musical show.
“Betsy’s” new name will be “Oh, Don’t,
Dolly !” Little W. S. Percy is to be one of
the principals.
“Jeune Premier” : “The star can do no
wrong,” remarked Billy Majpp, the dresser,
to me. “Remember Washington, who came
here with ‘Hot-house Plants’? Successful,
he was, on and off! A lot of capital left the
country when he went back to America. I
dressed him. Nice fellow, but close. Not
exactly mean, but close. Still, an artist.
Everything had to be ‘just so’ on the stage
—real props. Real whisky-and-soda, real
champagne, and business was so big he
had carte blanche. You may remember he
smoked all through the play. Never without
a long cigar in his face. Those smokes
were the best brand obtainable. Wouldn’t
have anything else. Tolly, his manager—he
was close, too —used to come round to the
dressing-room every night for a chat. Wash-
ington never failed to offer the impresario
his cigar-case. Tolly always graciously
accepted one of the star’s Exquisitos. Regu-
larly every evening the boss got through one.
enjoying every bit of it. It was only when
he looked over accounts after Washington
had got back to the States that he kicked
himself. He then realised from the property-
man’s list that the money for the cigars had
come out of his own pocket!”
“Effem”: Disagree with “F.R.’s” judg-
ment (B. 9/l/’l9) that in the way of
theatrical entertainment Egypt is miles
behind any other country. My own (1915)
experience of Cairo movie shows, which
“F.R.” especially mentions, places the prin-
cipal ones at least equal to those in Sydney.
French and Italian films admittedly pre-
dominate —the superbly-produced and well-
acted pictures which Australians used to be
able to see before the film combine con-
demned them to an unrelieved menu of
Yankee stuff. Musically, the Gyppo shows
come first, the mechanical organ being merci-
fully unknown. “F.R.” speaks of the
sociability of the shows’ French and Italian
ladies. These sociable ones were met at
the Casino de Paris. My cafe chantant had
an air rather less Wazzirish, and in my
days was enlivened by a pallid, black-haired
Spanish comedienne who would have made
a name for herself if she had confined her
attention to one profession.
“Musketoon”: This cry is from S. M.
Herald :
Wanted, by Travelling Dramatic Company, heavy-
weight woman, any age; the heavier the better.
Duties pleasant, simple and light; no exertion.
Apply, stating weight to secretary, G.P.0., Sydney.
At explaining matters to wild hotelkeepers
the heavy-weight woman is a great asset.
We had one in a show I travelled with some
years ago.
“J.F.11.”: Theatre rents in London have
leaped up. The Strand, a hitherto luckless
theatre that has changed its name several
times, has been secured on a long lease by a
new combination embracing Arthur Bouch-
ier and George Grossmith. They have con-
tracted to pay £3OO a week. A couple of
years ago the place was going begging at
£7O.
HIS STRANGE DELUSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I walked in an asylum ground.
They instanced one to me
Who hid behind a little mound,
And spoke those lines, “To be,
Or not to be,” and mouthed each word
As though he dreaded to be heard.
They said: “He played some years ago.
Perchance you went to see,
And will agree he did not show
The least ability.
He seemed a creature made of wood,
His elocution far from good.”
“To hold him mad there is” I said,
“A reason yet to seek.”
The doctor sadly shook his head.
“The case is quite unique.
I’ve never seen its like, in fact:
This actor thinks he cannot act!”

The “ PLUM”
Razor.
One June morning in 1917, a week or so
after the capture of Messines Ridge, the old
square of Bailleul held a collection of Fritz
seventy-sevens, machine-guns, trench mor-
tars and other battle trophies. A company
of infantry in single tile stood guard round
the captured ironmongery. King George,
accompanied by the Prince of Wales and the
usual collection of red tabs, was inspecting
the exhibition. A crowd of soldiers and
civvies, which had gathered, included a
number of Diggers who were billeted in the
town. H.M. carefully examined a battered
gun, but the Prince showed a very mild
interest in Krupp’s handiwork and presently
caught sight of two smiling mademoiselles,
who occupied a box seat in one of the upper
windows of a house overlooking the square.
He returned their smile with interest and
blushed as much as the girls themselves.
The crowd was quick to note the position.
There was a ripple of laughter, which swelled
into a roar when a long, bronzed Digger
drawled: “Hey, Prince, that’s better than
what yer old man’s lookin’ at!”
“D.F.”: The S’African custom of shearing
sheep twice a year used to be practised in
the Speck occasionally. Lambs’ wool often
brought more than sheep’s wool; and
some enterprising sheep-men used to increase
the supply by shearing the sheep with 10
months’ ciothes on them, and then, a couple
of months later, harvesting a crop of lambs’
wool from the same beasties.
An English film just completed is intended
to rival the biggest Italian .and Amer Van
productions. “Nelson” has given employ-
ment to 6000 people (alleged), and the
Admiralty allowed the players the run of
the old Victory, with some of the actual
guns—not to be fired, of course —used at
Trafalgar. The play includes a spirited ren-
dering of that battle, and also brings in,
as companion pictures, the destruction of the
Spanish Armada, and the Vindictive’s raid
on Zeebrugge.
“Frank R.’s” yarn
Re “C. Coral’s reminder (B. 9/l/’l9) that Span-
ish relics are still scattered about the Great Barrier
Reef. At Mole Island, in the Whitsunday Group,
tlie remains of a ship said to be those of a Spanish
galleon lie buried in a mangrove swamp about a
mile from the beach. Only the prow and stern posts
are on view. The oldest Binghi on the island in-
formed me that the vessel was in the same spot when
ho was a child, and that scores of coins were
gathered by the tribe over 50 years back at a spot
nearer to the beach, where are the remains of an
old stone well which is believed to have been dug
by Matthew Flinders during his journey along the
Queensland coast. Another Spanish vessel is said
to lie half-buried in the sand near South Tree Point,
Port Curtis. It was at this spot that Joseph Wil-
mont, when surveying the site of Port Curtis in 1853,
feund traces of a supposed Spanish settlement. A
brass gun was apparently of Spanish make. Its
dimensions were: Length, sft. ; diameter, sin.; bore,
llin. An inscription on the barrel suggested that
the weapon was from the Santa Barbara. The date
was 1596, which made the gun the earliest Spanish
relic so far found in Australia. Some coins were
discovered on the Great Barrier Reef off Townsville,
by Yorkie, the hero of Banfield’s “Confessions of a
Beachcomber.” I did not see these, but prior to his
death Yorkie told me that they bore the date 1633.
Regally gorgeous in red and gold and

list —a handy idea.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : In the thirties
of last century Dr. Thomas Black was
practising medicine in Penrith (N.S.W.) in
a house still, standing. He had purchased
(at Sydney) some town lots in Melbourne,
and by and bye he removed to that settle-
ment. His half-acre was on the S.E.
corner of Collins and Swanston streets:
thereon he built shops and dwellings and
prospered. At dinner in Pine Grove House,
Richmond, where the doctor had as guests
William Highett, Hugh John Chambers and
It. McArthur, he bewailed the fact that
most of the banking business was done by
English institutions, and suggested the
possibility of establishing a purely Victorian
bank. The others encouraged him, so a
public meeting was held at the Royal Hall,
afterwards the Criterion, and now the site
of the Union Bank. Westgrath president.
Before the meeting closed all the shares
were taken up excepting 500. Money Miller,
who had been at the meeting, took these
though he had thrown cold water on the
scheme at first. The Bank of Victoria was
then launched. The next business was to
find suitable premises, and Dr. Black hap-
pened to have some of his houses in Swans-
ton-street vacant. These he knocked into
one, and the wily doctor drew £l5OO
a year for 11 years—until the bank moved
into new premises in Collins-street.
“EegeebeeOne of the latest little jokes
from the North is an alleged pen—cascade
variety-—old-style glass filler, the lot en-
closed in a small box with the following
libretto:—•
SHOW TO USE.
Use best ink for it. Beroi’se bnd one im'nrs its
pipe which coming ink. Carry in the pocket
And occasionally should be removed fill the holder
with water.
The pen was just like that. I gave it away
to a small boy I hate.
LIFE’S LITTLE TROUBLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She called me on the telephone:
“Is that you, Joe?
Well, lot us go
To-night upon our very own—-
Now, don’t you fail me, sir I
We’ll go to the old place for tea,
And then can’t hear?
It’s me, my dear”....
Just then they cut the damned thing off.
I heard a twice-familiar cough,
Was it the wife —or Her?

It has long been recognised that ordi-
nary belting is an unsatisfactory and
inefficient equipment for small diameter
high speed pulleys.
The stretch in most types of belting, particularly on
vertical drives such as are here shown, soon affects
the efficient service of the belt.
Goodyear Belts are so constructed as to reduce to a minimum all
danger of stretch, through the process of manufacture which they
undergo.
The special weave canvas duck and the superior compound
impregnating their every fibre give them exceptional pliability
coupled with extreme compactness and strength.
This was the reason for their installation throughout the plant
of Messrs. Thomas Murray Sons & Co. Ltd,, and this firm reports
that “Goodyear Belts have given uniformly satisfactory service
since the day they were put in.’’
All the shafting pulleys and machines in these pictures are
equipped with Goodgear Belts, which, on small pulleys as well as
large give a lower cost per 100 horse power transmitted, than
any other belt in the market.
If you have a power transmission problem let us solve it for you.

The soft, full-bodied shimmer of
Hose of Luxite is gained by the
use of rich, fine-stitched materials,
pure-dyed.
That is why its elegance and
beauty last through repeated wash-
ings.
The wide range of styles and

NOTIONS
“ON TOP” WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
These dreadful Diggers! After the Aus-
tralians had checked the rush of the Huns on Amiens,
a mob of them were resting along the road near
Villers-Bvetonneux, when a couple of Tommy gen-
erals who belonged to the army which had “retired”
very rapidly motored by. After the salute which
discipline demanded there came from the roadside
a cheery “Good day, Postfe!” “Good day, Donald-
son !”
“Eegeebee”: Wouldn’t be wasting any-
thing if Education Departments provided for an
occasional 15 minutes’ instruction on the child-eating
habits of sharks. The lad who died after being
terribly mauled in shallow water in Sirius Cove,
Sydney, the other day might have been saved by
a timely foreword. There have been too many
similar cases in the last 15 years. From early
December to April no one can take a risk in the
harbors or rivers. It is madness to suppose that
a shark never invades low water. Fishing up an
arm of Pt. Hacking (N.S.W.), off a sand flat, one
of the crew actually struck with an oar at a 10
foot brute who prowled into water that barely
floated us. 1 was one of the party who made a
permanent camp at National Park, about half a
mile below the dam at Audley. We swam regularly
every Sunday there during a whole summer with-
out thought of the risk. Going home one night,
we were joined at Como by a friend who belonged
to a picnic crowd a member of which had been
attacked and disembowelled that day by a monster.
A few days later, a quarter of a mile above the
point where we swam, a shark was caught, the
jaws, of which measured 134 inches across. He
was hooked in live feet of water, and at Newcastle
a few days ago one of the best swimmers on the
coast had his leg practically torn off in about
4ft. of water by a monster.
“Eddyson”: In those good old days the
Hunt Club had its h.q. at Ballarat, but the mad
pursuit of the herring-in-aniseed began at Yam. A
tremendous fellow witli a title and reputation as a
thruster was in Australia, and the Club arranged
a special meet for his benefit. The customary herring
was discarded, and an actual fox secured, for this
occasion only. It was carried to Brazenor’s hotel in
a carpet bag, and emptied out in the corner paddock.
The faithful hounds were unleashed, a trumpet of
Egyptian origin was sounded, and the sport began.
The hunt led out through Cardigan over some appall-
ing fences, and the visitor made breathless con-
fession that never in all his experience had he
known a fox put up such a performance. The
screaming pack swept into Haddon, and with a
compact and clamorous rush galloped up to Haron’s
gate, and pulled down Loo Me, the peripatetic fish
John who once a week tramped out from Ballarat
with two baskets of fish swung on a bamboo pole,
branching :off through the paddocks to do business
with casual farmers by the way. Loo Me was
grievously maltreated before the whips could get
up, after which the hunt preceded the chewed
Celestial to the Ballarat hospital in a depressed
condition. Loo was subsequently compensated by
the Club in hard cash. It turned out that the mis-
guided animals had been on the scent of the fish
John from the jump. The fox was found sub-
sequently in one of Brazenor’s bedrooms in the carpet
handbag in which_he had been conveyed to Yam,
curled up and peacefully sleeping.
“G.E. ”: The Melbourne Johns being par-
ticularfy alert in chasing the two-up school, the boys
have started holding Sunday betting parties on the
roadside, gambling on odds or evens about the num-
ber of the passing motor-car. In one of the suburbs a
local hairdresser used to stand outside his shop
between shaves and play this game at all hours of
the day with the local unemployed. There was plenty
of material, because nearby was a taxi garage. For
a long time luck served the barber well. Then it
didn’t —until he took a tumble. He discovered that
a client and a cobber in the garage had him
well trimmed by getting ready a list of the car
numbers in the order of leaving in the morning.
* * * *
“Bloggs”: The country just behind Yil-
lers Bretonneux narrowly missed what would have
been a unique sporting event last July. The major
of the 00th Battery, A.1.F., was a keen horseman,
and so were his subordinates. Wherever the 00th
waggon lines were there arose a more or less un-
surmountable collection of schooling fences. The
Major found mere schooling insufficiently thrilling
as a relaxation from life at the pits, and decided
to organise a Hunt Club. The hounds were ordi-
nary dogs—strays grabbed at random by a faithful
subaltern and interned by him till their hour should
come. Necessarily the hunt was to be a drag, and
a thoroughly sporting course was mapped out —once
round the big wood at the back of FrSchencourt
(taking in half a dozen sets of fences belonging to
various other units, British and Australian), in an
out between the trenches and wire to the Amiens-
Bapaume-road, and across it to Corbie. Then
delays set in. The subaltern in charge of the
hounds imperilled his reputation for efficiency, and
hence his entire military career, by losing the
animals as fast as they were caught. The aniseed
took a long time to arrive from London, and, when
it did turn up, it was found that the herrings had
been forgotten. Simultaneously the Big Push started
in earnest; three of the best horses in the battery
were lamed : the kennel-master was bitten in the
leg, and also threatened with a prosecution for
dog-stealing; two other subalterns got conspicuously
abraded faces, the result of falls; and the Colonel,
getting wind of the scheme, came out with a brutally-
brief order forbidding all unauthorised jumping and
galloping throughout the brigade “for the duration.”
“C.V.E.”: Nice chance of stopping Billjim
gambling aboard the transports or anywhere else.
Like “G.N.” (B. 9/l/’l9) I have seen two “trays”
spilled out of a dice-box in all kinds of military
camps and elsewhere; also I’ve seen three used to
save time, but this latter only amongst the A.I.F.
Sometimes the three are pitched in a new way
known as zwei-up—sudden death, straight heads or
tails; no ones. I came home on the Medic. After
the first pay-day there was the usual under-and-over,
erown-and-anchor, house (a game learned from the
Tommies), zwei-up, race-wheels, banker, pontoon and
seven-and-a-half (a great Italian gamble). The
deck officer, recognising the futility of trying to stop
the gambles, said, “Look here, lads ; there’s only one
thing for it —shell out for the Sports funds; so
much from each mob.” “Right oh,” chorussed the
players. There was no need to suggest that the
play should be straight. They’d see to that.
“Kerango” : Periodically, usually after pro-
longed dry spells, large numbers of saltwater fish
appear in the Fitzroy River (Q.) for a distance of
oyer 50 miles from the mouth. A while ago a party
or anglers fishing from the Rockhampton wharves
kept losing their hand lines, and the baits were
taken out of their dilly-bags which were left dang-
ling in the water. One wide-awake fisherman, sus-
pecting the presence of something extraordinary, sent
a shark-hook, and a few minutes later landed a
4001 b. fish not shark. The day following another
similar fish, though slightly smaller, was landed by
the same angler. More recently, a party, fishing
from a dinghy, tethered the haul at the stern of the
boat, when suddenly a voracious monster made one
bite and devoured the lot. Forthwith the party’s
lo r n,l St A ook wa ® baited ancl in a few minutes a
zAulb. fish was hooked. Numbers of anglers here-
abouts are prepared to bet that these monsters are
gropers; other swear they are rock-cod. Who’s
right ?

A WOMANS
LETTER
Small pudding-basin-shaped toques, in
which the most daring colors are flung
together, are matched by bags of the same
macaw tints. Oriental patterns of red and
blue, with the glint of gold embroidery, are
a sign of reaction against the sombre shades
of war time. Most of these bags—French
and unusual —are large and long and come
to a glorious end in bullion tassels. With
the velvet and fur toques go the new stoles
—also velvet and fur, or ditto and drenched
feathers. The “drenched” plume is frankly
ugly, but it is the last gasp in fashion, hard-
pressed for novelty. The soft and fluffy
curl once so carefully cultivated is destroyed.
This season’s ostrich trimming is flat and
straight—barring a minute crimping of the
desolated fluff—and looks like the lank
plumage of a bird that has been rained on
for 40 days and 40 nights-
Cricket, with Victoria’s new bowler
McDonald to the fore, has had a resurrection
on the Sydney Cricket Ground ; and there was
even more joy than at the opening of the
first yachting season since the war. The
mosquito fleet has fluttered like white moths
on the water front —unofficially—during the
four years’ stress. But a big day on the
green cricket-patch at Moore Park was an
event. In the crowd old hands recalled
legends of the team that formed the
first Australian eleven with Willie
doch, “Demon” Spofforth, Alec Bannermalf
and Dave Gregory in the list.
Mingling with the Victorian batsmen in
Sydney nowadays is E. H. Sugden, the
reverend principal of Queen’s, Melbourne.
Cheery, sunburnt, and with a blue-banded
straw hat on his head, he whiles away inter-
vals in the game with chatty reminiscences.
When the Southerners paid tribute to Victor
Trumper in Waverley Cemetery last week,
Sugden’s address made a special appeal to
the soul of the gathering.
Band contests, writhing day by day in the
Sports Ground, reached a crisis on Saturday
evening. Dolores and her shadow, Miss
Vaudour, were in the crush. Ipswich “Vice-
regal” band was then ahead, with a promise
to stay there. On Sunday afternoon Gov-
ernor Davidson, with Aide Stanham at his
heels, went to the same grounds to unveil
the extra panels of an Honor roll of 800
bandsmen’s names. Standing bare-headed
before the board his Ex. deftly pulled aside
the drapery and in sonorous voice addressed
the crowd. Then across a squally afternoon
floated the “Dead March,” played by massed
bands in the ring. When a lone trumpeter
sounded the “Last Post,” women’s eyes were
misty, and men bared their heads. John
Bowden, the adjudicator, who comes from
Victoria, took a prominent part in the after-
noon’s programme.
The handsome Monash dame, with only-
chick Bertha, leaves for the other side by
the Ventura in March. Bertha Monash lost
most of her curves working as a V.A.D. in
Melbourne. She invariably took the Martha
job of the hardest chores going. Scrubbing
was one of her lines. But the war is over.
Mother and daughter are more likely to
hanker for London than Jerusalem —in spite
of Zangwill’s desire to see their General as
the anointed Governor of Palestine.
Last Saturday his State Ex. had just
settled down comfortably at Sydney Cricket
Ground to watch Ma and Victoria resume
an old argument, when he had to rush away
to open up a new port. It was not one
of the harbors talked of in the Holman
Government’s strayed decentralisation policy.
The chief industries at Cronulla are surfing
and sunbaking; but the local people had
decided that they could catch an extra
tourist or two with an ocean wharf. On
Saturday, after the North Coast S.S. Co.’s
Orara had delivered the first load of passen-
gers, his Ex. carved* his wav through blue-
ribbon to the tea and speeches in the hills.
After his Ex. had had his say the Orara
saved the situation with a shrill put-to-sea
blast from its siren, so the sea-voyagers
seized their hats and left Governor David-
son to the mercy of the Shire Council and
local residents. On the way back to Sydney,
the Orara’s skipper, Captain Innes, glad-
dened the voyage with song. Regular
sailings are to be made to the popular sea-
side resort; thus opening up a new round
and ought-to-be pleasant trip.
The G.-G. chose Anniversary Day to hand
some military A.I.F. men their decorations.
But the hour was changed in consequence
of the Regatta fixture, and Aussies met in
the Domain soon after breakfast, and with
them some sorrowfuj mothers and fathers
to receive the honors that their boys, now
beyond recall, had earned.
Restrictions being still ‘“on, Melba s
friends, acquaintances, and admirers could
only press against the wharf barricade to
wave adieu the other afternoon, while
trusty messengers staggered up the side ot
the Niagara with loads of flowers. But
saying good-bye is sometimes a ‘ twicer,
as the schoolboys say. John Fell and his
two daughters went home to Lane Gove
again, while the Sonoma —which had re-
turned to port—had a wire pulled out of
her back-teeth at Cockatoo Dock.
Due shortly in Sydney en route to Mel-
bourne, Papua’s Lieut.-Gov ernor Murray.
With him is the son who, having waited for
his eighteenth birthday to enlist, was beaten
by the armistice. So that makes a change
of plans, and father will have to see about it.
Mrs. Thco Marks, with hair fashionably
blistered level with her ears, left by the
Mataram for Singapore, where she declares
she’ll settle. And probably take on fresh
matrimonial shackles.
A pretty little American bride has adopted
this sunny land and started house-keep-
ing convenient to the coo of the lion and
the roaring of the parrot at the Zoo. She
took pity on Dr. William Macdonald, an
Australian (son erf Neil Macdonald of
Neutral Bay), who was in charge of a war
hospital in Cairo for some time. The young
doctor is at present mostly engaged in ram-
ming the cure-all vaccine into Mosman folk
who queue up at the Town Hall of that
sea-pickled suburb.
Mrs. Kathleen Oldham, wife of the man-
ager of the Union Bank at Perth, who died
recently, was a grand-daughter of “old Jack”
Robertson, the Ma State’s picturesque ex-
Premier.
Miss Belle Collins recently completed 50
years with St. Mary’s Cathedral Choir. For
nearly as long as that the jubilean also
taught young Australia the three R’s and
its P’s and Q’s.
Dora Ohlfsen, formerly of U.S., is back to
her studio-work in Rome. She’s in the
throes of preparing an exhibition for some
distressed Italian war-fund.
Pianist Godfrey Smith, with his young
wife, has sailed for Jamaica, via America,
partly to collect baby Smith, who was left
some time ago in the care of grandma, while
the submarines were dealing out death. The
musician (not the juvenile one) fought with
a British artillery regiment in France.
In 1908, or thereabouts, Judge Backhouse
was chairman of the Anniversary Regatta
Committee. During
the war the historic
celebration became a
mere ghost of itself;
now the great revival
in sport since the
armistice finds his
Honor in his accus-
tomed place at the
Regatta lunch. But
(except when he
dons his wig in the
District Court)
what is his accus-
tomed place? Go to
a meeting of the
Dickens’ Fellowship,
a society which
clasps David Copper-
field to its bosom,
and you’ll find that
the benign president, who might be a slim
edition of one of the Cheeryble brothers, is
the same legal light whom you met the day
before in charge of a meeting for the Crown-
street Women’s Hospital. He belongs, as
a fact, to the committee of every second
notable charity in Sydney, and usually puts
up a record attendance. When a matinee is
worth while, his Honor is early in the d.c.,
for he has never taken with enthusiasm to
the vogue of the stalls. If the performance
lags or the waits are long, the book whose
corner was visible in a handy pocket is
pulled out. Judge Backhouse, an inveterate
reader, is secure against boredom. He has
been known to suddenly produce the same
antidote while driving with a party on a
holiday trip through the Blue Mountains’
most interesting scenery. One of the young-
est men of his age in this or any other
Australian town, he walks where others
jump into a tram or cab. The smile that
only comes off with difficulty, once beamed
on the Brisbane River. That was in the
’sixties, when a youth named Alfred Back-
house took his first lesson in water craft,
in a flat-bottomed punt. Boating is still his
favorite habby.
After 21 years or thereabouts on Hansard
staff, John Ramsay—an accomplished French
scholar, by the way—tucked his wife s hand
in his arm and set out via Vancouver for
London and daughter Isabel. The leave is
only six months long,
There’s an ex-Flag Lieut. R.N., now
Commander Seton, on the Jervis Bay Col-
lege staff, who is a member of the ancient
family which included Mary Queen of
Scots’ confidant in the long ago. A rela-
tive, therefore, of the Dr. Miles Seton whose
tragic end in London has stirred Melbourne.
“Vandorian” remembers seeing, as a child, a
manuscript score, so old that it was pro-
tected by a leather case, called “Mary Ham-
ilton’s Lament.” The plaintive dirge in-
formed the reader: —
Yestreen the Queen had four Marys;
The nicht she’ll hae but three.
There was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton,
And Mary Carmichael and me.
The late Harry Solomon Levy’s handsome
widow and his two dark-eyed daughters get
about equal helpings of the £151,712 on which
probate is to be paid. Like his late father,
a well-known figure in Macleay-street,
Harry Levy was one of the best citizens in
Sydney’s Jewish community.
The Romance of Trade is generally the
story of a boy who grasped Opportunity.
Left an orphan at
three, James Chalm-
ers, now a managing
director of Farmer
and 00., began to
earn his own living
at ten. The door
that led the way to
commercial success
was tonic sol fa.
A boy warbler in a
Glasgow Scotchby-
terian choir, young
Chalmers’s love of
music attracted the
attention of the
leader —a business
man connected with
the then most pro-
gressive firm in that
smoky city. “Even
looking back now to that big shop, says
the experienced Chalmers, “I can see how
wonderfully ahead it was of the times. Its
great frontage of solid granite, its tiled
floors, and later its electric lighting—the farst
in the business quarters of Glasgow—
were regarded as quite out of the common.
Into this flourishing firm, _ which dealt
chiefly in cheese, with groceries as a side-
line, I had the good fortune— through tonic
sol fa —to get a start in life.”
Sydney first knew Chalmers as general
manager of the Civil Service Stores, and
during that period (1886-1906) the Stores
expanded out of recognition. As a manag-
ing director of Farmers, he eagerly inquired
during two trips to U.S.A. into social wel-
fare work. Its introduction into the co. s
business —with Chairman Norman Pope and
junior director George Wright as enthusi-
astic co-helpers—was described last week.
Incidentally James Chalmers continues to
be an enthusiastic barracker for the tonic
sol fa system; and he is the president ot
the Phil/Society.
One of the well-known clan of the Ohio
(N.S.W.) sheepery, A. Nivison, has secured
a promise from Joan Fenwicke of the same
district.
The Anglo-Jewish V.C. Lieut. Keysor,
who won bis decoration with the A.I.F. in
Gallipoli, didn’t stay long in Sydney. The
Zionists in this town (who must _ have
known there was a girl waiting on a chstant
shore) gave him a wallet with £lOO
in it just before 1919 was born.
There was another little presentation at
at Civic Club the other day. The gallant
Hebrew returns to England to collect his
Best Girl and then comes back to Australia.
An interesting visitor to Sydney, Estelle
Reere, of Wellington, (M.L.), was a pupil
of Katti Banner, who trained Genee and
other celebrities. Apart from being a born
dancer herself, Miss Beere has the trick of
teaching her art, and many of her pupils
are starring in England and America. Last
week, in Melbourne, a little niece, _ aged
seven, appeared in “Goody Two Shoes” and
brought down the house. During a recent
visit to California Miss Beere was paid a
fee of £lOO by a number of millionairesses
to entertain their guests at a dancing recital
in the Golden Theatre of the Hotel St.
Francis. In Maoriland the lady has raised
close on £2OOO for patriotic purposes. One
of her brothers is Colonel Itawdon Beere,
a D.S.O. man.
Left Sydney for Egypt, Molly, a younger
daughter of Langer Owen, K.C. The young
man in the case is Captain Elliott, of the
Territorials.
Justice Ferguson, who often attends the
journalists’ lunches, will not give his plea-
sant countenance to this week’s welcome
to N. S. Wales Ptfess Delegates. _ The
popular legal light, having put aside his wig
for a motor cap, has gone south on a
holiday trip.
Palm Beach, the seaside resort which has
been blessed by our Most Expensive People,
is still crude and callow on the commissariat
side. Stores arrive at the shaky pier. Here-
on the Smart Set walks at its own r'sk (as
mentioned on a prominent Lotice) along a
couple of planks supported by piles of no
importance. Mrs. Flighty anxiously inter-
rogates the mariner on the vital question of
chops, and unwary males carelessly fold
their butter away in a blazer pocket, while
they lay hands on corn-beef Still, Palm
Beach is the fashion this year.
“Remnants From Randwick,” just hatched,
is to be the nest-egg of a fund to help bed-
ridden soldiers. The proceeds from sales
and advts. go to buy special beds for the
lads who may have months of weary invalid-
ism to face. How they face it —with the
Aussies’ dear old grin—is reflected in the
sketches and letteff-press in this collection.
It cost some trouble to produce. For months
artist Maude Russell, hon. manageress,
tramped the town seeking advts. and won-
dering what the baby was going to cost.
Then the Paper Controller suddenly loomed
like an unexpected policeman on the beat.
With the armistice, however, the hon. man-
ageress and the hon. editor emerged trium-
phant.
South Head, which in the war put on its
official military top-coat and became a full-
blown fortress, is asking old comrades of the
R.A.G.A. to give it a ring on the ’phone. In
some cases the microscopic green envelope
of the Telegraph Department will have to
be used. The Old Comrades’ Association is
arranging a re-union—possibly on August 2,
the birthday of the old N. S. Wales Per-
manent Artillery Regiment. It broke the
shell in 1871.
A Billions Club lunch in Sargent’s cafe
was splashed with the vivid red of Army
sisters’ capes the other day. After Arthur
Rickard’s eulogy, Matron Gould, once in
charge of Sydney Hospital, and before that
of P.A.H. staff, and one of the most brilli-
ant surgical nurses Australia had at the
Front, put in a strong plea for the Night-
ingales. Briefly, to talk less and believe no
scandals. Ship-board life has, of course,
been the fertile source of much idle gossip,
followed by protests from indignant Army
nurses.
The North Shore Hospital, which has had
pinching times the last four years, gets the
cash from the Mosman-Cremorne carnival in
the dawn of this week.
The French-Australian League—Mrs.
Joseph Playoust in the chair—re-opened its
hive after Anniversary Day. For many
weary months to come tens of thousands of
French orphans will be more or less desti-
tute. Australian kiddies who have adopted
those distressed infants (by proxy) are
asked to keep on plying needle and thread.
St. James’s fashionable congregation is
likely to have another soul-stirring sermon
or two from the eloquent James Cheong.
This Oriental light of St. Peter’s Church
(Melb.) is on a visit to Sydney.
The ugly hull of the Somerset, camou-
flaged to look like nothing on the sea or
under it, towered above the pontoon as flag-
ship of the Anniversary Regatta. An in-
formative programme mentioned that 1837
was the Regatta’s birth-year. With an
official invitation apiece, two presswomen
boarded the big steamer and had a quainc
experience. It lasted less than twenty
minutes—but will suffice a life-time. After
permitting a flagship vassal to take
away their tickets, they had no further
proof that they were not on board to steal
the oysters or run away with the soup.
A large and healthy individual with an
official badge eventually permitted the pair
to enter a sacred deck, whereon through a
latticed skylight, perchance, later on might
float the speeches of the male luncheon
party. But the lunch was not yet. By
way of putting in time, the wanderers
climbed an upper deck. No one intimated
that this was even more sacrosanct than
the lower haven. But the shocked ex-
pression and frosty eyes of the 0.8. E. group
on top of a perpendicular gangway ad-
monished the weary travellers that they had
forgotten their humble position in life.
Presently an admiral cautioned them off the
premises and they fled down the steep sides
of the Somerset and reached the shore with-
out being arrested as persons who might
have absconded with the ham.

There are Seven Senses to
THE LIGHT FOUR
THE LIGHT SIX
THE BIG SIX
THey are
Elegance .. . .. Like the highest-priced cars obtainable, these models retain their beauti-
ful distinctive lines without faddish or freakish change ; they have been
perfected from the best basic design.
Character Sixty-five years of organised efficiency and business success.
Silence.. The gear-box swung on a sub-chassis amidships in conjunction with
perfection of design of the famous I ..-head engine, all longitudinal
bearings, and the newly designed spiral beval differential —all integrally
exact in fit and motion.
Economy Zenith and Ball & Ball Carburetters that give a smooth, vibrationless
continuity of drive, and combined with the fact that the Light hour and
Light Six are lighter though stronger than ever before —power is
obtained with an absence of strain that gives true economy. The Big
Six is a magnificent luxury car and still of marked economy in its class.
Luxury .......... Length of wheel base and particular resiliency of the springs ; deep,
well-made cushions of soft leather ; plenty of room in front and tonneau ;
individual auxiliary seats.
Durability Absolute accuracy of all manufacturing processes, thus giving perfect fit,
alignment and balance, and reducing friction and wear to the lowest
possible point.
Accessibility Every part of each car has been evolved by years of experience and
concentrated study. Intense simplification of design has been the ami
of the makers with each new model, until now the function of each part
is so obvious and immediately accessible that these models are pre-
eminently suitable for the owner-driver.
All these models are specially equipped for Australia with high-tension magneto ignition and Goodyear Tyres.

Mrs. Cabena gave a tremendous party to
farewell the subdued Mrs. I’earce. It
began in the blue boudoir-rooms, out-
grew those apartments, migrated to the
council rooms for refreshments and then
rolled into a music room. Afternoon tea
was a hearty meal of several courses, spread
round an electrically-lit fountain. There
was a fine show of clothes. There are
a lot of soft-goods wives in the aldermanic
set, and The Lane was on parade. Mrs.
Cabena was in black and silver, and Mrs.
Pearce was dark-blue from turban to shoe-
tip. A bevy of the much-discussed Pearce-
lets were there. They are rather pretty,
black-eyed flappers. Of course the military
men’s wives came along for a last hand-
shake. The Monash dame and Mrs. Sell-
heim were in the van. All the Australian
Grand Opera stars twinkled and Gawd
Mayor Cabena hovered about.
\ The Union of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers
held an extra-special meeting and supper
at the Oriental Hotel to farewell Mrs.
Pearce —already farewelled to the point of
exhaustion. Mrs. Sellheim and Mrs.
Hughes (both wives of generals) were the
hostesses-in-chief. The Monash dame came
along looking like a poster-picture with very
black hair peaked into a Spanish comb above
a V of very white back and a lavender gown.
Mrs. Pearce muffled her neck in thick black
tulle above a black dress. Mrs. Hughes
was in black, and Mrs. Sellheim in military
grey and scarlet. A Pearce daughter got an
effect from scarlet shoes and white stock-
ings. The only men at the party were a
tenor or so.
The Charles Fairbairns, of Skipton and
South Yarra, have the right to raise three
rousing cheers, if they wish, because their
son, Major Osborne Fairbairn, has just been
handed the D.F.C. Another son, who spent
two years in Germany as a wounded
prisoner of war, came home by the Niagara.
Mrs. Marcel Crivelli, whose doctor-husband
toils at South Melbourne is back from
the U.S., whither she went to meet one
of her soldier-sons. Mrs. Crivelli took a
notable part in war-relief work here and
collected large sums, in cash and kind, for
the beneficent Societe Maternelle of France.
After a few days spent in adjusting the
covers in the parlor, Mrs. Crivelli will open
up a new subscription-list for orphaned
Pierre and his little sister Gabrielle.
Books and papers for invalid Billjim over-
seas are not plentiful enough to supply the
demand on the resources of the Bed Cross
Book Depst at Federal Government House,
wherefore Mrs. Cherry, the convenor of this
most blessed enterprise, is once more hoist-
ing distress signals. Billjim is still numer-
ous in the hospitals abroad, and the need for
large quantities of the right kind of material
is nearly as great as ever. Most Austra-
lian readers know by this time the sort of
stuff the Digger likes, so Government House
should soon be replenished.
William Oman, of Derrinallum, who for-
sook the gentle joys of life in the Western
District to seek a chance abroad of doing
his over-age bit, is about to return home,
having lately become a casualty while filling
his job in England as a tracer of missing
soldiers. Oman developed appendicitis
after the armistice was signed and the
necessary operation left him feeling ready
for a long sea trip.
Midshipman Geoffrey G. Carter, the son
of the tireless secretary of the State Service
Federation, had to swallow a luncheon and
a farewell speech from Premier Lawson last
week. The youngster, who has done rather
well at Jervis Bay, subsequently left with
several other middies to complete their
education on the ships of the Navy.
Everybody is seasiding at Portsea at
present. The golf tournament of the season
is being played there, and vies with the
pastime of dressing up for bathing parties.
Fashionable folk are stowed away in odd
corners, every inch of accommodation being
occupied. People not interested in golf or
swimming fill in time with social espionage.
Mrs. Miller, the handsome singing sister
of composer Clifton Boanas, has been
carried off to Fairfield Hospital with a
sudden attack of diphtheria.
Frank Hardyman, late of the Union Club,
has taken over the management of the
Grand Hotel, in place of Henry Holden,
resigned. For a long time he was assistant-
manager of Long’s Hotel, in Bond-street,
London. The old pub, which was celebrated
for its champagne-cup and its cock-fights,
had a strong literary interest. Both Thack-
eray and Charles Lever were very fond of
slipping it into their writings.
Major Billy Kent Hughes, a military
Rhodes Scholar, has written a gentlemanly
book about the work of the Light Horse in
Egypt and onwards. It is called “The
Modern Crusaders,” and is a faithful
description of the campaigning, with the
humor and blood left out.
Bob Cain just waited to settle up business
connected with his late mother’s estate and
then hurried off to his job in the British
army. Said that this best dresser will no
longer set the fashions on the Block as he
proposes to remain in the Fog.
Lieut. Phil Hudson, the young architect
who designed the new Geelong Grammar
School, gets back this week to his wife and
children after four years of war. On the
way home he was landed at the Cape from a
transport with an attack of pneumonia.
The widow of the late James Purves,
Iv.C., died last week in England. She jour-
neyed thither a year or so after the out-
break of war with her unmarried daughter
Eleanor. Since tlien two Purves sons have
been killed in action. Mrs. Purves, who was
a Brodribb, was the late lawyer’s second
wife. His first was a Grice.
The. census owes a lot to this charming
old lady with the white hair and the
pince-nez. She is
Sister Annear whom
innumerable Victor-
ian mothers have
found very handy
when the Stork has
been sighted. Sister
Annear, whose photo
comes from Ruth
Hollick, started giv-
ing a friendly pat to
the birth-rate as a
young probationer
in the maternity
ward of the
Women’s Hospital.
She spent half a
lifetime in that in-
stitution before she
brought her im-
measurable experi-
ence to the control of a scientific maternity
home where baby could arrive with the
utmost chance of survival. The gentle ex-
pert is still engaged on the good work and
recently confided that the number of young
Australians she has helped into the world
ran very close to five figures.
Major M. B. Ryan, of the Repatriation
Department, one of Melbourne’s eligible
bachelors, rubbed his eyes when he found
his name in a newspaper list of Marathon
passengers, “accompanied by Mrs. Ryan,
child and nurse.” The mistake arose
through the list being in alphabetical order,
and no initials were attached to the
lady’s name. Her husband is a naval offi-
cer at present attached to the cruiser Bris-
bane.
Dr- Charles Bage and his. wife are voyage
ing to England by the Marathon. Daughter
Jessie left Australia with the first group of
Vic. V.A.D.’s, and has just returned to
England after toiling in a Rouen hospital.
Some dinkum sky pilots have been brought
to light by the war. Presbyterian “Bob”
Rolland (“The Cocoa King” to Billjim) is
an old-time missionary who recently got a
well-deserved decoration. The latest
medalled padre is' the Rev. .J. J. Booth,
M.C., recently of St. Stephen’s Church of
England, Richmond, and now appointed to
St. Paul’s, Fairfield. He was attached to
the Bth Battalion, 2nd Brigade. His M.C.
was the result of a strong recommendation
for gallantry, and a subsequent unanimous
demand by his battalion for a recognition of
his wonderful work among the wounded
while aiding the regimental medical officer.
Adelaide puts it on the blackboard: —
The Westralian Excellency’s daughter, 'Miss
Macartney, passed through on Wednesday on her
way to Victoria and the Munro-Fergusons. She
stayed the night with the Moulden-Hacketts, and next
day motored to Marble Hill for lunch with Governor
Galway.
A list of meds. who have been in practice in this
State for 25 years or more puts Dr. J. Sprod at the
head of the list; his certificate dates from July,
1874. Next in order is popular Dr. J. A. G.
Hamilton (December, ’76). He, by the way, has
been in hospital undergoing an operation, but is
now recovering.
At its annual meeting on Monday night, the S.A.
branch of the Returned Soldiers’ League re-elected
Capt. Blackburn, V. 0., its president. Also, it an-
nounced a membership of over 5000, and gave a
list of the benefits it has helped returned Billjim to.
The intrepid G. H. Wilkins, of this State,
is the photographer with the Australian party
that has gone to Gallipoli to survey the Anzac
graves. His travels include three years with the
Stefansson Expedition in the North Polar regions,
and some war corresponding in the Balkan cam-
paign.
The S.A. Lawn Tennis Association is arranging
for a tournament on the Oval courts in the third
week in March. Poloists had their second game on
Saturday, with Mrs. R. M, Cudmore as afternoon-tea
hostess. Lacrosse, which has been dozing since
March, 1916, is also to be revived. And there
was a decorous rally of croquet players at the South
Terrace grounds on Thursday, when the Mayor
handed out the flags won in connection with the
pennant season that has just closed.
Just-home William Sowden, of the Register, was
lunched by the Commonwealth Club on Thursday,
with W. B. Wilkinson in the chair and Judge Gordon,
Charles Goode, E. T. Smith and Attorney-General
Barwcll among the guests.
Unley has decided to have a Garden of Honor
as a memorial to the local soldiers, and a committee
that includes Capt. Blackburn, V.C., Mr. Dollman
and D. J. Gordon has been formed to raise funds.
The Norman Murray who has been getting himself
into trouble by organising a ball in aid of sea-
men’s widows and orphans at Plymouth, is appar-
ently the enterprising soul who ravaged Adelaide in
1912. He called himself “James Cook, nephew of
the Rev. Thomas Cook, English evangelist,” and
managed to Cash 37 valueless cheques within a week
•—a really brilliant record. lie took his four
years’ sentence then as Norman Ramsay Murray.
His long list of previous convictions included one
for bigamy in Bananaland.
Somebody writes from Sydney assuring me that
late pianist Philip Laurance wasn’t related to
the Schomburgks, and “was never in Adelaide his
life.” I don’t suppose it matters now.
Sydney, having lately acquired Leon Gellert,
Adelaide’s best-known poet, is now taking also its
chief painter, Will Ashton. He is the son of
James, veteran seascape painter and teacher, but
Will has added European training to all that his
father could teach him. He has decided to take up
his residence in Sydney, and, with his family, is
overlanding from Adelaide by motor-car.
On February 16, Peggy McCormick, of
Warrnambool, is to be wed with Archie
McFarlane, of the same seaside town. Peg’s
late father (son of a Canadian C.J.) had a
brief but brilliant career at the Bar before
flinging aside wig and gown to try his hand
at squatting.
Wedded in the parish church of Totnes,
in Blighty, Roy Morell, Major and D. 5.0.,
son of the Morells, of Rose Bay, Sydney, to
lone Pole-Carew, of Totnes. Brigadier-
General Bishop Long, of Bathurst, with the
help of the rector, tied the knot. Major
Morell, who owns a squattage in Queens-
land, left as a trooper with the Light Horse.
His bride is related to the handsome General
Pole-Carew who married the equally hand-
some Lady Butler some years back.
Lieut. Gabrielle, son of the councillor,
has brought home a dainty little bride from
Essex. She is five-feet-nothing, and has
very shy blue eyes. The wedding was a
joyous military function, and Mrs. Gabrielle
is hearing the details while piloting her
new daughter-in-law round Melbourne.
Clayton, a small village on the outskirts
of Melbourne, is said to have mothered its
Billjims better than any other district in
the State. Largely
owing to the efforts
of Mrs. Will Whit-
bourn, here pictured,
every local Digger
and many a lad out-
side had to take
shelter from the rain
of comforts which
she and her associ-
ates have maintained
since the beginning
of the war. Mrs.
Whitbourn obtained
her ammunition
from concerts, socials
and bazaars. For
months before the
irmistice she or-
ganised an enter-
tainment about once
a fortnight, and in addition to chivvying the
local populace up to the pay-box she ush-
ered, prepared programmes and toyed with
the piano. Mrs. Whitbourn is the wife of
the comedian who was a Harry Rickards in-
stitution in the years behind, and William
(who dropped the surplus “o”) has occa-
sionally brought the burnt cork out of re-
tirement to help the cash into the hat.
For “Kigoletto” on Saturday night the
house was packed. The Princess now lights
its stalls with pink-shaded electrics. It is
kind to feminine complexions,. but cruel to
unpowdered bald heads. The young Aus-
tralian starlets are rapidly shaking off their
nervousness. Gertrude Johnson, a Mel-
bourne singer, made a sweet Gilda. Her
own black hair fell in two plaits to her
knees, and Mrs. Johnson, proudly perched
in the dress circle, guaranteed her daughter’s
locks in a stage whisper. Leah Meyers was
a pretty Maddalena. The boyish Lois as
the _ giddy Duke wore some lovely clothes.
White silk tights with black and gold tunic
slashed over white satin was only one of the
glories. And Slapoffski’s orchestra is a joy
in itself.
In the matter of presentation bouquets
there was marked disparity between the
reward and the performance. Gertrude
Johnson, who appeared as Gilda, was
nearly compelled to take cover from the
concentrated fire of chocolate boxes, posies,
floral monuments and similar frivolities.
Tenor Lois and the minor ladies also had
greenery growing around their feet, whereas
Filippini, who had played the biggest part
in the affair, was made the possessor of one
puny buttonhole. But little Filippini was
not allowed to go entirely unregarded. At
the end of his big scene in the third act
one of the ladies took as much of his ‘‘call”
as she could comfortably swallow', and then
graciously led him forward to get the rest
of it. Filippini’s gratitude for this service
was revealed in the mute expression of two
wavy eyeballs.
Percy Grainger has ceased to blow a horn
for Uncle Sam. He is demobilised and
plays on the concert platform in the mufti
of yore. Though alleged to be an American
citizen these days, Golden Locks is still
billed as the Australian composer.
Pianist Doris Madden has hurried away
to taste the acclamation of America. The
clever young musician intended to go earlier,
but an altercation with her appendix kept
her back a couple of boats and almost ruined
the arrangements for her triumphant entry
into the Noo Yark season. Her old teacher,
Leopold Goldowski, formerly of Vienna, is
extending a friendly hand to the exile.
Gertrude Johnson, a local principal of the
Rigo Grand Opera Co., gave a party at
the Lyceum Club last week. Many of the
opera singers attended, including the song-
birds from Sydney. The party, how-
ever, struck a snag in the shape of a
club, rule which forbids any singing. So
everyone stowed away music-rolls and swal-
lowed ices with a tragic air.
Melbourne singer Molly Carew (now Mrs.
Smith, of Cheshire, England), has been
composing songs. “April Is in Sight’ is
the latest, and Rosina Buckman, a big
success in London nowaday, is singing it.
While everybody is talking flumonia, ap-
pendicitis is ambushing unfortunates with
the old regularity. Two who were attacked
in a dark place the other day were Bob
Keers and Violet Collinson, the musical
director and principal girl of the “Jack and
Jill” show r . Understudies are filling the
gaps while the surgeons are making the
necessary repairs.
There is a wonderful girl in Durban.
For years she has met every Australian
transport and brought the men oranges,
cigarettes, papers, and so on. She doesn t
worry about the officers. If a ship is
quarantined she sends her gifts off on a
lighter, with an intimation that she will
do any shopping the men require. As a
shopper she is admitted in the A.I.F. to
be It. Now and then she writes verses.
For instance: —
And know I not Australia—as you say
I never passed that way, so how should I ?
Lad! I have seen in your young dauntless eye
The soul of your Australia far away;
And I have seen her giant mountain crag
Reflected in her mighty steadfast men.
What! aid you think to keep her secret then
For those who roam her hills and share her flag?
Vain thought t Her open-hearted men and free,
Uncurbed by sordid tyranny of class,
Give up the secret as their troopships pass,
And knowing them, I know what she must be.
And know i not Australia? Lad! I know!
She keeps no secret where her thousands go.
The girl’s name is Ethel M. Campbell,
and one soldier who orated about her never
got near enough to see her face. But he
became quite tiresome on the perfection of
her figure. As part of her self-imposed
job she has learnt semaphore signalling and
she stood on a rock sticking out of the end
of Africa flagging farewell messages as
the ship steamed away. Invalid signal-
lers on board agreed that in her speed and
angles she would be entitled to a job in any
army on earth.
It has always been a source of _ puzzle-
ment how such girls escape disillusion-
ment. The Sardinia inquiry in Sydney
goes to show that not all the Diggers are
plaster saints. They seem to have made
things hum, for example, in Miss Camp-
bell’s home town. And not for the first
time either, evidently, since one of her
poems is a rebuke to an alleged “Capetown
Funk,” who, forgetting himself momen-
tarily, had ventured a sneer at “an Aus-
tralian drunk.” The nurse, the Red Cross
girl, the Sister of Mercy have a side of
the male creature’s character forced on
them which is mostly withheld from other
women. But somehow they are the last
to wowse about it—in fact, it doesn’t appear
to even annoy them. Perhaps they have
an instinctive wisdom that enables them
to see through the tripleasantness down to
the essentials —the basis of what we call
humanity.

BOSTOCK’S—THE ECONONY SHOE POLISH
We wish to stress the fact that ECONOMY is one of the chief attributes of
Bostock Shoe Dressings. It is economical by virtue of the fact that it is more
than a mere polish.
Containing, as it does, ingredients which nourish and preserve the leather, it gives
longer life to footwear.
With the cost of shoes mounting
higher and higher, the daily use
of Bostock’s, with its leather-
preserving qualities, is particu-
larly desirable.

Fast times were put up in every event
of the A.J.C. meeting which opened on Saturday.
It is a matter of the racecourse. Randwick was never
in better order, which is to say that it is perhaps
the fastest course in the world to-day. And in addi-
tion there are few tracks outside the sodden ones of
Europe that knock a galloper’s legs about less.
Sydney Damsel (Bst. 21b.) took the Challenge
Stakes in hollow fashion. Palm Leaf (Bst. 61b.), the
second favorite, was in front half-way down the
straight, and Aries (Bst. 91b.) was still in the
running when the King William mare, in the able
hands of Albert Wood, made her dash. Simultane-
ously the race was over bar the shouting. Sydney
Damsel won by five lengths from Shell Shock and
Bimeter. Bala’rang ran a great race with lOst. 4lb.
U P-
The favorite, Zarabine, cantered away with the
Hurdles, jumping well throughout. Basil K., who
was conceding 111 b., might have been dangerous,
but he settled his chances by hitting the last fence.
Greek Fire blundered at the first fence, fell and
snapped his cannon bone, and had to be destroyed.
It was a tragedy. Not many better performers over
the sticks have been seen at Randwick.
The only other favorite to roll home was Phast
Boy in the January Handicap. Greg, heavily backed,
failed in the Trial Stakes, and Millieme, who was
carrying a lot of the public’s money in the First
Nursery, was beaten half a length by Nautch Girl.
Altogether it was just the sort of day on which
McNoses relies to chip off some of the time-payment
liability on the little home by the sea which he is
keeping together for his indigent old age.
Arch Marella, Sam Hordern’s great horse, won
the big race on the second day. He started co-
favorite with Greg, and his backers, not to mention
his owner, have a lot to thank Albert Wood for
one way and another. That experienced tradesman
noticed that one of his mount's plates was loose.
The field was at the post, but Wood calmly rode
back to the enclosure, had the plate fixed and
returned to the barrier. And he then proceeded
to ride a well-judged race and win by a length
from Phast Boy, who just beat Greg. The winner
was giving the placed horses 21b. over a stone.
Some handicapping!
Basil K. hit nothing in the Second Hurdle Race,
and jumping the last fence level with Zarabine,
beat the latter in the run home. The public piled
its cash on Zarabine on the strength of his Satur-
day’s effort, but there was a lot of money for
the winner.
Celano, a two to one favorite, took the Novice
Handicap; and Millip m e —backed down to five
to 2—the Second Nursery; but 15 and 20 to one
chances secured the High weight Handicap and
Phillip Stakes respectively. Altogether it was a
good meeting for the books.
The feat of the day was put up by Balarang
in the six furlong event. Carrying the terrific im-
post of lOst. 21b. he got going among the first and
gamely beat Fight Ever (7st. 81b.) on the post.
Th-ere is again talk of doing away with the
Tod Sloan seat on Australian racecourses. Of
course everyone recognises that the crouch minimises
the wind resistance, and it also gives a horse a
better chance to use his quarters. The great objec-
tion to it is that it is responsible for trouble at the
post. The boy has to hang on to his mount’s mouth
in order to stay on its neck, and the factor of
“hands” is consequently eliminated. No one who saw
Tod Sloan in his prime believed that his seat
accounted for all his success, or anything like all of it.
A seat almost as forward as Sloan’s was adopted on
occasion in Australia as far back as the early
’nineties —which was before Sloan had been beard of
It was practised by such good horsemen as Jack
Gough, “Squeaker” Thompson, the Delaney brothers
and Cecil Parker. Sloan paralysed the English
riders of his day because he ran his races from end
to end. Being a consummate judge of pace he
was able to do it and succeed. There is no reason
to think he would not have succeeded equally if he
had ridden with long leathers.
A number of Australian top-notehers ride with
long leathers, although they crouch during the race —
notably Albert Wood, Miles Connell and Bob Lewis.
But they sit back to finish and the number of
races they have won by vigorous work in the vicinity
of the post is significant. On the other hand K.
Bracken rides with a short stirrup. He wins a lot
of races, but, as in Sloan’s case, it is due as much
as anything to the brains and judgment he shows
through his races. In this page’s opinion the monkey-
seat might as well be dispensed with as not, inasmuch
as it causes fractiousness at the post, .its abolition
won’t make enough difference to be worth discussing
from the moment the barrier goes up. Champions
like McLachlan and Wood would continue to win
in their turn wherever they fixed their saddles, or
whatever hole they shifted their leathers to.

“J.”: Jack Rice is, as the Bulletin says
(16/1/’l9), “one of the best hurdlers seen in Aus-
tralia.” But he is only good in N. S. Wales. He
can beat pretty nearly anything at Randwick, but
a third,-rater can down him at Caulfield. The explana-
tion is that at Randwick they gallop by the right and
at Caulfield by the left. Jack Rice owing, it is
said, to his conformation, is exclusively a right-
hander. Lingle, on the other hand, while always
good in Melbourne, is almost ”seless in Sydney.
A marked peculiarity about the A.J.C.
judge is that, in a close finish, the outside horse
practically always catches his eye. He has been
judging racing at Randwick for 12 or 14 years and
during that time the number of inside horses to
get the decision from him in near things have been
infinitesimal. And yet there is no reason, other
things being equal, why insiders shouldn’t bring
off as many close finishes as the otherg. Since
the row over the misplacing of Panacre in the Vil-
iiers Stakes the belief of owners and trainers in the
A.J.C. man’s infallibility has sustained something of
a jolt, and their anxiety to see their representatives
on the outside —where the latter are trying—-is
pathetic.
* * * *
For years Sydney has had an unsavory
reputation for blank indifference to the sufferings of
its animals. The steep gradients make it a particu-
larly bad place for horses. Everyone has seen animals
struggling with loads that they were utterly unfitted
to draw. The remedy for it is a law limiting horses
of a certain weight to loads of a certain weight. In
addition to which shoeing with toe-caulkings should
be made obligatory for draughts working on steep
hills. The writer has often noticed horses with badly-
gored flanks owing to the chain-swivel attachments
on the traces having got twisted at the chain end.
On drawing attention to the matter he has usually
been offered a punch on the jaw, or something simi-
lar. It is an easily preventible and hence particu-
larly senseless cruelty. If the traces are twisted at
night in the opposite direction and hung up with a
weight on the end, the swivel at the same time being
well greased, they will lie flat next day.
The number of lame and worn-out horses to be
seen in Sydney streets amounts to a scandal. In
most other great cities —for example, London —the
driver of a lame horse is lucky if he goes a block
without being hauled up. The Sydney police don’t
seem to recognise a dead-lame horse when they see
one. There was a conference of metropolitan magis-
trates last week on the question of cruelty to animals
in N. S. Wales and they made at least two useful
recommendations —that the present penalty of £5
should be raised to £lO, and that those who “per-
mit” cruelty should be equally liable with those
who inflict it. It may be a sign that the conscience
of the community is coming to life on the question.
Meanwhile the local S.P.C.A. is struggling like
mad to buy a couple of motor-cycles, with trailers,
wherewith to pick up starving and diseased strays.
And the Society also wants money to cope with
flagrant cases of cruelty to horses. It is a great
work and a needed one, and anyone who feels in-
clined to push it along can do so by sending a dona-
tion. however small, to Mrs. Hevdon, Warren Flats,
Potts Point. In the whole of last year a _ not un-
kindly, but merely unimaginative, community, sub-
scribed only £2OO to this cause.
At the Anniversary meeting the usual batch of
pig-skin artists were dealt with by the A.J.C.
stewards for alleged malfeasances. Suspensions from
riding for from six months downwards were dealt
out and nobody murmured. Even admitting the
recognised fact that the A.J.C. Committee is com-
posed of straight men, most of whom know the
racing game from A to Z, the power which they
wield and freely exercise over the livelihood of
trainers and jockeys seems excessive. Cragg was
debarred from the exercise of his profession for
six months for “carelessly riding” Goonangledlue
and contributing to Greek Fire’s mishap on Satur-
day. Cragg might have been “careless.’* But
imagine the infernal row there would be if a
wharf-lumper was ordered to desist from lumping
for the rest of the summer because he had dropped
a lump or two of coal on a companion, or into
the harbor. Picture the attitude of the Waiters’
Union if a member was warned off all restaurants
for eight weeks for opening a bottle of champagne
down Rupert Clarke’s back. There are lawyers and
other professional men on the A.J.C. Committee.
Lawyers, like Homer and others, nod now and then.
But they would strongly resent being presented with
months of forced idleness for a mistake in the
arguing of a case. And so would any other pro-
fessional man.
Arbitrary power in the hands of an irresponsible
body is always liable to abuse. The English
Jockey Club, on which all other jockey clubs are
modelled, is like the A.J.C., composed of the best
elements in local racing. But it has been guilty
of some queer injustices in its time. The warning
off, for life, of Tod Sloan on the alleged grounds
that he had backed his own mounts, was an in-
stance of what we should nowadays call Prussianism.
The decision ruined Sloan in the hey-day of his
riding career, since it carried weight on every
respectable track in the world. The offence alleged
was as common 20 years ago as it is to-day, when,
if every betting mannikin met his deserts, racing
would have to stop while a fresh school of horse-
men was trained. There was no suggestion that
Sloan had been other than a trier in every race.
The Jockey Club’s real objection to him was not
a matter of his riding at all; but of his social
habits. He lacked deference to his “betters.” He
put up at the Savoy, and lunched and dined in
the same restaurants as his patrons. The Committee
of the National Sporting Club had precisely the
same objection to Tommy Burns when he first burst
on London, and it would have disciplined him as
drastically as the Jockey Club did Sloan if it had
the power.
As an example of local arbitrariness •or perversity
or whatever one may call it, L. Want, the trainer,
was warned off by the A.J.C. five years ago. The
girth of one of his horses was found to have been
cut. There was no evidence that Want had done
it, or that it had been done by his orders. There
■was evidence that he had backed the horse to win.
He has always denied any knowledge of or com-
plicity in the matter. Some time back he was
promised a renewal of his license, and in due
course it came along. It proved to be a “second-
class license” ! A license, that is to say, which
does not permit him to train at Randwick, and
which, to a trainer of his class, is consequently
useless. It may all be strict equity. But, again,
it may not. In a small Star Chamber the presence
of even one ill-wisher or one fanatic on a point
of social or racing deportment is enough, often, to
produce a decision which may bankrupt the person
decided against. The present system of racecourse
governance has worked fairly well in practice in the
past; but it is wrong’, not to say rotten in
principle, and scores of injustices have arisen from
it and continue to arise from it.
* * * *
The first day of the N. S. Wales v. Vic.
fnatch was a lesson in how not to bat. The big
crowd was cheerv, but at the same time barr ickish,
and it had an unnerving effect, with the result that
play at the wickets was of the hit-or-miss style.
Of Victoria’s 125, V. Ransford scored 53, E. R.
Mayne 32, J. Keating 11 and Sundries 10—the
other eight wickets amassed 19! N. S. Wales was
routed for 86. The rate of scoring was atrocious.
Victoria’s 125' took 125 minutes; and at one
time N. S. Wales poked about for an hour for 50
runs !
It has to be admitted, however, that the bowling
was great. In E. A. McDonald, Victoria has one of
the best bowlers it has evolved for a quarter of
a century. He took eight for 42—-and in six
of them he hit the stumps. Scott, of N.
S. Wales, got four for 19. The two whirl-
winds are widely different in physique, style and
delivery. Scott is stocky; McDonald tall and
wiry. McDonald’s sufe-
footedness and clean
over-arm swing attract
more than the methodsi
of Scott, whose crouch.
causes him to lose
height. Neither makes
the ball “fly” as Ernest
Jones (S. Aus.) and
“Tib b y” Cotter
(N.S.W.)" did, and
neither possesses the
command of direction
which Jones had at his
best.
Wicket-keepers A.
A. Ratclifle (N.S.W.)
J. Hvett (Vic.) per-
formed well in their
different ways. Rat-
eliffe is cat-like, and
on Saturday stood up
to everyone but Scott.
Hyett is too weighty
to chase the flying
wide, or anvthing that
looks like one, and he
doesn’t inv'ite the
tomb bv standing close
up to the thunderbolts
of McDonald. Yet few
pass him.
McDONALD ( Vic.)
who took eight
wickets for 42
against N.S.W.
In the second innings Vic. shaped better with the
bat and accumulated 346. That left the Ma State
with a deficit of 385, and when Noble fell to Iron-
monger for 7 the outlook was blue. Bardsley fol-
lowed and hit up 49, and Kippax 45. Then left-
hander Bogle strolled in and added 145 before Keat-
ing found the sticks. Andrews obliged with 112, and
finally N. S. Wales adjourned to the refreshment
room to celebrate a victory with 6 wickets and
2 runs to spare. Vic. bowler McDonald proved a
dud in the second innings, 0 wickets for 102.
J. L. Keating (Vic.) made his 154 in the
second innings with the coolness of half-a-dozen
veterans. He plays for Collingwood when he is at
home, and this is his first year in Australian cricket.
Ransford showed his old-time form throughout. Ten
years ago he was one of Australia’s best, and he is
the only Victorian who ever made two centuries in
a match v. N. S.\ Wales.
Jack Scott dropped out during the match, and he
will play no more big cricket. Synovitis, or water
on the knee, is his trouble.
* * * *
Sid Godfrey and Sam Saunders were
originally billed to assault each other at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night for the featherweight
championship of N. S. Wales. Both of them, how-
ever, stepped into the squared circle well over the
necessary poundage. They struggled violently over
20 rounds, and at the finish the referee laid his hand,
as though in benison, upon the bowed crest of God-
frey, and the crowd remarked, as it bolted for the
trams, that there was nothing much wrong with the
decision.
Jack Cole was all over Hilt at Sydney
Stadium on Monday night. He smote Hilt about
the body with violence, and upon both sides of the
jaw, and upon the brow. Hilt tried to parley with
the enemy by means of left jabs, but it was no
good. In the sixth round Cole delivered an unen-
durable wallop in the neighborhod of the point, and
halfway through the next session the referee stopped
the massacre. Cole thus becomes middle-weight
champion of N. S. Wales, for what the distinction
is worth.
» * * * *
A sporting Yankee paper has half a dozen
photographs of what it calls “ambitious young
boxers,” and amongst them is Australia’s disre-
spected old acquaintance Jeff Smith! Jeff was a
great middleweight eight or ten years ago. But
he lacked what the Digger terms “guts.” He could
do anything but stand up to punishment and to
avoid it he fouled Darcy. Smith has no hope of
exploiting such ambitions as he may have left in
Australia.
Amos Murrell, of Blackbutt (Q.), came to
Brookvale, which is a bush suburb of Manly, last
week in quest of a man’s sport. That is to say, he
turned up to woodchop Hoy McMillan and Tom
Cooper, who are N.S.W.’s South and North Coast
champs respectively. Peppermint logs 47 lin. in
girth were trimmed up, and Murrell won in 51sec.,
with the others a dead-heat 11 sec. behind.
N.S.W.’s Anniversary Regatta occurred
on Monday. About the only blot on a perfect day
was the discovery by Judge Backhouse that N. S.
Wales’s birthday synchronises with that of the ex-
Kaiser. There were sailing events for every sort
of small craft that floats; and there was a blind
soldiers’ skiff race—won by W. Carruthers, M.M.,
D.C.M.
Major A. G. Moyes, M.C., intends aban-
doning his medical course at Adelaide Uni. and
taking up apple-growing in Victoria. His orchard
is only about 25 miles from the city, so he will be
able to play cricket for the Melbourne club.
The starts given in the swim-through-
Adelaide have been cut down latterly, and this
year’s event was won for the first time by the scratch
man, Beaglehole of Wallaroo, who made the fastest
time in the Grange-to-llenley swim the week before.
In the fresh water he covered the 1 mile 200 yards in
29rnin. 3sec. The race is swum up stream (not that
there is any stream in the Torrens at midsummer) ;
thus the bunch of competitors—7s, including one
, girl, the Henley winner-—had plenty of room at
starting from the weir, and were strung out before
reaching the Zoo. It was. a great finish between
Beaglehole', Cobbin and the veteran Moon. Spencer
Major, also of Wallaroo, reserved himself for the
S.A. half-mile two days later, and won it, in a
bath with 26 turns, in 13min. 51see., from Suhard
and Moon; Beaglehole unplaced.

An old aquatic identity, “Loo” Bennett,
late of the Lands Department, died a few days ago.
He was one of the founders of the Sydney Rowing
Club in 1870 and was in its first regatta, held the
same year.

The question has been raised at Albury
(N.S.W.) whether it is legal to use the aeroplane
spinner with its three hooks combined as one. The
local Angling Club has debarred members from em-
ploying it, and the local police intend to test its
legality. Users of this bait have been catching more
fish than they can carry home, and one enthusiast
has been fattening his pigs on Murray cod.
A curious boast of the Onkaparinga Rac-
ing Club (S.A.) has long been that it holds only one
meeting a year, on Easter Monday, though that one
has been worked up to a level with any of the city
meetings. The Club, however, when meeting to
arrange things for the coming Easter, showed a
strong inclination to arrange a second day, probably
for November, when there is very little racing fn
Adelaide. If it is arranged, it will probably, like
the existing day, have' a steeplechase as its leading
feature.
“Ingelara”: Best betting system I ever
struck was invented by a Riverina boy a few years
ago. Every Saturday afternoon the sports of the
town foregathered in a quiet place and illegally
invested their week’s wages with Ike on city
events. The latest scratchings and prices were re-
ceived by wire and displayed on a board when the,
local Hops were not about. The bookmakers took
bets right up to the time they received the results
from the telegraph office. The bright punter formed
a partnership with the telegraph boy, and got the
winners signalled from the two-storeyed p.o. a good
five minutes before Ikey Mo received the news from
the leisurely messenger. He had a nice banking
account by the time Ike found out. Then the furious
Jew had the boy sacked and took in the punter as
an assistant.
THE SEASON OPENS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[ Translated from Der Berliner Bolshevik-Tage. ,
The local Bolshing season opened yesterday at dawn,
And all our leading sports were soon at work:
The covers in the Konigs-platz—the gardens, park and
lawn,
Where bourgeois, male and female, often lurk —
Were flushed by eager Bolsheviks who used a 12-
pound shell,
With which they gave their human prey, to quote
their own phrase, “Hell.”
Some pretty right-and-lefts were got with hand-
grenades and bombs,
About the Kreuzsberg and the Schlossfreheit;
One shell dropped fourteen kennel-men, ten dachs-
hunds and some Poms
In Ilegel-haus, the home of Count von Bleit.
The Count, annoyed, protested, thereby bumping on
a snag;
It took but one revolver-shot to add him to the bag.
The children in the kindergarten, near the Potsdam
Gate,
Gave sporting sentiment a nasty jolt;
They clung together, weeping, in a panic-stricken
state,
And simply could not be induced to bolt.
Herr Blut at last lost patience and, proceeding to
a wood
In which a small machine-gun was, he dropped them
where they stood.
As evening fell the Bolshers hurried gaily home once
more,
Past barricades and other signs of strife,
Occasionally pulling up to batter in a door,
Or plug a fleeing burgher or his wife.
With gladsome “Hoehs” ! and Hymns of Hate, each
man then made his way
To bed, to dream of further sport on the ensuing
day.

YOU’D BE AN EASY MARK FOR A
SCIENTIFIC BOXER
bcause you’re inexperienced and untrained. You’d be flurried and excited,
and consequently leave openings which would enable your opponent to
“deal it out” to you. His scientific knowledge would enable him to
draw you on. He’d be calm and collected, and make every blow leave a
mark. YOU’D be unable to pentrate his defence, and have to suffer the
humiliation of being defeated—possibly by a smaller man.
There’s no excuse for you not knowing how to box—l can teach you
in your own home.
y My Postal Course of Boxing

the rapid progress they have made under my tuition.

To think of the songs I had sung;
They used to think I was a wonderful one
Because I could sing when everyone was( done.
Well the singing I used to do a bit,
Now sometimes they used, to do a quit;
Thinking now I was badly hit,
Away I would go, and quietly sit.
Into the woods until I was well and fit,
I used to have the birds as if in a fit.
They used to hover around using all their wit,
From branch to branch they used to sit
To listen to me the birds used to note,
Because I was there well in,the joke;
I used to send my voice as one of their notes,
I was doing well making pound notes.

ing and stop borrowing ?.... Laurie T.: Fumbling
adaptation of an old smoking-room yarn. .. . J.L.H.:
When you’re older in sin and journalism you’ll know
better than to send a jokeless drawing with a pen-
cilled memo on the back: “Letter under separate
cover.” The letter and the drawing may never meet.
And always there is Webster between you and the
office.
Australia had a proud idea that it had
invented every possible sort of paid job.
But it hasn’t. The Bolshevik Commissaries
of Free Love, who supervise the nationalisa-
tion 'of Russian women, represent a sti-
pendiary billet that is new to us..
Poland opened its new career with a row»
of course, but the two chief contestants,
Paderewski and General Pilusudski,
have come to an agreement which “it is
hoped will last until the Assembly meets.” It
is memorable as one of the few occasions
when two Poles have agreed temporarily
about anything.
In 190 G the S. Aus. Assembly empowered
the Tramways Trust to sell electric current
for power and lighting to the corporations
and district councils constituting the Trust.
But the Leg. Council struck this provision
out. mostly for the same old sinful reason;
so that at the present time, although the
corporations and district councils are held
responsible under the Tramways Act for any
deficit, they are not permitted to buy elec-
tric current from their own electric power
station and so help to avoid a deficit. The
Adelaide City Council has just appointed a
committee to consider the future lighting of
the city in view of the fact that the coun-
cil’s contracts with the Gas Co. and the
Klee trie I ight Col expire in 1919 and 1920
respectively. It is safe to say that if one
system was made to supply current for the
tramways and for power and lighting, the
arrangement would result in a reduction of
charges and probably a reduction of taxes
as well. It is of the greatest national im-
portance that power and light shall be sup-
plied at the lowest possible prices; but it
doesn’t follow that the Leg. Council sets
rational gains above the welfare of a few
light and power shareholders.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY is a most beautiful and complete link with the glorious
past, round which most great events in England’s history have centred, and it is
fitting that every approach, whether from the Embankment, stately Whitehall,
Old Palace Yard, or Victoria Street, is through broad and spacious thoroughfares,
excellent for vehicular traffic and delightful for motoring.
But for all roads the tyres should be Avons, which are built for speed, resiliency and
durability. '
Fit British AVON Tyres—Seven types to choose from:
a weight for every load and a tread for every road.

Henry VII. made some notable
additions, including his famous
Chapel, a perfect specimen of

All our kings, from Harold and

Abbey, and many

poets, statesmen,

SUFFERED WITH
PIMPLES 4 YEARS
Also Blotches On Face. Caused
Disfigurement. Cuticura Healed.
I suffered withpimples and blotches
on my face. I had it about four years
and in hot weather the pim-
ples became very irritating.
Generally they came to a head
and festered. These pimples
caused a good deal of disfig-
urement at times and when I
' perspired they smarted a lot.
“I then sent for Cuticura Soap
and Ointment and found they afforded
me great relief and in a few days
the pimples were entirely removed.”
(Signed) S. Flood, Ethel St., Harris
Park, N. L. W., F«b. 6, ’l7.
Keep your skin healthy by using
Cuticura Soap daily for the toilet, and
Cuticura Ointment for first signs of
pimples, redness or roughness.

Puts New Life
Into Your Motor Car
THERE is nothing so annoying as en-
gine trouble, and 80% of it is caused
by Carbon. That knocking and loss of
power, extravagant use of fuel and slow
response to the throttle are due to just one
thing—carbon in your cylinders. Clean
them out with
i
h Remove
and your car will run as it did the first month—
quietly and full of life.
Five minutes’ time is all it requires. Simply
pour an ounce of Carbon Remover into each
cylinder through the spark plug opening. Allow
it to stand 30 to 45 minutes. Then start your
engine and watch the cloud of carbon come out
through the exhaust. You can minimize carbon
accumulation by adding
4 ounces of Carbon Re-
mover to each 10 gallons
of petrol you use.
Safe and Guaranteed
Johnson’s Carbon Remover is
excellent for any type of engine.
It cannot injure the metal in any
way, does not affect the lubrica-
tion or injure the oil in the crank
case. Thousands of letters in
our files bear testimony of the
wonderful results obtained from
Johnson’s Carbon Remover.
Buy a trial tin from your dealer.
Ask him also about Johnson’s
Prepared Wax, a beauty polish
for your motor and Johnson’s
Radiator Cement for leaky radi-
ators. If you have any difficulty
in obtaining Johnson’s Products
write to us.
S. C. JOHNSON & SON
319 Kent Street, Sydney, N.S.W
The Port Phillip pilots lost one of their
venerable members when Captain David
Doughton went aloft, at Williamstown, after
65 years on deck. He retired from toil two
years ago, after coaxing ships up and down
the Bay for 26 years.
“Volt”: Apropos recent deaths from light-
ning, don’t fear being struck during rain.
You may, of course, be outed, but the odds
against it are very long. The dangerous
time is during a "dry” thunderstorm, before
or after the rain has fallen. Lightning de-
sires above all things to “earth” itself;
water is a conductor; and when a flash
drives into a shower it is split up and dis-
tributed among the wetness.
“Trooper Bluegum”: It was worth com-
ing to the war to see the Australians ride
into Damascus. Each trooper had a
German revolver at his belt and a German
cigar in his mouth. At a dozen depots
the Turks had abandoned tens of thousands
of pounds’ worth of loot, to say nothing
of guns, rifles, and such truck. Some of
it will get to Australia, if we have any
luck.
William Calder, chairman of Vic. Coun-
try Roads Board/ lately had his salary
raised to a thousand. He had been engineer
of Prahran for many years when in 1913
he just managed to beat G. Ivermode, of the
Public Service, for the new job. Calder
had a hobby for municipalising things, and
while rubbing along on a salary rising from
£3OO to £625, earned a profit out of various
industries which look pretty sick now that
he has departed.
James Morris Morgan, American Consul-
General in Sydney for some years, lately
brought out an autobiog., “Recollections of
a Rebel Reefer.” A remarkable man is
James M. Morgan. Born in Louisiana in
1545, he entered the American Navy in 1860,
but left it on the outbreak of the Civil War
and joined the Confederate cruiser Georgia,
whose mission was to destroy Federal
trading vessels. He claims for the little
Confederate fleet that it was the first to use
torpedo-boats, submarines and mines in
actual warfare. After the war and the
surrender of the South, Morgan had further
adventures in Egypt, Mexico and other
places, but finished up in smooth waters
as bank manager and consul.
Lieut. F. D. Rose Price, youngest son
of Victoria’s fiery. Colonel “Tom,” has fought
over a good part of Africa and found it a
wonderful country for pests. In a Septem-
ber letter from Dar es Salaam (East Africa)
he writes:—
The campaign still goes on in wicked country—
bush and more bush, and every known hardship.
Everything that crawls or flies in German or British
East Africa either lays an egg in one which develops
into some beastliness or stings one badly. All
, bushes have thorns pointed the wrong way and all
barbed.
The Creation was a rush job and Providence
evidently hadn’t time to take all the pins out.
From Italy comes word of the courage of
Flora Millard, a Sydney girl who went to
the home of song to study. When the
dread ’flu’ commenced its ravages she vol-
unteered tc nurse Italian soldiers in Tras-
tevere. The hospital conditions, owing to
overcrowding, were reminiscent of the
Middle Ages, but for weeks, while trained
nurses were daily collapsing from fatigue,
the plucky Australian stuck to her task.
She pulled through, too.
“E.S.S.”: Why people in this country
cling to English oak as the finest furniture-
wood in creation is a marvel to me. There
is nothing handsome about it when com-
pared with Australian silky-oak, tulip, red
and black bean, golden cedar, maiden’s blush
and many others, including even stringyr
bark. Some of these, if not all, are the
handsomest woods that this old earth has
produced—and most of them have been used
for firewood, or simply burnt off by the
acre to make room for grass. I had hoped
that the scarcity of shipping would have
given our timbers a show to assert their
merits, but evidently everybody has been
waiting for the oversea lumber tubs to re-
sume business.
“Simon”: Reincarnation cannot be much
more difficult than it is for an Australian
manufacturer, once having done business
with retail houses, to get a footing with
the big wholesale firms. The polite de-
partmental head always informs the rep-
resentative that he is regarded as a com-
petitor. On rare occasions his word is
suspiciously taken that he has changed over
entirely to the wholesale. But it’s no use.
The first suburban mercer who is pressed to
buy a line of shirts or something is sure
to excuse himself by saying that he has
just opened a large delivery from Stripe,
the maker. Untrue, of course; but it’s no
use Stripe trying to get an order in the face
of a statement like that.
“0.L.” : Gloomy prophets, foretelling con-
tinued high prices in the Australian timber
markets owing to the smallness of importa-
tions from abroad, evidently know nothing of
the activities in the overseas trade. High
prices continue and apparently are to con-
tinue indefinitely ; but it isn’t because of short
supplies. During the fortnight ended
December 11 four vessels delivered nearly
five million super feet of American timbers
at Melbourne alone. If Australian hard-
v. oods remain excessively high-priced during
post-war building operations, it will mostly be
because the Timber Merchants’ Association is
out after all that its members can get. They
are still keeping up the prices of Australian
woods, claiming in the face of the available
evidence that their business is an unprofitable
one. One or two independent traders are
still on the job in Melbourne, in spite of
all possible discouragement from the ring,
and they are able to keep their rates con-
siderably below those generally prevailing;
while the few independent sawmillers in the
bush, when they can get their stuff over the
roads, jire able to supply hardwood building
lengths at a tremendous reduction on Mel-
bourne merchants’ prices. The Association,
however, doesn’t worry. Timber, on the
whole, is up, and is going to stay up.


The NEW EDISON
has superior musical qualities.
The production of The NEW EDISON marked
the attainment of the great inventor’s almost
life-long ideal —to give to the world an instru-
ment that would not only reproduce the human
voice, but would absolutely “ re-create ” it,
even to the minutest overtones.
Thousands of musical experts, who have had
The NEW EDISON demonstrated actually
beside the living artist, declare that the “ re-
creation ” and the singer’s voice are as one —
that the difference cannot be detected.

Loyalty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
not the servile service bondage brings
I To grovel at the feet of majesty.
It is the essence of nobility—
The soul; the spirit in its triumphings
O’er pain and woe and all ignoble things.
It equalises all, or bond or free,
For pride of birth and lineage of kings
Were dust and dross, unblessed by loyalty.
It is the power that ever guards our shore—
The might that masters earth, and air and
wave,
And makes them void of terror to the brave.
It is the bloom that blossoms evermore
In scarlet splendor on the field of war,'
And plants a rose on every nameless grave.

Duggan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DUGGAN was a hard man.
The Munhoey district knew it;
the Munhoey township knew it; the
absent owner of Munhoey estate knew it; so
did Duggan’s wife and children.
lie spared no one, neither himself nor his
family, nor the men lie employed. From
each was expected the full pound of flesh.
But he had one weakness and that was his
love for the Munhoey sheep. For fifteen
years he had introduced new blood into and
weeded out and watched that flock till the
time had arrived when Munhoey stud-sheep
held their own against all comers, and re-
peatedly Munhoey wool topped the market.
It was not merely a pride in success, a
desire to excel, for in Duggan’s somewhat
cramped brain was a genuine love of the
sheep, coupled with great knowledge.
To a disabled crow-harried ewe he would
exhibit a patience and tenderness that he
would never have shown his wife; and one
year he had taken far more interest and
pride in a forsaken lamb that had absolutely
refused to die and had brought itself up
than he had in his eldest son’s scholarship.
The boy might be brilliant—they told him
so, anyway; but the thought that obsessed
him was that the lambing in the long
paddock that particular season had been
ninety-five per cent.
Then came the big drought.
Day by day, week after week, burning
sun, scorching winds. No grass, no relief
countrj to be had, and the stock too weak
to move even if it had been obtainable.
Duggan seldom spoke. All day he slaved
and directed the hand-feeding, the cutting
of she-oak boughs and the carting of
precious water, till his spare figure seemed
but a mass of working muscles and nerves,
and the jaws—locked in grim determination
to save his sheep—showed gauntly under
the brown skin stretched like parchment.
By telephone each night to the far-away
owner, living in city luxury, he sent his
report, before entering the same in his book,
and turning in to dream of dying sheep
dotting the paddocks—with the smell of
burning carcases ever in his nostrils.
In the end the rain came, and the fearful
tension slackened. Within a miraculously
short time, too, appeared the first green
shoots.
But Duggan was as morose as ever, and
the furrow deeply drought-grooved between
his brows became permanent.
Probably had Mrs. Duggan been the
recipient of his confidence she would have
learned of his growing rancor against the
owner who, beyond reading his reports and
making a perfunctory annual visit, took
little interest in the property or the sheep
—Duggan’s sheep ; the sheep that had died
in thousands despite Duggan’s skill.
One late afternoon he sat at his office
table, making out his deficit, adding up long
columns of figures. Entered a small boy
obviously neiwous who placed the mail-bag
unostentatiously on a chair inside the door.
Duggan looked up. “You’re late; bring
it here.”
The youngest Duggan, whose duty it was
to call for the mail on his way home from
school, advanced, bag held out towards his
fsthor
“Why are you late?”
Duggan reached for the key methodically
labelled and pigeon-holed, and unlocked the
big leather bag.
The small boy hesitated, rubbing one
muddy boot against a legging. Should he
lie, or should he tell of the not-to-be-withstood
temptation of village football and crave for-
giveness?
Duggan sorted the mail, the sound of paper
scratching on paper came. Then silence.
Two —three minutes passed.
One envelope, thin and narrow, addressed
in a man’s writing, Duggan held in his hand ;
held it staring, staring.
Four minutes; four and a half, and still
no sign. Then very quietly the small boy
withdrew.
Tea was on the table and all the family
served, and yet no heavy footsteps in the
passage proclaimed the master’s approach.
Mrs. Duggan wondered. Her husband was
authoritative on the subject of punctuality.
“Father can’t have heard the bell,” she
said and slipped away to the office.
Duggan still sat in his office chair, the
envelope—writing uppermost—on the blot-
ting-pad.
His face seemed drawn in the firelight,
bis eyes had a far-away look, and for once
h.s restless hands were quiet.
“Tea’s in,” his wife said gently. “Aren’t
you coming?”
From the depths of his chair Duggan an-
swered. “I’m fired,” he said, and his voice
was husky.
“Fired? You!” Mrs. Duggan’s arms fell
slackly to her sides.
“There’s a letter from him.” It was a
peculiarity of the whole Duggan family that
they never alluded to the owner by name.
“He always wires or telephones—he never
writes. There’s only one thing that letter
can mean!”
Suddenly Mrs. Duggan’s apathy left her.
“Haven’t you read it yet?” she demanded.
“No!”
For once she was the controlling power. (
She lit the lamp and snatched the letter i
from the pad, tearing the envelope open. A
pink, folded slip of paper dropped to the
floor and lay unnoticed.
She read the letter to herself, her eyes
skimming the lines. Then she laughed
wildly—a laugh that ended in a suppressed
sob. " She stooped to lift the pink slip from
the floor and smoothed it and the letter on
the pad before her husband.
“Fired!” she cried. “Read it—see! He
—he’s appreciated all you’ve done, and he’s
sent you a cheque for f;10—a bonus he calls
it! Read for yourself!”
Duggan stared past her at the fire. Ills
throat worked painfully. His fingers began
a restless tattoo on the chair-arm.
“Fifty pounds!” he muttered. “A bonus
of fifty pounds!”
Then the old Duggan asserted himself in
spite of a certain mistiness about his keen
eyes, and he spoke firmly once more:
“The man mnst be a fool to give bonuses j
at a time like this!”

The Sports at Odgers’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
feud between the Nolans and our-
I selves, like most other things of
colossal proportions, had an insignifi-
cant beginning.
Old Dinny Nolan and the Pater, riding
home from Bedeclcer’s sale, called in at The
Squatters’ Best, kept by Ned Odgers, for a
certain reason, and, while absorbing that
certain reason, their conversation drifted to
sport. Odgers stimulated the theme, when
it showed signs of flagging, with reminis-
cences of his own early performances on the
track. Under various mellowing influences
the Pater by degrees confessed to prodigious
feats of pedestrianism “as a young chap.”
When old Nolan could drive his spoke in
he also made allusion to prowess as a sprinter.
He admitted sorrowfully that his day was
past; but he thanked the Holy Mother that
his fleetness was in a degree reflected in his
eldest boy, Micky. The Pater remarked it
was surely coincidence —what with rheu-
matics and years of hard bullocking, his
limbs, too, lacked the elasticity that aston-
ished the sports of his day; but Jim, his
boy, he was glad to say, inherited a turn of
speed that was very gratifying to one who
could only look back at his own accomplish-
ments.
With the cashing of a note by the Pater
the speed of the two boys became amazing,
and by the time Odgers “sent it round” both
Jim and Micky Nolan were down to about
9 l-sth seconds the hundred yards.
“Well, well,” remarked Odgers, smiling
benignly, “yer never know the talent about
your district, do yeh? Here ’ave I watched
them two fine lads risin’ to man’ood and
never dremp they was both sprintin’ stock —
it’s a rummy world, ain’t it?”
Both the Pater and old Nolan beamed on
Odgers, and while serving another round he,
Odgers, confessed that, although no mug on
the track, he was. never in the same class
as the Pater or Mr. Nolan, and what a pity
it was that the prince of all sports should
be allowed to go into decline for want of
appreciation and encouragement!
“By damn, Ahdgers,” whimpered old
Nolan, “but a down-right pity it is,” and an
emotional tear broke from his light-blue eye
and got lost in the fiery forest of his whis-
kers.
“Yes, . Mr. Nolan,” agreed Odgers with
warm sympathy, “the ’eart of the Hue master
is ever in ’is sport, and w’en ’e sees it
dwindlin’ away ’is soul seems to dwindle
with it.”
“Ah. yes,” assented the Pater profoundly.
“I always ses, Mr. Nolan, that a man *oo
is a clean sport is better than a religious
man,” continued Odgers; “and w’en I see
that tear (Oh, don’t deny it, it ain’t nothink
to be ashamed of, Mr. Nolan) —as I am
sayin’ w’en I see that tear a-stealin’ down
your ’onest cheek, I ses to meself, ‘Odgers,
before you stan’s a true sport, a big-’earted
man.’ In fact, I ses to myself, ‘There’s two
of ’em,’ ” he added as an afterthought, and
then paused to observe the effects of his
remarks.
They were both too much overcome to
make a coherent reoly, but cast their eyes
on the slab floor, in token of modestly accept-
ing the truth of the other’s observations.
“Now,” resumed Odgers, when he con-
sidered his remarks were fully assimilated,
“I've got a idea to put before yous gentlemen.
i... .Same?. .. .Well, as I was sayin’—mind,
I’m on’y suggestin’ this. Both your boys
are good ’uns, so ’ow about arrangin’ a
little match between ’em—quite a friendly
contest, o’ course—just to give a little shove
to the sport, and, ’oo knows, it might be the
beginning o’ big things! We might be able
to form a sports club, with Mr. Nolan and
you as president and sec’et’ry, an’ with a
workin’-bee to clear a sports ground, and
the upshot of it all’d be sportin’ events we’d
be proud of. Now, gentlemen, what about
a little match to start the ball rollin’?”
The Pater looked at old Nolan and old
Nolan looked back at the Pater. This was
something entirely unexpected. But their
spirits were elated, and after consideration
they thought there might be something in
the idea.
“Of course,” began the Pater, “it might
have the effect you speak of, Mr. Odgers;
but it’d hardly be fair to my boy to expect
him to run slanters at the beginning of his
career. It’d have a bad effect on his future.”
“What d’yez mane be shlanthers?” old
Nolan demanded. “Micky ’d give your boy
a shtart.”
“Start? Start be damned !” answered the
Pater tartly. “I’ll bet Zliim could give your
Micky five yards in a hundred.”
“Foive yarths to th’ hoonthred, is it?”
snapped old Nolan, his eyes lighting up. “Be
sorrow, and it’s th’ boot on th’ other fut!
Oi’ll bit yez twinty quid Micky bates yoor
boy holler over th’ hoonthred yarths.” and
Nolan banged his fist on the bar.
“Just a minit. please, gentlemen.” inter-
posed Odgers. “I don’t want you to get
excited; but as you both fancy your boys, let

Working' Under a
Continual Strain?
Does a Lame Back Keep You Worn Out All the Time?
Maybe you have weak kidneys, a trouble
that often follows a cold, a fever or a spell
of worry, overwork or unwise habits. It
shows in constant, dull, throbbing back-
achd, or sharp twinges when stooping,
lifting, getting up or turning in bed, with
headaches, dizzy spells, a tired, nervous
state and irregular kidney action. Don’t
neglect weak kidneys, or you run the
danger of having dropsy, gravel, heart
disease or other complications. The kidneys
are the blood filters, and must work all the
time to keep you in good health. Take
things easier, follow regular habits, and
take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, a
remedy in use the world over and recom-
mended publicly in Sydney week after
week. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
certainly worth a trial.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold
by all chemists and storekeepers at 2/9
per bottle, or post free by Foster-McClellan

Serious Kidney
Trouble.
Inflammation of tbe Kidneys.
Sydney Man Cured After
Cong Suffering.
Mrs. George Woodroffe, 10 Rosehy Street, Drummoyne,
Sydney, says: “I have derived very great benefit from the
use of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Seventeen years ago
a cold settled on my kidneys, and eventually inflammation
of the kidneys and bladder set in, and up to the time of
taking Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, some months ago, I
suffered terribly. I have been treated by some of the
cleverest and best-known Sydney doctors, and was for seven-
teen and a half weeks in the Sydney Hospital, where I had
one kidney removed. Though the various treatments eased
me for a time I was not cured, and would soon relapse into
my former ill-health. I also tried patent medicines adver-
tised to cure kidney complaint, and they did not even give
me temporary relief. My brother was always worrying me
to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, if I only took one
bottle. To please him I got them, and before I had finished
the bottle I felt much better; in fact, I had not felt so well
for years; _ the pills were working wonders for me. I con-
tinued taking them, and am now perfectly cured of every
symptom of kidney trouble.”
Mr. Woodroffe confirms the above eleven years later:
“My cure has lasted, for I am still free of the terrible tor-
ture of kidney and bladder trouble. If I ever feel the
slightest pain near my kidneys I take a few doses of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they never fail to relieve me at
once.”

S a ( iast No! nsh mare.”
-L hat s the spirit!’’ Odgers exclaimed.
, Now, gentlemen, shake han’s on it. Ah, the
eart of a true sport never dies.”
lhe Pater and old Nolan shook hands on
the match, and after a little more refresh-
ment left the pub. The two wise old horses
plodded down the narrow six-foot and
branched off each to its own panels.
Details of the match were widely published
by the assiduous Odgers, who made every
effort to have the race well patronised. He
rode down on the shaggy pony that used to
belong to Wallaby Bob, and conferred with
the Pater one evening, and the result was a
meeting was convened at The Squatters’
Rest to discuss generally the question pf the
approaching local sports, and especially the
clearing of a race-track on the timbered
plateafi adjacent to the pub.
Odgett-s having .been voted to the chair on
old Noflan’s nomination, he ordered his wife
to bring, in a couple of bottles of whisky and
a number of glasses and bade the meeting
help itself- Conversation then increased till
it developed into a noisy hubbub, everyone
trying to go a bit higher than the other. The
whisky beting finished and nothing definite
arrived at, Odgers addressed the meeting.
“Well, gentlemen,” he said “it’s gettin’
hot in ’ere, so I moves we decide on some-
think. ’Ow will this do? Are all yous
agreeable to come over and ’elp clear
the track ev\ry Saturday afternoon till the
job is finished? We don’t want to keep the
boys in trainin’ too long. Eh? ’Ow’U that
suit yeh’”
The suggestion met with roaring approval,
and Odgers declared the meeting closed, and
it filed outside. Odgers immediately taking
his stand behind his bar.
. ~ j. J c ~ „ , , ,
During the first of the five weeks it took
to dear the track, Jim trained assiduously,
Wherever he went the I ater made him run,
and Jim became the bane of the sober old
cows lives. But after the first week his
enthusiasm subsided, and it was only on the
I ater s constant rousing that Jim took any-
thing more than the exercise occasioned by
his day s work, though the evening sprints
were, of course, inevitable. .
We had no watch to time Jim’s perform-
ances, but the Pater made a grand job of
dividing every second on the alarm into five,
and he. discovered, on opening the back that
a hatpin shoved into the interior at a cer-
tain point stopped the clock instantly, and
that on removing it the wheels restarted
with vigor. The Pater used to set Jim
moving by kneeling, down behind him with
the hatpin jambed into the clock; then he’d
jerk the pin bringing his hand into
violent contact with Jim’s crouching anat-
omy, at the same time yelling “Go!” and
away down the cow-track Jim would scuttle.
On arriving at the other end one of us w T ould
wave a hand and the Pater would more or
less successfully jamb the pin into the clock
again, and then tick off the number of
seconds the journey took. Jim’s time varied
from eight to twenty seconds according to
how slick the Pater was in inserting the pin ;
but the Pater said it gave him an idea of
Jim’s average time.
At last the great day of the race dawned,
and we put the new double-furrow plough
into the dray with two bags of potatoes and
drove up to The Squatters’ Rest. It had
previously been decided that the Pater was
to be starter with the old muzzle-loader, and
Nolan was to be judge: this was considered
fair to both parties. There was a large
attendance of supporters of both sides and
the enthusiasm was hilarious. Prior to the
race, impromptu sprints up the rough track
were indulged in and a deal of friction was
caused by parties starting from either end
indiscriminately.
Three o’clock was the hour fixed for the
great event, and as it drew near the specta-
tors left the attractive precincts of The
Squatters’ Rest and lined the scrub on either
side of the track. The Pater and old Nolan
diun’t bother tossing for sides, as it was
immaterial which side one ran on. If one
got the side with the charred stump he
didn’t have to jump the hole dug to provide
the earth for the charring; and where
the section was cut out of the big
black-butt log two could squeeze through.
In any case, it was considered so
close to the finishing post that the result
of the race could not be. affected by the
narrowness hindering the man behind.
With due solemnity the Pater, in the
presence of reliable witnesses, loaded the old
muzzle-loader and jambed a wax-matchhead
on the nipple in lieu of unobtainable percus-
sion caps. Then tucking it under his arm he
piloted Jim, who was trembling with sup-
pressed excitement, to the starting point.
Micky Nolan appeared with a perky air
talking rapidly to his “trainer,” an elongated
youth with large feet who lived the other
side of the Nolans. He made some subtle
allusions to putting in a couple o’ bags o’
cheap spuds with a presentation plough. Old
Nolan, after superintending final adjust-
ments about the finishing post, yelled through
his hollowed hands to Micky that there wuz
a crab-hole just forninst the tape t’ his
soide and t’ moind ut. Micky said he would,
and the Pater drew a furrow with his heel
and posted the two runners on it.
The Pater then addressed the runners and
said if Micky tried any money-tricks he’d
give Jim tt start. Old Nolan, overhearing
him from the other end, yelled out that if
Jim jostled Micky he’d give the race to
Micky. The moment was becoming tense.
The crowd held its breath except one or two
who shouted encouraging remarks to their
favorites and were loudly “sh-h-hed.”
“Now,” said the Pater, “I’ll say ‘Get set!’
and then fire the gun. Are you ready?”
Deep silence prevailed.
“Get—set!” snapped the Pater, and both
Jim and Micky dropped to their hands.
Snap! The gun had misfired, but both
runners shot up the track.
“False start! False start!” yelled the
Pater at the top of his voice; but Micky was
in the lead, and old Nolan was jumping up
and down excitedly and yelling: “Come on,
Micky ! Come on, me boy ! Ye’ll do it
easy!” But the spectators interrupted and
filled the track. Then pandemonium broke
out. Everyone was explaining at once to old
Nolan that it was a false start, and that the
race would have to be re-started. It took
quite a whde to convince old Nolan that he
wasn t being defrauded of the race, and the
two toed the mark, while the spectators again

The Hater was looking rather serious this
time, but Micky s smile was broader than

“Get set!” again snapped the Pater; and
again the boys dropped down. Snap—
again! But both the runners left as though

Its fizzin. She 11 go off yet. Go for
your life, Jim. And Jim did go. So did
Micky; but Jim had a good five yards start,
and as both runners got into stride, Bang !
went the old muzzle-loader.
The crowd yelled as both runners pelted
up the track. It was evident that Micky
was going to overhaul Jim, and the Pater
looked pained; a sinking feeling made itself
felt in his interior. As the two approached
the sawn-out section of the log Jim was
just leading and one-halt of the crowd
yelled : Jim. Jun 11 do it.. Mick s beat .!”
And, the other half counter-yelled : ‘ Micky s
got lm . Hell pip lm yet. Cm on, Micky!”
It was at this stage that Martin Grogan’s
cattle-pup decided to take a hand, and with
a “Gr-r-r-r!” and a “Wouf!” he sailed into
the race. Micky’s bare leg proved too great
a temptation for his, at any time, impartial
taste; he laid on good and hard and hung
there. Micky howled and swore venomously
and turned round to kick the pup off; but
that wise animal left of his own good
judgment, and Micky s aspect accelerated his
departure But Micky s blood was up. He
wanted that pup, and seizing on a knobbv
chunk of wood he bounded into the crowd
in pursuit, while Jim romped home an easy
winner. ,

“Oi tell yez it’s no race, and phwaffs

and he waved his arms about wildly and
glared around the circle to see if any dis-
agreed with him.
“Don’t you call me a thieving villain,
Nolan,” said the Pater. “Am I right, boys?”
“O’ course vou are,” cried some,
“No bloomin’ fear you ain’t,” yelled some
others.
“Settle it by argument,” insinuated some
evil spirit • “but fighting’s best.”

as the other occupant. There was nothing
else for it, so the Pater took off his coat
and rolled up his sleeves; then, taking a
couple of casual steps toward the irate
Nolan, lie electrified the ringsiders with a
tiger-like spring and bv shooting out his arms
like steam pistons. Old Nolan, taken off his
guard, went down with a grunt before the
Pater’s sudden onslaught. But he didn’t
remain long on the ground. When he col-
lected his scattered wits he bounced to his
feet and commenced hopping around the
Pater like an enraged tarantula,
The battle was one prolonged round till
the crowd decided that both parties had had
enough and dragged them, panting, apart,
They puffed and glared malignantly at each
other till the Pater, getting sufficient breath,
gasped :
“Had enough, Nolan?”
“No, damn ye !” wheezed Nolan,
“Como- on, Nolan; you’ve both had
enough,” urged some hufnane sport in the
crowd. “Shake hands and be friends.”
“Niver, wid him. He throid t’ shtail me
