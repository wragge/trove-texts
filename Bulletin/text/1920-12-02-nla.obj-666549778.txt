The Red Page
Hugh McCrae
Any book by Hugh McCrae is very wel-
come ; for there is individuality in all his
work and he stands apart and alone arndng
Australian singers. There are or were
voices among us far stronger than his, voices
of purer quality and greater range,
voices that express a richer thought, voices
more daring, more sustained, more inspired,
more original in all of value that the thing
we call originality contains; yet McCrae
stands on a little hill quite by himself, mak-
ing a music that is different from that of
all the others. His harp appears to be
strung with the hair-fine threads of moods
too thin to stand anything but the lightest
touch. A mere puff of wind breaks them ;
and MeCrae’s own hand too often tears a
whole bunch of them to fragments before he
is half through the prelude of his song.
Keats’s phrase, “spirit ditties of no tone,”
will suit some of the best of MeCrae’s work
admirably. That his best is not the char-
acteristic feature of his new book Colom-
bine (Angus and Robertson) is matter for
regret; but let us be very thankful for the
best that is there.
Comparing the essential thought in this
volume with that of his previous work it is
at once clear that McCrae has grown younger
and a little more joyous. Despite the many
superficial opinions expressed to the con-
trary, the dominant note of “Satyrs and Sun-
light” was that of very old age clinging des-
perately to the skirts of youth and growing
occasionally boisterous at the memory of
physical pleasure. The boy spirit runs in
the wind without looking back. McCrae in
his first book not only looked back but went
carefully over the road he had come, noting
with exactitude how he moved his knees
and ankles at certain parts of the race. Only-
great mental age would do that. Yet age
has its magic as well* as youth ; and McCrae
certainly caught that magic.
To say that “Colombine” is a book of youth
would be absurd. No one young enough to
be glad could possibly write of his first-day
sweetheart in this manner :
She laughs and weeps.... Is it because
Only to-night she gave -herself to me?
The new bud frightenec) to be glad....
The child’s first vision of tlie insatiate sea.
After that you see the young lady rise from
the piano and wrap a shawl about the octo-
genarian lover. But the book does contain
young poems, as witness ‘Song of the Rain” :
Night,
And the yellow pleasure of candle-light....
Old brown books and the kind face of the clock
Fogged in the veils of the fire; its cuddling took.
The eat
Greening her eyes on the flame-litten mat;
Wickedly wakeful, she yawns at the Yam
Bending the roses over the pane.
And a bird in my heart begins to sing
Over and over the same sweet thing.
“Safe in the house with my boyhood’s love,
And our children asleep in the attic above.”
That has all the dew on it; only that a boy
would have written “manhood’s love”’ which
would have spoiled the poem.
Lionel Lindsay, in his foreword, tells us
that McCrae sings pictures. A strict logic
might deduce from this the idea that the poet
is using the wrong medium of expression ;
but the song itself defies such reasoning. It
is indeed for this very quality in the work
'that we have cause to be most thankful. Take
some examples;—
And scattered down the river bank.
The thin, white, thirsty stars
Dabbled the water while they drank
Between their visor-bars.
I Watch her fingers while they prance
Like naked women, tango-mad,
Along the keys
Tlie Night hath drawn the moon into her breast....
As when some saddened virgin, and opprest,
Seeks in the shadow of her garden-close
The consolation of a lovely rose.
For these and a dozen other pictures let
there be praise to all the Muses. But con-
sider this also : *’
My Mvrtil, time it is to wend
For babes and crazy-headed men,
Sweet lips, like you and I are, when
The fluttering crowd of kites descend.
English grammar, all Parnassus and the
wide, dull fields of commonsense have a right
to demand that such a stanza should be
burned by the common literary hangman. It
it without music or meaning, and the .“like
you and I are” embosoms in our literature
for the first time the phrase of the illiterate
flapper.
But the lapses are not numerous in this
book, and the reader will be glad to lose the
feeling which came upon him in the older
work that McCrae was indulging in what
theologians call obscurantism. There is,
of course, the tendency to make music of
things far beyond his range of real observa-
tion or first-hand knowledge, but if it is good
music tlipre is little reason to complain.
Listen:—
And in the morn
I will see born
■ Tlie doe’s dappled young
Whose father was sung
To death by the horn.
McCrae will see that, as he says, but he
seems quite blind, as far as this book is con-
cerned. to the real beauties about him in his
own land. Even in his charming “June
Morning” he sees only apples, daffodils,
doves and sparrows, a lawn and a fogged
window pane.
But the best description of the whole book
is in the opening poem, called “Colombine”
(apparently because “Columbine”, has been
the English form for four centuries and is
true to its Latin original) :
Exit the ribald clown—
Enter the bubbling wine,
Lighter than thistledown,
Sweet little Colombine.
Whisht! and behold the game,
Long eyes and pointed chin ;
Paler than candle-flame.
At her feet Harlequin.
Look how their shadows run.
Swift as ,she flies from him! —
Moths in the morning sun,
Out of a garden dim.
Faint through the fluttering
Fall of a flute divine,
Softly the ’cellos sing-:
“Colombine, Colombine.”
Softly the ’cellos sing-:
“Colombine”....
“Colombine”....
There is a real haunting magic in that —a
picture and a cry—yet the thought to a
human heart is about as negligible as thistle-
down to a farmer. McCrae makes it matter :
and that is the great thing.
“Colombine” is a very precious book in
spite of some preciosity; and no Australian
library can afford to be without it. There
are 11 illustrations by Norman Lindsay, and
the publishers have done their work excel-
lently.
Maurice Maeterlinck’s Philosophy
Maurice Maeterlinck has abandoned his
charming bungalow amid the green orange
groves and purple-tinted hills of southern
California, where he intended to spend
at least a. year writing scenarios, and
is now on his way back to Europe. Al-
though he failed absolutely in the three new
fields he entered —the lecture platform, grand
opera, and picture-play writing—it would be
doing him a grave injustice to say that his
American visit was a total failure. Far
from it. It has been infinitely more success-
ful than even his most enthusiastic admirers
ever dreamed it would be, inasmuch as it
has, through the medium of another “Blue
Bird wave,” demonstrated to a war-weary,
hysterical, sorrowing, troubled public that
his philosophy is the very anodyne
for this stricken age.
The Belgian poet failed as a lecturer
simply because he could not speak the Eng-
lish tongue. But what of that? For nearly
30 years he has towered over all other
writers in the French language as definitely
as a mountain towers over a marsh. Again
and again by his sheer beauty of expression,
by his dexterity of diction, and by his com-
plete mastery of his native language (they
speak French in his part of Belgium) he has
inspired the whole literary world. Knowing
this, the American public ought not to have
expected, and certainly ought not to have
demanded, that he lecture in a tongue which
was not his. own. Surely it is a life-work to
master one’s own language. And, more,
when an artist is the acknowledged first man
of letters in his native language, as Maeter-
linck indubitably is, he ought to reciprocate
the confidence of the great literary world by
devoting all his time and talents to that
language, and not interfere with nor jeo-
pardise his development by side-tracking into
another and foreign medium, in which, at
his age, he cannot possibly hope to success-
fully express himself. Maeterlinck was right,
absolutely right, in not wasting the maturity
of his genius in studying the English tongue
for a commercial success upon the American
lecture-platform ; and the American public
and the American Bureau which handled
him were wrong in attempting to lure him
with dollars and adulation into an English-
speaking adventure.
His failure in the realm of grand opera—
or, to be more correct, the failure of his
“Blue Bird” in a grand opera setting—was
not due to any imperfection of his art. but
to the poorness and inadaptability of the
musical score; or, in justice to a distinguished
composer and gallant Allied soldier, may I
not be permitted to say, to the direct influ-
ence of the hell of war? Albert Wolff saw
years of service under the banner of his owq
beloved France. He won the Croix de
Guerre in the first battle of the Marne, and
later spent over 180 hours in the air as a
lieutenant in the Flying Corps. Alas, all
this influenced his work for the worse,
and his “Blue Bird” compositions were far
below his standard. So, after one of tlie most
dazzling first-night receptions in the history
of American Grand Opera, the piece was
next day struck off the repertoire of the New
York Metropolitan Opera House. Let us
not blame the poet for this. Let us be fair
to the composer. Let us chalk it up to the
already long account of William Hohen-
zollern.
Maeterlinck’s third and most recent
failure, as a scenario writer, is, I think, a
tribute to his sincerity as a great artist,
rather than evidence of any flaw in his
genius. Try as he might, he simply could
not nail his art upon the cross of material-
ism and melodrama, as picture-play writing
demanded.
In spite of the three failures Maeterlinck
left these shores a very happy man ; for he
had the satisfaction of knowing that his
visit had “Blue-Birded” America as America
had never been “Blue-Birded” before. His
immortal story was selling as fast as it could
be turned off the printer’s presses. The mere
sales of so many editions would not appeal
to him from a business standpoint, for he is
anything buf material; but the knowledge
that his book was in siich popular demand
must have convinced him that the world in
its hour of crisis was turning to his philo-
sophy. There are three distinct grpups in
America to-day reading “The Blue Bird”:
First, the children who love the charming
story of the little brother and sister roaming
through the fairy world looking for the
blue-plumaged bird which was to bring them
happiness; second, the students and lovers
of allegory who see in the story another
“Pilgrim’s Progress” ; and, third, the mystics'
and spiritualists who claim the memorable
dialogue in the graveyard as part of their
own creed.
Under a French title “The Blue-Bird”
was first published in England in 1909 and
in France in 1910. At first its author paid
it little attention. In fact, he thought so
little of it that he confided it to the waste-
paper basket, where it was found and
rescued by his wife. After its initial success
Maeterlinck seemed to suddenly realise that
at last he had produced something that
would be immortal. His apathy turned to
white-heat affection, and he indignantly
refused to permit Coquelin the elder to
adapt, it to the taste of the boulevard public.
In its unadulterated form it has been played

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Corn of Wheat.”
Here where the dust of no dead dream
Is buried under root or sod
There runs a pulsing crimson stream
That sings beside the grave of God.
He went this way at lilt of Spring,
Too weary of the world He made —
A harp with but a single string
Of death in beak and fang and blade.
He died upon a hollow night
Of empty wind and tossing leaf;
I sat in yellow candle-light
And played a foolish hour with grief.
I played with grief to find its sting.
The wilted sorrow scarce had life —
A sickly, pale and stunted thing—
A slow, faint stab without a knife.
And in the night a merry rain
Came as a happy victor comes,
With eager beating on the pane
And on the roof a sound of drums.
And you came near. Your hair was wet;
You laid a hand upon my 0wn....
Somewhere deep scents of mignonette
Across the dripping dark were blown.
God rose. The world at lilt of Spring.
To green and happy uses born,
Had fifty thousand songs to sing
That yellow resurrection morn.
God died for me and rose again—
The Chief-Priest of my heart can pray,
The grief that teased my soul was vain
Because the stone was rolled away.
Small Calvaries and lukewarm hells !
White angel of soft wings and fair.
God lives! A thousand Easter bells
Ring in thb sweetness of your hair!
N.S.W.

Invocation.
O Muse, be prodigal and grant to me
All that I ask of tLee.
It is not much:
Only the magic touch
That softly, with inimitable art,
Lays bare the heart;
The touch that from full-fruited passion
presses
Glorious wine with agonised caresses,
And yet is tender lest
It flutter beauty in her windy nest.
Yield to me once the secret of the word
By which the soul is stirred;
The phrase that still,
With rapt and ghostly thrill,
Like the orbed moon controls that restless
flood
Of wistful blood
That to the deep shores of our secret veins
Murmurs its loves, its hungers and its
pains—
Twined words that with their spell
Conjure that flood its ardent tale 4 to tell.
Lo, as her splendor o’er the waters wide
Draws up the dazzled tide,
As swift to her
The oceans sway, they stir,
And the long waves abase them at her feet,
So ’neath the sweet
And subtler glamor of a word’s white glory
The tossed heart, swelling with its own sad
story,
Cries out its grief in surges
Whose yearning quivers to the spirit’s
verges!
Grant me but once the wonder of that pas-
sion,
To know, to feel, to fashion;
Let it be mine,
That sorcery divine,
Just once to sate the throb of all desire
With words of fire,
Once to release winged verses in a flight
Trilling and warbling their profuse delight,
Once to voice all my pain,
And then, contented, never speak again.

My Dream.
I fix your cushions in the easy chair;
I set your slippers by the fireside:
And so I see you, sitting all content,
And talk to you as though it all were true.
Dear heart, how truly wonderful it is;
How I have dreamed of it and waked and
longed!
And now I see you there, just as I dreamed,
And smile at you across the flick’ring hearth.
Sweetheart, I love you, and I do believe
That you love me as truly as I love;
And this is our dear night, and this our
dream
Come true at last; oh, love, how wonderful!
The firelight flickers on a vacant wall;
A clock chimes somewhere in the outer dark ;
And fact —cold, miserable fact-—obtrudes
Its bitterness against my visioning.
You are not there, dear love; only a wraith
Of something I have longed for fills your
chair;
And I know very truly in my heart
That you are visionary nothingness.
Somewhere a fire burns brightly as does this,
And you before it sit at quiet ease,
Thinking, God grant, some vagrant thought
of me —
Another woman’s children at your feet.
Ah, well, it is the law: I only love ;
And I can only love and hope and dream :
I put the light, out and I steal away
To my cold, lonely bed, to dream of von.

BASIC WAGE AND FUNDAMENTAL
FOLLY.
When things began to look doubtful for the
Nationalists in N. S. Wales the late Holman
Government got the basic-wage habit. It
decided to periodically ascertain what was
sufficient to support a man, his wife and two
children in a land drunk with loans and fat
with artificial prosperity, and to make that
the irreducible minimum, a Board of Trade
being appointed to do the ascertaining and
fixing. The procedure was horribly embar-
rassing to States like Victoria and S. Aus-
tralia, which lived more cleanly, didn’t go on
such wild loan jags, and left wage-fixing to
the regular tribunals. It didn’t lessen the dis-
content of labor in N. S. Wales and greatly
increased that of the workers in other parts
of Australia. Also it failed to save the Hol-
man Government from the doom that
awaited it, so even as a vote-catching
device it wasn’t worth the trouble it
caused. Still, when Hughes was go-
ing to the country, and votes were a
matter of urgency, he acquired the basic-
wage enthusiasm, too. He nominated a com-
mission of seven, headed by the bookish
lawyer Piddington, to inquire into the sub-
ject at vast length and submit voluminous
recommendations, the more voluminous and
less intelligible the better. It meant adding
another complication to the already compli-
cated business of wage-fixing, but that was
nothing to Hughes. He didn’t pause to con-
sider the accumulated folly of having in each
State a wages board and an industrial court
or industrial board ; in the Federal sphere
an arbitration court and temporary tri-
bunals created from time to time; in N. S.
Wales annual basic-wage determinations
clothed with the force of law; and, top storey
of the crazy and sagging structure, the Pid-
dington Cbmmission. The Prime Minister
was in a hurry to get elected; the crash
could come latgr.-
The crash came later —11 months later.
Thanks to the events of the last month the
old system of regulating wages and working
conditions in Australia has been utterly
smashed. There is no further use for wages
boards, industrial courts or arbitration
courts; their occupation is gone. Wages
are now determined not by those , bodies but
by truculent persons like Lambert, the
A.W.U. secretary; by Hughes himself, and
the feeble creatures who do his bidding;
by obscure individuals who frame the N. S.
Wales basic-wage reports; above all, by poli-
tical agitation and the menace of strike.
The edifice began to topple when it was
decreed that the basic wage in N. S. Wales
should be £4 ss. a week. The Commonwealth
public servants, many of whom are miserably
paid, straightway commenced a continent-
wide demand for a £4 ss. minimum. Their
movement was frankly political in its direc-
tion, and State Government employees'and
other dissatisfied sections of the workers
showed signs of joining in. Just when
things were getting interesting the Pidding-
ton Commission, which had been hmbling
from capital to capital since Christmas and
taking cataracts of evidence about the price
of suede shoes and the number of cotton
nightdresses a woman can wear out in a year,
lumbered along with its report. As the
result of portentous calculations it sagely
decided that no lady as was a lady could get
along with less than three hats, two costumes
(one at £ll Os. 6d.), two skirts, eight
blouses, a dressing-gown, a golfer, six pairs
of stockings and anything from four to a
dozen of everything else. By a similar pro-
cess of inquiry the I’iddingtonians arrived
at the conclusion that it took £1 13s. a week
to clothe a family of five and £2 6s. to feed
them, and that rent, insurance, recreation
and other items would bring the sum up to
£5 16s. This amount is the average of the
basic wages recommended for the several
States, Queensland and Westralia being
below the average and the others above it.
To pay the £5 16s. a week to all male
workers, irrespective of condition, would,
according to Piddington, cost £93,000,000
per annum ; according to Knibbs, a higher
authority, it would cost £101,000,000.
Astonished at his own immoderation, Pid-
dington protests that the Commission never
intended that the £5 16s. a week should be
paid to all male workers. But the Commis-
sion didn’t say so (it didn’t say a lot of
things), and, in any case, the glad news had
been circulated to the uttermost ends of
Australia and a power of mischief had
already been done.
* * * *
In sober truth, there cannot be an Austra-
lian basic wage. The Prime Minister knew
that well enough when the vote-catching
Commission was appointed. His Govern-
ment can give the £5 16s. a week to its ser-
vants if it likes (for manifest reasons it
won’t like), but it hasn’t the power to make
the thing a fixed rule from ocean to ocean.
Even if it had the power and the inclination
as well, it would soon have to raise its. basic
wage to at least £7 10s. a week to meet the
increased cost of living caused by the
advance to £5 165., and the £7 10s. would be-
come £9, and the £9 would soar to £lO 10s.,
and so on, until the crash of ruined indus-
tries and the roar of an army of unemployed
warned Australia that the vicious circle was
complete. And if there were a basic wage
for men there would have to be a basic
wage for women, and this would introduce a
new element of discord and lead to a large
displacement of labor, and in all probability
accelerate the,smash. Piddington talks hope-
fully of declaring a basic wage of £4 a week
and paying the married worker 12s. a week
for each child under 14, the money coming
from an endowment fund to which the em-
ployer would contribute 10s. 9d. a week
per employee. This fatuous proposal, in
Hughes’s opinion, has “much to recommend
it.” But apart from the heavy burden it
would lay upon industry the result would be,
in many cases, that capable bachelors and
childless married men would draw £4 a week,
while less capable toilers would be collecting
£7 125., or £8 45., or even £9 Bs. a week. You
won’t get industrial progress by apportioning
the rewards of industry in that fashion. If
you are going to pay men according to their
success as breeders and not according to their
merits as workers, there will be no induce-
ment to a man to excel in his vocation, and
in the long run it will come to this: either
the childless efficients won’t work to the best
of their ability or the heavy breeders won’t
get work. Australia has no time to waste on
fancy schemes of this description. Nor has
it any further use for the plethora of royal
commissions, the creation of self-seeking,
mob-flattering politicians, too dishonest to
take the responsibility for their own opinions,
with which the land is plagued. Royal
commissions or boards of trade can’t secure
a more equitable division of wealth if the
wealth isn’t there to divide. Even vote-
catching Governments can’t do that, however
much they may boast or threaten at election-
time. In a country like Australia, with an
enormous public debt, battalions of noisy and
incapable politicians, industries many of
which are struggling and none excessively
rich, a people organised industrially and
politically and an uncertain economic outlook,
there is only one way of raising the wage-
rate, and that is the way of hard and honest
toil. Solid work, and a return to simpler
ways of living and saner conceptions of
government, will remove the worst of the
evils from which Australia is suffering, and
nothing else will.
“KAISERISM IS DEAD. LONG LIVE
KAISERISM!”
Six years ago the whole fabric of liberty
which had been built up by the British people
in as many centuries was threatened with
destruction. The word “Ivaiserism” was
coined; and the best and bravest from every
part of the Empire faced death by way of
protest against such methods of government,
while those who could not fight submitted
to stiff doses of the abomination, the poli-
ticians having explained that tyranny was
only to be cured on homoeopathic lines. The
electors failed in many cases to grasp the
point, but they were fired by a great ideal,
and the general attitude was one of eager-
ness to make whatever sacrifices were
demanded by those in authority. In that
spirit Australia went to war. Here and
there long-sighted persons were heard making-
stipulations, demanding guarantees. Lord
Harcourt warned the English that on the
return of peace they would have to put up
a strenuous fight for the personal freedom
which they had handed over to the Executive
on the outbreak of war. The politicians
were scandalised. Was it suggested, they
inquired angrily, that men of repute. would
retain powers given them for the specific
purpose of defeating • certain named enemies
on land and sea for one moment after those
enemies had been disposed of? If so, it
amounted 'to a cruel slander on patriots who
were performing arduous duties. No one
employed this argument with greater vocifer-
ousness than our own William Morris
Hughes. At the time he probably meant it.
But that was years ago, and the lust for
power grows monstrously with the possession
of it, even where normal men are concerned.
In the case of Hughes, vain, intolerant and
truculently domineering, the thing has become
an obsession. He held on to the War Pre-
cautions Act for months, not to say years,
after the presence of the measure in the
Statute Book had become an offence in the
eyes of every reasonable citizen, and now that
the last shadow of excuse for it has vanished
he suggests an alternative. He proposes to
preserve certain powers for the Executive
after the so-called emergency legislation of
1914 has been repealed; and this is how he
himself describes some of them:—
Clause 7 was designed to enable the Government to
exclude persons vlhose object was to stir up dis-
loyalty and create dissatisfaction in the minds of the
citizens of the Commonwealth. Any person who was
suspected of having such a design was required to
take the oath provided, and if he declined to do so
he would be deported. If, after taking the oath, they
were found by a competent tribunal to have violated
it they would be deported. The next section dealt
with unlawful assemblies. It was designed to give
statutory effect to those War Precautions regulations
which were introduced some years ago for the pre-
vention of crowds assembling within the precincts
and immediate neighborhood of the Parliament.
Section 9 made it an offence to bring the Sovereign
into hatred or contempt, to incite disaffection against
the Sovereign, the Government, the Constitution, or
either House of Parliament of the United Kingdom,
against the Government or Constitution of any of the
King’s dominions, to excite his Majesty’s subjects to
attempt to procure the alteration, other than by
lawful means, of any matter in the Commonwealth
established by the law of the Commonwealth, or to
promote feelings of ill-will or hostility between
different classes of his Majesty’s subjects.
* * * *
The present British Royal family needs
no statutory defence in Australia, but it
would be a lunatic procedure indeed if Aus-
tralians were to gag themselves in respect of
the possible misdeeds of all future royalties.
It was only by stirring up what was then
known as disloyalty that England got rid of
the Stuarts and Germany of the Hohen-
zollerns. As regards the creation of dissatis-
faction it is enough to say that without it no
political reform has been achieved nor ever
will be. The proposed oath is a plagiarism
from a measure of two and a half centuries
back, with these differences, that under the
Test Act only persons holding public offices
were disciplined, and in any event it was
presently made inoperative by an annual
Act of Indemnity. It is significant of the
distance that Hughes has gone along the
path of Kaiserism that he should now be
advocating a drastic variation on a penal law
of which England was always a little
ashamed, and which it abolished finally 92
years ago. The meaning of Section 9 is, in
plain terms, that in future no one may say
f>r write anything detrimental to the political
interests of W. M. Hughes. The citizen
who has “incited disaffection against the
Government” or “promoted feelings of ill-
will between different classes of his Majesty’s
subjects” will not go before a jury. He
will be tried and on conviction handed his
12 months by a Judge. Now, Mr. Hughes
has a short way with Judges who, like Mr.
Justice Higgins, fail to see eye to eye with
him. Is it taking an unduly pessimistic
view of conceivable developments to suggest
that with different laws from those which
Australia or any other self-governing
dominion has ever known ip times of peace,
the Commonwealth may be afflicted with a
different class of Judges? In that case no
speaker or writer on a political question,
either of local or of Imperial interest, will
be safe. The country will have gone back
to feudalism in a night.
* * * *
One of the wickedest, and so most fre-
quently-cited, cases of Star Chamber injus-
tice was that of the London merchant
Chambers, who, maddened by the Govern-
ment’s methods of getting money out of his
class, said that there was more justice in
pagan Turkey than in Christian England.
For this “incitement to disaffection” he was
fined £2OOO and ruined. Compulsory loans,
which came into fashion with our multi-
tudinous Governments during the war, and
which W. M. Hughes plainly intends to
make use of for money-raising.-- purposes
under peace conditions, originated on the
large scale under Charles I. People were
severely punished for recusancy in the early
part of the 17th century: their recusancy
was religious, and v in a stubborn
adherence to Roman Catholicism ,or to one
of the Nonconformist creeds. Under Hughes-
ism the recusants will be -Irish Nationalists
or Australian Laborites, Whichy in principle
will represent a distinction Without a differ-
ence, and they will be liable to deportation
without trial, a penalty which, no English
dissident has had to suffer since the Tudor
period. It would be easy, indeed, to
take seriatim W. M. Hughes’s prepos-
terous suggestions for the perpetuation
of the War Precautions Act in an
exacerbated form and that every
one of them has been inspired by tyrannies
which led to revolutions centuries ago. They
were abolished because they were unneces-
sary and dangerous in the hands of mediaeval
kings, and Britain and the British dominions
got on Well without them until the great
tragedy began six years ago. There is no
evidence that Australia needs to-day legisla-
tion which no Australian would have put up
with for a second under the old conditions;
no indication that the existing criminal laws
directed against sedition, treason and blas-
phemy have failed ; no hint that the people
who their' blood and spent their money
to defeat Kaiserism are eager to solidify
tne position of tlie accursed thing in this
country. Hughes’s latest grab for power
simply means that lie is seeking through his
party majority (a majority which he secured
on the understanding, inter alia , that the
Commonwealth would get its old liberties
back as soon as possible) for a means of
dealing with his enemies and helping his
triends and more particularly himself. If
1 arliament fails to defeat this typically
regal manoeuvre it will be faithless to its
trust .as a representative body. And it will
be faithless also to the memory of the men
who are now lying in foreign graves, because
they believed that through their sacrifices
Australia would hold the privileges handed
down to it by the ages.
THE BEASTLY TERRORISTS.
[SO NAMED TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE
BEAUTEOUS TERRORIST OF OLD HENRY
PARKES'S FAMOUS POEM.]
When the whole community or a large and
essential section of it is condemned to death
or ruin or something else of a serious nature
and the sentence is without appeal, then a
tremendous power rests with the Terrorists
who run the show. They are in the position
of Nero, who had the technical power tQ
slay anybody and everybody, though he didn’t
use it to the utmost, lest he should feel
lonely and have to wash the dishes himself.
It being only possible to exercise a frag-
ment of a really boundless authority, the
usual way is for the man in charge of the
law to use the law against people who differ
from him in race and religion, against people
who differ in politics, against his personal
enemies and against those who haven’t the
money or possibly the sense to pay for
immunity. Thus N. S. Wales Attorney-
General McTiernan’s Anti-Profiteering Bill
gives such gigantic scope for harassing every
corporation, partnership and individual
trader, from the Bank of N. S. Wales and
the S. M. Herald and the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. dovyn to the bootmaker who is
his own sole employee, and the dealer who
sells odd pounds of butter, that sheer exhaus-
tion will make it necessary to discriminate.
The obligations include ai profoundly elaborate
system of bookkeeping to show cost of pro-
duction at different stages of the work which
will be quite beyond the great majority, and
will absorb an absurd amount of time and
money; a knowledge of every new and fleet-
ing regulation, even if it is only announced
in the Government Gazette ; and an avoid-
ance of excessive prices, even though no
price is fixed —that is to say, the seller is
not to charge a price that the Court may
afterwards decide is excessive, which means
that he is to be a prophet. The chances
include the constant hindrance of the busi-
ness of an obnoxious corporation by officials
taking possession of its books and papers
for overhaul; also the seizure of stock-in-trade
by any police constable who says he has
“reasonable cause to believe” it is liable to
forfeiture; likewise the risk (heavily punish-
able here) that the concern’s branch office
in Perth or London or Shanghai isn’t run-
ning the business there in accordance with
N. S. Wales law, though the law doesn’t
apply there. And the possible crimes (all
heavily penalised) include knowing (being
“privy to”) the fact that somebody in Adel-
aide or Athens, over whom the offender has
no control, isn’t running his business there
on strict McTiernan principles, about which
the Adelaidean or Athenian never even heard.
Lougiilin’s Land Bill is less picturesque,
especially in the fact that it doesn’t profess
to interfere with landowners in Maoriland
or Macedonia or Morocco (which is lucky, for
the Moors are a short-tempered race), but it
permits of probably 10 times more local inter-
ference than it will be possible to use within
any reasonable time. So the Terrorists in
charge, also their agents, officials, informers,
judges (specially appointed and not closely
bound by the ordinary rules of evidence, and
in most cases not subject to appeal, unless
the High Court decides that no paltry local
authority can destroy the right of an Aus-
tralian to carry his case to his own fount
of justice)—these and others will have a lot
of useful and valuable discrimination to dis-
pense.
* * * *
When the Reign of Terror begins under
the Land Bill, everybody’s land over 200
acres will be liable to seizure if the specially-
appointed Court or Revolutionary Tribunal
happens to decide that the bit of dust is
capable of being improved to a value of
£lOO per acre, so that 200 acres will stand
for £20,000. Plenty of land should be
capable of being made worth that much,
especially if £2OO per acre is spent on it.
As the State can’t possibly seize, depopu-
late and re-settle all the soil made available,
judicious discernment (a very useful article
for those who sell it or give it away) will
doubtless be used, not only in selecting the
cases to be considered, but in declaring the
limit of possible improvement. The owner
is allowed to mark out the area he wants to
retain, which must include the homestead,
even though that may be on the least valuable
part, but there is no positive assurance that
he will get exactly what is marked, except
as regards the homestead. The rest is
liable to seizure at what the Court holds to
be its improved value on the last day of
1920, all subsequent improvements or acci-
dental accretions of value being forfeited.
So improvement will naturally cease on all
big properties within the area that is under
sentence, and dilapidation will set in pend-
ing the date (in 1921 or 1981 or 1951) wffien
the Court comes along and does the seizure.
Even if the owner is willing to cut up and
sell his land when the sluggish Court doesn’t
turn up, and so stop the process of rack
and ruin and end the suspense, he can’t do
so, for the Bill says briefly and blandly
(-clause 8) :
Every such sale or disposition other than by way
of mortgage shall he null ancl void.
Still it is provided in the same clause that
the Minister may over-rule this proviso and
allow a sale “upon such conditions and on-
receiving such assurances whether by bond
or otherwise as he may determine.”' And
when years have passed, and the landholder
hasn’t had a chance even to sell to the State
in exchange for depreciated bonds, and at
the sacrifice of all improvements made and

all increment that has happened since 1920,

in droves to the Minister, Loughlin’s re-
mote successor. And he will ask the Minister
his conditions.

When land is taken by the Court at its
own valuation, without appeal, and with all
improvements and increment since 1920 for-
feited, between one-third and one-quarter of
the remnant will also be forfeited through
payment in 4| per cent, long-dated securities
of small market value. That is, assuming
interest rates keep up; but as State credit
sinks, those rates may rise, so that the 4%
per cent, bond will be worth less
even than it is to-day. The buyers of
confiscated land are to pay 61 per cent, of
their purchase money in cash, but it isn’t
hinted that this payment or subsequent pay-
ments will be used to redeem the 41 per cent,
bonds given to the original holders. Pre-
sumably the Government will spend the
money it receives and owe the money it pays.
In the sale of land acquired under the Reign
of Terror the possibilities for friendly or
profitable differentiation are large. No land
is to be sold at less than its improved value,
but it may be sold at as much more as can be
obtained. The subject of supplying cheap
land for settlers isn’t mentioned. So it is
quite possible that when the growth of an
industrial town or some such event has
boomed land from its value of £4 per acre in
1920 to £l2 in 1030, the Government may
seize it at £3 (considering the real value
of its depreciated papet) and have £8 an acre
to the good on the face value of things, or
£9 on the real value. The rules for the dis-
posal of land being somewhat nebulous, and
being in any case liable to alteration, it
seems just possible that some future Terror-
ist in office may contrive to let the property
go to a friend, relation, fellow-countryman or
fellow-religionist for £6 per acre, the buyer
making him a present of another £3. On a
1000-acre deal the country would thus make
£2OOO, the Minister £3OOO and the friend,
relation, fellow-countryman or fellow-religion-
ist £3OOO. The original owner might be
ruined, but he doesn’t count. An amazing
instance of callousness towards the poor man
and the small man is embodied in Clause 23.
If on a resumed property there was at re-
sumption day “a lessee from the then owner
with a bona-fide lease,” or “a person who
was not a lessee but who held such land on
terms of sharing profits with the owner (here-
inafter referred to as a share-farmer),” or “a
person employed on such land and who had
established his home and resided on any part
thereof for at least two years,” he need not
have his lease stolen or his share contract
annulled or be evicted from his humpy, pro-
vided he mollifies the Terrorist in office. That
person may let up on him “for such period
and on such terms as he thinks fit.” Appa-
rently the man with two years of his lease
unexpired may get a 20-years lease at a
peppercorn rent, or he may get the prompt
and immediate boot —all according to the
terms he makes. An enterprising and dis-
honest Minister with such an instrument as
either the Land Bill or the Anti-Profiteer-
ing Bill as a weapon should end a three-
years’ term either a millionaire or the victim
a lynching party—or both.
There are the usual multitudinous pro-
visos under which “the owner of any hold-
ing to which this Act applies” is to send in
plans, complete list of improvements and
“such other information as may be pre-
scribed.” The last may include many details
of his business that he doesn’t want to part
with and a list of his previous convictions.
Quite a number of people may not dream
that the Act applies to their land till they
learn the value to which the Court says it
may be improved if enough money is spent
on it. Penalties for neglect run as high as
£lO a day, though of course the Terrorist in
office may remit the fine if properly
approached. Probably there will be a good
deal of work done in the districts that talk
of seceding and setting up as separate States.
Then when secession comes off the new
States will have a swag of very inferior de-
bentures and the old one will have whatever
instalments of cash have been paid by new
buyers. But a suspicion exists that some-
thing sudden may happen to this amazing Bal-
main and Botany Government. Its staggery
and erratic doings may at least hasten the
idea that places like Sydney and Melbourne,
with their environs, should be separate City
States, with Legislatures that will look after
street and lane and wharf matters, and leave
country problems to people who understand
them a little.
FAMINE AND FESTIVAL IN CHINA.
It was a gala day for the Chinese. Just for
two or three days in Spring the peach and
plum blossom comes out, bursts into a superb
riot of color and the road to Loonghwa is
crammed with pilgrims to the shrine of
beauty. The holiday silks and satins of the
women, flower-like themselves on their hob-
bled stalks of feet, replace the everlasting
blue cotton of everyday wear. We were too
late for the peach and plum blossom, but the
yellow rape-flower was out in all the fields,
and the crops were high and green, covering
the scars of last year’s season and the usual
military campaign of the autumn. Both
sides of the road an army of beggars wept,
dribbled, screamed and threatened or dragged
themselves along after our carriage on stumps
of legs or waved wrists without hands in at
the door. Young Chinese plutocrats, owners
of modern cotton factories or silk filatures,
stood up in their motor-cars and scattered
“cash” to right and left. Conservative old
gentlemen, distrustful of this age of Western-
isation, swayed along in palanquins. Youth-
ful bloods educated at Harvard or Oxford
drove masher-carts, with grooms in livery be-
hind. Sturdy coolies pushed barrowsful of
girls with crumpled feet but merry faces.
Out of the gay stream of traffic shot a per-
petual fountain of largesse, descending
amongst the double row of mendicants like
golden rain.
The wealthy tourist who brought a motor-
car to Shanghai in order to tour the Empire
was shocked to find that the extent of his
possible excursion outside municipal limits
was five miles. The road to Loonghwa is
just as long as that. Beyond its terminus
at the Dragon Flower Pagoda the most luxuri-
ous must take to chair or barrow, like the
poorest peasant. The lack of roads is one of
the reasons why, at the present moment, 41)
million people are dying of starvation in one
province, while in neighboring provinces a
surplus of food is being thrown to the pigs or
buried as manure. The average yield of a
Chinese holding is enough to support the
family which works it. When the yield is
above the average the farmer must leave the
surplus to rot, for he has no means of stor-
ing it or of transporting it, and he cannot sell
if to his neighbors because they also have a
surplus. Thus there is no industrial cor-
rective to over-population, and the farmer’s
family is allowed to increase until it eats up
the whole produce of his farm. Nemesis
arrives. The crops fail. The farmer has no
money to buy grain even if it could be
brought to him, for he was unable to sell his
surplus when there was one. He gives his
wives arsenic, sells or drowns his children,
and stoically starves to death.
It is a couple of days after the festival of
Bure Brightness, when relatives of the dead
assemble at the graves to worship the an-
cestral spirits and burn “ghost money” for
their use. From the summit of each grave
mound, from the lids of coffins which have
waited a score of years the auspicious day of
burial, flutter ex votos of inscribed paper or
silk. In the whole of that vast graveyard,
on both sides of this barrow-track, along its
whole length—extending, in fact, from the
Pacific Ocean to the boundaries of Mongolia
and Tibet —scarcely a mound seems to have
been neglected by filial piety, which has sur-
vived in many cases the cataclysms of cen-
turies. It is reckoned that one-seventh of
the arable land of China is occupied by the
memorials of the dead. The surface of every
field is pock-marked with their hillocks.
They serrate the skyline. The only trees
to be seen are those planted to protect
a grave, and in the bitter winter, when the
search for firewood becomes a quest of life or
death, the peasant will cut down the young
trees just planted by the Afforestation
Bureau, but will respect the fir and cypress
which shade the dead.
In every part of China at the present
time, alongside the orderly efficiency of the
foreign settlements, one can see a process of
devolution going on which, if unchecked,
would inevitably lead the Chinese back into
savagery, amidst all the monuments of a
splendid past. It is the same path Europe trod.
The weakness of ruling castes and the rot-
tenness of the official systems have been
the causes leading to the same results.
In China floods that might have been
averted, constantly recurring famines,
pestilences, unchecked brigandage and
interprovincial war make property so
insecure that the tendency amongst the
wealthier class.es is to take their investments
to the safety of the foreign pale; and for the
lower classes gradually to discard material
possessions and return to a state of nature.
Nanking, the southern capital, has fallen a
long way from the glories it possessed under
the rule of the Mings; but its downward
course may still be watched to-day. Whole
districts have been burnt out again and again
during the disturbances of recent times, and
the inhabitants have returned and re-
established themselves on the same ground.
But each time the community shows itself
to have gone a little further on the down-
ward path. The rebuilding is done with the
materials to hand ; broken fragments of brick
are piled without mortar on top of each
other, and the wretched inhabitants creep in-
to shelters made of charred wood, straw and
rubbish collected from the ruins of their homes.
Instead of resuming their old industries
they sell the pitiful salvage of their stock or
engage in labor of a lower type. There is no
money for public works. Derelict temples
are utilised as schools and offices, and
wrecked bridges of stone-work magnificently
carved are replaced by flimsy wood.
Thousands of families are driven into beg-
gary and go to swell the festering population
of the beggars’ camps, which are a feature
of every city.
This is the disease which Young China,
full of hope and Western learning, proposed
to cure by Acts of Parliament, party gov-
ernment procedure, referenda and universal
suffrage. Full of these ambitions Young
China flocked in hundreds to Peking to com-
pete in the examinations for the new civil
service. To their consternation they found
that Western learning was not wanted ; and
while the students of the old regime passed
triumphantly, Young China, amid the
derision of the nation, failed to a man.
After eight years of republicanism Young
China is still fugitive, with a price upon
its head, and into the respected slippers of
the old civil mandarinate have stepped the
representatives of the most despised class
in the Empire, the military caste.
This spectacle of a civilisation apparently
going into liquidation has led foreign ob-
servers for at least the past century into
making sombre prophecies. But a nation
with a tradition of 3000 years is not to be
judged by normal standards. National
decay is usually followed by national disap-
pearance. A race loses its distinctive
character and becomes merged with its con-
querors. Not so the Chinese. There is no
sign of senile decay in the Chinese individual.
The organisation of its alien rulers, the
Manclius, has gone rotten with corruption
and collapsed, but the character of the people
remains vigorous and untouched. Chinese
history shows that the nation lias been far
from immobile. It is a record of alterna-
tions of gigantic phase. The Han dynasty,
the T’ang and the Ming marked the periods
of highest achievement, and between each
alternation China went through a period of
disruption similar to the present crisis. But
whereas the resurrection of other nations
has come through invasion and the injection
of foreign elements, China has always manu-
factured her own stimulus. Her great
periods have always synchronised with the
restoration of the native dynasty, and it
would be in perfect keeping with her past
record if the Manclju collapse coincided
with a national revival.
■ Surrounded by immensely inferior races,
Chinese civilisation has contemplated itself
with increasing complacency for some
hundreds of years. But it has not always
refused to learn from others. It accepted
Buddhism from India and met the first
aggressions of Europe with the broadest
tolerance; The Chinese commercial im
stinct, when freed from official shackles,
will triumph over anything —the foreign
trade returns for the last tempestuous year
were the highest on record. The Chinese
are shrewd enough to see the material advan-
tages of European efficiency. For a
hundred years European policy in China has
been forcing the most pacific nation in the
world towards militarism, and it will be
strange if China fails to better the instruc-
tion.
A solitary rock, crowned with broken
temples and pagodas, gladdened our eyes,
wearied with the long monotony of cultivated
polders and interlacing canals and creeks we
had been passing through all day. We left
our chairs and climbed the stone steps which
led to the summit. In a ruined temple
overlooking a wide expanse of crops and
crowded waterways we sat and drank tea
with the priest. He was a much-travelled
man, like most Buddhist priests, who, with
begging bowl and staff, cover an astounding
lot of ground in Asia, wandering often as
far as Lhassa and Chinese Turkestan. He
was the sole remaining guardian of.an image
of the Goddess of Mercy who still smiled
from a disordered shrine over the relics of
the T’aiping devastation. Of that devasta-
tion a missionary has left on record that,
when he was approaching Soochow by boat
just after the T’aipings had captured the
city, he was unable to get nearer than three
miles from the' gates owing to the water-
ways being choked by the dead bodies of the
population whom terror of the rebels had
driven to suicide. Not only the T’aipings
were to be feared. The Imperial soldiers
were just as ruthless, and the ousting of
the T’aipings meant a second devastation.
The track of double ruin can be marked
from Shanghai to Hankow in shattered
temples, depopulated cities and ruins every-
where. ,
All that remained of the archives of the
temple was a beautiful old book depicting
the glories it possessed before the T’aipings
came. We coveted that book with all the
cupidity of our Western souls. The priest
was ready to share his bowl of rice with
us, but ail our bribery would not make him
part with the book.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Old Swindle in a New Form.
The native-born Australian politician has
hitherto repudiated pretty consistently the
employment of sectarianism as a means of
reaching office. Parkes, Reid, Cook,
Hughes and other imports invariably re-
sorted to it when in difficulties; Deakin
always scouted anything of the sort—and
perhaps for that reason did not do as well
as some much smaller men have done at the
party game. Hitherto the chivalrous Deakin
attitude has been followed by George
Fuller, of N. S. Wales. But last week he
fell, the occasion being the annual meeting
of the Sydney, or, as some say, N. S. Wales,
National party, and the audience mostly
the same old crowd who were once
Liberals, and before that Anti-Socialists and
again Freetraders. “Let us oppose,"’ said
Fuller, “that spurious Australian sentiment
which is advocated by some leaders, a foreign
importation, which has been distilled in Ger-
many and blended in Ireland. Our opponents
have been induced into these paths by leaders
who are no friends of our country, who have
no love or allegiance to our throne, but who
owe allegiance and obedience to a foreign
potentate —whose ends they are out to serve.”
Hughes was more or less simultaneously say-
ing the same thing in another place, with
the addition that he proposed to fight the
alleged enemy with his “bare fists,” his
teeth and his nails. Twenty years ago the
Conservatives of Sydney were Freetraders,
and they claimed that the Pope of Rome was
working for Protection in N. S. Wales,
though Leo XIII. had never evinced an
interest in fiscalism anywhere, and though
most overseas Romanists then, as now, stood
to be prejudiced by an Australian tariff.
When Freetrade died and George Reid took
up Anti-Socialism, the “foreign potentate”
of the Vatican became a Socialist and the
Protestant workers of Australia were urged
to put him in his place by voting against
the party to which Hughes then belonged.
The present idea is that the Pope is a Sinn
Feiner who hates the British Empire, and
who will therefore exult if Tudor defeats
Hughes and be confounded if George
Fuller ousts Storey. What imbecility it
all is! It may fairly be said that, with the
exception of a negligible handful of cranks,
no one in Australia is other than anxious
to preserve the Empire by every means pos-
sible, no responsible Australian being eager
to hand the Commonwealth over to an
Asiatic Power. Neither religion nor sect
enters into the question. According to
figures supplied by one of Hughes’s own
departments, 60,503 R.C.’s risked their lives
for the Empire, representing nearly 20 per-
cent. of the A.1.F., or as nearly as possible
their exact quota, judged on a civilian popu-
lation basis. Certainly it may be said
that some R.C.’s now advocate self-deter-
mination for Ireland, just as Lloyd George,
Churchill, Grey and others once advo-
cated self-determination for the Boers.
But that no more makes them enemies
of the Empire than" it made Lloyd
George one. or Churchill or Grey.
Twelve years ago Joseph Cook stated that
his present leader, W. M. Hughes, was
endeavoring, in alliance with Rome, to over-
throw the Empire. That was because Hughes
had advocated an Australian Navy. In fact,
anyone can be shown to be a traitor by the
application of the simple old formula pre-
sented by both Hughes and Fuller last
week: “Those who are against usj are against
the Empire.” Tragic nonsense though it
may be, it has always been good for a cer-
tain number of working-class votes. Whether
the ancient manoeuvre is going to pull
, Nationalism out of its present difficulties
will depend largely on how much the late
tragedy has taught Labor. But whether
it be efficacious or not the duty is cast upon
every Australian who wants to keep this
young country free from old-world bigotries
to express his abhorrence of every attempt
to make use of those bigotries for the ad-
vancement off any Australian political party .
The Difficulty of Being Independent on
£25,000.
Feeling that some justification was required
for the spectacle of a Prime Minister figur-
ing in the role of a waiter pocketing his t p,
the S. M. Herald put it this way :
The services of the more prominent generals and
admirals were recognised in a handsome way. They
were honored with peerages or other high distinc-
tions, and they were presented with large sums ot
money. That was right and proper.
Whether it was right and proper, as the
generals and admirals no doubt thought, or
whether it was a procedure whose only excuse
lay in the fact that it had been done before,
as thousands of British taxpayers and
hundreds of their newspapers have said, is a
matter for opinion. The popular view in
modern England amongst all but a very small
class is that admirals and generals are ex-
tremely well paid in times of peace and
generously pensioned if they reach the retir-
ing age without seeing service, and that the
physical risks most of them face in warfare
are relatively small, while the danger in-
curred by their reputations is even less. A
very senior officer who makes a tragic error
representing the loss of thousands of lives is
not cashiered : he is usually given a pleasant
and lucrative job at a base. If in all the
circumstances such a man is not well off at
the end of a war it is plainly his own fault.
And almost every word of the foregoing
applies to the case of the Australian Prime
Minister. But, whether such gifts are justi-
fiable or not, the fighting chiefs who from
Marlborough’s day onwards have been
recompensed with fantastic sums got the
money from the nation. The English land-
owning classes did not send round the hat
for Wellington ; the Chartered Company
made no splendid gift to Roberts; the Lan-
cashire mill-owners offered nothing to_ Haig
—and, indeed, it is safe to say that if any
of them had done so it would have been
resented as an impertinence and an outrage.
The pernicious quality of the ceremony in
which Mr. Hughes figured last week depends
on two things: (1) he is still a public man,
(2) he has accepted a fortune from the
hands of unnamed persons. There is only
one inference to be drawn where £25,000 is
subscribed and the subscribers don’t require
the usual public acknowledgment of their
contributions, and that is that the benefac-
tors are a handful of wealthy men who
are known to each other. The recipient
appreciated this point, judging by a S. M.
Herald report of his speech: —
I tell you emphatically that I shall never lend
myself to any movement which has for its object
the side-tracking of democracy. (Great cheers.) I
shall never seek to erect a rampart whereby great
vested interests can shelter behind the great mass
of the people.
He may be perfectly honest in these excel-
lent intentions. Further, he may stick to
his present principles, and when big finan-
ciers, whether of local or overseas extraction,
ask him to wield that influence on their
behalf which one in his position has so many
opportunities to do, he may turn and rend
them. But it will take a good deal of reso-
lution where they happen to be men whose
past bounty stands for part (perhaps a great
part) of his present income; arid, what is
worse, many members of the public will be
unable to credit him with the stark honesty
requisite for such a feat. He has become
the property of a section, whether he decides
to do the work he has been paid for or not,
and he and his supporters accuse him of it
with every impassioned excuse they put for-
ward.

Australia’s White Slavers.
Now that the harassed nations of Europe
are beginning to again make goods for them-
selves, and are no longer compelled to buy
most things from Uncle Sam at his own
avuncular price, the U.S. boom is slowing
down and prices are falling fast. Wages
are also falling (in some cases they are down
50 per cent, already), for the sufficient reason
that no man can be paid as much for making
a pair of pants which sell at 30s. as for
making a similar pair that sell at £4 10s.
It was a marvellous boom, in which Uncle
took possession of about seven-tenths of the
gold in the world and got a mortgage on
most of the nations to boot. In 1919 alone
he annexed £820,000,000 from the outer
world by selling that much more high-priced
merchandise than he bought. Australia,
which missed the glorious ’bus and devoted
the time of opportunity to strikes and mad
pro-Hun agitation, accumulated nothing in
these golden years except debt —not only war
debt but peace debt —and bad habits. There
was far more work to be done because im-
ported goods were hard to come by. There
were far less people to do the work, for a
multitude of capable producers had gone to
the Front, while those who were only con-
sumers —the very young, the old, the infirm
and the women who were not producers in
the sense of making saleable articles —re-
mained. Yet instead of postponing every
public work that could be postponed so that
factory labor might be available, there was,
in this Land of Upside Down, an extra-mad
struggle to push on public loan works so that
factory labor might not be available. Now
that the slump is coming without the boom
(save the debt boom), and the fall is due
without any previous rise (except the rise
in the interest bill), the country’s worst
White Slave politicians propose to meet the
case, not by manful reform but by White
Slaving harder than ever. For it is White
Slaving. The policy is to sell the children
into financial bondage all their days for this
loafing generation’s ease. They are left
some Public Works as a sham equivalent, but
new taxes have to be put on every year be-

price paid to the old man for making them,

also had to be reformed from outside.
Backblocks Health.
Dr. Franklin Royer, of the Halifax Health
( ommission, tells The Bulletin what
Canada is doing for the health of its Back-
blocks :
The Nova Scotia Provincial Branch of the Red Cross
Society of Canada wrote an interesting page in Public
Health history during the months of July, August and
September. In mid-July the Society equipped two
great Public Health caravans and sent them on long
tours through the fishing villages of that peninsular
province, carrying mess:iges of health and relief into
communities remote from hospitals and physicians,
bach caravan carried eye, ear, nose, throat and lung
specialists, a dental specialist, a corps of four Public
Health nurses, moving-picture apparatus, folding cots
and bedding for improvising hospitals, field-operating
equipment for surgery and dentistry, and the necessary
chauffeurs and mechanicians. The equipment and
personnel were carried in motor apparatus. Seven
Red Cross ambulances, two Ford trucks with con-
trivances for generating current for moving-pictures
and projecting lanterns, and two personnel cars
completed the motor outfit.
One of these great caravans toured the Northern
and North-eastern coasts, the Other the Western and
South-eastern coasts. In the various villages through
which the caravans passed local physicians, dentists,
and nurses augmented the personnel. Local com-
mittees met the caravans and escorted them to places
of meeting previously arranged, and to schools or
halls cleaned and ready for the improvised hospital-,.
All of the professional personnel were trained to talk
along Public Health lines, speaking with the movie
picture reels, with lantern slides, or without any
illustration at all. In 36 towns hospitals were im-
provised in which 390 nose and throat operations and
1882 dental operations were done; 4232 applications
for treatment were examined, 860 of them having
chest examinations.
During the time the caravans were en route 115
public meetings were held, nearly 300 Public Health
addresses given, and 67 Public Health moving-picture
shows were conducted. Each day reports were sent to
the central bureau at Halifax, where they were
given out as “news stories” to the public press.
As a suitable climax, on the end of this Public
Health crusade, when the caravans returned to the
City of Halifax on August 23, a Public Health
Pageant was held. The Provincial Health Officer and
President of the Red Cross asked all ministers through-
out Halifax and the territory covered to feature Public
Health work in their churches Sabbath morning, and
to announce the pageant to be held on the Citadel Hill
in the afternoon. This pageant meeting Was presided
over by the Lieut.-Governor and supported by a great
choir from 27 church choirs. The setting was intended
to attract a large crowd.
It is not surprising that the International Health
Board should have watched the success of these cara-
vans and that Dr. Vincent, its president, should have
stopped in Nova Scotia to see some of the results in
the field; nor is it surprising that the representative
of the National Red Cross, after visiting the caravans
at work in the southern part of the Province, should
have decided on sending out 12 of these caravans
next year.
Nova Scotia has placed many parts of the world in
her debt by setting them a great example of Public
Health teaching, and has given her own citizens great
stimulation in Public Health by taking this stride
forward at a time when Public Health means so much.

Strikes, anti How to Cause Them.
Before retiring from the Presidency of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court Justice
Higgins announced that “the feeble, reck-
less, feckless” practices of the Prime Min-
ister had made the job insupportable. In-
stead of standing behind the Court and
upholding its prestige and power, Hughes.
his Honor said, had cultivated a habit of
“throwing scrap-iron into the machinery of
wage-fixing.” The result has been plain
chaos. When the seamen and firemen struck
the head of the Government induced them to
return to work by undertaking, without
reference to Higgins, that they would be
granted the wages they demanded. The
consequence of this manoeuvre was that a
ship’s fireman found himself getting 10s. a
month more than his boss, the junior engi-
neer, and not being able to seek redress from
the Court—the Law forbids a union to ask
for proportionate increases before the expiry
of its award —the engineers struck.
Hughes dashed into the breach again and
gave the engineers another £3 10s. a month.
But this meant that a junior engineer was
now receiving £6 a month more than a junior
navigating officer, who hadn’t struck, so a
further instalment of the Priminister’s slap-
dash methods of arbitration was necessary to
dissuade the masters and mates from desert-
ing their posts. In all these proceedings the
Arbitration Court was treated as if it had
no corporeal existence; but by the irony of
circumstances it was called in at the end to
straighten out the new lot of inequalities
arising from the misguided efforts of a small
man in a hurry. The lesson should have
been instructive, but it was thrown away on
Hughes. In an evil hour for the country
and for whatever reputation he had left, he
decided to further cripple the Court by
erecting his personal and peculiar brand of
conciliation into a system. Without consul-
tation with either of the Judges of the Court,
an Industrial Peace Act was passed to enable
the Prime Minister to appoint arbitrators
independent of the permanent tribunal and
responsible to him alone. Higgins there-
upon did what was expected of him. He
resigned. In a parting statement he
declared: — ;
A permanent Court, working on a reasoned system
and for many industries, cannot function in compe-
tition with temporary tribunals created to avoid or
end a specific strike in a specific industry. A tri-
bunal of reason cannot do its work Side by side with
executive tribunals of panic. The Industrial Peace
Act has undermined the influence and usefulness of
the Court, and created a position which will surely
give rise to many industrial stoppages.
Not three weeks later the award of one of
Hughes’s irresponsibles, issued (1) in the
absence and despite the protest.of one of the
parties, (2), in ignorance of local conditions
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BASIC WAGE.
J ONES: “My missus had another youngster yesterday—that makes three.”
S MITH: “I yot four.”
B ROWN: And I got half-er-dosen. The man that thinks we haven't earned eight quid
this week is a hi a nicy tyrant.”
and (3) regardless of the existing Wages
Board determination, caused the Victorian
coal strike. Of course Higgins had hi.s
faults as a Judge in Arbitration, and made
his mistakes. But in gazing upon the havoc
that has been wrought upon his Court, and
contemplating the hazardous possibilities of
the basic wage recommendations, one has a
feeling that the reckless destruction of, the
system with which Higgins was identified
for 13 years will rank as the greatest in the
long list of Hughes’s tragic blunders.

Slums Above-ground and Catacombs
Beneath.
The dismal aldermen of Sydney met the
other day to consider, among other things,
the unwholesome and degraded and disgrace-
ful state of their own property and their own
miserable inefficiency as landlords. Then
they sidestepped the subject. William-
street is a place that is very difficult to turn
into, a slum, but it has been done. It is
straight; it begins with a park and ends
on a breezy hill; it isn’t so narrow as it
might be; it isn’t haunted by noxious trades;
and it has other features of the modest resi-
dential quarter. But by the dire necessities
of house famine its family homes have become
tenements, and as no one liked to turn 75
people out of an eight-roomed house so that
it could be repaired or reconstructed, the
tenements have gone to the dogs and made
those animals wretched. The City Council
acquired much of William-street for widening
purposes. It considered this and other
problems of congestion, as well as problems
of locomotion, and the need for people to
live further out, and the difficulty of getting
in if they did, and the demand for more trams
where they are like processions of ants
already, and for faster trams so that they will
kill more people, and cheaper trams so that
they will lose more, money. Then the aider-
men of the biggest and mast compressed and
slummiest and fastest-growing city in the
Commonwealth resolved to let their disgrace-
ful old rabbit warrens stand awhile, on the
chance that they would grow young again
off their own bat, so to speak. No aider-
man or politician or philanthropist or town-
planner dares to say that there is the slightest
sign of house famine and congestion and
slummification doing anything off their own
bat save become worse, but no one knows
how to do much except say that the old places
must stand a while longer—and then
adjourn. A city surface railway might
do something in the way of enabling Sydney
people to live further out and yet get in, but
the one. bit of real city surface railway
the untidy town possesses, the Darling Har-
bor branch, cost £597,257 per mile, and that
was opened in 1855, when the city was small
and cheap and labor was cheap also. An
alternative idea is a tube system as in Lon-
don, for these are not affected by the cost of
the surface above them. London had 12S miles
of’‘tubes” before the war (1911) and the cost
up to then was about £492,734 per mi1e—
£63,069,933. That was a case of building
in a low-wage country at pre-war wages. The
net earnings (amount available for dividends,
taxes, repairs and sundries) wasf £1,707,880,
or about £2 14s. 2d. per cent. Sydney wants
to reform “slums” that in London would be
regarded as fine samples .of reformation
already, and with its sprawling contour and
its rapid growth it could probably turn over
a new leaf with not less than 64 miles of
subterranean line to begin with. At present
prices and wages they would perhaps cost
quite as much as London’s 128 miles, and
with a 64 per cent, loan burden to carry the
anmml loss would probably run into millions.
In 1917 the value of all the improvements in
Sydney and suburbs was set down at
£116,000,000, so it looks as if two new
seaport cities, each between a third and a
quarter the size of Sydney, could be built, to
draw off population and ease the pressure, for
the cost of burrowing, mole-like, under the
old place. England, with 650 people to the
square mile, has little room for new cities and
is more or less driven to burrow; but N. S.
Wales with barely seven humans per square
mile, isn’t. In fact, the policy of pushing
nearly half the population of 309,000 square
miles on to 185 square miles has reached a
sort of breakage point, like the loan policy and
the importing policy and the break-of-railway-
gauge policy. Either it must be abandoned,
or a whole new public debt must be spent
on catacombs to give it a temporary new
lease of life.
♦
The N. S. Wales Minister for Health
decided last week to immediately proclaim
the State V.D. Act. A deputation of scan-
dalised women had presented him with the
latest hospital-admission figures for Sydney
and suburbs, and. they scared the Minister
out of his jaunty attitude of the previous
week. But there is more to be done than
merely to proclaim the Act. For one thing,
it will have to be amended. Thus a doctor
has to certify that his patient is “cured”
before he (or she) may marry.. But syphil-
itic manifestations occur in thousands of
cases years after the doctors have done their
best. And the profession is agreed that
gonorrhoea may remain undetected and
undetectable for long periods. It would be
fairer, then, to put less responsibility on the
doctor and more on the patient. Most pros-
pective wives or husbands would certainly
prefer to be told the condition of affairs be-
forehand, and given the chance to make a
choice based on the doctor’s opinion and
other circumstances, rather than walk
blindly into a union which might equally
be successful' or disastrous. As it is, a
doctor can hardly refuse a certificate when
he finds no sign of disease, and yet he alone
may be held responsible if there is disease
and if the result is to infect a clean wife
or husband or produce deformed or other-
wise afflicted offspring. So long as prosti-
tution remains uncontrolled a measure like
this can be no more than a palliative, any-
way.
“F. L. Ceaye” on the rifle and machine-gun:
I question whether the original B.K.F. was advant-
ageil as regards ammunition supply by the fact that
it was retreating. No army scores in such circum-
stances. Obviously, it is much easier to keep up
supplies of all sorts when triumphantly advancing
and when all is working smoothly than when retiring
with the commissariat disorganised and most of the
firing-line up in the air. For this reason the B.E.F.
had to rely on what ammunition the men could carry,
and in the long run it proved sufficient to hold up
the Hun.
An excellent illustration of the value of rapid
rifle-fire in defence was the repulse of the Prussian
Guard in their counter-attack on the Aussies at
Bullecourt. When the assault ended over 4000 dead
Huns lay on the ground in front of the men behind
the rifles, whose total number was considerably less
than that of the said corpses.
The great drawback to the use of machine and
automatic rifles is the large amount of ammunition
they use in a short time, and when it is remembered
that the Maxim and Vickers-Maxim can fire up to
600 and the Lewis up to 1000 a minute (representing
a weight of from 601 b. to 801 b.), it is easily seen
that to keep in action a gun which one man can
work, half a dozen are necessary to carry the cart-
ridges required for five minutes’ shooting.
Up to the present no perfect machine-gun or auto-
matic rifle has been produced, and the best are
always liable to a stoppage at a critical moment.
The ordinary rifle, on the other hand, with a little
rare, will carry on, and can be relied on in an emer-
gency, giving a feeling of confidence to the user
which the machine-gunner never experiences.
“G.D.ML”: Afteu two months of a timid
appeal the fund for raising £lOO,OOO for the
Melbourne University has reached £7OOO, and
with promises it is probably nearly £20,000.
Now the Dean of Westminster Abbey, Lon-
don, has issued in Melbourne a cry for help,
and hundreds of rich native-born Australians
will doubtless send along cheques to prop up
or underpin the ancient fane, which has for
them only a distant traditional interest. And
right under their noses is the finest institu-
tion in Victoria, exercising influence upon
every child born here, weak and nearly
starving from lack of money. Australians
are notoriously charitable people, and no
cry for aid goes unheeded ; yet when educa-
tion is concerned, a department of life and
conduct of transcendent importance, our
people exhibit no enthusiasm. For sport,
charity, memorials they give millions; for
education, for their universities, colleges,
schools, and particularly for their professors,
schoolmasters and teachers, the Australians
give nothing except under duress. The
Americans who came mostly from the igno-
rant because uneducated races of Europe
place education on a pinnacle; they endow
places of learning, and the American child,
whether native or immigrant, is pressed to
learn from babyhood. Because we come from
a superior race and our fathers and mothers
were not illiterates, we do not really value
education, and our rich banks, mining com-
panies. insurance companies and shipping,
squatting and manufacturing magnates dp
nothing to advance it. They have got the
idea that it is “the work of the State”;
so when the State doesn’t do it nobody does
it. Education npiy be the State’s duty: but
if the State neglects it, propertied people
can’t afford to. The experience of Russia
ought to teach them that.


A strong, virile nation needs strong, virile
tasks on which to bend its energies. The
Iron and Steel Industry opens up such a
field of endeavor for Australian Manhood,
providing work that develops and fosters
self-control, initiative, stamina and force
of character.
The Australian
Iron and Steel
Industry
would give employment at Australian rates of pay (if
all the Iron and Steel goods imported into Australia
were made by our own people) to not less than
30,000 MEN,
who would earn over
£5*000,000 per year.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The High Court has decided, in W. A.
McArthur, Ltd., v. the Queensland Govern-
ment, that a State Anti-Profiteering Act
cannot apply to a warehouse in another
State which sends goods over the border
in fulfilment of orders obtained by its com-
mercial travellers. Which means, among
other things, that Flinders-lane can snap
its fingers at Kid McTiernan, of N. S.
Wales; in fact, the judgment reduces much
of McTiernan’s monumental work to wind
and wastepaper.
The cheque which Hughes accepted last
week, “in recognition of his war work,” was
for £25,000. It should have been much
more. There is many a .firm in Australia
that owes Hughes more than that on its
own account.
From the Federal Gallery:—
The smiles of satisfaction that chase away Higgs’s
usual lugubriousness speak of one thing only. He is
the chosen man to follow Lit. Groom, who is to be
the Public Service Arbitrator and is nervously
pulling that little moustache of his whilst he waits
for thg^word.
“Spirited borrowing policies” not only ruin
a country’s finances; they sap its freedom
as well. Having exhausted its credit abroad
the demented Queensland Government is now
reduced to extorting local loans, and has
appointed a new inquisitor or vampire to
perform the unsavory job. This is how the
victim is to be dealt with :
If the Commissioner of Taxes has reason to believe
that any person whose yearly average taxable income
exceeds £lOOO has not subscribed to any loan in due
proportion to his means, he may, subject to the
direction of the Treasurer, by notice in writing,
require him to subscribe to the loan within such
time, and to such amount, as is specified in the
notice.
The procedure is agreeably reminiscent of
King John’s methods of wringing benevo-
lences from the Jews. John Plantagenet was
a bit more forthright than John Fihelly;
that is all.
There are 10,000 unemployed on the re-
gister in N. S. Wales and more not there —
mostly unskilled and tradeless men; waste
products to be maintained now out of charity
or out of loans, which is the same thing only
worse. And the State with 10,000 unem-
ployed on its books, and many others who are
not there yet, paid (or owed) £18,000,000 in
the July-September quarter alone for imported
products—mostly products of skilled labor —
because it is too backward or ignorant or
tired to make things for itself and too
luxurious to do without them. Also the
State wherein this happens has a Labor Gov-
ernment ; in fact; Labor has been in office
seven years out of the last 10|, and most of
the men in office during the rest of the time
were Labor men thrown out of the Caucus
merely on the Hun issue. It almost looks as
if the hard-borrowing policy for the en-
couragement of unskilled men, and the trades-
union policy for the discouragement of skilled
men, has gone wrong.
Watt now challenges the ancient Storey’s
right to the silent member’s trophy; but lie
is thinking hard and waiting to make the
most of political developments. Any time
he may be lifted to a high place in the
Nationalist army. Apart from the High
Commissioner’s billet in London, there is the
by no means defunct desire to settle a
Cocked Hat at Washington, and in the ex-
pected scramble for these posts Watt might
be inveigled back into the Cabinet.
Joe Cook is supposed to be showing signs
of early departure from the Treasury for
Andrew Fisher’s chair in London. But that
little matter isn’t settled yet: Andrew’s term
has been extended three months and Milien
is to be locum tenens, with the title of Resi-
dent Minister. Advice of this arrangement
reached Joe Look by a newspaper cablegram
from the Fog, and Joseph expressed his “sur-
prise” at the news. Probably Joseph doesn’t
know what his chances really are for the
billet. Billy knows, and Billy, as usual, is
making it a dark and awful secret.
The beginning of the Victorian coal trouble
was just buzz and fuss. First, the black-coal
miners of N. S. Wales asked Hughes for a
Federal board or something to fix conditions
for the industry, which, as five States do
black-coal mining, was a Federal affair.
Boards are to Hughes like drink tr> some
people, and the body eventuated. So did the
award. Then the N. S. Wales people asked
Hughes off-handedly to have the Victorian
Government's brown-coal enterprise included.
This isn’t Federal, but a freak peculiar to
one State; and it isn’t a mine worked by
ANOTHER LAST STRAW.
“One Royal Commission has just inquired into the question of salaries of N.S.W. M’s.P. (incidentally
it recommended that plain members be paid £850 a year), and another has now been appointed to
inquire about a cheque with which certain Ministers’ names have been connected.”
SINBAD THE TAYPAYER: “ 'Struth, this is getting a hit too heavy!”
miners, but a surface deposit shovelled out
by gardeners or any other sort of people.
Hughes, who was rushing to establish a new
bureau or appoint an ambassador, said “Yep”
in Welsh and fled past. So the Morwell
brown coal, a cheap, inferior, easily-got sub-
stance which can’t pay the price for digging-
out that black coal does, was included with-
out its owners, the State Government, being
represented or even informed. The next
thing that befell Victorian State Enterprise
was the receipt of peremptory orders from
the Miners’ Federation to pay highly-skilled
wages for practically unskilled labor under
penalty of having all its coal supplies from
N. S. Wales intercepted and its workers
called out. An infallible Welshman is a
terrible infliction.
Black Care was roosting on Jack Fihelly’s
marble brow when a deputation of Queens-
land taxpayers called to ask him not to go
on with the compulsory clauses of his
£2,000,000 Loan Bill. “But the Government
must get the money,” replied the bewildered
young man. “Otherwise it w T ill have to close
down on its loan and other works. And that
would mean Chaos.” The deputation retired
deeply impressed, and the worried financier
rushed down to the House and shoved through
a bill for the appointment of another salaried
Minister. A queer way of providing against
Chaos, but it is the Queensland Labor way.
It is now certain that members of the
Vic. Assembly will vote themselves an extra
£2OO a year each, including the Speaker and
Ministers. Private members are now paid
£3OO each, the Speaker £lOOO, the Premier
£l4OO, and seven other Ministers £lOOO each.
The Opposition Leader draws £5OO (includ-
ing allowance of £200) and the Chairman of
Committees £540 (including allowance of
£240).
Vic. Auditor-General Norris has been heav-
ing a brick at the Railway Department for its
practice of buying motor-cars out of loans.
Of course Cohen doesn’t know : the joy-cart
gets in under such innocent heads as “Addi-
tions and Improvements to Existing Sta-
tions,” “Towards the Electrification of the
Melbourne-Suburban Lines” and so on. Still,
things much more fragile than motor-cars
are included in the permanent and reproduc-
tive works that loans pay for. For instance,
“Additions to Stations” includes the pay-
ment for cups and plates for refreshment-
rooms. In fact, this paper won’t swear that
there haven’t been times when Cohen has
also paid for the ham sandwiches.
The British Government has already, with-
in a very few years, advanced £100,000,000
at little more than nothing per cent, to buy
out Irish landlords and settle hundreds of
thousands of small, contented, independent
farmers on the soil. Also it has advanced a
few millions for house-building and it has
been heartily shot at for its pains, while it
hasn’t had the best of luck in collecting the
instalments due to it. Now it proposes to
advance another £70,000,000 and buy out the
remnant of the landlords, and settle the
rest of the small, contented, independent
farmers. Lloyd George is Welsh, and the
Welsh are a hopeful race. Ever since the
time of Bluffyn ap Eisteddfod they have
fancied their weather was going to clear up.
The 6 per cent. Federal Peace stock was
quoted the other day at £95. That is to
say, the buyer would get £6 6s. 3d. interest
and a bonus of £5 on repayment in 1930.
The security behind it is all the taxable re-
sources of all the States, including customs
and excise; .while behind the Storey Govern-
ment's 4§ per cent, closer settlement deben-
tures there are only the taxable resources of
one State, minus customs and excise. The
amount of the State issue is practically un-
limited, which makes for depreciation, and
the fact that the bonds don’t fall due for
3S years makes them the last mortgage but
one. the one being a small liability due in
1962. The question is whether the affair
is a land-settlement scheme at all, or simply
a gigantic loan device, the land being dragged
in by way of local color, just as the horse
is dragged into a Cup lottery, when it would
be 1000 times better to have the lottery
without the horse, so that no blackmailing
owner could plunder the winner. _ lor
though the land-owners are to be paid in
Storey’s short-weight paper, there is no hint
that the Government is going to accept any-
thing but hard cash; and there i.s no hint
either that what it receives is to be used to
pay off the purchase price. What is certain is
that the Government is going to take the
land at the 1920 valuation; and later im-
provements may easily make it worth double
the money. Theodore is at least frank in
his talk of a forced loan. The Storey Gov-
ernment isn’t frank; and what it proposes
isn’t exactly a loan either. Part of it is
plain theft.
“Innisfail” (N.Q.) : The Commonwealth
Government takes our sugar from us at £3O
Os. Bd. per ton. Then, having spent in refin-
ing, etc., enough to take the cost up to £37 or
so, it sells the goods for £49. It wouldn’t
be so bad if the Government kept this profit,
in relief of taxation; but actually it goes in
meeting the losses on “black” sugar. So
the white Australian sugar-grower is being
squeezed out of the industry in order that
Australia may have black-labor sugar (from
Java, etc.) at less than it costs the Govern-
ment. The natural result is that sugar is
going out of cultivation in North Queens-
land ; and sugar is the one tropical industry
we possess. Australia may want to keep
the North white; but it is doing its best at
present to rid it of the handful of population
it possesses.
Some people go so far as to say that the
N.S.W. Government hitting up the pace.
Its record for less than eight months in-
cludes four big loans put on the market, five
Royal Commissions appointed, a deficit of
nearly two millions, new taxes to the amount
of between two and three millions, the
appointment of two Judges and a pair of
Ministers accused of corruption. Also, there
was the spectacle of one Labor Minister
abusing another in the anti-Labor or capital-
istic press. At least he called him “Irish,”
apparently in disparagement. Whether that
is actionable isn’t certain. One time a
Sydney man sued for damages “inasmuch as
defendant did call plaintiff a Wesleyan,
thereby implying that he was not honest in
his business dealings.” So you never can
tell.
On the security that the A.L.P. has
abandoned: —• '
Some alarming bosh is talked on the subject of
national defence by pseudo-pacifists and persons of
that sort. The debate on Granville Ryrie’s estimates
in the House of Reps, was brightened by the obser-
vation of Fenton of Maribyrnong that “you have only
to look at the smaller countries of Europe to realise
that those which do the least to protect themselves
are the safest.” Somebody mentioned Belgium and
Switzerland, whereupon the enthusiast remarked: “If
Switzerland had been a warlike nation Germany
would have invaded her territory as she did that of
Belgium.” This is the very delirium of ignorance.
In so far as Switzerland was ready to argue the
point with an invader the Swiss were warlike and
the Belgians were not. It was precisely for this
reason that the accumulated horrors of war descended
upon the small flat country and the smaller moun-
tainous country escaped. When the war-dogs broke
loose Switzerland had a fine citizen army, whereas
Belgium had only a few regiments of regulars, some
old guns and a motley lot of town guards in quaint
uniforms and impossible hats. To have forced the
Swiss road into France would have been a tedious
and horribly costly operation, and Germany couldn’t
spare the time or the cannon-fodder. She took the
ill-defended Belgian track instead. If Fenton’s
argument were worth anything one would expect to
find Switzerland abandoning compulsory training
and Belgium having nothing to do with the awful
thing. In actual fact, Switzerland is strengthening
the conscript army which saved her from invasion
in 1914-18 and Belgium has made a beginning with
hers.
Having noted carefully that only two dis-
tricts out of 216 decided to go dry, that 143
ordered things to be left as they are, and that
only 71 wanted reduction, the Vic. Cabinet
took hold of its courage (which is almost as
large as the Melbourne Hospital’s piece of
radium) and decided to settle a handful of
Billjims as vignerons at Rutherglen. Cold
Tea is .“profoundly disturbed,” of course, ann
inclined. to blame McPherson, Oman, Pea-
cock and Barnes.

In Austria, where leaves grow red,
The hungry children weep in bed.
In Greece the eager people pine
To feel the boots of Constantine.
In Holland Wilhelm mildly sits
And hopes the world will fall to bits.
But in Australia, thanks to Hughes,
Democracy has nought to lose —
Our freedom lies (who cares a d —n?)
As dead and stiff as Noah’s ram.

Thus did Horatius in the narrow gate
Behold the lord of Luna loudly slam
His shield against the breastplate of his hate
And did not care a damn!
Thus did Leonidas with fiery eye
Move from the pass at midnight, ill content,
To seek before his hour had come to die
For Xerxes’ gilded tent!
Oh, splendid courage tried and proved again !
The ship may founder, but he keeps the deck
And boldly grasps, for all its. weight of pain,
That large, soul-shaking cheque.

The T. and G. has just come through the
first normal year since 1914. During the
previous 12 months £19,983 had been paid
out on account of final war claims, and
pneumonic ’flu cost the Society £46,509.
The latest run was a memorable one in
several respects. To begin with, the loss
rate in the Ordinary branch was under two-
thirds of the experience in the most un-
favorable of the war years, and was lighter
than for the period just prior to the war.
In the Industrial department the claims rate
has been improving year by year until it is
now only half of what it was in 1914. Here
are further details :

Notwithstanding the return to normal of
the Ordinary loss rate and the great im-
provement in the Industrial, £270,081 was
paid to policy-holders lasf year compared
with £176,704 in 1914, for during recent years
the T. and G.’s business has grown very
rapidly. The-income of the former branch is
now almost twice as large as it was in 1914;
that of the Industrial more than twice as large.
New business is still rolling in at a great pace ;
12 months ago there were 62,192 live policies
in the Ordinary branch carrying over eight
millions of assurances; during the past year
15,791 new policies assuring a further 2f
millions were written. The Industrial de-
partment captured 87,302 new policies
assuring £3,145,181.
In view of the large volumes of new busi-
ness written and the increased administra-
tion charges—the insurance clerk has re-
quired a little more in his pay-envelope to
meet h.c.l. —it is not surprising to find that
the expense rate has moved up a shade: —

The steady improvement which had been
effected in the Industrial branch has thus been
checked, though costs are still 82s. p.c. better
than six years ago. Precisely how much
the new business in the Ordinary depart-
ment is costing cannot be ascertained with
any exactness; but assuming that the old or
renewal business was handled at a cost of 7
p.c. of net premiums, then the £88,798 of first-
year premiums bagged during the latest run
cost approximately £63,100, or about 71 p.c.
By comparison with many other offices that
is a good performance, nevertheless it is about
three points higher than the figure obtained
by calculating 1919 new-business costs on
the same basis. There is one feature about
the new business which should tend to keep
costs down: the new policy-holder is seeking
larger cover than his predecessors. Last
year’s 15,791 new contracts averaged nearly
£175 of assurance apiece, £25 more than
only two years ago and £55 better than just
prior to the war. A rapid- increase in the
average amount of the policies is not always
a good feature. It is liable to mean heavy
lapses at the first pinch of hard times.
From the earlier tables it will be noted
that there is a wide discrepancy between the
figures showing net premiums and total in-
come. Interest earnings are a big factor in
insurance: in many fire and general offices
income from invested -funds wholly provide
the handsome distributions to shareholders:
in the mutual life offices interest aids
bonuses. Last year earnings from invest-
ments in the Ordinary branch exceeded total
operating costs by £19,393. Industrial poli-
cies under the best of conditions are ex-
pensive to handle ; as shown above over £34
Bs. of every £lOO of income collected by this
branch of the T. and G. went in business-
writing and administration exes., almost
double the figure in the Ordinary depart-
ment. In other words, the Industrial policy-
holder pays away £l6 15s. more per £lOO of
his premiums to canvassers, etc., than his
neighbor in the Ordinary branch; which
means that £l6 15s. p.c. less can become
available for bonuses. That should be
sufficient inducement for the Industrial in-
surer to transfer his policy to the Ordinary
branch without delay if he can manage to
pay premiums quarterly instead of subsi-
dising collectors to wear out his doormat.
But, notwithstanding the heavy Industrial
costs, sufficient funds lie in that section of
the T. and G. to provide a revenue ample to
meet more than one-third of its outgoings
apart from claims. Very profitable employ-
ment has been found for all new funds, and
as a result the interest return on average
funds has improved considerably :

1916 .. 4 14 7 „ 1920 .. 5 4 0 „
During the black days of Wilhelm’s reign
of terror The Bulletin questioned whether,
notwithstanding the heavy mortality, life
offices would eventually be any worse off as
a result of the war. The latest T. and G.
accounts confirm that suspicion. Compared
with 1914 this office is earning 11s. 6d. more
on its funds, and on four millions —the pre-
sent total is not far short of that amount--
this means an extra £23.000 p.a. which is
flowing into the Society’s coffers. .Assuming
that the 2044 war claims between 1915-18
averaged as high as £l5O apiece, then the war
cost the T. and G. about £326,000; and doubt-
less some of those policies would have become
claims even if there had been no war. With
funds expanding at their present rate and
high interest on gilt-edged securities practi-
cally assured for many years, it should not
take long to counterbalance the extra losses
with improved investment earnings. Of course,
expenses are heavier, but the pursuit of
record volumes of new business is probably
wholly responsible, for as already shown
individual assurances are larger and the cost
of handling a £lOOO policy is no greater than
that of nursing one only a tenth the size.
Anyhow, so favorable was last year’s claims
experience that after his latest valuation
actuary H. M. Jackson was in a position to
recommend a resumption of bonuses on the
pre-war scale. In the Ordinary department
£60,959 is being applied to the purchase of
reversionary bonuses (£35,998 for 1919)
and £28.794 (compared with £23,187 for
1919) is being distributed among Industrials.
This comparison shows the changes which
have been effected in the disposition of funds
since 1913: —

There is nothing exciting about this little
Brisbane building society. Investing mem-
bers have pfit up £10.056 arid paid-up mem-
bers £805: that capital and the £540 of
reserves is all the money the society is work-
ing on, for it holds no deposits and its
outside liabilities amount to only £4. At the
latest balance £11,047 was out on loan, about
a thousand less than 12 months ago, when
the management had temporarily broken away
from its usual custom and had borrow r ed a
little from outside. Having no cheap money
to work on, divs. are necessarily very
moderate. Of the £B9O interest on mort-
gages (= 7.7 p.c.), £319 went in exes., leav-
ing a distributable balance just sufficient to
give shareholders 5 p.c. and meet the divi-
dend duty thereon.
Malay Queen Rubber Plantation,
Ltd.- —A few months ago there were
indications that shareholders in rubber
plantation cos. had better prospects of
divs. than for some years. But owing
to labor troubles in Britain and U.S.A.,
world-wide financial stringency, necessi-
tating the withdrawal of support for
stocks, and the delay of Continental Europe
in shaking off its troubles, there is but a poor
market for the bumper crop of rubber the
world can harvest. Within a few months
the London price has dropped over Is. per lb.,
and at anything like recent low prices of
15d. to 18d. per lb. there are very few
rubber plantations able to show a profit on
their current outputs, particularly since h.c.l.
has lately been pinching the brown man, and
labor costs have consequently increased. The
British and Dutch planters’ associations
have mutually agreed upon a 25 p.c. reduc-
tion of outputs, with the hope of holding up
the market until the clouds pass. Even with
restricted production there is no guarantee
that market prices will do more than just
about cover costs. Still, notwithstanding
that the world can produce about four times
the quantity of raw rubber it did in pre-war
days, there are prospects of the demand, and
consequently prices, improving as industrial
and financial troubles are straightened out.,
The Malay Queen, a Melbourne concern, has
472 acres cultivated at Membang (F.M.S.),
and since production began this has been its
experience:—

The all-in cost for the past year was almost
Is. 5d., leaving a profit margin of 7-Jd. per
lb. The balance of unsold stock at June 30
(45,2421 b.) was taken into thev accounts qj;
just under Is. 2d., the year’s net profit in
this way being calculated at £3060, equal to
nearly 13| p.c. on paid capital. Of the
capital of £22,810, £7BlO is in 25 p.c.
cum. prefs., and the co. is not yet in the
position to work off any of the arrears of
divs. which have accumulated on those very
expensive shares. During the 1919 finan-
cial year the co. had to fall back on the
Malayan Government for a £4415 loan, but
by the latest balance this had been reduced
to £1750, plus £142 of accrued interest.
Other debts amounted to £5BB. Against
these total liabilities of £2480 the co. at
June 30 showed liquid assets of £2219, so
its position was not too easy. For the current
year a 120,0001 b. harvest is anticipated, but
that may be curtailed in accordance with
the restriction of outputs decided on by the
planters’ associations. Even on the basis of
a 120,0001 b. production, costs, including the
estimated outlay on capital account, are
set down at Is. SJd. per lb., and with present
market prices the outlook for the next P. and
L. account is by no means bright.

*After providing for War-time Profits Tax.
There has been a change in the form of the
accounts since the 1919 balance. The Vic.
Fair Profits Commission during the year
paid some attention to superphosphates, in
which Lyell is interested; and the directors
have been moved to remark that the Com-
mission “has placed a heavy obstacle in
the way of expansion by the too drastic
regulation of prices.” The attentions of the
Commission have also resulted in the Lyell
directors deciding to disclose precisely how
much capital was invested in the Yarraville
works, and to admit that there had been some
heavy writing down in the past. Twelve
months ago the chemical works at Yarraville
(Vic.) and Fremantle (W.A.). had a book
value (less depreciation) of £169,940; now,
however, they are shbwn at cost (£364,870)
and the general reserve fund has been in-
creased from £461,443 to £658,635, the latter
including the chemical works depreciation
reserve. Whether the whole of that general
reserve can be regarded as genuine stored-up
profit The Bulletin cannot guarantee, for
some of it may be provision against deprecia-
tion which has actually taken place. Never-
theless, there is no doubt that a large pro-
portion of the reserve can be regarded as
genuine. The juggle is further evidence of
how little the outsider can gauge actual
values of mining cos.’ assets by published
balance-sheets.
From a mining point of view it was a dull
year for Lyell. Here are some figures in
evidence: —
1916. 1918. 1919. 1920.

Gold (oz.) . . 8,865 7,042 5,538 5,164
The smaller output was accompanied by an
increase of costs per ton ore :

It took 169,649 tons material (including con-
centrates) to give 4580 tons blister last year,
so the cost per ton blister appears to have
been about £B4-—for a product going 99.03
p.c. copper, 36.70 z. silver and 1.130 z. gold.
Taking gold at, say, £5 and silver at 4s. the
value of these two metals in the blister would
be approximately £l3. The cost of producing
copper is thus about £7l/ plus shipping, re-
fining and realisation charges. This high
cost, of course, has been due to abnormal
• conditions, but there is no guarantee that
g.-m. Sticht can find sufficent labor to give
larger outputs or that he will be able to
materially reduce working costs. Anyhow,
with standard copper at under £79 London
and a doubtful future, there is nothing rosy
about the present position.
• • • » * •
The falling off of the copper output last
year was also partly due to lower values.
Mt. Lyell and South Lyell provided 107,864

Gold, oz. .. 1 .045 .038 .005 .011
No additions to ore reserves in Mt. Lyell
have shown up in recent years, and it is
now computed that in the old mine and in
the South Lyell there are still available
1,802,509 tons going .5 p.c. copper,
silver and .04oz. gold. From work done
in the northern section of North Lyell Sticht
gives a further 126,873 tons ore ' available,
making his estimated ore reserves there
1,013,518 tons, averaging 6 p.c. copper, Tjfoz.
silver and ,005 oz. gold. As all pyrites for
smelting North Lyell ore must now come
from underground mining, the co. is modifying
its metallurgical practice; it is intended to
treat a larger quantity of that mine’s ore by
increasing the output of concentrates. This
is Sticht’s programme :
The improvement contemplates to effect this
without departing, to an uneconomical degree, from
the general metallurgical principle of the blast-
furnace work. To achieve the object a preliminary
sorting plant is being- erected, in which a portion
of the North Mount Lyell ore will be selected by
means of hand-picking, which will be of higher assay
than the average of that ore, and which can be
smelted direct with pyrites, while the lower-grade
balance will be enriched into concentrates by means
of flotation. Such concentrates will then, as at
present, be blast-furnaced together with the other
ore, after proper agglomeration by means of sinter-
ing or nodulising.
The effect of higher working costs on Lyell
is strikingly illustrated by this comparison
of some of last year’s figures compared with
those for 1918 :
1918. 1920.

Smelting costs .. 149,030 154,536

It would be interesting to know how much
of the £133,067 profit for the past year
shown in the first table was derived from
mining and how much from other activities.
That £133,067, however, is before deducting
£47,582 for depreciation and £9478 for pros-
pecting. the visible net profit for the year
being £76,007, which is actually poorer by
comparison with earlier years because no
taxation has apparently been charged against
latest revenue. Twelve months ago £164,819
lay in a reserve for taxation ; it has since
been reduced to £141,841. If that approxi-
mate £23,000 is a -fair taxation icharge -
against the past year’s operations, then Lyell
made only about £53,000 net, £140,000 less
than was passed out in divs. Chiefly as the
result of this distribution the liquid surplus
of £702,880 of a year ago has been reduced
to £533,862. Liabilities are almost £200,000

heavier, for owing to the shipping strikes
earlier in the year the Kembla refinery has
been unable to overtake accumulations of
blister. To relieve the congestion 3000
tons are being sent to Brother Jonathan to
refine, but six months will elapse before
arrears are worked off. .Lyell’s present posi-
tion is that it has £533,562 of its paid capi-
tal of £1,298,195 represented by the surplus
of stocks of metals, etc., sundry debtors, and
so on, over and above its liabilities. Besides
that there are the mines, with 2,800,000-odd
tons of ore in sight; railways and rolling-
stock, £206,705 (but not worth that much
if the mines weren’t there) ; the hydro-elec-
tric plant, £129,937; mining and reduction
plants, £222,000-odd; the Yarraville and Fre-

C. J. De Garis, of the Sunraysed Settle-
ments, is transferring some of his exuberant
energy to Westralia. He has bought for
£50,000 a 47,325-acre sheep-run 40 miles
from Albany (the Great Southern railway
runs through the property), is having it
cleared and cut up into 90-acre farms, and
expects to sell them for £450,000 —the esti-
mate of “the leading Westralian land and
estate firm.” Deducting interest, commis-
sion and other expenses, “this,” says De Garis
or his press-agent, “will leave the handsome
profit of £200,000,” which would be very
handsome indeed. The .. purchaser “requires
£150,000 to materialise this proposition,” and
offers the public 1500 first-mortgage de-
bentures of £lOO each, bearing interest at 8
per cent, and repayable in five years. In
addition to his 8 per cent, the debenture-
holder is also to “get £5O free” —that is to
say, “the dividends on 50 £1 fully-paid de-
benture-holders’ shares in the De Garis Ken-
denup (W.A.) Development Co., Ltd., which
participate in profits and then revert to the
company” after they have had divs. equal to
£1 per share. De Garis himself is to receive
his purchase money in cash plus 75,000 £1
shares in the company. As a land speculation
the scheme has points, but De Garis’s press-
agent .has laid the colors on too thick. The
prospective settler is urged to grow sugar-beet,
and the construction of a sugar-beet factory,
to cost £200,000, is promised by December,
1922—that is, if the flotation of a separate
co. for that purpose is successful. But
Westralia has no beet-sugar industry
at present, and whether the plant will
thrive without irrigation in the light soil and
long, dry summer of South Groperland
—experiments are being conducted for
the first time this year—remains to be
proved. Until it is proved the advice of
the prospectus-writer may be magnificent,
but it is not business. For the rest
potatoes and apples are mentioned. No
doubt parts at least of the area will grow
both, but on these points the prospectus
screeches where it ought to give precise and
detailed information.

Two important cos. have been listed on
’Change in Melbourne. The Australian
Glass Manufacturers Co., of Spotswood, on
the Yarra. has a capital of £500,000, in £1
shares, of which the proprietors take £412,849
in ordinary shares. The co. has been estab-
lished 30 years, and the name of McNeilage
is best known in connection wdth it. The
other big float is Myers (Australia), Ltd.,
formed to consolidate the interests of Sidney
Myer, the Bourke-street draper. Capital is
,£1,500,000 in 1,000,000 ordinary and 500,000
preference shares of £l. each. The first
issue will be 590,000 ordinary shares to the
selling cos., and 150,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
are offered for subscription. The prefs. are
to get an additional 1 p.c. if more than 124
p.c. be paid on the ordinary shares.

Mt. .Cuthbert’s smelting campaign .during
the past half-year was restricted to a run of
99 days early in the term, when 1116 f tons
blister were won from 17,912 tons ore. Then
shortage of explosives and want of funds
caused a hold-up. The smelting done
brought out a dozen defects in the furnace,
so a lot of cash had to go in strengthening
plant to withstand the stronger blast needed
to get recoveries from the different class of
ore that has now to be furnaced. These
troubles, labor shortage and higher costs of
mine and smelter essentials," together with
a waning copper market, have put finances
back. Altogether £95,879 went in mining,
smelting and other charges to win £85,078
of copper. After allowing for interest and
depreciation the co. went £24,266 to the bad
as a result of the half’s operations. The
list of debts is now as follows: —
Debentures . . . . £55,000
Deferred creditors .. . 17,932
Sundry creditors • 30,546
Bank balances .. .. 151,923
Total .. .. £255,401
Against that quarter-million-odd are copper
stocks taken into account at £142,657 and
sundry stocks and debtors, approximately
£34,000, together over £176,000. On what
basis the copper in hand is valued chairman
Pigott does not disclose. The co. thus owes
practically £BO,OOO more than it has in liquid
assets. That is Cuthbert’s position after-
having treated altogether 123,724 tons ore
and winning 7185 tons blister. Averaging the
copper at £9O per ton —which should not be
out of the way—Cuthbert has had £640,000
from metal. The slide is reminiscent of
North Lyell’s record before that show- was
mopped up by Bowes Kelly. Cuthbert’s
saving grace is that developments are com-
ing to its aid. When the co. first stranded,
Kalkadoon helped it off the rocks. Now
prospecting shows that the Orphan mine
shoot, instead of being a squib, is bisected by
a cross run of ore, which has been proved for
225 ft. to be over 20ft. wide. With a little
sorting the grade can be got up to 8 to 10
p.c. copper. Ore reserves are estimated at
193,500 tons, containing 13,185 tons cop-
per, the four big contributing mines being:—
Copper
Ore. Contents.
Cuthbert .. .. 40,000 tons 2400 tons
Kalkadoon . . .. 30,000 ~ 3000 ~
„ (flux) . . 80,000 „ 4000 „
Orphan . . . . 35,000 „ 2800 „
So there may yet be hope for Cuthbert.

Ive’s Reward (W.A.) has no cash with
which to complete its option, so the direc-
tors have given one v.endor 25,000 paid
shares and a post-dated promise of £9OOO
cash, another 22,500 paid shares, and a
third 7500 contributing shares and £14,500
worth of 8 p.c. debentures. Boiled down
the position is this: In order to hang on for
a further 12 months to an option which will
probably never be exercised, the. co. has
handed to the vendors 55,000 paid shares
and promises of £23,500 cash. Whether the
lOU’s will be worth anything remains to be
seen ; anyhow, that is the vendors’ funeral.
But the issue of 55,000 shares is certainly
going to have an effect on the market which
won’t be to the advantage of original
backers.

George Gunton, running Edna Battler’h
second advent near Southern Cross (W.A.).
assumes “with reasonable confidence” that
there will be ample ore to keep the co.’s
10-liead battery going till another lift can
be taken out and new levels opened up off
the mainshaft. There may be a golden halo
round the poppet legs, because Gunton talks
of provision having been made at the battery
for extra stamps, but he is very indefinite
about his stock-taking.

Two prospectors got on to another rich
patch at Kurnalpi the other day, and out of
a small hole a few hundred ounces of dollied
gold were taken. Seven years ago one of
the finders obtained 700 oz. from a patch not
far from the one just discovered, and two
other men found a big nugget. In the
early ’nineties Kurnalpi was famous as an
alluvial field.

Leslie Y. Waterhouse, who made a good
name for himself with the- Mount Lyell Co.,
has now summed up both the mining and the
treatment position at Mt. Hope (N.S.W.).
The mine at once attracted him, but the
construction work on the mill is calling for
a great deal of reorganisation. On the
engineering side M- Hope has .secured Tre-
gaskis, also of Lyell, and the first section
of the gas-power plant is really at last in
tune. Mt. Hope requires more money, and
proposes an issue of debentures. It is a
bad time to be looking for cash ; most people
prefer to buy in a boom and sell when things
are depressed.
Last month’s work on Bendigo Amal-
gamated’s • five square miles of mines gave
48820 z. from 7834 tons milled. Such a ton-
nage is ludicrous for a concern with a big-
register like that of the Amalgamated. The
trouble is that only eight shafts are on
ore, and four of these failed to get more
than 500 tons each, while another reached
only 700 tons. Carlisle produced 1617 tons
of 19|dwt. stone, Constellation 1549 tons of
26jdwt. quartz, and UniD 1874 tons of
stuff going only 3|dwt. Constellation’s bril-
liancy is fading fast, and unless a fresh
shoot makes at the extension of the reef in
McDuff ground Amalgamated has little that
is cheering ahead. Prospecting still pro-
ceeds in a dozen other shafts, but it is all
dreary toil and little glitter.
Those associated with Teddy Dyason soon
join the ranks of trippers. Wilkinson was
sent north to sell gold after Picot had gone
abroad to peddle Bendigo Amalgamated
shares. Then Dyason took on a skirmishing
tour in India, and Wilkinson has hied back
to Malaya and Hong Kong. Then Picot
moved to ’Frisco and N’York. and now
Moline joins him, presumably on a rubber-
plant purchase mission. Dr. Ffrost still
remains in Bendigo to greet Scarborough on
his return from Badak.

Winding-up meetings have been called by
the following mining cos. in the group con-
trolled by P. W. Tewksbury, a pioneer of
dredging in N. S. Wales and Vie.: Pioneer,
Amalgamated, Tewksbury Prop..
Araluen, Vic. Araluen, South African, and
Mynpachts. The last two cos. were formed
in Sydney and Melbourne some years ago to
dredge for gold in S’Africa ; the preliminary
prospecting was done by J. C. Watson imme-
diately after he retired from politics—the
first claims that were ever prospected by the
ex-Prime Minister of a continent. P. W.
Tewksbury, it is said, intends to settle in
London, and those who know him won’t be
surprised if in due course a scheme for divert-
ing and dredging the Thames is forthcoming.
Brilliant Extended, the old Charters
Towers co. which acquired the Salmon tin
mine at Kangaroo Hills (Q.) last year,
recently purchased the Titanic claim, in the
same district, for £5OOO. The purchase included
about 40 tons rich ore at grass. The shaft
is down 90ft. on a very high-grade pipe of
kaolin and tin-stone, and the co. will be
unlucky if it does not get its money back
inside of six months, as there is a very
rich shoot running through the floor of the
shaft. The last crushing from the Salmon
yielded only 525. a ton for 147 tons, and as
this was unpayable the co. suspended opera-
tions and will give the Titanic a trial. The
Salmon, however, is worth further develop-
ment: there is a strong lode Bft. thick at a
depth of 45ft.
* * * *
Glassford mines, back o’ Gladstone (Q.),
are feeling the pinch of a low copper market,
and are in temporary difficulties, after hav-
ing spent £5OOO recently on a compressor
plant for the rock-drills. All hands were
put off at the end of October, and reconstruc-
tion is in the air. The Blue Bag, belonging
to the Glassford Creek Co., is the main lode
in the district, but there are smaller lodes
which have contributed in the past. The
Blue Bag has been turning out ore carrying
about 10 p.c., and also small gold and silver
values.
* * * *
A Gympie (Q.) claim, belonging to Mitchell
and party., and adjoining the No. 1 North
Smithfield Syndicate’s ground, has given
some exceptionally rich pickings from the
Columbia line of reef. In August last .550 z.
smelted gold were got from 15cwt. stone, and
last month a 24cwt. parcel gave 60oz. gold.
The XYZ syndicate, after having spent
£lOOO on opening a new gold show at Glen-
bar, in the Tiaro district (Q.), has applied
for exemption. Ten closely-parallel veins
have been disclosed, but a couple of trial
crushings sent to Gympie have cooled en-
thusiasm, the best going only sdwt. There
were several good alluvial finds in the dis-
trict after the Gympie rush had settled down,
and the idea that there is some good gold
still knocking around has encouraged an-
other party to take up a lease close by.
Meanwhile the XYZ is considering whether
it will raise further cash and see what lies
deeper down.
Cecil Ryan, in giving Pioneer tin, Brad-
shaw’s Creek (Tas.), two years’ life, pro-
tects himself with a few ifs —if the western
extension of the gutter continues, if labor
proves reasonable, and so on. Deeper work-
ing in the lead adds to costs, and it is obvious
that as the face gets further along the lead
the tin contents tail off. That is demon-
strated by the latest figures:—
r~ —Recovered N
Sluiced Tons
Year ended c. yd. Oxide. per c. yd.
June, 1919 .. 481,200 2601 1.2401 b.
June, 1920 .. 534,800 272| 1.1421 b.
1900 to 1920 .. 10,395,500 2881 1.5701 b.
Costs have moved from 5.915 d. per yd. to
6.974 d. Drought told on the yardage last
half-year, and higher wages sent up costs.
The better average of tin obtained for the
latest run was more apparent than real, as
without the inclusion of 31 tons of high-
grade concentrates the average yield per yd.
would have dropped to about lib. The co.’s
little Argonaut claim, near St. Helens, has
to date yielded 325 f tons oxide from
849,600 yd. and has paid well. ■ The last six
months’ experience was not satisfactory, be-
cause drought and trouble with the pipe-
line forced costs to over 9d. per cub. yd.
Despite all the drawbacks, Ryan did his
work so well that 3s. 6d. per share went into
shareholders’ pockets last year out of a profit
of £34,220 earned, and there is still a nest-
egg of £20,700 made up of stores and tin
unsold. Ryan is questing after a second
Pioneer, but can’t find it.
The Speck’s tin production continues to
decline, due chiefly to the lower-grade ore
nowadays treated. Recent recoveries by
various mines have been as follows: Mt.
Lindsay, 1.55 p.c. ; Renison Bell, .65 p.c.;
Bischoff Extended, .5 p.c.; Royal George,
.37 p.c.; Boulder-Dreadnought, .27 p.c.; Bis-
choff. .25 p.c.; Briseis, 1.711 b. per yd.; Arba,
1.451 b.; Pioneer, lib. A fall in the market
price of tin to £2OO would put most of them
out of business.
* * * *
Strikes and fuel shortage sent Bischoff
Extended (Tas.) £2591 to the bad during the
past six months. There were only 79 running
days, and ore treated dropped from 13,000
to 7000 tons. The co. has been accustomed
to wdn a profit from a 12in. run of ore, and
lately there was some fuss over the fact
that it had tumbled into a 4ft. make at the
Jvo. 9 level north. This stone goes .8 p.c.
tin, compared with an average recovery for
the last 7000 tons crushed of .53 p.c. But
it is no good to Extended with present
market prices and high working costs, and
the old show has now ''closed down. It is
questionable whether it will ever get to work
again. At the balance liquid assets totted-
up £12,409, total debts amounting to only
£l7OO.
* * * *
Shareholders of No. 3 North Columbia,
Gympie (Q.), have authorised reconstruction
to test the theory of mine-manager Williams
and geologist Ball that the second series of
black slates have been faulted down in the
vicinity of 150 ft. Money is to be raised to
continue the east crosscut at the 1793 ft.
level, to try to intercept this usually rich
formation. The wolf is being kept off by
small crushings from other parts of the mine:
27 tons from the 160 ft. level has just
returned 60oz. gold.
A diamond man who was in Hamburg
two months ago scouts the cabled claim that
the Nobel Dynamite Co. is now in a posi-
tion to manufacture artificial gems at about
two-thirds of the price of natural ones. He
states that the only truth in the report is
that the Nobel Co. has been offered processes
for the manufacture of artificial diamonds
and other precious stones, and that it has
agreed to examine them.

Hughes’s first presentation' cheque was
nearer £25 than £25,000. It occurred in
1894, after Hughes had got into the N. S.
Wales Parliament and had had to walk to
most of his meetings because he couldn’t raise
the fare. His election committee celebrated
the victory at a feast held in an. upper room
of Ellis’s Coffee Palace, now being demol-
jshed. The venue was humble and so were
some of those present. And humble—very
humble —was the cheque.
H. N. Bfirwell is the seventh lawyer to

It looks as if there will be wigs on the
green when Archbishop Kelly returns to his
Hock (he’s en route now by way of the
Cape) from the Conference in Rome. He
was one of the prelates who did not put their
pen to a protest against the English Govern-
ment's treatment of brother-archbishop
Mannix.
The Bulletin regrets the death of its old
friend, Conroy of the Yap, who used to drop
in to the office every few weeks to say that
it was the wrongest paper in the world and
he loved, it best. Conroy was a man of
large ability, hopeless judgment, brilliant in
spasms and erratic always. Bank clerk,
barrister, surveyor, politician, land specu-
lator, squatter—he was all these in turns.
It was quite characteristic of him that his
last political contest was against, Joe Cook
in the most hopeless district of the State.
Duncan Mcßryde, one of the old group of
Broken Millionaires, faded out the other day
.at Toorak. Coming-from Argyllshire in 1872,
when a braw laddie of 1!), he soon looked
around for sheep country, and got hold of
Mount Poole (N.S.W.). Then, like most
other Far Western squatters, he fell or was
pushed into Broken Hill, and was a director
of the Proprietary Co. for over 80 years.
Settling in Victoria he was in and out of the
Leg. Council for a quarter of a century. Bent
made him Minister for Works and Health
when the Ministry was on its last legs at
the end of 1908, but he had only 10 weeks
of office. Easy-going, with a nice, persuasive
hameland accent, he was liked by most people
and thoroughly enjoyed his chief recreation
—moneymaking. Two daughters (one of
whom is the wife of surgeon Leary, of Sand-
ringham) will divide the contents of a fat
stocking.
Tom Ileney, who left the S. M. Herald a
couple of years ago, has tired of the life of
leisure, and has accepted the editorship of
the Brisbane Telegraph in succession to his
old friend Dr. “Whiskers” Ward. Heney,
who is a son-in-law of the late Henry Gullett,
is 58; Dr. Ward is 71.
Parsons are expressly debarred from sitting
in the Vic. Parliament, but there is nothing
to prevent them serving on municipal councils,
So F. Stillwell, Anglican, of Portland, the
cradle of Vic. settlement, has secured elec-
tion to the borough council, and may become
mayor, with the right to put fur over his
surplice.
Billy Little, Papuan miner, explorer, ex-
M.L.C. and tax-collector, pegged his last
■claim in the Port Moresby Hospital on
October 26, after a long fight. Coming to the
colony in ’96, when Ede and Lobb found the
Woodlark Island goldfield, the big-hearted
Australian followed the fortunes of Gira,
Yodda, Milne Bay and Lakekamu fields with
varying success. Fortune did not load him up ;
but if he had little gold, he had the affection
of nearly every worth-while man in the
island. From 1907 to 1918 he sat as a
non-official member in the Legislative Coun-
cil ; when he resigned it was to inaugurate
the Native Taxation scheme, and he held an
appointment as tax-collector when the call
came.
Just before the House of Reps, went into
recess Jim Page (Q.) was “named” in a
curious row with members of his own party.
Joe Cook had moved the suspension of the
Standing Orders to enable new business to
be introduced after 11 p.m., and as the
motion, if carried, promised an all-night
sitting, Page grew very cross with Tudor,
Maloney, McGrath and Fenton, who voted
with the Government —they desired to expe-
dite business so that the House might shut
up on the following day. He plastered his
brethren with “Dirty rats!” and other com-
pliments as they glode rather sheepishly back
to their seats. In the general disturbance
that followed his bellow created a din of its
own, and, being easily identifiable by the
Speaker, was marked down for the usual
punishment. Then was seen the spectacle
of a now genuinely-concerned House, from
Joe Cook down, trying to make the most
popular member in it apologise and save
himself from the suspension that was hang-
ing over him. But Page, boiling with
vituperation, waved everybody away and
strode out of the Chamber, just beating the
division that made him ineligible for further
argument that evening. It was the first
time such a thing had happened to the burly
Northerner in nearly 20 years of service.
“Jeames” among the strawberry-leaves:—
The Duke of Westminster, who married Mrs.
Rowley last week, is one of the richest peers. Most
of the Buckingham Palace-road belongs to him; also
miles of streets further west. He looks older than 41,
having lived hard and well most of his life, but is
still good-looking and in general very much the
suburbanites’ idea of a millionaire peer. He never
hit it off with his first wife, who wa,s the youngest
daughter of the late Mrs. Cornwallis West—the
shrewdest match-making mother in London in her
day—and very nearly escaped marrying her. The
duke is one of the best polo-players in England, and
his money has always been available to help the
British team against America. He is the first of
his rank to win a D.S.O. The decoration was not
acquired on a staff job either, but in action. The
lady he has chosen is no pauper herself. Her father
founded the Nelson line and made a further fortune
out of chilled meat.
Robert Sands; of Sydney, had a birthday
party a few days ago; he was 69. When he
was born his father, John Sands, founder of
the big Sydney printing firm, had his busi-
ness premises where they are to-day. At the
party were three employees whose aggregate
service with “John Sands” totted up 168
years, and there are 47 who have averaged
over 32 years. The firm has been 83 years in
existence, the original stand being now
covered by Farmer’s in George-street.
Dick Tontcher has been again pacified by
being appointed Chairman of the Vic. Rail-
way Committee. This is the only picking he
has managed to get in the 23 years he has
been in Parliament. He succeeded McLellan
MUTCH and DOOLEY, of the Ministry,
and VALENTINE CARLYSLE ROSS
HOOD JOHNSTON, M.L.A. for Bath-
urst —the three N. S. Wales politicians
into whose alleged connection with a
cheque said to have more or less to do
with the Georgeson Wheat Commission
still another Royal Commission is now
inquiring.
(“The Dove”) as member for Ararat, and
then became the representative of Stawell
and Ararat. His worst disappointment was
when, after whipping for Irvine to oust the
first Peacock Government, no reward came
his way.
T. R. Ashworth, who as president of the
Vic. Employers’ Federation has been in the
limelight lately, particularly in scoffing at
the Commission’s recommendation of a basic-
wage of 19s. sd. a day in his State, was in
the Vic. Assembly from 1902 till 1904, while
the Kyabramapootra fever was raging. He
was a bit too bookish in Parliament, but had
the makings of a good member. It was bad
luck for him, however, that he came in as a
’Brama,' for the public when it got con-
valescent pounded that set properly every
time it got a chance.
William Wallace died at Hobart lately
after 56 years of life, of which he had put
in 23 as the Speck’s Secretary for Mines.
He had a deal of out-of-the-way knowledge
about mines and such things at his finger-
ends, and never begrudged giving it to an
intelligent inquirer.
“The Oldest”: Apropos the expulsion of
Ezekiel Baker, one of the two members who
have been expelled the N. S. Wales Assem-
bly (the other being W. P. Crick), an
extraordinary circumstance was that it was
the Grenfell Record, which Baker himself
had founded, that published the report of the
final meeting of the Milburn Creek Copper
Co., and thereby caused Ezekiel all his
trouble.
“Rio”: During an after-dinner talk in
Cairo one evening in 1916 Ross Smith told
the wife of a light horse officer‘‘that he in-
tended one day to fly to Australia. “Oh,”
said the lady, “will you take a letter to mv
baby?” The young man from S. Aus. agreed,
and straightway it was written and given
into his custody. When he flew to India
and explored the Malay Peninsula to get
data for the Australian flight the letter was
with him. It was aboard the ship that went
down with most of his belongings, but was
recovered somewhat stained. The day before
he left London on his famous journey Smith
wrote an account of the genesis of the letter
and its vicissitudes, and enclosed it with the
original document in an envelope, which he
addressed to the child and placed in the first
aerial mail. In due time the missive written
four years before was delivered to the writer,
who had in the meantime returned to Aus-
tralia, and her baby. The incident throws
a high light on Ross Smith’s character, both
as an airman and a man, and shows that
the flight to Australia, like all really great
achievements, was the result of years of
thought and preparation.
There aren’t any doubts about the value
of the East-West railway in the minds of a
citizen originally from Syria but now in the
S. Aus. stock and station-owning business,
with a little horse-racing on tile side. From
Ivalgoorlie to Port Augusta he has brought
nearly 40,000 sheep, picked up in the West at
15s. or so, and sold over east for nearly
double. The rail freight for the 1050-mile
trip runs about 3s. a head.
Henry Weston, dead at New Plymouth
(M.L.), at 83, had kept the wheels of the
Taranaki Herald going since 1867. The
paper had been running 15 years when he
took it over —the Ninth Wonder of the Maori
world: for there were only eight printing
presses in the islands ahead of the Taranaki
Hera r.o’s.
Keith Smith’s engagement with the picture
people for the tour of Maoriland ended at
Ashburton, but he did
extra stunts in Marl-
borough and Nelson, as
he wanted to go whaling
oft: Tory Channel with
the Pic ton whalers.
Wh e n li e arrived li e
found the whaling season
was over, but Will Law-
son took him for a spurt
in one of the 30-knot
w h a ling launches and
laid him alongside men
who knew the game.
They made the young
knight’s hair curl with
tales of how lumps as
big as billiard-tables are
blown off leviathans with
gelignite bombs after the
speed-boats have over-
take n them. Though
baulked of his sport at
sea, Keith had his till of
deer-stalking at Lake
Rotoiti, on the highlands
between Blenheim and
Nelson. The snow was
down to the water’s edge, game was plenti-
ful and Keith let his whiskers grow for
a week.
Ex-Senator Teddy Needham was one of
Hugh Mahon’s opponents in the Ivalgoorlie
selection ballot, and that must have been
the unkindest cut of all. For Edward and Hugh
had been fellow-members for 13 years, and
the former had a State Labor nomination for
North Perth, with a fair-to-middling chance
of winning the seat. Moreover, Needham
was an' occasional visitor to those gather-
ings of dissatisfied exiles on Wren’s pony
racecourse, and just after he ceased to be
a Senator he sawed out a speech, on the
war and Irish politics, that was vitriolic
enough for anything, if the Argus reporter
was any judge. It shows what may hap-
pen in his adversity to a politician who has
never taken the trouble to make friends.
Victor Nelson Hood, secretary to various
State and Commonwealth Governors, and
afterwards private sec. to'Queen Mary, has
gone into the wine industry in Italy. As
a result of the good impression he made in
South Aus., old Mrs. Barr Smith, who died
lately, left him £3OOO. Hood is a descendant
of the Nelson family, and his elder brother
is Duke of Bronte—a title given to the
Admiral by the grateful Italians. The two
brothers are growing grapes on a small family
estate in' Sicily.
A LIBERAL EDUCATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“As a young man, when I was endeavoring to make
myself proficient in the noble art, I had a number
of very estimable friends in the boxing fraternity in
Sydney—Jack Fuller, Gentleman George Dawson,
Tut Ryan, Mick Dooley, Shadow Maber, Chiddy Ryan
and others. They knew all about the bad talent, and
put me wise to them. 1 have knocked about the
Golden Gate and other resorts of the push, and know
wheh a man ought to be in gaol and when he ought
not. I know the sort of tale a man can tell.” —
Ryrie, Assistant Commonwealth Minister , on the
Defence Estimates.
Myself when young did eagerly consort
With rock-chivved worthies of the genus sport,
And, gi'ateful for the lessons that they gave,
Those men of brawn, I bought them many a quart.
They showed me how to uppercut, and how
To jab the left on boko or on brow,
' To swing and hook ancl counter —in a word,
To spiflicate the sanguinary cow.
Shadow and Chiddy, Tut and Jack and Mick!
The way to conjugate the verb to lick
Ye taught me, and this also—to discern
A wroughter from an artist with the pick;
And that is why, though older than Lavelle
And rather large about the Darby Kel,
I’m up to all the talent’s little tricks —
I know the sort of tale a man can tell.
Those were the days! When Griffo ruled in state
And pushes sang their raucous hymns of hate
And bottles crashed against the referee —
Ah, Youth and Wallop at the Golden Gate!
Once more I see them through a mist of years
(A recollection not unnrixed with beers),
Those quaint instructors of my vanished youth,
Their fractured snouts and cauliflower ears.

RICH MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
All are piteous in their grief ;
Pity the rich man fat and white,
Pity the poor man in the night,
Pity the beggar by the way,
Pity the thief who fears the day ;
Each has his sorrow, each a thrall,
But the poor rich man is the saddest of all.
The rich man’s gold weighs down his heart,
His soul is dusty with the mart,
His eyes are hungry with his greed,
All his gain will not meet his need,
For joy of sunshine and the sky
Are little things he cannot buy ;
Snug in plenty the worm of dearth
Has gnawed out the heart of the beautiful earth.
The poor man munches at white bread,
Loves his wife who is fat and red,
Strives with relish for better things,
Nurses the kids .and hoarsely sings;
The beggar laughs at the busy folk—
Laughs with the sparrows at the joke—
Loves the trees ip the golden sun
And a fig for life when all’s said and done!
Wrapped in the gloom when the night is still
Stands the thief as the small mice shrill,
Fast he tosses his dice with Fate....
Someone’s hand on the garden gate!
But waxing fat and growing cold
The rich man finds that he is old;
Seeking to capture sweet dreams fled
He’s shocked to discover he’s coffined and dead.

SOCIETY
PENFOLD'S
WINES
IN THE BOOM.
S TELIA: “They say there's going to he a
great revival of swimming this season.”
B ELLA: “Yes, I’ve got a new hoy, and I’m
going to learn again.”
“The Parson”: It was Dickens who noted
that only the good seemed to be buried in
cemeteries. But a finer, more spontaneous
tribute than any I have seen graven upon
stone was paid to his wife by a Woolloo-
mooloo (Sydney) resident. “Struth, Par-
son,” he said, the tears streaming down his
honest face, “she was one of the befct women
that a man could ’ope to live with. You’d
’ardly believe it, but we were married for
25 years, and I never ’ad to lift me boot
to ’er once.”
“Spine Case”: They are still cheerful
beggars, the most hopeless of them. The
“Chinese missionary” was paying a visit to
the hostel —the home for the “perma-
nently disabled.” She was full of sym-
pathy. At last she came to the room
containing Darky and his two cobbers, Tiger
and Snow. Darky had stopped one in the
hips, and in consequence his lower joints had
stiffened. After consoling the boys, she was
about to go, when she turned to Darky with
a beseeching look: “And you’ll sometimes say
a prayer for the mission, won’t you?” “Aw,
it ain’t no good asken’ ’im, missus,” chips
in Tiger—“ ’e can’t bend ’is knees.” #
“Bildad”: In case anyone should like to
know where N.S.W. Motherhood Minister
McGirr and his colleagues got
their child-pension scheme,
one book that may help in
the search is Oscar Brown*
ing’s “History of the Modern
World,” published by Cassel.
The system was established
in England in 1796 —124
years ago. The pensions
were small, but as prices and
ideas went then they were
as large as those McGirr pro-
poses. It was a local-gov-
ernment business, but applied
in most parishes. In poor
families all the children re-
ceived an allowance —which
makes the proposal to subsi-
dise only the third and
subsequent children seem
mean. Also, the mothers re-
ceived an allowance. Ille
gitimate children and their
mothers were included, so
young women with three or
four young illegitimates were
sought in marriage. They
brought to their husbands
four or five separate allow-
ances, and had to some ex-
tent the pick of the marriage
market. A proposal to sub-
sidise .fathers also to the ex-
tent of a few shillings a week
was favored by advanced
philanthropists. The scheme
burst because, England not
.having an easy-going loan
policy, the local rates had to
cover the bill, and hundreds
of farms were abandoned, not
because of rent which could be borne, but
because of taxes which couldn’t. In the
sudden revulsion of feeling there was inaugu-
ated the regime of Bumble and Oliver Twist.
* * * *
“Greg” : Isn’t it about time something was
done to compel private “detective” agencies
to register? The opinion of Bench and Bar
is indicated by the fact that no Judge will
accept the unsupported .testimony of an
inquiry-agency tout, nor would any solicitor
let go into court a case based largely on
such evidence. There have been instances
where the private de-
tective, after having
been hired for the col-
lection of evidence by
one side, has sold out
to the enemy and
pocketed a tidy little
cheque from both
parties. And that is
no more than a sample
villainy. The occupa-
tion furnishes a safe
and sure retreat for
any black-sheep mem-
ber of the force who,
having gone over the
official odds, has been
cast out of his job, and
a census of the private
inquiry agents of Syd-
ney or Melbourne
would reveal the
whereabouts of prac-
tically every dismissed
member of the Crimi-
nal Intelligence De-
partment of both cities
during the past 10
years. If the authori-
ties consider it to be
dangerous to the public
good that these men
should remain in
official positions, where they are at least
under some supervision, how much more
dangerous must it be that they should be per-
mitted to work unchecked?
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: The trick of “passing the kid”
was played at the expense of a few Lotha-
rios in the A.I.F. In one case, when an amor-
ous Digger was leaving Weymouth, the lady
of his roving affections appeared on the plat-
form, apparently, quite calm and reconciled
to events. She waited until the train
was about to move, and then she asked him
if he wasn’t going to kiss baby good-bye. “Er
course,” said William, affably, and the
matron handed the infant in through the
window. With that she fled, and Bill hasn’t
seen her since. The State has the baby. In
another case the mother arrived in Sydney
from England to find her warrior about to
marry another woman. Neither the bride
nor her people were moved to cancel the con-
tract by the deserted one’s story, but when
the day arrived baby was found among the
wedding presents.
“Costs”: The White Slavery agitation
started some weeks ago by the Sydney press
is causing the inevitable reactions. A girl
of 14 called on the white wife of a Chinese
pleading for food and succor from a heartless
home circle. She was taken in and fed;
and then the husband urgently requested her
to go away, which she did. She returned the
next day with further complaints and was
again fed, but this time the embarrassed
Chow fled privily to the nearest police-
station in the interests of his reputation. It
HIS OWN FAULT.
“ Haven't I met you somewhere before?”
“Very likely. I’ve been there quite a lot
lately.”
was said many years ago that no man should
trust himself alone in a railway carriage
with a strange woman. Nowadays, owing to
the spread of education and the pervasion
of the unabridged police report, it is equally
perilous to have anything to do with a
strange child. At about the time the 14-year-
old was striving to provide a scoop-seeker’s
holiday in Chinatown, a female infant of 5i
was pulling the' legs of the Woolloomooloo
police with a tremendous yarn about some
unknown men who had tied her to a
railing and then left her for many hours.
The police believed her and feared the worst
—till such time as it appeared that she had
been "‘wagging it” from school and was
romancing to ward off punishment. Mean-
time two young men have just begun three
years’ penal servitude apiece for assault, on
the uncorroborated evidence of two children
who may be as casual as the youngster who
attempted to force herself on the Chinese
household above mentioned, and as imagina-
tive as the baby with the circumstantial yarn
about the miscreants and their ropes.
“Audio”: Talking about queer military
orders, the most so I got was in Egypt. On
garrison duty at Kasr-el-Nil there was never
any difficulty about finding men for the mid-
night picket. The chance of seeing night-
life in Cairo was rushed by everyone, from
major to batman. Well, one night I went as
sergeant with our senior major, a quiet little
non-smoking teetotaller. A wife and sev'en
children awaited him on the farm, and the
bush church was short of a local preacher
during his_ absence. “We mustn’t miss this
joint, sir,” I said as we passed a well-
known establishment: “we’re sure to find
some of the missing here.” As we penetrated
to one of the inner rooms a barely-clad
female threw herself into the Major’s arms
and cried: “It ees Tommy! How kind to
visit ’ees little Mimi again!” The Major
struggled frantically to free himself, and
as we left the place he whispered: “Sergeant,
I’ve never seen this woman before. That’s
an order. Understand?” I understood.

“Jarrahlander”: Disappointing to me are
the Sydney bathing-beaches, with their
flagged strips of ocean frontage beyond which
it is unsafe to venture. Cottesloe (W.A.)
has a longer stretch of negotiable surf than
Manly, Coogee, Bondi and Bronte put to-
gether, and it has this further advantage',
that there is no reason to be afraid of sharks.
Perhaps because there is abundance of finny
food available the Westralian shark is un-
commonly benevolent towards human beings.
Between October and April 30,000 or 40,000
people bathe in the Indian Ocean between
Bunbury and Geraldton (300 miles), and you
never hear of anyone being pulled under.
Nervous people are far more afraid of the
cobbler, or catfish, which lurks in the Swan
River and is sometimes encountered off
Cottesloe and Rottnest. Its sting is almost
as dangerous as the glad-eye of a Manly
flapper in the one-piece gown in which she
publishes herself.
Next year’s estimates of the Prahran
(Vic.) council will include something for
insect powder. When the councillors were
considering this year’s estimates they were
so infernally bitten by little things which
came out ,of the cracks in their chairs that
they went outside to scratch, and the meeting
lapsed for want of a quorum. Some coun-
cillors said it was fleas, but others reckoned
it was worse.
“Val” : I'll never forget a concert we had
at Winnipeg camp, near Poperinghe, after
the Pozieres nightmare. All the brass-hats
from brigade were there and all the padres.
After “Gunga Din” and the other one
about the highwayman who “rode back in the
moonlight,” Private Blank was called on for
a song. Blank, who belonged to the sanitary
squad, was a dark horse, and his item was
awaited with great expectancy. After a try-
over with the accompanist to get a suitable
vamp, he commenced “I’m Dan, Dan, the
Lavatory Man.” For —well, say, intimacy,
I’ll back it against any of the other A.I.F.
gems. After the 43rd verse the stretcher-
bearers had a busy time removing apoplectic
colonels and hysterical padres.

From an Australian woman in London: —
A mysterious Englishwoman trailing some letters
after her name pervaded Australia last year, and
clung rather desperately to various official people,
some of whom pushed her into the limelight. She
is back in London, and recently, at the Overseas
Club, she gave us her impressions of the benighted
land from which she had escaped.
“At Fremantle,” she told us, “I went on shore to
get a cup of tea and I was waited upon reahlly
quaite naicely. The girls wore red frocks with
white facings. At Adelaide I saw piles of boxes
and cases on the wharf. I asked what they contained
and was told fruit, and that it was going to Eng-
land. Half of it was rotten. In this State the chief
industries are orange-growing and raising chickens.
Then we came to Melbun, Victoreeyar. Melbun, Vic-
toreeyar, is a town surrounded by prickly-pear.
The people there in their manner are a little more
stand-offish than in Fremantle. I believe since
1914 a jam-factory has been started there. Sydney
has a wonderful ferry-steamer service; but English
women find that if they do not adapt themselves to
the customs and manners they are not understood.
In a big district near Sydney the whole of the
people are German, and a cobbler would not mend
my boots until I spoke to him in German, and then
he not only did them for me but charged me a hundred
per cent, less than usual. In one house I visited
they had a life-size figure of the Kaiser. The women
of Australia chop their own wood: I have never in
my life seen women with such arms. They are
immense riieat-eaters. Bush-fires rage everywhere,
and in one place the whole street of a town I was in
was burnt down in three hours. You can do any-
thing with the natives of Australia if you give them
sugar. New Zealand has the cheapest food in the
world and the dearest clothes. The Maoris are quite
WHEN SILENCE IS GOLDEN.
“Doing anything this week-end ?”
“Nothing to speak of.”
“H’m —I thought you'd given up that sort
of thing.”
breaking out, and on one occasion one of them spoke
to me in English, which was rather astounding.”
She left me with the impression that my own
fresh memories of Australia were all a dream and
that she was almost, if not quite, the first civilised
white woman to explore the prickly-pear jungles of
Melbourne and push among the wood-chopping sav-
ages of Sydney. But what is the Overseas Club doing
to allow such piffle on its premises?

IN THE DRY TIME COMING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The poet with prophetic eye
Looks down the years and sadly sees
The country gone entirely “dry,”
Men drinking pop with bread and cheese.
Down stretching vistas he espies
In time’s dim, damp and cellared cloisters
The cobwebbed bottles neatly rise
Of currant drinks so sweet and clear,
And ginger-beer,
And men of cheer
Take lime-juice cordial with their oysters.
The epicure of wondrous nerve
In desolate, teetotal day
Drinks lemon-syrup with hors-d’ceuvre,
And squashes with the consomme !
And through the sunburnt, droning land,
Where never pub or bar to tempt is,
Go politicians in a band
To picnic in the forest dale
On temp’rance ale,
And all the trail
Is scattered with their gaudy empties.
At banquets tendered by the State
To dignitaries, without stint
They gaily toast the potentate
With sweet extract of peppermint;
And when the knuts by night enthuse,
Where neither fear, nor pain, nor care is,
They quaff their soda out of shoes
Of pretty ladies, and tihey toast
The beauteous host
They love the most
In weak tea and Apollinai'is!
In many a well-appointed bar,
Upholding the delusion still,
Men call on Hebe for “Three Star,”
And get a pure, teetotal swill.
They swank, and roar, and kiss' the maid,
Put up their piteous pretences
On ice-cream sodas. Games are played,
And milk-shakes drunk in boosy shape.
Each Bacchic ape
Would fain escape
The tedium of his sober senses!

Remarkable Test
by Wireless Telephony
AT FEDERAL PARLIAMENT HOUSE.
Quite recently the Prime Minister, Mr.
Hughes, Members of Parliament and a num-
ber of visitors assembled in Queen s Hall at
Federal Parliament House, Melbourne, and
listened to Phonograph records played by the
Aeolian Vocalion, conveyed to Parliament
House by Wireless Telephony from the
Middle Brighton residence of the Manager
of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd.
A VOCALION of moderate price and size was used
for the experiment, and was specially selected in preference
to other makes on account of its distinctness in reproduction.
The experiment proved an immediate success, and in addi-
tion to delighting the Prime Minister, his colleagues and
visitors, the tones of the Vocalion were heard by wireless
200 miles out at sea by the Karoola and by numerous
coasters and mailboats in the vicinity. The reproduction
of a Clara Butt record was so good that a Member of
Parliament found it hard to believe the artist was not
actually singing in the room.

“Thirty-one”: The Major was a fussy ex-
Imperial who never quite compree’d our
blokes and was very fond of complimenting
the deserving. Bullecourt had just died
down, and we got the oil that the gun crews
were not likely to be ctftled for any “shoots”
during the night. Having had about one
hour’s sleep in 24 for a month, the mob
joyfully turned in. At 3 a.m. or so a spook
pushed his head into the dugout and roared
“Action No. 1,” and Joe, Ken and I went
to it. The range and angle came down; we
slung the gun roughly in the direction,
cocked her well up and bowled 30 of the best
over haphazard. Then we slept again. At
0 a.m. I was awakened with “The Major
wants you, Sarge.” “Who laid for you this
morning. Sergeant?” he asked. “Oldrini,
sir,” I answered, wondering , how many of
our own we’d killed. “I thought so; a very
good layer,” he said. “You might compli-
ment him for me, Sergeant. You were, firing-
on a ‘Minnie,’ and the third shot was a
direct hit, the rest falling all round it. Must
have caused a number of casualties. The
infantry are very pleased.” And he passed
me a congratulatory telegram. Then, as an
afterthought: “Sergeant, send the layer down
to me. I’ll compliment him personally.” So
I sent Joe down. Joe’s remark afterwards
was : “Poor blighters ! If they’d been walk-
ing down the Unter den Linden the
Town Hall would have fallen on ’em.”

As, a Macquarie-street surgeon sees it: —
At first doctors opened in Macquarie-street because
it was quiet and pleasant and nobody lived any-
where else. Slowly, abo.ut 15 years ago, they began
to live in the Suburbs, and to carry on consulting
practices, those of them who were worthy, in Mac-
quarie-street. Within later years there has been
a rush of suburban men to hang out plates in the
AND PERHAPS HE WASN’T MARRIED
EITHER.
D OLLY: “Oh, well, I suppose one-half of
the world doesn’t know how the other'
half lives.”
PEGGY: “It’s easy to he seen that the man
who made that up never lived in a
suburb.”
street of fashionable consultants, and this rush has
been doubled by the crowd of young men just home
from the war who /have had a year or two post-
war-graduate training in England, and have their
deferred pay and war gratuities in, their pockets-to
carry them through the year or two of waiting which
they expect before they make a fortune. But there
is not much chance of these young men making for-
tunes nowadays. In spite of what a late famous
professor said, very few men in Macquarie-street are
making more than bread and butter, and the large
incomes can be counted on the fingers. Unless a
man is on the staff of some large hospital, and so
has plenty of practice in out-of-the-way lanes of
his profession, he cannot survive as a specialist; and
the mere opening of a room in Macquarie-street is
not likely to increase his clientele. Most young
graduates look upon themselves as heaven-born sur-
geons ; but the power to operate is not acquired
THE ANATOMISTS.
"She has a terrible tongue!”
“Oh, my dear, that’s nothing! Did you ever see such awful teeth!”
merely by wishing to do it, nor the power to diag-
nose difficult medical cases. Hence behind many of
the brass plates of Macquarie-street sit unemployed
and anxious men who are reckoning how long their
hoarded store of capital is likely to hang out; many
are probably sorry they did not stick to the suburbs
or the country.
But supposing the rush continues, where are they
all to be put up ? A doctor needs a quiet room in
order that he may be able to hear the faint sounds
in the stethoscope ; it must, be free from dust lest
delicate instruments and experiments be spoiled; and
tlie neighborhood must be not unpleasant, because
of the susceptibilities of sick people. Possibly the
solution of the problem will be that many will give
up the idea of swaggering in Macquarie-street and
will earn a good living somewhere else. But the
real reason why so many unsuitable men rush into
surgery is not to make money, but as their method
of self-expression; just as crowds of men take up
art and literature on whom the mantles of Raphael
and Shakspeare will never fail. There is a‘ great
joy in the artistic removal of an appendix. Probably
medicine must now be looked upon, like art, as
a profession in which it is almost impossible to
make a large income. The next step will no doubt
be to nationalise it altogether.
* * * *
“Motor Man”: The dailies publish the
usual complaint. There are, it is said, “only
about 8000 motor-cars in the Sydney metro-
politan area, and to kill 17 people and in-
jure 542 in nine months is a heavy toll.”
Well, there are only 828,700 people in Syd-
ney and suburbs, but 269,255,935 of them
travelled by tram in 1920 (at least that
number paid fares and the other few millions
were deadheads). Of these 78,172,301 both
got in and got out on the wrong side, so they
should be counted twice; J.,003,002 got out
backwards, and an unknown number leaped
out when the car was going, so that no motor
man could expect them. I don’t know that
there was a single prosecution, though I
thought of instituting 117 myself. I can’t
tell how many people the 1613 sluggish
tramcars ran mver in the last nine months,
but Smith’s Official Year Book, which I have
by me, says that in 1918 they slew 20 and
damaged 792. That looks as if a tramcar
was five times as fatal as a motor. Also
the trams had 436 other accidents described
as “not connected with the movement of
tramway vehicles,” so apparently they also
kill people while standing still.
* * * *
“Harrison O.”: During recent divagations
beyond Bourke-street and West o’ the Sun-
shine it was made plain to me that the
ignorant and reprehensible foreign devil is
firmly convinced that “Tipperary” is the
national anthem of the Empire upon whose
hub the sun never rises. At Colombo
chocolate-hued youngsters raced along beside
my ’ricksha squealing the ditty and expect-
ing tokens of loyalty at the rate of a penny
per squeal. At Port Said a streak of colored
agony swarmed up the side of the boat and
proceeded .to pipe vague information anent
the distance to the Munster village as a pre-
liminary to collecting the piastres of right-
thinking passengers. In the motor-launch
which took us ashore at Naples girls who
looked like Carmen obliged with the same
old ditty, which, judging by their eye-play
and hip-movements, they imagined was of a
mofe amorous nature than it really is. At
Venice we were dining in the room of a
pub overlooking the Grand Canal. A gon-
dola came to stop outside the open window,
and a musician armed with the- inevitable
guitar let loose “The Broken Doll.” When
this (heard many times in Italy) failed to
win from us the expected lire, the light of a
great inspiration showed in the eyes of
Giuseppe, and “Tipperary” began to tinkle
from his guitar. His pained surprise when
we failed to. rise from our table and come
to the salute was only exceeded by his dis-
gust at the conclusion of the performance
when he found that our patriotism was not
even worth a couple of lire. If it had been
the glad tidings would soon have reached
Beppo, Garibaldi and other noise-makers,
and we should have had “Tipperary” with
our spaghetti for every meal.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: A shipload of English people,
so a cable says, propose to settle down in
a taxless isle in the South Seas. They are
likely to be disillusioned. The first shock
will be the discovery that there is no primi-
tive .simplicity about the modern native. All
Pacific islanders require a full return for
anything they give, and most of them demand
a bit over. It is a mistake to suppose that
the native does not need to work. Yams,
taro and manioc call for much more toil than
potatoes. Nor is the tropic soil always
amenable to reason. If the party happens
to get washed ashbre at Niue or Mangaia' its
members will need crowbars to powder the
rock before they can plant anything. The
native-born Pacific islander grows up at 14,
is middle-aged at 28, and usually dies before
he is 50. He takes everything that’s going
in the way of disease and takes it very badly.
Measles and mumps kill him ; he suffers from
some awful skin eruptions; elephantiasis is
a specialty with him, and he gets yaws,
tumors and cancer freely. With these
things for encouragement the only white
man I ever knew to tackle the back-to-nature
business was Ernest Darling. He threw
off his Yankee clothes and went to live in
a hut 2000 feet up the side of a mountain at
Papeete, Tahiti. The ’flu caught him pres-
ently and he survived three days. I don’t
suggest that he wouldn’t have got the ’flu
in N’York or ’Frisco, but he mightn’t have
got it so badly, and he would certainly have
had a better chance of beating it. I should
like to hear from that English crowd on the
question of taxless islands in, say, two years’
time.
* * * *
“Boulevardier”: It is proposed in Mel-
bourne to erect a war memorial in the form
’of an arch to cross St. Kilda-road just
south of Prince’s Bridge and to divert the
tram lines round the arch. The site is the
syncline of a switchback at the lowest point
of St. Kilda-road, the finest boulevard in
Australia, and probably the most beautiful
in the world. A cheap, perpetual memorial
of the war would be to change the name of
this delightful highway to Victory-avenue. If,
however, a grandiose monument to Australia’s
army, which would be an arch and not a
pylon or a cenotaph, be decided upon, then
if should be set on a high hill, not in a
low hollow. I have seen every famous monu-
ment in both hemispheres, and the Arc de
Triomphe in Paris seems to offer the most
appropriate exemplar for Melbourne to imi-
tate. It ought not to be anything useful,
but simply an architectural permanent
tribute to our noble living and our great dead
soldiers. The heights of Elizabeth. Swanston
and Bourke streets all offer suitable sites.
When you come to think of it, what a veri-
table ragtime city, raucous and syncopated,
Melbourne has become! Everything is con-
centrated in four main streets and in a mere
small portion of them. Bourke-street is a
repulsive thoroughfare—shabby, ugly, lurid,
calling for the use of dynamite, fire and the
axe. Elizabeth and Swanston are merely
funnels for foot passengers, noisy, smelly
and overcrowded. Elizabeth and Swanston
from 5 to G o’clock are every bit as horrible
as the approaches to Brooklyn and London-
Bridges. Fancy a city of 700,000 having-
one suburban railway station on the south
side of the city, and virtually none on its
other three boundaries! Only long-suffering
Melbourne would put up with it.
“Spare Corp” : One of the pathetic things
about the line, in spite of all the jests
they made, was the prematurely-aged appear-
ance of the soldiers who had been there any
time. There were boys of 20 and less who
looked like old men, for youth was a stuff
that didn’t endure in the trenches. I was
36 when I left the line; and I began to
realise that a change was necessary when
lusty young fellows of 40 or thereabouts,
arriving with new drafts of reinforcements,
called me “Dad.”
“Borda Isle”: There’s a story of the
supernatural in a book wherein you would
not look for it, “A Voyage to Terra Aus-
tralis,” by Matthew Flinders. In February,
1802, John Thistle and seven other men were
drowned by the capsizing of a boat off Cape
Catastrophe, near Port Lincoln. It came
out that months earlier, before the Investi-
gator left Spithead, Thistle had gone to an
old man named Pine to have his fortune told.
Pine assured him that he was going on a
long voyage and that when the vessel reached
her destination she would be joined by an-
other craft. Before that, however, Thistle
would be lost. Some men in Flinders’s boat-
crew also went to Pine, who told them that
they would be shipwrecked, but not in the
vessel in which they were about to sail.
Thistle was drowned as predicted; and when
the Investigator, in which they sailed, reached
Sydney she was joined by the Lady Nelson
as tender. More than a year later Flinders
and his crew set out to return to England
in the Porpoise and were shipwrecked, as the

wards."

ways."
soothsayer had foretold. The conclusion of
the practical Flinders is: “I make no com-
ment on this story, but recommend a com-
mander, if possible, to prevent any of his
“rew from consulting fortune-tellers.”

Responsibility
Year after year the tendency has grown to look to the House of Gossard for
authoritative corset styles. Ours is the responsibility to KNOW: to know which
of the many styles influences that each season clamour for attention are worthy
of consideration’, to know those unchanging principles of good taste that must
always form the foundation of correct corsetry.
The responsibility of our leadership is emphasized at this time when the ever-vital
topic of fair price is uppermost in the minds of the public. The high principles
of merchandising upon which we established and have maintained our reputation
of responsibility is your best assurance that the Gossard Corsets you buy today
represent a fair value and that your every shilling has a full purchasing power.
THE CHARM OF BEING NATURAL
The French beauty and wit,
Madame De Sevigne, once wrote
her daughter, “Never depart from
the natural; it forms a complete
style.”
Here is epitomized the secret of
becomingness in dress. Be natu-
ral. Nature should be assisted,
not deformed with exaggerated
styles and false originality.
The Gossard Corsets for Autumn
and Winter are, as always, fash-
ioned to accent the natural beauty
of your figure. Harmony of line
is expressed in every corset and
whatever your needs there are
many models that will emphasize
your personal attractiveness.
Beauty always finds its perfect ex-
pression in movement; the most
flawless statue of faultless
tions is not comparable with the
beauty of wind-driven clouds, or
the rhythm of waters, or the grace
of the flying bird. The corset that
does not give you the comfort of
unrestrained movement can never
give you beauty.
It is no task to create a corset that
will repress the figure to a desired
silhouette at the expense of com-
fort and grace, but we hold it art
to produce these Gossards that will
fairly persuade every type of figure
to graceful lines and proportions
with a comfortable, healthful sup-
port that expresses itself in poise
and distinction of carriage.
During these months of increasing
costs, and in the face of unequalled
difficulties of present-day manufac-
ture, Gossard ■ quality has been
consistently maintained without
permitting these unprecedented
conditions to effect unduly the
cost of Gossard Corsets to you.
They are still nominally priced
within the reach of every woman
and you may buy every Gossard
with the assurance that it will be
worth every penny you pay for it
—worth, it in style, worth it in
comfort, and worth it in wearing
service.

BEERY BLOKE : “Well, shame thing, ain't it?”
“T.H.M.”: Allow me to butt in on . the
“Do snakes bite themselves?” controversy. The case
in point occurred at Grassy, the scheelite and bis-
muth mining hamlet at the southern end of King
Island, where they have, all to themselves, a much-
too-numerous colony of the deadly minute-snake.
One of these little bundles of venom, which measure
mostly about nine inches long and taper to almost a
needle-point at the tail, had been placed in a bottle,
where it wriggled in fury for a minute or two, then
buried its fangs in its own back and in a very short
time gave up the ghost. A little toddler had a
few minutes previously struck terror into the heart
of its mother by bringing the reptile into the house
firmly clenched in its two hands —the terror intensi-
fied by the fact that only a little while previously a
loca. horse had died from a bite from one of the
species.
“Don Mac”: “W-essel” inquires about the
kind of firearm the Papuans on the south coast tried
to scare Capt. Cook with in 1770. Cook is not
the only voyager to record a similar experience. The
captain of the Dutch brig-o’-war Dourga noticed
the custom in 1825-6. Wollaston, M.O. to the
British Ornithological Union’s Expedition to Papua
in 1910-11, says in his official report that when they
were coming down a river “crowds of people lined
the bank, and some of them, holding short bamboos
in their hands, jerked them in our direction, and
from the end came out a white cloud of powdered
lime, which looked like smoke.” Capt. C. G. Raw-
lings, of the same expedition, noticed the same thing
when he visited the village of Nime. I should say
that the probable explanation is that these particular
tribes use powdered lime to blind their opponents
in battle, or else it is an ingenious imitation of
firearms to scare off an intruder.
* * * *
“Ewa”: I have seen some bower bird play-
grounds in N.Q. that were wonderful in design and
color selection. One of the most striking I came
across near Herberton. From each bower there was
a loop of white stones —resembling a skipping rope
—with a smaller loop of mussel-shells, inside of
which again there was a loop of bits of white glass,
whilst the centre was a bed of different-colored glass,
with the bowl of an old clay-pipe in the middle.
Another that I saw along the Ingham-road had two
bowers, about 12ft. apart. In between was a square
of white shells, in the centre of which was a
heterogeneous collection of articles that queerly
enough formed the letters lOU—a very appropriate
design, judging by the things they had borrowed.
* * * *
“T.V.T.”: A sight for the gods, or for a
moving-picture producer, are the flights of gulls that
come from Westernport Bay to the south-western end
of Koo-wee-rup Swamp (Vic.). The birds swarm
along the ploughed furrows, and are so tame that
they perch on horses, implements and drivers. A
driver and his team thus bedecked would make a
satisfying film.
“Zanthus”: Nowadays a snowflake would
have about as much chance in Hades as in the back
country of Westralia, out towards the S. Aus. border.
But things were different once. In a recent geologi-
cal excursion out to the Warburton Ranges Gibb
Maitland came on a boulder bed about 15ft. thick
in the Wilkinson Ranges, in lfit. 26deg. 30min. S.,
and definitely diagnosed it as of glacial origin. From
a study of the ice-grooved boulders scattered over
a distance of about 200 miles Maitland came to the
conclusion that the deposits were formed of debris
dropped in shallow water by the icebergs calved by
the glaciers of those parts, which pushed down to
the level of a long-vanished sea. No doubt they did
this when the Nullarbor Plain was an ocean in which
the 1000 ft. or so of limestone that now overlies the
granite was laid down.
* * * *
“Sapoma”: One of the things which tend
to detract from the value of the New Guinea nig. as
a soldier, more especially that kind of nig.
which inhabits the former German territories,
is his liability to see things in the dark.
When this happens Black Brothel - , if armed,
generally fires one shot wildly in the direc-
tion of the tamarang or ghost, then (chucks
away his rifle and bolts for his life. As he
seldon if ever stops to think before firing,
entirely innocent persons are liable to get
hurt. A wireless operator at Eitape was sit-
ting at the instrument one night, a hitherto
reliable member of the Native Police doing
sentry-go outside. The darkness or the betel-
nut or something got on the latter’s nerves,
with the result that, as he subsequently
swore, he distinctly saw a tamarang of the
most ferocious species coming straight for
Jiim. The bullet which he fired at it from
his old-time smooth-bore Mauser rifle went
in one side of the' wireless house, neatly
removed the glazed peak from the navy cap
which the operator was wearing, and passed
out through the outer wall. At the subse-
quent investigation by the District Officer,
Kopai, the original beholder of the devil, pro-
duced five of his cobbers who had been in
the vicinity at the time to back him up
in his explanation, and their detailed descrip-
tion of the devil they had seen would have
satisfied a Sydney Quarter Sessions jury. It
didn’t satisfy the D. 0., though.

“Coringa”: “Bundibar” (B. 21/10/’2O)
asks whether “black pine” trees have a habit of
casting off their pollen in clouds. Only a few weeks
ago I saw the thing happen at a grove of Pin us
insignis trees. And I have often seen great bluish
clouds of pollen, for all the world like thin smoke or
mist, drifting across the Rhodes grass paddocks of
Queensland when they were in full seed. It gener-
ally occurs in the afternoon, on sunny days. In
these cases the pollen is extremely light, and a quan-
tity, ripening at once, is shaken out in, a cloud by a
strong puff of wind. The Commonwealth Meterologi-
cal Observer’s Guide mentions it under the heading
“Sulphur Rain” thus: “A deposit of the pollen of
pine-trees, often carried by the wind long distances
and brought down by rain.”

“Mac”: Please lift your hats to the Har-
rington-Coopernook (N.S.W. North Coast) mailman,
name of Evenden, who is over 80 years of age and
has run this service per horse and sulky for over
20 years without a break, travelling considerably
over 90,000 miles during the period. And he still
finds time to give Strawberry a feed and chop the
firewood.
“Hannibal”: Dr. J. M. Creed’s par. on
prickly-pear (B. 11/11/’2O) reminds me of how
another pest, the lantana, began its career in Aus-
tralia. It was first brought to Australia, and intro-
duced at Port Macquarie (N.S.W.), by the Indian
nurse of Major Innes. Major Innes became the
owner of much land from Port Macquarie right
through to the New England tablelands. The pest
was thought a rare plant in those days, and was intro-
duced to provide hedges.

“Mr. Mac”: I lived on familiar terms
with Mr. Dingo for four years in the Warrego district
in the early ’eighties, and am
satisfied that he is a sneak-
thief, but not a highwayman.
The only time I ever knew of
a dog facing a human was
when a very small boy on a
neighboring station was sent
a few hundred yards to a
drover’s camp to swap a roast
of beef for a leg of mutton.
He delivered the goods all
right, but was bailed up on
his way home by a single dog,
and arrived home with an
empty dish. No ; Mr. Dingo will
have your saddle-straps or
whip from your camp at
night-time, will even sneak
your tucker from under your
head, but as to facing a man
openly, well, I don’t think so,
unless he has changed since I
knew him. By the way, to
shoot dingoes I found this
plan worked out quite satis-
factorily. Twenty-four hours
after killing-time burn all
offal except two or three
fleshy bones to be used as
bait. These you place within
nice range of a hiding-place
(mine was a slab meat-house
in the killing yard), and place
a slush-lamp close by, with a
wind-shield which throws the light on the bait.
Don’t smoke, of course, in your hiding-place, and in
20 minutes or so you will have a dead dingo,
unless you are a bad shot. After an interval of
half an hour the dose may be repeated. There was
no scalp bonus in those days, but I never failed
to get two skins a night.

“Bulla Delah”: “Moonie” is quite wrong
in his reply to “Chiahuahua” (B. 21/10/’2O). The
dominant color in any cross of two colors will always
more or less completely swamp the subdominant or
recessive color in the impure offspring; but mating
black with white, then, according to Mendel’s law,
if the parents be pure-bred the offspring will be one
black (which will breed pure), one white (which
will breed pure) and two blacks (which in sub-
sequent breeding are capable of yielding whites
and blacks which breed true to color, as well as
blacks which do not breed true to color). The white
offspring, assuming white to be the subdominant
color, will always breed true, because if the dominant
color be included in their make-up they must come
black. Roans will only appear when the black and
white strains are equally dominant, so that from the
offspring of such a .mating those that will breed
true white and true black are themselves that color,
whilst the roans will get or cast the mixtures.

“S.S.”: One very successful Gippsland
axeman, who won many a chop, although admitting
himself inferior to some of the younger cutters
swinging against him, had a trick which was never
taken advantage of by the other experts he met. He
went to his block with a hot axe, and an attendant
stood handy with a bucket of boiling-water, into
HIS SHOU.
“One to town — (Me) — an' tdke one (for
yourself.”
which he plunged his axehead two or three times in
the course of eating his way through the log. The
fact is a hot axe never sticks; it leaves the gum-
miest timber so sweetly that the man swinging it can
afford the delay which a plunge into hot water
entails.

“6T6”: Jim Kennedy, horse-persuader
on Alexandria (N.T.), shot 35 whistling duck with
one shot, on Baalyabba waterhole, on the Buchanan
Creek. Record ?
“Doxite”: ‘‘Rooinek” (B. 4/11/’2Q) must
be a recent arrival from the land wherein his nom-
de-plume originated, as he seems to be woefully
ignorant of the conditions under which it is ngces-
sary to slaughter—not hunt —deer in South tTipps-
land. They are not killed by either “Cockney sports-
men” or gilded profiteers—each with a black boy to
hold the spare gun—but by exasperated struggling
farmers who must sink all sentiment in defence of
their crops. As for a man deserving gaol for destroy-
ing does and fawns, it is the men of “Rooinek’s”
kidney—the men who introduced the deer, the rabbit
and the fox curses into this country—who should be
THE DINING SUITE, TOO.
“What was all the row about in here lasi
night, Jacke?”
“Oh, te missus, boss —come ’ome drunk,

peering through a cell grating. If “Rooinek” is
looking for a rough-up let him try to foist his doc-
trine on a Gippsland cocky struggling to grow oats
in deer-infested country, and I’ll guarantee that he’ll
wish he was merely a prohibitionist cast into a den
of publicans.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: Long experience as a hunter
prompts me to doubt “Yarrum’s” tale (B. 21/10/’2O)
of a female tiger-cat’s single-handed mastery over
a monster dog-fox. Though this puss is a rare
animal, on the Mt. Ash Range (Monaro), the N.S.W.
South Coast Ranges and the Shoalhaven Valley 1
have accounted for several. The largest would not
have outweighed an ordinary household Tom. They
are strictly nocturnal, are always asleep by day,
and do their marauding by stealth. One might go
clean through a hen-roost in a single burglary, but
any little terrier is sufficient guard against its raids,
and it hasn’t courage enough to attack turkeys when
the gobbler chieftain is on sentry-go. Moreover,
“Yarrum’s” account of the cat’s clawing powers dis-
credits him. The tiger-cat, like its diminutive re-
lation the native-cat, has no claws. Its only tools
for clinging are its teeth, .and they are by no means
as formidable as those of a fox six months old.

“Brawlin’’l had carried my bluey for
three days when I came to a cocky’s place where
they were harvesting shorthanded. The cocky was
glad to get a man, and gave me a job. After the
first day I asked him if he could let me have an-
other egg for breakfast. Cocky went in to his old
woman and said, “If you’ve got another egg give it
to him and let him burst.” This narked me, so 1
went to the old cocky the next day and asked for
my time. He inquired if I knew how long I had
been working there. “Three days,” says I. “No,
you’re wrong,” says he; “you’ve done 2 days
17 hours.”
* * * *
“Ewa”: Lobbed at a selector’s humpy
near Proserpine (N.Q.) one night and had to turn
in with the two lads, owing to the scarcity of beds.
These two lads were twins, nine years old, and both
boys, so they informed me. That was the only
information they would impart. I was in the
middle. Something stirring under my back caused
the boys to chuckle, so I thought it was merely a
game of theirs. I must have dozed off, for the next
thing I knew was that both kids were sitting up in
bed, whistling. As soon as they knew I was awake
they dived under the blanket and laughed. I was
cogitating whether to give them a welt when I saw a
pair of eyes making along the rafters towards the
bed. A dig in the ribs brought forth the informa-
tion that “that’s Jinny, she sleeps at the foot of
the bed, and Jimmy sleeps in the mattress.” I
slept in the bush that night. Cocky told me next
day that they had been in the house ever since the
twins were born. “Yer can’t beat a couple of tiger-
snakes to keep down mice and rats,” he said. “And
visitors, too,” I thought.

THE OLD SHEBEEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve sung the same songs, grizzled brother,
Both dreadfully sore out o’ tune;
We’ve told the same hoary old chestnuts,
And wandered home under the moon;
We’ve laughed at the beads on the bumper
And sobered full sadly, I ween.
But the bond that was dearest and tied us the nearest
Was forged in the Old Shebeen.
No doubt it may scandalise good folk
To hear a confession so frank;
But truth is the truth, and without it
Our lives were a blur and a blank;
We’ve emptied our bottles together,
Lain down where ’twas not over-clean,
And when it w'as over —we vowed it was clover —
Those nights in the Old Shebeen!
It lay with its smoky brown rafters,
Just over the Barringdun Bend;
Its sign sent a notice to mortals-
The Bushman had always a Friend.
The cheques that we melted in common!
The Girl that we fancied a queen!
The stories we laughed at! The nectar we quaffed at!
The nights in the Old Shebeen !
And where is the stout Michael Casey,
The soul of the jest and the jeer,
Who’d sing a good song for the joy of the throng
And hand round the gossip and beer?
God bless his red hair and his whiskers,
His wife who would smile on the scene,
Then leave us to snore on her billowy floor —
Those nights in the Old Shebeen!
’Tis fine to be decent and sober,
Yet life has her lapses between,
And Prudence is sometimes flung headlong
And Folly leaps over the screen;
When Mem’ry turns over her treasure
And toys with its tinsel and sheen
She’ll find a full measure was served us of pleasure—
Those nights in the Old Shebeen!

Warns Women Against
Use of Soap on Hair.
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified but quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces last you and mother, sisters and
brothers for months. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonsful is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather. It
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
The hair dries quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
is.
Best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. And yet
it loosens and carries off every bit of excess
oiliness, dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
IMPORTANT. —Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
off with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.
Lift that Corn Off with the Finger-tips
Just a few drops of this New Ether Drug, and Corns or
Callouses Loosen So They Lift Right Off.
'iK 4 ?'
This is a wonderfully simple
and easy way to gain freedom
from your pestering corns and
callouses. Touch a few drops
of FrozolTce right on to the
heart of a sensitive, pain-
throbbing corn, or over a
tough, sore callous. It dries
at once. The ache
vanishes as if into
thin air. Tlnj corn or
callous next starts to
shrivel and wither un.
and soon it can be peeled
off with the finger-tips.
You’ll get enthusiastic about
right quickly. It never inflames nor even
irritates good, healthy flesh surrounding a
corn. You feel not a single twinge of
pain in using Frozol-Ice, nor afterwards.
Girls, and men too. who wear fashionable
footwear, will hail Frozol-Ice with delight.
Save a corner on your dressing-table for
Frozol-Ice, and never let corns torture you
again.
True Frozol-Ice is obtainable from all
live chemists. The genuine product can
always be identified by the name “Frozol-
Ice” on the green, printed carton contain-
ing bottle, with glass-rod dropper.

Why Physicians
Advise Magnesia
For Acid Indigestion.
Thousands of people whose stomachs
troubled them after eating have found that bv
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in a half-glass of hot water after meals they
can do away with pepsin pills and other
digestive aids, and can still be able to eat
heartily of whatever foods they please, and
have no stomach trouble afterwards. Physi-
cians say that hot water forces a much
needed blood supply to the stomach, while
Salix Magnesia is, undoubtedly the best, safest
and most powerful neutraliser of stomach
acids that can be found. A single teaspoonful
will sweeten the food contents of a. sour, acid,
burning stomach in five minutes by the watch,
and natural digestion will follow without pain
or uncomfortable feeling of any kind. Con-
tinued use of Salix Magnesia does not
weaken natural digestion, and it is perfectly
safe to use at any time. It can be had at
almost any chemist’s (in powder or com-
tablets form), but be sure it is Salix
Magnesia you are getting. Do not use other
forms of magnesia for this purpose.
“Mirza”: Can’t say whether a turtle lives
six hours after being killed, as “Paul C.” narrates
(B. 30/9/’2O), but I’ve seen a frog’s heart going
regularly 30 hours after its owner had succumbed.
Any unbeliever can easily test that for himself.
Destroy the frog's brain —thereby killing it, accord-
ing to British law —then slit up the abdominal
wall, push the lungs aside and watch the rhythmic
movements of the cardiac musculature. They will
continue for many hours. However, neither turtle nor
frog need put on side, for I have seen a boy’s heart
contracting and relaxing merrily in a jar of Locke’s
solution 24 hours after death. True, that was an
elaborate experiment, for glucose and oxygen had
to be continuously added and the solution kept at
blood heat.
* * * *
“Claroyamo”: “Caveman” tells (B.
4/11/’2O) of the difficulty he has experienced in
surf-fishing with the hand-line. Here’s a tip for
him and others similarly troubled. Take a fair-
sized piece of deal or other light board ; bore a hole
in each corner; then, with light rope or leather or
canvas straps, rig up a suspension tray a la the
theatre sweets-vendor. With one of these on which
to coil the line, the angler may stand almost in
the breakers and yet find tlirowing-out and hauling-in
as simple as getting wet.
* * * *
“Silas”: At the Emu Bridge camp one
could always rely on getting a bit of fresh meat at
Siddle’s tent. Siddle was a short block of a man,
a navvy, with a neat turn for handling a sheep.
Everybody on the camp knew that “Butcher” Siddle
did not raise sheep of his own; they were all quite
satisfied that he did not buy the mutton he sold;
but it is astonishing how little a navvies’ camp
bothers its head over such details. Siddle had the
mutton, and if you wanted it you could buy a joint
at a very reasonable price, which was exceedingly
convenient. What else mattered ? The camp at the
Emu was on Duncan’s land, and one evening one of
Duncan’s men, whose suspicions had been aroused,
and who was on the watch, confronted Siddle as he
came trudging through the trees with a fat lamb
across his shoulders, “Here, that sheep’s got Dun-
can’s brand. Where are you going with it?”
demanded the faithful steward. Siddle became con-
fidential. “To tell you the gorstrutli, I ain’t goin’
anywheres with the pore thing,” said he, “but it’s
got a touch of cramp, and I’m just givin’ it a bit of
a lift!” But there’s so little humanitarianism on
the bench that actually Siddle served seven months
for it.

“Kitty Kitty”: An old and respected
resident of the N.S.W. North Coast passed away lately
and was duly buried in the cemetery a few chains from
his homestead. The following day a mourner visited
the grave and placed a wreath thereon. Curious as
to who this person might be, I strolled across to the
grave to see if the wreath bore a card. It did: “To
dear Mr. -, with best wishes from Lizzie.”
* * * *
“Moanie”: A pair of wagtails set up
housekeeping in the blacksmith’s shop, commencing
their home, built on the flat top of a sawn-off
post, on Monday morning. By working at top-speed
from daylight to sundown, a matter of 13 hours
or so, the neat little nest of fine bark, woven with
cobweb and lined with horsehair, was completed on
the following Monday. In the afternoon Mrs. Wag.
snatched a moment to lay the first egg, and there
were two more by Wednesday. The hatching, which
did not seem so urgent, was done in a haphazard
manner, the eggs being left alone for an hour,
and sometimes more. However, 13 days after the
last egg was laid an almost-naked baby appeared,
followed quickly by two more. Fourteen days later
all three chicks had flown from the ne3t and landed
successfully on top of the swinging door. Now, a
week after the first flight, the chicks are distin-
guishable only by their plumage, which is less glossy
than that of the parents.
THE CONNOISSEUR.
“Do you mean to tell me that you'll stand
there and watch that dreadful fight?”
“ Oh , it's not so bad. Eve paid a dollar to
see much worse!”
ONE GOOD TURN.
“Well, Blanche, lam sorry you are going. If you leant a reference any time come to
me and I'll give you a good one."
“Thank you, Mrs. Grant. And if ever you want one send the girl along to me and
I'll say the best I can for you.”
“Russo”: “Mypharry,” a hard-up cocky,
wants to know how to cure his own tobacco. Well,
here goes. Pick the leaves from the plant and
thoroughly dry them in the sun. When they are
dry, prepare a bath of one quart of water in which
has been dissolved loz. saltpetre. Soak the dry
leaves in this bath for a few minutes. Dry the
leaves again in the sun; do it thoroughly. Take
out all large stems from the leaves. Now pile
up the leaves, beginning with two large ones.
Sprinkle alternate layers well with rum to* moisten
them. When you think you have enough to make
a good roll, press down with the hand and leave
for half an hour. Then start at one end of the
leaves, and roll tightly: That done, take a piece of
string or hayband and bind the roll from end to
end. Hang up for a month to dry. With luck and
good leaves a roll of real navy tobacco will be the
result.
* * * *
“Winnap”: They’re still rearing Diggers
to astonish the world with their initiative and re-
source. A Western Vic. hoy of TO was lately out
hunting with his kangaroo-dogs. One of them,
through coming in contact with a stump, had its chest
laid open, exposing the heart. The lad pinned the
opening up with two safety-pins; then, taking off
his vest, he wrapped it round the dog, secured the
bandage with his bootlaces, placed the dog on his
horse and brought it in 13 miles. Now, a few days
later, the dog is apparently doing well after having
been stitched up on arrival home.
“Paga”: “Malna’s” yarn (B. 16/9/’2O)
of the Fijians roasting turtles alive is not surprising.
In most parts of Papua the natives roast pigs alive.
The legs' of the victim are tied together, and the
body slung on a sapling over an open fire. The
screams of the poor beast are great fun for the
native onlookers. The performance, by the way, is
frequently supervised by the local native missionary
or teacher, who is not able to see anything objec-
tionable in it. In fact, the more “Christian” he is
-—the more he thinks about his “soul” —-the wider
the gulf he sees between pig and long pig.
“T.V.T.”: Recently while in the ranges
near Beaconsfield (Vic.) I was attracted to a honey-
suckle bush by hearing a buzzing noise. I found
that a number of blowflies were interned in a filmy
web or bag, with a cone-shaped opening at the side,
through which the internees had evidently entered.
This entrance was shaped like an eel-trap—large at
one end, and narrowing down to a very small open-
ing into the bag. The most peculiar thi-ng about
it was the coloring inside the cone-shaped aperture ;
it was like the big soap-bubbles that the kiddies
blow, and with the sun shining -on it, it appeared
to be spinning round and round. I looked for the
Hun that had woven this marvellous fly-trap, but
could find no trace of him. Whose patent is it? And
what lures the flies in?
“Te Whare” : It is not unusual to observe
gannets—in pairs, as a rule —mixed up in the mighty
mutton-bird migration which takes place annually.
But the gannets probably get out at some half-way
house, and don’t follow the petrels to Bass Straits,
etc., to breed. I’ve also spotted a lone black swan
flying south with two gannets in close attendance,
the big piebald birds laboriously following every
deviation of their leader. Strange how defenceless
birds, such as house swallows, white-browed wood-
swallows and gill-birds, assemble in great flocks
prior to migration. I’ve counted over a hundred
swallows lined, up on a bank in Mona'ro (N.S.W.)
at the end of autumn, while the gillies leave for
the warmer coastal districts in great straggling’
flocks, and the wood-swallows crowd on a tree!
prior to their departure for fresh beetle and grub
fields.
* * * *
“McShingle”: In the ’eighties we found
the dead body of a swaggie on Canning Downs sta-
tion (Q.). This is how it happened. A traveller
having no further use for a bottle of strychnine
threw it into his fire, thinking that would be the
safest place to put it. Swaggie No. 2, coming along
the track a few days later, noticed the ashes, and
made his damper in them. And that’s why he
stays out where the dead men lie.
* * * *
“Wal”: The mourning customs of Brown
Brother in Papua are many and various. Papua is a
large country, and what is common practice in one
tribe may be unheard of even three or four miles dis-
tant. The Motu tribe, around Moresby, paint them-
selves black (they are a brown-skinned people) when
a near relation goes to the “Home of Spirits.” In
other parts of Papua the mourners paint themselves
white when a brother or other member of the family
passes over. The corpse is wrapped in mats, tapa-
cloth or bark, and usually buried. Some tribes put
the cadaver on a raised platform for the sun and
wind to deal with; others remove the head and, by
different processes of boiling and smoking, add it
to the family collection, the body being buried in
a shallow grave or exposed to the weather in a
tree or on a platform. This is common in the Delta,
but the head is never confused with those obtained
from enemy tribes, which are kept in the special
places set aside for them in the men’s club-house
(or ravi, to use the vernacular). The Koriki tribe
are strenuous mourners, for they indulge in the
luxury of individual blood-letting whenever a popu-
lar member of the community pegs out. Deep gashes
(self-inflicted) on their shoulders, cut faces and
breasts all advertise to the world the sorrow
they feel for the departed. These people also mourn
for their dogs, and a mob of the writer’s bled with
much enthusiasm when his boar-hound met a Water-
loo in an argument with a black snake. The Delta
natives indulge in arrow-play to work off their
superfluous grief. The bow-men shoot hundreds of
arrows into the gables of the ravi, or into their
women’s houses; and occasionally an extra corpse
occurs from this habit. Almost a general custom
along the coast is the prohibition of dancing and
drumming for a considerable period after the death.
Then the death-feast is held, the pigs (if any) of
the deceased are eaten, his cocoanut-palms are cut
down (this is now prevented by law), his canoe is
sent adrift with food and water for him if he wants
it, and his house is pulled to pieces. The weapons,
drums, cooking pots (coastal Papuans make pottery
and boil most of their food), fish-nets (only worn-
out ones), fish-spear, paddle, cocoanut water-flasks
and a canoe-bailer are hung over the grave, which
is roofed over with nipa- or sago-palm thatch. In
the olden days the women had to watch the corpse
for a day or two while it awaited burial, but this
custom is rarely seen now. On Sudest Island, in pre-
Government days, the wife or wives of the departed
warrior had to lie with the corpse until it was
buried in the grave under the house. As both
corpse and wives were carefully covered over with
mats, and burials often were delayed several days,
in the tropic heat of Papua the position of the
unfortunate women was far from pleasant. But
an inexorable punishment kept the women at their
dreadful duty, for if they showed themselves beyond
the mats that covered them, the angry menfolk of
the deceased immediately clubbed them to death for
“infidelity.” In the Mekeo district, until a few
years ago, the wife of the deceased had to suffer
imprisonment for two or three months after his
burial, and in the smoke-filled gloom of their houses
eye trouble and often blindness was the reward for
their obedience.

“Alex.”: Anybody got an older chicken
than that one of ours which has scratched for a liv-
ing for 24 years? Beyond slight stiffness of her joints,
due to rheumatism, she carries her years well. Un-
fortunately, she pays no board ; though, since she has
lasted out 12 husbands and had over 300 encum-
brances, I suppose we shouldn’t complain.
* * * *
“O’Miller”: About stakes repeating the
historic Aaron’s-rod stunt, I know a spot in the
Mt. Lofty Ranges, near Adelaide, where flourish two
magnificent white-gums. Originally they were the
forks of a home-made windlass dsed in connection
with a prospecting venture. The shaft, with the
usual mullock heap, is still there.
“Werrimee”: Any handy man can make
this bush butter-cooler. In appearance it is an
ordinary pine stool, sft. long and lOin. wide, used
as a verandah seat; but the top is a lid with hinges,
and the bottom is canvas tacked to rounded pieces
screwed on to the inside of the legs. For ventilation
a couple of 4in. holes are bored through the upper
end of each leg. The trough is half-filled with water,
and butter, bottles and so forth placed therein;
and it is a cool chamber on the hottest back o’
Bourke day.
* * * #
“McShingle”: It happened at a surveyors’
camp. One of the party chopped his shin with a
tomahawk and started I to bleed to death. Yards
of spiders’ web and large quantities of mud plastered
on blackfellow fashion failed to stop the flow, and
it looked as if "the poor follow was a goner. In
desperation one of the party heated a piece of iron
and, while the injured man took a pull on himself,
applied it almost red-hot to the wound. This singed
the cut together and stopped the blood. For my
part I would rather have bled to death than have
suffered the awful agony of the hot iron. But

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
I have pleasure in announcing that my principals, Messrs. ALFRED HERBERT, LTD., of COVENTRY,
ENGLAND, having decided to establish an Australasian Company, the business hitherto carried on by myself as their
sole agent, will now be known as:—
Alfred Herbert (Australasia) Ltd.,
Machine Tool Makers, Representatives and Importers,
57 George Street North. Circular Quay, Sydney.
It is their desire to place the whole of their world-renowned organisation at the disposal of the Australasian
Manufacturers, in order to cater for the growing needs of an expanding and developing population.
Manufacturing on a much greater scale can and will be done successfully and creditably in Australia. Mineral
resources are in rich abundance; the mechanic is possessed of energy and intelligence of the highest degree, but probably
one of the greatest difficulties confronting the average manufacturer of to-day is economical production.—To get this he
must have the necessary advice in the selection of plant, equipping of same, and instructions in efficient handling after
installation. It is in this connection we wish to help, and we offer the following gratuitous advice.
Rearrangement of present plant.
Balancing of plant to bring each section into line.
Complete plants, giving guaranteed output on all details of the
work under consideration.
Fixing of limits for interchangeability, which depends entirely on
the class of work on hand.
We have a demonstrating department, where the prospective buyer can see the machines working, and this not
only shows the capabilities of the machine, but keeps you in touch with the very latest practices.
We have an experienced staff at the service of our customers to deal with inquiries and give practical advice
in the selection of Small Tools, Grinding Wheels and every kind of works requisite.
WE ARE OUT TO HELP AUSTRALIA MANUFACTURE, and we offer a cordial invitation to all those
interested to come and inspect our showrooms.
Faithfully yours,
For ALFRED HERBERT (AUSTRALASIA), LTD.,
CHAS E. YOUNG, Managing Director.
times without number; even in the “pro-
vinces” of Russia it has been staged by
59 different companies.
To those who ask only charm, here
it is in full measure. To those who
look deeper he reveals a tender and
lovely allegory, a modern philosophy.
After the search into strange worlds, over
the paths rough and hard for little feet,
Mytyl and Tyltyl come back einpty-handecl.
There in their own familiar cottage is the
Blue Bird. “We went so far and the bird
was here at home all the time.” It is
Maeterlinck’s way of hinting a secret to
those who have already partly guessed it —
that happiness lies only in giving happiness;
that within each heart nestles the fugitive
radiance. And to those who look for mysti-
cism there is the scene where Mytyl and
Tyltyl look for the Blue Bird in the ceme-
tery. Tyltyl turns the diamond in his
hat and from all the gaping tombs there
rises the “efflorescence at first frail and
timid, like steam, then white and virginal,”
and the graveyard is transformed into a sort
of fairy garden, and the flowers open and
the birds sing. And Mytyl asks: “Where
are the dead?” “There are no dead,” Tyltyl
replies.
This, then, is Maeterlinck’s philosophy:
Courage and happiness here upon earth if
we only open our eyes wide enough, if we
only make our hearts receptive enough ; and
hope, and happiness in the world that is to
come, the world where “there are no dead.”

TOM SKEYHILL.
The Black and White of Victor Hugo
After the coup d’etat in 1851 Victor Hugo
was exiled from Paris and France. Living
in the Channel Islands, he wrote “Les Miser-
ables,” “Les Travailleurs de la Mer,”
“L’Homme qui rit,” and some lesser works.
Exile must have been a bitter thing to Hugo.
Paris, 'old and new, squalid and beautiful,
cruel and kindly, was much more to him than
to the mere Parisian. Thackeray, Paul de
Koch, Daudet, Dickens, Murger—to all these
Paris was a great deal. She was the beloved
mistress of Dumas, Eugbne Sue, De Mau-
passant ; the holiday companion of Du
Maurier, Stevenson, Laurence Sterne and a
hundred others. But she was the wife and
household of Balzac and Victor Hugo. To
them she the pains and penalties of the
rooftree’s responsibility; to them she was
duty, sweet and bitter and permanent, a life-
long battlefield of joy.
So when the Great War came the house of
Victor Hugo in the Place des Vosges was
closed while the staff of the museum went
about its business at the Front. When the
war ceased, it was re-opened and the relics of
the poet were again to be seen by the people.
Among the exhibits are Hugo’s drawings.
The history of the main part of these singular
black-and-white efforts is interesting. Hugo’s
home in exile was in Guernsey, opposite St.
Malo. He spent the summers of 1862-65 on
the banks of the Rhine, and the curious,
heavy, Dor6-like drawings are the result.
From the technical point of view these pic-
tures of the Rhine have not much value, it
is true, but from the point of view of work
done by the great exile haunting the frontiers
of home they are of value. In the heavy
effects of mass and body used in preference
to the etcher’s betraying line one can trace
(if one is sufficiently interested in artificial
points) the sensual inequalities of Hugo’s
books. In the great “Les Miserables,” for
instance, the -savage contrasts of drama and
flat relation, the perpetual enthusiasm for
wholly unworthy, falsely expressed matters,
the occasional large simplicity and the
occasional complicated virtuosity all have
no effect whatever on the power of the splen-
did story itself. That works out with its
steady inevitability to the end; it is easy
to imagine the over-educated critic following
Valjean to his last word with the eager-
ness of a boy deep in his first book. That
is the power of genius; in the mass it must
make its appeal, if in the lesser details and
style-refinements it is, perhaps seriously, at
fault.
In details and style-refinements there is
something sadly lacking in Hugo’s draw-
ings. But in other matters, matters not so
strict and exact, they have astonishing quali-
ties. Emile Bertaux, an eminent art-critic,
calls Hugo “the Turner of the Night.” That
may sound like the telling phrase the find-
ing of which seems to be in every critic’s
conception of his duty. As most phrases
it is an exaggeration, of course; but there
is some excuse for it. Into the negative color
called black Hugo gets a vibrant, varying
life which many practised artists strive for
in vain. It runs from the faint spectral grey
of moonlight to the sharp iridescence of
split coal, on to a dense velvet black which
one could almost stroke. His whites, too, are
graded from the bloom on a pearl to a
deep ivory-effect which can only be got by
the use of coffee-grounds. His subjects are
most often night-pieces: a mouldering castle
seen by the lightning-flashes, midnight river-
stretches of livid mist and water, moonlight
of a pallor that would seem cold to the
touch. Sometimes he drew white houses, old
and _ time-worn, blinking in a fierce white
sunlight, sometimes grey shadows under
black trees, sometimes white water with a
black shadow thrown on it. In each draw-
ing there is an effect of life, very often of
horror and fear, which is very rare in black
and white. Perhaps the “Turner of the
Night” is not. so great an exaggeration; cer-
tainly there is the same width of vision, the
same sense of mass values and something of
the same certainty of mass-effect.
Naturally, as a black-and-white artist
Hugo means very little compared with Hugo
the author of “Ruy Bias” and “Notre
Dame,” but there is more in these drawings
in Paris than there is, say, in Thackeray’s
illustrations. And in each quite skilful
combination of black and white there is
something of the large fervor of “Ruy Bias”
and “Notre Dame.”

A Satchel of Books
Old Seed on New Ground, by James
Adderley (Putnam’s Sons). Low supplies
a dozen “cartoons,” and found the material
pretty poor. The author, a London slum
parson, sets out to reincarnate the Good
Samaritan, the Prodigal Son, Dives, Lazarus
and other Biblical characters, and put them
in Bond-street and Bethnal Green. There
may be a call to modernise the parables;
but this page doesn’t think much of Mr.
Adderley’s earnest effort. Often, in fact,
the story quite loses point. Low’s “car-
toons” are merely illustrative. Perhaps he
found it impossible to make them anything
else.
Black Bartlemy's Treasure, by Jeffery
Farnol (Sampson, Low, Marston). A
rattling good adventure story with plenty of
color, sudden death and heroic daring. The
only faults are that some of its people are
a shade too clever, the firearms go off a little
too effectively for the historical getting, and
the language flops into modern phraseology
a little at some points. But the book is
astonishingly good of its kind.
Queen’s Knight, by Chester Keith (Allan
and Unwin). The story of King Arthur
and Launcelot written as a modern novel.
It fails to grip.
The Agamemnon of Aeschylus, translated
by-Gilbert Murray (Allen and Unwin). Greek
classics in English verse from the pen of
Gilbert Murray have sold like novels; and
everywhere his renderings of the ancient
tragedies have met with loud applause. But
“The Agamemnon” is disappointing. Either
this is not a great drama, or the translation
is inadequate; for the movement of the play
is by no means clear from the text. Most
of the verse itself is poor, though here and
there striking lines and phrases occur.
Prohibition and Prussianism is a mono-
graph on the drink question by Dr. E. M.
Fitzpatrick, L.R.C.P. (Edin.), who practises
in Chicago (U.S.). It is a loud, robust
curse from the standpoint of the moderate
imbiber, yet its keynote is optimism—-a hope
approaching certainty that the dark dry
cloud will soon pass away.
The Luck of the Gold Moidore, by Donald
Maclean (Allenson). The Mahogany Ship,
by V. Williams (Ward Lock). Down on
the Heytesbury coast of Victoria, there is a
tradition in which an old treasure-ship built
of mahogany is the chief figure; and around
it Donald Maclean wrote a romance which
was published serially in England in 1915
under the title of “The Mahogany Ship.”
Then Donald went to the war, and the pub-
lication in book-form was suspended till the
guns cooled. But while the last proofs were
being read Ward Lock’s published another
book, under the title of “The Mahogany
Ship,” by V. Williams; so the other man
had to choose another name. There can be
no question of plagiarism; for though the
same tradition set the springs going in both
men, the yarns are as unlike as yesterday’s
produce-market report and the Book of
Revelation. They are alike only in that
neither is very well told. Williams’s is the
more romantic; Maclean’s the more credible,
but he gets out of many difficulties by the
qheap device of reporting that at this point
there are leaves missing from the ancient
record which he is either quoting from or
condensing. Readable enough; but there are
the marks of the clumfjy fist on both of them.
The Harvest of Ruskin , by John W.
Graham (George Allen and Unwin, London).
English literature, like English society, has
its middle classes, and Scotland supplies a
lot of the respectable material for them.
Ruskin is distinctly a Scottish product. A
man born in England of Scottish parents
and heir to £140,000 which had been made
in the wine trade, whose mother had drilled
him backwards and forwards in the Bible,
begins to lay down the law on every sub-
ject under the sun, and gradually gets to
know something about the things he has
dogmatised on without losing the habit of
dogmatising on other things he does not
know. That, with the chalfy praise win-
nowed out, is about the story of Ruskin as
told in this book. He was always some-
where near the truth, and generally in get-
ting near it condemned the truth itself with
violence. But he wrote well, sometimes
exquisitely; and the world soon tired of him.
If there is any “harvest,” the grain is still
unripe; even this very sympathetic bio-
grapher seems to admit that.
The Inky Way
S. Talbot Smith on the “Oxford a”: —
No complaints to make of the criticism of “Pollio”
(R.P. 28/10/’2O), except, perhaps, to suggest that “I
am sick to death of gup about” so-and-so is a rather
ungracious way for a pseudonymous writer to
approach a signed article on a purely literary topic.
-Very likely the broad a did not come from Oxford
at all; indeed, I said as much, and used quotation
marks to indicate that this was merely a popular
name used for convenience. But where “Pollio”
seems to go astray is in dragging “the Oxford
accent” into the question. That is a recognised
and recognisable thing. It does come from Oxford;
whereas the mere broad a can be used —as by the
“darnce” patrons whom The Bulletin often deals
with —without any education behind it at all. And
beyond the Oxford accent is “the Oxford manner,” a
kind of arrogance based on intellect, the very
opposite of the spirit which “suffers fools gladly.”
The phrase has a recognised meaning, but it may
easily be a libel on that seat of learning; for the
two finest instances of the “manner” I have known
were provided by (1) a Cambridge man, and (2)
another who had never left Australia.
Asquith is reported to have remarked
when he heard that his wife was to receive
£13,000 for her book, “Good Lord! I hope
it isn’t worth it!” A man who can say
that shouldn’t be representing a Scottish
constituency.

Users of Goodyear Belts testily to
Two Things—Service and Savings
TWO things are demanded of a belt—that it shall deliver all its power (that
there shall not be slippage or stretch, which means lost energy), and that
it shall wear.
Goodyear Belts (often enough replacing other brands which have failed to stand the
strain) are to-day in all classes of plant—under the worst industrial conditions—
delivering astonishing service and paying for themselves by prolonged life and by
economy in conserving power.
The point where conservation matters most is on the main drive. Power lost here is
lost to the whole of the workings. It is in such service that a Goodyear Belt proves
itself as a tremendous economy factor. Such a belt is subjected to hard service,
delivering, as it does, power for the entire plant; with varying demands and often
under the worst conditions. Testimonials of users are enthusiastic on both points of
service and economy.
The problem of manufacturing a high-
grade belt such as a Goodyear is one of
providing an inseparable yet elastic bond
between the plies which will permit of
the constant flexing and distortion inci-
dental to running over pulleys without
the plies separating.
To appreciate and to fully understand this
problem, take a pack of cards with the ends
perfectly square. Bend them in a circle
and note their relative positions. The
end of the pack is no longer square. Each
card has been slightly pulled away from
the one next to it.
This illustrates just what happens when
a belt is inferior. It is resistance to such
happenings that makes the Goodyear
Belt what it is.
You have the right at any time to call for the advice of the Goodyear Technical Man,
who will demonstrate how to adapt your belts to the actual conditions of work.
His specialised knowledge and continuous experience of results will assist you to secure
not only the maximum service. in belts and consequent economies of factory operation,
but will insure the effective transmission of power with its accompaniment of maximum
output of machines or plant.
Our Specification of Goodyear Belting carries with it the acceptance of responsibility
for its satisfactory service and wear.

“Lac”: There is really no excuse for
watering milk in Melbourne nowadays. The
good season and the flush of feed have
caused such a flow of milk that there is an
over-supply. The other day Werribee
farmers offered 2000 gallons a day for the
city market and could not find a buyer at
Is. a gallon. Yet retail prices haven’t
tumbled so that you would notice it. In my

“R.ILS.”: The remarks of “F.W.S.” (B.

Laudanum, which our yellow friends are
said to be vaporising, does not contain the
mere 1 per cent, of opium he alleges, but
1 per cent, of the alkaloid morphine.
Laudanum is prepared from powdered opium,
and “Grego” (B. 14/10/’2O) is approxi-
mately cox-rect when he says that lib. of it
will yield 2oz. opium for smoking purposes.
With laudanum at 16s. a lb. soz. of smoking
opium will cost about £2, and if Asia charges
£25 for soz. he should do well out of the
offence.

day !” howled Burrytop. “What, again!
This is the third time in three months that
I’ve driven in for my stores and found the
’ole bloomin’ town with its shutters up!”
“The pubs are open,” suggested the post-
ornament hopefully. “Hell to the pubs!
Twenty miles of a drive for nothin’, and
my hay ready to cart in. Why the hell
doesn’t the flamin’ Gov’ment post us a hal-
manack with the days on it marked when

“F.C.” : If you must go on the land it’s as
well to keep a weather-prophet on the pre-
mises. A week or two ago a fruit-grower
just outside Melbourne was assured on a
Sabbath morn by his wife, who gi-ows corns,
that there would pi-esently be lots of rain.
He smothered his conscience and spent the
Blessed Day picking his ripe cheiTies. That
night and all day Monday a steady soaking
rain fell. His neighbors couldn’t pick till
late in the afternoon, and when they could
start they found their ripe cheri’ies split, and
unsaleable. The prices his fruit realised
showed that the market has no respect for
the Sabbath. But what a gamble “the land”
is! The mild days just before that rain
brought peas in with a rush and they dropped
to 4s. per 1001 b.—absolutely unpayable. Con-
sequently most growers declined to get them-
selves wet on Monday at such profitless toil.
Only.a few tackled it—and reaped their re-
ward, peas reaching 545. per 1001 b. in Tues-
day’s market. One man took 10 bags in on
o anc h being offered no more than
3s. 6d a bag, carted them home and put them
in cool store. He took them in again on
Monday night and quickly sold out at 50s.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Within the guarded harbor,
Lapped by the lazy tides,
Between the dawn and sunset
A fleet of phantoms rides —
The ships that sail no longer
The tempest-riven seas,
But on their rusting anchors strain,
And, rocking in the mist and rain,
Chant softly to the breeze:
“Oh, we have sailed the green seas
From Sydney to Rangoon,
And round the coast to China
In fog and dread typhoon,
Where the great, lonely icebergs
Come sailing by the Horn,
Until the white Kaikouras
Rise gleaming- in the morn.”
They watch the new ships sailing
Upon clear nights of stars,
When with her lamp of silver
The high moon lights their spars,
Bound for enchanted islands,
With every wave a lure, •
And as the mists of twilight fall
Again the old sea-voices call
Unto a guerdon sure.
“The ebbing tides entreat us:
‘Come, come with us once more,
From Auckland to Vancouver,
From Hythe to Singapore;
Come forth in sleet and tempest
In wind and roaring rain.;
Ah, leave the sheltered harbor
And sail free ships again’!”
Black in the lonely darkness
They rock their dreary hulls,
No sound about their bleak decks,
But cries of restless gulls;
Each circling bird of ocean
Has swept their wakes across—
The terns on slender, glancing wings,
Godwits in strange, far wanderings,
The mighty albatross.
“Oh, we have seen the Three Kings
Loom greyly through the haze,
And we have passed Savaii,
With evil fires ablaze;
The cone of Fujiyama
Has pierced the purple mist,
The Thousand Isles have slumbered
By golden sunlight kist.”
Free winds that straight and swiftly
Across the oceans blow,
Pause softly as you pass them,
The ships of long ago;
And in a gentle spirit
For a brief moment stay,
And tell as to an eager friend
Who lingers at the journey’s end
The happenings of the day.

ANYTHING TO OBLIGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. Deputy-Judge Hogan delivered judgment on Monday
in the appeal case of Geraghty against Presley. Mr.
Hogan, sitting as a special magistrate, had dismissed
an information laid by the Customs for an alleged
breach of section 59 of the Beer Excise Act, and the
Customs appeal to Mr. Hogan as Supreme Court Judge
against the, decision given by Mr. Hogan as a police
magistrate. Sitting in the Supreme Court, Deputy-
Judge Hogan held that he, as magistrate Hogan,
in the lower court, had wrongly decided, and he
upheld the appeal. He imposed a penalty of £2O
on Presley, and ordered him to pay £lO costs of the
appeal. —Darwin message.
“Old Alf on points!” The referee (Mick Hogan was
his name)
Spoke thus and heaped imaginary bays
On him whose rotten fight had moved to cries of
rage and shame,
The few who’d backed him on his past displays.
“A blanky ramp!” “Dam’ robbery!” “Get to him!”
yelled the crowd.
“Forgive me!” murmured Hogan: “my mistake.
The other feller gets the verdict.” Acclamations
loud
Drowned Alf’s distracted moan of “It’s a fake!”
“Yer out!” cried Umpire Hogan, and then amplified
it, “stumped!”
“I never left the crease!” his victim cried.
Loud curses floated from the stands and bricks and
boulders bumped
Across the sward in an increasing tide.
Mick hastily corrected his decision to “No ball.”
(< “Stay where you are, my lad,” he kindly said.
In point of fact —I see it now—you were not
stumped at all.
Forget it! Put it right out of your head!”
“Blind Staggers wins,” Judge Hogan said; “he lifts
the stake and cup.”
A roar of disapproval from the mob
Burst forth as the outsider’s number on the board
went up.
<( But Hogan was a judge who knew his job.
“A lapsus lingua,’’ he remarked; “the winner is
The Spud.
The place Blind Staggers really filled was last.
The fav’rite’s won. I knew he would. The other’s
name is Mud.”
And punters cheered while bookies stood aghast.

The last survivor of the family of the
late William Charles Wentworth, the Father
of the N.S.W. Constitution, is D’Arcy Bland
Wentworth, born at Vaucluse, January 10,
1848. He is the youngest of the family, and
was at one time a lieutenant in -the. Bth
Hussars. He lives in England.
“Gum-Nut”: The U.S.A. carefully avoids
importing foreign hardwoods that might com-
pete with its own lumber, but does not
mind naturalising them if the thing can be
done. Several varieties of eucalypts are
doing well in parts of the U.S.A., particularly
California. Now the Yanks have sent a
Forestry Professor from Harvard to have a
look round our forests and see what he can
see. This Professor Wilson is just now ex-
ploring the karri and jarrah forests over
West, and intends to get among the big
timbers of the other States in due time. Per-
haps some day the Commonwealth will im-
port its own hardwoods from America just
as the reckless country imports its own
wattle bark from Natal.
Mighty issues are fought out before the
shipbuilding board which Hughes took as
the model for his industrial tribunals.
Lately a toiler claimed compensation for
damage done to a pair of spectacles by a
bit of flying steel while he was using an
emery-wheel or something. The Department
resisted the claim on the ground that pro-
tectors were supplied and that it was the
man’s own fault if he didn’t use them. The
tribunal sat on the case and eventually
awarded the compensation. Lately its mem-
bers were called post-haste to Sydney for
something even more important—to - decide
whether the Cockatoo boilermakers should
lose their annual 12 djiys’ leave for refusing
to work on two Saturday mornings. The
tribunal naturally decided that the penalty
should not be enforced, and all was peace
again.
“Die Mihi” among the unearned incre-
ments
Interest is revived in the now misty story of the
Collins-Swanston-streets corner of Melbourne because
the Ilowey Estate is building an arcade alongside
Cole’s, in Collins-street. In 1837 Henry Howey had
a tiny homestead near Sydney on which he grew
turnips. By chance he saw a Government Gazette
giving details of a land sale in the newly-planned
town of Melbourne, Port Phillip, and instructed an
agent to buy up to £lOO worth. For £94 he
secured three lots, Nos. 19, 18 and 17. No. 19,
now Stewart Dawson’s corner, had a frontage to
Collins-street of 132 ft. and went along Swanston-
street half-way to Little Collins-street. Blocks 18
and 17 went down Collins-street to Cole’s Book
Arcade and right through by a depth of 315 ft. to
Little Collins-street, the latter described on the
original plan as “Back Lane.” Henry Howey and
his family were drowned at sea two or three years
later, and his elder brother, John Werge Howey,
became heir to the Sydney turnip farm and the
vacant Melbourne allotments. Then gold was dis-
covered and Melbourne began to grow. J. W.
Howey wisely let his acre and a half on building
leases for 21 years. As these leases fell in he
doubled, trebled and quadrupled the rents. When
he had more money than he knew what to do with he
went to England and bought an old estate, on which
he died in 1871. His son John worked as a major
in the British army, and bought a castle from an
impoverished nobleman. A valuation made in the
height of the land boom in 1889 gave the value of
the Melbourne property as £889,500. It is said
to yield £50,000 a year net to-day, which perhaps
is not a wonderful accretion for £94 worth of Mel-
bourne city soil in 83 years. Altson’s corner of
Collins and Elizabeth streets up to the Block Arcade
fetched £32 at the same sale. “The Block” Arcade
brought £lB, and so did Allan’s music shop. “Money”
Miller’s block, covered by Mullen’s Library and the
Australia Cafe, went dirt cheap at £l9. (But Henry
Miller in 1837 was still a clerk in the Hobart Town
branch of the Union Bank, where he started his for-
tune, it is said, by lending money to his fellow-
clerks at something over 10 p.c. p.a.) The Equitable
Building block sold for £46—and in 1890 changed
hands at £278,000. The E. S, and A. Bank corner of
Queen-street was bought by H. Cooper for £4O, and
the Stock Exchange block by M. Carr for £34. The
Bank of N. S. Wales block, through to Little Collins-
street, was dear at £35; while the Collins House
site at that land sale was worth only £29. The
London Stores allotment, opposite the old G.P.0.,
was knocked down to J. Roach for £2B, and the
Leviathan Stores corner of Swanston-sfreet looked
cheap at £3O.

How soon will it need repair?”
The builder turns over to you a house
well made in every part. You pay the
bill —under present conditions probably
much more than you estimated. Immedi-
ately you ask yourself “How long before
I will be called upon for further outlay?”
Consider this question seriously—what
have you done to prevent decay? What
paint have you used? How long will it
really PROTECT the woodwork? The
quality of the paint is all-important. It
is not merely advisable, it is essential,
to use the best paint at the outset, and so
save subsequent expense for repainting
earlier than would otherwise be necessary.
Ask your painter to use

Mrs. A. M. Matier
Tells How Cuticura
Healed Eruption
“I had a very painful eruption on the
scalp at the back of the head. It oc-
casioned incessant itching
and a very painful burning
sensation the whole time.
The skin was red and in-
flamed and my hair became
dry and lifeless and fell out
gradually for some time.
“I sent for a sample of Cuticura Soap
and Ointment which afforded relief. I
bought more and in about four weeks
the eruption was entirely healed.”
(Signed) Mrs. A. M. Matier, Rangitkei
St., Palmerston North, N. Z.

dency to pimples, redness or rough-
ness should not be irritated by impure,

MELBOURNE - SYDNEY - BRISBANE
The great majority of Farmers, Orchardists, and
others to-day are allowing Thistles, Sorrel, Couch
Grass, and a hundred other pests to shade, choke,
and crowd out useful plants and grasses, allowing
them to absorb the soil moisture, rob the plant
food in the ground, increase the cost of every opera-
tion in the preparing of the land, in the seeding,
cultivating, harvesting, and marketing of their
crops. In short, they’re Weed Farming.
Blackberries, Boxthorn, St. John’s Wort, and Rag-
wort are in undisputed possession of thousands
of acres of valuable country, mostly because their
eradication is considered impossible or
too laborious.
But, is their extermination impossible?
Not a bit of it, Mr. Landholder! Granted
you have used every conceivable means in
vain—have you ever used
"VALLO” Weed, Scrub
and Tree Killer ?
Have you heard that in all parts of
Australia “Vallo” has effectively killed
every kind of Noxious Growth to which
it has been applied—Blackberries, Box-
thorn, St. John’s Wort all included ?
“Vallo” is the easiest, handiest, and most
economical Weed, Scrub, and Tree Killer
procurable. It’s in powder form, very
soluble, and is used as a spray.
Prices: 56 lbs. 70/-, 15 lbs. 21/3,
7 lbs. 10/6, 1 lb. 21-, i lb. 1/3.
Postage: Within the State, 1 lb. 9d., J lb. 6d. extra.
Interstate, 1 lb. 1/2, i lb. Bd. extra.
1L J. Banfield is not the only paper-
blackener to fancy an island where he can
be the whole works. Compton Mackenzie,
who wrote “Sinister Street,” has taken a
60 years’ lease of Herm, a little island in
the English Channel, and a 20 years’ lease
of another speck in the same neighborhood.
Herm runs him into £9OO a year, so there
must be something in books, after all.
Two sisters and a brother of Iladdon
Chambers, the playwright, live in Sydney;
another brother, Harry, is a journalist in
America. Chambers’s mother was a member
of the Kellett family. Her brother was Wil-
liam Kellett, of M udg.ee; and Mrs. Kings-
brough (mother of Mrs. Harry Gorman) and
Mrs. Howarth, of Grenfell, were sisters.
They all had literary tastes.
“E. J. J.”: Perhaps “Pip Tok” (P>.
4/11/’2O) and “C.0.M.” (B. 11/11/’2O) may
be interested in the origin of the common
English pub-sign, “The Cat and Fiddle.”
Old-time English sailors when visiting
France used sometimes to leave their belong-
ings in safe keeping. A particularly reliable
depository was run by one Caton, who adver-
tised himself as “Caton le fidele.” The ori-
ginal “Cat and Fiddle” vias apparently
given its title by one of these sailors who
claimed to give faithful value in the matter
of his “pots.”
The Hayseeds have drawn first blood in
the Vic. Assembly in the fight for available
perks: Weaver, who beat Achilles Gray three
years ago for Korong, has got on the Rail-
way Committee. Allan Cameron and Deany,
two Liberals, both thought 'they could get
the numbers and go in with Toutcher. Law-
son, beforehand, summoned all the members
sitting on the Ministerial side. Hayseed’s
Thirteen sent John Allan as a deputy to say
that it would attend if allowed to nominate
one member of the two required on the
Speaker’s right. The Liberals told Allan
that if his group attended it could nominate
somebody, of course, but the man named
would have to take his chance. A nod was
as good as a wink, however, for Ministers
who need support; and Toutcher and Weaver
got the numbers.
Matt. Baird, Vic. Chief Sec., who won his
own majority in Gallipoli, agrees with
Thomas, new member for Glenelg, that mili-
tary titles should be dropped by members of
Parliament. Baird asked why he should \>e
starred in Hansard division lists as a major
while Labor members like Webber and Slater,
who each did all that fell to them as pri-
vates, should be described as mere misters.
Bourchier, one of the Playseeds, who is a
lieut.-col., is given his military title in Han-
sard, while Tommy Ryan, of Essendon, who
was a sergeant, and got to England just in
time for the Armistice, is an ordinary mister.
Each side of the Assembly has three mem-
bers who served —Bourchier, Baird and
Ryan, who sit on the Speaker’s right; and
Slater, Webber and Parker, who roost on his
left. It looks as if Thomas and Baird’s
view will prevail, and that the House officers
will take the hint.
“Dust”: The luckless loco, in the railway
smash on the Westralian timber line that
whirled away nine lives was known as the
Jubilee, having been imported in pieces from
the Baldwin works at Philadelphia about the
time of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.
It was assembled at Denmark (W.A.), in
the heart of the karri forests, under the eye
of Chief Mechanical Engineer A. S. Hume,
now retired. Shortly after it was placed in
commission there was a strike of railway
hands on the Great Southern Railway, and
PI. Teesdale Smith, then general manager of
the big timber company, was moved to do a
bit of strike-breaking with the Jubilee by
personally taking charge of things on the
footboard and running a train over the G.S.R.
with the mails to Perth.' The Jubilee was
the largest loco, in the timber industry; in
fact, it was the largest loco, in the State for
years.
“PI.V.E.”: I don’t think nature students,
at any rate, will agree with “E.F.” (B.
21/10/’2O) in his estimate of Gilbert White.
Putting aside the occasional stiltedness of his
phraseology, he has not only given us many
charming pen-pictures of birds, etc., but (in
the words of Professor Newton) “half the zoo-
logists of the British Islands for the past SO
years [Newton wrote in ’96] have been in-
fected with their love of the study by Gil-
bert White.” White’s fame soon spread to
Germany, a translation of his book being
published at Berlin in 1792, only three years
after the publication of the first English
edition, and several reprints have appeared
in America. His imitators are countless, but
not one of them has done more than produce
a “very pretty book” of no scientific value,
whereas White’s is of value, being very
rarely inaccurate. I admit that “classics”
are, in the main, books which most admire
and very few read, but it is not true of the
vivid work of this great observer.
“Grasping Landlord”: I am among those
consistently abused for putting my rents up
on a lady who may be a widow some day,
and on her husband who has been an orphan
for years, but I ask you what’s a man to
do. I bought the shop some years ago,
when it brought in £1 per week. A little
later the agent got £1 2s. 6d., and not long
after it went up to £1 55., at the instance
of a would-be tenant and without exciting
remark. It is now bringing in £1 7s. 6d.,
and a man who wants it badly has made an
offer of £2 ss. per week. Indeed, the latter
is chasing me with a form of lease in one
hand and a deposit in the other. What is
a man who has no desire to inflict injustice
on anyone to do in such circumstances? I
have poor relations (my wife, for instance)
much more deserving of that extra 18s. per
week than the-tenant, but if I take in the
man offering two-poxmd-five I know I am
doomed to be listed with the grasping land-
lord class, whereas in solemn truth all the
reaching out and clutching to date has been
done by tenants, and if I failed to respond I
feel I would be extending charity to people
who. if I offered them sixpence, would cer-
tainly give me a black eye.

The oldest inhabitant of the stalls would
probably tear what is left of his hair at “The
Mikado” (Sydney Majesty’s), for theatrical
easts, like other things, are not what they
were when he was a boy. Still, this show
will not fail to satisfy the young and the
iniddle-aged who haven’t had the misfortune
to live among giants. Frederick Hobbs, as
the Mikado, is a fearsome-looking blackguard
whose general appearance suggests a love for
beautiful, lingering deaths. But looks, how-
ever gruesome, don’t make amends for a song
whose words are chewed into a pulp and
served up so that they are quite unrecognis-
able. That is Hobbs’s failing. The Ko Ko
of Chas. Walenn is a humorous old fool, who
occasionally quits the book and climbs over
the fence into low comedy, but is alive and
hard-working the whole time. Gilbert might
not like it—that is for Conan Doyle to dis-
cover—but meantime Walenn is a x'ery popu-
lar Ko Ko. Albert Kavanagh carries scarcely
enough dignity as Pooh-Bah to justify his
family pride. The newcomer, tenor James
Hay (Nanki Poo), has a voice that goes
straight to the flapper’s heart and the advan-
tage of youth as well. And Patti Russell’s
Yum Yum is sufficient excuse for the Lord
High Executioner to be anxious to behead
the romantic Nanki Poo. The remainder of
the cast is well up to the standard set by
these, and the orchestra does director Slap-
offski no end of credit.
$ $ $
That cheerily immoral show, “The Girl in
the Taxi,” returned to Sydney Criterion on
Saturday night. Some of the casting is
weak. The worldly-looking William Greene
has no chance as the youthful and ingenuous
Hubert who is driven to take his pleasure on
10s. a week. Cyril Ritchard, contrariwise,
never manages to suggest anything more
rakish than a frolicsome curate. But Alfred
Firth fools with most artistic restraint as
Pomerol; George Willoughby makes a living
character of the Baron; and there is Field
Fisher with his preposterous yet perfectly
credible head waiter. Cecil Bradley does
well as Susanne, and the Sydney girl Madge
Elliott is dancing and singing better than
ever.
:Jc ss:
Laryngitis took Marie Tempest by the
throat on Saturday, and Sydney Palace bad
to do without “Penelope” in consequence.
“The Duke of Killiecrankie” was given an
outing, and Doris Gilham, who had Miss
Tempest’s part of the spirited Mrs. Mull-
holland, did well enough to mollify the dis-
appointed audience. Graham Browne as
usual was excellent as Henry Wilby, the
hard-up friend who has his eye fixed firmly
at all times on the main chance.

day night’s ma-
terial a company to
draw an audience
not entirely com-
posed of the play-
ers’ relatives and
friends. But what
could any com-
pany do with “The
Two Mr. Wether-
bys” of this per-
formance ? There
is no meat there,
either intellectual
o r emotional; i n
fact, you suspect it
of not having even
a bone, but of
being held together
by a wooden
skewer. Mrs. C. E.
II oth a m, as the
testy Aunt Clara,
was an oasis in a
desert, and Harold
Watch as Robert
Carne raised some
real laughs; but
others were not
fair to themselves
in appearing with
so little coaching in diction, deportment and
the art of looking pleasant. The show was
at the Sydney Repertory Theatre, and next
Saturday, the co. will play Shaw’s “Getting
Married” there.
Cupid has a bad time of it at Sydney
Crystal Palace and Lyceum, through skewer-
ing the hearts of Joe Benson and Dorothy
AVhynn on the one dart. Dorothy’s father
is an apoplectically-disposed Southern colonel
with a nice taste in shooting-irons; also his
pal is one of the flighty sort, and Joe has
to pretend to be married to the other fel-
low’s fiancee before the wedding-ring is w r arm
on his own bride’s finger. If you think you
know' what happens after that, you’re mis-
taken. As the sub-title says: “No man has
pep enough to fight the World and his Wife
too —so Don’t Ever Marry.” The Crystal
Palace has another winner in Pinero’s “Gay
Lord Qjuex,” with Tom Moore as the young
Marquis who picks up his rosebuds while he
may. The additional Lyceum flutter is
“Snow in the Desert,” in which the lion-
tamer of a hero looks as though Dame Mag-
gie’s two cockies would scare him badly. The
Globe and Haymarket palpitate with the
heart-throb of the week. Tom Meighan
plays “The Prince Chap” to his little
foundling daughter, Lila Lee, who grows into
the princess of his dreams. The Strand
features Olive Tell buttoning and unbutton-
ing a bewildering array of garments. Life
with her seems just- one damned dress after
another. The unexpected title is “Clothes.”
Allen Bindley’s amateur co. gave a credit-
able performance of “Girofle-G-irofla” at Mel-
bourne Playhouse on Saturday. Pauline
Bindley doubled the twins who cause all the
disturbance, and her fresh young soprano was
not more taking than her professional aptitude
on the dramatic side. Daisy Bindley made
Paquita in the likeness of her bright blonde
self, and her best boy, Pedro, was Vera Len-
non in a Well-filled pair of tights. Victor
Bindley fussed amateurishly behind the grey

whiskerings of Don Bolero, and he had a
dominating missus in Maisie Bell, who faced
her responsibilities with cheerful confidence.
William Reed’s well-nourished baritone as
Mourzouk was the prize warble of the even-
ing, but his notion of a tempestuous Moor
needed amendment here and there. Clarence
Liddell sweetly tenored his troubles as
Marasquin; while Alex. Potter, decorated
with skulls and cross-bones as the Pirate
Chief, was like an ancient battlefield seen
by moonlight. The large and tuneful chorus
never wavered in its obedience to Allen
Bindley’s baton. The orchestra was also
in good form, and the dancing was as
exuberant as the limited stage-space allowed.
Arthur Stigant is still wearing the bad
eye of a blameful night in “The Boy” \at
Melbourne Majesty’s. Also Leslie Holland
continues to enfeeble his elocution with his
enormous consumption of jujubes. Since the
opening night he has swallowed about a ton
and must now be feeling like a glue-pot.
❖ 'l*
The cutting up of “Shore Acres” by a real-
estate shindykit will cease to excite the
populace after Saturday at Melbourne King’s.
For the following fortnight, apparently, the
Tait, Bailey and Grant panto will be having
preliminary canters behind closed doors.
The rumor that the Australians helped
to drive the Turk out of Palestine is still
almost confirmed in Lowell Thomas’s travel
patter at Melbourne Royal. Thomas seems
to have met two or three of the Light Horse
and Camel Corps near the fighting line, but
as he omits mention of the remainder of the
Digger army, the presumption is that they
were behind making afternoon tea.
Another of Zane Grey’s yarns. “The Lone
Star Ranger,” is hurrying Bill Farnum over
some angry American scenery at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne, this week. William tries to
teach peace and good works to a gang of
cattle-rustlers, but the business is sadly
hampered by the bright eyes of a goddess
played by the young Australian, Louise
Lovely. Hoyt’s other star, Priscilla Dean,
does ‘The Exquisite Thief” in nocturnal
iva id s on No o
Yoik’s Four Hun-
dred. In the pur-
suit of this mourn-
ful hobby she en-
counters a profes-
sional crook, and
the miracle of love
turns them back to
th e path of
righteousness. The
Majestic is thrill-
i n g its followers
with an ice-bound
drama. “The Cour-
ag e of M arg e

ing a well-staged
fight between
grizzly bears. The

E. F. Hooton’s show of 170-odd water-colors at
the Athenaeum is a finer example of industry than
art. He is a tireless producer of sweetly-common-
place effects, generally presenting aspects of the
bush that were made for scenes in Family ’Erald
serials, but rarely achieving the limpidity and color
that would condone his choice of subjects. Accord-
ing to his catalogue, he has Baedekered the ferns
and trees in practically all Melbourne’s tripper
resorts, and has often got up in the early morning
to catch some favored scene in the stealing mystery
of dawn. He scores most in his smaller sketches—
“Templestowe” (No. 119) is a sample of his best—•
but he misses in his ambitious attempts to copy
bits of dirty weather. His stormscape (No. 159)
almost materialises the thunder, and his “Falling
Bain” is disqualified by the ruddy error of the sky.
He seems to use his scenery sparingly in his largest
efforts, and the result, as in “Road Near Croydon”
(No. 2), is a placid monotony. “Near Temple-
£towe” (No. 1) is better quality; on the other hand,
“Near Upwey” (No. 25) is on the road to Bathos
and not far away either.

Adelaide shows have woke up again.
Wilkie is just starting a long Shakspeare
season at the Royal. The Garden Theatre
(the old open-air stand behind the Ex-
hibition) proves a big success for the So-and-
So’s, who are running a Williamson medley
that draws the town. George Welch is the
leader, Presto'n and Lucy Sullivan are notable
dancers, Grace Lavers has the old charm, and
the singing is particularly good; also Kitty
Elliott is unusually bearable as a child
“entertainer.” Pictures are very American,
barring a season of “"Snowy River” at the
Pav.; Clara Kimball Young scores heavily
in an ordinary sort of play at West’s, and
at Wondergraph (which is now “continuous”
from 11 to 10.30) is Bill Hart in his
characteristic part of a Bad Man who really
is White. Really good concerts are past' ail.

-From an Adelaide critic:—
The Society of Arts in Adelaide is getting a, little
tired of holding Federal exhibitions, from which
works are bought for the • State Gallery, without
Sydney and Melbourne reciprocating. When the
war began a seheme was being planned to have the
shows in the three cities alternately, and probably
this will shortly be done. Meanwhile the 23rd
annual exhibition is now on, in the Society’s gal-
lery on North Terrace. Every State except Westralia
is represented, and the average is high.
Most interest attaches to the S.A. Gallery pur-
chases. They are three. Penleigh Boyd’s “Peaceful
River” is a water-color of his favorite up-the-Yarra;
it was seen here lately in a show at Preece’s. “Holi-
day,” by J. Muir Auld (N.S.W.), is a bold composi-
tion of four girls making picnic, with sunlight
splashing through foliage. The upright figure at
the back is rather obviously posing for her portrait,
but the whole is a striking “gallery picture.” The
versatile James R. Jackson, of Sydney, is also
selected, in a tired dancer resting “After the
Rehearsal.” Governor Weigall, who opened the Exhi-
bition, was a prompt purchaser of a J. H. Ohinner
caricature of himself, and of a Cumbrae Stewart
“Pantomime Fairy.” Miss Stewart’s work is new to
him, and he enthused about it publicly. She has
been much bought for the Gallery in recent years.
By her works hang similar figure studies by
Dora L. Wilson, whose “Peacock and Gold” mirror-
study is specially effective.
Prominent on the walls are three large landscapes
by the wandering genius, the late E. W. Christmas, a
glacier in M.L. being particularly striking. Elder-
shaw of Tasmania is unpretentious, but is going to
be worth watching. Hilda Rix Nicholas is audacious
and memorable. Local people mostly repeat old suc-
cesses—Janies Ashton (with a host of pupils who
have more or less caught his touch), John White,
Edward Davies, Gustave Barnes, Gwen Barringer and
Mrs. Mouehette. C. J. Pavia strikes a new note in
the brilliant little painting of a Japanese carving.
It is a good and stimulating show.
Henry Lawson’s yarn for the Christmas
Bulletin is “Previous Convictions.? Law-
son spent a year or so out at Yanko, and
slowly he is using the material he gathered
there. “Previous Convictions” is part of
it —one of those stories that are told with
the utmost simplicity and with no apparent
effort get you by the throat. It will be
published on Saturday, December 11.
“Yarva Ken”: The Wirths will have to
look to their laurels, for the Tivoli people
are evidently going in for the hippodrome
business. “The Camels are coming, Hurrah !
Hurrah!” runs a line in the preliminary
announcements of “Chu-Chin-Chow.” And,
again: “The Chu-Chin-Chow Menagerie,
comprising Camels, Mules, Donkeys, Horses,
etc.” But, after all, the Wirths will have
the pull. They don’t charge £1 Is. 9d. to
see their show.
“C. Ockney”: “When in doubt play Sar-
dou” seems to be the motto of ambitious
leading actresses in England at the present
time. Ethel Irving put up the French
dramatist’s “La Tosca” not very long ago,
and, although the revival did not exactly set
the Thames on fire, Marie Lohr has gone to
the same author for her latest production—
i.e., the nearly 40-year-old “Fedora.” Aus-
tralia saw the ancient melodrama with “the
English Bernhardt,” Mrs. Bernard Beere, in
the name part.
“J.R.D.”: Yarmouth, the skirt-dancing
lord who was in Queensland 30 years ago,
was no mug on a horse. He visited
Eungella station, Mackay, piloted by Capt.
C. N. F. Armstrong—then Melba’s husband
and colloquially known as “Kangaroo
Charlie”—and the interesting pair put up a
record for shooting wild bulls and running
cleanskins on the Eungella Plateau. The
noble lord was a figure of fun to the black
boys, and did his best to amuse them. They
called him Bimbirai —“a real good fellow.”
The Prince of Wales’s tour among the pro-
fiteers was a frost compared with that of
Yarmouth among the stockmen and niggers
on the Broken River.
“Row 3”: J. and N. Tait are prepared
to act as foster-parents to the Sydney Reper-
tory Society—on a business basis. The con-
ditions are that Gregan McMahon and the
enthusiasts who are behind him secure 700
members before Jan. 1 next at a guinea
apiece, plus two guineas for seats at five
shows. If they do this, then dramatic art will
be given a chance to express itself under the
most favorable conditions possible. The
amateurs who appear will be carefully
trained by pros.; lectures on the drama will
be arranged for, and Culture generally will
be given a vigorous hoist. Failing an
adequate financial response, however, the city
will be left to do the best it can with jazz-
parties.
Talking of the projected flight to Europe
of Esther and Betty Paterson and their
youthful mother, somebody remarked that
mamma looked almost as young as when she
played Diana Vernon in “Rob Roy” at the
end of the century before this. The girls
hardly remember their comely parent as
Diana with the feather in her hat. It hap-
pened at the old Alexandra (now Her
Majesty’s) when the Caledonian Society
staged “Rob Roy” for two nights in aid of its
charity fund, and she looked prettier than
the picture of Diana Vernon in the National
Gallery. John Mclntyre appeared as Bailie
Nicol Jarvie on one of the nights, and the
story goes that he was starred, not because
of his histrionic talents, but because he was
a member of the State Government and had
a handle to his name. Poor old Jock! He
didn’t long survive his theatrical offence.
From E. C. W. Kelly, a Melbourne bar-
rister :
Thb (18/11/’2O) has remarks about the
evidence supposed to have been given by me before
the Federal Taxation Commission. Let me explain
that I didn’t give it. First, I did not advocate
a tax on companies as such; secondly, as a practis-
ing barrister I could scarcely fail to know what
The Bulletin says about shareholders’ estates pay-
ing probate duty on shares in companies held by
the deceased. My remarks about a wealth-tax were
specifically directed mainly to the case of Great
Britain. The Chancellor there seems to hold the
same opinion as I expressed ; so also did the Com-
mission which investigated the matter. I pointed
out that such a tax would be of service under pre-
sent circumstances only so far as debt locally held
was concerned—largely for the reasons given in
The Bulletin article. Finally, I agree with the
last part of the article, as I have always tried to
impress that wages, interest, rent and profits are
paid and can only be paid out of the products of
industry; wherefore I could not hold antagonistic
views to large-scale industry.

“124”: 111-health and Anno Domini pre-
vented a unique reunion at the last night of
Allan Wilkie’s just-past Melbourne season.
Fanny Wiseman, 75, and one of Vic.’s
oldest actresses, played Third Witch for
the first few nights of the season, acquitting
herself admirably—and incidentally proving
(off-stage) that she can still high-kick like
a 15-year-old. For the last night it was
arranged that Eloise Juno, aged 85, sole
survivor of the G. V. Brooke period, and in
her day famous interpreter of Helen
“THE MIKADOA T SYDNEY.
MAJESTY'S.
Charles H. Walenn as Ko-Ko.
McGregor and Lady Macbeth parts, should
have a seat in the manager’s box. Fanny
Wiseman applied again for her Third Witch
part for the evening of her senior’s pres-
ence. This was granted, and Fanny
played; but poor Eloise proved not to be
well enough to leave home, and the re-union
fell through.
Ibsenshaw : Spiritualism on the stage —
the modern stage—proves a tiresome sub-
ject and unsatisfying entertainment. It
takes a Sliakspeare to call spirits from the
vasty deep and make them interesting. Not
so long ago Australia saw - “The Invisible
Foe,” which was mainly concerned with the
after-death influence on his friends and
relations of the First Old Man, who “passed
over” in the first act. (All First Old Men
should pass over in the first act —or the
prologue, if there is one.) Although Emelie
Polini played the lead the public stayed
away in thousands. The same thing hap-
pened recently in London. Two serious
attdhipts at psychic drama—“ The Un-
known,” by Somerset Maugham, and “The
Crossing,” by Algernon Blackwood, the
novelist—were produced within a few weeks
of each other. Neither of them, in spite of
tremendous booming, could keep the ghost
walking. The latter piece, in fact, lasted
only 11 nights.
“Old Pot”: The appearance which taxed
the acting and nerve of Howard Vernon
more than any other that I recollect was in
the farcical extravaganza “Are We Down-
hearted V” at the Sydney Playhouse, then
the Little Theatre. One of the artists got
“the bird,” and Vernon and his clever wife,
Vinia de Loitte, were up against it. They
battled hard, and though unmercifully
trounced by some of the critics gave a much
better entertainment than many which had
been passed over without a dose of vitriol.
Vernon made the mistake of lampooning
newspaper men in his finale. Pie should
have kept green in his memory the saying of
Larry Foley re the unwisdom of quarrelling
with the press: “Never fall out wid a bottle
of ink!”
“0.K.”: “The Face at the Window,” with
which Bill Anderson frightened the Maoris
in days of old, was a bellowdrama in advance
of its period. We
used to think “The
Face” ran to ex-
travagance in the
way of horrors
when the galvan-
ised corpse of one
o f “T h e Face’s”
victims was per-
suaded to sit up in
his shr o u d and
complete the writ-
ing of the name of
the murderer upon
a sheet of paper.
But that electrified
corpse was only a
hint of horrors in
store. In a play
at the Little
Theatre (London)
lately a misguided
scientist adminis-
tered an electric
shock to a corpse,
with the result
that it raised one
hand to the scient- •
ist’s throat and
squeezed him to
“The Girl in the Taxi,”
at Sydney Criterion.

Baron Dauvray.
death—one of the few ingeniously horrible
methods which the late Harrison Ainsworth
omitted to put into novel form.
“Ancient Prompter”: Australia’s honest
little mirth-provoker W. S. Percy has at
last tumbled into”’ a part in England which
should carry him along. Up to now he has
had the experience, common enough with
mummers who chance their luck overseas, of
rehearsing and playing a dozen or so comedy
roles in pieces that have not “clicked.” Now
he has settled down for a run round the
“pfoyinces” with “Irene”—and that’s a
winner wherever it has been played. Percy
is the Madame Lucy—the man-dressmaker
played here by Chester Clute of America. It
should suit him and his audiences.
“The Unknown Mummer”: The three-
penny programme is no good to me. There
was a time when I came on the stage feel-
ing that the audience knew me by name—
when, even if I didn’t get a “hand,” I
knew that we were acquainted, and that
after the show they (or some of them)
would go. home and talk about me. Now
nothing happens. When I make my entrance
the people in front don’t know me from a
bar of music. I arouse no particular inter-
est —I’m just a mummer paid to amuse; a
nohentity. And why? Because the majority
of theatregoers don’t buy programmes, and
thbse who do only get as far as the corset
advertisements when the lights go down and
the rag goes up. Managers used to print
your name in the full cast on daybills not so
long ago, but that bit of publicity is nowa-
days abolished. So now it’s a case of “That
bloke who chased the girl in the first act,” or
“That fair-haired tart who swallowed the
poison in the last scene.” Nobody knows us.
Nobody cares!
“75” : No member of the Australian theat-
rical contingent in London has scored a more
genuine success than Daphne Pollard. She
has been appearing at the Hippodrome for
four years, and is now about to do five weeks
at the Victoria Palace, after which she is
going on tour with her “Cleopatra” turn, one
of the most palpable hits of its kind admin-
istered to Cockney music-hall audiences.
Daphne s salary is of impressive dimensions,
and the illustrated weeklies of the Sketch
type at regular intervals publish full-page
pictures of the charming young antipodean
actress propelling a punt along the rivm-
or feeding the chickens at her week-end
bungalow.
Ant : Three or four Gippsland horsemen
were rehearsing a riding turn intended to
put a little thrill into an Australian film.
Suitable bucks had been secured with some
difficulty, and were got going with a few of
tho adventitious aids known to horsemen in
the show business. Suddenly one lightweight
rider was hurled into the air by the vicious
little sorrel mare he was riding, made a
complete revolution in the atmosphere, and
landed astride a piebald with his face to
the tail. Meanwhile the rider of the piebald
who had been thrown at the same moment
tell face down across the sorrel. Both riders
clung to their new mounts for a few seconds
before being propped off. Then the man
with the camera kicked himself nine times,
crying aloud to Heaven the while. He had
missed getting it. His agony was excusable
—missing a stunt like that is like tossing
aside £lOOO.
“75”: Owing to the obstinate London suc-
cess of “Chu Chin Chow” N’Yark has seen
Oscar Asche’s new production, “Mecca,” be-
fore it has been unfolded in the Fog. There
are the usual gorgeous Oriental settings
and ballets, daringly undressed show girls,
and lavishly produced tableaux, in which
400 persons figure; but N’Yark first-nighters
were, not overwhelmed, and seemed to be
waiting for a thrill that never arrived. When
the show is produced in London Asche will
play an aged wrestler and Lily Brayton a
sultan’s widow. Whether the “Chu Chin
Chow” boom can be repeated is exceedingly
doubtful. Two recent spectacular produc-
tions put on in London regardless of expense
—“Eastward Ho,” with Asche specially en-
gaged as producer and Violet Loraine for
the lead, and “Modorah,” scarcely less expen-
sively produced, with Ada Beeve as star —
both proved dismal failures.
“Norbell”: Kenneth Brampton wasted a
fine chance of a world-beater of his
“Robbery Under Arms” picture. As it is,
the story is haltingly told, and its ending is
knock-kneed ; also countless crudities discount
its many excellencies. The bush girls—
Aileen had “never even seen a shop-window”
—riding around the ranges in tailor-made
“divideds,” and many solecisms of that kind,
are so shriekingly obvious that one wonders
what the perdoocer was thinking of. As
Starlight Brampton cuts a fine figure, and
the unobtrusive Warrigal is about perfect,
but the rest of the cast, and the also-rans,
are weak in many directions, and narrowly
miss getting the bird, even from audiences
case-hardened by American preposterosities.
The absurd Berrima Gaol scenes are par-
ticularly banal. Why was the opportunity
for telling scenic effects so badly missed?
Terrible Hollows are surely not hard to find.
I remember Alfred Dampier up at Hillgrove
(N.S.W.) taking infinite pains to get photos
and sketches of the remarkable gorge there
to help scenic artist John Hennings in his
work. If such detail was necessary for the
stage version, how much more is it needed
for the screen?
“Smike” : Let me give you the sequel to
“Floater’s” tale of the Falstaff inflated by
Beerbohm Tree (B. 18/11/’2O). It happened
one night that the globular Tree, coming on
hurriedly, caught his tummy on a projecting
nail in the scenery and exploded. Some of
the stage hands and the cast crowded round
offering help, but Tree waved them back with
“Give me air!” As they retired about two
inches he boomed again (pointing to his
busted abdomen) : “Don’t you see, fools, I
need air !”
“Stett” (London) : By the birth of a son
to. Mrs. H. B. Livingston, wife of the British
Vice-Consul at San Francisco, two actor-
knights—Squire Bancroft and John Hare-
have become great-grandpas. The lady is a
daughter of George Pieydell Bancroft, who
married a daughter of the Hares. Squire
Bancroft, now 79, is still seen regularly in
the stalls at “first nights” wearing a large
monocle and giving his well-known imitation
of a Gentleman qf the Old School.
“Orb” : For the first production of George
Darrell’s “Sunny South” at Melbourne
Opera House, in March, ’B3, the cast in-
cluded Edwin Palmer, Fred Appleton, Bill
and Chayley Holloway, Oily Deering, Harry
Daniels, Harry Leston, John D. -Foley,
II.; A. Douglas, H. R. Jewitt, A. Rolfe, Essie
Jenyns, Alice and Constance Deorwyn,
Carrie Bilton and George Darrell himself.
Nearly all have passed on, alas ! But Harry
Leston is still active, Harry Daniels is stage-
doorkeeper at the Melbourne Tivoli, or was
till lately, Jewitt (or Jewett) is an Ameri-
can manager, Alice and Constance Deorwyn
(Mrs. C. Holloway and Mrs. .“Dick”
Stewart) are still as young as ever, and
George Darrell may be seen on the sunny
side of Pitt-street almost every day.
“Bill Bile”: Your playgoing will cost you
more—as many of us, noting recent changes,
suspected it would. Mclntosh takes the
“One guinea plus tax” is his charge
for "preferential booking” for the opening
night of “Chu-Chin-Chow.” Even Asche
couldn’t get that price in London. Yet he
managed to rub along with the one - piece for
over four years. And made at least half-a-
crown out of it, too.
“THE GIRL IN
THE TAXI,"
AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Alfred Frith as Monsieur Pomeral.
“C. Ockney” : Arthur Wontner, the lathy
juvenile lead in Australia for two years with
the Julius Knight-Maude Jeffries co., is
now a full-fledged actor-manager in London.
A new piece, "The Romantic Age,” by the
coming-on, if not exactly arrived, Punch
humorist, A. A. Milne, has just been staged
by him at the Comedy, with himself in the
central limelit character. Wontner is also
following in the footsteps of brother-man-
agers Oscar Asche and Matheson Lang,
whose motto seems to be: “If you want a
play written write it yourself.” He is
adapting one of Jeffry Farnol’s novels in
collaboration with the author.
London is getting steadily educated down
to the Parisian taste for horrors. The latest
agreeable trifle to be translated for the
Little Theatre is of a sculptor’s studio that
seemed to be haunted by an uncanny pre-
sence. A spiritualistic medium reveals that
a. previous occupant, being jealous, had hit
his wife on th‘e head with a hammer and then
built her up in a large block of plaster which
is conspicuous on the stage. Whereupon the
sculptor and a doctor tear away the plaster,
and there emerges the green decomposing
face of the corpse.
The tall and picturesque Ethel Warwick,
well known on Australian stages, has turned
from her melodramatic ways (she was last
seen here as Mrs. Potiphar in “Joseph and
Ilis Brethren,” and on a previous visit was
Nellie Denver in “The Silver King”) and
has become a Shakspearean actress. When
last heard from she was appearing as
“Chorus” in a revival of “Henry V.” at the
London Strand.
“Rabbit Skin” : The dear old Lord Mayor’s
Show still survives in London. No amount
of ridicule, domestic unrest, fog, general
hard-uppishness or fed-uppishness can kill it.
Ihis year it took the form of a “Pageant”
under the direction of Louis N. Parker, the
playwright, who labelled it “Makers of Lon-
don,” and chose the period of Julius Cmsar
down to William the Conqueror. Two hun-
dred characters mounted and on foot pro-
cesh.ed through the November mud, and after
it was all over the Gaud Mayor went to the
Munching House to lunch, and the supers
went home to cough-mixture and mustard
baths.
“Dido”: The Blank Brothers were run-
ning a small circus in those days, and had
secured their first lion at second-hand rates
from a big returning American concern that
did not think the brute would survive a sea
voyage. The Blanks were very proud of
their gigantic Nubian lion Ismail, and got
out a lot of flaring posters showing him at
his worst, snarling horribly at a big black
who faced him with a white-hot iron. Ismail
was said to have eaten quantities of people
before being drawn into captivity, and nine
or eleven since. The elder Blank always
delivered an address on Ismail the Nubian
in the menagerie department before the
beginning of the ordinary circus perform-
ance, and was going as usual one night, tell-
ing of the fearful things Ismail had done,
arid the horrible things he was likely to do,
whefh a small boy was seen to be at the cage,
his artu through the bars, poking at Ismail
with a stick. “For God’s sake, stand back,
boy!” yelled the lecturer. The boy did not
stand back. He merely turned his head and
said: “It’s all right, Mister—he’s dead!”
THE BRAVE DAYS OF OLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Greene, a tyro on the stage,
Talked with the fallen star;
With due respect for luckless age
He proffered a cigar.
Old Roscius took it with a bow,.
Then railed against the times,
And marvelled that the vogue was now
For slapstick pantomimes.
“This modern rubbish I resent,”
The faded actor said;
“The trash and treacle they present
Denotes that Art is dead.
“Gadzooks! The public pay to see
These mountebank cheapjacks,
And then are quite content to be
Mulct an amusement tax!
“ ‘Virginius,’ ‘lngomar,’ ‘Rob Roy,’
We’ll never know again;
Sticks can’t interpret them, my boy,—
There are not any men l
“And the Immortal! When I think
Of triumphs I have known,
Small wonder that I take to drink,
And tear my hair, and groan!”
“You juggled Shakspeare,” Green observed,
“And thrilled the pit and stalls!
Of course you got what you deserved—'
Tremendous curtain calls?”
The ancient gave a tragic smile
And smote his puckered brow;
Then thundered in his turgid style:
“There’s nothing like it now!
“As Hamlet I was always called—
Gad, sir, they gave one shout,
Then whistled, bellowed, stamped and bawled,
And dared me to come out!”

MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
A piquant feature of the first N. S. Wales
Aerial Derby was the winning of the Evening News
cup by the” Sun. The Sun began by ignoring a
stunt which the hated contemp. had made peculiarly
its own. But when there was talk of refusing the
Aero Club’s advt. someone in the know decided to
show the paper a simple method of tearing whatever
reclame attached to the event from its rival’s grasp.
The betting was about a million to one on Captain
Matthews’ 200-li.p. Larkin-Sopwitli Gnu. A day or so
before the race the Sun adopted this vehicle as its
“colt,” and from then onwards the air-meeting got all
the publicity it wanted. About 9000 people struggled
over the dreadful Mascot roads to the splendid
Mascot aerodrome, and nine machines faced a gale
which blew now from the nor’-west, now from the
nor’-east. The square, box-built 90-h.p. D.H.6,
piloted by the boyish-looking I). R. Williams, buzzed
off at 2' o’clock with a start of 35min„ and had
turned the Richmond aerodrome mark at 2.32 (aver-
aging 60 m.p.h.) three minutes before the giant
Gnu took off. The three Avros, starting at 2.25,
made a striking spectacle as they banked and
wobbled in the wind. Captain Matthews flew low on
the outward spin. On the return he climbed out of
the “pockets” and “bumps,” but towards the finish
roared down to 500 ft. The great machine did the
64-mile trip in 42min. 54sec —110 m.p.h. Three
Avros (the first two Mascot-built) filled the places,
their pilots and times being F. L. Roberts (46min.
54sec.), S. H. Harper (48min. 50sec.), and Nigel
Love (49min. 25see.), The handicap went to Love
(13min.), who beat 11. J. Butler (15min.) in a
B.E. 2E. by a few seconds. Both these machines
have done well in commercial enterprises in the
State. ....
Captain Roy King, D. 5.0., D.F.C., who had flown
over from Melbourne a couple of days previously in
the useful time of 51 hours (in the air), was to
have dropped from a parachute during the proceed-
ings. He was eager to fulfil the contract, despite
- - /
the weather, but the committee vetoed it. Lieut.-
Colonel Oswald Watt’s cup for the finest stunting
exhibition was won by Lieut. F. L. Roberts, who joined
the A.F.C. in Egypt after a spell on Gallipoli with
the Light Horse. He is the young man who flew to
Queensland with the Prince’s mail, and he gave
samples of every stunt in his repertory on Saturday
—barring his favorite feat of flying under a bridge.
Only three centuries were recorded in Syd-
ney grade cricket on Saturday, and J. M. Taylor
(Gordon) got one of them against the easy C.C.
bowling. Coogan took three of the five wickets that
fell, including Macartney—for a blob! “Wally”
Pite, of Waverley, lets go some bottled-up stuff once
in a while, and it was Middle Harbor that suffered
this time. Donovan and Hogue alone played him
with confidence. Ranji Hordern reappeared for the
Boneyarders, but his only victim was his old school-
fellow, Roy Minnett, who put his leg in front.
O’Keeffe (63) was Paddington’s best run-getter
against Wests, although M. A. Noble, with Wells as
a partner, is 20 (not out) and capable of anything.
Norths met trouble in the ’Varsity batsmen, for
whom Rock got most runs. His 117 was slow but
faultless. Best and E. Bardsley also made liberal
contributions. Norths capped their bowling by
being slugs in the field. Collins, the Sydney cap-
tain, was unable to do much with his bowlers against
Glebe. Gregory was off-color and Asher failed to get
there. The fieldsmen as usual were on the tips of
their toes. Bogle and Bardsley batted quietly, and
the latter (96 n. 0.) showed his best form this
season. On his batting for Balmain against Peter-
sham, added to his excellence “behind,” Ratcliffe
demonstrated yet again his claims for the notice
of the inter-State selectors.
* * * *
Queensland v. Sydney ’Varsity match at
Brisbane last week, gave the Northerners a surprise
win by 20 runs. Sydney led by 23 runs in the first
innings; but Queensland scored 201 in the second
whack, and Sydney was left with 178 to win. Then
A. J. Marsden, swinging a deadly left arm, took
eight wickets for 112, and N. S. Wales crumpled
for 158. Marsden also took seven wickets in the
first innings—a great feat of 15 wickets in the
match. On this fine effort he got a place in the
Queensland XI v. England.
* * * *
G. S. Moore, who is giving Queensland a
hand in cricket this year, is an importation from
N. S. Wales. He uses a vigorous straight bat. In
a trial match a week ago he smote 70 (run out) out
of 190, and followed it with a brilliant 85 v. Eng-
land XI (including a sixer off Wilson) on Saturday.
* * * *
The wicket-keeps are beginning to show up
in big cricket. In the Vic.-South Aus. match in
Melbourne Ellis, the Victorian, caught four and
stumped one in the visitors’ first innings. Winser,
who nurses the sticks for South Aus., was almost
equally dangerous, stumping two and catching two
during the Vic.’s first try.
* * * *
In the absence of Collins, Macartney,
Kippax and Tozer, who with Carter are to play for
an Australian XI in Brisbane against Douglas’s
team, the N.S.W. selectors have chosen the following
for the match N.S.W. v. S. Aus. beginning on Dec.
3 :—Kelleway (capt.),
Oldfield, Bardsley,
Bogle, Gregory, And-
rews, Hendry, Mailey,
Taylor, Punch,
O’Keeffe and Brown.
Asher or Arnott might
easily have had
Hendry’s place after
the latter’s form in
the recent big match.
The team is woefully
weak in bowling; but
so is S.A. To qualify
for the Colts’ side
against England on
Dee. 14 the players
must be under 25 and
not have taken part
in a Sheffield Shield
match. The 19
selected don’t look very
formidable. Garner of
’Varsity has been
passed over, and for
some odd reason the
selectors have included
Foskett (Moore Park
Association), a player
on matting wickets,
and a schoolboy—New-
man, Newington Col-
lege.
JACK HOBBS,
of the English XI.
Pat O’Hara Wood failed to wrest the Aus-
tralian Singles Championship from Gerald Patterson
in Melbourne on 'Saturday. Patrick made a big
effort, running the champion out to 12—10 in the
first set and scoring repeatedly in his service games,
but the great struggle exhausted his energy, and
he fell away in the next two sets (6—3, 6—2)
with all his steam gone and his game in shreds.
Patterson, slicing almost everything on the ground
and battering long tosses that it was safer to return
into play, won by the sheer weight of his service.
After this strenuous match it was unreasonable to
expect Wood and Patterson to do well with their
partners, Heath and Brookes, in the Doubles final.
If the Lawn Tennis Association hadn’t had a greedy
eye on the gate it might have saved the young
champions the double event on the one day, especi-
ally as any extra strain might have impaired their
practice for the Davis Cup. However, both Patter-
son and Wood played bright tennis, Wood even
equalling the fresh and untroubled Brookes in his
placing and overhead work. Heath lost the battle
for Wood by his early errors, which gave the enemy
a heavy lead of 10 games to love, and left the'first
two sets showing 6 —o, 6 —l against them. Brookes
and Patterson got home with S games to 6. Barring
the Ladies’ Singles Championship, which was won
bv Mrs. Molesworth (N.S.W.) (7 —5, B—6) against
Miss Boyd (Vic.) all of the other big trophies went
to Victoria. Miss Schlesinger and Miss Boyd (Vic.)
beat Misses Addison and Westmoreland of the same
State in the Ladies’ Doubles (6 —3, B—6). Miss
Schlesinger, with O’Hara Wood as her accomplice,
lifted the Mixed Doubles after a battle with N.
Peach and Miss St. George (N.S.W.) (6 —3, 6—4).
“15-30” : The inclusion of Rod Heath in
the Australian Davis-Gup team is a large reward for
his recent play in the Vic. championships. Heath
has shown nothing like international form in the
Doubles, and, barring a bright but patchy game
against Patterson, his Singles plav is nothing to
make a poem about. Actually he didn’t do as well
against the champion as young Jack Hawkes, who
had the big fellow touring the court in hopeless
pursuit of his passing shots. Nor did Heath put up
a game remotely resembling Norman Peach’s great
triumph over Norman Brookes. Melbourne critics,
who are so full of Brookes’s glory that they habitu-
ally minimise his defeats, didn’t pay sufficient tribute
to Peach’s performance. Even when two sets to the
bad and standing 2 —3 in the third, he continually
beat the patriarch out of position and worried him
with a service carrying surprising pace and spin.
Brookes may have good tennis reasons for disliking
both Hawkes and Peach for the fourth place in his
team, but, all the same, the choice of Heath doesn’t
dispose of the accusation of* cliqueism, seeing that
Brookes, Wood and Heath are old Melbourne Gram-
mar boys who are socially thick apart from their
tennis connections. Before next year’s Davis Cup
the Australian Association would do well to amend
the doubtful practice of making the selection a one
man’s job.
Towards the end of the 10th round at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, the occasion
being Francis Charles (France) v. Billy Shade
(America), the towel suddenly came in from the
Gaul’s corner. No one seemed to know why, and
least of all .Charles, who kicked the defenceless wipe
in speechless fury as he left the ring. The techni-
cally “outed” pug. had won more than half the
rounds, and was apparently as strong as a bull.
There was some tremendous slugging during the
bout. Charles went down in the second session and
might have had difficulty in resuming but for the
intervention of the gong. Shade was floored in the
seventh, and in the midst of one of his prancing
aggressive movements at that. In the interests of
clean boxing, to say nothing of the principal’s record-
book reputation, it is about time the rules as to
giving it best in the ring were amended. After
all, if neither the boxer nor the referee thinks the
thing has gone too far, it is out of place for a
third party outside the ring to interfere, unless that
party happens to be the police.
Teams from Victoria, N. S. Wales,
Queensland and Maoriland exchanged wallops and
holds in the amateur boxing and wrestling cham-
pionships at Brisbane, the first since 1914. The
offertory was a record— £366 on the first night and
£329 on the second —but the form was not first-
class, and the adjudicating (there were two judges
and a referee) was very so-so. Queensland carried
off most of the boxing honors, winning three of the
six divisions—feather, light and welter—and
providing the second in the welter and middle.
Stanley, the featherweight champion, was the clever-
est boxer of the tournament. In his first encounter
he outpointed King (N.S.W.), thrice champion of
Australasia, and in the final he defeated Kay, the
Victorian coming in each case with a Poitrel-like
finish after being behind in the first couple of
rounds. But Morgan (Q.) was lucky to get the
decision over the N. S. Wales lightweight Thomp-
son, and his scrap in the final with Desmond (M.L.)
was an extremely close thing. Another questionable
decision was given at the expense of Lawless, the
M. welter; Hungerford, his alleged conqueror, was
beaten in the final by Gilshenen (Q.). Finlay, the
N. S. Wales middleweight, had a rough time m his
first fight with Williams (Q.), being nearly out in
the last round, but he was a bit ahead on points
and beat 0011, the Queenslander, in the deciding
bout. Bell (N.S.W.) won the bantam division from
Maddocks (M.L.) ; and in the heavyweight class
McCleary, a chunky Maorilander, got all over the
prolonged Cornstalk Lang. Victoria and N. S.
Wales divided the wrestling championships, Angelo
(Vic.) winning the featherweight from Dierig (Q.),
and Smythe, the heavyweight from Jenkin (Vic.).
’There was no M.L. representative.
* * * *
The Maoriland heavyweight boxing cham-
pionship, has been settled between - Tom Heeney
(Gisborne) and Albert Pooley (Auckland). Although
Heeney got the worst of the opening rounds, he
wiped out the deficit and won the title on points.
Jack Heeney, M.L. middle-weight champion, is an
elder brother.
The big prizes of this year’s English
racing season were distributed with curious even-
ness. Sir R. Jardine heads the list with £19,250.
Lord Glanely, the one-time shipping clerk, who is
not amongst the first half-dozen this year, was top
in 1919 with £30,654 —chiefly by the efforts of
Dominion and Grand Parade. Captain Loder, the
owner of the Derby-winner, Spion Kop, could do no
better than sixth, and he collected £10,035.
* * * *
“Costs” : Last week’s decision in the King’s
Bench Division —that “bets made by cheque are
recoverable” —threatens to overthrow the whole
bookmaking edifice. Under the Gaming Act wagering
and gaming contracts are prohibited, and any con-
tract to pay based on the result of a race or what
not is null and void. Hence the practice known as
“pleading the Gaming Act,” which since 1892 has
been an irrefragable defence to a claim by a bookie
on a cheque bettor. Mr. Justice Rowlatt has appa-
rently gone the entire logical hog and found that as
the bookie never had any legal right to his winnings
in the first instance the money—puce the Statute
of Limitations —still belongs to the Juggins who paid
it over. The main standby of the Ring will be
the desire of the general body of punters to keep the
bookmaking game alive. It is in this spirit that the
sinitten sportsman who pleads the Gaming Act is
rebuked more severely in the West End of London
clubs than one who has swindled an entire street of
retail tradesmen. Assuming that last week’s decision
is upheld on appeal it is pretty certain that any
loser who claims his pound of flesh from the Ring will
become a social outcast. The more so as the position
will be so flamingly inequitable. Pickersgill, who
retired with about three-quarters of a million sterling
after betting with every sporting monarch in Europe
and their friends, used to say that he would be twice
as rich if he could collect half the money he was
owed. The position of pencillers with a less reliable
clientele is proportionately worse. Under the new
arrangement they will be there to be legally shot at:
the men who owe them money may be dead or bank-
rupt or in gaol. In short, the new decision is almost
certain to be disregarded, after the first flush of
predatory excitement has died away, on the good old
principle that no law which is inherently rotten is
obeyed for long.
A paragraph frequently appears in the
daily papers on these lines:—
“Mr. W. Hardcase and his trainer. Jack Rook,
had a big win over the favorite. They also obtained
several thousands through a Tasmanian source.”
Everyone knows what it means, and all agree
that it is scandalous; hut no effort is made
to stop it. Yet the A.J.C. and V.R.C. could
probably end the swindle out of hand by a
law to the effect that no nominations would be
received again from any owner or trainer found
guilty of scratching a horse because the required
blackmail was not forthcoming.
CHARLES MACARTNEY (N.S.W.).
The feature of last Saturday’s swimming
was F. S. Cotton’s defeat of! Billy Longworth in the
220yds. first-class handicap at the Sydney Uni. Swim-
ming Club’s carnival. The winner might well have
been picked for the Olympic swimming team last
season, having won a test over 220yds. in the excel-
lent time of 2min. 33sec., in addition to licking
Keith Kirkland in the Northern Suburbs 220yds.
championship in 2min. 35see. He is also in the
front rank as a long-distance runner and as a
wrestler. A son of Frank Cotton, one of the pio-
neers of the N. S. Wales Labor movement, he did a
fine Science course at Sydney Uni, and was pro-
bably the youngest lecturer ever appointed to the
Medical School there.
At the Dunn Shield championships at
Sydney on Saturday, O Nothling won both the
161 b.-shot putt (36ft. and javelin throw
(149 ft. 2in,). He won the latter event last year
with 165 ft. slin. “Slip” Carr (East Sydney) did
level time for the hundred in his heat as Well as in
the final, thus equalling the N.S.W. and shield
records. Champion Walton Hunt, much below form,
finished fourth. G. P. Schoolboy F. W. Edwards
(Easts) did the 120yds. hurdles in 16 l-ssec., equal-
ling the record. The 440yds. provided the best finish
of the day, W. H. I-lutton (University) downing
R. J. Honnor (Uni.) in 52 l-ssec. Honnor won
the broad jump with 23ft. lin. Roy Harbison’s
(Uni.) pole vault (l'oft. 6in.) and 11. G. Grande-
mange’s (Botany) mile (4min. 35sec.) were won
comfortably. George Parker—just back from the
Olympic games—took the three-mile walk in 23min.
50sec. He is yet much below “top.” The day’s
points’ tally left University (201 points) well in
the lead from East Sydney (12) and Souths (61).
* * *
The race for the Rawhiti Cup was again
staged last Saturday by the Royal Prince Alfred
Yacht Club. The trophy w’as lifted by Sunbeam
(A. W. Crane), which won when the race was last
sailed during the 1913-14 season. Seven started, viz.,
Oenone (25min.), Magic (18min.), Sunbeam
(I7min.), Scotia (13min.), Yeulba and Aoma
(12min), Bona (scratch). The thrash to Manly
gave Competitors a fine chance to show their wind-
chewing qualities. All except Yeulba. the G.-G.’s
craft, refrained from extras, but Walter Marks,
whose North Sea experiences have apparently made
him reckless, chanced a topsail. He had not gone
half a mile to wind’ard before it got him into
trouble; and he was not afterwards sighted.
Aoma, splendidly handled by Stan Stevens, literally
ate the blow to the mark at Manly, and was first to
ease sheets for the run to Shark Island. Magic (F.
B, Langley) turned at the village lOsec. later, fol-
lowed after a 15sec. interval by Oenone, which had
21min. to spare from Sunbeam. With topsails and
spinnakers aloft the fleet raced to Shark Island, and
Crane’s craft, speeding like a hydroplane, soon
headed them, and jibed at the buoy with 7sec. to
spare from Magic, which had also displaced Aoma.
When the yachts hauled a wind at Pinchgut Sun-
beam had increased her lead to 15sec. The punch
back to the Watson’s Bay light saw Stan Stevens
sail a magnificent course, and he was first to
square away with a lead of lmin. from Magic, which
had also headed Sunbeam on the work down the
harbor. However, on the run home Sunbeam made
lip the lost ground beautifully, and reached home
l|min. ahead of Aoma (Stan Stevens) with Magic
(F. B. Langley) 12sec. away.
The Springfields are again busy among
Queensland swimming championships. In the half-
mile the other day they filled the leading places, Sid
—winning from brother Frank by 10yds. in 12min.
29 2-ssec. ; and Mabel was-second to E. Venning in
the 100yds. State championship in 72see.
* * * *
Tom Howard (Bonnie Doon) showed a
return to golf “form” in winning the Ellsmere Cup
at Sydney on Saturday with a fine round of 77. G.
T. Balcombe (79) and W. C. Sturrock (83) had the
next best cards.
* * * *
F. G. Murdoch, S. Aus. golf champion,
is shifting to Sydney. Ivo Whitton, Victoria’s top-
notcher, also recently settled in the Ma State, and
is on the links regularly. The invasion won’t make
it any easier for the N. S. Wales champions to hold
their places.
MY CUP OF SORROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The London air is foggy and the London skies are
grey,
And I find my thoughts are turning to a country
far away,
Where the sun is always shining—so, at least, it
seems from here —
And things are looking bosker just at this time of
the year,
When the Spring has danced a jazz round Winter’s
unregretted corse,
And Melbourne is preparing for its Carnival of Horse.
Though the London streets are gloomy and the London
rain is wet,
These are minor circumstances I could manage to
forget.
When September came I murmured, “Now the wattle
is in bloom” ;
But an imitation sun was making patterns in my
room,
And the fancied scent of wattle I was able to dispel;
But the Cup’s a different matter and Fogopolis seems
h—l!
I do not know what’s running, and I have not seen
the weights,
Though November is approaching; there are men
in all the States
Whose thoughts are turned to Melbourne and whose
breasts are filled with hope,
While the sporting scribes are handing out the cus-
tomary “dope.”
In the sun-splashed Riverina, down in Gippsland, in
the West,
They are talking over “chances” with the old dog-
matic zest.
I have marked the famous Tuesday on the almanac,
and here
I will sit beside a fire and “kid ,K -that Flemington
is near.
I will see the boshter women on the terraces parade,
While I listen to the airs by Zelman’s hefty bands-
men played; -
And perhaps I’ll catch an echo from the distance
where the sun
Turns to gold the floating Ring-dust, lisping: “I
lay twoth to von.”
Though the southern sun is kindly and the southern
scents are sweet,
I could feel less like an exile as I look into a street
Where the yellow lamplight flickers, were it not that
I resent
The stony-hearted scheme to which the V.R.C. has
lent
Its sanction, since, apparently, it means to run the
race
As usual, though i'll not be in my accustomed place!
I do not miss the gambols of the sprightly kangaroo
(I scarcely ever saw them save when visiting the
zoo) ;
And the kookaburra’s music does not reach me over
here;
But I feel absurdly sad and life seems more than
merely drear
When I think (the pretty pathos of the thought is
hard to bear) —
“Now the boys are off to Flemington, and T will not
be there!”

Whence comes
all that is
exclusive
People who love to imagine themselves in
vice-regal places wonder what were the feel-
ings of dear Lady Forster at Wirths’ Circus
the other Thursday. It was the Excellent
lady’s first experience of circus and men-
agerie. Never in her life before had she seen
sawdust clowns or performing elephants and
things. The beautiful young creature on
the gently bounding steed was a new experi-
ence to her, and the daring gymnasts who fly
over the areha were revelations in how to
earn one’s living by risking one’s life. Citi-
zens who have acquired the circus habit in
infancy can’t imagine what the wonders of
Wirths’ must seem like to a fair novice of
considerably more than seven. Was she
more surprised than delighted, or did amaze-
ment wait on admiration? Certainly her
initiated lady-helps must have thought some
of the outfittings of the circus remarkably
smart, for the Olympia building was a jazz-
palace not long ago, and Jhe former- lessees
are threatening to go to law with the Wirths
on some question regarding the frills and
fixtures they erected ere the fox-trot gave
place to dog and monkey gambols.
There is real mourning in Federal political
circles for Alfred Conroy, the ex-M.H.R.,
who died last Sunday in Sydney—he had
been ill ever since lie had the ’flu three
months ago. He used to weigh 16-stone, and
for years possessed the strength of two men.;
but as often happens in such cases the heart
failed. Conroy was a man of wide reading, a
brilliant talker and an effective Parliamen-
tary debater, but he never made much of a
mark in politics. The reason chiefly was that
he lived to fight for lost causes. Freetrade,
pacifism, anti-vaccination —these and a dozen
other things he battled for with furious
He had that genius for un-
swerving friendship which one of his great
friends —B. R. Wise—so oddly lacked ; and
his ideal man, to the last, was old Henry
Parkes.
A question that awaits Lord Stradbroke on
his arrival in Melbourne is why on earth
the stereotyped honor of knighthood was con-
ferred upon him recently. Making a Iv.C.M.G.
of a belted earl seems much the same thing
as pinning the order of the dustbin upon the
prdud breast of a duke, xxll the majesty that
doth hedge an hereditary title melts away in
the suggestion that the coming Governor of
Victoria needed promoting to the titular dis-
tinction of a re-elected Gaud-Mayor.
Unwilling to stand up to the opposition
threatening from country members if they
went on with the purchase of Kilbride, in
Toorak, at a cost (with additions) of
£30.000 or so, the Government is arranging
to get an extension of the lease of Stoning-
toii. The Stradbrokes have been sounded,
and they say the old place will suit them
very well.
Despite the promise of a damp finish, a
record crowd ‘gathered round the tennis finals
at the Albert Ground on Saturday. The
stands w r ere full of Importants, including
Lady Forster and retinue, and the pavilion
was crammed with tennis authorities. Among
the latter were the Dunlop and Brookes clans,
and Tommy Cochrane in a red and white
striped collar that would have filled an old-
time nigger minstrel with envy. Girls in
brilliantly flowered garments cheered on the
gladiators, but the voices died away as the
rain drenched their parasols.
The very naicest Maorilanders almost
shudder when their champion. Jeff Olivier,
comes on to the spick-and-span tennis-court
giving a rough imitation of a tramp. Even
some brother Maorilanders are quite worried
about the sartorial slur he casts on “God’s
own country.”
W. G. Higgs, M.11.R.. nnd Senator Tom
Bakhap are convalescent after a chilling ex-
perience. Noticing that there was talk of
forming an association in Melbourne for the
study of modern languages, they concluded
to drop in. Bakhap has a good knowledge
of colloquial Chinese, and Higgs has dabbled
a little in modern tongues. Arrived at
the rendezvous, they found themselves
among a gathering of higli-brows belonging
to the uppish side of the Melbourne Uni.
There was a great deal of recondite talk
about the need for really scientific study of
the “various Australian dialects,” and of
the exact shades of difference between the
languages of Col ling wood and Toorak.
William Guy interposed with a few mild
remarks about the practical necessity for
studying the languages of nations bordering
on the Pacific. The heresy was cut short
by a higli-priestess of culture, who icily
observed that the gentleman’s ideas were
doubtless interesting, but their utilitarian
nature was not in accord with the ideals for
which those present desired to strive. Then
Higgs and the Senator from Tasmania faded
out with a frostbitten feeling.
Thomas Woollard, Clerk Assistant of the
House of lieps., retires in February after
over 40 years’ service in Parliament. In liis
early days he was on the Geelong press, but
after marrying a daughter of Graham Berry
liis ambitions turned towards the State House,
and he captured a post there, climbing after-
wards to the snug berth of Sergeant-at-Arms.
He was on this perch in the Federal Parlia-
ment until two or three years ago, when
the promotion of his senior, Walter Gale,
gave him Gale’s seat on the left of the
Chairman. Woollard is an amiable and
popular official who will probably be suc-
ceeded by Clapin, the present Sergeant-at-
Arms.
Walter Lucas, head ftf the Expropriation
Board which is handling the properties for-
merly held by Germans in Rabaul and there-
abouts, is in Melbourne conferring with
the Prime Minister. Hughes was to have
gone to Rabaul, but his visit has been post-
poned indefinitely. Already the properties
formerly held by the big German companies
have been taken over; and Lucas has
recently been round the islands on
H.M.A.S. Melbourne on a supervisory trip.
What is to be done with the estates of
private German persons doesn’t seem to have
been settled yet. The Government is
entitled to take them all and “liquidate”
them, leaving the owners to extract their
compensation from the German Govern-
ment.
Rumor is busy anticipating the marriage
of a front-rank war-knight, a widower. The
same tabernacle suiteth the lady with whom
Rumor couples the big man’s name.
Mrs. Edward Moorhouse, who for years
has led a peaceful English life, has just
returned to Maoriland by the Remuera on a
six months’ trip. She used to be May
Rhodes, only daughter of the late Wm.
“Barney” Rhodes, of Wellington, by his
first wife, who was a Maori lady of vast
nobility. Later W. B. Rhodes annexed one
of the handsome Moorhouse women, and soon
left her a widow. Then occurred the mar-
riage of his daughter to Edward Moorhouse,
brother of Mrs. W. B. Rhodes, which made
the latter lady step-mother and sister-in-law
to Mrs. Moorhouse. There was a close
friendship between the two. William Rhodes-
Moorhouse, the first airman to win the V.C.
—he perished in the effort —was a son of the
E. Moorhouses. Their daughter Ann mar-
ried a son of Dean Kyle, of London. Our
one-time Bishop Moorhouse was of the same
clan.
Jean Robertson Cotter has been in the
interminable list of recent divorce petitioners.
Agar Wynne’s first wife was the widow of
John Robertson, and he took over two
daughters with the widow. Jean, one of
them, married an Englishman of “family.”
Jean took the money into the partnership,
and leaves with two children to the good.
Having sold its former temple for con-
version into a garage, the Australian Church
(Dr. Strong’s) has acquired a block of land
in Russell-street, beside the Herald office.
The Quakers’ meeting-house opposite will
help to keep it in countenance.
Proud of getting one of their number in
each House of the State Parliament, the Vic.
B.M.A. gave a shivoo in honor of Harris and
Argyle on Friday. But Dr. Harris is a vine-
grower as well as a sawbones, and that is
how he happens to be a Hayseed member.
Basil Kilvington is to succeed G. A. Syine
as president of the Vie. branch of the B.M.A,
Syme did his profession good service in help-
ing to straighten out the difficult dispute with
the friendly societies.
Accompanied by members of his family,
State Treasurer McPherson, who by that
time may be S’William, will go to England
in January. He is not particular whether
he holds on to his portfolio or not, but
Lawson wants him to, and will act for him
while he is away—always provided, of course,
that no fatal accident happens to the
Ministry before Christmas.
Toorak is quite upset over the departure
of a popular American couple, the Chaiincey
Luftkins. “Chauce” represents the interests
of the Texas Oil Combine. He look's as if
he were designed by Dana Gibson, and his
wife might have come off a magazine cover.
They are being entertained to the ear lobes.
The curates will be working overtime for
the next fortnight. Bobbie Landale, of Mun-
diwa station, Deniliquin, makes darlc-eyed
Jean Fairbairn Mrs. Robert. Tbpnotch ten-
nis-player Eileen Hughes, daughter of the
General and niece of the Canon, makes John
Feehan, a straightgoer in the hunting field,
a happy man. This marriage unites well-
known Anglican and Catholic families. The
Jack Feehans will leave by the Euripides
for Africa, where they will endeavor to pot
a hippopotamus or two before going on to the
big fog.
Douglas Mein’s engagement to Mrs. Harold
Whittingham, of Queensland, is announced.
The local buds are considering an appeal to
Premier Lawson about placing an embargo
on attractive widows —they make competi-
tion so
The Clarkes, now that Roma’s wedding day
is past, are trekking to the Mt. Schank home
for a rest. All round the subbubs Sassiety is
packing its saratagos for a summer flit.
Mrs. Staughton opened artist Hooton’s
show at the Athenaeum and set a seal on
some of the best sketches. Hooton, a young
man of amazing energy, took up this work
only about 18 months ago. Before that
he was helping a song-and-dance show at St.
Kilda Beach —he is brother-in-law of the
large Brock of the various Dandies.
Lady Forster is taking a live interest in
the Free Kindergartens. Last week she in-
vited the executive and educational com-
mittees and the council to Government House.
Then she threshed out the position in a
business-like way and established herself as
a hard-working patron. On one thing
she insists—the need for continuous com-
parison of work-reports from the various
branches. Mrs. Baldwin Spencer, Mrs. Tom
a’Beckett, Mrs. Morris Phillips, Dr. Con-
stance Ellis and Mrs. Wrigley were at the
meeting, representing the executive. And,
of course, Miss Glendenning, supervisor of
Kindergartens, with Mrs. Valentine from the
Ballarat centre,
Nancy, daughter of the legal knight
Mitchell, is to marry George Hill Adams, of
Inglefield, Toorak.
Longstaff’s father, Mr. Ralph Longstaff,
of Shepparton, was 96 years old on Nov. 20,
and had a party. He came from Weardale,
Durham, in the colony’s early days, and is
a patriarch of the Shepparton district.
Dame Melba’s grandson arrived at the
Armstrongs’ house in London on November
20, and died a day later. There is a very
sad cable from Melba announcing the news
to the family in Australia.
Williams, pictured here by Rich-
ards, of Ballarat, is the author of “The
Mahogany Ship,” an
Australian book
written around an
old wreck at Cur-
die’s Inlet, and
lately published in
London. Williams is
penning further en-
tertainment for the
boys of all ages, and
meanwhile earns a
buttered crust as a
survey draftsman in
the Commonwealth
service. Like a lot
o f Australians h e
has tackled many
callings, and there
are gleams of old
experiences as
cocky, schoolmaster,
bush-surveyor and what not in his tale. Wil-
liams is a Bananalander, but squandered
much energy in Gippsland before coming to
Melbourne to try to annex an arts degree.
Dorothy Low, who married Don Pedro
Vargas, a South American merchant in
London, a while back, lately left the Fog
for a visit to her husband’s people in Colom-
bia. The Vargas family is understood to
live in Bogota, the quaint mountain capital
which, though almost bisected by the
equator, is cold enough at all times to make
chilblains and blue noses a failing. As a
matter of fact, winter clothing is worn all
the year round, and coal-fires and Spanish
translations of Elinor Glyn are necessaries
of life.
The Islands tell the time by “Beepy.”
No one speaks of dates in weeks or
months. A job will be fixed “next Mar-
sina.” Somebody is due “Morinda after
next,” or he plans a holiday a few months
ahead by “the third trip of the Melusia.”
Time in New Britain goes on furlough
between boats. Probably it is because the
whole place thinks in cocoanuts. Time is
cocoanuts and cocoanuts is copr'a. The
world turns gently until boat time; then
everything is a fever and clerical work is a
frenzy and Kanaka boys slip up and down
with endless bags of copra. “The Boat”
slips away, and the populace sinks back till
“Next Boat.”
Sometimes “Beepy”—which, of course, is
short for Burns Philp-—play up seriously
with sentimental affairs. One young man,
waiting in liabaul for his boat to a far
island, expected to collect his best girl before
the inexorable call. The youngster had
spruced up, cut down his drinks and his
hair, and had made arrangements with the
sky-pilot for a hurried splicing. He spent
his time in irreproachable linens and that
mixed fever of terror and expectation that
besets a waiting benedick. Suddenly the
time-table of the boats was altered. Clar-
inda’s Marsina or Morinda came “by ports”
instead of “direct.” so of course Clarinda
was delayed, too. Then the steamer for
the wayback island fussed in, and Adminis-
tration drove the bridegroom off to his job.
Artist George Coates and his wife (Dora
Meeson) are coming back to Australia —on
a visit. Coates is bringing with him a num-
ber of portraits of Australian warriors and
artists painted in London, including one of
Will Dyson which he thinks is among the,
best things he has done. Mrs. Coates will
also exhibit some reminiscences in oils of war-
time scenes, the most notable a large canvas
showing wounded Diggers leaving for this
land of sunshine.
Mrs. Arthur Robinson is wearing mourn-
ing for her mother, Mrs. Katherine Buckle,
who passed out a few days ago at Wattletree-
road, Malvern. She was the widow of W. S.
Puckle, of the London Bank. Twp other
daughters are Mrs. Hay, wife of Dr. J. B.
Hay, and Miss R. K. Puckle. As one of
the rulers of the A.W.N.L., Mrs. Robinson is
more prominent in politics than her husband,
who, though State Attorney-General, merely
leads the Uppah Chainbah, and is a pillar of
Collins House.
Carre-Riddell, chairman of the Board of
Works, is going for a trip to the Cold Coun-
try next year. He proposes to spend nine
months abroad, and to return early in 1922.
Kitty Boyes, who married Captain Russell
Jackson (her sister is Mrs. Ted Dyson), is
in England ; and the papers have been retell-
ing the old story about her experiences in
Japan, including her arrest as a spy. On her
arrival in London Kitty, who had done a bit
of modelling at home, blushed to find herself
starred in the papers as an “Australian
sculptress who has come to London to make
studies of English politicians.”
A widow who is a bulwark of Sassiety at
South Yarra is famous for her absent-
mindedness. Recently she invited a large
party to her club to meet some distinguished
visitors just returned from travel. Every-
thing was arranged to perfection—except
that she forgot to send the date to the dis-
tinguished visitors themselves. Fate had
it that they were booked for an opposition
party at that very club, so the widow had
to .see her chief guests carried off by the
other cat.
Sister Adelaide fans herself and says:—
How is this for hale old age? When the Buffalo
arrived here in December, ’36, its passengers in-
cluded Marianne Fisher, then a small child of 10.
The same lady arrived again a few days ago in the
Osterley—from Maoriland via the Eastern States this
time —with the intention of settling down at Glenelg
for as much longer as she may live. It is more
than most of us will be doing at 94.
Amongst its London-bound passengers the Osterley
included Mrs. Osborn, M.Sc., whose husband is in
the chair of botany at the University. He is on
furlough in England, and she will join him there for
a couple of months before they return together early
in the new year. Incidentally, she carried on his
work at the Uni. practically up to the day she
sailed.
Barring a few personal bequests and legacies, the
whole of the £60,000 left by Miss Blanche Graves
goes to charities —amongst them the Children’s Hos-
pital, the Training School for Nurses and the District
Trained Nurses’ Society, various institutions for the
blind, deaf and dumb, and the Aborigines’ Friends’
Society.
Adelaideans who meditate voyaging to England
include Irene Kemp, Katie Joyce, William Silver,
Edgar Yates and Jack Bishop—all musicians, and
all bent on getting polish. Miss Kemp won the
approval of Moiseiwitsch while he was here, and goes
armed with a letter from him to Miss Mabel
Lander, who is looking after his pupils in London.
The week has brought us an orgy of fetes, among
them a “Christmas Market” at the Cheer-up Hut in
aid of the cottage hospitals for the Murray soldier
settlements. Lady Weigall pushed it hard (the
cottage-hospitals are her pet scheme), and sent her
own purchases off to other charitable institutions.
Good wishes in plenty go from this State to J. J.
Virgo, of the Y. Emma, who has married Miss Ash-
ton, daughter of a Birmingham cleric. They met
while on war service.
One of the two pictures at the Federal Art Exhi-
bition bought by his Ex. was Mrs. Sherwood’s
“Model.” The other was a caricature of his Ex.
himself by J. 11. Chinner, who entertains himself
with Art when he isn’t managing an insurance co.
Clever S. Australian artist Bessie Davidson has
been made an associate of the Paris New Salon,
getting 100 votes out of the 112 cast. Lambert,
Rupert Bunny and George Coates are the only other
Australians who have won the honor.
Queensland’s new Excellency dined at Government
House on his way eastwards, and the George Deans,
the Bracegirdles, the Mouldens and some of the Eng-
lish riflemen and their wives were bidden to meet
him. Government House, by the way, is temporarily
one short in its staff, Private Sec. Legh Winser being
in the South Aus. cricket team that has gone east.
Mrs. Caroline Pollitt, widow of one of this State’s
earliest Anglican clerics, died the other day. It
was her mother, Mrs. Carleton, who wrote that
shrill melody “The Song of Australia.”
Decorous Adelaide has dropped heavily on a man
for trying to make the acquaintance of an attractive
stranger. The horrible language he used was offici-
ally recorded as: “Good evening. Your friends are
late. Are you speaking to-night? Oh, come on,
say something! You are not deaf and dumb, are
you? Do say something; it is better than nothing.”
It happened that she was a police-womah, and she
took the words down and promptly arrested him for
“behaving in an insulting manner.” The Court
brushed aside his suggestion that he thought it was
a lady he knew, and called it £5 or two months.

ORIGINAL PLYMOUTH
The purest spirit
in the world.
The connoisseurs of the reign of
George 111. hailed Coates’ Original
Plymouth Dry Gin as the purest spirit
in the world.
That was when the famous Black-
friars’ Distillery first produced it at
Plymouth, England, in 1793.
Since then it has never varied in
quality, but to-day you appreciate in
it that added mellowness which only
long maturing can give.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
David
Jones
Catalogue
The Archgaiters Wright pair are restoring
the light of their presence to Sydney. The
Randwiclc Rural Deanery’s chivoo at Eynes 7
bury on Dec. 15 will be the church’s wel-
come to its wandering pastor. The Orvieto
brings him back. By the way, was there
a connecting-link between the Bishop’s
return, the feeding of the sheep, and the
Telegraph’s announcement that “fresh
mutton is again on the market”? When
can't you buy a mutton-chop in Sydney?
That Mrs. Kenneth Street should blanch
on the edge of the discovery that the
National Council of Women is not progres-
sive is humorous to the busy woman who
has been content to let the nice old things
potter along. How could you expect Pro-
gress fi’om dear old bodies with a tendency
to sweeping skirts and bonnets, some of
whom suggested a year that the waist-
less, hip-swinging flappers in office and shop
should be encased in uniforms because in
ordinary dress they offer succulent tempta-
tion to man? Anyway, Mrs. Ken Street
has thrown her secretaryship back to the
president and council, and Grace Scobie is
behind her.
The thing most to be regretted about the
whole trouble is that in the course of it
the reformers have aimed their shafts at
Rose Scott, who has been International Sec-
retary of the National Council of Women
for 40 years. Even if the progress of
yesterday is the stagnation of to-day, it is
still good to remember that lovable Rose
Scott was the Donna Quixote of the
women’s cause in those early days when
the champion of woman’s rights was the
butt cff nearly every comic paper the world
over. The Rose Scotts live forever in better
conditions for the working girl, they have
given the business and the professional
woman her independence, and, best of all,
they have given the baby a better chance.
An intrepid young woman in grey stock-
ings elaborately worked with brown aerial
designs was one of the fascinations of the
Aerial Derby, which the hard-battling Cap-
tain Matthews won on Saturday. If “sport”
stockings are to be a fashion some queer
things will be calved for a weary old world’s
delectation.
On a brick-dry day last week, when the only
welcome greeting was “Could you stop one,
old fellow ?” the Women Prohibitionists met in
the vestibule of the Town Hall with a view
to damming the beneficent mouthwashes that
pour from Tooth’s and Toohey’s. Earnest-
looking females draped the chairs in the
vestibule, and the Edgeworth David lady
opened the meeting with perfect diction,
followed by Dr. Mary Booth, full of practical
suggestions, Also present: Mrs. Wolf-Cairns,
who appears to support Louise Mack’s theory
that the German atrocities in Belgium were
committed “under the influence” —she lived
in Brussels and admits that the family’s
cellars were rifled by the sponge-like Hun.
Mrs. Jamieson Williams then unloaded a ton
of statistics to prove what Prohibition had
done in Manitoba and Quebec, but didn’t
add, what Ruth Beale found out, that every
other housewife in some of the States is now
her own distiller.
Amy and Eileen Castles have gone back
to Melbourne after their Sydney jaunt. They
were the guests of the Dan Kellys, who, as
Amy remarked, “even offered you your collec-
tion money on Sundays.” Mrs. Dan gave a
tea-drinking farewell to the songbirds, and
the party had two notable features; one
the mint-julep compounded by the. hostess —
a duck of a drink on a 97-deg. afternoon—
other Mrs. Macdonald, who used to
be Kate Slattery, a singer of the days when
listeners showed their enthusiasm by throw-
ing nuggets of gold on to the stage. In the
corner of a high-backed oak settee Dorothy
Coffee (Mrs. Dan’s nipper sister) glowed
like a primrose ; and Eileen Castles, despite
the recent breakdown, showed cosily-round
through black, bunched-up taffetas. The
O’Sheas from Brisbane, with attractive Doris
Gillies from the same town, Mrs. Burfitt, and
a Coffee aunt were among the party that Dr.
Dan looked in on after the day’s operations.
Another party among the merry-makings
the Castle sisters were treated to was a com-
bined welcome-home to Dorothy Coffee and
Helen Bridges, Lionel’s daughter, who
married a Belgian. Hardships of travel
haven’t left a trace on Helen, who has re-
turned quite a beauty. Mrs. Neil Macdonald,
of Mosman, gave the party, which was mostly
jazz, with interludes of exquisite music by
one of the family.
Amy intends doing a concert tour through
Australia early next year, and Eileen is
booked up for opera from January.
ln recognition of her war-work, Mrs.
Campbell, of Narrabri, was entertained by
the grateful Diggers of Wee Waa the other
day. She was invited to the township by
the sub-branch of the Returned Soldiers’
League, whose members met her at the sta-
tion with an escort; and at the subsequent
swarry every soldier present took his turn
to kiss the dear old dame whose heart is
still young, though her hair has been
whitened by 80 winters.
The natural blond at the end of the room
sat fanning her legs, while a girl at a table
higher up cooled off her armpits. It was not
an acrobatic turn—merely an in-between
jazz incident at the Wentworth dinner-dance
in aid of the Y.W.C.A. Smart frocking and
smart people were everywhere; nobody
looked the outcome of a Y.W.C.A. hostel,
and one wondered what the committee of
such a place would have to say to a little-
sister inmate who was discovered in such an
atmosphere of high lights and highballs—
there seemed no damming of Old Scotch
among the guests. Quite a number of
guineas were scooped in for the cause from
both Jew and Gentile (several of the dance-
diners were of the Chosen) ; but most of the
big Y.W.C.A. committee-women were absent,
or else cooling off in the garden, for it was
a moist night, when one’s skin feels like a
bit of perforated tissue, and a woman knows
that the calf of her leg is steadily melting
and her best silk-stockings turning once
more to pulp. Arthur Rickard aired his
new title (not Torrens), and his women
showed some expensive frocking; the Ryrie
lady sat with the Bruche couple ; Mrs. Sep
Levy brought two tall sons and a pair of
red heels. The theatrical Jack Haskell
and his rose-pink partner were outed in the
jazz competition, the prize going to a demure-
looking little person in black taffeta. Binns
Rabett wore beautiful clothing in blue and
lilac, and Jill Rich the darkest-green satin;
and if wearing o’ the green stands for any-
thing, half the girls were agin the Govern-
ment. Mrs. Black, who secretaried the
venture, was tall and graceful and wore an
expanse of gold brocade; and treasurer Mrs.
Bruce Lachlan kept an eye on things in a
green and blue dressing.
This is Judith
Fletcher’s picture of
Eleanor Ross, whose
Shakspeare Women
Players continue to
give such a good
account of them-
selves. Eleanor, by
the way, was the
first to give Shaks-
pearean recitals in
Sydney schools, in-
cited thereto b y
Miss MacLellan, of
the North Shore
Girls’ High. Master
Will is her first love,
and next after him
she favors Oscar
Wilde’s fairy stories
for her recitals. She
has already done two of these with the beauti-
ful music of Liza Lehmann.
Nurse Shirley Robinson, of St. Vincent’s, is
leaving the swabs and the dressings behind
her, and intends wielding an O-Cedar mop
solely in the interests of Dr. Pat O’Shea.
The fair girlishness of Mary Alice Sheffer
became Herbert Vere Evatt’s for keeps on
Saturday evening at the Mosman Congrega-
tional Church. White satin aided and abetted
by georgette and seed pearls, a pearl and
diamond pendant, a bouquet of lilies
and white carnations, and a beautiful old
veil worn by the bridegroom’s mother at her
wedding, enveloped Mary Alice, who was
escorted by two bridesmaids and watched by
over a hundred invited guests—a small
United States in themselves. The wedding
cake was cut at the bride’s home on Brad-
ley’s Head, where mother did the honors in
champagne satin shimmering through gold
tissue and a handsome opal necklet, the gift
of her best boy, in honor of. the occasion.
The busy young counsel-at-law employs the
long vacation in taking his. bride to the
U.S.A. for the honeymoon.
This week, at St. Andrew’s Cathedral,
Canon Charlton ties the knot between
Esther Annie, second daughter of Mrs. Wil-
liam Thomas, of Centennial Park, and
Frederick William Allen, who comes from
Warwickshire. J. M. Hart gives the bride
away, and her sister Hannah attends her.
W. J. Wedlock supports the ’groom. Bride’s
sister (Mrs. J. M. Hart) extends the glad
hand at Petty’s Hotel. There’s to be a
honeymoon in Melbourne and Adelaide.
Nora MacDonogh, whose late dad was Dr.
Bernard MacDonogh, of the Richmond
River, became Mrs. James Andrew at St.
Philip’s in the sweltering heat of last mid-
week. Sister-in-law Kathleen Andrew was
the only bridesmaid ; the party was at the
Metropole.
T hat wonderful little needlecraft-woman,
Mrs. Ernest Favenc—inventor, besides, of the
knitting-needle shield, the “Yes-No” toy and
many other trifles—is in Ivirketon hospital
undergoing an operation. She and devoted
daughter Aimee have built themselves a
pretty home at Rushcutter’s Bay and named
it Delcomyn, one of the pen-names of
the late Ernest Favenc, explorer, writer and
fine fellow. Daughter Aimee studied under
Frank Mahony and Lister-Lister, and then
turned her artistic training to very profitable
use in designing patterns for embroideries and
so on.
Mrs. Waugh, of Parramatta, who is facing
towards England once again, is being loaded
up with the usual cargo of small parcels
pressed on the popular traveller by well-
meaning friends.
Mrs Hunt, who was Elizabeth Marks, is
staying with her sister, Mrs. Steer Bowker.
Her only daughter—a beauty, and that’s not
to be wondered at remembering mother’s
figure and father’s classic features—was
married in London just before Mrs. Hunt
returned to Sydney and family ties.
The travelled half of the Macarthur twin
arrives back in Sydney late in December
or early in January. Her return is causing
quite a flutter.
Mrs. Arthur Berrill, who in the long ago
was Clare McDermott, of the Shore, and
whose husband was connected for so long
with Gordon and Gotch, came back to her
native town by the Orontes, bringing daughter
Joan and son Adrian. England has claimed
the family for many years, and many a Syd-
ney soldier blessed the genial lady and her
home that helped to make his furlough a
thing of joy. Mrs. Berrill is staying with
Mrs. Sidney Raper, her sister, at Irrabee,
Neutral Bay.
One of the lasses who used to lend a hand
at the same canteen climbed into mamma’s
limousine to pay a call on a Coronet. The
Coronet was in evidence, but so remote that
the mere little Australian matron got a
crick in her neck trying to give it a friendly
coo-ee. She says she’ll stick to gum-leaves
and never look at a strawberry-leaf again.
Mining-engineer Arthur Moline, of Ben-
digo, who went off in the Ventura in con-
nection with the big Bendigo company’s
scheme to supply the decadent mining town
with some new industries, took his wife
with him: they expect to be away eight or
nine months. She was one of the Wallens,
of Melbourne; father was almost as well
known in literary circles as on the Stock
Exchange. He had three daughters, engi-
neer Moline had three sons, so a sort of
wholesale match was made of it.
Mrs. Elizabeth Norman has word that
her brother Frank McComas, who used" to
shake a brush in Sydney before he went to
San Francisco, has won the gold medal
of Pennsylvania for water-colors —the
first time that the medal has gone out of
its own State.. Frank is a nephew of C. E.
Davies, proprietor of the Hobart Mercury
and the Tasmanian Mail.
The Twilight Home, that kindly corner
of Mosman where elderly ladies rest their
tired hands waiting for their turn to slip
into the Night, with its long, sweet sleep,
is to benefit by a supper-dance at the Went-
worth early next week.
The Sid Macdonald benefit netted between
five and six hundred pounds. The Town Hall
was filled, and Sid in spite of sickness carried
out his share of the programme in great style.
Gladys Verona lifted a triumphant voice, and
the Parramatta Convent girls, who were done
out of their orchestral turn through the ex-
tending stage not being slid out, sat a heaped-
up mass of. white, crunched sweets and en-
joyed the night out immensely.
Redleaf, the W. H, Mackay home at
Double Bay, was washed in sunlight on
Saturday when the f6te in aid of St. Luke’s
brought out all Society like a flight of
butterflies. Sunshades, voile, muslin and
georgette in every shade the dyer’s art has
invented floated and , billowed about the
lawns. The stalls were under the shade of
the,verandahs, and here the Heads attended
to the more leisurely customers, while girls
witlv baskets heaped with fruits and dainty
trifles hawked their wares further afield.
Down below on Redleaf’s own stretch of
beach the youngsters had donkey races and
embarked on launch trips. The Cullen lady
(greeted with the National Anthem) en-
tered the scene under a blue sunshade as
gorgeous as the one Marie Tempest smiles
•under in “The Marriage of Kitty.” The
clever Rabett lady attended to the organis-
ing, and the eye-filling Mrs. Sep Levy helped
sales along in a peach of a rigout, mostly
pleated georgette and rose-pink, and a pair
of the youngest ankles present. Other suc-
cessful money-coiners were Mrs. Meares,
Mrs. Reggie Allen and Neddy and Bobs, the
donkeys. •
Up in the Catholic Women’s Association
rooms another fete was under way on Satur-
day afternoon to provide Christmas dinners
for the needy. Mrs. John Barlow in wine-
colored silk jersey cloth ; pretty Mrs. Coyle,
overtopped by two young daughters; and
Mayoress Fitzgerald helped the little venture
to success. Monsignor Moynagh gave it offi-
cial blessing, and lots of young R.C. curates
spent more than the Sunday’s collection on
useful objects like powder-puffs. Well, their
sisters and mothers have noses, haven’t they?
Fvei'y man who called into Paling’s on
Saturday morning to book theatre seats came
out with a tin or a box of sweets under his
aim, for little Mrs. Watson Holdship, who
sat in a stall inside the doorway, has an
X-ray’eye that seems to find those two half-
crowns in your vest pocket. The stall is
er , e e l ery Saturday morning in the interests
of the Sydney Hospital; and if you’re taking
the best girl out and doing her handsome,
you might just as well speed her on the
road to the dentist with the blessing of the
Hospital Auxiliary.
Frank Hutchens
goes to England in
search of the last
cry in music, and
gives an au revoir
recital on the third.
Frank is an enthu-
siast of the modern
school, and is con-
sta n 11 y giving to
Sydney audiences
some work it has
not heard before.
One of the city’s
most popular teach-
er s, Frank’s g i rl-
- gathered
around him last
Saturday and gave
him a farewell tea-party.
A cheque for £5BO came from the Bankers’
Ball in aid of Prince Alfred’s. Dixieland
saw a glad roystering one night last week
when the Hospital Auxiliary entertained the
members of the ball committee.
On Wednesday and Thursday of next week
Gladys Verona, with the big voice and the
brave heart, puts her claim for support
before Sydney audiences at the Conserva-
torium. The programme is made up of
scenes from opera, and Gladys is to be backed
up by Sydney’s best voices. Plan is at
Nicholson’s; and you’ll regret it if you miss
this chance of hearing Gladys dying as Gilda
Rigoletto.
In the comparative seclusion of St.
James’s Hall the Vagabonds walked the
boards on Saturday night to help a cot in
the Renwick Hospital. “The Irresistible
Marmaduke” went with a great swing, and
mightily pleased the tightly-packed audi-
ence. Clever Ruby Coxhead as Lady Althea
led her small band to victory—though
that’s not so hard when your small band
combines intelligence and good looks.
The furnishings of another old home have
gone to the hammer, this time because
“Pinkie” Greene, the owner, prefers to be an
absentee landlord. Little has been selling
off the landra goods and chattels, including
the wonderful dinner service of (roughly
speaking) a million pieces. It is a beautiful
thing and cost the family £l5OO in the ’way
back, and apparently it has never been
desecrated with mere fish or flesh. Angelica
Kauffmann is the name signed in the corner
of each piece, and Angelica did the painting
in beautiful tones of green and rose. Gods
and goddesses, Jflora and her train, Cupids,
and ladies strumming guitars under shady
trees disport themselves in an Italian atmo-
sphere. It’s the sort of thing the Decameron
week-enders might have feasted off. Then
there are about a dozen cups that when
looked into suggest the heart of a pink rose,
or the flush of dawn. They are so beautiful
they would look improper on any respectable
breakfast-table.
Kitty Reidy, the young Australian who
started life in Leichhardt and is making a
hit in “The Girl for the Boy,” scored her
first success when as a little girl she won
a gold medal at a competition at Grace
Bros. Then she carried away a three years’
Con. scholarship. Her latest success was
brought off when she replaced Lee White
for five nights in Melbourne and made a
distinct “go” of it, receiving six curtain calls
and a fat cheque from Mclntosh on the last
night of her lead.
Lady Brisbane’s postscript:—
The Musical Union concert was chiefly remark-
able for the fine performance of contralto Eunice
Cochrane. Like so many singers with rich voices,
Eunice is,only a handful, and her black georgette
frock made her look even less. But there was
nothing small about her gorgeous chest notes.
Our little Daphne Mayo, holder of the Wattle Day
Art Scholarship, is the first woman to be allowed
to enter the Royal Academy Art Schools as a
student. Her sculping excited the admiration
of Sir Thomas Brock and other R.A.’s, so Daphne
got her chance, and another Queensland girl is on
the high road to fame.
“Baby” Healion, a cousin of Mrs. Jack Fihelly,
was quietly married last week to Donald Wilson,
a Maryborough boy. Lilian Murphy, the Hon.
Peter’s handsome chick, was bridesmaid, and Austin
Lennon, M.C., son of the Lt.-Gov., produced the ring.
The ’moon is shining in Hobart.

Real Savings in Cash
by Oxy-Acetylene Welding.
STUDY these two examples of OXY-ACETYLENE
WELDING WORK, and realise what a power for
economy the Oxy-Acetylene Welding Process is
wherever there are broken tools or broken parts of machinery.
Times out of number/ after experienced engineers have shaken their heads over a
bad breakdown in machinery and almost committed the owner to a big outlay for
new parts, the Oxy-Acetylene Welder has made the parts as strong as new in quick
time, saving not only the cost of new sections but incalculable delay.
There is no repair job too small or too large that the Oxy-Acetylene Welder cannot
make the broken section as strong as new for a trifle compared with the cost of new
parts.
It joins perfectly and accurately Cast and Wrought Iron, Mild Steel, Brass, Copper, Gunmetal and
Aluminium. There are Oxy-Acetylene Welders all over the country ready for your work.
Engineers and Garages can make money with an Oxy-Acetylene Welding Outfit. Factories, Steel
Works, Foundries, etc., can save big money by having one on hand. Metal and Sheet Metal
Manufacturers can produce better articles at a fraction of the cost by using the Oxy-Acetylene
Welding Blowpipe.
Illustrated Booklet fully describing the work of the Oxy-Acetylene Welding
and Cutting Process will be mailed on request.

C.D.: Well, The Bulletin wants to restrain
Hughes because, for one thing, he is such a mischie-
vous little man. For example, he appointed a basic-
wage Commission because, at the time, he thought a
referendum would be carried giving the Common-
wealth power to apply the information. The refer-
endum wasn’t carried; but he let the Commission
go ahead all the same. Now when it flings in its
astounding report he says that, as it is in no
way binding, he won’t be bound by it. But he has
upset the beehive over Australia all the same
T. 0.1.: Quite right; Crick was expelled the N. S.
Wales Assembly, too Lertiop: Set out your own

fond of freaks G.S.C.: Thanks; but doesn’t make
any fresh point P.O’R.: Verse not up.... Wan-
derer: There is material there for a yarn. Try it
again Glass Houses: Thin and weak J.R.H.:
Old commonplaces stated with great unction
A. : When humor takes the form of an old man
falling over a dog and people eating dirty food it is
better reserved for offer to American picture film-
makers... .H.G.C.: “The Revellers” don’t revel;
they are merely reminded that they’ve got to die...
J.V.C.: Not up... .H.J.D.: Doesn’t make a yarn...
Peggy D.: Brightly enough written, but not enough

Nothing of value there X.: All been said better

you haven’t the first glimmer of an idea of how to

to break them in the right way... .R.L.8.: Far be
it from us to be harsh with the gentle thing:—
C.B.M.: To create a mystery and then merely
say “Whither away?” doesn’t make a thing worth
while. . . .A.S. (Balmain) : Verse won’t do. . . .A.N.R.:
Ideas far too crude and the verse has as many
lumps ap if it had been kicked by a hull-camel for
half an hour Mary A.: You seem to have got
the month of June mixed. Do you mean mid-
summer in Europe or midwinter here? All that
blossom part is an echo from English writers....
R. 0.8.: No Try: A dull sermon about a matter
you don’t really understand.... F. A. (Roseville) :
You can’t make verse with a saw by cutting
sentences and phrases into odd lengths... .Solo: You
backed yourself against a worm to see God; and
then you discovered Gonan Doyle. There’s some
humor there; wish it hung together better....
A.F.F-.: Not up by some distance... .P.R.L.: Violent
attempt at mirth has been swallowed by a gaping
basket T.8.D.: A thousand curses on the man
who puts his typewritten lines through a wool-
press before he sends them... .West Coaster: Thanks ;
but the subject seems pretty well exhausted T.
R. Horner : Can’t let you use news columns to reply
to advts. Rival corset-makers would have a great
time if they, could get in that way E.D.N.:
Swear it’s original?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A. 8.: Three stale jests tacked to three unripe
drawings.... T.W.: Promising; but some distance
from print-level... .F.D.M.: No hope.... R.L.E.:
A much-worn idea; and, anyhow, a drawing that
needs a score or so of explanatory tags will find no
place here... .R.W.: Just tripe... .G.L.P.: It’s not
a caricature; it’s a libel... .L.G.C.: We don’t ques-
tion the originality of the drawing; but what of the
joke ? E.C.: Feeble.... D.C.: Not good enough ;
but keep on. Mostly your people want better
heads N.E.M.: Hopeless T.F.: This is a re-
spectable family paper... .Gene: Rush them to a
hospital—apparently they’re all in horrible pain.
“Ajax” : Mention of the forceps left in a
lady’s inside at Adelaide (B. 11/11/’2O)
reminds me of a case that occurred at Perth
(W.A.). A woman died in hospital after
an abdominal operation, and her husband
sued the surgeon for damages. At the post-
mortem a large swab had been found in the
intestines, and the fact of its having been
sewn up and left to remain in the patient’s
innards was alleged to constitute negligence.
But the jury unanimously decided that there
was no negligence. Apparently the law allows
the surgeon to leave anything behind, so
long as he can show that he didn’t mean to
do it.
Lo ! Happy be the thought,
That with it brings
Pleasures of some old, old happenings;
To which we dearly cling.
Oft, when by distraction wrought
We hear soft voices sing.
Recalling brighter, pleasanter things;
Oh i how beautiful is remembering!
By this mankind is taught,
Time hath fast-fleeting wings;
God giveth youth to act in,
And golden age for pondering.
Sweet memories be held for naught.
If they possess but pleasur’d wing;
And teach not the acts that ring,
Of love and purity akin.

Workers All Use REXONA.
Round the Tram Sheds, the Workshops, on the Wharves and at the
Factories you will hear all the boys say: “Rexona is the best remedy in the
whole country. We all use it.”
All these healthy lads know what they are talking about. They live a
strenuous life, and always wish to be in fit condition; but bruises,
abrasions, cuts and hurts are bound to, come their way, in the natural
course of events, and it is when these occur that they prove the worth of
Rexona the Rapid Healer.
Rexona—Everyone’s Friend.
There are so many uses for Rexona that everyone is using: it now. One day it may
he found useful for the minor hurts, which are for ever occurring: in everyday life,
and another day it will prove invaluable for the more serious troubles, such as piles,
eczema and various forms of skin diseases. People in every class of life use Rexona,
from the highest to the lowest, and Rexona brings relief to
all; so get a 1/6 pot of Rexona to-day, and you will soon
find it so useful that it will not be long before you are
getting the larger pots holding nearly four times the
quantity, for 3/-.

Poppy Dreams.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHO brought these poppies to my
office-door?
Did they not know but fifty yards
away
Was the great canyon of the city’s roar
Filled with the myriad voices of to-day?
This was no time for sleep. Yet “Sleep ! ’
they said,
With dream-drops in their hearts, these pop-
pies red!
Green opium pipes these lucent stems must
mean,
Broad petals spreading from a cushion green,
With soft, black shadows where the curves
begin,
Where shaggy bees have dug their bodies in.
In slumbrous drifts of dream they lift and
sway,
And so the walls and roofings fade away,
While through the marble palaces of sleep
The naked footfalls of the Favorites creep,
The rustlings of crisp muslins and the click
A jewel makes. Oh, poppies, how you trick
The hours of toil! How amber cushions heap
On the silk divans that insist on sleep,
And cuddle in their purple stripes, to cheat
A wakeful moment, comfits drugged and
sweet,
In some chaste box of jade with golden clasp,
Now sliding from a languid finger’s grasp
And clattering on a shining floor! Behold
The parrot in his cage start up to scold,
And, pattering bare and black, with red
cymar
About his waist, and curving scimitar,
The tongueless Nubian peers, and rolls his
eyes
To see, perchance, if modest silence lies!
Deftly replaces there the box of jade—
For silks and sweetmeats are for women
made —
And so returns to watch, lest love should slip
The veil aside and find the lusting lip ;
While one tall, single poppy near her feet
Glows like her mouth, but never tastes so
sweet!
Suppose the Nubian should be lured away !
Suppose he, too, should sleep this drowsy
day,
And with his great lips open show how clung
The old red horror of a severed tongue,
Grinding his splendid teeth in dreams, to
prove
How he would guard the favorite from her
love,
Even while Love crept by with velvet tread
Past the closed jalousies,, the poppy red,
To gain a scented and more perfect flower,
And break with passion the siesta hour!
Aye, and suppose the Sultan in his lair
Grew restless, and returned to seek her there?
Oh, there are fortressed mountains in the
North
Where youth may hide. Old men are swift
to wrath.
But slow to follow. Aye, but should he find
A waking woman by the jealous blind,
And on the snow of her smooth shoulder see
The tiny bruise of Love’s last ecstasy?
Are old men unsuspicious? Who has kept
Watch o’er his treasure while the Nubian
slept?
Wond’ring, he might mix opium for her
drink
And proffer with caresses. She would think
He hid some special jewel in the draught.
(How he would gloat the while she sipped
and laughed!)
Then she would sink upon her couch and see
The poppy signalling from mystery,
And turn upon her side, her heavy head
Still banded, queen-like. And when she was
dead
A pyre would be built for her, that she
Might keep both secrets for eternity!
Some other favorite on the couch would be,
Some fresher poppy nodding drowsily,
Its shadow blurring in the polished floor,
Some other Nubian sentinel at the door;
New sugared dates within the box of jade
Close to the pointed hennaed fingers laid.
And then, perhaps, should the new jailer
sleep.
Some other lover up the steps might creep !
And this new favorite, wiser than the last,
Would mix the cup herself, or else would
fast.
Or, feigning an unselfishness in thirst,
Contrive her cheated lord should taste it
first!
(A band is drumming somewhere in the road.
The farmer’s carts go by ; a lucerne load
Gives rain-sweet odors to the pampered air.
Was that a callboy shouting for me there?
The poppy petals closer round me creep :
“Let others play the role —your part is
sleep !”)
Yellow of corn and far, faint lilac hills;
Yellow of corn and far-off sails of mills,
And deep green races where the grasses sway,
And, darting down, the white-throat swal-
lows play,
And cast a tiny shadow on the corn,
Where ripe and red the poppy buds are born.
With morning sunlight on her flaxen head
The farmer’s girl comes through the gold
and red,
And hears, too near, the bloodhound’s bell-
like bay—
They tracked her lover in the corn to-day.
’Twas here he turned for refuge in the wood,
That might have saved him. In her satin
snood
He set this poppy. If he could but gain
The forest lands —alas, that poppy stain.
It is as bright as blood on her bright hair!
Was the hand red that plucked and set it
there ?
Or was he innocent, maligned, betrayed?
The poppy gives no answer to the maid.
The millwheel turns, the swallows dart, the
stream
Purls on its way with many a weedy
gleam....
High prison walls that shout out love and
morn....
Some broken petals in a field of corn.
(The newsboys’ shouting punctuates the
hours.
Fade on my office floor the dying flowers,
And noisy in the traffic’s throaty swell
Comes the. insistent clanging of a bell.
Then a policeman’s whistle —how they keep
Life up all through my poppy-nodding sleep !
How they play on their stage, whose echo
brings
The chorus to me, dreaming in the wings! X
An altar in a chapel on a hill ;
Tall brasses and white candles burning still;
And on the grim austereness of the stair
A bunch of poppies that have fallen there;
Among the arum-lilies gay they lie,
As though mad carnival had galloped by,'
And dropped a mask, or ribbon of a cloak,
Troubling the holy water, when there broke
The chime of chapel bells through reel and
jest.
Too frail are they for God? Hay, let them
rest!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
O’Phelan’s Deluge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was hot —baking hot. The O’Phelan,
flushed and prone under the awning of
Ibanez’s cafe, felt the heat, even
through the haze of the night before and
the morning after. The rainy season was
over three weeks ago-—this oppression of
stagnant heat was most unusual and dis-
quieting. What was left of the O’Phelan
thought so, as it shifted restlessly in the
long cane chair. Ibanez came into the patio,
looked sadly at the prone figure and shook
his head on his way back to the kitchen,
lie had bad news for the senor Ingles- —news
which he must impart—he, Ibanez, who had
loved and guarded the caballcro from harm
for many years. It was easy enough to love
O’Phelan; it was not always so easy to
guard him from harm.
The padre from Holy Cross had called
on Ibanez that morning. Early in the year
the fathers had come to Bartolome; and the
people of the little South Argentine town
realised very soon that this was a very
different matter from the old, kindly rule of
Padre Pedro —God rest his soul! Holy
Mother Church in the persons of these grim
strangers had, it seemed, quietly pocketed
the town, spiritually and temporally. Rents
were henceforth paid to Holy Cross; dis-
putants had been referred by the Mayor to
Holy Cross; and certain hints in matters
of right-of-way and cultivation from Holy
Cross to the Mayor had been almost eagerly
acceded to. Certain hints also from Holy
Cross had summarily closed Senora Cortez’s
gambling-room, and had made it inexplic-
ably impossible for that excellent woman
either to renew her lease or to find a vacant
house in Bartolome, which was always half-
empty. And the padre had called on Juan
Ibanez that morning in the matter of the
O’Phelan.
The caballero was a disgrace, of course;
all the world knew that; but a long-estab-
lished disgrace—a disgrace softened by years
and custom, in the courteous Spanish eyes.
Briefly, he alternated between drunk and
sleep—only. This had been his 15 years’
habit, ever since Bartolom6 had known him.
No one expected anything else: no one ques-
tioned his right to this form of amusement;
and by degrees the O’Phelan wore down
the Spanish criticism, until no one was
shocked or even sorry, except Ibanez, who
had exclusive charge of the morning-after
interview — he was often very sorry. Now
Holy Cross, who had no illusions of estab-
lished custom and no bowels of mercy, had
blacklisted the senor. No drink could be
served him in Bartolome, either in glass
or in bottle; and Ibanez served drinks in
Bartolome —and Ibafiez only. And the
O’Phelan slept raucously in the patio in
ignorance qf this sad thing.
The O’Phelan to Bartolome was more than
a custom, and a loco Ingles. The small
estanciero of the province had the habit of
asking the Caballero's advice in the matter
of the rainy season’s first fall—which was
very important to the small estanciero.
O’Phelan’s predictions were always un-
cannily correct; and the farmers thought and
said that Senor Don O’Phelan was infal-
lible. A long list of 30 years’ South Argen-
tine weather records and a few intricate-look-
ing instruments on O’Phelan’s roof materi-
ally helped both the infallibility and the
atmosphere of uncanny powers. In effect,
O’Phelan was the weather prophet as well
as the drunk of Bartolome. His prophet
services were required only once a year;
when the rainy season closed the crops
basked in nine months of unbroken sun-
shine, three weeks of which had already
gone when the bad news came to Ibanez.
The prophecies would not be required for
eight or nine months now.
Ibanez came out into the patio again—
looked at O’Phelan, and sighed. The senor
was not well —was very far from well; it
was sad.... the gust of the innkeeper’s sor-
row woke the O’Phelan.
“Buen’ dia , senor,” said Ibanez.
“ Buen ’ dia, Juan. Some caha, please—
without water.”
Ibanez blanched. Standing rigidly up-
right he said, “I regret, senor, but I may
not serve you with wine or drink. My land-
lords say that my living in Bartolome de-
pends on my obeying their order; and I
know they will do all they say. I regret,
Senor Don Pat; I regret more than I can
say. But it is impossible.”
Ibanez spoke nervously—he was almost in
tears. He had spent the morning rehears-
ing the right method of breaking the news
to O’Phelan —had become word-perfect in a
most becoming and sorrowful oration appro-
priate to the occasion. But in the event
the bare statement of fact was all that he
could manage ; the thing was too terrible —
too hig for him.
Patrick O’Phelan stared at him; rose
slowly from his chair, which lurched and
creaked under him, and stared at Ibanez
again. He could not believe that he had
heard aright. Impossible to serve him —
impossible to serve!
“What is it, Juan? Am I still loco?”
“Behor, it is the truth. The padre from
Holy Cross told me this morning that never
must I serve you again, if I wish to keep
the cafe and earn my living.”
O’Phelan’s bloodshot eyes snapped in
sudden Irish anger.
“You talk like a fool, Ibafiez,” he said;
“bring me caha without water.”
“Behor, I cannot,” said Ibanez.
“You refuse to serve me with caha ?”

“Every Picture
Tells a Story"
a Painful Effort.
At all times of the year there are many odd jobs about the
home that every well man likes to do. But no man or
woman with a “bad back” enjoys doing anything. There’s
surely something wrong when every day brings morning
lameness, sharp pains when lifting, and a dull, tired state.
Likely it s kidney weakness. Don’t neglect it. It’s easily
corrected at first, but delay may encourage gravel, dropsy
or dangerous kidney disease. If your back aches and kid-
neys are disordered, get Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
This successful remedy is recommended so strongly by
people you know that you can use it with real confidence.
SYDNEY PROOF FOR SYDNEY PEOPLE.
PERMANENT RELIEF BY DOAN’S PILLS.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 9a Tebbutt Street, Leichhardt, Sydney,
says:—“Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered kidneys,
and as a result suffered agony from backache and rheumatic pains
all over my body. I was often so bad that I could hardly get about
the house, every movement giving me increased pain. My rest at
night was very disturbed, as it was impossible for me to lie in one
position for any length of time, owing to the nagging pain in my
back. My ankles and arms swelled a good deal, and were very painful
if I touched them. . I had no energy for anything, and was really far
from well. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me,
and after taking a course of these grand pills I was completely cured.
It is two years since I was cured, and I have had no return of kidney
trouble since.”
Eight years later Mrs. Osborne says“ Ten years have elapsed
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and I am still well, a
fact that speaks volumes for this splendid remedy.”
Mr. Walter Niddrie, Cowper Street, Harris Park, Parramatta,
says:—“l suffered terribly with my kidneys. The worst symptoms
were backache and rheumatism. Sometimes I would be doubled up
with the pain and unable to move. Hearing Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills very highly spoken of as a cure for all ills arising from disordered
kidneys, I decided to try them, so got some at once. They acted
splendidly, a few bottles banishing the backache and rheumatism
entirely, and giving me complete relief from pain. Previous to taking
these pills I would often sit down and it would be fully ten minutes
before I could get up again to a standing position. I was unable to
stoop to lace my boots in the morning, and my wife had to do it for
me. I am quite free of backache and rheumatism now, and I con-
sider that without Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills I would have had
to give up my billet.”
Nineteen years later Mr. Niddrie says:—“l have been free of
backache and rheumatism since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me nineteen years ago. I never suffer with my kidneys now, and am
in splendid health.”

“I must, senor,” said Ibanez.
“You definitely refuse?”
“It is my duty to my family,” said Ibanez
sorrowfully.
O’Phelan picked up his hat from the floor,
put it on his head and walked out into the
glare of the white plaza. He turned down
the wide straw brim to shade his angry
red eyes as he crossed the square to Walk
to his house; some whisky beckoned him
from there —not so potent as the beloved
cana, perhaps, but, still, something to a dry
man. No good trying to argue with Juan—-
he didn’t feel well enough to argue with a
brass monkey, anyway.
It certainly was poisonously hot and
heavy; it should be cool spring weather
now. Once only had he felt this ominous
heat after the rains had ceased ; nearly 20
years ago in Neuquen . ... the scatter d rags
of his faculties refused to come into focus
without a drink. He crossed to the shady
side; it seemed a long walk. The wide gate
of Holy Cross and the dark trees drooping
round it (in prayer, no doubt) looked almost
inviting; lie would have, called to ask for
wine—even wine—if his principles had
allowed. The fathers had bought or forced
out half the small farmers—soaked up their
mortgages and squeezed ’em until the poor
little devils had to go at last. The small
farmers were O’Phelan’s friends, the only
people left who believed in him—and Holy
Mother Church had collared their land and
crops. He couldn’t go there for wine—even
for wine.
He took off his hat in the shade and wiped
has brow—this heat was damnable. “Santa
Cruz ” —he read the inscription on the lintel.
A sentence of Ibanez’s stumbled into his
foggy memory of the late inexplicable inter-
view— el padre de Santa Cruz. This was
the house of the blacklisting priests—the
landgrabbers with- their praying trees at
their gate! Ilis brain and memory cleared
for a second as he felt again the appalling,
sticky heat. He smiled. Blacklisting, was
it?
Nine bottles were left of the dozen that
old Fernandez had sent for O’Phelan’s birth-
day gift—nine bottles of Irish whisky.
Where the old farmer had got them God
knew—Hod and the unfailing Spanish cour-
tesy, which had made them Irish instead of
Scotch for O’Phelan’s birthday. O’Phelan
asked God to bless Fernandez and his hard-
working politeness as he looked at the noble
nine.
A stiff drink, a long sigsta and another
stiff drink made the setting, copper-colored
sun look a little better; old Luneta’s inevit-
able good dinner made the lamplight and
the comfortable room look better; a last stiff
drink and a bath made the narrow camp-
bed and the fallen, velvet night, hot and
stifling as it was, look almost good. O’PJielan
sighed; it was a hard world. Blacklisted,
was it? He sighed again; and turned in.
In the night a thunder of drumming rain
smote the world, and for seven days and
nights the estancias and the crops were
swept and harried, beaten flat, and
scattered to the forty winds that blew
eternally in gale on gale. Bartolome
stood aghast. Here was a year’s labor gone
—gone as if no man had worked a day.
The few estancieros that were able to stand
upright out of doors gathered in Ibanez’s
cate asking anxiously for Senor O’Phelan.
Ibanez shook his head sadly—he had not
seen the senor for a week. Old Luneta at
the Caballero’s house shook her head—the
Caballero was away ; she knew no date for
his return. A deputation of farmers waited
on Holy Cross, which wrung its hands in
impotent despair—the bottom of tne world
was falling out for Holy Cross. Father
Abbot and young Padre Carlo from Buenos
Aires had taken to their beds. Nothing
could be done; it was tile will of God. ' This
unheard of second rain was a visitation of
penance for Bartolome; the sins of Barto-
lome were being washed out —in rain. Old
Fernandez mentioned O’Phelan’s name diffi-
dently ; Holy Cross stiffened; that matter
was in the hands of Padre Carlo, who was
regretably indisposed. Old Fernandez men-
tioned the name again, relating some slightly-
colored histories of bygone prophecies and
powers. Holy Cross raised horrified hands —
powers, indeed! Still, long experience and
expert watching of the dates, year after year
Holy Cross listened to Fernandez, who
said that if the Ingles could be found he
could perhaps given them some possible date
for the cessation of this awful thing. Holy
Cross asked a few questions ; gave Fernan-
dez full delegacy in the O’Phelan matter, and
bowed the deputation out into the terrify-
ing day; the rain still drummed its iron fin-
gertips upon a hollow, windy world.
After a little conversation with Juan
Ibanez, old Fernandez fought his way
through the screaming night to O’Phelan’s
house; another little conversation with
Luneta, who left him and returned, took him
to the sala and O’Phelan’s presence. Half
an hour later he went back to Holy Cross
and inquired for Padre Carlo. The brother
regretted, but the padre was ill —in bed, in
fact. Fernandez wrote a little note for the
padre and waited. Presently the young
gentleman from Buenos Aires came into the
hall, to the consternation of the lay brother
and the relief of Fernandez. Together they
went in silence through the roaring earth-
quake that was the night to the house of
O’Phelan.
To the O’Phelan enter these two. Per-
fectly sober, the Caballero sat in his sala ;
two unopened bottles stood on the table
before him, and beside his chair were seven
empty bottles.
“Buenas tardas, senores,” he said. *
“Buengs tardas, senor,” said the priest and
Fernandez as they sat down.
“I am sorry that on such a night I cannot
offer you refreshment other than water —or,
perhaps, coffee? These two bottles are all
that I have in the house- —in the world,
indeed—-and I fear they must remain un-
opened to-night. I hope my disability does
not appear inhospitable to you, Father?”
said the O’Phelan suavely to Holy Cross.
Holy Cross was equal to the occasion.
“Not at all, my son. No doubt you have
some good reason for this abstinence.”
Old Fernandez scored one for Holy Mother
Church. O’Phelan smiled.
“We will say, Father, that the seven on
the floor are the corollary of the two on the
table. Together they make the mystic nine.
Nine rivers, nine gods of Rome, and nine
waves of the sea—and now. nine bottles.”
Fernandez stopped scoring: they were out
of his depth. Holy Cross looked vaguely
polite. The rain tore the roof off the house
for the fourth time in a quarter of an hour.
"The mystic .Nine—you remember the nine
days' rain, Father ; or was it 40 days and
nights V Quien sabef It may have been
40 that time ; or it may have been only nine.
Qui‘:n sabe ... .quien sabef”
O’Phelan’s voice trailed away into infinite
fields of romantic conjecture—a mystery of
ineffable doubt and possibilities sang in his
far-away tones. The rain subsided to a
moaning banshee wail; a muttering whisper
of water eternally falling on water lisped in
the stricken garden. Old Luneta came in
with a startled expression
“Si, senor f”
“I didn’t call, Luneta ; it must have been
the voice of the waiting rain you heard. Do
not look afraid, Luneta; all is well— we, at
least, are safe.”
“I thought I heard the Caballero call from
the patio, as the cry of the rain ceased for a
moment.” Old Luneta looked troubled.
“No, Luneta ; it was still the cry of the
rain.”
The hissing in the patio's fountain-basin
grew less; an ominous, incredible calm
seemed to be falling. Fernandez stood up
suddenly, and walked to the verandah doors.
"Senores,” he said, “now by the grace of
God, I think it ceases.”
The padre lifted his troubled eyes in hope ;
O’Phelan’s voice still drooped in a mystic
minor.
“No, Senor Fernandez, it ceases not yet.”
He rose; resting one hand on the two
bottles, he closed his eyes (in hope).
“It waits—it waits only that I may have
silence while I speak.”
Fernandez smiled uncertainly; the young
man from Buneos Aires stared at O’Phelan
and the lamplight’s glow round the tall figure,
its white hair and tired face. If only he
would open his eyes!
“Long ago, in San Isidro, which is hard by
Neuquen, a great injustice was wrought upon
a benefactor of the village. The door of the
cafe was closed to him—closed without
reason.”
Fernandez smiled again—with more cer-
tainty. Holy Cross looked steadily at the
floor. O’Phelan spoke more rapidly (listen-
ing—listening), but still in a rapt, prophetic
manner, and with closed eyes.
“In San Isidro’s legend, the nine gods wept
in Paradise; and the nine rivers and the
nine waves of the sea brought the rain's back
when the rains had ceased—when the good
sun had been at work a month. When the
sin of San Isidro had been washed a week
(in rain, Father), the important men of the
village saw the error of their ways, and would
open again the cafe door to their poor bene-
factor.”
O’Phelan paused for a second and listened
anxiously. Yes; all was well —the drum-
ming murmur had begun again; he must
hurry, though.
“But their benefactor would not walk
through the door until the gods were ap-
peased ; only then could the rivers and the
waves roll back from their work. The rains
must fall until the door opened, of course;
but the punishment must be nine days at
least —one for ench god and each river and
each wave of the sea. On the tenth day the
sun shone again.’’
O’Phelan paused again. The murmuring
drone outside had increased in volume. In
Neuquen 20 years ago the storm had ceased
for half.an hour before a final 48 hours’
spurt. A long chance, he knew; still it was
the only one in sight. And- —black-listed —
black-listed after 15 years!
O’Phelan sat down and smiled at his
guests.
“I hope I have not wearied you with my
little history of a San Isidro legend, senores;
a man in ill-health gets strange fancies—
these nine bottles that .stood between me
and possible death seemed to typify again
the nine gods and rivers and waves. Per-
haps even the nine days of San Isidro’s
penance, too, in some unknown working of
Providence’s thought. The ways of God are
strange, Father.”
The rain wa.s beating the sodden world
again with the old cyclonic violence, wan-
tonly Hogging again its already dead enemy.
“You see, senates? The rain gave me my
little interlude of silence for my story; now
that I am done, it has come back—to make
us fulfil our penance, I suppose.”
Father Charles rose, and Fernandez fol-
lowed his example. Fernandez was leaving
the entire fight to the O’Phelan —he felt that
he could very safely do that.
"Hitenas noches, Senor Don O’Phelan,”
said Father Charles.
“Good night, gentlemen. I hope our sins
will he expiated in the nine days: this is too
terrible —too disastrous for us all, from the
great Santa Cruz to my small garden here.
Good-night—good-night.”
Black-listed, was it?
In the morning word went from Father
Abbot to Juan Ibanez, and later from Juan
Ibanez to O’Phelan by way of Fernandez.
The O’Phelan did not take advantage of the
lifted embargo. Beside.% the weather was
bad ; and in any case, he had his two bottles,
one for each day left of the nine. It would
look better if he held out—if only the luck
would hold, too, for the long chance of Neu-
quen repeating.
On the ninth day he saved the last bottle
until night fell. By self-denial of whose iron
strength Holy Cross and its fast days could
not even dream, the bottle was unopened at
dinner-time; was unopened at a bedtime
that was not observed —O’Phelan sat up.
At midnight the hammers on the roof of
the world seemed to grow tired; a sort of
order grew gradually into the pealing chaos.
Slowly—very slowly—-it faded to the whis-
pering hiss of the night before last; slowly
—very slowly—the patio and the roof and
the stricken garden grew quiet—fell into rest
—sighed, and slept at last.
Luneta came in.
“Si, senor f" '
“The. corkscrew, please; Luneta. I think
the storm has gone at last.”
“God be thanked for that, senor; it was
time.”
“It was indeed time, Luneta,” said the
O’Phelan.
