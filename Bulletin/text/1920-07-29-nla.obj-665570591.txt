Pathfinders and Selectors
In the jungle of literature, which is as
wide and'tangled as human, knowledge and
human experience, there are two distinct
sets of people who deserve all the honors we
can give them. The big estate of Milton,
with its magnificent buildings, its gardens
of flowers and fruit, its stately avenues of
cedars and its wide golden meadows, has
been a delight for two-and-a-lialf centuries.
The selection of Robert Burns, where every
hedge is full of wild roses and every bank
bright with red-tipped daisies, has been a
place of ploughing and good harvest for a
hundred years. Wordsworth took up broad
pasture-lands where the monotony of the
landscape is broken by an occasional valley
of great beauty. Along a hundred well-
trodden roads, some of them deeply-rutted
and dusty, there are countless gates opening
to such places as these; but the wayfarer
knows that the jungle was once supreme,
that there were no sure paths through
the Wilderness, that the rivers were un-
bridged, the sAvamps impassable, the moun-
tains a barrier to all progress. Men went
through and blazed a trail and sometimes
set up a hut and cleared an acre or two in
the remote interior; but the finding of the
path occupied most of their time and ex-
hausted most of their energies; and their
old homesteads, if they exist at all, have
little attraction for the traveller.
An early pathfinder was Henry Howard,
Earl of Surrey, who discovered blank verse.
There is not much to appeal to the literary
reader of to-day in the work he left behind ;
but tßhe road he found has been trodden by
a great army. His pioneering led to tre-
mendous results; for along Howard’s road
you will see some of the finest of Shaks-
peare’s land, the noblest part of Milton’s
estate; and you will touch upon the hold-
ings of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Tenny-
son and dozens of others. But Howard had
only a hut and an acre or two planted in
Latin translation ; and the fences all round
the little place are falling into decay.
Howard was one oi : the necessary pioneers
Avho prepared the way for Shakspeare.
Christopher Marlowe was another. Mar-
lowe took Howard’s blank verse and Avedded
it to the romantic drama. It seems an ordi-
nary enough thing to do now, but it was
a revolutionary thing then; for the classic
drama —Avhich never .developed into any-
thing Avorth while in the great days of the
English theatre —was supposed to have a
monopoly of Howard’s medium of expres-
sion. Marlowe Avrote one great play,
“EdAvard II.,” and finished a short and riot-
ous life by violence at the age of 29; but
he had found a path. Shakspeare came down
that way and took up a piece of country so
rich and magnificent that no empire on earth
can compare with it.
The whole story of literature is full of
similar instances of pathfinding and settle-
ment.- The modern loose measure, scanning
by beat instead of by quantity or accent,
found its way into English literature from
Ireland ; but it is not a Amry ancient Irish
product. Older Irish Averse, written betAveen
early Celtic times and the age of Shakspeare,
was in exact metres of infinitely compli-
cated rhyming and scansion. Mary Mac-
Leod, who Avas born in the Scottish High-
lands in 1569, altered all this. She dis-
covered the new mode of song, and it be-
came extremely popular because it made its
instant appeal to every hearer without
special technical training. Within a cen-
tury it had captured all Ireland and Western
Scotland ; and it has now gone far towards
capturing the English reader also. Yet
Mary, the inventor of the new and beautiful
thing, has no great place in any literature.
She Avas essentially one of the pathfinders
and not a possessor of the literary soil; for
in social standing she was only the superior
nurse in a chief’s family; and it may be that
her first ventures were little songs for the
ears of children.
The field of human emotion and endeavor
is so wide that the pathfinder is not yet out
of a job. Every note of striking originality
is in reality a blaze on one of the trees of
the jungle; but it often happens that none
except the man who first made them can
find those marks again. So there are a lot
of short tracks running down to a small
clearing and going no further; hut who can
tell what good land is over the ranges or to
Avhat Avide holdings some of the tracks of
to-day may lead?

The Judgment of Poetry
A point that is not infrequently lost in
reviews of modern poetry is that a very fine
general effect may be produced in a dozen,
twenty pr a hundred lines without one line
among them all being capable of standing by
itself as pure magic. A Wordsworth could
write five pages of verse that did not matter
and then .save the whole by one line of exqui-
site beauty; but a Byron never gave us a
jewel set in clay. Byron was a real poet
none the less. His work is rather a rich
tapestry of coarse threads, but magnificent
enough when seen in the mass. Older critics
dwelt much on the facility with which por-
tions of a poem could be quoted to give
point to speech or prose writing. That was
why Gray’s “Elegy in a Country Church-
yard” was considered so wonderful—almost
every stanza has the force of an epigram.
Gray was well enough, for there is fine move-
ment in his poem as well as rich sound ; but
the modern representatives of his method
are sorry people. Burns lends himself to
such quotation; Keats does not. Tennyson
and Browning are both in continual demand
for use or misuse in speech and article;
Shelley won’t work to any. extent in frag-
ments of comment on life. Elizabeth Barrett
Browning can be applied to for quotations
on everything, and so can Shakspeare and
Alexander Pope; but Milton, Swinburne
and Yeats are’no earthly use as an “Enquire
Within” for the young man in the debating
society. You cannot make an exact science
of poetry-weighing either by a selection of
magic lines or by gathering into heaps pithy
fragments of wisdom any more than you
can measure the great sonorous music of
one poet with the fine reed flutings of an-
other. “Their flaming robes streamed out
behind their heels” has a music of one qual-
ity ; “Oh, my love’s like a red, red rose” has
another; and “Dear as remembered kisses
after death” a third. Nor is there any sort
of exact balance to be struck in counting
the commonplace against the unusual.
Coventry Patmore’s child with his toys is
as commonplace as “Kubla. Khan” is fan-
tastic and strange; yet Patmore gets right
to the heart of the real stuff of poetry.
The fact is that the only guide to poetic
values is intellectual emotion. All the hands
of all the world impelled by that emotion in
greater or less degree are reaching out for
something. The wider poetic sympathy feels
that, and is continually handing down some-
thing that hangs high on the tree of exist-
ence. It may be only a black feather from
the wing of an angel of despair, but even
that is something; for by the arithmetic of
life two despairs make a glimmer of hope
and a dozen despairs join to form a note of
defiance of fate. The real attitude of appre-
ciation of song is one of gratitude. This man
has something for me—when you feel that
you are on very sure ground. But when he
pretends to hand you a king’s wine and you
find the cup empty you are on equally sure
ground if you feel a little irritation. Pro-
bably he doesn’t know that the cup is empty
and is very petulant when you tell him so,
but that can’t be helped. Once in a way, of
course, the wine may be too fine for your
palate; even then if you are quite honest-
which means, in the circumstances, quite
sympathetic—you will not judge the poet
wrongly, but merely admit that you are
puzzled. Once in a way also you will stay
puzzled. To be puzzled is a perfectly honest
attitude of mind.

How Much Is There in a Pintpot?
Social Economics, by J. H. Jones, Pro-
fessor of Economics at Leeds University, is
a good book because it is a survey and a
study, and not a piece of dogmatism and
special pleading. Though a Professor of
Economics Mr. ■ Jones confesses that “most
of the economic problems which are of real
importance remain to be solved.” Perhaps
most of the so-called problems are insoluble.
If one has an apple and desires to give
two people more than a half each, one had
better leave off regarding it as a problem
and settle down to the tftith that it can’t
be done. To regard it as a problem is not
only waste of time: it leads to disturbance
and the probable non-production of other
fruit.
After an impartial historical survey, Pro-
fessor Jones comes to his most important
chapter, “Economic Reorganisation.” This
is full of thought. The outstanding feature
of industrial life is the struggle of the wage-
earner to secure a larger control, if not the
entire control, of industry. Exactly what
the reformer wants is not, however, clear.
The author states the position quite fairly :
Education has made some of them more keenly
sensitive to the relationship implied, or believed to
be implied, in the wage contract. They regard
themselves not as equal parties to a contract, but,
by virtue of the discipline imposed upon them in
the factory by the employer, as in a position of
subordination. Hence the growing use of question-
begging epithets such as “wage slavery,” “capitalistic
domination” apd the like.
So they or some of them want the abolition
of the competitive system. Or they want to
“democratise industry.” Meantime, believ-
ing that “parasites” take an enormous pro-
portion of what the workers produce, they
go-slow on the job, either by loafing in work-
ing hours or by reducing the hours of labor,
while using their power to maintain the rate
of wages.
• Rate of wages, however, matters very
little. A leader of the English socialist
party, returning lately from Russia, re-
ported that one actor was getting there
£20,000 a week in the local paper money;
and, she added significantly, “as much food
as he requires.” “What is required,” says
Professor Jones, “is not merely a rise in
wages, but a rise in the standard of living.”
The two may, no doubt, go together. That
is to say, if somebody has been taking what
the worker produces and the worker gets it
from him, his wages will thus increase, yet
the cost of living may not increase. But
if the worker merely reduces production,
then cost of living must increase, and his
increased wages are of no value to him. It
is not merely that he does less himself: the
capital in the business, represented by
plant, etc., is also earning less than it might.
This economist lays particular stress upon
the waste of capital. He sees salvation in
two things: “Efficient production on the
one hand, and on the other the reduction of
expenditure upon useless things. .. .The sub-
stitution of thrift for extravagance would
result in an increase‘of capital and a fall
in*the rate of interest.”
On the question of nationalisation Prof.
Jones makes some thoughtful observations:
Efficient organisation implies diversity rather than
uniformity of methods of production. When a plant
has once been erected it must be allowed to run for
a time without serious interference. If the machinery
were scrapped every time a new method was dis-
covered it would always be in the hands of con-
structional engineers, never employed in manufactur-
ing the goods which it was intended to produce.
Every little while there is an outcry that
such-and-such a mine or manufacturing con-
cern is paying outrageous dividends. That
it is doing this is regarded as proof posi-
tive that the public is being fleeced. There
is another way of looking at it. Probably
it has just got in new plant, or has other-
wise reorganised itself, and is for the moment
ahead of its competitors. But the mere fact
of the high return will drive competitors
after it; and the public will then benefit by
the improved methods of production becom-
ing general. This is a point that has to
be kept in mix\d by any Government which
contemplates a tax on dividends exceeding,
say, 8 or 10 p.c. on capital. It might even
be a good thing to offer a bonus to a concern
which, under certain conditions, could pay
20 p.c. in competition with others.
To return for a moment to the “wage-
slave.” Prof. Jones discusses various plans
for giving the worker a share in manage-
ment ; but he points out that already, especi-
ally ’ through his unions, the worker has a
very large share; and in Australia, with its

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Grace of Day.
To those who toss upon their beds
And dream, distressed, forlorn,
With weary limbs and ailing heads,
How glorious is the morn!
To them, denied the blissful dreams
That come with quiet sleep,
How wonderful are those first gleams
That through the windows creep!
A hope within their hearts lights up,
Forgotten are their pains;
As though they drained a magic cup
Life ruddies through their veins.
“Arise!” a something seems to say —
“New wonder draws to birth ;
Fare forth and greet the grace of day
That flows from God to earth.
“The night has gone, the dark has ceased,
The world new splendor wins,
And all along the kindling East
The golden hour begins!”

VICTORIA.
What is he caging
Ere it be flown,
This poet, waging
Strange wars alone?
His moods swift flying,
Like rainbows dying
When storms are crying
And flowers prone.
Moods ever changing,
Like shadows thrown
By great clouds ranging
The planet-strown
Far, silvery spaces
Where fancy traces
Visions and graces
Unseen, unknown.
Rising and falling,.
Like echoes blown
From clear bells calling
Through aery zone,
Spilling their pleasure,
Sweet, liquid treasure,
In lavish measure
For all to own.
Moods sweet as grasses
All blossom sown,
Where glittering passes,
From throne to throne,
The bee, whose coming
Is cried with humming,
With faery drumming
And elfin drone.
This is his battle:
To shape and tone
The words we rattle.
Till laugh and moan
Dwell in their ringing;
So toils he, bringing
To us sweet singing—
A sorcerer’s loan.

Autumn Night.
Is it moon, or mist in the trees?
Something airy and delicate,
Spraying the branches with silver spate,
Never quite rain, but a pattering mist,
As though lost moons with the dewdrops kist
And wept at a sundered fate!
The shadow of some night-bird
Over the wild, wet grasses goes
To mix with the blur that the gum-bough
throws,
Hiding your slim, arrested feet.
Your hands are cold —let me hold them,
sweet!'
But your mouth is like a rose.
Stars are dreaming behind the cloud,
Pools of shadow are rimmed with grey;
The moon has powdered the world her way,
And her way is magic! Her slaves to hold
She makes her silvers more line than gold,
Though her wand be but a ray.
Is it moon or mist in the trees?
Frail ghosts of twigs in a pattern meet
Fleck you from breast to your shadowed
feet;
The light slips through where the gum-leaves
fail,
Till you seem a woman within a veil.
Break through for my wooing, sweet!
Are your hands cold? How your quick heart
beats!
Whisper the word, though none other hears.
Your laughter trembles against my tears.
Was it moon, or mist? Was it rain, or dew?
Is it an hour we have kissed through— ’
Or, maybe, a million years?

I’ve owned my house well nigh a year,
But no one ever sees it quite,
Although its windows bright and clear
Unbare their brilliance half the night.
On either side its neighbors grand
Lean heavy shoulders on the eaves.
Its little legs can hardly stand
Within the shade their grandeur leaves.
Its tiny hat is not quite straight,
And so the rain. comes leaking in.
Its little suit is out of date,.
And, oh ! its little coat is thin.
And so my house is glad to hide,
And thank its neighbors for their size;
Yet no one ever sees inside
The mind behind its shining eyes.

PROTECTION FOR PRIME
MINISTERS, PRELATES, &c.
Australia borrowed its federal system of
government from the U.S.A. and is sorry
that it did. After 20 years of experimenta-
tion. its Labor party, which will probably
be in power in 1922 if not sooner, wants to
scrap the paraphernalia in favor of a unit-
ary system, and its- National party (still
federalist in a negative sort of way) de-
clares that the Federal authority can’t func-
tion properly without large grants of power
from the States. And men of all shades of
opinion agree that the Senate has worked
out to a joke. In the nature of things,
nominee and elective Legislative Councils
can’t last much longer, but not even Vic-
toria’s House of Landlords is more clearly
doomed to either destruction or radical
change than the Senate. In its own primi-
tive fashion, even the House of Landlords
represents something, but the Senate repre-
sents nothing—except the vested interests
of 36 party hacks. With the 1920 Senate
in its mind’s eye—there are 35 members on
one side of the House and one on the other,
although that one expresses the views of
about three-sevenths of the electors —Aus-
tralia is apt to question the political wisdom
of the country that got the Senate habit first.
And it isn’t at all favorably impressed with
what it has read about Presidential pre-
selections. And, having had five years of
Hughes and his War Precautions Act, it
would never surrender to its Prime Minister
or Governor-General the vast powers vested
in the American President, who is King,
Prime Minister, Admiral of the Fleet and
Commander-in-Chief of the Army combined.
But in the impending revision of a system
that has become unworkable, there is one
feature of the American Constitution that
could be usefully incorporated in our own,
and that is the provision that the Union’s
first citizen must be a native of the country.
* * * *
The U.S.A. Constitution enacts that “no
person except a natural-born citizen of the
United States shall be eligible to the office
of President.” It is a wise provision, and if
Australia had made it part and parcel of
its Constitution as regards its Prime Min-
ister, instead of copying other Americanisms
wholly unsuited to these latitudes, this country
would have escaped a lot of trouble. It may
be true that American Presidents have rarely
risen above mediocrity. Admittedly the Pre-
sident sometimes gets his job because a fac-
tional row within his party prevented the
nomination of a superior man. But what-
ever his personal deficiencies, he is a native-
born American saturated with the American
spirit, and that counts for a great deal. Not
being a Pole he isn’t hag-ridden with the
wrongs of Poland. . Not being a Serb or
a Czecho-Slovak he is never tempted to in-
volve the Americans in arguments about
Northern or Southern Slavs. Being neither
a green Irishman nor a yellow Irishman he
doesn’t grow maudlin to the point of dan-
ger about the walls of Derry or the sally-
ports of Limerick. And as he isn’t English,
or Scotch, or Welsh, he can survey the
adventures of British Imperialism with the
cold detachment of a spectator. In all inter-
national questions he looks at things from
the U.S.A. standpoint and puts the U.S.A.
first, and that i.s what the naturalised
American finds it impossible to do.
It is what our imported Prime Ministers
find it impossible to do as regards this coun-
try. By virtue, of their foreign birth, they
haven’t the feeling for Australia that those
who were born in it have. They view the
problems of Australia and its relations with
the Old'World through alien spectacles. They
can’t enter into .the Australian national
spirit, and are inclined to resent it. Con-
sciously or unconsciously they have a bias
in favor of the country they came from, and
■from this natural prepossession comes a
habit of regarding Australia as merely an
appanage of that country, and as a suitable
place for the extension of bitter Old-World
political and sectarian controversies, which
habit is wholly injurious to Australia.
* * * *
, During the war the Commonwealth had
three Prime Ministers, all imported. Look-
ing back over that .stormy period no one can
doubt that it would have been better for all
concerned had the head of the Government
been an Australian. The violence of faction
that exhibited itself in the third year of the
war might have been averted, or at least
abated, had the Prime Minister belonged to
the native-born. Australia might have
accepted conscription from a Deakin or a
Forrest, but even loyal conscriptionists felt
disgusted at the spectacle of a truculent im-
portation rushing Australian boys into camp
before conscription became law, and demand-
ing a flesh-and-blood tribute on a scale that
would have rapidly exhausted the manhood
of Australia. And at a time when it ought
to be absorbed in its own affairs, which are
urgently in need of attention, this country,
thanks Jo its habit of importing its leaders
of public opinion, is suffering from a plague
of racial and religious animosities, all im-
ported. The last two Federal elections were
largely fought around the old quarrel of
England and Ireland. The passionate feud
between the imported Hughes and the im-
ported Mannix still engages the nation’s
attention, to the exclusion of more signifi-
cant topics; and each talks as if Australia
was backing his side of the controversy.
When the freedom of New York is conferred
upon the imported archbishop, not because
be is an Australian citizen, but because he
is an Irish Sinn Feiner and a bitter enemy
of England, he returns thanks “in the name
of the Australian people”—thousands of
whom would dearly love to deport him—and
mentions that sfnce he came to Australia
Ireland has never been absent from his
thoughts. When the Australian Government
is attacked on the score of its admin-
istration of Australian affairs, the Prime
Minister regales the country for the
thousandth time with his views on
Irish politics and, also “in the name of
the Australian people,” repudiates De
Valera and all his tribe. Australia can’t
afford this intense absorption in the troubles
of Ireland; it has troubles enough of its
own. It is getting too much Irish politics
and too much English politics, and is taking
too much notice of fluent personages who
are obsessed that way. Neither the English
nor the Irish get excited about Australian
politics, nor would they deserve much re-
spect if they did. It is up to Australia to
take an intelligent interest in its own
politics and give Irish politics and English
politics a rest. What Australia needs is a
breed of public men who will think of Aus-
tralia first and put it first—before Ireland,
England, Czecho-Slovakia or any other
country. One way of getting public men
who will be Australians in spirit and action
and not mischievous exiles brooding over
the wrongs or saturated with the prejudices
of other countries is to provide in the Con-
stitution that the Prime Minister must be
a natural-born Australian. And it would
do no harm to extend the principle to
bishops and union secretaries.
REPUDIATION DAY.
The Queensland Government struck a sort
of baby Waterloo in London when its appli-
cation for a £9,000,000 loan was refused;
but by a special dispensation of Providence
the case wasn’t nearly so bad as it might
have been. If the rejected appeal had been
for money with which to repay a debt falling
due, the result would have been almost cer-
tain bankruptcy, unless the Federal Govern-
ment had come to the rescue and taken as
security the sole right to collect certain
State taxes. And even the Federal Gov-
ernment might have found it hard enough to
scrape up £9,000,000 in gold for such a pur-
pose. Almost as certainly as the sunrise no
one else in Australia would have taken the
chance, even if money was available; and the
appeal of a turned-down borrower to the
United States—the only other lender these
times —would have been far from hopeful
even at the fancy rates which a prospective
insolvent is willing to promise. By extraor-
dinary good luclc, however, the five-years’
life of the most unfinancial Government in
Australia has been free of renewal loans.
Nothing has fallen due to give the British
lender a chance to express in the fullest way
his frank opinion of Ryan and Theodore
and their allies. One of the last acts of the
Denham Ministry was to renew at 44 per
cent, a lamentable old lOU for £11,728,800,
and the new crowd started with nothing to
pay till 1922. It was the only State with
such amazing good fortune. N. S. Wales
had about £29,000,000 falling due in the
same space ; Victoria had £21,000,000 ; South
Aus. about £10,000,000 ; even Tasmania about
£2,000,000. The price of renewal hit them
all hard. Westralia. the other undeserving
case, had less than £BOO,OOO to struggle with.
But for this weird streak of fortune the
finance of the Ryan-Theodore combine
would have dragged it or the State down
before this. But it is up against a liability
of £2,399,750 in 1922; £12,973,834 in 1924;
and £11,728,800 in 1926. And unless rain
falls to make new verdure in the loan market,
or unless Queensland finds a very different
sort of Government and does so very soon,
the first State insolvency in Australasia is
fixed for one of these dates, or earlier.
* * * *
A number of elements went to make up
the situation which Theodore met when
he went to the worst market on record to
demand the biggest single Australian loan on
record in proportion to population, and
almost the biggest on record without any
regard to population. The position was one
which only a politician without a shred of
imagination would have faced. To begin
with, there is the marked objection of
Queenslanders to invest in their own bonds;
and this may mean poverty, which is bad
for the creditor, or lack of faith in their own
honesty, which is worse. At June, 1918,
* this was how the debtscape looked :

Victoria has further improved its position
since 1918, while Queensland hasn’t. And
even the handful of Queensland securities
that are held in Australia are mostly in
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. Premier
Theodore’s State is the only one which
could repudiate or default on its debt with
practically no direct loss to its own citi-
zens. It owes more in England than any of
its neighbors, spendthrift N. S. Wales alone
excepted ; and probably J. Bull is tired
and suspicious as well, for the preparations
for a possible collapse on the safest prin-
ciples look too elaborate. And the present
Government has done at least two acts
which look to the British people interested
sufficiently like a breach of faith to be
called by that name for lack of a better.
It passed a law authorising a practically
unlimited increase of the rents of pastoral
lessees who had gone into the business on
the basis of periodical, limited and well-
defined maximum increases. And by an-
other law it authorised itself to purchase the
Brisbane Tramway Co.’s property at a
valuation, and further gave itself power not
in the original contract, which power it
Promptly used, to reduce fares, and thus
diminish the valuation. The British people
who owned all the tramway stock and a
good many of the pastoral leases grew wild
on both counts, and alleged that a Cabinet
which worked small swindles would do big
ones if it dared. So the signature of
Bananaland on any sort of document begins
to be looked at askance. And notoriously
the Ryan-Tiieodore combination has had
the support of the class which hates Eng-
land not merely as a creditor but on prin-
ciple, and of the class which talks repudia-
tion.
* * * .
In. any case the financial situation is
sufficient to scare away any lender except
the kind that takes all manner of gusty
chances and charges 25 per cent, or so for
doing it. Five years ago the Queensland
railways paid the whole interest on their
part (the biggest part) of the State debt
and a little over. By last year they were
brought to a point at which they paid prac-
tically nothing. Other Government enter-
prises are at the same point. This
means that the public creditor depends on
taxation for his interest, and there is very
little tax margin left. In the last complete
year of the Denham Cabinet direct taxa-
tion by the State Government was £1 Bs.
2d. per head. When Ryan began his wild
jamboree at Brisbane it went up to £2 2s.
9d.. then to £2 6s. 9di, then to £2 12s. 2d.,'
and then to £4 Os. 9d. When the just -com-
pleted .year s accounts are fully overhauled
it will be found that the exaction has gone
to about £6 15s. per inhabitant in State im-
posts alone. That is much more than twice
the load carried by the next most heavily-
looted State, and more than four times that
of the least-looted one. Whether the Min-
istry is simply lacking in the business capa-
city expected of a junior office-boy, or
whether it is following out a fully-planned
system of gigantic corruption, or whether it
is both combined, nobody is likely to lend
it £9,000,000 on the off-chance that it may
squeeze another £1 or so per head out of
the burdened people to pay interest with.
When the burden becomes unbearable will
be the time for pointing out to an enervated
and corrupted people that there are two
alternatives in view—(1) reform and a
return to the unaccustomed dreariness of
hard work, or (2) the saving of about £4
per inhabitant per annum (nearly two-
thirds of the tax-load) by telling the public
creditor to whistle for his lost money. Every
addition to the burden of muddle and dis-
aster must oring more recruits to the re-
pudiation idea. When the interest that goes
out as bait for new loans ceases definitely
to catch any fish, there will be nothing save
high principle and spotless morality to pre-
vent the scheme being tried ; and high prin-
ciple and spotless morality are not the most
conspicuous things in the recent government
of Queensland.
THE REAL AUSTRALIA.
Austbalia is offered the chance to become
one of the greatest of countries in the best
sense of the phrase. The beginning of the
era of world-reconstruction finds it with
most things in its favor, and only one serious
handicap—a large body of people who are
not Australians at all. A member of the
N. S. Wales Ministry mentioned the other
day that his Government was opposed to
immigration “so long as there was land-
hunger.” This is the voice of the short-
sighted unionist. Everyone knows the type.
He has a theory that there is only a given
amount of work in the community, and
that the way to make it go round is to limit
the size of the labor battalions. Nominally
he only wants cheap labor kept out; in
reality he distrusts every sort of immigrant,
and sees an active grievance in the immi-
grant who is a skilled worker in the same
trade as himself. He is a Freetrader as
regards every industry but one—his own.
A similar type roosts at the other end of
the industrial perch. The get-rich-quick
capitalist, who before the war was fre-
quently a German and often now is con-
nected with an overseas company, considers
every proposition in terms of immediate
profit. It is this class which has always
been assiduous in spreading the doctrine that
the Northern Territory is no place for white
men, the aim being to get it stocked with
Asiatic coolies. Its members advocate the
unrestricted admission of every sort of
worker, and the cheaper the better. The
bad unionist and the bad capitalist are the
natural allies, however revolting the idea
may appear to them, of the Inter-
nationalists. For all three sections —the
first two more or less unconsciously, the
last deliberately—are anti-State. They
are logical Sinn Feiners: they try to mind
their own business to the exclusion of the
business of everybody else, whether the lat-
ter happen to be trade rivals or the nation.
The real Australian—the sort, that is,
who envisages his country as something no
less spiritual than material, a subject for
patriotic pride as well as an object from
which wealth may be torn —advances on such
problems from a different angle. A visiting
American Judge remarked in Sydney last
week that his country was “tired of being
the poorhouse of Europe”; and he implied
that Australia would be well advised to take
warning from the example provided by the
United States. But Australia doesn’t need
to be told about America: representatives of
nearly every family in this continent have
seen Europe. About quarter of a million
of our young men have lived in Belgium.
They have studied the unfortunate people of
that country—a blend of every race that has
occupied it; in many cases hating the British
on the one hand and the Germans on the
other; speaking variously French or German
or a bastard tongue which is neither —and
they do not want the Australian people to
become like them. They have seen Southern
Europe with its leaven of the blood of
Northern Africa; and some of them got as
far north as the Rhine, where Senegalese
troops were in occupation, and even Russia,
which they found semi-Mongol. A steadily-
improving transport system has ruined much
of Europe, racially speaking, and is threaten-
ing the rest of it. A century ago the war-
time cry “Ghurkas to Potsdam!” would have
been the threat of a lunatic: after the Armis-
tice it was cheaper for France to send black
troops from French colonies to Cologne than
white poilus. Asiatics of all descriptions
toiled on the roads in every back area in
Flanders, and nothing but the shortage of
Channel steamers saved English agriculture
from them. Europe was foredoomed, sooner
or later, to miscegenation on the day the
steam-engine was invented: the world war
has merely hastened the tragedy. The
U.S.A. did not give the question serious
thought till it was too late. There is only
one white man’s country which has a reason-
able hope of remaining white; and that is
our own. The race is still pure, and as we
have no land frontiers it can be kept pure.
The genuine Australian doesn’t put this
question on a business basis. If he were
only concerned to develop the country, and
more particularly its primary industries,
he would welcome every available worker,
white, black, brown, yellow or piebald.
As it is, he wants only whites, and sound
whites at that; and there he part's company
with the mean capitalists. If, as an em-
ployer, he was only ambitious to develop
a particular industry, he would be satis-
fied with the handful of immigrants
requisite. for that industry ; but as his aim
is to see all Australia developed, he wants
as many desirable immigrants as the over-
seas countries —and preferably Britain —
can supply. And this is where he parts
company with the others who argue that
newcomers to the Commonwealth can, only
be absorbed on the land.
• # * *
The Australian is not a Freetrader. He
knows all about the bargains in the way of
dirt-cheap goods that the outside world
yearns to shower upon his country. He is
aware that America’s Webb-Pomerene Act
was designed expressly to give nations like
Australia advantages which are denied to
the consumers of the U.S.A. —that is,
if dumped goods amount to advantages.
He knows that Japanese are toiling 12
hours a day, on seven days a week, for sd.
a day, that he may have the blessings of
matches that don’t strike and socks that
fall to pieces. But he regards all such offer-
ings as the wary ancients did the gifts of
Greece. And here he parts company with
that vociferous school which talks largely
about loyalty to the Empire and patriotism
in general, yet, with the balance of world-
power shifting to the Pacific, tells Austra-
lia that it need do no more productively
than it has done in the past—that it can
attract all the population it needs and pay
its defence bill by exporting greasy wool
and bagged wheat. The Australian —the
true Australian —has pretty generally come
to the conclusion that, the economic side of
the question apart, it is time he started to
manufacture all his own heeds. The late
war did not see an actual break in the
Empire’s sea lines of communication; but
they sustained some nasty shocks, and such


eminent authorities as the late Admiral
Fisher have laid it down that when the
next sea-conflict comes the submarine will
probably be next door to unstoppable. The
road to national safety, which includes racial
purity, is evident in the circumstances. Aus-
tralia will need to aim at complete indepen-
dence of the outside world, and reach its goal
within a reasonably brief space of time.
There will always be people to point out that
every fresh step in this direction amounts to
lunacy; just as Sydney Telegraph talked
last week of “the impracticability of this
ambitious proposal” in reference to the Fed-
eral Science and Industry Bureau’s scheme
for turning the local wool-clip into textiles
on the spot. Yet the fact remains that we
have every manufacturing requisite—coal,
iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin. timber, leather;
while Australians are, at the worst, no less
intelligent than (say) the Japanese, who
only emerged from Feudalism 50 years ago.
The Interstate Commission found in 1916
that iron and steel imports valued at
£8,396,200 could have been produced in Aus-
tralia, to make no mention of goods worth
nearly as much again which are dependent
on iron and steel as raw materials. Until
the Commonwealth has stopped most of the
leakage in wealth and man-power which
that particular situation represents, it will
not be able to make its own war-material.
In the late war the United Kingdom sup-
plied us with every weapon, except a few
small arms, and every means of transport,
except some G.-S. waggons for Egypt; with
all our aircraft and with all our ammuni-
tion. The real Australian blushes at the
possibility of this occurring in another war.
And he shudders at the reflection that it
may be impossible for it to occur, owing to
the next war being on Australian soil, and
under world conditions widely different from
those of 1914.' The safety of the Common-
wealth cannot be won in a leisurely manner
from the land alone. It is a matter of great
industries, of white men to operate them,
and of a certain measure of industrial peace.
Broadly, who sees that is the real Austra-
lian. Who doesn’t isn’t.
MAY DAY IN PARIS.
Trite European May Day is, I suppose, the
equivalent of our Eight Hours’ Day. But
whereas in Australia Eight Hours’ Day is
a national picnic—a day of . gaiety, banners
and general self-congratulation—May Day
in Paris is a sort of automatically-recurring
Eve of St. Bartholomew. Yesterday, on
May Day morning, I walked through the
streets, and they were full of bayonets.
Soldiers were guarding all the strategic
points, and the usual Army juggernauts,
crammed with soldiers and policemen, were
thundering up and down the boulevards.
Ambulances and military dressing-stations
were ready for expected victims, and behind
the iron gratings of fortress-like public
buildings I could see more soldiers in full
marching-kit. House roofs had been con-
verted into machine-gun nests, and the un-
sectarian civilian walked tiptoe along-
deserted streets or scattered out of the way
of cavalry patrols.
Long before the Ist of May one could
sense the approach of tragedy. A silent war
was fought upon the walls of Marseilles,
Lyons and Paris. Iled-paper notices pro-
claimed the solidarity of Labor and exhorted
the proletariat to stop all work on May Day.
Counter-proclamations of the Government
foretold the country’s downfall if the festival
were kept. The 125 daily journals of
Paris, representing every tone and half-tone
of opinion, wept, cajoled, threatened and ex-
horted by turns. Unsigned placards de-
manding revolution and a Soviet government
were posted on top of the official notices.
This paper warfare raged till May Day,
when the thunders of' the press unsympa-
thetic to Labor were unavoidably suspended
by the absence of their staffs, and only a
couple of Socialist journals appeared on the
streets.
A waiter told me with a deprecating shrug
that this day last year 500 people were
killed in Paris. My hotelkeeper told me not
to approach crowds and to avoid the
boulevards like the plague. Everywhere
people talked about the day as some-
thing awesome and inevitable. This
blind panic of the bourgeoisie has in
it all the qualitv of animal unreason.
It is the startled instinct for self-
preservation making itself felt, and it is
world-wide in its manifestations. It is the
same instinct that prompted in America
the extraordinary measures to repress May
Day disorders which never eventuated and
assassinations which were never contem-
plated. Much of the anti-Bolshevist propa-
ganda is now seen to be the disordered pro-
duction of instinctive fear. In Florence dur-
ing a perfectly orderly general strike a mild-
mannered old lady told me the Government
ought to use flame-throwers to make the
men go back to work. All over Europe
machine-guns are becoming a recognised
argument in industrial disputes. Nobody
asks whether they are a good or a final argu-
ment. It is as though established society
in Continental Europe felt the wall against
its shoulder-blades, and, maddened by that
fearsome touch, had thrown all sense and
prudence to the winds and was filled only
with a passion to sell its life as dearly as it
might.
To an Australian, the most curious aspect
of the whole affair is the pathetic obstinacy
with which Governments refuse official recog-
nition of the Labor holiday. To officialdom
the celebrants are strikers. It struggles to
maintain its various services in the face of
overwhelming opposition. It tries to break
the so-called strike by means of student
blacklegs. It exasperates the people by pro-
hibiting the processions and meetings which
would serve as safety-valves for pent-up
passions.
On May Day afternoon all Paris wended
its way to the Place de la Republique. It
was a well-dressed crowd, looking absurdly
out of place because its cafes were closed
and it had to wander up and down the boule-
vards like a crowd of would-be holiday-
makers in a Sydney street on the Sabbath.
Men were selling little sprigs of scarlet
geranium, which some of the crowd wore in
their buttonholes as the emblem of revolu-
tion. Others were selling white lilies-of-the-
valley, as the symbol. I presume, of the
counter-revolution. The big hotels were
bolted and barred as if for a siege, and one
could get in or out of them only by ticket.
Most of the people came to see what the
proletariat would do, but the proletariat
seemed to be conspicuous by its absence, That
is, if the French proletariat consists of
rough and horny-handed sons of toil. These
people had a comfortable and bourgeois
aspect. They did not seem capable of revolu-
tion. But presently a motor-’bus, driven by
a student strike-breaker and guarded by sol-
diers, dashed stupidly into the middle of
the packed crowd, and I was surprised to
see my bourgeoisie smashing windows, drag-
ging passengers out of their seats and beat-
ing the student-driver over the head with
walking-sticks. The motor-’bus was aban-
doned like a stranded ship, and the passions
of the crowd immediately subsided.
Later two Socialist members of Parlia-
ment stood up and asked the crowd to dis-
perse. This seemed to be the signal for a
savage onslaught on the part of the police,
I saw one man, for what reason nobody
seemed to know, break and run across the
square, a policeman with uplifted sword m
close pursuit. The next 1 , moment the sword
descended, and the first victim of May Day
riots lay dead on the pavement. It was the
signal for general reprisals. The two Social-
ist- Deputies were beaten over the head with
the flat of swords, and one was carried oft
badly injured. The mob commenced tearing
up the iron grids around the trees; the
merely-curious were swept in a wild swirl 01
humanity into the side streets. Army jug-
gernauts arrived and disgorged reinforce-
ments, who commenced to clear the boule-
vards by the simple process of slapping pro-
letarian legs with the flat of their swords,
a merciful method which resulted, accord-
ing to newspaper statistics, in 110 slashed
extremities.
On the whole, a quiet May Day. Six or
seven people killed, an unknown number in-
jured, 120 policemen hurt, no barricades, and
scarcely’ a whiff of grapeshot in the whole
city. I suppose the Paris police know the
psychology of their own people. Perhaps the
ghost of the Bastille, which has watched so
many dramas of irreconcilable ideals, exhales
an unquiet atmosphere, and perhaps the
black old stones of Paris breathe into the soft
spring, air an intolerant and passionate influ-
ence, filling men’s minds with hate and fear.
But to an onlooker it has seemed a crazy,
because avoidable, affair. And an Austra-
lian goes to his bed in this Paris hotel mar-
velling that the catcli-words and phrases
which spring into life in such an atmos-
phere should be imported into his own
country.
M. G. SKIPPER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Blots on the Constitution.
Some time this year it is vaguely understood
that something will be done towards elect-
ing a convention to revise the Federal pact
or make a new one. In either case the law
under which the Convention is called ought
to specify that nobody save the Convention
itself shall have any hand in the business,
and that if the document _it drafts isn’t
accepted by the people and is referred back
for alteration it shall be referred to the
body of popular representatives which
created it and to no one else. It was
through neglect of this precaution last time
that two disastrous blots found their way
into the document that exists to-day. The
people’s chosen delegates, the most notable
gathering of mental tonnage that Australia
ever saw, devised a scheme. It was accepted
by popular vote in every State, including
New South Wales, wherein a vote was taken,
and accepted in every case by the full majo-
rity specified in the original bargain made
among the States when the Convention was
elected. But the shabby act of treachery,
according to which N.S.W.’s acceptance was
annulled by its local Parliament, gave a
chance to reopen the matter, and a self-
appointed conference of State Premiers, at
the instance of G. H. Reid, began to tinker
with the work of the nation’s deputies. One
of their acts —the best-known one —was the
demand that every State save N. S. Wales
should be disqualified as a site for the
Federal capital. This put N. S. Wales in
the position of the one member of the league
which had to be bribed not to desert what
was claimed as its own movement —as the
one venal and purely selfish partner. Out
of that grew the insanity of Canberra,
planted among a huddle of cold-weather capi-
tals in the far south, to give everybody
assurance that the White Australia doctrine
is a failure; for though the tropical section
represents more than half of non-
desert Australia, no capital is located there
and no politician pursues his calling there.
The other blot was the proviso that no
State could be subdivided, however much
one section of it might desire to set up for
itself, save with the consent of the Legis-
lature at the overgrown State capital. What
subdivisions Australia has seen have all been
done against .the will of the ruling crowd
at the capital. Now, in four States the
metropolis with its immediate surroundings
represents from half to two-thirds of the
population, and it has no more idea of dimin-
ishing its own pomp and self-importance
by letting its people go, even in the country’s
interests, than Pharaoh had with Israel
or old Russia with Poland or Edward Car-
son with Ireland, so there is no way of
cutting the unwieldy provinces save revolu-
tion—or a new Constitution. Yet sub-
division and the establishment of new State
capitals (capitals being the only centres of
population that Australia seems capable of
growing) are essential if there is to be dif-
fusion of population. It was in this way
that Melbourne and Brisbane arose, and
Australia has found no other way. Bris-
bane when it became a seat of government
was very much what the adjacent town of
Mullumbimby, just across the N. S. Wales
border, is to-day. But for separation it
would nrobably be another Mullumbimby
still. With three State capitals and Par-
liamentary centres north of Capricorn, and
with a Federal capital there, population
would mass in the North, to show that a
white Commonwealth is possible and to fore-
stall the otherwise inevitable demand of
colored races that they should be allowed to
use a place for which the selfish white man
has no use himself. The two constitutional
blots in question seriously imperil White
Australia, and they were not _ the work ot
the men whom the people appointed as Con-
stitution-makers. Certainly the blots were
accepted by the people at the second refer-
endum —either they had to be accepted or
the whole Federal movement thrown over-
board. But not being the work of the
people’s first Convention the people’s second
Convention need have no scruple _ about
throwing out both of them. And this time
it should be a hard and fast bargain that
the people’s representatives and the people
themselves by subsequent referendum shall
do all the work, and that no political card-
sharpers shall come between them.
A Danger-sign from History.
An extract from “The History of the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth,” Chapter VII: The
Decade after the War —
The great aftermath of the inflation of the war-
period was the panic of 1922. For some years after
the war money was plentiful, and the people
formed the habit of spending it freely and of
engaging in unwise speculation. They did not take
account of thd new conditions; they went on in
the old way until the crash came. Hundreds of
miles of needless railways were built in the un-
peopled West. Great business enterprises were un-
dertaken on borrowed capital. As a fever. leaves
its victim weaker than before, so the fever of inflated
prices and over-issues of money will in the end bring
disaster in the business world. The panic of 1922,
which ran its course in four or five years, was occa-
sioned, but not caused, by a great banking failure
on September 18, 1922. This day is known as a
second Black Friday. From this day failure fol-
lowed failure among great business firms. Business
of every sort became stagnant, and only after years
of recuperation could the normal conditions of trade
be resumed.
This further reference to the crisis appears
in “Australia: A Post-War Study”:
During 1921 the balance of trade was strongly
against Australia. The circulation of depreciated
paper money had brought to many an apparent pros-
perity which was not real, leading to-the free crea-
tion of debts by individuals, corporations, towns,
cities and States. An unprecedented mileage of rail-
ways had been constructed. Numerous farmers had
run into debt when rank inflation was on, and, tied
to their mortgaged farms, were compelled to produce
against a constantly-falling market. The entire busi-
ness of the country was on a basis of inflation,
and when contraction came disaster was inevitable.
.The panic overspread the country. Credit was
refused, debtors were pressed for payment, securities
were rushed into the market and fell greatly in
price. There was a run upon the savings banks,
many of which succumbed. Manufactured goods were
little saleable, and the prices of agricultural pro-
ducts painfully sank. Factories, began to run on
short time; many closed entirely; many corpora-
tions failed. The peculiarity of this crisis was the
slowness with which it abated. No date could be
set as its term, its evil effects dragging on through
years.
In point of fact, one excerpt, altered only
as to time and place, is'taken word for word
from H. W. Elson’s “History of the United
States,” and the other from “America in
Our Own Time,” by E. Benjamin
Andrews. Australia is repeating all the
circumstances of the boom which suc-
ceeded the Civil War in the U.S.A., and is
careering gaily towards the same rock, _ re-
gardless of the warnings which other simi-
lar! y-circumstanced nations have written for
our benefit.
♦
The Jerger Case.
When the Nestor, with Father Jerger
aboard, was held up at Adelaide the water-
side workers hastily resolved :
We will not coal or load any vessel which is to
be used for the deportation of any Australian citizen
before he or she has had a fair and open trial, and
we urge our Australian Federal Council to adopt a
similar resolution.
This is a glaring attempt to prop up the
case by the pretence that an Australian
citizen is being expelled. Australian citizen-
ship isn’t so poor or cheap a thing that it
belongs as a matter of right to any Hun or
Turk or negro or Chinaman who likes to
come here for his own purposes. The in-
alienable right of every country to keep away
or send away strangers simply because they
are strangers—to do it without trial or with-
out even alleging a crime—is the basis on
which the White Australia doctrine rests at
the last resort, and it is a right which every
country whose citizenship is worth having
jealously preserves. The Father Jerger case
may offer grounds for an attack on the
present Federal Ministry; it may be used as
an argument in favor of the recall and the
initiative; it may be a reason why the War
Precautions Act should be repealed. But
it is not being used for these purposes: under
cover of it Australian nationalism is being
insidiously attacked by Internationalism;
and that is a matter of vastly-greater impor-
tance.
Unionism Hun Mad.
A committee has been appointed by the
Aus. Labor party and has been sitting in
Sydney to consider proposed amendments in
the State Industrial Arbitration Act. A
list of leading propositions (some adopted
by the main body and some held over for
further consideration) has been published.
They include: —
A 44-hour week —or less in certain industries.
Court to have power to deal with any matter,
industrial or not, which may cause a strike.
As a strike may be ostensibly caused by
social, religious, personal or other matters,
the power of the proposed Court seems about
the most comprehensive on earth. It beats
the Star Chamber.
The Court to have power to control in any indus-
try any matter affecting employment, including
management.
This applies, not merely to strike times, but
to all times. And as every matter in an
industry more or less affects employment, it
is suggested that the Court shall really run,
supervise, manage and boss every industry
from the A.M.P. Society and the Bank of
N. S. Wales down to Smith’s boot-repair-
ing shop, and do it in every detail. This
paper hopes the Court will be equal to the
job.
In no circumstances is imprisonment to be imposed
upon a person on strike or for participating in a
strike.
Which reads like a fine comprehensive in-
dulgence ticket. A person on strike may
commit murder, assault, arson, forgery, em-
bezzlement, bigamy, piracy, barratry, simony,
abusive language, abduction, and all manner
of sundries, and as he can’t be imprisoned it
is difficult to see what can be done with him.
Officials of the union to have the right to enter
any place or premises, shop, mine or building to
interview employees, inspect time and wages-sheets,
etc., etc.
Apparently union officials may. come in any
number, come anywhere provided it is a.
building,” come every day, stay all day,,
behave pretty much as they please (especi-
ally in strike time when they are exempt,
from arrest), overhaul the books (included in
“etc., etc.”) without giving any guarantee:
that they won’t sell the information therein
contained, render work or business impos-
sible (unless bought off), and even pervade:
private houses, including bedrooms (they are:
included in “any place or premises,” and they
are “a building,” and they might be raided
at any time in search of sleeping male or
female employees whom it is desired to inter-
view in pursuit of “etc., etc.,” which may
lurk anywhere). There are also these inter-
esting items among others of less import-
ance :
Preference to unionists (a) in all the public ser-
vices of the State and (b) in all awards made by
the Court or a Board. .
Unions to have the right to allocate their funds tc>
political purposes.
The Court’s jurisdiction to be extended to persons;
in receipt of wages up to £l5 a week.
When the Court controls every industry
everybody, including the man at £7BO a year,,
will be necessarily a unionist, in order not to
lose his job on the preference clause, and will
contribute by compulsion to the party’s politi-
cal fund, which v/ill be large. And the. same
set of officials of “the union,” if it is the
One Big Union, will have entry anywhere
without a search warrant, for everybody will
be subject to them. The tips they should be
able to collect would stagger the late
Croesus Rothschild Rockefelt.hr. But
perhaps it is all a dream.
Prohibition in the U.S.A.
A Digger, who remained behind to get some
post-war instruction, and then crossed to>
America to continue his studies, writes from.
Alabama: —
It is three months since I landed in New York and;
they have been months of travel. In every place I
have visited the Prohibition law has aroused resent-
ment and resistance. It is generally admitted that
Prohibition could never have been carried by popu-
lar referendum. As a matter of cold fact, a popular
vote was never risked. And the result of its being
forced on the people without their sanction is that
many of them are engaged in actively or passively
resisting it. A vast illicit trade has grown up
in every seaport where passing ships can be per-
suaded to trade; and a vast amount of labor on
farms and a vast amount of corn (maize) have
been diverted to the manufacture of “corn liquor,”
which is distilled by “moonshiners” in the mountains
and distributed by “bootleggers” in the towns.
This corn liquor is surely the vilest intoxicant ever
produced by a civilised people. Water-white in
color, with a varying and uncertain alcoholic
strength, oily in appearance and usually horrible
in taste (although one lot recently sampled recalled
a bottle of Ktireh “captured” by the 39th Btn.
A.I.F. at Heilly-Somme on March 29, 1918), it has
only one redeeming feature —its “kick.” It is com-
monly known as white-lightning, and my second
experience of it produced a velvety blackness that
lasted for five hours. This vile liquid costs from
three to ten dollars a quart. In Alabama in the
last two months over 1400 stills have been destroyed
by Federal agents employed to enforce the liquor
legislation, but no arrests for manufacturing were
effected!
In the State of Georgia, next door, there is a
product called beevo, and known as near-beer; but
the manufacturer has a poor sense of distance. It
is drunk under protest and with manifest dislike by
-those who must have something other than the
“cherry-phosphate” of the soda-fountains. It is
less harmful, of course, than the corn liquor, but
much less convivial. In this State the liquor laws
are more or less openly defied. In a seaport town
my brother and I recently purchased two bottles
of Canadian Club at $lO a bottle, and one of Ken-
tucky rye whisky at $l2. A deputation of respect-
able—and thirsty—citizens met us at the station on
our return to share our good fortune.
The American Anti-Saloon League is behind the
Prohibition movement in Australia. Here it is
becoming unpopular by reason of its active and
apparently hired participation in party politics. Last
month a bitter contest raged for the election of a.
Senator for the State of Alabama. Underwood, the
sitting Senator, a man of ability and untarnished
record, was opposed by two candidates, one a multi-
millionaire, and the other a Judge who had actually
written the bone-dry laws for Alabama. The mil-
lionaire, to the intense amusement of the State,
posed as the moral and Christian candidate, but
although the Judge is a lifelong Prohibitionist and
one of the leading churchmen of Alabama, the Anti-
Saloon League enthusiastically endorsed the candi-
dature of Mr. Plutocrat, and brought that stormy
petrel of American politics, William J. Bryan, along
to attack Underwood, which he did for all he was
worth. But Underwood won, an indication that the
League is thoroughly discredited in the South.
In Alabama a considerable proportion of the
revenue obtained from the liquor trade went to par
for education, and it hasn’t been replaced. The
result is that education is suffering all through the
South. There is a .shortage of 4000 teachers in
Alabama alone. Furthermore, the enforcing of the
liquor law's has brought into existence a horde of
excise-men, spies, revenue-officers and others who
have to be paid out of the depleted exchequer. And
crime has not diminished. There are more people
in the prisons of Alabama now' than at any time
in its previous history. There were more murders
last year in the States of Alabama and Georgia
than there w’ere in the British Isles. The prophecy
of a crime-free State has not materialised, and
wealthy citizens still go off to Cuba for an “alco-
holiday.”
From hard-pressed Poland, the republic that
never has much luck, it was reported lately
that President Pilsudstu had issued a general
call to arms, and the whole nation, women
included, was responding. Unfortunately 10
enthusiasts who have just rushed to arms
are often not worth one business-like soldier
who has been in arms for three years or so.

Irishmen (when they Wore the Green in ’9B

brilliant failure. There is nothing like hav-
ing the army ready. That is what compul-
sory training is for. It took Britain two
years to improvise a force worth mentioning
against the Germans; meantime hundreds of
thousands of lives were sacrificed, and the
German was given so much time to
strengthen his position that the absence of
a trained army to start with probably lost
half a million lives even after the trained
»rmy had been created.
Without any silly pretence of Parliament-
ary sanction N.S.W. Minister McGirr says
he is going ahead with his very newest scheme
of distributing baby-clothes to expectant
mothers —£5 10s. worth apiece. With
pride he says that he has had his personal
reward, for a number of babies have been
named Gregory after him. (“Gregory”
means in Greek “a watchman”—one with
his eye on the next election.) Statesmen
are gods of two kinds. There is the big god
with ideas for making a country so prosper-
ous, self-contained, self-reliant, and, above
all, self-dependent that want will be little
known, that wealth
will be widely distri-
buted and that there
will he wealth of our
own to distribute. And
there is the very small
god of the Arthur-
McGirr brand who
knows of no big things
to be done, and be-
lieves that the coun-
try is a permanent and
unavoidable muddle to
be alleviated by the
distribution of loans
when they can be got,
and by the Minister
toddling round on his
own feet, in his own
little orbit, with a
basket of broken vic-
tuals.
“Covale” : It is time
thh ■ Minister for the
Navy inquired into the
ridiculously extrava-
gant coastal wireless
service. An examina-
tion of ships’ wireless
logs would convince
anyone that by shift-
ing the position of one
or two stations at least
half the total at pre-
sent maintained could
be dispensed with,
while the efficiency of
the service would be
increased. The “blan-
keting” of Perth was
again in evidence when
a message from the
Renown was received via Geraldton. There
are numerous instances of this blanketing
round the coast, all well known and recorded
by operators in their logs. On the other
hand, the overlapping of some stations is
very marked. Mt. Gambier is rarely heard
except when saying G.M. and G.N. to Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. When the land line
breaks down up north, Thursday Island
can’t raise Cooktown direct, the messages
having to be relayed through Port Moresby.
With recent improvements in receiving gear
practically all the “daylight-only” stations
(half the total) could be dispensed with;
and by cutting the existing rates generously,
and thus encouraging traffic, the service
could be made to maintain itself. As run
now it is merely a sink for public money.

‘ Ex-Missionary” reads a commination
service:—•
The figures are growing fast on paper, even before
the thing is started. Latest suggestions by well-
advertised philanthropists are that the N. S. Wales
baby pension may be 7s. 6d. per week instead of
65.; that it shall apply to all children after the
first, not after the second ; that there will be 200,000
children on the list at first if the pension only
begins- with No. 3, and many more if it begins
with No. 2; that the bill may be £3,500,000
a year to start, but may be a lot more, and will
increase indefinitely. Of course, a great part of
the money is expected to come out of loans. If it
comes nominally out of revenue there will be a
shifting of other items—road repairs and schools, for
instance—into loan account to make room for it.
The first crop of pensioned children is expected to
be thankful, of course, and to grow up in time to
express their thankfulness by voting for the well-
advertised philanthropists who probably also expect
(some of them, anyhow) a spiritual reward and a
better seat in Heaven. But there will be later gen-
erations —those children born to the gigantic bur-
dens that selfish, sordid, shuffling, borrowing predeces-
sors left to them; the children of bankruptcy,
poverty, bondage and taxation who come into the
world saddled and bridled, with a dead horse for a
birth-gift and a hollow mockery for a cradle and
a big tax-paper for a primer and a bailiff -for a
teacher. And those of them who understand will
curse the hypocrisy and selfishness of the philan-
thropists with a bitter and enduring curse because
these men of Pecksniffian mould tried to buy them-
selves fame and profit on earth and luck for their
private and personal souls in the hereafter with
money which they left the unborn to pay. In other
words, the borrowers, including the pious ones, give
away the children’s bread before the children arrive,
and make a handsome indirect but very real profit
for themselves out of each loaf. Men on their
deathbeds have been known to try to purchase a
belated harp and crown by leaving their children
penniless and giving their goods to some church
or charity, but none of them ever came back to
tell how the scheme worked. They were a mean lot,
but at least they only sacrificed their own children.

It looks as if Australia’s oversea trade —
or what remains of it—will be carried on
presently by flying machine. One line of
steamers has been boycotted because it is
helping to deport Jerger. Another is to be
boycotted because proteges of the almighty
Tom Walsh have allegedly been refused
admittance to Canada. That line belongs to
the Canadian Government, and if Australia
allows a few windy irresponsibles to boycott
Canadian Government steamers, Canada will
probably retort by boycotting Australian
Government steamers, boycotting being a

’ 0N the Decline and Fall of Freedom:—
One of the aftermaths of the war is what may
be called Hughesery. Hughesery, or the exercise
of power for its own sake—as by censors and such-
like war-time officials—is highly infectious. In the
big Government departments everyone has it, more
or less, and the ingenuity which is brought to the
business of baiting the community is remarkable,
Consider, for example, this typical case from Narra-
been (N.S.W.). A grocer—call him Jones—hired
a telephone at £l2 10s. per annum and Id. a call,
The contract said nothing about the public being
debarred from using the instrument—the public
use of private ’phones is a recognised custom
in most parts of the Commonwealth—and the grocer
relied on providing this convenience to bring him
trade. Narrabeen, though only 14 miles from Syd-
nev, is a place where letters are not delivered and
telegrams are generally delayed for hours It has a
population o? a few hundreds in winter and of some
thousands in summer; it is unlighted; and it
straggles over an area of two or three miles The
Department installed a public telephone there, 'jones
allowed some women—who didn’t fancy walking
close on a mile at night on the chance of getting on
to Sydney—to use his ’phone, and had it cut off.
It is still off. Jones can do nothing. Neither can
the residents. They are up against embattled
bureaucracy. The moving force is probably some
absurd little man who is himself grievously
oppressed by other bureaucrats. But for all prac-
tical purposes he is, within the limits of his job,
a Czar, without a Czar’s liability to assassination.
As an effect of the War Precautions Act has been
to spawn these pocket despots in thousands, the
nation is cursing beneath a burden of tyranny
which would be intolerable if it didn’t trade under
the name of democracy.
“Cleveland” chips into a controversy that
has become violent:—
The only advantage that Rockhampton has over
Gladstone is that of experience in experimenting,
as it has had three tries to make a port, with the
result that it has Port Alma, which is not con-
nected by land, and Broadmount, which is not
connected by sea. Its third attempt is to drag ships
up the Fitzroy River, which is 33 miles long and
no deeper now than it was 23 years ago. It may
be shallower, as they have shovelled upwards of a
quarter of a million into it since then.
Among Rockhampton’s other assets is a popula-
tion that has split into three factions, yelling
furiously for Port Alma, Broadmount or the river,
with the result that when the yell is over things
remain much as they were before. It takes money
and unity of purpose to build ports. Rockhampton
has had the money and spent it. The other it never
had. Last year’s harbor account closed with a debt
of £338,312, an interest bill (two years) of
£21,873, a bank overdraft of £1423; total,
£361,308. The revenue was £27,469, which is
£16,495 less than it was five years ago, and
general management, maintenance, stores and coal,
etc., cost £16,331, which left £11,138 to- meet
an interest bill of £12,656, and redemption wasn’t
in the picture.
The worst that Rockhampton can say of Glad-
stone is that the ship Lord Auckland came to grief
on “one of the many sandbanks in Gladstone Harbor
in 1847.” But the Gladstone people are either more
magnanimous in the knowledge of their splendid
harbor, or else they have not read Bird’s “Early
History of Rockhampton,” which says of the passage
of the Satellite up the river from Keppel Bay in
1858: “The correct passage was guessed by avoiding
the vessels which were stuck on sandspits.” Common-
sense and stern necessity are beginning to turn
the minds of thinking people to the natural and
magnificent harbor of Gladstone. Also, the drowsy
crowd there is either dying out or being outvoiced
by the younger and more energetic generation. My
vote goes to Gladstone and a sane harbor policy for
Central Queensland.
All the big plants for irrigation on the Mur-
ray simply eat up wood. Locking may save
a certain amount of pumping by raising the
level of the river, but in most places it will
always be necessary to lift the water, and
the great extension of irrigation expected in
the next few years will mean a big increase
in the quantity of fuel needed for stoking.
Even now the plants at Mildura eat about
30,000 tons a year. Up river the woodcutters
have worked back nearly 100 miles. To-day
they are swinging the axe below the junction
of the Murray and the Darling. But ex-
isting supplies won’t last long; and if the
States concerned are wise they will begin at
once to make provision for the greater needs
of the future.
Ihe view of another Macquarie-street man-
I quite agree with The Bulletin’s article on
syphilis (22/7/’2o)—though we must be careful not
to .allow ourselves to be obsessed with one evil out
of many in the world. But the writer is, I think
mistaken in regard to its history. There has always
been a certain amount of difference of opinion as
to when it first appeared in Europe; but not a
single ancient bone shows any syphilitic lesion, and
that would be an impossible thing had syphilis been
known in Europe in antiquity. Iwan Bloch, of
Berlin, has settled the matter finally, in my opinion.
He criticises fatally all the evidence that it was
known in Europe before 1493 ; he traces its begin-
nings from the landing of Columbus at Haiti to
his letum to Barcelona, and thence it spread through
Europe. The only effect of the French attack on
Naples was to spread it still more rapidly; thence
it went like a whirlwind all over Europe, and few
people escaped. It was then a much more terrible
affair than it is now. It led to acute illness, with
high tempeiature, and frequently death; and its
sequelas were extremely common and serious. People
were not partially immune to it then, as they are
now, as they are also to measles and Scarlet fever
and tuberculosis. Europe to syphilis was like Fiji
was to measles a few years ago, when this childish
complaint slew most of the natives in its first on-
slaught. While of course it is highly desirable that
the thing should be treated properly, and exter-
minated as far as possible, still we must not expect
too much or let ourselves get fanatical about it.
Considering the enormous prevalence of the disease
it really kills comparatively few; probably not
nearly so many as alcohol, even counting all its
side-issues ; and probably if we could abolish alcohol
we should find it possible to get rid of syphilis.
The normal man does not deliberately go and risk
catching syphilis; in most cases he does so when
he has had a couple of whiskys—not when he is
drunk, understand: when
his self-control is upset,
and he does not take
proper precautionary
measures. The two dread-
ful evils are inextricably
intertwined; and I speak
from long and sad experi-
ence of the black side of
our profession.

fleet, having dis-
charged its first cargo
at Hobart, da 11 e d
loudly for consign-
ments of fruit for Syd-
ney. The response was
so poor that on the ad-
vertised date of sailing
the little ship’s hold was
less than half-full.
Just before it pulled
out for Sydney, mana-
ger Robinson and the
Premier expressed dis-
appointment at the
slackness of consign-
ments, but supposed
that local shippers
had received advices
that the Sydney mar-
ket was not at the
moment favorable for
apples. A simpler ex-
planation is that, as
the Melbourne’.'
freights are no lower
than those of the pri-
vate steamship cos.,
shippers won’t rush
the State steamer. A
Government that has too great regard
for Private Enterprise to cut freight rates
in order to secure full cargoes ought at least
to have got guarantees from local shippers
before starting out on the venture—and they
could have been quite reasonably asked for,
seeing that it was the howls of shippers
about the exactions of the private shipping
monopoly that compelled the Government to
embark on the business.
When Hughes launched the Science and
Industry Institute idea in 1916 he talked at
large about half a million (whether once for
all or per year was not clear) being needed
for the great work of applying science to
industry, and so saving Australia. But
Australia is going to be saved a lot cheaper
now. The expenditure of £50,000 a year
that might, properly applied, have worked
wonders, is wanted for other uses, and at a
Nationalist party meeting the Federal Min-
istry promised to turn down the bill intro-
anc* dropped last session to suit dis-
satisfied members. The result is seen in the
truncated affair now before the Reps. But
as it is doubtful whether the Ministry really
means to push the thing through, maybe the
alterations won’t matter much, one way or
other. The obvious person for the one-
man job is John Monash. He is a graduate,
an engineer with a scientific training, a busi-
ness man and a great organiser. But there
is mighty little chance of the thing being
made worth his while. The Federal Minis-
try is not exactly breaking its neck to show
its gratitude to Monash or to secure his
services for Australia.


Empire Defence and the Safety of Australia.
Mr. Amery, Under-Secretary for the
Colonies, in giving an outline of the naval
defence proposals for the Empire, stated that
it had been decided to adopt “a new system,
consisting of a defensive chaiin, of which
each link will be primarily equipped to sus-
tain its own defence.”
Naval Defence is, to Australia, of grave importance, and calls
for preparedness with ships of war, guns and munitions.
Australia cannot risk her safety by dependence upon others
to supply her needs in these directions. The facilities for
their manufacture in case of necessity must be established
here. This makes essential the development, on a sound
basis, of the
Australian Iron
and Steel Industry
apart altogether from the economic aspect of the question.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The soap-box manner of speech among
politicians does a lot to create the atmos-
phere which makes even renewal loans hard
to get, and sends the interest buzzing up
so high. When there was a great and ille-
gal strike movement in 1917 to (among other
things) stop the supply of reinforcements
to Australia’s Army in Europe, the promise
of preference to non-strikers was made in
N. S. Wales in print, publicly and officially,
and after liberal notice. The Storey Gov-
ernment’s reverse policy of preference to
the law-breakers means that one Ministry
isn’t trammelled by the pledge or lOU of
its predecessor, and a smell like the sus-
picion of ancient egg arises. A Queensland
Minister was even more unfortunate when
his Government proposed to alter its agree-
ment with the English-owned Brisbane
Tramway Co. He asked with needless
energy if the people were bound by “dis-
abilities which were placed on them in 1890,”
and said distinctly “No.” Then he went to
London to ask for £9,000.000 more of dis-
ability, and people naturally wondered if he
would be bound by that either.
The Tasmanian school-teachers’ conference
the other day declared 'for “a council of
teachers and departmental officials” so that
the former may have “the fullest and freest
participation in the framing and carrying
out of all matters concerning their work” ;
and that looks like the forerunner of a whole
drove of similar demands. It is a movement
that will have to be met with argument and
counter-proposal, too; and it is the worker
and the democrat who will have to be shown
to be the loser by it.
Maoriland is experiencing a brisk revival
of the old trade in Chinese, the £lOO poll-
tax notwithstanding. Encouraged by Labor
manifestoes affirming the solidarity of the
human race and the right of every human
being (color unspecified) to enjoy the good
things of life to the fullest possible extent,
Ram Chunder is also making his appear-
ance in large numbers. M.L. doesn’t poll-
tax Ram Chunder, and there are 60,000 Ram
Chunders in Fiji. Ah Fat and Ram Chun-
der and friend Fusiyama enthusiastically
welcome the brotherhood-of-man business,
but the M.L. worker begins to have his
doubts.
The Land, dissatisfied with the Sydney
jury’s verdict awarding £2OOO damages to
ex-Lands Minister Ashford for an alleged
libel, lodged an appeal on Friday, and thinks
it sees 32 reasons why it should succeed.
Last week The Bulletin, searching for
whatever was at the back of the jury’s mind
to produce the verdict, suggested that pro-
bably it was the belief that Ashford had
previously been offered the leadership of the
party which the Land was backing in the
election. The Bulletin is, however,
assured that no such offer was ever made
to the then Minister, and that a challenge
to him to produce any evidence that he had
received the offer evoked no reply. So it
seems that either this paper’s guess was*
wrong or if any such idea was in'the jury’s
mind it shouldn’t have been there.
The Australian public subscribed £656,000
of the Victorian Government’s £2,725,000
loan ; the banks took the rest. The loan was
for conversion purposes, and considering that
he got the money at 1 per cent, less than
N. S. Wales had to offer in London (and its
reception was discouraging at that), McPher-
son is moderately gratified. But he owed
what success he had to the friendliness of
the banks, and it doesn’t improve the out-
look for Theodore. The banks aren’t so
friendly to Theodore as they are to McPher-
son.
Jowett, M.H.R., is trying to get the
Federal method of assessing income altered,
and every farmer in Australia says “Hear,
hear.” Last year thousands of N. S. Wales
wheat-growers didn’t make a penny. Some
of them have earned nothing for two years,
and very little for three. On present indi-
cations the 1920 harvest will show a profit,
but, if so, the Federal tax-gatherers will
deduct the year’s expenditure from the year’s
receipts and call the balance taxable income,
although the bulk of it is already mortgaged
THE LIBERATOR.
THE BOSS : “Compulsion is immoral. Be a free man—give me that gun, and carry
this hag for me."
to pay the losses on the 1919 and 1918 crops.
In fact, the tax may conceivably amount to
more than Cocky’s net annual income during
the three years. Jowett’s idea is that the
assessment should be on the average of five
years’ income, instead of on one good year.
It is so simple and reasonable a reform that
it is unlikely to go through.
Somebody having allegedly written or said
something which suggested a hostile feeling
towards the United States in Australia,
Attorney-General Robinson, of Victoria, then
on a visit to New York, rushed in with this:
X regret to find that an impression is gaining
ground in America that there is a growing feeling
of hostility.... This belief has a tendency to pre-
vent the investment of American capital in Australia,
and Australia must remove the impression in order
to encourage such investment.
On the other hand, this paper assures
Robinson (1) that Australia doesn’t want
any more absentee landlords or capitalists
living on it, having too many absentees living
on it already; ( - 2) that it doesn’t want any
more debt of any kind ; (3) that the U.S.
person, judged by his large capacity for
making money out of people who buy his
standard oil and his Huckleberry sewing-
machine, is an expensive man to get into
debt to ; (4) that, anyhow, it was a clumsy
trick to imply that we only wanted to be on
good terms with Uncle Samuel in the hope
of borrowing money from him.
Senator Gardiner, writing to the press in
the Father Jerger interest about the Magna
Charta that was annulled by the Pope, de-
clared last week that “the ultimate effect....
was to give and to guarantee full protection
for person and property to every human
be.ing that breathes English air.” English
air? Do we import that too?
Being embittered by the cold weather or
strengthened by much Scotch ancestry or
something, Maoriland does things that Aus-
tralia hardly dreams of. It jugged for long
terms the able-bodied citizens who refused
to join the army during the war, and-many
of them are in gaol yet. Also some who
got away remain in exile, for the Law is still
waiting for them and gnashing its teeth on
the shore. Now the Dominion, in the in-
terests of its profitable tote, is strengthening
the anti-bookmaker law, making it £5OO or
two years for Mo and £lOO or a month for
the man who bets with Mo. Talk about
Caledonia stern and riled!
Another costly and copious Premiers’ Con-
ference has decided to get rid of the dupli-
cate income-tax machinery that has been
exasperating and helping to impoverish Aus-
tralia for the last five years. That is to
say, it has appointed the inevitable Board to
“go into the matter” and report to the next
Conference; bu.t as the Boardhas no power
and the Conference no constitutional stand-
ing, and as there may be a new lot of Pre-
miers presently (and new Premiers consider
it a bounden duty to disapprove of what
their predecessors have done), the thing is not
much further forward than it was five years
ago. Government in Australia has become
a bewildering business of Conferences, Con-
ventions, Commissions, Committees, Coun-
cils and Caucuses, and things have a de-
pressing habit of not getting done.
Two polite envoys from S. Africa are in
Australia just now with a view to purchasing
high-class merino sheep, and hope by careful
breeding and our help to improve their wool
industry so that it will make Australia sit
up and wonder where its old supremacy has
gone. Polite envoys from Australia have
gone to Africa to talk in the same strain
about ostriches, and have been told —well,
the present polite envoys no doubt know
what those others have been told. How
would it be to offer the African gentlemen a
shepherd instead of sheep—-say, Father
Jerger?
Lambert, an alderman and a leader of the
N.S.W. Labor party, told the Sydney City
Council the other day that there was a
strong and growing of public opinion
in favor of newspaper editors being ap-
pointed by a vote of the people. That’s the
way to preserve the rights of minorities and
to institute reforms ! Thirty years ago the
Labor press in N. S. Wales was represented
by one or two little rags, of one ot which
the writer of this paragraph was editor;
and if his job had depended upon a vote ot
his neighborhood it would have lasted about
24 hours, and a “right-thinking person”
would have been appointed in his stead.
Men like Lambert think they are radicals.
In many respects they are more conservative
than the Union Club.
There is a sequel to the story of the Com-
monwealth acquisition of the Shaw wireless
station at Randwick (Sydney)—a purchase
which led to the unwilling retirement of a
Federal Minister and enabled a Senator to
show how easy it is to win money on the
racecourses The station has now been taken
over by the Repatriation Department for a
trade school under the Vocational Training
System; and as far as wireless is concerned
there is nothing to show for the people s
money but a permanent and reproductive
debt.
Martin Hannah, M.L.A., made a bitter
complaint in the Vic. Assembly about
British imported machinery to make woollen
goods with. Said Martin :
We have been begging in vain for the machinery
to set up our returned soldiers in industry
machinery which Japan seems to have no difficulty
in getting from England.
Well, Japan hasn’t four separate statesmen
on the borrow in London simultaneously—one
(N.S.W.) asking for £3,000,000 after having
just got £3,000,000; another (Vic.) in pur-
suit of £6,000/100; a northerner after
£9.000,000; and a Federal man. trying to
arrange a debt of anywhere between eight
and forty-five millions. Japan pays J. Bull
cash. Australia doesn’t seem to pay Bull
anything unless Bull first lends him the
money.
Richard Arthur, M.L.A., thus: —
“B.” (B. l/7/’2O) stigmatises motherhood endow-
ment as a fancy and unworkable scheme. Is he
aware that in the A.I.F. the wife and children were
each given an allowance ? Why then cannot the
system be applied in civil life ? It can, and it will.
No community can afford to have thousands of its
children growing up stunted in body and mind
because they are being fed on a diet composed
mostly of bread, treacle and tea. If only 25 per
cent, of the money invested at present in beer, bets,
petrol for joy-riding and crepe do Chine for jazzing
were diverted to buying milk, butter, eggs and
fruits, and pants and skirts for Tommy and Mary,
we would remove a standing disgrace and reproach
from N. S. Wales: £3,000,000 will give every
mother 6s. a week for each of her children after
the second, and under 14 years; and if the State
income-tax plus the Fedei’al is brought up to the
level of the British tax, the money will be there
straight away, and the whole community will be
healthier and happier. It’s going to come, in spite
of all the “B’s.”
The chairman of the Fair Prices Commis-
sion has been expressing an opinion about
the Law of Supply and Demand, and the
Argus pities his ignorance derisively. The
blasphemer told a witness that the alleged
law was merely a “device that human
intelligence has created,” whereas, as the
great press authority points out. it is a.
“general law that stands unassailable.” When
a millionaire syndicate gets control of a com-
modity and reduces the market supply to a
fourth of the former quantity, the price is
forced up by a law, which “stands unassail-
able.” When a grocer’s customers are full of
paper money and the grocer raises the price
oif clothes-pegs because he can get it, there
is the Argus law to justify his imposition.
When Shylock charges a young juggins 60
per cent, or more the law of the 60 per cent,
is “unassailable.” And when the Prince is
coming to a town prices are doubled at after-
noon tea-rooms—-all in accordance with this
grand old law that is beyond attack.
A few little private railways owned by
coal companies exist in N. S. Wales. A
deputation called the other day on Premier
Storey and asked that the State should buy
these and pay for them in debentures. And
thus replied the honest boiler-building bro-
ther of Balmain :—-
When, I was in your place I used to talk like
that, but since I got into office I have had to realise
that those things have got to be paid for in the
long run, and whether- it is cash, debentures or
anything else it is all the same.
So John Storey, as a private member or as
Leader of the Opposition, misled and helped
to misgovern the country during 16 years,
for in all that time he didn’t realise that
debts have to be paid. Imagining borrowed
money to be the same as our own money, he
steered a wrong course, and only found the
matter out a few weeks ago. What deplor-
able things the party system is responsible
for! Practically there is no serious attempt
on the part of the rank and file to find the
truth. Members “behind the Government”
simply have to say that whatever it pro-
poses is right; the Opposition has to show
that it is wrong.
Every vote counts. Three or four of the
Speck’s M’s.P. asked Attorney-General Prop-
sting to make the Prince’s visit an excuse
for remission to confinees in
Hobart Gaol. The polite Propsting didn’t
say he considered the request absurd: he
merely urged them to remember that their
friends ha_d already had a liberal Declara-
tion-of-Peace discount.

The average citizen, looking around for the
causes which have increased the cost of mere
shelter and sustenance and made it nearly
twice as much as it was a very few years ago,
has decided that the profiteer is mostly blam-
able. Every time any co. discloses larger
profits the man-in-the-street thinks he sees
still further confirmation of his suspicions.
But the profiteer, H.C.L. and all other
troubles which touch the public’s pocket are
products of the times, and the profiteer,
after all is said and done, plays only a very
small part. Profiteering and fat profits have
been possible only because the public, hand-
ling the proceeds of more lOU’s than it ever
dreamt of, has considered itself better off,
and created and maintained a heavy demand
in famine markets. In the process the
middlemen and others have had a great time,
not always because they charged unduly high
prices, for, as scores of Government inquiries
have demonstrated, traders’ big profits have
come mostly from an increased turnover of
goods individually showing a smaller per-
centage of profit than formerly. Naturally,
such conditions invited the attentions of the
crows of the community ; but while the public
curses the crows it overlooks that its paper-
fatted calf, Artificial Prosperity, threatens to
make a mess of the landscape now the loan
drought is in sight.
In the banks, trading in one commodity, the
true position is less confused than elsewhere.
Here is the Commercial of Sydney, which,
after five years of war troubles that cost the
Commonwealth over 355 millions, has never
before been able to pay 10 p.c. divs. to its
shareholders with greater ease. Further, a
cursory glance at its grouped balance-sheet
figures would seem to indicate that its affairs
were never in a healthier condition. It is
the same with all banks, from which it might
be deduced that the Commonwealth was never
more prosperous. It is all an illusion.
Nobody realises the true position better than
the bankers, wherefore, though Commercial of
Sydney profits have expanded rapidly and the
10 p.c. distributions to shareholders are not
worth as much to them as the same rate a
few years ago, no attempt has been made to
increase dividends. Instead, this is what that
wise old financier, chairman George Judah
Cohen, told shareholders the other day:—(
I have on several occasions stressed the necessity
for increased production, strict economy both public
and private, and the elimination of waste and un-
necessary expenditure. All this seems as far off as
ever, but the need is so great that I feel impelled
to again refer to it. With a record revenue of
£28,500,000, the State accounts for the past year
show a deficit of a million and a half, and instead
of efforts to reduce ■ expenditure and live within
income, more taxation and further loans are talked
of. The Commonwealth revenue has also largely
exceeded the estimates, yet further increase of tax-
ation is forecasted. Efforts should be made to
reduce our war debt, to cut down expenditure, and
live within our means. We cannot continue to
mortgage the future and live on borrowed money.
There must be an end to that sort of thing, and the
sooner this is realised and we commence to put our
house in order, the better will it be for the country
at large.
The Commonwealth is rapidly coming near
the end of its borrowing orgy. At March 31
last 295 of the 355 millions that the war cost
had been met with lOU’s, most of it carrying-
rates of interest undreamt of a few years ago.
Now the war gratuity is being distributed (all
paper) and a further £25,000,000 loan is
being floated. During the last five financial
years N. S. Wales had independently bor-
rowed 30 millions, and that followed a loan
razzle by Labor Governments the like of
which the State had never before experienced.
So many people have shared the spending of
these millions—many of the millions being
quite fictitious —-that a general feeling ‘of
prosperity has resulted, trade in luxuries,
land and so on has been brisk, the way of the
shark has been made easy, and the balance-
sheet figures of the banks have been inflated,
without corresponding increase in actual
wealth.
Natural and artificial expansion lias had
this effect on the Commercial of Sydney
balance-sheets during the past five years—

At June 30 the management thus held over
six millions more of the public’s money than
in 1915. Meantime iiew capital and accu-
mulated profits have provided an additional
£973,942 of funds. So nowadays the Com-
mercial of Sydney has over seven millions
more to play with than five years ago. Of
this £3,905,000-odd is represented by
additional advances, £3,087,000-odd has been
held liquid, and the small balance has gone
into bank premises. Thus, despite the extra
accommodation to prop up drought-stricken
primary producers during the past year, over
75 p.c. of the new funds and liabilities
acquired since 1915 has been held liquid.
But the bank’s handy resources are much
changed:—-

They are now a much more profitable lot.
There is a vast volume of Government paper
on hand, but behind that paper is the
credit of a continent. There is that very
big difference between conditions now and
when Australia’s last boom bubble burst:
Government operations are so entangled
with private banking that one cannot crash
without pulling the other with it.
In other respects the position of the banks
is much more formidable than in the
’nineties. Here are some Commercial of
Sydney comparisons:—
1890. 1920.
Capital £600,000 £2,500,000
Reserves 811,960 2,426,676
Total shareholders’ funds.. £1,411,960 £4,926,676

Liquid assets . . .. 2,990,789 17,978,450
Advances . . . . .. 9,440,046 18,141,733
Thirty years ago this bank was working on
practically £8 of the public's money for
every £ of its own, and only 26.7 p.c. of
liabilities to the public was held liquid. The
management nowadays holds only £6 9s. of
the public’s money for every £ of share-
holders’ funds, and 56.5 p.c. of its liabilities
are liquid. The Commercial of Sydney is
thus in a very strong position to meet what-
ever is coming. Its strength is the greater,
too, because all through the loan boom its
management has preached the need for cau-
tion, and no doubt in its own vaults it has
practised what it has preached. Anvhow,
the directors say that “provision has been
made for all probable losses and contingen-
cies, and for full depreciation of Govern-
ment stock.”
The most disquieting feature of the finan-
cial situation in Australia, and especially in
N. S. Wales, is the continued refusal of the
Labor leaders to go out among their deluded
supporters and tell them the truth. For 10
years they have been sowing dragons’ teeth,
and now, when faced with the. harvest, they
do little more than foretell disaster —and go
on sowing. Only this week N. S. Wales
Labor Premier Storey, just home from a
conference with the Commonwealth people
in Melbourne, told a deputation that wanted
a few more millions spent: “The Govern-
ment has not a lot of money. Both Federal
and State Governments have obligations
of an enormous character... .The financial
difficulties are such that I begin to wonder
how we are to get over them. We will yant
the hearty co-operation of the whole com-
munity, or we will have a Black Wednesday
in this country.” But what are he and his
Ministers doing to get “the hearty co-opera-
tion” of, say, his own party —the people with
whom, presumably, they have most influence?
So far the Government’s one vigorous Cam-
paign has been to borrow more money—in
other words, to sow more of the old seed.
Where is the campaign in favor of more pro-
duction—that is to say, of harder and more
continuous work? Where is the campaign
against private money-wasting and extrava-
gance, a campaign as necessary among the
wage-earners as anywhere? Where is the
campaign for drastic economy in the public
service? For the establishment of new in-
dustries —-and that is largely a matter of
convincing the worker that he must give
good, honest, regular service? What Minis-
ter is out telling the workers that the country
can’t afford strikes, and that the striker is
therefore the enemy of the country? Instead
of doing these things Ministers are for the
most part merely dangling new baits before
the people: and Motherhood McGirr is de-
veloping new schemes for the appropriation
of millions.

The Queensland National has fallen into
line with most other Australian banks, and
is now meeting its shareholders only once
each year. For purposes of comparison the
figures for former half-yearly terms have
been grouped in the table to show results
for 12 months ending June each year. The
change to annual accounts has been accom-
panied by a change also in the form of the
accounts. The management has decided
to become less communicative; hence
whereas formerly it disclosed the extent of
gross profits (after providing for contin-
gencies) and showed how much went in
expenses, all information is now confined
to a mere statement as to what those inside
declare to be the net profits. Perhaps, just
at present, the directors are not anxious to
disclose how banking profits in the Northern
State have been affected by the increased
salaries awarded by the Industrial Court
during the year.
The Q.N. has now been giving its share-
holders a taste again for two years; prior
to that it was on tne penitents’ stool recover-
ing from the frightful tangle it had got into
in the ’nineties. As a result of those troubles
a considerable amount of capital and reserves
was written off; also three-fourths of the
private deposits were converted into inter-
minable stock, the bank undertaking to
repay the remaining ss. in the £ of deposits
out of profits. There were also large debts
to the Government of Queensland, the last
of them met in 1918. These liabilities could
have been cleared out earlier had the man-
agement cared to do it, but since repayment
was well ahead of programme it wisely took
advantage of the opportunity to strengthen
the co.’s position before making profits avail-
able for shareholders. So large had been
the internal provisions that, during the war,
the Q.N. was one of the very few banks in
the Commonwealth whose profits did not
slump, the management apparently having
decided that there was no need to buttress
its securities any further. But there were
other reasons why there should have been
no falling off. of profits. When the Q.N.
showed that it was capable of making a
quick recovery its business expanded very
rapidly. This shows how the balance-sheets
have moved over two five-year periods:—
1910. ’ 1915. 1920.
Perpetual stock . . £3,091,669 £3,091,669 £3,091,669
Old debts . . 430,488
Govt, deposits . . 1,479,153 1.884,626 2,051,502
Private deposits . . 3,127,462 5,707,066 6,375,573

Liquid assets . . 3,289,078 5,168,164 6,057,803
Advances . . . . 5,392,730 6,288,587 6,783,454
Old accounts . . 156,467
Premises, etc. . . 289,349 313,821 370,299
Very solid progress was thus made between
1910-15 ; it was even more marked if com-
parisons be taken over longer periods. At
the latest balance the Q.N. was holding
double the volume of private deposits it had
10 years ago.
When it shook off the last of its old
troubles the Q.N. was in an excellent posi-
tion from the point of view of its share-
holders. Paid capital was only £480,000; on
which disclosed net profits represented over
22 p.c. So high a return was possible because
the management had over three millions of
interminable stock to work on —money which
costs it only 31 p.c. p.a. The directors thus
had an opportunity of still jfiurther strengthen-
ing the bank by getting in new capital, on
which there was every likelihood of good
divs. being paid. The 160,000 £5 shares
had been paid to £3, and it was decided to
get in the uncalled £2 per share. At the
latest balance paid capital had been increased
to £796,655 and 10 p.c. on the lot is being
distributed with ease.
Despite this new capital there was a fall-
ing off in the aggregate balance-sheet figures
during the year of practically three-quarters
of a million, due wholly to the withdrawal
of Government deposits. Liquid assets fell
off £470,000, while advances were £285,000
lower. The reduction of liquid assets was
accounted for by the dropping out of
£652,000 of Australian notes. The volume
of interest-earning liquid assets was con-
siderably increased, as this comparison
shows: —•
1919. 1920.
War Loan £416,500 £511,900
British Treasury bills .. .. 75,000 415,000
Government stocks .. .. 118,700 118,700
Money at short call in London .. 100,000 150,000
There was thus an additional £485,400 earn-
ing good rates of interest at the latest balance,
and that was some set-off against the smaller
volume of advances. Meantime, no doubt,
the high prices which Queensland produce
has brought in overseas markets has sweet-

Regarding the interminable stock as capi-
tal (it is, actually, very cheap preference
capital), after paying the current div the
Q.N. had £4,194,489 of funds and held
£8 997,151 of the public’s money. It was
thus in the extraordinarily strong position
of having under £2 3s. of the public’s money
for each £of its own. And no less than 07
p.c. of total liabilities was held in liquid
form. Put another way, to meet the
£2,940,000 of liabilities not covered by
liquid assets there were advances with a
book value of over 6f millions, besides
£370,299 of premises. So not only is the
Q.N. offering its customers exceptional
security for their money-, but it is in an
excellent position to extend its interests.

This little trustee co. now balances once
instead of twice each year, so the table has
been re-cast to show past results for full
12-montl\ terms. The co.’s interests have
expanded rapidly during recent years, and
the £2,842,346 of trusts on hand at June
30 was more than double the amount held
10 years ago after the co. had been 22
years in business. As the table above in-
dicates, it is a very comfortable little con-
cern, and the 11 p.c. divs. are the sw T eeter
because the old paid capital of £15,000 w r as
expanded to £20,000 in 1912 by a transfer
of reserves. During the past four years
accumulated profits have exceeded this
enlarged capital, so the directors have
now decided to pay another ss. call on the
20,000 shares out of reserves. This will
make these 50s. shares paid to 255., which is
their limit, the remaining 255. per share
being a reserve liability to protect clients.
Divs. of 11 p.c p.a. will be easy on this
enlarged capital if everything continues to
go well, for the co. has £33,791 invested in
public securities, and though they are all
old investments which return, for these days,
very low rates of interest—£3o,ooo-odd is in
3 p.c. Government stock —they should pro-
vide at least 4 p.c. on capital. That leaves
net commission earnings on £2.800,000 or so
of trusts to provide the remaining little £1750
necessary to pay 11 p.c. p.a. divs. Still, net
profits have not advanced in step with the
growth of the concern; last year’s were
actually smaller than those for eight and
nine years ago. Gross profits have in-
creased from £7.526 for 1911 to £12,237 last
year; but exes, have meantime moved from
£3787 to £8498. Probably the branch at
Geelong, where the co. has been in business
only a few years, has added a good deal to
costs without yet earning much. But when
clients there begin to oblige by calling in
the undertaker earnings will improve, and
meantime it should attract an increasing
volume of new business on the strength of
its success in its home town. To protect
clients shareholders have backed the manage-
ment to the extent of £45,469 and also made
themselves liable to put up a further £25,000
if anything serious happens. Ballarat or
Geelong won’t find any private trustee will-
ing to put up such a guarantee to be of
good behavior. And if he did put up such a
guarantee he couldn’t also guarantee that he
would live as long even as the testator.

Australasian Reinsurance Co., Ltd.—
This is the most ambitious attempt to date
to establish a reinsurance' co. in the Com-
monwealth. Recently, when the idea was
brought before Melbourne insurance men, a
syndicate to introduce the scheme was trebly
subscribed within a week. Now this syndi-
cate, the A.R.C. Pty., is placing the propo-
sition before the public. The Australasian
Reinsurance Co. is to have a nominal
capital of a million in £1 shares, but that
is only a measure of its ambitions, for only
135.000 shares are offered for a start, to be
paid to 10s. within three months of allot-
ment. The remaining 10s. per share is
apparently to be regarded as a reserve
liability, as the directors “do not contem-
plate making any further calls.” For intro-
ducing the scheme and “securing the business
connections they can influence,” and also
for paying £lOOO of the preliminary exes.,
“estimated not to exceed £3000,” the pro-
moters —the A.R.C. syndicate—are to get
15,000 shares paid to 10s. A weak point
about the proposition is that the prospectus
does not indicate the extent of the business-
getting capacities of the promoters: the

directors do not take the public into their
confidence even as to who these mag-
nets are that are being bought and
paid for. Provided the management can
secure a good volume of business to
select from, the venture should be very
profitable; precisely how profitable nobody
can tell, for insurance business ,is a gamble,
with a shade of odds always in favor of the
insurance cos. The Australasian Reinsur-
ance Co.’s biggest claim for support is that
its success will keep in the Commonwealth
a little more of the large volume of pre-
miums which are now laid-off overseas. In
the bad old pre-war days a good deal of
our reinsurances went even to the Hun. A
unique feature of the float is that “war
or peace bonds at market value will be
accepted in part payment” of share sub-
scriptions, and this should put a large parcel
of the best securities on the books to start
with.

An odd little co. held its annual
meeting in Adelaide the other day, re-
marking merely that, though it had not
(lone any business during the year, its
income was sufficient to cover all ex-
penses. It is the Northern Territory Land
Co., Ltd., which began in March, 1882, when
there was in S.A. a boom in land in its
(then) northern dependency, and the balance-
sheet just published goes right back to . the
start. The co. holds 73,000 acres in various
parts, bought at 7s. 6d. an acre, also £3OOO
of War Loan and Government stock, from*
which comes the'income that pays the modest
12 guineas of directors’ fees and £2l-odd of
“charges.” Federal land-tax has begun to hit
up the co. rather severely—£lo2 this year.
Veteran Ben Rounsevell is chairman, and has
behind him some of the best-known men in
Adelaide.

Larut (F.M.S.) went to registration in
March, 1914. with a paid capital of £50,000,
of which £32,500 was subscribed by the
public. It was not until the close of 1916
that the co. got its Ruwolt dredge into
operation at Taiping: it had been a much
more costly business than had been antici-
pated, and the directors had to borrow about
£13,000 before tin-winning commenced.
Since then Larut has had a wonderful time
in boom markets. During the three years
to December 31 last its net earnings
amounted to nearly £130,000, of which
£101,250 was distributed by way of divs.
and shares in other cos. (Kota and Tupai),
to which it had subscribed. This repre-
sents 40s. 6d. per £1 share which holders
have received in cash and scrip in promis-
ing new shows. Already this year a further
4s. per share (£lo,oooi has been distributed.
Besides these dividend performances Larut
has worked off its early debt, set aside
£18,740 for mine amortization and plant
depreciation and spent about £lO,OOO in
acquiring adjacent ground. With these pur-
chases it has about 13| million cubic yards
ahead of the dredge, or" 14 years’ life at the
present rate of extraction. Last year
887,000 cubic yards were handled for 470 f
tons tin oxide, recoveries working out at
1.191 b. per yard. The co. averaged £143
per ton for its product, £2O less than during
the previous year, and realised altogether
£67,348. Working costs absorbed £27,913,
equal to 7-£d. per yard, 2|-d. of which repre-
sented the cost of repairs and renewals, an
expensive item nowadays. The working
profit was £39,464 (10.8 d. per yard), and
after providing for depreciation of mine and
plant and meeting office expenses, a het
profit of £32,295 remained, equal to over
64 p.c. of paid capital. The directors pro-
pose to put out the 25,000 unissued shares,
present holders receiving one gift share for
every two now held.

Most of the smaller and weakly-financed'
cos. operating on Hampton Plains are en-
deavoring to arouse shareholders to pay calls.
One lot of 56,900 shares in a Block 48
delusion were recently offered at auction in.
Adelaide, but bidders were missing. This
will probably become a general experience,
and then some smart Alick will buy a big
pile of some rubbish, induce the Board to
take an option on a worked-out mine with
a creditable record,' revive the market with a
yarn about taking out a good crushing, and
then slide out with a fat profit. Such
pleasantries have happened before in the
West, and the recent boom has put some of
the old hands in a position to repeat the joke
if they care to.
As sufficient underground labor cannot be
got to keep its mills working at much more
than half their capacity, Kalg'oorlie is look-
ing to Hampton Plains for material. A
woodline running across or near most of
the best-known shows there is expected to
be completed shortly, and already one or
two cos. with an eye on the market are
nibbling at the favorable terms offered for
the treatment of parcels of ore on the
Golden Mile. The cost of handling and rail-
age is estimated at between 12s. and 15s.
per ton, and on this basis it would, for
the present, at any rate, pay to send the
ore away for treatment. Incidentally, this
move would help to sustain interest in the field.
Mt. Monger Prop. (W.A.) produces a list
of high assays obtained at a depth of 40ft.,
so the co.’s chairman declares that recent
developments have shown Mines Department
expert Blatchford’s predictions regarding
the probable value of the mine to be
“entirely wrong,” and adds that the Board
intends to ask the Minister to again send
the official to the field to re-sample and
report. It is very unlikely that the show
has altered its appearance much since
Blatchford saw it. Possibly high values
have been got in rich dabs, but they don’t
make a payable mine. If the directors are
so certain of the show, why trouble about
Blatchford or anybody else? Their best
policy is to proceed with development and
let the mine prove itself.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) treated 105,588
tons ore and large quantities of residues,,
concentrates, etc., last year for bullion valued
at £206,021. Gold premiums gave an addi-
tional £34,508. The year’s profit was
£38,190, which, with the carry-forward of
£23,403, made the P. and L. balance £61,593.
A 2s. div. (£30,000) was distributed. Dur-
ing the year the last of the old debenture
debt of £lOO.OOO was paid off. Chairman
Protheroe Jones is on his way to inspect
the mine, which has been worked for 22 years
and has lost much of its old lustre. In fact,
under existing conditions it is difficult to
make mining operations pay. Deducting
the gold premium last year’s production
gave a net profit of only Bid. per ton. Still,
it is as unfair to consider what the position
would be without the premium as it is to
reckon what it would be without the extra
costs. Both extra value and extra costs
spring from the same general causes.

About 500 Ivalgoorlie tributors recently
asked the Westralian Government to acquire
Boulder Perseverance mine and plant, which
it was stated could be bought for £50,000,
and start business as an ore treater and
royalty receiver. Fully 8000 tons would,
it was estimated, be forthcoming monthly,
and good profits would flow to both parties.
The request was turned down by the Minis-
ter, though he promised to recommend
Cabinet to subsidise on the £ for £ basis if
a local co. was formed to acquire the show.
Kalgoorlie is considering the proposition.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has prospectors
testing some good-looking country on the
Leonora field, and has already taken up
several old shows in another part of that
area. One of these was successfully worked
for several years by a party of miners who
gave up in shallow ground. The co. con-
siders the chances good, and intends under-
taking systematic development.

Briseis (Tas.) is mostly London-owned,
so the record of operations for the 12
months to December 31 last has only just
drifted in, and then unaccompanied by de-
tailed accounts. Last year there was a
heavy fall in production. In the tin drifts
to the south of Krushka Flat the working
area was narrow; to the north, in Ringa-
rooma ground, all material handled came
from the new 1600 ft. diversion cutting; and
Lindesay Clark had one of the Speck’s
worst droughts to contend with. This shows
the tonnages of black tin won during the
past five years: 1915, 382 f; 1916, 466;
1917, 339; 1918, 328; 1919, 180. To date
Krushka Flat has yielded 2,145,100 cubic
yards for 2589 tons concentrates, the aver-
age exceeding 2£lb. per yard. Ringarooma,
where over 2,400,000 cubic yards of over-
burden have had to be removed at a cost
of almost 7Jd. per yard, has given over two
million yards for 393| tons concentrates,
an average of only .441 b. Briseis opened its
last financial year with a P. and L. credit
of £13,840, but, after paying a sixpenny
on the 600,000 £1 shares, closed its accounts
with a debit of £2007. Nevertheless, it
has £6744 of. cash assets in hand, and with
this backing Lindesay Clark continues the
search for new dredging properties. The
Board is indifferent as to their location or
whether they are gold or tin. When work
on the Wallace gold show in Vic. proved un-
payable the co. had a look at Gulgong
(N.S.W.), but passed by. Tin areas in
New England and gold shows in the south
of the State have since been examined, but
nothing of any value has been found. The
co. at present has its eye on a Victorian
property, but what and where it is has not
been disclosed.

Surveyor Fraser, of early Briseis fame,
is haying a go at Bi-iseis Central (Tas.).
This is the show over which Langford, the
Northeys and Bob Turner joined hands dur-
ing the Briseis boom. Metal was recovered,
hut costs were too much in the poor tin
market of those days, so the lease lapsed.
Now Fraser is putting in fluming, cleaning
out races and getting ready for syphoning
water on to the claim level; so it should
not be long before he is sluicing out the
upper drift. It takes a lot of faith to
believe that the Central has a dividend in
it, but Fraser has the faith and the backing
necessary to give the old derelict a chance.
Tasmania is a bit excited over the alleged
discovery that some coal from Preoleena
district, at the top end of the island, has
given a test which beats the best gas and
coke product of Newcastle. As nothing
better than good household fuel has been
hitherto unearthed in Tas., every bit of gas
coal and most of the steam coal has to be
dragged from N. S. Wales. If, as
officially asseverated, the Preoleena product
is right as to quality, and if, as unofficially
alleged, the quantity is beyond question, the
Speck is on a good thing, and the matter
of a few miles of tramway to link the local-
ity with the railway is not likely to meet
with a'ny serious obstacle in Parliament.
Plant having been adjusted and water
having been brought in seven miles, every-
thing is now in trim at Standard Molyb-
denite (Vic.), and the mill is eating into
the 1100 tons of 4 p.c. ore in the dump pre-
paratory to being fed from the face of No.
1 cut, where 2000 tons of 5 p.c. stuff awaits
breaking. There are three other cuts in the
hill whence ore can come, and it will de-
pend on further exploration at these points
and at No. 1 cut how long the Standard
boom continues. It looks to be a promising
youngster, though shareholders have been
backward putting up funds to do exploratory
work. So far £7384 has been expended, of
which £3959 was paid up by shareholders,
£1415 has been borrowed and the balance
has been provided by the sale of concen-
trates. The 18 months’ campaign closed
with a small profit, notwithstanding an un-
favorable metal market and the worst
drought the district has experienced.

The Oaks goldfield is one of the very few
in the Northern State which have not gone
under to high costs. It has a remarkable
record to its credit: notwithstanding all
troubles caused by the war it has been able
to make 2£dwt. stuff pay expenses.
During the past six years the miner’s daily
wage has increased from 12s. 6d. to over
19s. per day, and that is just about the limit
of strain the low-grade field can stand. Some
months ago the Oaks mine added five stamps
to its 10-hd. battery to try to ovei'come some
of the difficulties besetting it; but recent
additional costs threaten to swallow all the
gold won by the extra stamps. During the
10 years Arthur Clarke has been running
the field his backers have put up £50,000
to develop the big deposits, and the whole
of the gold winnings, well over another
£50,000, have gone into the workers’ pockets,
with never a taste for shareholders.

From a North Queensland tin-buyer:—
That Cooktown mine-manager (B. 24/6/’2O) who
realised £257 locally for his black tin when the
London quotation was £4OO was getting a remark-
ably good price, because if his concentrates went
70 p.c. tin they were then worth in London only
£23 more. It takes nearly £lO a ton to bag and
ship oxide to an Australian smelter and get the
proceeds back to North Queensland. Add three
months’ interest at, isay, 6 p.c., to put the metal
on the London market (£4), there would remain
£9 to cover smelting, smelting loss, overseas
freight, London exchange and London charges, to
say nothing of market risks and a living wage and
assay costs to a local cash buyer of, at best, a
20-ton monthly output.
The Cooktown miners overlook that their product
is not tin, but a mere mass carrying more or less
of the, metal which is quoted in the London market.
Certainly there is no need to foist another Gov-
ernment smelter on the public; there is one already
at Irvinebank capable of treating a dozen Cooktown
outputs.

“Gouger” (North Queensland) : Ore
buyers have occasionally a stroke of luck.
One of them always offered a friend of mine
liberal terms for his tin concentrates. It
took my friend just four years to find out
that his concentrates were rich in gold. Out
on the Normanby the Chows used to stream
and bag the tin concentrates for the white
miners in return for the specks of gold in
the tin. I wonder how many fortunes we
fatheads gave to Germany when we sold her,
yearly, thousands of tons of metal concen-
trates of all descriptions. Not only gold, but
platinum, bismuth, etc., were mixed in small
quantities among the ore we sold. The Hun
extraction plants must have laughed up
their sleeve for years.

Mining-engineer J. R. Darley on the
Bowen-Mackay (Q.) hinterland:—
I quite agree with the “Wild Cat’s” opinion
(B 24/6/’2O) of the possibilities of the old Nor- 1
manby field. In fact, there is a vast tract of
scrub-clad country reaching from Normanby in an
unbroken line right to the old Mt. Britten field,
south-west of Mackay, which is worth attention.
Mt. Britten was discovered about 1882 by Jim
Heenan, and the Eungella, Bee Creek and Emu
Plains fields by Dick, Fred and Jack Barker, the
station-owners. Dick Barker taught himself assay-
ing, and was the real pioneer of the whole hinter-
land. Fred Barker, now Crown Lands ranger, put
in solid work and a lot of money in developing
the country. Dick and Jack are both dead, and so,
too, is Jim Heenan; and with them has perished
much valuable information regarding hundreds of
formations they had found and tested in the scrub-
clad wilderness between Plevna station and the
old Normanby field. The Barkers spent thousands
in this mineral zone; Mt. Barker, the Orchid, Lady
Norman, Lifeboat, Coral Tree, Welcome Dick,
Evelyn, King Solomon, Tent Hill, Little Wanderer,
etc., were all manned by Barker money.
The area of mineral country thereabouts is about
60 miles long by 15 miles wide, and the minerals
found on it in the old days were tin, bismuth,
cobalt, nickel, gold, silver-lead, wolfram and molyb-
denite. It is a fine field for any prospectors with
solid backing and the courage to face the scrub-
land. I know; for I was the first to penetrate this
zone from St. Helens, and, leaving Mt. Britten and
Normanby out, was the first to strike mineral on
the headwaters of Boongatalgai, Uranah, Starva-
tion and Grant creeks in the days when the blacks
were a danger to the careless fossicker.

There is quite an old-time flavor about
the form in which approval is given to the
ATc. Electricity Commissioners’ £3,000,000
scheme for developing the State’s coalfield at
Morwell and supplying current to Mel-
bourne. The rigmarole ends by stating that
approval “is hereby evidenced and recorded,”
and the Electricity Commissioners and all
others who may be concerned are bidden “to
take notice and govern themselves accord-
ingly.”


THE WAY OUT.
“Union coal-lumpers and seamen refused to handle any ship employed to deport Father Jerger.”
HUGHES: “All we have to do is to disguise this poor fellow as a good Australian, and then the unions won’t mind getting rid of him a bit.”

Frank Anstey’s voice is missing from the
roar of Labor denunciation of the War Pre-
cautions Act, but no one has a better right to
roar. He was the only
Labor Representa-
tive who opposed the
bill when Hughes
brought it down. Pre-
dicting that it would
be an engine of despot-
ism, he fought it clause
by clause, but made no
impression except on
W. H. Irvine, who ad-
mitted that Anstey had
put up a good case. His
fellow-Laborists merely
laughed at him, as they
laughed at him in 1913
when he said that the
Fisher Government
was marching to its
Sedan. A prophet has
no honor in his own
party, and Anstey has
never been included in
a Labor Ministry. But
the Whigs left Burke
out of their Cabinets.
COMMENDATORE
GROSSARDI, the
new Italian Consul-
General for Aus-
tralasia.
Death has ended A. O. Sachse’s suffer-
ings. He was a Toowoomba (Q.) man, and
had an adventurous career in the East
Indies before he settled down in Victoria
as a staid engineer and patents attorney.
At 2_, being then a consulting engineer to
the British North Borneo Company, he led
an expedition against slave-dealers and
pirates, and a gratified Sultan made him a
Prince of Brunei. And after that romantic
episode he existed for 28 years as a member
of Victoria’s House of Troglodytes.
Jack Howe, of Blackall (Q.), has shorn
his last sheep. His tally of 321 with the
blades at Alice Downs still stands as a
record, although scores of slick machine-
shearers have had a go at it. A splendid
figure of a man and a good all-wool Austra-
lian was Jack Howe.
A cool customer was Alexander Lee, who
stretched a rope at Adelaide on July 15. He
ate an enormous breakfast, and when the
executioners, father and son, were fixing him
for the last act, he winked at one of the
warders. He was more composed than the
warder. The warder didn’t wink.
John Harding, who was “Jacky” Fisher’s
bugler on the China station half a century
ago, is now a liftman \vith a Melbourne
firm of stationers, and secretary of the
China Veterans’ Assoc, in his spare time.
Thomas Russell, who died the other day
in Essex (Eng.), at 92, was the last of the
original Russells, pioneer squatters in the
Western District of Victoria. Thomas re-
presented Grenville in the Assembly from
1868 to 1873, and brother Philip had two
terms in the Council.
That prim maid, Miss Peggy Ward Cole,
has addressed a petition to Lieut.-Governor
Irvine protesting in dignified terms against
the disturbance of the repose of her dad,
George Ward Cole, who is buried in the
family vault in the old Melbourne Cemetery.
The much - neglected
burying-ground hap-
pens to be next door
to Paddy’s market,
and as it is wanted
for extensions the
bodies have to go.
Miss Peggy reminds
his Ex. that her
father was a member
of the House of Land-
lords from 1859 to
1879, and was
McC ull o c h’s
honorary Minis-
ter from ’65 to
’6B. But nothing
is likely to be
done to oblige Miss
Cole, as Parliament
has twice upheld the
proposal to have a
resurrection day.
CONSIDINE,
M.H.R. for
Broken Hill.
Major Kenneth Maclaine, just arrived in
Australia, is a dinkum Scottish chief with a
family tree whose roots can be traced almost
to the Garden of Eden. The estates at Lock-
buie are mortgaged to the hilt, and the canny
Scot is following in Lauder’s vaudeville
footsteps in order to drive the wolf from the
haggis. Maclaine is a Mons veteran who
won the 33rd M.C. of the war and was twice
wounded. In February last, arrayed in all
his Hielan’ finery, he wedded a sister of Lady
Constance Stewart-Richardson, the society
dancer whose baxe feet made London dizzy a
few years ago. The Chief, who took tea
(or it may have been whisky) at Adelaide
Government House immediately on arrival,
comes to Australia with a Fuller contract
and Dorothy Brunton’s blessing.
A man in the show business:—
If there was an R. S. Smythe there would be no
Ryrie, Assistant Minister for Defence. The Much
Travelled would have had the old Brig, on the plat-
form as the most unorthodox lecturer in captivity.
At Sydney Royal he supplied the talk accompanying
the Palestine pictures, and incidentally got a
£5OOO writ for alleged slander. Occasionally the
Brig, wandered away from his subject to give vent
to his personal feelings. Going back a war or two
he waxed enthusiastic about the spot where Uriah
went to the front of the battle. “Poor old Uriah
took David’s message, you know,’’ said the Brig.,
“and, well, you know, the poor old chap couldn’t
read and well, he got all that was coming to him,
and then King David married his widow. I felt
real sorry for old Uriah as I stood by the walls
where he had his last go. Poor old Uriah! I
thought I might find his hat or something.” And
he could tell any number of Gallipoli yarns. In
the trenches after a day of Hell he was picking
his way in the dark, doing his darnedest to avoid
stepping on the sleeping Diggers. Eventually, he
made a wrong move, and a body crunched beneath
his 20-stone. From the darkness came the complain-
ing voice of a Digger who an hour or so before
had fought like a tiger: “That’s right, that’s right!
Trample a man to death!”
The reaper has gathered in two of
Hobart’s ancients. C. D. Haywood, the big
biscuit maker, prominent for many years
on Hospital Boards and Benevolent Society
committees and the like, was 78 and
died in harness. The other funeral was that
of George Kerr, the founder of a firm which
has been selling good calico for half a century
or so, and a highly respected pillar of Chal-
mers kirk. Both had worn the Mayoral robes
of the city with dignity.
“Margaret L.”: A Bulletin paragraphist
lately recalled the popular story in which
“Mint Sauce” Jones addressed a hostile
meeting as “Gentlemen of Ballarat and
savages of Bungaree.” No doubt Jones took
credit for the story; but the man who
really started off his speech that way was
the late Townsend .McDermott, lawyer and
politician.
Matthew Nathan, who will shortly suc-
ceed his Excellency Bill Lennon in Queens-
land, belongs to the tribe that his name
suggests, and he will be Australia’s first
Jewish Governor. There is a certain grim
irony in selecting Queensland as the scene of
the precedent. It is the sort of thing Henry
Labouchere would have done if he had been
Secretary of State for the “Colonies.”
When Jack Swift died at Johannesburg
(S. Africa) last month, an enterprising and
intrepid Australian passed out. Born near
Mudgee (N.S.W.) 50-odd years ago, he soon
forsook the plough-handles to acquire the
trade of carpenter. Shortly he and his
kit-bag had been in every place of import-
ance in Australia, including Port Darwin. -
Before the end of the ’eighties he could say
the same about S. Africa. He was one of
the first whites to reach and camp at Bulu-
wayo, Lobengula’s old royal kraal site, and
when the British South Africa Co.’s forces
arrived in ’93 they found a builder on the
spot ready to construct the Matabeleland
capital. His motto as a kiddy was “a gold
chain or a wooden leg.” He won the gold
chain several times over, but generally kept
too busy to get much entertainment out of it.
The prophecy that if you don’t wear a
collar and a tie you won’t go to Heaven
when you die has no terrors for Dr.
Maloney. He spoke on the want of confi-
dence motion in the Reps, with a white
sweater where his shirt-front used to be.
When Father Jerger’s lady friends raised
Cain in the House of Reps, it was Mrs.
Jenny Baines, the little dark-eyed red-
flagger, who hopped into the country-press
box and threw a “bomb” at Hughes. A
dare-devil member handed it to an attendant,
who said a prayer and passed it on to a
constable. The law opened it and found—a
broadsheet appeal for Justice.
“To Po”: There’s a sequel to that “Savages
of Bungaree” yarn. When Duffy came up
to a banquet in later ye&rs, he prefaced his
speech with “Gentlemen of Ballarat”-
The crowd shuddered as Duffy deliberately
paused. Then, with a twinkle, he con-
tinued “and noblemen of Bungaree.” That
got the roar of laughter he had worked for.
N. S. Wales has now seven real life-
sentence men in its gaols. The one who
has been in longest is William John Phillips,
the Willoughby child-ravisher and murderer,
who was the first man to be spared the
gallows through the aversion of a N. S.
Wales Labor Government to capital punish-
ment ; and the most recent additions are
Worrall, the policeman, and Mackay, con-
victed of rape, who were saved from the
rope by the anti-hanging policy of the
Storey administration. Phillips was sen-
tenced in 1910; like all the “lifers,” he is
still quite a young man.
It had to come. In a burst of rapture
Adelaide Advertises described the Prince as
“probably” the handsomest young man in
South Aus. when he was there.
There’s nothing in a name. ' A Macleay
River (N.S.W.) grazier has left the bulk
of an estate worth £120,000 to the Repatria-
tion Fund in trust for N. S. Wales Diggers.
And the will was made by German Verge.
“S.T.S.”: A flower on the grave of lately-
dead Bogue Luffman. Some congenial spirits
rowed up the Yarra one Sunday. In my boat
was an awful bore on the subject of trees;
he described the species, habits, diseases and
commercial value of every green thing we
passed. After what seemed an unending
afternoon we got out and walked to Heidel-
berg. “You were lucky,” said Latouche
Armstrong, of the Library, who had been in
another boat; “you had Bogue Luffman
with you. Delightful talker, isn’t he?” I
could answer nothing for astonishment; but
at the jolly informal meal which followed,
the bore opened out and kept the table in a
roar with stories of his lecturing adventures
and the strange characters he had met.
Getting next him on the return journey by
train, I struck a third aspect of his mind, a
wide and deep knowledge of books, and we
did not part till late that night at the Age
office, where he had to deliver a column of
agricultural notes —the first aspect again.
Of a fourth, wide foreign travel, I heard
only afterwards.
From an old friend and colleague:—
In his will Dr. G. E. Morrison gave directions
for the education of his two sons; and, considering
the family’s long connection with Geelong Gram-
mar and his own obligations to it, some people are
surprised that he didn’t send them this way for
part, at least, of their training. Those who knew
Morrison won’t be so surprised. But it was very
difficult to know him. He was so erratic and con-
tentious you could never be sure what his mind
was on any subject. Except as to the Japanese—
he had only one opinion about them. He was a
great man, but partly for the reason I have men-
tioned very lonely in his greatness. In the strenu-
ous fight for power and influence he won his goal,
but he completely lost touch with the emotional
side of life. Among his multitude of acquaintances
in high places there are probably few whose hearts
will be really sore; yet for these he neglected the
ties of family till their love grew cold. In some
ways he reminded me of Goldsmith’s Citizen of
the World. He had no country and no religions He
succeeded in chilling his own soul.
ALEX. McCUBBIN. the energetic young
Melbourne publisher.
“Exul” tells a wicked story:—
Since Prof. “Jimmy” Wilson is shortly due to
leave Sydney Uni., I aln no longer afraid to tell the
story. I had taken an arts degree in classics at
a University where the Continental pronunciation
was insisted on. (It isn’t, or used not to be, at
Sydney.) Jimmy’s “vivas” in anatomy were justly
reckoned the biggest. snags in the whole med. course.
In the second year exam. I shuddered into the awful
presence in the manner of a shaken blanc-mange.
After a couple of questions Jimmy asked me to
identify a structure which had a long Latin name.
In my nervousness I used the pronunciation I had
been brought up on. Jimmy noticed it at once.
He wished everybody would use it. He didn’t know
it himself, which was a nuisance when conversing
with anatomists of other nations. Could I give him
any reasons for believing it to be probably nearer
to the Ciceronian pronunciation than the so-called
English method? I could and did—at considerable
length. (This was much better than anatomy.)
Then the bell went, and I was released. My delight
at evading the real exam, subject was short-lived.
I was almost immediately recalled to the torture-
chamber. • Horrors! Jimmy had discovered my tac-
tics. But, no; he had a classical grammar in his
hand and merely wished to confirm me on a point
on which I had been doubtful. Next year Dr. Palmer
examined me in the anatomy “vivas.” I deliber-
ately tried the dodge on him. It worked. But
Greek was the subject he was interested in. For-
tunately that morning he had been reading Jeremy
Taylor, and had come across a quotation from Homer.
Could I translate it? I did, and we had a nice little
chat about Homer with a dissected corpse between
us. Then the bell went again and I was free. I
got honors in each exam. Now will “Mirza” (B.
22/7/’2O) say that Latin is useless in the medical
course ?
“Copabella” : Victoria can - show a closer
link with old Thomas Carlyle than that
claimed. by Westralia through the Irvings
(B. 8/7/’2O). John Fairbairn, who was for
30 years works inspector in the Western
District and retired last year, was a son of
the Sage’s first cousin. This Fairbairn’s
son, a bank-accountant, is therefore Thomas
Carlyle Leslie Fairbairn.
A snapshot from the Gallery:—
Joe Cook seems, to be losing his hold on his
tongue. During the recent useless no-confidence
argument his provocative jabs at the Opposition
invariably doubled the uproar, and again and again
compelled the Speaker to correct him. Once he
went on interjecting- after the Speaker had roared
repeatedly for order, whereupon Johnson declared
that if he could get no assistance from the Minister
in maintaining decorum he would have to seriously
consider his position. The notion of Johnson risk-
ing £l9OO a year and various agreeable perks on a
small matter of discipline was highly humorous,
but, all the same, the threat had the effect of slow-
ing Cook down and bringing him to his feet in a
model apology. His gift for disturbance, how-
ever, will soon get him into trouble again. He
simply can’t be quiet. When his colleagues sit
unmoved under criticism he yelps away, apparently
under the delusion that his bark is a bite.
The Speaker of the House of Reps, re-
gards the knighthood conferred upon him
“not. only .as a recompense for his own
public service, but as a recognition of the
status of the Commonwealth Parliament.”
But why drag himself in at all? A House
shows disrespect for itself if it elects a
Speaker who is not highly respected; con-
sequently every occupant of the Chair ought
to deserve knighthood as long as titles are
regarded as fair marks of distinction for
high official persons. Whether it be wise
to accept any such incentive to snobbery is
another matter.
FIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I knew how good it was to dream,
How splendid still to fight and strive
With main and might against the stream,
When I was five.
1 nursed a hopeless passion when
More years had tossed me in their spate,
So learned to pity other men,
When I was eight.
1 trudged through dead illusions or
With broken spirit turned to delve
In barren soil; I ached for war
When I was twelve.
I had a stalwart friend or two,
And stalwart enemies a-plenty,
No lack of things to dare and do,
AVhen 1 was twenty.
Clouds lowered in a glooming sky
Of smoky fire obscure and dirty,
And on the brink of Hell stood I
When I was thirty.
But all things pass (the sauciest quean
Is not for ever tart and haughty),
I marked some fat among the lean
When I was forty.
I’d caught Dame Fortune by the skirt
(A slim dame, very slick and nifty),
So she could do me little hurt,
When I was fifty.
And now I’m happy, joyous, free,
And glad—so glad!—to be alive.
Bones age; but, ah! the heart of me,
The heart is five.
N.S.W,
FRANK MORTON.

The STUDEBAKILR Keeps down
running-expense and upkeep-cost
IN these days, the car which is light on tyres and petrol and economical by reason
of its sturdiness and freedom from trouble bulks larger and larger in the
estimation of the public. No need to tell any motorist that petrol is a heavy
item. No need to ask any man’s opinion of the car which gives a liberal mileage
to the gallon.
Here is one of many recorded instances of Studebaker petrol-economy. A fleet of
nine Studebaker cars used for private hire (an exacting service!) returned during
a fair period of trial the fine average of over twenty-two (22) miles to the gallon.
Some of the cars gave as high as 24-25 miles per gallon—none lower than 19-20
miles.
This is astonishingly good. Here we have, not the isolated achievement of some
particularly favored car, but the fine average performance of a fleet of nine cars,
operating under conditions of hard, everyday service.
Studebaker Special Features
The famous Silent L-Head Engine; the newly-designed Gear-box,
swung on a Sub-Chassis amidships; the Double Thermoid Coupling
Forward; the Hotchkiss Drive; the Silent Spiral Bevel Differential;
Scientific Weight Distribution and Spring Suspension; Magneto

MAKING THE PACE TOO HOT.
“A message from Paris states that Dr. Steinbach,
a Vienna scientist, has rejuvenated several old men
by treatment of their interstitial glands. Similar
treatment of women has failed, and the wives of
Dr. Steinbach's patients are bitterly resentful.”
ELDERLY SON ( to rejuvenated father) :
“Come on, dad, mother sent me along to
tell you you’ve got to come home.”
DAD: "Righto, my son—just two more
jazzes and I’ll he with you.”
‘ North Terrace”: The Prince was never
so near to being kidnapped as he was among
the churches of Adelaide, of all places. It
was because of the eternal University row
between the seniors and the juniors. The
Uni. was, as usual, going to make itself
cheap by giving him a degree, and the under-
grads. were excluded from the Elder Hall.
Long ago they were so rowdy that admission
was denied them on state occasions, and
latterly they have not seemed to want it.
Now that they did want it custom was
found to have allotted all the space to the
vastly-increased body of graduates and their
ladies. At the last moment some of the
bolder spirits claimed that the Prince should
be made an undergraduate before he could
become a graduate. The offhand ceremony
proposed meant forcible seizure; but Gov-
ernor Weigall and Chancellor Murray hap-
pen to be popular with the students, and
were able to get the idea dropped. So the
undergrads, had the lawns outside the hall,
and gave the Prince a warm welcome both
before and after the short official business
inside. He didn’t tell them in precise words
that his sympathies were all with them; but
he let them see it, and spent twice the time
with them that he did with the crowd inside.

“Jas. S.” : The Prince of Wales isn’t going
to Kabaul, and the natives thereabout will
always think of him as some sort of ogre.
In preparation for his visit 500 fowls were
being got together from villages near and
tar, apd it took some doing. The head of
one village, who had seen his little hoard of
poultry disappear, confided his views to me.
My word, this-fellow piccaninny belong big-
fellow king he kai-kai too much. He-e-e big

£ he , re ’ s a bigger question
at the back of the 1 ather Jerger row: what
is to be done with the German missionaries
in the mandate territory? Of the 258 white
members of mission staffs in the ex-German
possessions, 221 are Germans, and so far
they are carrying on as usual. Bishop
Couppe a Frenchman himself, who has been
at the head of the Mission of the Sacred
Meart for 80 years, urges that the whole
thing will go to pieces unless he can keep
his Germans and import new ones for at
least 10 years. He affirms that mission-
aries cannot be obtained from France owing
to the terrible losses during the war, the
h rench priest not being exempt from mili-
tary service, while the training colleges in
Germany are “overflowing with students.”
Ihe Bishop is satisfied that his Germans
will consider only their spiritual mission
and be loyal to the Australian administra-
tion. Judge Murray, the chairman of the
Commission which Australia sent to the
islands, accepts this view, and considers that
k^ e “ n r s should stay, but Atlee Hunt
and Walter Lucas are just as emphatic about
the necessity for shifting them. The Federal
i Proposes to twiddle its thumbs and
let things slide until, at any rate, it gets
the formal mandate.

Broncho”: While The Bulletin’s
Gamel Corps correspondent was entertain-
ing the dry horrors from exhaustion, I was
having my lot with the Fifth Light Horse.
The night before the
day we pulled up just
out of Amman was one
never to be forgotten.
Tired and hungry, wet
as shags and cold as
death, we rode all night
in inky darkness
through miles of enemy
country. Towards
morning I felt as if
I was carrying all the
ammunition for the
column on my shoul-
ders. The pain ran
up the sides of my neck
and then fastened
claws at the back of
my eyes and jagged
them. Stars twinkled
in front; imaginary
camp-fires showed up,
with stockmen sitting
around and pack-
saddles and billycans
lying about. Then
darkness and more
stars, grey horses and
ba 1 d-faced bullocks.
Daylight came soon
after that lot, and we
camped for the day;
the rain cleared for a while, and after an
hour’s sleep in the warm sun the horrors
left.

‘‘Pampero” : The allegations attributed to
Father Jerger about the conditions at Holds-
worthy camp receive no support from the
newspaper published by the internees or,the
photographs they took. One internee worked
hard with his camera, and with the permis-
sion of the Commandant had a little booklet
made showing camp views and scenes,
reckoning that the internees would buy it
to send home to Germany as a Christmas-box.
But a lot of them met and decided that it
showed things in too rosy a light, so they
boycotted it. Whereupon the Commandant,
a wily old bird, bought up a good stock and
sent copies to the next-of-kin of the various
internees, who got a shock when sheaves of
letters began to roll in thanking them for
the lovely present they had sent to Hans
and Gretchen at home.

Never has Adelaide hanged a man with

account of the festivities did not seem
decent, and a respite may, according to cus-
tom, almost be taken as a preface to com-
muting the sentence. So the execution hap-
pened on the due date, but without any
more, newspaper publicity than the bare
mention. (Incidentally, half a dozen press-
men were saved an early-morning appoint-
ment which they always loathe.) The pub-
lic had nothing to say—it was so hateful a
crime. But the Labor party put in a more
or less formal protest on the ground that it
objects to capital punishment, and the Build-
ing Trades’ Union recommended “a general
stop-work holiday” on any future execution
day, as a protest. It is the oddest excuse
for making holiday that even Australia has
yet produced.

“8.H.”: The Prince’s party was swelled
by one during the long run east from Kal-
goorlie. The extra A.D.C., who “jumped
the rattler” at the goldfields, rode on the
undercarriage of a coach until it was well
under way. Then he gained the roof un-
noticed. Not finding this up to much he
descended to the footboard and, seeing the
door of a lavatory marked “Ladies Only”
at the end of the carriage, he concealed him-
self therein, “snipped” the door and travelled
quite undisturbed to Port Augusta, 1100
miles.

“S.S.”: There was a great rumpus near
the Melbourne Town Hall yesterday evening
and a crowd quickly assembled when it was
discovered that a tall man in a temperance
suit of all black, and wearing teetotal whis-
kers, was chastising a gay semi-drunk—one
of a party of roysterers—with a flapping
brolly. The young man was taking his cas-
tigation in the greatest good humor, while
the ineffective weapon fell harmlessly upon
his shoulders. The tall man in the Recha-
bite coat explained with righteous ferocity:
“This scoundrel kissed my wife! He just
walked up to her here in the street, and
kissed her.” “Yes, he did,” shrilled a, gaunt
lady, with a face a little like a defective
iron moulding, “and I never saw him before
in my life.” Her shrill grief inspired the
husband to more violent efforts with the
gamp. “I’ll teach you to kiss my wife!”
said he. Then the portly cabman cut in. It
was no business of his, but you know what
cabmen are. “Garrt!” he 'snorted. “You
can’t hurt him with that. Make him kiss
her again!”
* * * *
“Ex-Dig” : It has been revealed that 3076
death sentences were passed on Tommy
soldiers and that 343 were carried out —18 of
them for cowardice and 266 for “desertion.”
Unquestionably many poor devils executed
for these “crimes” in the early part of the war
were really neurasthenia and shell-shock
casesand one suspects that the figures are
not complete. In a case which caused dis-
cussion because the victim happened to be
influentially connected there was no trial: the
man was summarily shot by an officer who
judged that the youngster was showing the
white feather. A subsequent court of in-
quiry justified him. Dozens of officers
broken for cowardice afterwards made good
in other regiments, and every soldier can re-
count instances of men* decorated for
gallantry on the battlefield getting the wind
up in subsequent actions, because the human
machine had been overwound and had run
down.

“® en Trovato”: The accountant to a big
Melbourne firm that has been profiteering
m bucks (or it may be rabbits) helped him-
self to £2OOO of the firm’s money and laid
the defalcations carefully on the top like the
dagoes do their best fruit, Galled upon to
explain,,, and having done so, he was threat-
jne j w ith prosecution. Promptly he pro-
duced a small phial and poured out its con-
tents—-one pilule. “This,” he said, “is
cyanide of potassium, and I’ll take it if you
don t cry off. Then you will lose vour
money and cause my death.” The evildoer
was told to get out of the country at once,
which he did. Now the firm is wondering
whether the pill was cyanide or one of Dr.
Morse’s. Another malefactor was short

also to offer £2OOO cash to square it, on
condition that no proceedings were taken.
Hi.s employers agreed, accepted the £2OO0 —
and he left for parts unknown with a £lOOO

in each of the foregoing cases.

FIXING THE PRICES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The present boom in ‘sales’ is possibly an indica-
tion that prices may be reduced.”— Daily paper.
The pockets flap wide open to the street,
Worn with much dredging of their emptiness,
While Penury and Pride make haste to meet
And re-arrange the compromise ,of dress.
Bald-headed with the worry of the time,
The shopman rubs his shiny top in doubt;
And Martha notes the figures, hints at crime
And makes a grand resolve to do without.
But yesterday all blessings filled the cup
Of him who set his tufted rags a-row,
For every moment sent the prices up
And none dare say how high they yet would go.
Now, in the winter pale of discontent,
The shy birds answer not the fowler’s call;
The boom is over and the cash is spent,
And business dies unless the prices fall.
At least, it looks exceedingly like that.
The general gamble sets us guessing-mad;
Yet none, howe’er he jump upon his hat,
Can tell which way the profits may be had.
Should we reduce the price the tide may ebb
Till we are left as dry as seven o’clock;
If we increase it we may find the web
Of time’s great spider over all our stock.
Fools prattle this and that, but we, the wise,
Have found a happier and a better way—
An old, old way that very gently tries
To meet the public will and make it pay.
Yes, let the prices rise or let them fall,
Our course is clear out of the bitter fix;
We set the writing large upon the wall:
“Reduced from eighteen pence to two and six!”

“Orb”: Some people have queer ideas about
Sight-seeing. Tlio other day I asked a Renown
officer what had struck him most during his
eventful journey with the Prince. After
earnest thought he decided on this: “In
Canada we went to the Duke of Devonshire’s
place, and, as there wasn’t enough accommo-
dation for all of us, tents were rigged on the
lawn.. It was frightfully cold, and one
morning I saw Mr. Brooks, the photographer,
coming out of his tent carrying a suspicious-
looking tumbler. As he is a notorious tee-
totaller I asked him whaffor. but he only
mumbled something unintelligible. I found
out afterwards that he was on his way to
get some, hot water to thaw out his false
teeth, which had been frozen solid in a glass
of water.” Incidentally, one of the very few
newspaper correspondents who have done the
complete tour confesses that nothing has thus
Aar hit him so hard as the order maintained
by the crowd of thousands that lined up
in a queue to pass in front of the Prince at
the Sydney Town Hall.

Mark Time” : Good old Mick of our bat-
talion had a perpetual thirst, and to satisfy
it he gradually became one of the best
souvenir-hunters I ever met. After every
stunt he would stagger out with a glorious

\Vhen the En Zed Div. went over at Mes-
ses our company happened to be on a
flank, and after we had crossed the first
trench old Mick stopped to do a little busi-
ness with five or six prisoner Huns who
were preparing to stroll back towards our
gun positions. Now, the .Tommy battalion
next door to us was a minute or so behind
us m getting away, and consequently did
not reach the first objective until all of ns
except the casualties and old Mick, were
on the. way to the next one. Thus when a
keen little Woodbine officer came scuttling
along the trench looking for our flank, he
found Mick busily engaged ratting those

Fritzes. He weighed the situation up at a
glance—three dead Huns, five live ones and
a machine-gun, and Mick in the centre of
the tableau, quite evidently boss of the
whole situation. He immediately credited
Mick with cleaning up the possie on his
own, and demanded his name. Mick
modestly supplied the information, and then
toddled off before his benefactor began to
get curious about the rest of his unit. The
little one-pipper must have put up a great
cnse for Mick, because it got past our Old
Man, who knew Mick almost as well as any
of us. When I saw his D.C.M. gazetted

“Water Front”: A
seaman who could
write a book of sea-
stories from his own
experiences came back
to Sydney on the
Australrange. He was
on the barque Burrowa
when she was sunk by
shell-fire and on the
steamer Tyne when she
was torpedoed, and the
trawler on which he
escaped from the Tyne
was mined. After some
other mixed war ad-
ventures he joined

which stood by a ship
in flames —the Olock-
son—one day out from
Port Arthur (Texas)
and the following after-
noon picked up a launch
containing five South
Americans, who had
been drifting for five
days without food or
water. Going to Porto
Chico to drop the res-
cued men, the Carawa
herself became a
wreck, and the crew
spent five weeks on an
island—a penal settle-

their rescue the dis-i-

From a Sydney laboratory
The toughness and longevity of the anthrax bacil-
lus has been well illustrated in a recent case of
that disease at Little Bay Hospital, the infection
having been traced to a shaving-brush that had come
from Japan. Owing to Commonwealth restrictions
no shaving-brushes have been imported from Asia
lately, so the stock from which ,this specimen was
obtained must have been at least years old. But
that makes no difference to the bacillus. Pasteur;
while working in France on this subject, furnished
a patch of ground with anthrax spores. When he
returned 1 1 months later they showed no signs of
decrepitude, but, on the contrary, seemed more
vigorous. The face and hands are the most vulner-
able parts of the body to the poison of anthrax;
so anybody having a brush that doesn’t possess the
character of Caesar’s wife should soak it in a strong
solution of formalin for a week or more. Better
still, get rid of it, and buy one that is provided
with a clean bill of health.
“Harry J.”: She always came into out-
ward in a London hospital empty-handed,
high-heeled and disseminating an air of well-
bred stinginess and the atmosphere of the
law courts. Her cross-examination of wit-
nesses was severe and tedious. Invariably
: S <feu Started off with: “Are you wounded?”
Where are you wounded?” “Where were
you when you were wounded?” To a Digger
who by reason of his wounds had to lie in
what is called in military terms the “prone
position,” the second question was a bit
perplexing. But he answered it. “Well,
it’s this way, miss,” he drawled. “I was
tvounded before on Gallipoli—but it’s just
the opposite with me this time.” The lady
was quite satisfied. So was the Digger. And
all of us within hearing got at least one
ray of cheerfulness from her innumerable
visits.

“Spare Corp”: The Prince’s secretaries
niust be having a busy time. Since the
Renown moved out of Port Jackson, nearly
every Government Department in Sydney
hn.s received proofs that individuals with
grievances have been pouring their troubles
into the princely ear and soliciting his
friendly assistance. And the Heir-Apparent
must be a methodical young man, for,
apparently, each complaint is forwarded on
to the place or person concerned, with an
intimation that H.R.11. will be glad if the
can be investigated. Naturally manv
of .the letters are funny, and so is the
attitude of some of the officials who receive
the feather-crowned missives. The man I
met was bursting with pride. “See that
chap, ’ he observed, pointing out an em-
ployee of the department ; “I had him rein-
stated in accordance with the personal request
of the Prince of Wales. I’ll show you the
Prince’s letter when you come round again ;
I’ve ordered a frame and am going to hang
it on the wall.” But I am looking forward
to the time when the narrative will grow
like a rolling snowball, and my friend will
say, ‘‘Now, just to show you what he’s like,
the Prince dropped in with this fellow
Kobinson, and said ‘Mr. Jones, could you

“Nell T.”: In these days the pedagogue
has to tread delicately. Two of my small
nips persisted in refusing to salute the
Union .Jack or sing “Gojr’save.” Threats
and bribes were of no avail. “We’ll get a
worse iding ’ome if we do,” was the" plea
of the rebels. But I had to carry out the
loyalty drill. Circle and saluting came, and
the two stood up. “Our mother said,”
began Patrick. “Did she say you were not
to hold the flag?” “No,” chorused the two
brothers, eager for our kindergarten honor.
So the Union Jack is daily held aloft by the
two_ junior Sinn Feiners while the loyal
babies salute and chant “Gor’save.” I see
traces of a future Machiavelli in myself.
“Grow” : Australia, it must be feared, is
not as thorough-going in hospitality to a
royal guest as it was half a cehtury back.
An equerry of the Duke of Edinburgh used
to tell of the warm welcome given to that
Prince on an up-country station, by (say)
McTavish. with his handsome wife and
pretty daughters. As the house was settling
down for the night, the wool king—who
traced his descent from Flora MacDonald,
by the way—was observed hovering about
with an uncertain air. Had H.R.11. all he
wanted for the night? They thought he
had. “Weel,” said the good man at last,
“I’m anxious not to give offence. But ye
ken weel that all my household are as loyal
as mysel.’ ”
* * * #
“Sixenate”: Some ordinarily law-abiding
citizens have a queer insurgent streak. Re-
cently a Sydney carrier paid his 46th fine
for breaking the “one-way traffic” regula-
tion. Another man has been 14 times penal-
ised for smashing bottles in the street. A
chap of my acquaintance is punctilious in
paying all his household bills except the
butcher’s ; he never pays a butcher until the
Court compels him. Heaven knows what
his reason is, since his obstinate refusal to
settle up with the butcher always increases
substantially the amount he has to pay. But
an inveterate antipathy to butchers is rooted
in hia soul.
“Eddyson” : Have you heard of the escapade
of two Australian youngsters who broke loose
in London in charge of a whippet tank? They
had been directing the ungainly movements
of this vehicle in some street parade, and
then, hungry for excitement and undetected by
authority, went whirling through the world’s
metropolis, joy-riding in a lumbering vehicle
like a prehistoric hansom contrived of a
dinosaur and a granite boulder. They roared
from pub to pub, and as night came down
and sensations intensified they developed
big ideas. They visited fashionable halls
and theatres, and put large policemen dn
to hold their tank. They tried to elope with
barmaids in their iron express, and might
have been going yet, for all constituted
authority could do with them, had they not
resolved to drop in at a swell restaurant,
feeven other Australians who happened to
be there grasped the situation and took
charge, the tank was returned where it
belonged, and tracks were smothered up so
that nobody was shot.
“Guy Rope” : It cheers me now to remem-
ber it. At Suez the usual filthy Gyppos
brought fruit out to our transport. It was
mostly rotten, and the boys cursed their luck.
Ihen Fortune sent Abdul Hamid. Big, fat,
opulent Abdul, attired in bigb red fez,
stand-up collar, stiff-fronted shirt and oily
smile, sat among his silks and ostrich fea-
thers, while two miserable servitors poked
the water with their oars. The boys lined
the rail with hands suspiciously behind them
as Abdul s barge glided into the shadow of
the ship. Smiling kindly on his huge audi-
ence, Abdul stood up. • “Gentlemens,” he
announced, I have the nice” Smack!
WAYLAID.
"How old are you, dear?”
“Just reached nineteen.”
“Goodness, darling, what detained you?”
A mouldy orange hit him on the forehead,
and the red fez went overboard. Angrily
muttering through his mask of orange-pulp,
he bent over the side to retrieve his floating
headgear. The target was too much for the
boys, and one great avalanche of squashy
“Ujfc smothered the dinghy and precipitated
Abdul into the greasy canal. His servitors
waited not on the order of their going, but
with their master hanging desperately to the
side rowed frantically out of the danger zone.

Possibly Australia’s biggest jumbuck (for
its age) changed hands at Sydney sheep sales this
month. It was named Goliath, aged 31- years, and
its dimensions were: Girth 72in. ; length (to end
of tail), sSin.; height to shoulder, 35in.; width
between eyes, 7in. ; centre of shoulder to centre
of shoulder round chest, 31in. The mite was bred
by Walter Hawker, of Clare (S.A.), and fetched
1500gns. Still, Hawker has got a bigger price
than that. For Hercules (a sort of uncle of
Goliath’s) Austin, of Wanganella, paid him I7oogns.
“Boro-Belle”: The islands along the
North Queensland coast are all blessed with good
crops of cocoanuts now, thanks to the fore-
sight of the Mcllwraith Government some
20-odd years back in having trees planted
to provide food for shipwrecked castaways.
This work was carried out by Captain Grif-
fiths and the crew of the Lizzie Jardine, a
30-ton cutter secured by the Government
for the purpose. Each planting trip used to
occupy three months, and by the irony
of fate the captain and crew were once com-
pelled to subsist on their cocoanut cargo
through the vessel being cast ashore in a
gale and the provisions giving out. Although
in the track of the coastal steamers, the
marooned men had altogether three months
on their water-washed fragment, and their
only tucker for the last five weeks was cocoa-
nut, oysters and fish. The old skipper has
long since gone aloft, but the crew of three
still shy off the fishshops.
“K.8.C.”: In reply to “Belmont’s” in-
quiry (B. 10/6/’2O) as to the cruelty or otherwise
zrst
my experience. I have used this method many
times when a draught-horse and harness were not
available, and have never noticed after-effects of
any kind, good or bad, on the horse. A short piece
of fencing wire (the shorter the better) to lift
the weight off the ground and thus reduce the pull,
tied to both horns (not one as mentioned by “Bel-
mont”) and hooked with a bit of fencing-wire to rhe
doubled hair of the tail, is all the tackling required.
I have never seen a horse that refused to pull with
this rig, or a beast that did not look pleased to get
out. When you finish the job, be careful to get
Dobbin well away before letting the patient up, as
it will invariably charge. The alternative is to
go to camp, anything up to 10 miles, and get your
draught-horse and harness. In the meantime any-
thing may happen. I once found a bogged yearling
with the gnawed shoulder-blades sticking out of
the mangled flesh, and a pair of dingoes slinking
away from their ghoulish feast on their still-living
victim. By the way, this is the only method of
making a jib pull: tie the tail to the axle, release
the traces, and your arrival at your destination is
merely a matter of time.
“T.H.M.”: Anyone know of a larger
pepper-tree than this? On an allotment fronting
the main street of Corowa (N.S.W.) stands an old
warrior who stretches his ears across the whole
width of the 70ft. allotment, and then has some-
thing to spare to hang over the neighboring fences.
He has a girth measurement of 14ft. four feet from
the ground, was planted 35 years ago, and 2000
sheep could comfortably shelter under him.
“Moonie”: The saddest bush tragedy I
know occurred op East Darr station (C.Q.)! A
hut was occupied by two teamsters’ wives, who
in the absence of their husbands on their long trips
lived together for company. Each woman had a
young baby, and one morning one of the babies was
found dead in its cot, death having been caused by
snake-bite. The other child’s mother sought to take
the bereaved mother’s mind from her loss by allowing
her own baby to take the dead child’s place, and
next morning it, too, rvas found dead, presumably
from a bite of the same snake.
* * * .
From G. W. Cobham, of Tallangatta
(Vie,):—
“The Wanderer” (B. S/7/’2O), writing of some
early-clay Australian troopers’ ‘‘tastes,” states that
my late father, a then superintendent of police sta-
tioned at Benalla, flayed the chin of the bushranger
Morgan with the object of making a tobacco pouch
of the skin. The statement is absolutely untrue.
* * * *
Silas Snell”: In a Vic. Western district
township I was told that Gregg’s wife had gone ■ off
with Mclntyre, who had just completed the con-
tract for a local bridge. Of the men in the village
Gregg struck me as the least concerned about • the
elopement. The second night of my stay a cus-
tomer full of beer and refused further supplies grew
offensive and cast things into Gregg’s teeth. Gregg
commented on it afterwards. “But, of course, it is
not true,” said I —-“your wife has not gone off
with this Mclntyre.” Gregg nodded his head know-
ingly. “That’ll be all right. She’ll come back,”
said he. “She’ll be here again in a week or two.
You see, I promised her a month or so in Geelong
the first opportunity.” I was led to infer that Mrs.
Gregg had only seized an opportunity.
* * * *
“Long un”: For over two years a green
frog has made his home on a sideboard in my
house at Ipswich (Q.). He has good points, for
very few insects escape him, and he has also bad
points—in the stillness of the night he has
awakened us by smashing small ornaments whilst
doing patrol. For such an offence the wife at last
pronounced sentence of death on him. I inter-
vened, suggesting that deportation would serve the
purpose. I took him a good distance from the
house on two occasions, and he returned as presump-
tuous as ever. In order to save his life I decided
on a third attempt. I put him in a tobacco tin

"Jim C. ’: I disagree to the extent of
about 15 lurid adjectives with “Luke Thrice” (B.
17/6/’2O) when he says half- and quarter-castes never
show albinism. I have seen more albinos among
hybi ids than I have among full-blooded aborigines.
Some years back, at Beagle Bay (W.A.), there
was a black gin who had two albino children, a boy
and a girl. Their father was a sealer who had
elected to stay there when one of the sealing lug-
gers put in. There were also three albino children
among the blacks at Blue Mud Bay. Their mothers
were full-blooded gins, and their fathers half-caste
Malays from the pearling luggers.
THE OPTIMIST.
“Never mind, mummy, the handle's quite good.”
“14. T.”: The men working at a sawmill
in the Gembrook district (Vic.) were puzzled lately
by the mysterious disappearance of their pipes. The
smoser who put his pipe down on a log was sure to
lose it, and the bereft woodmen remained puzzled
until a falling tree brought down a magpie’s nest
in which there were found five full-flavored briars.
“Camelero”: Anyone want to know how
to stop a dog eating eggs? Dissolve a little caustic
soda in water and put the nest-eggs into the liquid.
Take them out, let them dry, and put back into
the nests. (The soda will not harm the fowls.)
When the poodle takes one of these eggs in his
mouth he will drop it like a hot brick as soon as
the moisture of his mouth begins to dissolve the
soda. I’ll never drink another beer if this remedy
fails.
* *
‘Ragar”: Any other liar ever seen an
albino centipede? I came across one while dropping
an outsize messmate-tree in the hills back of Gympie.
I d cut through to the pipe, and was standing
hack for a breather when out crawled his nibs.
He was as white as a sheet of paper, with no shade
of coloring about any part of him. Otherwise he
seemed normal for that sort of vermin. I didn’t
want him as a pet; so I killed him. He measured
just under the nine inches; no slouch, though I’ve
seen them as big in their ordinary colors. Used to
think that white scorpions were as rare as the
sovereign is to-day, but have since found several of
him. I shared a bed with one once—for about
two seconds. I got up first.
* * * *
“Expert Too”: I’ve been examining what
is possibly a relic of bushranging days. About four
months ago a couple of rabbiters found in a hollow
log on Table Top station, near Gerogery (N.S.W.),
an old muzzle-loading gun with single barrel. The
weapon, now cleaned of dirt, has a very well-pre-
served appearance, and on the stock in half-inch
letters is roughly carved “Morgan, 1864.” The ram-
rod is made of a piece of hardwood, the business-end
of which is wound with wire roughly soldered over.
The bushranger Morgan roamed this country between
Albury and Adelong, and may have secreted the
weapon, but I would prefer to see some signs of
insect attacks on the stock after 50-odd years in
the place where it was found. Another thing,
Morgan met his Waterloo on April 5, 1864, at
Peachaba station, just over the Murray in Victoria.

“Wiri Pile”: Pohipi and Heri Heri
joined the Salvation Army, and both were called
to give their testimonies. Pohipi said: “Kia-ora,
kia-ora, kapai, te Harawation Army. Before I join
te Harawation Army I te wery bad’ man. I hamma
my missus he got te no kai. My pikkaninny he
get te no kai, no gloes. I te wery bad man. Now

mony and started off: “Kia-ora, kia-ora, kapai te

MR. WINKUM : “ The burglar got in through
the bathroom window while Mrs. Win-
kum was — er—under the shower."
MR. KEE-HOLE : “And didn’t Mrs. Winkum
have anything on?”
MR. WINKUM : “Not a stitch! But, luckily,
the burglar was a decent sort and
covered her with his revolver!”
£ fr °m Wm. Hazlett, these days of
Milo (Q.) :
“Budgerigar” (B. 13/5/’2O) says Alf Parsons
erected 505 fencing-posts in a day on a sandhill, and
refers to me for verification. I managed Ambathala
for seven years without finding a sandhill on it
furthermore, Alf Parsons never worked there in
my time. In 35 years’ experience I have never
found a man who could erect even 250 fencing-posts
m a day to my satisfaction.

A QUESTION OF DISTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Prom Sleepyhurst to Pettington is twenty miles by
rail, .
By bullock-dray it might be twenty-four;
But if measured by the vision and the purpose of
a snail
The distance may be something to deplore.
You can walk it in six hours if your boots and
heart are strong ;
In a motor-car it’s forty minutes’ run;
In an aeroplane you do it like the chorus of a song—
You are there before your journey has begun.
But we travel by the railway to a tune of puff and
pause—
A lot of pause to very little puff—
And we feel the whiskers growing on our grim,
determined jaws
As we curse the wheels that will not turn enough.
Those wheels are worn three-cornered by long rest-
ing on the rail
At the little wayside stations year by year;
And the creepers and the mosses on the engine tell
their tale
Of a speed which roving cattje need not fear.
Oh, the world is very narrow! You may cross it
in a stride
At a dozen easy places on the map ;,
But from Sleepyhurst to Pettington it’s very, very
wide,
And old slumber still sits solid in that gap.
Yes, it sits and dreams of going, going very fast
and far,
Dreams of Progress spelt with one tremendous P,
Dreams of hitching up its waggon to a distant,
splendid star—
But a fairly rapid cow would do for me.
We are thinking, thinking always on the problem
of high speed,
And the Minister for Railways ought to know
That Sleepyhurst and Pettington, awakened to their
need,
Will no longer wait and watch the pumpkins grow.
No, we want no narrow distance, for we know it
to our pain,
Though perhaps we cannot realise the worst,
That Pettington, when measured by the motion of
the train,
Is getting farther off from Sleepyhurst.

Delhi ’: Wang” missed the most popu-

“Aloysius”: A popular bush superstition
not yet mentioned is that fleas never go on red
blankets. In Australia I never had the opportunity
of putting it to the test, but bitter experience has
taught me that, as far as Turkish fleas are con-
cerned, red blankets afford no protection. Still, for
the benefit of those who pin their faith to' red
blankets, I am willing to admit that Turkish fleas are
color-blind. In fact, I’ll admit anything at all
about them except that they don’t bite like ravenous
bull-ants.
* * * *
“Nor’-West”: A piece of wood in a
remarkable state of preservation was recently un-
earthed from a tin-prospecting show at Ruby Hill
23 miles west of Emmaville (N.S.W.). In sinking
the shaft the prospectors went through 45ft. of
solid basalt, and bottomed at 90ft. The wood,
3ft. long and sin. in diameter, was found across
the face of the main drive, 70ft. in. In appearance
it was just like an ordinary piece of pine that had
been waterlogged in a creek for a year or two, yet
it must have been there for countless ages. It has
been ascertained that the tree of which the piece
discovered is a limb is closely allied to the modern
hoop or Maryborough pine, and dates back to
the early Tertiary period. The wood is not petrified,
and it quickly disintegrates when exposed to the
air. What sons must have passed since that tree
flourished on the banks of the prehistoric stream!
* * * *
Vista”: Bramble Cay, up at the ex-
treme north of the Barrier Reef and south of the
Gulf of Papua, is one of the hunting-grounds of the
islanders in search of gulls’ eggs. Eggs are to be
found there all the year round, but in the laying
season proper the whole ground is covered with them.
The natives of the surrounding islands, and even of
New Guinea, visit the Cay, go ashore, and clear a
patch of the ground, throwing all eggs away. This
patch is marked with stones, and the following day
the place is visited again, and the new-laid eggs col-
lected. I have had them brought to me by the
kerosene-tinful. At least a dozen different sorts,
including the big, pure-white egg of the booby bird.
THE POOR PARSON.
THE PROFITEER: “What’s the use of talkin’
rot about profiteers? Why don’t you
retaliate and double your price for sav-
ing our souls?"
THE PARSON: "My dear sir, they are so
shrivelled they’re scarcely worth saving
even at the, present rate.”
Gulls’ eggs are good eating if absolutely new-laid,
but are fishy when two or three days old. The
islanders often catch the young boobies and mona-
hawks (frigate-birds); they grow up with the com-
mon barnyard fowls that are found around every
native’s house, and become very tame, a strip of
calico attached to the leg and trailing behind warn-
ing people that they are private property. I have
seen frigate-birds and boobies swoop down and take
sardines from natives’ hands when called.
A GLORIOUS TIME WITH THE PRINCE.
OUTBACK COUKY: “So ye've seen the Prince?”
SWAGGIE : “Seen 'im! Struth! Why, I lest matilda, me ’at and nearly me billy afore
I'd done with ’im."
Kenrie” : This beats Chris' Larsen and
Alf Parsons. In one day two men in this district
planted so many posts that it took them two and a
half days to walk back to their camp.
“Rob Roy”: Here are the facts about a
world’s sheep-shearing record, of which something
has been said already. The 12 shearers, working
on a Westralian contract for Frank Young and Co.,
Adelaide, started on a mob of 59,606 sheep on
April 3, and cut out on May 16, 1919. Total hours
worked, 2291. The highest tally was on April 29,
when the 12 men shore 2954 sheep, an average of
246 per man ; actual working time, seven hours. The
individual tallies for that day were: Sawallish,
321; Brown, 246; Munro, 253 ; Mitchell, 245 ;
Ryan, 158; McLeod, 239; Woodall, 262; Slade’,
233 ; Lehmann, 236 ; Saltmarsh, 258 ; Brooks, 282 ;
Yeing, 211. Sawallish’s performance equals that of
the famous Jack Howe, who shore 321 at Alice
Downs (Q.) some years ago-. The team earned
£849 7s. 6d., or an average of £7O 15s. 6d. per
man net in 38 days, including five days’ lost time
due to wet weather. The machines used were Lister ;
the plant was a 20-stand, driven by an 8-h.p.
engine, but only 12 stands were used.
'* * * *
“South Coaster” : The first and, I think,
only flourmill ever built in the Bega (N.S.W.) district
still stands at the junction of Tathra-road and
Bega-street. It was built by William Kirkwood in
the late ’fifties. The rich flats were then used for
growing wheat instead of maize or Indian corn.
Rust soon attacked the crops, probably owing to
the dampness of the flats; nevertheless a good deal
of flour was made at Kirkwood’s mill. The old
boiler—~by P. N. Russell and Co. —still lies outside
the ruins, now tenanted only by rat's, owls and mice.
Southern Monaro’s record for wheat is little better
owing to late frosts nipping the grain in the bud,
and the Bombala flourmill has long been idle. In that
district, in early days, men stretched a rope across
the small wheat crops, drew it along before sunrise,
and shook off the hoar-frost which did the damage.
“141” : Will some Abo. botanist tell me if
there is any way of distinguishing the male pawpaw
tree from the female before flower comes? The trees
grow for about nine months before flowering, and
then the male trees have to be dug out. They seem
always in the majority too.
“H.C.S.”: How to tell ’em. If when
using his sausage-machine he moves his top jaw,
the lower remaining stationary, then he’s an alli-
gator ; but if he makes <his lower jaw do the work,
then he’s a croc.
“Wind Bag”: Want a big fish? I was
working with a line on a small island down the
river one night lately. Tied the line to a tree
to light my pipe. When I took the line to pull her
in, -! I couldn’t shift her, so I rowed over
to the main camp for help, and, strike me! when we
got back the island was gone.
■‘Boro-Belle” : The crocs, in the Solomon
Islands prefer dog-meat to nigger, any time. Recently
on the Solomon Island rubber plantation, at Ysabel
Island, some boys were camped in the boatshed with
their dog sleeping between them. In the middle
of the night they were awakened by the howls of
the poor brute as it was dragged away by a 10ft.
croc. The nigs, were too scared to attempt a
rescue.

“Mirza” : Various metallic salts can be
(used for clearing muddy water (B. 17/6/’2O),
but I find a solution of ferric chloride (‘‘steel drops”)
the handiest. A country pill-punching friend de-
lighted to bewilder the cookies by pouring a few
ounces of it into their dams, at the same time
chanting some -profanities in Latin. He reckoned
his song aided the process, probably in the way
that the red increases the mystic efficacies of flannel.
Two ounces of ferric chloride will clear a 50,000-
gallon dam in a few hours. It acts in this way.
In muddy water the very small suspended particles
of soil remain apart, because the very small charge
of electricity, with which each is laden repels the
adjacent similarly-charged particle. The opposite
brand of electricity in the steel-drop ions neutralises
the small charge in the clay. The particles then
coalesce, presenting a relatively smaller surface, in
comparison with the weight, than before. When
the ratio of surface to weight diminishes sufficiently
the particles fall to the bottom. The solution can
be used in large quantities in lakes, etc., without
harm to stock.

“Six and Eight”: Almost universally the
aboriginal pronunciation of native place-names has
become corrupted. When Dulhunty
owned Old Dubbo station in the ’six-
ties, he built a house, the high-pitched,
pointed roof of which resembled some-
what a ciown of one of the cabbage-
tree hats affected by the knuts of
those days. From this fancied resem-
blance the abos. called the place
Thubboo, a native word, meaning the
crown of a hat. Later, corrupted to
“Dubbo,” the word became the name
of the present township. Narronrine
is another example. The abo. word
meaning “the place of honey” is cor-
rectly pronounced “Gnar-roo-mime” ;
but few present-day Australians call it
anything but Narrermine.
Ivaree ’: Re “Dolphin's” assertion (B.
24/6/ 20) that the Torres Strait natives got their
mummification methods from Egypt. Isn’t it more
likely that they got them, through Maya navigators,
from Yucatan, which is a bit nearer? The ancient
Mayas employed the same methods as the Gyppos,
even to depositing the brains, viscera, etc., in four
stone jars, which were placed, with the mummy
and statues of the departed, in tombs and small
pyramids, where they are found to this day, the
most famous being Prince Co’s Memorial Hall at
Chichen, wdth its sphinx and mural paintings. It
is a queer thing that the signs and characters of
the Egyptian and Maya writings are exactly the
same, that the monarchs of both countries wore the
same kind of mitre or crown, and that both peoples
had many customs, apart from death, in common.
Dr. le Plongeon, the Yankee authority on antiqui-
ties, who spent 12 years in the Yucatan forests,
advances the theory that Egyptian civilisation sprang
from the Maya, perhaps via India, per the Nagas.
Anyhow, the Gyppos claimed their origin from “the
lands of the western waters,” and the story of Isis
and her brother would seem to have been copied
from that of Prince Co and his sister-wife, Tsin,
as related on the walls of Chichen.
* * * *
“Vincimus”: “FY7,” writing of the
Queensland bottle-tree (B. 17/6/’2O), refers to it
as “a feature of many Western Queensland districts.”
I have been in practically all parts of Queensland
and do not remember seeing the bottle-tree growing
anywhere in the West except as a man-planted orna-
mental tree around station homesteads or in country-
town gardens; and in such situations it does not
reach anything like the development that it does in
its natural situation, the coastal scrubs, where I
have seen it 25ft. round the stomach. I have had
many cut down, but have never found one to contain
free water, although it might be possible to obtain
water from it by crushing its pithy “wood.” I
suggest that the axe-cuts seen by “FY7” are the
result of curiosity on the part of those who wished
to see how far they could bury an axe in its soft
trunk. I have always noticed that the scrub wal-
labies have a great feast of the “wood” of one newly
felled.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: Character and color in both
plants and animals are tricky things. It has been
found at Werribee (Vic.) that a cross between
Indian H. and Jonathan wheats gives every time a
grass-like plant which probably resembles the com-
mon ancestor of a few tens of thousands of years
ago, from which all the hundreds of varieties of
wheat have been evolved. Other crosses with
Indian wheat give very much this result some-
times, but in the case of these two the average
is 100 per cent. Why no one yet knows. With
regard to color in cattle, the late Robert Clarke, a
noted Vic. breeder, used to boast that he could
breed white cattle at any time he pleased. His
method was to mate a bull of one color with a
cow of another, neither of them being white, and
he claimed that in every instance the calf was
white. And while black sheep are seen often
enbugh, those breeders who have tried to build up
a black flock by using black rams and black ewes
have always failed.

“202”: “Barcoo” (B. 20/5/’2O) says
the Mt. Enniskillen herd ruined the reputation of
more drovers than any other in Queensland. It was
an alleged drover in the early days who for a time
ruined the reputation of those cattle. Since then, on
the few occasions that a mob with that brand has
given any trouble, the cattle have always been
blamed, when nine times out of ten it was the fault
of the drover or his men. Since the middle
’eighties the mobs that have left Mt. Enniskillen
and consistently rushed could be counted on the
fingers of one fist, and the same could not be said
for some other Queensland cattle stations. I myself
have taken several mobs from there to N. S. Wales,
and never had the slightest difficulty. And I can
also assure “Barcoo” that on no occasion has a
drover been paid more than the current rate to
take the cattle. Cattle from the nigger country
in North Queensland and the Territory are always
more touchy and require much more careful handling

than those from Western Queensland. They rarely
settle down completely till well away from the
saltwater and the niggers. I have known a mob of
Territory bullocks to be restless and fizz about all-
night. because, before they came in, a nig. had
walked across the ground in which thev were to
camp.

One cannot always have favorable weather for motoring.
The motor car is an all-weather machine designed for
utility purposes, and the thousand and one uses it is now
put to in this country calls for travelling over all descrip-
tions of roads and tracks under varying weather conditions.
In fine weather a roadside engine adjustment or a tyre
change is not so bad - but it’s different when the conditions
are as depicted in the illustration. It’s when the tracks
are a quagmire and the rain teeming that one can doubly
appreciate the sturdy strength and dependability of
DUNLOP TYRE
Many city motorists have no conception of what cars and
tyres have to negotiate in mid-winter away back in the
bush, and it’s striking testimony to the appreciation and
value of “Dunlops” that most country motorists use them.
Their selection is based on mileage and absence of
trouble. Experience has proved that “Railroad” and
“Grooved" Dunlop Covers stand up to hard work at a
running cost that no other tyre approaches.
When you want tyre dependability with long mileage
and economy you can obtain it at the nearest garage by
purchasing “Dunlops.”
All popular sizes obtainable in “ Railroad ” or
“Grooved”—for Clincher or Straight-sided Rims.

multiplicity of wages boards and arbitra-
tion courts, his share is still larger. The
fixing of the rate of wages has been taken
out of the hands of the employer; the condi-
tions of service are settled for him; as to
the hours worked he has not the last word.
What more, then, is wanted? The ultimate
test of any further claim is the power to
provide the service to which the claim is
made
A workers’ committee obviously has no claim to
determine in what proportions the constituents of
some important chemical product should be com-
bined. If it insisted upon doing so the firm would
soon cease to exist. The same argument applies in
the case of all specialised functions. But if such
a committee were able to show that it could per-
form a specific service more effectively than it is
already being provided, not only would it be jus-
tifying its claim, but the firm would naturally, in
its own interests, if for no other reason, delegate
that function to the committee.
That, of course, presupposes that, the workers
see the benefit to themselves of the most
effective production. Unfortunately it is to
be feared that many of them don’t. In Aus-
tralia the truth that we can’t possibly take
out of a pintpot more than we have put
into it has been obscured by the national
policy of borrowing, borrowing, borrowing.
But that makes things only the worse for
us—Unless the borrowings at least pay in-
terest and expenses, which they cannot nearly
do. For it means that, instead of getting
out of the pot more than we have put in, we
shall in future necessarily have less.

The Celtic Revival
Did “D.M.W.” say (Red Page 24/6/’2O)
it was St. Peter made the Christian faith,
though Christ and John the Baptist did
some good work in the beginning? Well,
not quite that, but this: “In the whole so-
called Celtic movement James Stephens
stands out as the saving grace. Synge and
Yeats did magnificent work, but nobody
could understand Ireland much better for
it.” Why did “D.M.W.” put the giant
Yeats and his gifted little boy-friend in this
relation to the man and his demigods in
the middle distance? Because the sick boy
Synge took so freakish a delight in the
grotesque and teased his countrymen with
it, why put the blame on Yeats? In one of
his later books Yeats himself said of Synge:
There are indeed certain men whose art is less
an opposing virtue than a compensation for some
accident of health or circumstance. During the riots
over the first production of “The Playboy,” Synge
was confused, without clear thought and was soon
i 11.... He was, as is usual with gentle and silent
men, scrupulously accurate in all his statements;
in his Art he made to delight his ear and his mind’s
eye voluble dare-devils who go romancing through
a romping lifetime to the dawning of the Judgment
Day.
At the same time, Yeats, I imagine, saw
always beyond the sick fancies of liis friend,
and regarded him ever with a certain rever-
ence, as the writer of one great play, “Riders
to the Sea.”
But Yeats, whose joy in her ancient
beauty, has sung sweet, sleeping, wistful,
tearful, merry Ireland awake, and in her
Celtic twilights has told her tales of the
“Rose of Immortal Hilarity”—Yeats, whose
brooding genius over her has been source and
inspiration to many a Padraic Colum, many
a Shane Leslie, many a Padraic Pearse
scarcely yet heard, how can “D.M.W.”
couple him with Synge, who went out, alas,
before he had done more than raise a storm
in Ireland with his freakish “Playboy” and
flash the white light of his genius over her
in his “Riders to the Sea”? “D.M.W.” says:
“A good deal of the mysticism of Yeats has
no kinship with grander Celtic thought, and
finds its inspiration in far, strange places”;
and again: “The smell of Indian spices is
not a very honest flavor about the mounds
of Tara, and even when the page is thick
with Irish names that smell blows through.”
In “Poetry and Drama” Yeats says, speak-
ing of Lionel Johnson, Catherine Tynan and
himself:—
We sought to make a more subtle rhythm, a more
organic form than that of the older Irish poets who
wrote in English, but always to remember certain
ardent ideas, certain high attitudes of mind which
were the nation itself, to our belief, so far as a
nation can be summarised in the intellect.
In an article written in 1901 on “Ireland
and the Arts,” he declared still inore de-
finitely for Ireland herself alone :—
I admit, though in this I am moved by some touch
of fanaticism, that even when I see an old subject
written of or painted in a new way I am yet jealous
for Cuchulain and for Bailie and Aiblinn. And for those
grey mountains that still are lacking their celebra-
tion.... And I do not think with unbroken pleasure
of our scholars who write about German writers, or
about periods of Greek history. .. .1 would have some
of them leave that work of theirs which will never
lack hands, and begin to dig in Ireland, the garden
of the future, understanding that here in Ireland
the spirit of man may be about to wed the soil of
the world.
And in his poem “To Ireland in the Coming
Times,” he leaves no doubt as to where his
spirit and his mysticism wish to live..
Know that I would accounted be
True brother of that company
Who sang to sweeten Ireland’s wrong.
If “D.M.W.” thinks that Indian spices blow
through this poem it may be he has deeper
understanding than he knows, for some-
where it is said that India gave to ancient
Ireland the ancient wisdom, through her
round towers, in Druid times.
James Stephens is delightful, and his
humor sweetly Irish; but to many of us he
is just the bright foam on this wave of Celtic
literature. To these the Celtic revival holds
two great names that will ever stand side by
side in the land of the Immortals: William
Sharpe, the Plebridean visionary, who is a
literature in himself, his spirit still lord over
wild Highland shores; and Yeats, who be-
nignly towers over, the Western Gael. The
merry laughter of James Stephens tvould not
resound so in th„e great hall where he brings
it, fresh from Irish hedges.,, if these two
giants had not built a temple to Irish
laughter and a shrine for Irish tears. ,

Commerce and industry
A work of vast educational tonnage within
its limits is Commerce and Industry; A
Historical Review, written by many learned
people and edited by William Page, F.S.A.
It deals in two volumes with the industry,
commerce, finance and the everything-else
that concerns the people in a material sense,
barring wars and pageants, of the British
Isles, and to some extent of the British Em-
pire and the world generally. And it covers
the century from 1815 to 1914 —otherwise
from the scrap at Waterloo to the scrap of
paper. Among other things that enter into
the lives of the people it treats of the rise
of trades unionism, the growth of the factory
system, new machinery, new franchises and
the passing of the old order in which a
British Government (1827) consisted of
three dukes, three marquises, two earls, two
lords, three viscounts, one honorable and
some trash. The making of roads is in-
cluded (in the beginning of the nineteenth
century McAdam and Telford made the first
real roads constructed in Britain since the
Romans left off) ; also the, making of canals,
railways (they aren’t quite a century old
yet), docks (also recent; before them vessels
tied up to trees and things like that) ; like-
wise tramways, which were outramways at
first, after Benjamin Outram, who thought
of them in a spare moment. A good deal of
space is given' to the growth cf newspapers,
and it appears that Dublin, not London, in-
vented the daily issue. Banking, schools,
sanitation, housing, labor reforms, old-age
pensions, life insurance, strikes, steamships
and tariffs all get a look in. A quaint item
deals with the relief of the poor. For 30
or 35 years the object of the law in English
rural districts seemed to be to make every-
body a pauper, so “outdoor relief” was given
to able-bodied men all their lives to supple-
ment their wages. Then the bill became
so alarming that the whole system was
altered with a bang and a crash. Relief was
strictly limited, and lamentable workhouses
were built in large quantities to put Oliver
Twist into, with Mr. Bumble to look after
him.
The work is strong in statistics, which
are a fascinating subj'ect when the right man
writes them and the wrong man doesn’t
read them. A chapter on Ireland shows
that at the 1911 census three of the four
provinces, Ulster, Munster and Connaught,
were losing population and only Leinster
was slightly on the up-grade. At its best,
Ulster (which includes Belfast and Derry
a*d the Orange lodges) held 2,386,373
people. In 1911 it had 1,581,696, the decay
having been continuous for 70 years. Of
the 32 counties three—Dublin and Kildare
in Leinster and Antrim in Ulster- —showed
progress. The other 29 were shedding their
people. The faded isle seems to contain
only 15 towns that at one time in the last
90 years had 20,000 persons or more, though
some of the 15 have less than 11,000 now.
Of these five were still decaying in 1911, three
<sf the five being in Ulster. And of only
six towns can it be said that sometime in the
last 90 years they weren’t greater than they
are now—Dublin, Donnybrook, Monkstown
and St. Kevin in Leinster and Belfast and
Derry in Ulster. And Derry, with its popu-
lation of 40,780 and an increase of 888 in
10 years, just escapes being a derelict city
by the skin of its teeth.
But the husky, stolid, self-satisfied Anglo-
Saxon who occupies England and most of
southern Scotland doesn’t seem to make
much more of a fist at guiding other alien
peoples like the Welsh and the Gaels of the
Scottish Highlands than he does with the
Irish. Of the 12 Welsh counties four were
still losing population in 1911, and six had
once been greater than they then were.
Real prosperity was apparently nowhere
except in the. coal and iron country of Gla-
morgan (Ireland has no coal and iron
country), which contains more than half
the population of the melancholy little
princedom of Gwent. Yet there has been
no great and well-defined emigration move-
ment in Wales as in Ireland. Incidentally
the name of the biggest town is Ystrady-
fodwg, meaning probably the Last Straw.
The tragedy of Celtic Scotland is akin to
that of Celtic Ireland, and it began about
the same time, when the bulky partner with
most German blood in his veins dragged the
other three into the Freetrade craze and the
German Albert the Good opened the Great
Freetrade Early Scotland,
descended from Pontius Pilate and Hector
of Troy and other ancient folk, spoke Gaelic,
wore skirts and had its political centre about
Scone or Inverness. Complicated circum-
stances developed a composite monarchy
with a capital at Edinburgh and a Saxon
language over most of the south, with bits
of Norman French among the aristocracy,
though the extreme south-west remained long
a place apart. Of the 32 Scottish counties
last census (1911) showed, 14 as having lost
population since 1901. They represented
13,505 square miles, or nearly half the total
area. Adding six counties where depopu-
lation was temporarily suspended, there were
20 (out of 32) with less inhabitants than
they possessed in their best days. One
person to 60 acres was not uncommon. The
third biggest city, Dundee, which lies north
of the Tay and on the Celtic line, was losing
population. So waS the adjacent Arbroath,
and Inverness, the storied “capital of the
Highlands.” Lanarkshire, where Glasgow
is—Lanarkshire, with its iron afid coal and
shale and slag and smoke and roar and
whisky—does most to keep the total popu-
lation growing, just as Glamorgan, likewise
coaly and slaggy, does with Wales. The
rest is mostly Ireland and Wales over again,
with slight modifications.
Almost all the Irish counties which are
going downhill (29 in all) started to show
their loss of population in the same census
year, 1851. The perishing counties in the
other two little kingdoms began to give
evidence of dying out in these years:—
In Scotland:
Argyll, Kinross and Perth in, 1841; Inverness in
1851; Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Ross and Cromarty,
Sutherland and Wigtown in 1861 ; Berwick, Caith-
ness, Orkney and Shetland and Roxburgh in 1871;
Banff, Clackmannan and Naitn in 1891; Selkirk in
1901; Bute, Elgin and Forfar, 1911.
In Wales:
Radnor in 1851; Anglesey in 1861; Pembroke in
1871 ; Cardigan and Montgomery in 1881; Merioneth
in 1891.
There are heaps of other interesting facts
and figures in the book, even to. the number
of jumbucks in the Falkland Islands, but
nothing that strikes one more than this
story of the calamity of the Celtic regions
in Britain. (Constable and Co., London;

A Souvenir and some Art History
The buyers of 1919 have long since taken
their framed purchases home; but the
Society of Artists’ Pictures (Angus and
Robertson, Ltd.) is here to remind visitors
of an interesting .show. This special number
of “Art in Australia” is a record of the
Society’s exhibition of last year, held in the
Education Gallery at Sydney. Through labor
and paper troubles the beautiful souvenir is
almost 12 months late from the press, but
it was worth waiting for, and the growing
army of Australians who admire and buy fine
books will put it alongside the best they
possess. It contains 20 well-selected color-
plates and 32 reproductions in black and
white. Veteran Julian Ashton, in a charac-
teristically crisp historical survey, tells
how the Society of Artists came to be
formed in 1895 at the instance of A. 11.
Full wood. The professional artists (about
a dozen at that time) found themselves, as
members of the Art Society, lost and out-
voted amongst a crowd of some 200 or 300
laymen and amateurs whose unripe work
made the exhibitions look bilious. This is
how the pot boiled over :• —-
With each succeeding exhibition the inclusion of
indifferent work roused the professionals to a state
of rebellion, until, in the early part <?f 1895, Mr.
A. H. Fullwood, supported by the leading artists,
called a meeting of members to discuss his proposal
that the constitution of the Society be altered so as
to disfranchise laymen, and place the entire control
in the hands of exhibiting members. The meet-
ing was well attended, and after long and impas-
sioned addresses on both sides, a vote was taken,
and the chairman announced that Mr, Fullwpod’s
motion was carried by a majority. He added that
the constitution of the society could only be altered
by a three-fourths majority, and as the motion had
only received the support of a bare majority, the
society would be unaffected by the result of Mr.
Full-wood’s action. There was silence for a moment.
Then Mr. Fullwood got up and tramped towards the
door, thumping the floor as he went with his heavy
cane. Before he passed out he turned, and, facing
the members, shouted in a loud voice: “You’re
nothing but a lot of damned dingbats 1” Cheers and
laughter followed this outburst, but the name stuck.
For many years members of the Art Society Were
generally known as the “dingbats.”
After that leading professionals resigned in
rapid succession and the Society of Artists
was formed. Tom Roberts (first president)
advocated that title “on the ground that an
Art Society could exist without an artist
being enrolled amongst its members; but a
Society of Artists was not possible without
the inclusion of artists and none but artists.”
Since then the society has gone ahead
steadily, attracting most of the young men
as they appear, and hanging only work of
at least fair quality. As for the Art Society
(now and for years past Royal), though'it
wilted under Fullwood’s curse, it has pro-
bably pottered less than it would have done
without its vigorous young competitor.
A Satchel of Books
The Romance of the Battle-line in France,
by J. E. C. Bodley (Constable). This is a
good book for dad to hand the boy who came
home with stories (wonderful how little dis-
posed he was, as a rule, to tell them!) about
Arras and Albert and Amiens and St. Quen-
tin,, and the rest. It is a very readable
' story of the romance of those and a hun-
dred other places, with an additional chap-
ter—really more than half of the fyook—
about the blunders we made before the war
and look like making again. Mr. Bodley’s
idea is that England was (and is) half-
Germanised, without “the essential coping
stone of autocratic direction. In one re-
spect, however, apparently we weren’t half
Germanised enough, for we gave and give
lawyers a hundred times more power and
(when in official positions) vastly more pay
than he thinks they deserve. During the"
war 1 four men who had each got £lO,OOO a
year for being Lord Chancellor, one of them
for a few months only, were drawing pen-
sions of £5OOO a year each, while to save
the £20,000 a year “the British Museum was
closed, to the sorrow of brave Colonial
soldiers, who between the battles for Empire
were seeing the sights of the metropolis for
the only time in their lives.” One way and
another this tremendously patriotic and
erudite old gentleman is quite sure that Eng-
land has gone to the dogs, which wouldn’t
be so bad if they weren’t mostly dachshunds.
The hero of Paul Wenz’s Le Pays de
leurs Peres is a French-Australian’s idea of
a backblocks Australian. The mailman is
the first to give Jim Clarke the biggest news-
item in the world’s history: “Pat Flannery
has beaten Bill the Sailor in Sydney; war
has been declared between England and
Germany.” Jim enlists. So does Burton,
“one of the fiercest champions of the Aus-
tralian Labor party.” Likewise Private
Maclntyre, whose father owns six stations
in N. S. Wales. On Gallipoli Mac is killed ;
Burton becomes a sergeant; Jim is blinded!
Jim is evacuated to England, with Steve
Barrett, who “had lost a leg at Pine Hill
t ? Lone Pine].” His sentiments on arrival
are: “I shall never see it, the old country,
but anyhow I shall walk on that soil which
is that of our fathers and grandfathers.
Good old England!” Enter now Romance
in the person of Nurse Joan, whom Jim
eventually accompanies back to Lone Man
Plain, and marries. “My Jim,” says Joan
before getting out of the buggy and enter-
ing their new home by the creek. “May our
little house be blessed! May its roof and its
walls contain much hanpiness for us!” And
Jim, like the gallant Frenchman that he is,
replies “That which I have given for the
old country I do not regret. The old coun-
try has repaid me well,” (Calmapn Levy,
Paris.)

The Great Value of
Medicinal Warmth.
The great value of Medicinal Warmth, as applied
in the treatment of Pain and Blood Congestion, as
well as in the inflammatory conditions of the Nerves,
has been affirmed by scientific research and
established by Medical Practice.
Concentrated Heat

URODONAL
MAINTAINS YOUTH OP THE
HEART AND ARTERIES.
It frees them from all the waste
products, uratic and chalky de-
posits which tend to harden their
walls.
This cleansing process may be compared to
the boiler and pipes of an engine, which
would certainly refuse to work were its
various parts allowed to become clogged
with accumulated dust and dirt.
The same rule applies to the human machine.
URODONAL dissolves uric
acid, removes sandy de-
posits from the heart
valves, prevents degen-
eration of the blood ves-
sels,' which interferes with
normal circulation, there-
by preventing overstrain
of the heart.

“8.T.”: I had seen “Sonny” Dunne beat a
dog with a waddy in a fit of rage, and tell-
ing Higson of the incident the old man
shook his head despondently. “I sometimes
think that young feller ’ll come to no good,”
said he. “He beats his poor old mother,
and, between you and me, he was the death
of his father, and that’s a bad sign in a
boy, don’t you think?”
It was Justice Gordon who explained
apologetically to an unsuccessful N. S.
Wales petitioner in divorce the other day
that he could not help the Law being an
ass. The lady’s husband had gone to gaol
m 1898 for a “lifer” and, although entitled
to a divorce any time after three years, she
did not worry about applying until she found
that the prisoner had been released. And
then, in the natural course of the Law’s ab-
surdity, she was not entitled.
“Bluey”: The skirted swaggie has hit the
track again. She made her first reappear-
ance at Dubbo (N.S.W.), passing through
on her way to Wellington with Matilda up
and a billy in her hand. In the early ’nine-
ties, when things were bad everywhere, she
was a fairly common sight; and Riverina
had one at least, alleged to be wealthy, who
did it because, so she said, she liked it. She
was 60 when she developed the craze, and
her pack included a sleeping-bag lined with
sheepskins.
“YZ”: Melbourne Hekald’s new boys’
paper is to be called Pals. The proprie-
tors invited competitive suggestions, and
claim to have received hundreds of excel-
lent names. And out of the hundreds it
chose Pals and gave the bright spirit who
made the brilliant suggestion £25. I am
wondering if in all the hundreds there was
a worse. “Pals” is pure Cockney. The
Australian does not speak of his pals but of
mates. There is a pawky suggestion of
affected good-fellowship about the word that
has made the Australian instinctively an-
tagonistic, and except perhaps in one or
two public schools, where En-glish affecta-
tions are encouraged, it is sedulously
avoided.
iolP'®'” (London) : Australians who in
1890 spent a shilling on the first Sydney edi-
tion of Robert Louis Stevenson’s pamphlet
defending Father Damien, the “Apostle of
the Lepers,’ invested far better than they knew.
A copy of this edition was recently knocked
down at £42 to Bernard Quaritch, who special-
ises in rare books and manuscripts. At the
same sale a first edition of “New Arabian
Nights” (1882) realised £302. A 1640 edi-
t, 101 * of Shakspeare’s Poems was run up to
£570, and the first edition of “Othello”
(1622) changed hands at £1250. Some valu-
able finds of this sort have lately been made
in long-deserted garrets and dusty lumber-
rooms of English country houses. A search
of Old Sydney might be similarly rewarded.
Some of the early settlers are sure to have
brought a few literary treasures with them.
It _ has been belatedly whispered into
Maoriland’s startled ear that 77,900 of the
105,282 men called up under the Military
Service Act were declared unfit for active
service. Including those classified as tem-
porarily unfit and ordered into hospitals or
camps for special training the number was
*2, 1 89, and about three-fourths of them
were native-born. There were 15,396 cases
of heart disease, 1718 of tuberculosis, 4994
of varix, 1040 of varicocele, 295 of venereal
disease, 1681 of goitre and 1076 of “defec-
five intelligence.” The extent of goitre is
surprising to the Australian observer; the
bulk of it came from Canterbury, a mostly-
rural district, which supplied a large pro-
portion of the venereal cases also. And, in
spite of the prevailing belief that farming
is the healthiest of all occupations, 22,876
of the rejects—considerably more than the
average in all trades —were farmers or farm-
laborers. But the whole report is damaging
to Maoriland’s sensitive feelings, and the
Government is being bombarded with edi-
torial high explosive because it doesn’t “rise
up and do something.” What it is expected
to do isn t clear.
Fag puts in a word for an old, but
romantic, race :
True it is (B. 24/6/’2O) that Australia badly
requires white agriculturists of the cotton and tea
and coffee and beet and ciane-growing sort, but there
is no chance of getting them from the U.K. John
Bull’s surplus population mostly envelops itself in
blouses , and skirts—the war has left Britain with
about If million more females than males—and
Australia can take a little of the skirted surplus,
but not much. Certainly there is the Land Girl,
who advertised her buxomness so extensively in the
London illustrated papers during the war, but the
Land Girl was an alluring joke, and as far as Aus-
tralia is concerned she is a hopeless proposition.
We must look elsewhere for our tropical and sub-
tropical farmers. Why not to Spain? Spain is not
much more than half the size of N. S. Wales, and
has 20 million more people—a multitude of them
discontented. It is a hot, dry country like Aus-
tralia, and in the Territory or Nor’-west Groperland
the Spanish immigrant would thrive. In his native
regions (including the Canaries) he grows grapes,
oranges, bananas, flax, hemp, esparto and a little
cotton, all of which products Australia could do
with. He mines iron, lead, copper, manganese and
other base-metals, which are all found in the North.
He is a first-class sailor and fisherman—Australia is
short of both these classes of workers—and is a
thorough good fellow when his unspeakable Govern-
ment gives him a chance. All observant travellers
in Spain, from George Borrow down, praise the
Spanish peasant. At the best he is honest, frugal,
courtly, handsome and artistic; at the worst he is
ignorant and superstitious, but even then he is only
what his masters have made him. Not many Span-
iards migrate to Australia, but those who do gen-
erally make good. Pretty well every large Aus-
tralian town has its Spanish restaurateur, and he is
nearly always the best of his kind—decent, courteous
and large-hearted. Thousands of Australians have
had reason for gratitude to that fine old hidalgo of
Bourke-street who opened the doors of his cafe every
night to the down and out of Melbourne, and con-
trived to make them feel that there was at least
one place where the bread of charity was not bitter.
Belonging to an old Imperial race themselves, the
Spaniards get along with the Australians better than
most foreign immigrants. Under new skies, and ’
away from their decayed aristocracy and their
mediaeval priesthood, the Spanish immigrants might,
in a few generations, get back to what they were in
the days of Cervantes and Cortez. Anyhow, the
experiment is worth trying.

“Scottie the R.” : A way we have in the
army. Wilkie wanted another pull-through.
“Where’s your own?” I asked. “Some
blighter pinched it.” “Well, blank it all,”
I said, “don’t come at me —pinch one your-
self.” He pinched mine.
“Smike”: The other night 20-odd Repre-
sentatives met in the Senate club room to
devise ways and means of hoisting Canberra
higher on our national list of disbursements.
As members were breaking away, the en-
thusiast, rallying the others, remarked: “It’ll
take grit to get this through.” “Don’t
worry, old chap,” shot in a Victorian, “Can-
berra will supply all you want.” He had
been up to the laying of the foundation-stone
by the Prince, and was still combing sand
from his hair.
“Yarrum”: Attended sports in connection
with the opening of a section of the Cooma
railway at Bungendore (N.S.W.). A prize
was given for “ugliest face, seen through a
horse-collar”; and it was carried off, with
honor, by an old reprobate who left his
country for his country’s good. It was a
most hideous face, and I saw it in my
dreams for weeks. Later on, over a couple
of beers, I asked the old chap how he man-
aged it. “Well,” said he, “I just recalled
me last Hoggin’—when me pore young back
was cut to ribbons at Campbelltown—and it
come to me nashral.”
“Ex-Dig.”: The first reference to Monash’s
book that appeared in the London press was
an anticipatory par. in the Daily Express.
And I wrote it myself. Incidentally, I
mentioned the Monash argument that the
Australian, whilst despising parade-ground
frill, was the best-disciplined of all soldiers
—-his was splendid battle discipline. It
seemed harmless enough; but it raised a
storm of criticism which lasted for four
weeks. Tommy officers, from subs, to
generals, took the matter as a personal chal-
lenge and poured out wrathful screeds about
the necessity for phrade-ground discipline.
It was remarked at the time that Monash
did not reply ; but speaking publicly later on
he mentioned with gentle irony that he had
“known' men who talk about the value of
discipline in inculcating self-control under
strain, yet cannot keep their tempers in an
argument.”
“The Literary Tinker” : I like the English
tongue after the Yank crook storyteller has
dragged it through the Bowery. This gem
is from an importation now adorning Aus-
tralian book counters: —
“This game I’ve got in my think tank now is a
bird. It takes two to pull it. I’ll be the pro-
moter and you’ll frame up as understudy. The
understudy’s got to be a plugger, which is a tough
proposition to find. The one I got in Chi. got
mixed up with a kid game and landed in limbo
first crack out of the box. If he’d stuck to the
legitimate he’d have been 0.K., but he was naturally
low, and had to take a flier at lush-touching, which
put the kibosh on him. Lifted a couple of karat
sparks off a souse and got sloughed in when he
tried to spout ’em. He was only a dope, anyway!”
If we protected the Australian market in
any degree for the Australian writer we
might miss some of this beauty; so for
Heaven’s sake let us be careful how we
shut the door on the world’s masterpieces.
“Henry Horsecollar”: The usual bit of
evidence, without which no case is com-
plete, turned up at the I.W.W. inquiry in
Sydney:—
Limb op the Law : Mcßlank was a wharf-laborer,
I think?
Witness: Not that I know of.
Limb : Then what was he ?
Witness: He was doing nothing that I ever knew
of. He just went to the races, like myself.
Then the name of Blanky cropped up, and
it transpired that he also haunted the race-
courses. The witness said that Mcßlank
and Blanky were a pair of liars, which is
possible,. The racecourse is a great haunt
of loafers, wasters and thieves, so liars pro-
bably go there also. The principal basis of
the demand for an idle Saturday is to have
more time to go .with Mcßlank and Blanky
to the races. A deputation from the Iron
Trades Federation waited on N.S.W. Pre-
mier Storey the other day to demand “no
Saturday work,” which would mean not only
stoppage for those who wanted to stop but
compulsory stoppage for those who didn’t
and consequent loss of production and
increase in the cost of living for everybody.
And it is safe to say that the useless fiddle-
headed beast which runs round and round
to no purpose and leaves off where it started
was largely responsible. The furtive depu-
tation demanded that the press should be
shut out, and the servile Premier assented.
So the mere no-account public didn’t learn
what reasons were assigned for playing into
the hands of the importer and the foreign
profiteer by decreased production. These
murky habits of locked doors and secret cau-
cuses can be overdone.
“Gallery” : Accepting a lead given by Pre-
mier Lawson, the Vic. Assembly, by 25 votes
to 21. turned down Hannah’s motion to
abolish the office of Governor as now con-
stituted. Of the Liberal-Conservative-Hay-
seed agglomeration on the Speaker’s right
only Alan Cameron, Groves, Everard
(greatly daring) and Toutcher voted with
Labor. McGregor and Farthing, two Radi-
cal-Liberals, and McLachlan and D. Smith,
Independent Laborite, paired for the motion.
St. Kilda is the holy of holies of the
Women’s National League, which had issued
its ukase against the abolition. Agar
Wynne, the elect of that seaside suburb,
will therefore “acquire merit” over the piece
he spoke. As Irvine was paid £2500 a year
besides his screw of £3OOO a year as C.J.,
as shacks were kept going for him in Mal-
vern ancl Macedon, and as pay for an extra
Judge to carry out portion of the work that
would otherwise fall to his Ex. had to be
provided, Wynne asserted that there was no
saving—he didn’t say that there could be
no saving. To round off his effort he, of
course, raised the “cut-the-painter” issue.
That settled it. The plain truth, however,
is that Irvine has been by no means an idol,
and the House was unable to tackle the sub-
ject apart from the individual. Hon. mem-
bers merely reflected public flabbiness on
the subject. In righteous wrath at the
verdict, the Age screamed out: “Must
the official who wields the rubber-stamp of
office necessarily wear gold braid and a
cocked hat?” It, too, must have had Irvine
in its eye—lrvine as he appeared in his
magnificence at the opening of the session.

'J'HE Motor Fire Engine or Pump is the sign of a
progressive community. Where seconds are
precious it becomes an absolute necessity—and the
saving in upkeep as compared with the horse-drawn
engines more than covers the initial cost in a very
short period. London has a fleet of over fifty Ley-

rely on Leyland fire fighters.

ITHACA GUN RECORD?
The recent Australian Pigeon
ship held in Melbourne drew a record
entry.
Included in the starters were only two
Ithaca gun users. Yet these secured
4s t PRIZE
and
2nd PRIZE
which certainly proves that the Ithaca
guns played a big part in helping their
owners to secure the coveted prizes.
Ithaca guns have for the last seven years
won most of the big “shoots” held in
America.
These facts should convince you that
Ithaca guns have no superiors.
You can obtain Ithaca guns from Mick

More Miles on Plume
The speedometer is one of the most interesting
features of your car. The miles you have travelled
that day—the distance for the season—-the pace you
are making at the moment—are things that you re-
quire to know in order to learn if your car is at its
best. By comparison you will realize how much
greater mileage you obtain from Plume Benzine.
Plume gives that extra mileage that makes such a
difference to the spirit bill at the end of the month.
Fill up with Plume next time, and check your
mileage. You will be pleased at the increased
mileage and consequent reduction of your running
expenses.
Don’t say Benzine—ask for
Plume.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“H.E.P.”: In a Rugby match between
two country teams a player thought he had been
wrongly penalised by the referee. Without being
ordered off he left the ground. Then, chancing to
look around, he saw one of the opposition team’s
men careering down the wing to score a sure try.
Rushing back he intercepted the player and pre-
vented him scoring. After the argument had died
down the referee held that, “as the man had not
been ordered off the field, he was quite in order.’’
Who was right ?
* * * •
Club cricket is booming in and around
London this summer, many clubs running five and
six teams. A new body, the London and Southern
C.C. Conference, controls things, and has ruled that
no cup or league competition shall be run, and
that no pro. may join. Sunday play, now beginning
to be demanded, is officially left to each club’s
discretion, and will doubtless catch on, especially
as “the Crown” has formally sanctioned it in the
Richmond Club’s lease of the old royal Deer Park
there.
* * * *
“Hannibal” : “Baree” (B. 10/6/’2O wants
to know who first used the crawl stroke. Appa-
rently the South Sea Islanders. Alec Wickham
brought it first to Sydney. Americans adopted what
they called the “flutter kick,” in which the ankles
do not move as in the Australian crawl. Kahana-
moku uses an extraordinary kick. The toes are
pointed inward and the feet are worked rapidly
from side to side; this makes a propeller of them.
There is no doubt that his kick gave extraordinary-
pace, but generally speaking it is the shoulder
work which counts in the crawl stroke.
# * * *
“Smiler” Hales has turned up in England
with a new light in his eye. With the help of
Bottomley’s John Bull he is to scour Britain for a
white hope to wrest the world’s championship from the
winner of the Dempsey-Carpentier battle. That there
is an unsuspected tornado somewhere he feels is a jus-
tifiable assumption, and he instances the discovery of
the remarkable Charlie Mitchell, who gave away three
stone and 3 J inches to Jonel Sullivan and fought
the champion for over three hours until a mutual
armistice was declared. “Smiler” is, as usual, very
hopeful. 1-Ie is tearing about with a bag of money,
offering to try out supermen and prepare the likeliest
regardless of expense.
“Smiler,” though he has written acres of sporting
stuff, was never more than a third-class performer
himself. His most notable battle was a very
private meeting at Broken Hill. He and Everard
Browne had a difference, and it was agTeed to
settle the argument at “the silvertails’ ” camp on
“Mt. Zion.” Browne,' who had the advantage in
years and more in reach, was a rather easy winner.
* * * *
. “Ex-Englishman”: J. N. Crawford has
taken the one step fatal to a “gentleman” in the
cricket field in England, accepting a week-end
engagement with the Rochdale Club in Lancashire,
where they take the game very seriously. Crawford
has always lived on the game. One of many 7 sons
of an asylum chaplain, he had to, if he was to play
at all. He was first-class from his schooldays. All
summer he took the generous “expenses” that Surrey
allows to amateurs, and each winter saw him in a.
touring team to Australia. S’Africa or the West
Indies. When he quarrelled with Surrey over a
trifle, St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, offered him a
mastership. He helped S.A. to win the Sheffield
Shield, and in time was engaged by the Cricket
Assoc, as coach, till Maoriland made him a better
offer to go there. In spite of all this, Surrey took
him back as an “amateur” ; but this latest step
finishes him. England will invent an assistant-
secretaryship for the “well connected” player unwill-
ing to turn pro. ; but this business of taking a weekly
wage from bea’stly cotton-spinners and miners, “it
simply—haw 7 —isn’t done!”
* * * *
“Hannibal”: Here is my nomination for
the bream-catching championship with a line. On
June 6 E. Carmichael,,of Port Macquarie (N.S.W.),
started fishing for bream off the breakwater. He
commenced at 7 o’clock at night, fished till 5 o’clock
in the morning, and landed 156 bream of from 31b.
to 21b. Ninety w 7 ere caught off one rock. This
champion used mullet and mullet-gut as bait.
* * * *
The sensation that seems to have been
created in England by the anonymous allegation of a
London newspaper correspondent, that Australian
crowds will hoot English test-cricketers who haven’t
seen active service is about as ill-justified as any
on record. Immense crowds in Sydney yell them-
selves hoarse over the feats of League players, few
of whom enlisted. Many of our pugs avoided the
war without damage to their popularity. A team
of cricketing non-starters opposed the A.I.F. NI at
the end of last, season in Sydney ; and there was no
distinction between the reception given to the tw 7 o
sides. The last thing a crowd here is likely to
trouble about is whether (say) a visiting pro. was
sent to Flanders or kept in a home-service gym-
nasium, as so many of Britain’s athletic cracks were.
At the worst, they did something tp win the war,
while we shall be featuring several hefty youngsters
who did absolutely nothing.
**•*■*•
“Refereeing 1000 Fights,” the boxing
reminiscences of Eugene Corri, the English referee,
published by C. Arthur Pearson, Ltd., London, is
poor stuff on the whole. The only world’s cham-
pionship which Corri seems to have witnessed was
the lightweight contest between Freddie Welsh and
Willie Ritchie, and that, judging by his account of
it, was a very ladylike exhibition; and many of
Corri’s stories have been told —and better told —-
before. The best is that of “a fight in America,
when one of the combatants, who had been requested
by his father to cable the result immediately, sent
the amusing and laconic message, ‘Won easily ; 75
rounds.’ ” And it didn’t happen in America. It
happened in Queensland, the hero being the old
field-fighter, “ ’Possum” Ward.
* * * *
Yass and Harden (N.S.W.) take their
football seriously. A recent match was for a stake
of £2OO, and Harden won by 22 to 3. But Yass
wasn’t satisfied, and one of its supporters said he
had £2OO to say that Harden couldn’t do it again.
The money has been covered, so the game will be
worth £4OO to the winning team. The odd thing
is that neither side will play on the other’s ground.
They go to Goulburn to settle the argument.
*.*■**
Tommy Burns talked copiously in London
before Beckett stopped him in seven rounds.
If he won (“and if I did not feel sure I
could beat him I would not consider a match
for any money”) he hoped to take on Car-
pentier. But the world’s championship he did not
look for, candidly side-stepping Dempsey. “To state
that I am prepared to meet Jack Dempsey would be
ridiculous, because I wouldn’t have an earthly chance
of standing up against him. He is one of the three
best men America has ever produced, and, while I
do not under-rate Carpentier, the fact that I am
prepared to meet him, and not Dempsey, gives some
idea of my estimate of the men,”
* * * ' *
The Soccer championship of the British
Isles was an open thing till the last match, between
England and Scotland. A win for the Scots meant
top place, but they lost by five to four in a heavy-
scoring game at Sheffield. So the two tied on the
season for second place, with Ireland last and
Wales in the top place—-which it is more used to
winning at Rugbv. It is significant of modern con-
ditions that, of the officially declared best XI of
Scotland, six don’t live there, but had to be collected
for the match from English clubs which have hired
their services.

“With a voice like that a man would win
the birds off the bushes,” said an old poet
amid a hailstorm of applause that followed
John McCormack’s singing of “M<?rrai Si,” at
the opening concert of the Sydney season in
the Town Hall. It is a thoroughly equipped
mansion of a voice, with all appurtenances
and offices, hot and cold service laid on. It
has turrets and winding stairs and terraces.
Little ghosts of dead dreams haunt its corri-
dors, and the pot pourri of memory saturates
its atmosphere. It has an Italian garden
with a laughing rogue of an Irishman loiter-
ing at the turn of the path. It is set about

Emelie Polini is again learning in “The
Eyes of Youth” at the King’s that Peter
is the best of all possible husbands. The
information is . conveyed by the same old
crystal o’er which A. E. Greenaway makes
mystic passes and talks of the Spirit in
grave, meditative tones. Peter, previously
played by Greenaway, has his youth and
some of his childhood restored by the more
callow Raymond Lawrence. Kay
has changed from Louis Anthony to Robert
Goring, and finds the career of the bad man
veiy restful. Anthony becomes a more pas-
sionate young prig under the guidance of
Norman Pearce; but his best girl, Rita,
yearns for more dramatic sustenance than
Esther Mitchell gives her. Eardley Turner
repeats the old amiable Ashling. John
Fernside has grown more violent, and often

“Yes, Uncle,” at Melbourne Royal, is still
being robbed of its natural decorum by the
disquieting garments of Field Fisher and
the freakish behavior of George Willoughby.
George, as a violent Stoush American ex-

of Margaret Swallow. Every Swallow
doesn’t make a summer, but Margaret repre-
sents a lot of its sunshine. Her seductive

Melbourne Majestic is showing Australia’s
Wild North West, with lots of brother
Binghi in ceremonial dances. H. J. Jack-
son, who photoed these and the giant turtles,
dugongsand other marvels in the film, makes
interesting remarks about the principal
events. The Majestic’s leading fiction re-
views the “Ruling Passions” with the help
of Julia Dean and Edwin Arden. The story
deals largely with the career of a morbid
broker who develops a brighter tempera-
ment under the influence of a nurse. Hoyt’s
Best Seller is “Heart Strings/' another pic-
ture that gets its punch from the fist of
William Farnum. “The Virgin of Stam-
boul” puts Constantinople into the centre of
the picture, and there are a beauteous
beggar-maid and a polygamous Pasha to pro-
duce a Turkish banquet of love and sensa-
tion. “Tongues of Flame,” the third Hoyt
feature, is an adaptation of Bret Harte’s “In
the Carquinex Wood,” but the color of
Harte’s story is not in the film, though the
style and good looks of the star, Marie
Walcamp, make amends.

Two Melbourne shows :
May Butler George’s big show at the Athenamm
compels most respect in the miniature section. She
has several graceful ladies
so lightly pictured that
they almost dissolve into
their ivory backgrounds.
But there are also some
heavier studies of promi-
nent men, the least satis-
factory of them an
unfamiliar George Reid, re-
duced to youthful slender-
ness by a hunger-strike
and Swedish drill. Miss
George uses a clever
needle in her etchings on
ivory, one of which is a
capital head-stud}' of the
ex-beauty, Mary Anderson.
The portraits in crayon
afford additional evidence
of the artist’s pursuit of
celebrities. She hangs a
large, Rigorous sketch of
Kitchener with his mou-
staches bristling in keep-
ing with the glare of his
eyes. In the same medium
other military officers,
French beauties, drunken
Huns and Arab sheiks are
given boisterous publicity.
The drawings of the
Arabs seem the most
human, whilst the French
females derive most of
their enchantment from
their adorable millinery.

novelty, but Miss George cannot claim to have
scored in the pathetic plaque of Dante and Beatrice
and the Anzac design for a panel monument. In
landscape the artist ranges from the vapid to the
vociferous. “The Thatched Cottage” is one of the
most taking, but there is a landscape (No. 87)
that practically spruiks of the glories of the English
autumn. “A Bluebell Wood in England” is a little
quieter, but even that is audible to the ear of a
sensitive critic.
* * * *
The water-colors of John R. Eldershaw brought
a rush of buyers to the Decoration Gallery. Elder-
shaw is a likeable painter who achieves delicate
effects without overworking his imagination. His
largest subject, “Old Wooden Bridge,” seems one
of his least successful, but it merely loses by com-
parison with smaller studies on account of a little
formality in the treatment of the scene. The same
criticism can’t be made against his pictures of a
quaint arched bridge in Tasmania, but still the
repetition of the same subject, with the constant
emphasis of its charm in varied lights, induces a
feeling of monotony which the artist’s careful paint-
ing cannot wholly efface. It is in No. 21, “Even-
ing Silhouette,” that Eldershaw shows the ripest
performance. This is the simplest study in the
exhibition, but he has skilfully caught a creeping
twilight in its loveliest moment of mystery and
color. The fetching opal sky in “Landscape—Even-
ing” and the warm light sunning the ends of the
haystacks in No. 27 show that the artist hasn’t
led a misspent life. “Passing Ferry,' Sydney Har-
bor,” is a happy little nocturne, and one admires
“A Long Road” that runs like a fluttering ribbon
through acres of fields. The cool shimmer of pearl,
grey and lavender in “The Creek Bed” is a holiday
to a tired eye, but the artist isn’t so winning in
“Golden Pool” and “River Pools,” where raw-red
clay plays a prominent part in the landscape.
Adelaide is suffering from reaction after
the excitement of the Prince’s visit, and the
main item of a quiet week has been a trial
of the. Repertory Theatre in a big house —
the Tivoli —-for four nights; with the valu-
able Mclntosh backing. Some final coaching
by Workman put an extra polish on the
always-clever acting, and the play, a revival
of Galsworthy’s “Silver Box,” went well.
The Rep. had even the unusual support of
a. large Saturday-night gallery, which hailed
the police-court scene and the satire on
Justice’s leaning, to the rich man wit’ll
approval. Tait’s Smart Set Diggers are
doing so well at the King’s that their season
has been extended. The Royal has con-
tentedly gone back to pictures for a bit.
West’s finds “The Breaking of the Drought”
better than the imported stuff, and local
pictures of the Prince go well everywhere.
Wondergraph adds to its “Secret Service”
revival high-class onera singing, the Grand
does the same, but the Pav. finds 0. Chap-
lin sufficient without any special music.
So . soon . as Moiseiwitsch had finished in
Adelaide his wife, Daisv Kennedy, began a
series of farewell recitalsand it is hoped
to get them on the same platform before
they go. Walenn, of the University Con-
servatorium, also strokes an inspired violin,
and the new South Australian Orchestra,
under the baton of Prof. Harold Davies, is
at last making a public appearance.
“Ike Pagliacci”: There were some timid
souls in Sydney for the Prince’s visit. My
friend Smith terrified his aunt from Bone
Gully with the cheerful suggestion: “Tell-
yerwhat! I’ll get a couple-a plain-clothes
detectives to show us over Lower George-
street.”
“S.S.”: I once went into a Melbourne
theatre with Oily Deering. We found a thin
house, and received nods from all over the
circle, which was “papered” in the most
pathetic way. Two-thirds of those present
were newspaper men; the other third were
their female relations. Coming away Deer-
ing took out a piece of pencil and, putting
a tail to the D, converted the sign at the
door into “Press Circle” and passed on
chuckling.
“Ivaylee”: The smartest cooks in the world
are those with the big Yankee circuses which
employ usually about a thousand people. If
there’s not good food the. show goes on strike,
so the boss sees that thq kitchen waggon is
always first on the job. I have seen breakfast
for 1200 hungry people prepared in one hour
from the time the first waggon left the
special train. Pancakes are the first articles
attacked by the chefs. Ringling’s carried six
pancake-makers, whose performance in the
kitchen was as wonderful as anything I ever
saw accomplished under the big top.
_ “Cit”: I notice one queer effect of the
high price of mutton-chops in Melbourne.
Whereas the suburbs I know were once
scarcely inhabitable because of the super-
fluity of male birds in the barnyard, nowa-
mornings you must find another excuse for
your insomnia, there not being an average
of one crow to the acre. Inhabitants who
keep hens, finding the male of the species
unproductive, and harassed by the extor-
tionate charges for cutlets and lamb’s fry,
have taken to chanticleer and devoured
him; and an unparalleled consumption of
rooster has produced a Sabbath calm of un-
precedented depth and width.
“Jobber”: I was in Harefield Hospital
when Bill was discharged to go on furlough.
He had a good wad of “Bradburys,” and
was browsing along the Strand at after-
noon tea-time, when two nice-looking tabbies
smiled encouragingly. Bill “dicked,” and
in less than 10 minutes had ordered tea for
three. The waitress, when asked for sugar,
looked at Bill with a pitying glance. “You
can’t get sugar nowadays,” said one of Bill’s
tarts,_ “but I have saccharine tablets which
are just as good.” As things turned out
Jane’s tablets were better, for when Bill
woke up he was minus about 30 of the
best. Always, up till the time I left Hare-
field, the Ward’s last words to a discharged
cobber, were, “Look out ifor the Janes with
the saccharine.”
“Dale”: I have pleasure in announcing
J will shortly start upon the erection
of a fowl-house in my back yard, and that it
will be named “The Prince’s Fowl-House.”
This is just as it should be, because the
Prince passed within four blocks of it on
one occasion. Also it is going to be con-
secrated to the armies of the Allies, and a
special plate on the front elevation will com-
memorate this fact. Subscriptions are in-
vited for the purpose of honoring our Royal
Guest and our Gallant Defenders. P.S.—I
have been encouraged to take this step by
the example of every other beggar desirous
of persuading the public to provide the
wherewithal for a church, club-house, shelter-
shed or public convenience.
“Wealsman” from the South Pole:—
Only one comedy was put on during the Prince’s
visit to Hobart; but what there was of it was a
great success. The ferry-steamer that was busy
conveying the sight-seeing populace to and from the
Renown dallied at the wharf a few minutes too long
on the final trip out, with the result that the passen-
gers failed to reach their destination before the big
ship’s closing time, and were not allowed aboard.
Thereupon the trippers demanded a return of their
2s. a head. The ferry-boat captain was sorry, but
he didn’t have it. The shore officials had the money;
and wouldn’t the ladies and gentlemen please go
ashore and make their claims in the proper quarter
in the morning ? The ladies and gentlemen merely
scoffed, and unitedly declared their intention of
continuing to sit tight until they got their two bobs.
The ferry-officials urged the crowd to be reasonable;
they pointed out that if the steamer did not immedi-
ately return to the Renown to take off the passengers
who had been put aboard on previous trips there
would be serious trouble, perhaps amounting to the
bombardment of the town. They offered to take
the passengers for a little trip round the harbor.
The mutineers coldly drew attention to the fact that
the weather had changed, thank you very much.
Eventually officials skirmished about the now almost
deserted shipping front and gathered enough cash to
refund half the fare to all city passengers, and gave
an lOU for the balance, and the full florin to those
who dwelt in the country and were leaving town
that night. The strikers accepted the terms and
their shillings, and marched ashore, cold but vic-
torious, and the released ferry-boat sped away towards
the Renown in the gathering gloom.

Alkali Causes Soap
To Injure Hair.
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified hut quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces lasts you and mother, sisters and
brothers for months. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonfuls is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather, it
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
The hair dries quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
is.
Best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. And yet
It loosens and carries off every bit of excess
oiiiness, dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
IMPORTANT.—Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanui oils
or. other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated cocoanut oil, as recommended above.
Girls! Women! Give this a Corner on your Dressing-
table. Never Let a Corn Ache Again!

THE Australian people owe a
debt of gratitude to the wizard
in chemistry who fornialated the
new ether discovery named
Frozol-Ice.
Little phials of this
wonder liquid are now
obtainable from any chem-
ist for a few pence. You
merely apply a few drops
of this Frozol-Ice on a ten-
der. aching corn or tough-
ened callous. Right away all
soreness vanishes, and soon you see the
corn or callous that loose and withered
that it lifts out with the fingers, like a
jCork. Not a twinge of pain or even irritation
is felt when using Frozol-Ice, or afterwards.
No soreness, no inflammation of surrounding
healthy flesh or skin.
Only a few pence now gives one freedom
from all and each soft corn, hard corn, corn
between the toes, likewise tender callouses on
bottom of the feet. Every Australian who
tries Frozol-Ice sings its praises, for it
honestly does not hurt one wee bit.
Step in at your chemist’s to-night and in-
sist on having a small phial of Frozol-Ice
in the green-printed carton. Stand on “your
dig.” and refuse spurious imitations of this
great' compound.
Drinking Water
With Meals Stops
Stomach Disorders.
Thousands of unfortunate people suffer
almost daily from dyspepsia, indigestion,
fermentation, sour acid stomach, flatulence,
gases or distress after eating. If they would
only form the agreeable habit of slowly drink-
ing with each meal a glassful of hot water
containing a teaspoonful of pure Salix Mag-
nesia, they would soon find their stomachs so
much strengthened and improved that they
might eat the richest and most satisfying
meals without the least symptom of indiges-
tion.
Salix Magnesia is highly effective in stomach
and intestinal disorders, and is very pleasant
to the taste, and in the form of tine powder or
compressed tablets—never liquid or milk—
and is not a laxative. Any first-class chemist
can supply you with this Salix Magnesia.

“To Po”: How many are alive to day who
heard William Creswick, the last of the old
school of English tragedians, read the Bible
to the Anglican parsons of Melbourne? The
idea came from the fertile brain of Bishop
Moorhouse, who was a warm friend of the
actor, and hailed from the same University.
Moorhouse was annoyed at the snuffling
delivery of his clergy, and appealed to Cres-
wick to give a demonstration at Bishops-
court. The old man, well over 70 then, gave
them an hour of Bible reading or reciting,
and converted even the lowest of those Low
churchmen who had believed the stage to be
of the Devil. Dr. Moorhouse said after-
wards that the effort had an appreciable
effect on the pulpit work of that day. It’s
time to repeat the experiment.
"Vaudeville Veteran”: The ancients of the
old A.V.A. (Australian Vaudeville Associa-
tell ) are staggered at the live-wire methods
of the Actors’ Federation of to-day. The
A.V.A. paid the rent of a ciub-room,
where out-of-work vaudevillains congregated
gloomily each day, but did little more for its
members. On one occasion a dozen dead-
broke performers sat in silent gloom around
the struggling fire. Entered Bill Duckworth,
champion jumper, fresh from a circus tour
and with real money in his pocket. “Hello,
boys !” he said cheerily. The twelve grunted
and once more glared gloomily at the fire.

don to marry eleven widoivs.
it—the morning of the funeral?” Then he
had an inspiration. “A dollar,” he shouted,
“to _ the first man who stands on his head
against the wall.” There was a wild rush.
The apostles of gloom sprang into action, the
whole dozen with tragic solemnity endeavor-
ing to balance themselves in an upside-down
position. Duckworth awarded the dollar to
skater Athos, who is now earning a big
salary on the other side of the world.
The formerly stage-struck Earl of Clan-
carty, who looked a taking youth when he
visited Australia 30 years ago, has been
invited inside for three months, his method
of raising the wind having grown tiresome.
Clancarty was sent to this country in the
hope that he would forget his infatuation
for Belle Bilton; but the man who travelled
as his tutor helped to bring about the mar-
riage. The noble lord long ago dissipated
his patrimony, and a habit of forgetting that
he is an undischarged bankrupt is what nas
caused his temporary retirement from the
society of reluctant Noses. •
“Peter”: Cecil Brooking, of the Emelie
I.olini Co., is trying to live down an unsoli-
cited notoriety as a comedian. His repute
began in “Peg o’ My Heart,” and ever since
lie has aroused roars regardless of the style
of part he is supposed to be playing. In
‘Kindling,” for instance, he was allotted the
job of aide to the insufferable Mrs. Bourke-
Smith. The lines would make you feel mor-
bid, but when Brooking uttered them in Syd-
ney numbers writhed in the throes of acute
merriment, with the result that Emrnv
Polini almost had to take a back seat, and
leading-man Roberts was diminished to a
super. So when the play came to Melbourne
Brooking was sidetracked in favor of a bud-
ding tragedian who could/ give the role a
dim synodal mournfulness without opening
his mouth.
“Norbell”: The Charles Wood mentioned
by “Hamfat” (B. 22/7/’2O) as asking the
co. to “stand away from the obscenium,” was
famous for his verbal vagaries. In Adelaide
an unfriendly rag called him “the Cinque-
valli of the English language,” and Charles
took it as a graceful compliment. “Look
’ere,” he said triumphantly to his fellow-
mummers, “you say I can’t act, an* yet this
’ere paper compares me to a man who draws
over an ’undred quid a week !”
“Norbell”: Pearl Hellmrich, an all-round
performer now with the Fullers, began her
variegated stage
career as a child in
Wilson Barrett’s
co., and has per-
sisted in one or
other branches of
the greasepaint
business ever since.
She married the
late E. Carden Wil-
son, the clever
mimic, son of

and brother o f

“J.F.H.” (London) : Henry Arthur Jones,
once a popular playwright, has not had a
look-in for years, and evidently feels sore
about it. In an article on “My Unacted
Plays” he mentions that he has four new
ones completed, but is waiting for con-
ditions that will be favorable to their pro-
duction. “They need very careful casting,
the right theatre, the right manager, and
the right sort of audience,” all of which
elements are, presumably, wanting. Jones
says he has known theatrical managers for
40 years, and they have two simple rules
for judging a play: (1) “Was the author’s
last play a success?” ; (2) “Is it like some-
thing that has just been successful?” In
file case of an actor-manager the all-import-
ant query is: “Is there a big part* in it for
me?” A new race of managers or, rather,
nominees of speculative syndicates, has
sprung up, and, says Jones, “I fear I should
obtain a very chilly reception if I offered
them plays of serious interest.”
“S.T.S.”: The life-story of Norman Pearce
(B. 15/7/’2O) gives a lot of information
some of us have been vainly seeking for
three months past. In “The Little Damozel”
this unstarred player gave one of the finest
small-part renderings I have ever seen—as
the restaurant manager in his private room.
His telephone talk, bringing together of
acquaintances and combination of strict
business with the opening of another bottle
in celebration seemed not to be “acting” at
all, and differed just as far as possible from
the careful piling-up of effective points 'by
other masters in their different lines—Athol-
wood, Julius Knight or Eardley Turner, for
instance. I suppose Frank Harvey is our
greatest “naturalist” of the moment, as
Titheradge and Herbert Flemming were of
the last generation.
“Norbell”: The S. M. Herald account of
the Marjorie Beeby concert mentions that
“in the second part of the programme Miss
Beeby was associated with Mr. J. L. Walters
in Ernest Newton's ‘lt Was a Lover and

all the Shakspeare songs up to date. It’s
done like this, I understand :

He’d had many more in the bitter past,
In the springtime, the only pretty ring-time,
And he sang “I’m true, to you, I am,
My former affairs were mostly sham,
You are my springtime, dinkum lamb,
And I swear by the ancient epigram,
“Ne suior ultra crepidam.”
.Sweet lovers fcve the spring!
“Ike Pagliacci” : No wonder poster-adver-
tising outside movie-shows attracts the mul-
titude. The other day I saw this in a
Sydney suburb: —■
The Heart of the Hills.
See it To-day.
Mary Pickford’s Inside.
“Ox”: In “East Lynne” productions can
anyone beat the record of Agnes Dobson,
now leading woman in Sydney with Fullers?
She made her farewell appearance as Littie
Willie at 12, and her ddbut as Lady Isabel
at 16.
“Vaudeville Vet”: Phil Thurber, well-
known vaudevillain, recently returned from
an Oriental tour, can vouch for the demo-
cratic spirit of royalty. At Bangkok he
played on terms; and while watching
his interests in the front of the house he
was called to an entrance to settle a lively
argument’. A relative of the King of Siam
had arrived with about 30 of his depen-
dants and was demanding admission at
reduced rates. The Siamese manager was
explaining the situation, when there was a
sudden outburst on the part of the royal
gentleman. Thurber asked the manager to
translate the explosion. “He says,” ex-
plained the local man, “that if it isn’t settled
pretty damn quick he’ll take his business
over to the other theatre.”
“Biobox”: In the old lime-plant days of
the movies we got our show going at a little
S. A.US. town and struggled through without
serious mishap till 9.30. Then the engine
started to jib. Realising that the end was
near I scribbled a message and had it
rushed round to the local pianist, who, with
a great pile of music alongside her, was
grinding out various inappropriate airs. “If
the picture stops,” I wrote, “play ‘God Save
the Queen’!” The reply came back: “I
can’t. I haven’t got the music.”
“One Night Stand” : I often wonder what
the chronic deadhead’s ancestors told Noah
at the door of the ark, but I’ll swear they
never paid. No travelling co. objects to
the usual double pass for favors received:
but now these bushrangers demand a “family
pass” and a “family” may fill a front row.
The limit in some places is the “band,” and
we struck it lately. Their terms were “15
bob and a free pass.” At 8 o’clock 10 players
had finished their bit; at five minute's past
eight 20 alleged bandsmen carrying instru-
ments had been passed in; the last had a
drumstick, and our house manager had a
nasty glare in his eye. When No. 21 arrived
with the mouthpiece of a cornet he got sar-
castic, and told the doorkeeper to keep a
few seats for the composers. But the lid
blew off when a weedy youth pushed up with
the same old drumstick, which had evidently
worked out through a side door. It was a
great race, but the weedy one was too fast
oft the mark.
, When “The Country Girl” was in
Melbourne one prosperous old John in white
spats was found to have attached himself
permanently to the show. He was always
m place when the curtain went up, and he
was .always in white spats. As white spats
are indicative of great wealth, and the party
in the front stalls was really a nice, clean
old gentleman, the girls began to wonder
which of their number was about to marry
untold gold. The moth followed the opera
from one metropolis to another, and on to
a third, but made no move to single out the
witch, with the result that a certain amount
of pique began to manifest itself. Curiosity
must be allayed, and eventually one of the
piquant comedians, defied by the whole
chorus, set out to find out all about it. He
waylaid the man in the white spats in the
crush room, contrived an excuse for entering
into conversation, and said : “You are a tre-
mendous patron of this show. I saw you in
Melbourne, and in Sydney.” “Yes, yes,” re-
plied Spats. “Perfectly true. The fact is
I have to come. lam never really well away
from it. I suffer greatly from asthma, and
the atmosphere of the piece suits me.”.
“H.” : At the back of the British Museum
there is a three-storeyed house with the letters
A.D.A. over its door, signifying “Academy
of Dramatic Art.” A Daily Mail man
dropped in and found Australia’s old friend
Cyril Maude superintending a rehearsal of
The School for Scandal.” There are 125
students on the roll, nearly all girls. “Splen-
did girls,” says the principal, “but I wish we
could get more men. There are four girls
to every man.”
Matheson Lang has been making merry at
the expense of the British income-tax
authorities. With Arthur Bourchier he has
been giving afternoon performances of
“Othello” at the New Theatre, London, and
the tax-gatherers truculently called upon him
to furnish them with the name and address
of the author of the play, and with particu-
lars of- all payments made to him in respect
of Lang’s .season. The actor replied that
JOSEPH F. GRAHAM, of Courtneidge's
Comedy Co., who first played in Aus-
tralia 40 years ago.
he was not quite certain who was the author,
as there were several competitors for the
honor, among them Shakspeare, Bacon, the
Duke of Rutland and the seventeenth Earl
of Surrey, and that he would be greatly
obliged to the income-tax authorities if they
would say which of them was legally en-
titled to author’s fees.
“Bello”: The pictures haven’t got it all
their own way. I’ve seen scores of photo-
screams stressing the pluck, resource, etc.,
Of the Canadian Nor’-West Mounted Police
—it’s a favorite theme with the movies—
and I thought I knew just what the troopers
looked like. Consequently I got a shock when
I was out in the storm with “Tiger Rose”
and saw Constables Devlin and Haney wear-
ing scarlet coats. I had supposed the dinkum
uniform was dark blue, like our own Hop’s,
for it photographs like that. Now I shouldn’t
be surprised to find that Charlie Chaplin’s
mo. is crimson, or that Mary Pickford wears
puce hair in reel life.
“Norbell”: The storm which plays the
lead in “Tiger Rose” is worked by 26 Aus-
tralians, though the principal Speaking
characters are imported as usual. It is sig-
nificant also that the two stage-managers,
Charles Bertal and Bruce Newham, are Aus-
tralians. Newham is the son of a parson,
and was a theological student himself at
St. Francis’s, Brisbane, till he heard the
promptings of the call-boy, or the callings
of the prompter, and broke out with Nellie
Stewart in “Sweet Ellen.” He was after-
wards in comic opera with the Firm and
with the unsuccessful “Brass Bottle” Co.
Then he had a Marlow season, next was
S.-M. for George Willoughby, and after that
fe.M. in his native Brisbane for C. E.
King’s weekly change of gorodramas. Going
off with the 31st Battalion to the Great
Production, he pulled through till August,
18, when he got what was coming to him,
and was three months in hospital, gassed.
On recovering he had a year stage-managing
at the London Scala, where “The Net” was
produced, with Julius Knight, Susie
vaughan and other old friends in the cast,
including Herbert Fry, here long ago with
“What Happened to Jones.” Newham intro-
duced Julius to Ben Fuller at the Scala'-
they hadn’t met before. There is one other
Digger in the “Tiger Rose” cast, Robert
Purdie.
“O. Biin”: When Dan Barry proffered a
certain masterpiece of murder and arson for
tne consideration of a Booligum audience he
announced it, as usual, as the favorite litera-
ture of Queen Victoria. W. E. Gladstone and
General Booth. Booligum had a Salv’army
of seven locals, and the captain thereof sailed
up to Daniel to demand the withdrawal of
the insult to the General. Daniel sustained
with his customary resource
‘W hen the General saw that piece in Leices-
ter, said Barry, “he was deeply touched.
1 lemember him declaring that he never saw
anything that so beautifully expressed his
motto: Blood and Fire.’” The little cap-
tain slunk away, satisfied.
“Norbell”: I once heard George Rignold
rebuke a sprouting actor who had murdered
a small part. “All very well for you, guv’-
nor, was the apology, “you’re playing leads,
and good parts make good actors.” “Think
so? said the Big Chief drily. “Well, I’ve
seen some d—d bad Hamlets in my time.”
THE PETITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When I am dead,” the actor said,
“No pile of sculptured stones,
No Heaven-pointing pyramid,
No storied urn by elf bestrid
Uplift upon my bones.
“When I may pass no slabs of brass
Upon my body spread;
Tell not in glowing periods, please,
On gold my splendid qualities,
When presently I’m dead.
“Above my grave no column brave
Point to the azure sky;
No obelisk of rock erect;
For me produce no bronze effect
To mark where I may lie.
“No splendid tomb of marbled gloom
Raise on my dust. Oh, don’t
A monolith of granite grey
Set forth to advertise my clay.”'
And candidly we won’t!
VICTORIA.
STARGAZER.

The Giant of Electric Lighting
Outfits for Country Homes
Way out in the most remote places
throughout the country and far off in
the islands, hundreds of homes are enjoying
the comfort and convenience of electricity
through Western Electric Power and Light.
They switch on the lights every night, they
use electric gnllers, toasters, sewing ma-
chines, washing machines, irons, dishwash-
ers or vacuum cleaners, just as they do in the
most up-to-date homes in the biggest cities.
The superiority of Western Electric Power and
Light for country home lighting and for use in
halls, schools, churches, stores, hotels, and insti-
tutes is readily apparent to any man who sees it
Western Electric Power and Light'is bigger,
stronger, and therefore more reliable.
There is no need to keep the engine going for
hours every night to charge the battery when
the lights are switched on. The capacity of the
Western Electric Battery is 180 ampere hours
—more than twice the capacity of most electric
lighting plants. This means that you only charge
the battery once in a while. There is plenty of
current always available for all the lights inside
and outside of the home, with a surplus for operat-
ing many delightful electric appliances. It is the
added feature of electric power that makes West-
ern Electric Power and Light so desirable. It
brings an air of comfort and convenience to,the
country home no matter how far out you may be.
With the Western Electric Outfit you can use a
portable motor for driving the churn, grindstone,
and for doing many other little jobs like that.
Then the h.p. Kerosene Engine will drive
many other light machines whenever you need it.
Why this Outfit is Better Investment.
Size is everything in an electric light and power outfit.
There is no satisfaction in buying a small outfit —one that
only gives light and makes hard work of that little job.
Western Electric Power and Light has the big, strong bat-
tery of 180 ampere hour capacity on the 8-hour rate of dis-
charge (intermittent rating, 288 ampere hours). The
Western Electric Battery is given a tapering charge which
protects it and prolongs its life. This saves no end of
money The engine is 4-Cycle, 3Va h.p., with Throttle
Governor, Air-Cooling System, and Automatic Feed for
fuel and lubricating oil. Generator is 1500 watts capacity
and the whole outfit is controlled by a simple switchboard
that anyone can manage.
It’s easy to buy, too. Write for 20 page Book. Post

Theie has been such a general exposure
of form among the jumpers before the Australian
Hurdle, and Steeple at Caulfield come on for “dis-
cussmn ’ (which is the dailies’ term for betting)
that compared with the Nationals those riellly-
endowed events are uninteresing to early punters.
i{ ear first acceptances are below the average,
and the Hurdle, in particular, seems likely to see
not more than a dozen on the job. Doubtless Isaac
Moses remembers there was something of a turn-up
m each of the Caulfield events last year, but he
doesn’t talk about it. He prefers to starve prices
against fancied candidates, on the theory that very
few nags have a chance in either race. As a matter
o* fact, the Caulfield jumps give a chance to some
that blundered badly at Flemington. Distances are
longer, but so are the intervals between leaps, nor
are the toughest obstacles as tough as at Flemington.
Old Pistolier, with whom jumping is not a strong
point, is already down to a short price for the Aus-
tralian Hurdle, like Bright Plume; and Mountain
Cod is backed for the Steeple as though he had never
blundered in the National. In both races there are
others with pretensions. For instance, Two Blues
is said to have been unlucky in his recent falls,
and if this excuse be admitted, and Two Blues be
supposed to have improved during the past six weeks,
his chance is undeniable. To picture the respect-
able flat-racer as having got round ,the course with-
out hitting a hurdle is to wonder whether Pistolier,
Bright Plume, Sandule, Sir Mnemon and the rest
of them can live with him bn the handicap terms.
In the Steeplechase, on the other hand, one is bound
to give a chance to old Sir Prim, not because he is
favorably handicapped with Mountain God, Sir
Mnemon and others (which he certainly isn’t), but
because the top weight is the least likely fellow in
the field to come to grief, or clout the timber
violently'. But in either race one would prefer to
back something younger than Two Blues or Pisto-
lier or Sir Prim.
Tom Crothers, the squatfer who owns
Booster, and theatrical-manager George Marlow are,
with W. J. Foster, candidates for the vacancy on
the committee of Sydney Tatt.’s caused by the death
of Phil Glenister. Crothers was just pipped at the
last by-election after Frank Gaxieu’s death, when
the biggest poll in the club’s history was recorded.
Marlow is hoping to score on the * “young blood”
ticket.

At two years old the Linacre filly Sweet
Lady, winner of the Maribyrnong Plate, stood out as
easily the best of her year. After that she had an
eclipse or something, and she was five when she had
her next win—the Flying at Rosehill on Saturday.
A little bird had whispered something to Ike, and he
opened carefully, but she was well and truly backed
all the same. Sweet Lady’s former trouble was
rheumatism, and Booth seems to have banished it.
Phil Osborne’s colt Eearte, trained bv
Tom Payten, made no mistake about the Rosehill
Handicap. Though he had nothing much to beat, he
did what he was asked to do like a tradesman, and
such was the confidence of his supporters that he
dropped from 10’s to fives. Eearte is a well set up
customer, just on four years old, by Piquet from the
Orzil mare Queen Mary, and he shapes like a stayer.
In Saturday’s race Sydney Cup winner lan ’Or
arrived an inglorious last.

Flemington wfill never see tote divvies on
the scale customary in Maoriland if the V.R.C. has
to work on the demented three-dividend method
imposed on the machine in N. S. Wales. At Rosehill
on Saturday from 21 place dividends backers in six
cases got back less than they put in ; in four others
they got less than even money; in five more less
than 2 to 1 came their way. Only three were over
4 to 1; the biggest was less than 7 to 1.

“Billy T.”: At the annual sports meeting
at Six Mills the local volunteer fire brigade had
guven an attractive display of fire-fighting. Later in
the day came the Six Mills Hurdle, and Byron’s
black boy Gus was put up on Cameron’s big, rakish
bay horse Gin Pill, a nag that looked a good deal
like a baby pelican, all knees and elbows. Gus
was a stranger to Cameron's Gin Pill, but he had
the reputation of being able to ride anything over
everything, and he tackled the long, ramshackle
animal with the greatest confidence. Gin Pill
proved himself to be of the breed of climbers and
creepers. He could not gallop, and when he came
to a hurdle he scrambled up it, like a swarming
cat, and usually fell off the top. Black Gus had
three falls, but he was game, and swarmed aboard
each time, continuing the race manfully, it being
his belief that you never knew your luck in a
long run over timber, there being always a possi-
bility of all the nagis in front breaking their necks
before your mount could break his. Gin Pill climbed
the last hurdle with a terrific floundering action
and came in last, ambling like a tarantula. Then
Gus spake his opinion. “By cripes,’’ he said, “I
bet 10 tshillin’ this pfeller win that hose-and-ladder
race! ”

“Ex-Englishman”: It seems odd to read
(B. 15/7/’2O) of the alleged good nature of the
press in quoting—to please the bookies —long prices
that were never really laid about winners. The
difficulty of the sporting writer in England is just
the opposite. The money wagered at any meeting
is a mere trifle compared with that put on, all over
the country, at “starting price.” Large city offices,
with elaborate book-keeping staffs, exist to supply the
demand. They will even pay on a telegram received
after the result of the race is known, provided it
can be shown to have been despatched before.
WILLIAM
LEONARD , of
the V.R.C.
Committee—he
has been a member
of the club for
nearly 60 years
and of the com-
mittee for over
40 years.
(Hence some clever
swindles worked by a
backer in collusion
with a telegraph-office
clerk.) What the price
actually was at start-
ing time is left to the
verdict of one or other
of two sporting papers ;
and if the writers were
capable of being cor-
rupted, they could get
unheard-of bribes for,
not lengthening, but
shortening, the actual
price—which in many
cases, with a changing
market, is an arguable
figure, anyhow.
Ten years ago Paulhan flew v the 117 miles
from London to Lichfield in a few minutes under
thiee hours. Last Saturday 15 started in London’s
Aerial Derby of 200 miles, and the winner averaged
153 J m.p.h. The war is responsible. In the year
before it Harry Hawker—favorite for last week’s
event—could do no more than 1043 miles in his
attempted circuit of Great Britain, and Ross Smith’s
recent feat was unthinkable, Albert Hinkler, an-
other Australian, was second favorite for the blue
ribbon of the flying world, and the veteran Hain-
mersley, last year’s winner, was pushed on to a far-
back mark. F. Courtney, who won, is, like the
300-h.p. Martynside which he steered, a war-product.
IS. S. Wales is the Scotland of Australia.
* ll j ® c f^ an< l there is no hunting worthy the name,
and Scotch amateurs don’t favor jumping races.
At no time has the Mother State witnessed such a
spectacle as that which was on view at Moonee
V alley (Vic.) last wetk, when a dozen genuine
amateurs turned out for a £4OO steeplechase prize,
rhe best that N. S. Wales has done in recent years
was to stage an occasional Hunt Club ’chase in* con-
nection with the Drag pack which petered out
shortly oefore. the war. About half the pilots in
these events were usually professional dealers who
Had qualified by a ride or two with the hounds, and
were there for purely business purposes.

“Boz” : Anyone had a stranger golf ex-,
perience than this ? The other Sunday, on the
Metropolitan Links (Melb.), a friend made a good
drive, but the ball disappeared in a most bewilder-
ing way. Several who saw the drive joined in the
search, when one suggested asking a player who was
walking ahead with his bag slung over his hack, if
by any chance he had a ball not belonging to him in
his bag. The golfer was appealed to, and willingly
emptied his hag. To his astonishment, as well as
that of the other members, the lost ball was among
the contents. The query then arose, should the ball
have been played out of the bag?
“15-30”: The U.S. win over Britain for the
Davis Cup afforded further evidence of the remark-
able quality of William Tilden. Whereas his part-
ner, Johnston, only snatched a victory after hard-
fought five-set battles with Parke and Kingscote,
Tilden easily knocked out Kingscote by three sets
to one, whilst Parke was outplayed in every set.
Tilden is now described as “the greatest match-
player the world has ever ' produced.” He has
developed a hard, venomous service, and also employs
a cut-stroke that sends the ball to sleep as soon
as it reaches its destination. Added to this, he is
a hurricane volleyer, and generally mixes his shots
so cleverly that an opponent is beaten before he
discovers the American’s favorite game. Taking his
Davis Cup figures in conjunction with his Wimbledon
form, Kingscote seems entitled to stand next to
Tilden.. Certainly he was walloped by Johnston, but
he outran the Californian in the rush for the
Wimbledon Championships. Considering his age,
Kingscote is something of a marvel. Tilden is at
least 10 years younger, and Johnston must be five
years younger still,
Only 10,000 people went to Sydney
Sports Ground on Saturday to see the All Blacks,
just off the boat, beat N. S. Wales at the Rugby
Union game by 26—15. A noticeable feature of the
match was that the line was seldom in use, and in
consequence the game was proportionately fast and
furious. Although the Walers got the ball in the
scrums, they could not get it out to the backs. It
came out all right, but at Belliss’s or Carroll’s toe.
Beiliss weighs in the vicinity of 14st., and runs like
a deer. He had a hand in three of the earlier tries.
Jacobs, the visitors’ wing-forward, and the only
Maori in the team, was very smart round the scrum,
but he had a good deal of luck with the umpire.
Storey and Steel, on the wings, flashed like meteors
at times, but were patchy on the whole. Of the
home team Lawton stood out on his own: he was
easily the best back on the ground. Wogan was
brilliant—once or twice. Beith at full back showed
rare grit in going down on the ball in front of the
hulking M.L. forwards, and his coolness and clever
handling saved the situation repeatedly. Among the
forwards Watson, Fox and Bond battled gamely and
were always where the fur was flying.
The N.S.W. selectors have picked 20 to choose
from for next Saturday’s match. In the back
division Humphries will probably replace Walker
and Wogan may have to stand down for Farquhar
The country reps, played some way below inter-
national form. Eyre and McKay are the class of
men to pit against the visitors, being regular tear-
away forwards, and should be given a chance in the
second match.
Eastern Suburbs opened their scoring
account last Saturday in the first match of the
second round of Sydney League competition by wip-
ing the floor with Balmain. Scores 30 points (6
tries 6 goals) to 13 points (3 tries 2 goals). It was
the premiers’ first defeat this season. The Dockers
played as well as ever. Their trouble was that the
Tricolors 13 played better. Sandy Pearce robbed
them of the ball, and Solomon Kaufmann consistently
whipped it away to Chunder Caples, who played the
game of his life, fending, dummying and cutting-in
splendidly. Hobo Cubitt up to the time of his
retirement rose to great heights, notably in his mag-
nificent dash which sent Thumbling Wright over
the line. Wally Messenger also took a passage to
the dressing-room in consequence of a ricked knee
after piloting one goal. However, the Norman
brothers, Ray and Rex, stepped into the breach, and
landed goals with much regularity. Easts replaced
Cubitt and Messenger by Hume and Thompson;
they pulled “Bluey” Watkins out of the forwards
into the threequarter line, and gave his position to
I hompson. With Wright, Norman, Watkins and
Huine as threequarters Easts went ahead at a great
rate. Wright scored five tries. The diminutive one
should certainly rep. against Queensland. Bluey
Watkins, as usual, performed magnificently: he
should be permanently retained in the rearguard.
The surfers’ forwards were above themselves. Old
Sandy got the ball with monotonous regularity,
whilst Duffy, Botsy Williams and Chi 11a Lees gal-
loped great guns. ’Main’s best man was Junka
Robinson, good in attack, solid in defence. Craig
got but one chance, and then Bluey Watkins stood
him up .six yards and grassed him before he g'ot
50yds. Chook Fraser meandered about looking a
much better player than he really was. His line
kicking was distinctly bad. Pony Halloway was
sound and resourceful, but Kaufman was too slip-
pery for him, and the veteran retired to the five-
eighth possy, where he proved more successful
in stopping the
slaughter. The
Dockers’ ruckers were
solid, but failed to
open up the game like
their opponents. Chang
Schultz, Snowy Latta
and Burly Russell
shone out. In the
other games. Norths
slathered Newtown in
the last stride by 10
to eight. Souths
administered a 14-
points-to-seven hiding
to Wests. Chunkey
Burge and some other
Glebeites walloped
Annan dale, the
wooden-spooners, by 46
points (of which Burge
accounted for 28) to
11, while Uni. played
the bye.

N. S. Wales’s trouncing of Victoria in the
revived inter-State baseball clash at Petersham on
Saturday by 27 runs to three was a record for the
series. W. Ford’s pitching did it. The Southerners
scored only once-—in the second innings, when
Rodgerson’s mighty biff sent Baster and Vaughan home,
and Kodgerson whirled round the diamond through Alan
Kippax’s failure at third base to pick up a whiz-
bang by Thompson. N. S. Wales belted A. Lans-
downe’s pitching to all the corners in the field,
and on top of it the Vic. fielders let their pitcher
down badly. With the substitution of L. Garris
as pitcher, Vic. rallied, but it remained outclassed.
N.S.W. made 26 hits and three errors; Victoria’s
figures were three hits and 26 errors—which just
about sized up the match. A. Emmerick (first base,
N.S.W.) was the star of the show.

Although 35 faced the starter in the N. S.
Wales five-mile novice cross-country championship
at Rose Bay (Sydney) on Saturday, 75 per cent,
faded out before half the journey had been tra-
versed. The real tussle narrowed down to ex-
Diggers W. T. May (Souths) and W. Porter (Easts),
and in a ding-dong finish they passed the judge in
that order, with only five seconds between them.
May’s time (30min. 40sec.) has been beaten in only
three out of five championships. The “teaming” of
Botany took the club championship with 24 points
8) from Easts (33 points) and Souths
(oi) ; the other three clubs failed to get four men
past the tape to count for the title.
Hubie Hinton, the N. S. Wales up-
country middle-weight, was overwhelmed by the
importance of the occasion at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night. His effort against Billy Shade.
l> * V-' S ” w . as rern inis cent of that put up by
reter Felix against Jack Johnson in the dim past,
in other words, he was outed before he went into
action. The massacre lasted only a couple of
minutes, in the course of which he was dropped
three times, and only saved from a fourth visit to
the boards by the merciful interference of the
referee.
Jimmy Hill, the brilliant feather of other
years, canie back as a lightweight in opposition to
Beit Seccombe at Sydney Hippodrome last week. He
made no mistake .about the affair, and beat the
younger artist from start to finish. What Hill is
yearning for is a match with Symonds or Godfrey
or both, and there is no doubt that on present form
he would draw against either of them.

The coming English XI has a useful
appesirance on paper. Reggie Spooner, the captain
(like Warner and the late “Tip” Foster, in 1904,
Hip be i m K k 4 ln ? a honeymoon of the tour), is
the prettiest bat m England, ranking for natural
grace with stylists such as Ranji, Trumper and

has known. He has said that he won’t make the

has been doing wonderfully this year, will take his
place. I arkin is 10 years younger than his fellow
Leagueite; he takes nothing out of himself while
bowling and he is a useful bat, which Barnes isn’t
;;: K " c T drea ‘ of the most effective little forcing
bats in England. London Daily Mail remarked
a couple of months ago that “no Test
team _ would be complete without him”; and
Bussell, of Essex, is another of the some class. Fender
is an amateur who played his first big cricket for
Sussex, and is now the particular' star of Surrey.
He made a clinking 70 for England against a strong
Dominions team in 1919, and did the job in a shade
over 40 minutes. He should more or less atone
101 the funereal Douglas. Every member of the
team has served either in the Navy (Woolley), the
Air Force (Hobbs) or the Army (the rest).
. AJplffideVery glad to see an allusion
to a bleak oval in Victoria (B. 15/7/’2O). It
shows that the word is gradually working along.
Kennington Oval, London, happened to be laid out
in that shape. The Cricket Association of S. Aus.
happened to copy Kennington when making its
ground at Adelaide. Then various suburbs and coun-
try towns said “We will have an oval, too,” and
the word was universally adopted in South Aus
for a recreation-ground. Australia in general has
been slow to adopt it, but could easily be accus-
tomed (per Bulletin) to do so. It has of course
a greater significance where thd Australian code of
football is played, because that actually requires
an oval-shaped ground. But it is in itself short, dis-
tinctive and worthy of universal adoption for any
recreation-enclosure.
Persistence and Ted Cotter, M.L.A., have
won for Richmond Cricket Club the extra strip
of l aria Park it coveted to enlarge the ground
big football matches. It won’t make much
difference to the park, as the thickest part of the
strip is a swampy corner, which will have a mound
built upon it to increase the .standing space, for
spectators.
“D.” : In the first race for the -America
Cup recently, the defender, Resolute, failed to
finish owing to a gear-breakage. In the second
neither yacht finished. Shamrock “failed five times
,o pass the first mark owing to shifts and calms ”
and was “15 minutes sailing half a mile.” Lipton
claims to have spent £1,000,000 on this sport.
Somewhat similarly, history records that in Charles
fox _s day, when Crockfords was in its prime, pro-
portionate fortunes were gained and lost over a
struggle between two beetles on a dining-table

d ® ad y e D D you want to see cock-fighting go to
Wollongong (N.S.W.) any week-end. The bird-
fanciers gather chiefly at Fig-tree, two miles out
from town.
The world’s speediest motorist is Tommy
Milton, who at Daytona Beach (U.S.A.) the other
day ruined all records from one kilometre up to five
miles. His cigar-shaped car, which is driven by
two eight-cylindered engines—one to each back
wheel—covered one run at the rate of 156 miles
an hour.
* * * *
W. S. Miller, in a Chandler Six, recently
covered the 471 miles from Auckland to Wellington
(M.L.) in 16hr. Bmin. (the actual running time was
14hr. 6min.) and, ferried across the Straits, he drove
the same car from Picton to the Bluff (704 miles)
in 20hr. dead. The average for the car in the South
Island was 38 miles an hour actual running time, a
fine achievement considering the roads and a note-
worthy sequel to several fine inter-capital perform-
ances in Australia.

What is the ole gime cornin’ to?
Time was, which I remember well,
When lads all had a right to do
The humpire up ’iT give him ’ell.
If yous had backed your team to win,
And then it didn’t, ’ard ’n’ grim
You follered Mister Humpire in,
And took your bob’s worth out of him.
All in the day’s play that was, Ned.
The humpire had his uses then—
You hung a brickbat on his ’ead,
And cooled your hevil passions, when
You sunk the blucher in his ribs.
Now Central hasn’t any pride;
An’ in a tank they store his nibs,
And we goes ’ome unsatisfied.

The little girls pursoo the sphere.
The flappers gowned in every tint,
A pink balloon will kick and slam,
And then the packed in lint,
The gime will foller —in a pram!

Old Folks Need Bitro-Phospliate.
OFTEN MAKES THEM LOOK AND FEEL
TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER.
Young-, strong and vigorous at seventy
would be the rule and not the exception if
you only kept your nerves strong and your
blood full of red cells. If you want to cover
your frame with solid flesh, if you want the
courage, strength, health and endurance of
twenty or thirty years ago, go to your
nearest chemist and get a package of Bitro-
Phosphate, and take one tablet with each
meal. Bitro-Phosphate quickly and surely
restores your nervous energy and vitality
and supplies that rich, red, strength-building
blood. Bitro-Phosphate will make you feel
and look younger, stronger and more
vigorous; and, as it is obtainable of chemists
everywhere, you should get a package of
Bitro-Phosphate to-day, take as directed, and
note how quickly you begin to feel better,
how much better you sleep, how your appe-
tite improves, and, best of all, tiie gradual
return of that strength, endurance, energy
and joy of living you used to feel twenty or
thirty years ago.— Advt.

Warner's
Rust-Proof
Corsets
Sailormen on the Renown tell how
Edward’s most motherly mother, upon fare-
welling him at Portsmouth, went straight for
his cabin and patted the pillow and turned
down the sheets.
Launceston gave the Prince a charming
suite of rooms at the Brisbane Hotel, which
must have been a godsend to the over-tired
young man after the formalities of Govern-
ment Houses. But even when on licensed
premises he found his monogram on all the
bed-linen. It had been worked by the Sisters
of the local convent.
The Prince had glorious weather for his
visit to the Speck. Frosty nights and fine,
cloudless days for a week on end established
a July weather record for the island, and
partly on that account first Hobart and then
Launceston beat all previous performances.
Both cities did themselves proud in street
decorations, and the night illuminations well
advertised the fact that the Speck can sport
more electric candle-power than any other
speck of its size on the planet.
The two dancing functions at which the
visitor jazzed in Hobart were easily the most
gorgeous and joyous ever seen in the village.
The Prince was expected to set local maiden-
hood all of a ditherum by introducing a spice
of variety into his choice of hop-mates, but
he stuck pretty close to the official path. His
partners, besides the Mayoress, the two Gelli-
brand girls and the Premier’s daughter, were
Miss (Attorney-General) Propsting and
Margery Jones, daughter of the Jam knight.
The name of the mainland girl who was cir-
cumstantially alleged to have arrived in
Hobart in advance of the Renown, under
practical engagement as dancing partner, to
the Prince, turned out to be Miss Myth.
While the Prince was inspecting the in-
terior of the Soldiers’ Hostel at Launceston
some waggish Diggers solemnly formed them-
selves into a hollow square in front of the
exit steps of the building, while a hard-
faced comrade drew. a chalk circle on the
pavement and gravely deposited in the centre
thereof a match-box kip and two pennies,
flanked by a neatly lettered intimation that
the articles were for the use of “Ted, Prince.”
When “Ted, Prince,” appeared and saw the
elaborate preparations he grinned apprecia-
tively, and promptly stooping for the kip
vigorously “sent ’em up.” While the cheer-
ing, laughing crowd surged in to “mark”
the coin as they descended, H.R.H. slipped
into his car and got away.
It was at the Launceston civic reception
of H.R.H.; and when the turn of local
aldermen and M’s.P. came the M.C.
addressed them: “Aldermen and members
will now please come forward with their
own wives.”
The Hobart Citizens’ Ball succeeded beyond
all expectations. Young Wales arrived half
an hour earlier than they had expected to see
him, and stayed half an hour longer—until
midnight. The Governor’s daughters and a
bunch of girls were at Government House
awaiting his return; but so late was he
that there was only time for one dance with
Miss Allardyce and one with Jean Mande-
ville before he made off to bed. Perhaps the
Citizens won him, to start with, by leaving
out the lancers. There was also less starch
than usual at the supper, though it was of
the sit-down, groaning-board type. He had
lost his voice and could only whisper what
he thought of it all. In particular, he liked
the decorations, which were mountain ber-
ries, native heath and ferns. Candles were
shaded with the favorite royal yellow. Mrs.
Murdoch collected congratulations for the
adornments.
H.R.H. danced every dance. Two were
bagged by the Mayoress, Mrs. Eccles Snow-
den, one by Premier Lee’s daughter, and
another by Miss Gellibrand. daughter of the
General who preferred an Aussie hat to the
most brassy cap you could show him.
At the Mayoral Ball, which happened later,
the good-looking Mayoress came in for several
more Prince dances. A favorite partner,
whom H.R.H. chose for himself several
times, was little Doris Burgess, grand-
daughter of the late J.W. She is a pretty
little brunette, and Wales introduced her
to cousin Louis with the recommendation,
“She is a bonzer dancer.” And then Louis
proceeded to find it out for himself.
Hobart’s Mayoress, the success of the
Prince’s Tasmanian tour, was a Miss Isaacs
of Sydney before she became Eccles Snow-
den’s wife.
Appointment of a new Governor is ex-
pected about the end of this or early
next month. Ministers have informed the
Colonial Office that Martin Hannah’s motion
to discontinue the present system of appoint-
ment was opposed by them and that it was
knocked out. lii other words, “The coast is
clear; who’s your man?” It is safe to guess
that Ministers did not elaborate their mess-
age by adding that Treasurer McPherson,
who discussed with Milner the discontinuance
of the present system on the ground of
economy, did not vote or pair, although he
was in the House while the matter was de-
bated. When in England last year McPher-
son credited Milner with saying that Lieut. -
Governors would meet the needs of the
States, but during the debate he said it
was only fair to say that the Colonial Sec-
retary had written declaring that he had not
put it quite like that. Naturally he
wouldn’t.
Hilary Rolls, who had several dances with
the Prince in Perth, is a tall brunette —
considerably taller than her partner. Perth
had heard the story that H.R.11. preferred
short girls, and when he chose Hilary from
the garland of jazzing girlhood Groper
Sassiety ’gasped. Hilary’s mother, who
looks almost as young' as her daughter, was
not Florrie Green—she was Maria. All the
Green girls were beautiful dancers, and the
Rolls damsels—there are two—inherit their
mother’s talent.
They say the young Lady Allardyce is a
good housewife as well as a sporting and
jazzing enthusiast. After six cooks had
come and gone her Ex. took command of
f d and that’s how the Prince was
Do you want to feel old? Bridget and
Patience Fuller, fluffy-haired tots when pa
and ma were at Stonington, are pictured in
a recent English paper as a pair of beauti-
ful girls with their hair up. Bridget was
presented at one of the Garden Courts.
Mrs. Harry ■ Emmerton hostessed a large
afternoon-tea frivol at her South Yarra
house to meet the Glasgow and Ryrie dames
the ballroom, which is furnished as a recep-
tion apartment when not needed for a jazz
was crowded with the Best People. Walter
Kirby soothed them with song to Billy Bur-
rell’s accompaniments. After the guests
thinned out, Walter sang little coon songs
and delighted the three little Emmerton
gi and-daughters, who fluttered under the
wing of the mother, Mrs. Norman Brookes.
Mrs. ,T. S. Merrillees, who passed out at
Hawthorn a few days ago, spent the best
part of half a century there. Of strong per-
sonality and vigorous intellect, she passed
some of her qualities to her four sons.
Three of them—Jack, of Auburn; Jim, of
Queensland and Crich,ton—took up medi-
cine and are doing well. .Tack has the
leading practice at Haw-hawthorn.
Doris Hadden, whom Vandyck shows in
this dainty picture, is the very young pianist
who has just been
attached to the
teaching staff of the
Albert-street Conser-
vatorium. Doris was
playing with the
piano when other
youngsters of her
years were busy with
toys. At seven years
she had battled
successfully wd. t b
musica 1 examina-
tions, and while still
in her teens sin;
negotiated the higher
public examinations
of Melbourne Uni.
and of Trinity College, London, under the
guidance of Edward Scharf, with whom she
did four years’ solid study. Melbourne
always gives the young Australian, whose
talent has been wholly developed in Aus-
tralia, an appreciative hand when she
appears on a platform.
Charlie Beveridge, of Trinity, and Willie
Merrylees, of Queen’s, have been picked as
the Vic. Rhodes scholars for 1920 and 1921.
Beveridge had a long innings at Geelong
Grammar, where he was a steady goer as
a student and a tiptop all-round sport. At
the Uni. he has bagged his B.Sc., and is in
his third year of medicine. As he is only
22 (Samoa is his birthplace) he has not
wasted much time. Merrylees has had a
harder climb. His father was a cocky at
Mt. Jephcott, near Charlton. He plugged
away at the local State school, and then
persuaded dad to give him a show at Charl-
ton (State) Higher Elementary School.
After that came a scholarship and Wesley,
and now Oxford and Rhodes’s bounty loom
ahead. The democratic element on the Board
of selectors put up a successful fight for
the hayseed’s son against much naicer young
men.
Mrs. Henderson (her husband plants
cocoanuts in the Solomons) is visiting Mel-
bourne for a month or two. She was Eileen
Hardiman and one of Melbourne’s beauties
in her flapper days. The other girls won-
der how she keeps her complexion in the
Bougainvilles. She wonders how they keep
theirs in Melbourne.
Hobart’s veteran librarian, Alfred J. Tay-
lor, who was half-way through the door of
the Great Silence a year ago, and deliber-
ately turned back to resume his old job of
overlordship at his beloved Library, is mourn-
ing the death of his wife. The lady was
over SO and looked less than 50.
Miss Wharton, daughter of the mining
man, had a big dance at Cliveden last week.
The flatters were exhilarated by the sight
of an impromptu free bar working overtime
in the lounge, in charge of the real thing in
barmen.
There is to be a Juvenile Ball (curious
how many grown-ups think they are juvenile
when there is a good floor and jazz music)
in the St. Kilda. Town Hail to-morrow (July
30), to help the Purple Cross and the
S.P.C.A. Miss Montgomery, of Woranga,
Toorak, is engineering the show.
Mrs. Carnegie (she was Teenie Mackay,
of Bendigo) is oft' to Cairns with a small
party of young people under her wing. One
of the tourists is a niece from England.
In bleak, showery weather the Edward
equestrian statue was unveiled by the G.-G.
last week. Official folk, with overcoats but-
toned up to their ears and carrying ’brellas,
looked as patient as sheep while his Ex.
spoke his piece about the good fellow who
had too short an innings as a monarch ; and
Frank Madden, chairman of the memorial
committee, did a little hifalutin’. The City
Council is to look after the memorial.
Adelaide surveys the week :
Ted Bagshaw and pretty dark-eyed Dorothy Fitch’
are going to dance through life together.
Captain Harry Butler, our intrepid aviator, said
“Fly with me!” to Elsa Gibson, of Narracoorte,
and the other Wednesday morning they flew—by
honeymoon motor-ear. They were sped on their
way by the cheers and .confetti of about 3000 people
who had gathered outside the church. It was the
prettiest and most popular wedding the South-East
has had for a very long time.
Daisy Kennedy charmed her ever-increasing audi-
ences at the four concerts just concluded. Her
wonderful fiddling is helped out by her engaging
personality and original dressing. On Tuesday she
wore a striking white satin garment evidently in-
spired by an arum-lily. Few women could have
worn it and looked so lovely.
His E*. was unable to attend the University Ball
on Friday night; but his radiant and already popu-
lar wife had recovered from her cold, and looked
charming in a wonderful white and silver frock.
The formal vice-regal set was cut out and the revel
went with a swing. The futuristic decorations were
planned and arranged by Mrs. Arthur Rymill.
The South Australian Hotel, the most prominent
thing in sight as you leave the Adelaide Railway-
Station, was up for sale last week. Unlike some
other large properties lately offered, it sold —for
£32,500. The buyers were 'Syd Kidman and John
Lewis.
Adelaide had hardly got over the shock of the
Prince’s visit when somebody whispered that it
might next year be visited by Princess Marie Louise,
daughter of Princess Christian, and she was the
third daughter of Queen Victoria. Marie Louise is
a friend 'of Lady Weigall, and if Edward gives a
good account of South Aus. she will come.
Australia has lost a talented daughter in Mrs.
Esmond George, who died in Adelaide on the 18th.
Westralian-born, she was a story-writer, poster-
artist and platform-entertainer, and clever in each
department; but ill-health clouded her young life.
Her Australian novel, “Sandplains,”, will "be posthu-
mously published.
Jean Fairbairn is wearing the diamond
ring of Robert Landale, and Sassiety is in a
flutter over the conjunction of two .such
names. It scarcely seems necessary to add
that she is the youngest daughter of the
Fred Fairbairns, and that his family-tree
rears its head at Mundiwa, Deniliquin.
Leo Little, one of the first Anzads, got
back only this month with a Military Gross
and Bar. He arrived by the Osterley on
a Monday, and on Wednesday was married
at St. Pat.’s Cathedral to an English girl
—Doris Speck, of Earle’s Court, London.
Crowds of soldier-friends rolled up to see
the knot-tying through. Brother Jerry
Little was best man, and Una Anderson had
the bridesmaid’s job. The bridegroom is a
Werribee boy who is “doing law.” The white-
robed bride was the prettiest thing, and
several soldier cameras took snaps of her
as she smiled and rustled in the wind on
the Cathedral steps. The pair went off to
snowy Buffalo for the honeymoon, and
wail that all their baggage was lost for
three days before the railways landed it at
Bright.
Unemployed Y.A.’s might do worse than go
in for physical-culture training. At least
one Melbourne school is begging for instruc-
tors. It cannot get enough girls to take
on the work. The school has charge of the
training at many colleges, and as fast as a
girl is fit she trots off to a position of
command.
Alice Anderson, a young motor mechanic
who runs a garage and employs women
chauffeurs, was to open a new garage with
a flounsh of teacups on July 28. This is
tne hrst Australian women’s garage, and
arent they proud of it! Work has tumbled
in at such a rate that they simply had to
hnd more room.
Katherine Thom succeeds Margaret Cuth-
oertson as senior inspectress of Factories,
one has earned her promotion by alert work,
but will have to do with half the money a
pnvate firm now pays Miss Cuthbertson for
seeing that it observes the industrial laws.
Horace Stevens has had to put aside the
forceps and give all his attention to his
voice. After the
war, in which he
served in the Dental
Corps, he made a
sudden hit in Lon-
do n. Concert-plat-
forms haunted b.v
the best professional
artists at once found
room for him, and
engagements rolled
his way. He came
on to Australia
lately to get his dis-
charge and say
“How-do” from the
platform to his Aus-
tralian friends, and
when that job is
completed and a
short concert season
finished he returns to England to fulfil some
imposing contracts.
The National Art Galleries are so dread-
fully out of date that they will go as soon
as we can spare the money for a new build-
ing. Two sites are suggested. One is the
unused triangular reserve in Evelyn and
Albert streets (opposite the princess’s
Theatre), which is part of the Federal Par-
liamentary area. The other is the High
School site, in Spring, Evelyn and Victoria
streets, if it is not wanted for a new Town
Hall. The Parliamentary area can be spared,
and an art gallery building would not be an
inharmonious neighbor. Members might
also get some relief from the constant con-
templation of those portraits in the Queen’s
Hall.
The Queen Victoria Hospital, which is
run by women for women, is making a special
appeal for £20,000. The institution is
unique in this, that it is not in debt; but
it is sadly in need of more room. At present
there is no separate ward for children, so
little “cases” have to be turned away; and
in general beds are so scarce that other
patients may only stay until it is safe to
move them. The appeal should get a quick
resppnse. If you want to make sure that
money is sorely needed call any Friday
afternoon: there will be a member of the
committee and a doctor on hand to show
you round. The hospital is tucked away
at the back of what used to be Dr. Fitz-
gerald’s Hospital, at the corner of William
and Little, Lonsdale streets.
The Purple Cross, having no war horses
to help, is now intent on helping the hard-
worked mokes of the city. Poor old neddies
whose owners cannot afford to put them out
for a holiday may nibble grass once more
at the equine rest-home at Dandenong,
where there are 340 acres of pasture and
plenty of water. The lodgers are carefully
rugged at night, and looked after by Captain
R. H. Heywood, V,C. A pound subscribed
means a month’s rest for some horse. The
two Montgomerys (those very horsey
Toorakians who could ride since they could
walk) are bracketed as vice-presidents.
Kendall is secretary, and his assistant is
Maude Harvie, who helped to push the
Purple Cross along from its beginning.
A Melbourne weekly was anxious to have
a drawing of Mr. K., whose eminence had
been emphasised by a recent political event,
so it put a specialist on the job. The artist
set out in pursuit of his prey, a sitting
being to success. He was told that
Mr. K. had gone to Heidelberg or some such
place for the week-end, and Willie Map-
pingpen ran K. to earth. He was in a
fairy bower in the woods, and he introduced
Mappingpen /to the handsome lady at his
side with a sweep of the arm, and a “Mr.
Mappingpen, my dear—-clever young artist.”
Mappingpen was happy to know Mrs. K.,
and said so. He had the sitting, he had some
tea (for which he expressed his thanks to
Mrs. K.), and on going he complimented
Mrs. Iv. on her pleasant little home and the
success of her eminent husband. K. fol-
lowed Mappingpen to the gate. “Glad to
have met you, my boy,” he said. “Here’s
a little souvenir of our meeting.” He took
a wallet from his pocket, and drew from it
a photograph. “Myself and wife,” said Iv.
“Study it well, won’t you? Excellent like-
nesses.” Later Mappingpen had a look at
the picture, and understood K.’s tact. The
Mrs. K. of the photograph was not the
Mrs. Iv. of the rosy bower, and naturally,
taking Mappingpen’s pencil into considera-
tion, it was advisable that Mappingpen
should know it.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
David
Jones
Cataloger.
When the kiddies at home are plump and
bonny, it isn’t easy to remember that a
two-section tram-fare from King-street will
carry you to a deep valley of suffering where
all the wayfarers are tiny tots struggling
under the heavy burdens of pain and disease
among the foothills that lead to the Delec-
table Mountains, whose tops are abloom with
roses for healthy cheeks. The Royal Alex-
andra Hospital for Children is in the heart
of Camperdown, past the wide playing fields
and handsome colleges of the University, side-
tracked from the highway where health and
business roar in unceasing traffic.
The verandahs and wards are the only
home some of the children have ever known.
In a sunny spot on a side verandah is Lucy’s
cot. Lucy has been in the hospital since
she was six months old ; and she now owns
to two years and a bit. There is radiant health
and beauty in cheeks and golden hair and
blue eyes; but the right knee wears a plaster
cast, for T.B. was born in the baby limb.
Lucy holds regal sway over the staff; to-day
one artistic hand has placed on the pillow
a pink carnation, and the baby cheek that
brushes it outrivals it in coloring. A small
ward where there are only a few cots will
be the home of Gladys for a long, long day.
Gladys, aged four, has never seen the Avorld
of sun and flowers and toys; and a
few weeks ago one of the sightless eyes had
to be, removed. Was it the finger of forebod-
ing on the child-heart that caused her, on the
day she was-going into the hospital, to pipe
over and over again, all through the long
hours, “Here we suffer grief and pain,” till
her father’s heart was torn with the agony
of it?
Down some steps past a lawn where two
small boys, crutches laid aside, are pommell-
ing each other from sheer high spirits, around
a corner, and on to another lawn where chil-
dren more grown-up are busy over a com-
petition. Here a chocolate-colored young
man from Tilba Tilba flashes a mouthful of
pearls in a smile of welcome. There is a
sudden yell from the balcony above and an
uproar from the boys in the cots on the
lawn. On top of the steps leading from
the balcony stands one of the gardeners
holding aloft something that looks like a
yellow-coated cocoanut. “Mr. Harris! Mr.
Harris ! Here, Mr. Harris !” But Mr.
Harris runs down the steps to a tousled fair
head in one of the cots below, and drops the
gift upon the cot. Instantly there is a veil
from about 20 throats. “You mighter give
me the football, Mr. Harris!” Pair Head
cuddles it, then throws it to his neighbor.
A football, and most of the jolly squabblers
are wearing an ominous plaster coating on
knee or hip! Up in wards as bright as
nurses’ hands can make them with flowers
and gay lamp-shades and bed-quilts, wasted
limbs and bodies quiver with pain. At one
bedside a woman in black’ keeps watch over
her small one. “He’s got the sleeping sick-
ness,” she says dully. “The doctor says he’s
improving. I don’t know—he seems very
heavy. I had one die here last week from
meningitis.” The eyes under the black
straw brim look out in dull wonder at the
blows of Pate.
The hospital sends out its appeal. It has
thirteen of the sixty thousand necessary to
equip it for the increasing number of patients
from all over the State that clamor at its
doors. At the present time there are 175
children who should really be within relegated
to the out-patients’ list. Every week the hos-
pital turns out miraculous cures. It wages
unending war against T.B. and conquers in
almost every case where it gets the child
young enough. Crooked limbs are straight-
ened ; and the weakly children who are borne
inside its gates walk sturdily from them the
healthy little citizens of our Great Australia
that is to be.
What help are you giving?
Across a socially-arid week the John
McCormack voice flashed like a fountain in
the desert, and audiences as cosmopolitan as
Darlmghurst itself filled and brimmed the
Town Hall. For the opening night every
diamond was taken out of the safe deposit
and every fur coat off its peg; and at five
minutes to eight the vestibule resembled a
combined St. Patrick’s Day celebration and
an up-to-date passage of the Red Sea At
eight John billowed, rather like a heavy bal-
loon, on to the stage. Accompanist Schneider
played the opening bars. Then out flowed
the voice. More liquid, more mellow, than
of old, in spite of the recent attack of laryn-
gitis. “O Sleep, why dost thou leave me?”
he sang, and in his encore number flung a
golden apple of liquid vowels into the hall.
Little Mrs. McCormack sat in the front
rows in a perfectly-gorgeous tailless ermine
coat that covered a brocade gown but left
visible the pearls. Brother James squired
her. Mrs. Toohey in diamonds and black
velvet kept a friendly eye upon the little wife,
who in turn kept an anxious gaze, in the
passionate passages, upon the lower buttons
of John’s vest.
Every parish priest and Catholic curate
who could snatch the night off added a
clerical collar to the dressing of the ’house.
If Justice herself was not present, she sent
her representatives, of whom the Gordons
were among the front-seaters. Jolly Dr. Dan
Kelly and his music-loving wife had come
from Kirribilli; the Herbert Markses added
the family complexion and fur coats to the
assemblage; the Hughes circle came in force.
Violinist Mcßeath’s family watched their
Donald with pride; but teacher Josephine
Moses was kept away in the Mountains.
Mrs. Freehill was there; Irish enthusiast
Bea Macdonald brought sister Peggy and
a brand-new .evening frock; and Harry
Cohen’s beautiful missus had many an eye
upon her.
In the artists’ room at the end of the
concert John encased his jubilant bulk in
his astrachan-trimmed top coat, and laughed
and joked with ail-comers. The room was
a seething sea of femininity, and accom-
panist Schneider blushed under the bouquets
that were showered upon him.
Ruddy-haired Lieut. Charles Webb, second-
in-charge of the Biloela, became a Benedick
the other day for the second time to the
one Beatrice. Charles first met her in Italy
when she nearly drove over him with her
huge motor-transport vehicle. Followed
other dates, when the lady wasn’t so high
up in the world, and a rush courtship in
England, where Mrs. Webb’s father is a
vicar. On sudden orders to sail, there was
a Registry-office marriage 20 minutes be-
fore the gallant naval man’s train left Lon-
don. A week or two ago the lady arrived
in Sydney, and immediately there was, by
her dad’s wish, a marriage service at St.
Philip’s.
The recent death of Percy Douglas marks
the passing of another of the old homes of
Woollahra—probably into the hands of the
building speculator. Mrs. Percy, who died
some years ago, was a Maddrell, of Braid-
wood, and her special weakness was a won-
derful collection of gold spoons.
Josie Westaway, the pretty little soprano
who went off to India with the Freddie
Shipman company, will return with a wed-
ding certificate and a husband, Captain Her-
bert Iveywood, who lives at Quetta, India.
The marriage took place at the R.C. Can-
tonment Church (St. John’s), Mary Laing
Meason helping it along—for which she re-
ceived a gold wristlet-watch and the thanks
of both parties. Josie finishes her contract,
then picks up her new husband in Java, and
they both come on to Australia to meet her
people, who live at Burwood.
Sculptor Nelson
Illingworth looks out
at you here. The
little man with the
clever modelling
fingers, whose bust
of Birdwood is such
a vivid likeness, has
been quite a feature
of artistic Sydney
for many years. A
charming statuette
by Mr. Illingworth
will keep the Chal-
lenge Cup company
next Friday when
the women’s fencing championship of Aus-
tralia will be decided.
Died last Friday, in a private hospital in
Darlinghurst, Mrs. Maurice Potts, who used
to be Blanche Wallace, one of the six front-
row beauties of the Williamson shows of 12
or 14 years back —the front row that made
an enormous hit in the “Tell me, pretty
Maiden,” chorus of “Florodora.” Of late
years Blanche has been a golf expert and
a wonderful housekeeper. The husband, who
was in Melbourne when the dangerously-ill
telegram flashed to him, managed to reach
his wife’s bedside just in time for the end.
The walls of the Salon of Fine Art are
shared this week by the water-colors of
Alice Norton (Mrs. Allan Stephens) and
Gladys Owen. Mrs. Stephens, who was one
of the pioneers of the Society of Artists,
has not exhibited for the past six years,
and the 21 canvases in the present collec-
tion are the products of the days of peace.
“Across the Valley” makes most appeal to
the imagination, holding something of the
lure of the beyond; and “The Home Pad-
dock” and “The Poplars” are quiet bits of
charm. Gladys Owen’s Red Cross and
Peace Loan efforts have their effect in the
hurried look of the work in her share of
the exhibition. The imagination is stirred,
however, by the whispering mystery of
“Under the Pines,” and “The Road” flings
out a beckoning sunburnt arm from leafy
screenings.
Hugh Ward sailed last week for America,
with a beautifully-fitted travelling-case from
the front of the house-staff of Her Majesty’s,
after a perfectly wonderful farewell lunch
from the head office of the Firm. Mrs.
Ward remains in Sydney.
The morning after Hugh Ward left Syd-
ney, Cissie Jamieson, who has ueen confi-
dential secretary to the Firm for 16 years,
starting with J.C.W. himself, received a
nicely-typed four lines and a month’s salary,
the reason given being the amalgamation of
the Tait 'and Williamson forces. She goes
to spend a vacation at the Philip Mortons’,
Rawdon, Rylstone.
Columbus is to be given a chance to dis-
cover handsome Vera Pearce, who before
she queened it with the Tivoli was one of
Williamson’s cleverest dancers. But the
very qualities of height and dimension that
afterwards made her the most, striking panto-
mime boy who has swaggered about oqr stages
was against her qualifying for the Russian
ballet. Vera of the deep eyes has come on
enormously of late; some of the parts she
was called on to fill in “As You Were” gave
her the chance so long denied her in the
Tivoli bills, which for years had tried to fit
her, whom Nature built on the heroic plan,
into a Yankee-built soubrette costume. She
is on the Ventura.
Donald Mcßeath, who is touring with
John McCormack, is
a Marrickville boy.
John first met the
youth in 1912, when
Mother Rectress of
Lewisham pushed
him under the visi-
tor’s notice. Jose-
phine Moses had
been his only teacher,
and the fine singing
tone that Donald
draws from his
fiddle is a credit to
his early lessons.
Up till 1912 Donald
had intended to be
a doctor. Late in
1915 he went to be
a flying soldier. Now
he intends to put up
a fight with Kreisler for the U.S.A. belt
and purge for fiddle champion.
The Millions Club gave President Arthur’s
son Lance a welcome-home dinner. After
gaining an M.C. and his majority at the war
the young artilleryman went off to Ireland
for furlough, and one of those dangerous
Irish girls from Cork married him. The
party called in to see “Kissing Time” after
the coffee, and gave Gladys Sloncrieff and
Maudie Fane the hand-burst of the season.
One of the richest girls in Queensland, a
clever amateur actress and a regular demon
dancer, is expected to announce her engage-
ment at any moment to a noble member of
the staff that came to us on the Renown.
Much as all Sydney admires the State
Orchestra and the work of the electric Ver-
brngghen, there is a growing feeling that it
is a mistake to produce even a moa if that,
means the extinction of the smaller singing-
birds. The old-established societies are rais-
ing a flood of sweet song in protest, and fore-
most among them is the Sydney Choral
Society, whose conductor, Mr. Gooud, like
the good Australian he is, labofs in the
cause of music and draws no payment there-
from. Another asset to the society is Miss
Ferguson, who has played its accompani-
ments for the past seven years. On August
7 the society gives its next concert, when
Rosa Alba, Ella Caspers, tenor Lois and
Carl Formes will be the solo singers; but
the big feature of the evening will be the
unaccompanied choral numbers.
The Bishop of Armidale collected the wed-
ding-fee at St. James’s when Hilda Curnow,
of Sydney, married Reginald Reynolds, whose
grandad was Charles Reynolds, of Tocal,
Patterson. White crepe ninon embroidered
in pink roses formed a wedding dress that
carried a rainbow effect in bebe' ribbon and
a drapery of Brussels lace. The party was
at the Australia. Future address of the
Reginald Charles Maughan Reynoldses is
Glenesk, Grenfell.
Canon Bellingham had nearly all the say
in the wedding of Enid Phyllis Fraser, the
elder daughter of the E. .T. Doyles, of Lyn-
wood station (Q.), and Warren Bowman
Hogarth, M.C., of Ivanhoe Downs (Q.).
Warren is the youngest son of the late
William Hogarth, of Momba. The bride
carried all the accessories, of white satin
and silver trimmings, veil and orange blos-
som ; and sister Doreen, the only bridesmaid,
was in shell-pink georgette and a black
panne hat. Bridegroom’s old friend in the
A.F.A., Capt. T. J. Colquhoun, saw Warren
through. Mr. and Mrs. Doyle entertained
later at the Wentworth.
Wattle and blue streamers formed the
table decorations at the Wentworth the
other night when the Medical Society said
its farewell to Professor Wilson. All the
brass plates of Macquarie-street were there,
and at the end of the evening the Professor
carried off under his arm an illuminated
address.
Dame Margaret, Mrs. Storey, Mrs. Mac-
kinnon and Gladys Owen addressed all the
hair and Unfair they could gather in the
Commonwealth Bank Luncheon Hall one
day last week in the interests of the Peace
L °an. Dame Margaret, just back from a
holiday at Kosciusko, begged all the women
of Sydney to sink their surplus cash in the
loan; and Gladys Owen held a special brief
for the soldiers, whom this loan is to benefit.
An executive includes Mirs. 1C Dwyer and
Mary Gilmore, a speaker’s team has been
formed, and the presswomen of Sydney are
to help with a paper to be devoted to the
great four weeks’ push.
The Hugh Dixsons have been at their
good works again, and this afternoon Mrs
Hugh will formally open a fresh-air pavilion
in the isolation block of the Women’s Hos-
pital, Crown-street. The pavilion will make
it possible for another hundred or more
mothers to be admitted during the year Mr
and Mrs. Hugh footed the bills.
The overflowing sanatorium for consump-
tives at Waterfall sends out a cry for play-
ing cards, games and reading matter to help
pass the time these long, cold evenings. The
patients have a new recreation hall, but it
is sadly lacking in equipment. Address your
gifts “The Patients’ Recreation Committee,
Waterfall Sanatorium.”
Cobbers of the Fifth Divvy Artillery are
going to meet one another at a reunion at
Sargents’ (George-street) on Saturday night.
Off to South America or South Africa
this Letter’s geography is vague—a blue-eyed
little lady whose divorce fireworks proved a
sort of sanitary incinerator for a lot of
Sydney society. Hubby follows (the divorce
was not granted), and the chat goes that
he intends to nail up his brass-plate in
Durban or Callao or some such. Then the
unsoiled dove of young affection will once
more roost with the two in the shade of the
same roof-tree.
From Brisbane all dressed up :
For the Prince’s visit the Water and Sewerage
Board office is festooned with electric lights. Some
genius had the trees outside lopped so that the
colored lights would show. And these trees were
the one beauty of a dull street.
Ever since there has been a military hospital at
Enoggera the ambulance has had to rattle sick men
and men with half-healed wounds over a vile,
bumpy road. Now a super-road has been made, so
that the Prince may visit the place in comfort.
But orders were issued that the ambulance waggons
were not to use it! Imagine how pleased the
Digger Prince will be when he hears!
The Yacht Club Ball was tiie prettiest function
we've ever had in Brisbane. Lieut. Lewis managed
the decorations, and the big wool store resembled
a Tropic garden. Every pillar was ■ disguised as a
palm-tree trunk, and leaves waved overhead. Blue
and white hangings screened off the supper-room
and the card-room, and a very line orchestra was
concealed amid sweet-peas in a palm grove. Poin-
settias were on all the electric lights. Doreen Mor-
gan toiled for 10 hours beautifying the place before
the dance commenced.
The Shakspeare Ball will be very useful to the
Bursary Fund. Over £lOOO is in hand to help
along the education of soldiers’ and sailors’ kiddies.
The Brisbane Grammar School Jubilee Ball
attracted more than 300' pairs of feet. The Lieut.-
Gov. and Mrs. Lennon sat on the stage, which was
arranged as a drawing-room, and headmaster Bous-
field sat with them. Pretty little Mrs. Bousfield
was too much in request as a partner to sit long-
anywhere.
Died suddenly last week, Mrs. Alan Leeds, of
Mooroo station. She was a daughter of the J. C.
Hendersons, of Toowong. Husband Alan is a
returned soldier.
Professor David has promised to Godspeed
the King’s Hall gathering that Lily Butler
will escort to and through Old London on the
29th of this month, and that’s this evening.
The Y.W.C.A. is again on the warpath,
money for its hostel being the objective.
Military Commandant Bruche’s wife is one
of the O.C.’s of the new campaign, and Miss
Mary Fairfax and the Sydney Herring lady
are also standard-bearers. The daily mid-
day mess for the different companies of
looters are to be hostessed by Mrs. Claude
Reading, Mrs. Nott, Mrs. Sivier, Mrs. Rabett
and Mrs. Child.
Three warring stars met in peace during
the opera season in New York, when the de
Richlieu duchesse (she was an American
miss before she married de Richlieu when he
came across to Washington to handle some
of the affairs of la belle France) tendered
the cutlet of farewell to McCormack’s little
wife. They were Geraldine Farrar, Galli-
Curci and Mary Garden. Sounds rather
like sitting among the heavenly choir,
doesn’t it? The McCormack lady, by the
way, has a natural gift for home and per-
sonal decoration, so that only the bigness of
her heart and the softness of her tongue keep
her from being the best-hated woman under
that expensive New York roof-tree, the
Avignon.

What will you Demand of
your Player-Piano ?
Practically any player-instrument can give technique.
But the real musician wants infinitely more than the
mere ability to correctly strike notes. It is an essential,
of course, but without tone-control, how soulless, un-
satisfying and futile.
The Beale Play er-Piano combines dll the attributes of
perfect music. First, a piano of unusually charming
tone—rich, full, vibrant. It has the singing qualities
so essential for accompanying, and constructional
superiorities that ensure a life-time of service.
But the feature of infinite worth is its remarkable
latitude of tone-control. On the Beale you play ex-
actly as you wish to play—with every subtlest touch
of expression that distinguishes real music from its
unsympathetic counterpart. You follow no fixed line
of interpretation. Fancy-free, you walk in paths of
your own choice.
When you decide to own a really good piano, investi-
gate the Beale. Descriptive literature posted on request

The "Longreach.”
Right from the jump the “Longreach” is
comfortable, and needs no long breaking-in
period to make riding a pleasure. In this
saddle the flap is seamed direct on to the
seat, doing away with the usual skirt and
giving a narrow, non-chafing grip. The pads
are a deviation from the usual shape, and are
set high up almost level with the head of
saddle and along the rider’s thighs, giving
perfect security. The leather used is nice,
flexible kip, and the fittings are folded girth,
bevelled leathers and solid nickel stirrups.

taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submittedj and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany .
W.H.R. : .Didn’t say that Casino and
Tenterfield are connected by rail. But if an air-
post can be carried between those towns it can and
will be carried between others; so bang goes one
of the sources of the .revenue of the permanent and
reproductive railways !.... Wayback : The reference
was to one generally-favored district. Glad to have
your name and address Oliver B.: Nice little
tribute:—
. ...W.T.W.: That subject was discussed a few
months ago. Finis: Much too verbose. You don’t
talk that way round the camp-fire. Or if you do
you talk to the ashes... .Lion Tamer: There’s a
sketch there; but not in that form. Get to it
seriously Mollie B.: Too thin.... .1.R.M.: You
spoil “Every Dog His Day” by trying to rhyme
“ports” with “argonauts”.... Lacety’s Friend (or
something like that) : An occasional stop in the
right place might help it a bit; but nothing could
help it into print.... Joyce M.: Shocking.... Mr.
George G.: You seem to be about eight. Try again
when you’re 20.... Lettie B.: Consider your first
stanza:—
Long, long ago, in days of summer gladness,
We wandered by the seashore—you and I.
Our light hearts held no fear of care or sadness
As the brief golden hours flew swiftly bye.
Ah, God—but after sunshine comes the rain;
After joy, sorrow; after pleasure, pain.
That is quite accurate verse; but take it phrase by
phrase and try to guess which statement has been
most often made in those exact words. The only
note of originality is the “bye.” C.R.: “As One
Awakes” hasn’t enough in it M.S.W.K.: “Round
Up” doesn’t work out well H.S.E.: “Insomnia”
has stuff in it; see if you can strengthen the weak
places in the verse Herbert G.: “Ebony Belle”
goes heavily.... Mac C.: “Old Dog” is a dachshund.
Condense him M.J.C.: No use at all Jessie U.:
Not for us A.E.D.: Won’t do Frank C.: You
had to eat pudding when you didn’t want to. Re-
sult: Seven foolscap pages of typescript, when a
pill might have given you equ*} relief G. 8.:
“Paddy” doesn’t persuade us to let him in....M.C.:
“Black Box” fails. .. .Seedy: That yarn of a pair
of aristocrats who proved to be the butcher and
housemaid has been done too often; and the verse
is p00r.... Chris T.: If you ask us that way, we
can only reply that we don’t think anything of it.
. ...C.M.A.: Too thin. ... Galtic M.: Doesn’t hit
us hard....A. Merewoman: Another writer got the
same idea and got it more forcefully.... Charles
R. L.: The statements may be all right; the verse
isn’t Traveller: Not particularly cheerful or
pathetic or brilliant or poetical. In fact, it’s no
darned good Eileen O.: Read what we print.
We want stuff like that, and as much better as you
can send. .. .T.S.McN.: Verse so rugged we tore our
coat on it.... Inkpot: All those questions make us
angry. Why must the worst verse always start
with “Do you know”?... .Corkscrew: Doesn’t quite
do it.... Jack E.: N 0... .L.M.C.: “Appreciation of
the beauty of a reservoir” doesn’t get to anything.
.... Beaurevoir: Commonplace vtrse that says very
little... .J. 5.8.: Not up to the mark....J.H. (Mur-
rumbeena) : Lovely thing. Two stanzas: —
To a nice country church we went,
And married we did get;
Ah, how all my money was spent,
Of that you need not fret.
Time has passed, our children behave,
The boys they go to school;
The girls all nice young men enslave,
And we two play the fool.
. ...W.E.K.: “Belinda” and “The River” are both
out in the c01d... .L.W.S.S.: Not enough marrow
in the bones... .W.J.L.: Nothing to cheer about in
those... .W.J. (Petersham): Clumsy... .R.E.D.:
Don’t care for “Abdul.”... .W.J.S.: They make very
sleepy reading... .Angus: Why mix up “thy” and
“you” like that to embroider mere commonplace?
.... Snowy: Can’t make head or tail of “The Super-
Deadhouse.”... .W.E.K.: “Jim” and you don’t work
out in verse of ravishing delght... . G.: A sonnet
must hold more than that; and carrying the sense
from the octave to the sestet is a serious fault....
Chick S.: With something to write about you would
probably do very we11....T.8. (Newtown): The
man got three “cakes” of manure per day.
(Laughter) ... .Gee Bung: Doesn’t g 0... .Paul M.:
We always suspect “heather.” The vegetable doesn’t
bloom here to any extent, and it makes a far too
convenient rhyme for “weather,” which is always
plentiful... .M.J.R.: The subject has been better
handled; and the jingle contains some very shaky
rhymes.... Frida P.: It’s not so bad if you’re as
young as you seem; but you’ll have to grow up....
D. U. Nin: Yes; but see how it works out when
you remit the money to the Belgian merchant. He’s
the man who scores.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Miggs: Mrs. Murphy’s white neck looks as if she
washed it every morning. The visitor has two
wooden hands. .. .Flat Bush Artist: Your book is
now in the office tomb. . . .T.C.: You didn’t gum its
return fare on its back. This office isn’t a fountain
of stamps H.A.8.: A good comic dog. Patent it
and take it to America, where there. is a sale for
freak animals J.K.W.: Some promise about the
cartoon. The other is too heavy.... J. 8.: Is the
tall man singing to the crouching comedian?
R.T.: Feeble railway jest... . Arthur H.: The lady
bulges in all the wrong places... .H.A.B.': At pre-
sent you’re a hack-saw artist. .. .R.P.: You can’t
draw well enough, and your gag has moss on it
Maisie Y.: Two feminine heads on long, swan-like
necks. Afraid we’ll have to struggle along without
them.... A.W.A.: The German gorilla has quite a
benevolent expression... .E.G.S.: Not this time.
Study and try again... .C.J.R.: Fair amateur work
only. You must do a lot better... .N.N.: Do
teachers still make those dangerous remarks to the
young?. . . .E.S.: Originality isn’t the only quality
necessary... .H.McI.: “Am sending a sketch which I
did last night instead of my French homework. I
shall be glad of your advice.” Do the homework
next time. .. .Football Sketcher: That was an original
idea of yours to lay the whole crowd of spectators
flat on the ground... .Jas. C.: Crude, but plug on.
Oh, blessed is the name of Violet Day,
In dearest memory of our brave.
It’s hard for one to write or say,
For their fresh, young lives they gave.
Oh, may its memory never fade,
For those so peacefully sleeping.
On the plains of France our heroes laid,
Our love for those we’re sighing and keeping.

ison Amberol Records
m'rrnzzmi
for July.
The July list of Edison Amberol Records is a veritable
storehouse of good items, whether your fancy inclines to
lively airs or classical melodies.
The Royal Purple Records are represented by three fine
numbers —“Come Where My Love Lies Dreaming,” sung
by Anna Case; “Little Alabama Coon,” by Frieda
Hempel; “Tim Rooney’s at the Fightin’ ” —songs that
are delightful in their rendering.
The regular list contains some good instrumental numbers
and vocal items. It is hard to discriminate amongst so
many good things, but you should certainly hear Arthur
Fields sing “Bring Back Those Wonderful Days,” and
Leola Lucey render “You’re Breaking My Heart with
Good-Bye.”

T he distinction of Comrnunity Plate, that makes it stand out
m comparison as the highest grade silver-plated cutlery, lies in
its unequalled standards of value, and its popularity among
cultured and discriminating women. After the classical deco-
rative creations of the old masters of art, the designs are Adam
Sheraton, Hepplewhite and Patrician, which give a romantic-
ally historic air to the surroundings.
One need entertain no fear, either, when buying a pattern in
Community Plate of seeing the same design made up in a
lighter and inferior article. There is positively no duplication
of designs in Community Plate.
Furthermore, the points of greatest wear are protected by an
additional overlay of pure silver at the base of the bowl of
every spoon and fork, ensuring lifelong service, for Com-
munity Plate is guaranteed for fifty years. Complete services
range from £5 to £5O. On sale at the leading shops.

Rexona and Rexona Soap
Needed in
Every
Home.
Little Dimples Hage, the five-year-old daughter of a famous Queensland teacher
of violin and piano, was born with the gift of absolute pitch. If any note is sung
or struck she can instantly name it correctly. Both the clever little girl and her
mother are Rexona devotees. Read the following letter, which was written to
us by Mrs. Hage in praise of the Rexona remedies: —
m
- $•
Dear Sirs, —
I think every mother
should have a pot of
Rexona on hand, for it
is simply wonderful
how often one has to
fly to it, for one cause
or another. I have
been using Rexona my-
self, also for my little
girl Dimples, and it
would honestly be a
hardship now to try to
get along without it.
Whenever my little
girl hurts herself in
any way she always
runs to me for some
Rexona, and I can
truthfully say it never
disappoints us, for it
always heals, and so
quickly cures.
Knowing how good
Rexona was, I bought
some Rexcna Soap re-
cently to try it also,
and I find it delightful.
I shall always stick by
Rexona, for it is an
article of true merit,
and my little girl says
she is a Rexona girl,
and always will be.
Sincerely j ours,
(Sgd.)
(Mrs.) Mary E. D. Hage.

Lies dead beneath the rising moon.
lime, the great Changeling, plays his part
With face inconstant and untrue;
But, ever eloquent, my heart
Re-tells its tale of love for you.
Could I from out the hive above
Choose the most amorous world on fire
To bear to you essential Love,
The flame of it might cool desire.
Lost mate with the brown, haunting eyes,
The cloudy hair, the brow of snow,
The curved red lips that might surprise
A hunter from his bended bow,
I see you where your island breaks
The marge above the misty calm.
And Morn, a chorister, awakes
Wild wood and ocean with his psalm.
Be near the window of my rest,
Lean over me as with a kiss
On a bright moonbeam of the West,
O Brassolis ! Sweet Brassolis !
Then we beside a stream shall lie,
Where mirrored in it, face to face,
The earth and immemorial sky,
Shall wonder at our fond embrace.
Ours, ours shall be the purple hills,
All ours the river melodies.
The meads of dancing daffodils,
The croon of cool, conceiving trees.
To hear old Earth approve his wife,
By every pulse within the sod.
So busy recreating Life,
The eager and insurgent god !
In every note of mated bird
There is your louder, loving cry;
In every roar from the red herd
The stag is sounding my reply.
The lonely plover in her nest
Among the moss-hags late in Spring
Broods like the heart within my breast.
And like her young my thoughts take wing.
Through memoried places where we joyed.
On wolds that rose to wondrous skies,
Thev follow you as in a void
With longing and -with shining eyes.
The days upon their faces fall.
Like slain in battle prone they lie:
The victor mountains, cowl’d and tall.
Keep guard within the misty sky.
Love’s duneeon-fare the Dead may praise:
My lips in season for your kiss
Crv shame upon the barren years,

Musical Boots.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SIMON CHEFSCAKEIt brought me a
pair of boots on my birthday—a pair
of boots with uppers as soft as a
glove and soles as pliable as a young wet
flounder. The things did not appear to have
any particular shape; but I accepted the
gift for the good intention behind it, and
only felt a little sorry that Simon wasn’t a
better workman.
“It’s a fine piece of stuff,” he said. “None
of the ordinary leather this; I bought it
from a Greek fisherman.”
“Porpoise hide,” I suggested.
“No. Not a fish, nor a goat, nor a horse.
The thing looked like a man’s skin, only that
I could see the hair had been dressed off
it —monkey-skin, I think.”
“But there are no monkeys in Greece.”
“I do’ know,” he said. “Might have been
one with a barrel-organ sometime.”
I tried the boots on that night after din-
ner, and they had a curious mellow feeling
-—a feeling as if my feet had now fully
ripened and were fit for walking on air.
All the time I had them on I wanted to
whistle—a thing I had not done for at least
20 years.
Mason, a fellow-boarder, looked into my
room. Mason blows a horn of some sort in
an orchestra, one of those confused and
convoluted things in brass that bleat like
a ram occasionally and give a shuddering
melancholy to the accompanying thump on
the drum.
“What’s that air you’re whistling, Cor-
dingley ?”
“Hanged if I know. Was I whistling?”
“Were you whistling? Haven’t you been
going through a whole repertory. Three airs
I never heard before, and all of them
strangely fascinating.”
“Was it anything like this?” I whistled.
“No, but, by Jove, that’s worth while.
Do that again till I catch it and write it
down.”
I did it nine times; and Mason wrote it
down, note by note. Later on, Gasper—
Phillips Gasper of the Tivoli —made some
words for it. and it 'was printed as “The
Gum-tree Serenade.”
After that Mason was always asking me
to w-histle, but he got no more new airs;
and as I hadn’t the least idea how I came
to invent, the one he did get, “The Gum-tree
Serenade” stood alone as the one popular
masterpiece achieved by the man who blew
the horn.
I didn’t wear the boots Cheescaker had
brought me. They were too unsightly for
the st reet; and they stood on the bottom
rung of the wardrobe and were almost for-
gotten.
But I put them on one night when it was
raining because the hole in my other pair
let in the -wet, and I wanted to post a letter.
Once outside I did not mind the' rain—did
not feel it, in fact. They really were very
comfortable boots; and as I turned down
the street where the flame-trees grow I began
to whistle for sheer lightheartedness. It
was good to be alive, good to know that
my income-tax was paid, good to feel that
there were so many homes of happy people
about me. I had gone about three-quarters
of a mile in the same mood when I felt a
soft muzzle thrust into my hand, and looked
over mv shoulder. There was a happy dog
about six sizes too big for the street, and
behind him trotted a varied assortment of
five or six dozen others. I paused in the
light of the street-lamp and surveyed them.
Yes, there were nine bulldogs among them,
enough greyhounds to make a line right
across the roadway, a cloud of restless and
earnest terriers, a phalanx of spaniels mov-
ing as one tail, and a row of pomeranians
worth about as much as a fair-sized sheep-
station. Besides these, there were scattered
dogs of all breeds, and beyond the dogs skir-
mished daintily a moving host of cats over-
topped by a placid but eager-looking drove
of cattle.
At any other time the sight would have
filled me'with dismay, not to say terror, but
to-night the creatures seemed all friends of
mine, very good fellows out for a suburban
ramble in the rain.
Down in the hollow there was a great
tent pitched on a vacant piece of land, and
near it a number of smaller tents. I sup-
posed it was a circus of some sort that had
just arrived. Gaily I approached it. still
whistling merrily ; and as I did so there was
a strange commotion among the tents. It
seemed as if somebody was trying to pull
up the stump of a tree with a corkscrew
worked by a circular-saw, to an accompani-
ment of clanking chains and falling tea-
trays loaded with Japanese inkstands. Then
the menagerie arrived.
It had got away from the criminals who
had charge of it—all menagerie-keeper.s are
instinctively criminal, though less monoto-
nously degraded than the felons who make
and keep zoos. The lion walked first, with
the lioness and two cubs close up, the tiger
—an old chap with faded stripes and arti-
ficial teeth- —loped wide of the general smell,
a performing kangaroo and an uncelebrated
butting ram kept some distance in the rear,
and the tail of the procession was, a moult-
ing elephant with his trunk raised in a listen-
ing attitude.
And still I was moved by no sense of
terror. For the hour I seemed lord of all
creation; it was perfectly natural that 1
should have such a bodyguard. I lifted my
face to the rain-clouds and felt the large,
chill drops fall upon my whistling lips; but
even in the ecstasy of my mood I was not
prepared for what followed.
At the corner of Whisk-street and Popham-
crescent there is a small nursery garden.
People in the suburbs go there to buy cab-
bage-plants for the small green fly to eat, and
roses to plant where they may clamber over
the verandah. As I approached this place
even I was aware that my whistling had
taken on a supernatural sweetness, to which
the music of a running brook was as a dis-
cordant shouting of railway engines in a
fog. My music was like the thought
melody which accompanies the last payment
of a mortgage or the first stitches of a
bridal robe, like the fancy of a boy in a high
tree, or the delight of a plain girl wearing
a handsome lover’s violets. The little trees
standing in the nursery beds heard it.
They leaped from their places, scattering the
soil with their roots, and dashed after the
lion and the withered elephant and the large
dog and the skirmishing cats and the thought-
ful cows; the carnations came along and the
newly-budded roses and the chrysanthemums
and the asters, and even the buffalo-grass.
The grass, in fact, was quite a feature of
the procession, for it walked like a sacred
carpet propelled by caterpillar traction.
But even the most delightful evening must
end; and although I had difficulty in per-
suading the lion that I did not want him
upstairs, I managed to shut the door and
climbed up to my room on the second floor.
“Nice boots in spite of their shape,” I
said, and threw Cheescaker's gift gently
under the bed.
Far off I heard the tiger talking to a
policeman ; and I went to sleep happily, re-
membering that the faded beast had only
artificial teeth with which to masticate the
population.
Then I saw my boots —the boots Chees-
caker had made for me—walking in an early-
morning mist through a Grecian wood. At
first they were plain boots, then they gradu-
ally took a form which I mistook for that
of an aged man bowed under a weight of
gapped and corrugated whiskers. As the
sun gained strength and I saw more clearly,
the outline became that of a monkey—a
monkey with a short and tufted tail; but I
had still diagnosed the apparition falsely. He
came nearer; I saw that his foot was a hoof.
“Pan,” I cried, “the great god Pan !”
“Wrong,” he shouted. “Guess again.”
I pondered and was silent. At last I
gave a yell of delight.
“The scapegoat,” I cried. “The scapegoat
by Holman Hunt. When did you come back
from the wilderness?”
“You're a perfect ass,” he said quite
frankly, but with a smile that completely
disarmed me. “I’m Marsyas the Satyr; not
to know that argues yourself unknown.”
“Oh !” I said.
“Apollo skinned me,” he said. “He was
as slick about the job as if I had been a
mere rabbit.”
“Why did he do it?” I asked with as much
show of interest as was possible.
“Haven’t you ever read anything?”
“I haven’t read about you.”
“Ah, well,” he said, “you haven’t missed
much. That yarn in the classical dictionary
gives an utterly false impression of my char-
acter. The fact is that instead of being
beaten in the musical contest I had him on
the ropes all the time. He couldn't get any-
thing out of his lyre to compare with the
tunes I whistled, and the Muses gave me
the award at the fourth round. Then my
generosity spoiled everything. I had always
looked up to Apollo, and it seemed my
religious duty to enter a protest. I said I
knew in my own heart that his godship had
placed the better music, but that Wagnerian
stuff of his was a bit beyond the Nine
Ladies. It was a foolish thing to do, for

We all seek life’s comforts and pleasures, but many of
us pay too high a price for them. Continued over-
working, late hours and loss of sleep gradually roll up an
account that brings sickness and enforced rest. Weak
kidneys is the common penalty. Daily backache, dizzy
spells, headaches, rheumatic pains and kidney irregu-
larities are warnings of kidney weakness. Don’t wait!
Neglect may lead to gravel, dropsy or fatal kidney
disease. For quick relief help the weakened kidneys with
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS. Doan’s have
brought new health and happiness to thousands of
sufferers. Many of them live here in Sydney. Ask
your neighbor.
SYDNEY PEOPLE TELL OF THEIR CURES
BY DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.
FROM ROZELLE.
Mr. M. Dowling, 25 Roseberry Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says: “For about
three years I suffered a good deal with my kidneys, and during that time was
treated by doctors and tried different remedies, but nothing did me any good. My
back used to ache fearfully, and it was as much as I could do to stand up straight
after bending over a little while. I had liniments rubbed in, but the relief was
only temporary, the pain being soon as bad as ever. The kidney secretions were
very much disordered, being highly colored and scanty. My general health was
far from good, and I often used to feel so ill I could hardly attend to my work.
One day I saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and the thought
occurred tOi me to try this remedy. I bought a bottle, and in a few days I began to
feel better. As I went on with the treatment the improvement was maintained,
and by the time I had used four bottles I was cured, all signs of backache and
kidney trouble having entirely gone. I am in splendid health now, and have only
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to thank for my recovery.”
FROM CAMPERDOWN.
Mrs. T. Smith, 25 Bridge Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says: “A member
of my family suffered agony from rheumatic pains all over the body, and was
completely crippled with the ailment for months. The pains were particularly
severe across the small of the back, just over the kidneys. We had a doctor
treating the case for a good while, but his medicine did not do any good, and
at last he said he was afraid nothing more could be done. We then tried hospital
treatment, but that also failed. It was right on top of this that we were advised
to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and although we had very little hope that
they would do any good, we got some to try them. After taking two or three
bottles there was a little improvement, so we persevered, until a perfect cure was
effected, using in all 12 bottles. We cannot say enough in praise of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and consider the cure a marvellous one.”
Four years later Mrs. Smith says: “The cure referred to still holds good. I
am sure if Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were better known there would be less
suffering in the world.”

nobody can ever afford to lower himself in
the estimate of his critics. If they guess
in his favor he ought to take it at that
and intimate that even they don’t know how
great his work really is. But the moment
I let my modesty out to bow Apollo was at
me like a shot. He bragged like all Olympus
in a cyclone, and the poor old dames were
so flustered that they didn’t know what to
say. As a matter of fact they didn’t say
anything, for Apollo had my pelt off just to
make sure. He hung up my skin in the
cave; and now you’ve got most of it under
your bed.”
“I’m sorry,” I said.
“Oh, don’t be soi’ry. I want you to wear
those boots and whistle as you did to-night.
The boots have all my old tunes in them,
and if you wear them the world will put
Apollo in his place before the next classical
dictionary is published.”
“All right,” I said. “Can I go to sleep
now?”
He made a Greek sound like a lawn-
mower and bowed himself out of the wood.
When I woke I sat up in bed and raised
a great snort of thanksgiving that my adven-
tures had only been the absurdity of a dream.
I looked at my boots—the boots made from
the skin of Marsyas. Of course I knew the
story; no doubt I had linked up in some sub-
conscious way the monkey-skin sold to Chees-
caker by a- Greek fisherman with a yarn that
I remembered from my school-days. But I
wasn’t so confident when I came downstaii*s.
I couldn’t see the lion or the faded tiger or
the threadbare elephant, but there, right in
the centre of the lawn, were two dozen new
roses all planted in a listening attitude!

The Spirit of Illusion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
knew how many niggers Le
Grand had killed, and he himself had
kept no record, but that is beside
the question. It does not matter. Digby
had supported him in all his nefarious deeds
with whole-hearted enthusiasm. Together
they had governed the Western Pacific Copra
Co.’s affairs with an iron hand and a curse-
hardened tongue. And now they knew that
the slightest suspicion of weakening would
spell disaster.
Yesterday Yogi and Togi had fled to the
hills, and it had been reported that they had
been seen journeying towards the Valley of
Crabs. To-day Le Grand and Digby were
hot on the tracks of the deserters. They had
slept all night in the pocket of a little cove
that nestled behind a fringe of cocoanut
palms on a shore about a dozen miles from
the plantation.
Digby had been wakened that morning by
the scratching of a hermit-crab which had
mistaken his ear for a hole in the ground.
“Damn!” he said, and thereby aroused Le
Grand. “This place is alive with them!
Crabs always get on my nerves.”
In answer Le Grand cursed the climate,
quinine, malaria, crabs and, beyond all, nig-
gers. For years niggers had helped to make,
mar and mould him. They were a necessary
evil which Fate had commissioned him to
bridle with multitudinous tasks, and the more
those tasks worried him the more he worried
the niggers. Now if one thing annoyed him
above another it was a runaway nigger. He
had hever contemplated two runaways. But
the uncontemplated had happened, and it
brought him to the verge of madness.
“Come on, Digs!” Le Grand spoke with
the irritation of the tropics in his voice.
“We’ll get this job over.” And he strode off
into the jungle.
Digby threw a few odds and ends and a
bottle of absinthe into a bag, and followed
close on the heels of his chief. For a long
time they tramped on in silence, and nothing
but the cracking of a twig and the scurrying
of an occasional- startled crab broke the
stillness of the tangle. The crabs became
more numerous, and though they were seldom
seen the rustling they made on both sides of
the track increased with the intruders’ pro-
gress, until the noise was like the constant
wash from a cutter’s bow. As time went on
the rustling seemed to become integrated with
the lesser sounds of falling seeds and nuts,
and lift, as it were, a united voice—the
voice of the forest itself. If it contained a
distinct note, it was that of a personality
fretful under intrusion, resentful of disturb-
ance. In short, it was that invisible Thing
which has had the power to make strong
men turn suddenly and expect to see the Un-
known laughing in derision at their very
elbows.
Digby remarked more than once: “Crabs!
—they get on my nerves !”
Le Grand plodded on. He was a man of
few words; and it was not until Digby had
made the remark for the sixth time that the
other answered. And the answer was mostly
contemptuous of crabs.
“Well, I don’t like ’em—they get on my
nerves,” reiterated Digby, his eyes furtively
probing the undergrowth.
Le Grand laughed. In the sunlit patches,
where the jungle-vine rolled back from the
tops of the tall trees, huge tropical butterflies
’planed luxuriously. From away down below
the voice of the surf came to them, toned
to a sigh by the distance, a scarcely audible
whisper from another world. But the open
spaces were few and far between, and for the
most part they toiled on in the shadowed
light beneath the great roof of the jungle
vine.
A sudden disturbance to the left halted
them.
“What’s that?” snapped Digby, with ner-
vous tension in his voice. >
Le Grand glanced at his companion. He
found a kind of malicious delight in observ-
ing Digby in such moments.
“A pig, perhaps,” he answered with a
smile. “Let’s see.”
They walked towards the spot whence the
noise came. A pig bolted into the distance,
and a slower rustling of leaves told of the
presence of many crabs.
“Oh, hell! Look!”
“Bones!” ejaculated Le Grand. “Surely?
—yes, it is—there’s that chain-bangle he
wore. That’s the end of Yogi. It’ll be a
lesson to the others, anyhow!”
“Poor devil!” answered Digby. “I won-
der how the deuce it happened.”
“A fight, I suppose. Took some gin with
’em, didn’t they? And that’s the sequel.
Togi has killed Yogi, and the crabs have
done the rest.”
Both spat on the ground and then pushed
on up the track.
“Crabs get on my nerves!”
“Oh tie ud voiir nerves or thev’ll set
on mine ! There’s one Tood niggei- gofe!
and if we don’t hurry we ll lose the otner.”
Im gomg to have a drink, was the
unresentful answer Digby made, as he
pulled the bottle of absinthe from the bag.
Few politenesses were wasted between
these two. Too long had they lived together
to worry about the superficialities of a long-
forgotten civilization. Both drank, and
then plodded on, without a word, up into
the fold of the hills.
Night fell, sudden as a blot of ink, as it
does in the tropics. They made a fire and
sat talking. Presently Digby rose and,
taking- a small tomahawk, made a quick run
and cleft a great king crab in two. The
severed halves wriggled about in the yellow
light of the fire. '
“What did you do that for?” snapped Le
Grand, testily.
“I don’t know. I couldn’t help it. I wish
we were out of this place. Don’t like it.
Crabs get on my nerves.”
“Oh, have another drink ! Crabs can’t
hurt you; at least, one or two can’t any-
how. We haven’t seen many.”
They drank together and soon fell asleep.
Digby was awakened by Le Grand,
“There’s one of those crabs. Came right
up to me. One of the big brutes they talk
about. I think I’ll keep awake.”

They sat in silence for awhile, and
seemed to fall into deep reverie.
It was Digby who spoke first, as though
™s in? , a continuation of his thoughts,
ihere s more than one white man come up
here and never returned. Jimmy Wright
was the last.”
“Yes, poor old Jimmy! I wonder what
happened to him ”
Digby got up and slashed at another crab,
and then sat down again. Le Grand looked
across at him. Digby was strangely agitated.
Le Grand threw a firestick at the next
intruder, and it sidled off into the dark-
ness. From time to time they looked be-
hind, as though they expected a crab to
steal up from the rear.
At intervals one or the other would take
a firestick and wander off into the under-
growth, whence would come the sounds of
much slaughter among the crabs. Then they
would drink together and in silence beside
the fire. Sometimes one would look up sud-
denly. at the other as though bent on read-
ing his thoughts.

seemed to be beyond speech—too all-absorb-

though he had just discovered the color,
“They’re brown!” contradicted Le Grand,
“Some are brown,” answered Digby in a
hopeless way.
“The color doesn’t matter.”
“No, the color doesn’t matter.”
“We’re surrounded.”
“Yes.”
' “There’s no way out.”
“No.”
“Yes, there’s a way,” affirmed Le Grand,
“Where?”
“Here!” Le Grand pulled a French auto-
matic from his pocket. "It’s the only way.”
“Oh, no! ’ Terror wrote itself on Digby’s
face. , , ..
Come on. Le Grand already had the
automatic pressed above his heart.
“Wait,” implored Digby, hastily drawing
a b >S forty-five from his pocket.
