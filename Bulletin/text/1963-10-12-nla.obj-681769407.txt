National Notebook
Looking for Lola
HThe other morning, we dropped round
-*■ to a Sydney motel to have a word
with Miriam Brickman, casting director
for Jack Lee on his forthcoming Aus-
tralian film, “The Delinquents,” to be
shot here in November and December.
Small, cool but intense in the London
manner, Miss Brickman was casting di-
rector on Britain’s films of the industrial
North, “A Kind of Loving,” “Billy Liar”
and “This Sporting Life”. Work on these
productions followed a career in various
capacities at the Royal Court Theatre,
where she knew Lindsay Anderson, a
former film-critic and “This Sporting
Life’s” director.
“Lindsay is very exacting,” she said.
“And he’s very serious. He has clearly
defined attitudes about every picture.
Almost classical. Everything has to be
framed for him. He rehearses the actors
very closely. ‘This Sporting Life’ was
shot in sequence, with every scene
rehearsed.” (This is un-
usual in the cinema—an-
other rare example was
“Twelve Angry Men”.)
“Technicians hate him.
Actors admire him im-
mensely. I respect him
very much he’s an ex-
traordinary person but he isn’t easy
to work with.
“John (Schlesinger) is so different.
He’s enormously generous. He doesn’t
shoot a film consecutively from begin-
ning to end he is more spontaneous.”
One got the impression (rightly or
wrongly) that she had found Schlesinger
a good deal less tense to work with.
And how was she finding it, working in
Australia, on the casting of “The Delin-
quents,” with Jack Lee?
“Well, it’s been a great surprise to me
here. I thought this would be a very
square country. With very little in the
way of acting talent. But I was wrong.
There’s an enormous amount of talent
here.
“Karel Reisz came back to London
from Sydney after making plans for a
film of ‘Ned Kelly’, very not dis-
appointed but negative in his response
to actors here. I think he must have gone
about things the wrong way, and I’m
going to tell him so.
“I’ve found some wonderful people
here. Full of enthusiasm and energy. The
actors we’ll use are much better for the
film than English actors would be. Cast-
ing? Well, I think there’s a good chance
we may cast Reg Livermore as the male
lead he’s a brilliant actor.
“He’s in ‘Oh Dad, Poor Dad’, at the
Sydney Independent. It’s a much more
stylish production than the London one.
And I’ve found marvellous, ideal people
for other parts Leonard Teale, Margo
Lee, David Yorston, Brigid Lenehan, we
may well use any of these people, though
nothing’s definite yet. But we haven’t
settled on the girl for Lola, the female
lead.
“One thing is certain the people in
the novel must be played by Australians.
And the stars we hope will be
Australian stars.”
Expatriate author
T ate this year Macmillan are bringing
out a collection of short stories
by an expatriate, Shirley Hazzard, whose
work would be unknown here except
to readers of “The New Yorker.” Miss
Hazzard writes regularly for “The New
Yorker,” which isn’t to say she writes
“New Yorker” stories. If there are non-
books there may be non-stories, and
Miss Hazzard’s, elegant, almost plotless
with a soft centre of neuro-
ticism, run close to this.
It will be interesting to see
how they are accepted
here.
Miss Hazzard worked
for a time with UN, but
resigned to write. Inevi-
tably, she is working on a novel and
inevitably she would have preferred to
be a poet.
Public Relations
A n endless daisy-chain of cars festoons
North Sydney streets during business
hours. At the end of the day their owners
take charge of their vehicles and snarl,
snarl, snarl all the way home.
Recently they have had something a
little more specific to snarl about. Hun-
dreds of homes have been flattened to
make way for the new expressway. The
land on which the homes stood is
clean, level and unencumbered—ideal for
car parking, and many a harassed motor-
ist has been using the barren acres for
just that.
A few weeks back a team of Depart-
ment of Main Roads employees rolled
up with timber and bolts and fenced in
most of the level areas, and there are
dozens of them. Why? “Parking there
would only have been temporary, any-
way,” said the department’s public
relations office. “Preliminary work on
the highway may start within two
months.”
It’s nice to have the assurance that
work on the expressway will start so soon,
but wouldn’t it have been good public
relations to invite parking until work
commenced? And if a start is so close,
why the expense of fencing?

Six Practical Items
4 friend of ours had his curiosity
aroused by a Sunday newspaper
advertisement for a free catalogue of
good things to be bought, mail order,
from Hong Kong. When the catalogue
came he found a wonderland that Alice
would have appreciated. One sheet
offered Six Practical Items Plus Candy
Christmas Gift Box, only Stg.lss. or
Aus. £1 , a depreciation of Is. 3d. on
our supposed rate of exchange. Glancing
down he found that the six items were
designed “to make your children’s mind
forward to science by sending them a
scientific article box on Christmas or
birthday as a gift! _
And what articles there w'ere in the
box! A “constellation camera-taking
with 16 pictures, observer senior binocu-
lar, telescope, pocket binocular, slide
viewer including Hong Kong sight-seeing
rainbow color picture”, and the real piece
de resistance, “a scientific ten-in-one
scope it may use as reading lens, adjust-
able telescope, directional compass, flat
mirror, camp fire lighter, compound
microscope, focusing binoculars, solar
time clock, magnifying mirror, and code
transmitter”.
Expecting a wide choice of children’s
special interstellar-spy rocket ships on
the other catalogue sheets, he was most
disappointed to find only illustrations of
car coats and raincoats, self-measuring
and order forms, an information page
that promised “best workmanship you
won t forget! and finally a page of rain-
bow color cloth samples with the slightly
forbidding statement that “many
coats look alike but to the experienced
eye they will appear as various as
human’s fingerprints.”
In a state of mild shock, our friend
inserted a new ribbon in his typewriter,
put his inky fingerprints on an Aus. £1
note, and sent off to Hong Kong for the
six practical items plus candy Christmas
gift box. So at least one Australian
child will be having a bonzer Xmas,
Hong Kong style, chewing candy, study-
ing the ways of the world through bino-
culars, telescope and microscope, and
checking his solar time clock.
The Lunch Hour
Sydney’s three-shilling theatre at the
Palace has been a great success so
far, and the optimists feel that once the
Opera House is finished there might be
threepenny opera as well. Four weeks of
Albec’s “The American Dream” will be
followed by John Mortimer’s “The Lunch
Hour.”
Although the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust was aiming for the young white-
collar workers, there has been a large
proportion of older people, particularly
women, in the audiences. As the lights go
down there is an almost audible sigh as
shoppers kick off their shoes. After all,
young people have their own resources
but there are few places in these days of
plate-sized seats in espresso bars where
vou can relax in comfort And new T sreels
aren’t what they used to be Recently all

PLAIN ENGLISH
Men of Principle
ANE can look at the follies of
the Labor Party from two
angles. The first and less signi-
ficant concerns the effect of its
unending splits on its chances of
ever winning an election. Here it
shows a genius for playing into the
hands of its political enemies. Hav-
ing made a mess of its policy on
the Exmouth base (supporting the
base but on conditions that would
make it unworkable), it then pro-
ceeded to make a mess of its
Malaysia policy (supporting the
stationing of Australian troops
there, but again on conditions that
make it impossible in this case,
under a treaty which Malaysia will
not have). Now it has made a mess
of its State Aid policy.
First Mr Calwell and Mr Whit-
lam assured the NSW Labor Gov-
ernment that although its earlier
policy of subsidising the building of
science laboratories in independent
schools was against ALP policy,
the granting of allowances of £2l
per year to parents of private
school children would be in order.
But no sooner had the NSW Gov-
ernment announced this plan
which in itself involves a meagre
outlay compared with wiiat is done
in Victoria, Queensland or Labor-
governed Tasmania, than the
Federal Executive of the ALP
announced that it would not allow
it.
The result is that the apparent
leader of the Party, Mr A. Calwell,
is treated with contempt, the NSW
Government is reduced to being
subject to orders from people out-
side NSW, and Catholics every-
where are told by the ALP that they
are second-class citizens. So, once
again, bang goes any hope Labor
ever had of winning the next
Federal election!
But the second angle .is more
illuminating. The real issue is one
of principle, and Mr F. E. Cham-
berlain and his Leftists are nothing
if not men of principle. They do
not want to win an election, unless
they win it on a Leftist platform,
and they are prepared to stay out
of power indefinitely until condi-
tions favor them. They have been
willing to destroy Labor Govern-
ments in Western Australia,
Queensland and Victoria for the
sake of their principle, and since
the very existence of the NSW
Labor Government is the strongest
card of Labor anti-Leftists, they
would be willing to destroy this
Government too.
In this respect the significant
point is that although they are
determined to crack down on com-
paratively harmless, Right-wing,
alleged breaches of Party policy—
over State Aid—they remain silent
over blatant Left-wing breaches,
such as the announcement in a
Labor paper in Queensland that
Labor must follow Communist
policy and oppose stationing Aus-
tralian troops in Malaya in
every way and in any circum-
stances. It is obvious that these
people simply prefer Communists
to Catholics, and would rather see
Australia as a People’s Republic
than as a democracy.
Fortunately, although they are
men of principle, their principles
are obnoxious to the Australian
voters and their days are numbered.
But their final defeat will not come
until Labor Right-wingers awake
from their frightened sleep and
drive them out. The ball has long
been at their feet; the Leftist leaders
represent no one as is shown in
Victoria where the “leadership” is
Leftist but no one belongs to the
Labor Party; but they will not kick.
Our Own
A-Bomb?
T'HE suggestion that Australia
A should have its own nuclear
deterrent is gaining ground in some
quarters in Australia and it
deserves the serious public con-
sideration which so far it has not
had. Our own nuclear weapon
sounds like a simple answer to the
threats of military confrontation to
our north, giving Australia in one
bound all the military force and
power which it does not possess,
while issuing a clear warning that
if its national interests are attacked
it has the means of immediate and
devastating retaliation. But those
who advocate nuclear weapons for
Australian uses overlook certain
things. In the unlikely event that
either the US or Britain would agree
to enlarge the nuclear club by fur-
nishing this country with its own
nuclear deterrent (in what passes
for peacetime) it is absolutely cer-
tain that Indonesia would urgently
seek the same weapon from Russia
or Red China with every chance
that its demands would be met by
either one or the other country.
Thus instead of finding ourselves
with a monopoly deterrent in
South-East Asia we might find that,
quite apart from alienating Asian
opinion, we were poised on the
brink of a nuclear war with our
nearest neighbor which could easily
become global.
Aliens and
Silence
HTHE current fuss over Mr Harold
Orr in Melbourne has caused
the usual spate of criticism of the
Immigration Department for not
divulging its reasons for refusing un-
wanted aliens permission to stay in
this country. However, one of the
reasons why some of those ex-
cluded from this country are so
vehement in demanding to know
why they have been excluded is
because they want to know how
much is known about them, about
their activities and their associates.
How can any Government afford
to tell them? For that matter how
can any Government morally
certain on the evidence that an
alien is a security risk, but unable
conclusively to prove the fact, af-
ford to tell the person concerned?
In yet other cases to inform a person
of the true reasons for his exclusion,
or that of his relatives, from the
country is to invite an action for
libel. Disagreeable though depart-
mental silence may be, there is no
other course as the practice of
every country in the world, without
exception, shows.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE LABOR PARTY
How Labor Destroys
a Labor Government
The March on Sydney
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
F. E. CHAMBERLAIN
The Ruler.
In a perverse way I am a Chamberlain
admirer. Almost alone among con-
temporary Labor leaders, he knows
where he is going and how he is going
to get where he is heading.
When Mr F. E. Chamberlain (WA)
flanked by J. Keeffe (Q’ld) and Cyril
Wyndham (Vic.), marches on State Par-
liament House in Macquarie Street, Syd-
ney, on the State Aid issue he will be
demonstrating nakedly who will be run-
ning Australia if the Labor Party is re-
turned to power at the next Federal elec-
ions.
The rulers will not be the Federal
Labor leader, Mr Calwell, his deputy, Mr
Whitlam, and their Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party followers. The rulers will
be Mr Chamberlain and his Left-wing
associates, who between them control the
ALP Federal Executive, that body of
12 men, most of them unknown to the
general public, who comprise Labor’s
supreme governing body between the
biennial ALP conferences.
Three State Labor Governments
Victoria, Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia have been destroyed since
Chamberlain became the big man of the
Labor movement, far outranking in im-
portance such puny figures as the
Federal Parliamentary Labor leader or
State Labor Premiers. Time after time
his determination to make the Federal
Parliamentary party supinely subservient
to the ALP machine has cost Labor any
opportunity it might otherwise have had
to secure Federal power.
Only at the last elections, when Mr
Calwell created the public fiction that he
was a party leader and not a puppet for
the Chamberlain-dominated ALP mach-
ine, was Labor able to exploit the weak-
nesses in the Menzies Government’s posi-
tion sufficiently adroitly to come within a
seat of winning Federal power. Now Mr
Chamberlain is making a mockery of
Mr Calwell's fiction. Now he appears
quite ready to wreck both the Heffron
State Labor Government and Calwell's
chances at the next Federal elections.
Nominally he had made NSW’s
defiance of ALP Federal policy on State
aid to parents with children at non-State
schools the issue between the Right and
Left wings. This is an issue which suits
him. He can exploit the sectarian feel-
ings always latent in the Australian com-
munity. But this is only the nominal
issue. The real issue is who is to run a
government the people elected by the
voters to run it, or Chamberlain and
his allies on the ALP Federal Executive?
The very fact that, instead of
leaving the NSW delegates to the
ALP Federal Executive meeting last
week in Adelaide Mr C. T. Oliver,
NSW ALP president, and Mr W. R. Col-
bourne, NSW State secretary to get
the NSW Government to correct the
position, the Executive decided to send
in an investigating triumvirate, is in
itself a threat. Unless the Executive
“meant business’’ it would have left the
tidying up to Oliver and Colbourne.
HThe personnel of the triumvirate and the
phoniness of any issue, other than
the basic one of who is to run Labor
governments, the elected representatives
or the Left-wing Federal Executive, is
shown by the personnel selected by the
Executive to do the investigating. First
there is Mr Cyril Wyndham, the new
Federal ALP secretary. Mr Wyndham
represents Victoria, the State which defied
the Federal ban on unity tickets between
Communists and ALP members in trade
union elections and gave the Communist
Party a control of trade unions that be-
came a national scandal.
Secondly, there is Mr Chamberlain
himself, who determinedly and success-
fully backed Victoria during the years in
which Victoria was defying Federal
policy. There is Mr J. Keeffe, Federal
ALP president, who represents the
Queensland ALP, which is dominated by
the Communist-controlled Brisbane
Trades Hall and who is authorising the
torpedoing through the “New Age”, offi-
cial organ of the ALP in Queensland, of
the interpretation of Labor's policy on
Malaysia given to Parliament by Mr
Calwell in the recent debate.
There are those who say that Cham-
berlain is working to a long-range Left-
wing plan. Otherwise his ruthless deter-
mination to sacrifice Labor governments
and Labor Federal electoral prospects
would be so much meaningless destruc-
tion.
This school of thought believes that
Chamberlain and his Left-wing associates
do not want Labor to win the next elec-
tions. Subservient as it has become, the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Caucus is
not yet sufficiently subservient. Due to the
strength they draw from the existence of
the NSW Labor Government and the
NSW Right-wing ALP Executive, there
is still a section of Caucus, which in-
cludes parliamentarians from other States
as well as NSW, which is prepared, if not
to defy, a least to obstruct, the Left-wing
Federal ALP controllers on key issues
on which the Left-wing want a line
dangerously close to pro-Communism.
This school of thought believes that the
Left-wing would sooner have Labor kept
out of office until the machine's grip on
the Federal Parliamentary party has be-
come complete. And, if to improve the
Left-wing’s prospects of getting a com-
pletely subservient Federal Caucus the
NSW Labor Government has to be
wrecked, then the sooner it is wrecked
the better.
This theory is substantiated to some
degree by the fact that the machine is
prepared to let the parliamentarians play
round with complete independence on
things that have no real political signi-
ficance, though they might have elec-
toral significance like poker machines
and off-course betting.
But when they attempt to display a
national or Right-wing attitude on things
like international affairs or unity tickets
(which are the major source of Com-
munist strength in the Australian trade
union movement) they are smartly pull-
ed into line.
Mr Chamberlain is obviously hair-
splitting on the NSW Government’s pro-
posal to pay benefits to the parents of
children at non-State schools instead of
paying the same benefits to the children
themselves. In my view, if NSW had
persisted with the motion passed over-
whelmingly by the NSW June conference
for aid in the shape of science labora-
tories and science teaching facilities for
non-State schools, NSW would then have
been defying ALP policy.
But even to Mr Chamberlain it must
be obvious, if he has Labor's electoral
interests at heart, that payments by
Labor governments must be more flex-
ible than the interpretation he has placed
on the Perth decisions. Under his inter-
pretation a Commonwealth Labor Gov-


ernment, as well as withdrawing the aid
given all non-State schools in the Aus-
tralian Capital Territory, would have
to withdraw the assistance it now gives
missions representing many religious
groups in the Northern Territory and
New Guinea. The Executive’s decision to
send its three-man investigating team into
NSW and keep NSW within the precise
letter of Federal ALP policy—which was
interpreted by both Mr Calwell and Mr
Whitlam as allowing NSW to do what it
proposed to do is a deliberate Left-
wing attempt to promote the type of
trouble within the party that could keep
it out of Federal power and wreck the
NSW Labor Government.
Is it that Chamberlain wants a Labor
government only when he and his Left-
wing associates outside Parliament are
in a position to impose their decisions
upon it? It is an intriguing and rather
frightening possibility; frightening be-
cause it means the end of parliamentary
government of the type Australia has
known hitherto.
IMMIGRATION
The New Orr Case
“I have nothing to hide”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HAROLD ORR
To write a book
evening newspapers called him
“Professor” Orr. But by the follow-
ing day he had been reduced to humble
Mr Harold Orr, Los Angeles, school
teacher. Mr Orr had been ordered to
leave the country by the Immigration
Department. He had been here six
months on a business visa and his
application for permanent residence re-
fused. The case was remarkable for this
reason the department had ejected
Italians, Filipinos, Greeks, even English-
men, but for an apparently respectable,
even well-heeled American to be told
to go was extraordinary.
Mr Downer, Minister for Immigration,
would say nothing beyond this: “There
are very substantial reasons for the
refusal.” It could have been a real cause
celebre, something to rival the Gamboa
case, but it was the words, “substantial
reasons”, which made the newspapers
cautious.
The Melbourne “Herald” commented
carefully: “There may be occasions when
it would be undesirable for a govern-
ment to publish its reasons for rejecting
a request to live here. But surely the
applicant himself is entitled to know the
reasons. If he chooses not to disclose
them, then the public could feel more
satisfied that no injustice had been done.”
As for Mr Orr, he was ready and
willing to talk to anyone who called him.
He had no idea why the Government was
doing this. “From ordinary Australians
I have had the greatest kindness.”
ness”.
He said he was not a professor. He
had obtained a Master of Arts degree
from the University at Los Angeles and
he had taught for 32 years in the Los
Angeles district, principally business ad-
ministration and allied subjects.
What had he done? He said that 14
years ago a sub-committee of the State
Legislature in California investigating
education had asked him whether he had
ever been a member of the Communist
Party. “On constitutional grounds I re-
fused to answer, just as hundreds of
others did. Later I told the Press I had
never been a member of the Communist
Party or any other organisation.”
Mr Orr said he was over here to write
a book and to make a capital investment
of 150,000 dollars for a group of Cali-
fornians. The average on top Australian
shares was better than it was on
American shares. The capital of retired
people went further here.
Next day the ABC news carried this
report:
“Mr Orr believes he was trapped by
a Melbourne newspaperman who also
was a security agent. He claims he met
the reporter at a luncheon and spoke
freely when leading questions were put
to him off the record. Mr Orr told the
reporter what he thought of the economic
and other conditions in the United States
and of the activities of the State Depart-
ment and Central Intelligence Agency,
and Mr Orr adds, ‘The sort of remarks
I made were those made by many think-
ing Americans. While they were
critical, they were in no way subversive’.”
Immediately after the news bulletin
Mr K. D. Gott challenged Mr Orr to
say whether he was the journalist whom
Mr Orr believed to be an intelligence
agent. Mr Gott represents interstate and
overseas newspapers in Melbourne. He
is a regular contributor to The
Bulletin and he is a member of the
Federal Executive of the Australian
Journalists’ Association.
Mr Gott said: “Soon after his arrival
Mr Orr was my guest at the Society
Restaurant in Bourke Street. We started
with oysters and finished with Camem-
bert cheese. He was introduced to me as
Professor Orr, and it wasn’t denied. I
had heard that he had taught business
administration so I was interested in his
views on the local economic scene for a
New York business weekly which I
represent. I introduced myself as a rep-
resentative of that paper.
“We talked mainly of investment
matters and I can't remember him say-
ing anything about the US State Depart-
ment or the CIA. I certainly haven’t
relayed anything he said to security or
any other Government agency. I didn’t
publish anything as a result of the inter-
view, because I was disappointed in the
lunch. He didn’t seem to know much
about the Australian financial scene. I
realise he is distraught by the action of
the Immigration Department, and he has
my sympathy.”
The Melbourne “Herald’s” New York
correspondent cabled that Orr had been
president of a Teachers’ Union branch,
Local 430, which had been expelled from
the American Federation of Labor in
1948. In 1946 he appeared before the
California State Senate Committee which
was investigating education, and he was
represented by a lawyer who was known
to have been a long-time member of the
Communist Party.
After the union's expulsion from the
AFL Orr said he denied allegations of
Left-wing tendencies and said his unit
had been expelled because it was “an
aggressive, fighting, liberal union.” He
said: “Because we have been so effective
in the defence of teachers’ interests we
have been subject to attack by various
anti-public education sources.”
Reports from Los Angeles said Orr
graduated from the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles, in 1924 as Bachelor
of Education and he had been a teacher
for 30 years. There was no record of a
Master of Arts degree.
At the end of the week Mr Orr was
still denying heatedly that he had ever
been a Communist. “If Mr Downer
doesn’t want me because of my union
activities, why doesn’t he say so? I’ve
nothing to hide and have always been
truthful and open with everybody.”
His. visa was due to expire on Sunday,
October 6. He sent a telegram to Mr
Downer asking for an extension until
after Dr Cairns raised the matter in the
House.


US INVESTMENT
The Chicago Take-Over
The Race is to the Swift
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MEL BOURNE
LORD CASEY
A reminder
Tt was well and good for Lord Casey
to remind us in his new programme
Conversazione on GTV that our inter-
national security is closely entwined with
the United States and that we should
get closer to that country. He can have
no fear, investment-wise anyway, that the
US is not doing its part.
It already has a big hand in the
motor, petroleum and other industries
here, though nobody is particularly
happy at the strength of its grip. Equally
one wonders if the current grab by one
of its multi-national corporations for a
slice of the Australian pork-packing
business altogether conforms to our best
interests.
Last week, a little more than a year
since it successfully bid £1 9 million for
Queensland National Pastoral Company,
Swift's, the Australian subsidiary of the
US giant International Packers Ltd of
Chicago, made a £2i million takeover
offer for Mayfair Hams, one of the big
four concerns in the pork-packing busi-
ness here. This will spread Swift’s Aus-
tralian interests, previously confined to
beef, over the borders of Queensland and
Victoria, where its five present meat-
works are, into NSW. Mayfair’s main
operation is at Homebush in Sydney. It
also has factories at Newcastle and in
Victoria.
There’s little doubt at all Swift’s will
achieve a cheap entry into our pork
business by getting Mayfair at 40s. a
share despite the share price being 4s.
less than that before the bid was made,
and latest book value of net tangible
assets being only 17s. 2d. a share. The
whole pork-packing industry in this
country has been having a tough time,
as witness its financial results for 1962-
63, when Mayfair Hams’ profit dropped
from £214,743 to £76,124. Moves by
Huttons (last year’s profit down from
£279,863 to £259,353) to acquire
Amagraze of Brisbane show that the
industry generally is looking to possible
mergers to strengthen its economics.
Mergers between wholly Australian-
owned companies, like these two and
Australian Bacon and Mayfair Hams,
may well be desirable to galvanise the
industry and provide a firmer basis for
its development. But what national
advantage is gained by this being under-
taken by a foreign firm like Swift’s in-
stead of an Australian-owned concern?
For instance, will the purchase price
be paid in dollars and so supplement our
international reserves? It could be found
from local sources, as seems to have been
the case with Unilever’s takeover of
Rosella earlier this year Nine months
ago Swift’s had £3? million outstanding
loans from local Australian sources and
doubtless w'ith assets worth some £7 mil-
lion in this country its credit rating leaves
little to be desired.
Swift’s bid would appear to fall foul
of the current Australian mood against
foreign takeovers which add nothing to
the, internal economy, though last week
Sir lan Potter had something to say on
the general issues involved which bears
obliquely on this case. Addressing share-
holders of Australian United Corporation,
he talked of the purchase of Australian
businesses by overseas interests as an
alternative to setting up operations de
novo , stressing that care should be taken
to discriminate between the purchase of
a business as a basis for future expansion
and one bought simply as an investment.
‘"The former has much to commend it
from the national viewpoint the latter
has little.”
It can be taken for granted that Swift’s
are not acquiring Mayfair simplv as an
investment but rather as a basis for ex-
pansion into what is for them a new side
of the meat business in Australia.
Doubtless, with their superior experience
in the packaging industry (they own 45
plants in the US), it can be presumed
they will do equally as good a job as, if
not a better one than Australian manage-
ment in getting this expansion, particu-
larly in the export field. But, then, they
will also get the full fruits of it and this
wilt add further to our future commit-
ments for overseas dividend remittances.
Maybe it would serve us better, certainly
in cases where a foreign takeover doesn’t
bring in additional overseas capital, to
keep such integrations as are necessary
in Australian hands, be content with a
rather lower rate of profit than the
Americans, and keep the fruits at home.
At any rate, if Swift's are wise they
will take Sir lan’s hint and help their
public relations here by providing Aus-
tralian investors with some participa-
tion in their rapidly expanding business
over here. While, as Sir lan said, it is
a little unfair to press for the right for
Australians to invest only in the success-
ful overseas-owned companies operating
here, this would seem to be a good one
to make a start on.
HOW TO BE A POLITICIAN
ffifyulletCn
80 Years Ago: October 13, 1883
A man who intends to earn his living
T*- by being a professional politician
in Australia should observe a few
simple rules. In the first place, he
should join every secret society he
can get access to. He cannot too
thoroughly or too early comprehend
th,s fundamental truth that it is ever
so much easier to be a good Mason ,
or a “good Orangeman”, or a “good
Templar”, than it is to be a good man;
and, inversely, that one may be a
sharper in business, corrupt in public
life, and untrustworthy in every other
relation, without losing the counten-
ance of one’s secret-society brethren,
so long as one maintains a good
appearance, of fervent devotion to the
standard of this or that organisation.
The first object of anyone who
designs to live upon the community
should therefore be to work his way
to “high degrees” in secret societies.
This is very much easier than you
would think. The competition is
trifling. The ordinary member is
easily discounted. He has joined
owing to a feminine curiosity, or an
infantile vanity. He lusted to know
the dread secrets and gri and .

j^ as , no . s P ecia ' object in view, once
" e 1S * n ’ whereas the professional
schemer knows exactly what he wants,
The earnest members who compete
with him for the “high” offices are
mostly zealots; and a zealot is
generally a fool. They are also honest,
and that fact places them at a
tremendous disadvantage. It may cost
some dexterity, effort, and even a
little money, to get up. But, once up,
nothing is easier than to maintain
one’s position.

CRIME
Young Crooks...
Despite censorship
FROM A LAUNCESTON CORRESPONDENT
ROY FAGAN
No identification
TUsmanians have now had a year to
learn something of the operations
of children’s courts and of the degree
of juvenile delinquency in the State.
Whether the knowledge has affected the
behavior of Tasmanian youths remains
to be seen, but at least the young of-
fender is no longer jn ignorance of the
children's court as a retributive in-
strument.
This was not always so. Until last
year a newspaper reference to the court
was unlawful, and it was undoubtedly
true that many boys and girls were un-
aware of the court’s existence. Wrong-
doers who had been before the court
were often contemptuous of ill-equipped
do-gooders who sometimes inhabited its
bench and felt warm in the absolute ban
on reports of its proceedings.
“Until I’m 17 I can have a lot of
fun and only the Johns will know about
it,” one young lawbreaker explained.
- The report of a parliamentary com-
mittee, an outspoken statement by the
headmaster of Launceston High School
and the appearance in Launceston
Magistrate’s Court of “The Examiner”
and its editor for knowingly publishing
details of the children’s court punish-
ment of some very defiant young crimi-
nals increased public pressure on the
Government.
Last October Attorney-General Roy
Fagan agreed that he would periodically
release details of juvenile court pro-
ceedings. Nothing would be reported
which might individually identify the
offenders, Mr Fagan said. The news-
papers and public had never suggested
that such identification should be per-
mitted.
Mr Fagan said that he would issue
reports immediately “when offences by
juveniles caused alarm in the com-
munity,” and that periodical statistical
reports would show the numbers and
types of offences and something of the
punishments imposed. When juveniles
were jointly charged with youths of
more than 17 they would appear to-
gether in the adult courts and the cases
could be fully reported except for the
suppression of identifying details con-
cerning the juveniles.
The Opposition throughout had main-
tained that children’s courts should be
open to the Press and fully reported,
except for names and addresses. This,
Liberal Leader Angus Bethune main-
tained, would help to keep parents and
children aware of the dangers of bad
company and irresponsible behavior.
The Government was adamant that only
Mr Fagan’s reports would be permitted.
His first list came out in February.
It disclosed that in the nine months to
January 31, 170 children had been be-
fore the courts, 52 on charges of steal-
ing and 43 for breaking, entering and
stealing. Sixty-six were put under super-
vision orders and 27 Were made wards
of the State, which may involve a term
in the home for delinquent boys.
The advent of police magistrates and
specially selected honorary justices to
the bench had obviously given the child-
ren’s court new teeth. Sternness had
replaced homilies. In March, Mr Fagan
reported that on one day eight of 11
boys who appeared in Launceston were
fined. A few days later a 16-year-old
in Hobart was fined £3l 10s. for a
series of offences involving cars.
More recently, since segregated ac-
commodation has been provided for
young delinquents at Risdon Jail, the
courts have shown an increased tendency
to imprison older boys. One aged 16
years and 11 months was given six
months when found guilty of 10 charges
of illegally using cars and 10 of break-
ing, entering and stealing.
Another, aged 16k, was given three
months after his conviction on 72
charges of dishonesty.
Statistics, however, disclose an almost
entire absence of violent crime and of
sexual assaults among the under-17's.
As in Britain, the vicious and senselessly
violent streak seems to appear most
among the 18-22 years group.
MORALS
...And Sex Kittens
A special reformatory?
FROM AN ADELAIDE CORRESPONDENT
Tn the Adelaide Criminal Court the
other day a young man was released
on a good behavior bond on an admitted
charge of indecently assaulting a girl
aged 15. Mr Justice Travers said the
defendant had received an invitation “in
very plain terms” from the girl. “We
seem to have in our midst a kind of
generation sometimes described as sex
kittens young girls under the age of
consent who seem to have a good deal
more knowledge of sex than even a
professional prostitute would be expected
to have,” Mr Justice Travers said. “Many
of them are a menace to the youths of
the community.”
Mr Justice Travers went on to describe
these sex kittens going “merrily on their
way looking for a new victim” while the
last one was being punished by the Court.
His suggestion: It would be salutory if
the Criminal Court had the power to send
sex kittens to a reformatory or some
other appropriate place.
Recently there have been several
comments about the moral danger to
youths of some girls. The only course
open to the Courts has been to declare
the girls uncontrolled children. The
Attorney-General (Mr Rowe) quickly
called for a report on Mr Justice Travers’
suggestion, and it was announced that
State Cabinet would consider the
question of punishment of sex kittens.

EATERS - AND REVOLVING DRINKERS
|L/Jelbourne is a jolly good calorie
town. This week a fancy new
restaurant opened at Albert Park. It
is on the edge of the lake, and flanked
by golf courses. There are splendid
views in all directions. It caters for
180 people, but the centrepiece, the
crowning touch, is the circular bar.
It seats 18 people and rotates gently
like a merry-go-round.
Only, the seasoned drinkers find
this disconcerting. They find it hard
to forget the old rule once the bar
starts to rotate it is time to call a
taxi.
On the other hand, how about
Capers in Collins Street? Capers is
known as an Angus Steak House, but
for the past fortnight it has been
branching out. The proprietor, Ross
Shelmerdine, believes that the people
should know more about meat. Every-
thing else is branded, from apples to
detergent; why not steak?
So Capers is offering the choice of
Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn, Santa
Gertrudis or Brahman steaks. An
Aberdeen Angus skin is stretched
across the foyer, and as you sit down
to devour your Hereford or Santa
Gertrudis all this can be a trifle dis-
concerting. Photographs of the beasts
themselves look down upon you with
sad, melting eyes.
The privilege of eating your
favorite animal is not to be taken
lightly. Fillet of Angus, Hereford or
Shorthorn comes to 235. 6d. a serve,
Santa Gertrudis or the sacred
Brahman is 475.
Capers eventually will return to its
old function of being an Aberdeen
Angus house, but do not be alarmed
—the Hereford Society is making a
counter - attack. A Hereford house
will open at the Hotel Australia before
the end of the year.
Naturally, with all this eating we
have to be calorie-conscious. Our
local chemist sells 50 different slim-
ming potions, pills, pellets, biscuits
and drinks. Our nearest book shop
has 32 different books on dieting. In
the medical book category they are
second-best sellers, coming hard be-
hind sex education.
So. thinking of my own expanding
waistline, I was excited when I
received a pamphlet announcing that
Lelord Kordel, author of “Eat and
Grow Younger”, was coming to town
and would give a series of FREE
lectures. The pamphlet said: “Two
lectures that may add extra years to
your life,” and it added that Mr
Kordel expected to live to be 120.
The last American health expert I
interviewed was Mr Bernarr Mac-
Fadden. He was 83 at the time, and
he had just parachuted out of an aero-
plane into the Hudson River. He
looked extraordinarily fit. He said
things about his sexual prowess which
were quite disturbing. Indeed, he
expected to live to be 125. He ate
grass, beets and carrots and he im-
proved his gums by chewing pieces
of mahogany. Unfortunately he
didn’t live to be 125, and I was most
disappointed when he died four years
later.
IV/Tr Lelord Kordel’s first lecture
was in the Myer Mural Hall at
9.15 a.m. When I arrived, about 50
women and four men were already
seated.
Mr Kordel strode in. All the
buttons of his jacket were done up
here there was no excess poundage.
He started off with a bang: “How
are you? Feel all right this bright
morning?” And before any of us
could say “Can’t complain” he was
telling us that he was 59 years old
and that he had never had a day’s
sickness in his life. Nor had his
children, nor his grandchildren, ever
suffered a day’s sickness. He had
stuck on 175 lb. for the past 25 years
and he proposed to live to be 120.
“Let food be your medicine,” he
said, “and leave the drugs in the
chemist’s pot. How do you start the
day? Many miss breakfast; now, that’s
a nutritional sin. Get up half an hour
early and eat a good breakfast, a
protein breakfast.”
From here Lelord warmed to his
subject. Starchy foods were the
menace. He didn’t smoke and never
did he have more than a casual social
drink, but he knew that people could
become starch and sugar drunkards
just the same as liquor drunkards.
“I don’t want to frighten you,” he
said. “And I won’t say the right
foods are a cure for cancer. On
these things you must consult a
doctor.” But, just the same, he told
us about an American biochemist who
had two lots of trout in separate tanks.
The first he fed balls of meat. The
second set he fed balls of carbo-
hydrates that tasted like meat. At the
end of six months the first set were fit
and healthy, the second had cancer of
the liver. The message was clear.
Always eat natural foods, he said:
fruit, honey, nuts, all those things
which had received little treatment.
While all this information was most
valuable, one couldn’t help but wonder
who was paying for the FREE
lectures. This, too, became clear. He
said: “Now that I have explained to
you the problems, I suggest that, to
gain a full understanding of what to
eat, upon leaving here you go to the
book department and buy a copy of
one of my books, ‘Eat and Grow
Younger’.”
He told us all about the marvellous
vegetable juices and the various
gadgets for extracting juice from
carrots and such. “I will be demon-
strating one of these machines at
11.30 on the second floor of the other
building.”
Then, when you come home in the
evening, suffering from brain fatigue,
there was nothing like three or four
black olives. The effect of these was
amazing. In a very short time they
gave you a real mental lift. “These
are available downstairs in the Myer’s
food department.”
Cider vinegar, too, was an excel-
lent tonic. Take a spoonful in a glass
of water three or four times a day.
It was rich in potassium, good for the
heart, kidneys and liver. Makes a very
pleasant drink. “Cider vinegar is
available in the food department
downstairs.”
“My one happiness,” he said, “is to
see all people healthy.” He told us
all to be at his two free lectures at the
Town Hall, and the meeting was
closed.

TAHITI: Paradise Lost
When the H-bomb comes
By GEORGE FARWELL
IN recent weeks French jetliners
touching down at Darwin and Alice
Springs have been carrying unusual
tourists on the Paris-Tahiti run. They
are one-way tourists. Ex-members of the
Foreign Legion, with no homeland since
Algeria won independence, they have a
new mission which not even P. C. Wren
would have found romantic. De Gaulle
has ordered an assault on the last region
of the globe where men can still live
in a state of natural beauty.
Having lost his Sahara proving
grounds, he has turned to the Central
Pacific as the only “desert” available for
his H-bomb experiments. At first glance
the bare Mururoa atoll in the Gambier
group, 750 miles south-east of Tahiti,
may seem a more or less innocuous site,
whatever the local islanders feel about
it. But his base of operations is to be
Tahiti itself.
Earlier this year I watched French con-
scripts from Algeria disembarking in
Papeete. Since then more than 300
Legionnaires and technicians have arrived.
In less than a year's time there will be
3,000. And Tahiti is a small, already
crowded island, obliged to live mainly
on costly, imported food. Industrial
plants and workshops are going up on a
reclaimed lagoon where, in earlier years,
I used to dive with fish spear and goggles
in the clear, green water, where Poly-
nesian fishermen hauled in their long
seine nets and drifted by night along the
coral reef in outrigger canoes as they
had done for centuries.
In September the first convoy sailed
for Mururoa. Soon military planes, naval
and supply ships, will shuttle through
the remote coral atolls of the Tuamotus,
which R. L. Stevenson and James
Norman Hall once wrote about in lyrical
fashion. Security guards in French
Oceania. It is the end of an era; an era
that began with the romantic discoveries
of Wallis, Cook and Bougainville nearly
200 years ago.
It has always been nonsense, of course,
to talk of Polynesia as some kind of
paradise, as so many writers have. Its
slow corruption goes back to the time
of those early voyagers, to the 19th cen-
tury whaling fleets and adventurers who
infected the Tahitians with rum, gun-
powder, syphilis, TB, and the wowserism
of frock-coated missionaries. Somehow,
because they were so hard to reach, the
islands managed to retain their careless,
enchanting atmosphere. But there has
always been more to the Tahitian legend
than mere beachcombing and vahines of
easy virtue.
The two years I spent there before the
war were something I could never forget;
its fantastic beauty, its indifference to
any other values but its own, the sense
of freedom unknown to the world of
industry and commerce. Above all, there
was the tolerance and gaiety of the
Tahitians, who have never been able to
understand the masochism and guilt
feelings of the popaa (Europeans).
For them there are two worlds: the
life of Tahiti and a mysterious region
somewhere over the horizon known as
fenua popaa land of the white man.
Popaaland is an incomprehensible land
where all kinds of absurdities exist, where
everyone is rich and all the goods and
dollars you need are produced without
working. It is no good telling Polynesians
anything else. Tahitians are usually
assumed to be more intelligent than that,
yet it has the same basis as the Cargo
Cults that break out repeatedly among
more primitive Pacific societies. Tahiti
has its own kind of Cargo Cult, and even
its mixed-blood businessmen have lately
been affected. Its most recently mani-
festation is the myth of the American
millionaire.
In 1959 Tahiti entered the jet age,
and its most precious asset remote-
ness —began to disappear. It has already
become nothing more than another over-
night stop on a round-the-world air
ticket; one more tourist resort trying to
exploit a vanished legend.
Deciding to return there last year, I
chose to disregard the warnings many
people had given me. “You won't like
it now,” one of them said before we
sailed from Sydney. “It’s one large clip
joint now. Remember the old Polynesian
songs? They don’t even sing them any
more.”
I preferred to trust my own memory.
The unreal beauty of this steep, volcanic
island rising from a tropic blue sea; the
leisurely and richly-coloured flow of life
in quiet Papeete; the wild, green valleys;
swift-flowing rivers rippling over stones
where long-haired women in red parens
washed their clothes; fishermen silhouet-
ted with spears poised on gunmetal
lagoons at sundown; the timeless break
of surf upon a reef. Such things are still
there. You can see them from your win

dow on the standard, if expensive, taxi
tour around the island. But to become a
part of that life as I had done before;
that has become extremely difficult.
The new tourist industry has built a
coconut curtain, keeping the visitor to
certain well-defined tracks. You either
stay in one of a dozen artificial and high-
priced hotels, or you do not stay at all.
You move like so many units on an
assembly line, shedding your money as
you go in the fashion of some bygone
“milord” visiting an exclusive Riviera
resort. In that way, at least, modern
Tahiti is very French—except that tariffs
are more commonly priced in dollars.
Several of these places, listing themselves
as “first-class” hotels, will cost you forty
dollars a day with no service what-
ever, except at the expensive bar.
As for trying to find a rented
bungalow, easily obtained a few years
ago, our experience was typical.
One agency offered us a small bunga-
low on Pirae beach, three miles out of
town. “It has everything you want,” the
French lady told us. “Even electric light
and running water. Only 40 dollars a
week.” I explained we were looking for
the simple life.
“But it has a maid,” she said.
“Times have changed . .
T knew something of the extravagant
way Tahitian girls keep house, and
dared not think how much all that would
cost. Next day the French lady offered us
another bungalow; the same one, I sus-
pected. It had dropped by ten dollars.
We were still unmoved.
“But it has a maid,” she said.
Before the war, on that same beach,
I had lived in a palm-thatched cottage for
30s. a month. But times had changed,
they told me. It hardly seems to account
for an increase of 9000 per cent,
especially in such an undeveloped island.
A few miles beyond Papeete everything
is just as primitive as it used to be. Yet
people are still asking up to £2O a week
for mosquito-ridden hot boxes without
power, refrigeration or plumbing of any
kind. Eventually, but only through Tahi-
tian friends, we did find one more reason-
ably-priced bungalow in an outlying dis-
trict, and later shared another place with
a Polynesian family. In both we lived
like 19th-century bush pioneers, using
oil lamps, a single primus, a wire-mesh
meat safe for perishable food. At least
it had a Polynesian atmosphere, but it
was still expensive.
Tahiti’s New Deal, if you can call it
that, dates back to 1959. It was then
that the traditional French policy was
reversed. The earlier climate had been
one of laissez faire. The Tahitians were
left to their own devices; tourism was
thought of as something unsettling; and
government funds for development often
went, in the typically French phrase, a
la poche. After all, the tropic sun was
warm, the girls willing, rum punches
cheap and the Polynesians seemed con-
tented with their easy-going existence.
Only the sun is unchanged these days.
Then, with the collapse of the French
empire, Paris decided it could no longer
afford to spend money on this lovely, but
unproductive daughter.
A stocktaking showed that the rich
phosphate island of Makatea was almost
worked out, copra prices were down and
coconut trees mostly too old to be
economic. Nor had anyone troubled to
put fisheries or tropical fruits on an
export basis, as Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and
the Cook Islands have done. Visiting
Tahiti in 1959, Deputy-Premier Jacques
Soustelle announced regretfully, “When
you have a paradise you have no tourists.
When you have tourists you have no
paradise.” But there was no alternative,
he said. The daughter must earn her own
keep.
We all know what happens to beautiful
girls who can make a living no other
way. And so to tourism. However, M
Soustelle hoped she might avoid the
worst excesses of prostitution he had
noted in Hawaii.
A few months later, with the building
of a jet airport, such hopes were crudely
ended.
They were ended mainly by French
commercial interests. And by the demis
(mixed bloods who form what passes for
an island aristocracy). Few of the many
thousand demis have land or business
investments. Some, however, had been
lucky enough to acquire European
adventurers or runaway sailors for
grandfathers, long-sighted men who
shacked up with native girls having land
as well as looks. Today their progeny
there are five first families own
the brewery, concessions for electric
power, plantations, import firms, shipping
agencies and stores (except for the
smaller, suburban or district stores, which
are all Chinese-owned). They are also
masters of the island's politics. When
France found itself with a strong inde-
pendence movement after the war, it
set up a local Territorial Assembly,
though giving it extremely limited
powers. This was soon dominated by the
most articulate and well-heeled group,
the demis. They readily accepted French
advice and appeared to identify their
private interests with the island’s needs.
When France “advised” it to build
a £2,00,000 airport, the Assembly
accepted it as a charge on local funds,
despite bitter opposition by the Tahitian
Nationalist Party. It became one of
the two major factors in the present
steep inflation. The other was the
Assembly itself. It has a ‘Cabinet” of
three, plus thirty-two members who are
paid some £5O weekly all year round,
plus expenses and perks, for a session
that lasts less than two months. This is
a pretty heavy burden on a population
of 60,000, including all the other islands,
especially as the demis refused to accept
any form of income tax. France at pre-
sent contributes roughly fifty per cent of
the budget, but many millions of Pacific
francs have still to be found some other
way.
Living costs up 500 per cent
is only one way. By Customs
duties. Most of these come from
imports; the rest from duty on the export
of copra, vanilla, sugar and pearl shell,
all of them with uncertain markets.
Import duties have naturally hit the
mass of the islanders hardest, and most
of them have only a subsistence econ-
omy. The cost of living has risen in
catastrophic fashion. Recent figures
revealed an increase of 500 per cent
since the war; and costs are rising still.
This year I checked through the list
of duties, learning why even the com-
paratively well-off visitor finds Tahitian
living so expensive. On top of heavy
shipping costs half-way round the word,
imposts range up to 50 per cent on motor
vehicles, including public transport,
canned foods (and there is little fresh
food), tobacco, clothing and chemist
lines and this includes essential
medicines. Penicillin, the cure-all of
local doctors, costs £2 a shot in Papeete’s
three prospering pharmacies.
One can imagine the United Nations
protest if Australia imposed such duties
on the people of New Guinea.
For the average Tahitian family the
final hardship has come with hotels for
the tourist trade. These mav have put
a little money in the way of fishermen,
taxi drivers, waitresses, the long-haired
chambermaids and other entertainers.
But they have also made staple foods
scarcer, and in more costly demand. In
Papeete’s early morning market I found
myself complaining as much as Tahitians
at the price of tuna steaks, fresh meat,
papaya or mountain oranges. The shiny
new taxis cost nearly Bs. a mile, and,
unlike the excellent mini-buses of Nou-
mea, there is no other transport but
crowded country buses making one trip
daily; before dawn and around sunset.
As for the price of drinks nothing
can be bought under 80 francs (95.) a
glass, except the light local beer. Even

MEMBER OF INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS-T. A. P. ROSS, Mgr.


Polynesian wage-earners nowadays find
town rents rising beyond their reach;
£4 to £5 weekly for a sub-standard
house.
Modern Papeete, never noted for its
housing or sanitation, is starting to
crowd into once rural areas, uprooting
payable coconut palms, fruit trees and
vegetable gardens as it spreads. The
huge airport, too, has obliterated a fish-
ing settlement beside a grand lagoon
where I had lived tranquilly before the
war. Soon a new town is to be built at
the far end of the island, mainly to serve
the French Navy and Government of-
ficials.
Professor Parkinson himself would
feel at home in this South Sea setting
now. In pre-war days there were less
than 100 French officials in Oceania.
Today they have passed the thousand.
There are more serious features to
the urbanising policy. Chief of these is
juvenile delinquency. During my stay
last year a new institution was opened
in Moorea, nine miles across that
superb aquamarine sea, with room for
a hundred youths charged with petty
crime. This unidyllic view of paradise
was ably summed up by one member
of the Assembly last year, Mme Rosa
Raoulx, who is also chief of the Arue
district.
“Too many people are on the roads,
the quays, in bars and cinemas. Youth
from the islands and districts are not
equipped to resist the temptations of the
town and, above all, are being neglected
by their parents.”
The Roman Catholic bishop also ex-
pressed concern last year about the de-
cline in sexual morals, never a strong
point in Tahiti. In his view, what had
been a fairly harmless condition ten or
even five years ago, was now. becoming
professionalised. It began, he suggested,
with the new tourism.
200 years of sex
Oex and the South Seas, in the popular
view, have long been synonymous.
Popular anthropologists as well as Holly-
wood script-writers have exploited them
with great profit. Visitors for nearly
two centuries have turned them to ad-
vantage; ever since the Dolphin’s sea-
men almost took their ship to pieces
by trading nails for female favors at
Cook’s adroitly-named Point Venus. The
Polynesian has always looked on love-
making as a normal part of life. And
what he has seen of European behavior,
including the early missions, has done
nothing to change his mind. Mme
Raoulx’s strictures, however, point up
a different situation.
The new tourism is well aware of it,
too. Every country, through its pub-
licity, strives for a single image. Swiss
posters illustrate mountain lakes; Canad-
ian ones the Rockies. Tahiti’s image is
the mons veneris, discreetly draped.
Watching the almost daily plane-load of
tourists drifting aimlessly in Papeete’s
streets, I wondered about this image.
According to travel statistics, 75 per
cent of world tourists are women over
forty. At least they are able to snap
garlanded and drunken molls outside
Quinn’s celebrated bar as they would
never dare to do at home.
If the vahines crowding these water-
front dives were also classified as delin-
quents, that “house of correction” in
Moorea would have to be doubled in
size. They are pathetic by-products of
Tahiti’s economic squeeze. As one
Tahitian woman told us: why bother to
send girls to school; few of them can
ever hope for jobs, for the rapidly in-
creasing Chinese own most of the island
commerce and they look after their own.
What else is there? The good girls dance
for the tourists. The bad ones dance as
well.
The situation was outlined with frank-
ness last year in a guide book sponsored,
aptly perhaps, by the Chamber of Com-
merce. Among useful advice on island
services (printed only if paid for), was
a chapter in quaint Bronx English
headed “Boy Meets Girl in Tahiti”:
“Don’t expect to come here arid
just ‘knock them off.’ Most experi-
enced male visitors who have given
this entire subject careful study
state that only three or four out
of every ten men find what they
are looking for. Remember, there
are Tahitian men, Frenchmen, sol-
diers, sailors and other males here
who have first call on the girls ...”
There follows a frivolous passage on
the perils of VD, free advice to “the
most average of gal (European)” who,
with the surplus of males, can “make
out like mad,” and some final hints on
how to pick up vahines in the sleazy
nightspots. “These kind of girls are not
very attractive, to say the least. One
Australian tourist said, ‘I wouldn’t be
caught dead with any of them.’ ” This
must be the most offensive comment
ever published officially about an in-
digenous population.
It is an approach vigorously criticised
last year by the independent French
editor of “Les Debats”; the one intelligent
newspaper, and since put out of business.
He was commenting on the sharp de-
cline in tourists, caused largely by un-
real tariffs for hotels and tours.
(This year’s official figure of 32,000
comprises mainly through-passengers by
air and visitors from passing ships.)
“The repercussions are grave for the
entire economy,” he wrote. “It is time
promoters gave up publicising Polynesia
as a land where you can play with pretty
girls, but as a country with an open-air
life, water sports, sailing, underwater
fishing and beautiful landscapes . . .
Can one launch a new industry and
neglect small profits when one has no
clients at all? Yet local tourist bodies
search only for a rich elite. Even so
the rich tourists who touch down in
Tahiti find only a neglected town, badly
lit and ill-planned, with no entertainment
recommended but a tour of bistros un-
frequentable by normal people. All that
flower there are drunken fauns en-
couraged by politicians who exploit
them and an administration bent on in-
creasing such places. Instead tourists
ought to see Polynesia as a whole, its
beauty and its gentleness, its whole-
some atmosphere, its joie de vivre.”
A valid image
Tt was criticism of this kind that led
to his deportation late last year; en-
gineered, it was widely rumored, by
one of the leading demis in the As-
sembly. He was also accused of politi-
cal intrigue.
Yet his image of the real Polynesia
is a valid one. Not many people see it.
They are kept within the closed circle
of bogus-Tahitian hotel and tawdry bar,
meeting only their own kind, glad to
escape to other lands after a few boring,
idle days, gypped in the waterside bou-
tiques which charge double the rate of
normal stores around the corner.
Personally I am glad of this exclusion.
The demoralising of Polynesia is far
enough gone already. Each new contact
with European money-values makes
things worse. The Tahitian is too naive,
too pleasure-loving and reckless of to-
morrow to withstand the pressures of the
outside world. Yet he is a character I
have long learned to love. His sim-
plicity, his ready emotions and generosi-
ties are too rare to be exploited. He is
growing soured already. Soon the popaa
may be as actively disliked as he is in
Jamaica, Panama and the sensitive parts
of Africa.
When I left Tahiti I felt there was
still some hope of preserving its unique
qualities. The present nuclear policy has
ended that. During the last war, the
French refused to have US troops sta-
tioned there, fearing that so many Euro-
peans might swamp the island life. Next
year 3000 atomic workers will be based
there. Already land speculators, hotel
promoters and high living costs are
forcing Tahitians off the beaches and
garden plots they have worked for cen-
turies.
“Within ten years we’ll be driven into
the mountains,” one of the more
thoughtful of them said to me. “Once they
take our land from us, we’re finished.
It's what happened in Hawaii.”

South Africa: Two-Way Traffic
Australians are “harsh, tough and uneultured"
By JOHN BRINK
Niksteen-fifty-seven to 1961
those were the great exodus years
for “white” South Africa. “Whites”
are still migrating, but with the intro-
duction of an assisted passage immigra-
tion scheme, 1962 saw more coming in
than going out a reversal of the
position over the previous five years.
For the time being, at least, the attrac-
tion of the Gracious Living which goes
with cheap black labor seems to out-
weigh the threat of black revolution.
Besides, the ruling Afrikaners (Boers)
are more favorably disposed to British
immigrants than formerly at least
they’re “white.”
It is often said that it’s the cream
of its white population that South
Africa is losing. Academics, doctors,
scientists, lawyers, prosperous business-
men they have poured out in their
thousands and Australia (although by
agreement she may not advertise for
immigrants in South Africa) has reaped
a goodly share of this high-grade crop
of South African emigres. In 1959-60
particularly, the word went out that the
boom was on in Australia, assisted pass-
ages were easy to get, L. J. Hooker had
an office in Johannesburg, and what with
Sharpville just behind us and the promise
of increasing racial strife, White Aus-
tralia took on a special sort of glamor.
Several migrant ships found it profitable
to alter course and sail to Australia
via the Cape. Passages were booked
two years ahead.
Sydney today has a South African
colony of some 3000. It would be more
correct to say that there are two col-
onies, overlapping at some points: the
fugitives from the present regime, and
the fugitives from the future. Both would
say that they left . . . “because South
Africa today is no place to bring up
your children,” but they mean different
things.
The first group means that they could
no longer tolerate life in a country where
their children were being indoctrinated
in school and conditioned by their en-
tire environment outside of the home to
a racist philosophy of life; where at the
age of 16 they are liable for compulsory
military service to enforce a system of
“white” supremacy of which their par-
ents disapprove. The second group
means that they could foresee the in-
evitability of “black” domination during
their children’s lifetime and preferred to
move out before this disaster could
overtake them.
Members of the first group display
an understandable duality in their ap-
proach to their new country. On the
one hand they tend to transfer their
loyalty to Australia more readily than
the “Beware the black menace” group.
They fled a fear-ridden environment and
personal relationships fraught with ten-
sion: by contrast Australia seems a free
country with an atmosphere more re-
laxed than they’d ever dared to dream
possible this side of the grave. They are
reluctant to see faults here, try to build
a circle of friends among Australians
rather than seek out other ex-South Af-
ricans, take pride in being assimilable
and attack the washing-up as to the
manner born.
On the other hand these are the
people who had come to the point
where continued life in South Africa
entailed violation of their sensitive con-
sciences. They had been involved to a
greater or lesser extent in anti-apartheid
movements before migrating (at least
two living in Sydney today did a spell
in prison for political non-conformism,
and another was a Progressive Party
candidate in the last general election
and a Johannesburg alderman)
So, while at one level they welcome
escape from the stress of the South Af-
rican situation, on another they miss the
stimulation of participation in its ex-
citing drama; their consciences are
sharpened, too, by concern for the plight
of the comrades they left behind. So
to some extent they tend to flock to-
gether. It is people of this stamp, for
instance, who took the initiative in the
recent formation of the South African
Defence and Aid Fund in Australia.
The other group settles into the local
pattern somewhat more painfully. What-
ever their fears for South Africa’s to-
morrow, the memory of yesterday con-
tains the garden-boy, the house-boy and
the nurse-girl and a life of leisure in
consequence. They also band together,
either informally or in organisations like
the Springbok Club, drawing a sense of
security in an alien environment from
contact with one another.
They live in an aura of nostalgia for
“home,” their faces lighting up with
pleasure when they hear another South
African accent unexpectedly “It’s the
smell of the veld I crave” one told me
He was a city boy and probably hadn’t
smelt it that often but he expressed the
expatriate’s yearning for the familiar
things he’d always taken for granted.
The kookaburra seems to mock the
memory of the bokmakierie and the
mountains have a sawn-off appearance.
There are endless comparisons to be
made and none of them is compli-
mentary to Australia. The man who said
the last word was complaining about
the orange he was eating: ‘‘They’re not
like back home . . . too sweet!” Another,
who hailed from the beautiful, gracious
Cape, was saving money to return; “The
people here are harsh, tough and un-
cultured,” he said, “and the Afrikaners
are the gentlest, most civilised people on
earth; I can’t wait to get back to them.”
Some do go back. There is an econ-
omic boom on in South Africa at the
moment, and strong measures to deal
with those who would upset the tradi-
tional white supremacy. But enough of
Australia is sufficiently similar to what
they left behind to keep the majority
of South African immigrants here: the
sunshine, the emphasis on sport and the
outdoor life and the informal manners
are all a part of the South African way
of life too, and it is truly amazing how
soon the wife gets used to doing her
own chores.
A Deceptively Mild Man
No time for idiots
By CHARLES SRIBER
Sydney people might be forgiven if
the picture they cherish of their
City Medical Officer, Dr John Hirsh-
man, is one of a man quick to take a
stand on almost any issue a veritable
tub-thumping champion of causes lost
and thriving. In recent weeks opinions
volunteered or solicited have come from
the doctor on such subjects as the ABC,
fluoridation, religious education in
schools, socialised medicine, civil liber-
ties, the state of the police force and
the consumption of phenacetin.
Yet John Hirshman is a deceptively

mild man. Opinions and he has them
on hand for most public issues are
delivered in a studied, almost flat, care-
ful voice. In the vast ugly glory of the
City Medical Office he seems almost
out of place, but he gives the impression
that it wouldn’t bother him very much
where he was.
No one would ever take John Hirsh-
man for a Labor Party wardheeler,
yet he is, in fact, an ALP branch
president. In the 1961 elections he con-
tested Wentworth —a blue-ribbon Liberal
seat —and polled just under 11,000 votes
against former Minister for Air Les
Bury a record for a Labor candidate
in that electorate. “I never expected to
win,” he said, and in fact he took time
off on election day to go for a swim at
Camp Cove, “I was talked into stand-
ing. But we needed as many votes as
possible even in areas where there was
no possibility of a Labor win. It boosted
the Senate vote and we got three Senat-
ors elected.”
As foundation member and chair-
man of the NSW Humanist Society, he
has drawn the fire of religious leaders
of all denominations. He stresses that
he is no militant atheist. “Our approach
to religion is tolerant and evolutionary.
In fact, I think the churches show signs
of becoming converted to a humanist
attitude.”
Hirshman came to Australia from
Vienna at the age of 17 just before the
war. “I was the product of very mixed
parentage,” he said, “so many nation-
alities I can hardly bear to think about
it.” With his father, mother and sister
he settled in Sydney and took a job in
a boot factory.
A scholarship
TTis father, a civil engineer, joined the
Department of Main Roads and
young John went to Sydney High School,
took his Leaving and won a scholarship
to university by 1941. He worked nights
in a pharmacy while he studied medicine
and graduated with second class honors
in 1946. “Things were speeded up a
little due to the war.” After a junior
residency in Royal Prince Alfred Hos-
pital he went to North Queensland for
further hospital experience and then
took a teaching fellowship at Sydney
University’s Department of Physiology
under the late Professor Cotton.
In 1947 a scholarship took him to
Britain’s Birmingham University, where
he worked in the department of social
medicine and first acquired an interest
in public health. While in Britain the
UN offered him a job with the Inter-
national Refugee Organisation and he
found himself a chief medical officer
in Germany. When, three and a half
years later, IRO was wound up he
returned to Sydney, went back to the
university and in 1952 won a Public
Health Diploma, two years later a dip-
loma in tropical medicine. After two
years’ private practice in the working-
class suburb of Darlinghurst, he was ap-
pointed Assistant City Medical Officer.
The ALP and the Sydney Trades and
Labor Council co-opted him as a mem-
ber of their Health and Social Services
Committee. He moved to Vaucluse and
became president of the Rose Bay ALP
branch in this predominantly well-to-do
area.
In 1960 he was one of a small group
of people who met and formed the
NSW Humanist Society. “Some of us
had been getting literature from the
British Humanist organisation that’s
Lord Russell and Julian Huxley’s
group,” he said. “The obvious political
links of the Rationalists made it impos-
sible to support them.”
World tour
A fter the 1961 elections Dr Hirshman
made a world tour during which
he studied overseas developments in
public health. He also took advantage
of his nine months trip to be in Oslo
for the International Humanist and
Ethical Unions Congress as the first
Australian delegate.
When I referred to recent criticism
of police he spoke of the “built-in hos-
tility” of the public which he asserted
was often quite unfair to the police
themselves. But he said there was “no
doubt in my mind some policemen are
unnecessarily rude and aggressive and
some of them have caused disquiet in
the public mind. While I believe these
are a small minority, it is important that
something be done to improve that
minority and ensure their actions don't
bring discredit on the force as a whole.
“On the matter of recruitment which
I raised in a letter to the Press, I agree
in recent years the intelligence level of
intake may have risen, but it still seems
to me that more stress is placed on
physical ability than on aptitude.” He
mused over that last word, “I think
aptitude is even more important than
educational level.” He said he considered
pay too low and “a police force should
attract the best elements of the com-
munity and enjoy appropriate con-
ditions.”
Hirshman chaired the first meeting
of 30 invited people who inaugurated a
Council for Civil Liberties. “The major-
ity was from the legal profession, in-
cluding a number of prominent QCs,”
he said. “The new organisation will
concern itself with many issues including
perhaps petty bureaucracy, aboriginal
rights, and the giving of general infor-
mation to the public regarding both
their legal rights and responsibilities.”
He stressed the non-political nature of
the council and that membership would
be of individuals and not representa-
tives of organisations.
The inward-turning idiot
A theme of Dr Hirshman is the right
and duty of the individual to take
an active part in public affairs. “Too
many people stand apart and criticise,”
he said. “The Greeks had a word for
such people, they called them ‘idiots.’ In
ancient Greek this meant one who turns
inwards or is concerned only with
himself.
“It’s a sad truth that our political
parties still appeal to the lowest common
denominator,” he added, “this is so in
the ALP where education is still re-
garded with some suspicion. There are
signs of a change and in Britain this
has completely gone.”
He believes “everybody should take
part in political activity. By that I don’t
necessarily mean they should join a
political party, but I do think too few
people belong to the major political
parties and this results in their not rep-
resenting broad public opinion. People
should speak up more. I know it’s less
worrying to go to the beach or the races.
Getting involved in politics can mean
getting involved in difficulties or making
enemies, but this must be accepted.”
Young people’s rebelliousness was en-
couraging. “They fully realise the older
generations have made a mess of things
and don’t practise what they preach,”
he said. “But it’s up to us to channel
this rebellion into constructive channels.”
As a father of five children he has
definite ideas on upbringing and this
includes not being too dogmatic. “Al-
though perhaps it is almost impossible
to avoid some bias,” he said. “I began
sex education around the age of three
the best age, because then attitudes
are beginning to be formed. Also at this
age an emotion-laden fact can be ac-
cepted with no emotional involvement.”
When a colleague dropped in to say
goodnight I realised it was late. “You
can simply say I have no political am-
bitions,” Dr Hirshman added. “If I
ever got elected to Parliament I doubt
whether I would be able to hold back
on any unpopular subject just to be
politically acceptable. Oh, and say I’m
a lover of Siamese cats, a governing
member of the RSPCA, make nearly
all my own furniture and read science
fiction.”

OUT AND ABOUT
Sculpture’s Glorious Dawn
Spiritually useful typewriters
By JAN SMITH
IF from religious fervor or plain
necessity, you ever tried beating
swords into ploughshares, the result
could well be like one of Robert Klip-
pel’s more arresting pieces of sculpture.
No artist likes mundane comparisons,
but in a country where sculpture largely
means statues of Queen Victoria and
Anzac memorials, it seems fair to try
a little explanation.
Junk sculpture is nothing new
Picasso was doing it in 1934 but
neither is it a pleasant weekend hobby
like building the Sydney Harbor Bridge
out of bottle tops. Klippel is a genuine
trained sculptor, well versed in ortho-
dox materials and as capable as the
next man of whipping up a set of
nymphs and shepherds. His particular
genius is not so much skill as imagina-
tion and a splendid sense of timing.
No one is more aware than Robert
Klippel that sculpture has a long way
to go before it catches up with paint-
ing as a living-room conversation piece.
We are sophisticated enough to laugh
at the “Stag at Bay,” but somehow
we haven’t developed a stock joke about
19th-century sculpture.
But Mr Frank McDonald, who ar-
ranged Klippel’s exhibition at the Terry
Clune Galleries, says sculpture’s glorious
age is dawning. Like paintings, which
in an affluent society become loved first
as status symbols, then for their own
sakes, domestic sculpture is about to be
very, very in.
Klippel’s first one-man junk sculpture
exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries
last December was a test. Would Aus-
tralia prove an economic market for
domestic, as opposed to architectural,
sculpture? Informed of the mutterings
that go on with most major commissions,
like Canberra’s Ethos and Sydney Tech’s
Graphic Arts group, Klippel may well
have wondered. He stayed in New York,
sent out the sculpture and found him-
self famous in his own country.
Critics talked about exceptional
creative vitality and quivering nervous
energy. His old friend James Gleeson,
observing Klippel’s way with dead en-
gines and derelict typewriters, declared
they had been made “spiritually useful.”
Prices on some pieces were carefully
scaled down from the American origin-
als to counteract possible buyer resist-
ance (from 400 dollars to 45 guineas,
in one case) but the 19 pieces were all
sold, a big change from an earlier year
when Klippel’s yearly income from
sculpture here was 25 guineas from one
lone sale.
Klippel took up junk in 1960, and
although he says it has no particular
significance or message, it is tempting
to see his passion for useless things as
a protest against planned obsolescence.
Whatever it is, New York, with its fer-
tile dump yards, is an excellent environ-
ment and Robert Klippel has adapted
to it magnificently. Steel rods, sheet
steel, typewriters and mechanical in-
nards are all grist to his soldering iron,
which joins them into creations rang-
ing from tiny horselike figures made
from old typewriter keys to massive
wallpieces six feet high.
Robert Klippel was born in Potts
Point, Sydney, to a family entrenched
in the garment trade. His brother David
is a director of Klipper ties and more
recently of the Lovable Bra company.
Then, as now, Klippel doesn’t want to
talk about it. “The only one who really
encouraged me was my mother,” he
said wistfully. “You know how mothers
usually stick by their sons.”
Even a mother might have felt qualms
about a sculpture-minded son in the cul-
tural wilderness of the war and postwar
years. With the war finished, Klippel’s
usefulness as a model maker for the
Navy’s Woolloomooloo Gunnery Instruc-
tion Centre was over. His earlier passion
for making replicas of 17th-century ship
figureheads was financially hopeless.
With a three years art course at Tech
behind him (two years at night while
in the Navy, one year full-time) Klippel
set out for the Slade School. By this
time he was interested in the relationship
between machines and organic forms,
and by 1947 he had gone non-figurative.
His first exhibition, held with James
Gleeson at the London Gallery, fea-
tured wood, plaster and bronze. From
1948-50 he worked in Paris and in
1950 returned to Sydney, sharing an
exhibition with Ralph Balsom at the
Macquarie Galleries in 1952.
Sculpture as a career was still im-
possible so Klippel went selling from
door to door (he wouldn't say what)
and in 1957 went to New York. For
15 months, in a Greenwich Village
studio, he worked towards his first big
success, an exhibition at the Palma Gal-
leries in 1958.
Then came four years’ teaching at a
private art school in Minneapolis.
About this time press cuttings mention
a “vivacious American wife Nina,” but

The newsprint cost almost what we sold the
paper for. And paper is the least cost of news.
But the value of a newspaper lies in other things.
In comment and criticism that prompts political
awareness of public reaction.
In the presentation of the spirit, interests and
needs of the community.
In the lift and laughter of a light side shown.
Just what did he
pay those pennies for?
In a sharp reflection of things perhaps other-
wise unseen.
Forty-five to the inch, fourteen inches to the
column, words are moulded into meaning by
informed, responsible people feeling the pulse
of progress and the reins of regress and who
report both for the better information of us all.
He just paid pennies. For the present tense.
And the future indicative. The Daily Mirror.

this again is not for discussion. Any-
thing Klippel has to say he says in
sculpture.
But Robert Klippel is not at all aloof
or difficult. Of medium height, with
dark hair and big brown eyes, he is at
once serious and friendly. My husband,
meeting him by chance in the Chevron
one night, didn’t think he looked like
a sculptor. Such is their rarity. In 1961,
who would have thought John Glenn
looked like an astronaut?
Serling in the Hornet’s Nest
The struggle for power on TV
By CHARLES HIGHAM
uT HAD no what a hornet’s nest
I had stirred up!” The speaker was
Rod Serling, executive producer
of “Twilight Zone” and possibly the
most celebrated of all American TV
dramatists (“Patterns”, “Requiem for
a Heavyweight”) who, in an act of
remarkable acumen, has been imported
by the ABC for a series of lectures to
its resident writers. The hornet’s nest
he was referring to is the one which in-
variably buzzes and whirls about when
visiting celebrities (directors, producers,
writers) rashly reveal that, in addition
to giving us the benefit of their wisdom,
they are looking for talent (actors,
writers).
All morning Mr Serling had been
besieged as English film director Jack
Lee had been two weeks before, and
no doubt Joseph I*:>sey and Dirk
Bogarde will be when they arrive in
November to film Kenneth Cook’s “Wake
In Fright”.
Serling is a small, wiry man with a
deeply tanned, humorous face, a man-
ner brisk but not unwary, and a volatile
way of speaking that recalls the pungent
flavor of his better scripts. In a few
brief sentences, he revealed himself as
a civilised radical, a pro-Negro, enlight-
ened man of excellent taste, the kind of
American who makes the bleat of anti-
Americanism even more intolerable
than it already is. Serling is a fledgling
of the hard-bitten school of American
radio, but scarcely shows it save in his
machine-tooled writing technique.
Since breaking into television in a
big way close on a decade ago, he has
developed a brand of hard-driving melo-
drama in which two personalities, usually,
are pitted together in a desperate strug-
gle for power; a pessimist by nature,
Serling has shown the powerful destroy-
ing the weak, as in his “Patterns”, in
which an idealistic young businessman
is hired to supplant a failing company
executive by the driving and unscrupulous
president; at the end of the film the
newcomer is absorbed by the “system”,
no doubt to be destroyed himself in a
few years’ time.
“The Wall Street Journal,” Serling told
me, bitterly attacked that one, and he
was severely reproved by business
organisations. I asked him if official
pressures had often been brought to bear
on him. “Oh yes, often,” he said. “There
are always pressures. No, I don’t think
there will ever be freedom, complete
freedom, for the writer in television.
“I couldn’t write a play about the
Negro issue and hope to have it pro-
duced on television. The whole subject
is so hot you can’t imagine the way
it affects people. No sponsor would
handle it. Write a Broadway play about
it? Well, no, I don’t think that’s the way
to handle it. I agree television is the
right medium for it but one can't get
it across.”
He added that, even assuming a con-
troversial play did get through all the
obstacles of obstinate executives, spon-
sors and so on, the public wouldn't like
it. There might be some hope of making
a film on this and other pressing issues.
But so far his career as a film-writer
had given him little scope. “M-G-M hired
me, but then they didn’t know what to
do with me. They’re nervous of writers.
For years they gave me nothing to do.
Pictures in which the most important
character was a horse. But recently I’ve
done a script for ‘Seven Days in May’,
about the election of a new president, for
John Frankenheimer. That will be a
good picture, I think.
“The writer today has much more
power in Hollywood. There was a time
when the studio bosses were illiterate
is a kind way of putting it. There are
still a few left men like Jack Warner
men of the old school. But today the
writer is given freedom to write as he
chooses.
“Television has been more than 90
per cent produced on the West Coast for
several years now. The creative atmos-
phere is just as stimulating as New York.
The only difference is my children catch
colds less often. There are a great many
talented people in Hollywood. And the
writer is getting more and more power.
I see a day when he will have equal
power with the director,” Rod Serling
looked quietly determined. “I am waiting
for that day.”

Midday in Mareeba
A town built on tobacco
By V. HELPS
From Cairns the road inland curves
between endless fields of cane, the
tall luscious green shoots thrust
high into the humid sunshine. Nearby
a field burns steadily, the flames strip-
ping the leaves to facilitate cutting. The
smoke curling lazily into the clear sky,
drifting into a solitary cloud that hovers
above the towering mountain ranges
where it is joined by other clouds, grey
and heavy with moisture. The road
climbs towards the clouds, twisting and
turning and hugging the cliff closely with
every now and then a glimpse through
tangled forest of flat brown and green
fields, a yellow sickle of beach bordering
calm sea of marbled green in the shallows
and deep blue where sea and horizon
meet.
Now magically it is cool and damp as
the road enters the forest. You are
haunted by the fragrant memories of an
English wood, pungent and bracken-
filled, yet this wood differs with tropical
giant tree-ferns, massive towering trunks
softened by moss where orchids and
bright parasites grow.
Again the scene changes. This is
tobacco country, colorless and seemingly
unproductive. The land broadens out
and here and there farms creep into view,
cleared fields bordered by gums, a house
on stilts stands sentry beside barns and
farm buildings, mostly neglected and un-
cared for. Occasionally one notices a
new home brightly painted, set in a patch
of emerald green lawn and shaded by
brilliant tropical trees but then the
adjoining farm will be of brown fibro,
unpainted, and beneath the stilts a garden
of weeds thrives.
So many farms appear poverty-stricken,
yet outside the shack stands a long new
car, preferably American. You will find
the family have recently taken a trip to
Europe, yet the home is that of a poor
man. In the fields of young tobacco the
family can be seen “chipping” between
the rows; elderly women in black clothes
and big hats, men in their inevitable blue
singlets and shorts, and children too, all
working together beneath the blazing sun
with an occasional break for “smoko”
beneath a tree, tea and a bun then back
to work.
Every field for miles is alive with
activity; a tractor ploughing or smoothing
before fertilising, the dust rising high in
the clear air; overhead sprays catching
the sunlight as the young plants drink the
welcome moisture; in other fields flood
irrigation is in process, a sunburned youth
opens each curling, curving, contoured
stream and watches the water cool and
drench each thirsty plant.
There are approximately 1800 farmers
and share-farmers growing tobacco in a
radius of 30 miles of Mareeba. The
surge of finance and growth in population
is reflected in the town. Where other
tableland towns remain comparatively
unchanged, Mareeba is all a-bustle.
Lorries and trucks laden with logs surge
into the saw mill which stands an eye-
sore at the entrance to Mareeba; huge
double trailers carry cattle to and from
the saleyards held nearby; fuel tankers
thunder through the streets. The shriek
of a train whistle announces the arrival
of a rail-car from Cairns. There are new
cars everywhere and the empty allotments
next to the garages overflow with old cars
for sale while their owners glide past in
more expensive achievements, often
bought before the crop is sold. The
shops are well stocked and many are
signposted in Italian as well as English,
but in between the new buildings stand
defiantly the old shops, with small win-
dows and fly-stained notices, frilly edged
canopies over the pavements and un-
swept floors.
main street is the shopping area
and the shops face a central strip of
lawn shaded by gigantic wild fig trees and
a few mangoes beneath which on circular
benches sit, sprawl and sleep the weary
of this world. Mothers with lined faces
and over-energetic babies; elderly men
with braces and hot feet; aboriginals with
rubbery features and wild-haired child-
ren, young men with long side-burns in
search of seasonal work all the wait-
ing ones retire to the cool shade beneath
the trees and in the evenings the chatter
of a million brown Indian minah birds
with their golden eyes and beaks tell the
world they are ready for bed.
There is a brick Post Office, cool and
airy, and a cinema with the hardest seats
upstairs and canvas deck-chairs with a
communal back downstairs the style
is peculiar to Queensland. The Fire
Brigade is next to the Post Office. These
hard workers are called out three to four
times a day in the curing season. When
the siren howls a hundred doors and
windows are thrust open and eager eyes
watch as the fire engine screams down
the street, picking up its volunteers en
route, and bumps along to some farm
where a hysterical Italian or a sardonic
Australian will survey his smouldering
tobacco in either despair or with a shrug
of the shoulders perhaps it is well
insured!
The Barron River borders Mareeba on
one side to be joined by Granite Creek
on the other. Here children swim and
boat and fish and tumble in the shallow
rapids that churn the water as it ap-
proaches the deep man-made pool with
a high board known as “The Brewery
Hole” (the remains of the old brewery
on the hill nearby destroy any claim this
spot might have to beauty).
I park my car for a while, under the
towering trees in the centre, and watch
Mareeba go by. It is nearly midday on
a hot and sultry morning, the rains are
due and all Mareeba awaits the first few
drops.
Outside one of the public bars three
men slouch on a dirty bench they
have reached the end of the road, a com-
bination of too many beers and the in-
tense heat which smothers the town as

the relieving storm clouds grumble and
blacken over the hills on the horizon.
They sit in a stupor the wind whisks
an empty ice-cream carton from the
gutter and blows it beneath the bench
and one of the men kicks it. He is
dressed in tiny blue shorts and singlet,
his hairy legs end in stubby toes clad in
rubber sandals he looks out blearily
with a half-closed, jaundiced eye the
sun is so bright.
One of his companions is a smart boy
long sideburns and a Tony Curtis top-
knot; he blinks wearily as he scratches
his upper arm which, like his chest, is
bare and brown he wears swimming
shorts decorated with green fish, and no
shoes. The third man is different again,
his sleeveless shirt gives him a somewhat
effeminate air which is quickly dispelled
by his stubbly chin, gangling arms and
legs which spread far into the street. He
is blissfully unaware of his surroundings
his chin droops and he is asleep.
People pass and look some with
amusement, some with intolerance,
children wide-eyed and giggly. The trio
are full of beer and dreams of days gone
by, in Italy perhaps, or Greece, Spain,
Yugoslavia.
Poverty and dirt
An aboriginal with snowy white hair
greets a stockman. There are a num-
ber of aborigines in this area, most of
them stockmen from the outlying cattle
stations, and they seem well-off. I noticed
several families taking a taxi to their
homes outside Mareeba, but these, to my
surprise, were appallingly filthy, an air
of poverty and dirt surrounded the
shacks, and the small children were
dressed in rags and played in the dust.
Two very tall, fair men with sallow
skins go into one of the supermarkets.
I hear them talking in a foreign tongue.
They could be Dutchmen, or more likely
Yugoslavs. I watch them through the
plate-glass window as they push a trolley
round collecting groceries. An argument
ensues should they buy this brand or
that? It is settled with an irritable shrug
and now they leave the shop. Perhaps
when they have made some money with
their tobacco they will send for a wife
or two to do the shopping for them
and buy a new car. The one they
climb into sags and groans and looks as
if it might collapse any minute.
A short figure stands on the pavement
facing me; he lights a cigarette from an
expensive-looking case with a lighter and
inhales deeplv. He is thick-set with
colossal shoulders. One might unkindly
suspect padding in his immaculate pais-
ley shirt with the silver pin-stripe running
through it, but perhaps he is simply very
muscular. His trousers are well cut and
slender, as are his shoes. His hair-style
defies description. It is black and very
long at the back yet has been recently
cut straight across in the latest style. The
sides are oiled and slicked back to meet
centrally in a carefully combed join.
His complexion is dark and his teeth very
white. He watches a young girl in a
figure-touching shift with swinging tas-
sels. She tosses her auburn pony-tail as
she passes but does not give him even
so much as a glance. In disgust he flicks
the cigarette into the gutter and eases
himself into the very low, sleek car parked
nearby. The engine purrs and away he
swerves. The wind catches his carefully
combed hair and blows it about like a
girl’s. He is probably a cane-cutter from
the coast, hence the massive muscles.
He may have several thousand pounds to
play with and has come to Mareeba to
test the pulse of the grading season which
is to come he will make good money
up here as well.
Once again my attention is drawn to
the open door of the bar where through
the haze of smoke and beer fumes steps
a real Australian stockman into the swel-
tering street. He is immensely tall, his
odd black, high-heeled riding boots adding
further inches to his towering frame. He
is also bandy, his legs in tight khaki
trousers curve outwards like a bow and
spurs clink as he walks. His hat has
seen the smoke of many fires and he
wears it at rakish angle over a long brown
sun-lined face. He grins at his com-
panion, showing broken teeth. The
second man is a complete parody of the
true stockman. His khaki jodhpurs shine
with newness, ending in ankles so tight
he can hardly walk; he wears a pale blue
silk shirt with numerous pleats and tucks
down the centre back like some nine-
teenth-century fop, and a scarf around
his neck.
It is time to go now and I join the
busy traffic leaving Mareeba I
pass one of the parks for children, swings
and see-saws going at full tilt. I noticed
in one of the parks a little brightly-
painted engine for the children to play
on, one of the small-gauge engines which
haul sugar cane along the coast a
delightful idea.
I follow the road to Atherton and the
higher tableland towns it climbs
gradually and the air becomes noticeably
cooler as I approach the steep ascent
known as the “jump-up'’. There I stop
and admire the magnificent far view of
hills of every shade and hue of mauve,
blue and grey, and in the centre the vast
fiattish basin which is Mareeba and the
surrounding tobacco farms. It looks
hot down there, and it is.

Qantas-flown samples, supplies and spares ensure
successful overseas sales for Australian manufacturer
The Commonwealth Industrial Gases Limited knows that to show samples overseas is to increase sales, a
practice that could be of benefit to any exporter. The company’s ‘sample salesmen’ go everywhere with
its demonstrators by Qantas. For example, Qantas-flown C.I.G. samples demonstrated in Japan so

Limited Release For Connoisseurs
Special Vintage Wines
From The Hunter River Valley
As every wine lover knows, the best vintage wines come from vines with a very
low yield. These grapes are very costly to produce and are seldom available
except in small quantities and at high prices. Lindemans can supply while the
limited supplies last—some very rare vintage wines at prices which, by inter-
national vintage wine standards, are extremely low.
1962 VINTAGE RIESLING LINDEMANS’ BIN 1930
A very soft, fruity, pungent Riesling from Lindemans’ Ben Ean Vineyard, similar
in style to a German “Auslese” Riesling, from specially selected grapes picked
late. WINNER OF MANY PRIZES INCLUDING GOLD MEDAL AND
SPECIAL TROPHY for the Best Dry Whitt; Wine of the 1963 Royal Easter Show.
1959 VINTAGE CLARET LINDEMANS’ BIN 1930
A beautiful “Ben Ean” Claret rqfvde from Red Hermitage grapes from Lindemans’
“Ben Ean” Vineyard. Hunter River Valley, N.S.W. Light, well flavoured and
soft. Awarded 3rd PRIZE «Tt the 1960 Brisbane Show as a 2-year-old claret.

Wines to Buy
Some notable Show releases
By CELLARMASTER
Yearly we read, are told, see adver-
tised, the wine awards at the various
Shows, and the industry places much
significance upon them. Yet how often
one hears the complaint of members of
the purchasing public (after all, the most
important figure m the whole business),
“You can’t buy Show wines, they keep
them for themselves.”
There is some truth in this. The maker
hopes, each vintage, that his efforts will
be rewarded with wines of quality that
he may show He carefully selects the
best, making sure that the required
minimum amount is on hand. If the wine
does well, he may keep it for other
future shows, and if the initial quantity
was small anyway this means he cannot
release any until he decides to stop show-
ing it.
Finally, full of honors, the wine is
retired from the competitive arena. It
may be kept by the maker for his own
Use and for sale at the cellar door to
selected friends; it may be used for pro-
motional purposes: or it may be released
through agents and thence retail outlets
for general sale.
Some Show releases recently seen:
McWilliams 1952 Stephen Hermitage:
A good year in the Hunter and a good
result. Wine is a living thing, and this
is an “up and down” wine that varies in
structure and taste. But a privilege to
drink, since it is of the older, fuller,
style of Hunter reds. Good balance and
flavor.
Glenloth 1957 Cabernet: If this wine
wasn’t show'n it should have been. Faith-
ful Cabernet character, with high tannin
finish. Could be drunk now but will
improve for years.
Great Western L.l & 4 Chablis 1955:
A classic white wine. Delightful bouquet;
rich, full flavor: soft, round finish; a little
out of style at this stage of maturation.
Colin Preece, the maker, says this is the
best white wine in Australia and he is a
man without bias.
Rogue Homme Coonawarra Cabernet
1959: From the red loam of this area
comes a great wine of the true Bordeaux
mould. Perfect Cabernet character with
truly fragrant nose, delicate flavor and
true claret finish. Will improve for years
to come.
There was never very much of these
wines, so there is little to go around.
However, this is not always the pattern
with Show wines. Lindemans seem con-
sistently to put out great Hunter whites
that are available as they are winning
prizes. The 1760 riesling of 1961 is an
obvious example that won a top Show
award and yet was on sale at the same
time.
And often there are wines freely
available that develop so well that the
oeno-archy decides to withdraw them
from public sale to show them The
Thomas Hardy 894 1955 burgund> is a
case in point. I developed quite an
appreciation for this beautiful wine and
was thinking of laying down some when
it vanished. It turned up shortly after on
the judges’ tables and has since won
several medals, including three or four
golds. Only after all this fame will it be
briefly available and then probably at
twice the price. There is a lesson.
While we are on the subject of Shows,
a small protest. I do wish some of the
major companies would stop advertising
commercial wines in conjunction with
Show trophies won by other wines. I
know the inference is that they are made
by the same people and must therefore
be as good. And they are good. But
people get annoyed when they learn that
the sweet sherry or dry red advertised
against a sea of shining pots has little or
no Show history. This can do nothing
but harm the industry.
Finally, a rave. Recently I had the
pleasure of tasting one of the best Aus-
tralian wines I have ever tried, a Penfolds
1955 Cabernet Mataro made at Auldana.
An experiment, the makers are out of
stock, but should you ever come across
this privately, please let me know. It
would be worth travelling a long way to
taste again.

SCIENCE
Congenital Abnormalities
After the thalidomide babies
The resurgence of interest in congeni-
tal abnormalities has undoubtedly
been inspired by the thalidomide
tragedy, but the subject is one that has
fascinated mankind from the earliest
days, and has never been far from the
minds of thoughtful doctors and research
workers during recent decades,
The solution of the problem is not yet
in sight, but a survey of the current evi-
dence provides ample proof that steady,
if slow, progress is being achieved.
The precise incidence of congenital
abnormalities is hard to come by as
hitherto they have not been notifiable.
Various investigations, however, have
been carried out in different parts of the
world, and the following are some of the
findings, given as the incidence of con-
genital abnormalities per thousand live
births: 17.3 in Birmingham, 15 in
Chicago, 11.2 in Sweden, 12.2 in Japan,
and 8.5 in Kampala.
The death-rate from such abnormalities
is much better documented, and the
figures here indicate why the problem is
assuming increasing importance at the
present day. Since the turn of the cen-
tury the infant death-rate in England and
Wales from congenital abnormalities has
remained at around four to five per
thousand live births, but in the same
period the total infant mortality has fallen
from 130 to 20 per thousand live births.
In other words, whereas 60 years ago
congenital abnormalities were responsible
for only about one infant death in 30,
today they are responsible for one in
four or one in five.
So far as causation is concerned, the
position is still complex and confused,
but work carried out in recent years has
gone a long way towards clarifying the
picture. Basically there are two factors
which are responsible for the development
of an individual from the moment of
conception genetic and environmental
and if either one or the other, or both,
of these is abnormal, the result may be
a congenital abnormality.
From the preventive point of view
there is relatively little we can do about
the genes at the moment, apart from
what is known as genetic counselling.
That is, advising parents, or prospective
parents, what the chances are of their hav-
ing congenitally abnormal children. From
the therapeutic angle, however, interest-
ing new possibilities are opening up. This
is particularly the case in the group of
abnormalities known as “inborn errors
of metabolism”. These disorders arise
as a result of defective formation of one
or more specific enzymes. An enzyme
is a chemical ferment produced by living
cells, and the metabolism of the body is
controlled by an intricate mosaic of these,
all under genetic control.
It is in the control of the environmental
factors, however, that lies the greatest
hope of preventing congenital abnor-
malities. In the words of one of the
participants in a Ciba Foundation Sym-
posium on the subject, held in 1960,
there is a “great body of experimentation
which indicates that we are just at the
beginning of a combined laboratory,
clinical, and epidemiological ‘break-
through’ which promises to reduce the
occurrence of congenital anomalies sig-
nificantly in the foreseeable future”.
(“The Times,” London.)


OVERSEAS
DENNING
The man whom nobody knew ...
A PROFILE
There are qualities in Lord Den-
ning’s report which some of his
fellow-judges could have rivalled:
its hard, close analysis, its excellent, crisp
English, even its occasional flash of
human sympathy. But none could have
excelled the characteristically forthright
phrase in which Lord Denning revealed
his basic philosophy:
“As a judge, I put justice first.”
Not all judges would accept the
maxim. Denning himself has often com-
plained that judges are too much con-
cerned with law and not enough with
justice. He once wrote: “I have often
heard judges say: ‘We are only con-
cerned with what the law is, not with
what it ought to be,’ and he went on
to challenge this “facile assumption.”
Facile or not, it represents the domi-
nant tradition of a conservative profes-
sion. Judges tend, when they consider
cases, to follow precedent strictly, and
when they survey statutes, interpret them
literally. Denning has challenged, some-
times with asperity, both these guiding
rules.
But his unorthodoxy goes far deeper
than this. Denning gives the appearance
of deciding first what the just result of
a case would be, and then uses or cir-
cumvents precedents with genial ruthless-
ness to achieve this. Most judges take the
law as they find it and let the result follow
from it. After all, can you ever tell what
justice really requires?
It is through this cavalier attitude
towards the established practices of his
profession that Denning has become an
intensely controversial figure: a hero to
many academic lawyers and students,
but. regarded with affectionate anxiety by
many of his brothers on the Bench.
He has earned his distinction as a
great, innovating, reforming judge. Yet
so closed and so specialised is the legal
world in which he has always moved that
his true reputation has not become
widely known.
Even now, it has taken this summer’s
scandal to turn him into a public figure:
the best-selling judge for whom the
Stationery Office opens its doors at one
in the morning, the man who has held
in his hands the fate of Mr Macmillan’s
Government.
And it has been left to Miss Mandy
Rice-Davies to bring home to the public
what every barrister who ever appeared
before him knew already: that he is
“quite the nicest” judge. Charming, infi-
nitely courteous, always anxious to help:
this is how Tom Denning has alwayi
been known at the Bar.
Tall and thin, neat and unobtrusive in
his dress, sociable enough but not in the
dining-club, old-boy reunion, City ban-
quet sense, he has always been a bit of a
lone wolf, incredibly hard-working, ruth-
lessly honest the whitest lie pains him
dissenting because it is in his nature
and his upbringing to bear witness, to
keep faith, to do duty, a little proud in
his independence.
His father was a small draper; both
parents were strict and sober and brought
up their children in their fashion. It
was a close-knit family with a strong
local loyalty. Even today, he has not lost
the Hampshire burr of his youth and it
is surely significant that this summer, now
64, Baron Denning and Master of the
Rolls, he should have returned to live in
the same small town of Whitchurch,
where he was born.
There is an air of Samuel Smiles self-
help about his record and it comes out
sometimes in evangelical passages: “We
have already strayed too far from the
faith of our fathers. Let us return to it,
for it is the only thing that can save us.”
From his background, too, Denning
derives his notion of justice. Just as judges
in the past, from good schools and com-
fortable homes, have inevitably reflected
their background in their legal decisions,
so his own easy equation of law and
morals stems from his upbringing.
Denning went to his village school,
then to grammar school in Andover.
From there he won a scholarship to
Oxford in the middle of the First World
War and read mathematics. After an
interval in the Army he went back and
took his mathematics finals.
Then, after teaching for a year at Win-
chester, he returned to Oxford, read law
in eight months and took his third first
in a row and won the Eldon, the premier
legal scholarship.
This was a distinguished record, and
there is no doubt that Denning has a
first-class mind. But he is not an “intel-
lectual.” His judgments reveal an exten-
sive, detailed knowledge of legal history
and great dexterity, not to say sleight of
hand, in marshalling cases to achieve the
result he wants and sidestepping others
which lie in his path. But there is noth-
ing in them of, say, Lord Devlin’s philo-
sophical gifts.
With Denning it is the result which
counts. His approach is direct, down to
earth, dogmatic. And it is justice he is
after. But what is justice? If a judge
will not follow precedents or Parlia-
ment, where does he look for guidance?
Is it each judge for himself?
Sometimes, it seems, Denning does
not appreciate the difficulty he is in.
Justice, he suggests, is eternal, the pro-
duct not of man’s intellect but of his

spirit. The nearest to a definition he will
hazard is that it is what “the right-
minded members of the community
those who - have the right spirit within
them believe to be fair.”
The judge background and all
represents those “right-minded” men and
women, and Denning is very conscious
of his high responsibility. “If we seek
truth and justice, we cannot find it by
argument and debate, nor by reading
and thinking, but only by the mainten-
ance of true religion and virtue.”
None of this was apparent during his
early years at the Bar. He built up a
biggish practice, doing circuit work in
the West Country and rather more com-
mon law work in London. He married
twice his first wife, a parson’s daugh-
ter, died early in the last war.
At the age of 45, he went on the
Bench. He did not shine as a trial judge
on circuit. For all his charm, there is
a remoteness from the ways of the world
which never fitted him for criminal
work. It was only after his promotion
to the Court of Appeal in 1948 that his
judgments began to drop, one by one,
like stones into the placid—some would
say stagnant pool of the law.
Some people deny Denning’s claim to
be a radical, saying that his reforms are
all in what they call lawyer’s law. If this
means that there is something arid in
them, it is unfair criticism. In each case
he has been concerned to right wrongs
and correct abuses which press on
people.
What is true is that he is out to re-
form the law and not society. Using his
inner light, his own special brand of
truth-detector, he can divine precisely
enough what “right-minded” members of
the community would believe to be fair
in legal problems. But where social ques-
tions are concerned, he appears to fall
back on the prejudices he shares with
the common man. Thus he opposes the
abolition of capital punishment. He is
against the Wolfenden Committee re-
commendations on homosexuality, jus-
tifying this by observing reasonably
enough that the law must command the
respect of the people, that right-minded
men can lead, but not bully, public
opinion. But there is a confusion here,
which involves him sometimes in sub-
jective judgments.
Denning is a great supporter of tradi-
tional values. He equates adultery with
theft and urges public opinion to con-
demn it. Sterilisation, he says, is “degra-
ding to the man himself, injurious to the
public interest and opens the way to
licentiousness.”
It is lay preaching of this sort which
sometimes leads him to confuse right
thinking with emotion and has per-
haps led people to expect that his report
would show traces of a puritanical atti-
tude towards the kind of conduct he was
investigating. This overlooked the fact
that most of his moralising has been
done outside the courts and that the re-
port was a judicial exercise.
Denning went to the House of Lords
in 1957. But he did not like it: there was
not enough opportunity for helping to
improve the law. So his appointment last
year as Master of the Rolls, which in-
volves the Presidency of the Court of
Appeal, must have pleased him. Here he
will have the opportunity of leaving his
personal impression on the law. And, as
he has pointed out with a certain
roguishness, sitting there with only two
other judges, the chances of achieving
justice are one in three, (ofns.)

Tito’s Seven
Nations
“ Yugoslavia ” is only a dream
By EMERY BARCS
Faint echoes of Yugoslavia’s persis-
tent nationality troubles reached
Australia recently when Tito's
secret political police, the UDB, arrested
nine young Croats who had allegedly
returned home from their Australian
refuge to start a “terrorist campaign”.
The nine men, Belgrade charged, had
been trained in Australia and in West
Germany.
Belgrade, it is true, sees a real or
potential terrorist in every Yugoslav
political escapee, refugee, or self-exile.
Memories of the inter-war period, for
example, when opponents of the Yugo-
slav royal dictatorship were trained in
the art of terrorism in Italy, Hungary
and the Soviet Union are very much
alive. After all, King Alexander was
assassinated in Marseilles in 1934 by a
Macedonian who had learned the art of
regicide in a special camp in Jankapuszta,
Hungary. And 70-years-old President
Tito, who in his younger years as a bud-
ding Communist learned similar arts in
his country’s Red underground, knows
enough of the business to be weary of
it.
Tito’s good luck is that the various
Yugoslav groups in exile abroad have
as little in common with each other as
the different components of the under-
ground opposition have in common at
home. Attempts have been made to unite
these ‘ various forces, but the results
haven't been very successful.
Yugoslavia meaning the Country of
the Southern Slavs is the name of an
artificial country created after World War
I from the Kingdoms of Serbia and
Montenegro and from fragments of the
defunct Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.
It owes its establishment to the success-
ful lobbying of Great-Serb politicians at
the Paris peace conferences in 1918 and
1919 whose Big Three President Wil-
son, Lloyd George and Clemenceau
were abysmally ignorant of the real
problems of the area.
As Vladko Macek, former leader of
the Croatian Peasant Party (now in exile
in the US) shows in his recent auto-
biography, In Struggle for Freedom, that
practically all of the peoples who were
forced into Yugoslavia feared Serb
hegemony and oppression. Between 1918
and the Nazi invasion in 1941 Yugoslavia
was ruled by a Serb royal dictatorship
which constantly struggled against the
non-Serbs’ minimum demands of com-
plete autonomy or maximum aims of

secession and independence. In more sub-
dued forms the same struggle has con-
tinued under Tito’s Communist dictator-
ship.
Tito—a Croat himself—was well aware
of the explosive force of national par-
ticularism in Yugoslavia when, after
defeating the nationalist wing of the anti-
Nazi resistance, he seized power in 1945.
To overcome the problem he established
a Federal Republic consisting of seven
Autonomous Republics and two Auto-
nomous Regions, and on top of them a
Federal Government headed by a Presi-
dent, two Vice-Presidents, and a Federal
Parliament.
According to the census of 1961 Yugo-
slavia had some 18 million inhabitants.
Of these (in round figures) 7.1 million
declared themselves to be Serbs, 4 million
Croats, 1.5 million Slovenes, 1 million
“Yugoslavs”, 0.9 million Macedonians,
0.8 million Albanians, 0.5 million Mon-
tenegrins and Hungarians each, and 0.3
million Turks. In addition there were
100,000 Gipsies, 100,000 Slovaks, 60,000
Bulgars, 60,000 Germans, 50,000
Ukrainians and White Russians, 40,000
Italians, 40,000 Rumanians, 30,000
Czechs and 10,000 Russians.
The populations of the seven Auto-
nomous Republics were as follows: Ser-
bia 4.1 million, Croatia 3.8 million,
Bosnia - Herzegovina 2.6 million,
Slovenia 1.4 million, Macedonia 1.2 mil-
lion, Montenegro 0.4 million. The Auto-
nomous Region of the Voivodina (with
a strong Hungarian minority) had 1.7
million and (largely Albanian) Kossovo-
Metohija 0.7 million people.
As these figures show, despite Tito’s
efforts to contain national and ethnic
groups in autonomous Republics and
Regions, he hasn’t succeeded in doing so
anywhere. Political and ethnic bound-
aries nowhere match, and Communism
has not lessened ancient national and
religious antagonisms. Less than six per
cent of the people have embraced “Yugo-
slav” nationality. Yugoslavia is still an
artificial State and no real nation.
While these divisions facilitate the
Tito regime’s struggle against the emigre
opposition groups and the atomised local
undergrounds, they frustrate the Presi-
dent's dream of creating a real nation
a people determined to live, work and if
necessary fight together.
Tito’s ambition which commands
respect is to build such a nation.
Although he is a Croat, the westward-
looking, strongly Roman Catholic Croats
can’t hope for any special favors from
him. He is careful to pick his closest
collaborators not only on the basis of
ability but also on the grounds of balance
between nationalities. One of his Vice-
Presidents, Edward Kardelj, is a Slovene,
the other, Aleksandar Rankovich, is a
Serb. The same balance is being kept in
the leadership of the League of Yugo-
slav Communists which is the official
name of the Yugoslav Communist Party.
As long as Tito remains at his post —
he was recently elected President for life
there is a good chance that he will
keep Yugoslavia together. For he is his
country’s supreme arbiter with a very
realistic appreciation of the explosive
power of nationalistic antagonisms in a
multi-national State. And he has proved
time and again that however much lip-
service he might pay to the “organic force
of Socialism which transcends national
divisions,” in practice the unifying force
which he tries to apply is not so much
Socialism as balanced nationalism for
each component group.
But Tito is no longer a young man
and his life-work is not nearly accom-
plished. Titoist Communism may be
“different” but so far it has just as much
failed to convert the Yugoslav peoples
to its tenets as the Moscow-brand has
failed to turn the majority of Poles,
Czechs, Hungarians, Rumanians and
Bulgarians into Communists. Perhaps the
genuine democratic Socialism proposed
by Tito’s one - time friend, Milovan
Djilas, would have been an answer to
Yugoslavia’s problems. But Tito rejected
this proposal and Djilas has been in
prison for years.
The fact is that Yugoslavia still suffers
from the ailments with which it was
born 45 years ago. And Tito or his heirs
must cure these ailments or Yugoslavia,
as we know it now, will cease to exist.


HIGH AND DRY
BY CLIFFORD TOLCHARD
A SHORT STORY
IT was all arranged during the few sober hours between bouts: “Some-
thing has got to be done. You can see that, can’t you? You can’t go
on like this. It’s impossible.”
“Yes, I know. I’m sorry. I’ll be all right in a day or two. Just give me
a few more days. I’ll be all right then.”
“Oh, darling, you’ve said that before; so many times.”
“Yes, I know I have, but look what it’s going to cost!”
“Don’t worry about that, that’s the
least of it. If it’s going to cure you it
will be worth it. Goodness! wouldn’t
you spend a hundred pounds on me if
I had a cancer or something like that?”
“Yes, of course, but ...”
“Well then . . . You must see that we
can’t go on like this.”
I hadn’t a chance. They were coming
at me from all angles, so I agreed I
would go into hospital, “but only,” I
said, “if I can take a bottle of brandy
with me.”
“They’ll take it off you, but take one
if you must. They give you brandy any-
way. The girl at the Centre said so and
she has been in herself.”
I didn’t want to go; hadn’t much faith
in it really. I knew I could get better my
own way when I got round to it. That
was the trouble really; getting round to
it. I wanted to get better and I knew I
could do it in my own way. I just wanted
a little more time, a few more days, then
I would be OK again. I wasn’t happy
the way I was. Hell, no, but I couldn’t
argue any more so I gave in. That made
them all very happy.
On the morning that I was to enter
hospital I searched the house for some-
thing, anything to drink. Frantically I
probed all my known and half-remem-
bered hiding places; under the bed, top
of the wardrobe, the toilet, garden shed,
the long grass in the garden, even the
dustbin; any odd corner that might pro-
vide a cache for liquor. In the end it
turned up in the “fridge,” eight lovely
cans of it, and part of a bottle of whisky
from under the bath. Corn in Egypt!
Enough to give myself a grand send-off
to the hospital. They wanted me to go,
and go I would but in my own way
full. At least, I thought, I’ll give them
something to work on when I get there.
The beer I would drink at home, now,
but the whisky I would save to drink in
the car.
Steadily I worked through the eight
cans, indifferent to reproaches. “Hell!
I’ve agreed to go haven’t I? You don’t
think I’m going to leave all this do you?”
I opened the last can. The condemned
man drank a hearty breakfast; too hearty.
I could feel it catching up with the re-
mains of the night before. O well, if
they wanted a drunk they could have
one.
Finally they got me dressed, ready;
clean underclothes but no bath; to hell
with hygiene. Bathing was too much of
an effort, but somehow my feet had got
washed. There always seems to be a lot
of fuss about feet; they must be clean.
Doesn’t matter about your clothes or the
rest of you as long as your feet are
washed: mine were.
“Ready?”
I weaved my way to the car clasping
my whisky bottle. I felt pretty good;
drunkish, but good.
“Put the brandy in?”
“Yes, it’s in your case.”
“Sure? Let me look.”
“Of course I’m sure. I put it in my-
self ... Oh well, if you must . . . There!”
I had to look for myself, make sure.
They cheat you sometimes, put one over
on you. Not any more though, I’d been
caught too many times. They do it for
your own good of course, but that was
the bargain; no brandy no hospital.
Talk about a journey to the end of
night; it was worse. Was it four miles or
forty? I had no idea. Nobody seemed
to want to talk much. Perhaps we had
said all we had to say. I cuddled my
whisky bottle, taking an occasional swig,
banging the neck of the bottle against
my teeth, feeling little but vaguely con-
scious of the impact. Quietly I sang
snatches from operas; “Che gelida Man-
ina” and bits from “Tosca.” Without me
it would have been like a pauper’s funeral
with one carriage. But at the back of my
consciousness I knew that that’s what it
would be like later; it had to come, and
soon. But for a time keep on singing
and talking. Better to talk and sing than
. . . than what? . . . Cry?
There was still a little whisky in the
bottom of the bottle, technically about
two ounces. This had to be saved for
the last minute; the actual final last
seconds. When the car stopped at the
door I would finish it off in one swallow,
the ultimate gesture. I had planned that
as I always planned to have a bottle,
or at least something in a bottle parked
somewhere, just in case. We all do it;
save a few cans, a bottle, or even just
part of one, otherwise you’ll be left with
only vanilla essence or something like
that.
There were two of them with me; my
gentle escorts. As we entered the hospital,
a private one, they came in with me. One
of them stayed beside me in the hall,
a benign guard, while the other concluded
arrangements with the secretary.
She found that: The secretary was
very nice. She understood all about it,
“Has he anything in his case?”
“Well, yes, there is. A bottle of brandy.
He insisted on it. He wouldn't have come
otherwise. We had quite a job with him.
He was so afraid there would be nothing
here, although we told him there would
be. It worried him. I’m afraid he is very
sick.”
“I quite understand, my dear. They
are a problem, but we’re not so hard as
that, we give them brandy at intervals
for the first few days, it would be cruel
not to. But I shall have to take charge
of that bottle. You can have it back
when he leaves. Don’t worry, he will be
well looked after here. He hasn’t any-


tiring else has he? No tablets, or anything
like that . . . ?”
“No, he hasn’t got on to drugs, thank
goodness. That’s one blessing. Shall I
be able to see him before I go?”
“Yes, that’ll be all right, just for a
moment, but I shouldn’t visit for a few
days. We like them to settle down first.
He should be responding to treatment in
a day or two. Say about next Tuesday
or Wednesday.
“Now I’ll just get sister to get him up-
stairs, then you can see him for a minute
when he is in bed.”
“Thank you very much. That’s a re-
lief about the brandy. He was so worried
about it. He wouldn’t believe me when
I told him you gave it to patients. That’s
why he insisted on bringing a bottle. It
was the only way I could get him here.”
A confused, agitated picture of beds,
other people, a man undressing me:
“S’all right. All clean clothes. Changed
this morning. All clean. Clean feet, too.
No bath, but feet OK. Clean.” I could
hear him talking to me; encouragingly,
I suppose.
In the background, superintending, a
sister dressed in white, wearing a large
impractical headdress, like a great white
bird hovering over her. It seemed to fill
half the room. She took away my suit-
case and all my clothes as soon as I was
in bed.
I felt very alone and frightened. An
atavistic fear threatened to overwhelm
me. I needed a drink, badly. When would
the first official brandy arrive?
A well-known face appeared. It
seemed to float, bodiless in the air above
the foot of my bed. Indistinctly, its out-
lines wavered like the unfolding of an
ectoplasm at a seance. I was conscious
of being kissed.
“Goodbye, darling. Be a good boy.
You’ll soon be better. I’ll come and see
you soon, about Wednesday, I expect.”
I felt tears running down my face,
tasted them. I felt lonelier than ever.
Sleeping; waking; dreaming; sweating;
the sharp edge of a glass cutting my
lips, the taste of brandy. Unconscious
again, sobering slightly, shaking. Once
nature forced me out into the passage
to the toilet. “Where are you off to?”
demanded the sister in challenging tones.
“I’m only going to the toilet,” I said,
aggrieved. I needn’t have made the
effort; after all there was a mackintosh
sheet in the bed. But patients sometimes
wander, hopelessly looking for someone
or something familiar, then they find
themselves outside in the road pursued
by irate nurses and are liable to be put
in restraining sheets.
That first afternoon and evening
passed in a state of mental and physical
collapse only slightly relieved at inter-
vals by brief dozes, cruelly haunted.
At times I seemed to be plagued by
“more devils than vast hell could hold.”
With efficient regularity, on the hour
I was given brandy diluted with glucose.
There was a plastic jugful of this sickly
liquid on the bedside cabinet, you were
urged to drink as much as possible. It
was supposed to keep the “horrors”
away. But hell, it wasn’t strong enough
to do that, they were there all right
pretty creatures.
Tea and supper were left untasted.
I hadn’t eaten for days, I couldn’t re-
member my last proper meal, the sight
of food was sickening. Between brief
periods of sleep I tried, ineffectually to
bring my whirling brain into some sort
of order. The three other patients in
the room were fully dressed. Through
improperly focused eyes I watched them
as they walked restlessly in and out or
lay on their beds reading. One con-
tinually complained: “Jeez, 1 feel crook.
All tensed up somehow. Wonder how
soon I can get out? A man could go
crazy here.”
A genial, gross looking man lay on
the top of his bed smiling to himself and
absent-mindedly fondled his genitals.
At ten o’clock the night sister gave
me my brandy mixed with paraldehyde.
It tasted like the worst sort of disinfec-
tant and was the ruination of the brandy.
It was supposed to send you to sleep but
it only gave me about half an hour; sleep
and I had become strangers.
There was a small lamp fixed to the
head of my bed. When the peopled dark-
ness became too much, and the whis-
pering voices issuing trom inside eccen-
tric rings of color became too insistent
I switched it on, finding some comfort
in its calm illumination.
I remembered how, as a young boy at
boarding school after being subjected
to attacks of bullying more venomous
than usual I would hide my toothbrush
under my pillow, and when in bed after
“lights out” I would suck the handle,
imagining it to be a pipe and hoping
in this way to regain some of my shaken
manhood. I felt as wea'. and scared now
as I had then and wondered if my tooth-
brush would still have the same consoling
effect. It is remarkable how extreme
tribulation will strip away a threadbare
cloak of manhood revealing nothing but
a frightened child seeking the solace of
a toothbrush, or more properly, a nipple.
At 4 a.m. a dim, moving red light
appeared beside my bed. I reared up in a
panic. This light seemed to have more
substance than the ones 1 had been
seeing, but it was only the night sister
with her covered torch bearing the regu-
lation tot. “Pipe down,” she said, “You'll
wake the others.” Not for another four
nights was I to sleep again.
Morning; but the sequence of my
nightmares still continued. In the day-
light the pictures had faded to be re-
placed by disorganised sounds. The metal-
lic clatter of a motor mower changed
to a Frankenstein-like voice chattering
grim gibes. I could visualise the erratic
movements of its steel jaws, their waver-
ing shape. Even the ticking of my watch
assumed the reverberating sounds of
some monstrous clock or great bell. I
felt myself to be one of those unidenti-
fiable figures that you see in the paintings
of Hieronymus Bosch or Paul Klee. I
tried to pour out a glass of glucose
that was supposed to help, but my wildly
shaking hand sent it cascading all over
the bedside table. I watched it trickle
down the sides to the floor. I felt over-
whelmed by misery. Then Eddie got up
from his bed. “Here, hold on, mate. I’ll
do that for you.” He must have been
watching me. He poured out a glass and
held it to my mouth. “Eddie,” I said,
almost pleading with him to say yes,
“Eddie, is it time for the brandy yet?
Surely to God it’s time now. It must be.”
“W ON T l° n g now > mate. Hang on a
bit longer. She’ll be round in a few
minutes. How you feeling?”
“Oh Eddie, bloody awful . . . bloody
awful, really. What a night!”
He sat on my bed for a while. I felt
some comfort from his physical near-
ness. Then the nurse arrived with the
brandy.
“Come on, sister,” said Eddie. “Where
you been? There’s a man nearly dying
here. Been waiting for you since five
o’clock.”
She was a good sort, this sister. “He’ll
be all right now,” she said. “Here’s his
life-saver.” And she gave it to me with
a real smile, too. That helped. A frag-
ment of normality had crept in.
I went along to the bathroom walking
like a mishandled marionette. My reflec-
tion in the mirror hit me smack be-
tween the eyes. Christ! I thought, E. A.
Poe, De Quincy, Jack London and Scott
Fitzgerald all rolled into one, only dif-
ference was l hadn’t written any books
yet, and the way things were going it
didn’t look as though I ever should. I
needed a shave badly but doubted
whether I could make it with my hands
shaking the way they were. Percy, the
butcher had an electric razor, perhaps
he would shave me. Or maybe another
day or two wouldn’t matter. I returned
to bed.
“How’s the time, Eddie,” I asked.
“Be a little while yet, mate. You
haven’t long had one. What is it now,
every hour? Be every two hours to-
morrow.”
“Jeez, you’re lucky,” said Percy. “Get-
ting brandy. I could do with a tot me-
self. Or a nice schooner. Wouldn't that
be something.”
The others began to dress, talking,
joking. 1 lay silent, apart, barely noticing

them. I was interested in one thing only,
my next brandy.
“You were in a right state yesterday,”
Eddie said to me. “Had to keep turning
you over. Thought you were going to
roll out of bed once or twice. And snore!
Jesus! Like a man choking. Matter of
fact I thought you were choking a few
times.”
“ Pity you didn’t mate,” said Percy,
“you’d have been out of it then.”
Another joined in: “I remember the
last time I came in here . . . Jeez, I was
crook . . . Been on the “plonk” for a
week . . . real crook I was. Funny
though, you’d hardly believe it. In a cab
I was, coming along George Street. I
could hear the most beautiful music.
Jeez, I thought that’s lovely . . . beauti-
ful it was . . , really beautiful. So I
said to the driver, “Turn the radio up a
bit, mate.” I wanted to hear it better.
He said, this driver said, ‘You silly
bastard, it ain’t even on.’ Jeez, I was real
crook that time.”
The sister brought the brandy then;
impossible to explain the relief that tot
brought me, like having a blood trans-
fusion at the last possible moment when
it is almost too late. Then came break-
fast. There was enough for six men if
they were all in my condition. I made the
plate messy with two poached eggs and
drank half a cup of tea. It takes three
or four days before you can really eat
a meal.
“Poached eggs! Poached eggs!” Bill
complained. “They must be working these
bloody chooks overtime. A man could
do to sit down to a real steak. Wait
until I get home. If my missus gives me
eggs I’ll sling ’em at her.”
They went down to breakfast.
All day I lay, sick and nauseated,
without will or purpose. Only the regular
spots of brandy and the desperate jour-
neys to the toilet punctuated the irksome
hours.
At eleven o’clock a sister had come in
bearing a white enamel tray containing
drugs and a hypodermic. “You, too,”
she said to me. I was the only bed patient,
the others were at least a week ahead
of me.
In turn we bared our buttocks. Quiver-
ing, like a nervous animal I bent over the
bed waiting apprehensively, as though
for the stab of a bayonet. I gave an in-
voluntary jerk as the needle entered.
“Whoa,” cried the nurse. Like talking
to a horse I thought vaguely. The others,
used to the ordeal, joked about it. “Hope
you’ve been practising on that orange,
sister. Needles been sharpened lately?”
It was a vitamin injection to build
you up; I had twenty more to come. 1
thought I would need them. We had two
small pills each as well.
Slowly, like an imperceptibly rising
tide I crept back to life. There was noth-
ing dramatic or sudden about it but


gradually 1 began to take notice of
things, listening more attentively to the
other patients and adding comments of
my own. 1 watched the drug addict pace
endlessly up and down the passage out-
side our room. Ceaselessly, silently he
walked from his own single room to the
verandah and then back again, driven by
some relentless incubus. Each time he
passed he gave a sidelong look into our
room, obviously seeing nothing. I could
see his blank eyes sunk deep in their
sockets behind his glasses.
On the fifth day I was allowed to get
up. No clothes though, only a dressing
gown over my pyjamas. My clothes were
still locked away. They were still not
sure that I might not take off before the
three weeks were up. That’s the time
the cure is supposed to take, or rather
the time it takes to build you up ready
for the next spree; there isn’t any cure
My allowances had been discontinued,
the only aid I had now was a sedative at
night.
One of the first things I did on getting
up was to make a phone call. I hated the
thought of having visitors here in this
place. I felt they would be regarding me
speculatively, as though awaiting the re-
sults of an interesting experiment. So I
told them not to come until I was ready
to leave. Several others felt the same
way.
The tables were set for four in the
dining-room where I now had my
meals. I shared one with Percy and two
women patients. One of the women,
Elizabeth, had been there fifteen months
and the other, older one longer. Eliza-
beth kept telling me how the doctor had
told her that she could drink beer and
table wine when she got out. She hadn’t
a hope, nobody was going to let her
drink anything. And I don’t think she
had much hope of getting out anyway,
the way she was. She couldn’t remember
a thing you said to her ten minutes
later. Poor cow.
Margery, the older one, was plump
with grey hair and rosy cheeks. Real
matronly. It seemed a shame to think
of an old duck like that all soused up
with gin roaming about pubs or sitting
secretly in her room swigging whatever
it was she drank. She was a real no-
hoper, too. Every now and again she
would sigh to herself: “Oh, dear . . .
Oh, dear. I wish I had a harp, be all
over then.” They both left most of
their food at mealtimes, but Margery
got through forty cigarettes a day.
Each of us were taken to the
psychiatrist sometime during the three
weeks. That was the only laugh we got
there. He was quite old, with a rusty old
voice. He would have mumbled in his
beard if he had had one, but all he had
was a chewed-up looking moustache
and one of those automatic smiles that
seem to be worked by strings. Within
minutes he told me that I was a typical
alcoholic. I could have told me that
myself. He smoked all the time, too. Ash
all over his waistcoat like snowflakes.
Gradually life returned to a saner pat-
tern; newspapers and books were taken
up, and sometimes read. Boredom began
to creep in. Mealtimes assumed the pro-
portions of treats. Again and again we
repeated our personal stories to each
other, recounting in detail the sordid
episodes of our fantastic lives. The only
thing was the incidents did not seem
funny any more, only frightening. “Jeez,
I remember ” and so on.
Sometimes the shabby monotony of
our daily lives was shattered by the ar-
rival of a particularly recalcitrant patient
forcibly prised from his lonely world of
drink or drugs. The ‘druggies’ were the
worst, deprivation often made them vio-
lent, and brandy was not strong enough
to calm them. We had a real beauty one
day; twice she got out into the street
asking people for a ‘shot’ or some brandy
. . . anything.
When they brought her back for the
second time she had been sitting in her
dressing-gown in a garden two doors
away. Nobody had seen her go out. We
watched her being escorted back by two
nurses. She was whimpering: “I don't
want to stop here. I don't want to stop
HERE. Sister, can't I go home?”
They put her to bed again under a
restraining sheet, hobbles on her legs, her
arms tied, the lot. And then she started.
“Matron! MaaatrON! Give me something
to help me. Matron, please, matron”.
Her cries and sobs rose to shouts and
increased to screams.
Shaken, we stood in our rooms and
in the passages whispering to each other.
“Jeez, she’s crook”.
“Poor bitch. She got out of the sheet.
Got out of the ruddy sheet”.
“Thank God I never got on drugs.
Grog’s bad enough.”
I could still see the woman's face as
it had appeared as the nurses led her
back to her room; disorganised and
flabby, mottled with sickly patches of
colour. She reminded me of the woman
in Degas’ picture, ‘Absinthe’. I hoped I
wouldn’t carry the memory of the sight
for long. She illustrated with terrifying
clarity the abyss into which any one of
us might even then be falling. They soon
decided to transfer her to another hos-
pital they could not cope with her
there. We were all glad to see her go, to
hear her shrieks cut off by the closed
doors of the ambulance. The whole place
seemed to sigh with relief. We felt
lighter, for the moment almost cheerful,
like coming out from under a black
cloud.
Then came a great event: Our first
walk out. “Just round the block,” the
sister said. “And no calling in at ‘The
Horse and Jockey,’ mind.”
No danger, we were safe, cured, good
patients. We joked about it. Joked about
the gardens we passed. If we saw a
neglected or untidy garden we decided
that the householder must be an alco-
holic: “Look at that one, he must be an
‘alkie’. And that one; an ‘alkie’ for sure.”
Then we would start the old game of ‘I
remember’. “Jeez, I remember one time,
up in Cairns it was, or Canberra or Wool-
loomooloo or anywhere. The location
didn't matter the result was always the
same. “I remember . . . Jeez, I was crook
that time.”
Three times a week we had a meeting
with visitors from outside. The 12 Steps
of A.A. painted on a large banner hang-
ing on the wall. The stories were always
the same except in detail. We clapped
dutifully at the end of each sordid, drama-
tized recital.
“My name is Harry, and I’m an alco-
holic.” Or, “Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, my name is Doris and I’m a
drug addict.”
They seemed to me then to announce
the fact almost with a sense of achieve-
ment, of pride. They held the stage for
a few moments like an actor or a lecturer,
building themselves up. But I was still
learning so I may have been wrong. I
voiced my views to another man. “Look,
chum,” he said, “that man there hasn’t
had a drink for ten years, and you're
still a ‘wet brain’. Don’t rush it.”
But the stories were real enough, dis-
turbingly so.
“I was crawling across the bedroom
floor, drunk. I could hear myself sobbing.
All I wanted was that one lousy little pill
that I had dropped on the carpet, and
which would send me to sleep if I
could reach it.”
“ . . . not a drop of grog in the house
so I drank a bottle of lemon essence.”
“ . . . end of my tether . . . lying in
my own vomit . . . strait-jacket . . .
Reception Centre . . . It's not a happy
drunk, that’s for sure . . . death or in-
sanity . . .”
Afterwards we had tea and biscuits and
talked some more, and compared ex-
periences.
But at last it was all over. The three
weeks were up. I was well again ready
to go home. I paid my bill and was given
some literature.
“You will go to the meetings,” they
said, “won't you? They help such a lot.
And don't forget: one drink is one too
many. It’s the first one that does the
damage.”
“I'll remember,” I said.
“Good. Now don’t forget, the first
drink is poison to you. Goodbye now,
and good luck.”
So I said goodbye and left, not forget-
ting to recover my bottle of brandy from
the secretary . . . just in case.

Life in the Buyer’s Market
The discount houses , and after
By J. C. HORSFALL
1T has been a buyer’s market in Aus-
tralia since 1960 and many in-
dustrialists and traders still wonder in
their despairing whether the damage will
ever by fully repaired, let alone whether
conditions will ever return to those of
pre-recession days when sellers had it
made.
As the managing director of one of
the country’s biggest appliances makers
put it to me in Sydney recently, a wide
area of the retail trade has descended to
the level of an Eastern Bazaar where
the prices marked on goods in many
stores mean little more than a starting
price for bargaining between customer
and seller.
All the by-products of the selling war,
like trade-ins, have made a mockery of
listed prices over the whole field of
appliances and many other products.
Whereas early on in the recession trading
terms in discount houses were the excep-
tion, they have now become the rule of
retailing. These days an old razor blade
is just as likely to get you a big slice
off the listed price of a shaver in
McEwens as it is up the street at a dis-
count house. The same goes for your
old washing tub. Often you only have
to mention that you have one of these
things at home to get the advertised cut;
there is no question of embarrassing the
retailer by bringing it into his shop.
One could go on with a recital of the
nonsense which pervades the retail scene
cut-price cigarettes, “special” bargains
in grocery stores which are just a blind
for general discounting practices, and so
on. Everybody is familiar with them, but
perhaps not so much with the stresses
and strains lying behind the retail facade.
These reach right back to the manu-
facturers and importers, indeed to the
suppliers of raw materials and com-
ponents, who though they may seem
remote from the retail scene are just as
firmly caught up in the toils of the
buyer’s market as the retailers them-
selves.
To the general public, or at any rate
those who feel themselves perpetual
victims of conventional mark-up per-
centages, all this will not seem so terrible.
Housewives and home furnishers for the
most part have revelled in the disorderly
state of affairs, simply because it’s
enabled them to get goods cheaply.
But to the retailers themselves, and the
merchants and manufacturers feeding
goods into this inglorious public auction,
it has made merchandising a nightmare
which becomes more hideous still when
considered against the background of
regulation and wage dictates which
private enterprise has to work under. It
would look very curious indeed to
shoppers if the roles were reversed, if
prices were fixed say by State regulation
(as the ACTU Congress recently
advocated), and employers could shop
around for labor on their own terms!
It maj be, as Attorney - General
Sir Garfield Barwick stoutly believes,
that the structure of marketing in Aus-
tralia is riddled with conventions and
trade agreements, but even if some of
these may appear to bear heavily on the
consumer, a moment’s thought is enough
to see that the results, in terms of orderly
marketing, are well worth the price.
Without orderly marketing, private enter-
prise could not, in the long run, function
on the terms of operation dictated to it
by State regulation and wage - fixing
machinery in this country. You can’t
sustain for long a position where you
have chaos in marketing combined with
inflexible terms of employment through
the length and breadth of the industrial
structure.
This is not the place to discuss re-
strictive trade practices or the proposals
to stop them, but there is a lesson for
Sir Garfield in the widespread disruption
of orderly marketing these last three
years since the Government, virtually
overnight, in November, 1960, made its
fatal assault on consumer spending and
ushered in the present buyer’s market on
the pretext of forestalling a supposedly
impending balance of payments crisis.
It may be wrong to nail the blame for
the current disorderly state of marketing
affairs directly at the Government’s door.
But it is beyond doubt that even if the
Government did not conceive or even
want them, the proliferation of snide
trade arrangements, the rise of the dis-
count houses, the general protrusion of
the “trade-in”, the falsification of marked
prices in business practice, and the pros-
titution of merchandising arrangements
all the way back to manufacturers and
suppliers of raw materials and com-
ponents, were born out of the Govern-
ment’s economic restraints of November,
1960.
Actually the seeds of the buyer’s mar-
ket were sprung in the heyday of the
strong seller’s market that persisted for
about two years before the Government
cracked down on it. Attracted by the
glowing prospects for an expanding
market in that favorable period for sel-
lers, industry was increasing its capacity
at such a pace and so many new pro-
ducers and retailers were entering the
field that, failing a continual inflationary
build-up of effective demand, a boil-over
was bound to occur in due course That
sort of process is as old as economic
history itself. Whatever a Government
might do or not do, the seeds of buyers’
markets are invariably sown when sellers
are in the ascendant.
Equally, one might suppose, a buyer’s
market cannot last for ever. But in the
absence of stimulants from the Govern-
ment or some other source, such as a
boom in wool prices or a massive inflow
of overseas capital, buyers’ markets tend
to drag on interminably in this country.
There are plenty of examples of this,
such as in the 1930 s w'hen after the
termination of the seller’s market in
1929, following thb cessation of heavy
Government borrowing overseas, a
buyer’s market persisted for most of the
decade. Another buyer’s market, of
somewhat shorter duration was en-
countered in 1957 and 1958 sparked off
by the “little Budget” of late 1956.
The Simpson-Pope alliance
/°lne could reasonably argue that
current economic portents favor a
weakening of the present buyer’s market
for the simple reason that spending
power (even if not yet spending itself)
must now be rising strongly as a result
of the reduction in unemployment, in-
crease in industrial output and higher
export income. Equally one might
assume that, at least for household
appliances, the current rise in home
building would soon begin to be reflected
in a strengthening of demand.
But most manufacturers whom I’ve
talked to on this point cannot as yet see
much change in the position. As they
see it, there are obstacles on both demand
and supply sides: near - saturation of
demand for many durable goods coupled
with the continued caution of consumers
on the one hand, and excess current and
potential supplies of local and imported
goods on the other. Moreover, they say
competition on the supply side is as
intense as ever it was because of surplus
capacity coupled with trade drives in.
the Australian market by overseas
suppliers. One manufacturer considered
that over the next year cheap imports
from Japan might well be the biggest


obstacle against the restoration of more
normal marketing conditions in the
appliances trade.
Another manufacturer told me his
company did not expect any big let-up
until 1965-66 when he anticipated a
strong increase in demand arising from
marriages of people born in the early
post-war period. Meanwhile, the pressure
would be on manufacturers to continue
to price generously for the wholesale and
retail trade, and this in turn would be
reflected in tightness in manufacturers’
dealings with their own suppliers.
It would also mean that to retain sales
outlets (and probably against their better
judgment) certain manufacturers would
continue to supply some virtually insol-
vent retailers who normally would have
had to put up their shutters long ago.
The underpinning of such outlets by
harassed manufacturers is one of the
most incongruous aspects of the buyer’s
market.
As one might have expected, the inten-
sified competition in the appliances trade
over the last three years has driven many
manufacturing firms, particularly TV
makers, to the wall. But the field is still
very crowded in a number of products,
and this is the major reason why sellers
are continuing to get the thin end of the
trading stick. Where some firms have
been “rescued” from straitened circum-
stances by mergers or takeovers, this has
often led to even fiercer competition be-
cause new managements have been
anxious to get stocks moving into the
trade as quickly as possible. The Simp-
son-Pope alliance is a case in point.
The rough, tough 1960 s
YlThere local manufacturers have sought
" to get round the competition barrier
by introducing new models and products
(innovation, of course, goes on all the
time and for individual firms is a safer
way out of the competition dilemma than
price cutting which is a self defeating
process), this has only made things worse
for those who have failed to follow suit.
It has also hit importers whose supply
arrangements are far less flexible. Even
Associated Electrical Industries, market-
ing a new product such as the Galamatic
washing machine in Australia for the first
time, hasn’t been able to make the de-
sired impression in the tough marketing
conditions.
Underlining the general view of manu-
facturers, in an address to the National
Electrical Industry Conference on Sep-
tember 23rd, Sir Alan Westerman, secre-
tary of the Department of Trade, summed
up the market outlook in very sober
terms indeed. Noting that demand for
durable goods which had bubbled furi-
ously in the 1950 s had declined to a “sim-
mer” this decade, he continued: “Oppor-
tunities will exist in the 60s, but it will be
a question of who will be alive in the
60s, and in what kind of health, to enjoy
these opportunities; it is going to be a
rough, tough and therefore a challenging
decade; companies would have to be able
to meet the challenge of the market-place
and produce the right product in the right
places at the right time in the right
quantity and at the right price”.
The prospect, stated in these terms, is
certainly stern, but having trimmed its
sails to counter the stronger winds of
competition in the last year or two, in-
dustry admits it is now in a far better
position to live with the buyer’s market,
and that even if the end of it is not yet
in sight, the worst seems to be over.
For one thing, established retailers con-
sider they have virtually beaten the dis-
count houses at their own game by em-
ploying discount devices up to the hilt.
The main battles of the buyer's market in
the retail sphere are now between them-
selves.
This is not to say that we have seen
the last of the discount houses such as
the more blatant ones like Tom the
Grocer and the Victoria Discount House
which specialises in appliances and elec-
trical equipment of various kinds, but
their nuisance value is likely to decline.
It has certainly weakened, even over the
last few months, and in fact has never
been as big a threat to established traders
in the eastern States as it has in, say,
Western Australia.
Compared with its great impact on
retail trading in the United States, the
discount house idea has had relatively
poor success here. Various reasons have
been suggested for this The most plau-
sible is that its advent coincided with a
period of economic recession in which
established retailers had, themselves, to be
very flexible in pricing in order to stay in
business.
The discount houses chose the appli-
ances and electrical equipment field for
their crash into Australian retailing. They
could hardly have chosen a worse one
because not only was it already crowded
and consumer demand on the verge of
saturation point, following the spending
spree of 1959-60, but manufacturers, not
expecting this spree to be nipped in the
bud, had also over-built capacity and
would soon have to cet in the mood to
do deals with their established trade out-
lets in order to sell their output.
Moreover, if to horn in on the trade
of established retailers, the discount
houses could afford to sacrifice big slices
of the high retail mark-ups (which run as
high as 75 per cent of list prices on appli-
ances and electrical equipment) so could
the established retailers. But it took until
late in 1961 for the latter fully to wake
up to the necessities in that direction in
the appliances field, and not until they had
put all the pressure they could on manu-
facturers to stop supplying the discount
houses. Their pleas to dissuade manu-
facturers from supplying the latter fell
mostly on deaf ears simply because stocks
were piling up rapidly and had to be
moved.
The Hoover case
Out once resigned to the necessities,
established retailers decided to go the
whole hog in many instances and beat
the discount houses with their big sticks
by getting closer their suppliers. This has
worked miracles for them, especially in
the case of the big national retailing
groups whose buying power is a critical
factor in the calculations of the manu-
facturers.
Most of the pressure on manufacturers
has come from retailers requiring heavy
discounts on the established prices for
goods they usually don’t mind whether
it is the wholesaler or the manufacturer
who makes the cut for him in the
knowledge of the highly competitive situ-
ation existing among suppliers, including
importers. As a result more and more
suppliers have been forced to deal direct
with retailers.
A classic case of this was seen a few
months ago when Hoover, the biggest
marketer of appliances here, gave notice
to Consumer Services (Victoria) and Dry-
lec (NSW) of its intention to terminate
their exclusive Hoover franchises cover-
ing their respective States. As the
Hoover board explained at the time, one
of the main reasons for the move was to
put the manufacturing company in a
better position to deal on national basis
with retailers. It already dealt direct
with retailers in Queensland It has not
made any move yet to take over the
franchises in WA and SA, but doubtless
this will come soon.
Many of the wholesalers who have
been hit hard by this by-passing process
have found their answer in setting up the
discount business themselves, to deal
either directly with the public or through
social club organisations, which have long
been a channel for getting goods at a dis-
count on retail prices in this country. It
is usual for the “under-the-counter’''
atmosphere to be played up in this social
chib medium of discounting.

“DISCRIMINATION"
Sir,
As a student, and a “Territorian”, I
feel that some protest should be made
regarding Norman Fisher’s letter con-
cerning discrimination in Papua-NG
(28/9/63) The examples which he
mentioned are misleading, and fail to
take account of all the factors relevant
to the situation. He states that discri-
mination exists among the firms opera-
ting coastal shipping facilities. This is
utter rubbish. The small ships operating
in the coastal waters of New Guinea
are essentially cargo vessels, and carry
only a limited number of cabin passen-
gers. In addition, they will carry a num-
ber of passengers on deck, if required.
The fare for a cabin passenger is usually
about three times that for a deck pas-
senger, but any person, regardless of his
race, is entitled to travel by whichever
method he chooses. Because most Papu-
ans and New Guineans choose to travel
the less expensive (and less comfortable)
way, then it is hardly just to accuse the
shipowners of being discriminatory.
Mr Fisher also states that New Guine-
ans are still excluded from the lounges
of many hotels and from most clubs.
I’m quite sure that any New Guinean,
who was dressed appropriately and be-
haved soberly, could gain access to the
lounge of any hotel in the Territory. As
for clubs I’m not permitted to patro-
nise these either, unless I “fork out” an
exorbitant membership fee.
To state that humiliating acts of dis-
crimination occur on the major private
airlines is an unwarranted slur on both
TAA and Ansett-ANA. I have made
over 20 intra-Territory flights during the
last few years, and never once have I,
or any other European passenger, been
treated differently to any New Guinean.

HEDDA GABLER
Sir,
In common with Mr Peter Hastings
(28/9/63) I do not claim any special in-
sight into the intentions of Ibsen when
he created the character of Hedda Gabler.
Nevertheless, I feel that Hedda is neither
dated nor puzzling. She has always
struck me as a classic portrayal of the
woman made delinquent by her circum-
stances and literature is full of such
studies, from Euripides onwards. Max
Beerbohm seems to be showing charac-
teristically misplaced wit and triviality
when he declared that Ibsen hated her
and meant us to laugh at her for one
thing, I very much doubt if Ibsen ever
intended anyone to laugh at anything;
even that he knew the meaning of the
word.
As I see Hedda she might, given the
means, the connections and the inspira-
tion, have become a Florence Nightin-
gale (and lacking them Miss Nightingale
might have been a Hedda Gabler). In
another time and place Hedda might have
been a Maria Theresa or a Hester Stan-
hope; or the matron of a public hospital.
Or, given a Petrucchio as a husband
well, one could keep up the "iffing” in-
definitely.
Ibsen may have hated the little Hedda
Gablers he saw around him in Norway
and the same goes for Flaubert and
the little Madame Bovary; but both must
have felt pity as well and anger against
the social circumstances that nurtured
them, or they would scarcely have
bothered to set it all down on paper in
such a way that modern TV watchers, or
novel readers, experience a shock a
shock of recognition.
And because neither Ibsen nor Flau-
bert needed a psychiatrist’s couch to give
them insight into the vagaries of human
character and motives, but had the art-
ist’s insight into the universal behind the
particular, both have created figures that
are tragic in the classic meaning of the
word.

VICTIMS OF CRIME
Sir,
I suggest that a State fund should be
set up for the innocent victims of violent
crime. May I cite my own case? In a
city the size of Melbourne one is in-
clined to say “this sort of thing cannot
happen to me”. It did. Two young
men fractured my skull with a claw ham-
mer and left me lying on the pavement.
Surgeons and a noble band of nurses at
our Alfred Hospital saved my life. It
took me four months to learn to walk
reasonably well again. Had I been young
I would have despaired it means no
more sport, no more car driving.
Had I been struck by a car or a tram
I could have claimed compensation; here
I can claim nothing; but in New Zealand
there is legislation based on the premise
that the State has some obligation to an
innocent victim of violence.
GERALD MUSSEN
Hawthorn (Vic.).
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES
Sir,
Mr Roger Randerson’s tirades against
the Attorney-General’s proposals on re-
strictive trade practices stems largely
from a failure to understand the real
meaning of “free enterprise.” “Free en-
terprise” does not mean the “freedom” of
one businessman or group to restrict or
monopolise the economy, even if inci-
dental benefits accrue to the consumer.
A free enterprise economy is one in
which every person has the right to reach
the same economic position as another,
providing he is prepared to work for it.
The proposals do nothing more than put
the “free” back into free enterprise.
I agree that Australian industry has
provided a wide range of goods and ser-
vices at a relatively cheap rate, but I
fail to see how widespread price compe-
tition, as well as the other forms of com-
petition, would have meant a different
situation. In fact the consumer would
have benefited even more.
The manufacturer who has a good pro-
duct with a realistic price tag has nothing
to fear from competition. The shoddy
manufacturer who hides behind an
industry-wide price fix has every reason
for such fear.
Although the proposals are compre-
hensive, they take into account various
economic situations where their intru-
sion would serve no purpose to business-
man or consumer. The criminal law is
only to be used for a flagrant breach of
a clearly defined offence, and at all times
there is a right of appeal to a court of
law.
Australian industry will never be able
to compete abroad if it is afraid to com-
pete at home.

CHIROPRACTORS
Sir,
With reference to chiropractors, about
which there seems to be a bit of a con-
troversy (14/9/63), I had this experience.
I had an accident with a horse and got
what the doctors said was a broken neck.
I was under four doctors altogether, two
of them orthopaedic, and all said nothing
could be done for me. I had my spine
injured between the fifth and six verte-
brae and this affected the sensory nerves
over the whole of my body, except my
head. I was talked into visiting a chiro-
practor, who got full particulars of my
accident; he said what a pity it was 1 had
not come to him in the first place, as he
could have cured me.
He had some sort of instrument like a
speedometer, which he pushed along my
spine until he came to the spot where
I told him the injury had been; he then
said the instrument had picked out this
spot. He got me down on a sofa, gave
me a kind of uppercut on the neck, and
then told me to lie down for 20 minutes
and I would go home better than when
I came. I should say that previously he
had taken what purported to be an X-ray,
which he had ready for showing me in
an hour. This showed two vertebrae in
my neck widely out of plumb; nobody
could have lived with an injury like this.
I asked him for the film, but he would
not give it to me.

REVIEWS
LETTER FROM BRITAIN
You Can Always
Switch It Off
Highbrows and popcult
By BERNARD BERGONZI
Tjioß a long tune the proper attitude
of the wary intellectual to popular
culture and the mass media has been
one of instinctive suspicion and hostility.
F. R. Leavis drew up the battle-lines
30 years ago in “Mass Civilisation and
Minority Culture,” and “Culture and
Environment,” and made the issues
plain. The intellectual minority were
the defenders of true values and genuine
culture against the onslaughts of com-
mercialism and mass communications. It
might be a losing battle, but at least it
was exhilarating to be so obviously
fighting on the side of righteousness.
Now, however, the distinction is less
clear cut; the word “culture” is increas-
ingly used, not in the Arnoldian sense in
which Leavis employed it, but in a much
broader anthropological fashion. The
change has been wittily expressed by
the young novelist and critic, Malcolm
Bradbury, who recently remarked that
“culture” used to mean taking an in-
terest in poetry, painting, music, and so
on, whereas now it means taking an in-
terest in anything at all. T. S. Eliot, in
“Notes Towards a Definition of Cul-
ture” (1948), referred to “culture” as
something which characterises the
whole way of life of a community, and
illustrated English culture by a curious
list of items beginning with Derby Day
and Henley Regatta, and ending up with
“boiled cabbage cut into sections, beet-
root in vinegar, nineteenth-century
Gothic churches and the music of
Elgar.”
More recently, such highly influential
books as Richard Hoggart’s “The Uses
of Literacy” (1957) and Raymond Wil-
liams’ “Culture and Society” (1958) and
“The Long Revolution” (1961) have
shown a similar disposition to discuss
“culture” in a wide, non-exclusive sense,
though their authors have a very dif-
ferent political and social bias from
Eliot’s.
This shift of emphasis has tended to
change the intellectual’s attitude to-
wards mass or popular culture (the
terms, one must admit, are desperately
vague, and Raymond Williams has pro-
tested violently against the assumptions
implicit in this use of the word “mass”);
whereas once he could regard it as the
enemy, to be resisted without quarter
and this attitude is still very com-
mon now he might be more inclined
to regard it as a puzzling but legitimate
object of curiosity: the elitist ivory
tower of the old traditional high culture
somehow seems less secure.
Ane can easily provide illustrations.
ln the past few years all the “quality”
Sunday papers and the intellectual week-
lies have taken to providing reviews of
jazz records and recitals, in addition to
their normal coverage of classical music.
The traditionalist, nurtured on “Culture
and Environment,” might well take this
as evidence of a disastrous collapse of
standards, particularly if he is of the
age-group that still equates “jazz” with
cacophony, “dance music,” popular
songs, etc. In fact, the word “jazz,”
which in the twenties had a great aura
of gaiety and abandon, has had an in-
teresting semantic history; now it has
highly serious overtones for me it
tends to conjure up an image of a grave
young man in a crew-cut and horn-
rimmed spectacles solemnly analysing
the latest track by John Coltrane. The
jazz criticism published in the serious
papers is both hard-hitting and erudite,
and the general critical level is probably
higher than in the other review columns.
Jazz by now is an established sub-cul-
ture; not classical, obviously, but cer-
tainly not pop either.
Still, there are points of contact be-
tween the jazz and pop worlds (didn't
Dave Brubeck once get into the Top
Ten?). Kingsley Amis, for instance, who
has written enthusiastic though I am
told not very informed articles on
jazz, last year appeared as the star of
an extraordinary little series on com-
mercial TV called “Kingsley Amis Goe»
Pop.” In the two programmes that I
watched, the Fellow of Peterhouse
Cambridge (a post he has now relin-
quished), looking remarkably glum, ad-
dressed himself to making needling re-
marks to a young American pop singer
and a dance-hall manager. It was all
very odd, though doubtless highly symp-
tomatic.
For some time it has been accepted
as a matter of course that an intellec-
tual under 40 might well know a lot
about jazz; now, by degrees, an interest
in pop songs if interest isn’t too
strong a word is coming to seem
OK.
In the sphere of the visual arts, the
highly fashionable work of the “pop
artists” is significant; and is perhaps
an attempt at loving redemption of the
commercial artifacts of mass civilisation.
I don’t find it easy to have a deep
response to the design of a cigarette
packet, and, from what I have seen of
it, “pop art” seems to me to have a
quasi-sociological rather than a deeply
aesthetic appeal. Still, a taste for a bit
of anecdotal interest might make me
incline towards it rather than to the
equally fashionable works of the ab-
stract expressionist painters.
One or two intellectuals of my ac-
quaintance have adopted a position dia-
metrically opposed to Leavis’ flat re-
probation of mass taste, and are un-
ashamed enthusiasts for the whole -pop
world. Julian Mitchell is an energetic
young writer with First Class Honors
in History from Oxford who has pub-
lished since 1961 three entertaining if
undisciplined novels “Imaginary
Toys,” “A Disturbing Influence” and
“As Far As You Can Go.” Last
year he published an article on Elvis
Presley in the “London Magazine”
which might reasonably be described as
“scholarly.” More recently he re-
marked in the same publication, “Like
the rich, pop is always with us, yet
for a long time serious artists failed
to see its enormous value as a depository
of the emotions, attitudes and plain
facts of our society.”
A similar thought was expressed, in
a more august context, in Richard Hog-
gart’s recent inaugural lecture as Pro-
fessor of English at Birmingham Uni-
versity, “Schools of English and Con-
temporary Society.” After stressing the
importance of the work in scholarship
and criticism carried on by university
schools of English, Professor Hoggart
also suggested they might, in an experi-
mental way at post-graduate level, carry
out an investigation into popular culture
in so far as this involves literary and
linguistic media. There seems to be an
admitted ambivalence in Hoggart’s aim
here; on the one hand he wishes, in

all the year round
the spirit of “Culture and Environment,”
to understand more fully what the
enemy is up to (like the Soviet schools
that study capitalist institutions), but
on the other hand he is also aware of
a certain fascination in the pop world,
and would like to discover what might
be thought of as positive in it. He writes,
“Who can listen to a programme of
pop songs, or watch ‘Candid Camera’
or ‘This is Your Life,’ without endur-
ing a complicated and complex mixture
of attraction and repulsion, of admira-
tion for skill and scorn for the phoney,
of wry observations of similarities and
correspondences, of sudden liftings of
the heart at the raciness of speech, or
at the capacity for courage or fun, or
of shock at the way we ‘process’ every-
thing, even our own tears and laughter
at their most intimate.” This is effec-
tively put, and is certainly truer to the
complexities of experience than the un-
qualified rejections that we find in
Leavis’ cultural writings. Hoggart adds,
“it is a form of art (bastard art if you
want to call it that), but vulnerable,
mythic and not easily explained away.”
It depends what you mean by art, no
doubt; traditionally works of art were
long-lasting, whereas pop artifacts
songs or images or TV programmes
have all the transitoriness that one ex-
pects of the products of a consumers’
society (for more much more on
this, see Hannah Arendt’s “The Con-
dition of Man”). The discussion is
stimulating and genuinely difficult: as
a fairly addicted listener to late-night
pop record shows on the radio I feel
a certain passive involvement. On the
whole, I suppose, intellectuals ought to
have some idea of what is going on
around them provided it doesn’t take
too much time. There is, indeed, always
the possibility, remote and elusive
though it sometimes seems, of switching
off.

certainly, no one in the least interested in
contemporary cinema can afford to miss
it.
The story puts the notorious episode
of the devils of Loudun into a 16th-cen-
tury Polish setting: a monk, Suryn, arrives
at a nunnery in the iron Eastern plains,
warned by the sniggering peasantry that
his predecessor was burned for consort-
ing with the devil-possessed Mother
Superior Joan and her fellow nuns. When
an attempt at mass exorcism of the order
fails, Suryn tries prayer: this, too, proves
useless. Finally, he is seized by an uncon-
trollable desire for Mother Joan of the
Angels; in a moment of self-immolation
he “takes on" her demon, namely the
raging of physical desire, and runs head-
long from the monastery to assuage him-
self with the murder of two grooms.
Throughout the film the dancing of the
burned priest’s bastard children round the
blackened stake both reminds us of what
happened to him and seems to fore-
shadow his supplanter’s fate, not shown
but obviously forthcoming after his evil
deeds are discovered.
Profoundly anti-religious, the film
seems to be telling us that sexual frustra-
tion can only lead to destruction and
despair, a message hardly appealing to

advocates of monasticism. Only a series
of re-viewings could reveal the full
meaning of this astonishing tour-de-force ,
unquestionably one of the cinema’s
major virtuoso works. The long con-
versation between the monk and a rabbi,
the same actor playing both roles, seems
to indicate a philosophy of destruction
of religious barriers: the Jew and the
Catholic monk can only achieve matur-
ity and wisdom when they remember
that they are one flesh, members of the
same organism. But I should have to
explore this more closely at later screen-
ings.
The two main protagonists are played
with incomparable passion and skill by
Lucyna Winnicka and Mieczyslaw Yoi-
kas. Kawalerowicz’s direction is dazzling-
ly assured, most of all in the long
episode of the attempted exorcising of
the nuns and the monk’s sexual awaken-
ing in the partitioned attic enclosure
when he kisses Mother Joan for the first
and only time. The film is remarkable
not only for its electric eroticism and
sensuousness but for its classical frame-
work, the unities ruthlessly observed: the
entire film is set in the village, the sunlit
quarried plain and the nunnery itself, a
whitewashed tomb echoing with sexual
giggles, pattering feet, and fluttering
white habits like the wings of wild birds.
At the other end of the cinematic
canon, George Sidney’s “Bye Bye
Birdie” is an admirably expanded version
of the stage hit. Sidney and his camera-
man, Joseph Biroc, .have hit on a color
style ideally suited to this simple satire
of teenage predilections: fresh, bright
and primary, the yellows, reds and greens
most agreeably rinse the eye. The arrival
of the teenage star Birdie in a small
town, greeted by ravished teenagers
and swooning dowagers, is directed with
enormous zest and charm. Several of the
musical numbers are excitingly handled,
most notably the excellent “Whole Lotta
Livin’ To Do”, sung and danced with
irresistible American gusto by Ann-
Margret. Nice group playing by Dick
Van Dyke, Maureen Stapleton, and
Jesse Pearson; a fine rousing climax in
which the Russian Ballet is well and
truly flayed; see it by all means.

Tn the United States, where divorce is
so easy and so quick, it appears that
people divorce in haste and re-marry
each other at leisure. This situation
seems to appeal to women playwrights:
Clare Booth Luce used it in “The
Women”, and now Jean Kerr has used
it in “Mary, Mary”. The chief interest
of the play is in what it reveals of
American attitudes to marriage and
divorce; divorce seems to be just as
respectable as marriage. Marriage seems
to be judged rather like a tin-opener: it
either works or it doesn’t, and if it
doesn’t the simplest thing to do is to
throw it away and get another.
Mary lost her husband because she
could not stop herself being too clever.
She has a sharp, witty tongue, but her
puncturing remarks always made her
husband feel foolish. It takes the
worldly Dirk Winsten, famous Holly-
wood film star and connoisseur of
women, to see beneath Mary's surface
sharpness to the sweet but insecure
country girl beneath.
“Mary, Mary” is above all a vehicle
for the actress who plays Mary. Muriel
Pavlow is very good, but she doesn’t
manage to give the required nervous edge
to her playing. Raymond Westwell’s
production doesn’t achieve the pace and
verve necessary for American comedy.

“'T'he American Dream” has pace, bite,
bawdiness, wild humor, zany puns
and sight-gags. It kicks at American
Mommies and Daddies, stands up for
kindly, tough-surfaced old Grannies, and
along the way manages to hold quite a
slice of US life up to the light so you
can see through it. That’s if you’re in
the mind to see any sharp morals. Mr
Albee puts them there if you want them,
but you don’t have to look. He provides
plenty of busy laughter in other direc-
tions, so you have the best of both
worlds.
John Clark, who seems as a producer
to have a special affinity for our con-
temporary playwrights, does an excel-
lent job with a responsive cast. If you are
perhaps a little surprised at seeing Ethel
Lang hiding her usual dignity within a
flowered Chinese jacket and skin-fit
slacks, then get over your shock and
admire Clark’s unerring eye for right
casting, because Miss Lang brings off a
beautifully - observed, thoroughly pro-
fessional job. So, indeed, do Neva Carr-
Glyn (as a triumphantly hammy old
Granny) and Don Pascoe as Daddy.
Gwen Plumb achieves one minor riot
when, invited to take off her dress and
be comfortable, she goes into a bump-
and-grind strip. Take a lunch-hour off
and see it.
At the Old Tote you’ll see a “Ballad
of Angel’s Alley” that maybe its own
mother wouldn’t recognise. This tale of
the Melbourne pushes of the ’9os has
been translated into the Sydney Rocks
razor gangs—and the translation is just
a little uneasy.
Richard Campion’s superbly pro-
fessional and inventive production will
carry off any reservations you may have.

The Egghead Revolution
When knowledge became big business
By PETER COLEMAN
Compton’s Pictured Encyclopaedia.
15 Volumes. F. E. Compton and
Co.
Compared with the Encyclopaedia
Revolution in the 1950 s the famous
Paperback Revolution barely amounted
to, say, a small riot. During those years,
80,000 encyclopaedia canvassers spread
out across the United States with such
success that Americans now spend more
on encyclopaedias than on all kinds of
textbooks put together. Knowledge be-
came big business, and encyclopaedia
sales rose from s6om. in 1950 to s3oom.
in 1960. Some big encyclopaedia com-
panies such as the Grolier Society even
began to move over into the teaching
machine business and others have gone
into radio stations. Saturation point must
surely be reached in this decade, and
already the Revolution has spread from
America to Australia.
The usual criticism' of this Revolution
is that canvassers, advertisers and
businessmen have supplanted scholars in
the control of the encyclopaedias and
that this must mean a gradual fall-off in
standards. The first point is certainly
true: Formerly scholars usually ran the
encyclopaedia companies from A to Z;
job is scholarship, and the
editing, lay-out, binding, packaging, pro-
motion, sales and follow-up are in the
hands of experts.
But the point about falling standards
is not true. In fact most of the howlers
still in the main encyclopaedia date from
the days of complete scholars’ control:
until recently revised, for example, the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica’s” article on
the Malays, obviously written by some
colonial official straight out of “Passage
to India,” informed readers: “Their
courage is not high judged by European
standards . . . The sexual morality is
very lax.”
One of the main results of contempor-
ary competitiveness has been that all the
best encyclopaedias are now revised
annually (“Compton’s” have been doing
it since 1922) and even more fervent
attempts are made to recruit the greatest
scholars to write their chapters. (This
has not yet led to increased payments;
scholars are still so keen to have the
prestige of writing for the “Britannica”
that they still do it for a couple of cents
a word; Einstein, for example, got only
$68.50 for his article on Space-Time and
would get much the same today.) But it
is probably true now, despite all the
ballyhoo sales techniques, that encyclo-
paedias are better than they used to be.
The three giants are the “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica” (sloom. sales in
1960), Field Enterprises ($96m.), which
produces the “World Book Encyclo-
paedia,” and the Grolier Society (sBsm.),
which, incidentally, now owns and is re-
vising the “Australian Encyclopaedia”.
The E.B. has only recently become the
biggest in the world, having long been
second to “World Book”. Its weakness
used to be in the market for upper prim-
ary and high-school children. It had
the E.B. for adults and the “Britannica
Junior” for children, but nothing for the
in-betweens. Then in 1960 it filled the
gap by purchasing “Compton’s Pictured
Encyclopaedia” and put itself at the top.
Now “Compton’s” is on sale in Aus-
tralia.
I>ut how can one review an encyclo-
paedia like “Compton’s”? There are,
of course, some rules of thumb. You can
look up the American “Consumers Bul-
letin”, which recommends it. You can
also look up the respected “Wilson’s
Standard Catalog” for High School
Libraries and the American Library
Association's Booklet both of which
recommend it. Then there is the Hart
Chart of all major encyclopaedias, which
is accepted as thoroughly reliable and
which says “Compton’s” is “excellent
throughout”, “beautiful”, “one of the two
great leaders in its field” the other
being the E.B. (It also says it has 71
million words at $l6 per million words,
19,300 excellent illustrations and 7,600
colored maps and charts.)
The real test comes from personal
examination. One of the main claims of
“Compton's” is that, since it is written
for older children and high-school pupils
whose interests change and develop
quickly, there is a close co-ordination of
interest level and readability: in other
words, the chapter on arithmetic is
written in a style understandable by an
age-group younger than the group likely
to read the chapter on chemistry, and so
on. There is not the slightest doubt both
that this claim is true and the execution
is excellent.
It is obviously an American encyclo-
paedia with different emphases and pre-
judices (and spelling) from the prejudices
of British encyclopaedias. Browsing, for
example, through the WXYZ volume to
read something on Yugoslavia and
Skopje, the earthquake town, I was irri-
tated to get three pages on Yugoslavia
in a volume which contains 18 pages on
West Virginia and Washington, 17 on
Wisconsin and 16 on Wyoming.
But this sort of thing is inevitable in
any overseas encyclopaedia, and in any
case (if this is a relevant test) it is far
better on Australia than most overseas
encyclopaedias. But it means that if you
want facts and figures about, say, Aus-
tralian lizards or ticks or birds or flora
you must still consult Australian reference
books.
Most of us, however, find some time
for an interest in the rest of the world,
and while the advice of the American
“Consumers Bulletin” that “a 25 cent
pocket book warmly applied to the seat
of Junior's pants ort occasion might do
more good than a $2OO encyclopaedia
applied to the bookshelf” is sound, any
enquiring older child would find “Comp-
ton’s” an ideal encyclopaedia.
The lay-out, typography and style are
excellent and the indexes in each volume
are superb. The child must still be
warned, of course, that most “knowledge”
is only good for 10 years and it doesn’t
do to read old encyclopaedias which
is perhaps why it’s just as well business-
men are now in charge instead of
scholars: they keep the scholars on their
toes.

story reaches the North Pole; liquid-air
turbines drive ships, though with sail
still an important auxiliary; there are
motor cars, but little use is made of
them, for a long journey the author
always gets up steam in a railway engine;
telephones exist, but not, of course,
radio. There is a period quality about
the fantasy, too. Aldous Huxley was
right when he made Ford and Freud and
Frazer the prophets of the Brave New
World. A contemporary writer could
not, unselfconsciously, commit himself
to the latter half of “The Purple Cloud”.
The Robinson Crusoe fantasy is
anarchic and egocentric: it gives the “I”
absolute power without responsibility.
When the fantasy is submitted to the
test of reality—as with the boys freed
from adult authority in Golding’s “Lord
of the Flies” it breaks down. Shiel’s
fantasy is not tested in this way: he finds
always the provisions he needs; the
millions of bodies are “somehow” pre-
served from rapid decomposition and
he is safe from disaster in storm and
earthquake. His “I” whose name is
Adam—takes to wearing Oriental clothes
and smoking hashish; he devotes the best
part of seventeen years to building a
temple of solid gold and silver on an
Aegean island, with a pool and a
fountain of wine. For a vacation every
now and then he goes off in his
millionaire’s yacht and burns down and
blows up one of the great deserted cities
of the world. After the destruction of
Byzantium Adam finds his Eve, naked
and without speech, having spent her life
from birth in a deep cellar sealed against
the deadly purple cloud of eighteen years
ago, where she has lived on dried dates
and weak white wine. At first he resents
her, rejects her, ill-treats her, but she
pursues him with dreadful devotion for
years while he refuses her because he
does not think the human race fit to
continue. At last consummation comes,
but even when all the rest of the world
has been dead for eighteen years Adam
is only capable of intercourse in the
pathological privacy of a boat in the
middle of the sea and even then he
locks the cabin door.
For us, the connection between aggres-
siveness and sexual frustration is a
commonplace, and “The Purple Cloud”
may seem astonishingly naive in its ideas.
It is still worth reading because, what-
ever the origins of the fantasy, it is
developed with sufficient skill and
urgency to be convincing and exciting,
at least for a good deal of the time. And
it would be naive of us to suppose that
the urge to anarchy and self-destruction
were nothing but a displacement of
sexual energy.
“A Voyage To Arcturus” is a dif-
ferent, kind of fantasy. Shiel lapses now
and then into a vaguely Manichean
system of opposed “dark” and “light”
forces controlling the world: David
Lindsay has a much more developed and
rigorous system and his book is almost
an allegory. Perhaps it is completely
an allegory which I don’t understand,
but there is a surrealist quality about the
events, particularly the ease with which
extra limbs and extra senses are grown
and discarded, which is disturbing. I can
neither explain the fantasy of “A Voyage
To Arcturus” nor yet explain it away,
as one can to some extent “The Purple
Cloud”. In so far as I do understand
(with the help of the preface) the ideas
behind the allegory I reject them: the
suggestion that all our experience of
pleasure and beauty is misleading and
corrupting, and that truth can only be
approached through pain and rejection,
I find perverse in the extreme. But the
planet is called Tormance (say that
quickly) and the blue sun which is just
set behind the Ifdawn Marest is called
Allpain. Maskull, the hero, is seeking
the true light of Muspel, but finds only
the false appearances of Chrystalman,
the shadow, whose real nature appears
only in the death of his victims, when
the face wears a “vulgar, sordid, bestial
grin, which casts a cold shadow of moral
nastiness into every heart”.
TTowever it is understood, “A Voyage
A To Arcturus”, which first appeared
in 1920, has a remarkable power. It has
the imaginative coherence combined with
repeated logical shocks of “Alice In
Wonderland” but in a realm of physical
violence that was tabu to Lewis Carroll.
Mountains rise and sink without warning,
sexual union is the destruction of one of
the partners, predatory flying monsters
can be made to destroy themselves by an
act of the will; physical violence itself
loses interest when by a strong will your
opponent can be “sorbed” obliged to
give up his own spirit and personality.
Lindsay can persuade us of the existence
of new colors, new senses, and even of a
new sex, all in a landscape of savage
contrast: blood-red desert and burning
sun, mountains covered in green snow,
forest trees a thousand feet high. It is
the landscape of a remarkable mind.
“Medusa” seems to me an altogether
slighter work: almost an academic
exercise in late seventeenth-century pas-
tiche. The style of the traveller’s tale
is well maintained, but the adventure
itself seems to have little meaning. The
narrator as a child went with a stranger
who befriended him on a journey to
ransom a lost son from pirates. There
are minor adventures before the pirate
ship is found deserted except by a single
man who is struck dumb. All ends with
mermen and a sea-monster of the giant

squid type in the grand monster
economy size, which devours most of
the crew. Like the other two books, this
fantasy is anti-sensual, for when the
sailors are in the grip of the monster
they wear an expression of “abounding,
extravagant, and antic joy”. The
narrator, just before, had had a vision
of a creature that was “feminine but not
human ... of inexpressive alluring
strange softness”.
All three of these books are very well
written; I was scarcely ever troubled by
the slack phrase, the over-worn image,
the cliche. All provide continuous
interest in an exciting narrative. All
suggest, through their fantasy, something
faintly pathological. “A Voyage To

imaginative experience of great power,
if of dubious import.

HPhe onset of madness and how it must
appear from the inside looking out
is the theme of Mungo MacCallum s
magnificently written novel, “Son of
Mars.”
Child of an apparently unknown sol-
dier and an unmarried mother, Martin
Dewes is adopted by an ageing couple,
charitably housed in a brown suburban
prison and nourished on a fetid atmos-
phere of guilty righteousness and fire-
and-brimstone orthodoxy. Hating the
myth-mother who abandoned him,
despising the desiccated old man who is
a poor substitute for his “hero” father-
figure, Martin learns to love his hate and
nourishes it daily with a jealous delight.
The more he is betrayed at every point
by a conspiracy of the certifiably sane,
the more he evolves from a sandpapery
young chap with a chip on his shoulder
into a homicidal lunatic, retreating back-
wards in a catatonic dream.
A European artist and designer,
Marian Laszlo, is for a time ready to
share her weekends and her bed with the
“Bible of Facts” traveller Dewes, but
withholds herself and complete involve-
ment. Both she and Dr. Holland, the
psychiatrist, ultimately discover the truth
about Martin’s real parentage but both
in their own way fail him, as he would
wish them to fail him. Because, deprived
of his hate, he would stand naked and
ashamed. So Martin is abandoned to his
madness like the octopus he had once
seen caught and turned inside out and
left writhing against the rocks.
The background is Sydney, in all its
beautiful ugliness, and the lavish green
volcano of Mt. and I can think
of no writer who has succeeded in weld-
ing together the beauty of the nature-
made and the ugliness of the man-made
into the quintessence of Australia as
Mungo MacCallum has done in this
book.
In a gently ironic foreword to “Their
Most Serene Majesties” the Greek au-
thor asks his readers to believe it is an
original 12th-century text written by one
Demetrius, an official of the Byzantine
Court under three Emperors, John, Man-
uel and Andronicus. Demetrius then
takes over, relating the final chapter first
which chronicles the detailed torture of
ex-Emperor Andronicus, the last of the
Comneni, in which few of the gory
minutiae are omitted. One conjectures
that Ange Vlachos has conjured up his
ghostly writer partly for his ability to
report the many atrocities of his con-
temporaries with remarkably passionless
detachment, and partly for the sake of
his own extraordinary personal interview
with the Devil.
The galaxy of figures seems at first as
remote and unyielding as any glittering
Byzantine mosaic, but slowly, after some
tedious unravelling, they begin to come
alive. The Crusades are ruthlessly shown
up as a grim farce for fools and oppor-
tunists; the Franks and Germans are
seen as the barbarians they then were;
the chessboard of plottings and counter-
plottings of international politics often
seem strangely familiar indeed; the worthy
Manuel, under the heady drug of des-
potic power, changes into a raging tyrant,
plucking eyes as indiscriminately as
autumn grapes, and pulling the pillars of
his dying world about him as he falls.
In perhaps the most astonishing chap-
ter of all, Demetrius describes how the
Devil appears to him as he sits alone one
night reading the book of Genesis. This
visitation is not remarkable in itself. The
Devil was always turning up in the
Middle Ages. But Demetrius, a not un-
willing Faust, carries the heresies they
discuss to a conclusion which, even for
Goethe, the freethinker, would have
been impossible in his own time.
This book does not fit into the usual
category of historical fiction, because of
the restrictions the author has deliberately
imposed on himself. Nor is it undiluted
history. It falls between the two, with the
virtues and faults of both. It is the first
work by Vlachos to be translated into
English and probably its main value is
to show the period not from the usual
Western Christian aspect but from the
Eastern one centred on the City of Con-
stantine.
“The Fast of the Whitfields” is an-
other of those adolescent I-views of life,
this time from a glasshouse (not by Sal-
inger and Co.) in the darkest South of
the USA. Felicia Whitfield, aged 13,
while ostensibly relating with the expec-
ted mixture of precocity and wide-eyed
innocence the harrowing experiences of
older brother Arthur as he flounders
towards the Age of Transgression, man-
ages in the same breath to slip in some
really insidious honey-toned pieces of
subtle propaganda about the poor
maligned Southerners and their devotion
for their dear old colored retainers
(providing, of course, they sit up nicely
when they beg, and never, never bite).

Mrs. Sanguinetti, daughter of Col. and
Mrs. Harry Mell Ayes of Alabama, often
seems to be attempting vindication of the
South’s Nigger segregationist policy as
against the championship of Negroes by
those uncouth Northerners for some dark
purposes of their own.
For anyone who has ever wondered
how the South can think as the South
does, this book abounds with interesting
hints. The fairest young flowers of the
Southern States those that bloom on
the oldest family tree still in the
1960 s mean the Civil War when they
say “the War”, still talk about “Mother’s
renegade cousin” (renegade because he
works in New York), still often curtsey
when introduced, are prepared for life

Carleton’s America is another country

a newly-married pair, Matthew and Callie
Soames, settle on a farm in Missouri and
produce four daughters. Fifty years later,
when the story ends, Callie has still not
learnt to read but there is little about
life and living and her own self that she
has not examined and understood. She
encourages her husband to go back to
school, viz., to become a school-teacher
accepting that she is widening a gulf
between them. And when Matthew strays
she makes no fuss: “That’s what men
hoped you would do ... It gave them
something to hold against you.” She waits
for him to get over it like “a spring
cold.”
Callie’s daughters, all with ideas of
their own, all products of a strict, almost
puritanical upbringing, escape into dif-
ferent worlds, but return every summer
when the moonflower vine performs its
brief white miracle all except Mathy
who escaped too far and whose birth and
death form the book’s centre of gravity.

“T ove Let Me Not Hunger” is an-
other delectable fairy tale by Paul
GallicO. It was probably inevitable that
he should write a circus story and now
that he has written one, it proves to be
his best work to date. An English circus
touring Spain is struck by a series of
natural disasters with the result that the
Big Top is burned to the ground. Five
people stay behind to look after the
animals and the story is mainly con-
cerned with what befalls them. The most
powerful episodes in the book are those
involving the monstrous but pitiable
Marquesa de Posoblanca near whose
property the circus is stranded. Mr
Albert, the animal man, finds favor with
her by his inadvertent clowning and in
his only deliberate effort brings her a
kind of salvation. But apart from these,
one could mention a dozen more brilliant
scenes —the weird little dwarf slaughter-
ing a horse, in the middle of the night,
to feed his starving dogs; Rose, despair-
ing of Toby’s love, giving herself to the
elephant who hates women . . . This is a
book to treasure.
The bulk of “The Winter People” is
made up of a journal written by John
Parr who recounts his discovery of a
strange, hibernating race in the Andes.
As an adventure story it is not very im-
pressive. The details of the physiology
and culture of the Winter People are not
especially interesting (and the dry,
academic style does little to enliven
them), while the slowness of the ex-
position is rather irritating.
“An Ordinary Lunacy” has little to
engage the heart or mind. It is certainly
not “a novel of spiritual values and moral
judgments” as the preposterous and
wildly inarticulate synopsis claims. The
central story concerns a rising barrister
and the beautiful, enigmatic woman he
improbably falls in love with. The
woman’s husband is found dead and she
is arrested on suspicion of murder. The
barrister quickly obtains her acquittal
and they begin a curiously passionless
love affair that ends in her suicide. The
events are said to take place in Sydney
but there is no attempt to evoke the city.
It figures here by name only.
Victor Zagon, the hero of Mr Peter-
kiewicz’s novel, has led a life that is
packed with incident but he describes
it with a consistent understatement that
makes his story not only exciting but
extremely moving. His friendship with
Leon, his colorful lovemaking with
Florentina, his near ordination in a
prison camp for Polish priests, his final
encounter with Marko, all acquire in this
way a truly poetic intensity.
The book is divided up with remark-
able symmetry: four parts, each con-
taining five chapters. This symmetry
reflects the narrator’s restraint but also
emphasises his progressive maturity with
each episode in his life culminating in the
interview with his Angel.

Olims Consolidated Limited
by Mr J. Olims, Chairman ,
Address to Shareholders of the Company
at the Annual General Meeting 30th September, 1963
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to pre-
sent this year’s Directors’ Report and
Balance Sheets, illustrating your
Company’s progress for the year
ended 30th June, 1963.
The profit for the year is highly
satisfactory and reflects, as in the
past, the strictly planned and executed
steady development of the profit-earn-
ing capacity of the organisation.
The several new members who
joined the Group over the past twelve
months have presented no integration
problems and have contributed their
full share to the overall development.
The careful pre-selection of suitable
additional Companies has now
produced a most cohesive structure of
an industry geared for service and
development in the most important
sphere of top management, in Govern-
ment, Commerce and Industry.
The interlocking divisions operating
within the organisation are:—
1. Business Machines Computers,
Calculators, Coin Sorting, Wrapping
and Counting Machines, Ticket
Issuing Machines.
2. Office Equipment—Steel Furniture,
Filing and Systems Installations.
3. Electronics Micro Electronic,
Telecommunication, Special TV and
Audio Systems.
4. Reprographic Photocopying,
Microfilming, Offset Printing and
Plan Printing Equipment.
5. Engineering Paper Converting
Machinery, Air Compressors and
Spray Equipment, Revolving Signal
and Timing Units.
6. Chemical Photographic Sensi-
tized Papers, Plan Printing
Materials and Chemical Developers.
7. Export & Import Products
manufactured by the Group and
Associated Members.
Each Division has its own manu-
facturing, wholesaling and retailing
outlets, enjoying jointly with other
members the services of Group
Administration, Research and Finance.
The year 1963 can be considered as
an important milestone in the develop-
ment of Australian Industry in gene-
ral, and in your Company’s activity
in particular.
The new factors contributing to the
great future potential of our activities
are as follows:
1. The re-orientation of Australian
Trade policy, following the new
Trade Pact with Japan based on
a closer co-operation between our
two countries. The mutual interests
and geographical position must
create a natural goodwill and a
very greatly increased trade rela-
tionship.
2. The advent of true Micro Elec-
tronics, which will revolutionise our
ways of life in offices, factories and
homes.
3. The final fixing of the decimal con-
version date by the Government in
Australia.
If you closely peruse the structure
of your Company, you will find that
your Directors have followed a pat-
tern of planning which fits these new
developments and ensures that our
Group members will remain ahead of
their respective fields.
The close ties with Japan were
cemented through the joint-ventui'e
Company of Olims-Hayakawa Elec-
tronics Pty Ltd with the Hayakawa
Electric Co. Ltd of Japan, and the sole
Australian and New Zealand Agency
and Distribution arrangements for the
world renowned “Sharp” products.
Additional agencies and joint-ventures
with Japanese manufacturers are at
present being negotiated and will
further contribute to Australian-
Japanese co-operation, based on
mutual respect and friendship.
The establishment of our Group
Micro Electronic Research and
Development Division has already
placed your Company to the forefront
in this latest development of Elec-
tronics.
The Business Machines, Office
Equipment and Reprographic Divi-
sions have been geared with their im-
porting, local manufacturing and
servicing facilities to fully participate
in the conversion and supply of deci-
mal currency equipment.
Our Chemical and Heavy Engineer-
ing Divisions, largely connected with
paper converting machinery, photo-
copying and sensitized papers and
developers, are progressing with our
planned expansion and contributing
their full share of profits to the Group
as a whole.
The new Export Division, which has
already established most valuable con-
tacts overseas, should be responsible
for a considerable increase in our ex-
ports, centralising this activity which
was previously handled by individual
members.
Two new factories erected at
Caringbah and one at St Peters will
be contributing their share in this
coming financial year. Two valuable
Freehold Properties at William Street,
Sydney; one Freehold Store in Sussex
Street, Sydney; a valuable leasehold
site in King Street, Sydney, and en-
larged leasehold premises in Mel-
bourne, Victoria, are providing show-
rooms and service depots in most cen-
tral positions. A network of specially
selected retail distributors, with full
servicing facilities available through-
out Australia, further assures the
speedy and efficient distribution of
your Company’s products.
DIVIDEND POLICY:
The changed circumstances, due to
a major shift of your Company’s pro-
ducts from relatively slow-moving
stock, based largely on imports, to
increased locally manufactured goods,
has allowed our working capital to be
turned over faster than before, result-
ing in higher profitability.
Another important factor is the
greatly increased number of small
Shareholders who rely on Dividends
as a source of income.
Your Directors, therefore, have given
serious consideration to a possible in-
crease of the Dividend rate from 12i%
to 15% per annum, depending upon
the assured continuation of the in-
creased profit trend manifested over
the past six months, and more par-
ticularly in this current financial year.
For this reason, a Dividend Equalisa-
tion Reserve has been created, as
stated in the present Balance Sheet.
The increase in Dividend will in no
way interfere with the policy regard-
ing Bonus Issues, as reported at last
year’s Annual General Meeting in my
address to Shareholders.
Your Company is now right in the
forefront of the new development
techniques of Micro Electronics, as
applied to Computers, Closed Circuit
Television, Telecommunication Equip-
ment and many other phases of Com-
merce, without having committed our-
selves to the highly competitive field
of the Domestic Appliance Industry.
I am sure our products will be so
much more appreciated by a public
knowing that they represent specialist
made instruments, rather than mass
produced articles that require a pro-
hibitive amount of advertising and
other inducements to be sold.
I wish to thank my fellow Directors
and the Executives and Members of
the Staff for the excellent work per-
formed within the Group.
I also wish to express my deeply
felt appreciation to the Shareholders
for their support and many friendly
letters received during the past year.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Don’t Knock The Dollar
President Kennedy told the International Monetary Fund
last week that every nation had a direct interest in main-
taining the strength of the dollar. Doubtless he raised a
few hackles when he said it. But it’s true, nevertheless.
If the dollar collapses the western world could experience
a good old-fashioned depression.
There are some who criticise the American colonisation
system, modern-style, with tied loans, dollar bribery not to
go Red, and a vested interest in the development of un-
developed nations. But they can-
not deny that the strength of the
dollar . . . and the hard work of
the American taxpayers who
stand behind the dollar... is a
vital influence in world finance
today.
J.F.K., of course, is defend-
ing his new tax on US invest-
ments abroad, which makes it
harder for foreign borrowers
to raise loans in the US. The
Interest Equalisation Tax, of 15
p.c., also makes it more expen-
sive for US investors to purchase
foreign stocks.
Speculators who have been
buying gold in recent years,
based on the assumption that
the US eventually must devalue
the dollar by increasing the price
of gold, received a setback when President Kennedy said he
was determined to maintain the current gold price of 35 US
dollars an ounce. They must sit back now and see if the
latest US measures will close the balance-of-payments gap.
While the US strives to close the gap, it is apparent that
any American dollar stringency must create balance-of-pay-
ments problems for other nations. President Kennedy warned
that, as the US moved towards equilibrium with its balance
of payments, it would be more difficult for others to increase
their reserves.
The natural reaction for those “other” nations (which are
confronted with a deterioration in their balance of payments)
is to tighten their financial policies, slash imports and gener-
ally to take restrictive measures against countries like the USA.
Anticipating this, President Kennedy argued that no nation
should be forced to make drastic alterations in its domestic
and trading policies because of short-run movements in its
reserve position. For this reason, he promised that good old
Uncle Sam stood ready to support such measures as may be
necessary to increase international liquidity.
America recognises that a greater volume of world trade
is necessary to sustain current world production levels. Also
it recognises that more finance is needed to support a healthy
volume of trade. Otherwise the problem of over-production
could lead to recessions (or “economic setbacks” if we must
find a polite label for it).
But it’s a case of don’t do as I do, do as 1 say! Small nations
naturally have reason to be afraid that a rapidly worsening
deficit, if unheeded and unchecked, may never be reversed.
It’s like the story of certain Australian finance companies
which in 1960 tried to borrow their way out of trouble.
Everything looked rosy while public monies could be borrowed
at high rates of interest and maturing debentures were renewed
and rotated. But when the pres-
sure for repayment occurred,
the internal weaknesses were
revealed.
America thus has a sales pro-
motion job on its hands to con-
vince smaller nations that they
should ignore a run-down in
their financial situation and
keep buying goods from Uncle
Sam while he puts his own bal-
ance-of-payments house in order.
Meanwhile, Australia’s
Treasurer, Mr Harold Holt (who
is still keen to borrow dollars
abroad), has been quick to
point out to US Treasury
Secretary Mr Douglas Dillon
that Australia is not hurting the
US balance-of-payments with
its borrowing. Its volume of im-
ports from America actually increased while it was borrow-
ing money on the New York capital market and, in fact,
61 p.c. of one dollar loan raised in New York was supplied
by Europe.
A Scramble for the
Food Markets
There is a season for all things, including a spot of weeping
by small grocers when they scan the annual results of
the big retail groups now being published. David Jones,
Myer, Grace Brothers and the other big-gun entries in the
supermarket and food retailing business have all left their mark.
But the rapid growth in chain retailing of food is even more
potently illustrated in the results of G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd,
which was a late starter in the supermarket stakes.
Sales of “variety” merchandise still represents 63 p.c. of
Coles’ annual sales of £9B million, but food is rising steadily
and accounted for 36 p.c. of total sales in 1962-63.
The food business is keenly competitive and (on Coles’
figures) accounts for only 20 p.c. of total profits compared with
71 p.c. from variety sales. An analysis of retail profits before


tax (excluding income from property and wholesaling) shows
that food lines represent only about 22.1 p.c of retail profits.
Gross profit margins on variety sales are said to average
around 27 p.c., while gross margins on food average only 13i
p.c. Turnover of food lines, however, is much faster and the
food buyer also spends money on variety merchandise while
visiting the store.
Coles hastened slowly in this field, possibly hoping the others
would fall on their faces, and is still trailing its major com-
petitor, Woolworths, whose annual sales are now estimated at
around £120m., of which possibly £4Bm. is represented by food.
Combined annual sales of Woolworths and Coles, at £218m.,
represent an annual expenditure by every Australian man,
woman and child of £2O per head, of which about £7 11s. is
on food.
Expenditure on food naturally will increase. That’s why
there is a lot of jostling in the trade, with overseas food manu-
facturing companies anxious to gain a share in the fast-growing
Australian market. International Packers (through its subsi-
diary Swift Australian Co. Pty Ltd) has made a £2!m cash
offer for Mayfair Hams Ltd. This is only one of many take-
over bids in recent years.
Unilever and Peters (Victoria) Ltd have been active with
takeovers in preparation for the food war and the ranks have
thinned considerably. Rosella was the latest food processing
group to be called up a few months ago. Huttons and Ama-
graze issued merger signals in September.
The message today is that bulk buying and economic distri-
bution, with a saving of overhead, is the key to staying solvent
in the food business.
The big chains are ideally placed to take advantage ot this
situation, but the fight to maintain profit margins suggests that
bigger squeezes are in prospect, particularly in the light of
projected wage increases in 1964 ... a warning on which was
given recently by Mr Theo Kelly of Woolworths. The battle
for turnover will become more intense in the face of wage-
cost increases.
Gold Accessibility Flying
An Old Kite
hardened old campaigner for a rise in the price of gold,
Dr W. J. Busschau, chairman of Gold Fields of South
Africa, whose interests in Australian minerals exploration have
been greatly expanded in recent years, has been at it again,
this time at the American Mining Congress in Los Angeles.
In fact Dr Busschau has coined a new' phrase, “gold accessi-
bility.” This is not Afrikaanese, but simply another way of
expressing in terse English the ratio of the volume ot gold
to the total quantity of fiat money in the world.
With the IMF preoccupied in recent days with moves to
improve the liquidity of the international currency system,
the new phrase has an odd ring.
Dr Busschau tried to persuade the American Mining Con-
gress that because ot the sharp decline in gold accessibility
the world’s two major currencies, the dollar and sterling,
are uncovered. In other words, their external debts are bigger
than their gold reserves.
For this reason, Dr Busschau considers the price of gold
should be at least doubled, even counting in the international
credits currently available from the IMF as supplements to
the world’s gold stocks.
However, there is a slight flaw in his argument because
he neglects the fact that gold is not the only money acceptable
in international transactions (dollars and pounds are in fact
most acceptable themselves!) and also that credit is used uni-
versally across national currency frontiers to stretch out the
usefulness of the world’s current gold stocks.
Dr Busschau’s red herring doesn’t fool anybody, though
that isn’t to say a rise in the price of gold wouldn’t be a bles-
sing, especially to South Africa and, to a lesser extent, this
country.
One Technique For
Overseas Control
VTew Zealand’s only publicly owned oil exploration com-
pany, New Zealand Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd,
Wellington, has done a most unusual thing by announcing a
3-for-10 issue of ss. shares at a premium of sd. at a time when
the shares were 4d. to 6d. below par!
This almost assures that Americans, who already have a
majority interest, will completely dominate the company. For
under an underwriting agreement with Sanders and Co., Dallas,
Texas, this firm will buy for resale to Americans all of the
486,000 shares now being offered which are not taken up by
existing shareholders.
It looks as if the Dallas underwriters are going to get all
but a few of these shares.
The company was floated in March, 1962, as a joint New
Zealand-American venture, local capital joining a group of
Texas oil experts.
The original issue was of 1,200,000 shares, of which
1,132,200 has been allotted by June, the remainder to be
placed in America. Of these shares 472.100 were held in New
Zealand, 139,700 in Australia and 520,400 in the US. In
addition, 400,000 vendor shares were held by the Texans and
20,000 similar shares in New Zealand.
Many New Zealanders hold shares in Australian oil pros-
pectors and they seem quite prepared to pay current market
prices. But they soon lost patience with their own company,
despite an acceleration of the geological evaluation pro-
gramme. A year after the float the shares were selling at
4s. 3d. and then started to pick up slowly—one presumes on
overseas buying orders to 4s. Bd.
Meanwhile, interest had been created in the US. American
investors began to buy the majority of the Australian-held
shares and are believed to have bought also in New Zealand.
Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission
granted approval to trading in the shares and these are now
making a small premium in America.
It is likely that the original US partners will at some time
exercise an option of 400,000 shares and will also receive
400,000 in payment for drilling equipment.
The first well, at Hamilton, 80 miles south of Auckland,
spudded in on October 1.
It is understandable that directors want to raise as much
as they can in the issue. They were in the awkward position
of being able to get money from Americans, while even at
par an issue in New Zealand was likely to succeed only
partially.
Possibly, they could have boosted the current price of the
shares to par by better public and shareholder relations. But
by now insisting on a premium which even in Australia
would be regarded most unusual for a company which has
not yet even started to drill they are turning their New
Zealand shareholders against them.
Many hope that the Government will take measures to
keep at least part of the shares in New Zealand. But there seems
to be little it can do.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Warming Up on Wages
The Gauntlet Down on Cost-inflation Theories
TVoubtless Mr R. J. Hawke will grab
with both hands the ammunition
Professor G. K. Gifford has been piling
up in Brisbane to attack the wage-cost
inflationists at large in three-quarters of
the country’s university lecture rooms.
Gifford has thrown down the
gauntlet to his fellow academics to
debate the cost-inflation theory in the
hope that the Arbitration Commission
will thereby be convinced that raising
legal minimum wage rates does not
cause inflation.
One who might take him up on the
issue is Professor P. H. Karmel of
Adelaide were he not otherwise
strenuously engaged as a member of the
Government’s economic enquiry.
For in “The Australian Economy”, a
volume of readings edited by H. W.
Arndt and W. M. Corden, recently pub-
lished by F. W. Cheshire, Karmel (writing
in 1960) says that in the past few years
“award wages have undoubtedly been in-
creased beyond the capacity of the
economy to sustain at stable prices”.
One doesn’t know what Gifford has up
his sleeve on the score of theory or what
reservations he would put to his bald
assertion, but the empirical findings of
Karmel and others who have studied the
upward progression of the basic wage
and the results for real wages over the
last half century suggest he will have to
do some extra hard talking.
By coincidence, perhaps, Gifford’s chal-
lenge came on the eve of the conference
in Brisbane of the Australian Council of
Employers’ Associations, who, mindful
of the approaching basic wage case next
February, declared that an entirely new
approach was required to wage fixing
here.
They want to get away from the pre-
sent system of fixing a basic wage, which
they say nobody actually receives, and
propose that the basis should be wages
actually paid by individual industries, in-
cluding present margins.
Between now and next February one
would expect the wages ground to be
covered pretty thoroughly in public dis-
cussion and as background for this every-
body concerned should study the analy-
sis made by Karmel in “The Australian
Economy,” not only because it sets out
the practical and theoretical aspects but
also points to the fundamental changes
needed in the attitudes of the range of
interests involved.
Professor Karmel’s message to the
trade unions is no less apposite than it
was three years ago. He thinks they
should recognise that nothing is to be
gained by pushing up money wages faster
than the capacity of the economy to pay
(this is where we came in and where
Professor Gifford might well go out).
Again, the trade unions ought to re-
orient their method of approach to their
general aim of achieving a more even dis-
tribution of income and wealth, by re-
directing their efforts from the field of
wages towards that of Government
policy. Alas, the trade unions abjectly
refuse to lift their thinking to the level
where they could cut any ice in the com-
plicated economic circumstances with
which Government policy has to take
account. Outmoded bogeymen still dic-
tate the line of approach.
Myopic trade union attitudes also mili-
tate against another of Karmel’s require-
ments for a rational wages policy, the
recognition that the Commonwealth
Government should make an unequivocal
presentation to the Arbitration Commis-
sion of its views on wage cases (the recent
ACTU congress bluntly accused the
Federal Government of trying to control
wages through its interventions in cases
before the Commission).
17'armel goes close to saying that the
Commission would have to give
tacit recognition to the Federal Govern-
ment’s economic objectives. “When we
speak of a wages policy for Australia we
must mean a wages policy implemented
by the Arbitration Commission; this im-
plies that the Commission should make
its decisions within the framework of
general economic policy considerations
rather than with the object of settling in-
dustrial disputes per se . . . in practice
the implementation of a conscious wages
policy by the Commission would require
the Commonwealth Government to lay
down to the Commission those objectives
of economic policy to which the Com-
mission should address itself. Moreover
these cannot be laid down in general
terms. The priority of weighting in im-
portance of possibly conflicting objec-
tives would also have to be specified.”
This means that the Commonwealth
Government must be prepared to inter-
vene in basic wage, leading margins and
hours cases to inform the Commission of
its policy objectives, and to assist the
Commission in assessing the economic
situation and the consequences on it of
the Commission’s actions. Not only this,
but the Commonwealth Government
would have to take a definite stand on
the issues before the Commission.
The Commission itself has no direct
control over the level of aggregate de-
mand, and it is, therefore, above all,
necessary for the Commonwealth
Government to take steps to avoid excess
demand. This does not imply that it
should so restrain demand as to remove
all pressures for wage increases on the
Commission; for such restraint might im-
ply an appreciable measure of unem-
ployment and hence directly conflict with
one or more of the accepted objectives of
economic policy.
Karmel is equally emphatic on the
need for employers’ organisations to re-
cognise that small but regular wage in-
creases in relation to productivity are
both “normal and justifiable”. Moreover
to ensure the forces of competition are
allowed free play in pricing he makes out
a case for getting employers to be more
competitive in price and for action by
the Government to implement and vigor-
ously police an anti-monopolies and re-
strictive practices programme (so Pro-
fessor Alex Hunter is not alone in his
advocacies on this score among the
professors).
Apart from the acceptance of its role
in the implementation of general econo-
mic policy, for the Commission itself
Karmel’s main requirement is that it
should accept the critical importance of
productivity in determining wages, that is
the gearing of money wages to produc-
tivity or what he calls the gearing prin-
ciple.
One could remove a major difficulty in
getting this done, he says, by integrating
basic wage and leading margins cases.
“The split in the determination of the
general level of wages makes it necessary
for the Commission' to treat as two separ-
ate issues what in fact is one issue. A
higher basic wage does reduce the capa-
city of the economy to pay higher mar-
gins and the two elements in the wages
structure cannot be treated independ-
ently”.
However (and here the need for more
competitive pricing comes in), adherence
to the gearing principle will ensure the
variation of real wages with productivity,
the constancy of labor’s share in national
income and the absence of wage inflation,
provided and only provided that the aver-
age percentage gross profit margin re-
mains constant, and only so long as a
balance is struck between falling prices
of products in industries where produc-
tivity has increased more than average
(competition will alone ensure this) and
rising prices for products of industries
whose productivity has risen less than
average.


Political Principles and Party
Programmes
Guidance From The Liberal Tradition
By ROGER RANDERSON
A modern re-statement of the
principles that should guide
economic policy, with the aim of
preserving liberty and promoting free
growth and spontaneous evolution, does
not come too soon to Australia, where
the political centre of gravity has
shifted to the Left and it is no longer
easy to distinguish the position of the
Liberal and Country Parties from that
of the Labor Party.
Professor Hayek’s work, “The Con-
stitution of Liberty”, helps to resolve
many perplexities for thoughtful students
of local politics.
And it may even provide the argu-
ments for changes in policy, after the
usual lapse of time between the dis-
semination of ideas and their application.
The book deals with universal ten-
dencies. These are nowadays rapidly
copied in Australia, partly because of our
large and increasing overseas connec-
tions and the swift communication of
ideas, but also because local intellectual
thought tends to be standardised and has
a large impact on a generally unreflec-
tive community.
While Professor Hayek’s message is
primarily addressed to the leaders of
thought among academic lawyers and
economists because ‘‘the arguments
that have undermined liberty belong
mainly to the intellectual sphere” the
politician and general reader will specially
welcome the third part of the book,
which applies his criteria to current
practical problems.
Since it is true, as he states, that “The
liberal today must more positively
oppose some of the basic conceptions
which most conservatives share with the
socialists,” it is not a bad idea to begin
by reading his final chapter, “Why I Am
Not A Conservative”, which appears as
a postscript to his argument.
In Australia as in other countries “the
conservatives have tended to follow the
socialist rather than the liberal direction
and have adopted at appropriate intervals
of time those ideas made respectable by
radical propaganda.
“It has been regularly the conservatives
who have compromised with socialism
and stolen its thunder.
“Advocates of the middle way with no
goal of their own, conservatives have
been guided by the belief that the truth
must lie somewhere between the extremes
with the result that they have shifted
their position every time a more extreme
movement appeared on either wing.”
Banking policy under the Menzies
Government affords an illustration of
this. Elected in 1949 to prevent the
banks being nationalised and to en-
courage free enterprise banking subject
to central bank regulation, most
academic economists and many ad-
ministrators originally appointed by the
previous Labor Government had dif-
ferent ideas.
T argely as the result of pressure
through the more conservative
Country Party element of the Federal
Coalition Government, the banking
system has been distorted beyond recog-
nition since 1949. Banking companies
have until recently been savagely repress-
ed, and, despite the greater trading
latitude at present allowed, existing
legislation still leaves them vulnerable to
similar suppression in the future.
Meanwhile, the Menzies Government
is continuing to encourage the expansion
of a vast apparatus of Government banks,
some of which it has created, using for
the purpose earnings diverted from the
banking companies and surplus receipts
from revenue.
It is little wonder that the Labor
Opposition no longer presses for the
nationalisation of banking by the method
it unsuccessfully tried between 1947 and
1949 of acquiring the shares of bank-
ing companies on just terms.
As an immediate political aim, the
Labor Opposition is content to rely on
existing legislation and the continuance,
and perhaps intensification, of present
policies.
It is obvious that the logical end of
such policies can only be a society
centrally controlled through a regimented
banking system, especially since the
banks, to maintain their earnings, are
now closely linked with hire-purchase
and investment institutions.
But there is at present no active
pressure for banking reform either from
the banking companies or sections of the
public, although the latter are acutely
conscious of increased charges that have
largely resulted from the needless
duplication of facilities.
Socialism in the strict sense of the
nationalisation of the “means of pro-
duction, distribution, and exchange” as
a particular method of achieving social
justice is now dead as a political policy
in the Western world.
But, as Hayek points out, socialists
still wish to manipulate the economy by
increasing governmental control of what
nominally remains private industry. By
this means they can more easily achieve
the redistribution of incomes which had
been the real aim of their more spec-
tacular policy of expropriation.
Much of the ballyhoo from academic
circles against so-called monopoly and
restrictive practices in Australia is
inspired by nothing better than envy.
Yet it has influenced a Federal
Government, which, despite its party
name, can only in this respect be regard-
ed as “conservative,” to propose most
dangerously oppressive legislation.
Although Sir Garfield Barwick’s
scheme should properly be regarded as
extremely socialistic legislation, it has
been wrongly presented as necessary to
preserve a free enterprise system, which
is the essential economic basis for
personal liberty.
So little is this understood that I have
even been called an “extremist,” by one
or two people with whom I otherwise
share many of the same political
attitudes, for arguing that the Govern-
ment’s restrictive trade plan should be
abandoned instead of merely whittled
down a little.
The proposed legislation is extreme,
not the arguments derived from liberal
principles that I have presented against
it. Liberalism is essentially a humble and
moderate doctrine.
“It is sometimes regarded as unfair,
as blind conservative prejudice,” Hayek
recognises, “to criticise those socialist
leaders who have so frankly abandoned
the more obviously totalitarian forms of
‘hot’ socialism, for having now turned to
a ‘cold’ socialism.” But the latter in
effect may not be very different from
the former.
Defenders of liberty today have a new
and more difficult task of discriminating
between some of the aims of the “welfare

state” that can be realised without
detriment to individual liberty and
“others particularly dear to the hearts
of the socialists that cannot be realised
in a society that wants to preserve
personal freedom”.
All people concerned with current
practical problems of government will
find instruction in chapters 18 to 24 of
Hayek’s book, which deal with Labor
Unions and Employment, Social Security,
Taxation and Redistribution, The Mone-
tary Framework, Housing and Town
Planning, Agriculture and Natural
Resources, Education and Research.
Many of Australia’s economic prob-
lems have been accentuated, if not largely
caused, by excessive increases in wages,
such as those which occurred in 1951
and 1959.
But few people even among our intel-
lectual leaders, and least of all our
Ministers for Labor, have pointed out,
as Hayek does, the tendency of such
wage movements to cause unemploy-
ment. Nor have they stressed the in-
justice that trade unions cause to their
weaker brethren by pressure for wage
rates that restrict opportunities for
employment.
“Full employment” is an article of
faith with all political parties, but it
involves in practice the misuse of mone-
tary and fiscal policies to counteract the
threat to employment from excessive
wages.
In a succinct paragraph, Hayek reveals
the intellectual sources of the full
employment policy of the “Keynesian”
type.
“The development of Lord Keynes’s
theories”, he states, “started from the cor-
rect insight that the regular cause of
extensive unemployment is real wages
that are too high.
“The next step consisted in the cor-
rect insight that a direct lowering of
money wages could be brought about
only by a struggle so painful and pro-
longed that it could not be contemplated.
“Hence he concluded that real wages
must be lowered by the process of lower-
ing the value of money.”
We have the authority of this un-
doubted master in the field of economics
for the proposition that “ Governments
everywhere and at all times have been
the cause of the depreciation of the cur-
rency."
It is to the lasting credit of the
Menzies Government, in my opinion,
that in 1960 it finally came to grips with
the problem of inflation. Some of the
measures taken were ill-advised but most
of them have since been dropped, and
the general effect has been beneficial.
The Government deserved greater
support from the business community
and intellectuals than it received for the
restoration of stability to the value of
our money. It has led to a strengthening
of the country’s external position and of
the foundations for economic progress
far into the future.
Pressure from some quarters for
greater Budget deficits than we have seen,
for the restoration of general licensing
of imports, for central planning of pro-
duction and “incomes policy” would
never have been supported by business-
men if they had understood the drift of
such proposals.
“It is no accident,” Hayek states, “that
inflationary policies are generally advo-
cated by those who want more govern-
ment control though, unfortunately,
not by them alone.
“The increased dependence of the
individual upon government which in-
flation produces and the demand for
more government action to which this
leads may for the socialist be an argu-
ment in its favor.
“Those who wish to preserve freedom
should recognise, however, that inflation
is probably the most important single
factor in that vicious circle wherein one
kind of government action makes more
and more government control necessary.”
The chapter on Social Security will be
of widespread interest, because it applies
the cold light of reason to the many
popular baits that are dangled before
voters by all parties at election time.
There should be less support from
Liberals for abolition of the “means
test” for services which are supposed to
be based on need, if the argument is
understood.
While we have gone a long way to-
wards the conquest of the four giants of
disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness
in creating the welfare state of the
Beveridge report, we are, as Hayek points
out, adopting remedies that threaten the
future growth of wealth so that further
progress in this direction will be
restricted.
New giants are being raised by some
of the remedies adopted, such as “infla-
tion, paralysing taxation, coercive labor
unions, an ever-increasing dominance of
government in education and a social

service bureaucracy with far-reaching
powers.”
“Taxation and Redistribution” is the
most controversial chapter of the book,
but it goes to the heart of problems that
threaten productiveness and the main-
tenance of a liberal democratic society.
There is no satisfying intellectual jus-
tification for the extremes to which pro-
gressive taxation has been carried, intensi-
fied by inflation which has pushed people
into higher tax brackets even though they
have not increased their real income.
Progressive taxation, as Hayek ex-
plains, “necessarily offends against what
is probably the only universally recog-
nised principle of economic justice, that
of ‘equal pay for equal work’.”
It “discriminates against those risky
ventures which are worthwhile only
because, in case of success, they will
bring a return big enough to compen-
sate for the great risk of total Joss.”
And, as Hayek adds, “it is more than
likely that what truth there is in the
alleged exhaustion of investment oppor-
tunities is due largely to a fiscal policy
which effectively eliminates a wide
range of ventures that private capital
might profitably undertake.”
A libera! policy on taxation increases
personal liberty. The Liberal-Country
Party Government should differ consider-
ably from its Labor Opposition in this
respect, but in practice the difference is
not as great as it should be.
Professor Hayek is rightly concerned
with the increasing threat to liberty from
efficient professional administrators
armed with too many arbitrary powers
of coercion.
Australia, as in the United States and
other countries, has powerful intellectual
groups allied to professional administra-
tors who seek to “enlist the support of
the business community for basically
socialist ends.”
With exact statement, calm objectivity
and impeccable logic, this great scholar
seeks to wean away “progressives” from
their present attacks on “traditional safe-
guards of individual liberty, such as the
rule of law, constitutional restraints,
judicial review, and the conception of a
fundamental law.”
Lawyers as well as economists, the con-
fluence of whose recent thinking is
reflected in Sir Garfield Barwick’s pro-
posed dangerous legislation, must go back
to first principles, and they will find the
extended Notes a useful anthology of
individualist liberal thought to assist
them.
Professor Hayek is already well-known
for his “Road To Serfdom,” completed at
Cambridge at the end of 1943. In the
same year, it should be noted, Sir John
Clapham acknowledged that his “masterly
knowledge of our economic literature
has been at my command” in the writing
of the history of the Bank of England.
Hayek's thesis that socialism and
individual liberty are mutually exclusive
was indignantly rejected by socialists
when the “Road to Serfdom” was first
published, but their attitudes have chang-
ed, especially since the publication in
1949 of George Orwell’s “Nineteen
Eighty-Four” and the warnings by Mr
R. H. Crossman, of the British Labor
Party, that “a vast centralised State
bureaucracy constitutes a grave poten-
tial threat to democracy.”
“The Constitution of Liberty” recon-
structs principles by piecing together the
broken fragments of the liberal tradition
and it attempts to influence public opin-
ion, which is a proper task for the poli-
tical philosopher.
But, as Hayek adds, the problem of
translating these principles into a pro-
gramme with mass appeal must continue
to be left to “that insidious and crafty
animal, vulgarly called a statesman or
politician, whose councils are directed
by the momentary fluctuation of affairs.”

More on Overseas Control
HPhe methods enabling outsiders to win
full control of a native company,
examined in a business note on page 54,
cannot possibly commend themselves to
New Zealanders anxious to help develop
their own resources.
These same kind of matters affecting
Australia have once again been dis-
cussed by two of our high financial
moguls, Sir lan Potter and Mr J. H. D.
Marks.
Insofar as both gentlemen are in-
timately concerned with channelling
overseas funds into Australian enterprise,
they must be interested in moving to-
wards a tacitly recognised code of
behavior by foreign invaders. At least
they know thoroughly the local
susceptibilities.
Speaking to the Institute of Manage-
ment’s conference at Canberra, Mr
Marks could begin by mentioning that
“something over 25 p.c. of Australian
manufacturing industry is owned by
overseas interests.” Furthermore, a study
of this country’s industrial gaps suggests
“the taking over of established business
will become the more popular method
of overseas companies establishing them-
selves in Australia”.
Most foreign investment up till now
has not greatly engaged in new manu-
facturing fields.
Mr Marks feels it high time for the
Australian viewpoint to be more
clearly defined, yet does not support
any legislative action which “would be
unfair to interests that have helped our
development.” He sees the need of
some inducement “to persuade overseas-
owned companies to heed the requests
of our nation.”
“I think this is particularly desirable
where the wholly-owned subsidiary of
an overseas company makes use of
local capital which does not participate
in the equity of the business, that is local
fixed interest borrowing or non - par-
ticipating preference shares,” he adds,
even contemplating a fiscal deterrent to
more closely equate dividend outflow and
capital inflow.
Sir lan Potter, addressing Australian
United Corporation's annual meeting,
drew a distinction between overseas pur-
chase of a business simply as an invest-
ment and as a basis for expansion. The
latter may be valuable “from the national
viewpoint”.
He, too, warned against a “growing
national aversion” to overseas capital,
but had no doubt of a sincere desire for
share participation in important overseas
businesses.
The two discussions of general
principles were not allowed to go un-
disturbed by immediate actual instances.
Last week saw a not obviously
advantageous play in the food invasion
with International Packers’ £2i million
bid for Mayfair Hams. It saw also the
huge Japanese Toyo Rayon Co. obtain
a 15 p.c. equity interest in Tennyson
Textile, of plain commercial and tech-
nical benefit.
And a spanner was thrown into Mr
Holt’s firm design to control direct
Australian portfolio holdings in overseas
companies by the Plessey-Ducon an-
nouncement that a share exchange can
legitimately be part of Plessey’s takeover

The conventional method of measuring a line is to use a
standard unit of length, start at the beginning and measure
to the end. To take the measure of The Australian National
Line however requires much more than that. To begin with,
there is no standard unit. Each year A.N.L. breaks new
ground, introduces new systems, carries more cargo,
creates new standards. And, of course, there is no end
. . . only a beginning and a future.
In less than six years since it was formed to manage and
operate, as Trustees for the people of Australia, a
nationally owned fleet of ships, A.N.L. has
• Added 14 new ships to the fleet
% Invested £l3 million in new tonnage
• Raised its fixed assets to a record £2B million
• Paid nearly £6 million in Income Tax
• Paid over £5 million by way of dividends
9 Paid nearly £lB million in wages and salaries
A.N.L.’s fleet of 40 ships is a national asset, providing
fast, economical coastal shipping facilities to all Australia.

Bloom On The Grape
/Tne relatively new float which exceeded
dividend expectations was Penfolds
Wines Australia Ltd, which from an
initial rate of 10 p.c. per annum has
moved to 11L p.c. for 1962-63, and looks
like paying 121 p.c. for the current year.
Profit of £241,808 compared with
£206,101 for the year before, and was
after transferring £75,000 to provision
for stock valuation, and after writing off
£10,321 for licences.
Wine stocks were in excess of normal
requirements for a number of years until
the grape intake from 1962 was cut back.
Directors did not want to confer a
benefit on the latest profit by reason of
this reduction in the aggregate stocks of
wines and spirits.
The stocks are valued at balance date
at the minimum prescribed by the Income
Tax Act, plus duty where applicable.
The 15s. net tangible asset backing per
ss. share, shown in 1961-62 accounts,
will be improved upon in the new ac-
counts yet to be released, thus encourag-
ing investors to think about capital
benefits.
At about 175., the Penfolds shares
are lined up on an income return basis
pretty closely with its competitor Linde-
mans.
Lindemans has also reported profit
progress from £104,184 to £125,927 in
the year to June 30.
Earning rate of 25.2 p.c. (vis-a-vis
dividend of 15 p.c.) gives it an edge on
Penfolds’ earning rate of 19.3 p.c., but
the 245. 6d. being asked for Lindemans
shares more than takes account of this.
Lindemans’ last bonus was a two-for-
five in October, 1962, so Penfolds might
be more rewarding for the short haul and
Lindemans the sounder purchase for the
patient holder.
More Power To Myer
VI/Tiat more can one say about Myer?
The mammoth Melbourne-based re-
tail empire sells higher and more profit-
ably than anyone else in Australia.
A 10 p.c. sales rise reflected the first
full year’s trading from the NSW rep-
resentatives, Farmers and Western Stores.
Shareholders get capital benefits rarely,
but in big licks. The last was a one-
for-two bonus in April, 1961, after the
Farmers-Western Stores takeovers, and
prior to that it was a one-for-one in
December, 1950.
A 2.2 p.c. yield while the ss. shares
sell at around 38s. is more suitable for
the large and institutional investor than
the little man.
New earning rate of about 33 p.c. did
not embolden directors to improve on
last year’s dividend of 161 p.c., but
maybe 1963-64 will see a repeat of the
18i p.c. payment made for 1959-60.
The Tale of Two Stores
1%/fYER (SA) Ltd emphasised its oft-
A repeated policy of “the highest
quality merchandise at the lowest prices”
in directors’ statement that “gross profit
percentage was maintained at the normal
low level” in 1962-63.
First group accounts showed a net
profit of £1,155,915, after tax of
£875,789.
(For the record, The Myer Em-
porium’s NSW subsidiary, Farmers,
made £792,000 in 1961-62.)
But the SA company (54 p.c. owned
by the Melbourne parent) derived
£753,579 or 37 p.c. of pre-tax profit
from investments.
Meantime in Sydney, Myer’s major
opposition, David Jones Ltd, reported a
6.5 p.c. profit rise to £1,931,376.
The new Adelaide DJ store was
opened in November and turnover and
profit have “far exceeded expectations”.
The Monaro Mall opened in March, and
the Warringah Mall in April. Their turn-
over was “most satisfactory”, but no
reference was made in the directors’
reports to their profits-
Obviously 1963-64 profits will derive
greater benefits from these new capital
investments.
The George Street store is being
enlarged, modernised, and installed with
escalators.

Ode To An Oil Boom
An earnings yield of 13.5 p.c. and
income return of 6.3 p.c. makes
the 3s. 4d. shares of Oil Drilling and
Exploration Ltd an interesting investment
for a limited sum.
As a drilling contractor, ODE has
never had it so good. Profit for the year
to June 30 rose from £126,239 to
£180,438, after writing off a non-
recurring loss of £29,562 by a subsidiary
in the rental business.
The tax provision rose from £39,390
to £93,627. The company has no in-
tention of re-entering large scale explora-
tion activity but a re-formed subsidiary,
Krewliff Investments Pty, will make
small contributions to financing ex-
ploratory wells, which will be tax
deductible.
A subsidiary purchased during 1962-
63, which is in the oil business, will
confer future tax benefits.
Drilling equipment has been main-
tained in first-class condition. The
depreciation provision was £183,077,
compared with £87,466 for 1961-62.
No profits from the sales of “Seaways”
home units have been included in 1962-
63, but when the investment is finally
liquidated, a satisfactory profit is ex-
pected. No more building projects will
be undertaken.
ODE directors seem open to suggestion
of other means to expansion.
New Concrete Frontiers
T)ioneer Concrete Services Ltd
created another profit record,
despite prolonged wet weather in the
home State, and a substantial non-
recurring loss on a Queensland contract.
Earning rate for 1962-63 stiffened
from 18.6 p.c. to 20.4 p.c. on markedly
higher average capital.
Shareholders are invited to subscribe
to a one-for-five par issue in November.
The last such issue (same terms) was in
late 1961.
Directors see no difficulty in holding
the 123 p.c. dividend on higher capital.
The new money is needed as extra
working capital and for domestic and
overseas expansion. So far Pioneer has
subsidiary or associate interests in Hong
Kong, Israel and the UK.

£86,899) of excess tax provision has been
written back.
This year the net trading profit rose
from £549,876 to £612,105 giving an
earning rate of 21.6 p.c. (21.2 p.c.) on
average ordinary capital, including
capital issued for the purchase of
Olympic Bowling Centres.
Tax provision increased £46,545 to
£474,408, and depreciation rose £69,344
to £370,292.
Dividend remained at 15 p.c., so the
ss. shares at about 225. 3d. yield 3.4 p.c.
Careful Factoring
Factors Ltd demonstrated its
superiority by producing-an 86 p.c.
profit increase in the year to June 30,
and maintenance of earning rate at
approximately 18.2 p.c. on much higher
capital.
Key to its success must be careful
selection of accounts, which are mainly
obtained through the recommendation of
banks, accountants and satisfied clients,
directors say in their preliminary report.
Frequent cash issues appear to be the
pattern for this company a one-for-
three par issue announced for subscrip-
tion in November follows par issues in
January, 1963, September, 1962, and
October, 1960.
Institutional shareholders, the Com-
mercial Banking Co. of Sydney, MLC
and the Capel Court group should be
well satisfied with progress made.
Meat for Exports
Uow variable is the meat trade is
illustrated by Tancred’s latest result.
Contrary to the trend of most meat
firms’ trading this year, Tancred scored
a 67 p.c. profit lift to £217,440.
It was well below the heights of 1956
and 1957, but still a handsome improve-
ment on the last three years’ figures
thanks to a big export trade to North
America.
Return of half the capital in 1961-62
meant the present profit gives an out-
standing earning rate of 51.2 p.c.
The ss. shares at 18s. 9d. to yield
4.0 p.c. are better left to those closely
associated with the meat trade. Nobody
else would be in a position to predict
profit trends.
Good Marks For Max
Ohareholders of drawing office supplier
Max Wurcker (Holdings) Ltd will
be pleased to receive first and final divi-
dend of Is. 4d. a share in respect of
profits for the year to June 30.
Profit rose 6 p.c. to £41,290, the best
yet in the history of the company, so
dividend was adjusted from 12i to
13J p.c.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Season of Annual Meetings
season of annual meetings is here
and once again providing some of
the best entertainment in town.
Out at Bennett and Wood the other
day the meeting was going along very
smoothly until it touched on a new
section of the Companies Act. That
section divides directors into two groups
those under 72 years and those over.
And if as a senior member of the com-
munity you belong to the second group,
then you must retire each year and be
re-elected.
One of the directors, Mr D. A. Storey,
who had reached this ripe age, did not
like the section at all when he could see
himself being passed over. So he
demanded a poll. Alas, the other forces
had mustered themselves and he was
defeated. His parting comment to the
meeting was, “It’s been loaded”.
It is only a couple of weeks since I
parted with the last of my Bennett and
Wood- The small profit that they did
eventually show was disappointing. Per-
haps it’s more a case of being premature
than being wrong. Now that everything
has settled down, it should be a much
better year.
To balance up the averages, some of
the other companies in the portfolio
turned in excellent results Pioneer
Concrete, Keith Harris and Plastic
Coatings.
Pioneer Concrete rose nicely to 175.,
giving me the opportunity to take a
profit of £52. Keith Harris hung limply
at 30s. 6d. I'll hold these in the hope
of some sort of bonus announcement at
the annual meeting.
The last of the trio, Plastic Coatings,
could go a little higher after the old and
new shares rank alike.
In an effort to raise funds for the big
purchase of the week I also sold the 200
James Hardie at a profit of £BO. Add
this to the profit of £B6 for a sale of 3000
Salamander Salt at an average price of
3s. Id. and it’s been a pretty good week.
Well stocked with funds, my conscience
was not guilty when I bought 400 Gibson
and Howes at 765. Back in late June I
had sold Fairymead at 525. 6d. only
to see them rise 10s to 625. 6d.
On projected profit prospects Gibson
and Howes comes out on top. Now that
both Millaquin and Pioneer have had
bonus issues this year, it should be
Gibson and Howes’ turn next.
Transactions for this week are:
SOLD
3000 Salamander, 3/1 £437
200 James Hardie, £6/9/- £1274
400 Pioneer Concrete, 17/- £333

WESTERN MINING CORPORATION LIMITED
HIGHLIGHTS FROM CHAIRMAN S ADDRESS AT ANNUAL MEETING
Addressing shareholders of Western Mining Corporation at the Company’s 30th
annual meeting in Melbourne on September 18, 1963, the Chairman of Directors,
Mr. G. Lindesay Clark, reviewed both the result of the year’s work in the Company’s
fields of activities and events which had transpired since the end of the Corporation’s
financial year.
Before making his review, Mr. Clark
paid a warm tribute to the late Mr.
W. S. Robinson, founder of Western
Mining Corporation.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Referring to Western Mining Corpora-
tion net profit for the year of £278,667,
Mr. Clark said that this was £8,206
higher than the previous year.
Dividends received from Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie were £5,000 higher, and in-
come from management fees and other
sources was higher.
Dividends from Central Norseman Gold
Corporation were unchanged at £229,687.
Western Mining Corporation’s share-
holdings of Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie on
completion of deliveries of plant would
be 1,942,033 shares or 31/7% of the issued
shares.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends paid by W.M.C. continued at
the steady rate of 1/- per year per fully-
paid share. A further dividend of 6d.
per fully-paid share was paid on 9th
August.
APPROPRIATION ACCOUNT
The Appropriation Account at the end
of the financial year stood at £177,963. No
appropriation was made for Investments
and Investigation Reserve which re-
mained at £1,100,000.
The net book figure of £3,022,806 in the
balance sheet represented all invest-
ments, loans and investigations. The
market value at March 31, of only such
of those shares as were listed on the
Stock Exchange was £4,128,000. In ad-
dition, W.M.C. holds 5,000,000 shares in
Alcoa of Australia Pty. Limited with a
paid-up value of £3,962,000, and also
interests in Iron Ore, Gold and Copper
prospecting investigations, Lithium and
Talc.
CAPITAL
Two calls of 2/6 each had been made
during the year on the 1961 new issue
shares. Ten shillings (4/- capital and
6/- premium) had now been paid on
these shares and the final call of 2/6 per
share, 1/- capital and 1/6 premium, is
payable on September 30, to make the
shares fully paid. These shares will par-
ticipate in dividends payable after June
30, 1964.
GOLD MINING
Mr. Clark said that W.M.C.’s three
Gold Mining companies had produced
297,309 ounces of fine gold from 1,042,027
tons of ore, both figures being slightly
less than the previous year.
COMMENTS ON MINES
Central Norseman Gold Corporation
N.L. Ore reserves had increased during
the year from 595,000 tons averaging
10.0 dwts. per ton to 610,000 tons
averaging 10.0 dwts.
Great Western Consolidated N.L. mined
out its remaining ore reserves and had
closed down since the end of the financial
year.
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aust.) Ltd.
The expansion programme was making
good progress. The reserves of telluride
ore in the Fimiston leases on March 31,
were estimated at 1,012,000 tons averaging
5.9 dwts. per ton and reserves of free-
milling ore at Fimiston and Mt. Charlotte
at that date were estimated at 2,559,000
tons averaging 3.2 dwts. per ton.
GOLD PROSPECTING
Referring to W.M.C.’s Gold Prospecting
activities, Mr. Clark said that a study of
the Kalgoorlie Southern area had con-
tinued and had confirmed that the Kal-
goorlie Fold structure continues on its
flat south pitch and showed many
features characteristic of the productive
area of the field.
Diamond Drilling at Stawell had con-
tinued to show mineralisation on a
parallel anticline to the East and North
of the productive area of the old field.
IRON ORE
Reviewing the development of W.M.C.’s
iron ore prospects and the agreement
with this company, and two major U.S.A.
organisations specialising in iron ore and
gold mining, Mr. Clark said that under
the agreement between the three com-
panies the expenses of testing and evalu-
ating the Geraldton iron ore deposits in
the last year had been borne by the
United States partners. Negotiations
were in hand to include all W.M.C.’s iron
ore reserves in the same partnership.
It was hoped to complete negotiations
for a contract in the near future for the
supply of 5.1 million tons to Japanese
steel mills.
Exploration during the year had con-
centrated on closely establishing the
grade of direct shipping ore reserves at
Koolanooka to fulfil the initial contract.
Testing in this area and in other iron-
bearing areas in the district had shown
that substantial quantities of medium-
grade ore existed.
ALUMINIUM
Mr. Clark said that Alcoa of Australia
Pty. Limited, which was 20% owned by
W.M.C., continued to make rapid pro-
gress in establishing a fully integrated
aluminium industry in Australia. The
plant would reach full capacity of
40,000 tons per annum by the end of
1963.
Alcoa’s first extrusion press would be
in operation about October, 1963, making
available products for use in building,
transport and electrical industries. In
the second half of 1964 a sheet rolling
mill would be operating, enabling the
company to make a full range of plate,
sheet, coil stock, strip and foil. The
refinery at Kwinana, W.A., was expected
to commence operation in October this
year.
POWER FROM BROWN COAL
Referring to Alcoa’s fuel requirements
for long-term power supply, Mr. Clark
said that this would be obtained from
the Anglesea Brown Coalfield held under
lease from the Victorian Government.
The coalfield has now been drilled, and
testing of the burning properties of the
fuel was well advanced and would be
completed this year. The design of the
boiler plant would follow.
ALCOA’S CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure undertaken at this
stage of Alcoa’s development in Aus-
tralia was £45 million, including Kwinana
Refinery and Darling Range Mining
£ll million; Point Henry Smelting and
Fabricating Plants —£23 million; Angle-
sea Coal Mine and Electric Power
Generating Station —£11 million.
Mr. Clark said that between 70% and
80% of capital commitments were being
spent on Australian materials and labour.
COPPER, LITHIUM ORE AND TALC
Mr. Clark outlined prospecting
activities for Copper in South Australia,
results of drilling tests in Western Aus-
tralia in regard to Lithium Ore, and
operations at Three Springs where Talc
was produced.
PROPOSED NEW SHARE ISSUE
Mr. Clark said that W.M.C. was
following an active prospecting policy
but was meeting more competition in this
field due to overseas interests coming
into Australia. The results being obtained
by newer geophysical methods made it
very desirable to continue our search.
More capital was required to maintain
operations directed to new production.
The fund from the last issue of shares
by W.M.C. had been utilised in paying
calls on the 1,597,222 Alcoa shares (now
called to 12/6 per share), in taking up
the recent issue of G.M.K., for iron ore
and other investigational activities. It
was therefore probable that a new share
issue would be made in the near future,
the terms of which would be announced
at that time.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Boral’s Bold, Strategic Strokes
HPhe bold, strategic strokes made
■*- periodically by Bitumen and Oil
Refineries (Australia) Ltd should project
it to the very front investment rank, but
the shares have not been sought after
in great volume or to excessive price
limits.
The inhibiting factor for investors is
that £819,016 has just been issued in
ordinary shares by way of consideration
for Mt Lyell Investments Ltd all since
balance date and an offer for Gas
Supply Co. Ltd could involve, at
maximum, the issue of another £686,548.
Having made good profits, par-
ticularly Gas Supply shareholders, these
captured shareholders may be content to
sell out, thus temporarily depressing the
price of Boral shares.
In the next few months individual
investors and institutions seeking sizeable
holdings should have the opportunity to
buy at very economical levels.
When the new additions have shaken
down into the group network, Boral
management should be able to assess the
enhanced earnings capacity and reserves
position, and dispense some largesse.
In the year to June 30, ordinary
capital only rose by £500,000 to
£4,527,660, from the issue to BHP for
its road-surfacing interests. This raked
in a cool £2 million for share premium
reserve.
The Mt Lyell and Gas Supply take-
overs could add a further £6 million in
share premiums.
The business to which the accounts at
June 30, 1963, relate comprised opera-
tions of the parent oil refinery at Matra-
ville (NSW); that of Queensland Oil
Refineries Pty in Brisbane; of Petro-
chemical Holdings Ltd at Silverwater
(NSW); of Huddart Parker Industries
Ltd and its colliery and engineering
subsidiaries, Hebburn, Metropolitan Coal
and Elrington; and of various road
constructors and suppliers of bituminous
products in NSW, Vic., SA and Queens-
land, named W. B. Carr Constructions
Pty, Boral Road Services Pty (formerly
BHP By-Products), Roadbuilders Pty
and Carr Fowler Constructions Pty.
During the year under review, produc-
tion of crude oil at Matraville increased
10 p.c. from 6,011,000 to a record
6,587,000 barrels. The refinery has a
catalytic re-former, a catalytic de-
sulphurisation plant, and a fluid catalytic
cracking plant.
The cracking unit, costing £2 million,
came on stream in March, 1962. This
allows a better balance of refinery
products to market demand, by pro-
viding the facilities to produce additional
motor gasoline from heavy oil.
Queensland Oil Refineries is “yielding
satisfactory profits”, and purchase of
interests in Queensland road contracting
projects has widened the scope of its
operations.
W. B. Carr Constructions’ factory at
Rozelle has been transferred to Boral
Road Services Depot at St Peters for the
sake of greater efficiency. Boral now has
a fair shareholding in Bitumax Ltd,
which operates a hot-mix asphalt plant
in SA.
BHP holds a 40 p.c. interest in the
colliery subsidiaries of Huddart Parker,
and Boral, which sold Huddart’s shipping
fleet to Mcllwraith McEacharn, holds
48 p.c. of Mcllwraith’s capital.
In 1961-62 Boral decided a substantial
interest in oil exploration was funda-
mental to its activities, and so took up
2,000,000 ss. shares (a 20 p.c. interest)
in Oil Development NL. Therefore
£500,000 was allowable as a deduction
for tax purposes in that year. In 1962-63,
500,000 ss. shares were taken up in
Alliance Petroleum NL which were only
called up as to Is. by June 30.
The purchase of Mt Lyell Investments,
which took effect after balance date, gave
Boral a large investment portfolio, in-
cluding material holdings in “well-known
and profitable fertilizer companies” which
are going to benefit from the bonus
recently granted in the Federal Budget.
The bid for Gas Supply, which has
been recommended by the company’s
directors, will provide Boral with captive
markets for its petroleum gas used in
town supplies in the eastern States. The
consideration would be a maximum pay-
ment of approximately £663.000 in cash
and issue of £686,548 in shares, if all
Gas Supply shareholders accept the

share and cash offer, rather than the
wholly cash consideration.
The failure, after lengthy negotiations,
to reach agreement on the terms of a
merger with H. C. Sleigh Ltd has
certainly not killed Boral’s expansionary
aims.
Net result of the year’s trading was an
increase in profit from £1,045,608 to
£1,614,330, after providing £727,067
(1962, £266,100) for tax, and £1,139,314
(£824,966) for depreciation.
The dividend rate, 17k p.c. for three
years, has been augmented to 20 p.c.,
and, after £40,000 preference charges,
directors calculated that total ordin-
ary dividend commitment would be
£955,266, having regard to the dividend
entitlements of ex-Mt Lyell shareholders.
Caltex of the US holds 4.1 million
shares in Boral, and is entitled to take up
shares equal to 40 p.c. of the total
number of shares comprised in any new
issue. It did not exercise this right in
regard to the BHP By-Products takeover,
and therefore may not do so in respect
of the Mt Lyell Investments and Gas
Supply takeovers.
Boral obtains its crude oil require-
ments under long-term contract from
Caltex, and Caltex (Australia) is one of
the chief distributors for Boral products.
All Boral plants have operated at full
capacity since June 30, and the net
profit of the first quarter was, in modest
parlance, “satisfactory”.
Firmly established in one of the most
dynamic industries, with first-class tech-
nical know-how and astute financial
guidance, Boral impresses as one of the
best avenues for medium-term equity
investment in Australia.
Any purchaser below 30s. should be
fully rewarded.
Taking The Point
ITas anybody come to any firm con-
elusions yet on which shares are
going to benefit from the switch to
decimals?
Talking about possible effects in Brit-
ain, the Investors’ Chronicle thinks that
match manufacturers and newspaper
companies should do well out of it.
It says, “We know that South African
match manufacturers met the up-valua-
tion of the penny by varying the num-
bers of matches in each box, so we
think that British match a fair gamble.”
Further, “certain newspaper shares
suggest themselves on two counts
the possible rounding off of the selling
price and the fact that advertising the
new changes must play a big part in
the educative campaign with which
changes would have to be Introduced.”
Then there are the shares of accoun-
ting and business companies and others.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Don’t Make Him a Farmer
Farming’s Too Complex For a Dull Son
<T|ne of the problems of living in this
age is that there is no longer a
ready answer to the question of what to
do with the dull son.
Opening a recent conference in Mel-
bourne, Professor H. C. Forster, Dean of
the Faculty of Agriculture at Melbourne
University, said the good old days when
anyone could make a success of farming
were gone.
• Emphasising how complex modern
farming was, Professor Forster urged
the use of more farm management con-
sultants and farm management clubs.
Despite food shortages in many countries,
marketing of surplus produce had become
one of the major problems and there
was need for a fresh outlook in our
farming industries.
Alternative markets, mainly in Asia
and the United States, had been found
for those lost in the United Kingdom,
but markets in the future were likely
to be more selective and with greater
movement of world trade were likely to
change more readily from year to year.
Efficiency in marketing and flexibility
in production must be the keynote. Some
Australian farmers were in a position
to diversify, but this alone was of little
use unless accompanied by an ability
to be able to decide at any given stage
what form of production was the most
profitable.
“It is here that most farmers, and I
include myself, become bogged down”,
Professor Forster said.
“The position of the farm as a whole
can be assessed reasonably well at the
end of the financial year but analysis of
accounts to determine whether one
should plan next year's operations on
the basis of more cropping, wool, fat
lambs or beef defeats most farmers en-
tirely.”
It was too much to expect officers of
the Department of Agriculture, who had
the Responsibility for advice on district
agriculture, to give advice on a personal
basis. It was also expecting too much to
look to the normal accountancy firms to
advise on agricultural problems involved
in farm management.
Professor Forster commended the
development of what were known as
farm management advisory services or
more simply as farm management clubs.
A typical club consists of 40 to 45
farmers who pay fees to cover the
services of an agricultural adviser and
for an accountancy analysis of the mem-
bers’ farm operations.
This service in no way completed or
replaced the work of the Departments
of Agriculture.
The farm club adviser was there to
help the farmer members make better
farm management decisions. To do this,
he must have full knowledge of the
farm, its resources and equipment, and
above all an assessment of the farmer
himself and his capabilities.
Better farm management must be
backed by more applied research at the
local farm level to give farm manage-
ment advisers the information they
needed for fully elfective advice.

vacancies on its staff one in
