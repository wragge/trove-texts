Monolithic Plaster Sheets!
You cannot expect to get “Gypsboard” results if you use
a wall boa i'd that is offered as “just as good.”
“Gypsboard” is overwhelmingly superior to other Avail and
ceiling material, oAving 'to its Monolithic Solidity, its Sur-
face, Lightness and Wonderful Durability.
The sheets are saAvn and nailed just like Avood, and give
no trouble owing to jagged, broken edges. “Gypsboard” is
clean and easy to erect and enables you to have modern,
attractive, panelled walls and beamed ceilings that will
never crack and fall like plaster. “Gypsboard” is the ideal
material for all types of homes in city and country, hotels,
institutes, clubs, halls, schools and churches. In renovat-
ing you simply nail the “Gypsboard” sheets over the
shabby walls and ceilings. Send for Sample and Illus-
trated Booklet “A” to the manufacturers.

For Sick Headache
Many people suffer at regular
intervals from sick headache. The
trouble is caused by accumlation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coated ovals that act so
gently that they are the ideal laxa-
tive to use in correcting a tendency
to sick headache. They have no
unpleasant effect to make them
objectionable to the extra-sensitive
sick headache patient. Old fash-
ioned harsh purgatives will not do
at all in such cases.

Dissatisfaction.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Obstinate words that will not take my will!
Weak will that cannot mould the fluent
word!
If I could pen the fairy numbers heard
In summer twilights when the air is still,
Or those rich pseans that exultant fill
The flooding veins when the swift heart is
stirred,
Catch in a phrase the circling of a bird
Or the soft swells and foldings of a hill,
Then I could hope. But how can words
translate
The music breaking in a budding bough?
If I could speak the rhythm of a cloud,
The harmony of limbs in effort bowed,
The strangely governed ebb and flow of
fate,
Then I might capture all that flies me
now.
VICTORIA-
SYD C.
The Universal Spiders
J. Ellis Barker, who is a man of tonnage
in the inky world, adds to his reputation
with his Foundation of Germany (John
Murray, London). There is nothing very
new, though there is an eternal fascination,
about how Prussia, which became Germany,
or rather Brandenburg, which was the egg
of Prussia, emerged, about the time when
Charles I ruled England, as a spoonful of
sand, and scraped up an army of 3000 men
with which to begin trouble. That was
after the Thirty Years War. By “one
demnition grind.’’ which sacrificed every-
thing to military and industrial efficiency,
and passed the steam roller over religion
and education and political freedom and
every other pinnacle of objection or re-
joinder or differentiation, it became the
perfect machine. And while the perfect or
nearly perfect engine-driver was in charge
and the ideal stoker was stoking, it did
wonders,, just as it may do again.
Mr. Barker blames Macliiavelli for sup-
plying the principles of the Hohenzollerns
and Martin Luther for making the brutish
character of the people. This seems rough
on both of them. The polite Italian only
put on paper illiterate and impolite
rulers practised. When he recommended a
conquering or usurping sovereign to wipe
out all the old royal family he followed the
ideas of David, who obliterated Saul’s
family, and dug up the old king’s bones:
and Baasha, who wiped out Jeroboam’s
house; and Zimri, who extinguished
Baasha’s premises; and Jehu, who oblit-
erated the tenement of Omri ; and others
who slew the predecessor’s family-tree in
scores of countries till that sort of timber
became scarce. Similarly Machiavefli was
treading old ground when he wrote that
treaties didn’t matter; that a king should
lead his own army lest his generals should
turn dog on him; that he should either
treat a country so well that it
will be a steady friend, or so badly that
it will be a steady corpse; that he should
put used-up accomplices out of the way
lest they become informers in their garru-
lous or disgruntled old age; and that when
he had two big enemies he should buy the
first and use him against the second, and
then sell him to a third at the highest price.
Not being a king himself Macliiavelli mirth-
fully gave away the secrets of the trade,
which David and Louis NI didn’t, because
they were in the trade themselves. But
he didn’t make the Hohenzollerns. They
came naturally.
And it seems equally absurd to say that
Martin Luther made the Hun character.
Martin started as a religious tribune of the
people and did a lot, within his sphere, to
pull down the rich and arrogant Roman
Church. Then he sold the half-demolished
edifice to the aristocracy, probably on com-
mission. and his advice about the advisability
of flogging, hanging and enslaving the com-
mon herd was as frank as anything Maeliia-
velli ever wrote, and not so grammatical-
The peasantry lost their appeal to a foreign
Power at Rome, and instead of having two
masters who often 4 counterbalanced each
other, they had one overwhelming local
despot against whom there was no appeal.
A tame Church which fed on low diet out
of the King’s hand replaced the wild Church
which sometimes gave the monarch beans.
Luther’s indecency of language was wonder-
ful even for his time and place; in fact, it
is said there were doubts about admitting
him to perdition on account of the breadth
of the anecdote his ghost told to the door-
keeper through the keyhole. But he was
probably not a cause —only a finished pro-
duct. He was the hog-reformer who
appealed to a hog generation. Hurried
sectarian writers have mixed him up with
Calvin. Huss and Knox, whose language
. didn’t deal so largely with undressed
females.
Ellis Barker is always interesting, what-
ever his theories may be. He draws atten-
tion to the much-forgotten fact that Prussia,
after the defeat of Austria in 1866, practi-
cally doubled its territory and population,
and by a mixture of alibi and plausibility
did it without attracting attention. This
recalls something that happened 60 years
earlier, when the allegedly disarmed country
created a great army when Europe wasn’t
looking, and produced the article from its
hat like a conjuring trick. And he pub-
lishes documents which show how some kings
and statesmen hate to die without letting
the world know how mean they could be
when they had a moment to spare.
The Basis of Bolshevism
A Confession, by Maxim Gorky, one of
the Bolshevik Ministry—if *.his friend
Trotsky has not yet had him imprisoned or
shot —is illuminating in that it gives an
inner view of the mentality on which this
latest soul-saving revolution rests. As-shown
in his literature, the Slav is eternally troubled
about his soul; the endless Russian roads
are dotted with pilgrims to shrines or holy
places. He has the introspection of the
poet and the realism of an imaginative child
—the common soldier’s letters describing the
war might be pages from Tolstoy. Gorky
gives us the ferment of ideas before the
overflow: —
This deplorable life, which is unworthy of human
intelligence, began on the day when the first human
personality tore itself adrift from the miraculous
power of the people, from the parent mass; and from
the dread of isolation and its own impotence, it
transformed itself into ~ a wicked skein of petty
desires —a skein christened “I”. This “1” is man’s
worst enemy; it is poor in spirit and incapable
of creating anything. It is deaf and blind and dumb
to life; its object is simply and solely self protec-
tion, ease ancUcomfort. It only creates what is new
and truly human under compulsion. Other “I’s”
cannot esteem but hate and persecute it. Neverthe-
less, it cannot forget its relationship to the whole
from which it has severed itself, and seeks to unite
once more.
Here we have the fundamental idea, that man
is a unified organism, and can only rightly
function in harmony with his whole; indi-
vidualism being the seed of all evil. Biologi-
cally this is a variant of Weismann’s theory
that all life is a fraction of one original
great soul. And its part-truth is its strength,
for the unity of life is scientifically incon-
testable, though the method of union is in
doubt.
Yet the Gorky, Bolshevik, One Big Union
idea errs when it builds hopes on the “miracu-
lous powers of the people,” meaning usually
the manual workers, the non-users of tooth-
brushes, the minds untrained ; for this leads
logically to the slaughter of the well-to-do,
and then of the intellectuals; or the bonds
of capitalism and then the bonds of all
ideas but their own—ideas being the greatest
bondage of all. It is all pathetically sorrow-
ful and understandable —one hundred mil-
lions with no prospect in life but toil,
suffering parentage, vodka and prayers.
Refusing to be altogether cattle, they strike
out at what seems to them the enemy, idealis-
ing a past humanity that never existed, and
a new humanity that within measurable
time cannot exist either. For this is sure :
there is no miracle in humanity or
phenomena, all happenings being the result
of antecedent happenings. So the new Russia
will be the old Russia, in a new skirt per-
haps, as England and France, after their
social house-cleaning, were only their re-
dressed selves.
H. F.
The Compleat Newe Angler
That ought to be, but isn’t, the title of
Henry Newbolt's book, Submarine and Anti-
Submarine (Longmans, Green and Co., Lon-
don). It contains a mass of information,
only recently allowed to pass the censor,
about the advent, the greatness and the
downfall of the sub-Hunmarine. Appar-
ently that proud fish was floating on his
back pretty nearly dead—-much nearer dead
than was generally supposed—in the last
days of the war. At first he had a riotous
time. There were few Hun ships at sea for
the Allied under-sea vessel to shoot, while
the Allies presented targets innumerable. It
was almost new warfare, and had to be
learned, and the Hun learned more cheaply.
But things began to happen. The convoy
system diminished the chances. Then Britain
covered the narrow seas with boats innumer-
able —trawlers, yachts, petty destroyers,
tramp steamers, mosquitoes, midgets, sailing
craft and sundries. They all carried guns
and depth bombs. They often hunted in
packs and. the slaying of one vessel of little
value was liable to attract two or three
angry witnesses. The glory of the Hun-
marine faded when the hydrophone made it
possible to overhear his movements under
sea and locate his address, and the depth
bomb made it convenient to blow him to
pieces in his lair. Also the art of dodging
liis torpedo was wonderfully developed as
time went on. Right to the end he was
as good as ever for surprise attacks on soli-
tary unarmed vessels. The trouble was to
pass through the shallow seas and reach the
places where solitary vessels could be found
and get home again. Aeroplanes and hydro-
planes watched for him from above. Hydro-
phones listened for him in all directions, and
at times a sixpenny bomb dropped from a
threepenny vessel which had overheard
things with a penny ear was his undoing.
He became a terrified outlaw fish. The
command of the waters passed back to the
surface craft, or rather to the Powers which
could use various kinds of craft in con-
junction. And the Hun’s surface craft had
ceased to come out. The big top-sea vessels
did gallant service when they got a chance,
but chances were few. The sea campaign
was mostly a battle of fish beneath the sur-
face and wasps on the surface and hawks
above; and the combination was decisive in
crowded seas.
One aspect of the new sea-warfare New-
bolt—who, incidentally, has- been doing his
bit in the'Ministry of Information in Lon-
don—does not mention. The fish and the
wasps and the hawks were to a great extent
officered and manned by people who don’t
belong to the navy as a regular thing. A
young peer, one of the biggest landlords in
the United Kingdom, was for many months
submarining in the Mediterranean. That
service—his intimate association in a most
dangerous enterprise with men whom he
would never have known- otherwise—had a
humanising influence. It may have been
only coincidence that within the last few
months some hundreds of thousands of the
acres of that peer’s estate have been sold in
small lots. The estate hadn’t too good a
name. It almost looked as if the peer who
had gone down to the sea with the horny-
handed commoner felt too uneasy to be con-
nected with it any longer.
Repatriation
The Soldier Colonists (Chatto and
Windus, London) is a carefully studied
scheme of repatriation which should work
to perfection in a perfect land. The
authors are solid in theory and three in
number—War man, Temporary Captain of
Tanks and scholar of Worcester College.
Oxford; Brooks. Temporary Second Lieu-
tenant of Machine Guns; and the Earl of
Selborne, lawyer and Permanent Peer. They
don’t give the impression of having colonised
at any time. Their artist throws in a
picture of an ideal colonist—tall, young

Twilight.
As the embers stir and settle
Hums the philosophic kettle
In a drowsy, drowsy, drowsy
Monotone. . . .monotone,
Till that muffled murmur ringing
Sets the dreamy fancies winging,
Floating, drifting on its singing
Round me sitting here alone ;
Placid thoughts of finished labors,
Quiet days and friendly neighbors,
While beside me, on the mat,
With abstracted eyes and narrow
Musing upon mouse or sparrow
Purrs the comfortable cat.
As the embers stir and settle
Sings the moralising kettle :
“Reaping all that youth has sown,
How the happy days have flown!”
Sighs it to my heart, and after
Wakes about the darkling rafter
Echoes of forgotten laughter—
Such a thin and eerie tone !
No more stir, and stress of living;
Just forgetting and forgiving.
(While the soft, insistent singing
Sets a plaintive murmur ringing:
“And a10ne.... a10ne.... alone.”)
No more laughter now nor crying,
Just an echo dying, dying,
Just the echo of an echo,
Further, further, fainter blown.
Still the embers stir and settle
Deeper, and the flagging kettle,
Murmuring in vaguer tone,
Spreads a soft enchantment, bringing
Ghostly arms about me clinging,
Fingers twining with my own;
Gulfs where pale, remembered faces
Rise again as fancy traces
Outlines once so fondly known,
Scenes no altering time erases,
Thick with bleaching memories strown.

Into a subtle harmony, while thought
Clings at the fringes of the mind that

Deep in my soul your hanging gardens bend
Imperial, yet, half-concealed, are csught
Into a gossamer-fine mirage, dream-brought
Out of sub-conscious ways truth dare not

Groping through memory I can arrest
Again your old-time splendor, and repeat
Within your temples offices replete
With the magnificence that vestals pressed
In burning tribute, while in perfumed rest'
My slave anoints again niy feet!

In many lands I have had many homes;
Still, through all change, each one a home,

As home can be to only him who roams
From land to land, as life from year to

Each year, each land, each home we leave
behind
Steals out and follows us upon our way.
How far we pitch our camp, yet wake to
find
Faithful the memories of yesterday!
And yesterday and yesterday draws out,
Veiling the milestones on our pilgrimage ;
And often, while we sleep, some wakeful
scout
Posts on, to greet us at the further stage.
Take from the house the things I call my
own;
Sweep clean the hearth, and bare the walls
and floor;
Leave there the ghosts of yesterdays alone,
And on another lifetime close the door —
Dear, loyal ghosts! Ere fades to-morrow’s

Out. of the embers kindly eyes will look
Into my own, or light the heart’s desire
On the neglected pages of my book.

I gave a kiss to you,
Three-cornered and gay ;
But the kiss I had from you
Brings dreams night and day.
Across the oak floor
The fire stole in gleams,
And a girl’s voice next door
Held me thrall to my dreams.
“Now Colin’s not here,”
The plaintive voice rang—
Was it art or a tear
In her voice as she sang?
The girl’s voice once more
Rose and fell in the song
Of those lovers of yore,
And their dream that went wrong.
it was all long ago,
In an oak-panelled room,
Where the fire flung its glow
Like gold moths through the gloom.
I gave a kiss to you,
Three-cornered and gay ;
But the kiss I had from you
Brings dreams night and day.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1919.
MR. PECKSNIFF.
Even an honest Pecksniff may be a serious
nuisance, and President Wilson, assuming
his honesty, fills the bill more and more every
day. Most of the troubles of the Peace Con-
ference have arisen through the moral pre-
cepts of the least practical among the dele-
gates, and the least important save in the
fact that he is the figurehead of a very great
Republic. Wilson appears at the Confer-
ence as a self-appointed member and as
the discredited leader of a defeated party.
All his pose as the belated War Lord, and
all the earnest appeals to the people to
stand by their leader and present a united
front to the world, didn’t prevent the return
of a Republican majority at the U.S. general
election. The Republicans, though not then
in power, had been the main driving force
which made the United States and the peace-
ful theorist at the top of affairs take up
arms in the cause of civilisation, and the
country gave them a majority to make sure
that the peaceful theorists wouldn’t get cold
feet. Wilson, as the leader whom the
country has censurbd for lukewarmness, ac-
companied by some nominees of his own
party, are now in Europe to uphold the
famous 14 points which the discredited
figurehead presented on his own authority to
the Congress which is now dead. The 14
points are so beautiful and vague and philan-
thropic that the Hun clamors for them,
and claims that the Allies are bound to
them, and m anxious to join Wilson’s coun-'
try in fighting for them against the Allies.
Of. course a peace based on them may be
rejected as insufficient by an anti-WiLSON
Senate, but meanwhile the points are an
unmitigated nuisance. The man who pre-
sents them has at stake his pride and d g-
nity and his chances of re-election in 1920
if he cares to apply, also his impracticability
and his Nonconformist conscience. He
stands for the country which entered the
war last among the important States, and
which, in its haste to send its men home,
promises to be out first. It refuses the
drudgery of police duty and cleaning up in
Russia, Palestine and elsewhere. It didn’t
come in till the Hun violently attacked its
trade, sank its ships, drowned many of its
people and threatened its profits, and till he,
by hideously clumsy diplomacy, left papers
lying about re anti United States intrigues
with Mexico and Japan and hostile propa-
ganda in the country itself. It made such
stupendous profits during the 2f years when
it held its peace that, despite its heroic
lavishness when it really started, it is the
one big Power which shows a credit balance
out of the business. That fact is suspected
of making Wilson more tolerant than states-
men w T hose countries showed a loss. And,
magnificent as was the army that the United
States sent to the Front, it arrived so late
that even Serbia put more men into the
actual fighting line. All these things arouse
impatience over the President’s dictation.
It is his pet idea that there should be no
annexations, but that captured territories
should be put temporarily under a buzzing,
many-headed committee in the shape of a
League of Nations. The League hasn’t been
formed yet, but when it is formed Wilson is
understood to look complacently on the idea
of the enemies being forgiven and admitted
to membership. In that case, when the
League has to decide on a permanent
arrangement, the Hun may get his colonies
back. The arrangement has been slightly
modified inasmuch as each ex-llun posses-
sion is to be administered for the time by one
State as agent for the League instead of by
the whole swarming institution, but still the
business is unsatisfactory. Yet it is alleged
that the high-handed President threatened
to shake the dust of Europe off his feet, and
withdraw the light of his countenance and
go home, unless the majority gave in to him.
The President’s marine policy is dis-
tinctly anti-British. It includes various fea-
tures, but the principal one is that no nation
shall maintain a fleet that is supreme on
the seas. Britain is the only nation that
seriously attempts this. The reason for so
doing is that it is—barring Japan, which is
a new arrival —the only great Power which
has its headquarters on a small group of
islands. Also it is the only great Power
which can say that over 99 per cent, of its
area and nearly 90 per cent, of its popula-
tion are located either on islands far away
from headquarters like Australia, Maoriland,
Tasmania. Papua, Newfoundland and
Jamaica, or in places like India, Canada and
South Africa which can only be reached by
sea. The proposition that Britain shall not
maintain a greater navy than, say, the
United States means that the nation to
which sea power means life or death should
gamble on equal terms with the one to which
sea power is only the smallest of incidents,
as it proved many years ago by abandoning
as a thing of no account the sea-control that
it once held. Incidentally the same propo-
sition would mean that Canada would only
remain British so long as the United States
felt inclined. The Dominion would nro-
bably go the way of Arizona and New Mexi-
co., which dropped from the nerveless hards
of Mexico; or of California, Texas and
Hawaii, w'hich were first “peacefully pene-
trated” by Americans, than put by revolu-
tion under a temporary Government com-
posed of the peaceful penetrators, and finally
handed over by the temporary Government
while the old inhabitants looked on in aston-
ishment. The President is also opposed to
heavy indemnities. The Allies say bitterly
that a country which wasn’t ravaged by
war. and which really made a lot of money
out of the great disturbance, can afford to be
generous at other people’s expense. In this
matter, as well as that of annexations,
Wilson’s policy seems to be to keep Ger-
many strong as a counterpoise to Britain
an! its Allies, and to earn Hun gratitude.
Exactly why he is so anxious that Britain
should be counterpoised it is hard to say,
but the Canadian position may have some-
thing to do with the case. The war-sluggish-
ness of the French-Canadians, who represent
nearly a third of the population, has created
an idea that they haven’t been so much
assimilated as .was. imagined. They and the
United States immigrants—a numerous class
—might repeat the cases of California and
Texas and Hawaii, not to mention Panama,
if Britain lost control of the seas.
Then, too, he is understood to claim that
the “acceptance” of his 14 points by the
Allies nullifies all previous obligations which
they may have entered into —this despite the
fact that no nation save Germany accepted
the points unreservedly. It is commonly
understood that agreements were entered
into, or promises made, by one Ally to an-
other, in the dark days when Russia was
proving a broken reed, and the United States
still held aloof from the cause of civilisation
and worked up a profitable connection out of
the. trade which the Allies had lost. It was
a time when friends or possible friends had
to be propitiated, and a Republic which
established its independence with the aid of
the despicable French monarchy has no rea-
son to criticise. There is talk of agreements
with Japan about certain Pacific islands;
with Italy about certain Adriatic ports;
with the Sultan of ILedjaz about a city that
his soul covets; with Roumania about the
annulment of the disastrous cessions made
by the treaty of Bucharest; and possibly
with . Greece about some fragments of the
Archipelago. It is now claimed that any or
all of these must be treated as “scraps of
paper.” They are to be over-ruled by the
bumptious and omnipotent 14 points which
must not be treated on scrap-of-paper prin-
ciples, though it is quite possible that the
new anti-WiLSON Senate will scrap any
Wilson treaty with scorn as the unauthor-
ised production of a man in whom the coun-
try has lost confidence. One way and an-
other Woodrow Wilson, retired college
professor, becomes rather a burden.
TRADE AND TUMORS.
The measures taken to keep pneumonic-
influenza under control nrovide a lesson in
social and industrial interdependence which
should be useful these Bolshevist days. Because
of the dreadful advertisement which Sydney,
for example, has given itself, those country
visitors who ought to be in ev : dence are at
home. The hotels and boarding-houses are
sacking their employees because there is no
employment, or prospect of it, for them.
The closing of the bars has robbed another
batch of regular workers of their jobs. The
suspension of the theatrical and picture-
shows has put a further big section among
the out-of-works, and since suburbanites re-
main indoors the restaurants are empty and
their proprietors are getting rid of an army
o': waiters and waitresses. Bandsmen are
catching fish, and orchestra-performers are
looking for pick-and-shovel work. Embarrass-
ment, want, even misery, are hitting people
from unexpected angles. So delicately poised
is the social system of a civilised community
that the tragedy is inevitable whenever any
considerable dislocation of the machinery
occurs.
A big surgeon remarked once that he
could gauge the extent and seriousness of any
drought by the number of tumors he re-
moved. At a glance there does not seem
much connection between rain and surgical
operations. Yet on consideration the thing
becomes obvious. The trade rhythm of a
prosperous year is unvarying. N. S. Wales
country people come to Sydney in January
and fill the hotels, boarding-houses, clubs and
shops till the rain arrives in February. At
Easter they appear again—more numerously
than at any time, since the shearing is over
and the wheat is safe in the bag. Business
booms for a while after Easter. The next
four months are slack; but in September
and October, when the races are on and the
Waybacks are buying their Spring goods,
there is another rush. That is a N. S. Wales
year when things are good. But there is
another side of the picture. To the country-
folk rain alone ensures prosperity. If it
fails their bank credits evaporate as surely
as the water in their dams. Crops fail,
sheep and cattle die, the banks close down,
and possibly it is just at this moment that a
bush-fire comes to administer the knock-out.
The backblocker gets a bit thinner and
greyer, but he remains hopeful; and so does
his wife. She is perhaps ill. In a good sea-
son she would have come to town. As it is
she sits through the swelter of a hot day on
her once vine-clad verandah, looks out over
the. paddocks where not a blade of grass re-
mains, and sees the sheep or cattle move
painfully over the scorched ground—and
waits. She knows her danger, but there is
no rain, and so she cannot afford to be sick.
And because she cannot afford to be sick a
doctor a few hundred miles away loses a
fee, and a private hospital is short of a
patient; a city florist loses the contract of
sending her flowers, and a city hotel loses
the business of catering for her husband.
And so on up and down the gamut.
* * _ * *
That the rain should periodically go on
si l ike is one of the unalterable conditions
of such a climate as ours. And rare
indeed is the citizen who is unaffected,
in a greater or lesser degree. If there is
big money lost in Bourke or Bathurst, it
will be reflected in the form of unemploy-
ment and raised prices in Balmain or Bondi.
The miuers down tools in Newcastle and, as
an immediate result, goods cost more to
deliver at Narooma or Narrabri. As often
as a business of any dimensions fails, or
suspends, a crowd of workers, many of whom
may have never heard of the concern, lose
money or money’s worth. It may be regret-
table, but so it is; and no political econo-
mist has even dimly foreshadowed an
arrangement that promises to work better.
The One Big Strike enthusiast —here as in
Russia and Germany—aspires to make every-
body happy by dislocating, not one or two
or half a dozen industries, but all of them.
Under existing circumstances the wife of
a hard-up farmer or pastoralist may have
to defer her visit to a specialist. Under the
state of affairs aimed at, the country-dweller,
affluent or otherwise, will be unable to come
to town at all,, unless on foot or by bullock-
waggon, since in the general strike, of which
the 0.8.U'. is the precursor, the rail and
steamer transport business must be the first
to go. Sydney workers get a taste of what the
absence of Sydney visitors means to them
with every drought. They are getting a
further experience as an outcome of the
Government’s preventive measures against in-
fluenza. Does any working-man hanker for
a situation ten thousand times worse, econo-
mically, than the one which exists- at the
present time? If so, he knows what to do.
He need only support in sufficient strength
any movement which has for its first object,
not merely the temporary closing down of
a few bars, theatres and picture-houses, but
the bursting-up of all local industry, and the
inevitable accompaniment of that, the destruc-
t’on of the national credit. On the other
hand, remarking the way in which for good or
evil the fortunes and happiness of citizens
are bound up together, he may decide against
this form of industrial hari-kari, and in
favor of bettering his lot by political action.
It is a matter for his own judgment.
A GOSPEL OF SKITE.
Utter self-abasement, humility, contrition
and meekness are supposed to be the quali-
ties of the orthodox Christian. It is a view of
things that doesn’t work, never has worked ;
it is rather a disease that calls for a strong
antidote in the encouragement of the essen-
tial spirit of brag that is so closely linked
with endeavor after mental, moral and
physical superiority. Every flower that lifts
its face to the sun is endeavoring to shout
to the whole cosmos the glory of its coloring
and form; never a bird sang out its heart
on a bough without making in its top notes
an appeal to heaven and earth to grant it
the honor of being first musician. Brag
fills a real part in the order of nature. The
wish that lifts the living creature a step
forward on the road of evolution is not
really effective until that creature has forti-
fied itself with a solid boast of all that it
intends to do. If we knew their language,
we should find in the sparrows’ morning chat-
ter a brag that their little brown feathers
should yet outshine the plumage of the bird
of paradise; and who knows but here and
there a prophetic cat upon a midnight house-
roof is not proclaiming that the splendid
stealth of his race will yet win the victory
over man, the present guardian of the milk
jug? The working of the great law is seen
clearly among savage warriors. How should
the courage of a race be kept up if not by
bragging of the things it has done? Ger-
many—as savage as anything that shone
black in the sun under a top-knot of feathers
—put the scheme into systematic working
order during forty years of preparation for
the great struggle. Britain—doing the
meek-and-lowly-before-your-betters act with
mild enthusiasm on Sundays—howled “Rule
Britannia” at herself with such zeal and
enthusiasm that for sheer shame of her own
opinion she couldn’t very well do anything
else but rule the waves. All along the line,
brag has been the forerunner of intense and
sustained action. Rightly or wrongly, it
calls out the best force that is in a people;
and the Buddhist-Cliristian attitude of door-
mat subservience and flabby non-resistance is
merely mud in the path of those who do the
boastful shouting.
The value of brag to man rests upon a
sound basis of experience and observation.
Words are the foundation of upward effort,
in the human sphere. Without words it is
impossible to think; but thinking without
vocal expression leaves a much smaller per-
manent impression on the brain than actual
speech. Further, man is curiously linked
up with his fellows; and to some extent he
loses the edges of his individuality where
they merge into those about him. Thus his
open speech of a thought previously formed
and rehearsed in the mind not only makes an
impression more or less permanent on his
own brain, but impresses those of the men
about him also. This doubly fixes the thing.
-Having said the words in the hearing of
others the speaker not only shrinks from
going back upon them, but actually finds a
pleasure in enlarging and intensifying them;
and his hearers being in turn affected, there
is a kind of progressive force of thought
pushing all in the direction of deeds. This
fact was taken good account of by the
framers of church creeds. The faithfui were
called upon not merely to read and sign the
document of their belief, but to repeat it
aloud in the presence of others as frequently
as possible. Of a similar nature are political
gags and catch-words. Whatever their pur-
port, if they can be repeated often enough
and loudly enough they will do their work
of unseating a Minister or smashing a policy.
When gag meets gag the fight ranges and
rages into all sorts of strange utterance;
but the gag that grits its syllables and
clashes its consonants with most conviction
wins through. Knowing- these things, the
immense value of national skite must be
apparent. The nation is made up of indi-
viduals; and if every individual of the
nation boasts of what the nation is going to
do, the result is bound to be a wave of en-
thusiasm which will at least produce some
of the results bragged about. Silence, self-
depreciation and modesty are often forms of
cowardice, just as a boasted refusal to “talk
shop” is the seal and proof of ignorance.
A free tongue is the symbol of a free nation;
and the chances are a thousand to three that
a loud is the symbol of a forceful one.
There are things that Australia, above all
countries, requires to learn. We are too
quiet and restrained for the large job of
occupying a whole continent. Our soldiers
swung into the European scrap with a
laugh; and when they had behaved again
and again like the three hundred at Ther-
mopylae, when they had snatched victory
from defeat, when they had done the im-
possible, when they had taken a furious foe
numerically stronger than themselves and
smothered him in his own mud, they came
back, and for the most part wanted to say
nothing about it. Had any band of ancient
Greeks done as much in a year as our sol-
diers did in one day of the present war
every freeman from Attica to Sparta would
have stood up on a marble column and made
an oration about it at the full stretch of
his lungs for the term of his natural life.
Here in Australia we did say some things
about our heroes; but how few and unim-
portant they were! Why, the thing that
sent the proudest flow of blood to Australia’s
swelling heart in the whole tremendous busi-
ness was the knowledge that our men had
the best boots in the world! We must get
away from this strange slackness of the
jaw. The great gospel of skite is worthy
to become a national religion. It is not
what the world thinks of us that matters;
it is what we think of ourselves. The great
spur to endeavor which lies in the jaw must
be put to highest national uses. An Aus-
tralian bragging of Australia to Australians
is a nerve centre of new power. We have
the best country in the world ; it is manned
by the best people; we are going to make it
greater and finer than all the countries of
the world put together. There is the great
creed —the creed of victory. Every time
a man says, that he feels more Australian;
and Australia feels more like herself.
THE SPIRIT AND THE WORK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Australian i.s still at heart the best
workman in the world despite the poison of
the 1.W.W., that rottenness of importation
from a poor country where ill-paid, ill-fed
labor had but one recourse on cruelly rapa-
cious capitalism, and that ca’ canny and
loafing on the job. And there is still the
Australian spirit in the work. The other
day at Maryborough (Queensland) Walk-
ers. Ltd., cast the first stern-posts and
rudder-stocks for the first ships of the Aus-
tralian Mercantile Marine. They were
steel castings up to nine tons in weight, and
of awkward shape and configuration. Their
final test was a drop of nine feet to a hard
floor, followed by an assault by blacksmiths
with 40-pound hammers. A fine thing
that psychology of ‘the real craftsmen,
anxious for that first casting as if they
owned it, apprehensive with the spirit of
the artist and not of the hireling. And
when the casting fell and did not break
they attacked it joyfully with their orchestra
of 40-pound hammers, and looked like cheer-
ing it as the first rudder-stock of the first
ship of Australia rang like a great bell.
There at least is the spirit of the work —the
spirit indestructible.
The machinery that killed the artist in the
workman has had a little to do with the lazy
strike. The disgust of labor, that sees science
toiling for discovery to enrich fools, and the


inventor just clever enough to invent but
not to prevent dull capitalism exploiting
him, lias bad something to do with it; Dut
mainly the cause is conditions not piesent
in Australia, and not to be present unless
Australians play with the imported poison
for so long that a more slavish race driven
by tyrants make conquest of them.
Despite a powerful opposed press and
their resources of wealth and privilege,
Labor ruled Australia—until hysterics
debauched the people’s ability to reason,
and left to itself constitutional Labor
will rule again. It has evolved a completely
Australian political thought and method,
and the major enemy of Australians is the
imported poison of the 1.W.W., second only
in its anti-Australianism to the imported
dope of Tory superstition. These are the
enemies of Australia, imported ca’ _ canny,
imported lazy strike, “irritation strike’ —a
stupid quilp-like thing true to label; the
strike to “attack the master-class at the
point of production” ; the imported believer
in free entrance to the cheap labor of the
glorious Empire and the free entrance of
the cheap manufacture of the same ; the im-
ported Imperial Federationist who would if
he could hand over the destinies of Australia
to an Imperial Parliament with Australian
representation therein reduced to a thing too
small and mean even to rank as a
minority, so that privilege in Aus-
tralia would rule, knowing as little of
the facts and as incompetent to judge
them as the Privy Council is to adjudicate
in appeals against the verdicts of Australian
Courts ; and so that the Commonwealth might
be that in name only, while actually a col-
lection of “Crown Colonies.” With these
are enlisted the Freetraders whose imported
fetich in the country of its origin gave Ger-
many the money to fight us with ; and the
quaint immigrant politicians who opposed
universal service for Home Defence and
then yelled for Conscription for service
abroad, and who fought the establishment of
the Australian navy “because it was to be
used to fight England.” These are the things
Australia has to fight; let the I.W.W. and
that anarchist, the incurable and changeless
Tory, coalesce as our one enemy, so that
Australian democracy need sharpen only the
one axe for the_ one neck.
The world, and especially the old world,
was wrong enough to make war possible
always—meaning that the power of supreme
things was in the wrong hands, the right
hands being the hands of the people. It gave
the loafer that which he did not earn and the
glutton that which he did not grow; but the
idea that the cure for all that wrong is that
everybody should be a loafer is plain mad-
ness. In Australia, which of all the coun-
tries of the world has the most work to do
and the greatest prizes to win, and the best
methods —not yet perfect, but slowly being
perfected—of justly apportioning the prizes
to the deserving, the advocacy of the capri-
cious strike and predetermined slowing down
is plain crime against manliness. Idleness
vitiates ; waiting for dead men’s shoes viti-
ates ; dreaming that the Promised Land will
come when called, and the moon descend to
earth by wishing, these demoralise ; and the
line of the least resistance is a fatal weakness ;
but taking money and not putting the spirit
into the work is hell. These extremes meet;
the witless, gutless capitalism that would
like to work men 10 hours a day for 30s. a
week, and the witless, gutless 1.W.W., which
wants £5O a week for doing nothing. They
try to cure poison with poison—successful
sometimes in physical but never in mental
operation—and society does not require
poppy nor mandragora, but an emetic and
a purge. Australia, proceeding with its
work —unrecognised by most, but still there
—of educating the world to the just social
relations of the people, must work not less
but more. Better work than any other
people show is the price we have to pay for
Australia; not the quick flash of war cour-
age in our own immediate defence —though
that, too, will come —but the steadfast en-
deavor of men who know the transcendent
quality of their land —who love and who be-
lieve.
It is a matter not for World-Socialism as
represented by the cold, sane Socialism of
the German school, nor for the dilettante
Fabianists of England—who write heavy
books for the uplifting of the masses and
then publish at 31s. 6d., so that the literary
dulness can be in every workman’s home;
it is a matter for Australians to be decided
in the Australian way. The gross material-
ism of Germany even produces an ideal —
pitiful, but still an ideal —in thousands of
the front line going to death for a syphilitic
cretin called the Kaiser- The passive, cal-
lous, hypocritical materialism of England
calling itself by fancy names is not for us
either. Neither the battle-murder and sud-
den death of the German dupes, nor the
English cruel treatment of her poor—the
superstition of a ruling-class cheek-by-jowl
with the immorality of a starving mass —
can we choose; and therefore must we re-
ject with loathing the doctrine of the
1.W.W., which was born of both these con-
ditions ; born of the squire who housed his
horses and stabled his villagers; born of
the Cobdenism that drove its best to the
ends of the earth and filled their places
with dirt-cheap aliens. We require neither
squire nor Cobdenism, nor their less stupid
and more direct relative, the German baby-
slayer.
The Australian Labor party is not an
Internationalist. Firstly, the Australian
Laborite can find his brother nowhere out-
side of Australia. Even the American
Laborite is a crude person who has scarcely
even thought of bettering himself in the one
legitimate way, and, more important than
legitimate, the one enduring way, through the
ballotrbox. The Indian comrade and the
German, the Turkish comrade and the Rus-
sian, the Japanese comrade and the
Spaniard—these may work out their
economic salvation in their own way,
and better through a European Confedera-
tion than by any other. But for Australia
to get into step with these in their march
to pure democracy. Australia must sit down
for 10 or 15 or 20 years and wait for the
procession to catch up. And that isn’t the
Australian’s way; and if Australia waited
and found that it had waited merely for the
I.W.W. to be in the vanguard and nearest
the brass band it would live to be sorry that
it had not gone ahead in its own way at the
double. Enduring power is slow of posses-
sion • but when it arrives it lasts. Else, but
for the settled habit of mind in most men,
how could the myths and phantoms we call
kings live in the same age as airships and
electric light? . „ ,
The other way of ending old privilege a.nd
tyrannies is (in Australia at least) as
stupid as vain. Sabotage, waste, idleness—
these are dragon’s teeth. We of the Aus-
tralian Labor party have a programme and
belief in State enterprises —State Socialism
ever widening and broadening into State
ownership or supervision of the. essentials of
production, which are distribuion and ex-
change. State insurance, State meat-supply
—these are but the beginnings. But how can
the triumph of State Socialism be possible
with the accursed doctrines of sabotage and
ca’ canny? Let this virus get into the veins
of a nation destined for State Socialism,
and State Socialism must fail. .
Politicallv Republican, economically Social-
ist, how is‘that ideal State to be secured if
the poison of the loafer drugs the citizen .
The facts are that these immigrants ot the
I.W.W. have been suddenly given the heady
wine of Liberty and are drunk. Their drun-
kenness is not so infectious as they hoped, but
habit is of example. They are helped by
their friends the Tories, who talk of German
gold when it is really the levies of the silver
of easy-going Australian workers- that sup-
ports these blitherers; Australians who care-
lessly throw something into the hat at every
appeal, whether it be international politics or
a bob or two for the bloke who got burned
out along the crik. The only takers of
German gold were the Tory Freetraders,
of York street and Flinders Lane,
who employed those sons of Protectionist
-Germany, Max Hirscii and Ehrlich —one
now dead and the other interned —to lobby
in the Federal Parliament to keep Australia
off High Protection.
There may be a few Australians who be-
lieve in the Direct Action of the 1.W.W.,
which unfortunatelv means Direct Inaction,
and the habit of it for the fool who practises
it; but the real Australian who can think
knows that his sword and shield are Univer-
sal Suffrage and a knowledgeable value of
their exercise.
It is not for the Russian demo-
crat suddenly released from kicks and six-
pence a day "to call the time for a country a
century ahead of Russia industrially—al-
though the admirable Russian soviets must
greatly benefit the world quickly.
One remedy for the white-ant of 1.W.W.-
ism is a re-arrangement of the immigration
laws. Let every immigrant face a probation
just as if he had to be naturalised. The Aus-
tralian is born to a vote, and is not self-
conscious with it, his early education being
partly political; but most of these immigrants
never had a vote until they came to Aus-
tralia, and it should be withheld for three
ot four or five years, until they are so used
to liberty that it is no longer a heady wine.
Without a vote the immigrant advocate of
1.W.W.-ism could not get an audience.
And let these two bodies of anarchy—the
Tories and the I.W.W. —coalesce, so that they
may have only one head for the
axe. Let every good Australian rank
himself in the fight with the sane,
business-like Laborites whose work is
the defeat, both of the incurable and im-
ported Tory crying for the renaissance of
departed privilege, and of the immigrant
I.W.W. whose idea of reform is to nut a
watch under a steam-hammer _ and knock
seven bells out of it because it loses two
minutes in the day.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Weary, Weary Waiting.
Marshal Foch, the supreme soldier, issues
occasional hints about the laggard ways of
the Peace Conference. The German isn’t
disarmed yet by a long way—in fact, he is
reported to be rallying his forces under pre-
tence of putting down the Spartacus faction.
A powerful party is raising its head and
agitating for the recall of the Kaiser, who is
still allowed to linger within an hour or two
of the German border, ready to be recalled,
whereas the first business should have been
to put him far out of reach. The little
Allied army in Northern Russia is actually
being beaten by the Bolsheviks for .lack of
reinforcements. The fact is disguised, of
course, in the usual way. It retreats a
little after inflicting heavy losses on the
enemy, or it retires to shorten its line, and
take up a stronger position. But it is
retiring, and the fact puts new life into
the Bolshevik despotism. The Allied forces
at Perm and Omsk —Czecho-Slovaks and
anti-Bolshevik Russians and sundries —are
evidently doing none too well. The Ukraine
republic seems to be dissolving already before
the armies of the two Dictators. The new
States like Poland and Esthonia are defend-
ing their frontiers as best they can against
Bolsheviks and Huns—the Huns have re-
sumed quite a brisk war already—without
knowing what their frontiers are. Foch’s
own forces are vanishing wholesale through
the rush to demobilise, and the Hun has
got to the point of haughtily refusing a
passport to a French emissary sent to look
after the fulfilment of some of the evaded
peace terms. A lawyer who never saw war
has taken possession of the Peace Confer-
ence with his pet scheme of a League of
Nations, while many of the nations which
are to form the league —Greater Serbia,
Bohemia, Poland, Finland and the Smaller
Baltic principalities—aren’t created yet. To
the matter-of-fact soldier it appears that the
first essential is to fix the limits of Germany,
whether the area inside those limits becomes
one State or several. The second essential
is to make it plain that the Hun must keep
inside those limits instead of having his
forces and his agents wandering at large in
No Man’s Land, the penalty being renewed
war and possible further loss of territory. The
third is to reduce the Hun armaments at
once, without waiting for the general settle-
ment. The questions of indemnities, of the
allotment and administration of the terri-
tories that are not to be Hun, and of a
formation of a permanent LeagueB of : JNa

The Uses of Advertisement.
According to many distinguished medical
authorities Australia has had influenza for
months nast—some of it pneumonic, some ot
it otherwise. Reports of its devastations m
America, in S. Africa and, finally, in M.L.
began to pour in. The A. S. T\ ales Gov
eminent, as they say in the Army, got the
wind up; and. though the tally of deaths
is paltry, the community has been called on
to make tremendous sacrifices as regards
both its comfort and its prosperity, lracti-
cally the whole urban population of -N. p.
Wales has uncomplainingly clothed itselt in
masks. There has been hardly a murmur
while bars have been shut, places of amuse-
ment closed and public gatherings of more
than 20 persons prohibited. Special patrols
have been organised to deal with people w T ho
spit on sidewalks; regulations regarding the
use of public towels are threatened. _ In a
thousands ways the liberty of the subject is
being interfered with for the latter s own
good. At the worst pneumonic influenza
provides a quick and comparatively painless
death. There is nothing discreditable about
it And if the patient fails to die no taint
remains behind to make the lives of future
generations a shame and a misery. There
is on the other hand, a disease which, while
less dramatic in its first onset, is, m the long
run, many times deadlier as regards both
the individual and the nation than the worst
form of influenza. Scores of Australian
people are contracting it daily—many of
them innocent women and children. Hun-
dreds are dying every week as the direct
result of it in every sort of institution, from
gaols, asylums and lock hospitals to big. pri-
vate houses. Such deaths may be either
painless or agonising; but they are always
shameful. And each victim leaves an imper-
ishable legacy of suffering behind. This
disease, syphilis, only survives because it
has been inadequately advertised. There are
few that could be more easily eliminated. It
would have to be made notifiable, as influ-
enza is now. Care would have to be taken
that no infected person entered the area that
was cleansing itself —a defence that .Yus-
tralia has been employing against the influ-
enza for months past. A limited section
would have to submit to inconvenience, and
in various ways forego a little of that liberty
which the whole community is cheerfully
sacrificing wholesale in face of the influenza
menace. Only two things are needed: (1)
a Government with sufficient courage to
alienate what may be called the syphilitic
vote, and (2) that the horror which has
always been with us should get an advertise-
ment approximating a little to that which
the new arrival has had. Of these two the
greater boon would be the advt.
“Rewards” and “Judgments.”
“The Bible shows impressively that when a people
who have God’s covenant given to them have the
bitter experience of war, pestilence or famine,
such a people should pause and consider if their
manner of living is right before God. The Bible
shows us that public calamities may be God s
correctives for non-reading of the Scriptures, non-
attendance at the public worship of God, and
desecration of the Lord’s Day.”— A cleric on the /til
invasion.
From Mieuport down to Amiens, where the
A.I.F. has fought and rested during the
past three years, there are three churches
to the mile, with shrines at the
cross-roads, and crucifixes and more
shrines by the wayside. Not all of
the people of Belgium and Northern
France are pleasant people to meet; dour
meanness and avarice are common failings
among them. But on the whole the men are
straight and the women very virtuous. These
people have displayed the same qualities for
centuries, and for centuries they have had
to endure “the bitter experience of war,
pestilence and famine.” The agonies that
they have suffered since Germany first burst
in upon them in 1914 are such as no human
judge would impose on a nation of atheistic
or pagan criminals. However admirable
Sydney’s morals may be, the inhabi-
tants are certainly not what the
formalist would call religious. The road-
side shrine has never been a feature
of the landscape, and you might search a
hundred private dwellings and not find one
crucifix. The emptiness of the churches and
the congestion of the surf beaches have been
noted by the clergy for years. Yet Aus-
tralian cities, by comparison with most of
the rest of the civilised world, are earthly
paradises. They stand, in every material
respect, where they did before the Great
Anguish. They have fed well and heavily
while London and Paris went hungry ; they
have never so much as seen a bomb fall, or
watched a gun trained on an enemy; and,
so far as the prevailing pestilence is con-
cerned, they are at least in a most favorable
condition to deal with it. The clerical sug-
gestion that people who suffer bitterly
from war and so forth do so because
their way of living is unrighteous is, in-
deed, not only an aspersion on practically
the whole of the British Empire’s Allies,
barring the Japanese; it is also doctrinally
unsound. The Bible insists repeatedly that
the religious must not look for material
rewards here—that, rather, those who are
happy and prosperous in this world may
expect to find the next very different. ‘ Woe
unto you that are rich, for ye have received
your consolation. Woe unto you that are
full, for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and
weep.” There is no suggestion that Dives,
of the parable, was bad, irreligious, a dese-
crator of the Sabbath. His whole trouble
was that he stood in the same position as
Australia does to-day; he was care-free and
affluent. Wherefore he was destined to sut-
fer in the world to come, while Lazarus,
who, on the evidence, had neither more nor
less religion than Dives, was to be re-
warded. The plain fact, which every sen-
sible person recognises, is that the religious
question does not come into this matter ot
pneumonic influenza at all. The problem
is purely one of sanitation. A body ot
people gathered together for prayer are
menaces to one another, and to the com-
munity, in exactly the same degree as it
they were gathered together to play two-up.
Australia will not account for one influenza
germ by suddenly becoming religious. But
it will slay countless billions by a pagan
attention to the rules of health.
’Flu and the Mask.
An influenza epidemic isn’t a mattei of a
day or two or even of a week or two, and
there are indications that the public will
grow very tired of wearing masks at the
end of a month or perhaps earlier. There
is, consequently, infinite trouble ahead 01
any Government which orders the wearing
of masks unless it produces definite and
overwhelming medical authority in favor or
this course. At present the quoted authority
is not overwhelming, and for the greater
part is exceedingly nebulous. Further, the
authority ought to be asked to pronounce
upon the question whether the wearing of
masks can be harmful as well as beneficial.
If the influenza germ cannot travel and five
for more than a yard or so, it is obvious
that nothing is to be gained by wearing the
contrivance when one is rernote from every
other human being. While in such a case
nothing is to be gained it is highly probable
that something may be lost—in other words,
that the resistance of the wearer may be
dangerously reduced. Those who have been
on a plague ship know very wed that the
first people to go down with the disease are
those who are otherwise “off color. lhe
thoroughly fit run far less risk. Theie was
a rather 'striking illustration of that when
the Makura brought to Australia two or
three hundred passengers, among them about
50 furlough officers. These men were almost
without exception in the pink of condition,
and not one of them contracted the disease.
If the mask lowers the vitality in any way,
then the Health Department ought to see
whether a regulation cannot be framed
which will require the mask to be worn
only when it is doing some positive countei-
balancing good.
The Conversion of Australia.
Alma Whitaker, visiting American writer,
tells us what’s coming to us: —
The United States Prohibitionists confidently ex-
pect Australia to “go dry” within a year. They
are lavishly financing the desired conversion, to
which end W. E. Chafin, of California, arrived on
the Sonoma last month. He is the first of a series
of temperance missionaries, replete with eloquence
and political sagacity, who have been selected by
the U.S.A. reformers to rescue the southern con-
tinent from the Demon. Mr. Chafin is no novice:
he twice ran for President of the United States
on the Prohibition ticket, and played a big part
in bringing about the Nation Dry edict which goes
into effect on July 1. He was responsible for
making Arizona dry several years ago, and Arizona
had been the hardest drinking State in the Union.
It was reckoned little short of a miracle at the
time: the cynics declared it couldn’t be done.
The U.S. Prohibitionists have great hopes of
Australia. You may seem to be hopelessly pickled,
but they will save you in spite of yourselves. Mi.
Chafin comes from California, and I know how
respectable he made us. The reformers began on
us, even as on you, with restricted hours. Next,
saloons were abolished by referendum. Then
the “no meal no drink” ordinance. There followed
a law which meant that nothing stronger than the
lightest wines might cheer our Haggling spirits.
The manufacture of beer was prohibited to save
grain” as a war measure. The manufacture of
whisky was prohibited to save wheat while the
nation was on flour rations. All areas near train-
ing camps were proclaimed ‘ dry by federal e ict.
No liquor could be served to any man m uniform.
The Soldier’s Burial.
[FOR THE BULLETNI.]
"Wounded Maoriland soldiers at Walton intervened
in a funeral and prevented a veteran soldier who
died in the Chertsey Workhouse receiving a pauper s
burial. The dead soldier had fought in the Zulu
AVar and in the Egyptian Campaign. The Maori-
landers met the coffin, threw the Union Jack over
it formed a bearer party, and proceeded to the
cemetery, where an Anzac bugler sounded the
‘Last Post’ at the graveside.” — Cable.
He had but fought as others did
The Zulu impi at the ford;
Old age and rags his valor hid ;
The workhouse gave him bed and board;
His beard was grey, his foot unsure,
The old stiff shoulders learned to stoop;
He thought the hard thoughts of the poor
Above the tasteless pauper soup.
A common soldier who had seen
Hot blood on brown Egyptian sand,
Who wore a medal, served a queen
And tasted husks on British land.
A common soldier —that old name
Fails on a conquering people’s breath.
To-day he wears no badge of shame
Who gave his all to dice with death.
They threw the flag across his breast,
They marched him home with honors due;
For he, as they, had served his best;
And they were soldiers and they knew.
And, as the “Last Post” sounded clear
Above the grave of all the past,
It breathed a message men must hear:
“The soldier wins his own at last!”

No liquor could be served to any people with a
man in uniform. They did it little by little.
When the armistice arrived and celebrations were
in order, our ebullience was still maintained strictly
on iced-water—on iced-water and noise. Incidentally,
as Chafix will tell you. the Associated Charities
reported improved conditions.
Cut, long before I left, alcohol had lost all caste.
No one could afford to claim his public acquaint-
ance. The war brought us a wave of sobriety. There
was no room anywhere for the drunk. Employers
put the kibosh on any old kind of drinker, moderate
or otherwise. The thing just wasn’t being done.
So now you know what is going to happen to
you. Sydney may have her three and four “pubs’’
to every city block and scattered round her home
sections; but her Demon is passing, passing. In
Australia he has been, and still is, a very careless
demon. I have seen more drunken men in three
weeks in Sydney than I ever saw in my life
before. That’s the beginning of the end. The
modern woman won’t stand for that, not even the
Australian woman, when she finds out she needn’t. An
alcoholic male around the house is a damned
nuisance.

The Squabble between Dago and Serb.
Tiie squabble between Italy and the restored
Serbian State over the strip of land on
the east side of the Adriatic is big enough
to be interesting, but not big enough to
endanger the Alliance. Italy has claims
on a fringe which might cut Serbia off from
the sea, as the heir of the old republic of
Venice, the wonderful State which built up
a supremacy of the ocean with only a group
of muddy islands for its headquarters.
Venice in its glittering time owned a great
part of Greece; in fact, it put up the last
wild cat fight against the Turkish con-
querors in those parts. It possessed most
'of the islands in the Mediterranean, a bit
of Syria, anti ports all down the eastern
side of the Adriatic. There is a narrow
streak of Italianism along the coast. The
man who potters along the shore in a boat
is liable to think the place is Italian, while
the hoof-traveller who follows the coast two
miles inland thinks it is Slav. In the 52
years during which Austria owned Venice it
held this thin fragment of coast as the
violent inheritor of the republic. AA r hen
Venice became a part of the Italian king-
dom Austria still retained the thin fragment.
Now some people in Italy demand it as
part of the unredeemed country, and an
Italian Ministry has been disrupted over the
question. Serbia’s claim is that the popu-
lation is mostly of the Serb race; that the
occupation was spasmodic and con-
sisted mainly of the occupation of ports
for trading purposes; and that it doesn’t
intend to be cut off from the sea—to have
the sea actually in sight, yet with a foreign
country in between—because of any ancient
claim made in the name of a republic that
died 113 years ago. Such Italian popula-
tion as there is represents an immigrant
trading race, which, in the old days, was
always capable of taking to its ships when
trouble _ came, and, Serbia holds, this
shouldn t count against the old people who
grew their cows and hogs in the land and
were tied to it for better or worse. Italy
was the Ally that came in late and stipulated
for its territorial reward before it came in.
The others took their chance and pot-luck;
but Italy, the land which invented the pawn-
broker’s sign and is the most successful fish-
monger in the world, struck a bargain. A
party at Rome says the bargain included the
possession of the eastern side of the Adri-
atic, and certain German-Bolshevik folk
allege that they have found documents at
Petrograd, of all places, which throw an
unhealthy and decomposed light on the sub-
ject. It was there that documents were
alleged to be found proving that France and
Belgium plotted an attack on Kaiser AVil-
liam’s country, and thereby caused the war.
Petrograd seems to be a mine of documents,
all amazing and immoral and decomposed.
The Limitation of Earnings.
A NEW development on the N. S. AVales
South Coast coalfield is a system by which
no miner is allowed to do work to the value
of more than 14s. 2d. per day. This limits
the output and prevents the employers ac-
cumulating stocks with which they could do
“business as usual” during a strike or lock-
out. It also, for want of these stocks,
makes it impossible to fill unexpected orders,
which naturally go somewhere else. Like-
wise it limits the wages, and leaves the
homes more unkempt, and diminishes the
chance of making provision for anything out-
side the daily grind. If there was one
financial genius on the job the men would
be encouraged to earn all they could, and
the compulsion would be to make them put
everything above the 14s. 2d., or whatever
the figure might be, into a savings bank
fund. Then the men would have a better
argument to use against the employer than
a hunger competition, which is a poor busi-
ness for workers who have only been earn-
ing 14s. 2d. per day in the best times at an
up-and-down sort of industry. They could
also start a better colliery than his and run
him out of the market. But there is no
financial genius at the helm; and, besides,
the prosperity of the men would spell ruin
for the revolutionary school of leaders. The
preamble of their published doctrine sets
forth that they should be' trusted and fol-
lowed and put in charge of things because
“hunger and want” are found among the
working classes, and if the working classes
stop hungering then it is all Up, It is
impossible to be a paid but dilatory and
incapable Moses leading the people obt of
Egypt if they come out themselves without
waiting for Moses. There is no madder
man than Moses when he finds himself
superfluous.
Dear Bulletin,- -‘-The latest dodge in Syd-
ney has been to make a corner in chaff-
cutting plants in districts where hay hap-
pened to grow this year. In spite of threats
made by the Federal Government against
fodder speculation, the chaff-sharks have
bought hay freely and are now doling it out
to drought-stricken districts at famine
prices. A good many cookies held their hay,
and now, when they want to take advantage
of the high prices, chaff-cutting plants are
not obtainable, so they are either compelled
to sell to the speculator at his own price
or wait till the mice come or the drought
breaks. The whole business is rotten a.nd
reflects very little credit on Cocky’S associa-
tions. As a matter of fact, Cocky hasn’t the
organisation of a rabbit 5 for when bad times
come cotton-tail generally discovers a
Moses to lead him to the favored spots.
But Cocky is not altogether to blame for
this want of organisation. He
made a start many years ago to
organise, and did well till the
political mob got control; now
85 per cent, won’t join because
they cannot follow the “leaders”
through the political by-ways of
intrigue and jobbery. When the
sharks, jute jugglers and manure
magsmen get together politics
and business are not mixed.
Their business is to skin the
farmer, and they do it every
time. When Cocky fires out the
political humbugs from his
organisations and gets down to
the business of co-operation he
will meet his enemies on even
terms, and my linen will be on
the cocky.—Yours, etc., T. J. A.
Fitzpatrick.
Despite the slump that began in
1914 the N. S. Wales factory in-
dustries held up vastly better
than agriculture or mining, but
the owners are on a decaying
wicket. _ In fact, there are so
many signs of white ants in the
wicket that the need for a little
more Protection and a little less
War-time Profits discouragement
is obvious. In 1913, according to
official estimates, the owners
made £11,080,210 gross (£2072
per factory), from which had to
be deducted rent, interest on capi-
tal and on borrowed money, re-
pairs, rates, taxes, insurance, depreciation, bad
debts, exchange, discount, and the wages of
about 4000 working proprietors whom the
statistician doesn’t include in the wage lists.
In some cases the working proprietor was
the bulk of the staff. In 1918 the factory
owners made £14,716,331 (£2716 per fac-
tory) subject to the same deductions, which
was an increase of £3,636,121. But it re-
quired £6,933,531 wortfi more machinery to
earn the increase, also about £8,000,000
worth more land and buildings, so the manu-
facturer had to sink most of his extra earn-
ings in perishable plant to keep pace with
the times. The locust item which eats up
the gross earnings and keeps down the
profits is “raw material.” It cost
£23,000,000 more in 1918 than in 1913. This
would be a blessed thing if the raw material
was local and its price was spent here. But
if was imported raw material which rose
np like an armed linn and ate most of the
surplus. The argument about imported steel
plates, which are the raw material of ships,
was enough in itself to break the heart of
a millstone.
“M.D.”: The appeal of “Phthisis” (B.
6/2/’l9) that Australia should make prompt
and . comprehensive provision for returned
soldiers afflicted with tuberculosis should be
framed and hung in the Federal Cabinet
room. It is not necessary to go over the
ground which “Phthisis” covered, but I
would like to quote the example that Maori-
land has set in regard to the matter. For
a considerable time past the “heads” there
have felt burdened under the obligation the
country owes to its consumptive warriors,
and they have been searching themselves for a
plan whereby the debt might he removed.
Defence Minister Allen (one of the most
conscientious and hard-working public men
that M.L. has had, by the way) has now
prepared a scheme under which a depart-
mental farm will be ready in the North Island
to accommodate sufferers at beginning of
April, and men with consumptive tendencies
in the South Island will be specially cared
for at a sanatorium at Christchurch, The
details of treatment ale not complete, hilt
a foundation has been laid, and if Australia
had got even that far a lot of good Aus-
tralians would feel a bit better.
It is all very well for the Defence Depart-
ment to sit back and smilingly receive the
bouquets which have been presented to it
by the Melbourne press for its “prompt
action” in closing pubs from which inebriated
Billjims have emerged, but the amazing
foolishness of the Department is chiefly re-
sponsible for such episodes. At a time
when amusement houses were closed and
billiard saloons were forbidden to admit spec-
tators, hundreds of returned men of other
States, who had already put in many dull
days in quarantine on the way down, were
ordered off their transports and put into
camp at Broadmeadows while their ships
wei-e being coaled. The official yarn was
that the boats Could .nOt. be COaiod while
Bill,iiii vas On board, bdt they Wflte fixed
up ail right at Colombo, where he was
strictly forbidden tO iand ; and the Nestor was
coaled by the Hoops themselves at Albany,
owing to trouble with the lumpers. Broad-
meadows was proclaimed a “free camp,”
which meant that the men were at liberty to
wander about Melbourne and acquire what
was going in the way of alcohol and ’flu
germs. Not only were the men for the
MORE CLASS DISTINCTIONS.
PROSPEROUS DISEASE GERM: “I don’t like
the thought of all these police about—

SECOND DITTO : “ Don’t worry, dear boy.
they’re only after poor old ’flu. His
methods are so beastly crude.”
northern States landed in Melbourne, but
the boats sailed past Adelaide and dumped
the S. Australians in the infected Victorian
capital also. Having perpetrated this lunacy,
the military panjandrums obstinately re-
fused the request which was urged by the
Licensed Victuallers’ Association, that “wet”
canteens, under military control, should be
established at Broadmeadows and Port Mel-
bourne, and, if possible, in the city, and that
Bung should be forbidden to supply liquor
to any man in uniform. It is a self-satisfied
ass tfiat can enjoy a meal of bouquets despite
such a record of ineptitude.
Maoriland officials,. through not quarantin-
ing the Talune when she arrived at Apia,
Samoa, on November 7, are blamed for the
terrible death toll of over 8000 in a month
out of a population of 40,000. Passengers
who were suffering from flumonia aboard
the steamer were allowed to land and the
plague spread like a grass-fire. Most of the
great chiefs went under; and thousands of
widows and orphans are dejectedly wonder-
ing what the M.L. Government proposes to
do in their hapless case. M.L. hasn’t a very
enviable reputation in connection with the
black death, although her soldiers in the
Samoan group fought most heroically
against its ravages.
The Canadian Government lias decided to
equip its North-West police with aeroplanes
for patrolling thinly-populated territories.
Last week at Masterton (M.L.) a man
who was missing from his job for a day was
found in his bed sound asleep, and it was
impossible to awake him until he had slept
for 60 hours. Maoriland makes a person
very tired sometimes.
Will Dyson’s book, “Australia at Wdf”
lias at length achieved publication. This
volume of war pictures, with a breezy intro-
duction by G. K. Chesterton, was intended
to arrive upon llie scene about 12 months
ago, as a stimulant for people with chilled
feet; bnt such is the speed of Australia
House that the book only arrived a few
months after the war was ended.
Armstrong, new District Court Judge in
N. S. Wales, has had the unusual experi-
ence of having his very first sentence sub-
edited by the Executive. To a lad charged
With a beastly offence he ordered a whipping

possibly have done the youngster good ; but
the Executive shook its head—the punish-
ment couldn't be resurrected after lyiiig in
its coffin all these years; and, anyway, the
State didn’t possess a flagellatoh
A deputation, headed by OppositiOn-leadef
Prendergast and the Mayor of Wonthaggi
(Vic.), lately asked Premier Lawson to
borrow a bit more and build a few additional
houses in the coaly township. Prendergast
said that many workers’ families were shar-
ing humpies with others ; also that the Gov-
ernment was doing well out of the 100
dwellings it had already erected. True, no
doubt; but the average citizen does not ask
the State to build him a new suburban villa
or a three-roOmed cottage in Footscray.
Can’t the people interested in “our great
natural resources” do a blessed thing for
themselves these days?
“J,A.” oh RyaU and beef-steak;—
Randolph Bedford (B. 23/l/’l9) seems to haVG

ful whether Bedford ife fully equipped for the job.
He Says Bananaland has cheap meat. As a matter
bf fact, meat was never so scarce' or so dear in'
the State as it is at present, arid in many "districts it
is unpi-ocurable. Even in the favored spots .where
the State shops are the price is only relatively low.
Those who . profit by this frenzied finance don’t
exceed 10 per cent, of the population; the re-
maining 90 per cent, not only get no benefit from
the State shops, but are actually injured by their
existence, as a number of butchers in all parts of
Bananaland, fearing State competition, have gone
out of business.
“Brogi” : Carmichael, M.L.A., M.C., is first
favorite for the job of Chairman of the N. S.
Wales Public Service Commission, at £2OOO
a year. The other two places have gone to
Loveridge, present Chief Inspector for the
old Board, and Lieut. Leslie Williams,
Under-Secretary for justice, who for three
years has been eourt-martialiing Aussies at
Salisbury Plain. Williams is still in Eng-
land, whilst “Cal - ” is playing deck quoits in
the Indian Ocean, and probably planning the
future of the new political movement he in-
tends to launch against played-out National-
ism. Those interested remember that fie
rejected tfie YaUco Irrigation boss-cockyship
at £l5OO per annum in 1915; so Holman may
yet lose in a clever throw for a clear run
under ProDortional Representation against
the cold Storey.
More damn-the-expense—
For some considerable time railway passes held
by Federal members have been available over the
State Railways, and at the Premiers’ Conference the
matter of was referred to the conference
of Railway Commissioners. That ..body, which met
in December last, arrived at an arrangement whereby
State members’ passes are to be made available
over the Federal railway in the same way as
Federal members are carried over State lines.
And the question arises and ought to be
answered; “How many free tickets for
privately-owned services do Ministers and
private members hold ?” From one point of
view the acceptance of passes from private
holders of public utilities is even less desir-
able than their acceptance from public
authorities.
Labor in Victoria, which has for so long
officially shuddered at the shedding of blood
on far battlefields, shows signs of a desife
also to suppress the invitations to local blood-
shed. The Labor Call, in a notice of a
“bloodless Marseillaise,” notes that the
author “hopes that an improved ‘Labor Song
Book’ may presently be published, eliminat-
ing all appeals to bloodshed as a method of
reform, in lieu. of the Victorian book last
printed, two-thirds of the songs in wdiich
aim in that direction.” Apparently the local
Laborite sees plainly enough what is hidden
from the short-circuited intelligence of the
True Bolsher—that it really isn’t the thing
to drag the boss out to the gutter and bleed
him there in the name of Brotherhood, while
the rest of the boys throw road-metal into
the machinery.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
‘■John Drayman” ■explains how it worked :
At the Speck’s last general election W. •!.
Connell lost his £25 deposit, having failed to
secure one-fifth of the quota. Cameron, Hingston,
Me Fie and Heffernan all polled higher in the pri-
mary votes; but a re-examination of the ballot to
ascertain, from the marked preferences, what can-
didate would (in theory) have been elected if
Mulcahy hadn’t been in the field, showed that the
almost unknown Connell was marked second on the
bulk of Mulcahy’s papers. Which means that Mr.
Connell will be entitled to wear the tag to his
name and the railway-pass on his watch-chain, and
draw the salary (at the rate of £200,a year) of a full-
blown member of Parliament for about Jive months,
though, as Parliament is now dead and buried, he
will not take his seat thereim —unless he happens to
be successful in the general election due in May or
June next. So the Wilmot division puts up another
record ; it is the first electorate in Australasia, and
perhaps in the world, to be represented in Parliament
by a candidate who lost his £25 “sinker” at the
election.
Melbourne is some.what compensated for
its lack of other entertainments by the
achievements of the P.M.G.’s department.
The other day it tried to see how long it
could take to forward an “urgent” telegram
from Brisbane to Melbourne. It only
required 11 days, but given a bit more
practice it hopes to do it in a month next
time. It is understood that Webster has de-
cided to recognise these performances with
a Distinguished Efficiency Medal.
Pronsting, the Speck’s Attorney-General,
who, with hon. Minister Hays, is running
the whole Ministerial show during the quar-
antine hold-up in Melbourne of Premier Lee
ai d Lands Minister Hayes, is kept on the
jump. Though no case of pneumonic influ-
enza had been reported in Tasmania, Prop-
sting’s first order was for 20.000 masks, in
case of accidents; his second was for the
opening of a dozen or so inoculation depots,
and his third (across the Straits) was for a
further supply of vaccine. Propsting was
Premier 25 years ago, when small-pox struck
Launceston and wrecked the Propsting-
Nicholls Government’s finance so badly that
an abolished income-tax had to be reimposed.
Propsting never headed another Ministry.
“Five Islands”: In view of the “open”
finding in connection with the total loss of
the collier Undola, it is interesting to know
that N. S. Wales Navigation Department
does not look with disfavor upon colliers
leaving port with hatches open, as the Un-
dola did. Recently a boat was leaving Wol-
longong with hatches open, and the harbor-
master insisted on them being closed. The
matter was fought out between the captain
and harbor-master and the Department, with
the result that boats now leave with their
hatches open. They are only open, however,
in a technical sense, as they are so full of
coal that it would be impossible to close
them. Perhaps when a few more Undolas
are lost the hatch covers will go on before
the boats leave port.
“F.B-” : The coming despot of Queensland
is the enraged sanitary man. If the muni-
cipality refuses to comply with his demands
he refuses to sanitate, and you sit down, in
this hot climate, to face the 40,000 devils of
typhoid. If the Health Department inter-
venes it pays him his full price and he re-
shoulders his pan with a triumphant grin.
If your mayor and aldermen, as in Towns-
ville, take up his duties he only smiles,
knowing full well they’ll soon get tired of
it. Contrary to popular belief, the sanitary
man is nearly always healthy and cheerful,
deriving a sort of perpetual hilarity from
his nocturnal excursions. (Barry’s Peter
Pan was undoubtedly one of the Sanitary
Guild who “kep’ it dark.”) If the sanitary
man turns Bolshevik and refuses to run his
van at the behest of Private Enterprise it’s
a clear case of God-help-us. By the way,
it was announced some time ago that Lenin
and Trotsky had raised the wages of Petro-
grad scavengers to £6OO , a year. Perhaps
that accounts for something.
John A. Cochrane, president of the Yic.
Billposters’ Association, spreads an appeal:—
John Hugo, last of the Buffalo Minstrels, has
not died, as stated lately, but is at present an
inmate of Ward 24, Melbourne Hospital, where he
has been the last five weeks. Old John has been
a billposter in the service of the A.A. Co. for the
last 20-odd years. Eight months ago his health
failed and he was in St. Vincent’s Hospital for
six weeks, then an out-patient for some months,
winding up in the Melbourne Hospital with dropsy,
heart and kindred troubles. He is now to all
purposes interned there owing to influenza shutting
out visitors. The Billposters’ Association opened a
benefit fund and organised a benefit concert in
Collingwood (Vic.) Town Hall on January 23,
which was well patronised. The benefit fund is
still open. I’d like to see a few cheques from
some of the people Hugo entertained in the long ago.
The old horse is done, both in pocket and health, at
68. Who will be the first to throw a fiver into
the hat?
THE CRITIC RESTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No lights above the beck’ring floor,
No music and no yells;
No hot feet beating on the floor,
No whirring curtain bells;
No late tram groaning up the hill
With grinding stops and jars.
My feetT upon the window-sill,
I smoke and watch the stars.
It's good to have a rest, of course, and go to bed
at ten ;
But, Lord, how will I stay up late when “Shows”
are on again!
AUSTRALIA.
K.
Back to Ireland,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
man to Scotland ; the Mecca of the million-
aire Frenchman is France; even the Chinese
aspires some day to settle in China. To say
that the Irish patriot—one of the most
articulate on earth —is any less sincere is.
in the same breath, to state a paradox and
level an unmerited insult. There is only
one thing required—that the idea should be
clearly presented and properly advertised.
The proposition will no sooner be grasped
than the greatest movement of population
and wealth in all history must begin. The
Principality of Monaco has been for years
the happiest of States. Owing to the wealth
which radiates from the Casino the inhabi-
tants pay no taxes. All public amusements
and services are free. With the arrival from
abroad of its captains of industry Ireland
would step into an equally favorable position.
A graduated income-tax would provide the
money, and no consistent patriot-millionaire
would object—in fact, the real patriot would
himself demand the reform in order that his
martyred native land might be in some slight
degree recompensed for its years of sor-
rowing.
Turning to another aspect of the matter a
tremendous amount of grief and repining on
the part of capitalist-exiles would be allayed.
Such pain as is indicated in the poem below
About six months ago I was in
Ireland—for the first time in many
years. Then, as in the past, the
difficulty was to find the genuine Irish.
The little Dublin hotel at which I stayed
had an Irish name, but the proprietor was
an Englishman. The waiters, who were
nominally Swiss, looked like Germans, and
the girl who did my room was from London
-—and glad to be out of it too. Every other
shop-assistant seemed to be a Cockney or
a Scotchman. A Lancashire “jarvey” drove
me to Leopardstown to see a racing-stable.
In the stable were several Irish boys, but
the owner was an English widow. Proceed-
ing to the country I stayed with an Aus-
tralian. Three of his neighbors and shoot-
ing-associates were English: a fourth was
half Irish and half English.
Obviously the real Irish are not in Ireland
at all. The further one travels the more
one is assured of it. All over the world —m
London, New York, Chicago, Melbourne,
Sydney—myriads of Irish patriots are to be
found collecting and organising for the
National cause, and talking and writing
enthusiastically about the dear old country.
Men of means apart, there must be close on
a million Irish poets in full work outside
Ireland at the present time. A complete and
automatic solution of Erin’s troubles would
be for all those Irish patriots with, for the
sake of argument, £2OOO a year and up-
wards, to emigrate there.
Why do Successive Downing-street admin-
istrations and successive generations of Eng-
lish taxpayers jib at giving Ireland self-
government? Simply because the place is
full of intransigent English and Scots;
leavened by inimical foreigners, many of
whom are Bolshevik Germans. England
clings to Ireland for the same reason that
Mr. Hughes is trying to retain the Pacific
Islands for Australia: its value is not
material, but strategic. The patriot
Hibernian capitalist is a moderate, not to
say a Tory, on every question but the Irish
one. Pour a few million men of this
level-headed and masterful breed into the
.“distressful country” and they would make
short work of the alien ragamuffins who
have been responsible for so much of its
distress. The English connection would be
no more distasteful per se to this type of
Irishman than it is to Australians —pro-
vided always that there as here it was
shorn of incompetent English officials and
of English interference generally. Sensible
Irishmen would not be likely to object, any
more than Australians do, to be protected
from outside aggression by a fleet which
was paid for by somebody else.
But suppose that, on a point of pride,
they did. The presence of the patriot
capitalists, and their millions would be
more than enough for the English taxpayer.
Erin would be urged to go right ahead, and
run things according to its own ideas. If
it wanted warships the Clyde would be at
its disposal; small-arms, Enfield; material
for patriotic celebrations, Birmingham.
Inevitably, after a time, the capitalists—
being the men they are —would organise new
industries in Ireland. Again the Eng-
lish would be pleased; and as they have
done in the case of so many other nations,
would proceed to buy where they had
formerly sold.
The cynic may hint that the Irish capital-
ists now in America, Australia, the Argen-
tine, etc., would hesitate to live in Ireland.
I have too much faith in human nature to
believe it. They love and venerate Ireland.
They have been saying so in prose and verse
and song for generations. Does the pos-
sessor of a loved mother willingly live any-
thing from 5000 to 15,000 miles away from
her? Certainly not. Is it credible that
men should pour forth protestations of
regard for a country, and yet all the time
prefer another country of whose merits they
say little? No. The Englishman who
makes money goes to England and the Scotch-

Hibernians are gathered together :■ —
THE EXILE.
There was mist on the hills when I left dear old
Erin,
There was rain in her valley se~ lovely to see;
The clouds looked down sadly on sweet Ach-na-Fearin,
And all of it caused bitter anguish to me.
As my ship sailed away, leaving Ireland behind me,
The heart in my breast was as cold as a stone:
Ah, the grief and the sorrow! To-morrow will find
me
An exile from Erin, forlorn and alone.
Melancholy reflections of the kind are
inevitable in existing circumstances. Under
the conditions foreshadowed they , would
vanish like some painful dream, with the
probable result that the repatriated capitalists
would allocate the time now spent in profit-
less retrospection to solid spade-work on
behalf of their country.
There remains the problem of the National
poets. They are stating what they believe
to be Ireland’s case, not merely in all the
English-speaking countries, but in practically
every foreign language as well. Many of
them have never been in Ireland, and so they
have to work on an outworn formula as re-
gards industrial and agricultural conditions.
Others date back to the pre-war period, or
earlier. That is why the world is offered
such fallacious word-pictures as the follow-
ing
BRIDGWIN AND DHUIDHEEN.
(A TRAGEDY.)
Scene : A ruined cabin in a bog. The rain jails
through the roof. A hen lies dying on the floor. An
old couple are huddled over a turf fire.
Bridgwin: The bird is after dying on us.
(A Pause.)
Dhuidheen: Ay! It do be so. {lie stirs the turf.)
{A Long Silence.)
Bridgwin : With the wailing of the owl in the wood
beyond the bird will pass.
Dhuidheen : She will so.
Bridgwin {lyrically) : Nor is the saving of her life
a thing that you, nor I, no, nor the veterinary
surgeon in Donegal itself, could now compass.
Dhuidheen: True for you. She will die.
{A Very Long Silence.)
Dhuidheen : Give me the rent-bag against the com-
ing of the bailiff.
(She hands him, the rent-hag. It is empty. At the
same time there is heard a slow, insistent knocking
at the door.)
Bridgwin: Whist! It is himself knocking.
Dhuidheen {irritably) : For six-and-twenty-years he
has knocked thus, at the fall of the leaf, and
asked for the rent, and never has he had it.
Bridgwin: Nor will he have it this night. {With
passion.) And how should he have the rent with
her that is upon the floor dying on our hands?
Dhuidheen ( starting to his feet) : I am minded to
take my blackthorn to him, and give him a
stroke.
(The knocking is repeated. Simultaneously an owl
hoots, and the hen falls dead. The old couple re-seat
themselves and fall to brooding. A portion of the
roof falls in. SLOW CURTAIN.)
This sort of thing may have been true to
life once. It is so no longer. Ireland
is easily the most cheerful part of the
United Kingdom at the present time, food
being plentiful and trade unprecedently
brisk. A needed step, in order to save the
world much uncalled-for worry on the sub-
ject of Ireland’s miseries, is to get the poets
there, so that they may observe the place
at first hand. A fair arrangement would
be for each immigrant-capitalist to house,
clothe, and generally make himself respon-
sible for from one to 20 National poets on a
pro rata system based on income.
The scheme provides a solution —almost
Wilsonian, I venture to say, in its direct-
ness and simplicity—of what has long been
regarded as a difficult problem in world-
politics.

Thcugh the disclosed net profits are still
below the pre-war level, the directors, are
apparently so satisfied that they have lifted
the dividend a point on both classes of
shares. This means a further £7391 each
half, and, so far as the past term’s figures
are concerned, leaves only one-sixth of the
profits undistributed. However, disclosed
banking profits for the war years should not
be taken too seriously. Certainly some very
profitable lines —-exchanges, for instance —
have been disorganised; but what has been
lost on sardines has been made up on kip-
pers. It is necessary only to compare the
earnings of insurance cos.’ funds before and
since the war to realise how interest receipts
have expanded. It is reasonable to conclude
that, since the banks have to take risks
that the insurance manager would not en-
tertain so far as his funds are concerned,
some banking business has been highly pro-
fitable. And the risks against which man-
agements provided (partly by asking a little
more for accommodation) mostly faded
away.
Of course, most banks have turned a cold
eye on requests for advances of a specula-
tive character. But the following compari-
son of the Victoria’s figures does not suggest
that the management has been in a poorer
position to make profits :

Deduct the £790,000-odd now in wheat and
War Loan advances, and the ordinary
advances amount to £5.870,000 or so. If
that total is not earning more for the bank
than the six millions of five years ago The
Bulletin will be surprised. After all. bank
profits are little more than an estimate, for
the management never knows for certain
that the business which is profitable to-day
may not ultimately end in a loss. And
there is not the slightest doubt that bankers,
not knowing what catastrophe might be
ahead, have been concerned not so much
about showing profits as about getting their
houses in order. There has been some hard
writing-down, therefore, during the past four
years, and it has been all to the good. Per-
haps some of it was very necessary.
The Victoria, besides anything it may have
clone internally, has been able to tack over
£lOO,OOO to visible reserves in the past four
years. Meantime, to make its position
safer, liquid assets have been piled up.
Altogether the bank hblds £2,2449,980 of the
public’s money, and £3,262,829 is in liquid
form. The report gives the liquid assets
as £3,658,251, but of that £395,422 has gone
to help finance the Wheat Pool and has
been included among the advances in the
table above. Including the wheat advances
as liquid, there is thus over 44 p.c. of all
liabilities to the public within quick reach ;
excluding the wheat advances, the propor-
tion is 39.6 p.c. —much more satisfactory
than the 27 p.c. of three years ago. Share-
holders’ funds amount to £1,965,728; so
for every £1 of its own the bank holds
slightly less than £4 4s. of the public’s—a
very safe proportion. The 7 p.c. div. looks
a fair return, but the citizen who regards
banks as extortioners might note that on
capital and reserves' combined the share-
holders are really getting 5i p ; c.

In this case, too, "the inquiry regarding
the price charged by this co. for gas supplied
to private consumers was concluded early
last year in favor of the co.” Probably this
explains why, while the sales of gas have
increased 12 p.c. during the year, the revenue
from sales (including residuals) has in-
creased 17 p.c. The co. hasn’t been so afflu-
ent as the other two which supply Sydney
and suburbs; but the position of all of them
has- been made nice and comfortable by the
new Gas Act, which almost guarantees them
an 8 p.c. dividend. Apparently the charge
which the co. lias been making easily pro-
vides the 24 p.c. on the capital cost which
a co. is permitted to put by for renewals. All
the fixed assets of this co., including land,
are valued at £96,933, and 24 p.c. on that
is £2423. After paying the statutory 8 p.c.
the co. has made that much and a bit over.
As the co. has borrowed £16,650 it will pro-
bably, if things continue to go all right, give
shareholders a chance presently to get 8 p.c.
for a little more of their money, the uncalled
capital being £51,750. Incidentally, having
an electrical competitor in the field, and
living in times when the co. that handles
public utilities has to mind its p’s and q’s.
the directors have adopted a bright idea :
Last year we decided that all . complaints, re-
garding the gas supplies to houses and business
premises should be attended to, both internally and
externally, free of charge, except the net cost of
new fittings, when required, by the co.’s employ-
ees. This innovation, which has been largely
availed of, has given great satisfaction to our con-
stituents and been the means of creating better
relations between the co. ahd the consumers.
Other cos, have lost hundreds of customers,
it is safe to say, through not having the
same system. A gas co. which supplies gas
but refuses to take any interest in the means
by which it is distributed in customers’ pre-
mises is simply inviting them to try the
other lighting system.
This next table gives a bird’s-eye view
of the co.’s progress:—

Which calls for no remark except that the
limit of expansion. has been by no means
reached. Like many another co. this one
finds that its old Articles are out of date, and
it is asking shareholders to qdopt a new lot.
It is interesting to note that one of those old
articles purported to give the co, at the dis-
cretion of the directors power to purchase
and deal in its own shares—a provision
which is “admittedly quite illegal now.”

For the past five years the accounts show
an aggregate net profit of £131.755, while
£135,000 has been handed to shareholders.
In no less than three of the years have
the disclosed net profits failed to meet the
9 p.c. dividend. From this you might con-
clude that the directors were not justified
in maintaining that rate of dividend. But
when sounding a shipping co.’s finance there
are other matters to consider besides the
profit figures admitted by the management.
Everything depends on the amount struck off
for depreciation. If more than a fair allow-
ance is made the disclosed profits are
shrunken; if insufficient, the disclosed profits
are not all true profits. The North Coast
Co.’s balance-sheets, like those of all ship-
ping concerns, are not talkative; no P. & L.
account is published, and no reference is
made to the depreciation allowances. A
shareholder who knows that the S.S.
Bumpabar is rapidly qualifying for the
knacker’s yard has to trust to those inside
that sufficient revenue has been set aside
from year to year to replace the old
ironmongery.
But if any one particular year’s accounts
are not over-illuminating, a comparison with
■previous accounts throws some light on the
position. Go back 10 years;—

Since 1908 £81,250 of new capital has been
got in, and liabilities have increased by
£20.721. Total, £101,971. Meantime more
or less liquid assets have expanded by
£141,455, and many ships have been paid for.
Here is a further comparison:—
1908. 1913. 1918.
Assets apart from ships,
wharves, etc. .. ... £41,962 £116,972 £183,41/
Liabilities .. .. 15,194 24,323 35,915
Surplus.. £26,768 £ 92,649 £ 147,502
Thus very little short of half of the paid
capital is now represented by floating assets.
For the five years to 1913 the co. put up
a fine performance. With £81,250 of fresh
capital a dozen new vessels were added to
the .fleet, and after selling off a few old-
timers the management was able to strengthen
its liquid position by £65,881. During
the past five years, after selling three of the
smaller packets, collecting the insurance on
a couple of wrecks, and purchasing one
small vessel, only £54,853 has been added
to the liquid surplus after paying the 9 p.c.
div. From which it seems a fair deduction
that the past five years have been far less
profitable than the previous five.

If it shows anything it shows timidity—a
disposition on the part of people to get
rid of personal responsibility as far as pos-
sible, and to lean up against one another
for mutual protection and support. No
doubt it makes things easier for a trustee
co. ; wherefore, in this case, salaries and
fees have increased only from Is.. 2d. per
cent, of funds (trust and share) in the
latter half of 1908 to Is. sd. per cent, in
the six months just past. The total charge
upon estates, notwithstanding the increased
cost of chops, etc., is still almost extra-
ordinarily moderate. Total revenue last
year was £37,846. Assume earnings of only
4 p.c. on the co.’s own funds, and you get
an almost exact ss. p.c. as. the average
amount paid by the estates for the expert
work done for them by this co. And it
offers more than expert work : it offers, as
well, a cash guarantee that it will be expert
work.
Nevertheless the investor has to keep in
mind always that the public has begun to
realise what credit is. It begins to see
that the State’s word to pay is good enough
for almost any amount; and that will cer-
tainly encourage people to lead, or try to
lead, the State into numerous enterprises—
trustee business among- them. Already one
Australian State-at least has a public trust
office which lias no capital to earn interest
for and is required by law to do the business
at cost price.' This kind of competition is
liable to be very serious. It isn’t a good
answer to say that the man who believes
in private enterprise will stick to the pri-
vate-enterprise concern: you only have to
consider the general approval of the Public
Trust office in Maoriland to have doubts
about that proposition. But trouble seems
a loiig way off so far as this co. is concerned.
And tlie shareholders’ funds are solidly in-
vested, at any rate. The directors, by the
way, have just added £O5OO to their
premises account by buying a neighboring
piece of Bank Place. Premises at written-
down value (less mortgage) stand at
£56,500. Except for £29,150 on mortgage
the rest of the co.’s funds are practically
all in public securities.

So the Maoriland Treasurer now demands
over 6| times more than he did five years
ago, and meantime the co.’s income, after
paying interest to depositors, has only in-
creased from £15,108 to £17,369. From
the surplus of five years ago taxation took

has taken a higher return has been required
of the business put on the books
in the past four years—shareholders’
funds earned 7.7 p.c. in 1913 and
8.6 p.c. last year ; but increased taxation is
out of all proportion to increased earnings.
There was only one thing the directors could
do —shareholders’ divs- had to be cut into;
and even then, while reserves were strength-
ened bv almost £4500 during the three years
to 1915, only £1222 has been tacked on since.
Here is a comparison of the balance-sheet

Though no finance co. knew for certain
where it would stand by the time the war
was over, this co.’s management was appar-
ently not at all concerned. During the four
years to 1917 deposits, etc., had increased
by £49,454, and every penny went into
“mortgages and other securities,” in addi-
tion to all the repayments which had come
in. If everything works out all right—if a
heap of depreciated securities is not dumped
on to the door-mat —these advances will help
future profits considerably. As the table
shows, the management is working on about
£200,000 of shareholders’ funds and £383.775
of the public’s moneys—£377,62l represent-
ing deposits. On what terms these deposits
are held is not stated. If the management
is in a position to hold off creditors in dull
times everything should be all right; but it
would be mighty inconvenient, with 92 p.c.
of all assets consisting of mortgages, if the
money is held on short terms and the cred-
itors suddenly demanded repayment.

Nine years ago this co. took over a 13-year-
old. proprietary concern, and it doesn’t look
sorry. Though the cost of supplies and labor
have increased all round, the past 12 months
have been highly lucrative; gross profits
were £20,246 compared with £16,070 for the
previous year—after writing off an unspeci-
fied amount for depreciation in each case.
Meantime, management exes., taxes and all
other charges have increased from £12,498
to £13,915. The net profit represented 17
p.c on capital; so there was a good margin
left after handing out the increased div.
Of the £2610 available for reserves £2550
has been put into a contingency account,
partly, no doubt, to protect stocks bought in
war-time against a possible slump. This
shows how the co.’s figures have moved since
the first balance eight years ago:—

Since 1910 £S27O of new capital has been
got in and liabilities have increased by £14,244
—mostly due to trade expansicn. Mean-
time stock, book debts and cash assets have
increased by £24,240, while the book value
of fixed assets has grown by £9989. Apart
from considerable additions to premises and
plant, the co. has thus improved its position
by £11,715 since 1910, after giving share-
holders a shade over 8 p.c. p.a. Capital is
£37.200, of which apparently £10,700 was
paid for the old business. Goodwill still
figures at £6OOO. but, as the first table shows,
reserves of £3299 in excess of this have been
accumulated.

the Commercial Bank of Sydney and the

something of the same sort will be done by
others—the Q.N., Wales, ’Asia and Union

The Australian Wood Pipe Co., Ltd.,
which has works in Sydney, Melbourne and
Port Adelaide, has decided to close its S. Aus.
branch. The contracts for the Broken Hill
water-supply and for the Speck’s hydro-
electric scheme are almost completed, and
odds and ends seem to be the best the co.
can pick up until some large water schemes,
at present in suspension, are proceeded with.
Still, the results for the past half-year have
been considered good enough to warrant an
interim 3 p.c. div.

Australia is threatened with serious trouble
in the coal trade, and it is all the result of
one of Hughes’s worst blunders—the pur-
chase of peace in 1917 by permitting the
owners to put up the price 3s. and give the
miners what they wanted out of the extra
profits. There was no judicial inquiry into
the business: the matter was simply referred
to a complaisant Judge, who endorsed the
political opportunist’s “settlement,” and has
probably been sorry for it ever since. Now
the men allege that they are getting only a
fragment of the big slice taken out of the
public and they yell for more. The public,
which is just as much an interested party,
doesn’t do any yelling—it has got into the
habit of thinking that every extra charge can
be passed on. There could be no bigger mis-
take in a country like this. For one thing,
our primary producers can’t pass on their
extra costs. The world’s markets fix prices
for them; and with the extra costs piling up
against them, more and more of them —
farmers, metal miners and others, but farmers
especially—are being pushed out of the busi-
ness. And for another thing the time comes
when, especially with our low tariff, manu-
facturers are also pushed out by foreign
competitors. They’ve got to compete against
Glasgow, for instance, where gas for power
can be got for Is. Id. per thousand, and elec-
tric current for Id. per unit. The 1917 “set-
tlement” was no real settlement at all. It
was a mere politician’s crawl-out of a diffi-
culty. There never has been an inquiry
worth the name into the coal trade. But
there will have to be one,

Abercrombie Mines, Ltd., which is in
possession of the old Lloyd leases and plant
at Burraga (N.S.W.), has been given sus-
pension for six months in view of: the
copper-market tangle. A big quantity of
stone is at grass, awaiting haulage to the
furnaces, but the uncertain market makes
further operations too hot a gamble. The
co. has got away all the matte available
from the bottoms.

The old Milburn Creek copper-mine at
Mt. McDonald (N.S.W.) has been the
subject of a lively scramble by adventurers
anxious to take possession under the new
mining law revoking mineral rights reserved
to owner’s. In all 18 applications had to be
considered. One family tipped how things
were likely to go, and rushed in a dozen
claims, thus increasing the chances in the
ballot that Warden Farr decided to run.
Edith Easedown, of Orange, held the lucky
marble, but Farr gave the applicants out-
side the family a look in by having it agreed
that they should be allowed to take up an
interest in the concern that will re-open the
old mine. The proposition has not been
touched seriously for 30 years; its
career was interrupted by an explosion in
the Cabinet, resulting in one of the Ministers
being blown out.

The C.S.A. treatment works at Ivandos,
the new township on the Mudgee (N.S.W.)
line, is getting ready for smelting this
month. The half-dozen reverbs, have been
given the finishing touch, and the electro-
lytic part is prepared for business. The co.
is said to have put about £50,000 in the
Kandos proposition. The N. S. Wales
Cement Co. will supply the coal and water,
which are just outside the back door, with
the railway line -knocking at the front. The
Cement Co. has taken on further business
in the way of supplying 250 tons of coal a
day to the railways.

Ardlethan (N.S.W.) has produced £218,000
worth of tin ore since its discovery. Last
year’s harvest amounted to £76,000, the Car-
pa thia being the largest producer. Water
is now very short.
* * • •
Drought has brought the battery at Mt.
Dudley, near Trunkey Creek (N.S.W.), to
a halt. Development is being continued, so
that when the water re-appears the value of
the mine may be indicated without further
preliminaries.
Bayley’s old Reward claim at Coolgardie
has been forfeited and passed on to an old
prospector. As a specimen show this mine
was wonderful, and some of those who
worked on the property in the early days
bought into stations or pubs or built ter-
races in Sydney or Melbourne. Dollying
was in full swing night and day and amal-
gam was taken away in lumps. An easy-
going management didn’t seem to mind. The
shoot held down for a few hundred feet in
depth, and by the end of 1894 the best part
of half a million sterling had been taken out.
Then, as usual on this field, the mine lost
value at depth.
* * * *
Tributors are clamoring for better con-
ditions at Kalgoorlie. They ask that agree-
ments cover a minimum period of 12 months
and demand a substantial reduction in the
mine-owners’ cut. Royalties, they assert,
now run up to 40 p.c. of the gross value, and
in some cases the tributors, after paying
for everything, get only 20 p.c. of the out-
put for themselves.

Edna Deeps, with 1050 tons giving £3
4s. Bd. per ton. leads in the Westonia list
of values for January, though the Edna
May total of £6304 from 2074 tons, or £3
per ton, is a close second. A long way
off is Edna Central, with its battery average
of £2 os. 6d. In the distance is Edna Con-
solidated with a 345, return. Deeps had its
best clean-up in June, when, with the aid
of the plates, a £6 return was posted. Now
returns are what Stuckey might call normal;
but his costs are still high, and develop-
ment is a teaser. Edna May is up Bs.
per ton for the month, but that can only
be a flash, for good stone is limited, and
reserves have been drained. Central had
the shock of its life when water was cut
in the shaft. The joke is that Giblin got it
in hand by following the plan of cementing,
as per the lead set by Stuckey at the Deeps,
while all the world scoffed. Central is
pressed for ore until the Consolidated
shoots are available, and their value isn’t
a cert. On the other hand Aldridge has
plenty of ore at the Consolidated, but the
.grade doesn’t pan out up to dish samplings
—unless the tails carry rich values. Con-
trasting the month’s figures with those for
January, 1918, the fact that sticks out is
that the grade is down, the country isn’t
drained of water, and reserves everywhere
are less. So the march to the dustbin is
still in progress.
R. S. Black, manager of the Ivalgurli
(W.A.), thus breaks the news to share-
holders :
“The declension of the mine has been fairly rapid
during the past year.... The position, in brief, is
that the mine cannot now be worked by itself with
any profit; but assisted by outside tonnage for treat-
ment we should be able to show a surplus over
expenses during the time occupied in taking out the
remaining ore, continuing also our prospecting work,
from which there is always a chance of some good
results.”
The accounts show a profit for the 12
months of £7505.
Westonia (W.A.) is considering the advis-
ableness of putting a few S.O.S. cards in its
windows. Adelaide is wondering how it can
engineer another boom before the collapse.
“Mustard Gold”: The Fenian mine, at
Meekatharra (W.A.), whose gold output is
valued at nearly three-quarters of a million,
is one of the few big prizes of the West which
didn't wander on to the London market.
Despite tempting offers, the original syndi-
cate, representing in all 1200 shares, is still
in possession, bar one, the late Tom Ryan,
who passed his moiety on to Mrs. Ryan.
James, formerly the proprietor of a modest
barber’s-shop at Geraldton, obtained the big-
gest cut in the enterprise, securing 380
shares when the Fenian wasn’t thought of
much account; then came Ryan, with 313 J
shares ; Connaughton, 213 J ; Wallace, 213 J ;
the brothers Meldrum dividing the balance.
good mines which have remained in
private hands are the Sand Queen and
Gladsome at Comet Yale. The former
belongs to the Moss brothers, with Frank, at
one time manager of the Big Boulder Mile
proposition, the Kalgurli, the guiding-spirit;
while Denny Meagher and another own the
Gladsome. A few years ago Lionel Robin-
son and Clarke, of London, sampled the
Gladsome under an offer to sell from the
proprietors for £60,000, but didn’t find
enough encouragement on what was left in
the show after a lengthy period of produc-
tion to go on with the deal. More was being
asked for the Sand Queen, which was to
form part of a big Comet Yale amalgama-
tion had the London men done business. The
most remarkable mine in Westralia, the
Carbine, outlying from Coolgardie, is worked
with a small battery close at hand by old-
man Crawford and a number of relatives.
It contains a huge dyke formation showing
400 ft. wide at the fourth level and revealing
occasionally phenomenal dabs of gold which
make up for vast stretches of ore too low-
grade for milling without the sweeteners.
Crawford and family would have taken
£60,000 for the property; but it failed to
stand the test of sampling.

Losses of Bendigo Amalgamated in its
first 18 months :
First half-year .. .. £38,459
Second half-year .. .. 20,382
Third half-year ... .. 10,718
The co. lias thus sucked up £69,559 of hard
cash during its short life over and above
gold won of the value of £241,193. It
started off with nominal capital of £400,000
in ss. shares, of which 1,119,038 were paid
and 480,962 in reserve. As all the callable
capital has been used the Board is out to
increase the shares from ss. to 7s. 6d. each.
This change will mean that the Board will
have 1,600,000 shares on which to make
calls, so that a small levy will keep the wolf
from the door. Of the co.’s liabilities when
the books closed on Dec. 31, the debenture
debt of £25,000 was the biggest item, but
the cash contra against it in six months
had been raised from £3lBB to £17,770
Omitting these items liquid assets are
£16.770 against £18,402 on July 2, last,
while liabilities were £5169 against £5337.
So the statement that there has been less
drift than in the two preceding terms needs
no qualification. Dyason’s programme, when
he gets calls going again, is to complete
plant, pay working expenses and get finances
in trim. Then he is out as hard as a terrier
after a rat to secure the free export of
gold, as he regards that as the cure for
most of his ills. Other Bendigo folk would
like far better to see all Dyason’s and
Moline’s ding-dong work directed to the
opening up of two or three mines of the
Carlisle Constellation type, and The
Bulletin agrees with that view.
Mt. Cuthbert (Q.) has raised the money
to re-start mining work, and the develop-
ment of what is practically a new ore body
at the Ivalkadoon is the Centre of interest.
Bob Elliott, once of Cobar (N.S.W.), is in
charge there. Recent reports about the size
and grade of this new lode have been favor-
able. but its extension upwards and down-
wards has yet to be proved.

Bishop Stretch, who is resigning the see
of Newcastle, was the first Australian-born
and bred to become an Anglican bishop in
his own country. That was 24 years ago,
when he put on the gaiters as coadjutor to
the late Bishop Webber, of Brisbane.
Acting Prime Minister Watt, who has sub-
mitted to be fined every time rather than have
his children vaccinated against small-pox,
was inoculated against influ’ three hours after
Holman and party’s historic retreat -from
Melbourne.
Westralia is in mourning for Colonel Tom
Todd, whose heart failed in Egypt on Jan.
23. He was born in Maoriland in 1873,
and 27 years later received the D.S.O. for
services in the Boer War. He was a promi-
nent figure in Perth for many years after
that, and when in 1914 the Germans began
to break and- enter France and Australia'
said it would be there, Todd enlisted with
the rank of captain and reached Gallipoli
with the 10th Light Horse, which he subse-
quently commanded. He was wounded in
the second battle of Gaza, was present at the
taking of Jerusalem and Damascus, and fin-
ished up with a bar to his D.S.O. and a
C-.M.G. He was a man. After the enemy’s
enfilading fire had mown down two com-
panies he point blank refused to obey
orders and send a third company. For this
he was court-martialled and in reply to the
question : “Why did you disobey orders, sir?”
said “Because I was not mad.” Todd left
the court with more friends than ever.
Died in Adelaide last week, William Gil-
bert, who cut chaff and wore a flower in his
buttonhole and talked to cocky to such good
purpose that when he retired from politics a
few years ago lie was the Oldest Inhabitant
of the Assembly, having been eight times
returned by the one cocky district. He was
never in a Ministry, but he was a good sort
who was always prepared to oblige a brother-
member by sitting on his pet select commit-
tee.
Another Australian decorates the House
of Commons. Major J. B. Cohen, a member
of an old N. S. Wales family (grandson of
Samuel Cohen, at one time M.L.A. for Mor-
peth, and of the late L. W. Levy, M.L.C.),
won a seat at the recent elections. He
fought with the King’s Liverpool Regiment
and lost both legs at Givenchy. He sits
for the Fairfield division of Liverpool.

11. J. Scott, just dead in Adelaide at 71,
was a highly-specialised product of the
International Exhibition system, which Lon-
don started in 1851 and which pervaded the
world for the rest of the century. He came
to Australia just in time for the Adelaide
show of 1881, and S.A. gave him a steady
job at looking after its “court” in exhibi-
tions all over the world, from Calcutta to
Christchurch, from Launceston to London.
After the exhibition fad died out he devoted
himself to pushing the Australian wine
trade.
The imprint of the Barrier Miner, at
Broken Hill, was changed on Feb. 1, after
nearly 30 years. “Jack” Davidson, lately
editor of Melbourne Herald, is the king-pin
of a new co. which has bought out the old
proprietors.
Passed out, at Melbourne, aged 62, Charles
Broughton Boydell, lately clerk-assistant in
the Senate. He was born at Paterson
(N.S.W.). Bishop Broughton, the first
Anglican mitre in Australia, was his grand-
father.
“Q.”: Included in the recent quarantine
picnic to Jervis Bay was a little old man
with a merry eye—James Gormly, a Ma
State M.L.C., now in his 83rd year. Chat-
ting with some old hands at Wollongong he
mentioned that it was 79 years since he
arrived there
with his parents
in the steamer
Sophia Jane. In
the interval he
has shovelled in
the Victorian
diggings, ex-
plored Riverina
and bred and
ridden race-
horses. For 83
years he has
taken a hand in
State politics
and is now as-
sembling his re-
miniscences.

Senator.
Death piayed it low-down on Col. C. M.
Begg, M.D., of Maoriland, last week in Lon-
don. Not many days ago.he was appointed
Director of Medical Services' in M.L., and
was to have left immediately to take over
th° job. He served with M.L.’s Main Body,
in charge of the Field Ambulance, was on
Gallipoli from the Landing to the Evacua-
tion, received the C.M.G. for distinguished
service, and was made a Fellow of the Royal
College of Physicians of Edinburgh in recog-
nition of his work. From Gallipoli he went
to France, was made C. 8., and was on the
field until recently. When the Maorilanders
were attached to the 22nd British Army
Corps Begg was made D.D.M.S. —the only
civilian of that rank in a British Army
Corps.
Dr. Fox, the Balmain (N.S.W.) medical
man who went to gaol rather than wear a
’flu mask, is a recent arrival from F.ji,
where he was an M.L.C.
“Captain” Matthews, who died in Adel-
aide the other day, at 63, had been a mine-
manager in every Australian State. Born in
Cornwall, he was on the Burra (S.A.)
copperfield at six, on Bendigo at 10, and a
goldfield pioneer on the M.L. west coast at
20. His first mine was the Black Hawk, in
Victoria; his next at Beaconsfield (Tas.).
After interludes at Orange (N.S.W.), and
in Queensland and the Territory, he got
early into Broken Hill —where he managed
the "junction mine, and with Zeb Lane re-
ported on a hundred others—and finally
c'ame into the limelight with Bayley’s
Reward, at Kalgoorlie, in the brief days of
its almost incredible richness. He “retired”
to Adelaide in 1596, but could not keep still,
and was Inspector of Mines for S.A. till
1916.
Nobody has yet accused Newton Moore of
exceptional ability, but luck has followed
him closely. Here’s his record. Minister
of the Crown at 35 (15 months after being
elected to Parliament), Premier of West-
ralia at 36, Agent-General at 41, a knighted
Major-General (with no risk of a Hun bul-
let) at 45, and the easiest of seats in the
House of Commons at 48. He is a surveyor
by trade.
Crossed the bar at Blackall (Q.) recently,
J. G. Vidulich, old-time skipper. Tiring of
the sea 25 years back, he followed contract-
ing and shipbuilding at Townsville. One
of his most difficult jobs was the salvaging
of the Brinawar, .which went ashore on Lost
Point in the ’9B cyclone; and he is also
credited with having saved the Sydney-street
bridge at Mackay from collapsing in the
same blow.
W. E. Cook, who helped to build the Adel-
aide-Melbourne line, was back again in S.
Aus. the other day after an absence of over
30 years. This time he was engaged in pre-
paring the final certificates for the contrac-
tor for the Sleep’s Hill tunnel which is to
do away with the shaky viaduct that has
worried nervous train travellers for many
years. Cook, who is a Victorian, came to
S. Aus. in 1876, worked on the main South
line from 1879 to 1885, and afterwards
entered the service of the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment.
James William Lowther, re-elected last
w r eek to the Speaker’s Chair in the House
of Commons, has been on that high perch
since 1905. He is 64 and doesn’t think he
ought to carry on for more than a couple of
years more.
Donald Reid, a sturdy old Maoriland
colonist, went over the hill last week. He
was 15 when he left Scotland and landed in
M.L. in 1848, and he was 20 when he started
farming. In ’6l the goldfields called him
from the plough; in ’63 he was making
history in the Otago Provincial Council, and
from ’69 to ’76 he was Provincial Secretary
and Treasurer. Later he was returned to
the House of Reps., became Minister for
Public Works, Secretary for Lands and
Minister for Immigration. The old man was
86 when the clock stopped.
Captain J. Somerville Murray, who died a
few days ago at Wentworth Falls (N.S.W.),
aged 86, came to Australia with the Har-
binger in 1853, and was aboard the same
hooker in the Black Sea during the Crimean
War. When the hurricane cleaned out Bala-
clava Bay in November, 1854, he helped to
save a lot of lives. Later he ferried troops
to the Indian Mutiny, joined the P. and 0.
in 1859, and in ’B2 came to Sydney with the
new vessel Shannon. Two years later he
was married to Miss Murray, the first
matron of Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney).
Then he settled down to shore jobs, first as
superintendent of the E. and A. Co., and
later in charge of the Brush Farm Boys’
Reformatory.
Captain W. N. Holmes, who answered
the last roll-call at Launceston the other
day, had seen his share of fighting. Born in
Ireland in 1832 he joined the King’s Royal
Rifles in 1849, and fought through the
Kaffir War (1851-2-3), the Indian Mutiny
and the China (1860). From 1878 to 1880
he was burning powder in Afghanistan under
Roberts. His 30 years of war brought him
four medals, three clasps and a bronze star.
Then he sought excitement in the Speck, and
managed to survive the fierce merino and the
furious codlin-moth for 30 years.
“Ziph”: Many ancients have had their
habits put out of gear by the closing of the
public reading-rooms. There is an old
man named John Munro, for instance, who
has been daily attending the Ballarat
Mechanics’ Institute for 40 years. This con-
stant reader, who is nearing 90, is
locally reputed to be the sole survivor of
the London, wrecked in the Bay of Biscay
in '66.

Six years on Monday, Feb. 10, since the
Terra Nova reached Oamaru (M.L.) with
tidings of the death of Captain Scott and
companions when they were returning from
the dash to the Pole. And it is six years
this month since wireless from the frozen
South reported the deaths of Ninnis and
Mertz, of the Mawson expedition.
Passed out at 76, T. R. Arthur, of Entally
(Tas.), second son of Chas. Arthur, who
came to the Speck as private sec. to his
uncle, Governor Arthur, in 1824. T.R.
joined the Bank of N. S. Wales in Vic-
toria, but returned to the Speck and went
in for merinos. He used to take a good deal
of credit for persuading Premier Lee to
enter politics.
RIDING THROUGH THE LEBANON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun devoutly nestled in his crimson-quilted bed,
The stars were kindled, each a silver spark;
Damascus dreamed behind us in the trees, and far
ahead
All the mountains slowly faded in the dark.
But we pressed along the highway with our faces
to the north,
For a whispered word of peace was in the air,
While a spirit seemed to lift us and to hold us
gaily forth
Through an atmosphere of fragrance free of care.
Through the Anti Lebanon, where the crippled Turk
had gone,
Streamed the column like a river to the sea;
And the horseshoes’ rhythmic ringing on the metal
sent us singing
Happy songs that we remembered of the days
when we were free.
We were riding through the ranges when the purple
dawn awoke,
And the horses seemed more eager than of old;
As the strifeless day was dying it was good to
sprawl and smoke,
While the west displayed its color-scheme of gold.
Little villages lay huddled under cover of the hills,
And wc passed them on our journey every day,
Till the land of careless strangers made us quite
forget the ills
Of inaction, and the passion of the fray.
Up in Anti Lebanon where the hills are bare and
wan,
And the treeless slopes are open to the wind—-
It was there we heard the story of a soldier’s day
of glory,
As we left a load of bitterness and trouble far
behind.
They were sunny days of autumn when we turned
towards the west,
Since the guns were eokl and muzzled, while the
steel
Bested idly in the scabbard, nevermore to stand the
test
In the tempest of a maddened trooper’s zeal.
So we took the track serenely through a land that
proudly smiles
With a gift of golden harvest every year,
And tht wooded mountains watched us cross the
sun-enchanted miles,
While our laughter shook the column, head and
rear.
Biding through the Lebanon, while the heavens
smiled upon
Eager horsemen drifting back from ghastly war—
Oh! the road was hard and splendid as it curved
and writhed and wended
Through the olives to the harbor, where the
lighters cross the bar.
Once again beneath the olives did we halt to make
a camp,
While the mountains frowned and smiled alter-
nately.
Many days were warm and sunny, some were bitter
chill and damp,
And the summit-snow o’ermantled crag and tree.
It was grand to climb in cloudland where the cedars
and the firs
Leaned profusely from the steep and snowy slopes ;
It was good to brave the temper of a wind that
ever stirs,
And to feel it fan the embers of our hopes.
Camping in the Lebanon, while the stars demurely
shone,
And fleecy clouds raced over from the sea,
Hope and pleasure dwelt together in the manly,
bracing weather,
For the lurid fire of battle was subdued, and we
were free.
There is music down the valley, and it echoes from
the crags,
Sportive birds are fluting sweetness in the trees,
And we all await an order that will let us fold
our swags
To a rhapsody of whistling melodies.
Every homeward ship is laden with a freight of
love and cheer,
Every tent along the hillside shelters men
Who remember strife and sorrow in a deathly
atmosphere;
Who are face to face with happiness again.
Down the misty Lebanon some are going, some
have gone,
Some are waiting, some are yearning to embark ;
But we all may soon be riding where the loved
ones are abiding,
And the ghastlj' days and bitter are enveloped
in the dark.

IN THESE SERIOUS EPIDEMIC DAYS
Get CLEMENTS TONIC for your Blood
Pure Blood means less risk of infection and greater powers of resistance to epidemic attacks.
The purer the blood the stronger the body. Epidemic disease thrives on the debilitated system.
These are anxious days for Australia, when it behoves all persons to take every care of themselves and ward off to _f reatest
effort the menace to health that threatens them. No one can afford to take any undue risk, and the person who has the condi-
tion of health and the greatest powers of resistance to any invading force, whether it is epidemic disease, privation, oppressive
climatic conditions, worries, or minor illness, is best fortified against it. It is the old story in a new way of the sol lier well armed;
he is shielded from attack of destructive and destroying forces. , , , , . , ..
Clements Tonic, which, for a quarter of a century, has been admitted a medicine of rare health value in keeping the nerves sound
and the blood cool and pure, should non be used as a means to fortify the body and the general health. It tones up the stomach as
well has a palliative effect on the bowels, stimulates the liver and kidneys, and imparts a healthy influence. Clements Tonic is
largely a blood and nerve medicine, and should be a part of the medical equipment of every home at the present time.
Get it from your Chemist To-day. Use it as the Pure Blood Remedy.

PENEOLD'S
WINES
THE UNMASKED MAN.
“Detained in town! I believe you, for you
come home with a strange mask on
that absolutely recks of face powder.”
“Catkin”: Though the war is said to be
over the big remnant of the divisions still in
France are not having what you could call
a pleasant picnic. After two or three shifts
they are now mostly in the neighborhood of
Dinant, with Corps headquarters at a sloppy
little village called Ham; and every other
village thereabouts, is sloppier than the rest.
Officers who take their job seriously, as most
of them do, are hard put to it to keep their
Diggers fit and within bounds. There is
some drill, of course; but the Australian
officer, in order to hold his men togethoi,
must rely more upon sport than parades,
wherefore competitions—of all brands of
football in particular—rage all through fix'
corps. The Education scheme, for which
Bishop-chaplain Long, of Bathurst, has
worked so splendidly, appeals to a few ; but
as practically every man looks forward to
an early call to England and home, the feel-
ing of unrest makes the great majority quite
indisposed to study. In the struggle to keep
men’s minds occupied, cameras, which were
once anathema, have been allowed in; but
unfortunately there isn’t much in this
region to “snap.” AVe are simply living,
four-fifths of us, in the future, always hop-
ing for something to turn up —at the best,
matching orders for Australia ; at the second-
best, marching orders for the Rhine. And of
the latter there seems no hope _ now until
winter, with its appalling mud, is over.
* * * *
The madness of this divided control of
quarantine is well illustrated by the experi-
ence of the Diggers just home by the Argyll-
shire. They weren’t allowed ashore 'any-
where on the way down, but they v ere,
against their wishes, compelled to land in
Melbourne. Coming on to Sydney —1200 of
them —they found that because they . had
been shot ashore in Victoria, the N. S.
Wales State Government insisted that four
full days must elapse between their depar-
ture from Melbourne and their landing in
Sjdney. They were therefore held up in
the Harbor for two days. Almost inevitably
there was a “suspicious case” before the two
days had run out. You couldn’t very well
crowd 1500 or more men on one motionless
ship in any harbor without somebody get-
ting off color within two days. And that
meant more detention. This holding of big
bodies of people on ships in the harbor —
whether within the quarantine area or any-
where else —is simply wicked. If they have
to be held, then they should be held ashore,
not on a stationary ship which gets fouler
every hour. But, you see, the State hasn’t
a quarantine station; that belongs to the
Commonwealth.
* * * -*
“Clifton”: He was a clean-built, quiet,
cheery Australian —the best type of returned
Digger. “No,” he said, “I haven’t started
work yet. The firm promised to keep my
job for me and it was as good as its word.
But when I got back I found a married, man
with six kids depending on it. I’m single,
■and I reckoned it wasn’t good enough to have
him pushed out. But I’ll strike something
soon- Cheerio.” Good Digger, the biggest-
hearted fellow in the world ! And here we
are importing all sorts of stuff from the ends
of the earth, while Australia has chaps like
that walking about looking for a vacant
berth!
* * * *
“Croson”: I wonder if Cold Tea really
knows what it is after when it protests
against soldiers being set up as
growers at Ruther-
glen (Vic.). All
grapes are not
turned into wine
and poured down
a man’s neck in
immoderation. Tons
of grapes grown
close to Melbourne
were last year
carted to the city
and turned into
motor-spirit at a
price that paid the
grower almost as
well as if they had
been carefully
pickled, graded and
packed for human
consumption. And
while the Victorian
Alliance, Council
of Churches, etc.,
are on the job why
don't they make a
fuss about the rear-
ing of pears, apples
and the spud?
And why shouldn’t
rye, maize and bar-
1e y especially

“Sarg”: With the inauguration of the
A.I.F. War Museum a great deal of rivalry
was bred amongst the different Light Horse
units. During the last disturbance one par-
ticular regiment seemed to be on the spot
every time. The other fellows got fed up
with continually seeing “Captured by —th
L.H. Itogt.” emblazoned on everything worth
while. But they stood it till they passed
a broken road-roller with the usual inscrip-
tion, “Captured by —th L. H. Regt.” Next
dav the captors were rung up and the C.O.
asked for. When that officer attached him-
self to the receiver he was asked to take a
little more care of his trophies, as one of
them had wandered into the lines next door
and certainly belonged to the —th, as it
bad “Captured by —th L. H. Regt.’’ on
its back. “On its back! What do you
mean? What is it?” “A tortoise!” came
the reply, followed by the ring-off.

Enthusiasm in a good cause is commend-
able; but it can be overdone. The January
S.P.C.A. Journal makes a suggestion as to
“how to keep one’s memory green.” A
Brighton citizen died and left £2OO to the
Victorian Animals’ Protection Soc. “That,”
says the Journal, “is simply meant as an
illustration of what you also may surely do
fcr the N. S. AVales Society. Do this and you
will never be forgotten. But do it now!"
“75” : Melbourne Exhibition trustees have
acquired some relics of Australia’s first war
vessel, the steam sloop Victoria, which was
built in Britain in 1855 to the order of the
Cabbage Garden, and arrived in Port Phillip
the following year. During the Maori AVar

Wills. In between times she was mostly

her, but in 1880 she was still costing £3OOO
a year for salaries and maintenance. Nobody
appears to know what became of her finally,
and the Historical Society would give at
least tuppence to find out.

“Guinea Please”: “Germtrap’s” demand
(B. 6/2/’l9) that Jack Fitzgerald, N. S.
Wales Minister of Health, and Governor
Davidson should be compulsorily shaved in
the public interest has abundant support
from experience elsewhere. A doctor who
did great work during the S’African epi-
demic says—
By far the greater proportion of men who have
come under the observation of myself and seveial
colleagues as having died of influenza wore
moustaches. The proportion was the more notice-
able as nine men out of ten to-day are clean shaven.
Influenza is essentially a breath disease, and whiskers
around the mouth catch and retain the breath as
trawl-nets catch and retain fish.
No Minister and no Governor has a right to
go round trawling for microbes for public
distribution.

St. Hilda, the Victorian St. Hilda, whose
council spends much of its time, admiring
the lawns on the foreshore, has. just heard
a few things about itself from its sanitary
inspector. Many of its numerous boarding-
houses, with as many as 30 “guests, are
provided with but one sanitary service, and
most of its “lockup shops” with none at
all. Many a barber’s shop uses the same
towel, pot and brush for every customer,
and in some instances there is no. water
supply—in a barber’s shop! There is even
a bank that has no water tap or any other
“convenience” whatever. Of course all. these
obscenities are contrary to various provisions
of the Health Act, but the council is charged
with administering that statute, and it is
too busy flag-flapping and spouting flap-
doodle to attend to its job.

“Y.Z.” : In my tram to-day was a newly-
returned Digger with an empty sleeve. Oppo-

inquired fearfully: ‘‘Bin to the war ?” “Oh,
yes,” replied the Digger casually— “I gave
a hand.”
ANOTHER MARINE STRIKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Yo-ho bard hitched up his pants and softly
stepped ashore ;
The Editor rushed up on deck and roared a deep-
sea roar:
“Come back on board, you purple swab! Come
back here, d —n your eyes!’’
The salt-sea bard retorted, “Sir, you fill me with
surprise!
I wish you wouldn’t use such words. I told you
yesterday
I’d sing no more unless I got some influenza pay!
“If sailormen won’t risk their lives unless they get
more coin,
Then I, the sailor-bard, refuse your inky craft to
join—•
Unless, of course, you pay me more to sing my
songs of cheer,
For well you know I have to breathe the tainted
atmosphere.”
“But, d —n your eyes!” the captain roared, “you
never go to sea! ’
“Your readers think I do!” replied the bard most
cunningly.
“Refuse my small request and I’ll expose the silly
trick.
I’ll tell them that I hate the sea and that it makes
me sick!
These wild, rough words we print I’ll show are
looted from old books,
And they will quickly see we’re just a pair of
common crooks.”
“Oh, stow that talk!” the captain groaned. “Let’s
have it out below!”
The deep-sea bard then skipped aboard prepared
for more Yo-ho.
Now as he sings of crested seas and clinking
capstan pawls,
His readers vision him afloat emitting curious calls.
The bo’sn’s pipe wails through his v.erse and
bursting sails fly free,
Till timid shore-folk say, “Great Scot! What lives
they lead at sea!”
But all the time lie writes ashore where bright
pubs line the way,
And drags from his dry editor his influenza pay.

“The Dentist”: Country curates doing-
much parochial visiting find everyone out
very often. One bright cleric conceived the
idea of having cards printed bearing his
name and church below the inscription:
“Sorry to find you out.” At one home, after
knocking several times, he prospected round
the side of the house. Here, on a window-
sill, drying in the sun, was a set of false
teeth. The temptation was too strong; he
slipped the usual card under the fangs and
left full of laughter. That’s why Mrs. Bug-
gins doesn’t go to church now.
* * * *
“Lahma”: The Armistice Night proceed-
ings at Cairo and Kantara have effectively
cleared out the illusion that Billjim and the
Maorilander are the bad boys of the family.
Several thousand Tommies took Cairo by
storm, and there was looting far and wide.
Many shrewd attempts were made to entice
the Aussies into joining the mob, but they
were not biting. Not content with stuffing bags
with spoil, the maffickers passed on to the
Anzac Hostel, making a wreck of that insti-
tution, though it has been almost entirely a
Tommy concern since the Australian infan-
try’s departure, and has provided them with
the only lodging within their means, to-
gether with the cheapest good-quality meals.
A descent was also made on the Australian
and Maorilander Soldiers’ Club, the one
small patch of Aussie left us, but a few
willing Diggers quickly settled that argu-
ment. The G.O.C. troops in Egypt has
issued a public proclamation thanking the
Australians and Maorilanders for their
strong support in limiting and quelling the
outbreak. Since certain still-not-to-be-men-
tioned proceedings at the Wazzir, in retalia-
tion for numerous murders and fatal doping,
the Australians have had mud thrown at
them on every possible occasion. Just as
frequently they have been told to take an

example from the disciplined Tommy. Now
those dabblers in pitch are floundering in
their own defilement.

There ought to be a Gum Tree Cross for
bush heroes. As an instance John Frederick
Baker lived 18 miles per bad mountain
road from Walsh’s Creek (Vic.), which is
nowhere, , and 38 miles from Warbnrton,
which is no 'place worth mentioning. He
shot himself in the arm, making an awful
wreck. He was in the unusual position of
being married to a woman 16 years older
than himself —that is to say, he .was 64 and
WASTED OPPORTUNITIES.
“Good Lord, what rotten weather!”
“Yes, I haven't a decent pair of stockings in my trunk.”
she was 80. They were both ignorant of
medical science, and there was no one near
them, not even a dog. So John Frederick
Baker tackled the mountain road, which was
dry and had bush-fires on each side, and
reached Walsh’s Crossing just alive. Then
good Samaritans bumped him 20 miles over
more dry, bad mountain road, and he was
still alive. Finally he was bumped 48 miles
to Melbourne, and he was alive even then.
The wife, aged 80. remained to keep things
afloat at home. They had gone on the land.
“H. Horsecollar”: When old claims to
territory were being revived in Paris, per-
haps it took some diplomacy to prevent
Canada throwing a stinkpot into the camp
by raising the question of a strip
of its natural west coast which
the United States holds. The
Russians sold Alaska to the
States with all the goodwill,
claims, traditions, legends,
ancient lights, tithes, encum-
brances, reigning tools and coat
of arms, also the maps and
greasy documents. These were
so vast that they even included
the deeds of an old Russian
settlement in California. Among
them the United States disin-
terred a sort of right to a nar-
row strip which hangs down like
a tail and cuts off the Canadian
province of Yukon and half the
province of British Columbia
from the Pacific. It is only a
moderately profitable sort of
place by itself, it being only a
hop, skip and jump across from
high-water mark. The Alaskan
capital is on it, certainly, but a
capital with 1300 population
isnY much of a place. Alaska
passed to the United States in
1867, but the shadowy claim to
the tail which blocks the outlook
British Columbia hung fire,
as tails will do, for many years.
In 1888 it was proposed in Con-
gress to cut the matter short by
annexing all Canada. Ulti-
mately Britain gave way for fear
of strife, as it did in practically
all its disputes with the petted
child across the Atlantic.
"Peter”: The cynical casualness of some
electors in their attitude to inoculation calls
for vehement language. One Health-officer,
who cheerfully punctures his victims as a
public duty at the Town Hall, stren-
uously refuses to use the needle in his pri-
vate practice. His position is not so ques-
tionable as that of another who has no pro-
fessional enthusiasm for the serum, but has
sold a thousand guineas’ worth of it since
the ’flu began. This doctor stifles his con-
science with the remark that, anyhow, inocu-
lation can do no harm, and, in many cases,
is a valuable stimulant to a faltering spirit.
There are others who decline to improve
their pockets at the expense of their con-
victions, but their hostility is not due to a
disbelief in inoculation per se —rather to a
doubt regarding the merits of the vaccine in
use. Curious readers of the London Lancet
may have noted the marked efficacy of the
vaccine treatment mentioned in that journal
compared with the results achieved in Aus-
tralia. Where the Lancet reports practi-
cal immunity in cases specially reserved for
experiment, we can only guarantee to the
inoculated a certain lessening in the dis-
ease’s onset, with an increased resistance to
complications. On that evidence I. register
a query as to whether we have the recipe
which won the approval of the Lancet and
of established medical opinion in England
and America. The matter ought to be worth
an inquiry.
* * *
A Sydney doctor declined last week to
wear an influenza-mask. He declined bail
and he declined to be remanded. He de-
clined to question the sergeant who charged
him. He practically declined to do anything
but go to gaol, and he drove himself in
his car to Long Bay Penetentiary -and was
accommodated with a cell. He then declined
to remain, and he is now home again, await-
ing the Law’s next move. There is, alas!
no better business in a democracy than to
put up a fight against constituted authority.
“Gleniris” : Flumonia has made an entrance
into some Victorian bush places which the
city person imagines as pure and germless,
sweet with gummy breezes and the perfume
of cows in bloom. John Henry Backbone
collects the germs at the township pub and
goes home to his family circle, where he
spends the evening beside the kerosene-lamp,
with all the windows shut, reading the
weekly cow-journals, while Annie and Willie
do their sums at his elbow. The dweller in
the big spaces mostly loves to seek a her-
metically-sealed living-room while he isn’t
working outside. The change of seasons
make no difference to him. The closed win-
dow in summer-time keeps the dratted moths
away from the lamp and discourages the
mosquito, while in the winter the after-tea
family gathering around the old eating-table,
amid the homely, lingering smell of bubble-
’n’-squeak and corned beef, makes for general
warmth and comfort. The figures for
phthisis show that John Henry’s daughter.
Alice Sit-by-the-Fire, gets her full share of
that complaint; and the flumonia germ loves
a stuffy parlor just as much as the bacillus
of the slower disease.

“Bill Bowyang” : Sniping was great sport,
but we couldn’t show Abdul any points at
the game. Certainly he had the pick of all
the best positions, and we were forced to
erect affairs with earthworks and sandbags.
Abdul had a strong post to the right of
Lone Pine and near the Olive Grove, where
“Beachy Bill” was. The possie held about
a dozen marksmen. Three other men and I,
who had put up good averages at Cairo,
proceeded towards Shrapnel Gully, where we
fixed up a posffie Which gave us a view of
the snipers’ trench. Every time Abdul fired
at our men in Monash Gully he exposed
himself to us and we dropped a few. Abdul
could not understand where the bullets were
coming from, and he did not return our fire.
But one morning we noticed that he had
been working overtime, and had erected a
wall of white sandbags. This puzzled us,
but we continued to pour a warm fire
through the enemy’s loopholes. Early the
following morning, after sending a few bul-
lets .over by way of greeting, we left our
roost and climbed downhill to eat our break-
fast. We were just on the point of return-
ing when three shells fired in quick succes-
sion scattered our sandbags and rifles over
the hills and gullies of Gallipoli. Then we
tumbled to the purpose of those white sand-
bags.
“Xela”: The joke of Germany last year
was the reward of £lOOO offered by the
Commonwealth Government for information
leading to the conviction of the person or
persons connected with the “internal ex-
plosion” on board the Cumberland, mined
a raider off Gabo. In February Hun
newspapers were flooded with laborious
jokes concerning the Australians and their
official ways. Extracts from Sydney news-
papers obtained aboard captured vessels were
published, and I have a Hun reproduction
of portion of Sydney D.T. announcing the
Government offer, which was regarded as
the richest inke of all.
* * * *
“D.F.”: No Australian historian of later
date than David Collins seems even to men-
tion one of the most remarkable visitors to
early Sydney, Don Alexandra Malaspina,
gentleman of Spain, who put into Port Jack-
son in 1793, in the course. of a five years’
voyage of exploration. Incidentally he gave
the officers at Sydney the first feed of fresh
beef they had had since they landed, by kill-
ing a beast brought from California, and in-
viting them to dinner. Collins speaks in the
highest terms of the Spaniards (one of whom
was named Murphy), and an incident which
occurred a few months later showed that
the Spaniards appreciated the courtesies ex-
tended to them. Off the Falklands Mala-
spina gave water and supplies to a British
ship bound for Sydney, and refused to take
any payment, saying that he considered it
some small return for the kindness shown to
him at Sydney. In the course of his voyage
.Malaspina surveyed the western coast of
America from the Horn to British Columbia,
did a lot of discovery and survey work in
the Western Pacific, and visited Maoriland.
Apart from the brief references in Collins
no English writer seems to have mentioned
his voyage till Robert McNab had that part
relating to Maoriland translated for his
“Muri Iluku.”
BAREFACED.
MAUDE: “One feels so safe down by the
surf in times like these."
KATE: “Yes, especially When one's husband
is in Melbourne."
“One One O”: The A.I.F. has won the
reputation of being the finest corps of
“shock” troops on the Western Front, and
as such has had some of the roughest jobs
going. Probably the Diggers have been in
the front line more than any other corps
in the British Army. Yet now, when our
job is done —now, when we might at least
be sent somewhere handy to decent living
conditions —we are. kept out in the shell-
shattered parts of France and Belgium. Not
yet do we know the delights of a bath, or
change of clothing, or of a sound roof, or
enough blankets to keep us warm at night,
or a decently-stocked canteen. It’s a bit
over the odds.
HOME AGAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Australia’s good enough for me,” he said,
And raised his old felt hat, and scratched his head.
“Imshi, dark eyes that o’er the yasmak glow!
Begone, sweet dreams of chic French maids I know;
“Of Blighty girls, with dear grey eyes that beam,
With warm, red lips, and cheeks of rose and cream ;
Of sweet colleens—let others win the prize
Of Irish wit and Brigid’s sparkling eyes.
“And, bonnie lassie in the tartan skirt,
So full of fun, to me ye’ll gi’e nae hurt;
For my delight is brown surf maids,” he said,
And raised his old felt hat, and scratched his 'head.

Robertson, of Melbourne, who looked on the

Denison Miller’s engagement as Governor
of the Commonwealth Bank has been re-
newed. But not on exactly the same terms
—his absolute control is likely to be modi-
fied by an amending Act. Nobody imagined
when * the bank was born that the Governor
would be the autocrat of tens of millions
within seven years ; but those millions and
the possibilities of the Commonwealth Bank
absorbing one or two private banks are
regarded as very good reasons why there
should be more than one head in the concern.
Half the time now the Hun authorities
forget to speak of the “republic” and call it
the “empire.” And
when they do remem-
ber to keep up the pre-
tence nothing is said
about the group of
“republics” that was
talked of a while ago —-
it is just one “repub-
lic.” Prince Max of
Baden, Kaiser Wil-
liam’s figurehead Chan-
ce 11 or, a flighty
nonentity who once in-
ha bit e d a lunatic
asylum, is mentioned
as first President. The
Kaiser has, however,
asked permission to
return in humble guise
to Germany. The last
Napoleon made two
irruptions into France
as a professed em-
peror. Then after a
revolution he returned
as a private citizen.

Presently h e was

public. Suddenly he
was emperor. The

afterwards proposes to open a small grocery

Vic. State Hansard ate a mere seven
tons of paper last year as compared with
14 tons in 1916. Tlie saving was made by
reducing the number of copies printed. Some
members shrieked that there would be a pub-
lic yell of protest in consequence of the
reduction of the issue, but
although there were 30,000 less
printed in 1918 than in ’l7 the
yells weren’t audible.
N. S. Wales wheat cookies
didn’t burst any kerosene-tins
when the news came through
that the Wheat Pool was to be
continued for a couple of years
under the present system. As a
business proposition the pool-
especially the N.S.W. part of
it —has been a calamity. lor
the first two years the handling
showed criminal negligence.
Last season one Drummond
took charge, and there was an
improvement in that end of the
business; hut there was no vis-
ible attempt to introduce
economy. If anything, inspec-
tors and yard bosses grew more
numerous. Cocky has several
alleged representatives in Par-
liament who might ask nasty
questions about the cost to the

According to seven months’
returns, N. S. Wales revenue
for the vear should be
£2,900,000 more than last
year’s. All the same, the Ma
State is to borrow a lot more
than it did last year. Even if
the revenue increases by
£192,900,000 it is against the
profligate Government’s religion
to pay for a mile or two of new
railway without handing down
the bill to posterity. And it will
always be thus till a of,
Bay, £3.000,000 a year for works and loan

taking precedence of members’ salaries.

The N. S. Wales Government has decided
that it can stop ships, regardless of Federal
regulations, on suspicion of having too many
imported germs on board. _ Perhaps when
it is in this truculent mood it will begin to
stop ships, regardless of the Federal tariff,
on suspicion of having too much imported
chiffon on board.
Vic. Treasurer McPherson, who is trying
hard to knock common decency into
“charity” officialdom, has come across in-
stances of nurses working up to 60 hours

THE HORRORS OF PEACE.
SYMPATHETIC FEMALE: “Who ore these
cripples? More pitiful wrecks from the
horrors of war?”
INFORMATIVE MALE : “Madam, no! They

ference.”
the slaughterman would say if those were
his conditions. This paper doesn’t know;
what it does know is that such conditions
drive the man and the woman in the small
industry to the conclusion that perhaps,
after all, the One Big Union is the thing.
Hawkins may do some good for himself and
his family by keeping the next-door Sawkms
children out of his yard when, through the
neglect of the Sawkins parents, the Sawkins
youngsters have got some disease or other.
Rut if Hawkins leaves it at that he is a fool.
What he needs to do is to Jiave some control
over the sanitation of the Sawkins premises.
And that is precisely the position of N. S.
Wales and every other State with regard to
Commonwealth Health matters. The power
of any State to establish quarantine and hold
its neighbors off is only the second-best thing.
The best thing is to have as much control
over the neighbor’s Health administration as
he has himself.
During the last two financial years
Westralia’s expenditure has exceeded revenue
by nearly £1,500,000, and things for 1918-19
look worse. The deficit for January was
£136,142. and the accumulated deficit is now
£3.308,938. Increased taxation will be hard
to bear, especially in the cockying industry,
and there is absolutely nothing for it but
the hardest economy.
The Speck’s “Loyalty League,” which re-
cently circularised the members of Parlia-
ment to point out that five of the six Tas.
Senators were It.C.’s, an “altogether dispro-
portionate” and possibly dangerous number,
apparently overlooked the fact that of 30
members in the State Assembly only four—
Lyons, Sheridan, Mulcahy and M. O’Keefe
—are professed ILC.’s, and that the Leg.
Council of IS members contains only one,
Laborite McDonald. And it is the State
Parliament which controls education—the
item which is supposed to be in peril from
“Catholic machinations.”
Inverell is in N. S. Wales, only 124 miles
from the coast, nearly 2000 ft. above sea-
level, and is supposed to wallow in 30in.
of rainfall. Yet it is from Inverell that
a suggestion comes that the State Govern-
ment should borrow £10,000,000 and make
loans to distressed farmers up to 50 per
cent, of the value of their property. The
trouble is that so many of them owe 60
per cent, already, to say nothing of 15 per-
cent. to the storekeeper, and when a man
gets to owe 125 per cent, of the value of
his property he leaves by the night train
unless he is a worse fool than he looks.
According to an ancient custom, State
Governor Stanley has been granted by the
Vic. Government six months’ leave ot ab-
sence on full pay, and will not return to Ins
pashalic. Victoria thus makes A. Lyulph
Stanley a present of £2500. How much
longer will this gubernatorial farce be acted
by the six States?
France is spending £18,000,000 in haste to
reconstruct its beet-sugar factories, one ot
the reasons being that big, empty Australia is
crying out to that crowded country for the
simple vegetable that tea is sweetened with.
In 1012-Id Australia paid £1,150,140 for im-
ported sugar; in 1013 14, £810,446; in
1915-16, £1,847,310; in 1010-17, £1,617,299.
In the missing year it supplied itselt tor
once, Its solitary beet factory plods along
and gets very little forrarder. Ihere is a
great market here, but Australia has a horioi
of all vegetables that weren’t grown in Eng-
land when its ancestors left with the hirst
Fleet, and regards them as “outlandish or
“new-fangled.” It almost thinks them un-
Christian.
Australia has made what is said to be its
first sewing-machine (sewing-machines come
in free, of course, under the tariff). Hitherto
machines have been “made,” in the sense
that a lot of imported parts a*-d some locally-
made parts were put together here, but a
Melbourne firm has now produced the whole
thing. Even then it isn’t all Australian
wcrk, for imported appliances (which also
come in free under the ass of a tariff) were
used to make many of the parts. So there is
still a long way to go. Austral*a spends the
wages of 1060 repatriated soldiers on im-
ported sewing machines and it has made
one of them. The mountain has been con-
fined and has given birth to a germ.
The position in Britain, where railways
and tramways and ships are_ stopping and
towns are going into darkness, is the position
which the One Big Union proposes to bring
about here. Elected union officials aren t
consulted about strikes and don’t know when
strikes are going to happen. They have been
superseded by parties partly known and
partly obscure. How these parties got into
authority is uncertain. Probably some of
them hardly know themselves; certainly
many of the unionists don’t know. The
unions still exist—just as an army does
when it lays down its arms and goes rabbit-
ing or bird’s-nesting for a week. If the
sane unionist wants to prevent similar hap-
penings in Australia there is only one thing
for him to to —take an interest in his union,
choose his officers wisely and follow them
and nobody else.
The French Labor Mission was closely
questioned at the Hobart Trades Council’s
meeting as to whether the French unions
were syndicalist in aim or merely desirous
. of securing advantages by ordinary indus-
trial methods and political action. Thom-
sen replied that the nearest approach to
syndicalism methods in France was found
in some factories where a committee
of union workmen was given more or less
control, and was charged with more or less
responsibility for the proper working of
certain departments. There was also some
profit-sharing —nothing more. But the
chances are that the mission’s testimony is
of little practical value, for the reason that
unionism in France, as in other belligerent
countries, is so shell-shocked by four years
of war that no man can fairly assess its
strength or its weakness or its aims or in-
tentions or anything that is its.
In their resistance

respects in which he points out that Federation has
failed, and argues, therefore, that the Australian
States should undo theii federation.” —Sydney Daily

Let us go back ! The time is ripe, we know,
To run away and let our best hopes go,
Making a quick surrender to the foe.
We knew that there were things we needs must face
Before the Federation held its place.
They’re here. Now let us funk them, in disgrace.
A perfect system has not yet been made ;
Therefore, the time has come to feel afraid
And play the paltry game that once was played.
Only sheer cowardice can save us now.
Run, run, Australia, with perspiring brow!
Duck into ancient sloth and save the row!
The foe is no mere German or wild Turk,
Eager to slay us through the battle’s murk —
The awful tiling is solid, earnest work!
What can the future hold but strife and shame?
Get into cover 1 Do not heed the blame!
It needs men —stalwart men —to play the game !
Could we be men enough ? Nay, God forbid!
Of all such wild ideas get safely rid !
Great Pride of Funk, shut down the future’s lid!
Admit it fairly. We are lost and dor.e
Before the real battle is begun.
Throw up your hands, cry “Kamerad” and run!

“Gouger”: Would some sheep-king inform
me if this is a lie? A member of the Blofces’
Union told me that in the snow country, ’way down
south, even should a heavy fall of snow cover
the sheep to six feet in depth, the animals’ hot
breath makes little spiral holes up through the
blanket, thus giving them air. Even if they are
covened over for weeks, the warmth melts the
snow around them, and they feed in an ever in-
creasing circle, until they work their way out.
Sounds feasible, but the brew up in these Far
Northern parts would make anything sound feasible.
Apropos of nothing, the gins around these parts
decline to wear a red dress during a thunderstorm.
“Fire come burn ’em up,” they say; which means
that the lightning, thinking the gins were copying
its own dress, would knock spots off ’em. So
during a storm the female blacks go unclad. Not
that it matters.
EX-DIGGER COBBER . FEARING A
VISIT FROM MA-IN-LAW, PROCEEDS
TO CAMOUFLAGE THE OLD HOME.
“Mookingak” : The dust storm in the Nor’-
W'cet (N.S.W.) passeth all understanding. In three
weeks ten blew over Tibooburra, each one in com-
petition to excel the previous one in velocity and
viciousness. The last smashed all records. It
arrived from the South after tea, and for weary
hours blotted out all things, whilst it gathered
up tins and rubbish and pelted them indiscrimi-
nately, yelling its defiance, shrieking its laughter at
woman vainly trying to keep a clean house,
frightening children clinging to their mothers’
skirts, and all the time the sickening darkness
blotted out everything, leaving men wondering was
this Hell they’d struck. The heat, the darkness,
the noise were all there, and if Hell’s got any-
thing worse I don’t want it, thank you.
“T. Tree” : A. D. Hardy, president of the
\ ic. Field Naturalists’ Club and a tree enthusiast,
scoffs at all the yarns about 480 and 500 foot eucalyp-
tus herbs. When the trustees of the 1888 Melbourne
Exhibition offered £2O to anyone who could produce
a 4OO feet high, with £3 for every 5 feet above
400 ft., and James Munro promised to throw in
an extra £lOO, the tallest found was a 326 ft.
lin. specimen in the Baw Baws. Two others over
300 feet were measured, one at Fernshaw and one
at Narbethong. All three belonged to the mountain-
ash ( Euc. amygdalina regnans) variety. On the
evidence of G. Cornthwaite, a surveyor, a much
taller mountain-ash was cut down at Narracan, in
Gippsland, in 1880. He ran the tape over it and
made it 375 ft. ; a length of 240 ft. was split for
palings, slabs and so on, and gave amongst other
things enough stuff to build a six-roomed house.
In spite of its length this tree was only about Oft.
in diameter where it was spring-boarded by the
fallers, 12ft. from the ground. From another tree
at Narracan palings worth £lOO at the stump were
split. The greatest girth recorded for a Victorian
eucalypt is 112 ft. at the ground or 80ft. 10ft. up;
this was a mountain-ash at Marysville. Judging by
what fires have left of them there were once bigger
stems in the Otway Forest.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: A word of warning before
anyone takes “Cowbailer’s” advice (B. 2/l/"19)
re planting weeping willows on creeks for cow
fodder in drought. This vegetable’s roots will com-
pletely block up a creek in a few years.
Darlots Creek—large enough for a cattle boundary
—in West Vic. was sown with willows, and 20
years ago the Government had to take the contract
in hand and clear miles of waterway to let off flood
waters. Every willow-twig that sticks in the mud
grows, and in time blocks the channel. I admit the
trees’ usefulness and beauty, but plant them back
from the bank.
* * * *
“Lin”: An old, leaky iron tank that no
plumber will attempt to make water-tight can be
turned to service by the use of ordinary cement,
sand and a trowel. Two parts of sand should be
used to one of cement. If there are any very
large holes, bolt a piece of iron or tin over them
and apply the cement on top. Don’t be in a hurry
over the job, as the iron is not absorbent. Con-
sidering that the prices of tanks have trebled in
the last few years this is a good tip.
* * * *
“John Quill”: Another addition is being
made to the cockies’ aggregate of troubles in the
shape of the so-called wild tobacco plant. It grew
abundantly along the banks of the Macquarie
(N.S.W.) 20 years ago, but seemed to confine its
abode to the river flats. Of later years, however,
the pest has begun to spread at an alarming rate.
In some localities the hills on either side of the
river are covered with it. At its fullest
growth the plant attains a height of 10 or 12 feet;
there are few branches, and the leaves are attached
directly to the trunk by short stems. It has deep,
bell-shaped, yellow flowers, at the base of which are
secreted hundreds of tiny, black, round seeds. The
plant is quite useless and, of course, is not
indigenous.
“Gouger”: An old batter who camps up
on my mountain, has not bought baking-soda or
cream of tartar for 40
years. He digs a herb from
the scrub, calls it sarsa-
parilla plant, boils the
leaves, bottles the decoc-
tion for three weeks, then
mixes it with the damper
he is moulding. The ex-
tract does its work all
right; and when allowed
to ferment for a month it
makes a strong enough
brew for the hatter to have
a mild jag. A potato,
some sugar, syrup and a
cup of methylated spirit
when boiled in a bucket-
ful of the stuff, corked up
for a month, and taken on
your birthday will make
you acquainted with some
rare and wonderful fan-
tods. I interfered with
this brew once only. When
I came out of hospital I
did not camp with the hatter any more.
“Tim Buctoo”: “Hay’s” surmise (B.
26/12/18) that the unusual footprints seen by
“Myall” at St. George (Q.) were faked by Binghi
is probably correct. I have seen the same trick
played by Binghi in W.A. Saw an abo. at Leonora
make a perfect imitation of a child’s track by press-
ing the outside of his clenched fists in the dust, and
adding the toes with his bunched-up fingers and
thumb. He made two sets of tracks and puzzled
me by asking which were blackfellow and which
were white. He explained that blacks’ toes were
wide apart (“nothing wearem boot”), while “white
pfeller squeezem alonga boot.”
* * * *
V -B. : I saw in cold print again the
other day the old yarn that if you coiled a rope
aiound your blankets when you are camping out
a snake will never cross it. Well, I was
repairing # fence on the Bogan, between Bourke
and Brewarrina (N.S.W.), and when I had made
my doss I carefully placed an inch Manila rope
round it, as snakes absolutely swarmed there.
Awakening at sunrise I found a six-foot brown
specimen gazing placidly at me from the blankets.
I never left bed so quick in my life. After that
I slept in the cart. N.B.—lt was a real snake.
SOCIAL ITEM.
MISS MURIEL MALTRAVERS (to Mr. Rupert Ravenswoos) : “I will.”
“McNorth”: Some day something useful
may be done with the Torres Straits islanders as
wood-carvers. On Yam, Saibai, Boigu and other
specks that dot the sea between Oape York and
the Papuan coast there are niggers who could
give their trained white points at the
art. In most of the native churches the lecterns,
baptismal fonts and pulpit fronts are pieces of
carving of delicate and intricate design, all done
by black-skinned faithful. One ugly old savage
with a hanging lip that would trip a bullock and
a nose as wide as his mouth showed me a massive
anangement that he had made to be carried in
some ceremony or other. It was about seven feet
long and three broad, and it was carved in a
bewildering design of snakes and trees and canoes.
Only Heaven or the other place knows what it
was intended to represent, but it was one of the
finest samples of work of its kind I have ever
seen. And it was done with no other tools than
a tomahawk and a pocket-knife.
* * * *
“Helersy”: About ten years ago there
were twin girls born to Maggie Johnston, a gin,
on the Mission Station at Lake Tyers, Gippsland,
(Vic.). The mother's chief consideration when
she discovered the strange phenomenon was how
she could manage to feed two picaninnies instead
of one. This difficulty was overcome to a gjreat.
extent by the missioner and his wife, who supplied
them regularly twice a day with barley-water and
milk. Under this treatment they both survived
the first twelve months, and then one, Euphemia,
died. The other, Alison, lived on, and as far as
is known is still living, although she was always
of a delicate constitution. Mr. Bulmer, who had
been on the Mission Station for about forty years,
said that twins were of a very rare occurrence
among the blacks, and that probably had these
two been left solely to their mother’s care, they
would have died within a few months.
“Rosie Sunset”: Pelicans are dying in
dozens on Lake Thule, on the Vic. side of the N. S.
Wales border. . These seemingly useless, ungainly
fish-scoops of inland waters have come in flocks
from up north, driven thence, probably, by the dry
spell. After a short sojourn it was noticed that
the travellers were becoming droopy. Then they
began to die and taint the atmosphere around the
lake side. Hunger is not the cause, because the
lake, which is about seven miles long, abounds with
fish. Perhaps a diet of cat-fish is responsible; or
perhaps they just want to “hum” like the Pearce
picnic.
* * Mr
“Kidnapper”: Has anybody ever heard of
a kangaroo with twin joeys? My mate the other day
shot a doe and when we went to skin her we found
she had two babies in the pouch, both the same size.
I have shot hundreds of ’roos and my mate has shot
thousands, but this was new on us.
“Belair” ; The finned “snake” is no myth.
Last week I bought one of him at a bird-dealer’s
shop in Sydney for 2s. Dealer didn’t have his pedi-
gree, but guaranteed him thoroughly domesticated,
broken to single and double harness, child could
drive him, make nice pet for young school,
etc. I’ve assured all my relatives that he’s perfectly
harmless, in order to find out if he is. Will send
coroner’s report (if any) later. He (the snake,
not the coroner) is a handsome little fellow about
18in. long, reddish brown, no spots. Has a nicely-
tapered figure and two distinct fins on the ’midship
section. Normally they are pressed so close against
the sides as to be unnoticeable. W’hen he is in a
hurry he appears to use these fins as an aid in
turning. Haven’t tried him in the water yet.
He eats ants, flies and wood-lice. Am training
him to catch bugs, so he’ll be handy when I visit
the boarding-house in Sydney again.
ON AND OFF.
"Did you put on any weight during your
shooting trip?”
“Oh, just temporarily—I dropped hack as
soon as the doctor removed the shot!”
“Devil-fish”: Near Cape Pillar (Tas.)
there is a cliff which rises in one solid, smooth face
from the sea for 1140 feet perpendicular. It is
claimed that this is the highest sheer cliff, without
ledge or break of any kind, in the Commonwealth.
Know a higher?
(Continued on page 24.)
THE UNCOMPLETED TRIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My train was hurtling through the scrub. I leaned
upon the door.
A great hill in the distance swung, and, in the waste
before,
A solitary little man was grubbing at a stump.
He’d cleared an acre for a farm around his humpy
... .thump !
The door had swung right open. I was out upon
my back.
A million stars were twinkling in a universe of
black.
I had two broken ribs, a damaged head, and back,
and shin,
And a nauseating sense of being down and trodden
in.
The little man came with his axe, and stood beside
my head.
With dull regard he looked on me before a word he
said.
“I s’pose,” he ventured then, “you meant to go on
further, mate ?
You write to them there railway blokes. They’ll
give you a rebate! ”

DON’T DRUG YOUR NERVES.
IP THEY ARE WEAK TAKE PHOS-
PHATE WITH YOUR MEALS.
Some drugs lessen the sensitiveness of the
nervous system so that the brain acts
slowly, the nerves do not respond readily
to the directions of the brain, and every
function of the body is retarded. Others
act as a lash to the nerves, so that the user
is fared temporarily with feverish energy.
Loth are equally dangerous, for there is
the inevitable reaction which leaves the
sufferer far worse than before. Therefore,
ton t drug your nerves ! Get to understand
them and study their needs. Nerves give
way because they are weak, and they be-
come weak through lack of food and nourish-
ment. _ The futility of thrashing a starved
horse is obvious, and it is just as futile
and just as foolish to lash weak, exhausted
nerves by the administration of violent
drugs. Nerves feed on phosphate, which
r 'YJ: X £ ract from di gested food, and the
tact that your nerves are weak proves they
ie not obtaining sufficient phosphates for
ieir needs. You can remedy this serious
tault by providing your nerves with phos-
phate which most chemists stock in the
toim of 5-grain compressed tablets. Take
one of these small tablets immediately after
every meal and you will soon note a decided
improvement in your health. Your nerves
will become steady and strong, your brain
will act quickly and clearly; your appetite
will improve; you will sleep better, and
wake up bright and refreshed, charged with
an abundance of vital energy sufficient to
—Advt° U through tlie most strenuous day.
Terx*i Tory”: The record for the long-
distance buffalo wander from the breeding grounds in
the Northern Territory belongs to a bull which turned
up in 1882 on Fanning River station and frightened
pepper out of Joe Peggler, head stockman, and his
men, none of whom had ever seen such a beast. Fan-
ning lviver station is 22 miles from Ravenswood
Junction, on the Townsville-Charters Towers rail-
\va.y line, and about 60 miles from Townsville.
When first sighted the stranger was ringing a mob
of station cattle, apparently trying to negotiate an
alliance, which the herd resented. However, when
Peggler and party got their hats jambed down on
their heads again and had a closer inspection, the
bull turned on them and they drew their next
breath at the homestead, eight miles away. The
combined forces of Fanning and Burdekin Downs
stations eventually bagged the buffalo, and the last
1 saw of him was his hide and horns hanging in
the Charters Towers School of Arts. As to buffalo
flesh, provided it is that of a fairly young beast,
I question whether you could tell corned buffalo
from corned bullock by the palate.

“O’Phimerty”: “Mrs. Lance Lawson’s”
assertion that waratsh seeds need a fire over them
to make them sprout seems borne out by the fact
that on Mt. Wellington (Tas.) for years past the
shrub has been conspicuously absent from its old
haunts. This year, however, following on bush
fires that swept the mountain, there is a fine show
of blossom and young growth.
“Wangi” : On the island in Torres Strait
on which I am Robinson Crusoeing are sometimes
found human skulls covered with a large clam-shell.
These skulls are in a good state of preservation,
tha teeth in upper and lower jaws being intact. A
red band, about U inches broad, is painted across
the skull from temple to temple. The oldest inhabi-
tant informs me that, in pre-missionary days, when
one island made war on another, it was customary
to bring home as many of the heads of the enemy as
possible, but I have been unable to get information
s to whether any significance attaches to the paint-
ing on the skulls. Perhaps some other savage knows.
Pick : A recent Abo., arguing about the
utility of the boomerang in the hands of Binghi
hunters, advanced his opinion that the half-moon
weapon was little, if at all, used in providing for
the tribes commissariat. All I can say is that
the present-day blacks at the Brungle (N.S.W.)
mission station make good use of it in securing
" V < a f kS \ Across the Murrumbidgee, just below
a favorite duck haunt, they have a maze of wires
stretched from tree to tree. Some of the hunters
station themselves among the bushes, while others
a-down stream stir up the birds. As the flights sail
by, the ambushed darkies whirl aloft their boomer-
angs, and the birds hurriedly swooping therefrom are
ten killed by striking the entanglements. Yes I
know that the old-time blackfellow had no wire’to
go on with, but the jungles provided a good sub-
stitute in monkey- and lawyer-vines.
Hay : I must put in a word for the
quandong. There were times Outback when the
fr, n Ja ™ "t ever saw was that made with this
uit. We also ate the berries in pies and dried
them as a reserve for seasons when the fresh fruit
wasn t available. Binghi ate quandong as a dessert
after h,s meal of roast wallaby, and cracked the
nuts for their kernels. The nuts used to be strung
into necklaces for the girls, and the old-time bush-
men had an elaborately carved stone to slip the
hbnLlf * ? CCke r hief throu^h wllen he didn’t do
purpose P! ° Ud Wlth a mutton shank-bone for that
TC \ the qliestion of “Jaymac”
( • / / 19), who asks what use quandong is as
ucter, I reply from long experience. There are
W,o Vanet r, ° f the fruit; red and y ellow ’ latter
being much larger and more fleshy than the former
Both varieties, however, are a valuable fruit food,
• 6 ,f Teat f r because the quandong generously grows
in e driest of Outback districts, where other
iruits are practically unknown. When ripe the
quandong is certainly neither bitter nor unappetis-
ing. It provides tasty pies, and is much used in
jam making. Quantities are also dried in the sun.
In this form the fruit keeps for a long time, and
when prepared in a similar manner to other dried
ruits is usually well appreciated. It i s difficult
to hnd good quandong patches in N. S. Wales A
few of the best are 20 to 50 miles from Ivanhoe', on
the track to Willcarmia.
■‘Agricola”: Australian birds are as
adaptable as Billjim himself. On the far South
Coast (N.S.W.) the season has been very dry and
swallows have found it difficult to procure the
law material for their mansions. They managed
all light for their first broods, as there had been
enough ram to leave water in holes; but those that
ound it necessary to build again for the second
brood were up against a shortage of material. Were
they downhearted? No! They are using fresh cow-
dung, which is never more than a chain away on the
Cow Coast. The scraps of vegetable matter in the
material cause it to set so well that the builders
have dispensed with the usual horsehair and pieces
of grass; and I hereby certify that the cottage I
have just inspected is better built, neater, stronger
and more durable than any mud nest I have ever
seen.
SETTLING THE MATTER.
MRS. BILL: “Bill, didjer put the cat out?”
BILL: “ Yup.”
MRS. BILL : “Are per sure?”
BILL: “Well, ' fyer think I didn't, putter out yerself.”
NON-EXPLOSIVE SHELLS.
THE KANOW-IT-ALL. NEIGHBOR: “Giving suails to the fowls, eh! They say snails kill fowls
in the tong run.”
THE KID : “Oh, our snails aren't so savage as that."
“Poison”: While agreeing with “Werri-
mee (B. 16/l/’l&) that phosphorus baits do not
get rid of rabbits completely, they’re the only
satisfactory method of dealing with the pest on
un-netted country. There is no danger if dis-
solved with carbon. “Werrirnee” is orating through
his collar when he states that fish are poisoned by
phosphorus baits. Any practical person knows that
the first few points of rain will melt the pollard,
and that fish, even if the poison ever reached a
river, would have a busy time collecting the tiny
atoms m the dirty water. I’ll guarantee that
Werrirnee” has never found a fish so poisoned;
also he is only repeating an old parrot-cry when
he talks about birds being iioisoned. I’ve been
using pollard and phosphorus for over 20 years in
Victoria and New South, and have never seen a
bild killed with the baits, and have never met
anyone who has.

“U.P.” : Arthur Hamp was travelling the
other day from Bon Bon station to Port Augusta
(S.A.) when he met the Vermin Inspector, who
requested him to take possession of his bank pass-
book, together with a cheque for £93 and a roll
containing banknotes to the value of £3O, and pay
the lot into the local Savings Bank to his (the in-
spector’s) account. Hamp was driving two mules. At
one of the stopping places he took the mules out.
On commencing to harness them up again he noticed
a banknote between the teeth of one of the animals. He
was then pleased to find that the beast had breakfasted
on the cheque, the banknotes and the bank-book.
The cover of the book was all that remained of the
parcel handed over by the Vermin Inspector. If a
mule can get outside banknotes as dirty as I’m
accustomed to see them, it’s proof to me that he’s
just the hard doer we want for our back country.

“Agricola” : A dragon-fly, o r, as the kids
will have it, “an ’orse-stinger,” is a harmless inven-
tion, both as regards men and horses. It catches
its food, consisting of flying insects, while on the
wing Any old butterfly, moth, etc., will do, but
for Sunday dinner it prefers bees. When a bee
going honey-hunting, chances a short cut across a
waterhole, the dragon deals out punishment. Ilis
pace is something bewildering, and he aeroplanes
round in wide circles. The bee loses its head and
tries to escape by flying in a smaller circle. The
fl.v narrows his revolutions, and increases his pace
until he becomes almost invisible. Then l,e sud-
den!y halves the circle, and gathers the bee in.
After a lapse of five minutes he wipes the moisture
from his brow, removes some stray crumbs of bee
from his cravat and resumes his patrol.

“Jack S.”: Saw a beautiful grass-green
snake on a palm in Northern Egypt putting a series
ot hammerlocks on a large chameleon. The cha-
meleon is not a soft, delicate creature, yet the press-
ure had forced the blood out of his eye bases,
the story of the chameleon that burst after roost-
ing on the Scotch tartan is doubtful. I placed
one on a reduction of a cubist color effort, and he
merely turned green with envy. Next time I'll
place him on the bagpipes, and that will be the
end of him.

estralia’s Protector of Binghis reports
that approximately there are 25,767 abos. in his
dominions, of whom, say, 10,000 are wild. Apart
rom these latter the increase in population last
year was 1200. But the compilation is more or
less unsatisfactory.
‘‘Sarto'-: I have discovered the patriotic
spider. He is about a quarter of an inch long, and
the colors he displays give him the appearance of
a miniature peace celebration. The cephalo-thorax
and legs are black, and the abdomen (which is
cylindrical in shape, half as wide as it is long
and about half the length of the insect) is khaki,
with red and blue markings. The colors were easily
discernible with the unaided eye, but when I put
im under the glass I got a surprise. The red
marking on each side was in two separate stripes
that turned at right angles at either end, and
then went up over the top, but didn’t meet the
other as if a red oblong had been cut in two.
A square red spot was in the centre of this
i i U, ] < ed ? blong ’ and all the red was surrounded by
knaki. At the extreme end was a blue strip. The
white antenna; complete the colors. I wonder if
the thing was done up for the occasion?
Azac : The snipe family is very
conveniently divided into two distinct tribes —the
painted snipe (which is truly an Australian bird
and is content to remain here all its life) and the
Gallinago Australis (the Australian snipe), which
“ a f° nfir r d traveller. Every year about the
beginning of April it leaves for China, Japan and
even Siberia. It arrives in these countries in
t ™ e . *° " est ’ and when the young have been
hatched out and are able to fly they coax dad
and mother to take them to Aussie. The family
generally lobs back during September and October,
but do not always return to the same locality.
THE DUD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill Blueg'um in a day-dream stood
In a wet trench in Northern France;
He mused of bush-fire, drought and flood',
The emu’s run, the brolga’s dance.
And of the sun that shone each day
Oer fair Australia far away.
He thought of gay times in his youth
When at the pub his pals he’d meet
And of the dear bush girls, when, ’strutli!
A Hun shell landed at his feet.
It spattered him with Flanders mud;
But, thank the Lord, it proved a dud.
Long Bill scaled swiftly from the “bay.”
Said he: “Back in the bush I’ve struck
Some quiet-looking nags, but they
When roused would be the worst to buck.
To trust this dud I ain’t inclined—
Like them, the cow might change its mind!”

Anzacs Coming Home
One of the Services
rendered possible
by the Invention of
Dunlop Tyres . . .
Few people probably give a thought to the
important and vital part the Automobile and
Bicycle played in the great war. Without
them victory would not be ours to-day, for
Verdun would have fallen— Paris would have
been in the hands of the Huns in 1914 —and
then well, they did not fall
because of the wonderful Motor Transport
work that enabled reinforcements and supplies
to be carried speedily to vital points of defence
and offence. Motors saved the day. Going back
some years, to 1888 in fact, we find that the
bicycle of to-day —and the motor of to-day —owe
their development and efficiency to the birth and
invention of the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre; in fact
DUNLOP TYR!
made Cycling and Motoring possible. Recog-
nition of this fact, therefore, brings home what
the world to-day owes J. B. Dunlop. His
principle of using the buoyancy of compressed
air for absorption of vibration serves millions
of Motorists and Cyclists the world over, and
it helped in no small way in giving us the
greatest victory known in the annals of the
world. The history of Dunlop Tyres has been
a remarkable one. First in 1888, they have
been foremost ever since, and during that
period have conferred inestimable benefits on
the world in general. To Motorists and Cyclists
in particular they have rendered marked service
in making Motoring and Cycling popular,
pleasant, and profitable. Their fine quality,
their strength, their dependability, have gained
for “Dunlops’’ a reputation and popularity that
no other tyre enjoys in this part of the world
—and they have merited it— for no other tyre
gives such service and such value. They are
obtainable through all Agents and Garages.

spotlessly clean, spotlessly clean-shaved,
handsome, dressed in ideal clobber and an
ideal bashed hat, with a clean rake over
his shoulder and blossoms hanging from
the rake—going home at eventide accom-
panied by his ideal little yellow-thatched
daughter. The maiden is accompanied by
her tidy and faithful nanny goat and is
carrying a pet rabbit! Australia figures
largely in the scheme and the child carries a
rabbit! The writers —the Temporary Tank
does most of the writing—believe in group
settlements far from the madding crowd and
the madding pub. The colonies are to be
run at first by something like a benevolent
despotism, unlike New Australia and that
floating republic the troopship Sardinia,
which were run on principles of equality
and conversation; but they are to develop
into democracies. The tall, spotless settlers
are to take their own women folk with them,
so as to avoid reckless intermarriage with
the sirens of the soil. Persian inter-mar-
riage wrecked the Greek empire in Asia,
and Indian inter-marriage ruined the won-
derful Spanish political structure in the
two Americas, because the conquerors left
their best girls behind them. If they had
brought them and extirpated the local girl
to avoid temptation, the world’s history
would have been changed. The three
authors —the Tank, the Machine Gun and
the Peer —quote Edward Gibbon Wakefield
as an example to be followed, which is bare
justice to a great man. But Wakefield
struck a place with a very thin brown popu-
lation, and the thinness of the population
saved his people from the worst danger.
They don’t mention Brigham Young, a
greater man than Wakefield, who had the
luck to strike a still more empty region;
also Joshua, who had short and sudden ways
with the local siren. The soldier colonies
are really to start in primitive, orderly inno-
cence, and produce vegetables, and grow uo
like Topsy. Possibly they will pan out all
right. They are worth trying, as the
Garden of Eden was. Its day was short
and its site has been lost, but it is still a
pleasing memory for the oldest inhabitant
to recall over his beer.
The Artist and the Horse
An artist is supposed to be a close ob-
server ; but how often is he correct in
drawing a horse or any other four-footed
animal in motion?
To indicate action, he generally shows
a front leg on one side and a hind leg on
the other side lifted at the same time;
whereas actually the pair on one side, and
then the pair on the other side, are moved,
though it would be hardly correct to show
both legs off the ground at once, because
the hind leg is moved first, and just when
a collision appears imminent the front hoof
is lifted smartly, and the hind hoof in the
same instant comes down on the spot the
other left. The hind legs, from which all
propulsion comes, are moved just as a man
moves his legs, the quadruped’s fore limbs
being merely props.
Most artists can depict the noble animal
fairly well in a standing position. Their
idea of a racing horse, however, is shown
by extending the fore legs straight out in
front, and the hind legs straight out be-
hind, which is an utterly impossible posi-
tion for a horse to put himself into when
moving. If an accident threw him into
such an attitude he couldn’t recover him-
self. Instantaneous photography has taught
these “experts” nothing. If they desire to
indicate speed they will stretch the beast
into the same old freak attitude ; and the
greater the pace they wish to show the more
they stretch their victim.
Whether a horse is walking, trotting, or
galloping, as the driving force conies from
behind, and the body moves along with
it, the front hoof, being only a prop, come/,
down directly under the chest. A few
horses overstep, but that Fs considered a
defect.
When nature study is essentially part
of our artists’ stock-in-trade, it is strange
to find the majority of them blundering.
The late Harry Garlick faithfully trans-
ferred native animals to canvas, and the
late Neville Cayley was the best in the
treatment of birds. (A relative is following
very creditably in his track to-day). Both
these men studied wild life almost exclu-
sively. Frank Mahony and George Lam-
bert were good in a limited field. Victoria
has a couple of artists who do very fair
work in the same line, but even these, when
illustrating a work of importance, require
the guidance of a naturalist. It is a branch
of art that surely ought to be attractive,
but most of our artists, somehow, appear
to have a dread of nature’s grand domains.
E. S. SORENSON.
Lied
Dumb in the thunderous fc t years past, a
heritage of true and simple music wakes with
Saxony (and with Belgium) from the holo
caust. In the north, the Tin Hats make
swords and edge them every half-century or
so ; in the south, where the Rhine and wine
and music are, the miller and the shoe-
maker, the begging monk and the tailor make
stories every day or so for Santa Claus, for
Andersen and Grimm brothers to write down.
If not every day, there is great singing for
children and men and women at Easter, at
Pentecost and at Christmas.
Jordanes, in his history of the Goths,
speaks of dirges sung for the death of Attila;
many learned men write involved, confusing
pages about hedge-row minstrels, wayside
troubadours where no writing or reading was.
In the 10th and 11th centuries, when Hein-
rich I. and Otto 1., 11. and 111. were em-
perors of Saxony, the cheap-book mystery
plays and yarns, the Beast Epic and
the like camouflage fed the people’s
minds. Walther von der Vogelweide went
minne-singing in the 12th century, wandered
singing away from the Court into the fields.
He was more a true poet than a wandering
minstrel—the truest German lyric poet till
Goethe. Later, the rising power of the
Cistercian monks threw a black blight, a
night frost on all the seedlings of secular
letters. The slogans, “Remember Death!”
and “Renounce the Joys of Life!” were dis-
couraging.
Hans Sachs and the Meistefsingers took
it on in the 15th and 16th centuries, with
Nuremberg and the kindly eye of the Court
to help. The kindly eye killed it; it became
pedant, and died an artificial death. It rose
again With Goethe, Andersen, Heinrich
Heine, the Grimms ; now it can soften things
for the children (who will need it in Saxony),
and make the kitchens warm and brown and
comfortable for plough-hardened hands and
quiet, straight-thinking minds again.
It is the song of the fields, of an elfin com-
pany of brownies, and little fat forest men
at rest on Yule logs in the shadow of candle-
dotted fir-trees. The little white-bearded
men are tailors or apothecaries, friars or
Santa Claus himself, as the wandering robin-
song goes. In the company are thieving
mice, maidens of snow and ice, mercenaries,
acorns and wine; the scenes are granaries,
churches and barns, shops and the bedrooms
of children. The time is all seasons of the
year, but most often the story-telling time of
snow-heavy fir-trees and great fires in the
kitchens. The audience is every child, young
and middle-aged and old.
It is the folk-song of a nature-loving
family, quiet and kindly in the simplicity of
early communal life. The fields and the
corn, the grape, the grain stored for the
winter; the birth of Christ, the giving of
little gifts; the wind in the dark trees.
Hardly any moral points a warning finger
other than the unmeeded rule of kindness;
hardly any part of the never-ending story has
a climax, a purple patch or a conclusion. It
just goes on, hand in hand with a tenderness
indescribable, an absorbing interest, a
memoried atmosphere of kitchens and por-
ridge, early morning and dogs and cows. In
general the heavy lead of fairy is played
“off”; needles are swords, stones are dia-
monds, the sleigh bells speak as the story’s
logic demands; there is no supernatural
agency apparent. The tailor and the begging-
friar are their own fairies.
But the book without an end makes a
fairy-story for the world—a book that can be
opened anywhere and read for a day or an
hour; and those children in Saxony will
want all the fairy-story they can get, for
some days and hours to come.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
Party Politics
A little book entitled The Future of Party
Politics, by F. W. Raffety, suggests that
Party is rather a faded hack with a past
than a blushing flapper with a prospect.
In fact, Mr. Raffety doesn’t say much
about the lady’s future. His general sum-
mary is that Party Government isn’t as
good as it might be, and that there is no
immediate prospect of it being much better.
At the same time he knows of nothing that
is likely to be any . better. The volume sets
forth that the British House of Commons
is the Mother of Parliaments, which re-
minds one of something he has heard before,
and it states fearlessly that the Mother con-
sists of two parties except when there are
more, which is frequently, perhaps usually.
A question raised, though not with violence,
is whether secret diplomacy, so much de-
nounced by H. G. Wells and President
Wilson, is a curse. The President, having
attended a Congress of strange old nations
for the. first time, seems to have changed to
the opinion that, while treaties should be
public, some of the negotiations that lead
up to them are best kept murky. Prob-
ably he found that each envoy, in order to
leave room for the usual trade discount,
began by proving that his State was en-
on historical and other grounds, to
half its neighbor’s territory. It might be
a good basis to start from; but if the
nation got this proposition in its raw state,
and learned the vastness of its wrongs, the
lid of the volcano might blow off before
the official fire-brigade could arrive and pour
water on the subject. But Mr. Raffety
doesn t stress this point. (Geo. Allen and
Unwin, Ltd., London.)
A Satchel of Books
The Anchor, by M. T. 11. Sadler (Constable and Co.,
London). A quiet yarn of a man whose cynicism
and sensitive nature prevent him coming easily
to anchor. There is a nice girl in the book and a
young 1 Irishman whose father is the proprietor of
“Cuchalain Whisky,” and who owns a cat called
Deirdre Laddie, the hero of the tale, learns a
lot of things, misses a few bad opportunities, and
at last gets Comfort and the girl and a tolerably
safe anchorage.
“Over There” with the Australians, by Capt. R.
Hugh Ivnyvett (Hodder and Stoughton). Among
war books this tale of simple soldierly doings in
Gallipoli and France deserves a high place. The
author, for some time an Intelligence Scout, has
paid the price of the Great Adventure, but he saw
well and noted things accurately. That he did not
make an attempt at fine writing is all to his credit.
There is a description of No Man’s Land as good
as any that has come our way.
Where Angels Fear to Tread, by A. G. Hales
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). The war took
on some very picturesque aspects as well as some
very deadly ones on the Italian front. These
papers deal with a variety of subjects, but keep
pretty near to the fighting in that area. They
are very readable.
The Human Touch, by “Sapper” (Hodder and
Stoughton). Well-told war stories by a man who
was close up and saw things. There is pathos here
and some humor, together with descriptions of the
mud-heaps and shell-craters which make the death
arena in Flanders very real. The book is well
worth while.
Who Giveth Us the Victory, by Arthur Mee
(George Allen and Unwin, London). Challenged
as to how God fits into the picture of modern war,
the author produced this. The book seems harm-
less, but unnecessary.
Rotorua Rex, by J. Allen Dunn (S'keffington,
London). The vigor of this yarn almost makes it
convincing. There is any amount of excitement
packed into the book; the character of the fat
native king pleases; and there is at least one pic-
ture—where Rotorua fixes the card-cheat—which is
unusually good. The hero of the tale misses by a
narrow margin marrying the rather-too-fine English
girl who holds the island group for Britain after her
father is dead and the natives have gone drunk.
Also the king swims 35 miles in 30 hours —a world’s
record even for fiction.
Business, Bobbery, etc.
“Delia”: A South Aus. wheat-buyer re-
cently bought 200 bags of oats. The seller
came in later and said he could only deliver
150 bags. The buyer refused to accept less
than the 200 bags as he had reported the
purchase of that number, and added : “There
is a lot of red tape about these things, you
know;” A couple of days afterwards he
received a note from the seller: —-
Dear Sir, —There is no red-tape in my oats, they
are perfectly clean. If you think there is any red-
tape in them oats as you said yesterday, I am not
carting any to-day, so you will find them just the
way I have harvested them. However, if you do
not come out this afternoon I will bring an average
sample in to-night.

The claim made against the co. which
owned the Lusitania by losers of property
and relatives of victims, has just been de-
cided in an American Court in favor of
the co. The 63 claims, totalling a million
and a half sterling, were all taken together.
The claimants tried to show that the Lusi-
tania had asked for trouble by carrying ex-
plosives ; also that there was a lack of ob-
vious precautions, and a certain negligence
in getting the boats out after the ship was
torpedoed. The Court found that no ex-
plosives were carried, and that there was
no carelessness of any sort. It said the
trouble was entirely due to an illegal act
by the German Government,’ and seemed
to think the claimants might proceed against
the Hun with some hope of getting their
money.
* * * *
“Yarra Bend”: The Vic. Ministry is
not doing enough to stimulate rural produc-
tion. Consider, for instance, the State’s
inexhaustible supply of rabbits and brown-
coal, merely awaiting the touch of the right
wizard to transmute them into gold. Lately
the Department discovered a 200 ft. thickness
of brown-coal near Toora —several square
miles of it. Gippsland, which is more
crowded with rabbits than ever, also pro-
vides the right sort of soil for growing
sugar-beet. The sugar-contents of beet are
secured by boiling the juice, fuel being one
of the chief expenses. My scheme is, briefly,
that beet should be grown on Government
land above the coal-beds and fertilised by
desiccated rabbit won from the surrounding
bush and treated on the spot in brown-coal
furnaces. If Mines Minister Barnes has
any real faith in his brown-coal he will
insist on Rabbits Minister Oman co-operat-
ing with him at once.
* * * *
“Hops”: “0.K.” (B. 23/1/T9) asks for
Australian light lager. The possibility of
total prohibition has scared the country
brewer off light lager, poor in alcohol and
rich in carbohydrates. In the production
of the ordinary Aussie type of beer (malt
and sugar), only a very simple plant is
needed; but for the production of an all-
malt lager, a scientifically-built plant, con-
taining enough refrigeration to keep the fer-
menting department at between 32 and 40
degrees, is necessary. The average Aussie
beer contains about 5.5. p.c. alcohol by
weight or 12.05 p.c. of proof spirit by
measure; the average Aussie lager 4.5 p.c.
alcohol by weight, or 9.8 p.c. proof spirit
by measure. The imported lager has about
3.5 p.c. of alcohol by weight and 7.7 p.c.
proof spirit by measure. In the Aussie
beer the whole of the carbohydrates have
been converted into alcohol; in the Aussie
lager the greater part has been decomposed:
but in the imported lager the unfermented
extract amounts to as much as 2.5 p.c. Now
assuming that alcohol has no food value,
the beer containing the largest amount of
unfermented carbohydrate matter is the one
which is most useful from every point of
view, being refreshing, nourishing and con-
taining mineral substances which are readily
assimilated by the consumer. That’s why
imported lagers are, or were, popular. The
impending legislation, however, should bring
about the reduction of alcohol with a cor-
responding increase in the food value of the
beer produced, though I am of the opinion
that it will dry up the small country brewer.
In most cases he will not be able to afford
to alter his plant.
* * * *
“E.”: I read in a Yankee magazine adver-
tisement illustrated with a process block of
an elegant interior: “Red-gum. acknowledged
America’s best furnishing timber!” We
ought to send a commissioner to America to
get us some of that.
* * * *
“Outbacker”: “0.K.” (B. 23/1/T9)
swings the right bottle. The country brewer
receives no encouragement even from his
own State Government. The N. S. Wales
railway refreshment rooms sell only city-
made beer. Why not encourage the country
brewer a little by buying from the nearest
factory ?
CHINESE BEEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It is announced that 7500 quarters of Chinese
frozen beef will arrive in London;”
Old England’s beef in song may shinS;
Though most of it came from the Argentine*
But, one supposes, steadily now
’Twill be shipped from the land of the heathen Chow.
For the pig-tailed ones a golden reef
Will strike when they start to deal in beef—
Oh, Chinese beef,
To Bull’s relief
You come, so hurrah for Chinese beef i
To the Far East John, with pocketed pride,
Now looks for his “roast,” and “boiled” and “fried ,
At the meat if it’s sweet, though it be Chinese,
What hungry Britisher will sneeze?
And money Chicago would not spurn
The wily yellow men will earn.
Oh, Chinese beef,
It is past belief —-
Park Lane boards groan ’neath Chinese beef!
Do we sleep, do we dream, can the thing be true,
Chow joints on the London club’s menu !
Alas, for the aristocratic taste,
And the sirloins rare that the nobs would waste 1
Though East is East, and West is West,
The bond in beef ’tis now confessed.
Oh, Chinese beef,
England’s brand-new leaf—
“ Less opium ‘joints’; more Chinese beef I”
VICTORIA.

POVERTY
POINT
“0.K.” reminisces :
Of all the failures of Yankee star, or alleged star,
actors who have visited Australia, the failure of
Nat Goodwin was the easiest to understand. What
mostly puzzled the critics of the period was the
fact that Nat had a really big reputation to travel
on. It was a purely American reputation, and per-
haps it owed more to the profesh than to the public.
Goodwin was essentially an actor’s actor. His
technique must have appealed very forcibly to some
experienced judges of the game, for the late J. C.
Williamson was only one of many who never referred
to Nat Goodwin without adding the opinion that he
was “a fine actor,” or “a capital artist.” Aus-
tralia, which judges mummers on their voice and
Frank Bigo (of Rigo's Grand Opera) and
his manager, George Portus, awaiting
influenza's exit.
personality, rather than on their technique, had no
admiration for Nat. There is a vague tradition that
he scored heavily with a piece called “In Mizzoura,”
and might have been a financial success had he
opened his season in that comedy-drama; but as a
matter of fact |fat personally didn’t count for much
in the least unsuccessful of his productions. In “A
Gilded Fool,” the piece he started with, he counted
for nearly everything, sind was not less unconvincing
than the comedy its<jif. It demanded a touch of
genuine pathos of the farcical comedian, who was
supposed to get somewhat broken-up by the dis-
covery of his mental and moral shortcomings. But
the touch of pathos was not in Nat. He had no heart
and soul in his acting. The lack of it was evident
to Australian audiences from the jump. They are
open to have their feelings worked upon by a self-
deceiving mummer who can feel sorry for himself
at the moment; but here was a hard, unscrupulous
actor, of the card-sharping type, who had no good
emotions whatever. No lovable traits of character
suggested themselves in him. His measure was
taken by three wives who divorced him and another
(Maxine Elliott) who simply deserted him and
allowed him to get the divorce. Not so long
ago Cyril Maude stated the full strength of Nat
Goodwin, as regards sentimentality, in one of the
anecdotes with which he used to follow up his per-
formance of “Grumpy.” Goodwin, whilst visiting
England, attended a funeral in company with Beer-
bohm Tree and Forbes. Robertson. The latter
appeared to be impressed by the eloquence of the
parson, who was making a few remarks on the
beauty of the funeral service he was reading over the
coffin in the cemetery chapel. Anyhow, Robertson leaned
forward in the pew hiding his face in his hands.
Beerbohm .Tree, seated, on the other side of their
American friend, followed Robertson’s lead. Where-
upon Nat Goojhyin, finding himself the only conspic-
uously callous member of the congregation, muttered
“0 H —l, I must be in this,” and proceeded to go
through a form of weeping into his pocket-handker-
chief. His quality as a humorist and an actor is
fully expressed in that story.
“Smike”: One feature of the Rigo opera
season, just closed temporarily
at tlie Princess’s (Melb.), is
the unlovely use of such phrases
as “Didst thou?” “Wert thou?”
ans other archaic monstrosities
of speech. It is a persistent
delusion of the average amateur
translator that the'%eeond per-
son . singular pronoun of all the
Latin tongues has its nearest
English equivalent in “thou.”
As a matter of fact the tu ol
French, Italian, Spanish and, I
believe, Portuguese is the famil-
form of address between
intimates and relations, the
second person plural being em-
ployed for more distant conver-
sation. In English usage has
made the familiar and polite
forms alike “you” (second per-
son plural), and there is not
a line in a modern Dago libretto
that can be disadvantaged in
translation by using that pro-
noun. Anyhow, what is wrong
with “Did you?” “Were you?”
or “Did you see him coming?”
“Private Boxer”: Nat Goodwin never got
over Australia’s cool reception of him and
his company in ’96. Melbourne’s frigidity
particularly stiick in Nathaniel’s gizzard. A
good crowd received him cordially on his
opening night, but the next evening many
benches were empty. When he got back to
his old corner in the Lambs, N’York, Good-
win remarked : “Melbourne—huh ! A good
one-night stand!”
Unless in life’s last lap he took
unto himself a sixth missus, Nat Goodwin
died a widower-in-law, the fifth lady of his
unstable choice having divorced him’ in Sep-
tember last. Eliza Weathersly, the first
Mrs. Is at, died 30 years ago. Theji camt
Nella Pease, who divorced him; and after
her Maxine Elliott, whom he divorced after
10 years on the ground of desertion. He
married his leading lady, Edna Goodrich, a
few days later. After nearly 11 years she
applied for the usual. Margaret Moreland,
who was number five, was also Nat’s lead-
ing lady before she qualified for the role of
petitioner. Nat’s demise gives De Wolf
Hopper the chance of becoming Uncle Sam’s
most-married mime. So far lie has made
five trips to the altar —with Ella Gardiner,
Ida Mosher, Edna Wallace, Nellie Bergen
and Elda Curry.
.‘lbsenshaw”: Rostand left many un-
finished manuscript plays behind him. But
he had completed new versions of “Don
Juan” and “Faust.” He sketched out a
new piece for Sara Bernhardt (“L’Etoile”),
and had dreamed of writing another, to be
called . La Marseillaise,” which was to be
an epic—the embodiment of the spirit of
.trance. If he had lived to carry out that
project the world might have had a master-
piece.
“G.T.” : T hey sat next to me in the stalls
at the I nncess son A.N.A. night. After
lookmg over the programme he told her
that the piece” was named after the pro-
pnetor (Frank Rigo), and that he supposed
lotto stood for the name of some other
oreigner. She thoughtfully munched an-
other cnocolate. “Wonder if it’s his wife’s
name, she murmured romantically.
Ai thur R. : Hassan, the donkey imper-
sonator in the “Jack and Jill” panto., is
keen on alluvial gold-digging, and disappears
penodically for this purpose. When last
located he was at Wedderburn (the home
v>wn of Jacka, V.C.), where lie was seeking
a toitune among the ancient workings At
K p , lace y e ?M ago, when confronted sud-
denly by a wild cow in the hotel yard, Has-
san turned two double somersaults into an
empty waggon. I have been waiting ever
since to see him impersonate that astonished
“Tito”: Mention is made (B. 30/1/T9)
of a “Toy Symphony.” This is probably tee
work by Romburg, which in days gone by
was sometimes performed by the students of
the Leipsic Conservatorium at their break-
ing-up concerts. It had not, I think, been
performed in London since 1880, when it was
given by an impressive lot of stars at the
Countess of Folkestone’s charity concert in
the old St. James’s Hall. Cowen, who played
a rattle at the 1918 show, juggled the piano
in 1880.
“J.F.11.”: Cosmo Hamilton’s “Scandal,”
produced at London Strand lately, is an
ugly thing, The reckless daughter of a
peer (played by Miss Kyrle Bellew) goes
the pace and in the course of her adventures
meets one Franklin; who has made a fortune
in Australia and established a reputation as
a big-game hunter. To get out of an awk-
ward corner she suggests to this splendid
brute that they temporarily pass themselves
off as husband and wife. lie confirms her
THE NECESSARY JOURNEY.
THE PRODUCER : “Not bad, but you've a long
way to go before you'll do for principal
boy.”
THE GIRL : “Yes, I suppose I’ll have to go
'to London and come back imported.”
lying statement to the house party; but
when the guests are dispersing for the night
he tells her that, having been nominated as
her husband, he is going to exact a hus-
band’s _ rights. He then drags her by the
wrist into the bedroom, allows her as a
special concession to undress in an adjoining
room, and only becomes the fine English
gentleman again when the shivering lady is
about to get into bed. Australia can do
without it.
Mrs. Clement Scott, wudow of the famous,
hard-hitting dramatic critic of London D.T.,
has started a series of articles based on the
diaries and correspondence of her clever - and
versatile, but pugnacious and irascible, hus-
band. Scott was always pen-fighting some
opponent or other. His long connection
with the D.T. was finally severed in conse-
quence of a blistering article on the morals
of the Hamfat profession. He then started
the h bee Lance, a weekly, in which he let
himself go properly. His widow puts in a
big* claim on his behalf: “iNobody can pos-
sibly realise with what earnestness Clement
fecott fought single-handed. He raised the
once-despised trade to a fine art.” She also
credits him with the discovery of Henry
Irving.
: A recent Poverty Pointer
libelled. Wagner’s attitude to Prussianism.
JLo begin with, Wagner was a Saxon, so
1 russianism was naturally abhorrent to
him. He was exiled from Germany for
many years as a penalty for conspiring
against Prussian domination. Like most
artists, especially the musical portion of the
tribe, he was an out-and-out Republican.
Even when Ludwig of Bavaria was shelling
out com in bushels to help Wagner’s musical
projects,. the musician would seize every
opportunity to introduce his enlightened views
on the politics of the day. Ludwig would
then start to whistle, and only stop when
Wagner switched back to music.
Ivopai”: Truly American shrewdness
marks the method of the managers of that
uplifting” stunt, the Chautauqua. A pretty
little lady “organiser” goes forth first to
spy out the land, gathering together a bunch
oi susceptible greybeards to whom she lisps
a story of uplift, education of the masses,
cheap and good entertainment, music, drama,
or child welfare, according to the bunch’s
leanings, and asks for a tenner apiece
guarantee that this company of visiting phil-
anthropists shall not suffer financially by
then- altruism. Greybeard generally “falls
tor it,” as the charmer would say. The
guarantee is usually enough to keep the
civic authority off any interference, and
to provide a good site, free lighting and so
forth for the project. The programme is
plain vaudeville, leavened with lectures and
organised games, American accented humor
and stock drama. The Chautauqua man-
agers stick tight to the money-office, while
the guarantors sell the admission tickets
It the venture fails Chautauqua folds its
tent and steals silently away with the
guaranteed £3OO or so ; if it wins, the rake-
off is anything up to £l5OO. It’s the safest
thing ever in uplifts.
“Yak”: Some of the theatrical press-
agents sweat for their money. One recently
hammered out a par. to the effect that Miss
iilondi Peroxide had had her share of excit-
ing experiences during the war, having
travelled on the Bloatshire and the Foolwa,
both of which had since been torpedoed!
\\ hat a silly trade it is!
Dress Circle Ann”: When the ’flumonia
lias passed away and the useful V.A.D.’s are
looking for another national job, I suggest
that they form themselves into a sanitary
squad for dusting tramguards and actresses.
Cong before the theatres closed the dinginess
of some of the chorus-girls drove me from
the stalls back into the circle. As to the
tramguards well, it’s a dusty job at best;
but when I am ordered to mask myself by
an autocrat who licks the tickets and looks
as if he had been rolling in the dust for
days, I revolt. Then there are the little
shop people who scoop up lollies with their
hands, and the Dago oyster saloonist whose
back yard looks like the ruins of Belgium
and smells like the Pit.
Every photographer in Melbourne and
Sydney will know the actor. He wanted a
score of fairly large photographs of himself,
and sat for the picture with due elaboration.
It took two hours to get him. When the
proof arrived he wanted a few little things
touched out, and a trifle here and there
licked in. The second proof exhibited the
need of some stippling. So did the third,
fourth and fifth. The sixth seemed better,
but there was perhaps a trifle too much eye-
brow. The seventh showed some need 'of
darkening the dimple. After the eighth he
thought the picture would do pretty well.
“I think you can go on with them now,”
he said. “You see, I don’t want an elaborate
picture for professional purposes, but just
a portrait of me as I am for a dear lady.”
“W -A.C.”: Concerning small audiences.
One wild night in a Bananaland town just
six people turned up with boots caked with
black mud to a Marie Narelle concert. When
the deluge was roaring its loudest on the
corrugated-iron roof a Sydney baritone was
beefing out, “I can hear the pibroehs sound-
ing. ’ . The adjacent cocky pushed his whis-
kers in my ear and yelled, “He must have
d —d good hearing.”
REFINED COMEDY.
CYRIL SPOTLLITE: “Considering the circum-
stances, my success in ‘Hamlet’ is rather
funny, don't you think?”
JULIUS BLAKKOUT : “Aw, yaas — that’s
exactly what I said. Funny, y’know,
damned funny, without being in the
least bit vulgar!”
“0. Ockney”: Perennial “Peter Pan” bobs
up again at its old London stand—-the play’s
14th consecutive season. A new Peter
appears in Faith Celli, a daughter of Frank
Celli, of light-opera renown. There is also
a new Smee, the part hitherto sustained by
George Shelton, remembered in Australia as
a fruity comedian wasted in support of J. L.
Toole. Smee is this time in the hands of
old-friend George Anson, who, although in
his 72nd year, is still effective in character
studies. Peter’s “producer” is still Dot
Boucicault.

My I entree, sirs, my duty I’ll not shirk it.
To show them what High Art is, I’m prepared to

And play the long-neglected Joppa circuit.
The Israelites and Arabs—what an audience I’ll
draw,
And paralyse with each impersonation !
I 11 knock ’em cold with Shakspeare, and I’ll warm
’em up with Shaw—
The Jordan soon will be a confla^fitfiim!
My native land neglects me —I admit it, sirs, with

For me out there upon the Joppa circuit!

The Car of Quality.
Choose An Overland
The great Overland range of models includes a car for
practically every need of motoring.
And the popularity of Overland cars is due to five distinct advan-
tages appearance, performance, comfort, service and price .
Here we show the famous Model 90, a car light enough
to be very “mobile,” yet heavy enough to hold the road easily;
powerful, easy to drive and easy to ride in.
Investigate this Model 90 at your early convenience. Then;
with hundreds of thousands of other people, you will choose
an Overland.

With the big, impressive metropolitan con-
cerns scrapping for business in the same
field, this little co.’s progress is very slow.-
For the past year gross earnings, after
providing something for contingencies, were
equal to only £l3 ss. sd. p.c. on the average
funds. Exes, swallowed £7 7s. 9d.; so
there remained a net profit equal to only
£5 17s. Bd. on every £lOO of shareholders’
funds. Capital is £85,000 and £94,988 of
reserves have been accumulated. So the
10 p.c. dividend is not all it looks; the
actual return to shareholders on their funds
is less than half of that. This shows how
very slowly the balance-sheet figures have
moved :—•
1898. 1908. 1918.
Capital and reserves . . £144,117 £163,014 £184,239
Liabilities .. .. 212,677 240,743 248,664
Liquid assets . . . . 67,773 88,635 108,064
Advances 280,700 310,816 322,338
Premises 8,321 4,306 2,500
After being in business for 54 years the
bank holds under a quarter of a million of
deposits, and during the past 10 years only
£7921 more of the public’s money has been
given into the bank’s care. During the
same period over £21,000 of disclosed profits
have been left in the business. It is for
those very reasons a solid little concern.
For every £1 of its own funds it holds
only £1 7s. of the public’s money, whereas
in the big concerns a proportion of under
£8 of outside money to every £1 of share-
holders’ funds is reckoned safe enough.
Further 43J p.c. of all liabilities is held
liquid—very liquid, as this shows: cash,
£43,967; Victorian Government debentures,
£42,277; war loan, £21,700; stamps, £l2O.
To represent the £140,000 of depositors’
money not represented by liquid assets there
are the £322,338 of advances and £2500 in
premises (book value). So 50 p.c. of these
assets would have to be lost before creditors
were denied their full 20s. in the £l.

From the well-known Laborite who wrote
before :
Re my letter (B. 30/1/T9) and The Bulletin’s
query regarding undivided profits of private bank-
ing institutions. I point out, in reply, that these
undivided profits were not made out of the share
holders’ capital, but out of the money deposited
by customers of the banks, many of whom re-
ceived no interest. As a case in point, I need only
refer to the three banks under notice. 'Their
capital totals about £3,000,000, and the deposits
£ 20,04)0,000. In my opinion the cases quoted by
you are not analogous. Labor will be treating
the bank shareholders’ very fairly if it pays them
face value for their shares. As the Wild Cat
column knows, many of the banks have watered
their capital at different times, and the face value
of the shares exceeds the amount originally sub-
scribed for same. Surely The Bulletin does not
| expect Labor to pay the Stock Exchange value for
the shares!
This letter indicates the gross injustice
which, according to our correspondent, his
party contemplates. The party, he says,
proposes, when it gets the power, to expro-
priate private bank shareholders, paying
face value for their shares, in the belief that
“many of the banks have watered their
shares at different times.” Now, as a mat-
ter of fact, no Australian bank has watered
its shares. No single instance can be cited.
On the other hand, there is hardly an Aus-
tralian bank which has not issued shares at
a premium. That is-to say, the shareholder
has paid in actual cash for his shares more
than the face value of the shares, the pre-
mium or excess being added to the reserves.
In the case of the Bank of Western Aus-
tralia, for instance, the premiums have been
approximately three times greater than the
so-called capital.

A dream of old times:—
We were chatting about the good old times on
Melbourne Stock Exchange during the Broken Hill
boom. Gave £2OOO for my seat and cleared it by
brokerage alone in three months. There was always
a “whisky buck” outside the room between 5 and
6 o’clock, when Dan Crawford and John Dewar
were the chief operators. Fortified by two Dans
and a Johnny, the biggest operator of those days
would shout out “Buyer of 5000 British or any
part. Any sellers? Give £5.” “Right, you’ve
got ’em,’.’ whispered a member. “Make it 10,000,”
roared the first enthusiast. “All right,” was the
reply, and the line was booked. “Sell 5000 Com-
modore Vanderbilts at 155.,” quoth I on one
occasion. “Take ’em and 5000 more,” said a
supporter of the stock. “Right,” said I ; “make
it 15,04)0.” He did and gave me a marked
cheque next morning. During one d l ay I sold
10,000 Broken Hill Props, privately at £lO, and
did not disturb the market by so much as half-a-
crown in the price. My brokerage was 2s. a
share. Once I sold 8000 Melbourne Trams in the
room at £8 Ss., and the market closed, Ifuyer
£8 55., seller £8 6s. for selling 204)0 Mount
Lyells at 15s. for an original holder he gave me
.600 as a present, which I held to the bitter end
and sold in London at £l2 10s. cum rights. Went
to Broken Hill in 1887 and visited the Broken
Hill South shaft. Could see the bottom from the
top; one man below, one on the brace and a boy
working a whip with an old grey horse. I sold
3000 at 85s. and bought back at 755. My oath,
they were good days!

Tuning pin in all-icon wrest-
plank. The pin is kept
tight against the face oj its
bearing by a set-screw which
is adjusted at the factory.
The operator, in tuning,
proceeds as with any other
piano.
Top of Beale wrest-plank,
showing the tuning pins in
relation to the wrest-planh.
When fully strung, this part
of the piano bears a strain
of nearly JO tons. No
wooden wrest-plank can in-
definitely stand such a strain
without the wood fibres
finally beiue crushed.
Complete iron frame. Note
how the top is cast eti
bloc with the rest of the
frame, giving a construction
that will endure for ever.
This strength of the Beale
Piano is the secret of its
tone-permanency.
7 'HE use of an all iron wrest - plank
enables us to guarantee the tone quality
of the Beale Piano for at least 25 years .
This is about ten years longer than the guarantee of most
other makers. With our all-iron tuning system the pins are
permanently held in position. Vibration above the pressure
bar—owing to loose pins—is impossible in a Beale instrument

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method 'of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by .Natural Means. —
The secret of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature’s own method. The
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be removed, and an opportunity given
to the finer one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to re-
main on the face that so many women, and
even young girls, suffer from pimples,
blotches and sallow dull skins. To remove, by
absorption, the dead outer skin, and with it,
all blemishes, the use of mereolized wax is
universally recommended, ordinary face
creams being powerless for this purpose.
Smear the wax over the face and neck, rub it
gently into the skin, and leave it on all night.
In the morning wash it off. using Pilenta
soap and warm water, when all the dead skin
will be removed with the wax. Then apply a
lotion to prevent any trace of greasiness
being noticeable and to give a peach-like
bloom to the skin. A lotion to do this can be
made up quite cheaply from the following
recipe: Take one ounce of eleminite and dis-
solve it in four tablespoonfuls of hot water.
Place in a bottle, and when cool apply to the
face with the fingertips, allowing it to dry on
the skin.
To Remove Blackheads.—Dissolve one effer-
vescing stymol tablet in a glass of liot water,
allow the effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over the
face. Allow it to remain on for a few min-
utes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from re-appearing, use a styinol
tablet in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—Before shampooing the
hair dip the lingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil, and thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can
fall, and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
Grey Hair. —To restore the color of grey or
fading hair, take two ounces of concentrated
tammalite, and mix it with three ounces of
bay rum; apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will grad-
ually resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck, use jettaline. Get a tube
of this from the chemist and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks, and you will find that
the skin will become beautifully clear and
white.
BABY. —You need not lose your pretty com-
plexion. Get a tin of mercolized wax, and
rub a little well into the face every night.
This well remove the dead outer skin and
reveal the pretty fresh new skin underneath.
Be careful what soap you use. as this is very
important. .1 should suggest Pilenta.
MATER.—To reduce yourself to your original
weight, get a packet of clynol berries and eat
four daily, one after each meal and one at
bedtime. When once you have returned to
your normal weight you can discontinue
them, as the cure is permanent and not merely
temporary, as so many others are. There is
no need to make any alteration in your diet.
DISAPPOINTED. —I am not surprised that
you have been disappointed in your hair: you
are not using a suitable shampoo. Get a
packet of stallax and shampoo the hair every
fortnight with this. It will make it soft and
keep it fair.
NELLIE.—There is nothing more disastrous
to beauty than superfluous hair. In that you
are right, but you are wrong in thinking that
there is no permanent cure. Get an ounce of
powdered pheminol and a tube of tekko paste.
These two, used in conjunction, will perma-
nently remove the growth.
GERTIE. —The lotion to which you refer is
made as follows: Get an ounce of cleminite
and mix it with four ounces of warm water.
Allow it to chol. bottle, and dab over the face,
allowing it to dry on the skin. This is far
superior to powder, and gives a fresh bloom
to the face without the appearance of make up.
MAISIE.—Yes. the longer your eyelashes the
larger and brighter your eyes will look. To
increase the growth of the lashes rub a little
mennaline into the roots every night. Do this
very gently, but thoroughly, arid you Will be
delighted with the result. [2

THE HABITUES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Among those on the platform were the State
Commandant (Major-General Lee), Lieutenant-Colonel
'l'ravers, and Captain Taylor (Staff Officer for
Invalids). —Familiar newspaper item.
The Digger returning to Sydney by train,
After doing his bit over-sea,
Can bet on one cert.—come hail, shine or rain,
He’ll strike Taylor and Travers and Lee.
Appalling affliction and things may accrue,
Causing cold-footed persons to flee;
No Bolshevik threats, nor attacks of the ’flu.
Worry Taylor or Travers or Lee.
The train may arrive at eleven-fifteen,
Or at seven or midnight or three;
Whatever the hour the same trio is seen—•
That is Taylor and Travers and Lee.
The soldiers tear off, and majestic, alone,
There remain that pre-eminent three,
Exemplars of martial deportment and tone —
Namely, Taylor and Travers and Lee.
In glad years to come, when the boys are all home,
As though in a vision, I see -
Three ghosts who the Central untiringly roam.
Their names? Taylor and Travers and Lee.
N.S.W.
B. A. PLONK.
Gladstone Eyre, well-known artist, has
been notified of a windfall 'to comfort the
evening of his day, his share of an Eng-
lish. family estate being worth about £7OOO.
“Gladdie” Eyre (who, by the way, is unre-
lated to Sydney D.T.’s hardworking Hal)
has put his name to a few hundred —it may
b? thousand—landscapes which are scattered
all over Australia.
“Bath Chairman”: The most Webster-
footed department I have yet wheeled into
is the parcels-post den outside Sydney
Central Station. The receipt of a pink
notice that a parcel is lying there for me
always makes_ me groan. I "have to go ou:
to the edge of Sydney and grow old leanin,
on a counter while customs postmen wande:
to and fro with bits of paper in their hands
wearing the air of lost souls on the way t
a worse world. Instead of bits of pape
they should have lantern and dogs, long-
beards and robes with knotted girdles. To
assist the air of hopelessness and gloom.
Gregorian chants should be kept going all
day until it is time to change into plain
clothes, shut up the asylum and go home.
It might be called the Creeping Paralysis
Department.
“Senex”: Various Bulletin pars about
the old flyers Cutty Sark and Thermopylae
bring me on deck. I was once shipmates
with Kemball, who had been mate of the
latter ship. He said it was nothing out
of the ordinary for her to average 15 knots
an hour for the day’s run, “running the
easting down,” and on one occasion, off the
Western Isles, for three-quarters of an hour
she showed over 18 knots. Twice they met
the Cutty Sark in the chops of the Channel,
and went pelting hell-for-leatlier up to the
Downs, neck-and-neck, with to’ga’n’sails
flying, when other ships considered a main
topsail quite decent dress considering the
weather. The Thermopylae’s record of 64
days to Melbourne still stands, though it
was nearly beaten before her time by Capt.
Forbes, the first man (I believe) "to try
great circle sailing. Leaving Liverpool his
last voyage, as the vessel cleared the dock
gate he jumped on the taffrail and bellowed
out to the crowd of people on the pierhead,
“Melbourne or Hell in 60 days !” He was
sighted making up for Otway on the 59tli
day. But he never reached Melbourne or
any other port. Queen Victoria once paid
him the usual stereotyped compliment about
England being proud of such a son. Where-
upon Forbes threw out his chest and in his
best main-topsail haul voice said: “Irish,
y’r Majesty, and proud of it!”
Mrs. Grundy shook the hair-pins out of
her head when the war started, and said
that there was going to be a terrible lot of
family trouble presently. Yet the plain
knibbs truth is that in 1917 only 4.9 p.c.
of the total births in the Commonwealth
were “ex-nuptial,” as against 6.24 p.c. in
1905. In fact, there wasn’t a year between
1902 and 1910 when the rate was less than
6 p.c., and there wasn’t a previous year in
Commonwealth records when the rate fell
below 5 p.c.
From an Australian in German East
Africa:—.
East Africa is the Mecca of Indians at a loose
end in their own land. Instead of immigration
being stopped the influx is greater than ever. There
are no opportunities for an artisan other than an
Indian in either British or German E.A. ; even rail-
ways are run by Indians. However, it is a poor
Indian who works for any time for a boss, and very
soon after his arrival in East Africa he is found
as a small merchant and in the way to become a
merchant prince. The white people take the line
of least resistance and patronise the Indian trader
in the 1 azaar in preference to the European trader
in 1.0 street. Nearly every rupee spent with the
Indian goes to Iris home in cash and is salted down ;
so British East Africa is rapidly becoming a land
of paper.
German East Africa is never-ending bush. There
are, it is true, many rubber plantations; but after
four years’ war they are nearly all ruined. Simi-
larly the sisal hemp plantations have gone to rack.
It is difficult to see why Germans heavily subsi-
dised this colony of theirs, excepting as a submarine
base. There are no great plains as in British East,
buc only never-ending, dry, thick bush interspersed
with mighty baobab or eream-of-tartar trees. Inci-
dentally, these baobabs are useless as cover, for
a .303 bullet will go right through a 12ft. trunk at
600 yards. Everywhere one goes the Indian trader
lias his duka or store, and trading in kind with the
natives is a sure source of income. A native
woman, with a baby on her back and 601 b. of meal
on her head, walked in 60 miles to Irihga and was
quite satisfied to trade the meal for a piece of
cotton cloth one yard by half a yard. Then she
walked back.
The East Africans have passed a resolution
that, “under no circumstances, will occupied terri-
tory be given back to the Germans,” a sentiment
everyone will concur in; but, knowing the B.E.
Africans, I am quite sure that they will not come
o erman East and put in deadly work in a deadly
climate as pioneers and land-reclaimers.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Nancy Birdwood, who is to marry Frank
Craig, the Westralian aviator, next month,'
has kept a promise she made to a wounded
Billjim in the Palace Hospital in January,
’l6. She came to the bedside of a corporal
who had been shot in the head by a Turkish
sniper at Suvia Bay. ~ When she was about
to leave Billjim said: “I hope, Miss Bird-
wood, that you will come to Australia when
the war is over.” “I intend to do so,” re-
plied “Birdy’s” daughter. “And I hope that
you will bring an Aussie husband with you,”
added the corporal. “I will do that just to
please you boys,” answered the visitor
laughing. Nancy met Billjim at Tel-el-Kebir
when most of the men had just returned from
Anzac and were worn-out and ill-tempered
after their wonderful struggle against Abdul.
She is a tall, slender, quiet girl. Her usual
parting remark in the wards was, “Hurry up
and get well; daddy wants you on the other
side.” The Diggers had their own ideas
about hurrying up, but they did not confide
them to the cheery English girl.
After vague rumors and contradictions in
high quarters, the G.-G.’s term of office is
definitely extended to May, 1920. The news
will be borne with general equanimity.
A w'ord comes along from that sporty
young Irishman, Captain (now Major)
Wallis, who was on Governor Strickland’s
staff in 1914. He linked up with the A.I.F.
soon after war broke out, got badly damaged
in Gallipoli and was medically described
as off the active-service list. He recovered,
went to England, joined his old regiment—
the Third Wilts —in France, met with a
bad accident at the Front, got better, went
at it again, and is now, after dodging death
for over four years, in his accustomed health.
“I have been,” he says, “something or other
at the Front in almost every rank—even
rose to be acting-brigadier. That was in
France. But I have only climbed to my
majority in my own regiment. . . .And now
I long to see Australia again !”
“Lindsay-Browne.—February 9, at Leura,
Marjorie, wife of L. Lindsay-Browne.”
There’s a tragedy. Married little more
than a year ago, J. C. Williamson’s winsome
and artistic daughter seemed to have every-
thing to make life worth living—health,
talents, money, troops of friends, the soldier-
boy of her heart. But, within a few days of
the arrival of baby she contracted double
pneumonia; and after that there was a long,
desperate struggle, with only the black
camel at the end of the avenue.
Autumn-hats, small and shaped like mini-
ature beehives, are being opened every day.
Only in the shops as yet. Where is the
woman who feels like trying on a new hat
with a dreary waste of butter-muslin tied
across her face?
The expected happened when the feminine
owner of a tiny bundle of fluff—-a toy terrier
with alarm in his eyes—produced her treas-
ure for inoculation. Turned down, of
course, and the lady took the dose in her
own forearm.
Just how hygienic is the fancy mask per-
haps the Health Department may whisper
during the next week. Frills and gossamer
fallals are not likely to be popped into the
boiling pot o’ nights, because they’d turn
into a damp, blotting-paper mash.' So the
white cotton gloves of the Law mav yet
descend on the liouri who is dressed to kill
everything but microbes.
Of course the knut had to be heard from.
He appeared with a grinning mouth painted
on his white mask, and “Hullo, Everybody !”
printed around the mock orifice.
Those exciting moments called companies’
meetings are under the ban, too. In most
cases the directors with great fortitude have
decided to just pay the dividend and trust
to shareholders not to be annoyed about it.
But one of the biggest companies of all, the
one that Sydney housewives make insulting
remarks about when there isn’t enough gas
to cook the dinner, decided on something
else. Its shareholders (a few of them)
assembled somewhere or other in the city
and then adjourned to a ferry steamer,
where all hands were invited to meet. It
sounds like a select party going into the
bush to play two-up away from the eyes of
the law.
In spite of from Mother of
Ten, the dislocation of business and the sud-
den unemployment of a few thousand women
in this State hasn’t produced a rush for
domestic work. The Robert Anderson dame
is, with Ur. Grace Boelke and other wise
heads, trying meanwhile to put a name to it
when the average girl asks, “Where does
next Friday’s wage come from?” A commit-
tee to handle the economic side of the in-
vasion, so far as girls and their older sisters
are concerned, met in the dawn of this week
at the Trades Hall. Suburban housemothers
hope to catch a few willing hands —on satis-
factory terms to the girls —during these slack
business times. But hope springs eternal in
the Subbubs’ breast.
Nobody wants the nuisance, and Manly’s
town clerk indignantly denied a published
statement that a “resident” had the scourge
—the patient had not been staying in the
village since the end of January, and lived
in a suburb much nearer to the city. This
eased the flutter amongst visitors. Haying
flown from the heavily-masked metropolitan
flat, it would have been a crushing blow for
White Flannels and his lady to meet the
curse on'the beach.
The V.A.D. girl is adding a mask to her
cap and apron, and has respo? ded promptly
to the Health Department’s warning cry
that her . help may be needed. Depots are
being opened in most of the crowded city
areas, with V.A. commandants in charge.
That übiquitous building, St. John’s school,
in Darlinghurst-road, bearing large posters
on its brown stone face, is one of the busy
emergency centres.
This is a picture of the lady who has
taken hold of the Social Welfare work re-
cently started by
Farmer’s. Tact, com-
mon-sense, patience,
and judgment, with
a solid education,
are among the few
things needed in a
Welfare worker. In
Miss Eleanor M.
Hinder, graduate in
Science of Sydney
Uni., the directors of
Farmer’s believe
they have secured
the genuine article.
After graduating
she taught biology
at North Sydney
Girls’ High School,
and lectured to
classes organised by
the Workers’ Educational Association. But
it was as president of the W.E.A. Club that
she came closest in touch with the big job she
has now undertaken. The photo is one of
Judith Fletcher’s.
Brisbane's revelations
On February 5 at St. James’s Church, Toowoomba,
Lieut. J. S. Young, son of the Kingaroy Youngs, was
married to Ada Corbett, a popular Toowoomba
girl.
The other day the Goold-Adams dame opened the
new- Epileptic Home at Willowburn. There are
two wards foi* men and two for women patients.
The whole place is picturesque and hygienic, and
patients have a much better chance of recovery
than they would in a crowded asylum ward. The
patients at Willowburn will presently be instructed
in industrial work.
Heather Macphcrson, daughter of the Ronald
Macphersons of Whyenbah, Dirranbandi, is en-
gaged to J. IT. Chandler, son of the W. J.
Chandlers, of Warwick. Pretty Mrs. Jack Chandler,
whose soldier husband was recently invalided to
Australia, is a cousin of Miss Macpherson.
The Robert Philps and the W. H. Barr.eses are
marooned in Tasmania. Gladys Frost, the pianbtf,
is also there.
Senior-Sister Ethel Butler, a member of the
fighting family ( which includes Lt.-Col. Graham
Butler, Lieut. Colin Butler and Trooper Dave
Butler, was recently awarded the Royal Red Cross.
She is now senior sister at the Bombay Military
Hospital. Lt.-Col. Butler is voyaging to England,
where he intends to publish “The Medical History
of the .War” from the commencement of hostilities.
Mrs. F. Watts, the new Mayoress of Toowong, is
an ardent temperance reformite. Hubby himself
sat in the highest perch of the Good Templars for
four years. Mrs. Watts’ other recreations are the
W.C.T.U. and the National Council of Women. No
champagne lunches for Toowong this term.
The cable last week announced the marriage in
London of Myee Harrison. Her bridegroom is Lieut.
W. H. Bryan, M.C., son of the W. Bryan pair of
Chelmer. Lieut. Bryan was one of the most
brilliant undergrads, at our young University.
Mrs. Reynolds (Alma Whittaker), a
breezy Anglo-’Murkan on the staff of Los
Angeles Times, is here on a honeymoon
trip. Her husband grows oranges in Cali-
fornia. No—not an orchard. It’s a ranch
over there. In consequence of meeting ’flu
on this side the Reynoldses will hurry back
to the States via Vancouver. “But we’ll come
again. This place is too beautiful to just
fly over,” says the lady, who has evolved in
12 years from a young London press-woman
to a Californian feature-writer with a brisk
style.
In the Sun Mrs. Reynolds has had Aus-
tralia on the mat and tells us that our
trains and our hotels ought to make us
ashamed. But how many Australian trains
has she seen? There isn’t one in the U.S.A.
—not even the Twentieth Century, which
flies between Chicago and New York—that
shouldn’t blush alongside either the Mel-
bourne-Adelaide or the East-and-West ex-
press. The American Pullman, from the
woman’s point of view, is just a plain hor-
ror. A long carriage, with bunks on either
side, men and women mixed —you can’t
dress: you just wriggle in and out of your
clothes behind a curtain that falls flush
with the side of your bunk. If you’re very
lucky you may get a “parlor car” or a
“compartment”—dog-boxes at the end of the
Pullman —but you’ll pay through the nose
for it.
As for hotels, certainly we haven’t the
like of the Biltmore or the Waldorf or the
Vanderbilt. But if you get away from these
for less than 10 dollars a day somebody has
forgotten something, and you’ll be much
more likely to be socked for 12 dollars or
more. In Australia you reckon you’re
robbed if you pay more than £l—less than
five dollars —at the best.
Eva Benson, the Westralian sculptress,
has been one of the season’s most successful
exhibitors of portrait reliefs in London. She
sold her “Persephone” to the President of
the Royal Institute of Fine Arts, Colonel
Hugh Reid.
Soprano Lillian Mitchell has secured the
Town Hall for her concert on April 19—
luckily a long way ahead. She expects to
try her fortune in U.S.A. towards the end of
the year.
Dolores goes on to Maoriland next week,
instead of warbling first in this well-masked
town. Later on, all being well, the cosy-
looking brown-eyed lady will give us her
swan song before returning to France.
Private Robbie Clunies Ross, who was
killed in France a few weeks before the
armistice, was a son of Mrs. Clunies Ross
of Aslifield. He had made zoology his hobby
and pursued it even in the trenches. An
elder brother, a captain of Diggers, died in
the Queen Alexandra Hospital (London)
only a week or so before Robbie’s end came
in France. The sorrowful mother has one
boy—the baby of the family—left out of a
promising trio of sons.
There is no son to go on with the Dilke
title, as the recently-dead Sir Charles left
no family. He married Miss Faithfull, of
the N.S.W. pastoral family, three years ago
in England.
The infant son of Lord »and Lady Lough-
borough—Sheila Chisholm, you know—had
an Australian godmother, Miss Mollie Little,
of Sydney. The infant’s godfathers are the
Duke of Sutherland, Lord Leopold Mount
Batten (whom we used to* know as Prince
Leopold Battenburg), Captain Drummond,
and Captain Alastair Macintosh. Peter
George Alexander is the new darling’s name.
Minister for Health J. D. Fitzgerald eyes
the epidemic over the top of four folds of
gauze. And he ex-
pects everyone else
to do the same. But
he makes one mild
protest-—he is not by
any means the first
since English John
to close the churches.
“During the cholera
in Italy,” he re-
marks, “30-odd years
ago, all c. li urches
were shut up, but
not till there had
been a heavy toll of
lives. Italians
rushed in crowds to
pr ay in t h eir
churches, and the
excessive death-roll
brought the order to
close them. Our neighbor, Maoriland, also
closed churches, theatres and other places
of public resort, but unfortunately not till
the pneumonic trouble had got a long start.
We have their sad experience to guide us.
The N.S.W. Health Authorities prepared
for the worst as soon as it barked in the
distance. More than that we have the
magnificent support of the people. With-
out that —and to the women of the com-
munity we are specially grateful—neither
Minister nor Department could put up any
real fight against the menace.” Then John
D. Fitzgerald soothes a ’phone that hums
like an infuriated bee-farm.
Coming back this way in July, Nurse
Edith Armstrong, of Mosman and Maori-
land, who has been massaging our boys for
four years and more, paying her own pas-
sage to Blighty in order to do it. A sister
i» T Lottie Armstrong, hon. sec. to the
Women’s Service Club, whose lecture before
the Workers’ Educational Association will
bo seen in print shortly. In July she goes
across to have a look at Woodrow Wilson’s
territory.
How will the passport Peri view the pro-
jected departure of Vida Goldstein as one
of the three Melbourne delegates to an Inter-
national Peace Congress in Europe? Date
and place of meeting are still in the air.
Sydney’s Peace Society will presumably have
some say, too —there are a few who will cer-
tainly want to coo or peck at the gathering.
The War Chest depot—carefully masked
—re-opens for morning sessions only till the
’flu tames down.
Amongst the relatives mentioned as con-
nected with just-deceased Mrs. Margaret
Johnston, a Lachlan pioneer, is Sir Edward
Carson. The gentleman who barks with such
fury when he sees green is a coifSln of the
late Condobolin resident.
After heroically playing, so to speak, with
typhus and other Servian horrors, Sergeant
Olive Kelso King had to give in to the ’flu.
The Sydney girl is convalescing in the
Riviera or thereabouts, with a sister to give
her moral and other support.
The call of the city becomes more insist-
ent than the siren-song of the surf, and, one
by one, doctor and dentist, with brother
Six-an’-eiglit, uncurl from the clinging arms
of the South Coast beaches, and, masked
and scowling, make for the big trade with
the harbor front.
Austinmer is plunged into gloom on the
departure of the Belgian Consul, with the
glory of his immense yellow beach-umbrella
edged with dark brown. The- bracelet and
the rings the Consul wore while bounding
in the surf so fascinated a small Australian
that she pulled violently at her sister's
Canadian. “He must be a prince in exile,’’
she whispered excitedly.
Dr. Herrick Knowles smiles through his sun-
burn o’ week ends, while Mrs. Herrick (who
was Lily Titheradge, and just saved from
being a stage-beauty by an early marriage)
sews a fine seam, or darts about the swim-
ming fools like a jolly mermaid.
Marriages decreased materially in Aus-
tralia during the war, but in Great Britain
they were about 50,000 a year above the
average. ; British soldiers, back on short
leave, got married occasionally in London,
some because they were bachelors and some
because their wives were as far away as
Aberdeen. Departing soldiers got married
in haste. Canadian, Australian, Maoriland,
American and miscellaneous soldiers married
in passing. Refugees swore they hadn’t left
a wife in Brussels or Belgrade and took to
themselves daughters of the land. Invalids
got married, so that the girl might inherit their
property after death, and then either recovered
or left no property. Women got married two
or three times for the sake of the separation
allowances. Life wasn’t altogether drab
and dull near the seat of war.
Lieut.-Col. St. Hill, D. 5.0., of. the, North-
umberland Fusiliers, killed in Italy just
before the armistice, was married to a Syd-
ney girl, Lilian. Carr,.
Chanter, M.H.R., has been looking sea-
wards for a son arid a grandson. The
former, a major who got the D. 5.0., was
on the transport Somali, and the latter, a
captain and original Digger, was expected
on the same boat—he got the four-years-
service leave just before the cracking up
of the foe. ‘ ' .
Just before the border between Mamma
and. Victoria became a quarantine fence,
George Wensor, Lieut., M.C., a Haberfield
man, married an Albury girl in her native
town. The ‘border lass was Ida Arnold, a
daughter of J. G. Arnold.
It’s easier now than it was—say four
months ago—to cross the foamy track to
Blighty. Mrs. J. W. Clark —the all-wool
qrieen of the 30tli Battalion Comforts’ hive
—-got passports for self and two youngsters
the other week. The triplet leave for Lon-
don, to join daddy, by the Orontes on
Feb. 15,
Victor Xavier Daley, a son of late poet
Victor, is back home. He wears the red
stripe and four blues. Also two gold wound
stripes. Young Daley means now to finish
his training as a surveyor.
Mrs. Jim Macartlur Onslow and her
two daughters are on the passenger list of
a boat leaving in March for ’Murka. They
go on to England, where the young soldier
of the family is waiting his turn to embark
for Aussie.
Stiff luck for an Anzac and old Sydney
Grammar boy. Lieutenant Stewart Paul,
who left with the 6th Light Horse in 1914,
came safely through Gallipoli and Palestine
and made good in the Flying Corps, was
drowned lately in home waters. A quoit
flung wide, a lurch of the troopship in the
Bight, and the Wiltshire tossed overboard
an adored only son and fine officer just
when his people were preparing to welcome
him home.

Equip your Motor
Cycle with Goodyear
Blue Streak Tyres
The existing conditions under
which Motor Cycle Tyres have
to serve in Australia, make it
imperative for the motorist, in
his own interests, to select only
that tyre which has given the
best results.
The records of the Goodyear Blue Streak
Motor Cycle Tyre in racing, in rough travel,
in commercial and military service, are
convincing evidence of its ability to with-
stand rough wear.
Goodyear Tyres, whether for Trucks, Motor Cars, or
Motor Cycles, are built to last and to give service
second to none.
For this reason special care is bestowed on the carcass
or foundation of the tyre, for if that is deficient in any
way the excellence of the tread counts for very little.
Compare Goodyear Blue Streak Tyres point by point
with every other Motor Cycle Tyre, and see how in
every way they vindicate our claim of absolute
superiority.
Here are some of the many advantages they possess —
*
(a) Freedom from Blowouts through the “On Air
Cure,” the tyres being vulcanized on air bags inflated to
the size and shape they will assume in use.
(b) Extra big thick wear resisting Diamond Block
Tread, always dependable for service and big mileage.
(c) Extra wide breaker strip, which means better union
of tread and carcass, giving extra life and service to both.
Ample stocks of all sizes are now available also
Goodyear Laminated Tubes for every size of casing.
Ask to see them both.

The Exhibition is now a huge hospital.
From the concert platform to the dome are
lines of beds for women, and the opposite
wing is for men. The committee rooms have
been fitted with screened cubicles for the
volunteer helpers, trained and untrained, who
have rolled up in brave style. They get up on
bugle-call at six. Some of the girls
are doing nothing but mark blankets and
sheets. They sit before a cliff of folded bed-
ding. As fast as they mark them V.A.D.’s
come and take the stuff away. There is also
a batch of inquiry specialists. These wait
in the porch for the anxious and merely
curious visitor. Other girls hurry round
in the ambulances.
The Red Cross drilling has turned some
of our naicest flappers into brisk, useful
women, with a sense of time and responsi-
bility. They just had a glimpse of a pos-
sible rest from patriotics, with parties to
come, when the flumonia started them all
off again. Some help at the big hospitals,
others at the Exhibition. They “sleep-in,”
occupying little wooden cubicles with just
a bed and a chair for furniture. At first
there weren’t even mirrors. Now the most
smiling and coaling misses have huge Gov-
ernment-office mirrors with ornate frames.
One snared a Venetian glass left since the
days of antique-collector L. L. Smith, an
original trustee of the old Exhibition. The
more backward girls are peeking into two
inches of broken glass discarded from the
general loot.
At least one Melbourne landlord failed to
collect the rent the other day. It was a
six-roomed house in Hawthorn, and the back
of it was exactly three feet from the next
place. The owner was beaming on the door-
step when he was informed that there were
11 certified plague patients inside and the
authorities seemed to have forgotten them.
He broke all records to the corner.
In its report of a recent meeting of the
Melbourne Hospital committee the Argtjs
mentioned that "the committee expressed its
entire approval of the epidemic.” A very
“clubby” attitude for the committee to adopt!
Now turns out that ex-A.D.C. Walter
Barttelot was assassinated at Teheran,
where he was stationed as military attache
to the British Legation in Persia. The un-
lucky soldier and his wife word in Australia
for several years with the Denmans, and
were very popular. The other day in Lon-
don a memorial service was held at Trinity
Church, Brompton. Amongst those who
attended were the ex-G.-G. and his lady,
Captain Wilbur Wilberforce (here with
Governor Fuller), Baron and Baroness Albert
Sadoine (she was Esther McCulloch, daugh-
ter of Sam McCulloch of Woodlands), Mrs.
George Chirnside, Mr. and Mrs. ,T. A. Levy,
and many of Walter’s soldier pals.
After four years with the British Red
Cross in France, Sister Lilian Kiddle,
daughter of Robert Kiddle, is returning to
Aussie, wearing the Mons medal, which is
the honorable perk of all who served with
the Old Contemptibles ’way back in 1914.
Sister Kiddle also received a pat on the
back from Douglas Haig for her work ■on
the ambulance trains behind the fighting
line.
Writer Stella Miles Franklin’s year with
the Scottish Women’s Hospital in Macedonia
has left her a victim to malaria, and hospital
duty had to be given up. Nowadays she is
living at ’Appy ’Ampstead, on London’s out-
skirts.
A young Australian war-widow, Mrs.
Percy Murdoch Collins—Melbourne knew
her as Elinor Grice —died at Twickenham,
England, just before Christmas, aged only
24. Her husband. Major Collins, D. 5.0.,
was killed during 1917.
Dr. Mary de Garis is homeward bound
after 2J years on active service. She saw
all the trouble that was going in Macedonia
for a year and nine months, latterly as
C.M.O. of the Scottish Women’s Hospital unit,
and had the hard luck to sample the ’flu in
Rome. That was on her way to London,
and the attack took some beating off.
Sydney is soon to rob us of L. St. Clair
Grondona, who is to become secretary of the
Ma State Repatriation Branch. Before he
enlisted, Grondona, a tall, good-looking knut,
with a highly-developed taste in socks, neck-
ties and walking-sticks, was a member of the
Age literary staff.
Nancy Isaacs, associate to her father the
Judge, is handing her gown to an under-
study while she takes a trip to Europe with
sister Marjorie Cohen and her husband.
The travellers are booked to leave Sydney
in March.
The recent death, from influenza, of Dr.
Margaret Cruickshanks, of Waifnate (M. 1,.),
caused a wide sweep of regret. The large-
hearted woman wore her health to fragments
in her efforts to save life. When sh'e con-
tracted the disease there was no fighting
strength left. She and her twin sister
Elizabeth —she is a lawyer—were a brilliant
pair.
Dr. Elizabeth Sweet, who died last week
of influenza at Camberwell, sacrificed herself.
As a practitioner she offered a shining ex-
ample of energy and devotion. Though only
32 when the end came she had piled up a
handsome record outside the ordinary routine
of her family-practice, notably in the matter
of infant-salvage, and her professional repu-
tation was a most enviable one.
Died at Albury, on February 6, John Pater-
son. who first planted in his flower garden
at Billabong the pretty purple thing known
to all rural Australia as “Paterson’s Curse.”
Neighbors speak of him as a kindly, genial
old gentleman who certainly didn’t know it
was loaded. Heart failure halted him at
73. But tht Curse goes marching on.
This is a Talma
portrait of Nellie
Leach, the young
Sydney soprano who
caught the judge’s
eye as Nedda in
“Pagliacci” at the
Princess’s just before
the ’flu demon
opened his perform-
ance. Nellie is a
aative of Sydney, and
had her voice taken
to pieces and put
together again by
Marchesi, who is
mostly responsible
for the present oper-
atic structure. The
songstress, who has
done revue work
here, warbled considerably in America, where
she once appeared as Micaela in a swagger
production of “Carmen,” and was actually
packing for the U.S. once more when Frank
Rigo hollered to her to come south at once.
She accordingly hurried to Melbourne and
was making the most of an exceptional oppor-
tunity when the season had to be suspended.
The harassed legislators at Federal Parlia-
ment House are now provided with a care-
fully-tended hole for a bit of golf practice
between debates. The adjacent sward is
barbered by a gardener, and a lump of
paper is inserted into a cleft stick, pre-
sumably to shoo birds away from the sacred
spot. A couple of Senators have been fol-
lowing the violent exercise with all that
indifference to danger that the true goffer
assumes.
Last week-end the summer boarders fan-
ning themselves on verandahs in the Heales-
ville district wondered whether it wouldn’t be
better to get back to the city and chance the
crowds and the ’flu. The air was full of blue
wood-smoke, and roaring bushfires were eating
the forest practically at the back doors of
various select establishments. Lovers and
honeymooiiers couldn’t get down to the gul-
lies, because the gullies were full of flames,
and no couple, however devoted, can flirt in
Hades.
Lady Helen rested from her Red Cross
and flumonia meetings for an hour last week
to give a bite of lunch to Judge Murray,
from Papua.
Adelaide testifies: —
The estate of the late Captain Hancock, of
Moonta, has been sworn at £21,000.
An error in the casualty-lists has been responsible
for a domestic tangle. Two years ago a
girl in her early twenties heard that her husband
had been killed at the Front, and a couple of months
ago she was married again. Now comes word that
her first husband is alive at a hospital for the
insane in England.
The case for Roumania has been summed up by
Madame Murgoci in a pamphlet issued by the
Anglo-Roumanian Society. The writer is a South
Australian, and before her marriage was Agnes Kelly.
She married Dr. George Murgoci, of the Bucharest
University, some time ago, and lived in the Rou-
manian capital till the German invasion compelled
lie. - to take refuge in England.
There is trouble at Port Adelaide over the Prince
Alfred Sailors’ Home, founded in ’72. Public inter-
est and subscriptions have dwindled so badly that
there was nothing for it but to close the institution
in October last. An attempt is to be made to get
the home off the rocks.
The committee of the King Edward VII. Statue
Fund has decided to place the Peacemaker on North
Terrace in front of the Adelaide Circulating Library.
Hurtle Morphett, fourth son of the late pioneer
John, died a few days ago while on a visit to South
Aus. Most of his time was spent in the Eastern
States, especially Bananaland. He was unmarried.
Walter Torode, the Adelaide builder who was
prominent in arranging the plantation of a wattle-
grove on the South Park lands in memory of the
Landing, is promoting a memorial on the hills
close behind Adelaide. There is already on the
highest point, Mount Lofty (which Flinders saw
afar off from Kangaroo Island, and named long
before Adelaide was dreamed of), a small white
pillar, visible all over the city and the plain, and
from the Gulf. Enlarged into a granite tower
100 feet high, it would be a mighty landmark.
The pathetic cry of Abe Shannon, most popular
Of our wealthy middle-aged bachelors, from France:
“It is coming-on Christmas, and I am literally re-
duced to a shadow. They charge you 15s. here
for an old buck rabbit —and at home I am fined for
not killing them!”
’Flu is beginning to take a hand in Adelaide
shows. Not that it is bad locally, or that any per-
formers have caught it; but the Jubilee Exhibition
has been taken for use as a hospital, and the
Agricultural Society has had to give up all idea
of the projected revival of the show which brings
all up-country to town in March. Allen Doone had
the luck to be here when, the epidemic started, and
he is still playing- at the Royal, with quick
changes.
Novelist Katharine Prichard, having
finished another book, last week found time
to get married to Captain Hugo Throssell, a
big, handsome V.C. and a good fellow. The
bridegroom, son of the late George Thros-
sell, formerly Premier of W.A., did many fine
things on Gallipoli, and last year led the
10th Light Horse into Jerusalem. Katliie
(who niet her fate when engaged in journal-
ism in London) is known to the public by
her books, but her friends know her also as
an earnest, well-informed and charming girl.
The two - are honeymooning (if they have
not been forced to retreat in- the bushfires
raging in the district) at the Louis Essons’
house at Emerald, but will leave shortly for
Westralia, where the Captain owns some soil.
A recent Western District marrying was
preceded by a lively time among the wedding-
guests. On the day before the event most
of the invited parties arrived at the town-
ship nearest to the parental squattage, camp-
ing at the local pub in large numbers. One
of the arrivals was an uninvited prodigal-
relative, who had been left out of the pro-
ceedings because of his known capacity as
a joy-maker. As night fell the prodigal
started to prod the township into what he
considered the properly festive spirit, and
things soon grew warm —very warm! Every-
body was very reserved about the matter
next day.; but the prodigal relative, who duly
turned up at the breakfast, found the fatted
turkey pressed on him quite warmly by a
section of the company, while the really-well-
brought-up sulked over its lemon-squash.
A woman who .has been watching weddings
since Batman sailed up the Yarra says that
Mavis Theil-Chirnside took the award for
most self-possessed bride. As she and her
bridegroom hove in sight of the guard-of-
honor on the church steps, where a couple
of photographers waited to snap the scene,
she directed the train-bearing children, who
on the march down had become disarranged
while scattering rose-leaves.
A young Gipps-
lander, May Butler
George, has found
her footing as an
artist in London.
Miniature work was
formerly her best
card, but she now
expresses herself in
six or seven different
ipediums. Her water-
colors are strong and
original, she is a
pioneer in etching on
ivory, and also does
a lot of. work in re-
liefs, pastels and pen-
and-ink. She has ex-
hibited in the Royal
Academy, in the
Royal Scottish
Academy, the Paris Salon and the Walker
Galleries, Liverpool. Though she’s never
been to Paris, she has had a miniature hung
there, and was made a member of the Paris
Salon on the strength of it. She made her
way by good Australian energy and pluck.
Her dad is Butler George, who, as a Gornish
youth, was a pioneer in Gippsland. He
settled in the big timber of the Drouin and
Warragul district and made roads for him-
self and his teams. Daughter May is pic-
tured here in her Court presentation
feathers. She was the first Australian
woman to be “presented” on her rank as an
artist.
To Dr. and Mrs. Ted Allan, a son. The
doctor is a brother of the musical Allans, and
this is the first call of the stork after a dozen
or so years of matrimony.
A _ former Board of Health official, Dr.
William Reid, who belonged to a family
associated with the remoter pioneering days
of Gippsland. is dead at Sale, where he
practised of late years in succession to his
father, the late Dr. James Reid.
St. Kilda advertised last week inviting
tenders for the purchase and removal of the
“Old Ladies’ Baths’’ on the foreshore. You
see, everybody at St. Kilda bathes on the
open beach these days.
Troops returning by the Port Hacking on
Foundation Day, harassed by quarantine re-
strictions, were wild as they came up the
bay to Port Melbourne. Passing the out-
ward-bound Marathon, they spotted the Min-
ister and greeted him with a war-cry invented
on board and known as the “Hacking Cough,”
following it with such little efforts as “Good
(something) bye, you” (line interrupted).
Pearce maintained a dignified silence. With
the whole shipload yelling at him there
was nothing else to do.
Singer Gertrude Johnson, w 7 ho made such
an excellent impression as Gilda in the Rigo
production of “Rigoletto,” is among the ’flu
victims, but latest communiques indicate
satisfactory progress.
Poor Howard White wanted to be a law-
yer and enjoy the almost holy grandeur
which surrounds the Law in Boston sassiety.
But the feet that dusted themselves on his
doormat' were few and inexpensive, so he
turned sadly to music and found there was
a growing market for a big, boisterous
baritone. His charming young widow is a
dazzling frocker, and White was once reck-
lessly charged by their press-agent with in-
venting the dresses. Pressed privately on
the point lie denied the awful impeachment.
“To tell you the truth, old man,” he whis-
pered, “I haven’t got the nerve.”
Back from the jaws of death, David
Barker, well-remembered Melbourne artist,
the man who edited the “Anzac Book.” He’s
a living proof of the fact that you can’t
believe all you read. His death was as
plain as print; the publication of the Yic.
Artists’ Society gave a column to the
sterling virtues of the late lamented. And
in defiance of all this David came marching
home again, hurrah, hurrah. Confronted
with the evidence of his decease, he declares
it to be a printer’s error. You can always
blame the printer.
Sculptor Douglas Richardson has com-
pleted his design for a medal, ordered by
the Federal Government, to be distributed
to young Australia when peace is signed.
Richardson has got right away from the
conventional “Advance Australia” design.
The obverse shows Peace, flanked by
awakened Industry and War, chained and
with its sword broken. The reverse depicts
the Billjim and Billjack who helped on the
good work.
Edward Yidler, the Melbourne publisher,
has discovered a -way to reduc; the high cost
of etchings to the connoisseur. Vidler has
induced etcher John Shirlow to make his
best performances available in folios of about
half-a-dozen examples, each set going for a
price which would ordinarily secure one very
moderate print at a Shirlow exhibition. The
first folio, bound handsomely in fawn and
gold, gives the cream of the artist’s memories
of Sydney, gathered during his visit in
1917-18. Views of the Harbor from Brad-
ley’s Head and Taronga Park, and little
pieces of George and Bond streets, with the
characteristic clumps of rich foreground
shadows and the shimmering sunlit buildings
clambering upward to the skies behind, are
the chief treasures of the collection, and are
all executed with a needle that always knows
when it h, s said enough. This edition is
limited to 55 numbered copies, so the pub-
lisher and etcher can’t derive a large for-
tune when the printer and binder have had
their share.
Genevieve Ward, in her book of reminis-
cences, refers to Melbourne reciter and elo-
cutionist Nelly Veitch. Nelly, she says,
was the daughter of a miner from Ballarat
and a school teacher of Scottish descent. She
came to Melbourne with the idea of giving
recitals. Lady Loch, wife of the then Gov-
ernor of Victoria, and Bishop Moorhouse
both barracked for her, and Genevieve took the
young performer o_n tour to Maoriland. At
Wellington the actress who played Queen
Ann and Mrs. Foley in “Forget-me-not” and
other middle-aged parts, played up and was
sacked. Nelly took over the job and made
a success of the tour. She shortly after-
wards gave up the regular stage and began
teaching elocution and physical culture. She
is still at it in Melbourne, while Genevieve
Ward acts on in London at 80-odd.
Lorna Valare, a young Australian born in
South Yarra, is a big hit in New York at
present. She plays a child part in Belasco’s
new production called “Daddies.” The play
is written around four hardened old bachel-
ors, who have been lured into becoming war-
daddies, each making himself responsible for
a lonely war-orphan. Lorna’s father was a
piano-tuner in Melbourne a few years ago.
While tuning a piano-player he got an idea
for some new principle. That inspiration
lifted him to a good job in New York at the
headquarters of this particular instrument
and Lorna (aged three) went with him. The
vivacious youngster started with the movies
and was discovered by Belasco.

MAGNESIA HELPS DYSPEPTICS.
RENDERS DIETING AND DRUGGING
UNNECESSARY.
Many dyspeptics have now discontinued
the use of expensive patent foods, harmful
drugs, medicines and artful digestants, and
instead, following the advice often given in
these columns, they just take half-a-tea-
spoonful of bisnrated magnesia in a little
water after meals, with the result that they
not only save money, but enjoy much better
health. Those who have once tried bisnrated
magnesia never dread the approach of meal
times, because they know that this excellent
antacid and food corrective, which _ can so
readily be obtained from any chemist, will
quickly neutralise acidity and prevent the
possibility of food fermenting in the stomach.
Try this plan yourself, but mind you get
the bisnrated magnesia as other forms are
often quite unsuitable. — Advt.

This page, commenting recently on the
arbitrary powers wielded by racing clubs, mentioned
Graggs’s case. It was a particularly hard one.
Graggs was riding Goonangledene at Randwick in
the hurdle event in which Greek Fire was so badly
injured that he had to be shot. Certain stipen-
diaries put the accident down to careless riding on
the part of Craggs and he was “warned off ’ for
six months. .'.gainst him is the opinion of the
stipes, based on what they thought they saw —a
frail reed this on which to repose much weight, as
has been recently demonstrated. In his favor are
his own assurar 'hat he was nowhere near Greek
Fire when tb . :ity occurred, and a lot of
circumstantial evidence to support that claim. The
trouble happened at the first hurdle. It is admit-
ted- that Craggs on Goonangledene drew the out-
side position, and that Greek Fire was on the
rails. Therefore to get at the doomed prad Craggs
would have had first to cross the whole field, and
then drop back. No one seems to have seen the
bizarre manoeuvre executed. If, on the other hand,
it had occurred, is there any seeing human being
on the course who could have missed it ? It may
be that the stipes, mixed up Goonangledene (ail
brown) with Basil K. (brown tartan with brown
sleeves). Anyhow, there is an element of doubt
that would have saved Craggs before a court of
law. Yet a more or less irresponsible racecourse
junta can deprive him of his only means of liveli-
hood, on such an issue, for six months —or if they
had felt like it, for life. The power is too great.
The matter of penalties is a mixed one
in Australia. In N. S. Wales until quite recently
any horse that won the most miserable of handicaps
at meetings held shortly before the Epsom or
Doncaster or Sydney Cup was penalised 71b. It is
a platitude that horses complete their training on
the racecourse —they “race themselves into condi-
tion,” as the saying goes. What, for years, was the
effect of the old system in N. S. Wales? Simply
that those horses which were fancied by their con-
nections for the more valuable races were not
allowed to try in the minor events. The sufferers
were the public. The A..J.C. changed all that by
imposing a penalty for the Metrop only where a
horse won an Epsom, and for the Sydney Cup if a
horse won the Doncaster.
In Victoria there has been no alteration. Any
horse that, within two months of a Melbourne Cup,
wins an event worth from £5OO to £lOOO puts up
71b. in the big race; if he wins an event worth more
than £lOOO he is loaded with an extra 101 b. There
are two exceptions. The Hotham Handicap and the
Coburg Stakes can be won without a penalty. Why?
Because they are run the day before the Cup. It is
the V.R.C.’s tacit admission that horses often need
a “winding-up gallop” on the course in company;
and that the elimination of penalties is the only way
to ensure genuine racing in the particular circum-
stances. If the V.R.C. exercised the same horse-
sense in this matter as the A.J.C., no Melbourne Cup
runners would be penalised unless they won an
Epsom, a Metrop or a Caulfield Cup.
Desert Gold (Bst. 111 b.) beat Gloaming
(9st.) in M.L. last week over six furlongs. The
mare won by half a length.
F. McCabe, formerly one of Australia s
best eross-countrv riders, and of late years a mem-
ber of the A.1.F., rode the winner of the Gatwick
Steeplechase last week. It is one of the big jump-
ing events of the year in England, and any jockey
who wins it has the chance of a good ride in the
National.
A jockey won a race in Queensland the
other day by a device as ingenious as it was cruel.
He had an electrical machine tied to his waist and
wires running down to his spurs. When he inserted
the hooks the circuit was completed, and the
horrified animal went mad. The unearthly buzzing
of the instrument as the horse and its cargo fled
down the wind attracted the attention of' the on-
lookers, and the rider was seized and interrogated.
Last week a magistrate handed him a £lO fine.
Talking of cruelty to animals, something should
be done for the unhappy draught horse —light as
well as heavy—in the present transition period be-
tween the complete departure of the horse and the
full arrival of the motor for transport work. The
more motors that appear the smoother the road sur-
faces in the big cities naturally get. There are
already miles of streets —more particularly in Mel-
bourne —which are as slippery as glass. It is a de-
pressing sight to see willing horses trying to dig
their toes into such surfaces, as a means of getting
a purchase, and so shifting the loads behind them.
It is almost as heart-breaking to a decent driver as
it is to the animals concerned. One possibility
is the retention for the present of a strip at
the side of all roadways for horse-drawn traffic only.
St. Mira had a hard time before she
secured the Aspendale Welter Plate. It is not often
that a horse traverses the course three times to
win an event, but that was the case in this instance.
Coming up the straight the Maoriland mare Lingerie
and St. Mira left the others, and the judge was
unable to separate the pair. A run-off was decided
upon. Before starting this St. Mira got rid of
her rider (G. Harrison), and bolted. Lingerie was
favorite in the first instance and she looked a cer-
tainty after the other’s caper; but St. Mira com-
fortably defeated the Maorilander.
A breath from the past blew oyer Mel-
bourne last, week when a bank-teller named Har-
rington was lined up at the Court of General
Sessions. He had been given £lOO to back King
Offa for the last Caulfield Cup. Seeing the animal
walking about dead lame the day before the
race, he decided to lay the odds himself. It
probably looked to him just as good a bet next
day when the horse was still very lame. Of
course the brute won. Harrington settled with the
bank’s funds, and went for a “get-back” on Lingle
in the Melbourne Cup to the extent of £3OO. His
crowning insanity was to put £5OO on the favorite
for the Williamstown Cup—a unique example of
Little Eric defying the Ring. It would have been
odd indeed had his fancy scored. Its stable
companion won instead, and the unhappy youth is
“for it” in consequence.
King Offa’s lameness on this occasion deceived
many more experienced racegoers than Harrington.
One punter, who was heavily interested in his
success, murmured something about trying a squirt
of cocaine. It wasn’t done, the present regulations
concerning doping' being Medic, even Persian, in
their flavor. Yet this looked a case, if ever there
was one, when the application of a local anaesthetic
might have been- justifiable. Another was the
occasion on which The Parisian came out for the
Sydney Cup with a bad foot. A mild injection of
any one of a number of drugs would have done
him no permanent harm, and it would have rend-
ered him as sound as a bell for the period of the
race.
Not that doping is unknown on Australian race-
courses. The position is far otherwise. The temptation
is too great. With sufficient stimulation a horse can
be made to do incredible things ; ju(;t as tho
S’American natives who chew the cocaine leaf, and
the inhabitants of Styria who think nothing of
absorbing 15 to 20 grains of arsenic at a time, are
aide to do incredible feats of strength—for a while.
The end is the same in horses as in human beings.
The first thing noticeable about the horse is that
only one trainer can get any good out of him.
That is of course the trainer who knows that
the horse needs a dope, and what dope, and how
much.. And, inevitably, the time arrives when no
one can do anything with the equine ruin. The
drugs in use differ widely. It has been said of
one eminent trainer that wherever his horses go
the fowls all die. This particular sportsman em-
ploys arsenic, which, besides giving great staying-
power, for the time being, adds a wonderful satin-
like sheen to the coat.

“Pungawerewere” : The death in M.L. of
Fred Yonge, who in his day was one of the best
amateur horsemen in that country, brings back
the great race he rode in the ’eighties in the
Pakuranga Hunt Club steeplechase at Ellerslie
(Auckland), when King Don won a narrow victory
from, Sunray. Yonge rode Sunray, and T. Halstead
was aboard King Don ; and both horses kept to-
gether over the stiff steeplechase course for nearly
the whole distance. King Don just outstayed Sun-
ray in a magnificent finish. Yonge rode Hawthorn
when he won the race two years later. He steered
the late Robert Garrett’s horse Torpedo to victory
in the Pakuranga Hunt Club’s Cup in 1887, and
was able to count many other successes as an
amateur rider over hurdles and on the flat. Latterly
he was secretary of the Otahuhu Trotting Club.
South Aus. owners are complaining that
Tattersall’s Club has a good thing on. At the meet-
ing held by the club on February 1 at Victoria
Park there were six races, value of stakes £BlO
(exclusive of sweepstake in Trial). Owners pro-
vided £249 in nominations and acceptances, and
the Club got £921 from the tote. Owners want
to know if the profits are spent in the interests of
racing. The public pays on race days to see the
sport, but owners have to hand out every day,
and hint that it is time they had a chance to
earn oats. A couple of races added to the pro-
gramme and a minimum stake of £2OO for each
race are two suggestions.
The advantage of a holiday, even a com-
pulsory one, is shown by St. Leocadia (by St.
Anton from the M.L. mare Clochette), owned by
Dr. Bennett, of Adelaide. The gelding ran off
in a race as a three-year-old, cannoned into a
fence, and was knocked out. Now, carefully
handled, he has come out as a five-year-old, and
von two races at Victoria Park (Adelaide) in one
alternoon. In the second, he equalled the S.A.
five-furlong record —1 minute dead.
“Yarra Ben”: At Aspendale (Vic.) last
week a masked punter attempted to back a moke
while the race was in progress. He shouted to a
bookie in his neighborhood, but the fielder could or
would not hear. The backer, after several ineffec-
tual attempts to make himself understood, pulled
off his mask and skied it in disgust. By the time
he had made known his requirements to McShortodds
his fancy had passed the post a winner. Then he
was disgusted some more.

There was a comic-opera sort of race at
Clare (S.A.) lately. It was for maidens, and the
top weight had to be 9st. He was; but one
minute before starting-time someone remembered
that he had once won a trifle, and he was removed,
his trainer being then fined for letting him go out at
all. After the other four starters had got home,
someone remembered that without him the 9st„
condition had been defied. The decision was No
Race. Then, the next-highest weight in sight
being 161 b. lower, that weight was added to all
parties, and they were told to run it over again.
Two declined, but the original first and second
battled it out and finished in the same order.
Then backers got a surprise. All money in the
tote on the unqualified one had been returned to
backers; so had all on the two who declined the
second race. When the machine’s commission had
been deducted, backers of the winner got a guinea
for their £.

Port Pirie (South Aus.) has a zealous
policeman. Hearing voices about midnight in a
private room in the Central Hotel he went upstairs
to investigate and found half a dozen of the town’s
leading citizens, including H. Jackson (ex-Minister
of Works) playing poker. John watched the game
for about five minutes. The players took no notice,
as, the majority of them being boarders, they looked
upon the hotel as their home. Then the constable
played his hand. “This is a nice state of affairs,
gentlemen,” he said, and dumfounded them by pro-
ducing a revolver, and remarking “Don’t touch any of
that money. I want your names.” The six were
later on brought before the Magistrates’ Court and
charged with a breach of the Gaming and Lottery
Act,, and each had to pay a fine of £5 and £1
costs, so , the Government' will have the best win on
the night’s play.

A great wicket-keeper is Hansen Carter
(Wavcrley). On Saturday he contributed only four
byes to Balmain’s 390, and he caught one and
stumped one. This season, of 2643 runs scored
against his suburb, he has given away only 56 ;
and he has caught 10 and stumped four —a return to
his Australian XI form of 1902 and 1909.

Canterbury’s re-winning of the Ranfurly
Shield from Wellington was one of the biggest boil-
overs. in M.L. cricket. Wellington began with 323.
against Canterbury’s 188 ; but the holders crumbled
to the tune of 163 in the second innings, and Canter-
bury followed with 303 for three.
The bowling “find” of Queensland cricket
this season is the tall left-hander, P. Hornibrook
(Kalinga). Against the State Insurance team he
took all 10 wickets in an innings 'for 30 runs, and
for Brisbane v. Toowoomba he began the play
by clean-bowling Kent and Drews with successive
balls. Wicket-keeper Farquhar (Goodna) is also
making a noise near the Equator. In successive
innings he banged 104 (v. Pay Corps) and 100 ( v.
Returned Soldiers).
Grey-haired Peter McAlister (East Mel-
bourne) scandalised Richmond last week by belting
them for 120 not out. Ten years ago he was “old
Peter,” and when he t-ripped with Noble’s 1<309
team he was labelled a “passenger”—yet his batting
average was 29.4. His biggest whack in first-class
cricket was 224 for Vic. v. M.L. in 1899.
Sydney premiership cricket on Saturday
had an exhilarating punch. Although. only three
centuries went up .2077 runs were scored for 79
wickets. The bowling stars were Bosward, of Pad-
dington (seven for 31), and Lawes (’Varsity), who
got seven for 47. Lawes’s effort in clean bowling
six of his victims was a pleasing change from the
funereal policy of bowling off the wicket.
Half the trouble on the home-coming trans-
ports arises directly from boredom. Boredom, and
liver. It is not the invalids who create the disturb-
ances in the vast majority of cases. It is the men
who have practically completed their convalescence,
or the type of “smart young Anzac” who, on being
asked by the N. S. Wales State Commandant why he'
had bolted from the Argyllshire, said that he
“wanted a surf at Bondi.” These lads have led an
active life for years. During much of the time they
have been in hard training. Is it surprising that
after eight or 10 weeks on a transport—during which
time they have sat, slept and eaten on a troop-deck
when they weren’t sitting, sleeping or eating on a
spar-deck—that they should get above themselves?
The writer returned on a small and crowded ship.
Yet it was not so crowded as to make deck-cricket
impossible, if the ship’s people had been willing. In
point of fact, they weren’t. It would have caused
them a little trouble; and there is no blinking the
fact that the average British carrier or transport
crew, from the master downwards, is not what could
be called infatuated with the Digger. The skipper
and his officers refuse to put themselves out for
Billjim, whom they mostly regard as an arrogant
and over-sized person devoid of that proper respect
for his betters which inpels a man to take all that
is offered without complaint.
On the writer's carrier there was, during the
whole of every day, at least one deck that could
have been used for cricket. That is to say, there
was always one deck so unfrequented that it could
have been netted and handed over to a party of 20
or 30 men without inconvenience to anyone. With
a relay system of matches, starting after “inspec-
tion,” all those men capable of taking violent exer-
cise could have had it. Deck cricket is the best sea-
game yet evolved ; and no liner which carries Brit-
ishers can afford to be without it. Colonel Gordon
Craig,- when in charge of the crowded hospital-ship
Karoola, organised matches daily, officers and men
playing together. What was possible on the little
Karoola would be easy on the big vessels now jour-
neying Australia-wards. It is a matter for amicable
arrangement, in each case, between the C.O. troops
and the captain of the ship. It would be well worth
while, 'there are few things more difficult to handle
than a home-bound expeditionary with a congested
liver.

Australian speed maniacs have put up
quite a lot of alleged world’s records lately on
motor-bikes. But none of the times would be recog-
nised by the International Records Association, which
stipulates that all straightaway speed performances
must be ridden or driven in both directions within
a given time, anti the mean time taken.

Less than 20 years ago a motor-ear was
odd enough to thaw a crowd, and now a: member
has raced up to the opening of Parliament in
England on a motor-scooter.
A. A. Baynes (Commercial Rowing
Club), winner of the Q, champion sculls (2i
miles) last week, was coached by George Towns,
who happened to be holidaying up North at the time.
Baynes is an 11-stoner, who just previously had won
the Brisbane River championship.
Efforts are being made to renew interest in
biff in Adelaide, and a series of weekly tourna-
ments are being conducted in the King’s Theatre.
The - other night, however, the contests were too
sudden to suit the spectators. Three of the “mills”
ended in the second round. The big event was a
fight between South Aus. champion Ern Waddy and
Jim Jackson, “who has figured in fights throughout
Australia.” Waddy list. 121 b. and his opponent 21b.
lighter. Waddy was so attentive to Jackson’s person
that he had him very groggy in the first round,
and in the second a faw smashing blows from the
champion prompted referee Harry Daniels to save
a massacre. Now Waddy wants to meet anyone
in the State who reckons he has the goods. Jackson
is a fireman, and the big blaze at Burford’s had
given him a hard time all the previous night.

Eddie McGoorty—now a sergeant—was
beaten in London on points last month by Wells —
still a bombardier. McGoorty is one of the many
who have been ruined by one good hiding. He
never recovered from Les Darcy’s attentions to him.
From his first defeat by Darcy McGoorty dropped
his most priceless possession overboard —that serene
confidence which gives a fighter “speed.” McGoorty
robbed Dave Smith of it with a single left hook.
Burns removed it from Squires, and Johnson from
Burns. It is as important an asset to a pug as
virtue is to a woman, and quite as difficult to
retain for any length of time.
Fishing remains a legitimate sport-—even
in N. S. Wales. It is curious that more people, with
time on their hands and a little spare cash, don’t
take to it. A fair-sized catch of red-fish, plus sun-
dries, is a certainty for any party that goes “out-
side,” always provided the tackle is suitable. The
good old days when snapper could be hauled aboard
at the end of articles like clothes-lines have vanished.
The newest lines are almost as fine as Hercules
casts, and they are so camouflaged that the wariest
deep-sea fish is deceived. They are expensive. On
the other hand they last well, if looked after; and
most men take care of a costly line where they would
leave the other sort in the boatshed to save the
trouble of carrying it home.
Boats are cheap just now —more particularly in
Sydney. An average party of six to a dozen men
could get a well-found sailing-craft on any given
day for rather less than they would have spent
during the daylight hours per head in refreshment
before the pubs closed down. There are grounds
which are still good handy to the Heads; and the
“marks” are as well known to most members of the
boat-letting profession as Pinchgut. For those who
can run to motor-boats the Narrabeen reef and on
to Barrenjoey is fair ; and the “Reef Wide,” several
miles out, is considerably better. If ever there was
a time when deep-sea fishing for amateurs should
boom it is now.
Is this the catch of the season? At
Whakatane (M.L.) a couple of fishermen landed a
shark 28ft. 6in. long. The jaw was 2ft. lOin. from
side to side.
“Barb”: A knight fish was coaxed on
board one of the N. S. Wales trawlers recently.
His visiting-card was inscribed Monocentus gloria
maris, but they call him the knight fish because of
his scales, which are fashioned like the armor-plates
the knights of old went lumbering around in look-
ing for stoush and maidens who had been abducted
by dragons without their parents’ consent. As
further protection the marine knight is fitted with
enormous spikes, which he can set at right angles
to the body and lock in that position. On each
side of the mouth are two glctbes, as it were, from
which shines a bright, greenish light. I don’t
know whether you can eat him, but I wouldn’t
like to tackle him raw.
“Melaleuca” : The Speck is suffering from
an invasion of cormorants. They are of the large
black kind known as Phalacocorax carbo. Swarming
around the coasts they are bad enough, but when
they come inland by the thousand the angling
community starts to raise Cain. The birds can be
found around any little mudhole in the island, and
the rivers and creeks are patrolled by droves.
Inland waters are being denuded of the carefully-
conserved salmon and trout, and the Fisheries Com-
missioners are just about at the end of their
tether both as regards ideas for getting rid of the
pest and as regards the necessary money with which
to pay 6d. a head for each bird shot. About a
quarter of a century ago we had an invasion,
but even the oldest inhabitant agrees that the present
influx takes the cake.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Windeyer, the Mayor of Hunter s Hill
(Sydney), appeared to-day wearing a mask so large
that it almost enveloped his entire face.
“I must apologise,” said Mr. Windeyer, “for wear-
ing this mask in court.”
“I congratulate you, Mr. Windeyer!” replied the
magistrate.
“Masks,” added Mr. Windeyer, “are very diffi-
cult to purchase, but I was determined to have one,
so I tote up one of my wife's window-blinds,
machined it myself, and made this mask. I don’t
know what my wife will say about the window-
blind on her return from her holiday, but 1 didnt
want Hunter’s Hill to be behind.”-— Daily paper.
The morning was as fair as man might ask,
Yet in his home, ’mid summonses and writs,
His Worship sat and tore a blind to bits.
His aim? The latest game—Ads. and the Mask.
It w r as his wife’s best blind. He did not care,
But pushed it briskly into the machine:
He used the blind though soft-goods might be seen
(Napkins and handkerchiefs and such-like) ev’rywhere.
The shining harbor beckoned, and the surf.
All, all in vain—l;hey seemed but to imbue
His legs with strength. Musing, he saw the ’flu
Struck off the rolls, unfrocked, warned off the turf.
Also he saw himself —his face obscured
Behind a mask extensive as a ’bus,
Yet by that fact made more conspicuous:
The vision stimulated, thrilled, allured.
Stern duty done, still spurning rest or sport,
He grabs his spouse's mutilated blind,
Pushes his face inside and starts to find
Some well-filled and appreciative Court.
The Court succumbs to the ex-curtain’s spell,
And causes warm encomiums to revolve
Round this, the first of Mayors to evolve,
An influenza mask and ad. as well.

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 30/=
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
HPHE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
■*- for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia.
We quote our “L.S.” Special Julhpores in Military
Drills at 30/= tailor-made to order. Other materials are
obtainable up to £4.
SAMPLES ARE POST FREE
with tape, self-measurement form, copy of catalogue, etc. We

Dr. George Newton Swinson, who has
just died at Manildra (N.S.W.) aged 86,
worked under an English R.C.S. diploma
dated 1855. That looks like the oldest in N.
S. Wales.
A S. Australian police-court has taken a
commonsense view about the Nuriootpa
(S.A.) girl who shot her father dead with
a revolver. The coroner’s jury called it
justifiable, but the Crowm set the matter
down for further consideration. It was
shown that deceased , was a powerful man. of
violent temper, whose favorite threat was
to shoot the whole family, and on this
occasion he had taken up cartridges and was
looking for a gun when his daughter fired. The
S.M. was “convinced that it would be a
shameful waste of public money to send the
girl for trial, as there could be only One
result, an acquittal,” and the case was dis-
missed.

NEW SERIES 19 MODELS—
The Lig'ht Four The Lig'ht Six The Big' Six.
The Quality Cars for Australian Demands and Conditions.
OR sixty-five years the name of Studebaker has stood for excellence in vehicle manufacture.
In six of the world’s greatest wars, in Europe, America, and South Africa, in the hardest
kind of service Studebaker waggons and cars have established an unexcelled reputation
for sturdy construction and absolute dependability.
Studebaker cars are an evolution —a perfect piece of mechanism. Year by year Studebaker have incorporated in their models tlie
actual proved demands of their customers ; they have conferred with and materialized the advice of their most expert dealers until
now these present models are the up-to-the-moment link in the chain of scientific design and absolute integrity of construction and
distribution that maintains for Studebaker cars the first place among quality products.
You can be proud of a Studebaker for its appearance, comfort, and performance.
The famous L head engine is accessible, noiseless, flexible, and vibrationless. It is fitted with magneto ignition additional to the
separate lighting and starting units, and has the Zenith or Ball & Ball carburretter.
The gear-box swung amidships on a specially designed sub-chassis conveys an unmistakable impression of mechanical perfection.
The flexible, silent, Hotchkiss drive through the newly designed spiral bevel differential in conjunction with the double thermoid
coupling forward is instantaneous in the “ take-up ” under any road conditions.
The scientific weight distribution of the chassis, combined with the length of wheel base, and the particular resilience of the spring
suspension gives the acme of comfort all times.
The body lines and luxurious appointments are elegance “in excelsis.”
Five Goodyear tyres and quick change spare rim are supplied with each model.

“Ingelara”: In future the Speck is going
to keep hope alive for the defeated candi-
date. According to the new electoral laws he
may consider himself a possibility right up
to the time of the next election even though
he loses his deposit. If the sitting member
dies or resigns his seat, instead of a by-
election being held, the old votes are gone
through and the second on the list is duly
elected. An interesting case is the election
of O’Connell to succeed Mulcahy, resigned,
as member for the Wiimol; district. In the
1916 election, on which this election was
judged, O’Connell lost his £25 deposit. If
the system were adopted in the Federal
Parliament Vida Goldstein might gain a seat
some time.
Britain has only lately learnt, how little
stood between her and the capture of the
Dardanelles in 1916. The day after the
disastrous naval attack when the Bouvet,
Ocean and Irresistible were sunk, Abdul was
so overjoyed by his victory that he was pre-
paring to pack up and bolt into the interior.
Actually Djemal Pasha, the Minister of
Marine, had said farewell to his colleagues
and had taken his ticket for a remote por-
tion of Syria, where he had arranged to
set up a miniature principality with a well-
stocked harem and a few other creature
comforts. Talaat Bey, next to Enver Pasha
in point of wickedness, also had two fast
automobiles packed with loot at Haidar
Pasha, on the Bosphorus, and was bound for
an address in Anatolia. The cause of this
sudden anxiety was the exhaustion of big-
gun ammunition in the Dardanelles forts
without any immediate prospect of obtaining
further supplies direct from Germany. At
that time Serbia was still intact, blocking
the route via Belgrade and Sofia, and Rou-
mania was strictly observing her neutrality.
On March 19, 1916, Mamidie, the most
powerful fort on the Asiatic side of the Dar-
danelles, had just 17 armor-piercing shells;
Kilid-ul-Bahr on the European side con-
fessed to owning 10. Other forts and bat-
teries were even worse off, and many of
them were armed with Krupp guns of the
1878 pattern, while some were muzzle-
loaders dating back to 1835! Evidently
Winston Churchill had some inkling of the
position when he declared about this time
that Britain was nearer Constantinople than
most people thought. “Most people,” how-
ever, laughed loudly at Winston, but Talaat
and his brother miscreants knew that the
Englishman was right.

Healed By Cetera
Of Skin Trouble* Burning All the
Time* Thought Would Have
to Cut Fingers at First Joint*
“My little baby was troubled for
nine months with a nasty skin com-
plaint. The fingers on each
of her hands got very red
down to the first joint and
then under the nails. They
were burning all the time
and very sore to touch.
It then started on her little
feet. I thought she would
have to have her fingers off at the first
joint as I was told they would never
get better.
“I sent for a sample of Cuticura Soap
and Ointment which gave her relief so I
bought more and she was healed.”

William Kendall, of the Royal College of
Yets., advocates the breeding of mules in Australia,
to take the place of “the thousands of weeds and
screws” now raised here. Kendall is in a favorable
position to talk. Apart from his own experience,
he has a bunch of sons who are vets., and one of
them is Lieut.-Col. Kendall, deputy director of vet.
service with the A.I.P. in Palestine. Kendall, sen.,
points out that the mule, being infertile, “cannot
transmit any defect he may inherit or acquire,” and
he suggests that stud jacks and jennets should be
imported from the U.S. by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment and the industry thus started on sound
lines. The mule has been employed for generations
all up and down the U.S. He outlasts three horsrs,
starts work sooner in life, and is a whale for wo k.
There are quite a lot of him here already—out beyr nd
Port Augusta, for instance, and in the backblockr of
N.Q. —but Kendall’s scheme aims at getting not
merely quantity but quality.
For hard work under active-service conditions the
U.S. and Argentina- mule proved priceless. He was
used for light transport work of all descriptions—
chiefly for carrying ammunition and stores up to the
front line. Paradoxical though it may sound, the
mule is one of the brainiest animals living. He has
so much intelligence that he will neither knock him-
self about nor let anyone else do it. A well-bred
horse will gallop till he drops. A mule won’t gallop
at all, and he even jibs at fast movement of any
sort on a hard or bad road. But he will work all
day at his own pace. He is an eminent judge of a
fair thing, in the matter of toil, which is one reason
why, despite the straightness of his shoulders and
pasterns, his legs remain sound to the end. His
strength and fitness are proverbial. The writer,
marvelling at it, formed a theory that it was due to
his tremendous depth through the barrel. A 15-hand
mule will often be found with the “depth through”
of a 16-hand draught horse. Another good point
about the mule is that he will eat, and thrive upon,
anything. As against this he is fastidious about
what he drinks, which might be awkward in parts
of Australia. He has, of course, a huge head and
no length of rein—-two things which put him out of
court for speedy hack work. But selected teams of
mules jumped like stags in the hands of Australians
in France, and they were very comfortable short-
distance rides. Incidentally, these same animals
had been in the line with the Australians from , the
beginning.
There is a fallacious idea abroad about the mule’s
fractiousness. If decently treated he is the most
docile of animals. A good driver in the A.I.F. would
have his “donlcs” following him about like dogs, and
cases of men being kicked were rare indeed. Finally,
the mule can be a remarkably handsome animal.
The writer has seen magnificent, upstanding mules of
10 hands and over, with skins as fine as Biplane’s,
short backs, big quarters, and powerful shoulders —
as good-looking "as any horse, barring their heads. It
is a certainty that if the Australian Government
adopts Mr. Kendall’s scheme it will have at least
one solid body of opinion behind it —the opinion, that
is, of those Australians who have been handling
mules in France, Palestine and Egypt.
Just dead at Aldgate (S.A.), Harry J.
Buik. He was the mile champion of S.A. in 1895,
in which year he pedalled for his State in the Aus-
tralian championships against Zimmermann. And he
was only 47 when he passed out!

“Bridoon”: An autobiography is pub-
lished by Tod Sloan. His dad called him “Toad,”
because so tiny, and it shortened into “Tod.” He
had a strange aversion to horses, and determined he
would have nothing to do with them, although his
elder brother was in a racing stable. At 13 Tod
became assistant to a balloonist. This ended
because he was asked to come down in a parachute.
He then joined his brother at the stable, where his
nervous attempts to ride were so bad that they made
him cook. Removing to ,another, stable he accident-
ally won a race. A horse threw him out of the
saddle, forward upon its shoulders,- -which he clutched.
Thus, so he says, he discovered the “monkey-on-a-
stick” trick, with which he was so successful that
other jockeys lost races watching him do it.
“Sarto” : The revival of cricket has turned
out to be the same old dreariness, perforated with
adjournments. Runs will have to be made at a
greater rate than one in every two or five minutes, and
the waits cut out alt&gether, if the game is to sur-
vive. If cricket magnates don’t like the . idea of
stimulating fast scoring by imposing a time limit
on batsmen, I’ve got another idea. Let the bowler
be supplied with eight balls (the umpire could take
charge of them) and if a fieldsman fail to stop a ball
four runs shall accrue. The next ball could then
be bowled without waiting, and so on. Of course if
the ball is fielded it could be returned and the
umpire take charge of it and hand the bowler an
unbowled ball. This would also assist the umpire
in his count. The chances of being run out might
be lessened, but this is a rotten way of getting out
in any case. All outlying balls 'could easily be
collected in the interval of changing overs. If this
won’t suit either, I suggest we try cricket by post.

“Dial-sight”: St. Kilda Yacht Club (Vic.)
recently acquired one of the barges used by the
Aussies in the Landing. It was brought on a trans-
port to Melbourne, and, as war accessories are likely
to become a glut on the market before long, was
bought cheap. It is a squat-looking, weatherbeaten
craft, about 30ft. long, with a beam of 15ft., and
capable of carrying about a platoon of men. The
yachtsmen intend using it for picking up moorings.

“Nitram”: Inform “Nor’-west” (B.
16/1/’l9 that I have caught rock-cod in the
Pioneer River (Q.), though I quite agree with him
that there are none in the western N. S. Wales
rivers. The largest I have seen weighed 341 b., but
some of the old hands will take a Bible oath on cod
781 b. to 1501 b. in weight. Also, where has “Nor’-
West” been on the Severn that he never saw cat-
fish or perch in its waters. I can produce, if neces-
sary, three J.’s.P., one policeman, various navvies
and several assorted “travellers,” who will swear that
these fish are to be caught anywhere from the river’s
junction with the Mclntyre up. I have caught
yellow-belly (golden perch), silver perch and cat-
fish (or, as known locally, jewfish) at Currumbel on
the Severn, and again at Texas, so that they must
be well distributed. The silver perch in this water
in invariably about lib. weight, but in the
Mclntyre tfjey are like plugs of tobacco —eight to
the pound.

Lieut. Bolton, an Anzac just returned to
Melbourne, is working on an invention—a carbur-
etter for the use of crude oil in motor-traction. He
is an inventive youth. In 1907 he built a light
glider, controlled by levers which swooped down
slopes at dazzling speed and returned to earth on
curved “bouncers.” It didn’t glide him into the
next world, and he has seen a lot of advanced avia-
tion since then.
“Mulruana” : “G.N.” (B.* 9/1/T9) *growls
at “Machete” (B. 19/12/’ 18) for “running late
with his new style of two-up,” and then butts in
with hit s “latest style”—the three pennies. Our
oldest inhabitant remembers plaving “G.N.’s” latest
with his grandfather. In 1830 they called it “Sudden
Death.”

“Golightly”: Is the black shag that now
infests the trout streams of Southern N. S. Wales
one and the same with the black shag that sits
on beach and breaker from Eden to Sydney? If
so it is goodnight rainbow trout, for" this fowl
is cleaning up the trout waters of the Murrum-
bidgee and Snowy Rivers in no uncertain manner.
Streams that were teeming with young trout last
year appear this year to have only the large fish
left.

Could any “talking ” machine
sustain this pitiless test ?
Mr. Edison, upon the com-
pletion of his wonderful
musical instrument The

the greatest artists of the
day to sing and play in
direct comparison with his
“re-creation” of their work.
Jacques (Jrlus
of the New York Metropolitan Opera House —the world’s greatest
Wagnerian tenor —one of the many great artists who have sung in
direct comparison with The NEW EDISON.
Musical critics of more than one hundred of America’s leading news-

ears were unable to distinguish between the artist’s voice and Edison’s
“re-creation” of it.

Miss SYLVIA PRICE, a charming Rexona Girl (from a photo, by Tesse Ileggart).
Dear Sirs, —
My daughter, Sylvia, has used your Rexona Soap for her hair and
skin. Beyond doubt it has proved a wonderful restorer for her hair, for
since using your soap it is now long, brown and glossy. Her skin is now
beautifully clear, and as she is shortly to appear before the public as a
high-class singer, it is necessary that her skin and hair should be beyond
criticism, and I feel very grateful to Rexona for all it has done for her.
Yours very truly,
MRS. DOLLY PRICE,
“Yaralla,” Hastings Road, Botany.
GIRLS! REXONA SOAP Gives Natural
Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair, which cannot be imitated, can be obtained by
regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they
cannot heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing,
antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment
of skin affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and
Cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, and leave the complexion clear,
fresh and velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.

The Return.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T ¥THEN I return to you, dearest, you
\ w will find deep down in my
* » eyes ,
A wistfulness and a weariness,
through gazing at wondrous lands ;
For soft o’er column and causeway, and
high where the new hills rise,
The veils which Memory fashions are
draped by her patient hands;
Though new notes chime in the singing, old
words come murmuring through,
Till the footfalls falter a little, and turn
from the stranger ways ;
While strong in my inmost being, the old
world strives with the new,
And pale in the halls of the morrow are
wraiths of our golden days.
Dear, when I stepped from our circle, with
a heart like a tiny toy’s,
Oh, our rose-white circle of noontimes and
dusks that were calm and sweet!
I hugged the earth like a picture book, or a
marvellous bag of toys,
Amazed at the spin of the wide world,
like a child in a crowded street;
Till Distance proffered her white arm, and
there in her finger-tips
I felt the throb of the wander-blood and
fared from the open South
With a song that marched to my heart-beat
and echoed across my lips,
And the sun flushed over the sea-line, with
a kiss for my eager mouth.
Matched with the wider places, caught in
the meshes of Space,
I have seen the hurry of waters, that
swirl by the grey cliff’s knees ;
I have felt the lash of the spindrift, like a
whip on my shrinking face.
When the lean hull leapt to the long wave
and rioted overseas.
The chatter and whirring of winches, the
jargon of native cries,
The shouting of ships in the darkness, the
wheen of the brown gulls’ wings.
When I return to you, dearest, so will you
find in mine eyes
A level glance and a stalwart, through
living ’mid stalwart things.
I have hearkened the lisping of waters in
many an old-world glade,
And the cities that fling to the white stars
their thunderous monotone;
I have walked in the ancient temples, and
deep in their haunted shade
Counselled with eloquent marvels,
wrenched from the naked stone;
Yea, we have counselled together, speaking
the wonder-phrase—
Words that are sweet to the fancy, syl-
lables grand to the eyes;
Where the music of pillar and cornice, lifts
in an ancient maze
Only a little less lovely than that which
it glorifies !
Dearest, on my returning, you will find in
my altered speech
A stronger cadence of manliness that rings
in the tones of Youth ;
For I have sat at the feet of Time, ’mid
elderly things that teach
Less of the dreams and the gilt of Life
and more of the rugged truth ;
And the beating wings of the seons have
muffled my tiny pride.
For time with his bony fingers can tatter
the printed page,
And the noblest voice be silenced where
the deserts of Doom lie wide,
Stifling with sand and sorrow the stony
whispers of Age.
When I return to you, dearest, back from
the wider place,
I shall have changed a little, for so will
you surely find
The echo of old-world marvels lingering still
on my face.
One may not bide in the Halls of Age and
think with a boyish mind ;
Yet the heart of my youth I promised, the
vows which my tongue have named,
Inviolate, firm and sacred, I’ll give with
an honest hand,
And the open book of my living I’ll offer you
unashamed,
And God, the lover of lovers, will help you
to understand.

grain to twenty thousand gal-
-1 1 Ions!” said Lampson. “Why, Gor-
don, this stuff must be about the
deadliest poison on earth.”
The inventor raised his eye-shade and
blinked as the strong light hit his reddened
eyes.
“On the contrary,” he said, “it is toler-
ably harmful in the raw state ; but I ques-
tion whether even a large dose would cause
more than a passing sickness. It is highly
soluble, however, and the most minute trace
of it in water will produce all the moral
effects I claim.”
“Are you pulling my leg?” said Lampson,
turning upon him suddenly.
“Let me demonstrate,” said the inventor.
“Puss, puss, puss!”
He held the door of the laboratory open
and a big black cat came into the room. The
inventoi' crossed to a 'cupboard and took out
a plate of fish, a small portion of which he
threw on the floor, while the plate contain-
ing the. remainder was set on a high bench.
“That cat is a thief,” lie said. “Watch
the effect on her moral nature.”
Lampson laughed, but looked on at the
experiment. The inventor filled a saucer
with milk and put into it the contents of a
small test-tube which contained the new
chemical compound in highly diluted form.
Meanwhile the cat, smelling out the remain-
der of the fish, had made a bound to reach
the plate.
“See. She’s a thief,” said the inventor,
“Puss, get down! Puss, puss; here’s milk
for you.”
lie set the saucer before the cat in a
corner of the room. When the liquid had
disappeared, puss wiped his whiskers anc
strolled towards the fish.
“Watch,” said the inventor.
The cat sat at a convenient spot to spring
upon the fish and looked upward with long-
ing eyes.
“Cured,” said the inventor. “That cat is
no longer a thief. He wants the fish, but
won’t steal it. The compound has exactly
the same effect on man. Once let the human
race taste it and there is no use for the
policeman.”
Lampson laughed.
“There’s nothing like faith, Gordon, h or-
give me if I seem sceptical, but how do you
intend to get it to the human race?”
“I’ll try it on Sydney first. Prime
Minister is coming here to-morrow. The day
following will be the great test. '
“I’m afraid you’ll find it harder to con-
vince the Prime Minister than me or the
cat. Look at the thing. It won’t attempt to
steal the fish.”
“The cat is morally cleansed for forty-
eight hours,” said Gordon ; “but as for con-
vincing the Prime Minister I have no desire
to convince him of anything but sin. Look,”
he cried, the pride of the inventor and the
eagerness of the moral reformer struggling
for joint expression, “here is the engine that
must awaken the God-in-man through plac-
ing my compound in the water supply of
the city.”
As he spoke he threw aside the coverings
which hid a short, thick cannon constructed
of brass and steel which stood on a concrete
base near the window.
“What on earth is that?” said Lampson,
coming close and peering at it through his
glasses.
“This gun,” said the inventor, “has the
range of the reservoir. I have here four
hundred rounds of shells charged with my
compound. I have no near neighbors to be
disturbed by the noise of the firing; the
flight of the missiles will never be noticed.
The moment the shells strike the water the
compound they contain becomes dissolved,
the whole water-supply is affected and every
cup of tea drunk changes a moral nature for
forty-eight hours.”
“Seems simple,” said Lampson. He looked
in bewilderment at the gun and its mechan-
ism. If Gordon was mad, there was at least
a strange attention to detail about his in-
sanity.
“When does the bombardment begin?”
“Now, if you are ready to help me,” said
the inventor.
He threw up the window as he spoke.
Lampson observed the thick darkness with-
out and heard the splashing of the rain.
They were three miles from the nearest
house and eight from the nearest railway
station. Whatever the outcome of the
strange scientific prank, he could not help
being interested.
“Right,” he said, “I’ll lend a hand; but
don’t blame me if we’re both landed in gaol.”
A quarter of an hour later the first dull
boom—a boom strangely softened by
mechanical and acoustic devices—proclaimed
to the dripping trees without that the re-
form of the world had begun.
* * * *
Smithurst reached his office at five min-
utes past nine in the morning. He had come
to town without waiting for breakfast
because the business of the day was unpleas-
antly pressing and he could think of nothing
else.'
Smithurst was, in plain fact, about as
completely ruined as a man could be without
having actually felt the final knock-out blow.
He needed twenty-five pounds by eleven
o’clock and he had not the remotest idea
where to get it. Very many more pounds
were required with almost equal urgency;
but Smithurst’s financial vision was for the
moment narrowed to the moment’s need. He
threw up the window and breathed the hot
air.
“I wish I had stayed for a cup of tea,”
he muttered. “If only some of those fel-
lows I’ve helped out of holes would pay me
some of the money they’ve borrowed/, I
might scratch through.”
A knock came to the door and Bruce
Phillips followed it without waiting for an
invitation.
“Just ran round, old man, with that fiver
you lent me. Please don’t remind me how
long ago it was. I'm thoroughly ashamed
of myself. So long; I’m in no end of a
hurry.”
He was gone before Smithurst could say
a word ; but before he was down the stairs
there was another knock. This time the
visitor seemed to be a complete stranger.
“Mr. Smithurst, I believe?”
“That is my name.”
“I am from Webb and Jonesmith, solici-
tors.”
Smithurst groaned inwardly.
“You may. remember the Halliburton
estate in which you were interested —a
matter of some seven years ago. There was
a mistake —a clerical error—no, not that —
but, ah- ”
He paused for breath while the amazed
Smithurst waited for his words of doom.
His luck had been out lately. What for-
gotten liability was this which had leaped
up out of the past?
His visitor, red in the face and obviously
confused, tried to pull himself together.
“There is a sum owing to you of £163
10s. 6d. The cheque is here and the state-
ment. I trust that no complaint—ah—
good-day, sir.”
He had bolted for the door before
Smithurst could realise the astounding thing
that had happened.
“Am I dreaming?” said the victim of good
luck. He fingered the cheque and listened
for the next knock. In a moment it came.
. “The thing is becoming a habit. Come
in, come in !”
It was the publican, Hammond—a man
whom Smithurst barely knew by sight and
had never spoken to. Slowly lie rolled his
ponderous bulk into the room.
“Excuse me,” he said in a large, husky
voice. “I have a few calls to pay and
looked in on my way. I noticed you' about
my place too often lately. Them drinks
don't cost sixpence. I reckon it ain’t fair
to a good customer. Square deal’s my idea.
Half the time you only take a lager—a
small draught lager. I figure it out this
is about what I owe you.”

DO YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING UP?
Does your back ache constantly? Do you feel dull,
miserable and tiled all the time? Do you wonder why
ordinary daily duties wear you out? Do you have “blue”
days and restless nights ?
Kidney Sickness silently plays out the strongest person.
A dull, draggy ache in the small of the back will tell on the
healthiest man 01 woman. And if the kidneys fail in their task
of filtering uric-acid poisons from the blood, it leads to painful
attacks of neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica, gravel, headaches—
to worrying attacks of dizziness, nervousness, heart palpitatio 1
scanty, painful and too frequent urination.
Don t neglect weak kidneys. There is danger of run-
ning gradually into dropsy, Bright’s disease or diabetes. At
the first sign of backache or disorders of the urine, use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. A remedy that has cured your
neighbor will cure you. -

Mrs. Isaac Swales, S 9 Fitzroy Street, Moore Park, Sydney, says:—
“Twelve months ago I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for a severe
attack of backache and kidney trouble, which had defied other remedies for
a long time, and I am pleased to publicly state that these grand
p:lls cured me. 1 used to suffer agony from backache and other symptoms of
kidney disorder, and I was sometimes so ill that I could hardly get about.
t pain m my back was particularly revere when stooping. I was also
troubled with headaches restless nights, and disordered secretions, but after
a cours ? of Doans Backache Kidney Pills, I felt in splendid health
and have remained well ever since.” 1
Five years later Mrs. Swales confirms her previous statement-—“ Six
years have elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me and I
have had no return of my old complaint all that time.” !
Mrs. B. Higgins, Elsinore, Park Road, Mascot, Sydney says:—“My
husband suffered from urinary trouble and backache for some time. The
secretions were seriously disordered, being thick and cloudy, and difficult to
pass. . His back was always aching, which made every movement torture.
Sometimes he would scream out the pain was so severe. One day he was
advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by a man who had been cured
of serious trouble by this remedy. He sent for some and. after taking two
bottles, felt so much better that he went on with them, and six bottles cured
him. He has no backache now, and the secretions are clear and regular.
In fact, he is a different man in health and spirits, thanks to Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills.”
Nine years later Mr. Higgins says:—“l am pleased to tell you I have
had no return of my old complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me nine years ago.”

He thumped a roll of notes on the desk
and was gone.
“But, I say, Mr. Hammond, this is
absurd.”
“A square deal, a square deal,” said the
publican and waved a fat hand.
The door banged and Smitfiurst looked
tnoughtful.
“Something's happened,” he said. “I’ll
be a millionaire if this keeps up.”
And it kept up until eleven o’clock, when
Smithurst went out to pay that pressing
and long overdue debt which had seemed
the chief business of the day.
As he passed along the street he noted
the attitudes of the people. Everybody was
hurrying on some errand. There was an
alertness, a seriousness about every face
that seemed unusual. No loungers blocked
the corners or leaned upon posts. He saw
a navvy working at a drain in the street,
using pick and shovel with an energy he
had never before observed.
Something was wrong or right with the
place, but exactly what it was he found
it hard to say.
When lie offered to pay his debt, the
collector, who had previously threatem*d
him with ail the penalties law and custom
would allow, called him on one side.
“I trust, Mr. Smithurst, if this is in any
way inconveniencing you, you will let me
know. A week hence—or a month—well,
if it’s quite convenient—thank you, thank
you.”
“What the deuce is wrong with them ail,”
thought Smithurst. “Yesterday there was
nothing but ill-luck; to-day I’Ve collected
nearly a thousand pounds of money I had
forgotten about; and now the people I ow T e
money to don’t want to be paid.”
Then, remembering that he had eaten no
breakfast, he went to look for a sandwich
and a cup of tea.
The tea-room into which he dropped was
one of the five dozen owned by the firm
which specialises in good food and slow
service; but to-day the waitress ran—
positively ran—to serve him. She was smil-
ing, too, and all the usual irritating super-
iority of her manner was gone.
Smithurst sipped his tea and thought.
It was a good thing to have got rid of
his most pressing debts. That would lift
a weight off his mind and enable him to
make a new start. This tea was unusually
nice ; so was the sandwich.
By jove, he must think of Molly now.
He hadn’t played quite the square game
with her. Poor little girl! He must start
and make amends at once. What a rotter
he liad been !
But that half-crown he hadn’t returned
8011 • 08. yes, and Smith’s ten
shillings—bah, what were these trifles?
Trifles, yes, but they must be paid; and
there was an account owing to Grafton
Grafton who had specially asked him to
pay because he couldn’t afford to be out
of pocket.
A flood of remembrance poured over him.
Debts, obligation, kindly deeds left undone
—why, it would keep him busy all the
atternoon getting round to these people.
As he started to make up his arrears of
duty and goodwill he remembered more things
and still more.
A perspiration of remorse broke out on his
forehead.
“My God,” he moaned, “what a scoundrel
I’ve been! It will take half a year to
get things straight. Half a year! Looks as
if it will take a lifetime.”
As he scampered about the town on errand
after errand dozens of repentant debtors and
remorseful sinners hammered at his own
office door.
At midnight Smithurst, utterly exhausted,
sought his bed. He had made a beginning,
but it was only a beginning. His self-
accusation was as strong as ever; and he
was going thiough with the work of restitu-
tion and redemption at whatever cost.
All Sydney was very tired that night.
All day its business had been at a standstill.
The desire for self-reform, which had come to
Smithurst, had come to all who drank of the
city’s water. The next day the real trouble
began.
Very early in the morning everybody was
busy at tasks that were remote from the
ways of trade and business. Only by chance
did an occasional repentant sinner meet the
person to whom he desired to make restitu-
tion or amends. The offices were empty;
the shops were closed'; the pubs were mostly
filled with prayer. At a street corner an
importing draper beat upon his breast and
called to the skies for forgiveness. Directly
opposite him a prominent member of the
State Ministry was scourging himself with
a dog-whip.
By noon the whole city seemd to be com-
pletelv insane.
* * * *
“Well.” said Lampson, who Lad just
arrived, “the thing worked beyond all expec-
tations. Your salts are the most marvellous
invention of all the ages.”
The inventor raised his head.
“Damned rot,” he said, and fell again into
an attitude of gloom and despair.
“What's the matter, old man?” said Lamp-
son. “It did all you claimed and more. The
people have grown honest; they are sorry
for all the wrong they have ever done. You
are on the way to world reform.”
“Bah.” said the inventor. “Much good"
that will do them.”
Lampson looked as surprised as he felt.
“There’s no understanding you men of
science. Here you invent a marvellous
thing, try it out with success, and then
sit down and mope as if you had met with
complete failure.”
Gordon sprang to his feet.
“I’ve proved that I’m an ass,” he said.
“That’s all there-us to it. Look at Sydney.
What a complete mess I’ve made of the
people! Did you see them ? Did you hear
them talking? I’ve got an idea now of the
sort of Bedlam a world without evil in it
would be.”
“But that’s only the start,” cried Lamp-
son. “When all debts are squared and all
obligations met these people will take up
their work with a fresh zeal and understand-
ing.”
“It is I who have a fresh understanding,”
Gordon growled- “I know what sort of
fool I’ve been; and the knowledge doesn’t
please me.”
“But evil is evil, my clear chap, and to
root out evil is to do a great thing for the
world.”
“Bah ! Leave that to the parsons. Haven’t
you seen enough to know better? My inven-
tion is a fourpence-a-yard idea, compared
with the big, fine working notion of evil.”
“Gordon, you’re mad. Why, those salts
of yours, I tell you, man, will do all that
ever a devout Christian expected God to do.”
The inventor paced the room.
“Lampson, you’re a bigger fool than I am.
No more of that stuff goes into the city
water; and the formula is already destroyed.
To-morrow the real salts—the salts of God
—will get working again in the community.
Look at this fool thing.”
He took up a big hammer and swung it in
the air. The blow fell with violence on
the open breech of the cannon. Once, twice,
thrice he struck.
“There,” he said, “that’s out of action
with the rest. Let the salts of God do
their work- I’m full up of reform by
chemistry.”
GEORGE STREET.
The Climax.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE appearance of little Miss Hall at
Walker’s created an extraordinary
stir. Little Miss Hall was an extraor-
dinary girl, slim, fair, fairy-like, with gos-
samer hair of the color of Ballarat gold, and
a little red, full-lipped mouth that suggested
ripe cherries so emphatically that every hale
man swallowed an involuntary gulp at the
sight of her. Miss Pat Hall (“Pat” for
Patricia) was a niece of Walker’s and rich
and refined. She was a clever musician,
and sang to the accompaniment of a
banjo, which in her hands sounded like an
appropriate instrument for the cherubim and
seraphim.
Miss Patricia had had a nervous
trouble, and doctors sent her to Beetfield for
rest and change, and the benefits of hill air,
and the salubriousness shed by uncountable
gums ; and before sundown on the first day
11 men were in love with her. Nobody
thought of including Goaty among the vic-
tims. Goaty was general utility at Walker’s ;
he was the type of little man that always
seems to be wearing a big man’s trousers,
and he had a huge, upright moustache
which stood back from his rabbit’s face like
the ears of a hare. Goaty had primitive,
almost troglodyticah ideas of cleanliness too,
and glimpses of his teeth suggested small
gatherings of ironscraps. The others found
Goaty suddenly energetic, particularly vig-
orous at milking. He w T as now willing,
apparently, to take upon himself the manip-
ulation of unlimited cows. Eventually he
offered a satisfactory explanation.
I m a pretty good milker,” he said, “but
till I can get through five more in the hour
I shan’t think myself worthy of her.” “Her”
was Miss Patricia Hall, heiress, and this
was Goaty’s idea of self-improvement.
Later, Goaty was discovered taking a bath
in the creek. “She seems a bit pe’tic’lar,”
lie said. “Bet she doil’t offen see a mustarch
like that.”
■ Then came the night of the big fire at
v\ alker’s and Dan West’s magnificent res-
cue of the heiress. Dan was the biggest man
on the farm, and he certainly realised the
poster as be came through the smoke and
flame, bearing the slim, white-clad figure of
uttle Miss Hall. But the spectators had
barely done justice to the tableau when from
the same door, through similar smoke and
Hame, his wonderful moustache burnt into
semi-molten clumps and minor conflagra-
tion starting in his collapsible bags, came
Goaty, dancing with rage. The rouseabout
capered round Dan and the rescued maiden
all. discretion evaporated in his ape-like
frenzy. “What’d you do that fer?” he
squealed. “Like your cheek buttin’ in' I
was go in’ to do that. What the ’ell dyeh
think I set the ’ouse afire fer?”

The Room Above.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SO it’s over and clone with, and now
The old world, stunned and breath-
less, reposes,
Like a strong man tired out, and its brow
Wears a garland of laurel and roses.
Just to think of the wonder of it
Sets the heart of me thrilling and throb-
bing.
In the room just above ivhere I sit
There is somebody sobbing, and sobbing!
Ah, the menace is over at last,
And the Aw of doom has departed;
W .-r-- cried, but the trial has passed,
..nd we come from it strong and stout
hearted.
Though it cost almost all in the end,
Should we count the cost ever and only?
Has the too man above me no friend
That she sits brooding always—and lonely?
There’s a finish, at last, to our cares,
And the night that encumbered us ceases.
Strange the grief' of the woman upstairs,
’Tis as though her whole world were in
pieces !
Let us think of the gain, not the loss—
Of the crown, the crown only, nought
other.
Who’s the woman? and what is her cross?—
’Tis the grief, just the grief of a mother!
