“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tlxes Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal ,
is Ike only paper which has a consistent ami dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person,- one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the i
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.'
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin,
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th j
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success- in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clahns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
-The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most Widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so. .closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
tothe bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent imshman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—-that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
1 have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its

Out of the Train: In Richmond.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I am lying on my bedstead in a little dingy room,
Lying list’ning to the landlady who’s growling
down below,
And more fearsome than the dampness and the
dreariness of gloom
Is the thought of all she’ll utter as she tells me
what I owe.
And I pull the blanket round me with a nervous
thrill of pain,
As I gaze upon the clothes-line through the dirty
window-pane.
I am used to washing struggles, and I reck not of
the cost
As that clothes-line brings me glimpses of the
other boarder’s togs,
But I can’t help thinking sadly of the linen I have
lost,
As my single shirt dries slowly in the midst of
Richmond fogs,
My only under-raiment that I’m waiting for in
vain
I see floating from the clothes-line through the
dirty window-pane.
One time, not so very long ago, I had a lot of
things—
Quite a decent sort of wardrobe as to collars,
shirts, and ties,
But they’ve “melted” in the washing, or to
uncle’s taken wings,
And now I’m nudely waiting till my scanty
garment dries.
It is thin and old and ragged, yet it’s all that I
retain,
And I watch it, with emotion, through the dirty
window-pane.
Then, ah, then 1 When it is ready will the missus
take it down,
Quickly iron it and starch it in a streaky sort of
way;
Then she’ll lay it on my door-mat—“lf you’re
going into town,
It’s just time as you was moving; don’t get
lying there all day !”
Though she knows, for all it profits, that I might
as well remain
Gazing idly at the clothes-line through the dirty
window-pane.
And a wild and futile longing all at once I seem
to feel
To get up and cut that clothes-line and set trail-
ing in the dirt
All the other lodgers’ washing and then back to
bed to steal
And to contemplate the ruin, but, alas I my
only shirt
Would be spoiled with all the others, so I don’t
see what I’d gain,
But I curse the crowded clothes-line ll.iough
the dirty window-pane.
And soon gently o’er my spirit comes a sense of
grateful rest,
For it’s started raining softly, and the missis
won’t invade
E’en the threshold of my chamber till she knows
that I am dressed,
So I’m thankful that the drying of my shirt has
been delayed.
And I turn once more to slumber—with a blessing
on the rain,
And a last look at the clothes-line through the
dirty window-pane.

Dear Bulletin, —Did not the Khedive of
Egypt (that one who spent millions in personal
extravagance) make an arrangement with the
national bondholders, some 20 years ago, said
arrangement entailing a sacrifice by creditors of a
portion of their claim ? Yours, Unearned In-
crement. [That wasn’t bankruptcy, but recon-
struction. — Ed. B.]
The Smithsonian Institute, U.S., has a
skeleton of the Hypsirhophus, the fossil kangaroo
of America. It was 30ft. long, its back studded
with spines of great size. The tail had a
double row of sharp spines. A coat of mail
covered the entire body, and the mouth had a bony
beak.
The British navy still continues to hold
the record for muddlemeut, hideous faultiness of
construction, and general disaster. The latest
news is that the Resolution, a huge iron tank of
14,150 tons, has been so badly strained somewhere
in the innards that she was glad to crawl back
into port again to be disembowelled and fixed up.
The Bulletin’s Missing Word Compe-
tition No. 10 closes on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 1894.
A wandering Australian artist recently
painted the portrait of a Maoriland farmer’s wife,
and presented it to her as a souvenir. Then the
she-Goth looked at him suspiciously, and asked,
in an aggressive tone, where the other eleven were?
She had an idea that oil-paintings went by the
dozen, like photographs.
In ’72, at Maitland (N.S.W.) one Jimmy
and a mate (who had been a local preacher) were
arraigned for robbery from a dwelling. “ Have
you anything to say why the sentence of the
Court,”&c.? Jimmy: “Nothing, yer Honor; only
I wish to remind you that life is short, so make
my sentence shorter.” Two years. “Have you
anything,’’ &c. ? The ex-L.P. soared into a
brilliant harangue that quite “fetched ” the Court
with its eloquence. In the midst of a most
pathetic flight, the gaol-bell rang, whereupon
Jimmy, who knew the ropes, leaped up, and
shouted: —“Gut it short, or we’ll miss our
dinner.”

The paper reads s—
“Barclay struck it rich at Barrier Brow/*
“Why, he’s dead,”
Thought I; “ there’s some mistake.
He's six months ‘audited,’ down Blue Lake.
So, that’s how.”
I paused awhile;
“’Twas the papers, then, that worked him out?”
With a smile;
“ So, Tom, you still exist 1 . . .
Who is he ? Forgive haste —your fist;
Sing out!
“ Knew him—well;
Worked on the goldfield; * Last Call ’ claim ;
Yarns he’d tell!
They’d make one old, then young,
Like shade and sun on a West plain slung;
Fill up. The same.
“ And the song!
(How it rang o’er the moonlit belt of gums
And billabong,
And the camp would echo—
‘ Shovel, saddle, and—and—home ;’ You know—

“The machine works well enough,” said
Jack to his mate ; “ but it can’t make the gold, if
the gold’s not there. However, we may drop
across it, like the others, if we keep pegging on.”
“We might,” grunted his mate.
This was after four days of hard and fruitless
toil with a patent dry-blower.
The two mates were known at Hannan’s to be
real chickens. The sun blazed down and seamed
their unwashed hides with ugly cracks, but they
persevered undauntedly till they were down to
dry damper and a gallon of water a man.
The gold had no run. That was patent. The
party above them were all right; they just were
on it. The German “hatter” below them was
also evidently in luck, for he could be seen trans-
ferring specks from his dish to his “shammy.”
“I wonder what Bismarck would take for his
tailings?” said Jack, one evening; “he can’t be
saving all his gold with only dishes.”
“ Not half of it. Take my word, Dutchy’s got
a real good thing. Have you twigged the shammy
at his belt ? - It was light enough when he came
here last month, and now look at it! Notice, too,
how the beggar shepherds his claim. As though
he was scared that we’d jump it.”
That was true enough. The German slept on
his claim, and seldom left it for longer than a
minute. His behaviour was a patent defamation
of his neighbours’ characters, and earned him
their hearty dislike, which found occasional voice.
But Bismarck was a gentle-spoken, peace-loving
man, and conciliated the mates so self-depre-
catingly that their words were never actually
translated into actions.

After a while, the swagman sat down on his

well-filled chamois-leather bag from his belt, and
recklessly emptied its contents on the ground.
“Yah! I dinks you vhas hardly voart dree

The Times has discovered that “the roil
is the true source of colonial wealth.” Ever and
anon some great, stale truth like this strikes the
editor of an Australian daily, and is diffidently
set forth in a leading article, and travels round to
the editor of an English daily, and he incorporates
it in a leading article, and it is straightway called
back to Australia, and appears in large type
under an enormous heading, and people bow down
and worship it as an unheard-of inspiration of
British genius. Some folk would never know
they were alive if they didn’t read in an English
newspaper that the number of idiots in the
colonies is increasing.
Dr. G. R. Ferris, before the Indian Opium
Commission The conclusion I have been
obliged to come to is that, in a country like India,
having regard to the habits of the people, the
character of their avocation, the peculiarities of
the climate, and the particular character of their
food, opium is distinctly beneficial—that it is not
harmful, that it is not a vice, that it does not
promote in any way immorality, that it does not
increase, but distinctly decreases, mortality, and
that without it the vital returns of ma.ny parts of
the country would be simply appalling.” In a
word, opium in India does no more harm than
does claret in France. Years ago the present
writer met an old doctor who, for 30 years, had
been an official physician in Hongkong. He
strongly defended the use of opium, and said that
his unrivalled experience of opium-smokers was
that they were not necessarily any more unhealthy
than peopl« who used tobacco.

“Watering the Tree of Protection.”
The Victorians were told that (he sacrifice would be
only for a time, but they had been watering the tree of
Protection for 21 years, and was there one of those indus-
tries ready to say to the Victorian people, “Take off the
duties; we can stand on our own feet?”—G. 11.
Reid, of New South Wales.
The above sample of mixed metaphor, de-
livered the other day by G. H. Reid, the
figurehead of the New South Wales Foreign-
traders, is an interesting example of how
the Australian Foreign - trade politician
comes out of the same hole which he went
in at, and keeps on repeating the process ad
infinitum. Something like 21 years ago the
logicians of the Calico-Jimmy party said that
the Victorian Protectionists had said some-
thing wliich they never did say, and ever
since then they have risen with enthusiasm
at short intervals to point out that the thing
that wasn’t said hasn’t been verified. And
though it may be proved over and over again
that the alleged statement was purely a
Foreign-trader’s invention, and a particularly
dull invention at that, the fact that the
prophecy which no one ever uttered has not
c me true, and that Protection hasn’t kept
the promise which it never made, will be
dished up at regular intervals till G. H.
Reid’s latest successor has fallen into the
sere and bald-headed leaf, and his creed is a
toothless superstition speaking feebly out of
a tomb.
a a #
Neither the Victorians nor any other
people were ever told by any Protectionist
statesman that “ the sacrifice would be only
for a time.” For, in the first place, Pro-
tection is not a sacrifice in any sense of the
term, and it is not for a time but for the
best part of an eternity. It wall end, and
there will be universal Freetrade, when all
the nations of the earth have attained to
practically the same standard of civilisation,
when wages are equal throughout the five
continents ; when, in the use of machinery
and all manner of labour-saving appliances,
all races are on an equality, when there is a
universal agreement as to the hours of
labour, when cheap niggers and cheap China-
men and cheap non-unionists are all
abolished, when war is extinct, and
there are no more blockades to make
it essential that a nation should be
self-dependent—and not till then. And, as
these events seem to be so far distant as to
lie beyond the outer rim of Time and further
off than Futurity, it may be said that Pro-
tection, to all intents and purposes, is going
to last for ever. It was not introduced apolo-
getically as a temporary evil which was to
be abolished later on, when it had served a
temporary purpose, to make room for a long
and blessed eternity of Foreign-trade. The
reason of its establishment was that Foreign-
trade was a permanent curse, and the Pro-
tectionist no more looks forward to its final
restoration than G. H. Reid looks forward
to a glad future when ho will be disem-
bowelled.
# # #
The assertion that Victoria was persuaded
to submit to Protection, with the assurance
that it would only be of temporary duration,
is the one permanent joke of the otherwise
humourless Foreign-trade faction. The pro-
vince was utterly beggared by Foreign-trade,
and, according to G. H. Reid, it submitted
to be relieved, relying on the promise that
it would by-and-bye be allowed to go back to
its old, joyous condition of beggary. It started
to build up manufactures in the blessed hope
that they would presently be demolished
by the return of Freetrade, and through an
act of unexampled treachery they were not
demolished. It deliberately founded a new
policy in the happy assurance that it wouldn’t
last, and it proceeded to shut out the shoddy
goods made by foreign pauper labour and to
provide work for its own citizens, relying
entirely on the hope that the pauper-made
shoddy would presently come back again,
and that its citizens would be out of work as
before. The mirthless G. H. Reid makes
these assertions seriously, and from out his
vitreous eye he sees the evil that is to come
—or rather the evil which has already arrived
—through that breach of faith, and weeps
lest New South Wales should go and do
likewise,
• • »
As the same harmless little man patheti-
cally observes, after 21 years of continuous
Protection, there is not one Victorian indus-
try of any importance which could stand a
return to Freetrade principles without giving
up the ghost. The Bulletin firmly believes
in the accuracy of this statement, but fails to
see where the horror of it comes in. If the
fact that the protected manufactures of Vic-
toria can’t stand Freetrade without dying of
it is a reason why they should be killed, then
the equally relevant fact that G. H. Reid,
after being protected by the law, in common
with other citizens, between 40 and 50 years,
can’t bear being slain without becoming a
corpse as the immediate consequence, is a
sufficient reason why the law should cease
to protect him and he should be made an
outlaw. And, by the same process of reason-
ing, the fact that Great Britain, after being
protected by its navy for many centuries,
can’t keep off an invader without a navy any
better now than when it first started, is a
sufficient proof that the navy is a failure and
should be sold at the nearest marine-store
for old iron. Also, the argument applies to
Freetrade as well as to Protection. It is the
bitter wail of every Foreign-trader that the
once crowded wharves of Sydney are becom-
ing more and more desolate because the
blighting influence of Protection has killed
the commerce of the city, but if that com-
merce, after more than half-a-century of
Freetrade, is still so weak that it can’t stand
even a small amount of Protection, then the
fact that Freetrade is a failure is too con-
spicuous to need further comment.
• • *
The circumstance that Victoria’s indus-
tries, after 21 years of Protection, still want
Protection as badly as ever, would be lament-
able if the Victorians either expected or
desired them to do otherwise. But, as it
happens, they neither expected nor desired
it. So long as the Victorian artisan is better
paid, and works shorter hours, and lives in a
house which is more like the habitation of a
human being and less like the lair of a hog,
and is less miserable, ignorant, squalid and
hopeless than his principal rivals, the British
pauper, the Chinaman, the Hindoo, and
others, so long Protection must continue to
be necessary. And the fact that it is as
necessary now as it was 21 years ago is
chiefly an evidence that the squalid Foreign-
trader above mentioned remains about as
cheap and as squalid as he was, and that 21
years of sound Foreign - trade principles
haven’t improved his condition in any way.
The most, visible i-esult of Victoria’s policy is
that the province, after only half as long an
existence as that of N.S. Wales, and with
little more than one-fourth the area, supports
a practically equal population ; that she is fully
as rich as the “mother” province despite the
latter’s stupendous asset of an additional
220,000 square miles of soil ; that the cost of
living in Victoria is as low as in any other
of the Australias, and that, with her vastly
smaller area, she is nearly self - sup-
porting in the matter of food-supplies,
which New South Wales, under the Foreign-
trade regime, never was and never even
promised to be. Under these circumstances
the fact that the province can’t afford to
abandon its present policy, and try weird
experiments which promise nothing, is just
as dreadful as the fact that G. H. Reid
can’t see his way to abandon the solid earth
and habitually walk on a wire in mid-air at
half his present salary.
* « •
The principal curse of Protection, accord-
ing to Foreign-trade logic, is that it is a
cumulative disease. It has no finality. The
10 per cent, duty grows to 20 per cent., then
to 30, and so on ; there is a constant demand
for more, and the alleged evil never has an
end. This circumstance is said to be a
positive evidence of the nefariousness of the
protective principle ; but it is just possible
that it arises from the circumstance that the
people at large find Protection to be bene-
ficial, and that they would not want more of
it under any other circumstances. Mean-
while, there is no recorded instance of any
freetrade community putiing in a general
demand for more Freetrade, any more
than there is of a person with a boil
petitioning for a crippled back and an
inflamed corn as an additional blessing.
The cause of this is not seriously explained,
but probably it arises from the circumstance
that Freetrade has been tried and has proved
a pathetic failure. Otherwise the steady
and continuous dropping away of one com-
munity after another from the blessed gospel
of imported shoddy is unaccountable. Vic-
toria, it is true, has “ watered the tree of
Protection ” for two decades, and—barring
the fact that she supports about as large a
population and produces as much wealth
upon 80,000 square miles as New
South Wales does on 300,000 and that
she can show as much material progress
on her fiftieth birthday as her neighbour can
on her hundredth—the results amount to
comparatively little. But, on the other
hand, New South Wales has watered the
barren stump of Freetrade for fifty years,
and all she has to show for it is that she has
fallen fifty years behind her competitor, and
that her other advantages have been mostly
wasted. The “ tree ” may not amount to
much, but the stump is dead and will bloom
in the spring no more.
Federation—Reid on a Rail.
Editor Bulletin, — By his recent Riverine
utterances re federation, Mr. G. H. Reid has
established a claim to succeed “ Janus ” Parkes
as the two-faced “Jim Crow” of Australian
public life. The only difference between the
two is this : that whereas Parkes, when “turn-
ing his back upon himself,” has the audacity to
declare that he always thought and spoke the
same, Reid, with the innocent air of the
Heathen Chinee, apes the sincerity of a saint,
when in the very act of perpetrating the most
transparent tricks of political poltroonery. He
has been among the New South Wales border
farmers at Berrigan, Mulwala and Corowa as
the champion of Freetrade and Federation.
These farmers he is pleased to represent as con-
verts to Cobdenism. As a matter of fact they
are what they ever w'ere National Pro-
tectionists, i.e. Federationists who want
federation on the basis of Freetrade
within Australian limits and Protection
against the cheap labour and over-production
of the outside world. With their policy it is
impossible for Reid to be in sincere sympathy.
He is the accepted champion of the “ no-sur-
render ” Freetrade faction, and the recognised
exponent of provincialism. How impossible it
is for him to advocate the fiscal and federal
views of the border farmers without hum-
bugging them, a few extracts from his re-
ported speeches within the last three years will
show.
• # »
In May, 1890, he distinguished himself by
leading the opposition to Parkes’ Federal Con-
vention resolutions, and, in doing so, he
advanced as a reason against Federation the
prosperity achieved by the different Australian
States under different policies, which he con-
demned in the following terms ( vide Han-
sard : .
But we also know that in working out their destinies
the different colonies, for many years past, have thought
more of their individual interests, and more of advancing
their own prosperity and importance, than of advancing
what is called the Cause of Australian Unity. In doing
that they have pursued a course . . . which, in my
mind, has had this effect; It has vastly stimulated the
remarkable progress of the whole of the Australias.
These rivalries animating each have stimulated all, and I
look upon the past history of the country as a history of a
progress which has been possible in these lands under
what is called a separate Government of the various
colonies.
This is the language used in 1890 of the man
who, in 1894, declares that Protection is a
policy of public robbery, tyranny, oppression,
and a survival of barbarism, in order to make
the federationists of Riverina believe that he
favours federation while posing as a freetrader,
although he did not condescend to explain to
them by what process of reasoning he had
become converted to acceptance of the federal
idea. A few more Hansard extracts from his
1890 speech will suffice to prove one of two
things, either that he was humbugging the
country in 1890 or is trying to do
thing in 1894.
# * «
Thus he continues to declaim against Federa-
tion in 1890 :
Now, the beginning of this movement was not an
impulse of brotherly love. It was not that sort of out-
pouring of fraternal affection which might bring brothers
together. It is the old story— at the heart of this move-
ment is the military spirit. . . . When you talk to
him (the average man) about precipitating us into a
nation, his shrewd common-sense tells him that you are
pretty much telling him to take a leap in the dark. It is
the fashionable way of inviting you to shut your eyes and
open your mouth, and you will get something very nice.
Then, as regards the fiscal phase of Federation,
he was, if possible, even more explicit and
emphatic :
I have never dropped the other half of Freetrade, that
is, international Freetrade. ... I do not want any of
their half-and-half Freetrade. ... I cannot tamper
with Protection, because I believe it is slavery and
restriction. ... I can look with no satisfaction on
any kind of Federation which will drag this country into
the mire of Protection. ... I am not prepared to
erect across Port Jackson barriers against the world. . .
I am not prepared to do that for all your Federation. I
will not federate until I have a better idea—a more
rational idea—that my principles will not be sacrificed ;
and I say that the man who believes that New South
Wales, handing over these powers to a Federal Parliament
of all the Australias, will result at once in Freetrade, is a
madman.
# w *
Just so, the man who believes that a Federal
Parliament will not maintain the present
national fiscal policy of Protection against the
outside world must be a madman. And in tin
face of the above decisive declarations against
Australian Federation and in favour of inter*
national Freetrade, the public are entitled to
ask from Mr. Reid, when he poses as the Free-
trade advocate of Federation in the border
districts, for straight answers to the following
string of pertinent questions :—ls there less of
the military spirit at the bottom of the move-
ment to-day than three years ago? Does Mr.
Reid dare to say that there is any better
chance of getting international Freetrade now
than then ? Has not the cause of Protection
been advanced rather than retarded in Austra-
lia by the adoption of that policy in New South
Wales, and by the imposition of further border
duties and stock taxes? Wriggling won’t save
Reid from one or other of the horns of the
dilemma in which these questions place him. If
he was sincere in opposing Federation for the
sake of Freetrade in 1890, lie cannot be sincere
in supporting it while still advocating Free-
trade in 1894. When was the fit/ of sincerity
on him, first or last? Perhaps he will endeavour
to wriggle out of the difficulty by denying that
he ever suffered from that complaint. Pro-
bably he never did, as it is of rare occur-
rence among Australian politicians. Besides, we
have Mr Reid’s own authority for doubt-
ing his sincerity, because during the speech
from which the foregoing pieces de convictions
are taken he was reproached by Mr. John
&ee with only arguing one side of the question,
to which he cynically rejoined : “ I have
always heen one-sided on that question. I may
perhaps sit on a rail some day.” This candid
warning of his possible future insincerity is
about the only sincere tiling worth recording
about Mr. Reid’s politically insincere career,
except it be that he was on a rail then, is on a
rail now, and will be on a rail to-morrow.—
Yours, &c., John Norton. Sydney, January
12, 1894. 3

A Spasm of Virtue.
liiENew South Wales Department of Justice
has issued a minute setting forth that the un-
lawful and dishonest “ tote ” is in future to be
put down with a strong hand. The Depart-
ment perpetrates this document in a surprised
tone of voice, as if ii had just heard of the
tote for the first time as an entirely new evil,
and was resolved to nip it in the bud. Hitherto
a hundred or so of notoriously dishonest
“ totes have pursued their calling openly and
in the light of day, so that every one who
passed could hear the brazen “ sport ” conduct-
ing his prohibited trade inside. And about
once a month, on an average, the law would
seize upon one of the multitude of “tote”-
fiends and line him about half-a-day’s takings,
and even while he was at the court being fined
his clerk or his partner would be running the
business as usual. The Department of Justice
now professes to have heard of these things for
the first time, and in its wild astonishment it
su gg es ts that imprisonment, instead of a mere
fine, might possibly do something to meet
the case. It probably never occurs to the
bland and simple-minded Department that a
“tote with any capital at the back of it will
get over this new difficulty by keeping on the
premises a bogus proprietor, whose duty it will
be to go to gaol on behalf of the real proprietor,
and do bis sentence “on his head,” or other-
wise ; and as the law, so far as appears, will
only drop on each fraudful “sport” once in
18 months or so, as heretofore, even imprison-
ment may not affect the evil so very much after
all. The shortest cut to the abolition of
“ totes ” would be the arrest and imprisonment
for six months, “without the option,”of the rich,
fat, good man of unblemished respectability who
lets his shops for purposes of dishonest gambling,
at double the rent which any honest tenant
could afford to pay. And, in like manner, the
shortest road to the abolition of houses of
ill-fame is a period of hard labour in gaol
for the good, oily church-member who owns
the premises, and charges 100 per cent,
more rent because of his tenant’s immo-
rality. It is perfectly easy to find the pious
landlord in each case—the wildly-astonished
Department of Justice could lay its hands on
something like a hundred of him inside of 24
hours if it wanted to, only it doesn’t want to.
And among the hundred would be members of
both Houses of Parliament, parsons, - respectable
and serious lawyers, bulky merchants, bankers,
and, in fact, specimens of every variety of
person with a stake in the country. If Parlia-
ment will pass an act decreeing that the land-
lord of every gambling den, “ tote ’’-shop, and
house of ill-fame shall be imprisoned for any
period from one up to six months and fined,
say, £6o—half the fine going to the informer-
then it will begin to look as if it was reasonably
serious in the matter for the first time. And
if Minister Slattery will draft a measure to
that effect, it will then begin to appear as if he
was reasonably serious.
Haynes Coloured and Haynes Plain.
John Haynes, M.L.A., addressing the down-
trodden farmers at Molong (N.S.W.): —
The Cd. per bushel duty on wheat had done the fanner
double wrong, as it had enabled a band of city schemers
to fix the load of taxation for their own gain on the
fanners’ shoulders, and at the same time the tax had
induced rich men with capital and machinery at their
command to put 1000 and more acres under wheat, and
so produce such a sudden increase in the wheat yield
that the ordinary farmer found himself swamped and
undersold in the market. The moment the country
reached the level of its own demand that moment all
protection ceased, and as the surplus had to be exported
*he price for the local market was ruled by an outside
figure.
11l other words, John Haynes and his kind
complain bitterly in the country because Pro-
tection has made food cheap, and for this reason
it is accursed and should be swept away. And
in the city John Haynes and his band complain
with equal bitterness that Protection makes
food dear, and for that reason it is accursed
also, and ought to be abolished. This is the
difference between Haynes coloured and
Haynes plain. Haynes (coloured) wails to the
farmers of Molong that Protection has caused a
sudden and great increase in the wheat-growing
industry, which increase is altogether objection'


British Australasian quotes this from
Ihe Bulletin, winch, it says, is “apparently
reconsidering its attitude ” J
It is only f.Ur that, t here should be a Colonial Party in
1 -Ti of There has always been an
Lnghsh party in the Australian legislatures.
J. Bull is even duller than he was thought .to be.
able; and Haynes (plain) tells the city in-
habitant that Protection doesn’t foster
any industry, wheat-growing or other-
wise ; that agriculture ought to be en-
couraged, and that the utterly objection-
able feature about Protection is that it
doesn’t encourage it. Furthermore, Haynes
(coloured) objects because “Protection will
cease ” when the country once produces enough
grain for its own requirements, which either
means that it is sinful for the country to grow
enough grain for its own consumption or else
that Protection ought not to cease. Failing one
of these things, there is absolutely nothing to
grumble about. And, meanwhile, the Foreign-
trade Daily Telegraph announces in a leading
article that the increased New South Wales
wheat-production is not owing to the nefarious
influences of “rich men” at all, but simply arises
from the fact that “ the large influx of Vic-
torian and S.A. selectors which took place two
years ago is beginning to show its effect in a
considerably-increased area under wheat culti-
vation.” Which statement is a serious asper-
sion on the veracity of Haynes (coloured), and
practically means that an influx of farmers—
the most valuable class in the community—
began as soon as Protection made New South
Wales a country which was worth living in.
Piety—in its Affectionate Aspect.
The troubles of the shepherd of a new church—
constructed on the principle of brotherly and
sisterly affection—call attention once more to the
buggy variety of religion. The charges brought
against the holy man relate principally to much
alleged cordial embracing of the young ladies
of the church ; an undue distribution of the kiss
of peace ; a fervent, partial hugging of the flock
at picnics ; a tendency to walk home with
the tenderest lambs at late hours and to
wander with them into the bush on festive
occasions, and a general yearning to press the
church to his bosom. The good pastor’s church
was founded on solid hugging principles in the
first place, but the expounder is accused of run-
ning the principle into the ground, so to speak,
and leaving no room for the other brethren.
Apart from this excess of fervour on his part,
their seems to be little difference between his
church and most other churches. The aggregate
church has more trouble through the°pastor
embracing somebody in the vestry than from
any other cause, and its next greatest trouble
arises out of the mutual hugging of the choir.
Tuere is a warm spiritual affection about most
congregations which leads the male members to
pi op up the aching heads of the female mem-
bers at picnics, and to break out into kiss-in-
the-ring and other violent games, and to lift
the female parishioners down awkward places
with needless fervour when the church goes
finalising with hymns and inferior buns, and to
rush witn unnecessary energy to the assistance
of the distressed girl who is supposed to have a
caterpillar down her back. The members paw
each other altogether too much with hot, damp,
shapeless hands and unmeaning giggles, and
there is a superfluity of the kiss of peace. When
a new church starts with an unwonted burst of
fervour it almost always transpires that the
members thereof call each other “brothers”
and “ sisters ” and distribute the aforesaid kiss
of peace in a copious fashion, and that
sacred and spiritual hugging is a conspicuous
feature in the devotions, and that the" pastor
is fair to see and beautifully slim in the legs.
And when the church bursts up it is invariably
because the hugging was unevenly distributed,
and the parson with the slim legs got more
than his share. A very large proportion of
pastors may be divided into two classes—the
young and lovely kind who hug in a brotherly
sp rit, and the old, bald, benevolent, fatherly
kind, who pat the heads of the female members
of the congregation and call them “ child.”
Half the joy of church attendance consists in
the facilities it affords for being mildly affection-
ate and calling it “ spiritual consolation,” or of
mauling the ears and back hair of a
young “sister,” and doing it strictly “in
the Loard.” And the whole joy of that church
picnic, to which the good snufflebuster is so
powerfully addicted, lies in the pious horse-
play which is sandwiched in between the
hymns and the bucketful of weak tea and the
great masses, of indigestible tea-cake. Still,
the chinch picnic is a healthy entertainment in
its w r ay so far as the young are concerned, and
combines all the advantages of a horse-race, a
pious exhortation and a shampoo—the shampoo
consisting principally of violent head-friction
by the pastor and principal saints. It is only
the elderly saint, who gets cold while sitting
neglected on the grass, who finds it seriously
unwholesome. J
A subscription is being taken up in Mel-
bourne for a monument to William Robert
bATCHELL, the young man who lost his life in a
heroic endeavour to save that of Hannah
M'Lennan. It would, perhaps, be a hundred
times more to the point to give the money to
jus parents—if living—or other near relatives,
but Australia has got the monument disease
badly, and if anybody dies under peculiarly
heroic circumstances it will cheerfully raise a
soulless slab to his memory—even while his
family is in want or is being sued for his funeral
bill. One reason, probably, is that an ordinary
subscription can’t be unveiled with much pomp,
and hard eating and drinking, and many bad
»peecaes by tin-pot local celebrities, which
speeches will be afterwards reported at great
length in the local paper. Neither can
the subscription have two lines engraved
upon it stating the name and deeds of
die person in whose honour it was
erected, and twelve lines announcing that
Vj was Axed up by John Smith, three times
Mayor and 12 years alderman of some tenth-
rate municipality, and unveiled by him in the
presence of, and assisted by, John Jones, John
»Rown, and Daniel Jenkins, aldermen, and
Henry Tomkinson, town-clerk. Australia is
great upon raising monuments to those of its
'lead who are a little more important than the
[ uck > and if . after years, the old, penniless
ather of the deceased is arrested on a charge
°j being homeless and sleeping on the lee side
his son’s statue—well, what does it matter?
Sidelights on New Australia. From P. J.
Macnamara, in Brisbane Courier :
We are only just making a start in the most primitive
way under every disadvantage, and it will take six
months at least before we can fei I really sure how things
will go. . . . It is especially hard on married people
with young children now, but in a few months we expect
to have more comforts and conveniences than are possible
at the start. . . . Our little township at present con-
sists of huts made of thatch, with mud walls. . .
The life we lead at present is very rough-and-tumble, as
might be expected by the pioneers. We have little
variety of food, and have no chance of “ home comforts”
yet awhile; but we have enough to eat, and have to be
content with what there is. Some grumble a lot, but
that is ine\ Stable with human nature, as we have it.
The settlement may not go ahead so well or so fast as we
hope, but we believe it will (urn out right in the long
ru " - ■ • ■ It is easii rto break up a home than to
make a new one in a foreign country', and I would not
like to advise anyone to do so (ill I felt sure that I could
do so with a clear conscience.
From Mrs. H. Watson, in Barrier Miner:—
From Villa Rica to the settlement is 40 miles. We
were four days and three nights on the road. The disgust
of our men, who were walking, was a terrible thing.
. . . There is not much large timb r, and stone is very
scarce, so that building will be slow work. . . . The
gardeners with us have no doubt that they will be able to
raise plenty of vegetables. Till then the rations and the
life will be very rough. ... At present we are living
in tents. We have had but very little sickness, and
f-Ttunately so, for there is no doctor with us, ours havino-
gono back with the Tar, though there are, of course"
medical men at Villa Rica. Mrs. Lane, unfortunately’
was taken ill at Asuncion, and had to be left there, but
she is reported to be improving now.
Reading between the lines, one begins to see
flies on New Australia already.
What will come out of the New South Wales
political muddle no man can prophesy. Most
of the Ministers are politically homeless,
wanderers who have not where "to lay their
heads. Dibbs is leaving his present constitu-
ency and obviously has on several
electorates ; ex-Minister Barton doesn’t know
whether to stand for Potts Point and Woolloo-
mooloo or travel to Wellington and oppose
John Haynes; Copeland is in a fog, if any-
thing, and halts between Armidale and
Bombala; Slattery is to be vigorously opposed
at Burrowa by shearer Mooney. Parkes
will probably give up North Shore, and, making
a virtue of necessity, will parade his resolve to
seek out Dibbs in his lair—when he gets a lair
and fight him to the death. Cannot a good
Democrat be found to go in and beat both of
them out of Parliament ? The nrovince pines
for such a consummation. Wanted, an honest,
clean-living citizen, with brains and discretion
and no axes to grind—a man whom money could
not buy and royalty could not bribe—in many
respects the very antithesis of both Parkes and
Dibbs. Where is that man ? Nowhere !
Under new ownership and editorship Brisbane
Courier (as it says itself) is “getting along
famously” (characteristic phrase of editor F.
W. Ward). Dealing with Miss Shaw’s doctrine
that Northern Australia is for the coloured
man, the Courier says :
Is it quite certain that the native-born Australian
working-man will not. be able to successfully cope with
the northern climate? . . . Miss Shaw saw North
Queensland just after she had seen South Africa, where
the native peoples are very numerous, and the English
capitalist is a grand sort of settler. But we have yet to
see what the English working man can make of tropical
Australia. . . . If there are possibilities in the North
of establishing agricultural industries which would mean
dense settlement, we may find that white men are quite
tough enough to conquer the climate. Or it may happen
that there are considerable tracts in North Australia
which have a climate which is not prohibitory to white
labour. It is too early, anyhow, to rush to general and
unqualified conclusions upon the matter.
Good !
Writes a correspondent to The Bulletin
“I’ll will my property as I like,” snarled an ogre to
his wife as he lay in bed last New Year’s Day and signed
certain documents for his solicitor. He and his wife had
begun life on the plane of common hard work—he in a
woodyard and she at a washtub ; time flew, prosperity
came to them. They bought a wood and coal business-
he working hard, but she as hard. They bought land
built houses, let them off to tenants-he still industrious’
but she no less so. And when, at the end of forty vears
of married life, he thought last New Year’s Day that he
was about to die, he said to his wrinkled partner - “I'll
will my property as I like ” What is the good of talking
so much about fiscal theories, and Australian Federation
and Imperial Institutes and such things while the law
enables ogres like that to rob their life-long partners
simply because the partners are women and wives’ The
particular ogre referred to here has not yet died, and it is
to be hoped that before he #ets a chance to dissipate the
partnership property, as ill-will to his old co-worker and
caprice and vanity dictate, legislation will come to the
woman s aid.
Bishop Webber—a Queensland man of God
now in England trying to cadge £50,000 to fill
the Kanaka-blasted country with parsons—rises
on solemn fat legs to declare that the crying
need of Australia, is inert and women—more men
and women, myriads more men and women
Australian churches are empty, for the native-
born population won’t go; so we must import
godly people to fill them, and more parsons at
salaries to preach to the people. How, in the
name of Malthus, a population which can’t
now, as things go, find bread-and-cheese, is
going to be helped by the arrival of more popu-
lation, this apostle of common claptrap doesn’t
stop to consider. In Australia, just now, a
man without money is merely a month. Unless
Bishop Webber is prepared to fill that mouth
with something more substantial than psalms
and Scripture texts, he had better shut his own.
Two members of the Speight v. Syme jury were
seemingly convinced that the Age couldn’t go
wrong in the case. Ihey partially gave way
on a couple of counts, but each time they
nullified their votes for Speight by considering
that the pioved libel had been fair comment.
When the Age made a gratuitous false state-
ment concerning the accumulation of useless
railway stores, it was fair comment. Also, the
Age theory of a reckless increase in the cost
of each employ^—an alleged increase of £4O
per head—was held to be “fair comment” by
no less than four jurymen who agreed that the
figures were both libellous and false. Here the
finding promised much comfort for journalism.
Say that a newspaper urges the dismissal of a
certain manager of an unprosperous bank on
the public ground that banks are national in-
stitutions which, for the credit of the country,
should be made to pay. Among other “proofsi ”
of the manager’s incompetence the newspaper
declares that the average rate of salary in the
bank has been raised 30 per cent, unnecessarily.
Ibis statement, although unsupported by the
balance-sheet and unproved by the alienator,
assists towards the manager’s “ chucking out,”
He has no claim for damages against the organ
that erred in its figures. The yarn was fair
comment.
Mr. Florence O’Driscoll, M.P., writes from
the House of Commons ;—•
Dear Bulletin, —I am sorry your London correspondent
Should have misinformed you regarding ray attitude
towards the so-called “ Australian Party." lam one of
those who from the first refused to be in any way con-
nected with it, on the grounds:—
Ist. Of its non-representative character.
2nd. That those who call themselves members of the
Australian party are self-appointed.
3rd. That the people of Australia never asked any of us
to become guardians of their affairs.
4th. That irresponsible meddling with subjects about
which no detailed information or knowledge is possessed
by members of the self-appointed party, is likely to lead
to confusion and unpleasantness.
sth. That I have every confidence in the ability of the
Australians to manage their own business.
I am more than a casual visitor to Australia. I lived
there continuously from childhood until long after I had
reached manhood; some 17 years in all. My signa-
ture to a letter of condolence to Lady Tryon was
an attempted act of courtesy which no Australian
would refuse to join in offering, if requested to do so by
those who desired it should be made, and it was an act
which tew people would misconstrue.—Yours sincerely,
r lorencb O’Driscoll, London, 6th Dec. 1893.
An Australian in England writes to The
Bulletin :
About six firms of brokers monopolise the wool-selling
business of London, and it is practically impossible for a
new firm of wool-brokers to start business. These brokers
keep a check on all Australian wool—from the shed to
Loleman-street and stand by to help the squatter or the
squatter s London agent with capital at every step in the
transition of the wool. Consequently, it requires an
enormous capital to conduct the business. Apparently
the other strong argument against a new firm secur-
mg any of the trade, is that buyers pay attention
to the cachet given to a clip by the firm who are
in the habit of selling it. It is a huge monopoly,
similar to that enjoyed by stock-brokers in Paris. The
wool-sales at the Coleman-street auction-room take place
fon? to i or 8 in the evening, and the noise made by
the bidders resembles nothing more than the intermittent
yelping of a pack of fox-terriers. Most of the chief buyers
are foreigners. It is curious how all the staples of Aus-
tralia are wrapped in the tentacles of rings-in London.
Uur meat, wheat, wool, silver, and butter are sold at the
sweet will of various combinations, and until the Austra-
lian Commonwealth avoids politicians, and appoints
business men as Agents-General, it is hard to see how the
system can be altered.
Ihe Bulletin has been thinking about Coroner
Youl, of Melbourne. At the recent inquest
on Hannah M'Lennan, who jumped off the
South Melbourne pier (apparently just to spite
her recalcitrant lover, Birtles), this apostle of
a new faith observed to Birtles : “ There are
times when the truth should not be spoken.
If you will do these things you should protect a
woman’s character even if a lie is wanted.” As
the witness had just previously been sworn to
tell the truth, and severely cautioned against
evasiveness, this sort of treatment must have
depressed his spirits. No doubt there are
cases where a lie to save a woman’s sole posses-
sion (i.e., her character) is excusable, but the
province of Justice consists in criticising and
not in constructing the witness’s action or
speech. If a woman’s reputation is the first
living consideration, the perjurer who gets the
victim of blackmail hanged not only is a higher
type of civilisation than the convict, but the
aid of the iState should also be gratuitously
supplied to him to enable him to concoct and
express his lies. The Bulletin is sorry for
poor Hannah M‘Lennan. It is also sorry for
Birtles —and for Coroner Youl.
The proprietor of the Age is practically travel-
ling tile length and breadth of Victoria, once
every 24 hours, with his own hat in his hand and
a prayei for assistance on Ms lips. He asks for
donations on the ground that he is a public-
spiiited man, a sworn exposer of abuses, a
defender of the poor toiler against the fat
jobber—but Mr. DavidSyme’s appeal lias been,
all circumstances considered, the ghastliest
failure on record. No independent reader of
the Age gives it credit for high motives in its
determination to ruin Speight. The journal
that bonnetted for the Premier Building Society
crowd and gave Mat Larkin what looked
much more like sympathy than fair play
(as long as he was supposed to be only
a ten or fifteen thousand pounder) will
never be able to raise a national subscription
foi itself. Ihe Age sacrificing money upon the
altar of Duty to Society ! Where are' its ex-
posures of banking swindles and swindlers, or
its “ bold articles ” upon the scandals that have
cost Victoria untold millions in loss of moral
tone ? It may be fairly urged that the Age did
honour to the character of Speight by attack-
ing his work so persistently.

be taken in the light of an awakening and a
repentance. After all, man grasps at the unreach-

The English peeresses are becoming a very
‘ mixed ” lot. There is the Marchioness of Ailes-
bury who was Dolly Tester-the Viscountess
Hinton, future Countess Poulett, who was Lydia
Ann bheppey, ballet-dancer the Countess of
Clancarty, who was Belle Bilton—the Countess of
Orkney, who was Connie Gilchrist-the Countess
of Luston, future Duchess of Grafton, who was
the notorious Kate Cook-and, finally, the future
Duchess of Psewcastle, as May Yohe expects to
be through her marriage to Lord Francis Pelham
Clin ton-Hope, younger brother of the present
childless and invalid duke. The Viscountess
Hinton is a peeress in strange circum-
stances. Her husband’s father, Earl Poulett
while quite a youngster, had a flirtation with
the daughter of a coast-pilot, and after a few
weeks was compelled to marry her at the point
of a pistol held by her irate father. Six months
later she gave birth to the Viscount Hinton, whom
Bord Poulett never recognised as his son : but as
the law recognised that relationship, the earl is
using every effort to alienate and ruin the estate
which he must transmit to the present viscount.
1 he latter thought at first that he could soften the
old gentleman s heart, and supported himself for
some years by acting as a pantomimist and clown
under an assumed name. But, that failing him,
he began issuing post-obits to the extent of his
ability, and spent the proceeds like water. It was
during this time that he married Lydia Ann
bheppey a ballet-dancer, and at present the Vis-
counfi and Viscountess Hinton and their progeny

A company whose intentions are evidently
honourable—said company consisting principally
of Messrs. Walton and Howe and Miss Hilda
Spong—produced “The Grip of Iron” at Sydney
Royal on Saturday. This unpleasantly designated
drama takes its name from the big paws of the
boss strangler—an affable person who goes round
choking people by hand. When this fact dawns
on the public a good deal of the interest drops out
of the piece. The swollen head and the staring
eyes and the out-hanging tongue of the strangled
person are not actually visible, but none the less
they seem to pervade things generally, and, more-
over, the strangler constantly shakes his shapeless
extremities horribly above his head, until they
seem to suggest an octopus giving three cheers and
whirling his tentacles. This blood-boltered per-
sonage is a respectable, middle-aged law-clerk who
suffocates his patients by night or in the dewy
morning, and pursues his legal avocations during
the day. Among the various anomalies of his
character the most remarkable is the unreasoning
manner in which he marries his pet daughter to
his partner and fellow ghoul, in the blessed hope
that they will live happily for ever after-
wards. Then he bestows on the pair the pro-
ceeds of a long and honourable career of stran-
gulation, and being convicted in his respectable
top-bat and his green spectacles he starts for New
Caledonia. But on the way he learns from a
fellow-passenger, who has been convicted on per-
jured evidence, that his daughter is being habitu-
ally dragged round by the hair in the mansion
which was bought with his money, and the tiger
wakens within him, and he runs amok all over the
ship and goes overboard. Then it transpires that
the fellow-convict is the strangler’s former son-in-
law ; they arrive at the mansion just as the
daughter has been butchered in evening dress by
her husband, and the curtain falls as the strangler
chokes his old partner and laughs a maniacal
laugh while he treads on the tail of the corpse’s
coat.
* * *
There are several strange discrepancies in
the story, which hangs together rather badly in
places, but no one takes much notice of them. The
great flat hands of the strangler overshadow
everything else, and when he whirls them in the
air, slab-fashion, they are an awesome spectacle.
Walter Howe’s rendering of this part is far above
his usual average; he is consistently gruesome,
and somehow suggests the gentle gorilla when he
has captured his enemy, and proceeds to flap him to
death with his large, moist palms. t Geo. Walton’s
detective is a gay but unconvincing burlesque, and
Miss Hilda Spong, with a small and unsatisfactory
part, is chiefly remarkable for a swoon which is
done at an unhappy angle and presents nothing of
the lady, save her boot-soles, to the audience.
The rest of the company, with the exception of
Mrs. Trve Hayman, consists of a number of de-
pressing individuals who struggle hard against the
burden of their own identities, but with compara-
tively little result. The fellow-ghoul is foolishly
addicted to giving his name at house-doors while his
mate is strangling the house-father inside, and to
leaving the plunder lying around in insecure
places. The lawyer is abjectly credulous. Thede-
tective has an idiotic habit of shouting “ white-
wash,” for no earthly purpose ; and the horizon of
the stormy sea has a sharp corner in it which is
not true to nature, unless nature has got badly
bent since The Bulletin last saw her.

Good old “ Maritana ” was roused out of
her repose last Saturday to do another turn of
service at Sydney Opera House. The general
verdict was that the ancient opera is still going
strong for its years, but, at the same time, it needs
a pretty long spell at grass in between each ap-
pearance. “Maritana” is more a reminiscence
than anything else —a thing thatawakens pleasant
memories in the old, hairless father, and makes
him think of days that have departed. Mr. Jules
Simonsen’s Don Caesar is sung in excellent style,
and even the old, old wail about that tattered
cavalier’s desire to fall upon a plain sounds almost
like a new wail under the influence of his fine
tenor voice. As for Mr. Simonsen’s acting, it
takes care of itself in a somewhat ramshackle
fashion, and gets through anyhow. Edward
Farley’s Don Jose is the same grand old baritone
villain as in past days. Maritana, by Miss
Colborne Baber, is a somewhat uneven character
who pursues her melody over merged country;
and that small, bright maid. Miss E. Lam-
bert, is a specially picturesque Lazarillo, with
a voice which will some day deserve a front
seat among the choirs of Paradise. The Bul-
letin’s views about that discouraging despot, the
King of Spain, are regretfully suppressed. The
“Grand Duchess ” follows to-morrow (Friday).

There is still no news about the with-
drawal of “ Charley’s Aunt,” which seems likely
to fill the Criterion for some weeks yet. “ A Bad
Penny,” the one-act episode which serves as a cur-
tain-raiser, also pursues its lamentable way up to
date. It is a brief story concerning a beery wreck
who calls and truculently demands his daughter,
and not getting her he weeps tears of cheap gin
upon the piano, and gathering up his exploded hat
goes out into the stormy world and comes back no
more—never any more. The rest of the party
stand and listen as the flap of his torn boot-soles
is heard upon the stair, and when, at last, they
shuffle into the unrecognisable distance the curtain
goes down, and the purposeless little item is
ended. It isn’t even well acted, and the pathos of
it is all embodied in that sound of departing feet
and broken boots upon the stair.

“Beauty and the Beast” is still filling
Sydney Lyceum to the doors, and its oppressive
gorgeousness apparently hasn't even begun to pall.
The rival show, “Jack, the Giant Killer,” at Her
Majesty’s, will be withdrawn in another week or
two, though no date has yet been fixed. Then
that good old story, which never becomes al-
together old, of how G. Kignold was unjustly
accused, through the machinations of A. Norman,
of bigamy with violence, or horse-stealing in the
third degree, and how he nobly bore up against
the charge in an attic, and finally cleared his
■character and came back to the moated grange,
while Norman was arrested in his fatally-beautiful
bat, will begin to be told once more —The Bulle-
tin trusts with profitable results,

An ultra-fashionable concert is to be held
at Sydney Town Hall, on February 2, in aid of
the almost destitute children of the late Mr. and
Mrs. La Meslee, who were so unhappily drowned
by the foundering of the Ripple. The arrange-
ments are in good hands. Mr. \V. Ridley, of the
Government Statistician’s Dept., is treasurer ; W.
H. R. Cherry and J. P. Gandon are hon. secs.,
and M. Albin Villeval is musical organiser.
Among the artists who have promised their ser-
vices are Misses Colbourne Baber, Josephine
Deakin and Cecily Staunton, and of the inferior
sex, Messrs. Kowalski, Wiegand, Henri Staell
(violinist), Edgar Strauss (cellist), Claudius Des-
louis, William Walshe, Frank Adams (a new
English tenor), Harry Fitzmaurice, J. T. Dono-
van, and Alec. Edward. The proceedings are under
the patronage of Governor and Lady Duff, Mayor
Manning, Premier Dibbs and Ministry, Critchetb
Walker, all the Foreign Consuls, and everybody
who is anybody, or thinks he is. •

“True Metal,’' a long, rambling melo-
drama of the poor but honest kind, had a gracious
reception at Melbourne Alexandra on Saturday.
It moved a bit stiffly for want of more rehearsal
and stage management; an incidental mule tried
to back its cart into the Thames, and a terrific
thunderstorm was out of gear, but such troubles
are peculiar to first nights. A boy in the rag-and-
bone line gives touches of frowsy nature to this
production, and sends the smell of the rubbish-
box across the footlights. He also acts as a
moral antidote to a pair of dingy outcasts who
live by conspiring against the hero, the hero being
an unsober nephew, with little to recommend him
beyond his chivalry in “ shouting ” a new donkey
for the boy aforesaid. A millionaire villain is
remarkable for alwpys waiting round the corner
to arrange more plots with bis dingy minions,
whilst uncle Frank Cates, in holy orders, and an
elderly miller, with a daughter who loves her
young man at intervals, are each and all of them
remarkable for nothing in particular. Murderers
are conspicuous by their absence, neither is the
bitter cry of betrayed womanhood heard in the
land. “True Metal” deals for the most part
with meat-bones, furtive pen’orths of gin and
pangs of hunger. Food is so scarce in the second
act that a ravenous old female would eat rats if
she could catch them, and her husband’s mouth
waters at the mention of cold black beetles.
Dramas written for the East End of London
audiences seem to grow more hungry, homeless
and bare-footed every year, whereby hangs a
moral. Miss Dora Mostyn is a complete success
as the rag and refuse boy, her sniff of recognition
when she comes across some bones that she has
met before being true art. Dan Barry and Miss
Sydney make a convincing couple of dead-beats,
and the hero, a smaller edition of ’Gustus Glover
in voice and bearing, has the finest “stouching”
method of any man on the Australian stage, He
aims one lightning blow with his left, and the
object of attack appears to be knocked out clean.
Several other people, including very minor
characters, do credit to the piece, which, like its
predecessor, would be unendurable if not natural-
ised by a fair all-round company.

Pantomimes are still prospering. The
Royal show, so far from being eclipsed by the
firm’s more expensive spectacle, is in a fair way to
become known as the cheeriest and most indefatig-
able panto, seen in Melbourne these last six years.
Maggie Moore, Martyn Hagan and the rest of the
company, without exception, work like people who
have one common end in view. A spirit of humour
pervades the latter half of the proceedings, where
new ideas —one new idea is better than ten
new costumes—blossom in the wilderness from
time to time. R. Stewart, senr., as a pagan
emperor, is a genial influence, and the harle
quinade is a brief burst of activity, terminating in
a general fall off the roof. “Sinbad the Sailor ”
seems to draw larger audiences now than it could
tempt into the house a fortnight ago. Saturday’s
matinee will be for the benefit of Garnet Walch,
and a fresh lot of songs in place of some that are
getting sung out is promised for the evening
performance.
«« « «
At the Princess’ they are still suffering
from the belief that success is a mere question of
cash outlay—a satisfactory faith as long as the
public continue to accept it, and the bubble
reputation remains intact. Here the opening
scenes are the best, and gilded dullness is the rule
for the last hour or two. Perhaps “Red Riding
Hood ” touches its lowest depth of inanity
about 9.30 p.m. when the flow of proces-
sions is interrupted to permit of the wolf and
fox interviewing Violet Yarley. The times when
this pantomime grows anyway funny are few
indeed. Also, they are solely dependent upon
Courtneidge, whose “ fat ” is none too greasy, and
whose disposition to raise a laugh receives no en-
couragement from his surroundings. A man in
skirts must have lively individuals to play up to
him, or, at least, meet him half-way. A monkey
performance by one Pongo, said to be the wire-
jumper’s brother, was introduced a few nights
ago, and wisely abandoned the night following.

X.L.: “ Wyhert ReeVe lectures, or rather preaches, on
Church and Stage, with the usual familiar nonsense,
against which may be set off the explicit declarations of
Clement Soott anil F. C. Burnand —that the stage is more
corrupt than ever. The best thing is to leave this stupid
amalgamation alone. Reeve is as ineffective as Rev. Mar-
shall —Bentley’s champion—merely begging the question,'
because the Laker (as Thespians are called in Coomber-
land) was Scotch. Wyhert goes on the same absurd tack,
constructing an ideal drama with the Melh. public run-
ning after Mrs. Siddons, instead of Miss Shankerini. Per-
haps there is no such tiling as sin—but, if there is, it is
curled round the good old drama.”
“ Bothwell,” which Swinburne published in ’74, is the

Maria Jones, the deceased Gaiety “old woman,” was
breaking up when she left Australia some 15 months ago.
Her fat was of the dropsical order, and her incidental
diseases were many, yet she appeared a jolly, wholesome
sort of soul upon the stage. The “boys and girls” of
the Gaiety Co. affected to think that Maria was old enough
to be the mother of them all (which she was not), and
dutifully presented her with a gold watch before she
sailed.
Melbourne Age, in a burst of renewed friendship
towards the Princess’s panto., published a yarn about the
“distressing position ” of an acrobatic performer, whose
foot got caught in a rope loop when he was on the point
of lowering himself to the stage after completing his act.
This incident was painted in high colours, and with the
Age’s broadest brush. The audience, unaware of the
man’s awful danger, applauded his entangled foot, “but
those who realised the true state of affairs ” trembled for
the consequences of his being “kept long in a position
with his head down 11!” After a few seconds, “anxious
seconds,” the suspended person disposed of the loop
“ with a lucky kick, and came to the stage as quickly as
possible.” The enthusiastic reporter on the thrilling ad-
vertisement lay is indeed funny. What’s the matter with
an acrobat who remains hanging with his head down
awhile? One of the Silbons seldom hangs any other way.

way, a melancholy thing. [ltalian operatic romance

hammer. Under the fierce glare of the concert platform,
romantic illusion vanished with a screech. Caruson, in a

one. Giraud looked a very ordinary person oppressed
with the conviction that he had no business to be there
at all, and didn’t know what to do with his hands.

night—in fine, any beautiful unwritten poem called into
silent life by the highest poetry of motion.” Yum 1
Charles Coghlan and an actress of flippant reputation

stopped in front of them, and Mrs. CJoghlan, the actor’l
wife, jumped out and faced the culprits. Without turn-
ing a hair, Mr. Coghlan looked at his wife inquiringly for

Arthur Garner is going to establish a first-class music-

alike to young and old, and one that can he witnessed
without bringing a blush to the cheek of the m< st
modest of her sex. It is impossible to convey to the
untravelled and narrow-minded critics the rapid strides
made during the past few years in the artistic and social
position of this branch of the profession. The buildings
are handsome and well-ventilated theatres, surrounded
with comfort, and luxurious in their appointments. Men
of respectability are no longer afraid to take their wives
and families, and even Royalty itself has given its patron-
age. The atmosphere no lomrer reeks with the fumes of
stale beer and rank tobacco, but all interest is centred In
the stage, where a constant succession of trained artisla
receives the well-merited applause of the delighted spec-
tators. It is on these lines that I propose establishing a
musio-hall in Sydney.” Nice news for the theatres.

was born in New York. While still a child she made
frequent appearances on the stage in variety performances
with her parents in the mining-camps of California ami

Robert Fulford, and when they returned to ’Frisco they
both became members of a local stock company. In 1878,
she appeared in the title-rdle of a dramatization of Bret
Harte’s “M’liss," which proved popular for a decade or
more, and six years ago she found another success in
“The Deacon’s Daughter. She tried comic opera in ’91,
but without success.
Dear Bulletin,— Last week, ending Dec. 10, in Edin-
burgh, there were showing in that city no less than seven
well-known Australians, the majority of them occupying
prominent positions. At the Theatre Royal were W. J.
Montgomery playing Andreas, Theodora’s lover, in
Sardou’s famous drama ; and Frank Gerald (late Gerald
and Duff) playing the part of Marcellus and stage-
managing. Associated with the same company were Mr.
Clinton Baddeley, formerly of M.L., and old Charlie
Bischner in the front of the house. Hard at woik re-
hearsing for the Panto, was Mr. Forbes Dawson, another
Maorilander, while at the Empire Palace, a most gorgeous
structure, the stars of the show were Fred Millis (the
Australian ventriloquist) and H. Atkinson, the Australian
Orpheus._ A week or two previous, in the course of half-
an-hour in the Strand, I met Joe MacMahon, J. F. Sheri-
dan, Johnny Rodgers, Penstone (artist), Herbert Flem-
ming, Erskine Scot and Mrs. Scot(Miss Florence Seymour),
and Johnny Gilmore.—Yours, &c., Frank Gerald.

Tenor Giraud cares not if his clothes are thrown on
with a pitchfork and tied with string, so long as they are
pretty and bright. No fancy colours like “elephant’s
breath,” or “ eau de nil plain red and yaller are quite
good enough for him. His pet aversion is reporters ; the
sight of one puts him in a fury. He strides his room
shouting: “Ha! bastard!” and stabbing them with’a
dagger, or slashing their throats with his sword.
Caruson cannot sing if a button or a spangle is missing

over and she has all she wants, she struts complacent Iv
and sings—with a voice like a woodpecker who lias found
a rich lode of grubs.

A letter written by the condemned wo main
Frances Knorr, has been published by the Vic.
authorities. The object of the letter is to warn
others, and “to act as a strong deterrent.” The
letter bears evidence on its face of having been
manufactured at the instigation of somebody. A
woman of Knorr’s education and position would
never talk about “strong deterrents.” Such
phrases belong to the lingo of the Penal Depart-
ment, and characterise the letter as a fraud.
Who worded the letter for her? When you
have a helpless woman stuck up in a rat-trap you
can get her to do anything. Probably the same
source that brought forth certain confessions
brought forth this deliciously fraudulent attempt
to pass off this letter as a letter voluntarily issuing
from the condemned.

The A.M.P. Society has decided in future to
estimate the probable average rate of interest on invest-
ments at 3i per cent, instead of 4 per cent., as heretofore.
This will necessitate an increase of reserves and a tem-
porary reduction in the bonus rates, but the reduction
will probably only last a very few years, and in view of
the steady reduction in interest rates throughout
Australia, the wisdom of the proceeding is unquestion-
able. Another wise innovation is the placing of male and
female lives on the same footing. Hitherto women have
been charged a higher rate than men, according to an
old-time English theory that the risks of maternity made
them a specially dangerous speculation. In Australia,
however, women, on the average, live longer than men,
and experience proves that the extra charge should rather
be put on the other sex.

The long-postponed drawing in connection with
the “Mutual Freehold Property Distribution Society of
Sydney ” came off, in a mildly unobtrusive fashion,
on Friday (January 12). The alleged big prize—a
block of buildings at the corner of Park and Castle-
reagh-streets, Sydney—was dropped out of the lottery,
and so were 3000 other prizes, the biggest thing
left in being valued at a humble £5O. The
whole distribution consisted of £2230 worth of
property divided into 206 prizes, of an average value of
£ll. To the far-off investor the joy of getting £ll worth
of land, which, if realised by forced sale in a depressed
market,’ would probably only realise £6 or so, is
not very thrilling, especially if the happy winner
travels far to see his property, and puts up at a
hotel while he is looking for a purchaser. The
hundred investors who have got £5 worth of land
apiece will probably find the estate hardly worth calling
for—it is a depressing thing to win £5 worth of land
these times, and the lottery which gives out such things
is a miserable irony. The society professes to have dis-
posed of a trifle over 2000 tickets, which, in a concern of
145,000 tickets, is a painful breakdown. Further, the
“ad.” stated persistently for months that the prizes were
“largely rent-producing," and it would be interesting to
know just how rent-producing a £5 allotment can be—or
even a £5O allotment, for that matter. Taking it all
round, the “ Mutual Freehold Property Distribution
Society of Sydney” is about the most unsatisfactory thing
of its kind The Bclletix ever met with.

A large Australian institution has decided that
in future the managing director is to get £lOOO per
annum; the other directors—four of them—£l2s each ;
the manager, £500; and the auditors each £lO 10s. a
year. How much supervision is likely to be got for ten
guineas, and how much a £lO 10s. auditor is likely to
find out about the possible irregularities of a £lOOO
manager, are points that the shareholders can seriously
consider when the liquidation comes along. When £2OOO
worth of board wants to be watched by only £2l worth of
auditor it suggests several hundred things which need
not be further alluded to.
# # #
The New Oriental Bank, which was supposed
to have burst on strictly square principles and to be an
instance of purely undeserved misfortune, appears to be
pretty much like any other insolvent bank. There is talk
now of £1,000,000 which was advanced to rotten com-
panies, and there were personal loans of a wild kind
on shady securities —one set of influential people, for
instance, borrowed £BO,OOO, part of which, at least, is
among ttie bad debts, Also, there was much riotous in-
vestment in gorgeous premises and much opening of
unprofitable branches out of a mere desire to get ahead of
some other bank. The report of this eminent British
institution begins to read just like that of an Australian
land boom bank in liquidation, when Simpson is over-
hauling the accounts.

The lamentable Metropolitan Bank (Melbourne)
is now expected to produce just about 6d. in the £ for its
creditors—perhaps a trifle less. This is the awful institu-
tion which, a few months ago, some sanguine boomers
wanted to reconstruct on the ground that it was too
valuable a bank to be wasted. The shareholders, of
course, get nothing. The busted Metropolitan Bank and
the equally busted Metropolitan Building Society were
tangled up together in an unearthly fashion, and the bank
premises—vaguely estimated to be worth£l33,ooo—which
were “ taken over" from the Building Society, were, it is
now alleged, never legally transferred at all, because the
board, or somebody, quite forgot to attend to the matter.
Therefore, the shareholders of the Society are now thinking
of seizing the building and throwing the “ bank" into the
street without compensation. Also, the bottom has
utterly fallen out of £500,000 of other Metropolitan
“assets,” and the whole affair seems to be so hollow as to
be hardly worth liquidating.
There is something picturesque about the
Metropolitan’s style of hanking, though it isn’t much
more picturesque than the ordinary boom-bank system.
Taking them all round, the accounts seem to have been
kept by a Chinaman writing with his foot dipped in tar,
and the “securities” appear to have been mostly pre-
served in the coal-scuttle, and Qehazi, the auditor, appar-
ently look things pretty much for granted.
* « *
The N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.,
which has been already suspended for six months, is
further hung up till a meeting to be held in February,
the reconstruction having made no visible progress. The
present troubles of the L. and M. arise out of too much
brilliant financing. It owes money, first, to its current
account customers ; secondly, to its fixed depositors and
ordinary debenture holders; thirdly, to a set of special
mortgage debenture holders who, in 1892, advanced
£1,300,000 on the strength of an extra copper-fastened
lien on the uncalled capital; and, lastly, to the 8.N.Z.,
which is secured by the deposit of tangible property. The
ordinary debenture-holders are just beginning to realise
for the first time that they only come third in the eventof
liquidation, and are sour and disagreeable in consequence.
The holdersof theextracopper-fasteneddebentures, having
a lien on all the uncalled capital, won’t allow any of it to
be > called up except to pay their debentures, because if
it is called up for any other purpose it will diminish their
security'. And as for the Bank of N.Z., it positively
declines to listen to the voice of the charmer and give up
or vary its securities under any conditions. The brilliant
financier who tied up the great Loan and Mercantile in
all these hard knots now sits somewhere and knocks flies
off his ear with his hind leg, and considers hard upon the
situation.

The Melbourne bankruptcy returns for 1893 are
interesting reading. There were 51 compositions regis-
tered during the year, and 487 sequestrations, the total
liabilities being £3,362,945. This doesn’t include the
fearful and wonderful schedule of Miss Elizabeth
Spence: “Liabilities, £2512; assets, £3,772,408 ; surplus,
£3,769,896,” which is probably left out on the ground
that it is a purely humorous item. Also, it doesn’t
include several hundred “ liquidations,” covering several
millions of alleged assets and liabilities. The compositions
include three oases where Id. in the £ was paid on
£185,861; one instance of 2d. in the £ upon £11,950; five
of 3d. in the £ on £189.217; eleven of Od. in the £on
£279,016 ; one of Bd. in the £ ; three of 9d.; thirteen of Is.'
one of Is. IJd.; four of Is. 6d.; one of 25.; two of 2s. 6d.*
one of 35.; one of 3s. 6d.; one of 75.; and one of 19s. 6d.’
These last were all for small amounts; the big boomers
never went beyond Is. 6d, How the liquidations and the
sequestrations will turn out will be accurately known
about ten years hence. When the whole account is made
up it will probably be found that in 1893 Victoria went
broke for about ten millions, and paid eighteenpenoe in
the £ all round.

The further indictment of Matthias Larkin
seems to have run airainst a snag. Every Melbourne
fraud-charge is in danger of encountering strange
obstacles these times.
A peculiar paragraph re Matthew Davies
appeared in a Melbourne daily last week. It was to the
effect that Mr. Walsh, Q. 0., “the Crown Prosecutor to
whom the depositions in the Mercantile Bank case were
delivered in the earlier part ot December," had just
started to consider whether Matthew and co. ought, or
ought not, to be gent to a jury. Phe-e-ew I At this point
the intelligent reader is expected to express his feelings

A Bendigo meeting lias re-opened the question
of preference share representation in Bank of Victoria
management. Under existing articles of association the
unfortunates who are compelled to hold £lO preference
shares can t assert themselves against those original
shareholders who are keeping their bank going with other
people s money. Six hundred and seventy-four ordinary
shareholders carry 3678 votes, whilst 2950 preference
partners in the concern have only 1688 voles among them.
Xhe arrangement is a monstrous scandal on the face of it
but nearly all reconstructions were faked on similar lines.
People dragged into the proprietary against their will
made no attempt to take up their proper position as chief
shareholders. The common or garden species of depositor
lost his head and was treated as the merest juggins in
the matter. 6

Dear Bulletin, —Be the losses of that big firm
and other similar matters, the “How was it managed?" is
easily answered. In the fat times I was a member of a sweet
little land-syndicate of about a dozen. Hard faces every
one. We would laugh at the idea of anyone finessing us.
Well, we took our manager, treasurer, and secretary from
the counter of a finance company, where he was earning
his £2OO a year, and gave him £6OO. He was a keen,
smart young fellow, and just suited us. Now, our
transactions, though big, were not numerous, and we
were all auditors, so to speak. That is, one or
the other was continually dropping into the office,
? ■ Pf e P 1,1 K uito the books, watching one another in a
friendly sort of way. What possible chance would you
that sweet young man had of working a point?
Yet, in eighteen months, he managed to “pinch" to
the extent of just on three thousand. He had a
duplicate pass-book, bill-book, ledger, everything. Also
an innocent method of attaching the butts of the paying-
in slips (forged) to the pass-book, and we simply kicked
ourselves when we kicked him out of the office. If with
us, mind you, who all fancied ourselves “smarties," and a
.airly controllable account, how much easier with hi®*
concerns with tens of thousands of yearly cash trans-
actions? At pres nt, city skilled auditors are worked
to death, so great is the scare. But I can point to
dozens of huge concerns, whose balance-sheets for years
have been made up in their own offices. One colossal
place especially has not had an outside audit for six years.

The S.M.H. has advanced in a leader some
brilliant new ideas on diamond-mining. Cablegrams, Capt.
Rogers, and Streeter’s visit have hypnotised the Herald.'
“ Diamond-mining here is nothing in comparison with the
Cape.” Very true. “ But we do not know what Tingha
Inverell and Bingera have to reveal when the workings
are transferr d to syndicates which can test the ground.”
Another wholesome truth. “We do not know what
quantities of diamonds may not exist ; where some have
come from there may be other and better diamonds."

worst of all bad luck, no co. has yet been formed in Lon-
don. Streeter pbre, says of the Bingera diamonds that he
hopes for the best, but it is almost impossible to cut these
stones. And that, so far, he can find no one to contract
for cutting quantities.

ing is being done on the West Coast, all ore being sent to
other ports for treatment. This is against the field, as the
price of bags, sewing, handling, &0., is a big expense.
Local smelting will yet be a necessity. Two smelters were
erected in the boom days, but both have been liquidated
long since. The December shipment of ore from Mount
Lyell is worth £3OO per ton. This is shipped direct to

In “ Barabbas,” Marie Corelli deliberately
appropriates the original idea of W. W. Story’s
great poem, “A Roman Lawyer in Jerusalem,”
his argument being that Judas betrayed Christ in
order that the latter’s divinity should at once be
made manifest. Corelli put this idea into the
mouth of Judith Iscariot, an apocryphal sister of
Judas, whoso influences him. Nat hi ess, Corelli
scores sometimes. Peter, raving at Judith over
the body of Judas, cries: ‘“God forbid that I
should show any mercy to the wicked ! ’ ‘ There
spoke the first purely human Christian! ’ mur-
mured a low, satirical voice,”
Dear Bulletin,— Re ivet sheep disputes in
shearing sheds. I was rather amused at “ Angle-
dool’s” statement that ‘‘some shearers vote
against their own opinions (re wet sheep) to further
what they imaginejto be the boss’s interests, viz., to
get shearing over quickly.” I can recall many in-
stances of some shearers voting ‘‘wet sheep” while
at the hut, and immediately afterwards, under the
boss’s eye, voting “ dry sheep.” The man in that
case, evidently, was fearful of incurring the boss’s
displeasure. That is one kind of “wet sheep”
shearer. There are generally one or two of him in
every shed. Another kind is one who has his
name in another shed following the one he is in.
Still another is the grab-all. Another—the
“ cdckey,” who wants to get home to dig his acre
of potatoes. Again the one—“ I’ll shear if anyone
else will”—sort of chap. Then he whom Mr.
Kitely llwing has wisely sent a long way from
his (the shearer’s) own locality, by train, and who
is obliged to work a dead-horse—his fare—and
then graft to get something for himself. This
latter variety is a recent addition to the “wet-
sheep ” shearing fraternity. I have found all these
and many more in my time, as a shearer, but have
yet to meet “ Angledool’s ” specimen. I have
seen bales put down twice, in the wool-press, to
squeeze all the water possible from the wool.—

About 20 years ago, at
Bendigo, a certain young
man hearo Jiev. Charles
Clark lecture on Dickens.
When the accomplished pro-
prietor of the childlike alto
voice reached the climax of
pathos in the “Death of
Little Nell,” he was seem-
ingly overcome by emotion,
and, taking from between his
well-ironed broadcloth and
his spotless shirt a little
snow-white handkerchief, he
slowly, sorrowfully, wiped
his eye. And then the
writer, who was a miner,
and bad no little, white
handkerchief to absorb the
tears which then welled up,
furtively wiped his eye,
partly on his grimy coat-
sleeve and partly with the
raspy back of his wrinkled
hand. That pathetic dis-
course was so sweet a memory
that when Parson Clark
again visited Australia two
or three years ago the scribe
went to hear him discourse
on Dickens once more. And
behold! at the very same
place the pathetic parson
wiped his eye again with
apparently the very same
snow-white handkerchief fur-
tively withdrawn from the
self-same recess between the
broadcloth and the fine linen.
But this time the writer
didn’t weep. He could have
slain that parson with a
brick. The pathos was all
in the business —it had been
there for 20. solid years.
There are but two fc>in-

Buick, member for Wairoa,

the foremost local platform
speakers. Buick is a car-
penter by trade, and about
27 years of age. O’Regan is
24, and of magnificent phy-
sique. Three months ago he
was working as a railway
navvy, and threw down his
tools to become editor of a
Reefton paper. His attitude
on the platform recalls
pugilist Slavin; and the swaying of his arms,
his erect pose, and the earnest expression of
his countenance, all seem to convey the impression
that if anyone in the audience isn’t pleased with
Mr. O’Regan’s talk, he can “get satisfaction the
other way.”
The disappearance at sea, between Melb.

It is related of a certain eloquent’N.S.W.

and, after meandering about in all directions, the
happy thought occurred to him to hang his watch

he happened to get back to the same spot. Ho

Some years ago there was a
duel fought in Sydney. Charley
P , who had returned some time
from Fiji, was in a city bar when
the late Mick Pender entered and
wanted to know what he meant
by being there, threatening to
throw him out. This Mick could
•easily have done, as he was a big
man not averse to pugilism, while
P was a particularly little
fellow. P allowed that Pender
could throw him out, and suggested
that pistols would put them on an
equality. To this Pender at once
agreed. So pistols were procured
and loaded, and, as they could
hardly fight where they were, they
agreed to hire a trap and drive to
a suburban hotel and there engage
a room to kill each other in. it
was dark when they started. Mick
■drove. During the drive Charley
■came to the conclusion that she
wasn’t worth it, and, as he had
charge of the pistols, determined to
draw the bullets-which lie did.
They duly arrived at their destina-
tion, engaged a room and locked
the door. Much to Charley’s sur-
prise some plaster fell from the
wall an inch or two from his head.
iSomehow or other a missile had
been left in Mick Pender’s pistol.

Among the letters for which young Tenny-
son scours the world are the few (one lost) which
Parkes, of Australia, received from the dead

Newly-knighted Jenkin Coles, Speaker of
the S.A. Assembly, has been serenaded and pre-

ment paid him.
Parkes, whose converse of late runs greatly
■of himself, observed a week or so ago that he
would rather be known as a third-rate poet than
as a first-rate politician; and on a member of the

man added, “And I would rather be dumb than

Boyle Travers Finniss, who died on
Christmas Eve, was one of South Australia’s

Cardinal Moran, we read, strongly favours
private charity and objects to the public free
breakfast. The Cardinal is right. The public
free breakfast is an institution whereat the
hungry man’s stomach publicly jumps upon his
self-respect. It is as odious an institution as the
ancient convict iron-gang working on the highway
right under the eyes of free men.
The son of Julius Vogel was a member of
Captain Wilson’s party of brigands, recently
wiped out by the Matabele. Fate has been very
rough on Julius of late, and this last blow will
probably about finish the gritty old man. Poor
old Vogel has always advocated capital punish-
ment for murder. The Matabele, it seems, prac-
tise capital punishment for attempted theft.
Friedrich Emil Heinrich Wulf Krichauff,
one of the retiring members of S.A. Legislative
Council, who seeks re-election, is a true democrat,
He first entered p arliament as member for Mount
Bark in 18 57„ the fi rst Assembly under con-
stitutional Govt.-and even in those far-away
days he advocated Protection, payment of mein-
bers, and the liberalisation of the land laws. He
used to walk backwards and forwards to Adelaide
to attend to his Legislative duties, a distance of
25 miles each way. He resigned his seat in March,
1858, but in 1870 came back to the Lower House
for Onkaparinga, and he again resigned in 1882
because of a projected visit to Germany. In the
interim he had been member of a Ministry which
F. E. H. W. KRICHAUEF, M.L.C.
lasted 19 days. In 1884, Mr. Krichauff was once
more in the Assembly, this time as member for
Victoria, in which capacity he acted for six years.
In June, ’9O, he stood for the Council, and beat
all opponents; and now, despite a weight of more
than 70 years, he is in the field again with excel-
lent prospects of success. The Germans, the
farmers, and the Labour bodies will all support
him, for he is the real father of the Homestead
Block Movement in South Australia, and has
always voted on the side of the People.
Mrs. White, High Priestess of the Second
Adventists, in America, is the star of the Brighton,

watchguard outside, and has much the best tent,
on the principle of the Canterbury Archbishop, or
Pastor Bevan at the Chautauquake.
Australians who have seen Melba lately
say she is not careful of her voice. Instead of
dining off a raw egg and a spoonful of salad oil, or
whatever is the correct diet for song-birds, goii g
to bed when off duty at 7.30, and generally having
a worse time than if she were a boarding-school
governess, she attends receptions of all kinds, and
eats and drinks what she likes. But “the gods
are just,” &e., and Melba is not singing nearly as
well as she did this time last year.
One of Rudyard Kipling's “ other stories.”
At Simla, a dignified veteran Colonel, familiarly
greeted by a peacocky young globe-trotter as
“ Old Chappie!” sarcastically replied, “ Old, per-
haps, but Chappie, , never, sir!” This was
overheard, and passed into a local colloquialism.
People used the phrase whenever they could drag
it in by the shoulders, until it stumbled on a
catastrophe. There was singing and piano-playing
one night in a bungalow, and the oil-lamp went
out abruptly. Witticisms scintillated in the dark.
The Major’s daughter, sweet, single, 17, made
some stupid ventriloquial remarks. “ One of the

POINTS.
J.P.: Judicious politicians.
M.L.C.: Most likely a capitalist.
Queensland Kanakas have U 18,641 in the
Govt. Savings Bank.
The Vic. Government provided a private
secretary to Robert Reid’s blessed “ mission !”
The only difficulty with labour-saving
machinery is, it saves the labour of the wrong
man. —Ex.
“ The idle and indolent poor are not half
so dangerous to society as the idle and indolent
rich.” —Ex.
The people will rule in this country when-
ever a majority become hungry. The brains of
man are in his stomach. — American.
G. H. Reid's indecision re the justice of a
progressive land t ix, is regarded as the weakest
note of leadership he has yet sounded.
Many medical men are offering themselves
as candidates tor N.S.W. Parliament. But no
practising medico ever made a name in politics.
The Argus : “ Speight testimonial fund”
committee “ deem it advisable not to publish the
names of subscribers.” Why? They would be
interesting.
S.A. Advertiser claims that in Australia
“no class is endowed by the State with special
privileges. The laws are free and equal.”
Immortal perjury!
“ What shall I say of the philosopher
Sohleiermacher, now he has become a Knight of
the Third Class of the Red Eagle ? He used to
be an Eagle himself.” — Heine.
The admirable series of papers, “ Organisa-
tions of the Discontented,” by George Black,
M.L.A. (N.S. W.), have been reprinted by the
Twentieth Century (New York.)
The National Ass paper run in Adelaide
is always sure of a circulation of 1000. The local
Employers Union pays for that number ostensibly
“ for circulation amongst friends.”
“The sudden change in votes does not
prove that the masses have changed their minds.
They have no minds to change. The people as a
mass do not think at all. They simply feel.” —
Exchange.
N.S.W. will spontaneously support the
leader of its Labour-party if he will demand to
know the amount of public money spent on enter-
taining, directly and indirectly, the person
called Mackenzie Bowell.
Several N.S.W, “temporary” civil ser-
vants have held their billets continuously this last
20 years. According to the C.S. Act a temporary
appointment endures only for two years, but
Ministers reappoint and reappoint.
At Albury (N.S.W.), two Chinamen have
bJen fined £2lOO each (or two years’ gaol) for
evading the poll-tax. Thus does Australia strain
at the gnat, while Chinese junks land a hundred
camels every month on the coast near Port
Darwin.
“ Australian engineer and artillery officers
an to be ineligible for commissions in Great
B. itain until a military training college has been
established in Australia similar to the Canadian
one.” The wedge of Imperial Federation is being
driven in.
Three candidates have been mentioned as
1 Uely to stand for Melb. Eastern suburbs, the late
stron Jiuld of Duncan Gillies. This trio of “likely
men ”is a sad matter to reflect upon. Prank
Madden, barrister; Jim Moloney, attorney; Dillon,
late manager of the Standard Bank—two natural
supporters of the great legal grab, and one natural
sympathiser with the boom-party.
At New Year Seddon, M.L. Premier,
sent Queen Victoria a cable, wishing her, on
behalf of the people, a happy new year. Vic-
toria has replied : “I am very grateful for the
kind wishes in your telegram. Express my heart-
felt thanks.” 'This smells fishy. Victoria never
said she wanted to hear rom Seddon, and Seddon
has lately been protesting that he wants no title—
just now.
“After 2L years of Protection,” says G. H.
Reid, “ is there one Victorian industry ready to
say to the Victorian people: ‘ Take off the duties;
we can stand on our own feet.’ ” Reid himself
belongs to the most strongly protected industry
on earth, the close corporation of the law, and, up
to date, he doesn’t show any signs of a desire to
have the duty taken off, or any yearning to stand
on his own feet.
Barton’s great Federation speech was
nearly broken up by one solemn remark from a
smileless Scotchman in the audience. It was a
hot night, and Barton had worked himself up io
a frenzy of bounding indignation. “ Why should
Federation be delayed ?” he asked, wildly; “what
are we waiting for?” “We are waiting till some
of our politicians are dead,” said a funereal voice
down below, and great beads of perspiration
dropped off Barton as he stopped to consider the
matter.
Ignatieff, the stormy petrel of Russian
politics, announces that Russia will presently de-
mand that Austria shall give up Bosnia and
Herzegovina. This ought to be the beginning of
the great smash. For the best part of this cen-
tury Austria the Unready did nothing but cede
provinces, and it was a new sensation when she
got a chance to gnaw away a bit of the Sick Man’s
empire. Anybody who tries to get this acquisition
from her might as well try to deprive a tiger of
his raw ox-liver by hand,
Francis Longmore, now white-headed,
came forth from his living grave on a Gippsland
tarm to move the first resolution at the Syme
sympathy meeting in Melbourne. Longmore
recalls the halcyon days of the Vic. Parliament
when the members had grit in them and fought
like demons for solid tilings—when Longmore,
Higinbotham, Francis, David Blair, G. P. Smith,
B. G. Aspmall, Michie, W. M. K, Vale, Bindon,
and such others were in the House. The “ native ”
element has sad fact!—ruined the character of
Vic. Assembly.
G. D. Clark, M.R, the N.S.W. political
waterspout, has been thrown over by his con-
stituency s Labour League for refusing to give a
written agreement to support the Labour plat-
torm. Which, in a way, serves Clark right, as he
was the man who first compelled candidates to
give a written pledge to support local option
without compensation, or go without the teetotal

W. A. Holman, a brainy “ boy-orator,” who
certainly is a marvellous speaker.
A Government Gazette is a dismal hole-
and-corner sheet of which the public are not
expected to know more than is reprinted for them
by the “great” newspapers. It was left to the
Donald Express to draw some scandalous par-
ticulars re land selection in Victoria, from a
Gazette that had been knocking about for nearly
a year. Whereupon one, only one, of the Mel-
bourne dailies quoted the “revelations” of its
humble contemporary. Seeing that official rags
were never intended to expose swindles, the
Gazette will probably cease to announce the
HONEST GOVERNMENT.
SIRENRY SPEAKETH: “Alluding to what a system of govern-
ment might be, he said it might be oligarchical, it might be
despotism, it might be aristocracy, or it might be as nearly as
possible pure democracy, as in this country; but, whatever it
was, to be effective it must be honest.”
names of influential soil-grabbers who select large
tracts of Crown lands and owe the rent of them.
Recent cable : “Fifteen of the Bech uana-
land police have been massacred by the Matabele.”
Lord Rosebery, it is now believed, will be
Gladstone’s successor as leader of the British
Liberals. If he is, British Liberalism will be put
back twenty years at the lowest estimate. Rose-
bery, just now, is probably the most liberal among
the two or three politicians who have brains
enough to be Gladstone’s successor. But he is a
peer, and, therefore, he must lead the Government
from the House of Lords, and no statesman can
sit year after year in that atmosphere of sloth and
old decay and utter sameness without uncon-
sciously petrifying, any more than a naked lord
can sit in a coal-scuttle without being defiled.
Lord Rosebery says, “It is really a politi-
cal crime that the news which is telegraphed from
the centre of the empire to its remotest limits is
not more accurately chosen.” It is indeed. The
cable news consists mostly of gossip about beetle-
browed sloggers, announcements of royal infants,
movements of the Prince of Wales, and the
thrilling statement that the Times is of opinion
that Australia, after due consideration, will find
that settlement on the land ought to be en-
couraged, while, at the same time, preserving a
due regard for the interests of the city population.
Also, now and then, there comes an announcement
that a peeress is going for a divorce, and that the
peer used to sleep in his hat, and use disgusting
language when he crawled home from his favourite
barmaid.
Wellington (M.L.) “ Union Parliament,”
in its mock address-in-reply to a mock Governor,
shows itself possessed of rather more sense than
the real Parliament:—
Conflicting views are held among us as to the various
measures proposed in your Excellency’s Speech. Some
of these proposals meet with the disapproval of gentle-
men on the same side of the House as the hon. member
chosen by your Excellency as our leader (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘‘lns’’) and some are approved by
gentlemen on the opposite side (hereinafter called the
“Outs”). But our first duty as members of this House
is not to our country or truth, but to our party, and that
duty demands of the Ins that they should endeavour to
stay in and keep the Outs out, and of the Outs that they
should endeavour to get in and turn the Ins out—each
party being united on the one common principle of
fighting the other. All the Ins will, therefore, do their
best to conceal their disapproval, and the Outs their
approval, of the proposals in question ; and each
measure, instead of being considered on its merits and
with a view to the country’s good, will be discussed solely
from the standpoint of party tactics, and be made a
mere episode in the eternal struggle between Ins and
Outs. The result will be that many had measures will be
passed, and many good ones will fail of passing ; the
process will be distinguished by a vast amount of bitter
wrangling, childish recrimination, and noisy insincerity ;
and the loudness of our clamour will be pointed to as the
measure of the interest taken by an enlightened demo-
cracy in its public affairs. Such a procedure may appear
idiotic in theory, and likely to be disastrous in practice,
but it will be good for the party which is for the time
being in the ascendant, and as it represents the time
honoured custom of our wise forefathers we intend to
adhere to it.
They are asking in Sydney
what that newspaper is trying to
get out of that doctor.
Democratic Premier King-
ston cut down the military dis-
play at the prorogation of S.A.
Parliament. The Lieut.-Gover-
nor was escorted to the scene by
mounted constables, and the
police band was in attendance,
while only the guard of honour
was composed of military men,
the Permanent force being uti-
lised to save expense. There
was no salute fired. Members of
the militia, who missed their
ordinary day’s pay, are furious
at what they term the robbery
perpetrated by the Government.
Hobart has a woollen fac-
tory with a great future but a
small present, and to help it
along it was decided that all the
police-uniforms should be of
locally - made cloth. Tenders
were called accordingly, and in
print the tenderers were warned
that only Tas. cloth would be
accepted. But in private the
tip was given that samples of
other cloth might be sent in, and
when accepting-day came round
it was the man who took the
hint that got the contract. Then
the resolution to use only Tas.
cloth in the uniforms was re-
scinded !
Cecil Rhodes, the Cape
filibuster, points out that “the
war against Lobengula was as-
sented to by religious bodies.”
The seems extremely probable.
Hasn’t every shady thing that
was ever done—including the
Crucifixion, and the burning of
Protestants by Catholics, and
the sawing off of Puritans’ ears
by Anglicans, and the flogging
of Baptists and Quakers by
Puritans, and all the rest —been
assented to by some religious
body or other ? For that matter
Lobengula’s massacres were also
assented to by religious bodies.
The Matabele rain-maker, or
witch-finder, or gree-gree man,
or ouganga, or whatever he is
called, is quite as much a religi-
ous body in his own way as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, only
he is greasy outwardly instead
of greasy inwardly.
Max Hirsch, the "Victorian boss Free-
trader, draws an inference from cement:—
If a man wished to make cement, but found that to
sell at the price of an English firm he must lose £lOOO,
he goes to the Government, who put on such a duty as
will not only allow him to sell without loss, but with a
profit. Say he realised a gain of £lOOO, then the people
paid £2OOO to enable the local manufacturer to make
£lOOO.
All of which is strictly true, for if a man wanted
to do something, and if he found out that some-
thing else would ensue, and supposing he then
fixed up a third circumstance, and say another
thing happened as a consequence, then something
else must inevitably follow. But the bald facts
of the case are that imported cement, when there
was no duty on it, sold in Victoria at 13s. per
cask, and the price of exactly the same article,
under a 20 per cent, tariff, is now 11s. Still
Hirsch’s statement is true in every detail.
If the thing had happened that didn’t happen,
then the circumstance which didn’t take place
would have eventuated.
Says the Southlander (M.L.) :
E. Withy, of Auckland, is a land-nationaliser, and
would allow present owners to retain possession for 18
years, when the land should revert to the State. A cor-
respondent of a contemporary says Mr. Withy is a wealthy
man—owning stocks, shares, securities of all descriptions
excepting land—and asks: “ Why should not these invest-
ments of all kinds also, after 18 years, revert to the
State ? If 18 years of possession is going to pay a farmer,
why is 18 years not going to pay Mr. Withy ?”
This is the old, old trouble. The Single-tax man
never owns any land, and has always a brilliant
scheme for saving his country by confiscating the
whole property of the other fellow.
WILLIAM SATCHELL (the gallant young athlete who
died in trying to save the unfortunate Hannah
M‘Lennan from drowning, at Melbourne, on Jan. 4.)
Betwixt the Britisher who goes
To foreign climes to wield his brand
And that vile wretch who slays the foes
That seek to steal his native land,
There is a wide distinction drawn :
One’s an assassin black as pitch,
The other is a hero born.
We cannot tell you which is which,
Confused by patriotic vapours.
Let’s hope that God don’t read the papers.
Is Life worth Living?
The following facetious reply to the above question,
“It all depends upon the liver,” is true in moie
senses than one. Most people have it in their
power to make life enjoyable or miserable. A
man’s happiness does not consist in a large bank
credit, or broad acres and smiling fields. All this
may be possessed and yet the owner may be un-
utterably sad. It is the sparkling eye that tak s
in the loveliness of nature’s dress, and the body
that is fortified with vigour and nerve that really
finds life a succession of joys and delights. It is
not to be expected that persons suffering witli
deranged liver can extract more than a modicum
of gladness out of years of pain and sickness
There is only one “ royal road ” to happiness, and
that leads by the way of health. Warner’s
“ Safe ” Cuke unquestionably helps thousands in
making life worth living by stopping the nervous
destruction and organic waste that certainly
follows at the heels of liver and kidney complaints.
It prevents a multitude of ailments and also acts
as a fine tonic to the exhausted body. Warner’s
“ Safe ” Pills are invaluable in all cases of lassi-
tude, weakness, or bilious attack. No person
should be without them, as they are of special
preparation and absolutely free from all injurious
ingredients.
The following certificate of Mr. Arthur Gordon,
originator of the Harbour Concerts in Sydney, is
appropriate here Sydney, N.S.W., February
22nd, 1893. I have much pleasure in acknowledg-
ing the efficacy of your “Safe” Cure as a remedy
for liver troubles, having been a constant sufferer
for several years from sluggish liver accompanied
by violent pains in the back and general lassitude.
After taking four bottles of “Safe” Cuke an 1
two vials of “Safe” Pills, I felt myself
thoroughly rejuvenated, my energy and aptitude
for business having returned with increased vigour,
my memory and mental faculties clearer than
ever, and I became a different man in every way.’’
M'Burney, Wallis & Co.'s Report.
Report. —For our opening sale of the new year we
brought forward a large and attractive catalogue. The
saleroom was again crowded with buyers, including
several from the Southern capital, and competition for
the better classes in good light condition was extremely
strong, but faulty lots were a shade easier. Scouredsweie
also in strong demand at prices quite equal to those

samedistrict; CC/Mudgee, from Gulgong. Amongst w'ashcd
lots were the following—WW/Springvale, from Jindabyne,
and JR/Skineal, from Yass, at 9Jd, competition being
fairly animated. In sooureds a further portion of the
well-known PR brand, from Turaut, realised 12d for firsts,
HJd for seconds, 9Jd for pieces, 9>d for bellies, 10|d for
first skin, and 7|d for locks ; and a nicely got up parcel
from Tumut, marked TP/g, fetched 12Jd ; and a lot from

Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
olb rs exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
JilO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,

The rumours as to N.S.W Gov. Duff’s
intention to retire from his post at an early date
are quite unfounded. Gov. Duff will stay in N.S,
Wales seven years, if he can. He has arranged
his “home” business on that scale. Yet, if the
Parkes influence came back to power, existing
arrangements might, perforce, be altered. Parkes,
extra-confidentially, speaks clearly on the use of a
competent Governor as a link to'the Empire, but
of an incompetent one as a curse to Britain and
Australia. The conclusion, therefore, is that if
Parses or his influence comes back to power, Mr.
Duff must, not will, retire from office.

At Melb. District Court, the other day,
a ships steward gladly undertook to marry the
mother of his cheeild. Matrimony was suggested
to him, by a police inspector, as a rational means
of escape from the necessity of finding sureties for
carrying out a maintenance order, and he posi-
tively jumped at the idea. Hymen seems to have
a lot of friends in court. Also, it may be said (for
the sake of an epigram) that the police make more
“ honest women” than honest men.

Balaam: “The Seventh Day Adventists,
now camped near Melbourne, prove to be a collo-
cation of worthy and healthy citizens and
citizenesses, with a Jewish notion of keeping two
Sundays in the week, and an idea that a little tent-
practice may be good for the next generation.
The local cognoscenti are much interested in the
shadow pantomimes at bedtime, for the ladies
will insist on putting the light on the wrong side.
But they keep up the services so late that ballet
connoisseurs have to leave or miss their trains.”

Dear Bulletin, —I want to know how it
is that there are no Jewish policemen in Australia.
I have never encountered a solitary specimen,

even in the common “cop” business please reply
promptly.—Yours, C.J.

There seems to be little doubt that the
Australian native quality of voice is favourable to
colonial twang. Boys and girls (especially girls)
are born with a tendency to adopt the accent that
in London is called “ streety,” and this is nearly
always noticeable in untrained singing. On the
authority of a choir-master, who has tested and
trained hundreds of boys, we have it that the irn-
ported lad can be picked from a dozen by the
fuller tone of his voice, which, however, is not
usually as clear and penetrating as the little
native’s organ. A touch of jews’-harp quality is
there, unpleasant in the raw state, but a very

opinion comes from a musical artist who can

When newspapers fall out the honest truth
becomes known. Melb, A rgus, re a hollow meet-
ing to express sympathy with the Age versus
Speight, says that “two of the jurymen in the
case occupied a prominent position in the meeting,
and one made himself conspicuous by shouting out
a denunciation of the Argus.” In the case of any
ordinary “demonstration,” such as the Robt,
Reid luncheon of a few weeks ago, we find daily
journalism conspiring to sup press everything that
could throw a little light on the farce. There have
been other occasions, too, when a little public
information concerning jurymen in a cause celebre
might have proved interesting, but the Argus was
then as uncommunicative as all the other “ great ”
rags.
The Sydney parson who, to improve the
atmosphere of public-houses, urges members of
the cloth to visit these places frequently, paves
the way to a suggestion from the publican side —
namely, that clergymen should allow bars to be
erected in their churches, and drinks to be served
before and after service. “Why don’t men go to

The Victorian Infant Life Protection Act

One of the cele-
brities of Sydney is a
cow which comes
placidly down King-
street every day to be
milked at the premises
of its owner, a local
butcher. The presence
of this cow gives a
refreshing, bucolic as-
pect to the locality
and is reminiscent of
hay and green fields.
It is the calmest,
gentlest, most affec-
tionate cow that ever
meandered with a dis-
tended udder down a
city street, and its
name is Fanny or
Polly or something like
that. All the children
know it, and pull its
ears in salutation, and
the adult dwellers
thereabouts smack it
affectionately upon the
tail and pass the time
of day with the animal.
When it has called in
at its owner’s premises
and been milked, it
wanders back to the
Domain with the same
reflective step, and
hies it unto the grass.
Busses and cabs give
way to this cow, and
even trams stop to let
the kindly animal go
by, and only whistle
at it when its move-
ments are too gradual.
All the old, reliable
Domain loafers know
it, and they use it as
a pillow at night, and
milk it surreptitiously
into their hats in the
dewy morn ; and the
Domain policeman
speaks kindly to it,
and gives it a friendly
whack with his large
hand on the spine when
they chance to meet.
The King-street cow is an institution in Sydney,
and when it dies the place will never look quite
the same again.

Dear Bulletin, —The man who writes
tender love poems for the papers should never sign
them unless he is young and faultlessly beautiful.
For instance, I came across a sweet, mournful,
little thing the other day in a Maoriland paper,
in which the bard called on his lady-love to come
and let him rest his head upon her bosom. Then
he put his full name and address at the foot. I
know that head which he wanted to “ rest”; it is
large and black and bullet-shaped and rancid, and
when I saw the signature and thought of the
grease-in irk he would leave on anybody’s bosom
all the joy went out of the poem. Also, I know
the lady to whom he is engaged, and to whom, I
suppose, the verses were addressed, and her bosom
is flat and bony, and not the place where anybody
could rest in comfort. If I hadn’t known these
two people it would have been all right ; as things
were it was pathos mixed with hair-oil.—Yours,
&c., T.

Did he mean it, when in broken
Accents he besought my hand ?
Words of love so thickly spoken
One might well misunderstand.

Shall I shortly change my name ?

Will his manner be the same ?

Not a horrid, vulgar “sponge ” ;
P’raps he nerved himself by drinking
Ere he dared to “ take the plunge.”

Want to kiss his “ blushing rose,”

One superfine writer on the tiresome sub-
ject of Young Australia’s pronunciation wanders
into the grammar question, which, by the way,
has nothing whatever to do with the case. This
individual says—“ Not excepting English-born
people, how frequently do we not hear ‘No, I
don’t think so,’and such like? There is another
very common expression, ‘ I quite forgot all about
it.’ All these faults simply need correction.’’ A
fair sample of the strict grammarian’s patronising
stupidity. If it be possible to nearly forget all
about a certain matter (which means more than
nearly forgetting a good deal about it), then the
expression, “I quite forgot all about it,” must
pass as sound in sense. Again, a man’s “ I don’t
think so,” following on the heels of his “No,”
seems a legitimate qualification of the negative,
or we may take the “ No ” as being meant to give
special force to “ I don’t think so.” The answer
breaks no rule of grammar, whilst fully conveying
the intended meaning. The captious critic’s own
words —“ ho v frequently do we not hear ”do not
grammatically express the remark he intended to
make. He inadvertently commits one of the
“common (real) faults ‘that need correction.’”
In the moat cultured and careful manner he
manages to stultify himself.

Australian Star has been taking a census
among the Sydney booksellers to find out what
books women mostly read. The inquiry reveals
the lamentable fact that the mild and greasy
novels of Mrs, Henry Wood top the poll. If any
one set of books is more calculated to undermine
the character of a nation than any other set, it is
Mrs. Wood’s. There is nothing immoral about
her works, and nothing approaching the indecent,
but they are full of pappy deans and rectors, and
good little boys who grovel to the deans and
rectors, and consequently rise to greatness; and
squires who are held in profound reverence by all
around them, and people of the “ lower ordahs ”
who are respectful to the squire and are content
in that station of life to which Providence has
called them. Also there is much profound hat-
lifting and respectful touching of scalp-locks on
every page, and a horrid tone of salaam runs all
through them. This squashy kind of literature,
which always ends in a beautiful girl dying of
consumption with boiled-pap accompaniments, is
about the saddest thing in the British language.

One of the first results of that awful yarn

It may interest him to know that members of my

fitted to adorn the “ kawlinies,” they sent her out

dencies, and the next badly-shocked British
father will send his incorrigible son or daughter

The famous Henry Smith Fish was elected
the other day to be Mayor of Dunedin. There
was an exciting finish between him and the
other man, Chapman, and towards six o’clock,
when the poll closed, the impression was that Fish
was behind. Just then a last Fish supporter was
unearthed and was raced furiously to the Town
Hall to vote. As he got on the steps the clock
struck the first stroke of six, and the wife of the
other candidate threw herself on to the last man,
and holding him by the coat-tail declared that he
couldn’t vote because the poll was closed. The
coat-tail, however, was torn from her clutch, but
candidate Chapman grasped the voter and de-
clared that he couldn’t be admitted. The Fish
faction, however, was desperate, and with a heave
it rushed its supporter and Chapman in together,
and they fell over the door-sill just before the last
stroke of the hour. The vote was allowed, and
then it was ascertained that Fish had a majority
of 318, so that a devoted wife and mother had
made her struggle on the doorstep to no purpose.
Quarterly Review publishes an article
on Burke’s “ Peerage and Baronetage,” showing
plainly that the pedigrees of most of the “old
families” of Britain are absolutely bogus—that
their ancestral trees are a pitiable example of the
abject struggles of plain modern beer to graft itself
on'to ancient blood. The Fife family, in particu-
lar, gets a bad showing up. It starts from one
William Duff, who was made a peer 140 years ago,
and called himself Viscount Mao Duff in order
to establish some kind of connection between him-
self and the legendary Mac Duffs of ancient times.
Next the family borrowed the crest of the old-
time Mac Duffs, and looted a sixteenth century
tombstone from Cullen Church—the tombstone of
one Innes—which was solemnly erected in the
Duff mausoleum with a bogus inscription and date
setting forth that it was the monument of one
Duff of their line, who was a red-legged cateran
in 1404, and died under tremendous circumstances
which reflected great credit on the family. And,
finally, the Duff family, by means of stolen tomb-
stones and bogus records, which were boiled to
rmjke them look ancient, fixed up an entire
.pedigree which joins them on to the original Mac-
Duffs, and carries them right back to the Deluge.
The Coulthart family, which was bowled out some
years ago, went one better, for it fixed up an
entirely new pedigree from the beginning, and
put up something like 24 tombstones in various
degrees of dilapidation and apparent old age, ask-
ing the passer-by to tread lightly on the bones of
imaginary Coultharts, who died as far back
as 600 years ago. The Dearden family put
up a “ family chapel ” in Rochdale Church,
and having bought old funereal brasses from sun-
dry marine stores, fixed up the tombs of its
alleged ancestors in long rows, with effigies, slabs,
and assorted monuments. Another family of long
descent is alleged to be entirely bogus; the real
family died out, and one Smith or Jenkins bor-
rowed its name and bought the old mansion, and
took over the goodwill of the pedigree. As for
the names they seem to be mostly bogus. The
modern De Grey is an abject Robinson ; Neville
Percy is Smithson (“ Duke Smithson of Northum-
berland,” said the Anti-Jacobin) ; De Winton is
a miserable Wilkins ; De Montmorency is Morres;
De Freville is Green ; De Capell Brooke is only
Supple; De Heriz is Smith; and so on. The
British peerage generally, despite bogus tombstones
and faked church records, is about as genuine as
the Italian count whose real name is Waffles, and
who used to be cook in a hotel, and the old
revered, much-grovelled-to nobility is dust and
ashes and plain Jones.
As to the argument that girls, if educated
for mercantile life, would displace boys, it amounts
to nothing. The boys must take care of them-
selves as they can. Society is not prepared to
protect the male sex at the sacrifice of the females.
There are a large number of callings in which
women are out of place. There is an inconveni-
ence in a woman becoming a lawyer; she does not
compete successfully as a doctor; she cannot be a
soldier, or a sailor, or an engineer, or a follower of
any trade which requires muscular strength or
physical endurance. The boys must be con-
tent with these. In mere barter and sale
there is no reason why women should not
hold their own against men. Mrs. Hetty
Green, who more than holds her own, is an
exceptional case. She is a financial genius. She
is a miser, and the daughter of a miser. All that
there is of her—and there is a good deal —has run
to money-grubbing. She concentrated her very
remarkable ability, many years ago, upon the
science of stock speculation, and she mastered it.
Her system was exceedingly simple. She never
sold what she had not got, and she never bought
what she could not pay for. She always kept an
enormous sum of money on hand to pick up bar-
gains in panics. Before she bought a stock she
studied it "through and through. She lay awake
nights pondering over flaws which might be found
in it. When she invested in a railroad she was as
familiar with its history as if she had built
it. She never trusted any man’s word or his
faith. She put her money in John J. Cisco’s
hands because he was an exemplar of financial
solidity far safer than the banks; and when she
dropped in on him, on one day of panic, for her
balance of a million or two, and was told that the
house would require a day or two to call in their
loans so as to realise so large a sum, she went out
crying, sat down on the steps of the office, with a
cotton umbrella in her hand, and called all passers-
by to witness that Cisco had her money and would
not return it. Mrs. Green spends nothing. She
is said to be worth forty or fifty millions, yet her
annual expenditure is set down at four thousand
dollars. She has been noticed to run after a
nickel she dropped in the street. She will
carry a vast sum in securities in her leather
bag, and walk with it to her bankers rather
than take a cab. Few servant-maids are as
poorly dressed as she is. This lady is no type of
the Woman of Business, and no formulas can be
drawn from her career. She is simply a grotesque
phenomenon. As a rule, women are not a success
as gamblers. Whether, as the gentlemen of the
green cloth say, they are too emotional to thrive
at a pursuit which requires self-control, or
whether their minds are not adapted to form long
calculations embracing many factors, it is certain
that successful female speculators are so rare as to
be almost unknown. But many women grow
rich by hoarding.— S.F. Argonaut.

MY PHILOSOPHY.
Man is a savage, when
Unseen of other men.
Under his fellows’ ken—
Wholly hypocrite then.
FRANK RENAR.
MRS. CALAP GOES TO SEE MRS. MILLS
And it was not for an hour's chat over a cup of
tea that she went to see her, but on a much more
serious matter. For Mrs. Mills had been quoted
in the newspapers as having said something which
might be of importance to Mrs Calap, and also to
others. Now the newspapers print so many things
that nobody can make head or tail of, that Mrs.
Calap thought the only sure way was to go and see
Mrs. Mills and ask her if it was true what was
said. What Mrs. Mills told her is contained in
the annexed statement made about a year after-
wards :
“I, Jane Calap, of 3, Vincent Street, York
Road, Leeds, do solemnly and sincerely declare
as follows: —
“In the early part of November, 1887, I fell
into a low, weak state. I was.tired, languid, and
weary, and felt as if something had come oyer me.
All my bones ached and I had so much pain that
I did not know where to put myself. I was con-
stantly vomiting, sometimes a green, bitter fluid
came away, at other times frothy water. I had a
dull, heavy pain at the right side, and the whites of
my eyes were a yellow colour, and my skin was
sallow as if I had the jaundice. I had an awful
taste in the mouth, my tongue and teeth being
covered with slime so thick that I had to scrape it
away. My appetite fell away, and after eating
the simplest and lightest food I had so much pain
that it nearly killed me. I had always great pain
and weight at my chest and through to my back,
also a gnawing, sinking sensation at the pit of my
stomach. I was greatly troubled with wind which
rolled all over me, and gave me so much pain it
was like spasms, for I could not straighten myself.
I gradually got weaker and weaker, and felt so
weak and exhausted that I could scarcely drag
myself along. As time went on I wasted away
until I got as thin as a match, and could barely
walk across the floor. I felt so downhearted that
I used to say I shall never get better any more in
this world. I took all kinds of medicines, but
finding myself getting worse I got a recommend-
ation to the Leeds Infirmary, where I was at-
tended to by several doctors, who gave me medi-
cines, which I took month after month, but I got
no better. The doctors sounded my chest and
lungs, and seemed puzzled with my sufferings, for
they frequently changed my medicine. Getting
no better I next went to the Dispensary in North
Street, and persevered taking their medicines, but
it was all to no purpose. I now gave up taking
physic, for I had lost all faith in it, and my
sufferings continued until January, 1891, when I
heard a neighbour of mine, Mrs. Ann Mills, 40,
Bread Street, having been cured (after the doctors
had given her up) by a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup. I went with my
daughter to see Mrs. Mills, who told me that
Seigel’s Syrup had saved her life, and would do me
good. 1 got a bottle of the medicine, and after
taking a few doses I felt relief. I continued with
the Syrup, and after taking three bottles all the
pain left me, my food agreed with me and I grad-
ually gained strength. I can now take any kind
of food and never feel any distress and am as
strong as ever I was. After my recovery a lady
customer of mine said to me “ Mrs. Calap, what-
ever have you been taking, for you do look so
well. ” I told her, as I tell everyone, that Seigel’s
Syrup has made me a new woman, and but for it
I should not be alive. I wish others to know of
the benefit I have derived from the medicine, and
I give full permission to the proprietors to use
this statement as they may think fit, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing
the same to be true. By virtue of the provisions
of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835 (Will. IV.
c. 62.”
“ Declared before me at Leeds this')
“25th day of January, 1892. I
(Signed) Alf. Cooke, J. P. |,
‘ * Ex-Mayor of Leeds. ” J
(Signed)
Jane Calap.
The public may remember the account of Mrs-
Mills’ illness and recovery, published some time
ago. We are glad that Mrs. Calap heard of it and
went straight to that lady herself for the infor-
mation she wanted. The visit resulted just as
might have been expected. Both our good friends
had suffered from the same disease, indigestion
and dyspepsia, and the remedy which cured in the
first case was equally successful in that of her
neighbour. No wonder Mrs. Calap had lost
all faith in physic, and if Mother Seigel’s Syrup
were “ physic,” we should not look for people to
have faith in it either. But it is a remedy, not
“ physic.” It doesn’t upset and disgust, it soothes
and heals. Men fall ill, to be sure, but women bear
most of the pain in this sad world, and when once
acquainted they and “ Mother Seigel” are ‘‘ever
the best of friends,” like Joe and Pip in Dickens’
story.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send_to ELLIS’S,
were you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical boolmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the
LOWEST POSSIBLE PRICES FOR CASH,
Paying Trainage or Postage to Any Part of the Australian
Colonies.
No matter how far back in the interior you may reside,
we post the boots DIRECT TO YOUR DOOR. ELLIS'S
system has already proved a sovereign balm to thousands
of country residents who, whilst performing their daily
avocations, had previously to endure the excruciating
tortures of narrow-fitting and shapeless foot gear, the
insoles of which fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an ample tread,
and consequently comfort. You can WEAR ELLIS’S
BOOTS STRAIGHT AWAY—they are a “going con-
cern ” from the start. The materials are well tanned, and
will not “draw” or blister the feet, as most new boots
do. Send for catalogue, post free. The following
are among our leading items: Qent.’s French Calf or
Kangaroo, E.S. or Shoes, 14s fid, 15s fid, 16s fid, 17s fid ;

JR HIS, Company is being formed to take over, as a
i going concern, the business, now, and for the past
fourteen years, carried on by Messrs. BEALE & CO.
in Sydney, and throughout New South Wales, as Manu-
facturers, Importers, and Distributors of Sewing Machines
and Musical Instruments; also the Stock-in-trade, Bal-
ances, and all debts due to the firm ; the Machinery,
Plant, and all materials.
The concern has branches and travellers all over the
territory. Its success is so well-known that comment
is needless ; suffice it to say that the business will be run
on the same, lines in the future that have ensured con-
tinued success in the past, and the extended confidence
between the present firm and its customers will be
studiously maintained.
The volume of business has steadily grown, and during
five years the trade has totalled the enormous amount of
.£411,178, while the profits have been large and steadily
maintained. By the system of liens on goods sold until
fully paid for, the losses by bad debts have been reduced
to a comparatively insignificant amount.
With the business there will be handed over the
following properties: the title and interest in the present
firm of the freehold land and buildings situated at 482
and 484 George Street, Sydney, immediately opposite the
splendid edifice now being erected for the Central City
Markets. These buildings toim a striking feature in the
centre of the busiest block in the city, and for solidity
and quality of finish are unsurpassed. The portions not
required by the firm are let to substantial tenants.
Also the Factory and Stores at Nelson Street, Annan-
dale, which occupy freehold land 30 feet by 200 feet, and
leasehold 60 feet by 400 feet. The principal Factory,
with engine and machinery, stands upon the freehold. All
the machinery is specially applicable to the work ; there
are ample supplies of seasoned timber for future require-
ments. Finally the freehold brick store and stables Myrtle
Street, city. All these properties are taken over at cost.
Stocks and Plant at valuation ; and customer’s balances
with allowance for contingencies.
Messrs. Beale & Co. take the whole of their interest in
shares; no good-will is demanded; no preference or
promoters' shares. Mr. Octavius C. Beale will act as
Managing Director for five years at least.
All the firm’s Trade Marks, will become the property
of the Company : and the system of protecting goods by
liens until fully paid for, which has stood the test of years
will be strictly adhered to.
The results contemplated in converting the busines
into a Company are—(l) Expansion by introduction of
additional capital ; (2) Co-operation of interest amongst
a wide-spread body of shareholders ; (3) the securing of
perpetuity of the business.
A sound progressive concern is offered, the results of
which in pa-t years justify the expectation of 10 to 12J
per cent, dividends, besides providing Reserves.
Full prospectus and information may be obtained from
the following agents, who are authorized to receive de-
posits on shares.

The “Canadian Club Whisky,” which is
compounded by Hiram Walker and Sons, at
Walkerville, Canada, has at least one powerful
recommendation—it has received the unanimous
approval of the last Australian Eleven, and what
these cricketers don’t know about whisky is pro-
bably not worth knowing. On their return
journey the Australian cricketers visited the huge
Walkerville distillery, and were much staggered
by what they saw. In Canada the Government
exercises a parental watchfulness over whisky—it
adopts it like an orphan, and brings it up tenderly
by hand. When the liquor is distilled it is
promptly seized upon by the State, and put in
bond to mature. It is watched over by the State,
bottled, corked and labelled by the State, or under
State supervision, and a stamp is affixed, whereby
the State stakes its immortal soul upon the age and
purity of the liquor. The process is not compul-
sory, but the whisky which is not thus guaranteed
is despised and sold as a cheap and inferior article,
and, therefore, the system of State supervision is
practically universal. The Canadian Club
Whisky is matured for five years—as attested by
the Government stamp—in oak casks, in ware-
houses with a capacity of 80,000 barrels—equal to
million imperial gallons ; and is sold by whole-
sale agents all over the world, from Monte Video
to Christiania, and from Guatemala to Japan.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
TheN.S.W. contingent was very successful at
the Maoriland swimming- championship meeting, held
at Auckland, on 13th and 15th inst. W. J. Gormley won
the 880 yards and 220 yards in splendid style ; time,
13min. 53 2-ssec. for the former and 2rain. 53 3-sseo. for
the latter. C. Hellings was second for the 880 yards and
Lady’s Bracelet, and third for the 220 yards. Tom Mead-
ham was second, and A. Holmes third for the 220 yards,
while VV. Gum.bleton won the Lady’s Bracelet. These are
all N.S.VV. men. W. J. Allen, of M.L., won the long
diving championship with 61 yards.

Gormley’s victories at the M.L. Championship
Swimming Meeting were expected hy his friends, who
believe that the VVagga boy is unmatched at his distances.
Some of his records are ;—lOO yds,, 1 min. 22-5 secs. ; 220
yds., 2 min, 38J secs. ; 300 yds., 3 min. 56 secs. ; 500 yds.,
7 min. 1 sec. ; 1000 yds., 14 min. 44 secs. ; 1 mile, 27 min.
3j secs. At the longer distances he has been beaten ; but
for short spurts he is probably without a rival in the
world.

The history of Abe Hioken’s fight with Foley
is known to few of the present day sports. Abe was a
member of “the rooms” in Melbourne, and it used to break
the heart of Joe Thompson, himself a born bully, for him
and his party to have to knuckle down to Hicken, under
the threat of a “slouching,” when any argument arose.
Joe commenced to cast round for a take-down of Master
Abe, and upon the advice of Jem Mace the match
was made with Foley. It is history how the men
sparred for over half-an-hour, Hicken leading for the
body and Foley drawing back in that peculiar style
of his, seemingly taking the hit each time, hut as a
matter of fact scarcely feeling it. Foley drew the old
’un on properly, until the right moment arrived, when
he drove the left fair on to the “mark,” and as Hicken
fairly doubled up, smash across came the right on the
side of the head. This virtually finished the fight.

led for years past, it isa million to one that, train as he

a fraction over 66. Certainly phenomenal!

The Adelaide junior cricketer is a fearful and a
wonderful thing. In a representative junior match
recently, the players averaged 28 years of age. Chief
amongst them was a player who helped to found the

Lyons. Billy VVhitridge, the veteran referred to, was,
years ago, a representative of S.A. in interprovincial
contests, and now is trotted out as a junior 1 You see

Acting on a Supreme Court decision, the S.A.
police hold that betting, save through the totalisator, is
illegal; so after every race-meeting the “books” are
prosecuted. At Adelaide police-court 50 layers were
hauled up and fined. This policy has killed the small
meetings and crippled the big ones. With juvenile
Israelites who aspired to grow up to manhood and succeed
to pa’s tobacco and betting business, another happy
dream has vanished.

The Bulletin does not now stand quite
alone in the press on the capital punishment
question. Sydney Daily Telegraph in a leading
article on the butchering of Mrs. Knorr :
While the woman was awaiting her doom, the concern
tration of the public mind upon her case was intense, and
the circumstance of her sex appealed in especial degree
to the morbid sense of a certain order of mind among the
multitude. With such it was an absorbing topic of
conversation week after week, in the streets and in
many homes, in the hearing of, or participated in by,
young as well as old. What must be the natural, if not
the inevitable, effects of such prolonged converse on
themes so gruesome and forbidding? The reflecting will
be impressed by the danger that the results will be the
excitement of the lower and grosser depths of morbid
sentiment—as indicated by the debased craving evinced
for every detail of the wretched woman’s last moments—
with consequences so brutalising as to tend to increase
the murderous element already more or less present in
the community. The execution which took place yester-
day is a terrible incident to happen in the nineteenth
century, and while it is true that so long as the
capital sentence is maintained, and must be visited on
murderers irrespective of sex, it becomes a serious
question whether this form of vindicating the law does
not result in producing more crime than it punishes.
Amen 1 The gallows is the father and mother of
murder. The State, personified by Butcher
Patterson and co., can’t employ three hangmen to
choke one wretched, brandied-up woman, who
comes drunk on to the scaffold squawking “Safe
in the Arms of Jesus” without blood-manuring
the seeds of madness and homicide throughout
the land.

A Tale of Three Skeletons.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
Hk;h up on a lonely, inaccessible shelf of rock
in the Maoriland Alps may be seen a gathering of
skeletons. At least they might be seen there were
it possible for anything unfurnished with wings
to gain so much as a bird’s-eye glance at that crag
which hangs in the air, midway between earth
and heaven. But the precipitous wall bulges
out above and obscures the view from overhead,
even supposing there were any place overhead
where a man or a goat could hang on and
consider things ; and the same precipice swells
out again beneath, and blocks the view from the
pass below. The pass itself is narrow, and no one
ever climbs the mountain on the other side of it,
partly because no one ever comes that way—
partly because there is nothing to be gained by
climbing, for the whole mountain would not sell
for a cent in the open market, being merely
good road-making material in a region where
there are no roads—partly because, if anyone
should scale that ghastly pinnacle it would only
lead him to a razor-backed ridge, and the ridge
itself leads nowhere—and chiefly because even the
prince of darkness himself, hanging on grimly
with horns and claws and tail, would find
no footing there. Consequently the one spot
which commands a view of the ledge and the
skeletons, is a spot which no one will ever reach,
and even if it could be reached no one would ever
come back again from it to tell what he had seen.
And the skeletons rest up there in peace
and the years go by, and the seasons come
and go. And in rain and shine and thunder
and wintry storm they sit and look out on the
vast monotony of the Alps, and ponder on the
silent, changeless majesty of the great unchange-
able mountains. They look as if they themselves
were wondering how they had reached that
amazing elevation, for neither in front nor behind
is there any possible pathway, and above and
below there is nothing but bare, slippery, over-
hanging rock. They are wrecked among the
clouds, and until the general resurrection they
will remain in their weather-beaten niche undis-
turbed.
There are six of them in all. But only three are
men. The rest are horses, and the horses do not
count. They are planted in single file, for the shelf
is just long enough to accommodate them, but not
wide enough to admit them two abreast. The man
in front—or the dry and creaking wreckage of what
was once a man—still sits on his tattered and
rusted saddle, but the animal beneath him has
collapsed, and is but a heap of bones held together
by the remains of its ancient harness. The saddle
sprawls on top of these remnants, and the man
sprawls on top cf the saddle with his skull
curiously jammed into an angle of the rock. He
has one leg stretched out behind him, and one
extended in front, as if he had died in the midst
of some acrobatic feat, and the rags of an old
brown hat are still upon his head. Also there is a
leer on the ruins of his countenance, and his pipe
is held rakishly between his teeth; it is also
jammed against the rocks, and unless he swallows
it he and the pipe will be found together, just as
they are now, on the day of judgment.
The next man in the line is also sprawling above
the remains of a horse, but he is lying on his back
and the rain has drifted in at his jaws and his
disused eye-holes, making a sort of high-tide
within his fleshless skull. When there is a spell
of dry weather he evaporates, and in wet seasons,
on the other hand, he is in a state of perpetual
overflow. It is evident this process has been going
on for a good many years, for his head is nearly
half-full of an alluvial deposit left by many suc-
ceeding storms. Otherwise there is nothing re-
markable about him. Pass on.
The third member of the party is practically
undistinguishable, for his horse is piled up on top
of him, and all that can be seen of him is not even
enough to found a reasonable tale upon.
There are a few other properties, almost too
small to be worth mentioning. A rusted billy-
can, the fragments of a gun, and a half-mast rag
that might once have been a blanket are about
all.
And for the rest, there is silence above and
silence underneath, for the winds seldom reach
that secluded shelf of rock which is suspended
between sky and earth, and the rushing
river at the bottom of the gorge is so far
off that its murmur is undistinguishable. There
is little light and much weird shadow in the
narrow pass, and the sunlight only creeps in with
difficulty, and the moon plays fantastic tricks
with the little group that sleeps on the un-
reachable mountain side. And when there is
neither sun nor moon, and the only light is the
gleam of the icy stars, a new life and expression
seem to awake in one at least of the three dead
men, but it is only the radiance shining through
the empty eye-holes of the individual whose head
is half-full of water and silt, and reflected back atan
acute angle through his half-open jaws. It gives
a sort of semi-humorous cast to his countenance,
but humour is wasted in a place where even a
goat could not climb up to join in the mirth.
And considering how little amusement there is in
the earth beneath him, it seems a wasted emotion
that the dead man should laugh his unchanging
laugh on the mountain with never an audience to
bear him company.
It
There were three of us in all, and we had gone
forth into the waste places of the Southern Alps
to look for gold. But all through the spring and
the early summer we wandered further and
further among the mountains, and the gold was
nowhere to be found. We prospected among the
rocks and cliffs, and on the bars of many a name-
less river, and up many an untrodden gorge, and
everywhere we panned out twenty hundredweight
of road-metal to the ton —only that and nothing
more.
Jack Hamilton was the leader and guide and
general support of the party. He acted as guide
because we were all equally ignorant of the
country, but Hamilton could plunge into an un-
known land with a grim and blasphemous con-
fidence which made up for his ignorance; and
though he was guiltless of geography he had
acquired by long experience a capacity for
talking about things he knew nothing of, whereas
I had mostly confined myself to subjects with
which I was more or less acquainted, and lacked
the ability to expound things 1 had never heard
of. Jack s strength lay in this one speciality, so
—as already mentioned—he virtually commanded
the little expedition. He was a weather-beaten,
dusky individual of 40 or thereabouts, and his
other qualifications were a wide, far-reaching,
complicated humour, and a power of misquoting
Scripture which was never equalled before or
since. Where he came from, or why he came
from there, I never knew.
Percy, the next member of the company, was
also remarkable, inasmuch as his other name was
Adolphus. He was a long, pale, silent British
youth, and a conspicuous failure in every way
that one man could fail without hiring out-
side assistance. He had been exported by his
uncle, who was alleged to be a nobleman and
almost the only remark which he ever made by
his own volition—except when he was roused to a
sort of simdy anger—was that he intended to
write for money to take him home. Owing to the
circumstances hereinafter mentioned, however,
he never did write, and if his uncle wrote to him
the letter is not likely to be delivered, lor he has
gone far beyond the beat of any eartuly postman.
The third member of the party—myself—was
noted for nothing at all except the conspicuous
foolishness which led him to clamber with a
pickaxe over a damp hillside on such an errand,
and in such company.
And so when the summer began to wane, and
the first breath of the chilling autumn was felt in
the breezes that swept down from the Alps, we
gathered up our camp and started for some newer
and wilder regions than any we had yet visited.
111.
“Boys,” said Hamilton emphatically, “it’s all
very good for you to laugh, but I told you we’d
find that mountain yet, and by the immortal
heavens —there it is.”
“That mountain” was Jack Hamilton’s pet
craze. He was filled with a tale concerning a
certain legendary peak which he had seen years
before, and somehow lost again past all recovery.
There was a deposit of gold there —great masses
and hunks of purest gold, and for some elaborate
reason he had brought none of it away with him
on the memorable occasion when Providence threw
the treasure at his head, in a manner of speaking,
and he had neglected to pick it up. His story
varied a good deal, and the mountain grew higher
each time we heard of it, and the gold more
abundant; but as far as 1 could make out the
original circumstances were something like these.
Jack Hamilton was a new chum at one time —an
unsophisticated lamb digging promiscuously in
the most unlikely places, and vainly plunging
around with a spade and a pickaxe upon the face
of Nature. He found nothing in patticular at
this period of his life, not even himself sometimes,
for being fresh and harmless he was unable to
turn a corner and find his way home again after-
wards. And in consequence of this failing he lost
himself badly on one occasion, and wandered
away among the hills, and there led a precarious
existence upon bark and grass and assorted
insects. By the most vigorous and ceaseless walk-
ing, and by rushing over every obstacle that came
in his way, assisted by the fact that he had taken
the wrong direction at first, and had succeeded —
though steering by the sun—in keeping wrong
ever afterwards, hecontrivedatlastto bediscovered,
delirious and almost dead, in quite a new part of
the country. Then the Samaritans who picked
him up conveyed him many miles to an hospital,
and left him there without staling where they had
met him. And in consequence of all this, when
Jack Hamilton woke up at last, and remembered
about the mountain, and the gold upon it, which
he had seen or dreamt of in his wanderings, there
was no geographical information to go upon.
He had grown middle-aged and horny and
profane since then, but he had never found the
lost peak and the lost millions. When our pro-
specting expedition began to grow weary and
unprofitable, he told Percy and me about the
great secret, and we also grew enthusiastic
for a while, but we had seen not a trace of the
gold, either. Yet, according to Jack’s description,
it was the sort of mountain that nobody could
pass unnoticed. It was square and vertical, and
on three sides absolutely inaccessible, while the
top seemed to be sawn right off as if some one had
removed the original summit and then planed it
smooth. And, most surprising thing of all, there
was on the fourth side a gently-sloping road
—it had probably been a hideously precipitous
path in the first place, but it had been growing
and expanding in Jack’s brain for years, until he
was almost prepared to swear that there was also
an iron gate and a knocker, and a hotel with
choice refreshments, and that ham and eggs grew
wild on the mountain side, while the ice-cream
blossomed on the trees. And about half way up
this track was Jack’s gold-mine—a species of cave
with all Golconda lying about loose inside.
We had long since lost faith in the mine—Percy
and I. We believed in it at first, when Hamilton
laid it before us one day as a bald, unvarnished
statement; but the next day he wandered into
frantic details about the millions it contained, and
we grew dubious; and the day after that he threw
in so many surprising facts about the scenery that
we became sceptical. And a little later he
told us in a solemn tone about the road, and
gravely propounded the theory that his mine was
the original mine of Solomon, and that the
road which led up to it was the work of some
Israelitish engineer, and then we set him down as
a bad description of lunatic, and prayed that we
might escape him, and get back safely to civilisa-
tion. But unluckily we were lost among the
mountains as effectually as Hamilton himself had
been when he made his great discovery, and that
experienced maniac was our sole hope and reliance
if we were ever to find our way back. So for day
after day he dragged us through a horribly in-
accessible country, and we followed him wearily
and in profound disgust.
And now, when we were utterly weary of the
whole enterprise, and would gladly have shunted
our guide into an asylum for dangerous cranks,
and sold our share of all the prospective millions
to be anywhere away from these endless wastes of
rock and sodden vegetation and desolate cliffs, the
mountain of gold was looming up ahead of us at
last. A moment before we would as soon have
expected to see the Himalayas in front of us, or
the peaks of Lebanon. Then the mist opened,
and straight ahead was a great square mass of
vertical rock, with the summit sawn straight off
as if the upper peak had been cut away and thrown
into the depths beneath.
We were toiling along through an enormous
cleft in the hills, when this vision burst upon us,
and on each side of us the cliffs rose like a wall of
inky blackness and blotted out the sunlight.
There was a little stream, or rather a little noisy
river, meandering through this pass, and we
scrambled painfully amid the shingle which lined
it on either side. When we came to a patch of
comparatively easy travelling we mounted our
packhorses, for there was now so exceedingly
little to carry that they were packhorses only in
name; and when the track was difficult—which
was usually the case —we dragged them after us.
As it chanced we were all three in our saddles
when Jack’s great discovery rose on the horizon,
and instinctively we pulled up and sat glaring
wildly into futurity.
Then Hamilton gave a wild, awful, joyous
execration that made the rocks ring and re-echo,
and kicking his bony black horse into a furious
scramble, he tore away and left us.
Then I said nothing, for I was too full of sudden
bewilderment for words, but I pounded furiously
on the ribs of my dejected steed like a man wlm
pounds his steed in a dream, and rushed after
him.
And finally Percy gathered up his scattered
faculties and followed us, and as he followed he
threw out a wild exclamation into the air.
“ By Jove ! ”
IV
Yes, the legendary mountain was there in al
reality. And, more wondrous still, the road was
there too, winding in a curious zig-zag fashion
away up in the misty air until it was lost among
the clouds. And as to the gold we never doubted
it now, even for a moment.
It wasn’t much of a road after all, but it was
enough for our purpose. It was cut in the vertical
face of the cliff and it afforded abundant room for
one horseman, but very little for two. It had
once been smooth and exceedingly regular, but
long centuries of ruin and frost and thunder had
dented it, and rotted away the edges, and filled it
with cracks and slippery places, and here and
there it seemed to have been repaired by some
rough and ready artist in masonry, and his handi-
work was now falling slowly into pieces. But it
was a road, and Jack Hamilton’s dream was
coming true after all.
“ I knew it,” he yelled, with such a yell as the
old rocks had not heard for ages. “I knew I
would find it. It’s all there thousands —
millions—hundreds of millions—it’s been waiting
for us all these, years, and now we’re the richest
men on earth. We are—we —”
“Yah —ha—aha —yaha ! ”
It was a strange, long-drawn, musical cry that
came from some tremendous distance overhead,
and apparently a dozen pairs of human lungs were
combined in the chorus. And it was so sudden
and wild and unexpected, that Percy turned his
horse’s head there and then, and fled for a quarter
of a mile down the pass.
“ What in is thatV’
Then we both sat and listened, and as we did so
the same cry rose again, and swelled and rolled
with a solemn reverberation through the air, and
awoke wild, musical echoes among the gnarled old
Alps.
“ Yah —ha—aha—yaha ! ”
“ By the Immortal—we’re too late ! Our claim’s
jumped !”
All the joy and energy went out of us in an
instant. Hamilton turned an ashen grey, and
wiped great beads of perspiration off his forehead,
and as for me, I climbed slowly out of my saddle
and sat down helplessly on a boulder. It seemed
as if I had actually owned all these millions only
a moment ago, and now they had dissolved and
fled away into absolute nothingness, and all that
remained of that magnificent wealth was an old,
battered, grey horse, two ancient blankets, and a
billy-can.
“ Let’s go on, anyhow,” suggested Jack. “We
may as well see what’s happened. But if there’s
anybody up there they must have found the claim
long ago. Nobody but a corpse could miss it, and
a pretty old corpse at that. O Lord, the gold’s
just staring you in the face —heaps of it—piles of
it. Well, we may as well look at it anyhow, even
if we don’t get a cent. But, after all,” and here
lie brightened up visibly, “ there may be only
three or four fellows altogether, and if that’s
so we’ll get a share or there’ll be a row —such a
row there will be. Come on; we’ll thin out these
pioneers a bit if we’ve any luck.”
“We haven’t any luck, Jack,” I answered.
“ That’s just where it is.”
Then we started up the hill, in a dejected pro-
cession. Percy came back cautiously, and tailed
on to the rear of the caravan, but he was obviously
scared and uneasy, and his ears seemed to stand
up more conspicuously than usual on either side of
his head as he listened, and sniffed the air in all
directions. But there was no repetition of that
wild, pathetic wail that had come apparently
from the clouds, and, stranger still, there was not a
footprint to be seen anywhere, nor a single thread
of smoke against the sky, nor was there the echo
of a pick stroke to be heard in the silent atmos-
phere, and the old stillness of the untrodden Alps
bad settled down once more on all our surround-
ings. And the ancient highway seemed to be
crumbling to pieces beneath our horses’ hoofs, and
even when we came at last to a yawning gap
which we crossed with difficulty and considerable
danger, there were no signs of any attempt at
repair or improvement. When Hamilton saw
this he drew a long, long sigh of relief.
“Boys,” he said solemnly, “I believe it’s all
right after all. If anyone was working the claim
he must have left some signs, and there hasn’t
been a foot or a hoof on this road for years and
years. And as to these voices it doesn’t matter a
rap where they are so long as they aren’t here.
Well, I’m d d, some more ! ”
Right above our heads came a long, shrill blast
like a conch or a tuneless horn—a blast so shrill
and so long-sustained that I thought any human
lungs must have burst under the effort.
“There’s one man about anyhow,” I said; “but
where is he ? He must be a mile up in the air
from the sound he makes.”
“ He isn’t a white man—that I’ll swear,” said
Hamilton. “Great Scott! did you ever hear
such a note as that ? ”
“ He isn’t a native, either. There aren’t any
about these parts.”
“ Well, I don’t care whether he’s man or
devil. We’re going straight on. We haven’t
got so far as this to be scared by any fool with a
brass trumpet. Inside an hour we’ll reach the
mine, and then we’ll find out the meaning of this
circus. Mind where you’re going now,” he added,
for a piece of the rock suddenly crumbled away
in front of us and went thundering down the
mountain side, leaving another awkward chasm to
be leaped over.
“ The mine’s just about half-way up,” said Jack
thoughtfully, after another long pause. “ Now
this festive orchestra seems to be holding its per-
formance right on the top, and that’s what I can’t
understand, for, so far as I know, the road
ends just beyond the cave. All that’s left after
that is a dead wall like the side of a house, and
there’s no place where a goat could get any further.
And I don't believe there’s another track up the
hill anywhere—l’m dead sure there isn’t —I’d bet
my life on it. Well, then, how did that party get
up there with his trombone, if he is up there, and
if he isn’t there—where is he ? ’■
“ Vou didn’t hear anything when you were here
before, I suppose ? ” asked Percy, nervously.
“ Do you suppose somebody’s been up there
for fifteen years playing his blessed music and
camping out for the fun of the thing ? ”
“ No-o, I don’t mean that. But how would it
bo if they can’t get down
“Then how on earth did they get up?” 1
asked. “ And supposing they did’get up and yet
can’t get down again by the same track, how do
you think anybody lives up there? Do you sup-
pose they plant potatoes and grow oats and have
a high old time, and rear families up among the
clouds? ”
“ Perhaps they’ve been up there always.”
“ Always ! Been born up there you mean, and
never came down, and can’t find a way out of it.
Percy, I’ve known a good many fools, but for an
ass you beat any ass I ever heard of.”
I stopped then, for there was a horrible, roaring,
clattering sound overhead, and a perfect avalanche
of stones came rushing down over our heads.
They hew past us so closely that I could feel a
rush of cold air on my face, and one immense
boulder struck a projecting knob just above us and
broke into a thousand splinters like a bomb-shell
when it bursts.
“I say, for God’s sake let’s get out of this!”
shrieked Percy as he turned a ghastly white.
“ Lie down, you idiot,” yelled Hamilton. And
suiting the action to the word he doubled himself
into an amazingly small compass and squeezed
himself flat against the cliff; “Lie down, and
hold on!”
We were down in the smallest fraction of a
second. Above us there was a crashing, rending,
humming noise, as if some stupendous object
was tearing its way through a mass of vegeta-
tion. Then there was a concussion that made
the ancient rocks shake and quiver, and an
immense tree flew out almost horizontally above
our heads and disappeared into the great, empty
depths below.
And behind it came
It was a man, spinning madly through the
air. He was brown-skinned and naked, and his
long hair flew out behind and all around him.
He came and passed like a flash, but I saw him
turn over and over as he went —now doubled
up—now spread out as if grasping at space for
some support, and then he landed right in the
centre of the little brawling river that foamtd
along far underneath our feet, and was seen no
more. But doubtless the river clutched the un-
recognisable fragments of him with its arms of
foam, and rolled them over and over, and cast
them up, and sucked them in again, and
churned them round and round in its angry
whirlpools, and tore them against stones
and snags and jagged rocks. And at last when it
was tired of this play, it bore away the scattered
remains of the wild man of the mountains, and
swept them out into the far Pacific, where the
long, black locks of his hair rose and fell like sea-
weed witu the ceaseless rhythm of the unrestful
waters, and the shrimps and the prawns ate his
ruins, and the crabs and the lobsters wrestled for
the debris of the feast, and the patient barnacles
walked over his battered bones as they lay on the
floor of the great ocean.
And then far, far above our heads came that
same mournful chorus.
“ Yah-ha aha-yaha ! ”
When the naked visitant from the upper air had
passed and vanished, I deliberately lay down on
the pathway and. clutched the rock with both
hands to keep myself steady, for earth and sky
and mountains seemed to be all dancing a frenzied
jig around me, and gyrating in endless circles,
and tearing round and round in a hideous waltz
that was timed to some dismal rhythm shrieked by
all the lost souls of an Alpine hell. Percy lay
beside me, almost insensible from terror. And
as for Hamilton he craned his neck outwards and
upwards to see if any new dangers were threaten-
ing, and seeing none he finally sat up and laughed
hysterically with chattering teeth, and passed his
hands through his hair.
“ I think we must have disturbed a whole city-
full of niggers,” he said. There’s the rest of the
menagerie raising the same old hymn. What a
chorus!”
He spoke in a strange, jerky fashion, and seemed
to grope for ea,ch word before he uttered it, as if
he were looking for it in the pages of a large
dictionary, and was uncertain about the pronunci-
ation even when he found it.
“Th —th —that was shave,” I gasped; “
close shave—l mean. I suppose that—tree was
meant—for—for us, wasn’t it?”
“ I should rather think it was. And the bricks,
and the rest of the furniture as well.”
“ For heaven’s sake, let’s make a run for it, then,
and get out of this,” implored Percy, huskily,
“ It’s certain death to stay here.”
“We can’t go back, my boy, if that’s what you
mean. We couldn’t get to the bottom again in
less than an hour, and that gang of native
dynamiters ’ll shoot trees at us all the way. We’ll
run for the cave and lie there till dark, and then
we must bolt and —and leave all the gold behind
us,” he added regretfully. “No, I’ll see that
tribe d d twenty-thousand times over before
I’ll do that. I’ll come back and blast every one
of them off his perch with nitro-glycerine first.
I’ll float a company, and we’ll turn the whole
mountain upside-down and shake them off the top
of it into the river. There’s another rock coming
down I expect —come on —we’ve got to run for it,
and no mistake.”
And we ran. The horses had stampeded long
ago, but we travelled faster than any horse could
have carried us over such ground. It was about
200 yards, and we covered it in a few seconds,
though it seemed to take whole ages. There were
awkward turns and angles in the road, and as we
shot round each one I expected to find a vengeful
crowd of strange-looking aborigines ru-hing
down on us, but no single human being
appeared in sight. The wailing chorus had
died away; there were no more missiles booming
down the mountain side; there was nothing, in
fact, but a profound stillness —the Sabbath calm
of long, long centuries, and yet above our heads
somewhere a tribe of raging heathens were per-
vading the mountain top, and getting ready some
new project for our destruction. Then suddenly
we came on a strange sight—a solitary tree grow-
ing out of this world of stone, and a tiny stream
of fresh water that trickled out of the rock, and
beside them was the cave where all that countless
wealth of gold had lain hidden for ages waiting
for us to come and share these untold millions,
and be rich past all human comprehension.
It was only a little depression in the rock—only
that and nothing more. Its walls were bare and
hungry stone, brown and barren and unspeakably
dismal. There was no sign of gold—there had
never been any—there never would be any if we
dug and delved and bored and blasted till the
millennium. It was all emptiness and fraud and
hollow delusion and ruin unutterable. I could
have made as good a gold-mine any day in the
middle of a pavement—l could have made a better

one in an old dry well. It was the only part of
Jack’s recollections that had no foundation —the
mountain and all the other surroundings were
there, but the gold was a delusion and a delirium,
and the whole of that mighty peak wasn’t worth a
copper. And instead of the golden millions there
was a tribe of howling savages overhead, and just
as we g'ained the scanty shelter of the cave the air
was filled with an ear-splitting yell of ferocity and
m dice, and a huge mass —ten tons or more of
solid rock—came plunging down the mountain
side.
It was the first good shot they had made. Ten
yards behind us it struck the crumbling pathway,
and the rock split and rent asunder as if it had
been a wall of earth built up against the hill-
side. And when it was gone we were wrecked
up in the air—stranded hopelessly among the
clouds, with nothing—absolutely nothing—re-
maining but the ledge on which we stood, and the
wall of rock behind us, and the abyss in front and
on either side.
YL
It was nine o’clock when we caught our first
glimpse of the golden mountain, and by eleven
the gold had vanished and the great vision faded,
and everything was over.
The night came and found us still sitting there,
and indulging in dreary speculations as to the
meaning of the great mystery.
“It was hundreds of years, I suppose, since
this road was made—or thousands perhaps,” said
Hamilton. “ The upper part of it must have
fallen in somehow, and that tribe of fiends has
been wrecked at the top and lived there ever
since. Just think of it. Likely enough their
ancestors were there when the Christian era dawned.
Perhaps they were there in Abraham’s time, or
before the Deluge. There may be some of
the patriarchs among them, or some of the giants
that were left over from Noah’s days, or maybe
they’re a lot of ancient Israelites. And I suppose
they’ve lived and married and grown old and died
on the top of this accursed mountain, and they’ve
raised vegetables up there, and caught birds, and
lived on in just the same howling savagery as
their fathers did at the beginning of the world.”
He was in the first stages of a raging fever.
His hands were burning and his eyes glassy and
his cheeks flushed, and he talked on with a wild,
incessant volubility that was maddening to listen
to. ...
“ And all this time they’ve been picking and
gnawing the mountain away, for the only way to
get down is to cut away the rock under their
feet. And when they’ve grubbed the entire peak
to pieces, and worked down to the level ground,
they’ll come out into the world—their remote
descendants will, that is—and what a world
it’ll bo for them. I suppose this was the
highest peak in New Zealand once, and they’ve
torn it up bit by bit with their hands till they’ve
worked down —down— ”
“Jack,” I said; “for God’s sake be rational.
How are we to get out of this ? Never mind
about all the rest.”
“ I suppose we’re the first strangers they’ve
seen for ages, and it’s the nature of the animal,
when lie sees a stranger, to throw something at
him. And that cheerful old father that came
through the air so suddenly, all scattered and
spread out, and with his hair flying behind him—
he must have been lifting for all he was worth to
start the tree over on our heads, and he was too
near the edge, I expect, and when the thing
went over a little faster than he expected,
he went after it. What a surprised-looking per-
son he was as he went past,” and Jack laughed
hysterically at the recollection. “I wonder who
he was ? Some of these old patriarchs in the
Bible seemed as if they never would die. Perhaps
he was one of them. I suppose a patriarch would
last a long time in a healthy atmosphere like
that?”
“Jack, stop that talk, for heaven’s sake. We
must find a way out of this.”
“ Out of this ? Why, there isn’t any way. We
can jump down, of course—the same track that
the naked father took this morning—there isn’t
any other road now. What an ungodly smash
that rock made; if they’d blasted the path away
with dynamite they couldn’t have done it better.
I wonder if we could get up, seeing we can’t get
down, and then we might join the naked clan on
the top, and marry some plain native female
apiece—ha, ha^—and bring up. families and—oh,
what a joke, ha, ha —ha, ha !”
He gave another yell of maniac laughter, and
crawled out along the ledge that still remained
intact in front of the cave. But in a second or two
he turned back again.
“There’s nothing there but the beginning of
universal emptiness —only fresh air and a
cliff that a fly couldn’t climb. No, this is
the finish—the whole game ends right here—a
wall of rook above us, and below us, and on each
side of us, and here we are sitting on our shelf
with our feet hanging over, and there’s no gold
after all—l must have dreamt it, I suppose,
or ”
“Jack, there’s always a chance that some one
may pass along away down there—a prospector or
something of that sort. If we were to call for help
somebody might hear us, and ”
“ Nobody’ll come this way till next century
now. And what difference would it make, any-
how ? It would take half-a-mile of ladder to do
us any good, or else a balloon. They couldnt
shoot meat at us with a gun, or fire jugs of water
at us; you know, or anything like that. It’s all
up, I tell you—oh, I wish the duke there would
stop groaning. He makes me ill.”
Percy was lying at the furthest extremity of the
ledge, a mere huddled-up, half-insensible mass of
clothes and misery and blank, despairing wretched-
ness. Poor Percy ! Some of these clays, when
his lordly uncle has drunk himself into the family
mausoleum, and left all the mortgages and the
pedigree and the hereditary spoons behind him,
somebody will go looking for the heir to all these
gorgeous properties, and no one will dream that
ho is lost among the kites and crows away up in
the Southern Alps.
By-and-by the moon rose and made curious
shadows among the gaunt crags and peaks, and
we tailed off into dejected silence, and sat looking
out solemnly on the silent, weary, changeless
magnificence of the great, unchangeable moun-
tains. And then, after awhile, I somehow fell
into a horrible sleep and dreamed.
I woke again with a start. There was some-
thing touching my face —something that was
slimy and chill, like the cold, dank feet of a bone-
less reptile. And in my ear there sounded a grue-
some, crunch’ng, gritting noise that ——

A man, name unknown, was brought up at
the police-court yesterday, charged with being a
dangerous lunatic at large. He made an inco-
herent statement to the effect that he had taken
to drink owing to his skeleton, and the remains
of two other men, being on the top of an inacces-
sible mountain, and not able to get down, and he
asked the court if it had a ladder half-a-mile loner.
The arresting constable reported that he had

two buttons, a piece of rock weighing three
pounds, and an almost illegible manuscript in an

a week.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS XT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or baking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
January 17, 1894.
Sydney D.T., flushed with the success of its
wordy warfare on the subject of “Should Bachelors
Marry?” and the columns of cheap copy it led to,
set another literary bell-wether adrift last week,
in the person of a correspondent asking why men
don’t marry ? The writer finds that “ colonial ”
man doesn’t marry because he is becoming a
“ unique antithesis of nature ” and a philosopher
per medium of books (which is only skin-deep
philosophy, after all). But there is nothing in
either theory. There is only one general reason
why men don’t marry, and that is—cold cash.
It is not only men who should be blamed for
the depressed marriage-rate - except you find
fault with them as financial failures —on the first-
cause principle. The girl of the period is smart
and wide-awake. She earns money—oftentimes
more money than the swain who comes to woo—
and weighs whether it is a better speculation to
keepin a congenial billet on a neat screw than go
housekeeping with Gussie on less per annum than
her dressmaker’s bills come to in her professional
spinsterhood.
If man is shy of marriage woman is still shyer,
for pecuniary reasons. Danae in the shower of
gold is the allegory of the nineteenth-century girl
—like Danae, she is only approachable in one
way, and there is just as much want of horse-sense
in asking why don’t men marry as in asking
why hasn’t every man a good bank-account? Of
course, every woman likes to own a man at some
time or other, just to show the other women how
she can manage him —but he must be well-to-do,
or there isn’t a bit of fun in it. Woman at the
altar, or woman at the bargain • counter, is
actuated by the same emotions. A wife l'^ 63 to
show off a better husband than she intrinsically
deserves, just as a bargain-hunter tells you with
pride that she got that lovely remnant for two-
and-six. And until a matrimonial bargain comes
her way (which is never, probably), the level-
headed woman keeps very cool in the marriage-
market.
Take my own case, for example. Am Ito fall a
viotiirt to the bow and arrow of some small-salaried
youth who will tell me, perhaps, that he is saving
up to marry me, and will preach economy at me
indirectly all the time we are “ walking out,” so
that I won’t waste the cold mutton in our cottage
by the sea ? Ideal prospect! But still it does not
tempt me—nor does it attract other women who
follow the remunerative professions and prefer
to do a man’s work from “ sun to sun ” than a
woman’s which is “never done.” Hardly one
woman in a hundred who can support herself in
fairly good style, is lured to give up her defined
profession for the uncertain joy of chivvying a
small ’servant round a suburban villa, and listening
to the fall of her bridal china.
Some of the booksellers have fairly revelled in
cheap advt. over the “What do women read”
question. One thing is plainly proved—the novel-
reading female—the curl-papered housekeeper who
“scamps ” her duties to get back to the thrilling
moment when the. long-legged duke goes on one
knee to the virtuous ballet-girl—is still in the vast
majority. Two leading booksellers and the cheap-
subscription-library people say that “ Sydney
ladies are stronger lovers of pure fiction than any
other class of literature. I underline the adjec-
tive, which I regard as a doubtful fit for the
situation.
Because, you see, I don’t believe the virtuous
bookman (whose name figures largely in the article
hereinbefore alluded to) when he says there is no
feminine “enquiry for Zola” at his discreetly-
patronised establishment. What else could he
say ? There are some questions a man of the
wrld never answers, and the bookseller who
advertised his establishment as the resort of
realistic readeresses would find his clients dropping
off in favour of the establishment where the wily
proprietor “ testified ” freely to the rush of Jane
Austen over the front counter, but—lay low about
the steady exit of Balzac by the side door.
The world will never really know for certain
what women read until married men expose the
amount of red and yellow realism that is tucked
away under almost every matronly pillow and in
every connubial fancy work-basket in the land ; or
until innocent small boys detail (in print) what
sister sends them to the library for. You might
as well get at what women drink by deep study of
the or what society women like with
midnight oysters on the authority of the waiter,
as go round with pencil asking for incriminating
data from specified bookshops which know exactly
what to say. To really fathom the workings you
should be a woman and glide up to the counter in
the dim end of the establishment, where you ask
in a disguised voice and three thicknesses of
gossamer-veil for Zola’s very latest, unabridged,
with footnotes, if you please.
The very latest Queensland divorce-case has a
basis of grilled steak, although the lawyers will
doubtless find other terms for the real cause
of the rupture. They were neighbours, and
one day his wife went away (taking the servant
either as a precaution or because she wanted her),
and her husband departed also for the day. When
lunch-time came He tried to grill a steak, and,
failing, handed it over the back fence to Her. She
did it to a turn, and was just handing it back to
Him with the addition of a few vegetables when
her legal steak-eater arrived by tha back-gate and
—but the case won’t be heard in camera , so that’s
anticipating.
Apropos of divorces, I was amused to be told,
the other day, that any lawyer who succeeds in
putting a lady-client through the mill and return-
ing her to society in her maiden name is always
the object of little marks of gratitude for the rest
of his professional life, provided, of course, that
the lady doesn’t wing her way to distant climes.
Bub while she can reach him personally or by
letter, the man of law never knows at what
moment a golden-haired woman with “a past,”
and in the act of handing him a pair of crewelled
braces, won’t be discovered in his office by his
wife. And though even lawyers may be believed
at times—that is emphatically one of the occasions
when the beautiful truth will avail them nob.
A male divorce client, I am told, is not fond of
the lawyer who sets him loose, although there is
an authentic instance of one Sydney lawyer who
is absolutely persecuted with wallabies, sent him
that he may wallow in kangaroo-tail soup (for
which he had owned a partiality, to back-blocks
Lothario, in an unguarded moment). Still, the
male client doesn’t throw a halo of sentiment over
his defender—that he has to pay the piper is,
probably, the reason why he doesn’t follow his
deliverer up with fancy-work after the battle. Bub
emotional woman, it appears, is obstinately grate-
ful for her freedom, and never forgets Dr. Briefless.
I know one Sydney lawyer who is kept in beauti-
ful flowers by a thankful and nob altogether
blameless divorce.
A week ago “ Pro Bono Publico ” and “ Cui
Bono’’were on their mettle in the dailies over
the “white slaves” question, the pallid helots
being certain working girls who labour over nine
and a-quarter hours a day for seven shillings a
week, or from 6 a.m. to 1 a,m. for five shillings a
week, overtime paid at the rate of threepence per
hour ! Think of these exorbitant wages for long
hours of heavy work the next time you “in-
stinctively” draw away from the painted wreck
you meet in the streets at midnight. “It is
easy,” said Becky Sharpe, “to be virtuous on a
thousand a year.”
A woman comments upon the “white slaves’’
question in Sydney. “This matter of grinding the
female labourer down must be settled by Act of
Parliament, and if the employers will not be just,
they must be compelled. I arn proud of our
woman suffragists, who understand politics far
better than some of our paid legislators.” In-
directly accusing men of creating a state of affairs
for which women are largely to blame 1 Who is
it keeps the “ bargain ” counters—the sweater’s
outlet —so brisk? Woman, the cheapener and
haggler, who has a special memory for “sacri-
fice ” sales, and who wouldn’t care if every stitch
were a drop of blood, so long as she saved three-
ha’pence on the article. So, perhaps, the redemp-
tion of the white slaves of Sydney will come more
gracefully from the feminine camp.
I really think we must be growing out of matri-
mony when this kind of advertisement blossoms
brazenly in Sydney D.T. :
"yOUNG MAN seeks earnest) Christian GIRL as
Partnerforeign mission field. “Earnest,” Ox-
ford-st. P.O.
Even the pious youth with the goloshes is taking
to the trial system now.
A Sydney daily which lately published a
“Domain ” article calmly stated, with a relieved
expression, that “ only four women— in each case
accompanied by her husband and children —were
met with, but it was stated by those who knew
the nooks well that a number of women slept
nightly in the open. One case was particularly
distressing. “A family camped under the rocks
had only one blanket, and this was shared by the
woman and her child.”
Still, four women without a shelter is a depress-
ing average for a city like Sydney, and reminds
one that since Miss Myra Kemble gave her
successful performance of “Dr. Bill,” in Sydney
Town Hall, in ’92, there has been no organised
show for the sole benefit of the unemployed
women, in spite of the women-championship of
women which is so popular at present.
Talking of benefit shows, a good charity-concert
is billed to take place on the 2nd Feb., under
most influential patronage headed by the Governor.
MM. Deslouis, Kowalski, Stael, Wiegand, and
other well-known artistes contribute, and all the
proceeds (which I hope will be large) go to the
three little children of Mons. and Mme. La
Meslee, who were drowned in the recent boating
accident in the Harbour, leaving their family
totally unprovided for. The concert promises to
be rather a huge affair as M. La Meslee was con-
nected with the Civil Service and several learned
societies whose members are actively interested in
the affair.
As I predicted, the clever Crystal Maze in
Sydney Strand, where you see yourself north,
east, south and west without turning your head —
is a happy hunting-ground for the wearers of new
dresses (and new suits, for that matter, since the
masculine mind also appreciates a pleasant back
view) who can see if the double skirt suits them
all round the figure and then have tea and ices (in
a cool grotto with a sparkling electric fountain —
the first in Australia) without extra charge. On
these lines the Maze prospers. Clever is the
showman who includes a free cup of tea in his list
of attractions.
A Sydney evening paper has discovered that a
“well-known society lady ” is giving dual swim-
ming parties in a suburban ocean “basin” by
moonlight. However, the fact that the lady in
question bathes with her assorted friends is no
criterion that “good society” is addicted to
entertaining its visiting-list in a hired pool by
moonlight. As a matter of fashion, dual-bathing
is not good form at all in Sydney, and isn’t likely
to become so under present arrangements.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMIH.
Melbourne, Jan. 17th, 1894.
The Hopetouns are off on a driving tour.
Every nerve is strained to live up to the bush,
and if the belted Earl can’t easily persuade the
billy to get its steam up he feels his discomfiture
very keenly. I am told Lady H., mixing a
damper, is picturesque, but should the hereditary
De Moleyns’ hands suffer thereby, the South
Yarra people will miss the rapture of seeing a
Countess remove her gloves in the tabernacle and
knit her naked fingers in prayer.
Of late, though, the Sunday morning pilgrimage
to South Yarra is quite a rare event. St. Paul’s
Cathedral has been “taken up” by the first
worshipper in the land, and when the air is
balmy (and the odour of ooze from the river
doesn’t get into one’s piety) she may seen
walking across Prince’s Bridge to Guv’ment
House, a bright, Christian example in a dim
religious frock, attended by lots of suite. Several
of the suite things in men are staunch supporters
of the cathedral. They drop in for afternoon
service during the week, and have been heard to
remark that the musical entertainment is not at
all bad, doncherknow.
A scion of the most famous “ boom and bust ”
families nearly won a considerable academical
distinction, the other day. Wasn’t it she, who,
though one of eleven, had a lady’s-maid all to her-
self, and, after the manner of budding Vere de
Veres, came down to dessert every evening in
velvet frock and silk stockings? Allis lost but
brains, which she can possess without detriment
to other people, if that’s much consolation. And
brains don’t seem to count for much at the critical
moment when a vacuous young man commences
to wink his other eye. That’s where the female
intellect breaks down, somehow.
“Pinafore,” by the Hawthorn amateurs, was a
financial if not a musical triumph. Non-profes-
sionals never understand “making up,” and the
sisters, cousins, and aunts, on this occasion, were
no exception to the rule, one lady’s “pearl-
creamed” ears standing out with ghastly effect.
A popular medico made a tempting A. 8., and all
the leading lights of the district were to be seen
in the audience.
My ideas concerning the Royal visit fiasco are a
little late, but I throw them into the discussion
without apologising. Premier Patterson, as an
old family man, knew what he was about in
inviting the Yorks at the present “juncture.”
Two Ministers of State must be present at the birth
of an heir to the throne. Imagine the honour and
glory accruing to the Victorian Premier had he been
called upon to wait in the ante-room upon so
auspicious an occasion to bear witness to the bona
fides of the red little stranger!!
You may be sure that York at once put down
his foot. “I ain’t going,” he said, gloomily, as a
vision of life on the ocean wave, with a cargo of
doctors, nurses, feeding-bottles, god-fathers, god-
mothers, Lords-Chamberlain, &0., &c., crossed his
mental vision. And May interpolated her dulcet
tones: “Suppose that George Albert Victor
Edward Alexander George Leopold Duncan
Patrick were born with the colonial twang!”
They would none of them take kindly to the
notion of tightening the silken bonds with a
“ twang.”
“Victoria’s most “ horsey ” heiress seems wedded
to her serge gown, pale-blue blouse and straw
sailor hat. Perhaps, to atone for some very
venial, blue-blooded error, she sports this garb in
lieu of sack-cloth and ashes. No other explana-
tion suggests itself to me after a fifteenth consecu-
tive meeting with the same cheap toilette. But
what wouldn’t some of us wear if we did the Block
in her boots!
At the Sargoods’ moonlight garden-party, just
before Xmas, the moon and the women were
wrapped in clouds, and neither showed to advan-
tage. In Spain, or even Sydney, where colds in
the head are unknown and complexions only “ so-
so,” women may look their best strolling by the
light of the moon, robed in white. It’s different
with the Melb. girls. They are too blooming to
fear daylight, and when muffled in shawls on a
dull night, are not ethereal enough to avoid com-
parison with cows looming through a mist.
Rumour has it that a law-suit is impending over
the Chief Justice's .£5O prize, which falls to the
top scorer in the final law exam. Two young
“ softies ” are said to have agreed that if either
of them gained the award, he would share it with
his chum. The winner now refuses to pay up,
and his quondam friend has issued or threatens
a writ against him for breach of agreement.
Talking of rash promises, the town has been
amused by the adventures of a youth in a some-
what conspicuous circle, who, at the tender age of
18, promised to marry the lady-help, a young
thing of 29, and was sternly held to his word.
Pa burst into tears on hearing of Voung Hopeful’s
matrimonial fix, exclaiming—“My poor blue-eyed
boy ! ”
Gov. Hopetoun is ageing in wisdom consider*
ably. At school speech-days he is most effective!
his frock-coat being in itself an educational in’
fluenoe. No buttonhole blossom invades the
sanctity of this garment, which (as I heard a
strong-minded lady observe) has enough stuff in it
to clothe half-a-dozen families. Now, at flower-
shows and exhibitions our Gov. reminds one of
the girl who thinks it suits her to be animated.
Rolling his eyes from side to side in simulated
ecstasy, he heads straight for t:ie nearest escape
door, chanting en route the praises of the exhibits
he hasn’t attempted to notice.
Like Max O’Rell’s ‘‘Mrs. John Bu’l,” Lady
Hopetoun follows meekly at the guid man’s heels,
her Sphinx-like silence in marked contrast to his
loquacity. By-the-bye, there is no blinking the
fact that her ladyship is developing what old-
fashioned novels call “a majestic presence” and
will soon be the typical British matron in appear-
ance.
Bishop Webber (Brisbane) still frisks in Eng-
land, leaving his curates and lambs in general to
wander where they will. Last trip his celibate
clergy seized the chance and got married. ‘‘lt’s
all very well,” they grumbled, “ for ‘ Brisbane’ to
talk platonically about ‘Ladies X. and Y., de-
voted noble women,’ who take such interest in
Brisbane’s career, but then he’s a weathi r-beaten
old prelate, while we’re all under 25, and were ex-
pressly chosen, with rosy cheeks and small hands,
for proselytising purposes.” Spinster interest in
the careers of such of these is not to bo put off
with a mere brotherly blessing. I know of at least
one northern damsel who carried her point by
seating herself unexpectedly upon a chubby
cherub’s knee and asking him to hear her say her
catechism. An offer of marriage was made and
accepted within five minutes.
Depression in Melb. is so marked that the only
way for even the upper-crust mothers to get their
daughters off is to take in a few “ paying guests”
—the new haul ton name for lodgers. This ruse
is occasionally successful, as shown recently by a
very fashionable—on one side, anyhow—suburban
wedding.
The “Seventh Day Adventists ” are out for an
airing at Middle Brighton. One can take a tent
only by solemnly subscribing to the doctrine that
men with pipes or women in corsets cannot pos-
sibly enter the kingdom of Heaven. Otherwise,
worse ways might be found of spending a holiday.
The brethren tie up their heads in mosquito-net
bags, but whether from religious scruples or
merely to keep off the flies I did not discover. The
sisters are comely, and one, seated on a crazy quilt
in an aesthetic tent, seemed to be appreciated. The
Rev. Mrs. White, of Amurrika, who boasts that
her voice comes from her stomach, delivers dis-
courses on “ the raring of chil-dern,” “ the lik-ker
appit-tite,” and other exciting topics. An un-
girded style of dress and vegetarian diet have
dealt hardly with this lady’s outer husk, but I am
told she is spiritually beautiful.
Talking of spiritual beauty, D’Argo’s nether
complements have never appeared to better advan-
tage than in the dreamy whirl she gives us for an
encore in the Princess’ Panto. Her Blue Ballet
efforts are grotesque in the eyes of most women,
whatever they may have been in the opera-glasses
of the balder sex. The toe-waltz of D’Argo up-to-
date is a graceful, rhythmical dance from the
shoulders downwards (though stiff-neckish at the
summit), and it fetches the boys exceedingly. The
other Saturday afternoon I met the muscular Sig-
norina, who is quite young and freshly pretty,
emerging from the stage entrance passage clad in
tight-fitting tweed and bearing a brace of bouquets.
She had done her turn and was away to the
adjacent boarding-house to put her trophies in
water. They evidently represented a pair of hard-
hit Johnnies, and had nothing in common with
the ordinary bunch of stale vegetables provided by
a management.
Little Vi. Varley seems to have dropped out of
the floral tribute struggle since her engagement to
a member of the profesh was cruelly given awav
to the outside world. Reports as to Violet’s
wedding fixture are conflicting, by the way. It is
whispered in some places that Tapley will claim
his bride at the end of the pantomime run, yet
elsewhere they speak of a long wait intervening.
Theatrical marriages, although made in Heaven,
like the rest of them, are apt to be regulated in
their course by business contracts.
VAN M.
Premier Nelson repeats the statement that
Queensland kanakas are kept to field labour—“not
employed as in the old days as nursemaids, grooms,
garden hands, and so on.” A few months ago the
present writer was on a Queensland plantation,
not far from Townsville, where kanakas did all
these things, and chopped wood, cleared roads,
shod horses, and worked in the mill as well.
The owners of the plantation stood well at head-
quarters, and the inspector, who was getting con-
victions against small farmers at Mackay, knew
better than to interfere.
M’llwraith must have credit for this, cut
from Singapore Times, 12th Dec. :
Reporter: “ Why do you exclude Chinese ; they would
be of greater use to you in developing your country,
would they not?”
M'llwraith: “ Well, the fact is they have been tried,
but unsuccessfully. They are most difficult customers to
manage in large numbers. Then, when they enter in to com-
petition with white men there can be only one result. I be-
lieve that a white man will get through six times as much
work as a Chinaman—[Nonsense.—Ed. B.]-and will do it
more satisfactorily for his employer. Idonot think it fair to
our own men to ask them to compete with the Chinamen.
You know how little suffices for a Chinaman. On the
other hand we have been educating our working men and
teaching them the advantage of having pretty, well-
furnished homes, of living in more luxurious style and
dressing better, and they cannot do all that if wages are
to be reduced by competition with the Chinese.”
A Hobart Mercury correspondent :
Christraas-bells are ringing, and the choristers are sing-
ing, while thousands of good people are assembled in
sacred edifices to publicly declare once more their adora-
tion and their joyful acceptance of God’s wonderful gift.
Soft breezes pass in through the window's and fan the
faces of the worshippers, and toy with the ladies’ laces
and the pretty blossoms in their new summer bonnets,
then after caressing the locks of the children in the
various pews they lightly touch the preacher’s forehead
and pass out to loiter in a clump of trees, while other
wandering zephyrs find their way into the church and re-
peat the fanning, toying, and caressing for a litlle space.

The greatest treat you can give yourself,
or your friend in the country, is a Maoriland
smoked blue cod. The blue cod, as prepared for
and sold by the N.S. W. Fresh Food and Ice Co.,
King-street, Sydney, is the premier fish of Aus-
tralasian waters. Eating smoked blue cod is nob
a mere habit—it is a disease. This incomparable
fish, which, with a great variety of others (list on
application), is received per every steamer by the
F. F. and I. Co., should be on every breakfast-
table in town and country. The provincial hotel-
keeper who fails to supply the drummer with
smoked blue cod for breakfast doesn’t understand
Ids business and is on the high road to the Insol-
vent Court.

A Ponapean Conveuance.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Here also, as at Yap, the youngest wives of the chiefs
visited the frigate. . . . Somewhat shocking at first
to our feelings as Christians. . . . Yet to have de-
clined what was regarded by these simple and amiable
people as the very highest token of their regard for the
officers of the Expedition would have been bitterly re-
sented. . . . And, after all, our duties to our King
and Queen were paramount- i.e., ‘the foundation of
friendly relations with the people of this Archipelago.’
. . . The engaging manners and modest demeanour of
these native ladies were most commendable. That this
embarrassing custom was practised to do us especial
honour we had ample proof.”
# * *
Chester, the trader, laid down the book
and looked curiously at the title—“ A Journal of
the Expedition under Don Felipe Tompson
through the Caroline Islands.” It was in Spanish,
and had been lent him by one of the Jesuit fathers
in Ponape.
“Ninety years haven’t worked much difference
in some of the native customs,” thought he to
himself. “ What a sensation Don Felipe would
have made lecturing at St. James’ Hall on these
pleasantly curious customs ! I must ask Tulpe
about these queer little functions. She’s chock-
full of Island lore—and perhaps I’ll make a book
myself some day.”
* * *
“ Huh /” said Tulpe, Chester’s native
wife, whipping off her muslin gown and tossing it
aside, as she lay back and cooled her heated face
and bared bosom with a fan, “ ’tis hot, Khesta,
and the sun was balanced in the middle of the sky
when we left Jakoits in the boat, and now ’tis all
but night; and wind there was none, so we used
noc the sail.”
“ Foolish creature,” said Chester, again taking
up his book, “and merely to see this new white
missionary woman thou wilt let the sun take thy
hands and feet black.”
Handsome, black-browed Tulpe flashed her
white, even teeth as she smiled.
“Nay, but listen, Khesta. Such a woman as
this one I have never seen. Her skin is white
and gleaming as the inside of the pearl-shell.
How comes it, my white man, that such a fair
woman as this marrieth so mean-looking a man?
Was she a slave ? Were she a woman of Ponape,
and of good blood, Nanakin the Great would take
her to wife.”
“ Aye,” said Chester, lazily, “and whence came
she and her husband ?”
“From Kusaie (Strong’s Island), where, for
two years, have they lived, so that now the woman
speaketh our tongue as well as thee.”
“ Ha !” said the trader, quickly; “ what is their
name ?”
She told him, and Chester suddenly felt uncom-
fortable.
* w *
Two years before, in Honolulu, he had
met that white woman. She was waiting to be
married to the Rev. Obadiah Yowlman, a hard-
faced, earnest-minded little Yankee missionary,
who was coming up from the Carolines in the
Planet. There had been some rather heavy love-
passages between her and Chester. He preserved
his mental equilibrium she lost hers. The
passionate outburst of the “little she-missionary ”
as be called her when he bade her good-bye, he
regarded as the natural and consistent corollary
°f moonlit nights beneath the waving palms of
white Hawaiian beaches. When he returned to
Bonape he simply forgot all about her.
* •
* *
I wonder IIOW Tulpe would take it if she
knew ?” he thought. “ She’s a bit of a tiger ”
t 7 ’I I*’ 1 *’ Khcsto! ” and Tolpc
cane over to him and leant upon his shoulder.
is it in thy mind to see and talk with the new
missionary and his wife ? ”
“No,” said Chester promptly, “sit thou here,
wood-pigeon, and tell me of the customs I here
read of.”
She sat down beside him and leant her dark
¥ ad againsfc , h J. s knee fanning himself the while
she answered his questions,
~ . , .. * , *

And it it were to advantage thee I would do hke-
wise. For is it not the duty of a woman to let
the world see how great is her love for her hus-
band? And if a great chief from or the king of
th y land came here, would I not obey thee?”
She turned and looked up into his face silently
for a few moments, then rose.
“! know thy meaning now. But surely this
mean-faced missionary is not to be compared to
thee! Khesta, ’tis the fair-faced woman that is
in thy mind. Be it as you will. Yet I knew not
that the customs of thy land were like unto ours.”
JSarly next morning Tulpe was gone,
» • •
„ D it nofc whifce woman . If thou
d()st not ' love my husband, how came it that
y es t er( j. X y thou asked his name of me? See now,
I deal fairly with thee. For three days will I
sta y here, although thy husband is but as a hog
j n my e y eSj f or he is poor and mean-looking, while
rn j ne j s — we ll, thou hast seen him, and for three
days sbalt tbou stay in my house. So get thee
awa y, then—the boat waits.”
Pretty Mrs. Yowlman fled to her room and,
won( j ering whether Chester knew, began to cry,
w hile Tulpe sab down, and, rolling a cigarette,
resigne( jly awaited the appearance of the Rev.
Qbadiah Yowlman.
An hour afterwards the rev. gentleman came in
with Chester, who had walked across the island
on c p seover i ng Tulpe’s absence,
“No, thank you,” he said to the missionary,
“J won’t stay now. . . . Some other time I
will do myself the pleasure of calling upon you
an( j Mrs. Yowlman. . . . You must excuse
m y w ife having called upon you twice. She is
deeply imbued with the native customs and
observances, and I—er—sincerely trust she has
given no offence.”
Then took he Tulpe’s hand and led her,
wondering, to his home.

Scene : A barrister’s chambers in Eliza-
beth-street, Sydney. Frantic voice yelling over
the bannisters, “Hi ! stop him 1 stop him ! He’s
got my coat!”
Fortunately for the owner of the coat, a large
Q.O. was just coming up the stairs and effectually
blocked the way. The thief gave in at once and
turned back.
“It’s very sad to see such a respectable-looking
man going in for this sort of game,” said the Q.C.
as he shepherded him up.
“ I don’t know what made me do it. I’m sure
I don’t know what made me do it. Such a thing
has never happened before,” said the respectable-
looking man; “ I suppose you’ll send for the
police ?”
“ I suppose I shall,” said the owner of the coat,
shortly, snatching it out of his hand. “ Edward ”
—to the suckling who acted as his clerk—“go out
at once and get a constable.”
Edward presumably looked diligently for a
constable. Presently, however, he came back
without one.
“There’s no p’leecemen anywhere, sir.”
“ Damn fool! ” said his master; “ I s’pose I’ll
have to go for one myself.”
But his indignation had oozed out considerably
daring the delay.
“Yes, it’s inexpressibly shocking to see a man
of so respectable an appearance in this position,”
tentatively observed he to the large Q.O.
“Very sad!” It was obvious they were now
somewhat inclined to mercy.
“My God ! I’m sure I don’t know how I could
have done it. Never before, on my honour, never
gentlemen,” declared the respectable-looking man,
giggling convulsively.
“Poor devil, he’s hysterical!” said the large
Q.C. Aside: “ Don’t press it.”
The owner of the rescued coat nodded.

Utilisation of Australian
Timbers.
. The settler upon the river-lands of New
South Wales, when battling with the gigantic
vegetation that seems to him a barrier to all his
hopes of future comfort and independence, prac-
tically despises the timbers which his all-com-
pelling cross-cut saw, axe, or forest-devil “drops,”
uses them up in fencing, or burns them up as
rubbish—anything to get rid of them! But at
least one eminent and enterprising Sydney firm
has demonstrated the fact that Australian timbers,
skilfully manipulated, possess a sterling com-
mercial value applicable to the utilitarian arts.
“ Australian timber is the very best timber in
the world for furniture-making and durable
cabinet-work, I don’t care what other timber you
name, or whence you obtain it. It is better
than Spanish mahogany or American walnut.
Those timbers do not come near the Australian,
either for beauty or durability, which are the two
essentials to be looked for,”
The speaker was Mr. Stutchbury, manager of
Beale and Co.’s factory, at Nelson-street, Annan-
dale.
Beale and Co. constitute a Sydney firm whose
name is a household word throughout N.S. Wales,
and which has branches in almost every town of
any importance within the province. It owns a
block of two handsome six-storeyed warehouses at
482 and 484 George-street, Sydney, with a base-
ment leased as a cafe and billiard-rooms, and a
cellarage beneath the basement. It also owns the
factory referred to.
Beale and Co. are popularly associated in the
public cognisance with sewing - machines and
musical instruments—organs, pianos, &c. But
their propagation of native industries is but im-
perfectly known. A visit to their Annandale
factory is at once a revelation and an education.
• • *
The familiar sewing-machine, the house-
wife’s friend and potent ally, is usually pictured
by the uncommercial imagination whenever its
consideration comes within the mental horizon, as
an article imported bodily from abroad —from
America, or Germany, or England. In many
instances in which such a presentment is filed it is
a true bill.
Beale and Co., so far as their very large output
is concerned, “have changed all that.” They
confine their importations merely to the “heads ”
of sewing-machines, and to the interiors of organs
while they manufacture all the “ tables ” and
“ cabinets ” and “ frameworks ” themselves. And
in this manufacture they use nothing but Aus-
tralian timbers, using up many hundreds of thou-
sands of feet (superficies in sawn planks) per
year.
“ Wei maintain,” avers the manager, “ that we
are selling a better, a better-looking, a more sub-
stantial, and a higher-class article than any im-
ported cabinet-work.”
The favourite timbers used are rosewood (well
known) and red-bean and black-bean—the beans
being peculiarly beautiful woods for every kind of
artii-tic furniture-work.
“ We are just now getting ready for our New
Year’s stock,” remarked Mr. Stutchbury;
“several hundreds of logs. In fact, some of it
has already arrived and is being cut to our re-
quired thicknesses at Goodlet and Smith’s saw-
mills, Sydney. We believe in giving Australian
industries every possible chance. We use no im-
ported timbers. Our factory thus assists to keep
going Australian timber-getters, Australian ship-
pers, Australian saw-millers. All the money that
the factory sends into circulation is spent in °’K
own country.”
• • •
Following the adventures of an Australian
log, after it has left its birthplace ; It is shipped
per coaster to a Sydney sawmill, there sawn into
planks, and conveyed to the stacking-yard of
Beale and Co.’s Annandale factory, which stands
upon a considerable area of ground in that manu-
facturing Sydney suburb. The planks are stacked
upon timber-staging, about 4ft. from the ground;
laid horizontally, with small battens between
each plank, so as to permit the air to circulate
freely through the interspaces.
“ This seems a small matter,” observed the
manager; “it is really a first essential. Many
builders, as you may have noticed, stack their
weatherboard timbers upended. Well, these get
tolerably dry and sound at the end that is aloft;
but the end that is on the ground retains moisture
and sap. Consequently, not only does the timber
warp, but it weakens and developes a tendency to
split. We find out all these little details by
experience. I have been in the timber business
all my life.”
The planks, when stacked, are given at least 12
months’ natural seasoning—seasoning in the open
air, away off the ground, with each plank free
from every other, as explained already. Some-
times the planks get 18 months’ or two years’
natural seasoning ; 12 months is the minimum
limit. After this preparation, the timber is ready
for being handled. But it has to go through other
stages of artificial seasoning in its process towards
artistic utility.
The timber is now cut into the various lengths
necessary for the several purposes to which it is to
be applied ; and, being so cut—by the thousand of
each sample—it is placed in a drying-room, the
maximum temperature of which is about 130 deg.
Fahrenheit. Here, it has a preliminary perspira-
tion, but its troubles have only commenced. From
this it is taken into a second and more sweltering
drying-room, where it stays for about a month, in
a temperature whose midday maximum rises to
about 170 deg. Fahrenheit. This Sheolian process
is designed, not so much with a view to dry the
timber, as its longnatural seasoning has thoroughly
achieved that result, but to test its fibre, its capa-
city of durability, and to ensure that it will not
split when subjected to the further trying tortures
of the cabinet-maker’s art.
# » #
One of the most useful and uncomplaining
employees of the factory is the “ waste-steam ”
from the boiler, if it be not paradoxical to call
“ waste ” that which is used up in a hundred
ways, over and over again, before it is allowed to
escape to liberty in the atmosphere. One engine
drives all the numerous mechanical machines in
the factory; it turns, in the first place, 99 feet of
mainshafting, and, in the second, some 150 feet of
counter, or branch, shafting. The principal fuel
used is the “waste” of the factory—shavings;
and a roaring furnace they make. The furnace,
by the way, is the only flame to be found on the
premises; and, as that is banked up every night,
and everything near the furnace is carefully
<wept up and cleaned away, there is no risk of
fire in connection with any of the working opera-
Uons. All the heat-producing work of the factory
is performed by the “ waste-steam ” aforesaid.
An impressive lesson in utilitarian economy is
afforded by this “waste steam.” After it leaves
the boiler, it circulates through pipes that visit
various drying - rooms, “hot-boxes,” glueing-
chambers, etc., working ceaselessly in the testing
of timbers, boiling of glne, heating of apparatus,
and performing a number of other services too
trivial to mention, but highly necessary to the
uninterrupted regularity of the work of the estab-
lishment. Not the least grateful of its uses is its
heating of a spare boiler, by simply turning on a
tap, so as to enable the factory “ hands ” to boil
water for their midday or other tea. The ap-
pliances areso arranged at various vantage-points
that, if it is desired to heat, melt, or boil any-
thing, the turning of a brass cock effects the
desired end by placing the steam-service at the
operator’s disposal. The working fire-risk is thus
absolutely nil.
• * *
Beale and Co. do not limit their cabinet-
work to sewing-machines, but also do a large
manufacturing trade in organs, for the excellence
of which the firm is famous. It is a popular fallacy
that an organ is imported whole by Beale and Co.
Not so. The firm merely imports what the trade
technically, if somewhat barbarously, styles “the
gut ’ of the instrument—that is to say, the reeds
and the keyboard. The bellows and the case—
how handsome and ornamental some of these cases
are, patrons of the firm well know—are manu-
factured in the Annandale factory. And every
inch of the timber used in this high-class and
artistically-finished work is Australian, not one
scrap of foreign timber entering into the finished
framework.
• • •
The timber is first cut in the rough, in
sizes for tables, flaps, panels, doors, drawers, etc.,
all the machinery arrangements being so exact
that every one table of a certain pattern is exactly
the same size and shape as every other table of
that pattern ; each drawer is interchangeable with
every other drawer of that size, and so on. The
timber is planed by machinery, sorted out into
various sections, and sent for its probation in the
first hot-room (130 deg.). This room, though the
first as regards the reception of cut-up timber, is
the last in respect of the “waste-steam,” which
has circulated all through the building before it
arrives here, where is its escape-pipe, whence it
issues hissingly, as if glad on account of its final
happy release.
Having successfully endured the testing experi-
ments required by this hot-room, and its more
grievous successor (170 deg.), the timber, in work-
ing samples, passes through the various depart-
ments, starting from the rear of the premises “ in
the rough,” until it emerges from the “issuing-
room ” in front as finished work, part and parcel
of the handsome articles of cabinet furniture one
sees in that apartment.
* • #
There are two planing-machines, steam-
worked, which shave the various samples to the
exact thickness—or should it be called thinness?—
required; and their nicety of operation and speed
is so noticeable as to force the thought that the
possibility of such results would be unbelievable
were the living facts not before one’s eyes. A
band-saw for cutting ornamental suites is a thin,
ribandy, fine saw, fixed vertically; and which,
working always from the outside of a piece of
timber, is capable of the most astonishing curvi-
linear feats, performed in a few seconds—with a
whizz (so to speak).
The fret-saw is also fixed vertically, but the
work of this beautiful tool is all from the inside of
the timber, and has to be started by means of an
auger-hole. Not that any time is lost by a man
painfully boring holes by hand in the timbers to
be “fretted.” Apiece is simply held against a
horizontally-placed and swiftly-revolving auger in
a boring-machine moved by steam ; five seconds,
and the hole is made through an inch-thick board
—l2 a minute; 720 an hour, with no trouble, and
with such simplicity that an idiot boy could per-
form the task.
The fret-saw is then fixed, so as to work from
inside the auger-hole, and the operator at the
table can now produce the most complicated
designs of filigree work, with a swiftness that is
marvellous, the designs being simply traced in
“carpenter’s leadpencil ” on the wood beforehand
traced, probably, by outlining from a metal
pattern, The secret of the fret-saw, thus
arranged, is that its teeth are so set that it only
cuts with a downward stroke; the up-stroke is
lost. The saw is, otherwise, thin and narrow,
like the band-saw, and so, with a wasted up-stroke,
it is able to turn a sudden line at right-angles to
the line it has been cutting, without any disfigure-
ment of the angle, and with the exactitude that
can turn out thousands of samples, any one of
which is interchangeable with any other.
The writer saw a large number of sewing-
machine tables dealt with in a few minutes—say,
half-a-minute to each—the fret-saw cutting out
that four-sided “hole” through which the “head ”
of a sewing-machine uplifts itself. The operator
simply ripped them through “like winking,” the
saw seeming to cling to the exact pencil-mark by a
sort of lightning instinct.
• • *
All the lower floor is known by the
*’ house ” name of “ the mill,” and it is here that
all the preparatory and rougher work is done.
Yet, “the mill” shows some beautiful processes.
The “ variety moulder ” is a tool that astonishes
an outsider. Its purpose is the making of mould-
ings for any class of cabinet-work. It can be
gauged to any size, and it can cut and “ mould ”
to any shape, according to the article required.
At the same time that it is executing the mould-
ing of (say) a sewing-machine table, it can cut out
the outline after any given pattern—square, or in
serpentine curves, for instance.
The “ variety moulder ” in the mill is an excep-
tionally large and powerful one—much larger and
more powerful than any that can be imported,
without being specially manufactured to order.
This machine, indeed, was made by Beale and Co.
themselves, as a necessity for their work. It has
a wonderfully strong spring, and cutters that
mean and perform business. A feature here is a
very heavy guide, and the prevention, by means
of protecting guards, of all possibility of hand-
approach to the cutters. Thus, though all the
moulding can be done with the greatest ease,
speed and accuracy, it is not possible for a careless
workman’s hand to slip on to the cutters or
knives. Of course, a skilled workman could
operate without these guards—with “an open
head,” as it is_ termed—but factory experience
shows that the time comes at last when a momen-
tary inattention, a second’s carelessness, lets him
in for a life-maiming—the loss of a finger or two,
at the very least. Here, it is not possible for the
most careless operator to come to grief. The
guide keeps the timber in its proper place; the
guard prevents the operator’s hands from coming
near the cutters even by accident. It is a rigid
policy in this factory to have every otherwise
dangerous machine thus protected.
After (say) a table—and by a “table” in this
factory is generally understood a sewing-machine
table —comes from the planing-machine, though
it looks smooth to the eye, it awakens a roughness
to the touch. Therefore, it is sent on to the sand-
papering machine—another ingenuity of Beale
and Co.’s own make. 'Hie table is placed flat
upon a strong stand, held by screw leverage in the
exact required position, and sandpapered by
machinery. This is effected by means of a drum,
revolving laterally with great rapidity, and
depending by a shaft from a sort of moveable
crane arrangement which permits this revolving
drum to be whisked along over every part of the
surface of the wood at the will of the operator.
The table comes out with a surface as smooth as
glass, and is now ready for the polishing-room.

Did you ever notice the “ corner orna-
ments ” on the mouldings of a sewing-machine
cover like variations of gigantic chess-pieces?
These are not what they seem. Two are some-
times really only one; again, four are only one.
That is to say, the “ornament” or “chess-piece”
is first turned out and polished as a whole, and
then divided by the finest of fine circular saws.
Perhaps a quarter is wedged out, as one wedges
out a slice of cheese, and the resulting parts —the
three-quarter piece and the quarter—are re-
spectively inserted in the mouldings, with great
ornamental effect, to look like two wholes. Per-
haps the “chess-piece” is quartered (lengthwise)
and the four parts are placed so as to seem four
whole ornaments. The writer witnessed a sample
of this quartering. It was done, as everything
else in the cabinet-making line is done, by steam
machinery. There was no trouble nor complica-
tion. The “chess-piece ” had merely to be placed
in the adjustment and run along against a cir-
cular saw, which was horizontally revolving. This
saw is so exceedingly fine that it makes its razor-
like cuts without seeming to take away any of the
wood at all, a few grains only of sawdust being
perceptible as the waste of its work. This useful
tool was also made on the premises specially for
the work to which it has been put.
• # #
Upstairs, the visitor arrives at the “cabi-
net shop.” His first encounter is with another
“ variety moulder,” and as this is a bought one
he is enabled to at once see the vast superiority of
the larger and more powerful home-made one in
“ the mill.” The “ variety moulder ” upstairs is
a very small one and is only fit for light work,
such as the moulding of sewing-machine drawer-
ends.
Sewing-machine drawers are turned out by the
thousand, each size of drawers has every one of
each sample exactly the same fit in every parti-
cular, so that if a drawer at any time is broken or
lost, the owner of the damaged machine need only
send to Beale and Co. and say—“ I want such-
and-such a drawer,” and a new one can be imme-
diately forwarded, warranted to fit exactly the
vacant compartment.
The drawers are creditable specimens of fine
workmanship. They are all dovetailed, or what
is called “ lock-cornered.” The “look-cornering ”
is executed by a most ingenious machine, which is
difficult of description in an untechnical way.
Around a horizontal shaft there is a “worm ” of
cutters or blades, each blade being at a carefully-
arranged distance from the next. When station-
ary, the blades are in the mutual attitude of
points on a straight spiral; but, set the shaft
revolving rapidly, and the blades cut equi-distant
parallel slots, actually while in motion performing
the work of as many saws as there are blades. It
is the same in effect as if there were so many
parallel saws working upon the underneath sur-
face of a body passed over them.
The drawer-sides are packed, ends downwards,
in an adjustment, screw-levered securely, and
caused to traverse over this revolving bladed
worm. The writer saw about 400 slots thus cut in
one operation that lasted not half-a-minute. And
every slot was exactly the counterpart of every
other slot, and every projection fitted every slot
in every other piece, so that by just putting the
two slotted ends together, and giving a couple of
taps with a hammer, one had as beautiful a piece
of dovetailing work—staunch and firm—as one
could desire. When further dovetailed with the
other side and with the bottom of the drawer, and
submitted to the insinuation of glue, a drawer
becomes practically unbreakable, except by sledge-
hammer violence. n
• * *
Some excellent quilted panelling is turned
out by a specially-constructed grooving or milling
machine. The panel is “ reeded ” first; that is
to say, parallel mouldings, all running lengthwise,
are formed. Any pattern can be followed, and
the ingenuity of the manager and others is con-
tinually being exercised in the invention of new
designs, some of which are very elaborate and
strikingly picturesque. After being “reeded,”
the piece is turned sideways, and the mouldings
are crossed by others, thus producing a quilted
pattern that quite charms the vision.
The machine that performs this fine work is
nearly automatic in its action; a man could
almost handle it blindfolded. It is of Beale and
Co.’s own making, and after Mr. Stucchbury’s
own resign. “There is not another machineflike
it in New South Wales, doing the same class of
work,” proudly says the designer; and, indeed,
the machine executes moulding of any kind
reeding, quilting, crosscutting, ribbing, grooving,
&c., &c., after any fanciful pattern the operator
may please.
The cabinet-shop is supplied with similar appli-
ances to those found in the “mill,” but mostly
lighter and for smaller and more delicate work.
Up here, we meet again our old friend, the
“ waste steam,” Vessels of glue, boiling away
without any apparent cause, betray its presence
and influence, and here again is another “hot-
box,” in which the parts to be dovetailed and
glued are heated. The assigned reason for this
heating is that the heat opens the pores of the
wood; the glue then enters those pores, as the
two parts to be joined are dovetailed with each
other; all the glue that has not entered into the
pores is thus squeezed out, and the two pieces of
wood are veritably and actually amalgamated into
one piece. Great stress is laid on the fact that
there is no cake of glue in between the dove-
tailing, or joints; and it is said that, in nine cases
out of ten, the timber would break everywhere
else before the joinings will give way.
One revolving-drum in the cabinet-shop runs by
itself a sort of semi-sub-department, and drives
four small machines devoted to the work of
cutting-up thousands of tender pieces of small
stuff into the various sizes necessary for the sides
and ends of small drawers. There is a circular
crosscut saw, so fixed that its “fence” is square
with itself, and thus when the “fence”is pushed
forward, presenting to the saw the sample to be
worked up, the operator cannot help cutting each
piece truly square ; and, by the aid of the gauge,
each of equal size with the rest. Thus again pro-
viding thousands of pieces, of exactly similar sizes
and shapes, any one of which may be substituted
for any other, without the least inharmony of fit.
The four small machines alluded to were all
made by Beale and Co. themselves, the desiderata
sought being light running and high speed, both
of which purposes have been successfully achieved.
• • •
Stopped to admire some very convoluted
fretwork—it was an ornamental front panel of an
organ—the manager remarked to the writer: “I
suppose you’d fancy that this was only one piece ?”
“ So it is ; isn’t it ? ”
“No, sir. Although this is so thin, it is 3-ply.’’
The explanation that followed revealed the fact
that, in the thin but tough panel under notice
there were actually three plates of timber. The
grain of the two outside plates ran vertically ; the
middle plate, or inserted timber, was so placed
that its grain ran horizontally. The three plates
had been so manipulated in a glueing press as to
have virtually amalgamated into one panel not
more than one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The
reason for crossing the grains of the plates is that
this arrangement makes it impossible for the wood
to split. Although so thin, the fiercest attempts
to split it (as one easily can a single thin plate of
any sort of wood) fail. As Mr. Stutchbury re-
marked : “This makes it as tough as a bit of
leather.’’ The thinness of such a panel is pre-
served, because it gives a richer and better sound
to the instrument for which it is destined.
Numerous samples of admirable fretwork may
be seen in various departments, undergoing the
successive processes necessary before their final
issue. All the fine panels are “ 3-ply ” work, and,
by way of illustration, some apparently fragile
pieces were thrown about and suojected to various
abuses by knee and foot, but sustained no damage
whatever.
• * *
Returning downstairs to “the mill,” the
big “variety moulder” is seen at work upon
sewing-machine “ tables,” turning out pattern
after pattern of the same size, same shape, and the
same ornamentation. Sometimes a series of
square-sided patterns ; anon a succession of tables
with fancifully curved edges; whatever shape
is fancied, that shape, no matter how erratic the
design, is carved out by the faithful machine, so
that no sawing at all is necessary. So rapid is its
execution that one is not surprised to learn that
the head which contains the cutters revolves at
the tremendous speed of 5000 revolutions a minute.
It is started by a kick of the foot displacing a
lever, and is stopped by kicking the lever back
into its place. It is thoroughly under control,
and to those not in the secret of the foot-lever
there is something weird and almost magical in
its starting and stoppages “at the word of com-
mand.” It will run its two cutters all day long at
the rate of 5000 revolutions a minute, and yet the
bearings will not get heated. “ These,” said the
manager, “are better results than I have ever
seen with any imported tool of its kind.”
• « *
Wandering around, a resinous and balsamic
odour acquaints one that he is in the polishing-
room. Beale and Co. manufacture their own
polish.
Here we see “cabinets ’’awaiting the attentions
of the polishers ; also the scattered parts of organ-
work, which are all polished seriatim in this
department.
The bulk store contains the rough ironwork,
which is sent from there to the fitters’ depart-
ment. The rough iron castings are imported. In
the fitters’ room they are drilled with holes as
required, fitted, &c. The fitters attend to all the
boxes and templates (a kind of gauges), so that
every sample part shall be interchangeable with
every other similar sample part, whether made
to-day, or six months’ hence. The drilling
machines are light enough to be worked by ,a
youth, but are very strong.
After being drilled and bored, the iron castings
are taken into an adjoining room to be japanned.
This process is simplicity itself. There is no
brush-work. There is simply a deep bath of
liquid japan, and each casting is dipped and hung
up on an 3-hook to drain. The japan is thus dis-
tributed evenly over every part of the surface, and
blobs are avoided. Beale and Co. make their own
japan in another compartment of the premises.
They import their asphaltum direct from Trini-
dad. This is broken up and placed in a boiler,
which is then filled up with gasoline—a highly
inflammable article, dangerous to use in the
proximity of flame. Here, once more, come in
the invaluable services of the “waste steam.”
By turning on a tap, the pipe passing beneath the
boiler becomes charged with hot steam, the
asphaltum and gasoline are boiled together with-
out the presence of any flame, and the syrupy-
looking japanning fluid is “tried off” underneath.
After the japanning, comes the gilding of the
ornamental designs of each casting, and the letter-
ing giving the name of the firm.
There is a curious burnishing-machine for
burnishing the nickel parts. But, first of all, it
would be as well to mention that the nickeling is
accomplished in an isolated shed away from the
main-building. This shed contains a small
dynamo, and all the batteries, baths, and acids
necessary to the carrying out of nickeling opera-
tions. The burnishing-machine is of Beale and
Co.’s own make. There is a horizontal shaft sus-
pended by an upright in its centre from another
shaft, like (say) an ordinary gas-pipe with two
burners equidistant from the rod that suspends
them from the ceiling. At one end of this hori-
zontal shaft is a felt-wheel; at the other is a loose
pad consisting of circular discs of common calico
fastened together like those rag pen-wipers that
used to be made up of circles of rag sewn together
through the centre. This calico arrangement is
quite loose, and any number of its “ leaves ” may
be folded back and separated from the rest by the
fingers—so long as the machine is at rest, lb is,
in fact, as limp as the sort of pen-wiper already
described, of which it is a facsimile, only that it
stands like a wheel on the end of a horizontal rod.
But when that rod is revolving—2ooo turns a minute
here also—the centrifugal motion causes the loose
circles of calico to strain together and afford a
compact resistance to any surface presented to
their attention. The felt-wheel is for the first,
and the calico-leaved wheel for the finer and more
subtle, burnishing.
Emery-wheels are visible, too, in a dozen dif-
ferent degrees of coarseness, from the spark-
emitting rough emery to the finest one capable of
doing the most delicate work. These are neces-
sary for grinding down different parts of the iron-
work, which has to be fashioned with as much
exactitude as the woodwork, so that any one
sample shall be interchangeable with any other
similar sample. Once a week all these wheels are
cleaned and re-emeried. This is part of every
Saturday’s work, and Monday sees a fair “tart
with a full supply of olean emery-wheels.
• • •
The fitters’ room contains a lathe that
should be very hard to be excelled. It executes
with equal facility and precision—slotting, mill-
ing, screw-outting, and, in fact, any turning
work.
Here, in apparently profuse confusion, lie num-
berless parts of the ironwork of sewing-machinery
ready for any orders as to new fragments, or as to
exchange for old fragments. These castings are,
of course, not done on the premises, but are made
to order, from the firm’s own designs. So that,
should any one of Beale and Co.’s clients require*
any particular part of the ironwork of a sewing-
machine, they can be accommodated on the spot,

Rn The U same observation applies to all the finer
steel parts (imported) of the machine-heads-
handle checkspring, tuokmaker, cogs, check-
levers ’ cams, shuttle, needle-bar, presser-bar,
carrier slide &c. Seeing that there are over 120
different “ parts ” to a sewing-machine, and that
an injury to one or two may throw the whole ap-
oaratus out of gear, the advantage conferred on
Beale and Co.’s customers, in being able to send
for one needed part only, is seen to be very great
indeed As every part is of exactly the same pat-
tern as its fellow, all are equally interchangeable,
But these remarks really belong to the sampling-
room
In this department are stored the importations.
Beale and Co. import only the ‘‘heads ” of their
sewing-machines. These “ heads ’are manufao-
tured by Seidel and Naumann, of Dresden (Let-
many), after a design patented by Beale and Co.
The “ heads ” arrive in various pieces, and these
have to be separately examined, cleaned, and
sampled. .
“ Since you do so much purely Australian work,
would it not be possible to manufacture the
‘ heads ’ of those machines here.
“ Of course, it would be_ possible, said the
manager; “ but it is impracticable, io lay down
a set of plant to make that one machine, and all
the appliances attached to it, would cost £100,005.
Then, when you had got the machinery, in order
to make it remunerative you would have to turn
out so many machines that Australia could not
consume them.
* * *
The cabinets vary in design and orna-
mentation, which variations are only possible by
doing locally all the work that it is possible to do
in the country. Some cabinets have a flap which
gives an extension of table-surface; the door being
opened supports the flap ; when the door is closed,
the flap falls down, and the machine can be be-
stowed within a smaller space. .
Another ingenious application to the flaps is
found in the quarter-cabinet family machines,
which do not possess doors, but are open always,
front and back. This is known as the “table-
catch,” and is a japanned iron catch adjusted
underneath the flap, and also attached to the
under-part of the table’s border, to which the flap
itself is hinged. You raise the flap and the
“table-catch” automatically falls into holding
position, and the flap remains up. You rap the
catch gentlv and the flap falls. The idea is
simplicity itself
-The locking ’of the drawer in these quarter-
cabinets also locks on the cover, the one turning
of the key moving two catches. To take off the
cover, the drawer must be first unlocked. In
another class of machines, the full cabinets with
doors, the putting on of the cover locks the doors.
These are very handy machines, and are fitted
with inside pockets in which may be placed
”“ dle W ° rk “ d “ Wi " g
Then there are cabinets without flaps and whose
doors can be opened so as to turn right back
against the sides of the machine.
The panellings of these cabinets are of varied,
handsome designs, all worked out with marvellous
celerity by the wonderful “ variety moulder,” and
all of Australian wood. Some magnificent speci-
mens of inlaid cabinets are specially attractive,
and would make handsome pieces of furniture in
any drawing-room; nor, probably, would th e
nature of the article be suspected by the visitor, so
long as the doors remained closed, and the cover
remained on. Customers, however, generally
prefer the solid wood, picturesquely panelled, and
Beale and Co. only execute a moderate amount of
inlaying.
The ironwork consists of light castings, which,
by reason of their patterned shapes—designed by
the firm—are unusually strong. It is an expert
opinion that they cannot be beaten by any other
style yet invented.
In the sampling-room, every part of each
machine is finally put together, and forwarded to
the issuing-room, in a finished state of perfection.
It is not necessary to follow from this room any
machine to its destined home.

A visit to Beale and Co.’s Annandale
factory is industrially educative, and gives an Aus-
tralian cause for satisfaction in respect that at
least one eminent firm is not blind to those native
resources that belong to its own line of business.
The site of the handsome, six-storeyed establish-
ment at 484 George-street was purchased by Mr.
Beale eight years ago when it was a veritable mud-
hole. Now it is a palatial edifice, with an interior
that does great credit to the art of interior archi-
tectural decoration, as well as to the solidity of
utilitarian building. A novel feature in its con-
struction is the use of zinc ceilings, which, besides
being capable of picturesque intricacies of orna-
mentation, are remarkably durable. A zinc ceil-
ing never cracks, changes, nor alters, and cannot
fall. They are more expensive than the usual
ceilings to be found in business houses, but they
are absolutely permanent and they are certainly
very handsome.
Every office —at a rough outside guess, there
are some 60 or 70 offices—in this noble pile is
tenanted. Art studios, doctors, engineers, den-
tists, musical artists, and all manner of profes-
sional and commercial tenants occupy the accom-
modation on the various floors. In the basement,
as already stated, are a restaurant and a billiard-
room (with four tables) leased to the popular host
of Tattersall’s, George Adams. While mention-
ing the billiard-room, it may be pointed out that
its four tables (Alcock’s) are testimonies of the
valuable nature of Australian woods. No one
would ever dream of importing foreign timber in
the endeavour to compete with this class of work.
Beale and Co. employ several hundreds of hands;
considering their numerous country branches, it is
impossible to estimate offhand the total number
they employ.
Besides organs and sewing-machines, Beale and
Co. largely import pianos. Australia has not yet
got over its prejudice in favour of foreign-made
pianos, but the day will come assuredly when
piano-manufacturing will also be a safe and
remunerative Australian industry.
Beale and Co. endeavour to place their goods
within reach of all classes of customers, and there-
fore sell on easy terms.
PROPOSED LIMITED LIABILITY CO.
A company, to be called Beale and Co., Limited,
is now being formed to take over, as a going
concern, the manufacturing, importing and dis-
tributing business so successfully carried on by
Mr. Beale for more than 14 years ; and to acquire
the title and interest of the old firm in the free-
hold lands and buildings at 482 and 484 George-
street, Sydney, and the Annandale factory and
stores. The company will take over these at cost,
the freehold having been bought at a low price
many years ago. A freehold brick store and
stabies, at Myrtle-street, Sydney, will also be
transferred to the company.
Beale and 00. do not ask for any cash payment
to themselves, but are perfectly well satisfied to
take the value of their present interest in paid-up
shares. The idea is that the flotation into a
company will act co-operatively towards extend-
ing the business throughout Australia. The
capital is placed at .£150,000 in 150,000 shares to
be fully paid up to £l, with no further liability.

managing director ; John See, M.P. (Col. Trea-
surer), vice-chairman ; T. M. Slattery, M.P.

William Yero Read, W. H. Readett, and Robert
Amos. Bankers ; Bank of N.S.W. and Bank of
New Zealand. Solicitor : Thos. Read.
The average profits of the business, taken over
a series of years, are equal to the provision of a
reserve fund. Dividends, by the articles of
association, are payable half-yearly.
Beale and Co., Limited, will be in alliance with
the great firm of Seidel and Nauraann, Dresden
(Germany), an establishment that employs 1500
men and produces 80,000 sewing-machines and
8000 bicycles annually.
Nothing is charged for goodwill, and the com-
pany will start without loading of any kind. All
trade names and letters of registration owned by
the firm will become the absolute property of the
company, as applied to goods indicated by these
” Further particulars respecting this alluring co-
operative project may be gleaned from the pros-
pectus of *" Beale and Go., Limited,” which appears
in our business columns.

The scheme is one that may be warmly com-
mended to the hearty sympathies and business
instincts of all classes. Not only are its remuner-
ative returns already assured, bub it has golden
prospects that promise to distribute benefits alike
to shareholders, to consumers, and to native
industry. When most, if not all, other firms are
languidly importing foreign timbers, Beale and
Co Limited, are determined o develop Aus-
trahan resources, thus providing employment
to Australian bushmen, shippers, and me-
chanics, and demonstrating to ourselves and
to the_ outside world that native wealth
is here in abundance, and that the search for it
will magnificently reward the earnest and persis-
tent seeker. By thus intelligently developing
Australia’s hidden treasures, waste is converted
into wealth, wealth into currency, and the dis-
tribution of all the outflow is among our own
people and not diverted, with numerous unavoid-
able contingent expenses, to absentees, who sap
this country of its natural vigour, Beale and Co.
Limited is, at one and the same time, a reliable
and remunerative business, and a patriotic move-
ment in a most commendable direction.
The promotion of Coroner Ghoul’s orderly,
Constable Davidson, has raised a row amongst the
500 or so senior men thus passed over. It was a

There’s a morgue-keeper’s advantage. He is an
overflowing fountain of information, and practi-
cally hypnotises the news-scavengers if he is
decent." Davidson is famous for his cheerful
method of dealing with corpses, and taking their
photos. He deserves his “ sthripe.”

My little girl has dimpled cheeks
Whose healthful colour comes and goes ;
The teeth she flashes when she speaks
Are whiter than the winter snows.
Love’s light is gleaming in her eyes,
Her shoulders make a choice display ;
But far beyond those charms I prize
That “ fringe as worn by Princess May.”
I bought it as a glad surprise
For Angela, the other day.
Her slender waist she doesn’t pinch ;
It measures twenty by the tape—
She might reduce another inch
And still look natural in shape.
Her nose, a sculptor would allow,
Is fashioned in a classic way :
And, O ! you ought to see her now
In “ fringe as worn by Princess May.”
I placed it first upon her brow
(Was half-a-guinea much to pay ?)
Sweet Angela ! she is my bride,
My wife for better or for worse ;
This moment sitting by my side
Delighted with this clever verse.
And when swift years have flitted by,
And Time has left his streaks of grey—
Old Time who spares not royalty—
I’ll stroke her silken hair, and say
(Provided neither of them dye)
“ The same as worn by Princess May.”

Briggs, of Ballast Quarries.
[FOR THE BULLRTIN.]
They’d built a school at Quarry Camp, had the
blessed Government,
And, you bet your boots, a proper sort was the
teacher man they sent !
He'could talk like twenty navvies, he could drink
like twenty more,
HebOOld do his cheque up quicker than was ever
done before;
He would play it up at poker, or at euchre, or fan-
tan—
Oh, yes, Briggs, of Ballast Quarries, was a proper
kind of man },
When the famous tug-of-war with Brown’s at
Quarry Camp was made,
And the Jackson party triumphed—with the
donkey-engine's aid —
It was Briggs, of Ballast Quarries School, who cap-
tained JaSkaon’s, and
He had to fight no less than nine of Brown’s
defeated band :
There was nothing less would do them than that
Brings should fight the mob,
And for seven Sundays running Briggs was fairly
on the job.
But when he’d belted nine of ’em in Bill, the
blacksmith’s, shop,
The rest made up their minds that they’d just let
' the matter drop.
There was never such a hungry man for fight since
fights began;
He was pointed out to visitors as “Briggs, the
fighting man — ”
There was never such a terror to go on a raging
tear,
And he’d blast the vegetation when he really tried
to swear;
And he’d say, with verbal trimmings—he was
never at a loss—
That he wasn’t even frightened of his sanguinary
boss !
They were kicking up a shindy once —a sort of
hell’s delight—
Down at Doolan’s, and it promised to be kept up
all the night,
And the chap in number seven—he was School
Inspector Crow —
Couldn’t sleep a half-a-minute for the noisy crowd
below,
But he knew the drunkest of them all—the tightest
of the tight—
The man with gory features, who had just pulled
. off a fight,
Was a teacher in his district; so he sent him down
a note -
In the hope to stop his acting of the silly, giddy
goat;
But it didn’t frighten Briggsy, and he didn’t stop
his song,
And he never checked the fellow who was thump-
ing on the gong;
Never stayed the half a fraction of the most un-
holy din,
And he answered to the landlord, when he brought
the message in,
“ What the devil is your name, sir, do you know,
- man, who I am ?
Tell him ‘ Briggs, of Ballast Quarries, and he
doesn’t care a damn ! ’ ”
But the work at last was finished, and the camp it
didn’t stay,
And Briggs’s school was shifted, and himself was
sent away;
And I never came across him, for about a year or
so,
Till I met him out at Boggy Creek, a week or two
ago.
But I found him sadly altered, to my great and
lasting grief,
For the change in Briggs was awful —it was
almost past belief!
He was settled in a little German township—
Doragee—
Where the people are as pious and as sleepy as
can be;
Where they never have no functions, and where
no one can get tight,
For there ain’t a pub. about there, and you never
see a fight,
And you wouldn’t find a pack of cards, no matter
how you’d search,
And the folks object to dancing, and go twice-a-
day to church;
But the darkest, saddest feature of the melancholy
case
Was that Briggs of Ballast Quarries seemed to
like the blessed place !
He was dressed up like a masher, and he wore a
watch and ring
(At the camp he used to fasten up his moleskins
with a string).
And his boots were highly polished, and his mo.
was nicely curled,
I believe a bigger swell than Briggs there isn’t in
the world !
And he didn’t seem to want me, and he didn’t
even show
E’er a particle of interest in the coves he used to
know;
And it didn’t seem quite proper, nor harmonise
at all
With the joyous ancient style of Briggs before his
dismal fall,
That he’d take it all so easy—might as well be
underground
As be living where there ain’t a pub, for twenty
miles around;
Where the folks get up at dawn of day, at sun-
down to retire,
And be going to tea-meetings, and be leading in
the choir,
And be looking sadly pious where the church folks
congregate,
And — Briggs, from Ballast Quarries, to be hand-
ing round the plate!
But they tell me down at Sandy, where they seem
to know it all,
That it ain’t at all a trouble to account for Briggs’
fall;
That he used to be as gladsome and unsober as of
old,
And the navvy songs he warbled, and the navvy
yarns he told,
And his boots were always busted, and his morals
were the same,
And his cheque was always mortgaged twenty
days before it came.
But he tore his ancient habits up completely by
the roots
When he drifted into goodness and to wearing
shiny boots.
And the reason why he’s altered all his former
sinful ways,
And his style of talk no longer sets the atmosphere
ablaze,
And his Quarry Camp acquaintances he doesn’t
recognise,
And he’s going in for study, and promotion, and
a rise,
And he wears a stand-up collar, and a whisker
with a curl,
And is sad and straight and steady, is —that
Briggs has got a girl I
A. CHEE.
At a Street Corner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.0
The footsteps of the crowd were in his ears, the
voices of it, its sighing and its laughter. His
fingers lay motionless across the raised letters of
the great book on his knees, and his eyes were
strained forward but they saw nothing save his
own misery. It was the only thing in the
heavens above and the earth beneath that he had
ever seen. They thought he was asleep, the tram-
waiting crowd around, for his head had fallen a
little forward on to the placard he wore upon his
breast, and his lips were quiet.
And the crowd went home, little by little, till
the corner was nearly deserted, but he did not
move. Then there came a slow, shuffling step
along the foot-path, the step of the old, old man
who sold papers daily at the same corner. And
the money-box, near the great book, was sud-
denly grasped by a thin, old hand and the
shuffling steps went away rapidly and died
in the distance. But the boy sat motionless.
Almost a smile parted his lips. “No one
ever stole from me before,” he whispered to
himself, and lifted his head a little, as if the act
had placed him for once on an equality with a
world that always pitied. He smiled faintly
again. There must be someone in the city as
miserable as himself if they had come to such
a pass as to steal from him.
But the next day this mood had passed away,
and nothing but bitterness was in his heart.
And when the slow, shuffling step came past
him again, and he thought of the comfort the
stolen money would have brought him, a very
demon came into him.
He stood upright in his place, and laid the
money-box and the great book down on the
ground, and took two quick steps in the direction of
the slow, shuffling ones, felt for the figure that
carried newspapers, and knocked it heavily down
across the pavement.
The nerves of the crowd were immeasurably
shocked. The great book lay in the dust ; the old
man was slowly raising himself, in injured sur-
prise, and there was the blind, young, passionate
face before them or they would have thought their
eyes had played them false.
There was a man of the church amongst them
and he went forward and laid a quiet hand on the
boy’s sleeve. But the young face was still ablaze
and the poor, wild eyes straining forward.
“ Let me go!” he said, trying to free himself.
But the hand still held bis sleeve and the colour
dropped from his face again.
“I am blind,” he said, as if the calamity had
just come upon him.
They led him back to his seat and placed him
upon it gently, and laid the book on his knees
again.
“ Read,” the man of the church said softly, and
the boy opened the great Book and laid his quiver-
ing fingers on the first page.
“ And God said, let there be Light,” he read.
Then his voice vibrated. “ And God said, let
there be Light, ” he fepeated.
But no one even expected him to finish the
sentence.
ETHEL S. TURNER.
Red Gravel.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On the graded side of a hill in West
Maoriland grew six acres of currant-bush
clumped as densely as bamboos, and consisting of
slight saplings, averaging about 20ft. in height. A
lad who, from the top of the hill, was venture-
some enough to climb as far as ho could to any
chosen swaying tops-any two afforded ample
support—might enjoy a slide down the grade of
bending tops for IQOyds. or so. Nearing the end
of his journey he would select his sapling and be
gently swung down to the ground. It was
exliilarating and dangerous ; therefore, it was the
chief delight of the boys in that vicinity to climb
in a squad to the top of the hill, and then—a
glorious aerial trip, the course of the trapezists
being visible only as are the tracks of the wind in
standing corn. One evening a merry troop
entered the clump and screamed joyously adown
the trapeze. Some emerged before others. The
troop went home. Save one. He was missing
and had entered. That was all that was known.
Diligent search revealed nothing. Gradually the
incident faded out of the memories of all except
one—the lost one’s mother.
* « *
Three years afterwards, and a youth,
alone, entered on this strange trapeze. He passed
through the whole distance, was swayed down
and just about to let go, when he looked down-
wards. Horror ! In the dim spaces between the
ferns he saw all around him—red gravel ! Cling-
ing desperately, he regained his position, crept
back to the roadside, and went home, quivering in
every limb at his narrow escape. For that red
gravel had only one meaning—a deserted shaft!
And he had been in suspension plumb above it.
* * »
Two more years had elapsed, when a slip
on the hill-side, beginning at the shaft, which had
been 40ft. deep and half-full of water, laid bare
the bones of our lost schoolmate. Thus strangely
had the first boy lowered himself into eternity.
