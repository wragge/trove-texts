Holiday Reading
You are going away for, say, a fort-
night to some place where there is no
library, and where you will get a chance,
between fishing, playing golf or bridge,
or whatever it may be, to read a couple
of books a The problem is to
find four modern works which don’t call
for undue concentration, yet are likely
to appeal to any reader of imagination
and intelligence. The writer’s first choice
in the circumstances would be Robert
Desmond Tate’s The Doughman (En-
deavour Press ; 65.), which has already
been reviewed on this Page., An under-
world masterpiece, blothing to approach
it, in its macabre class, has been done
in Australia since Louis Stone wrote
“Jonah.” The other three should be
more exhilarating. If there is a humor-
ous novel available it will pick itself, and
the list might be completed with studies
of social groups, modern and not-so-
modern.
Feudal Ireland
One of the few genuine humorists now
writing in English is M. .1. Farrell, author
of Conversation Piece (Collins ; 7s. 6d.k
The arty title and dust-jacket are decep-
tive ; it is a plain tale from the stables,
after the manner of Miss Somerville and
the man who wrote so amusingly about
his experiences as an Irish magistrate. The
required note of objectivity is provided
by the narrator, a sporting Englishman.
He finds his Irish relations —Sir Richard
Pulleyn and Sir Richard’s boy and girl,
Richard and Willow —and their retainers
living as county families did in England
centuries ago. Their manners are charm-
ing, but they never read a book, and
they think and talk of nothing but horses
and hunting, shooting and fishing, racing
and ramps.
Those who write about lovable primi-
tives are always in danger of spoiling the
picture by laying the comic stuff on
too thickly ; the defect is to be seen in
many of our outback stories. Miss Farrell
avoids gaffes of thp kind, though she has
one character —James the butler—who is
as farcical as any Wodehouse creation.
Old James is plausible, even in his most
preposterous moments, because he and
the people he serves are all medievalists
together. This old retainer’s sudden tran-
sitions from profound respect to easy
familiarity were features of English social
life till well on in the nineteenth century
(there are many resemblances between the
relations of James and Sir Richard and
those of Sam and Pickwick), but in most
respects James and his stately master
and the children are Renaissance figures.
They have an ancient dignity which for-
bids them to joke, or even to talk much ;
and though their behavior seems wildly
absurd to the visiting Sassenach, and to
the reader, they never dream of laughing
themselves. As well expect guffaws in
Avalon as in Pullinstown. Humor apart,
Conversation Piece will delight all who
love and understand horses and hunting.
On the sporting side it is a book for
experts by an expert.
Last of the Forsytes
John Galsworthy’s Over the River
(Heinemann ; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.) bring?
the story of the Forsytes up to date, and
it exhibits again this writer’s astonishing
capacity for moving with the times, fac-
ing the facts of epochs which were dis-
tasteful to him. Dickers couldn’t bear
to do it; he kept going back mentally to
a more congenial era than his "own. In
Over the River, Sir Lawrence Mont and
his Em, Fleur, Dinny Cherrell (still sor-
rowing for Wilfred but softening towards
an estimable barrister, Eustace Dornford
by name) and a few others remain on
deck, but the central figure is Dinny’s
younger sister Clare, who, after being
married to Sir Gerald Corven for 17
months, has left him in abhorrence. Clare
is a modern girl in every detail, and that
Galsworthy, at sixty-odd, should have
been able to get inside her skin so com-
pletely argues that he must have had at
least a spark of that genius which so
many eminent
critics are now
denying him. The
action moves fate-
fully towards the
divorce-s ui t in
which Sir Gerald
triumphs, the Forsytes are dragged
through the mud, and Clare is thrown
back on Tony, the innocent co-re-
spondent.
Tony is a remarkably attractive lad—
the essence of British decency—but his
virtues don’t stand out to any extent
because the other characters are also
decent according to their lights. Even Sir
Gerald, who is the nearest thing to a
villain that tolerant, understanding old
Galsworthy has had the heart to draw, is
likeable despite the mysterious and pre-
sumably psychopathic aberration which
turned his wife against him. The reader
cherishes a hope, almost to the last, that
Clare will overlook the undisclosed lapse
of this, in other respects, admirable pro-
duct of the English public-school sys-
tem, and return with him to Ceylon. As
it is, the concluding chapters, whiqh reveal
Clare living at week-ends with a man she
only half loves and Dinny married to a
man she is never likely to love, are
somewhat flat. But mapy of the episodes
are supremely well done —the scenes at
the Law Courts, for example, with their
brilliant little sketches of the counsel
and, above all, of the Judge—and the talk
is as witty as talk in Mayfair would be if
the inhabitants had Galsworthy’s brains,
and plenty of time to think out and
polish up their impromptus.
The Crimea Again
It is easy to be satirical at the expense
of Trumpeter, Sound!, by D. L. Murray
(Hodder and Stoughton; Dymock’s;
7s. 6d.). The leading characters —Mark,
the illegitimate hero ; his aristocratic and
infamous half-brother; the betrayed
heroine —are familiar to students of nine-
teenth-century melodramas. The eccen-
trics—such as old Oliver Fawkes, of the
Juvenile Drama, Print and Tinsel Ware-
house, and Mark’s employer, Mr. Hepple-
white, the humanitarian pacifist who loves
hunting and fighting—are old friends, too.
Yet this is a fine and true novel on the
whole. It describes the life of a trooper
in a crack cavalry regiment three-quarters
of a century ago. Rankers have a thin
time in England to this day ; Kipling’s
“Kick him out, the brute! ” would still be
recommended by many Britons in the
case of a Tommy who ventured into re-
sorts frequented by his betters. During
most of Queen Victoria’s reign private
soldiers were treated like dogs. This
book goes into hideous details concern-
ing their rations and quarters and the
brutalities perpetrated on them. Some-
how the system produced results. Those
who survived it became incapable of
disobedience. There is a wonderful
account of the Balaclava charge; the
enemy punching great holes in the ad-
vancing squadron, which closes in as the
men and horses fall, so that “it had the
look; of a concertina opening and clos-
ing” ; Lord Cardigan galloping steadily
at the regulation parade distance in the
lead, only moving in the saddle to shoot
out his arm and lay the flat of his sword
against the breast of some pressing
officer ; the shouted orders:
Give heed to your dressing.... Close in
to your centre! A leader for Number One
Squadron, Mr. Strangways, sir! Will you look
to your dressing, men!
The World War caused thousands f o
take an interest in the histories and tradi-
tions of the units they served with, and
novels like Trumpeter, Sound ! and “Gen-
tlemen, the Regiment!”, which was re-
viewed on this Page some weeks ago, are
among the results. The writers know all
about soldiering, and they are s.teeped in
the atmosphere of the periods that have
attracted them. Trumpeter, Sound! gives
a much clearer idea of what barrack life
in England and warfare overseas must
have been like in the middle of last cen-
tury than any mid-Victorian novel that
the writer can call to mind.
RED PAGE.
Propagandist Writers
“The literary reformers of to-day”
says Red Page (6/12/’33), “are as dis-
tressed as Dickens was by the sorrows
of the poor, but they have no construc-
tive remedies to offer.”
It is not the business of the writer to
provide remedies. His sole function is

to state problems. When he. has stated
them correctly his function ceases.
In “King Lear,” Shakspeare stated a
highly complicated domestic problem.
An old man, bemused by sentiment,
hands his power over to two unworthy
daughters and betrays the worthy one.
For the rest of the play he is a caged
tiger battering himself to pieces against
bars of his own creation and destroying
everybody in the vicinity. The play ends
in abysmal tragedy, but nowhere in it is
there the slightest mention of a solution.
So, on the Red Page reviewer’s showing,
Shakspeare was either a coward or an
ignoramus.
Red Page complains that J. B. Priest-
ley presents “riddles without answers”
and then contradicts himself by pointing
out that Priestley offers an answer.
True, it is only to be found in a remark
of one of the characters. Assume, how-
ever, for the sake of argument, that
Priestley meant to present his own solu-
tion to the problem of poverty amidst
plenty when he made a character say,
“If I’d my way I’d give every unem-
ployed man four pounds a week to-
morrow.” He was then doing what the
reviewer thinks he ought to have done.
But the reviewer immediately objects and
asks where the money is to come from.
He doesn’t know, I don’t know, and
neither does Priestley.
An economist might be able to say,
and that is where the literary artist can
be truly constructive —by confining him-
self to his function. By marshalling the
evidences of human folly and contra-
dictions, of the inconsistency between
public professions and private behavior,
of biological realities confuting popular
prejudices, of archaic conventions stifling
effort, the writer-expert constructs a pic-
ture which has lessons for all the other
experts.
The writer-expert says, “This is what
you are really like. What are you going
to do about it?”
He propounds riddles to which the
community fails to find answers at its
peril.
M. G. S.
Half-hearted idealists like Priestley don’t say
“This is what you are really like”; they say,
“You may be like this—or that.” The great
British writers of the past were different.
“Lear” is oddly beside the point. It is the
classic study in insanity. Shakspeare wasn’t so
lacking in humor and taste as to try to draw
morals from the misfortunes of a lunatic. In
other plays, however, Shakspeare was a strenu-
ous propagandist. His propaganda on behalf
of national patriotism, which, like that of
Plato, is made use of in England during great
wars to this day, was as inspiring to a nation
that had recently thrown off the internationalist
sway of the Vatican as “Recessional” was
to the Imperialists of 30 years ago. He also
propaganded in the interests of upper-class
authoritarianism (no modern Tory despised
democracy more heartily), against women’s
rights (he didn’t believe in the principle laid
down by McCardie in the Malcolm case that
“woman has property in her own body”) and in
many other directions. And he never left a
shadow of a doubt as to which side he was on.
It is impossible to tell from Mr. Priestley’s
latest book whether Bolshevism or Capitalism,
nationalism or internationalism, is his remedy
for England’s discontents. He examines several
conflicting remedies and then backs out. Pos-
sibly he thinks, with “M.G.S.,” that an artist’s
“sole function is to state problems” and avoid
propaganda, but few will agree. To exclude
the propagandists from English literature—
those who, unlike Mr. Priestley, knew just what
religious, social or political ideas they were in
favor of, and who had the courage to support
them —would be equivalent to excluding all the
representational landscapes and portraits from
the London National Gallery or the Louvre.
It might please a few arty cranks, but humanitv
at large would be appalled.
Milton, the truest poet, and Swift, perhaps
the greatest prose-writer in the language, de-
voted most of their artistic lives to moral and
social propaganda. We still turn to “Areo-
pagitica” for arguments against censors, and
to “Drapier’s Letters” for pictures of Irish
trade conditions in the seventeenth century.
Dickens propaganded against hundreds of
abuses; the employment of child chimney-
sweeps, for example. He didn’t say through
his characters, or otherwise, “This may be
wrong—but it may be right.” He damned
the business unequivocally, and so helped to
have it made illegal.
Nothing impresses Continental critics so
much as the propagandist tendencies of the
best British writers. Taine said of Swift and
Addison: —
They only dream of reforming or chastising vice.
They are moralists They both confine themselves
to the consideration of vice and virtue.... Their
successors do likewise.
And Cazamian wrote of Galsworthy the other
day: —
He unveils sores, and points out remedies.
Cazamian considers this trait “a token of the
high worth of Galsworthy’s art,” and he would
probably cling to the view even if he heard
that “M.G.S.” considers “it is not the business
of the writer to provide remedies.”

Lloyd George on the War
Lloyd George’s War Memoirs (Nichol-
son and Watson ; £1 Is.) are authorita-
tive or nothing. No man now living saw
more of the inner political side of the
war. The author attended the Cabinet
meeting which involved Britain. He
dominated the conferences which planned
war finances. He forced the munitions
issue ; he helped to plan the Peace.
Nothing in his account of the war it-
self, however, transcends in interest what
he has to say of the war’s origins and
of the conditions of unreadiness which
prevailed in England on August 4, 1914.
No one (even in Europe) foresaw what
was coming.
The Kaiser departed for his usual yachting
holiday to the Norwegian fiords. His Chief
Minister left for his usual shooting party on
his estate in Silesia. The acting head of the
German Foreign Office went off on a honey-
moon trip. A still more reassuring fact —the
military head of the German Army, Von
Moltke, left for his cure in a foreign spa.
The French President went on a cere-
monial visit to Russia —he arrived back
only on July 29. As for England, war
was not mentioned at a Cabinet meeting
until the Friday before Germany’s
declaration.
One can now see clearly that no European
statesman wanted war. The possible exception
was the foolish Berchtold, the Austrian Pre-
mier, upon whom must be fixed the chief per-
sonal responsibility for most of what happened.
War was the “last thing the vainglorious
Kaiser wanted.”
The author thinks that Europe was
exceptionally unfortunate in its counsel-
lors in the emergency—“they were all
handy men in a well-behaved sea, but
helpless in a typhoon.” Even when the
German military plan had been evolved
the Kaiser baulked at it. He intervened
with Von Moltke to prevent the march
across Belgium and war with England,
and with the Czar to cancel his mobilisa-
tion order and avert the struggle on the
Eastern frontier, only to be told in both
cases that he was too late.
What the muddle began, the mutual
confidence of the French and Germans
in their own power to win and the sud-
den war fever of populaces and the hesi-
tancies of Sir Edward Grey—“a pilot
whose hand trembled in a palsy of appre-
hension, unable to grip the levers and
manipulate them with a firm and clear
purpose”—finished.
Grey’s mind, says Lloyd George, was
not made for prompt action. If he had
issued a clear statement to Europe of
what the consequences would be of Ger-
many’s invading Belgium and had regi-
mented his colleagues behind him on that
question, he could have stemmed the
tide. As it was, his impartial but weak
and uncompelling appeals to the raging
nations of Europe had no effect.
He missed his opportunities... .lacked the
knowledge of foreign countries and the vision,
imagination, breadth of mind and that high
courage, bordering on audacity, which his
immense task demanded.
Next point of interest to the story ot
the days before August 4, 1914, is that
of the fight for munitions against
an Ordnance Department which, backed
by Lord Kitchener, showed an almost
unbelievable pigheadedness. While the
German Army had an abundance of
heavy, mobile guns firing high-explosive,
“the mental arsenals of the British Army
had no room for anything but shrapnel.”
Britain possessed no heavy gun bigger
than a 60-pounder with the exception of
one lone 9.2 howitzer. The 4.7 was con-
sidered almost too cumbrous a weapon
for the field! The siege-train guns were
still muzzle-loaders. Six-inch howitzers
even in January, 1915, numbered only
24—one battery per corps, against 16
per corps owned by the German Army
in the field. The B.E.F. had two machine-
guns per battalion against the German
16. H.E. shells were still filled at Wool-
wich by hand with ladles.
The first year of the war was filled
with the urgent crying of French for
shells ♦'and with the Ordnance Depart-
ment’s strident excuses for not supplying
him. In May, 1915, the British Army,
blasted at every turn by a withering
deluge of fire from the heavy German
batteries, could fire only 4.3 rounds of
4.7 ammunition per day, 6.1 rounds per
gun of 4.5 ammunition. It had 11
rounds per gun for the 18-pounders, and
more than once French was compelled
to abandon offensive operations because
he could not effect adequate artillery
preparation.
The rest of the tale is more heartening.
The swing from muddle and inefficiency
to comparative efficiency, the gradual
organisation of an immense army and
the arming of it, the resolution of the
political troubles of the Cabinet and the
analysis of the mistakes of the Allies
make an absorbing, if at times disjointed
and egotistical, history. The book is one
which naturally will claim a place among
the dozen front-rank volumes of war
reminiscences which exist; but it lacks
the literary greatness of some of the
others. L.G. may have the “tongue of
a Welsh angel” but he certainly has not
Winston Churchill’s gift of the pen.
M. E.
Heart of a V.C.
When the news came that Hugo
Throssell had ended the life that war
broke for him, what one remembered, in
the midst of grief for his sufferings, was,
above all, his flooding vitality. Men will
speak of his great feats in the war ; these
are written in our formal annals and in
personal books. Others will remember
his high-hearted steadiness during the
long years in the desert.
Knowing him after the war, I think
of him as listening intently to some tiny
kiddies’ fantasies and helping to em-
broider them, or holding a group with
some unpretentiously told story. Out-
rageously funny those stories could be ;
or, again, very gentle, like the one about
being separated from his troop at night
as they entered the suburbs of Jerusalem
and knocking at a door to ask the way.
It was opened by a terrified German
householder, who said he had a kins-
woman upstairs who spoke a little English.
Throssell remembered the scene in
detail: a mixed family group, frozen with
privation and dread. An elderly woman
spoke to him timidly. He said to her,
“I did learn a scrap of German at school.
Isn’t there a rhyme about cock-a-doodle-
doo —
“Kikeriki, kikeriki,
Weckt der Hahn im Morgen friih”?
Wherever such a man appeared there
was laughter, energy, zest: you followed
his gestures, his hearty nonsense, his
racy words. We rented a country cottage
belonging to Katharine Prichard, and
when their boy was born he sent a
characteristic wire: “You have new
landlord, ferocious appearance.” With
his wife’s brilliant co-operation he gave
that little landlord a perfect boyhood,
training him hard and satisfying his
imagination. All this he did in spite of
recurrent depression and pain from “the
old war head. In the end he had to
leave all he loved, wife and child and
home. It was a bullet from Gallipoli that
found him.

A Satchel of Books
Harmony (Madame E. Marks, Sydney ;
6d.) is a new and bright monthly maga-
zine devoted to music, drama and the
allied arts. The first issue contains a
wealth of concert and stage news. Pos-
sibly the dramatic side will be strength-
ened later. The contributors include
some of Sydney’s most noted musicians.
First shot in the St. Saviour’s Cathe-
dral jubilee celebrations, to be held at
Goulburn next year, is the publication of
a small booklet by R. T. Wyatt. The
greater part consists of a description of,
and guide to, the cathedral, though its
history is given briefly. There are also
a number of pen-and-ink illustrations by
the author. Copies at one shilling may
be had from the Diocesan Church House.
Billabong’s Luck, by Mary Grant
Bruce (Ward Lock and Co.; 3s. 6d.),
is another wholesome Australian yarn
meant for boys and girls, but likely to
prove absorbing to quite a lot of grown-
ups. It is this good Australian authoress’s
24th book, and she writes as freshly as
ever of the inhabitants of Billabong sta-
tion and of their young friends Bob and
Tommy Rainham, and of the hard times
when all these cheerful bush people re-
fused to believe in bad luck, and so
steered their course to a happy ending.
This authoress knows stations, and she
knows boys and horses even better, and
writes about them convincingly and
pleasantly. The illustrations by Laurie
Tayler are attractive but scarcely cap-
ture local atmosphere.
Japan : Mistress of the Pacific ?, by Col.
P. T. Etherton and H. Hessell Tiltman
(Jarrolds; Robertson and Mullens; 18s.
6d.). This is a dull book, the typical pro-
duct of a proconsul—Etherton is late
H.M. Consul-General in Chinese Turkes-
tan, and was a Supreme Court Judge in
China. The pros and cons of Japan
making herself boss cocky of the Pacific
are discussed from all the familiar angles
known to orthodox diplomacy, and the
conclusion is come to that
a survey of their financial resources, and
the prospect of a foreign embargo on loans,
may have convinced the Japanese militarists
that in modern warfare —however glittering the
prizes may be —the bill is always presented and
must somehow be paid.
Sicilian Circuit, by the Earl of Cotten-
ham (Cassell; Angus and Robertson ;
7s. 6d.), is the modern equivalent of a
Whyte-Melville novel. Instead of riding
300-guinea hunters in the Midlands the
sporting aristos in this book drive £3OOO
cars at Brooklands and elsewhere, and
instead of discussing the conformation of
thoroughbreds they talk lightly of
K.L.G. sparking plugs, banks of
cylinders, supercharger casings and the
like. Otherwise they are the same people
—fearless, efficient, aggressively loyal to
King and country, authorities in all things
that concern cooking, clothes and social
conduct. Lord Cottenham has a quick
ear for the dialogue of his class, he can
tell a story, and he knows as much about
racing cars as any “gentleman rider” of
half a century ago knew abcut steeple-
chasers.

TWENTY YEARS AFTER.
John Thomas Lang has been a member
of the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly since
December, 1913. On completing his
twentieth year he was entertained in the
Auburn Town Hall and presented with
an illuminated address ; and, of course,
he made a speech. It is the custom on
such occasions to refer in a kindly fashion
to old leaders and associates, especially
those who have gone ; but John Thomas
is above such weaknesses. McGowen,
who was his leader when he first went
looking for a Labor nomination ; Hol-
man, who succeeded McGowen ; .Storey,
who gave him his first portfolio ; Dooley,
who kept him in the Treasury when
Storey died ; Willis, who stood by him
and held up his hands when things looked
desperate with him in 1926 ; Griffith, the
Canns, Black, Mutch—none of these he
mentioned by name, though some he
mentioned indirectly, and ruthlessly.
Looking back through the vista of
time, the speaker found it thronged with
“traitors.”
Over and over again the 30 pieces of silver
have done their work. If Labor had never
raised a Judas the people would not be in
the position they are in to-day. With a past
history of the Labor movement so filled with
betrayals of the people’s cause, the movement
to-day is far too tolerant towards disloyalty.
And “the men and women of ‘the move-
ment’ ” are not guiltless.
There would be no traitors in Parliament if
you did not put them there. Until you can
make your representatives feel and believe that
the greatest honor is to be able to say they
have never once failed to respond to a party
call, and the most shameful thing that any man
could do is to disobey the movement, you
must always be prepared to find traitors in
your ranks.
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate.
What is “the movement” and who are
“traitors”? Seemingly John Thomas is
truth and “the movement” both, and
“traitors” are those who get in his way.
It must not be inferred from the quoted
reflections and forebodings that John
Thomas is a prey to melancholy. Nothing
of the kind. He is ’appy. Far too ’appy
to need sympathy.
In trying to serve the fellow-citizens of my
native State I have received the greatest gift
that God or man could bestow. It has brought
me happiness, such happiness that no degree
of wealth or position could achieve.
Wealth, one gathers, he despises, though
he has done pretty well for himself, by
all accounts —much better than any of
the “traitors.” He has “always viewed
the Labor cause as one as sacred as any
religion.” Yet religion is a great matter.
Any man who claims to be a Labor man
and yet rejects or despises the Christian reli-
gion is a hypocrite, because the Labor party’s
fight all the time is for the lowly and oppressed
and the weak.
Hence, no doubt, its tender concern,
when John Thomas was Premier, for
tin-hare Swindells and lottery promoters
and merchants of fruit-machines. John
Thomas’s newspaper—the one over
which he has the 5 per cent, mortgage
for £13,700 which was exempted from
his tax on mortgages and his Moratorium
Act —has made a point of sneering at
Stevens for being religious; but ap-
parently this is only pretty Fanny’s
way. Certainly it described Henry’s
divorce measure as “the Free-love Bill,”
though the thing merely proposed to
make lunacy and separation for seven
years grounds for divorce, as they are
almost everywhere else; and its mort-
gagee and all his meek followers voted
against it. And under the same gentle-
man’s leadership the party is now com-
mitted to State subsidies for denomina-
tional schools. The “traitors” were all
for free, compulsory and secular educa-
tion, which was Labor policy for forty
years.
But let it not be supposed that the
politician who snuffled so much at
Auburn stands for brotherly love and
turning the other cheek. “In trying to
serve the fellow-citizens of my native
State,” which has brought him so much
happiness and made him so independent
of sympathy, he has not tried, nor will
he try, to serve them all. There are those
among them whom he calls “the enemy,”
and to “the enemy” he will give no quar-
ter. “The enemy” stands behind “the
financial structure that is strangling the
people.” Not the N.S.W. Government
Savings Bank which bears the name of
John Thomas on a foundation-stone —its
capacity for strangling anyone except
the depositors whose accounts John
Thomas’s Government guaranteed came
to an abrupt finish when John Thomas
was Premier —but the “financial institu-
tions!” which he has been denied the
opportunity to smash.
Judged on his record since he reached
office in 1920, John Thomas is two ends
and the middle of a dud. No Ministry of
which he has been a member has lasted
for the life of a Parliament. He wrecked
his own Governments and Scullin’s.
He borrowed to the limit when he could
and defaulted when he could borrow no
more. His path to notoriety is strewn
with taxes, deficits, the wrecks of pledges
—made to the Governor, the wheat-
growers, the bondholders, the people—
and of friendships. He never stands up
to anyone who faces him fairly. He is
so conceited that he is incapable of
learning from his follies, or even of
realising that he has committed follies ;
for the rest, he hates furiously, not things
so much as men. And, so that he may
gain a greater measure of power than
any he has yet achieved, and attempt
polities far more difficult and dangerous
than those of which he made so egregious
a mess when he had the chance, he is
going to dedicate the few remaining
years of his disastrous career to inciting
decent and kindly Australians to hate
others as kindly and decent.
THE PROBLEM OF YOUTH.
The best Christmas present which the
Governments of Australia could give to
the country would be a solution of the
juvenile-unemployment problem. While
adult unemployment is being mitigated
—it is now 25 per cent, over the whole
of the trade unions—the plight of the
youngsters grows worse.
Preference to the married has hit the
single. In Government departments
which have enforced it, it has resulted in
dozens of hasty and ill-considered unions,
One was before a Sydney Court the other
day ; the wife swore that she had married
only to oblige her friend, who could not
have kept his job in the Railway Depart-
ment otherwise. But this is only a minor
feature. The main one was indicated
l as t we ek by a mining deputy, Mr.
p rflW f nr H who at Ossnnrk tnld a Cnm-
Urawtord, wno at UessnocK torn a tom
misslon which 1S inquiring into technical
education that the unemployed youths
are a menace, and that in a few years
they be strong enou S h t 0 ,ak = the
collotry from the Present rulers.”
An exaggeration, no doubt, but, living
on the c “i fle ids, the man canAot b!
h lamerl Thirtv ner cent nf all our rnal-
nlamea. 1 flirty per cent, or alt our coal
miners are out of work, and probably 70
per cent, are out of full work-—a large
proportion have only rationed jobs which
give them three or four shifts a fortnight,
or less. On both the South Coast and
the North Coast of N.S.W., and in the
industrial suburbs of the big cities par-
ticularly, thousands of youngsters have
grown from the age of 14 to 18 on the
dole. They have never done any work
themselves. They have rarely seen their
parents work.
About the streets of Illawarra coal-
mining towns can be seen boys and girls
of 16 and 17 who do not own a pair of
boots, who have no occupation but lean-
ing against verandah-posts or lying on
the beach, or playing two-up and housie-
housie. There is no future for them
except idleness, no occupation open to
them except mischief,
In the cities it is as bad. Hard times
always raise the standard of labor re-
quirement. Mechanically-minded lads
who formerly could depend upon getting
a technician’s job at £4 or so a week on
reaching their majority are completely
excluded from the labor market. Mar-
ried men and technical graduates from
the universities who would have scorned
such minor occupations in the days of
prosperity elbow them out of the few
jobs which are available, not merely in
mechanical avenues, but behind the
counters of electrical and similar houses.
Girls who have been specially trained
for clerical or mercantile positions are
thrown back into the homes, where often
the dole is the only means of sustenance.
And desperate is the struggle for work
in big stores, which can accommodate
only a tithe of the applicants.
And at the end of every school year
this accumulation of idle youth is added
to. The high-school examination results
show how increasingly eager each new
generation is to fit itself for the battle of
life. In N. S. Wales alone this
year 61,000 children sat for the final
primary-school examination, 13,500 for
the intermediate and 4200 for the leaving-
certificate. There has been a substantial
increase since 1932, and also in the
numbers competing for high-school
entrance and bursaries —to 17,000 for the
former and 6000 for the latter. Unless
these youngsters are to have a chance to
make use of the advantages which a
heavily-taxed State gives them, the money
spent on them is worse than wasted,
because the discontented trained mind
is dangerous.
The police reports already show the
fruit which the tree of youthful idle-
ness is bearing. In N. S. Wales in
1932-33 offences by persons under 21
years old increased by 1314 —nearly 19
p.c. over the previous year. Assaults on
the police more than doubled in a year ;
riotous and offensive behavior increased
40 p.c.; false pretences over 40 p.c. ,
missile-throwing 240 p.c.; receiving stolen
property 70 p.c. ; breaking and entering
7 p.c.—from 1225 cases to 1306 ; illegally
using motor-cars from 64 to 180. Yet
many of these boys and girls no doubt
pass through the courts simply because
they have not got a chance to live rightly.
So much for the generation now in
adolescence; and there are other har-
vests to be reaped. The Smith Family, a
kindly institution of a few hundred
anonymous people in Sydney, decided in
1932 to extend its ministrations to
under-nourished children. It had no
difficulty in finding 1500 cases whose
needs exhausted the capacity of its very
limited funds and the spare time at the
disposal of its 68 honorary medical
officers. The campaign involved over
5000 medical visits and treatment averag-
ing four months per child. If facilities
had been available ten times as many
cases could have been profitably handled
in the Sydney industrial suburbs alone. It
is appalling to think that thousands of
sturdily-bred young Australians, in a land
where production capacity is 20 times
equal to our needs, should have stunted
growth, poor health and idleness and
crime as their inheritance.
The problem is not easy of settlement,
but other countries are tackling it. Ger-
many and the U.S.A. have met it with vast
camps where young fellows live under
Boy-Scout conditions and are trained in
forestry and other rural work. Here the
establishment in industrial districts of
technical centres and in country districts
of seasonal farm-work schools would
prove useful ; and the revival of military
training, with allowance to jobless
youngsters for attendance at training
camps and drills, would assuredly help.
But the best hope for unemployed youth
of both sexes, as well as workless man-
hood and womanhood, would lie in a 50
p.c. reduction of the taxes which are
stifling the expansion of industry,
financed for at least two years by loans
on the premium- bond principle and
accompanied by a nation-wide campaign
for giving work.
“THE BULLETIN” GOES TO LAW.
Messrs. Cape, Kent and Osborne, solicitors, acting on behalf of The
Bulletin Newspaper Co., Ltd., have issued writs out of the N. S. Wales
Supreme Court against Australian Glass Manufacturers Company, Limited,
and the printer and publisher of the Melbourne “Age.” In each case
£lO,OOO damages is claimed.
The action taken arises out of the publication by the “Age” of an
advertisement which appeared in its issue of December 12.
DEMOCRACY OR FASCISM?
Colonel Campbell, after a row with a
section of his New Guard, announced the
formation of a Centre party whose slogan
is “Down with Lyons for not eradicating
Communism! Down with Stevens for
not abolishing unemployment!” In my
judgment, Lyons and Stevens have done
as well as could be expected in the direc-
tions indicated ; anyhow, there are defi-
nitely more Australians at work and
fewer advocating revolution than when
they took over. There isn’t a Communist
group in any of the States with the capa-
city to defy a dozen policemen.
Lyons and Stevens would no doubt
be among the last to claim all the credit
for this state of affairs. Communism has
never made much headway with races
of British stock (it offers too few rewards
for energy and initiative), and the rise in
the price of wool has done its share in
taking thousands off the dole. Sensible
politicians know how little they can do
to make their country prosperous. The
framers of the Versailles Treaty thought
they could make Germany pay for the
war. After lending the former enemy
billions sterling, which was paid back
in the form of reparations, indemnities
and the like, they put an end to the un-
profitable arrangement; and Germany
filed its schedule. The British lent the
French £50,000,000 in four sums, and
British politicians, not being able to see
into the future, allowed the loans to be
denominated in francs. The franc went
from lOd. to 2d. in 1926, and British
investors got 10 millions for their 50.
It should have been easy for the poli-
ticians to foresee the slump. Not only in
Australia, where overborrowing had
made it inevitable before the war, as
The Bulletin constantly pointed out, but
in every industrialised country. The
arrival of the Armistice meant that vast
hordes of young men who had been
trained only for war would be thrown
on the labor market, and that mechanisa-
tion, to which the war had given a tre-
mendous impetus, would keep many
skilled artisans out of jobs. The German
Rathenau was one of the few public men
who realised this at once. He had hardly
begun to talk about it when he was
assassinated.
A half-wit, it might be imagined, would
appreciate the effects of currency infla-
tion. Yet most of the European Govern-
ments experimented with it, to the bene-
fit of hardly anybody but gamblers in
valuta, and to-day American Congress-
men are talking of it. British politicians
insisted on educating the Egyptian fella-
heen, who are now making the Empire’s
Clapham Junction too hot to hold their
benefactors. British Liberals and Labor-
ites combined to dower India with the
blessings of industrialism (Mr. Snow-
den, as he then was, foresaw the da/
when Indians would take sixty million
pounds of British cotton goods annually,
“and there would not be an idle spindle
or loom in Lancashire”); but India has
put on a tariff and doubled its spindles,
and Lancashire is the loser.
The autocracies have been equally
short-sighted. Mussolini didn’t foresee
the slump, and Italy hasn’t escaped it.
Neither has Russia, which, by all
accounts, is every bit as wretched,
poverty-stricken and unfree after 15
years’ government in the supposed inter-
ests of the masses as it was under the
Czars. The only material differences be-
tween the post-war experiences of such
countries and those of the democracies
are that, whereas the tyrannies were
ushered in by wholesale gaolings, dosings
with castor oil, shootings and hangings,
the democracies plodded towards the eco-
nomic shambles of 1929, and after, with-
out molestation from their rulers.
This is the one outstanding point in
favor of our present system of govern-
ment. Democracy may be “a sordid
farce,” as Colonel Campbell has said ;
its “high priests” may be “mummers wad-
ing through a morass of filth” ; but the
high priests are well-meaning mummers,
as a rule. If they aren’t, or if, for any other
reason, they mess up the job of adminis-
tration too palpably (ruin Government
Savings Banks, threaten repudiation and
in the same breath undertake to borrow
large sums for the workers’ benefit), they
can be thrown out of office, as Lang was.
Democracies have long ceased to look
for vision in their leaders, whether poli-
tical or industrial. In the very year that
saw the beginning of the slump in the
U.S.A. the American Federal authorities
decided to double the quota of British
migrants ; and 65,000 workers were en-
couraged by their unions to cross the
Atlantic. When they found themselves
unemployed in a country which hadn’t
even a dole to offer them, they
made no complaints against those who
had deluded them. Their leaders had
acted in good faith ; it was all in the
game. An epitome of the democratic
spirit. Provided the electors of a country
like Australia can feel that the politicians
who let them down were honest men who
meant well they feel little deep resent-
ment. No one can be expected to spot a
winner every time, and in a democracy
it is always possible to change the tipster,
so to speak.
Not so under the system which per-
sons like Colonel Campbell put forward
as preferable to the alleged “sordid farce”
played by “incompetent mummers.”
Imagine an Australian State under an ex-
officer, or a committee or soviet of ex-
officers, with power to carry on indefi-
nitely without being called to account
for their mistakes! Democracy is no
heavenly dream, but this would be a
hellish nightmare.
HENRI SINGEMOINE.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Saved at Last.
It is all over. N. S. Wales Parliament
has given birth to the last of its litter
of new Legislative Councillors. If we
are to believe the words of the Prophet
Stevens, spoken last May, “the supremacy
of the people’s will is ensured for all
time and the prestige of Parliament re-
stored.” It is hoped that Mr. Stevens
will never have to look for a job as
a seer.
Presumably, he chose Parliament to
elect the new House because he thought
Parliament would be intelligent. Parlia-
ment let him down by casting nearly 40
informal votes. He adopted proportional
representation because he believed it
would give both Houses and all parties a
balanced representation in the new body.
His calculations have been set at naught.
Men like Ryan, the Assistant-Minister,
have had the fight of their lives to get
in on the last lap ; men like A. M. Hems-
ley polled fewer primary votes than one
person who had been strongly criticised
by a Judge, and another who had ex-
pressed pride in having made wagers with
starting-price bookmakers, lawbreakers
and taxdodgers, over the Parliamentary
’phones. An Independent previously un-
known in public life was able to poll
more primary votes in the final ballot
than E. M. Mitchell, K.C., and Graham
Waddell. Richard Windeyer, K.C., an
able advocate whose family has nearly a
century of useful public service behind
it, had not a single supporter.
The turmoil during the last election
was worse than ever. The lobbies were
full of persons—surging, angry, eager—
fighting for their political lives. The snarls
of the defeated mingled with the
jubilations of the victorious and the
whisperings of manipulators. In addi-
tion to the force of detectives and
uniformed police who had made the
House look like Central Police Court
charge-corridor during previous elections,
there was an ambulance to take away an
hon. member who collapsed under the
strain, and the Stadium nearly had to be
called on for a referee when a bantam-
weight knight became obsessed with the
idea that he was Lurich and showed signs
of mixing it with a much larger honor-
able of old-Council vintage.
Experience proves more and more that
election by the people is out-and-away
the most satisfactory method of choosing
public representatives. What has hap-
pened at the first trial of election of
members by members is merely a foretaste
of what will be served up when the fruit-
machine and tin-hare men really under-
stand the Reform Act and its possibilities.
«
Meeting Asia Half-way.
As the All for Australia League died,
and a dozen more mushroom movements
born of hysteria, so has perished the war
scare which rose with the sap and wool
prices in September. The Government
at Canberra has been toying with a plan
to send a senior Minister of State to
Tokio on a goodwill mission. It is by
no means a bad idea, especially as it
seems settled that J. G. Latham, the out-,
standing member of the Ministry, who
already knows many leading Japanese
statesmen through his contact with them
at Geneva and Versailles, will go.
Eight hundred million people live
round the fringes of Asia between
Karachi and Saghalien. Their needs are
our opportunity, but we have alwavs
treated them as of a world apart. India
has been important enough for the King
to break all precedents and visit it, but
the Pearces and the Lyonses have not
found it worth while to go there. Japan
bulks large enough in world politics for
British princes to make the journey as
national envoys. Hong Kong is one of
the most vital ports in the world ; Manila
is on the way, as is Batavia. All could
be reached inside 24 hours’ air flight in
modern machines from the Australian
coast. Yet our politicians look beyond
them to London and Paris and away
from them to Washington.
The strange thing is that for years
both Japan and China have thought it
worth while to maintain Consuls-General
in Australia ; and it evidently pays them.
India has sent us emissaries, Japan
delegations from the House of Peers,
but we ignore their overtures, even
though they mean more to us in possible
trade than we could mean to them.
Our self-isolation seems to be born of
a feeling that our immigration restric-
tions have made us the natural enemies
of Asiatic countries. But they have not.
Asia is quite accustomed to restric-
tions both as suffered and inflicted by
itself. Japan’s supervision over the settle-
ment of whites in her territories is far
more stringent than that which we direct
against her nationals; and 90 per cent,
of Orientals haven’t even heard that there
is such a thing as the White Australia
policy and wouldn’t care if they did. But
they would prick up their ears if they
heard that there was such a thing as Aus-
tralian trade.
♦
Territory Development.
A sub-committee of the Cabinet which
changes its mind so often has published
its notions about the development of
North Australia, having embodied them
in a prospectus. It suggests a lease for
“a term of years” to any chartered com-
pany desiring to develop “Crown lands
which are not already leased,” and
nominates the Victoria River area and
the Barkly Tableland as the districts most
suitable.
As term is the essence of the matter
this nebulous offer will not have the
slightest attraction for overseas investors.
And the area not at present leased in the
regions named is not worth anyone’s con-
sideration.
Other clauses are as cloudy, and others
again are unwise. For instance, “a special
tariff for North Australia” is proposed, or,
alternatively, no tariff at all. The Barkly
Tableland is no more entitled to this
concession, which would endanger the
national fiscal policy, than the Queens-
land Gulf country just across the border,
or than North Westralia. Once that sort
of thing starts there is no knowing where
it will end.
It would be far better to pay a bonus
on development; but, anyway, it does
not matter very much. The old-womanly
platitudes which form the “scheme” won’t
tempt anybody, more especially as the
Government won’t deal with anybody
unless he first of all forms a company
and comes to Canberra capital in hand
as the representative of an existent com-
pany. London financiers don’t work that
way.

The New N.S.W. Chief Justice.
The news that F. R. Jordan, K.C., is to
be the next N. S. Wales Chief Justice will
come as a relief to thousands, because he
has never been associated with political
rows. It was hoped by some and feared
by others that a politician would be
appointed. Mr. Jordan has all the neces-
sary qualifications from a practising bar-
rister’s standpoint. He is an all-rounder:
not only an Equity specialist, but one
who has practised with distinction on the
Common Law side and before the High
Court; and he is an authority on Com-
pany Law, Bankruptcy, Probate and
Divorce.
Brilliance as a lawyer is not regarded
as an essential by everybody. “What is
chiefly needed,” said a great authority,
“is a gentleman ; and if he knows some
law so much the better.” By “gentleman”
was meant one of good feeling and
manners ; the rare type who is capable
of being reasonable, courteous and dig-
nified in all circumstances —the possessor,
in short, of what is known as a “judicial
mind.” Mr. Jordan answers to this re-
quirement.
A great point in the new C.J.’s favor is
that he has no one but himself to thank
for his eminence. He reached the Sydney
High School on a scholarship, became
an evening student at the University,
took his degree while earning his living
as a public servant, and so reached the
Bar. His parents came from England.
That he should have attained to the Chief
Justiceship at the age of 52 is at the same
time a tribute to the wisdom of the
Stevens Government and of Acting Chief
Justice Harvey, who is understood to have
recommended the appointment, and an
advertisement to England and the Empire
of the chances that are still open in Aus-
tralia to ability and industry.

Fixed Election Dates.
From J. A. J. Hunter, secretary of the
Country party in the House of Reps.: --
Much of the criticism levelled against party
government, etc., arises from ignorance of the
facts. All the same, abuses are growing'; Par-
liament, as the instrument to give expression
to the will of the majority in the House, is
gradually ceasing to function.
Once Cabinets used to worry about what it
was possible to get through the House ; now
it is a question of what the Cabinet (or a small
coterie in it) can be graciously pleased to give
the House. To-day, secure in their power
ever their own followers, Governments can
snap their fingers at Parliament.
Private members are expected to approve,
never to disapprove; disapproval is resented'
The principal and most effective method de-
vised of dragooning private members—and one
brought to a fine art nowadays—is the manu-
facture of “political crises” by the declaration
of any little thing as “vital,” defeat or altera-
tion of which will be followed by the resigna-
tion ?f the Ministry and an immediate election.
This threat of an election is the most power-
ful weapon in the hands of a Government
Not only members of Parliament but people
m general do not desire frequent elections.
Jhus, when a “crisis” has been manufactured
by the Cabinet and broadcast by party press
organs, the members responsible for the “crisis”
i.e., those who, are trying to give expression
to the will of the majority in the House —are
about as popular as a fox in a fowlhouse. The
Government trades on this unpopularity.
Removal of this instrument of despotism
from the hands of the Cabinet would imme-
diately result in better and more stable legis-
lation, as full use could be made of the
knowledge and experience of private mem ;
bers. Adoption of a fixed election date
would do the business. This fixed election
date is practicable, while many of the idealistic
schemes propounded are not. If the elections
could be held only on a particular date every
three (or five) years, the defeat of a Govern-
ment measure in the House would only mean
that the Government would be forced to adopt
the views of the majority, or make way for a
new Government, made up from the material
already in the House.

A Team Is to Go.
There are some singularly stupid persons
on the Board of Cricket Control. That
concern chose the worst possible time for
its protest against Larwood’s bowling and
Jardine’s tactics, expressed it in the
clumsiest language, and has been flound-
ering ever since.
It was thought that the last had been
heard of the miserable bodyline contro-
versy when the Marylebone C. C. cabled
on October 9 that the Australians invited
to England next year could “rely on a
warm welcome” and “take the field with
the full assurance that cricket will be
played here in the same spirit as in the
past, and with the single desire to pro-
mote the best interests of the game in
both countries.” But an unnecessary
meeting of the board was held, the out-
come of which was a fatheaded message
“assuming” that the M.C.C. dispatch was
“intended to give the assurance asked fox-
in our cable of September 22” —in effect,
that Jardine and Larwood would be repu-
diated and that there would be no more
bodyline bowling—and adding “It is on
this understanding that we are sending
a team.”
This was inviting a snub, and it was
well and truly administered. The M.C.C.
replied that its cable of October 9 was
“final; we cannot go beyond the assur-
ance therein given.” Nor could the old
gentlemen. Suppose the method of
bowling objected to had been devised by
the Australians of the 1920-21 Eleven,
would the board itself have dared to re-
pudiate Armstrong and Gregory or
McDonald? The M.C.C. proceeded to
say:
We shall welcome the Australian cricketers
who come to play cricket with us next year.
If, however, your board decides that such
games should be deferred, we shall regret their
decision.
The onus was now on the board to
cancel the tour or scramble out of the
mess of its own making, as best it might.
To the indignation of Mr. Kelly (Mel-
bourne) and Mr. Hartigan (Brisbane), the
secretary, instructed by the chairman,
replied:
We, too, now regard the position as finalised.
Our team will leave on March 9 to play cricket
with the English teams.
Cancellation would have been preferable;
so many foolish things have been said and
such unpleasant possibilities suggested
that it would be better for both countries
to drop international cricket for a few
years. In the meantime Australia could
get a new Board of Control or get rid
of it altogether.

Spooner Not Spineless.
It used to be thought that the Minister
of Local Government had one of the
cushy jobs in N. S. Wales, but Spooner,
who is Assistant-Treasurer as well, is
kept busy. He has had trouble with
Katoomba’s council, which wanted to
carry on without an engineer, regardless
of the Act; with Manly, which de-
manded £19,000 of unemployed-ielief
money for dressing-sheds on one of its
beaches, and with Bankstown over a
municipal sanitary contract. A forth-
right person, he has insisted on the
appointment of an engineer, vetoed the
loan and sent the Bankstown aldermen
about their business. Their council has
been dissolved and an officer of the de-
partment is now administering the dis-
ordered affairs of the municipality.
Bankstown is a Labor district. After
the Labor fashion it has borrowed
royally, having liabilities amounting to
£284,000 at the end of the latest year
for which the Government Statistician
gives details ; and before the blow fell one
of the “Tory” aldermen glumly predicted
that the council would not be able to
carry on after February. Be this as it
may, the predominant section gave a five-
year sanitary contract to a new tenderer
at a price which worked out at £4O a
week more to the ratepayers than the
existing contract. “Irregularities” were
alleged, and Spooner ordered an investiga-
tion, which was conducted by the officer
aforesaid. The report was to the effect
that, while there was no definite evidence
of corruption, gross neglect and want of
consideration for the ratepayers’ interests
had been shown. The Minister put it to
the council that fresh tenders should be
called and that meanwhile the present
arrangement might be continued for
three months. In reply the predominant
party referred in contemptuous terms
to the Minister and his officer, refused
to call for fresh tenders and insisted on
giving the contract to the concern charg-
ing an additional £4O a week. Within
48 hours the council was dissolved, and
it deserved what it got.
Municipal extravagance is responsible
in no small degree for the financial
plight to which N. S. Wales has been re-
duced. At the end of 1931 the city and
country municipalities and shires owed
in the aggregate £45,706,700, to which
Sydney and its inner and outer surburbs
had contributed £35,465,900. Of course
there were bright examples in both city
and country, such as Erskineville, with
a fixed debt of £2310, and Strathfield,
with one of £2963 ; brighter examples
still were Barraba, Bingara, Braidwood,
Broughton Vale, Carcoar, Castlereagh,
Grenfell, Gulgong and others, which had
no fixed debts and owed very little to the
banks. At the other end of the scale were
Waverley, with liabilities to bondholders
and the banks amounting to £508,000, and
a deficit for the year of £44,770 ; Ku-
ring-gai, £494,000 and £16,000 ; Manly,
£323,800 and £21,500; Canterbury,
£478,800 and £15,400; North Sydney,
£172,000 and £19,700. Six Sydney
suburbs alone had deficits totalling
£134,000 —generally speaking, the result
of reckless loan expenditure.
As the admirable writer who does the
Local Government column for the “S.M.
Herald” said recently, “the bigger they
are the more they borrow.”
♦
Hoots Awa, Georgie!
“El V.”: George Foster Pearce spent a
perplexed week before he decided to
allow the Victorian Scottish to wear the
kilt. “The question of cost would have
to be gone into,” he said, and so would
“the advisability of abandoning the Aus-
tralian uniform with its traditions.”
As the Australian uniform with its
traditions was copied from other uni-
forms, with slight adaptations, and as
it has been largely abandoned already,
that doesn’t seem to matter very much.
Moreover, outside Australia famous
regiments don’t run to permanence in
their fighting clothes. Uniforms alter out
of recognition every generation. The old
73rd (later the Second Battalion of the
Black Watch), when stationed on Culaba,
at Bombay, beat a hasty retreat before
the mosquitoes, about the year Australia
was founded, out of kilties into trews or
trousers —I forget which, but they are
different things. To-day, stationed at
Mooltan, they ordinarily wear shorts,
wide in the legs, which look like kilts but
aren’t. They are the most comfortable
garment for leg wear yet made.
The reasons why anybody wants to
wear kilts are not atavistic. Up till
the eighteenth century, when only High-
landers wore them, they were regarded
by the Sassenach as the mark of the
thief. They were discouraged after Cul-
loden, along with the bagpipe and the
claymore ; and then lots of people who
had hitherto been satisfied with panta-
loons and silk stockings wanted to get
into them. Persons named Srinavastri
Taporevala and Mclsaacstein began to
don them as a matter of course, and
Lowlanders whose grandfathers would
not have been seen dead in them began
to acquire a clan.
If it will satisfy the innocent barbarism
of the Wilsons and Mackays of Victoria
to be seen springing out of the bracken
garbed in striped skirts and shouting
Gaelic war-cries, it will not matter much
to Australia so long as they are good
soldiers. But perhaps George has a
fear in his heart that they will acquire
Hebridean habits with their Hebridean
garb and appear outside the Senate in
the fashion of old time, daubed with tar
and hung with dirk and targe, to settle
the income-tax and salary-grab questions,
as Macdonnell of Keppoch or Maclean
of Duart would have settled them—by
settling G. F. Pearce.
With a little tact, however, the Defence
Department should be able to wean these
wild Scotsmen from their folly. It should
be pointed out to them that Australia
possesses immemorial uniforms far more
picturesque and barbarous and much
cheaper than any ever worn on Islay
or around Loch Ei. That of the First
Arunta Regiment of Scouts, for instance
—a parrot-feather helmet, a cicatrice,
seven yellow spots and two dogs’ teeth
on a string—was highly economical and
imposing, and the outfit of the 2nd Bulu-
mulu Boomerangs (King Buck-Eye’s
Own), which consists of a parrot-feather
armlet and half a pound of goanna fat
well rubbed in, would attract more atten-
tion in Upper Collins-street than all the
tartan between here and Dunvegan.


Society
“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Lord Luvus”: I have inside informa-
tion regarding the plot for kidnapping
the bride of the Lud Mayor of Mel-
bourne. It was instigated by our old
friends Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
Finn, and it miscarried only because the
two desperadoes differed about methods.
Huck wanted to dig a tunnel beneath the
Yarra and lay high explosive under the
Brookes mansion, escaping with the prize
in the confusion. Tom wanted to drop
a rope ladder from an aeroplane and
drag the quarry through her bedroom
window. They also disagreed about the
subsequent disposal of the booty. Huck,
being of a mercenary nature, wanted to
keep her in captivity in a suburb and
“Where’s your husband ?”
“I’ve sent him back for my swimming costume.”
sell the story to the “Herald.” Tom
wanted to transport her to the Solomons
and make her queen of a tropical island,
Huck was for keeping the project a dead
secret, but Tom, being of a romantic
disposition, insisted on writing the
anonymous warning letter, so that Nor-
man Brookes might inform General
Blarney and there would be plenty of
police about the house to make the ad-
venture more spectacular. He also hoped
there would be press photographers pre-
sent with flashlights. It is a matter for
public rejoicing that they were so occu-
pied debating these points, with fists
mostly, that they forgot the due date,
and the bride arrived at the portals of
St. Paul’s without misadventure.
* * * *
“Nakh”: A master at one of Mel-
bourne’s leading public schools was in-
vited to the home of another master who
lived out. During the evening one of
the family rushed in and said there was
a strange animal in the front garden.
“Dinna fash yeself, mon,” said the visitor
to his host. “I noticed that your lawn
was sadly in need of cutting, so I brought
along ma coo!”
* * * *
“X.S.”: Another carefully planned
theft went agley in Melbourne the other
day. The thief smashed a jeweller’s win-
dow and snatched £4OOO worth of gems
and rings. A woman grabbed his coat-
tails and he dropped £lOOO worth of the
loot. He then careered down the street,
evading tackles by passers-by and shed-
ding wealth as he went. Finally he dashed
into a building and disappeared through
a fireproof wall. An accomplice was
waiting and promptly fastened the door
with a piece of wood. The rogues got
clean away, but 12 honest people re-
turned to the owner every item of the
stolen property.
* * * *
“Jungor”: The late Grant Hervey, or
George Cochrane, had some variegated
experiences in every part of the Com-
monwealth. He once invaded the Speck
with the object (unrealised) of securing
the Labor nomination for a Parliamen-
tary seat, and Westralia acquired him
for a space about 30 years ago. Kalgoor-
lie “Sun,” knowing the young man only
as one of The Bulletin’s most promis-
ing verse-writers, offered him a staff job,
and he descended on Kalgoorlie as rapidly
as steamboat and train could carry him
there. Unfortunately his days in the
goldfields capital were short and some-
what chequered, and he was fated to
see little of Perth except from the inside
of a hospital, where he was laid up with
a severe bout of typhoid. Nevertheless,
he found time to write some of his best
verse in that brief and troubled period,
and Hervey’s best, when he was in the
early twenties, was very good indeed.
* * * *
“Exdig”: Destruction of liquor in
France (B. 6/12/’33) was far from un-
common. In one case a Digger in our
platoon discovered that the cellar of an
estaminet on the outskirts of Meteren
had been left intact. Each man took it in
turn to repair thither, have his drink, and
fill his water-bottle. H.Q. heard about
it and sent a squad to smash up the
liquor, but a shell from Fritz did the
job before they arrived—luckily for the
squad. It is more than likely that the
intact cellar was a booby-trap. Again
at Morbecque there was a well-stocked
officers’ canteen when the town was in
the back area ; the German push in the
spring of 1918 altered matters, and the
canteen had been demolished before the
British troops retired. When we marched
in, the smell of the wine came to us afar
off; our boys, refusing to believe that
the Tommies had been foolish enough
to destroy the lot, decided that an adja-
cent pond was the most likely hiding
place. For more than a day the pond
looked like the scene of an angling con-
test as Diggers probed it with poles
resultlessly. Still, some of the stuff had
been planted. Feeling something hard
under the straw in the barn which was
our billet I located three bottles of
whisky myself.
“R.M.O. 35th”: Somehow an “and”
was substituted for an “or” in my par.
“I want a pair of stockings.”
“For your wife, or shall I show you something better ?”
What 1 wrote was: “Many a wounded
Digger passed from my aid post that
day with a glass of champagne in his
stomach or a dose of morphia under his
skin.” The slightly wounded and physi-
cally knocked up had the wine ; those
exhausted by pain and shock had the
morphia. There would be no sense in
giving the same man a stimulant and a
narcotic. Curiously enough, I note in
your list of December birthdays the name
of the C.O. who ordered the destruction
of the champagne.

“Pat Bushie”: A Sydney suburban
police sergeant called at a courthouse
the other day for a subpoena Ad test
or duces tecum . demanded the clerk
the usual query. The applicant reflected
a moment. I think 111 take it with me,
he Anally decided. * *
“Nakh”: The epidemic of sub-aquatic
exploration amongst Melbourne juveniles
has moved a newspaper correspondent to
demand that drains should be closed by
gratings. But this would only make
things worse. If the drains are barred
anybody who gets swept against them is
likely to be drowned, or at any rate badly
battered by the weight of water. The
two youths who recently passed success-
fully through a mile and more of sub-
terranean tunnel escaped because they
had a free passage. One of them actually
got through only by diving under two
gratings that barred his progress.
* * * *
“Black Mountain”: The letters written
to King George by a man professing to
be the illegitimate son of the Duke of
Clarence seem to have reached their
destination more surely than many bear-
ing the same address. There was a hardy
war-time story of a stonebroke Digger,
due for London leave, who thought his
sovereign would be a likely mark for
a loan. His letter ran: “Dear George,—
I am rather short of cash. As I am about
to go on leave would you mind sending
me a tenner?” The brigade censor, re-
luctant to keep the joke to himself, had
the missive sent to General Birdwood.
G.H.Q. had its laugh, but a whip
round for the needy one followed. The
notification that £7 was enclosed went
forward, but the letter paper was evi-
dently recognised and the censor pre-
sently intercepted another letter for the
King. Thanks were expressed for the
timely loan, “but next time please send
the cash to me direct, as Birdwood stuck
to three quid.”

“Ebor”: Australian girls will regret
the swift passage of the Duke of North-
umberland, a youngster now on his way
to M.L., who holds half a dozen
eighteenth-century titles and the Percy
name (which is not his by male descent,
Smithson being considered by his recent
forebears as too democratic). He looks
about as much like a Duke as Billy
Hughes, but that may be forgiven any
lad who at 21 owns four such residences
as Albury Park (Guildford), Alnwick
Castle (Northumberland), Kielder and
Syon House at Brentford. The last Duke
of the eighteenth century, a testy old
person with regal ideas who used to
insist on dining in mediaeval splendor of
the sort which is observed to-day only
at Windsor and Hollywood, had his name
linked to Australia through his patron-
age of George Johnston, of Bligh Rebel-
lion fame, who kept him in touch with
Botany Bay affairs. The library at Aln-
wick Castle owns a number of historic
Australian manuscripts of the period.

"El V.”: What a garden is the official
mind! In Sydney’s rejuvenated Wyn-
yard-square, now bright with flowers, the
City Council has erected, on the ugliest
stilts it could find, the tablets of the law
dealing with park-users. The com-
mandments number 35. It is illegal to
beat carpets in Wynyard-square. You
mustn’t lie on the grass, lean against a
tree or wheel a perambulator across a
flower-bed. Also, it is forbidden to go
in swimming in a place where there is no
water, or to sit on a seat reserved for
ladies when there are no such seats,
And you may also be fined for defiling
the fence which doesn’t exist. Looking
round, I couldn’t help noting that inside
the park a dirty person was lying full
length on the new and expensive turf,
kicking holes in it with a meditative heel,
while outside, 20 feet away, a large and
solemn constable, notebook in hand, was
preparing a rod in pickle for motorists
who had left their cars parked in the
street a minute or so over the legal 20
minutes.
CHRISTMASTIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bright-berried holly and mistletoe—
Wattle and Christmas-bush or -bells—
Great plains a-bake in the cruel glow
Of the noontide sun—or frost and snow
With icy hands upon woods and dells.
What does it matter, the place or clime?
The wide world over it’s Christmastime.
Tough old rooster or juicy meat,
Quivering jelly or blazing duff;
Wherever you are, whatever you eat,
The thinnest soup and the sourest sweet
And.(at worst) tinned dog will be Christmas
stuff.
Though you’re countless miles from where
church bells chime,
They’ll all taste better at Christmastime.
For every health that in wine they toast
There’ll be hundreds honored in malt-and-
hop.
Vet a tid’s a tid. And as guest or host
I’m bound to say that I’ve sampled most,
From Devon cider to Capetown dop.
And never a one was aught but prime,
I’m here to tell you, at Christmastime.
What pictures flicker, what memories rise
Of loaded stockings and candled trees,
Of cheery voices and laughing eyes!
Ah! ever and ever we change the skies
But not our hearts by the Seven Seas.
Through a burnished vault though the sun may
climb
We are one with Dickens at Christmastime.
A fleeting respite from toil and care;
From life’s “duff demnition grind” a spell;
A lull in the tongues that discord blare,
And I wander back to the days that were,
To the mirth and revel of Dingley Dell.
Here’s a hand-grip warm and a rugged rhyme
Now the wide world over it’s Christmastime!
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Verri”: When the young man selling
tracts came to our door dad was the only
one in. This was unfortunate, as dad
prides himself on his Biblical knowledge
and likes nothing better than tying tract-
vendors in theological knots. It was not
long before the young man was showing
signs of uneasiness, but he kept his
temper. Dad persisted until the young
man gathered up his wares and said he
must decline to discuss matters further.
Our progenitor escorted him to the gate
to have the last word; but he didn’t.
When half-way down the street, the seller
of tracts turned round. “You go to
hell!” he said.
* * * *
“Heddas”: All the unclaimed money
(B. 6/12/’33) wasn’t won in lotteries.
Hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth
of War and Peace Loan bonds were
planted away, particularly in outback dis-
tricts, and left intact for years without the
attached interest coupons ever being dis-
turbed. One of the settlers burnt out in the
Vic. bushfires of 1925 presented himself
at the Commonwealth Treasury and
timidly asked if two £lOO bonds he had
with him were any good. He got the shock
of his life when he was handed a cheque
“I didn’t hear you go after you asked father for me last night.”
“No. I never touched the steps.”
for £270 in exchange. He explained: “A
bloke come round speakin’ in the Shire
’All not long after the war started and I
put in two ’undred quid, but I thort I
was givin’ it to the soldiers for keeps.”
A bookmaker with a reputation for
shrewdness bought in 1918 £3OOO worth
of War Loan bonds. Five years later,
noticing Commonwealth Loan advertise-
ments to the effect that the interest would
be paid every half year and the capital
repaid on maturity, he called on the chief
loan organiser and sarcastically remarked
that “no Government bloke had ever
come near him to pay him any interest.”
He had locked the bonds away, it
appeared, in his safe and didn’t even
know the meaning of the interest coupons
that were attached to them, which were
worth £750 by this time. Seeing that
they were bearer bonds and that he
had bought them for cash without giv-
ing in his name, the authorities could
hardly be expected to know where he
could be found or even who he was.

“Wai-hoi” G. V. Portus, in his latest
book, is unjust to Eyre when he
refers to that explorer’s trip in 1841 from
Adelaide to King George’s Sound as “a
pointless adventure.” Far from being
that, it was definitely planned, following
on public agitation for overland com-
munication. In any case, Eyre’s feat in
heading the fearful line of cliffs at the
top of the Bight, battling through dense
scrub and over stretches of rotten coun-
try with 100-mile dry stages, until he
startled sleepy Albany one wet, blowy
morning by walking in there with a black
boy, shouldn’t be slighted by Portus or
anyone else.
* * * *
“Liq. Strych.”: Sydney daily news-
papers the other day published warnings
to all and sundry that certain youthful
thieves had looted a bowling club of a
21b. packet of “chloride of mercury, a
deadly poison.” It all depends. Chloride
of mercury is our old friend calomel,
familiar in conjunction with many a
spoonful of jam. Its effects are unpleas-
ant, but it is hardly poisonous in the ordi-
nary sense of the word. The stolen stuff
was more likely the bichloride —better
known by its colloquial name of corrosive
sublimate. A common disinfectant, this
is a deadly poison—and a mighty painful
one to boot.
* * * *
“L. 1.8.”: The tale of the considerate
burglars who left a message telling those
interested that the lock of the safe they
had tried to “blow” was full of explosive
(B. 13/12/’33) recalls another instance of
thoughtfulness on the part of the Turco-
Hun medical staff when the enemy was
being chased back to Palestine by the
Light Horse after Romani. Cholera was
always endemic among the Turkish
troops; it took heavy toll of the
wearied Jackos as they fought their way
back. At Bir-el-Abd and other places
where they made rearguard stands
cholera graves were specially indicated
by wooden signs carrying a warning in
German and English—a rather more
sporting gesture than most of us expected.
* * * *
“Gemmill”: “Oxmead” (B. 11/10/’33)
says there is no record in Australia
of any Parliamentarian having sought the
Speaker’s protection against a cartoonist.
I can cite one case. In 1906 or there-
abouts a well-known firm of Melbourne
clothiers extensively advertised on sub-
urban railway stations a new brand of
bathing suits. Most of the poster was
occupied by a ludicrous representation
of George Reid, clad in one of their con-
traptions and an eyeglass. George in-
dignantly appealed to the Speaker of the
House of Reps., and the offending
firm was communicated with. The next
day the caricature was everywhere
obliterated with a broadsheet announc-
ing that “He has gone to get dressed at
L S and Co.”!
* * * *
“Pank”: The Peacock lady has secured
her late husband’s seat in the Vic.
Assembly ; pity she couldn’t have secured
the Speaker’s chair as well. Women are
much more determined sticklers for form
and ceremony than mere men, and with
a lady behind the mace we might see an
end of those perfunctory bobs and nods
with which incoming and outgoing mem-
bers pay tribute to the dignity of Parlia-
ment, on the analogy of sailors saluting
the quarter-deck. A really grave and dig-
nified obeisance is hardly ever tendered
and apparently has almost ceased to be
expected. A woman Speaker would
remedy all this by the prescriptive right
of her sex. In fact, some of them are
essaying to do it already by the mere
force of example. More than once I
have noticed admiring references in the
Westralian press to the grace and courtli-
“I believe you have five hundred new models from Paris ?”
“Yes, madam.”
“Good. I wish to try them on.”
ness of Miss Holman’s salutation to the
Chair —a curtsey in her case, of course,
but a curtsey which is in itself a rebuke
to the slipshod bow of the average male
Parliamentarian. I hope I may live long
enough to see a skirted Speaker ; I have
an idea the innovation would take a lot
of the roughness and abusiveness out of
our Legislatures as well as improve mas-
culine manners.
* * * *
“Victrelle”: In a Sydney suburb the
other day a lady lost a valuable collie
dog. She advertised for it, offering a
substantial reward. Early
next morning a tot of four
or so arrived leading, or,
rather, being led by, Bruce.
She handed over her charge,
but steadfastly refused to
accept the reward; daddy
had told her not to take any
money and had promised her
a beating if she disobeyed
him. Inquiries having elicited
that she lived nearly a mile
away, she was asked why
daddy hadn’t brought the dog
himself. “I don’t know,” she
naively replied ; “I think it’s
because the behind’s out of
his trousers.” Daddy can
again face the world without
embarrassment, but every
time the lady looks at Bruce
she wishes he could talk.
* * *
“X.S.”: One of the bright-
est bits of forensic wit in
Melbourne history came from
under R. G. Menzies’s wig
recently. ’Sonah was sitting
down to work and, turning
over the appeal book, re-
marked on the small number
of cases. “There is not much
viscera in the book to-day,
Mr. Menzies,” he murmured. “No,
y’Honah,” said the Attorney-General,
“but what there is will be served up by
my learned friend as tripe presently!”
* * * *
“Narrinyeri”: S.A. Governor Hore-
Ruthven, V.C., who leaves in April, re-
ceived an interesting relic at Encounter
Bay, the old-time home of whalers, when
he was presented with a silver-mounted
walking-stick made from the wood of the
ship South Australia, wrecked there in
1837. The timber is teak, recovered from
the old wreck by diving. Lionel Rumbe-
low, whose forefathers for five genera-
tions fished in the waters of the bay, and
Frank Ewen, a son of one of the original
whalers, took the risk of being shark-
nipped when they recovered it. Miss
Madge Jagger handed over the stick;
her people took up land in the district
in 1839.
“Ishmael”: The history of poor old
Newfoundland, which has decided to
give up responsible government and re-
vert to Imperial control, might well set
some of Australia’s noisy secessionists
pondering on the soundness of that old
distich “He who will not when he may
When he will he shall have nay.” For
the island’s troubles have mostly arisen
from its refusal to become a part of
Canada when it was asked, and the
Dominion’s disinclination to be bur-
dened with it when it came to a better
frame of mind. It had more than one
chance, too. In 1867 the idea of Federa-
tion didn’t appeal to the islanders ; they
were reasonably prosperous, for one
thing, and for another the idea of
Britain’s oldest colony sinking its iden-
tity in that of Canada was repugnant.
In 1890 there was another attempt to
make Newfoundland see reason ; again it
failed. A few years later the boot was on
the other leg. Newfoundland began to go
broke ; and now it was the Dominion that
didn’t want it, jibbing at the idea of tak-
ing over the island’s public debt. In the
end Britain has had to do it, and the
oldest colony of all temporarily ceases to
be anything more than a dependency.
Newfoundland politicians of recent years
are described as being a poor old lot, but
it looks as if their fathers were even more
shortsighted.
* * * *
“Cine Ma”: An enterprising film
entrepreneur took astute advantage of
the excitement over the Mayoral wedding
in Melbourne. He sent up kites from
the Domain bearing the title of a picture
now going the rounds of the suburbs,
“There Goes the Bride.”
* S’! * *
“Avon”: From the “Neues Wiener
Tagblatt,” which got the oil from its
N’Yark correspondent, comes an account
of the most terrible scandal that has be-
smirched Maoriland since the days of the
“Sneddon voucher.” The “N.Z. Govern-
ment Mint” is involved. It appears that
for a year the M.L. police have been try-
ing to trace the origin of vast quantities
of spurious coins. A young constable
propounded a theory that the coins were
made in the Mint. Suspended on the com-
plaint of the governors of that institution,
he was proved right when a young em-
ployee of the Mint “ran up a large score
in a public-house one night” (the M.L.
pubs are supposed to close at 6 p.m., but
that only shows how lawless the
Dominon is) and paid in brand-new
coins, which he said he had got from the
National Bank. It was proved he hadn’t.
The police made a surprise raid on the
Mint and “discovered a large illicit coin-
ing plant.” The clerks and mechanics had
used the official dies to make coins out of
baser metals than were used in the pro-
per coinage. “One of the control
officials” organised distribution of the
fakes, and some of the highest officials
of the Mint were under suspicion of col-
lusion when the N’Yark correspondent of
the Vienna journal got his typewriter to
work. The only flaw in the story is that
Maoriland hasn’t got a Mint and never
had one.
THE REFORMATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.l
"All day, during the voting for the last 15 members
of the new Leg. Council, N.S.W. Parliament House
seethed with rumors of improper practices. One
U A.P. candidate aimed a blow at another; dis-
appointed Labor candidates surged into Mr. Lang's
office with bitter complaints and recriminations.”
“So alt day long the noise of battle rolled”
Our stately legislative halls throughout.
They fought—but not like Arthur’s knights of
old,
With gay insouciance and buffets stout,
Albeit, before the final vote was polled,
One chap had dodged a sock upon the snout.
They fought a outrance, but you’d hardly say
Their tournament recalled a knightly fray.
Those storied walls, whence statesmen in their
frames
Looked sadly down, with horrid rumors
shook;
Rose on the air exasperated claims
Someone or other should be brought to book
For devious doings and illicit games
And strategy that’s stigmatised as crook;
You’d hardly hear less edifying din
At wrestling matches or round hares of tin.
Forward and back accusive words were tost;
Dozens there were unable to divine
How in the blith’ring blazes they had lost
Except through treachery incarnadine;
Angry complaints of being double-crossed,
Dark innuendoes about “bodyline,”
Mingled no doubt with many a hearty curse
About the evil power of the purse.
“So all day long the noise of battle rolled,”
They jousted hard, but not in lists or rings;
They tilted sturdily, but not for gold.
Only for higher, less material things.
And what if some were bought and more were
sold,
At any rate we’ve sixty fewer kings
In those high haunts where erst in hordes they
swarmed.
Hats off, then, to our Upper House —Reformed!

POLITICAL POINTS
Section 92 of the Commonwealth Con-
stitution provides that “trade, commerce
and intercourse among the States shall
be absolutely free” ; but in respect of
commodities like wheat it has been
whittled away by political action. Now
the High Court has decided that motor
vehicles carrying goods from one State
into another must be licensed in both
States ; at least, that is the effect of the
judgment. The Vic. and N.S.W. Railway
Departments are rejoicing ; according to
the Vic. Minister, Menzies, “the decision
will simplify the problem of transport
regulation enormously.” It will also give
an enormous impetus to the Riverina
New State movement.
The Commonwealth Government has
been distributing Christmas presents,
among them £lOOO to Charles Ulm in
recognition of his meritorious flights
from England to Australia and on to
Maoriland; and £lOO a year to Bert
Hinkler’s mother. A day or two later it
came out that the great little airman had
left £12,181, mainly in Commonwealth
war bonds and Queensland bank de-
posits, in which his mother will share —
he died intestate. Canberra’s intelligence
service must be very bad.
At the instance of Attorney-General
Menzies, Vic. Leg. Assembly has
amended the Marriage Act in important
directions. Excessive use of drugs will
in future be a ground for divorce as well
as habitual drunkenness, cruelty and
desertion for three years ; and the lunacy
clause has been broadened to admit of a
sane partner obtaining a decree if the in-
sane partner has been in an asylum for
five years in “any part of the British
Dominions.” It has been held that the
existing law restricted relief to cases
where confinement in Victorian institu-
tions only could be proved, an interpre-
tation which led to “tragic results,”
Menzies says.
As a sort of comic interlude Australia
recently celebrated Thrift Week. This
is an international affair which might
have had some justification in the piping
times of prosperity. Now it is like a joke
uttered at a funeral.
Tilly Roos, the Afrikander Billy
Hughes, who formed a new party last
year, has continued his imitation of Billy
by returning to the fold. And now, per-
haps, the gentleman will start a Defence
of Africa League and snoop round
for traces of the foreign foe.
Last year 173,691 persons in N. S.
Wales registered for employment at Gov-
ernment labor exchanges and jobs were
found for 78,050 of them. For nine
months of this year 160,321 have regis-
tered and jobs have been found for
94,000. The figures are not so good as
they appear, because an additional 10,000
women have declared themselves work-
less this year, and 10,700 of the increase
in posts provided is represented by ex-
panded feminine dealings.
Commonwealth finances show a sur-
plus of £3,575,000 for five months. It
is pointed out that the results are no
guide to what the year’s outcome will
be ; still, collections look healthy. Cus-
toms figures are up to the estimate ; so
is excise. Sales tax already has realised
more than half the year’s Budget expecta-
tion with seven months to go and all
the Christmas trade returns to be thrown
in. Stevens’s deficit for the five months
is £2,367,000; Victoria’s, £2,498,477;
Forgan Smith is £672,813 down on his
operations.
A member of the Sydney trammies’
union has publicly thanked the Stevens
Government for introducing corridor
cars and chided the union executive for
not doing likewise. The proceeding re-
quired courage, for he revealed his name
and address, and the union is blindly de-
voted to Lang. Why, the Lord only
knows, for, though a leader of two Gov-
ernments and Treasurer in two others,
Lang never did anything to rid them of
the barbarous footboard, though asked
often enough. Incidentally, another
conductor fell from a footboard last
week and broke his neck. In the interests
of employees and passengers, particularly
women, the atrocity cannot be abolished
too soon.
Queensland is determined to find a
market for its power alcohol, manufac-
tured from sugar waste. From the New
Year wholesale dealers in petrol must
buy 2.1 gallons of power alcohol for
every 100 gallons of motor spirit sold.
And all persons selling motor spirit must
take out a license.
Since the U.S.A. went off gold Aus-
tralia has been paying its interest to
Uncle on a paper-dollar basis; and
34 paper dollars go to the ounce of
gold. Now the House of Lords has
delivered a judgment upholding the
validity of the gold clause in bond agree-
“Miserable lot o’ junk I had to give ’em this Christmas!”
ments. Australia was not directly con-
cerned in the case, but, according to
London “Financial News,” “Australia’s
position respecting dollar bonds becomes
delicate.” Dashed delicate, and little
satisfaction is to be derived from railing
at Theodore, who pioneered borrowing
in Wall-street, or Lang, who followed his
example.
Philanthropists who have money to
burn for all-comers offering any or no
security enter the valley of tribulation
in Queensland as from January 1. From
that date every moneylender must pay a
registration fee of £lO and another tenner
for each additional office. He must
notify every change of address, and that
will cost him another pound. Further,
not more than 20 per cent, interest is to
be charged, and that on the current
amount of the loan. Penalties are heavy.
Forgan Smith announces that Dr. Brad-
field has been appointed designing and
constructing engineer of the new bridge
over the Brisbane River. The appoint-
ment dates from January 1. The Bureau
of Industry, which special legislation has
empowered to supervise and conduct
building operations, is organising an
executive for this purpose.
Lang at Auburn:
Every Labor man in public life should make
a practice of saying to himself every day: “I
am a Labor man. The Labor movement made
me, and the Labor movement can destroy
me.”
Hence, it follows that he should put
party above country, faction above the
public weal. He must revise Abraham
Lincoln’s definition of democracy and
make it read “government of the people,
by a section of the people, for a section of
the people.” But even when he has done
that difficulties are likely to arise when
there are two or more Labor parties (in
South Aus. there are three) and nobody
can say for certain which is likely to
come out on top.
The Soviet has set up a religion which
teaches that there is no next world and
that happiness must be asked for and
expected in this. No Government ever
did a more reckless thing. If the happi-
ness does not arrive the moujik will shove
the blame on his Government. The Gov-
ernment will either have to blame itself
or blame the moujik. Apparently it is
adopting the second alternative. It used
to accuse foreigners of sabotage when
things didn’t come up to expectations.
Now it announces that the excess of “in-
ferior goods” is due to the “incompet-
ence, ignorance and listlessness” of the
moujik himself.
There is a movement afoot to make
the office of Lord Mayor in Melbourne
more of an automatic affair even that it
is at present. Some councillors propose
that the elected one should wear the
bunny skins for a single year and that
the successive candidates for the next
three years should be unofficially
selected in advance, so that aspirants
should know where they are, so to speak,
and others should not cherish idle
dreams. No provision is suggested for
the possibility of some Bumble arising
with unsuspected capacity for wearing
the civic purple with distinction and for
the public benefit, such as energy, enter-
prise and originality. Apparently the
idea is that any sort of rubber will make
a good enough stamp.
Brisbane City Council is reducing the
general rate for the six months to June
30 by a ha’penny in the pound, making
it 44d. It will have to face the electors
in May.
Rain has seriously affected the quality
of Victorian tomatoes. This news will
be received with satisfaction by econom-
ists of the Roosevelt school, who advo-
cate limitation of production as the cure
for under-consumption.
Blue shirts fought grey shirts at Cork
last week. In Germany there are brown
shirts, in Italy black shirts, in Russia red
shirts, in England green shirts (Douglas-
ites sport them) and in Canton pink
shirts. The next country that sets out to
solve its problems by getting shirty will
need to have striped shirts.
Oldham, M.L.A., to a Victorian meet-
ing:
I have been amazed at the airy manner in
which public finances are handled in Parlia-
ment. When 1 see the millions whizzing by
1 feel as though I should be doing some good
if 1 could only stop a little.
So do other members —they like the
“little” to stop in their own constituen-
cies. So long as they can get plenty of
new post offices, schools, culverts, cement
footpaths and jobs they don’t care how
much stops or how extravagantly it stops.
This largely is the keynote of Australian
Government finance.
Scullin told a meeting at Port Mel-
bourne that “when Labor is again re-
turned to power” it must start nationali-
sation of banking from the point where
Andrew Fisher left off in 1913. He said
that “nationalisation of banking was the
greatest step towards securing stability”
and “that had my Government passed its
• fiduciary policy there would have been
150,000 fewer people unemployed in Aus-
tralia to-day.” Perhaps. But those dead
of hunger don’t need work.
The poor old Celestial Republic has
never had a fair chance. It had no
sooner turned out the Manchus than the
world’s munitioneers began selling its vic-
torious generals the sinews of war. Dur-
ing the European shindy there was con-
tinuous fighting in China, and afterwards
civil war became a habit. Nevertheless,
the Republic performed remarkable
colonising work in Manchuria, and might
have settled down if the Russians had
not started to Bolshevise it and the Japs
had not seized Manchuria. Now it has a
fresh civil war in the south and six pro-
vinces are Communist.
The P.M.G.’s department has hit on a
novel idea. It suggests that people should
make Christmas presents to their enemies
of departmental telephones and engages
to instal the gadgets by Christmas.
The Treasurer may now offer to instal
adding and subtracting machines in the
homes of taxpayers. There are all sorts
of possibilities in the notion.
Maoriland has a financial reformer:
The Auditor-General, in his latest annual
report, makes drastic comments on the coun-
try’s accounts. He refers particularly to
‘‘errors and deficiences” in Native Lands, men-
tions “grave irregularities” and “extravagant
methods” and complains that “no proper re-
cords of many important transactions” have
been kept. In regard to the surplus exchange
compensation fund, he says that £5,900,000 of
the credit provided has been used to meet ordin-
ary revenue account charges. As if the Auditor-
General’s acid comments weren’t enough, the
National Expenditure Commission has reported
that the Dominion’s civil service superannua-
tion fund is actuarially unsound to the extent
of £23,000,000, and that last year one branch
of it provided for a deficiency of £106,524 and
another for a deficiency of £120,928 by realis-
ing assets (mostly Government securities).
Dcwnie Stewart must be thanking his lucky
stars that a Presbyterian conscience impelled
him to resign rather than give the exchange
boost his blessing.

F. R. Jordan, K.C., who becomes Chief
Justice of N.S.W. at 52, is another Equity
man with a fine record and a merry
twinkle in his eye. The Bar acknowledges
his eminence both in knowledge and in
court technique ; and he has the faculty
of reducing the most complicated argu-
ment to its basic simplicity. Like other
leading members of the Bar Mr. Jordan
was brought up in Balmain and passed
through Sydney High School. He joined
the public service, was an evening stu-
dent in the Law Faculty, tied with Ted
Real, of Brisbane, for the Wigram Allen
scholarship, became in time an examiner
in the Law School and Challis lecturer
in Equity, Company Law, Bankruptcy,
Probate and Divorce. He is a fine lin-
guist and a sound classical scholar. He
has been 26 years at the Bar and took
silk in 1928.
Each year the ranks of the Boer War
veterans’ parade in Perth thin out, but
there is still a goodly company able to
answer the roll-call. This year W. W.
Berry was in his accustomed place, and
his “Present, sir!” rang out firm and
clear. Berry’s first engagement was in the
Zulu War of 1879, and he took part in
the first Boer War in 1880-81. He came
to Australia in 1885.
The arrival of Captain H. E. Adkins
under the auspices of the A.B.C. ought
to start a revival of cornet-playing in
every suburb on the continent. Adkins
was the youngest director the Royal Mili-
tary School of Music ever had. He trains
every army bandmaster in England and
is the author of a standard work on his
subject. He has done more than any
other man to make the military band a
second cousin to the highbrow orchestra,
and he will have 40 Australian players
under him, using more than the usual
variety of instruments and playing con-
certos and symphonic works.
Few men are better known than Phil
Finkelstein, and few newspaper readers
have not read his opinions on actors and
actresses —without knowing it. Phil is the
Firm’s publicity man in Melbourne. In
turn law student, journalist, camel-trans-
port officer —he was once with a big trad-
ing concern in the interior —and the
youngest special correspondent with the
present King and Queen during their tour
PHIL FINKELSTEIN, “the Firm’s”
Herald of Greatness.
of Australia, he has seen most parts of
the Commonwealth. Jimmie Scullin suc-
ceeded him on the Ballarat “Evening
Echo” and “Smiler” Hales on the “Bar-
rier Miner.” While dramatic critic on
the “Sunday Times” in Sydney, he caught
the eye of Clive Meynell, who offered him
his present job. When he retires, but not
before, he intends to write a book of
theatrical reminiscences.
William Anstey Wynes has probabiy
put up an Australian record by becoming
a Doctor of Laws at 25. He graduated
LL.B. at Adelaide in 1929 with first-
class honors in three subjects and the
David Murray scholarship. The first
honors degree ever given in law at Adel-
aide came his way in 1931, and he has
now won, with his doctorate, the Bony-
thon prize for a thesis on the Common-
wealth Constitution, on which he has
spent three years’ study. He is a mem-
ber of a private committee which is assist-
ing the S.A. Government to prepare a
case on possible amendments to the Con-
stitution.
Alderman J. R. CAIN, Adelaide’s new
Lord Mayor.
R. T. Foster, who has gone to Bris-
bane to edit the “Courier-Mail,” is fresh
from London, where he has been editor
of Australian cable services for the past
five years. He is in his early forties.
No cricketer was ever so proud of his
first century as George Harding, Dun-
wich (Q.). Five sovereigns have occupied
the British throne in his lifetime. He
vividly recalls the Duke of Wellington’s
funeral in 1852 and the U.S. Civil War.
Born near Windsor Castle, he spent his
early days near Mitcham, the perfume
centre; he left England for Australia
at the time of the Crimean War. He met
with a prospecting accident at 92 and
since then has been a Dunwich inmate.
A Melburnian who saved shipowners
millions of pounds died in England the
other day—Elliott Cumberland, who in-
vented a method of stopping a bane
of the electrical engineer, corrosion due
to electrolytic action when metals come
in contact with water, especially sea-
water. The navies of half a dozen Great
Powers adopted it, and Cumberland made
such a lot of money that he acquired
a lease of Coombe Hill Golf Club, Surrey,
where he built a Japanese garden cost-
ing £5OOO. He was a friend of the Prince
of Wales through their mutual interest in
golf, and he paid a solemn tribute to the
game by decreeing that his ashes should
be scattered on the ninth green at
Coombe.
Colonel R. C. Holman, of Sydney, who
reported for duty at the Pearly Gates last
week at 72, was one of the “characters”
of the Australian military forces. An old
Imperial regular, he came to N.S.W. in
the 1880’s, after serving with Warren in
Bechuanaland. He joined the N.S.W.
instructional staff and left for the Boer
War as R.S.M. of the Ist N.S.W.M.R.
After collecting a D.C.M., he transferred
to the 2nd M.R. as lieutenant and adju-
tant and was awarded the D.S.O.
On his return to Australia the C.M.F.
instructional staff naturally took him
to its bosom. As* an instructor of
mounted troops Holman had no peer in
Australia. It is safe so say that every L.H.
officer from brass-hats to junior subal-
terns who left with the A.I.F. had at one
time or another quailed under his steely
eye or flushed at his frank and personal
criticism. Yet, to the man who knew his
work or tried his hardest to know it,
Holman offered every help and assist-
ance. It was the slacker and the shirker
who had a sticky time when Dicky was
on the warpath.
G. R. Laffer, dead (suddenly, in his
garden) at Blackwood (S.A.) at 67, had
been M.H.A. for 20 years. A hard
worker, he was Chairman of Committees
in Peake’s time, held the Crown Lands
portfolio under Barwell —which included
the heavy Repatriation work of 1920-24
—and then had some years in the
Speaker’s chair.
Just retired after 50 years of letter-
handling, Asst. Mail Supt. W. Smith, of
the Melbourne G.P.O. He started as a
messenger, delivered letters in Hawthorn
when that now-aristocratic suburb was
mostly paddock and post-and-rail fence,
went to Maryborough, and returned to
Melbourne 27 years ago. He just
missed the rush of this year’s Christmas
mail. He reckons that the strangest pack-
age he ever handled was a packet of
safety razor-blades wrapped loosely in a
pound note for an envelope.
An old acquaintance goes:
There is a definite niche waiting in Heaven
for Edward (“Better Not”) Wallington. Apart
from his registrarship of the League of Mercy
and his social position he is cut out by nature
for the job of aide-de-camp to the Keeper
of the Golden Gates, and his discreet customary
deterrent phrase, whispered in the ear of that
functionary, who must be a bit tired after his
several thousands of years on the job, will
save a lot of unworthy citizens and bad musi-
cians from acquiring harps. The old man—
he was 79—had a long association with Aus-
tralia. He was private secretary to Carrington
in N. S. Wales in the ’eighties, secretary of
the Melbourne Club for a year, and succes-
sively P.S. to Hopetoun and Brassey, Governors
of Victoria, and to Buxton and Tennyson in
S.A. Then Wallington went back to his Hope-
toun, who had become Marquess of Linlith-
gow and first Governor-General of the Common-
wealth, and was first clerk to the Federal
Executive Council. Tennyson kept him when
Linlithgow went, but in 1903, after 20 years
in the Antipodes, he retired to London, where
he became successively groom-in-waiting in
the Prince of Wales and to the King, and
then the Queen’s private secretary. Last year
he retired from the job to a less arduous one.
He,was a fine athlete in his day, playing cricket
for Oxford, and he captained the N. S. Wales
tennis team in 1887.
Dom Stephen Moreno spent years mak-
ing music for the monks of the New
Norcia mission (W.A.), founded by
Bishop Salvado, himself a musician. Now

He has written a host of well-known
church compositions, and his work at
New Norcia made him famous.
H. W. Segar is a Lancastrian, but he
has been Professor of Mathematics at
Auckland almost since the days of the
great auk —for 40 years to be exact. He
should be able to add two and two, be-
cause he was second wrangler at Cam-
bridge, and he should be able to lecture,
because he was apprenticed to the pro-
fessorial business at Aberystwyth, in
Wales, where they expect even the pons
asinorum to be dished up in a flight of

Mathematics, Auckland University.
oratory. In Auckland he has been almost
everything educational that a professor
can be—president of the erudite N.Z. and
Auckland Institutes, member of the N.Z.
University Senate, chairman of the
Board of Studies and of the Academic
Board and (for six years) of the W.E.A.
and president of Auckland Rotary. But
through it all he remains a Liverpudlian
in essence and finds time for bowls and
music when the binomial theorem and
the fourth dimension pall.
W. H. Twiss becomes Federal Presi-
dent of the Australian Institute of Secre-
taries, and he certainly has enough ex-
perience to see him through the job,
having been secretary of the S.A. Dried
Fruits Board since its inception. For-
merly he was secretary of the Dairy
Produce Board, which was disbanded in
1921. Once he was in the S.A. Audit
Department.
S.A. thinks it may have a Rhodes
scholar out of the common in A. P.
Guinand (of Renmark, St. Peter’s and
St. Mark’s); Prof. Wilton says he is “the
most outstanding mathematician I have
handled either at Sheffield or in Adel-
aide.” With the honors B.Sc. at 21,
Guinand proposes research in “philo-
sophical and symbolic mathematics and
relativity” at Oxford. His athletics take
the unusual form of bicycle-racing.
John Murray Crawford, M.1.E.E.,
M.I.F. (Aust.), is a sort of living history
of Australian communications in the last
three decades. Born at Liverpool (Eng.)
in 1871, he was trained by the British
P.O. and was in charge of telegraphy
arrangements at the coronations of King
Edward and King George. In 1912 he
landed a job in the P.M.G.’s Department,
and later served as State engineer for
both Victoria and N.S.W. He repre-
sented the Commonwealth Government
at the International Electrical Congress
at Paris in 1932 and the Radio and Tele-
graph barney at Madrid in the same year.
As chief engineer of the P.M.G.’s De-
partment and chairman of the Vic. divi-
sion of the Aust. Institute of Engineers
he has a big influence electrically.

The co. is the world’s largest wool-seller,
and it does an extensive merchandise,
shipping and general-agency business as
well. Headquarters are in London, and
there is a branch in Kenya, East Africa,
but most of the business, which is
financed largely on cheap debenture
money, is done in Australia and Maori-
land. The visible improvement in last
year’s net result was due mainly to a
lighter charge for exchange—£6l,9oB as
against £175,177 in the previous term.
These charges have been met by trans-
fers from the contingency fund, which
is lumped with sundry creditors in the
sheet.

the hammer, and the average price was

Excluding exchange, salaries, etc., were
£9649 heavier; the Australian tax bill
(£38,399) was £9998 lighter, and the
British one (£10,856) shrank £l9lB. After
deducting £lO,OOO sent to the staff fund,,
the profit (£13,530) was little more than
half the pref. div. Still, an all-round 5
p.c. was distributed, though the visible
lay-by had to be tapped for £24,562 to
do it.
The market, encouraged by the change
in the outlook for wool, prices the £2O
shares paid to £5 at £lO 2s. 6d. as against
£8 10s. a year ago. In Australian cur-
rency, and with exchange as it is, the
return at £lO 2s. 6d. is 3.1 p.c. on a 5 p.c.
div. basis, or 4.9 p.c. on an 8 p.c. distri-
bution. In 1929 the co. paid 17 p.c.
with wool averaging £2l 10s. lid. in
Australia. For the five months to the
end of November last, the average was
£lB 15s. 2d. Whether the cautious board
will lift the div. beyond 5 p.c. for the
current term depends largely upon the
extent to which it may decide to further
strengthen the co.’s shock absorbers.
The next table shows how well ribbed
the co. is financially:

It was the plunge into the international
whirlpool of war-time marine business
that brought this 21-year-old into the
limelight. In its first half-dozen years
premium income mounted to over a mil-
lion, and reserves approaching three-
quarters of a million had accumu-
lated. But marine underwriting is a
long-winded business, and much of what
looked like profits turned out to be losses.
These, the special demands of the tax-
gatherer and adjustment of the book
value of securities swallowed over half a
million of reserves during the five years
to the close of accounts in 1925, and the
management has not since met with
much luck in its efforts to develop other
lines.
The Accident branch has given most
trouble, due to the unsatisfactory nature
of motor-car insurance, including elabor-
ate extensions of third-party cover. Here
the co. paid out in claims and exes.
£148,454 more than it received in pre-
miums during the five years to the middle
of 1932. Hence the bare patches for
shareholders, notwithstanding that re-
serves are over three times greater than
paid capital (£100,000), and that the lot
is invested mainly in mortgages, deben-
tures and public securities.
How things panned out in the various
departments during the last term these
figures show:
Net

With the Accident business on a more
even keel, and with enough from invest-
ments alone to show 8.4 p.c. on capital,
prospects of shareholders getting a bit
better than 5 p.c. appear to be encour-
aging.
Everything, however, depends upon
underwriting performances. Combining
the figures of the three departments we

Claims are the trouble. Though the
position in this respect is improving,
doubt is whether much in the way of
underwriting surpluses can be expected
while reinsurances bulk largely in pre-
mium income.

The present co. took over the scattered
Gordon and Gotch businesses about 15
years ago. The Maoriland section was
put on a better footing, the organisation
generally was tightened, the div. climbed
from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. in March,
1927, and a 2\ p.c. sweetener was added
18 months later. Then slump lightened
turnover and complicated the debts
problem, while exchange and primage
bumped up the cost of imported litera-
ture, and for a while it looked as though
8 p.c. might prove to be beyond the co.’s
reach. Still, by weeding out dead lines,
livening others, stopping up outlets and
strengthening the finances, the manage-
ment got the business into, splendid trim
for difficult trading. Since the tide
turned and the Government gave the co.
a little relief by removing the primage
on imported books, etc., the figures have
responded nicely.
For the 12 months to Sept. 30, the
spring in gross earnings (£108,127) was
£20,507. Exes. (£51,169) took £9349 of
the increase, leaving enough to pay the
pref. div. and then show 9.7 p.c. on the
half-million of ord. capital as against 7.5,
8.8, 13.3, 18.9 and 17.4 p.c. back to 1928.
Though the div. was kept at 8 p.c., the
market lengthened its bid for the ords.
to 40s. as against 345. 6d. in June, and
265. 12 months before that. The return
at 40s. is 4 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.
The prefs. at 335. 6d. yield 4.8 p.c. All
shares rank equally for capital, the cover
being 255. in net tangibles.
As stocks and debtors’ balances have
been worked down the debt has
been reduced and investments and cash

was wiped out, the amount coming t 0
sundry creditors was reduced by £12,076
and £44,228 was added to investments,
etc. The year’s improvement in the

cluding stocks) was £22,109.

Last season’s Australian output of canned
peaches, pears and apricots reached the
record figure of over four million dozen
cans ; for the two preceding seasons the
figures were 2.3 million dozen and 1.7
million dozen respectively. Local con-
sumption, which exceeded two million
dozen cans in ’29, and dropped to 888
thousand dozen in ’32, is estimated at
about 1.5 million dozen for the last sea-
son. The export trade absorbed the bal-
ance. Here foreign competitors are able
to undersell Australian producers, despite
the advantages of the Ottawa agreement,
owing to (1) price-fixing by a quasi Gov-
ernment board, and (2) depreciation of
the dollar. This and the recent weak-
ness in overseas markets have led to an
accumulation of stocks, followed by
price-cutting, locally.
Hence the shrinkage of £ll,OBl in this
well-handled concern’s gross earnings
during the last term:

Including an unexplained addition of

show 7.5 p.c. on capital as against 9.2,
6.9, 10, 16.3, 10.3 and 20.6 p.c. back
to 1927. The policy has been to dis-
tribute profits as they were earned, so
a point was chipped off the div., reduc-
ing it to 7 p.c., making the average over
the last decade 10.3 p.c.

Bourke-street retailer of high-class soft-
goods has grappled successfully with the
new trading problems. Slump, exchange,
the tariff and primage made a number
of imported lines unprofitable, and the
company now buys two-thirds or more
of its merchandise locally as against a
former 20 p.c. The loss of £24,622 in
’3l was the first thing of its kind the co.
had experienced since the collapse of
trade following the bank crashes of the
early ’nineties. Apparently a clean sweep
was made of stocks, now said to be of
the newest, and as prices steadied and
conditions generally improved profit-
earning capacity began to develop again.
During the last term the main premises
were remodelled, two new floors were
added, and four modern lifts were in-
stalled. Also, the old Wertheim premises,
bought in ’29, have been reconstructed
and opened as a men’s store, the three top
floors being connected with the co.’s main
building. It all caused a certain amount
of dislocation, of course. Still, after
handing the prefs. their £10,500, there
was enough to show 6.1 p.c. on ord.
capital, and 6 p.c. was distributed. The
ords., which were passed by in the pre-
vious term, averaged 13.1 p.c., sweetened
with £133,211 of bonus scrip, for the
decade to the close of accounts in 1930.
Over the same period extensions and
additions to premises and plant added
£295,217 net to the book value of fixed
assets, while the net growth in the debt
was £93,093:

Last term £33,258 was added to the book
value of stocks, £BBO4 to premises, etc.,
and £9914 net to the debt, which includes
mortgages totalling £118,400. The more
or less liquid surplus (£67,966, including
stocks) was £3758 stronger than at the
previous balance.
After sales at 255. 6d., sellers ask 30s.
for the ords. as against par a year ago.
At 275. 9d. the return would be 4.3 p.c.
on a 6 p.c. div. basis, with prospects.
The prefs. at 255. 6d. return 5.5 p.c. The
net tangible cover is £3 12s. lid. prefs.
and 245. 6d. ords.
In July last the zinc cartel increased
the production quota of its members
from 45 p.c. to 50 p.c. of plant capacity.
The aggregate average monthly output
of the metal was then little in excess of
54,000 tons, and the average London spot
quote was £l7 15s. 9d. per ton. For
September the output was over 56,000
tons, the price was £l6 18s. 6d., and
stocks, which were 125,478 tons in
August, had risen to 129,061 tons. It is
therefore proposed to reduce quotas to
45 p.c. again, and to increase the penal-
ties for exceeding the quota.' By arrange-
ment with other members of the cartel,
Electrolytic Zinc has been able to main-
tain practically full-scale production at
Risdon, and it has had no difficulty in
selling its output. Last week-end the
London spot price for spelter was £l4
17s. 6d., with a tendency to strengthen.

At Tennant’s Creek, Centralia, appear-
ances are that the goldfield extends into
the abo. reserve. Geologically the
field consists of broken range country,
running for about 20 miles east and west,
with slates and shale standing on edge
and dipping at steep angles. Thus far,
most of the finds have been made by
cutting the cap of ironstone outcrops.
Whether the lodes and the gold live at
depth remains to be proved. The amount
of work done to date does not justify the
high prices asked for some options. The
general opinion of half a dozen geologists
who recently visited the place is that the
field shows promise, though costs are
high, and water has to be carted over
five miles from the Government well.
Gympie may have a dredging proposi-
tion along that portion of the Mary
River which drained the Monkland and
Smithfield outcrops. Values quoted for
two bores by the holding syndicate are
more than payable. But that doesn’t
mean much, except that it may serve
the purpose of raising capital for sys-
tematically boring a wider area, on
the results of which the proposition must
depend. If gold in payable quantities
was carried down for a mile or so from
its sources, it wpuld be as much as could
be expected. The contention that the
river bed may carry up to five million
ounces is not supported by any tan-
gible evidence, and for the present it
can be left at that. In the past opera-
tions were not conspicuously success-
ful, though it can fairly be said that the
area was not dealt with on systematic
lines.

The Woolgar goldfield (N.Q.), a
minor one a generation back, is now
being given a very fair trial, but results
so far are nothing to write home about.
Commonwealth Mines Syndicate is
mainly trying out surface stuff, though
several reefs outside of this are being
worked. The Roman Crown is showing
a heavily-mineralised 2ft. reef at 75ft.,
carrying loz. to the ton. The pilot bat-
tery erected by the Mines Department
will not look at this, but it is doing use-
ful work on oxidised ore, 65 tons of
which returned 420 z.

Towers (N.Q.), is growing in favor,
though there has been the usual crop of
duds. At the Big Shine, values have been
tested to a depth of about 150 ft., and
are still holding. Silaya’s October crush-
ing at the Pioneer Mill gave 1590 z. from
36 tons, and the total clean-up should
average £3O per ton —sands and concen-
trates to come.
* * * *
Batavia, Cape York Peninsula, is rush-
ing crushings through before the heavy
rain begins, when those working the lead
must perforce stand by. Frank Delaney’s
Double Chance, which responds when-
ever called upon, heads the list with 50
tons of firsts for 150 oz. of gold, while
80 tons of seconds averaged 22dwt. ; the
Black Cat returned 420 z. from six tons ;
for the rest of the field returns are at the
rate of a few pennyweights only—pay-
able, of course, for a shallow lead worked
at low cost. Reefing hasn’t yet made
much headway, though local inhabitants
look to it to carry the field along, since
the lead is showing some signs of ex-
haustion. The field returned 4570 z. for
October, the last monthly figures to hand.
* * * *
Golden Mile, Cracow (Q.), has met
with treatment difficulties in the shape
of colloidal slime, which has lowered the
gold recovery of the treatment plant. To
November 10 the mill crushed 2070 tons
of ore for 9860 z. of bullion; the assay
value of 1135 tons of slimes was 586 fine
oz., and of 950 tons of sands, 234 fine
oz. To overcome the trouble a filtra-
tion plant is being installed ; also, the
capacity of the mill and the dam is to
be increased, and everything is expected
to be ready for a fresh start at the end
of January. Early in September debtors
and cash totalled £3640 ; there was £8482
coming to creditors.

Early in the new year the Tasmanian
Government will make a mineral sur-
vey of the area between Mt. Balfour and
Mt. Bischoff. Recently some promising
tin finds were made around Mt. Balfour,
where transport and other difficulties
have hitherto stood in the way of work-
ing the deposits on a large scale. If
prospects are considered good enough,
the Government intends to build a road
into this area.
* * * *
South Aus. has never been much of
a gold producer. The total value of the
output for 82 years to the end of 1932
was £1,666,339. The Government runs
four batteries and cyaniding works, of
which the one at Mongolata put up the
best performance for the first half of
1933. It crushed 14 parcels aggregating
743 tons for 9540 z. of bullion, worth
£3833, an average of £5 3s. per ton. At
Peterborough a parcel of 7 tons 15cwt.
from the Great Northern, at Tennant’s
Creek, Centralia, yielded 290 z. 3dwt. of
gold, worth £l2l, or £l5 12s. per ton.
* * * *
Westralia’s gold yield for 1933 will
probably be worth £5,000,000 in Aus-
tralian currency, of which nearly 2} mil-
lions will represent premium. Next year’s
output may be worth substantially more,
as Great Boulder, North Kalgurli, Per-
severance, Lake View and Wiluna will
all treat bigger tonnages, and other mills,
together with State extraction plants,
are likely to be more fully employed.
* * * *
From London: Joe Thorn, Westralian
boss of Lake View and Star, was wined
and dined by the board prior to his
return to Kalgoorlie via America. Before
Thorn took charge, said chairman
Agnew, he was warned that eight million
ounces had already been extracted from
the show, and that its workings were a
mere shell. Still, Thorn tackled the job,
and spent £24,000 on underground equip-
ment, with the result that about 45,000
tons of ore is being profitably treated
each month. Thorn declared that Agnew
was the brain, and that he merely fol-
lowed instructions. He believes that the
Lake View will be a big profit-earner
long after those present have ceased to
worry about gold-mining. Recently addi-
tions were made to the plant, lifting
the capacity to 50,000 tons a month.

Beryl Gold Mines, whose issued
capital is held by Anglo-Australian
Development, has bored through sft. of
ore assaying 14dwt. gold and 3 p.c.
copper in its Kundip leases, Phillips
River field (W.A.). Another drill is ex-
pected to show equal, or better, results.
The values mentioned are about equal to
the average returns obtained by cos.
which formerly operated in the locality.
The Anglo-Australian Co. was floated
by Claude de Bernales and others in
London early this year, and has several
other subsidiaries interested in Westralian
gold ventures.
* * * *
Western Mining Corp., which holds an
option over several of the Tindals’ leases,
as well as the Big Blow, Coolgardie
(W.A.), has secured another reservation
of 500 acres near by. On Tindals’ Cen-
tral and Big Blow two bores are being
sunk, both of which are to go down to
1000 ft. or thereabouts, incline 1 in 10.
The Big Blow, worked by opencut to a
depth of 150 ft., has yielded 42,000 tons
of 9dwt. stuff; Tindals’ Central has pro-
duced 35,000 tons of similar grade.
* * * *
The New Venture Co., in which some
Malayan tin concerns are interested, has
installed a new Cornish pump, boiler and
winding gear at the Redemption, Cool-
gardie (W.A.). The water from the pro-
perty, which has been opened up to a
depth of 280 ft. on a continuation of
Bayley’s line of lode, will be used for
the Huntingdon mill on the Brilliant, also
under option to the co. Altogether the
co. has nine leases in the district, includ-
ing the Cosgrove and King’s Cross, both
of which are being developed.
* * * *
Dolph Agnew, son of J. A. Agnew, has
taken options over a number of leases
around Ora Banda (W.A.). These in-
clude the Victorious, Gimlet South and
Mopoke. Victorious is credited with a
production worth £750,000, the Gimlet
South with £500,000, and the Mopoke
with a few thousands. With gold around
its present price all appear to have a
good chance.
* # * *
Paringa (W.A.) has decided to resume
where it left off years ago. Encouraging
results from recent diamond drilling are
said to have induced the board to let a
contract to re-equip the main south shaft
of the co.’s Kalgoorlie property, and
the workings are to be reopened and
further developed.
*** , i *
In view of a favorable report, backed
by a trial crushing of 25 tons from
various sections on the 180 ft. level, the
Yilgarn Co. has exercised its option over
the Banker on the Yilgarn goldfield
(W.A.). Here the danger is that refrac-
tory ore may give trouble when the co.
breaks new ground at depth.
* * * *
From the Salvation Syndicate’s lease
at Ora Banda (W.A.), over which Great
Boulder Prop, recently relinquished its
option, 150 tons has been crushed for
130 oz. over the plates, with 12dwt. in the
sands. In all 1237 tons has been treated
in the last two years for £14,480. A
scheme for the amalgamation of this
claim with the Ora Banda, Wentworth
and Dundas has been proposed in
Adelaide.
* * * *
A trial parcel of 50 tons from the old
Kapia, at the northern end of the Kal-
goorlie, near B.H.P.’s Hannan’s North
Extended, has averaged 12dwt. The ore,
taken from a dump, came originally from
below water-level. The New Venture
Co. has taken a two years’ free option
over the show. The purchase price is
£lO,OOO cash, plus £5OOO £1 paids in any
co. formed to work the property.

Melawi Gold Syndicate, in which
Orimo Explorations is interested, has
been formed to prospect 133,000 acres of
alluvial on the Melawi River, Dutch West
Borneo.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What would be the annual cost for male and
female respectively, each 21 years old. to buy
from the A.M.P. annuities of £52 p.a. and £45
10s. p.a., commencing after the age of 60 and
657—9437.
Age last Starting

The annuity would commence after expiration
of 39 years or 44 years, as the case might be,
and continue until the quarter-day preceding
the death of the annuitant. In the event of
death before the annuity is entered upon, all
premiums paid would be refunded. If pre-
miums are not to be refunded in case of death
the annual charge would be somewhat less.
In addition to the premiums mentioned, stamp
duty is required at the rate of 15s. for each
£lOO or part thereof of the present value of
the total premiums payable.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
J.C.S.: Communicate with the Warden,
Charters Towers, who is also the Warden for
the Ravenswood field... .T.G.A.: Don’t....
J.A.H.: Will review in our next issue W.S.:
(1) There are no fields from which black opal
has been produced outside Australia. (2) Opal
valued at approximately £429,800 has been
produced at Lightning Ridge. (3) Information
not available. Mr. Percy Marks, Hunter-street,
Sydney, might be able to help J.W.: (1)
Newcastle Hunter River Steam, Walkerville Co-
op. Brewing, Buckley and Nunn and R. H.
Gordon are worth consideration. (2) A rise
of a few shilling is quite likely within the next
12 months.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“The Stickpin,” at the State, is an
Anglo-American thriller with a splendid
cast.
The somewhat thin plot concerns a
blackmailer who gets hold of the hero-
ine’s compromising letters. Her husband
is a London editor, and their best friend
is a safe-manufacturer who can open
any of his firm’s safes. He burgles the
blackmailer’s house and takes the letters,
unknowing that the husband is waiting
behind a curtain with a revolver. Next
day the papers announce that the black-
mailer has been shot. The husband knew
about his wife’s indiscretion all along,
and exterminated her persecutor to save
her from worry. A super-husband and
a super-friend!
Francis Sullivan, who plays the black-
mailer —a sort of large, flaccid Count
Fosco who hates mankind and loves
birds—is an artist, and his articulation
and voice are delightful. The husband
(Lawrence Anderson) is like a London
editor in appearance, voice and ways, and
the members of his staff are like Lon-
don journalists. There isn’t an illiterate
yahoo, a bellowing neurotic or a dipso-
maniac on the paper—a change from
Flollywood conventions. The heroine and
the safe expert are good, too.
“Paddy the Next Best Thing” is one
of the silliest productions on record.
Warner Baxter arrives at a primitive Irish
fishing-village in a speedboat. Janet
Gaynor’s father, who is so hard up that
he has to borrow small change from
Baxter, lives in a cross between a Holly-
wood villa and an Elizabethan manor
house. The courtyards teem with blood-
hounds, grooms and thoroughbred
hunters. The elder daughter wears an
Ascot frock at a pig fair, and both girls
get into Paris confections for the inevit-
able ball.
The thing has no more continuity or
atmosphere than a vaudeville show. Some
of the turns are fairly good—the Irish
song in the ballroom, the wrangle be-
tween the pig-dealers, the imitation of it
which is given by Baxter and Janet—
but they have nothing to do with the
story. James Connolly, as the feckless,
blarneying father, is the redeeming
feature. He performs miracles: brings a
completely dead show to life each time
he appears.
* * *
“The Song You Gave Me,” at Sydney
Capitol, is yet another determined effort
to cash in on Vienna. That picturesque
city carries under its eaves so many
memories of great musicians and is so
proud of their citizenship that to associ-
ate with it the female crooner as repre-
sented by Bebe Daniels is something that
annoys every musical highbrow. But if
you were to ask the shades of Papa
Haydn, Frankie Schubert or either of the
Strausses whether they preferred the real
Vienna or the musicomedy version it’s a
safe bet they’d plump for the fairyland
they never knew. It is a land in which
musical talent of even the slightest pro-
portions is showered with gold.
Miss Daniels hasn’t much of a voice,
but she has mobile features. When these
are presented on the scale of Bft. by sft.
there isn’t a tremor of her eyelid that
lacks expression. As Mitzi, a Viennese
singer who plugs what sound like recent
products of Tin-pan Alley, she earns
wealth to a fabulous amount, and can
take her pick of an ex-ambassador (per-
petually soused), a millionaire (idiotic)
and an English lord so enlightened that
he dresses as nattily as any American.
Instead, she engages as secretary Victor
Varconi, because he was rude to her
when she was singing a song that would
have sickened a decently-educated cat. In
revenge Varconi produces a song (a little
thing of his own) calculated to turn the
stomach of a hyena, and after an hour
or so, during which she frequently sings
the song, he consents to marry her to
put an end to her importunities.
“Frontier Marshall,” on the same bill,
exhibits George O’Brien, in a wide-
brimmed hat, circumventing the knavish
tricks of a wicked mayor, winning the
love of the pure heroine and of another
lady who is anything but pure, and
demonstrating that murder will out.
The yarn has been told ten thousand
times before, but seldom so realistically
as in this movie.
“Broadway to Hollywood,” at the
Regent, is the lachrymose saga of three
generations of vaudevillians. Applause
follows the turns of Alice Brady and
Frank Morgan, and managers treat them
with respect. Next they are seen on the
down grade; but their son (Russell Hardie)
joins them and saves the situation. The
son forges ahead, is headlined, takes to
drink, drives his wife to suicide and dies
a hero’s death in France. Meanwhile
his aged parents have been supporting
his child (Eddie Quillan) to the best of
their ability. Eddie grows up, goes to
Hollywood, becomes a comedy star, gets
a swelled head, and takes to drink. At
this stage his doddering grandfather inter-
venes and saves him. The stupendous
feat causes the veteran to die of heart
failure in an excessively maudlin last
scene. The acting is uninspired.
In the other half Chefalo produces
poultry, rabbits, men, women and
enough assorted goods to stock a shop
window from a collection of seemingly
empty boxes. He also does amazing
things with cards. He is assisted by a
troupe of midgets. In addition to fetch-
ing and carrying for him, the midgets
stage a number of individual turns and a
small pantomime called “The Wedding
of the Painted Doll.”

Many historical facts are omitted from
“Henry VIII.,” which was privately
screened at Melbourne Athenasum last
week. Decency forbade them. But,
allowing for these omissions, the picture
is very good indeed.
• Photographically it gives the atmos-
phere of a barbarous court with what
seems amazing verisimilitude. Emotion-
ally it gives the character, too. Whether
SYDNEY TALKIES.
In “Paddy the Next
Best Thing,” at Sydney
State: (1) Warner Bax-
ter, (2) Janet Gaynor.
(3) Walter Connolly,
(4) Harvey Stephens.
In “The Stickpin" on the same bill:
(5) Francis Sullivan, ( 6 ) Henry Kendall.
there is any reason to suppose that Henry
was in the habit of tearing capons to
pieces with his teeth and throwing the
fragments over his shoulder present
critic doesn’t know, but one does get the
impression of an enormously vigorous
personality whose privileged position
gave him every encouragement to un-
bridle the passions which his courtiers
shared with him and would have liked
to unbridle, too.
By comparison with his courtiers Henry
is almost likeable, though, viewed sepa-
rately, he is a disgusting old reprobate.
The producer sentimentalises him in
places.
“Henry VIII.” will deserve all the
encouragement it can get, if only for the
beauty of the settings and Charles
Laughton’s robust, lifelike and humorous
portrayal of the king. Also, his make-up
is superb. Merle Oberon, the Tasmanian
girl, makes an attractive Anne Boleyn,
and Lady Tree is admirable as the nurse
who puts fertility charms under the pil-
lows of a succession of royal bridal beds.
Holbein’s portraits have evidently been
applied to for information concerning
some of the other characters, and the
whole production, to which the name of
Philip Lindsay, Norman’s youngest son,
is attached as technical director, is an
impressive tribute to British artistiy.
Sundry Shows
The Impressionist Theatre group, who
presented “Cyrano de Bergerac” at Syd-
ney Royal on Saturday night, had certain
advantages not often available to non-
professional organisations. The experi-
ence and technical resources of J. C.
Williamson, Ltd., were at their disposal
in the matter of settings; they had a
full-size stage (and at times a sizable
part of the auditorium) upon which
to manoeuvre, and an illustrated pro-
gramme which gave so much informa-
tion about Rostand’s long-nosed poet
and so conscientiously outlined the
points of the plot and the directions in
which humor and pathos were to be
looked for that the veriest lowbrow could
feel himself in some degree en rapport
with the proceedings. Scenery was fan-
tastic and lighting dim. Dr. Raoul Car-
damitis, who designed the scenes, scored
some effects well in keeping with the
unreality of the play. Rostand’s lines,
spoken in rhymed English (and the trans-
lation by no means inspired), would tax
the vigor and earnestness of an Irving, a
Bernhardt or a Thorndike. Delivered by
actors whose voices (heard from the
back of the circle, at all events) were
indistinct, whose inflections were mono-
tonous, whose gestures were mechanical
and who wore romantic raiment as if ill-
accustomed to such masquerade, the effect
was not impressive.
John Gould, who played Cyrano, gas-
conaded with considerable energy, but
his enthusiasm seemed forced. Adele
Quinn’s Roxane exhibited vivacity,
but some convention impelled her and
Cyrano, when conducting intimate con-
versations, to pace about the stage in
wide elliptic orbits, which seemed not
only unnatural but lacking in courtesy.
Bede Foster’s Rageneau and Wilfred
Blackett’s Comte de Guiche, comedy
character roles, raised but little merri-
ment. Patricia Cotton’s duenna might
have sparkled in a more congenial
setting.
However, it was a brave effort, and
the improvement in the stage manner of
some of the principals that was to be
noted as the night wore on gave promise
that at the conclusion of its five nights’
run the show will be several miles nearer
perfection.
* * *
Gregan McMahon made a welcome
appearance before a packed and appre-
ciative Garrick, Melbourne, last week.
“Old English” is a sure winner with
audiences of season-ticket holders. If
the play is a collection of the'familiar
Galsworthian stereotypes, the plot is
nevertheless interesting; and there is
something engaging in the spectacle of
a sturdy old gentleman, who has had a
gay youth and isn’t ashamed of it, did-
dling a rival shipping magnate out of
£6OOO in order to give his unlawful
descendant, a damsel of the deserving
Cinderella type, an annuity, especially
as the cheated magnate is an old skunk.
Sylvanus is a character right into
McMahon’s hands, whether he is infuri-
ating his lawful daughter, a vixenish old
maid, bulldozing a shareholders’ meeting,
or drinking himself to death to escape the
exposure of the fraud. The last scene,
where Sylvanus mixes sherry, port and
brandy in one final burst, presents
McMahon at his histrionic best. Others
in the cast were Frederick Drew as a
villainous legal gent; Keith Johns as an
exceedingly innocuous Bob Pillin ; Ruby
May as Rosamund Larne ; Lynette Dick-
enson as her too-girlish daughter; and
Norma Gunn, excellent as the waspish
Adela Heythorp. Thomas Skewes, as
a shareholder with a grievance, was, as
usual, the painter of a perfect little minia-
ture, and Joan Lang, as a maid-of-all-
work, was the low-comedy irrelevance
without which no Galsworthy drama is
complete.
* * *
One of the worthiest performances of
“The Messiah” Sydney has listened to
was given at the Town Hall on Satur-
day. Hector Fleming’s baton took the
Welsh Choral Society singers through
some of the choruses at a more rapid
pace than George Friedrich would have
approved, if old traditions be sound, but
the 600 voices were very well balanced
and there were some grand harmonies.
The soloists—Mollie de Gunst, Nance
Marley, Raymond Beatty and Lionello
Cecil—gave, speaking generally, adequate
readings of their respective arias.
There was a full house at Sydney
Savoy on Saturday to cheer Doris
Fitton’s presentation of Barrie’s “Peter
Pan.” In placing the elaborate fantasy
on a small stage the Independents faced
many handicaps, but most of these were
cleverly overcome. Settings were admir-
able, and the players could be heard with
ease all over the house. Anne Gordon
played the title-role in a delightful
manner, Marguerite Cullen-Ward made
an appealing Wendy, and Pauline Hen-
riques (John) and Pamela Linton
(Michael) were ' well cast as her two
young brothers. O. D. Bisset and Jane
Conolly, as Mr. and Mrs. Darling, were
both in the picture. Alfred Race made a
bloodcurdling pirate captain, and Peter
Lightfoot was comical as the captain’s
offsider who filled his spare moments
doing needlework. Gertrude Johns, who
spent most of her time on all fours as
the faithful dog, was another asset to the
production. The music was composed
by Howard Carr, who conducted the
orchestra. “Peter Pan” will be presented
again to-night, next Saturday evening
and at a matinee on Boxing Day.
* * *
The A.B.C. put “Traviata” on the
ether one night last week and made a
very fair job of it. Dorothy d’Orn
realised the pathos of Violetta’s third-act
music, Lionello Cecil gave that poor fish
Alfred a tincture of masculine dignity he
doesn’t deserve, and Franco Izal, as papa
Germont, exuded sentiment and sym-
pathy. The chorus appeared to be enjoy-
ing itself, particularly in the rollicking
drinking-song, and the orchestra, under
Wando Aldrovandi’s baton, purveyed
spice as well as sugar.
* * ¥
Adelaide shows are very various. A
Nativity play at Stow Church is the
most unusual. Dante’s magic at the
Tivoli is so successful that the season has
to be extended ; he has all the old tricks
and more, and is a better personal show-
man than ever. The Players’ Guild put
up, an evening of Gilbert Murray and
the Greeks, with Charles Jury and Pat-
ricia Hackett prominent. The Royal
stages “The Blue Bird,” with local music
by Horace Perkins, and a host of bright
youngsters reinforced by Harkness and
Kester Baruch. Also cramming the
Royal is a ’Varsity rag, with Dawe and
John Duncan prominent in the clever
fooling.

Sydney’s theatrical outlook for the
Christmas season is bleak. “The Student
Prince” (another of those revivals) comes
to the Royal on Saturday; a “second
edition” of “Tout Paris” is offered by the
Cri. on the same evening, and it will hold
that fort till Boxing Day, when Mr.
Rolls will intermittently present the
romantic story of Sir R. Whittington, a
former Lud Mayor o’ Lunnon.
* * *
Harry Thurston will Old Bill it at
Melb. Tiv. until Thursday, whereupon
Frank Neil will present Fred Miller, who
hails from Lunnon, in “The Spice of
Life.” Another ingredient of “The Spice
of Life” will be Millie Deane. Another
sample of the art of Mr. Neil will be the
“Cinderella” panto, at the Palace. The
booking office for “Collit’s Inn,” the all-
Australian musical comedy at the Prin-
cess, is being rushed, it is said, and since
Gladys Moncrieff, Robert Chisholm,
George Wallace and Claude Flemming
are in the cast, the statement may be
accepted without reserve. The first hear-
ing of “Gay Divorce” is down for Satur-
day at the King’s.

“Dai R.”: Choom had come straight
from the ship to the back o’ Bourkc
on book-keeping duty. In the overseer’s
room that night a few of us were
warning him of the dangers that beset
the uninitiated in the great scrubs—
the ferocious sugar-ant, the savage Jacky
Winter, the deadly platypus that pounced
from trees and bit its victim in two.
Choom’s eyes were saucers of awed
interest. “Ah, yes,” he broke in when
we all ran out of breath, “there’s
no doubt I have much to learn. The
only thing I really know is how yo«r

snakes make their holes in the ground.
I was resting on my things while they
mended the coach pole last night, and I
saw a snake nosing about among some
stones. Presently it seized one in its
mouth, and, taking it a few yards to a
clear space, upended itself, assumed the
shape of an auger, and began to rotate
with tremendous speed. Soon it was out
of sight in the ground. Presently its
tail appeared revolving in the opposite
direction, and in a few seconds it was
on the surface again, brushing the earth
(or sawdust, as one might say) from
round the hole.” We decided it wouldn’t
take Choom long to become acclimatised.

“Hamer”: “One o’ the happiest Chris’-
muses I ever knoo was when I was
workin’ out Boggerville way,” said the
man on the park seat. “Great ’earts them
country people ’ave —sometimes. When
the noos went round that the Brogans
would ’ave a bread-an’-drippin’ Chris’mus,
if they ’appened ter ’ave any drippin’, it
was decided to ’ave a Chris’mus festivity
at their place, everybody takin’ somethin’.
It was a great roll-up, with cars and
buggies cornin’ from every direction ; an’
it wasn’t until the crowd ’ad assembled
that the disaster was discovered. Y’see
the Smiths ’ad said ‘Everybody else wili
be takin’ some booze ; we’ll keep to the
tucker, which may be overlooked.’ The
O’Briens and the Daleys and the Joneses
an’ all the rest said the same ; there was
puddin’s enough ter feed a narmy, and
poultry an’ cakes an’ things, but not a
bottle of beer, nor yet whisky either.”
“Well,” I commented, “you said it was
the happiest Christmas you ever spent ;
that shows” “Don’t be foolish!” he
retorted. “They ’ad a tarpaulin muster
an’ ’anded a few quid to a coupler of
fellers to drive like mad to the township
an’ bring out the booze. An’ the other
chap, like meself, was just an’ ’and ’oo
didn’t care whether ’e lost ’is job or not.
It was the ’appiest Chris’mus I ever
spent —why, I didn’t wake up until near
New Year.”

“B.B.”: A test of the efficiency of two
important public services was provided in
Sydney on a recent sunny afternoon. A
swarm of bees arrived in town, and after
investigating the Supreme Court build-
ing and the new green tram-car (the
latter greatly to the terror of passengers)
they rushed with a joyous hum to the
big red newspaper pillar-box in Eliza-
beth-street, and took possession. Most
of them clustered on the domed top, but
some posted themselves inside. The cop
on point duty might have said to him-
self “This is no affair of mine,” but he
took the broad view of his duty, pro-
cured a box from a near-by shop and
swept the swarm into it. A couple of
planks were popped over the top and
the bees were imprisoned pending his
Majesty’s pleasure. But over the bees
that had posted themselves inside the
pillar J. Hop had neither jurisdiction nor
temporal power, so he went back to his
job of traific-direction. Came the minion
of the Post Office to clear the box. An
angry buzz from inside warned him of
danger. He retreated to seek instructions
from his superiors, deeming it incredible
that the Postmaster-General would re-
quire him to risk bee-stings in the pur-
suance of duty. The Post Office con-
ferred with itself for a space, and raked
its sub-departments for an employee
versed in the art or mystery of bees. It
found one in the telephone branch, and
sent him out, instructed to “get the mails ;
“Talkin’ of careers, me ’usband always says ’e’s never looked back since ’e
married me.”
“I s’pose, dearie, ’e couldn’t bear to.”
alive if possible, but get them!” This
intrepid minion used his nut. Grabbing a
piece of oily cotton-waste from the
engine-room as he departed, he ignited
this when he reached the pillar-box and
dropped it through the slot. Presently
a great cloud of smoke issued, and with
it many bees. Then, and not till then,
was the key inserted and the mail with-
drawn. An heroic episode which goes far
to explain the widespread affection and
reverence in which the postal department
is held.
* * * *
“Gumleaf”: The very first medico 1
ever met —a Dublin M.D. who treated me
for measles in the ’eighties—hated
“herbalists” like the devil, as was only
natural, but he confessed to a belief
that there wasn’t a single plant, from
grass to orchids, in all the wide realm of
botany that hadn’t some curative
property “if we could only discover it.”
His pet remedy for the common cold was
“Soak your hanky in eucalyptus oil and
keep the hanky under your pillow at
night.” If medical science has developed
a better treatment since it has kept
mighty quiet about it. It comes as a bit of
a surprise to most Australians to learn
that the virtues of the oil of their gum-
trees are more appreciated abroad than
at home. Just one instance of this
is recorded in “The Sheet of Ink” by
Simonis. In the very early days of
“Pearson’s Weekly” there was an influ-
enza scare in England. Arthur Pearson
bought up all the eucalyptus oil supplies
in London and soaked all the paper for
an entire issue in a solution of it. Simonis
says that for weeks afterwards hundreds
of purchasers of the journal wore it next
the skin as a prophylactic.

“C.H.F.”: Under the influence of
waipiro a Rotorua Maori pinched a
sedan car and joy-rode up Ngongotaha
Mountain, crashing through cuttings at
terrific speed and striking each bank in
his mad career, to the detriment of the
car. After a while the roar of the
engine could still be heard, but it didn’t
seem to be getting any further away.
It was found that the car was hanging
half over a bank ; the only thing that
prevented it crashing down a 200-feet
precipice was the fact that the back axle
was caught by a large log. Inside the
Maori was asleep, his foot pressed down
hard on the accelerator. One of the
tyres was torn off by the friction
caused by the back wheels revolving at
a terrific rate. Six months’ hard labor
was the native’s portion, but at that he
must reckon himself very lucky. *
* * * *
“Avon”: Another country that has
adopted the Australian eucalypt is
Maoriland. There must have been a well-
distributed leaven of Australians among
the pioneers, for the bluegum is every-
where, towering over the oaks, elms,
willows, poplars and white pines which
the first white inhabitants planted wher-
ever they made a home. Especially is
the bluegum obvious on the Canterbury
Plains. Save in the case of the planta-
tions of the trees that occupy many rail-
way reserves in the province, E. globulus
is almost always solitary—a notable
landmark. Some of those that stand on
the Great South Road from Christchurch
to Invercargill are a good 2QO feet in
height and by all appearances fully 80
years of age. Only very rarely, in either
North or South Island, are there farms
with a row of bluegums sown as wind-
breaks. No type of eucalypt save the
bluegum seems to have been introduced,
and it comes as a revelation to Maori-
landers visiting Australia for the first time
to discover what a great variety the
family comprises.
* * * *
“Nakh”: It is time the Melbourne
Aquarium gave up its attempt to provide
the North Queensland crocodile with a
home from home. It is 45 years since
it started. Three attempts have been
made lately and nothing but misfortune
has resulted. The last victim didn’t even
wait till it got to Melbourne to register
its protest. Months ago an 18-foot speci-
men was secured from the Norman
River, and it got as far as Thursday
Island. There a Burns Philp steamer
tried to tranship it. Subsequently the
Aquarium authorities received a wire:
“Crocodile drowned, while boxing.” Pre-
sumably it gave its captors one on the
solar plexus and then committed suicide.
It must have heard of the Melbourne
climate.
* * * *
“Bob Sawyer”: I’m interested in the
conjecture of “Spare Sawbones” (B.
6/12/’33) that a stone found in the
stomach of a crocodile was possibly a
gallstone which originally belonged to
some human being eaten by the croc.
My only experience of gallstones has
been provided by a lady friend, who in-
sists on showing all her acquaintances a
small bottle containing certain tiny
articles which she says an eminent sur-
geon removed from her corpus. None of
the crocodiles which I have post-mor-
temed has ever contained a stone smaller
than a cricket ball. Still, I was prepared
to believe, until “S.S.” stated that sur-
geons “not infrequently find a bullet in
the appendix of an individual fond of
game foods.” The entrance from the
bowel to the tiny pocket known as the
appendix is hardly large enough to admit
a bristle. The only way a bullet could
enter would be from outside —and then
there would be no need for an appendix
operation.
* * * *
“8.W.”: Motoring between Tamworth
and Armidale (N.S.W.) we passed
some absolutely white grass. It is the
only specimen I have ever seen, and I
afterwards learned from a forester that
grass, to acquire this dead whiteness,
must be sheltered on three sides, and
receive sun and rain at definite periods.
A high, straight wall of rock provided
one of the shelters. Over this, accord-
ing to legend, a runaway native girl and
her lover, pursued by an angry father,
once leaped.
IN HANNAN-STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I heard their loud and glad surprise
To-day in Hannan-street;
I saw the pleasure in their eyes
That glows when old mates meet.
With heartiness they gave the grip
That stirs and sticks and lives,
The clasp of lasting fellowship
That only mateship gives.
They stood and talked while round them
swirled
The life of Hannan-street,
But they were in another world,
The world where old mates meet.
Again they followed far-off gleams,
Again the old lights burned,
Till, crashing in upon their dreams,
Reality returned.
They met in Hannan-street to-day;
Their words came from the heart,
For they were glad to meet, but they
Were none too loath to part.
They gave each other parting quips,
They spoke not of their fears,
They knew not from each other’s lips
How lean had been the years.
They met to-day in Hannan-street:
They met —let that suffice
It’s tough for two old mates to meet
When neither holds the price.

“T.P.”: Our organist’s dog, shut in the
vestry, whimpered miserably at the wind
that moaned and the hail which stacca-
toed on the slates while his master
stormed with organ-pipes and voice at
us basses, who flattened persistently on
the topmost note of the Christmas anthem
in rehearsal. Bruno thought his master
was in a brawl —an unheard-of proceed-
ing—and his whimper changed to a cre-
scendo wail, heard but faintly in the
church because of our basso-pro fundo
roaring. “Another try!” shouted our
conductor; and, chests out like mam-
moth pouter pigeons, mouths agape, bald
heads glistening, we struck that top note,
then pulled up short —to hear a seven-
fold Amen in agonised piercing yelps on
the precise note from the dog, who evi-
dently thought something awful had hap-
pened. That finished the practice!
* * * *
“Cross-nib” : A close relative of the
headlight fish (B. 29/11/’33) is Ganoidia
mechanica, the “carp-plumber.” Its black
and white stripes are graduated in inches
like a carpenter’s rule. On the top jaw is
a drill bit, and pincher-like mandibles pro-
ject from the bottom jaw. Mechanica
lives on oysters. Placing his drill against
the bivalve’s overcoat he revolves rapidly
and in a short time effects a puncture.
The displacement of the oyster is ex-
peditiously effected by a bladder-like
arrangement hanging from the fish’s mid-
section, operating after the principle of
a vacuum-cleaner. Being obese and slow-
moving, the carp-plumber, to protect
“You’ll never get into Heaven with THAT language.”
“I’ll never git into plurry Bogabilla widout it.”
himself from enemies, builds himself a
domicile constructed of the punctured
shells, which are threaded through by
mangrove twigs. From this sanctuary he
emerges to detach preserved prawns
(fresh prawns are ignored) from the
hooks of hopeful fishermen. He lifts
them as adroitly as an M.H.R. doth his
salary. The sugar-cured crustaceans are
stored in a hermetically-sealed pantry
pending the off-season, when oyster
crops show only a dozen whiskers to
the acre. This pantry usually takes the
form of a bottle—there are plenty at
the bottom of the sea—and one of the
strangest of marine spectacles is to see
the carp-plumber removing the stopper
with his corkscrew-shaped nose when
the time has come to broach supplies.
* * * *
“Groper”: Maitland Brown, one of
W.A.’s premier explorers, reckoned that
one of the bravest men he ever met was
a De Grey River black. Exploring that
river in the early ’sixties Gregory’s party
suddenly came on a camp of blacks, none
of whom had ever seen a white man or
a horse before. Instantly the whole mob
rose and fled. But before they had gone
far an old gin stopped and with shrill
screams apostrophised the fleeing crowd.
A young buck turned back and, with
spear at the ready, faced the white men.
“Shoot him!” someone called to Brown,
who was walking in the lead. The black’s
spear was against Brown’s chest, but the
white man read some sort of an appeal
in the black’s eyes. “No, let him be.”
Stepping aside Brown let the black pass.
Then dodging and ducking among the
horses’ hoofs, the buck ran to a clump of
grass and lifted out a tiny baby that had
been overlooked in the first wild alarm.
Knowing the wild blacks’ almost insane
terror at the first sight of the gigantic
horses, Brown considered that that buck’s
action was quite of the Victoria Cross
standard.
* * * *
“Pick”: Lying alongside a wheatfield
at Bungarby (N.S.W.) in wait for crop-
raiders, we watched a cat creeping from
the haystack to crouch in the headland
grass. Presently, with a wild spring,
puss landed on the back of a big hare
cantering towards the wheat. Thrice the
weight of his assailant, the buck bounded
yards to evade the onslaught. He threw
frantic somersaults and spun like a Cath-
erine-wheel to shake off the clawing foe.
Kicking viciously, he several times flung
back his attacker, to be again grasped
and held with furious determination.
Gradually the cat gnawed a way to her
hefty victim’s nape. There was a crunch
and a spasmodic quiver, and the feline
Lurich had won. She gripped the big
fellow by an ear, squirmed her frame
beneath him, and commenced to haul the
carcass to her kittens.
* * * *
“Wandana”: Before Northern Aus-
tralia can be considered civilised some-
thing will have to be done about the ter-
mites. Recently, somewhere near Dar-
win, a rail-motor was upset and two men
seriously injured through bumping into
a white-ant nest constructed on the line.
The strongly-compacted mounds which
the little brutes construct with amazing
rapidity are a source of danger to motor-
ists even on some of the back-country
tracks. I have known them work up
through a slight crack in a concrete wall
to attack wooden shelving eight feet
above, and even a fishing-rod of light
bamboo inadvertently left leaning against
the outer wall of a house has proved
sufficient for a battalion to get up into
the building and cause considerable
damage.
“Tufi”: The story told by “Macti” (B.
6/12/’33) that crocodiles have been so
numerous in Goodenough Bay on the
n.-e. coast of Papua that native fishing
had been seriously interfered with is
interesting to one who knew that quarter
well. “Macti” specially refers to the
beach fishing. In my experience, the worst
old crocodile never works on the beaches,
“He seth I’m a stinkin', rotten tailor. I’ve half a mind to send hith cheque hack.”
“I vouldn’t do that, fader. Use the other half o’ your nut and keep it.”
unless at the mouth of a small stream.
The crocodile is essentially a haunter oi
river fords and watering places when he
is after human or animal food. Good-
enough Bay was comparatively free
from the beasts 30 years ago, save
for those haunting the river villages.
Where they were a menace then was in
the Gulf of Papua, where the big river
deltas come in. In the villages on the
river-mouths and far upstream in those
days the women and children going down
to draw water had to be safeguarded by
bamboo stockades built in semicircular
formation out in the water.
* * * *
“Veteran”: I wonder if anyone re-
members Horatio Nelson —not the
admiral, but a cove who helped
to entertain Australia in the ’six-
ties. A cherished page of my old
scrap-book contains the adver-
tisement that presaged his greatest
achievement, which was staged at
Hobart. The announcement
reads: “Feat Extraordinary! Mr.
Horatio Nelson (of the Lenton
Troupe) will, while seated in a
washing-tub, drive four geese
from Government House to Mc-
Gregor’s shipyards on Tuesday,
August 29th, 1865, starting at 3
o’clock.” The distance, covered
in anything but placid waters, was,
approximately, half a mile ; but
the feat was accomplished with-
out mishap, notwithstanding a
crowd of boys in boats who gave
the driver’s feathered steeds very little
room to manoeuvre. I was one of those
worthies, praying devoutly for Nelson’s
upset.
* * * *
“Hamba Gachle” : I don’t know where
“L. R. Russ” (B. 6 /12/’33) got the in-
formation that the Zulu empire, which
was welded by Tchaka —I am using the
conventional spelling —drew its soldiers
from the old men first and sent the young
warriors into battle last of all. I have
had a fair experience of the Zulu and a
better one of the Basutu, an offshoot of
the Amazulu, as the Matabele were later.
I should say from what I knew of these
three peoples in days when they were
only half-way to civilisation that exactly
the opposite to “L.R.R.’s” theory is the
case. With all three, the young males
had to “wash their spears in blood”
before they were regarded as men. With
the Zulus proper a man could not hope
to wear the headring of carefully rolled
and oiled gum and hair which marks the
elder men of this fine people until he had
seen what we should call to-day “active
service” over a long term of years.
“L.R.R.’s” remark that the young man
was needed to breed fresh assegai-fodder
will make every old-time Afrikander grin.
Until the young Zulu had qualified for
his headring, and was an acclaimed war-
rior, he was not permitted to associate
with women in any way. Infringements
used to occur, of course, but the punish-
ment for both sexes was swift and deadly.
In my time the Zulu and Basutu women
were noted all over South Africa for
their chastity.
:fc * # *
“Dibatau”: There is no love lost
between the ordinary Papuan and the
Kiwai. My launch crew was challenged
to a game of cricket by a pit-saw gang of
Kiwais employed on one of the planta-
tions. On the day of the match the Kiwai
team appeared in white shirts, trousers
and boots (the last disappeared during
the game). Next day at sea a great discus-
sion went on among my crew: “Who
are these Kiwais?- They are not white
men ; they are blacker than we are. They
are not New Guinea men. They have
not New Guinea hair. They wear white
men dabua [clothes], but they are not
proper whites.” The discussion waxed
strongly till the coxswain, a true Motu
lad, leaned down from his perch and
said: “You feller no savvee what name
Kiwai? Me I savvee. Bloody half-
castes ! ”
* * * *
“J.W.W.”: I can vouch for the accu-
racy of “H.K.B.’s” statement that “bees
do not return to the hive itself, but to
the spot where the hive was” before its
removal (B. 15/11/’33). Here’s proof
in addition to that offered by
“H.K.8.”:
(1) Cut down a bee-tree in the bush with
a hive in it, say 60 feet up. The loaded bees
returning with their cargo will not search out
the hive in the fallen tree, but will hover round
a spot in space 60 feet high.
(2) Cut down another tree with a hive 20 feet
high, the same thing happens; the insects will
return and keep circling round a spot in space
exactly the height of their former home. They
will settle at night vertically underneath.
Instinct? Perhaps some strange power
of orientation, also found in certain
wasps.
* * * *
“Pick”: A corked and sealed bottle
unearthed by worm diggers on the banks
of the Snowy the other day presented
a mystery to the finders. On crumbling
paper folded within a scarcely-readable
message indicated that the dead marine
had been sent afloat on the flood waters
of the Cambalong—an affluent of the
Bombala —at Mt. Cooper in 1881. Where
the bottle was dug. from the sand, how-
ever, was 200 yards upstream from the
river’s junction. Two theories are favored
in the district. One side reckons that
the flooded Bombala so overcame and
backed the waters of the Snowy that the
glassware was carried upstream. The
other side considers it more likely that
the trailing feet of feeding rock-wallabies
dragged it to the location where it had
been buried.
SUMMER NOON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So sleepy it is! The warm odors rise from the
grasses;
The apple-gums keep
An opiate draught for the drift of a slow wind
that passes
Half-conquered with sleep.
Alone the cicada, that shrilly, monotonous
drummer.
Shouts from its fold. ,
All things are submerged m the oncoming tide
of the summer,
And drowned in its gold.
Far down the highway the ghost of a river
is gleaming;
The heated airs sway; , , .
The dusty-gold paddocks are drenched into
opaline dreaming,
At one with the day.
O summer world, hazed to the edge ol the
hyacinth distance
The far ranges keep, , . ,
I, too, am drawn into your undertow s steady
persistence,
And... .almost asleep.

THE CHRISTMAS DINNER
BROADCAST.
Station 280 calling! To-day’s special
broadcast of a typical Australian Christ-
mas dinner is brought to you by cour-
tesy of Hambones, Ltd., the well-known
Mammoth Stores, whose celebrated pro-
ducts are being enjoyed in so many thou-
sands of happy homes to-day. Stand by
for the ringing of the dinner-bell. There
she goes. Hear the crash, folks? That
was young Aubrey colliding with a chair
as he bolted for his place.
Now comes dad and the rest of the
family, Willie, Freddie, Betty and May.
And what have we here? Mum arriv-
ing with the soup. Yes, folks, it’s mulli-
gatawny— a tin —a snap at Ham-
bones’ famous cash-and-carry price. It’s
economical and easily made. Don’t
forget the name — Hambones —and when
making a purchase don’t forget to men-
tion 280.
That soup sounds good. You can hear
the long-drawn-in s-n-n-n-r-pp drowning
the feature music. Aubrey seems to be
making a combined mouth-wash and
gargle of his before ingurgitating it. A
great boy that! Phew! it’s hot: eighty-
nine in the shade.
Now we cross back to the studio for
a minute before the next course. Here’s
Gus Wogbag and his Melody Makers
playing “My Baby’s Step-ins Are as Blue
as Baby’s Ways.”
Back at the dinner, and father’s about
to commence operations on the turkey,
supplied kindly by Hambones, Ltd. All
poultry dressed —or undressed, ha! ha!
—at this popular store at prices to suit
the times. Well, the plates are piling up
as mum garnishes them with vegetables.
What a boon to the modern housewife
are tinned vege-
tables ! No messy
peeling, no waste.
Just put them in
the pot to heat,
and there you are!
Get a demonstra-
tion the next time
you are in Ham-
bones.
Father is starting
to breathe heavily
and has jettisoned
his collar. The
young sters are
maintaining speed,
despite the tem-
perature. Well,
that’s over, and we
are waiting on the
titbit of the day—
one of Hambones’
famous plum-pud-
dings. Here it is
now, steaming hot
and decked with
holly.
Well, that’s that!
And now for the
nuts. There’s a great assortment here.
Why shouldn’t there be? Hambones,
who supplied them, have the greatest
assortment in Sydney. What fun they’re
having with the crackers —also from
Hambones! Well, it’s all over, folks.
Dad has reeled away to look for a
cushion, mum has started to clear up
and the kids to clear out.
We will now cross back to the studio,
where you will hear A 1 Dammitt and
his orchestra playing a jazz version of
Chopin’s “Funeral March.”

Crookies ; Sexies; Undies; Snoozies,

This is serious news for creditors.
Bilkers may simply dodge into a beauty
parlor and order a new face.
And imagine the anguish of
the needy woman of fashion
who has to face 1934 with
last year’s cheekbones!
Again, if this specialist
isn’t kidding there will be
the dreadful contingency of
two women suddenly fac-
ing each other with identi-
cal faces, each having in-
vested in what she thought
was an exclusive model.
Imagine, finally, the
plight of the gadabout wife
who, hammering on the
front door of Emoh Ruo at
nidnight, is confronted by a
perplexed spouse, angrily
assuring her that she has
come to the wrong house.
Could a husband be blamed
in the circumstances for
ignoring the petulant pro-
test, “Don’t be silly, Hector,
I’m your wife. This is my
new summer profile”?

SPO RTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Sydney bookmakers have been com-
plaining bitterly about the taxes they
have to pay and the money they have
had to pay out recently to punters. No
grumbling was heard after Rosehill,
where every favorite was downed; in
fact, the Tommies won on six of the
seven races. Trainers Jack King and
George Morrow saddled up two winners
each ; but Rosehill’s Booth had an unfor-
tunate day, running four seconds with
members of his big team.
Little Bill Wedgewood enhanced his
prospects for the Villiers when he beat
a good field of sprinters in the Dundas
Handicap. Starting at 20 to 1 (the tote
div., one of three, was £7 Bs. for 10s.),
the son of Bicolor —a brother to Wind-
bag —came through on the rails at the
Leger, and won, pulling up, from Tom
Pinch and Gloriole. Of the beaten lot
nothing shaped better than Aussie’s
Delight, who eased in the betting to an
outside quote. Still the Villiers looks
like going to Bill Wedgewood, who is
one of the gamest horses seen for a long
time. He is trained on a dairy farm
at Maldon, but frequently visits
Menangle for special gallops.
Regal Star (7 to 1) was ridden a nice
race in the December Handicap by the
apprentice Maher, a son of Percy Maher,

OLDER. T
now a Randwick trainer. A number of
Summer Cup candidates sported silk,
Miramond going out favorite. He was
one of the first beaten, and in a good
finish Regal Star defeated the pacemaker,
Cherbourg, with Agincourt a fair third.
Nord was fourth ; he looks to be Mince
Pie’s chief danger in the Summer Cup.
Newcastle-owned and -trained Cercello
(7 to 1), a stable-mate of Sir Duninald,
captured the Novice in good style. He
was always going comfortably, and came
home strongly to beat Headgale and
Mayonnaise. The latter was a trifle un-
lucky in running. The unreliable Allevi-
ate was favorite ; he would not gallop
at any stage, and backers should forget
him. He has cost owner Byers, who
has Whitsome, a heap of money.
The Black Cat is easily the most con-
sistent two-year-old racing. He has
started five times, and has only missed
a place once, when he met with inter-
ference in the Kirkham Stakes at War-
wick Farm. Starting at eights, he led
all the way in the first division of the
Rosehill Nursery, being chased home by
Memento and Princess Deirdri. .The
favorite, Launcelot, was late to leave the
barrier, and, after being rushed up to
the leaders at the turn, faded in the
run home. Imitate was all the rage for
the second division, but the Dominion-
bred Limyris (7 to 2), a nice brown filly
by Limond from the imported mare
Pomyris, won so convincingly that it
will be surprising if she does not score
again. It was her first outing, and she
romped home from Irving, a stable-mate
of Imitate, who started at 20 to 1, with
Silver Wave, another outsider, third.
Pity amateur riders don’t get more
chances on. Sydney tracks. The race for
the Corinthian Cup was the most interest-
ing of the day; Happyendo (7 to 2)
beat the favorite, Tatyoon, by a long
head, with Beckwith in the minor plac-
ing. R. Moore, who rode Happyendo.
comes from Dubbo ; the owner is a well-
known sportsman on the South Coast.
Tatyoon was one of the last away. His
rider went round his field at the turn,
where his mount lost lengths.
Clever Fox (12 to 1) sent the bookies
home rejoicing when he annexed the
Carlingford Mile from Tingalba and the
favorite, Ranchero. He won easily, and
is in the Villiers with 6st. 121 b. Ran-
chero surprised by jumping away with
the lead. He had every chance.

Melbourne “pony” courses, formerly
three in number, have been com-
pressed into one, racing of this charac-
ter being confined to Ascot, where a
meeting was held on Saturday. Crowds
are increasing ; and tote-money on the
Five Hundred, the chief event on the
card, totalled £2614 ss. Small compared
with what goes through the machine at
Flemington, Caulfield, Moonee Valley
and Williamstown, but a record for the
course. This is to be extended, and new
buildings are going up on the Ascot Vale
side of the property.
Fred Hoysted provided the favorite
(and winner) of the Five Hundred in
Plum King, whom he trains for a brother
at Wangaratta. Plum King, an aged
gelding by the Comedy King stallion
King’s Treasure, started at 3 to 1. Always
in the picture, Plum King took charge
just after entering the straight, stalled off
a challenge from Watchful, and won by
half a neck. Kaoota was a mere head
behind Watchful, making his record for
this Five Hundred three wins, a dead-
heat for first place and a third. Hoysted
saddled up Casque d’Or as well as Plum
King. He claims that Casque d’Or is
badly handicapped.
......
Former Sydney jockey Lightfoot won
the first division of the Encourage Han-
dicap on Restlessness (7 to 1), a stable-
companion of Kaoota, by Bucklaw —
Nuit Blanche, by White Star from Sans
Repose, by Positano from Wakeful.
While none of the progeny of Wakeful
we re in her own class as gallopers she
nevertheless was a stud success, and the
blood is continuing good in later genera-
tions.
Ixion, winner of the second division,
first saw the light at the Bacchus Marsh
stud of Sol Green. His dam, Silistria,
came out from England in foal to
Orpheus; the result of that union is
Ixion, who, dropped in April, ranks as a
four-year-old by Australian time. He
was made equal favorite with Electric
Flyer, a smart colt by Woorak from
Poitrel’s sister Poyferre. In a tight
finish Ixion defeated Electric Flyer by
a long neck, with Dusky Queen third,
' ' ' . V,
a< ?J tl ° n to winning the Five Hun-
dred with Plum King Hoysted took the
thlrd division of the Encourage Handi-
cap with Par Cost, a three-year-old filly
by The Night Patrol; she won, running
away, by four lengths from Partrim and
the favorite, Carse o’ Gowrie. Followers
of the Hoysted stable, who are
numerous and influential, did not forget
to back Par Cost. She started in only a
point less demand than Carse o’Gowrie.
The Juvenile Handicap was easily
annexed by the hot favorite, Flower of
Egypt, one of the best sprinters that Man-
fred has sired.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Conceding lumps of weight, Bobby
Delaney beat Ron Richards decisively in
a 15-rounder at Brisbane Stadium. A
week before he had done the same thing
to the American Trulmans, who was
even heavier than Richards. Between-
whiles Robert knocked out a wrestler
who was mauling another outside the
ring. A most energetic young man.
* * H= H=
Joe Gotch, a newcomer from the
U.S.A., promised some excitement at
Leichhardt when he dropped Bill Beth
with a left swing as they were receiving
instructions from the referee ; but he did
not live up to that manoeuvre. Beth was
too big for him, and knew too much
about kicking, punching and pitching his
man out of the ring, as well as straight
wrestling. Near the end of the fourth
Beth picked his opponent up in a crotch-
hold and slammed him for a fall. Gotch
could not come up for any more.
Ins and Outs
After another exchange of cables, the
Board of Control has notified the M.C.C.
that it considers the bodyline argument
at an end, and that the Australian team
will leave as scheduled. The Englishmen
have acknowledged this with a cordial
welcome and everything seems set for
fair weather.
There are, however, unpleasant possi-
bilities. Feeling has run high, and it
might easily happen that some minor in-
cident, accidental or otherwise, might
lead to a most unfortunate situation. It
would have been a far better move if
both parties to the dispute had cancelled
the visit until the general rancor had
died down and the cause been forgotten.
One other aspect is worth considering.
The constitution of the board must be
altered. It must be put beyond the power
of any five individuals to call a meeting ;
only a majority of the States should be
permitted to do it. Had this been the
rule, the revival of the dispute when it
seemed comfortably settled would never
have happened.
H: * * *
“Five Ways”: The bodyline barge
ended in an atmosphere of slapstick, as
it deserved. When it was learned that
chairman Oxlade had cabled Marylebone
off his own bat, the indignation of the
diehards in Melbourne and Brisbane was
comic. The Yarravillers contented them-
selves with muttered curses, but the
Queensland pair, Hartigan and Hut-
cheon, published a pronunciamento
accusing some politician of “having a
finger in the pie.”. Both repudiated the
board’s cable; “the responsibility of
letting Australia down is off our
shoulders.” Wouldn’t these gentlemen be
better occupied in trying to dig up a few
cricketers?
* * * *
Two Sheffield Shield matches began at
the week-end. In Adelaide N.S.W. met
South Australia and came an ignominious
flop in its first innings, scoring only 108
on a good wicket; Fingleton 27 and Hill
24. Bradman was clean bowled by the
Sheffield neophyte Collins for one, and
others of the mighty, including Kippax
and Brown, were cast down from their
seats. Tobin (3-20) and Grimmett (2-17)
were chiefly to blame.
South Australia replied with 316.
Richardson went early for 3, but Nitschke
(82), A. J. Ryan (94 n. 0.), Lonergan (50)
and Shepherd (43) did well. Oldfield kept
magnificently, getting four wickets. Mair
took 4 for 69, Hill 2 for 30 and Chilvers
3 for 48.
Aided by some missed chances, N.S.W.
had 50 up without loss on Saturday night,
but at tea on Monday it was 8 for 271
(Kippax 90, Bradman 76, Brown 38,
Fingleton 30); Grimmett then had 5 for
103.
In Melbourne, Queensland tackled
Victoria a day and a half late owing to
rain. Play was very slow, and at
on Saturday Victoria had amassed 136
for 3 wickets. Woodfull went for 10 and
Ponsford for 23, Rigg acquiring a duck.
On Monday they were all out for 204
(O’Brien 72, Darling 63) ; Oxenham (4)
and Brew (3) getting most of the wickets.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: By way of winding up the
season when the Australian Eleven has
gone to England and another contingent
is touring Maoriland, Victoria is to enter-
tain a Westralian team in Melbourne.
The Gropers will play a three-day match
in Melbourne beginning February 15, and
may then go on to Sydney. On February
27 another match will be played in Mel-
bourne before the tourists break for
home. Westralia will pay its own travel-
ling expenses and when Victoria returns
the visit next year, as promised, will allow
the visitors 10 per cent, of the net gates.
{Continued on page 25.)
After a week’s spell before the final
Test match with the Northern League at
Swinton, the Kangaroos went down by
19-16. Each team landed five goals, but
the English side scored three tries to
two. England has thus won all three
Tests, a record for these meetings ; even
so, there is obviously little between them.
Of the 33 Tests played England has won
20, Australia 10 and 3 have been drawn.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Two Australian athletic
records went by the board in Sydney
the other day. Japk Metcalfe, the Uni-
versity athlete, hoisted his own Austra-
lian high-jump record to 6ft. 6|in. This
also bettered the Olympic record made in
Paris by American H. M. Osborne in
1924, though only by an eighth of an
inch. Another ’Varsity crack, Max
Rosenblum, sent the 161 b. hammer (from
a 7ft. circle) 141 ft. lOfin.
He H= . He *
“Misdeal”: The argument between
American and British bridge fiends over
the Portland Club’s dictum that the con-
ventional five-no-trumps bid is a breach
of the exposed-card rules (B. l/11/’33)
is warming up. The Commission Fran-
qaise du Bridge backs the Portland and
specifically bans the four- and five-no-
trump convention. The Yankees go
on their own way, as is only to be ex-
pected, since they started most of these
artificial conventions.
* * * *
“Solent”: It seems a certainty that the
costly business of challenging for the
America’s Cup, and the defence of the
article, which is not a cup but a jug, will
be entered upon next year. Sopwith, of
aviation fame, is the challenger, and his
new yacht, to be christened the
Endeavour, is already under way. The
Americans are forming the usual syndi-
cates to build defenders from which to
select the ultimate Yankee representa-
tive. Millions have been spent on this
tourney since the first race in 1851, and
it is estimated that the cost of the
present challenge will run to over a mil-
lion when all is reckoned up.
* * * *
“Sirius”: The N.S.W. Anniversary re-
gatta is down for January 26 and con-
tains the usual long list of rowing and
sailing events for all manner of boats and
craft. An added interest is proposed this
time in the shape of an international
ships’ boats race if it can be arranged.
As far as can be seen, there will be Aus-
tralian, British, French, Japanese and
Swedish merchant ships in Port Jackson
on the day, and it is expected that boats
from the navy will join in.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian heads of
amateur athletics are in a quandary over
the amateur status of John Hops who
compete at police sports with profes-
sionals. In the army and navy, amateurs
and professionals are allowed to com-
pete against each other without prejudice
to either. The rule does not hold good
in the case of the cops. However, the
Australian Council is to be asked to grant
a dispensation for the man in blue.

Ins and' Outs
“Lime”: While deprecating those Eng-
lish attacks on Bradman (B. 13/12/’33),
it must be said that the young man has
a maddening way with him where press
hounds are concerned. Bradman has been
filling an engagement in a Melbourne
shop. The usual horde of interviewers
got little satisfaction from him. Don
wasn’t definite about anything; he
wouldn’t say he would go to England
with the Australian team or as a profes-
sional or in any other capacity. A cele-
brity like this is enough to hasten the
average news editor’s descent to Avernus,
and it is no wonder that Don is unpopu-
lar on the RHtish Tnkv Wav
* * * *
“Richmond”: Considering the loss of
time through wet weather, the takings for
the Blackie-Ironmonger benefit in Mel-
bourne were satisfactory. Receipts were
£2535, of which the gate provided £1854,
the balance coming from club and private
donations. Expenditure included £lBB
for entertainment tax ; trustees of M.C.C.,
10 per cent., £167; gate expenses,
£l7 °- The amount of the players’ allow-
ances > £1 , 69 > was made U P pS the V.C.A.,
the total net amount being £lBlO, or
* or each beneficiary. A pleasant
gesture was the remitting by the M.C.C.
to the Collms-Andrews-Kelleway fund in
Sydney of £7l 55., the amount of the
expenses of the Victorian players in the
Sydney benefit match.

“obstructing the field” (Law 26).
* * * * *
“Hotham”: Much wrath has been
expressed by Melbourne cricket followers
at the extinction of the Collingwood club,
which follows on the failure of the
V.C.A. and the Collingwood Council to
come to an agreement as to sharing the
Victoria Park oval between the foot-
ballers and cricketers. Jack Ryder, Col-
lingwood’s skipper for 20 years past, will
play with Northcote later in the season,
some of his old mates going with him.

“Jolimont”: The Victorian C. A. is
sending a team to Tassie for a couple of
matches at Hobart and Launceston at
the end of the year, and has planked
down £330 for expenses. F. Yeomans
will manage the side, and Tassie is to
return the visit with a match on Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground early in February.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: International cricket is
being so greatly overdone that English
critics are beginning to jib. With M.L ,
the West Indies, South Africa and
India in the field in addition to Aus-
tralia, first-class cricketers in Britain will
have little time for food and sleep, save
when travelling, in the days that lie ahead.
One authority puts it that the intervals
between the visits to Australia and M.L.
cannot be extended, but as regards the
others it is probable they will have to
put up with taking their chance of a tour
that “cannot be made more often than
one year in four.”
* * * *
“Mid Leg”: From now until January
30 Sheffield Shield cricket, spasmodic to
date, will run its regular course. One
interesting aspect of it is the race between
Woodfull, Ponsford and Bradman to first
top the 50-centuries mark in the first-class
cricket. Only two Australians have done
that to date—Warren Bardsley with 55
and Macartney with 52. Woodfull, at
time of writing, has 44 up and Ponsford
43. Further back is Bradman with 41,
but his start was much later than that of
his rivals. As far as the Sheffields go,
Ponsford heads the centurions with 22 —
11 against South Australia, seven against
N.S.W. and four against Queensland.

“Baffy”: Recent references to slow
golfers and the desirability of a new rule
from St. Andrews to quicken them up
remind me that American Louis Diegel
goes to the other extreme, galloping round
the course at such a pace that he wears out
several caddies daily. Diegel has a way
of his own with slow players. Recently
he was paired in the U.S.A. champion-
ship with Cecil Walker, reputed the slow-
est player on earth. After a few holes,
the climax came on a green. Walker con-
sidered his putt from every angle, lying
down, crouching and standing up Then
he took out a handkerchief and held it
up to test how the breeze was blowing.
“Boy,” said Diegel bitterly to his caddie
as he threw himself full length on e
ground, wake me up when this has
got through. * *

“Cash Amateur : The British L.T.A.
has opened the door to trouble by an-
nouncing that it will permit its ‘ ama-
teurs” to accept as prizes “apparel for
exclusive wear on tennis courts.” One
never knows where this sort of thing
will lead to. If the apparel is selected
beforehand and is won by an outsize or
undersize player, how is the matter to be
adjusted? If an open order is given when
the prize is won, what is to prevent the
winner ordering a dress suit or an even-
ing gown and, if this is objected to, turn-
ing out on tennis courts in the garments?
And one recalls the practice followed by
certain army and navy tailors of the long
ago. It was their pleasing custom to slip
fivers and tenners into the pockets of
new uniforms for impecunious but ap-
proved clients and charge the amount up
in the bill to parents and guardians as
“extras.” They tell me this sort of thing
is already being done

“Kooyong : The Australian L.T.A. is
considering that proposal (B. 6/12/33)
to bring a number of tennis teams from
overseas countries to compete during the
Melbourne centenary celebrations, which
will rage from October, 1934, to April,
1935. Such a visit will take a lot of
planning out, but it is hoped to fit it in
with the Victorian championships in
December, 1934, and the Australian
championships in Melbourne early in the
following January. Matches in Sydney
and Brisbane would also be arranged, and
the South Australian titles could be com-
peted for at Adelaide at the end of
January. A match at Perth would wind
up the tour, and a good profit should
result from it.
Car and Cycle
“Wake Up”: One day last week a
small car was driven from Sydney
to Melbourne, 584 miles, between 7.20
a.m. and 10.20 p.m., with three hours off
for meals. The drivers were V. Barwick
and W. G. Buckle. To Albury the
average speed was 52 m.p.h., and from
Albury to Melbourne 47. No pedestrians
were injured.
* * * *
“Pram”: Sydney is responsible for
what its builder says is the smallest car
in the world. It has been built in twelve
months by J. McMaster, once a noted
Australian motor-cyclist on the roads and
now a wrestling referee. It is five feet
long and carries a 12-h.p. four-cylinder
engine. There are three-gears, giving a
speed of from five to 50 miles per hour.
Aeroplane low-pressure balloon tyres are
fitted, and it is electrically lighted. Fuel-
and oil-consumption figures are not
quoted, though its designer says it is the
most economical car in existence.

“Fitzcray”: The Light Car Club of
Australia holds its annual tamasha on
Phillip Island (Vic.) on New Year’s Day,
when the 100-mile road race will be run.
Sixteen entries have been accepted, and
others may be added on the entrants
complying with the rules. The list
includes all the leading Victorian drivers
and several from N.S.W. Competitors
will be allowed to practise on the Cowes
circuit until the morning of the race.

“Whizz”: The latest news from the
Malcolm Campbell front is calculated to
make the hearts of enthusiasts who hoped
to lure him to Lake George (N.S.W.) sink
into their bluchers. Malcolm has decided
on another dry lakebed, having come
to the conclusion that Daytona is hope-
less for greater speeds than those reached
there already. The new track is on the
Salt Lake desert, in Utah (U.S.A.), and
the attempt to reach 300 m.p.h. will be
made some time in July. The going has
already been well tested by the American
driver Jenkins, who hit up an average of
120 m.p.h. for a 500-mile spin on it a
couple of months ago.
Miscellaneous
“Blade”: Australian rowing men are
continually growling because they are
rarely represented at Olympiads, but tney
do little to help themselves in this regard.
Some time ago the Australian R-C. cir-
cularised the States suggesting a levy
6d. per oarsman in the affiliated clubs
other than juniors or schoolboys. Ihe
trivial amount has been the subject ot
protracted argument. Some clubs have
agreed with the scheme ; others, while
ostensibly approving, object to the
method of collection ; others again don t
see why they should part up their zack
per man. One thing is clear. The Olympic
Council has decreed that only those
sports which contribute the levy, or an
amount equivalent to it, will be con-
sidered when the next team for the Olym-
piad is selected. If the rowing men don t
want to find themselves on the outer once
more they had better get down to
business.

“Topping Lift”: There is trouble in
Sydney boat-sailing circles over the in-
creasing vogue of the 18-footers designed
on skiff lines, and the Sydney F.S., for
one, is considering the refusal of regis-
tration to the new designs. These have
much more Weatherly qualities than the
“skimming dish” 18’s of the old pattern,
carry a smaller and less expensive sail
area and need a crew of eight only, as
opposed to the 14 carried on the older
patterns. These last object to the new-
comers on the ground that their expen-
sive outlay on sails would be practically
wasted. They maintain that, as they have
contributed to the funds of the S.F.S.
for a period of 40 years and have been
the chief instruments in building up the
financial reserve of nearly £lOOO, they
have a strong claim to consideration.

The Oxford-Cambridge Rugby match
at Twickenham drew a 40,000 crowd,
Oxford winning 5 to 3. The Dark Blue
pack was badly beaten by the Cambridge
forwards and Australian Jan McShane
and his stand-off half, Jackson, had a
gruelling time. Owen Smith was magni-
ficent at full-back for Oxford and prac-
tically carried the day.
“Barbarian”: Hard to understand this
fuss about Afrikander Owen Smith play-
ing Rugger for England (B. 13/12/’33).
In addition to the Australians and Maori-
landers mentioned in “Birkenhead Park’s”
par., I can certify that a full-blooded
Chinaman has played in recent years for
Wales and an Egyptian for Scotland.
Further, a famous Scottish footballer of
some years ago had Samoan blood in his
veins.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 17.
Yarra Yarra Fellows.
“Yarra Yarra” may sound to tne un-
initiate like the war song of Caledon Bay
blacks about to skewer a missionary, but
it is really the title of one of Melbourne’s
swankiest golf clubs which years ago
succeeded to the tenements and heredita-
ments of a club that had links on the
Eaglemont Estate near Heidelberg. Yarra
Yarra took them over on November
25, 1911, the first ball being driven by
H. Darvall, then president and still a
valued member. At that time there were
26 full members and nine associates.
To-day the respective figures are 336
and 144.
In 1927 the club sold the old Rosanna
course and departed for its present stance
at Bentleigh, the manoeuvre being
conducted with great pomp by H. G.
Mcßoberts, president at that time. Four
years later, the president, who had been
putting his shoulder to the wheel to the
club’s great benefit for 18 years, resigned.
R. G. Ball succeeded him. “Mac” has
remained on the club committee and
represents it on the V.G.A., of which he
is president.
S. O. Hancock, whom Frith has drawn
sitting on the edge of what seems to be
a sand-bunker, shouldn’t be wearing that
satisfied smile unless he has got out of
it in one —seeing his handicap is 15,
that is most unlikely. Possibly the facts
that he sells motor-tyres and has recently
been married accounted for the beatific
expression. He is known to his many
friends as “Pambo.”
A. D. Milne, in spite of his pleasant
smile, is a member of the tribe that is
alleged to send your cheque back when
you are Is. 3d. o.d. with R/D marked
on it—quite an alphabetical exercise, but
not a popular one. None the less Allan
is well considered in the club and a
bright lad on the social side.
M. A. Alexander, one of Yarra Yarra’s
oldest and best-esteemed members, is
not nearly as fast a galloper as our un-
trustworthy artist makes him out. He
may be a bit fast between the greens,
but on them he has a capacity for sink-
ing ’em that lower-handicapped members
envy. The trouble is that he doesn’t
often get the chance to pick out —his
handicap is 27. A tobacconist in
business.
T. J. Booth, standing at ease in the
modern fashion, is keen on the social
side of club life, and is more often seen
sitting down to bridge than standing up
to his 19 handicap. In his spare time he
is a financier.
The poker-faced chap with the scanty
thatch is R. A. Johnston. He is a tobacco
merchant and can carry a long one with
the irons. Handicap is 21, so he is pos-
sibly not so good with the woods from
the tee.
Next we have pessimism personified.
The expression of Robert Watson is
easily explained. He has just heard of
someone in Melbourne who persists in
using gas heating and all that rot instead
of the Yallourn briquettes which it is his
business to sell for the Electricity Com-
mission. His club knows him as “The
Briquette King.”
H. Gillespie follows. He is one of the
boys of the village at Yarra Yarra as
far as making things hum at the nine-
teenth hole goes. In private life he is a
boxmaker, and in the wide open search-
light of golf on an 18 handicap.
L. G. May is one of Melbourne’s best-
known stockbrokers. He is a warm
golfer on the 7 mark and has been
treasurer. He and the Briquette King
are the people to see when the club cham-
pionships are on.
R. J. Parker, captain—he takes the job
seriously—is a bank manager. There is
nothing much wrong with his golf since
he is on the 3 mark. He puts in a lot of
courtesy work, visiting other golf clubs
on ceremonial occasions. This would
wear a lot of captains down, but R.J.
comes along smiling the morning after.
“Willie” Hope, whom Frith has estab-
lished on a cloud of what may be pre-
sumed to be glory—it looks like a pneu-
matic tyre but, since it is labelled
“amateur championship,” must be taken
for something like that —needs no intro-
duction to golfers, since his outstanding
win in the Australian amateur clash is
still fresh. Before coming to Australia
a year ago, he had been prominent in
British golf, as one might expect from
one of his name. His handicap, by the
way, is plus 3.
J. J. Thomson is a mighty hitter, as
his length in the drawing would suggest
—it is usually these spidery chaps that
get the distance from the tee if their
swing is right. His handicap of 8 puts
him in a first-class basket as a player.
Electrical goods occupy him away from
golf, so it is little wonder that he is re-
ferred to by his cobbers as the “hot-
point.”
Inscrutable as the Sphinx, though with
a more amiable expression, is G. P.
Taylor, who is a distiller. He must have
distilled some magic for Frith, for all that
hapless lad could say when he came back
from the South was that he liked to
play a private match with some friends
on Sundays. No need to dwell on his
handicap.
A. B. Dixon, who evidently recognises
at last that the handicapper has caught
him in the act, is now on an 8 handi-
cap. He is a hot golfer on that mark,
and a lot of folk who met him when he
was on a longer one are going into quiet
bunkers and kicking themselves —failing
what all of ’em would like to do: kick
the handicapper.
A. D. Hart, the solid lad with the
proboscis which tells of old-time
adventures on Broken Hill, is also known
as “The Evergreen” and “Red Hackle.”
An old hand with Broken Hill Prop., he
is one of Y.Y.’s pet lads, and is always
pulled out when some entertaining stuff
is wanted.
Sid Suhr, debonair and a confirmed
smoker of the world’s worst cigars, plays
golf off the 15 mark. Insurance is the
trouble which won’t let him get further
than a 15 handicap. A great dancer
at club functions.
D. J. Reddan, looking the dead spit
of Jack Crawford, is an ex-skipper of
Y.Y. A popular chap socially, his 5
handicap places him as a golfer. He is
another of Y.Y.’s’ tobacco men.
Cave Scarlett, a Melbourne produce
merchant, is popularly reported by his
fellow-members as “hunting in pair”
with “Pambo,” mentioned earlier in this
biography. Better leave it at that.
Ted Ashby, looking austerely through
his glasses at a younger world—probably
at “Pambo’s” friend, who is just in front
of him —is an old member. Off his 15
handicap he plays a pretty stick.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
ALL-IN METHOD FAVORED.
“A.8.C.”: If buyers who attend the
sales knew wool when they saw and
handled it, then there would be something
in doing up the clip as suggested by
“Murrawong” and co., and there would
be no complaint from manufacturers
when the acid test was applied. My ex-
perience over the past 20 years is that the
man who adopts the all-in method gains
pence per pound on the average for the
whole of his clip. This has been driven
right home to me during the past week.
A neighbor whose clip totals about
100 bales a year follows the all-in style.
Although he does take the bellies out
of most lines he always has a line with
bellies enclosed. His total number of
pieces seldom exceeds six bales.
1 strive to do my wool up as recom-
mended by experts and usually finish
with about 50 p.c. fleece wool. Yet my
neighbor beats me hollow for average
per pound for the clip.
This year he decided to improve his
flock. He imported an experienced classer
to go through his ewes and cull 33 1-3
p.c. This was in April. Times were
bad and seasonal prospects not the bright-
est, so I secured 250 of the best of his
culls on shares. I was to shear them and
give half the wool back. The previous
owner was present at the shearing. I
gave him the wool from the first 125
sheep shorn. Under his instructions I
dumped it straight into the press from
the board, bellies, locks, etc., as it came
off the sheep.
Total, three bales, averaging 3051 b.
each. My share I tabled, taking all faulty
fleeces, skirtings, etc., out, with the result
I had only two bales in this line, averag-
ing 2971 b.
I got 16jd. per pound for my two
bales ; the neighbor, who sold a week
later, with a possible 10 p.c. rise in the
interval, secured 20yd. for his three.
I do not profess to come under “Mur-
rawong’s” 5 p.c. of owners who can
“competently class a clip,” neither do I
know the yield, but I guarantee to
spot an all-in clip without the facilities
at the disposal of people who rush
around our showroom floors with assis-
tants and catalogues on a sale morning.
“Albarmount”: Many complaints
about badly-classed dips could be obvi-
ated by bringing the growers more in
touch with the needs of the trade. At
present they are working in the dark,
so to speak. Even competent wool-
men are at times at a loss to
know the type or types of wool in
greatest demand. If the N.S.W. Educa-
tion Department could supply qualified
instructors from the Tech, to examine
the. get up of the various clips at the
stores, as viewed by the buyers, and send
their criticism and suggestions to the re-
spective owners, it would help immensely,
not only in the method of classing, but
would keep the sheepmen in touch with
the vagaries of the market and give them
data to work on.
This is a matter that needs to be taken
up by the Woolgrowers’ Council and
representative organisations. If the de-
partment cannot afford to do the job
a half-dollar from each clip should be
enough to pay the instructors.
“GRADING” IS THE WORD.
“Mouton”: “Sheepo” (B. 22/11 /’33)
criticises “Murrawong” (B. l/11/’33).
Both would do well to drop the term
wool-classing, and use the more appro-
priate one “grading.” Wool needs care-
ful grading like any other primary pro-
duct. And wool-classing, as “Sheepo”
appears to regard it, does not fill the bill.
“Murrawong’s” statement that a clip
should be divided into lines that suit the
manufacturer simply means that the clip
should be graded, and he is quite right.
And “Sheepo’s” statement that it is a
misrepresentation is absurd.
To grade a clip for market a certain
amount of fleece division is abso-
lutely necessary. And any modern wool-
classer with reasonably skilled labor can
do what is required. “Sheepo” says that
a classer’s duties are to grade wool
according to length, quality, soundness,
condition and color. These are known
as the five sorting or grading principles,
because they grade wool into types to
meet the requirements of the textile trade.
A woolclasser who bases his work on
them and does it well must actually do
some sorting. Therefore, “Sheepo” un-
consciously agrees with “Murrawong.”
I can assure “Sheepo” that quite a lot
of clips in Australia are so well graded
that they go straight to the scouring-
bowls without any additional sorting.
And, what is more, the owners are quite
satisfied that it pays them to provide the
proper facilities and labor to make
station-sorting practicable.
INTER-LOTTING AND POOLING.
“Woolaway”: “Sheepo” and “Trepex”
(B. 22/11/’33) are pertinent concerning
the preparation of farmers’ clips. In the
‘main they are correct. “Trepex” puts the
position in a nutshell. The matter con-
cerns the whole industry, particularly the
selling side, by reason of the increasing
expense of handling, cataloguing and
showing the innumerable small lots of
wool now appearing in greater bulk every
season. It is a work and responsibility
of the selling broker that is not appre-
ciated as it should be by the small
grower, who is apt to forget that he is
not the only pebble on the beach.
The s.g. must learn, too, that the
main factors which make for a success-
ful sale of wool are evenness of type,
quality and condition. Results can only
be achieved by adopting the “Trepex”
method. If by reason of its successful
working an extra yd. or Id. a lb. is
added to the small grower’s returns, so
much the better for us all.
ANTHRAX SYMPTOMS.
“Jumbuck”: A recent outbreak of
anthrax in Victoria should act as a warn-
ing to all stockowners, more especially
those who have sheep dying in sus-
picious circumstances. Treatment is out
of the question, and all carcasses should
be burned, and the remains liberally
covered with quicklime. Burying is
dangerous, as the spores are apt to be
brought to the surface by either plants
or worms.
The symptoms vary. The most com-
mon is that of a sheep isolating itself
from the flock and standing still with
drooping head and lop ears. The tongue
usually swells, preventing the sheep from
closing its mouth. A mad gallop around
in circles may take place before death,
but generally sheep will have died before
any symptoms have been noticed. The
disease may come through bacilli in the
drinking water or through cuts in the
skin. Old sheep are more prone to the
disease than are lambs or young sheep,
but in country where anthrax might have
been years previously an outbreak is
liable at any time.
If any stock have died and there is
reason to suspect anthrax, the stock in-
spector must be notified immediately.
No carcass should be touched with the
bare hands on any account.
DORSET HORN FATS.
“W. D. McC.”: Whom are we to be-
lieve when experts differ? We read that
the public demands small joints, and pro-
ducers are urged to breed to that end.
Then Government experts advise the
use of Dorset Horn rams to raise ex-
port lambs. This breed is certainly one
of the largest and coarsest varieties of
sheep. Its wool is next door to hair
and its horns are like a buffalo’s, the
flesh is overloaded with fat and as coarse
as it is possible to be, and its only re-
deeming feature, as far as I can see, is
that it breeds early; but the progeny
quickly develop a staggy appearance
which is most undesirable. Why the
Government recommends them is beyond
my comprehension.
E. A. Elliott (Sheep and Wool Expert,
N.S.W. Agric. Depart.):
“A.J.8.” (B. 21/11/’33") is not quite correct
when he quotes us as claiming the Dorset Horn
as the most suitable for lamb-raising. We
claim the Dorset Horn is the earliest-maturing
breed and so Will produce saleable lambs more
quickly than a ram of other breeds.
Regarding the “fault” of the Dorset Horn-
cross lamb being too fat after four months, the
object very often is to get the lamb marketed
as early as possible, and there is no object in
keeping the lambs after they have reached the
required weight and appearance for market.
CARBON TETRACHLORIDE.
“J.A.S.”: The C.S.I.R. has sounded a
warning note against the promiscuous
use of this drug for fluke and worm treat-
ment. In an actual experiment with
fully-grown sheep, loss of appetite and
general lethargy were noted, such symp-
toms continuing for increasingly long
periods after each treatment. As the
sheep were under constant observation,
actual mortality was not serious, but
under field conditions it is often ques-
tionable whether drenching is justifiable
except where infestation is heavy. It has
been demonstrated that, although the
usual 5 c.c. dose does not markedly affect
the liver, an overdose undoubtedly does.
It must be remembered, too, that
animals vary enormously in their sus-
ceptibility to poisons and drugs.
The salient points to remember are
that sheep on minerally-deficient country
are liable to heavy mortality ; that star-
vation prior to drenching is not only
needless but harmful; and that carb.
tetrachl. is a cure and not a preventive. If
the conditions intended to be cured do
not exist, harm, not good, is likely to
result.
#
WINTER GRASSES.
“Aplanges”: Queensland is waking
up to the advantages of a winter-growing
grass. Her dairying districts depend
almost entirely on paspalum and Rhodes,
and neither of these gives good feed in
the cold weather. Both the Agricultural
and Dairying Councils are trying to
persuade farmers to grow a winter grass.
The State schools are co-operating.
So far records show that perennial rye
and phalaris tuberosa are probably the
solution, as both stand the mild winters
well and are capable of surviving even
in thick crops of paspalum. The sturdy
growth of the latter is too much for
many of the more delicate grasses, so
that after one winter the introduced
grass is practically choked out. Rye will
also grow amongst bracken, and, though
it will not kill it out, still the cattle mov-
ing about in search of it soon trample
the fern underfoot.
COCKSFOOT.
“Minthall”: The average dairy herd
in M.L. looks better, milks better and
lives on land that carries more per acre
than in Australia. M.L. has worked con-
sistently for pasture improvement. One
of the hardiest grasses we need is cocks-
foot (Dactylis glomerata ), which in N.S.W.
will thrive on coast or tableland. As it
revels in cold and frost it is just the balance
needed when so many of our grasses are
dormant. It is a perennial, widely adapt-
able, a persistent grower and very palat-
able and nutritious for all classes ot
stock. Great publicity was given this
grass some years ago, but although sown
extensively it did not come into general
use, because seed obtained was im-
perfect. The M.L. seed is tested by the
Government experts and carries their
certificate as to pureness and type. Ask
most of the dairymen of the Shaky Isles
as to what stands to their herds most,
and the bulk will plump in favor ot
cocksfoot.
UNPROFITABLE WHEATLAND.
“C.R.”: Comments on the wheat har-
vest in South Australia (B. 22/11/ 3j)
and the low yield per acre generally
overlook one question: Should certain
areas now under wheat be retained for
that purpose or devoted to wool produc-
tion?
The general rainfall for many years
before white settlement has left its mark
on the grasses and bushes of S.A. so
clearly that Goyder was able to draw a
definite line across the State and say
“Thus far shall you grow wheat and no
farther.”
For some years, however, with the en-
couragement of occasional wet seasons,
more and more land beyond the line has
been converted to grain, until districts
can now be cited which have suffered
more failures than not in the last 10
years. And these are places well adapted
for wool production.
Is it not time that the false prices paid
for such land to grow wheat were
written off and the area devoted to the
one industry which appears to be able
to support itself, and for which the land
is most suited?
PIG-EXPORT SUCCESS.
“El Verdugo”: Australia’s bacon-
export opportunity which I have been
preaching through The Bulletin the last
few months has been well illustrated in
the recent “Chronicle” competition for
porkers and baconers in England. A run
of porker carcasses adjudged prize-
winners at the last Adelaide show and
bred at the Northfield Mental Hospital
was sent overseas for the competition.
They were Large Whites and Large
White-Berkshire crosses —the types which
I have been advocating on the basis of
Danish experience. J. W. Aldridge,
of Angle Vale, was also represented with
baconers. A well-known judge, H. B.
Widtney, judged the asylum show of
porkers at Nelson’s Dock, Portsmouth, on
the basis of 30 points for conformation,
50 for suitability for trade requirements
and 10 each for shape of ham and con-
dition. The exhibit was awarded full
marks and won its class, as did also Mr.
Aldridge’s showing.
Afterwards, G. A. Cooper, a well-
known Portsmouth butcher, who owns
26 shops, bought the exhibits, paying 7d.
per pound for the 601 b. to 801 b. entries;
6yd. for the 801 b. to 1001 b. ; 6d. for the
1001 b. to 1201 b., and s|d. for the heavy
weights. He said that the show was im-
posing and uiat block test proved the
S.A. pigs’ case. He was so pleased with
his purchase that he has decided to pre-
sent a 30-guinea cup for competition in
S.A. next year to encourage the develop-
ment of the good work already done.
As I have pointed out several times,
there is a £26,000,000-a-year bacon market
waiting for us so soon as we are prepared
to get down to a standard white pig on
Danish and Canadian lines and really
tackle the problem of pig disease. Inci-
dentally, an organised national pig-export
trade will help us to consume a lot of
surplus grain and other products.
FEEDING FOR BACON.
“Alf Alpha”: It is well known that
certain plants and foods taint milk, and
it is also recognised in the bacon busi-
ness that certain fats and oils, when fed

The
Vauxhall Light Six
is priced from £285
So Little to Pay For
So Much Extra Value!
Vauxhall’s 30-year reputation plays no small
part in a Vauxhall owner’s pride in his car.
For Vauxhall dependability rides with him
every mile he drives. In the gear box he has 4-speed
synchro-mesh transmission with silent third; in the
engine he has ample power to give 6S to 70 miles an
hour; and in the body, by Holden, he enjoys a roomi-
ness that seems unbelievable on a car of only 101 -inch
wheelbase.
Everywhere quality and completeness is evident:
leather upholstery, No-draught ventilation, bumpers
front and rear, shock absorbers, and
every little detail that pampers personal

“JONAH”
Price 6s. By LOUIS STONE. Posted 3d. extra.
“JONAH” is considered to be a worthy successor to “Robbery Under Arms”
and “For the Term of His Natural Life” amongst books which can properly
be described as “Australian Classics.” It will surprise those who now read
it for the first time by its masterly treatment of a phase of Australian hte
which has almost vanished.
Sydney Morning Herald: ... .“it would be difficult to recall any work of
fiction that conveys a stronger impression than ‘Jonah of the city streets,
the Harbor, and the dwellers in Sydney’s poorer quarters.
The Wellington Dominion: “Jonah’s dramatic business career makes
good reading.”
Melbourne Herald: “one of the few Australian novels that really
matter.”
Brisbane Courier: “Mr. John Galsworthy wrote, ‘l’ve lapped up your
novel, which I think extraordinarily actual, vivid and good.
Smith’s Weekly: “Louis Stone’s book is destined to become an Aus-
tralian Classic.”

“IN PURSUIT OF PATRICK”
> r i ce 6s. By VERA DWYER. Posted 3d. extra.
rhe story is of a girl who, in a moment of pique, dismisses her sweetheart,
rhen, learning of his departure for Australia on a film enterprise, she
suddenly decides to go after him. On her arrival in Sydney, she is told
hat he has gone “on location” to Fiji. Her impetuosity takes her to the
-omantic South Sea Islands. She travels on a “holiday cruise” steamer,
and on board meets a typical pastoralist’s daughter and some girls from
the cities, who provide her with some interesting musings.
The Brisbane Telegraph: “the book should do much to enhance the
reputation Miss Dwyer already has won with her juvenile stones and travel
books.”
Woman’s Budget: “it is a compact and soundly written novel, and its
appeal to most women should be immediate.”
Country Life “containing all the qualities of romantic light comedy
with the interest of a travel story.”
Melbourne Herald: ... .“a pleasant, brightly written romance.”
Daily Telegraph (Sydney): “the author evidently knows Fiji, and her
descriptions of life there are amazingly good. She gives a color to the
flavor of Island life.”

Epic Tour on Dynamic Plugs
Messrs. Bennet, Boyer, and Maloney returned
to Melbourne after completing 11,000 miles
Round - Australia tour, full of praise for the
perfect performance of the Leggett Spark Plug.
They covered over 11,000 gruelling miles under
trying conditions with the car racked and
strained under a dead load of 2 tons —through
sand, scrub, and bush —-bogged to the axles in
mud—through tropical downpours and blind-
ing dust storms. Still they plugged on —and
came through, with mechanical troubles of
course, but their Leggetts Spark Plugs did not
fail them once.
In their own words, “The plugs were perfect—
untouched not a miss or falter, and 17.3
m.p.g. average.”
An amazing feat ot endurance —an epic ot
performance, conclusively proving Leggetts
Spark Plugs quality and Power of Difference.

promiscuously, or when there is excess
oil in a ration, affect the bacon. Thus,
instead of a high-grade, firm, white,
good-colored bacon-fat, which is the
natural result of good feeding, you may
obtain a bacon made up of a soft, yellow,
oily fat, objectionable in color, taste and
odor, which becomes rancid when kept.
The manufacture of fat in the animal
or plant body is a process of which
science knows very little, but it is a well-
known fact that the natural fat of the
animal body is formed from the elements
of the carbohydrates (non-nitrogenous
compounds, such as sugar and starch)
contained in the foods fed to the beast.
The right way is to feed fat in the food,
to help to supply the energy for the pig
to live, but without providing any excess
of foreign fat or oil to contaminate the
bacon-fat formed by the pig within its
body from the carbohydrates, supplied
usually as cereals, milk and potatoes or
some root crop.
In England and the Continent barley-
fed pig is said to produce the best-
flavored pork or bacon, and flavor is
bound up in the quality of the fat.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Y.Z.”: Do not discard files that
appear worn out until you have made
them red-hot in a fire. This method
burns off all the grease and dirt and
gives them a new lease of life.
“Eureka”: The bowl of an old pipe
makes a handle for a small file, with
which one gets a “pistol” grip giving
far greater control than an ordinary
handle.
“Dejay”: Clamp an old motor-tyre in
the vyce and halve it with a saw, making
two circles, which are one of the best
troughs for feeding piglets, poultry or
ducks. Birds can’t crowd each other but
feed in a circle, and more can-get to a
circular trough than to the same length
of a straight one. These troughs are
easily scrubbed out and last well. A few
pegs will hold them in place.
“Eureka”: Always keep a tanned hide
handy in the harness shed. It is very
useful when you need such things as
straps for rugs, leather washers or even
belts and bootlaces.
“Karaway”: Spraying the inside of the
fowl shed with a garden syringe is a
quick and easy way to lime. This gets
the wash into all the cracks of a split-
slab wall, on which it is not always easy
to use a brush.
“Wandi”: Wild apple-tree wood
(Angophora), generally reckoned useless,
is one of the best in the bush for mak-
ing bullock yokes and wheel naves and
rims, as it is light and tough.
“Nipped”: Never pack damp fruit. If
it has to be picked with moisture on,
dry it off in the packing-shed prior to
casing. The tip is where most of the
steamed and sweated unsaleable fruit
lands. You get a debit note for cartage.
“Eureka”: Always have a lump of
washing-soda handy, about the size of a
marble, and as soon as a dog shows signs
of poisoning, no matter whether it’s
strychnine or arsenic, put this lump of
washing-soda down his neck. It will
make him empty his stomach, which is
better than an antidote, so long as it is
done early enough.
“W.P.T.”: Here is a good liniment
for sprains, swellings, stiffness, muscular
and joint pains in either human beings
or animals: Mix half a pint each of tur-
pentine, linseed oil (raw), methylated
spirits and eucalytus oil. Always shake
the bottle well before using, and rub it
well in.
“X.Y.”: In B. 22/11/’33 “Mulgo”
gives plain and practical directions for
saving neatsfoot oil. Add this warning:
neatsfoot oil, like most animal oils, can
cause fires by spontaneous combustion.
If, for example, lard oil is used to saturate
a lump of cotton-waste, and the waste
is then put in a warm place where plenty
of air can circulate round it, as under
an iron roof, in 24 hours the cotton-
waste will become a glowing coal, especi-
ally if the weather is warm.
“Cockyson”: This is how we used to
load the pigs on the farm without special
loading facilities. Stand one on each
side of grunter to be hoisted on to the
waggon ; take a firm grip of the ears,
one with the left hand the other with
the right; grip hands beneath the pig’s
belly well back ; give a grunt and a heave
and the squealer is loaded. With weighty
pigs a push by a third person from
behind makes the job easier.
“Pick”: Use a tomahawk when lop-
ping elms, poplars, or willows to feed
starving stock. Imported trees, when ruth-
lessly topped, sprout the more vigorously
and quickly produce another crop of
foliage. Thresh the leaves only off
myrtles, kurrajongs or hickories with a
two-feet copper wire tied to the tail of
a stockwhip. Shear the spines from oaks
or wild cherry trees with clippers. Native
trees take long to recover, and sometimes
die, when their twigs are severely
trimmed.
“Woorinen”: The patent corrugated
cardboard strips soaked in naphtha com-
pounds suggested to deal with codlin
moth (B. 29/11/’33) are very good, but
they won’t stand for 12 months and they
will not do in warm climates. They
should be taken off and burned no later
than first week in March. The heat
evaporates the naphtha, and after that
they will not kill the moths.
“Wrash”; When hurrying processions
or black ants pass up and down passion
vines, growers are apt to blame them for
an appearance of dwindling in the plants.
They are really doing a friendly service.
Clusters of sap-sucking baby slugs on
the tendrils are causing the wilt, and the
ants are there to deal with the destroyers.

There appears to be a crack in the bottom

nas not been applied in accordance with the
directions given. Closely inspect for signs of
cracking before further treatment is applied
If there are no structural defects the Sylvester
process may be used to prevent seepage. This
consists of applying successive coats of soap
solution followed by a solution of 5 p.c. of
alum, allowing each coat to dry before the

coat should be of soap solution.

pass it on to his progeny ? (3) Is there a reli-
able means of ascertaining if a bull or cow
has mammitis if it is not noticeable in the
c an a cow be cured once she has
it . (j) is there a reliable means of prevent-
ing the disease entering a herd or spreading
to other healthy cows ? —9068.
(1) No. (2) No. (3) Yes. Recover the strip-
pings from the suspected cow and forward
them to Yeerongpilly (Q.) Animal Health
station tor microscopical examination. The
bottle should be sterilised (the cork also) by
boiling for ten minutes and the strippings taken
with as little contamination as possible. (4)
• early stages there is a reason-
aole chance of recovery. Autogenous and stock
vaccines are prepared in the Yeerongpilly
laboratory. (5) The control of mastitis (mam-
mitis) is possible. Suspicious cows should be
1S j atec *'. Ihey should be milked last
ii erd ’ a , n d the affected quarter last of
all. the attendant should thoroughly wash his
hands in disinfectant following the handling of
the udder of an affected cow. The disease is
highly contagious, and can be readily trans-
mitted from animal to animal by the hands of
the milker. The milk of affected cows should
be boiled and destroyed, preferably by deep
burying in a secluded spot unfrequented by the
herd. All new animals should be closely
watched before allowed to mingle with the herd.
(1) What has Dr. Jean White-Haney done in
pnckly-pear research work? (2) Who firs
introduced the cochineal beetle into Australia >
(3) Is there any danger of the Cactoblastis
attacking anything but prickly-pear ? Have
they been known to attack tomatoes or pump-
kins ? —9186.
(1) Dr Jean White-Haney was officer-in-
charge of the Government Prickly-pear Experi-
mental Station at Dulacca (s.-w. Q.) during
the years 1912 to 1916, and engaged in scientific
research work to ascertain the cheapest and
most effective method of dealing with the pear
problem. She carried out extensive field experi-
ments with all the known poisons and various
compounds, as a result of which it was shown
that As2os (arsenic pentoxide) was vastly
better than all other pear poisons. This has
been extensively used for a number of years
(2) It is understood that the cochineal was first
. introduced into Australia by eighteenth-century
colonists with a view to providing the red dye
required for the coats worn by the soldiers.
The cochineal was no doubt early exterminated
by native insect enemies that preyed on it
The next introduction was made in 1913 from
Ceylon by the Travelling Commission that had
been appointed by the Queensland Government
to investigate the pear problem in other coun-
tries. (3) There is no danger of Cactoblastis
causing material damage to economic crops.
Before the insect was introduced into Australia it
was subjected to severe tests on all economic
crops. It was again fully tested in Australia
before being liberated. Although it can feed
tc a limited extent on a few crops, such as
tomatoes, etc., it cannot complete its life cycle
on any plant other than prickly-pear.
(1) Process for preparing passion-fruit pulp
for commercial purposes ? (2) Machine used
tor extracting pulp ? (3) Would preservatives
be necessary ? (4) Market for passion-fruit
pulp ? —9305.
• J* is a trade secret. (2) Cut the fruit
in half, and possibly the orange-juice extract-
ing machines would extract the pulp. (3) Pro-
bably the extracted pulp of passion-fruit may
ferment quickly. (4) The pulp market is
not certain, but reports suggest that an opening
might be found in U.S.A.
Are more cows milked by machinery than
by hand in N. S.. Wales?— 92ls.
There are no statistics, but there is little
doubt that the number milked by hand is in
the majority.

Bill O’C.”: The historic phrase
“What a city to loot!” attributed to
Blucher when he viewed London from
the dome of St. Paul’s, will have to go
into the discard. According to his great-
grandson, it was to the top of the Monu-
ment, not St. Paul’s, that old “For-
ward” was taken by his hosts. Pos-
sibly the stiff climb (for a man of 74) or
the chatter of his cicerones, who harped
on the wonders of the city below, of
which nothing could be seen for smoke
and fog, made him impatient, but he
stopped the encomiums with a gruff “Was
fiir Plunder!” The words really mean
“What rubbish! ” and have nothing to do
with sacking. The phrase has had a long
and useful life anyway (Thackeray picked
it up and set it going in “The Four
Georges”), and it will probably have a
robust old age in spite of this correction
of the sense.
* 4: ifc
“Mr. Cato”: It is computed that at
least 80 per cent, of all that has sur-
vived of Dr. Johnson’s original “copy” is
in America, collectors in that country
having paid thumping sums for it. Yet
no Englishman ever detested Americans
more. “Sir, the Americans are a race of
convicts, and ought to be thankful for
anything we allow them, short of hang-
ing,” Johnson declared ; also, “To a man
of mere animal life you can urge no
argument against going to America
but a man of any intellectual enjoyment
will not easily go and immerse himself
and posterity for ages in barbarism.” It
seems unlikely that the Great Cham of
literature was popular amongst eighteenth-
century Americans, but he has certainly
become so amongst modern Yankee bib-
liophiles. Some of them can be
generous, too. R. B. Adams of Buffalo
has returned to its rightful home the only
known letter from Johnson to Oliver
Goldsmith. It goes to the Johnson Club
in London.
* * * *
“Forthright”: British motor-car build-
ers claim that, whatever else may be the
quality of their cars, endurance is one
which cannot be disputed. The Morris
people set out recently to drive the point
home. They picked on a privately-owned
car which had done 48,000 miles and—
under the eye of a movie camera —put it
through stunts which included all sorts
of rough road work, including plough-
ing through deep and muddy-bottomed
streams. Then petrol was poured all over
the car and fired. When the flames had
died down, the engine responded instan-
taneously to the self-starter. The final
test was driving at high speed through
a substantial brick wall. The car went
through it with no worse damage than a
broken windscreen, though the driver
was unhurt. The body was all metal,
and the screen and windows were of non-
splintering glass.
* * * *
“Centurion”: American police have
adopted a new idea in criminal investiga-
tion —chemical analysis of the skin on a
person’s hands to decide whether he has
recently discharged a firearm. It is
claimed that microscopic portions of
the explosive adhere to the skin. This
is true enough of the old-fashioned
revolver, the “backspit” of which,
especially where black powder was being
used, would soon mark the hand between
the forefinger and thumb if the weapon
was fired frequently ; but it remains to
be proved that it is applicable to modem
automatic pistols. It is worth recalling
that Le Gallifet’s troops used this mark —
ineradicable for some time after it is
made— to identify Communists when sup-
pressing the Paris rebellion of 1871.
Whether carrying arms or not, every man
or woman with the telltale smudge from
the old, black-powder chassepot between
finger and thumb faced a firing-squad.

“Lord Luvus”: The discovery of a
sea-serpent in Loch Ness, Scotland, ought
to settle a vexed question once for all.
The subject has excited public interest for
so many hundred years that the loch
should be drained and the elusive mon-
ster exhibited in captivity. In ancient
days they spoke of “the sea-serpent,” it
being assumed that there was only one.
Pontoppidan reported having seen it, and
so did Olaus Magnus. It was 200 feet
long and 20 feet around, and had a
playful habit of rising up like a mast and
snapping ships’ crews off the deck. In
1734 it was seen by Hans Egede, the
Greenland missionary. It had whiskers
like Henry Parkes and caused storms. It
hung around Boston 150 years ago for
so long and was seen so frequently by
citizens returning from the lodge that it
was called the American sea-serpent. In
the early days of Tasmania it put in an
appearance under the name of bunyip
and used to carry women off to its watery
abode The sea-serpent has a very large
capacity, and in 1817 several eye-wit-
nesses testified to seeing it swallow a
large whale.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: An innovation in British
golf is the playing professional. Only
two have so far taken office —one is
Alfred Padgham, who has won a British
professional championship ; the other is
Allan Dailey, another young star. Sund-
ridge and Addington clubs are the em-
ployers. It has long been a source of
complaint with club members that when
TEACHER : “How many I’s in ‘libel’ Phyllis—one or two ?”
PHYLLIS (whose father is a politician ): “Please, miss, free.”
their professional is a class-player he is
so much away at big tourneys that they
get little of his services. The pros, retort
that if they have to stick to teaching and
club-making they have no chance to

coaching and club-making to others re-
tained for the purpose, and will spend
all their time playing with scratch and
low-handicap members of their clubs, to
the benefit of all concerned.

“Ballisto”: Just before Christmas one
may expect sensational items in the cable
news. One that intrigued me was an an-
nouncement that a Dr. Gerlich, a Ger-
man who for some obscure reason con-
ducts his experiments in a “Danish arma-
ments factory,” has invented a rifle which
fires a bullet with a velocity of 4000
m.p.h. That means a muzzle velocity of
5866 2-3 ft. per second, which is nearly
twice as speedy as the projectile of any
service rifle with which I am acquainted.
At a sixth-of-a-degree elevation this gives
a range of over a mile ; at 45deg., 203
miles. I forget what the most fantastic
range the Krupp “Big Bertha” was
credited with, but it wasn’t half of that.
And the projectile has an explosive effect
on impact—“similar to that of the dum-
dum, but more penetrating.” Spreading
effect depends on the softness of the pro-
jectile, and softness is relative to speed.
It may be possible to make an alloy so
soft that on impact with even a soft part
of the human frame it mushrooms to
the size of a fist, and, with tremendous
power behind it, carries on clear through
bones. A horrible idea. More alarm-
ing is the reflection that, if such speed can
be imparted to a small projectile, bigger
ones can be given a greater effective
range. It isn’t the practice nowadays to
publish the muzzle velocities of service
rifles or ordnance, but a table compiled
in the late ’eighties contains the follow-
ing statistics: Martini-Henry rifle, muzzle
velocity 1315 ft. per second; Enfield-
Martini, 1570 ft. per second; 110-ton
naval gun (the sort that was mounted on
the ill-fated Victoria, in the days before
wire-winding) 2100 ft. per sec.

“Avon”: A gas-cylinder shipped in the
Marama from Wellington to Sydney has
been giving the M.L. police force a lot
of trouble. Acting “on information re-
ceived” the police raided the steamer just
before she sailed and attempted to seize
the cylinder. It was packed so deep in
the hold, however, that it couldn’t be
got at, though the Marama was detained
for hours. At Sydney “arrangements were
made” for the cylinder to be shipped back,
but apparently such “arrangements” were
disowned by the authorities, for M.L.
newspapers express surprise that the
article should be shipped back “in the
wrong direction.” When it reappeared
at Wellington, Customs officers gave it
an overhaul and found it was not the
sort of gas-cylinder to which they were
accustomed. It had a screwed-on end,
and, as the newspapers acutely pointed
out, it could have contained a vast quan-
tity of silver coin. It could also have
contained opium, dynamite, tickets in
Tatt.’s or frozen guinea-pigs, but these
possibilities weren’t mentioned. How-
ever, it was empty. Possibly it has, within
its outer and inner surfaces, a space,
sealed by welding, capable of containing
3000 British-minted shillings (which
would make its freight worth £lB7 10s.
in Australia) or again—and this seems
most likely—it may have been devised
for some quite legitimate purpose, which
has been satisfactorily explained to the
authorities. In that case the Govern-
ment has probably footed a sizable bill
for damages and wants the subject for-
gotten.
* * * *
“Dr. Nil”: The quaint second name
of the Lord Mayor of Melbourne,
obviously an altered form of “Gengul-
phus,” has some curious associations. In
the “Ingoldsby Legends,” in a foreword
to “The Lay of St. Gengulphus,” the
author points out that the name was
shortened, as time elapsed, into “Jingo”
and used so in the expletive “By Jingo.”
As time went on the quaint oath became
embodied in verses and songs, and finally
it became a dictionary word.

“Jo.”: Re that unfinished letter of
Nelson’s (B. 6/12/’33), there is a fac-
simile in Queensland Museum. Nelson
wrote it to Lady Hamilton two days before
Trafalgar; a postscript was added on
October 20, and at the end is a note by
Lady Hamilton: “This letter was found
on his desk and brought to Lady Hamil-
ton by Captain Hardy. Oh, miserable,
wretched Emma; Oh, glorious, happy
Nelson.” The original is in the British
Museum, and it is only a facsimile which
has found its way to M.L.
* * * #
“Addis Ababa”: The calling-in of reli-
gious experts to combat plagues and
pests is as old as history. Five hundred
years ago the Portuguese, who provided
the latest example when ants invaded
the town of Carvalhos (B. 29/11/’33),
sent a mission of Franciscan friars to
Ethiopia. While the missionaries were
there the land was overwhelmed with a
plague of locusts. The Abyssinian priests
tried all manner of exorcism without
result. In despair the King of Kings asked
the friars to have a shot at it. The leader,
Fray Pedro, asked that six of the most*
important-looking locusts among the mil-
lions covering the countryside should be
brought to him. This was done, and,
after a homily, he baptised them. The six
immediately took wing and, followed by
their vast host, departed toward the Red
Sea and were seen no more.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: Of all barbaric races
the Malayan has been least affected by
the depression or disturbed by the advent
of capitalised industry. The march of
progress has done little to wean Ahmat
from his rural pursuits, the migrants
from China, Japan and India supplying
the > demand for artisans, shopkeepers
and coolies. The area of land owned
and cultivated by Malays is the same
now as 20 years ago. Seventy per cent,
of Malaya is still jungle, and when Ahmat
loses his employment as sais, soldier or
sailor, the only occupations he finds
congenial, he is quite ready to go back
to the land and make it support him and
his family. Most adult male Malays
own plots of land, ranging up to four
acres, either a legacy from parents or
their wife’s dowry, and these plots are
now as productive as cultivation can
make them. Some plantations include
rubber, and, even at the present low price
for latex, Ahmet, who does his own tap-
ping, can clear ten dollars an acre. With
a little mixed farming on the side he has
enough to live on.
* * * *
“Sutor”: Cobblers should stick to their
lasts. Octogenarian Augustine Birrell, who
died in England the other day, was a dis-
tinguished man of letters who turned to
politics, like John Morley before him.
Like Morley, too, he rose to high office ;
but his fall was one of the sensational
events of the war period. For nine years
Birrell had been Chief Secretary for Ire-
land when the Dublin rebellion of 1916
occurred. There had to be some scape-
goat, and the Chief Secretary was the
obvious one because he had not foreseen
the trouble or taken any precautions to
prevent it. So Birrell paid the penalty
for relying too much on his subordinates
and not investigating conditions more
closely for himself. He made one not-
able utterance before resigning his office
—“I was always suspicious of what might
be happening in the cellars of Dublin.”
But his unreadiness probably deepened
the British distrust of scholars and Uni-
versity professors as practical men of
affairs.

“Sandig”: “L. R. Russ” (B. 6/12/’33)
mentions only one race where youth is
preserved at the expense of the aged.
Actually, there are many. In the Balkan
war of 1912 the Montenegrins invariably
selected aged men for hazardous enter-
prises. The principle may appear brutal,
but from the racial viewpoint it is
entirely logical.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
A Pioneers* Who’s Who
One of the best pioneer records yet
issued in Australia is Jane Black’s
“Queensland Pioneer Book,” which has
been published by the Country Women’s
Association (N. Queensland Newspaper
Co.) in aid of the N.Q. Pioneer Women’s
Memorial Home. It contains 100 closely
printed quarto pages of biography illus-
trated lavishly with photographs, and is in
itself a memorial which recalls at every
turn mighty figures of men and roman-
tic figures of women whose names are
part of the northern legend.
No Australian author should be with-
out this book, for it has the material of
a novel on almost every page of its 97
articles. What a gallery! All the Ann-
ings are here, and the Athertons, Jar-
dines, Kennedys, Edkinses, Mclntyres,
Beattys and Clarks of Mirtna. Here,
too, are Tom Collins and Christison of
Lammermoor, the Currs of Merri Merri-
wah and Donners Hill and Cardigan.
The tall figure of J. R. Chisholm (“Along
the Line”) comes to the banquet, and
Bartley Fahey, who died peaceably at
his own table, over 90 years of age, a
few years ago, after having lived
northern history through all its course.
In their company we find Richard
Daintree, graduate of Cambridge, ex-
plorer and trail-blazer, whose name sur-
vives tacked to a region which can breed
as big a carpet-snake as any in Australia.
That fine old white-whiskered pioneer
Ezra Firth, one of Dr. Lang’s ’Forty-
niners, who lived till 1910, looks
solemnly from a page holding his silk
hat in his hand. Nobody could guess
his history from his hat.
Firth was on Ballarat during the Eureka
Battle. Then he was a contractor at
Geelong, where he and his partner built
some of the earlier public buildings. But,
disagreeing with his partner, he gave him
the firm’s quarry and took the drays
and horses.
I fancy [writes his son] I can hear him say-
ing: “I will go where there are no b
partners.”
He did. He went to Brisbane and on to
the Limestone. He bought an old poley
dray and ten bullocks from Jim Cribb.
On the off-side bullock was a brass bell
that stayed with him the rest of his life.
Often when his sons were bullock boys
they heard it at three o’clock of a cold
morning as the old man stirred them into
life with “Why, you’ll sleep your brains
away!” Off for the North he and his
family set in their lumbering vehicle over
the lovely Toowoomba Range and up the
Dawson. They were on Dawson Downs
the day the blacks sneaked on Hornet
Bank and murdered the Frasers, and
Firth went out to disperse the murderers.
It could have been no fun in that jungle.
But Firth did not stay. Like Abraham
he acquired a flock of sheep and drove
them before his bullocks. He shore
them in Rockhampton and went on
northward —up to what they now call
Inkerman, up the Burdekin and over the
range to Ravenswood, on to the Burde-
kin again to join the Thompsons and
the Annings, over the saurian-infested
river, swimming the sheep. Through
-what were then savage wilds, he named
the landmarks as they went into the
basalt country.
There one day they came upon a
hundred natives stark naked who ran
-away when they saw for the first time in
their lives a man on a horse. They
cnamed the place, in 1864, Mt. Sur-
prise, one of the most famous stations
in the North. Mrs. Firth stayed in that
wild spot 17 years without once leaving
it, but Firth took his wool to Towns-
ville on a bullock dray, got 6d. a pound
for it, reared his family on it and lived
to be able to buy that silk hat. In-the
earlier part of his days on Mt. Surprise
he used to ride 60 miles for his mail,
which was left for him in a hollow log.
There was a happy ending. The old
people eventually retired to England, but
found that Australia still called, and they
came back to live quietly at Morning-
side, a suburb of Brisbane. Their family
is scattered the length of Eastern Aus-
tralia.
1 There are many stories like that in the
“Pioneer Book” and it has a decent
index to find them by. No book so fas-
cinating to old bush people has been
compiled since Mrs. Gunn wrote “We
of the Never Never.”
“X.”
A Northern Highway
“Watling St.”: There is a move in
Queensland in favor of constructing a
Great North Road from Brisbane to
Cairns. The capital has first-rate traffic
arteries to the west and south, but little
has been done towards establishing good
road communication with the districts
and cities along the east coast north of
the capital city.
According to the latest report of the
State Main Roads Commissioner, shire
councils are keen on helping. With a
good road running along the eastern lit-
toral of Queensland, the already con-
siderable motor traffic would be increased
a hundredfold.
In view of the policy of the present
Government and its predecessors it may
be expected difficulties will be put in the
way of the proposed road. Motor traffic
on other Queensland routes has been
practically exterminated by a foolish
Government policy which hopes to bene-
fit the rail services thereby. The expected
improvements have not made themselves
apparent, while public convenience has
suffered. Increased traffic from the south
which a road would induce would help
the railways, while a lot of business
would come to the towns and dis-
tricts through which it passed. Further,
and this should have its special appeal to
a Labor Government, the road would em-
ploy a great deal of labor for a consider-
“Cripes, I’d kick you in der pants if you wore any.”
able period and would set up a perma-
nent demand for workers in maintenance
gangs when it had been constructed.
“Nundah”: Following the departure
of C. E. Sligo, who edited the Bris-
bane “Mail,” Firmin McKinnon has left
the editor’s chair of the “Courier-Mail,”
to be replaced by one of the most glitter-
ing of Keith Murdoch’s satraps—a young
Englishman named Foster. McKinnon
becomes associate-editor, a position in
which he will be much happier because
it will give him time to devote to his
beloved literature. The paper already
shows the mark of the new hand. Under
the late Dickie Taylor’s regime, it blos-
somed out and grew quite giddy. Now
type headings are smaller and double-
column headings fewer and more re-
strained.
* * * *
“Vic”: The discovery of a picture of
Forgan Smith in kilts reminds me that
Queensland once had a distinct partiality
for Scottish Premiers. After the offi-
cially-appointed Herbert, there was a long
run of them —R. R. Mackenzie, Macal-
ister, Mcllwraith, Philp, Kidston, with
odd interlopers like Griffith and Palmer.
Forgan is an unlikely sounding High-
lander. His father was named George
Smith. He himself was educated in Low-
land Glasgae and in the territory of the
false, fair Campbell at Dunoon. I had
doubts whether he had a chartered right
to wear the tartan, but the Aberdonian
editor informs me that he is a true Hie-
lander and comes “frae Pairth.” Which
explains a lot of things. He who has
heard the Shorthorns calling to each
other in the Highland turnip fields will
know where Forgan learnt his oratory.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Darwin sporting circles have
been involved in a contretemps due to
the arrival of the new garrison, which has
shaken them to their very roots and at the
same time proved that old-world courtesy
is not dead. Two of the leading football
clubs are the Wanderers and the Buffa-
loes, and the teams which they produce
look like a human spectrum on the field.
Early this season the more rainbow-
colored members of the Wanderers were
disgruntled to find that their subscription
had been raised —a real hardship, since
most of them were on relief work, for
which the white Australians of the South
were paying. Then it was discovered that
Pearce had instructed his newly-arrived
army that they must not join sporting
teams in which colors were mixed. The
Filipinos, Malays and Chinks, upon being
apprised of the warriors’ embarrassment,
withdrew en bloc from the Wanderers
in order to allow Darwin for the first
time in its life to have a white team.
Then after mutual expressions of good-
will, and some recriminations in the press
about the “few members of the
Wanderers whose superiority complex
outweighed their sportsmanship,” the city
turned its steps once more towards the
dole office.

“Mag.”: Brisbane Hall clock is
the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
The height of the tower is 180 ft. ; the bell
chimes are 50ft. above the clock. The
four dials are 16ft. in diameter, or four
inches more than the Sydney G.P.O.
clock; the castiron faces weigh three
tons, without glass or fittings; the
minute hand is 10ft. long, the hour
hand 6ft. 6in.—they are of sheet copper
and run on ball and roller bearings. The
whole cost was £4185, with £25 annual
upkeep. Sydney’s G.P.O. clock cost
£5470 to instal, with a slug of £375
for yearly maintenance. Again, the time
mechanism of the Sydney clock is wound
weekly, and the chimes daily. The Bris-
bane clock is never wound, but is con-
trolled by a master pendulum, a dupli-
cate of the slave clock at Greenwich.

“Jerry M.”: When the Opposition re-
vealed some months ago that the Queens-
land Government was getting ready to
alter the electoral boundaries fixed by
its predecessors, the Forgan Smiths
furiously denied the charge. The cat has
now escaped from the bag. The report
of the Brisbane Civic Boundaries Com-
mission is to be made the basis of a re-
distribution, necessitating an increase in
the number of the State constituencies
from 64 to 65. At present there are 19
State seats inside the city boundaries, and,
as the Act amending the city constitution
calls for 20 wards, the new constituency
will be another metropolitan one. The
Forgan Smiths, already hold 13 of the 19
metropolitan seats.

“Clarence Strait”: It has been left to
the union stalwarts of Darwin to let an
invading foreigner see what a formidable
lot Australians are to tackle. When the
French survey sloop Aldebaran tied up
there the other day she wanted coal. The
skipper asked for coolies, and was in-
formed that only white Australians were
allowed on such jobs, and that wages
were ss. 6d. an hour, please, and no over-
time. Further, it was announced that
the coal could not be put on board at
a faster rate than 10 tons per hour. At
last advices the skipper was going
through his stock of French expletives
for the tenth time while the fuel was
crawling aboard.

The Queensland Industrial Court last
week varied the agreement between the
Mt. Morgan mine and its workers so as
to restore the 44-hour week instead of
the 48 worked hitherto. The co. opposed
the reduction on the ground that it would
increase costs and upset the schedule of
shift work and metallurgical control. On
the ground that the co. had improved its
position, the Court decided that the
shorter week should apply to all hands
on the mine—A.W.U. workers and
tradesmen. The fact that the mine has
declared a dividend of 2s. and that £1
shares were quoted at 595. influenced the
Court, in spite of the co.’s plea that it
had no reserves and was “living from
hand to mouth.”

“C. Coral”: Captain Cook monu-
ments? There is an appropriately situ-
ated one at Cooktown, where Cook
careened and cleaned his ship ; an irriT
posing affair of polished stone carrying
the inscription “In memoriam Captain
Cook, who landed here June 17, 1770.
Post cineres gloria venit.” There is also
a memorial obelisk on Possession Island,
in Endeavour Strait, where Cook hoisted
the flag and claimed for Great Britain
the slice of country stretching southward
from Cape York to New South Wales.
In later years, gold was discovered right
beneath the spot now marked as his
landing place ; the island yielded a con-
siderable amount. It is interesting to
speculate on how the course of Austra-
lian history might have been altered if
Cook had himself located the yellow
stuff.

“Knapp”: The oldest inhabitant of
Townsville, Mrs. Catherine Robinson, lives
hale and hearty at West End in her 96th
year. When she arrived at Cleveland Bay,
in the middle of 1865, the whole locality
was Crown land, although buildings were
going up to hold priority of various allot-
ments. Mrs. Robinson remembers clearly
such pioneers as Captain Towns, J. M.
Black, W. A. Ross and others, and
attended most of the early social func-
tions. The daughter of an Irish farmer,
she had always a strong inclination for
the land, and with her husband she
flourished in the dairying business and
reared a family. When she was left a
widow, she continued her enterprise and
acquired a large amount of property. Her
eldest son is St. John Robinson, who
introduced Spanish bullfighters to N.Q.

“Badluck”: A little known spot in
North Queensland is Day Dream Island.
The island was uninhabited 12 months
ago, but through the enterprise of two
returned soldiers it is now one of the best
tourists resorts in the North. It packs
more than a normal share of tourist
attractions into an area one mile and a
half long by a mile and a quarter wide.
Orchids and tropic flowers of every de-
scription grow in abundance. There is a
nice private yacht to go to the reef and
for fishing. You are shown everything
for a fixed price—no such thing as a
pound for this, ten bob for that, etc. It’s
a paradise for anyone who wants a holi-
day.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
To Stanhope Hobday goes the distinction of
being the first artist to hold a one-man show
of monotypes in Brisbane. Only 18 months
ago he decided to devote himself seriously to
this branch of art, and at his exhibition he
showed 53 good examples. Lord Mayor Greene
made the opening remarks. Art Society pre-
sident Cowell Ham came along with his wife
and shared in the greetings from the artist.
Particularly delicate was the light and shade
work in “The Two Gums.”
It has yet to be discovered who enjoys the
kindergarten Christmas parties the most —the
children, the teachers, the parents or the
Rotarians. The annual Christmas trees at the
various centres are happy affairs. The toys
come from the Rotary Club, and are distri-
buted by Rotarians. Premier Forgan Smith
found time to be present at Spring Hill and
West End. Mrs. Smith is the president of
the Creche and Kindergarten, so she had a
very busy time.
The Historical Society commemorated the
arrival of the first Governor of this State, Sir
George Ferguson, 74 years ago, with a party
at Newstead House. They decided that guests
must attend in period dress. Sir Leslie Wilson
was present. The Lady Mayoress, who was
saving her slacks for the seaside, arrived de-
murely curled and crinolined in pale blue and
silver. An amber ostrich-feather fan empha-
sised her coyness. President Inigo Jones moved
round with daughter Ursula, she in sky-blue
crinoline. Poetess Emily Bulcock delivered an
ode written for the occasion.
The kiosk up at White’s Hill was the spot
chosen by the Lady Mayoress for an end-of-
the-year party, most of her guests being wives
of officials. The camera obscura was soon in
action, and after they’d all had a peep Pearl
Watson and Cyris McColm provided music.
The Lud Mayor staged a rival show for his
friends the day before. He hostessed a jolly
luncheon at Mount Coot-tha, when long
speeches were prohibited.
Two of our largest emporiums have been
very generous in donating Christmas cheer to
the unemployed. One firm is providing 5000
joints of meat, and the other is giving hampers
to all who apply.
Lilian, the A. D. Walshes’ tall, slim daughter,
has packed her trunks, labelled them Singa-
pore, and, accompanied by her aunt, Mrs.
Western Walsh, of Southport, will step up the
gangway of the Nieuw Holland on Dec. 22.

/ have often seen tiny fish swimming up cattle
pads during heavy rain and floods, and after
the country dries these small fish lying dead.
Is it possible for fish to come down from the
clouds in rain ? —9282.
No, scientists say. But sometimes fishes are
carried in a willy-willy or a waterspout and
deposited some distance away, a factor which
seems of no small importance in the distribution
of our inland fishes. The fishes you observed
had probably lain buried in mud for some time
before the rain afforded them a chance to ven-
ture further afield, an opportunity readily
availed of by freshwater fishes when a drought
breaks or a dam overflows.
In what way has the “devil-devil” or melon-
hole country in North Queensland been formed?
—9133.
The alternation of wet seasons or floodings
on the one hand and of droughts on the other
induces characteristic alternations of depres-
sions and rises in heavy soils. These have re-
ceived various local names, of which melon-
hole, gilgai, Bay of Biscay, devil-devil and crab-
hole are the most frequently met. For further
information consult Bulletin 52 issued by
C.S.I.R. and proceedings of the Royal Society
of N. S. Wales, Vol. XLV, 1911 (article by Dr.
H. I. Jensen).
(1) What was the cause of the dispute be-
tween Governor Darling, of N. S. Wales, and
Captain John Piper ? (2) Was there dishonesty
on Piper’s part ? —9383.
(1) When Darling arrived in 1826 he almost
at once fell foul of Piper, who was senior naval
officer and president of the Bank of N.S.W.
Darling considered that the bank had granted
its friends “great and improvident accommo-
dation,” and that the Naval Office (partly
because it was understaffed) had failed to col-
lect a good deal of revenue. In 1827, therefore,
Piper resigned his presidency of the bank, and
was retired from the position of naval officer.
(2) No charge of that sort was made.
What part did William MacGregor play in
public affairs after he ceased to be Lieut.-
Gov. of British New Guinea ? When and where
did he die ? —9360.
In 1899 he was made Governor of Lagos,
where he opened up large tracts of country
with roads and railways. In 1904 he was trans-
ferred to Newfoundland, where he endeavored
to stamp out tuberculosis, which was then over-
running the island. On Dec. 2, 1909, he be-
came Governor of Queensland, retiring in July,
1914. In April, 1911, he was elected first Chan-
cellor of Queensland Uni., which came into
being largely through his efforts. Towards the
close of the Great War his knowledge of Pacific
affairs was utilised by the Colonial Office in
considering the future of territories formerly be-
longing to conquered nations. He died at
Aberdeen on July 3, 1919.
How much would the sea have to drop to
reunite Australia, Tasmania and Papua ? —9359.
A fall to the extent of about 200 ft. would
reunite Tasmania and Australia, and a fall of
about 100 ft. would reunite Australia and Papua.
Can the color of canaries be changed by
their diet? —9312.
If they are fed on ground cayenne pepper
with their diet they will get dull red in plumage.
The secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society,

indicate sources of further information.
When was Norman Lindsay’s “The Woman
I Was” cartoon published in The Bulletin

A TRIO!
We walk along tlie gas-lit street in a dreadful row,
we three;
The woman I was and the woman I am and the

Of the elements known to chemists only
16 have been found in the human body, these
being oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon,
chlorine, fluorine, phosphorus, calcium, potas-
sium, sodium, sulphur, magnesium, lithium,
manganese, silicon and iron. Only a very
small number of the above exists in the body
uncombined. Water forms about two-thitds of
the weight of the whole body.
Meaning and origin of the term “Jingo” ?
9333.
Modern application was borrowed from the
lines of a music-hall song by W. Hunt, popular
in London in the ’seventies, the chorus ol
which ran:—
We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo! if we do,
We’ve got tlie ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got
the money, too!
The term Jingo was used as a nickname for
those who supported Beaconsfield’s policy of
sending ships to assist the Turks against the
Russians. From this the term has come to
mean any person who advocates a bellicose
policy.

favor of the father, but on appeal to the
Privy Council this judgment was reversed.

A brief life-history of Edgar Allan Poe ?
£Bl9.
Born in Boston, Mass., January 19, 1809.
Parents were actors; both died two years later.
His godfather had him schooled in England
from 1816-1821. When 16 Poe entered Vir-
ginia Uni., where he remained for only one
session. He disappeared for two years; it is
believed that he went to Greece and took
part in the struggle for independence. In
1829 he returned, stayed at home for
a year, and then was entered at West Point
as a military cadet. His ambition was now
towards literature; he disobeyed orders, and
was dismissed. Disappeared again. In 1833
he won a prize offered by a Baltimore news-
paper for a story. Lived by writing. Married
a cousin in 1836. She was in constant ill-
health, and caused him much anxiety. In
1847 she died, and he followed her two years
later.
(1) How to clean metal files ? (2) How to
resharpen them ?— 9384.
(1) Vigorous application of a file card (wire
brush) is usual small-workshop practice. For
wholesale operations strong nitric acid is used to
clear tin, lead, copper or brass, and blue vitriol
to remove iron or steel cloggings. For zinc
dilute sulphuric acid is used. After any of
these treatments rinse in water, brush vigor-
ously and dry in sawdust or by burning alcohol
on the file. (2) Ordinarily this is not worth
while. If new files are not procurable, clean
with hot water and soda and then connect them
to the positive pole of a battery in a bath com-
posed of 40 parts sulphuric acid and 1000 parts
water. The negative battery pole is connected
to a copper spiral surrounding the files but not
touching them. Immerse for 10 minutes.
Where can I obtain books giving directions
for the repairing of (1) clocks and watches, (2)
sewing machines, (3) typewriters ? —9135.
(1) From Dymock’s, Sydney, “Clock Clean-
ing and Repairing” and “Watch Cleaning and
Repairing,” 2s. 6d. each. (2) From Angus and
Robertson, Sydney, “Care and Use of Family
Sewing-machines and Their Attachments” and
“Sewing Machines,” by P. N. Hasluck, about
7s. 6d. each. (3) None in stock. “The Book of
the Remington Typewriter” and “The Book of
the Underwood Typewriter,” both by M.
Crooks, price 4s. each, may be imported
through Angus and Robertson.
Annual sum expended, according ; to the last
balance sheet issued, by each of trie six public-
libraries in the respective capitals of the Com-
monwealth on (a) periodicals ( newspapers,
magazines, etc.) and (b) books ? —9342.
Only cases in which items are separated are
Brisbane, new books £54, periodicals £155
(1931-32), and Hobart, new books £429,
periodicals £59 (1931). Sydney’s aggregate ex-
penditure (books, periodicals and binding) was
£4690 (1931-32); Melbourne’s, £5604 (1931);
Adelaide's, £1792 (1931-32); and Perth’s, £516
(1931).
(1) Has any attempt been made to reform
musical notation ? (2) For what new methods
has music been printed ? —9372.
(1) Many schemes have been devised. To
describe them would occupy most of this page.
(2) There have been various publications. The
longest-lived enterprise traceable at this date
is the method sponsored by the London “Maga-
zine of Music” (long dead) in the late ’eighties.
Using the customary stave for pianoforte music
—five lines in treble and five in bass —there
was substituted for the conventional signatures
at the beginning of each bar a vertical reproduc-
tion of the keyboard. Black notes straddled
the lines; white notes occupied the spaces. The
double white-note gap between B flat and C
sharp was represented by a space of double
distance. Several compositions in this notation
were published, but nobody loved it.
Is there a market in Australia for silk pro-
duced at home from silkworms ? —9356.
No regular market. Society of Arts and
Crafts of N.S.W., 8 Rowe-street, Sydney, may
be able to direct you to individual buyers.
What is the rule for using a fullstop after
an abbreviation ? —9380.
Use it only when the abbreviation concludes
on a letter different from that which ends the
original word, as in “in.” for inches and “Lat.”
for Latin.
An American magazine mentions an Aus-
tralian fish, Gobius lidwilli, as beings one of
the smallest in the world. What is known
regarding it ? —9368.
It is plentiful around oyster-covered rocks
near Sydney, is full-grown when little more
than half an inch long, and is one of the
smallest of the vertebrates.
The N.S.W. Public Trustee is managing an
intestate estate on behalf of three orphans.
Can the eldest obtain his full share of the
estate when he reaches 21 years of age, or has
he to wait until the youngest (a girl) is either
married or 21 ? —9256.
A frequent provision in wills is to bequeath
the property to trustees to convert and invest
it for the benefit of sons at 21 and daughters
at that age or marriage, in equal shares. Power
is also usually given to apply the income of
any child’s share for his or her maintenance
until age is reached, or marriage in the case
of a girl. Sometimes the division of the
estate Is postponed until the youngest child
reaches majority. Here, there being ho will,
the Public Trustee, as administrator, may follow
some such course. That information can be
obtained from him alone. One of the bene-
ficiaries or their guardian could make the
inquiry.
What should be done with bulbs after they
have flowered —should they be dug up or left
in the ground ? I refer particularly to daffo-
dils, ranunculi and gladioli. —93l9.
Leave them until the foliage has thoroughly
died down. Daffodils, agapanthus, jonquils
and freesias can remain in the ground in-
definitely, provided bulbs are not disturbed.
Ranunculi, anemones, gladioli and lachenalia
bulbs should be dug every year and stored in
a cool shed until next planting-time.
My standard roses continually send up briar
shoots; how can 1 stop it ? —9307.
Dig away the soil and locate where the
“eye” or the briar starts, then either cut it
out or wrench it off. Make sure you get all
the growth out. If the cutting has to be
heavy, press clay or wet earth into the stem
to exclude air, and finally give the shrub a
heavy watering.
I have several cwt. of red oxide paint. (1)
How should it be mixed for use on a wooden
house ? (2) Is . there any way of brightening
the color ? (3) What colors would, you suggest
for doors, panels and verandah posts ? —9277.
(1) Assuming this is red oxide ground in
oil to a stiff paste, it should be reduced with
raw linseed oil. Add terebine driers, 1-pint
to a gallon of the oil used in reduction. If
the first coat is to be applied to previously un-
treated timber it should be reduced with a
1-pint of turpentine to the gallon of oil used
in reduction of the oxide. The second coat
should be the same, and the finishing coat
mixed with raw oil only, plus the driers. (2)
and (3) No cheap way of brightening the color.
The only way to relieve its appearance would
be to finish the barge-boards, window-frames,
verandah rails and posts with buff.
I have an engraving, “The Trial of Charles
I. in Westminster Hall, 1649,” by Thomas
Boys. What is known about the artist, and
what is the value of the engraving ? —9338.
A Thomas Shotter Boys, usually known as
Shotter Boys, exhibited in London between
1824 and 1873. He was chiefly a landscapist
in water-color and lithograph, but was versa-
tile, and may be the painter of the picture from
which your print was engraved. Cannot ex-
press an opinion as to value.
My son, who has just sat for the leaving-
certificate exam., wants to take the course in
economics at the Sydney Uni. He is destined
either for accountancy or general business.
What would a degree in economics be worth to
him ? —9329.
The University recommends the course to
young men intended for commercial pursuits.
It includes subjects such as accountancy and
commercial and industrial law.
Brief particulars concerning Tinian Island in
the Mariana group in the Pacific 7—9313.
Tinian has an area of about 20 sq. miles,
and is the home of great herds of wild cattle.
During the last 50 years there has been a con-
siderable traffic in beef between Tinian and
the neighboring islands of Guam and Saipan.
On Tinian also there are prehistoric rums, con-
sisting of a double row of truncated pyramids
of masonry. „
Difference in meaning between “accessary
and “accessory’’ ? —9093.
“Accessary” involves the notion of coni"
plicity, intentional aid or consent, as in he
was an accessary, if not the principal ;
or “this course has made us accessary to the
crime.” “Accessory” has no such implication
of consent. The term is applied to
things, as in “motor-car accessories.

“Juice”: An almost automatic bowser
has been placed on the market. All the
operator has to do is to put the hose-
nozzle in the fuel tank and set the quan-
tity of petrol asked for on a special dial.
The robot does the rest; pumps, mea-
sures, delivers to the car and switches
off.

“Bert”: Mysterious are the workings
of the minds administering the Sales Tax
Acts —there are nine, I believe. If you
go to buy a tool-handle you are told
it is free of tax, but tax must be paid on
the tool itself. Yet there are baffling
exceptions to the rule. I recently bought
a hoe; the implement was taxed, but
the handle was tax-free. But I had to
pay tax on a rake-handle because it was
attached to the rake!
To rescue the apple-growers of the Cab-
bage State from their parlous plight it is
proposed to encourage a taste for cider.
Cider is a better drink than most of the
synthetic orange and lemon drink pur-
veyed in Melbourne, where the only evi-
dence of the fruit is a ball careering
round in a machine. Cider requires a
special variety of tree, but other edible
apples can be included to make the
draught. Some English cider has a tre-
mendous kick, almost equal to beer. If
this variety is brewed it ought to be popu-
lar until the Cold Tea party gets to hear
of it.

“Gall”: A Melbourne firm has
patented a process for making printing-
ink out of old motor-tyres and other
waste rubber. Thousands of copies of
Australian papers have been printed
already with the new ink, which is now
being produced commercially. The
rights for overseas countries are being
eagerly sought.

“Bill Ding”: China is somehow finding
cash or collateral for the purchase of
great quantities of railway sleepers. In
Oregon alone over 2000 cutters are at
work on sleepers for China ; and 2000
men can turn out 4000 loads of Bft. 6in.
by 9in. by sin. sleepers a week. N. S.
Wales has had a few orders for China.
Westralia’s price has so far been against
her. But W.A. has secured an order for
300,000 sleepers for the Trans, railway
and another big quantity is in the offing.

After Melbourne’s Lud Mayor opened
this year’s safety lane where cars are
tested for the Christmas season, the civic
Rolls Royce was found to be suffering
from slight wheel misalignment. Last
year a few hundred car-owners submitted
to the test, but the vast majority, especi-
ally those with decrepit vehicles, stayed
away. As the safety lane is a voluntary
affair, its value is negligible. It doesn’t
touch youths who buy a wreck and sally
forth on Christmas eve, to the peril of
themselves and others on the road. Many
of these Burlington Berties never get 10
miles from the city; others reach their
destination never to return.
* * * *
The latest device for making central
safety zones in Melbourne safe for the
motorist and the pedestrians is a white
line drawn from the zone diagonally
across to the tramlines, so that one
driver overtaking another can be duly
warned. Some of the most notorious
zones now have as many gadgets on them
as a suburban picture theatre, but motor-
ists continue to pile up on them. The
trouble will never be solved until trams
cease to be moving obstacles to traffic
on the wrong side of the road. That
will be when there are railless trams
drawing up to the kerb. The central
space along which the lethal objects now
career will then be used for parking
cars. But tramway authorities continue
to believe in the ancient anachronisms.

“Sinbad”: Forged Australian wrappers
for Gyppo butter (B. 22/11 /’33) recall
a trick practised extensively in the Far
East a few years ago. After buying a
packet purporting to be “Three Castles”
cigarettes in Hong Kong one evening I
was surprised to find a second wrapper
inside the usual outer covering. Pic-
tured on this were “Three Kings,” com-
plete with robes, sceptres and crowns.
Closer examination of the outer cover-
ing showed it to be an exact copy of the
English brand with an addition, in very
minute print, of the words “Who live in”
immediately above the “Three Castles.”

“Arthur R.”: The dot and dash of tele-
graphy are gradually passing. At pre-

least eight carrier circuits on one indif-
ferent wire, and four Murray Multiplex
channels on each carrier, practically eli-
minates any chance of a breakdown. In-
cidentally, the present time of transmis-
sion between Sydney and Melbourne is
10 minutes for ordinary messages, against
two hours of not many years ago. One
result is that double-rate “urgents” are
becoming rareties.
Answers to Correspondents
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will
be taken of communications insufficiently
stamped. Name and address must appear on
the MS. No liability is undertaken re con-
tributions voluntarily submitted; and no MS.
will be returned unless stamps accompany.

of a hopelessly out-of-tune piano.... W.C. :
Unimpressive jingles... .F.W.S.: Indifferently
rhymed truisms C.E.0.: Poem on the
changing fashions in men’s collars needs starch-

other time... .T.S.C.: Can’t print your dog-

When hunger depressing o’ertook them;
The water they drank most commonly stank
When storms from the heavens forsook them.

plot H.Y.G.H.: Prefer stories with an Aus-
tralian setting... .S.T.Q.: The drum of oil at
the bottom of a well crops up too often....

Stop copying and try something original

Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one weeks
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
A Persian cat with sleepy eyes and the
silkiest of hair, price four guineas ; a
Sealyham, life size, bearing the modest
ticket of eight guineas ; and a dog, very
dashing but of unknown pedigree, that
might be the nursery pet in exchange
for £6, were expensive animals met in
the toy departments during the Christmas
shopping cyclone. Fortunately, m6st
youngsters prefer smaller, cuddley things.
Our own dear little teddy bears, now in
soft grey fur, are as popular as ever,
while a plump rabbit with tall ears, on
red rockers, raised a squeak of delight
from every baby beholder. Tall guards-
men with slim waists and towering bus-
bies and equally slim young pirates
with curling cutlasses scowl at one
another at the entrance to one of the
city’s treasure-houses; in another a
merry-go-round and a magic railway
travel gaily and continuously through a
forest of fir-trees whose fruitage is red
and orange and green. There are circuses
and wonderlands, wishing wells and
Santa Claus’s own workshop, and, worm-
ing your way through the crowds, taking
care not to tread on the littlest ones, it’s
hard to tell whether the baby or the
grown-up is enjoying Toyland the most.
The Independents seem to have struck
a Christmas winner in “Peter Pan.” The
Savoy on the opening night was packed,
fond parents bringing their youngsters
by the dozen. Most of them seemed to
agree with the Darlings that nothing bet-
ter in the way of nurses could be had
than a nice big dog. Anne Gordon is the
Peter of the production, and seems to
shoot upwards out of the picture, but is
otherwise very nice. Harry Tighe was in
the audience, and told of Peter Pans he
had seen the world over —in fact, the
only Peter he has not seen was the first
one, Nina Boucicault. Of them all he
liked the American Maude Adams’s
Peter the most. It was elfish, whimsical
and altogether delightful, and yet so dif-
fident was she of her charm and talent
she could not be persuaded to introduce
her Peter to London.
Maoriland waters will not lose many
big fish to the flies of the Percy
out of Northumberland; the young
duke and his colonel-companion are
staying on in Sydney till the 21st.
They will then go on to America, with
only the day or so of the boat’s stay in
Enzed. Mitchell, who has ushered the
great for many decades to their tables in
the Australia dining-room, must have
been quite pleased, these democratic
times, to net a full-fledged duke. When
the youngster was only to be here a day
and a half Government House was, in
its kindness, officially ignoring him, but
not so the press ; the young visitor was
chivvied relentlessly by male and female
reporters from bedroom to lounge, from
lounge to photographer’s studio. A visit
to the Jimmy Ashtons’ station (such
waste ; four bachelor sons make up this
family) was one of the most interesting
of the Northumberland experiences.
No vice-regal sheets were aired against
the arrival of the babe who grew in the
strawberry patch. The Duke of Northum-
berland was only to be a day and a half
in Sydney before rushing on to the lure
of Zane Grey and fabulous fish in Maori-
land waters, so he just flung his coronet
on the hallrack of the Australia. Of
course, when he decided to stay on
for a week, he and his chaperon,
Lieut.-Col. Henslowe, had bed and
board at Government House. Teeth were
gnashed at the Castlereagh-street hostelry
when it was found that not one of its
best suites was vacant. A bedroom
with bath was the best that could be
done for the illustrious; all the bed-
rooms with harbor vistas were occupied,
and only eyries with a bird’s-eye view
of the metropolis remained.
The Hugh Denisons gave a party in the
grand manner at the Rose Bay Golf Club
last week. It wasn’t necessary for them
to wait and see how Hugh’s libel action
against another newspaper would go
(he got a verdict for a farthing);
they just issued their invitations to a list
that sounded like pages out of Govern-
ment House visitors’ book or, if anything,
a trifle more exclusive. In fact, half the
guests who had previously been at the
Queen’s Club party bestowed their pre-
sence and smiles on the Denison refresh-
ments. The car was out in any case, and
the extra consumption of petrol was the
merest trifle. Pink and blue hydrangea
created a cool and soothing atmosphere
in the room where Hugh and his lady re-
ceived.
Lord Howe Island has had its first art
show. The exhibits were 16 glowing bits
of lagoon and beach, banyan, palm and
purple-shadowed hillside, done by Harry
Dangar during his five weeks’ stay on
the island. The inhabitants, who had
watched the work grow inch by inch and
had issued almost hourly bulletins as io
its progress, had politely intimated that
they’d like to see the complete issue. The
sitting-room at Kirby’s was therefore
hung about with the canvasses (Wal
Taylor saw to that part of it), and all
the island was invited. The occasion was
another excuse for one of the magnificent
Lord Howe tea-parties with their stag-
gering array of cakes and cream. The
only innovation was the first ice-cream
on the island, a freezing plant having just
been installed. Lord Howe people are
very polite and gentle. Nobody thought
of looking over the artist’s shoulder when
he was at work without a preliminary
“Hope you don’t think I’m sticky-beak-
ing, but I’d like to see how the picture
is getting on.” Even the cows were
gentle. They’d come and look over
Harry’s shoulder, and then turn and get
a bit of color into their own lives by
chewing the fringe of his gaily-striped
sketching umbrella.
Two years before the battle of Water-
loo the Benevolent Society of New South
Wales came into being, and ever since
its history has been one of continuous
service. In 1820 the name of Governor
Macquarie’s lady is recorded as having
given £5 to its Ladies’ Committee, which
was the first step in the District Nursing
system from which the Royal Hospital
sprang. Mothers and babies have always
been a special charge of the society, and
its present up-to-date baby welfare de-
partment is under the care of Sister Gladys
Wilkinson, who received her general
training at Balmain, studied obstetrics at
Launceston, and learned about child wel-
fare at Tresillian. The society has
emerged victor from its first 100 years’
war against sickness and poverty. By
your kindness it hopes to build up a
strong campaign in this its second cen-
tury of service to humanity.
The Wentworth was hung about with
scarlet “Q’s” when the Queensland Asso-
ciation had its last party of the year.
But the “Q” didn’t stand for quiet;
everybody was encouraged to make as
much noise as possible. As not much
could be done by word of mouth or
plain coo-ees, squeakers and whistles
were pressed upon each arrival, together
with a mask. These were worn till mid-
night ; then they were taken off and
there was more fun than ever. On each
table grew a little Christmas tree, some
crusted with frost, others golden with
tinsel. If you didn’t care to dance, you
played bridge. President D. S. H. More-
ton and Mrs. Moreton entertained a
group of bright young people; the
Hubert Fairfaxes and the Brigadier-
General Herring couple were other jolly
exiles.
Sydney’s Mayoress for 1934 gazes
serenely from this picture. She is Mrs.
A. L. Parker. Her Mayoral lord is a
partner in the law firm of Gibbs, Parker
and Parker ; and civic honors are not
altogether new in the family. Her grand-
father, Judge Josephson, was Mayor of
Sydney in 1848, the year in which the
first Town Hall was built.
As a sort of tonic contrast to the
seasonal head-hunting in the barnyard,
the lady assistant ethnologist at the
Museum gave a chatty half-hour on
head-hunting in Papua. Her hints and
recipes were first-class, and, aided by
slides, drove the lesson home so thor-
oughly that any of the human chamois
hanging on to the perilous glissades of
the lecture-room amphitheatre could now
not only hunt a head but preserve it
with the best. If you have never been
to the lecture-hall in the Museum, take
the children during the holidays for a
treat. You won’t mind the steps of the
gallery. They’re something like our tram
steps, and when you do leap nimbly to
a seat you can’t fall out, because there’s
a desk in front of you. Students think
the desk is for resting their notebooks
on, but the unscientific brain recognises
it as just another humanitarian scheme
for making the place safe for democracy.
In addition to learning how to hunt a head,
and why, a few hints on the cooking of
human flesh were thrown in. You were
told not only how to boil it, but how
to pick and choose it. And note this:
stringy subjects are no good.
The Queen’s Club had its twenty-
first birthday last week, and the members
turned up in great numbers and fluttered
with congratulatory chirps about the
rejuvenated dining-room. This had been
made bright with new furnishings and
decorations through the generosity of
some of the members, such as Dame
Eadith Walker, Mrs. Violet Bennett,
0.8. E., Mark Sheldon’s lady, and others
eager to play Santa Claus to their club,
one of the best-run in Sydney. Mrs.
Violet Bennett and the committee re-
ceived in a drawing-room around which
bowls of radiance roses glowed. The
Fuller and Sheldon ladies and Mrs.
David Maughan helped to speed the
party on its way, and around the tea-
tables in the bridge-room Dame Eadith
Walker, Mrs. Alfred Lee and her
daughter Muriel, Mrs. Roystone Davey
and Mrs. Ellison Rich were a few who
tea-and-toasted.
There is more brewing than actual bak-
ing going on in the rooms of the House-
wives’ Association. Trouble is being
brewed for those responsible for the price
of the loaf going up. The leaders have
sounded the tocsin, and if necessary every
member will bake her own bread rather
than hand out the extra halfpenny per
loaf. The Housewives had demonstrations
in the making of bread months ago, and
those who want it can have an excellent
recipe posted to them. Portia Geach,
Mrs. Duncan and Mrs. Mathieson have
their sleeves rolled up for the fight.
Another young Englishman of some
renown bolted through the Harbor city
the other day and made for Maoriland.
He’s not in the peerage, but he might be
described as a carpet prince. He is tall
and fair and has the perfectly-modulated
speaking voice. His name is Marchetti,
and he is a director of Crossley and Co.,
which firm has made carpets in Halifax
since the Saxon kings found a rush
covering on the stone floors of Merrie
England conducive to rheumatism. But
here’s the romance of it. The present
man of business studied to be an opera
singer, and music is still the art that
absorbs him. One of his uncles is chair-
man of the 8.8. C., and the artists and
conductors whom our own Broadcasting
Commission is bringing to Australia are
nearly all intimates.
Sophie, the younger daughter of Bel-
gium’s Consul-General Segaert, is one of
the reasons that have made this a good
year for the jewellers. Her diamond
cluster came from Fraser Wesley Coss,
barrister, of Wollstonecraft. “Quite the
best Christmas trade we’ve done for five
years,” exulted a Hunter-street jewellery
salesman to this Letter. “I sold five
engagement rings before lunch,” he
added, “and not a cheap one amongst
them.”
That ever-blooming spinster “Our Miss
Gibbs” withdrew temporarily from the
footlights last week, and took with her
from the Royal Cyril Ritchard and
Madge Elliott. They go off to America,
and their promise to return raised the
loudest hurrah from the crowds who
went to say good-bye to the popular
dancing partners. There was a tumul-
tuous final curtain, with speeches and
speeches, and, as everybody on the stage
and off it was already in the highest
spirits from Gus Bluett’s joking, sub-
urbanites in the audience completely for-
got boat and train timetables. There
were streamers and flowers and a pre-
sentation from “the girls and the boys,”
and then Madge and Cyril were chaired
and cheered all over again. Almost as
much gazed at as the principals were
Melbourne’s honeymooning Mayor and
his pretty Mayoress in one of the boxes.
Theatrical knight Ben Fuller and his
lady have announced the engagement of
their younger chick Fay to Joseph Berch-
mans Darby. The groom-to-be is an
Aucklander, which is appropriate, as the
Fullers started their theatre business in
Maoriland. Mendelssohn and ivory satin
ordered for early in the New Year.
The return of Kate Ogilvie is providing
the sports girl and the welfare worker
with a subject of conversation. Miss
Ogilvie has been secretary to the Rachel
Forster Hospital for a number of years;
sixteen months ago she went to England
to train as an almoner, and when she
takes up her job again it will be the two-
fold one of almoner and secretary. The
Sydneyite is a hockey enthusiast and was
Australian delegate to the international
hockey conference in Copenhagen, so she
has much to tell of the ball game, which
is popular even in such unlikely places
as Egypt.

Chatter
The Melbourne woman is up to her
eyebrows in shopping. She starts early in
the morning and staggers home hours
later, tired, with a smut on her nose and
with her expensive wave flattened under
a hat that has somehow slipped to a
drab angle. Man attacks the problem
differently. But he usually has less time
to spend and fewer presents to buy, and
is much more malleable in the sales-
man’s hands. If it’s to be a present for
his fiancee, he may solicit the help of
the fiancee’s girl friend —and what a
taste of power she feels! She can with
a flick of her finger dismiss everything
but the most exclusive, or she can croon
flatteringly over a little mediocrity. The
kids are having the time of their lives.
There are merry-go-rounds, slides
(diabolical inventions to wear out pants),
whirligig trains and camel rides all within
earshot of every big store’s Father Christ-
mas. That it’s a different old Santa in
every shop and at every Christmas tree
doesn’t perturb the young. Your
modern child quite understands that
helpers are necessary in the peak period.
If the postman hands you apologeti-
cally a scraggy package, its contents ooz-
ing through jagged holes, its address a
blurred smudge, you’ll know it’s a Christ-
mas present posted during Melbourne’s
epoch-making rainstorm. Its sender
probably waded the streets, dodging death
and showers of mud from skidding traffic,
with pulpy spring millinery and both
arms wrapped round a mountain of
parcels. Then came a crocodile for
weighing-in and another for stamps. At
this stage some of the parcels were prob-
ably dropped, so if something doesn’t
arrive from an expected source you may
blame the weather.
And it was weather. Gardens were
wrecked, waves howled over the kiosk
on St. Kilda pier, hot-water bottles were
filled, the lights went out and Topsy the
elephant, disgusted with the inhospitality
of mid-December, walked away from her
circus. She found a snug backyard, ate
a peach-tree and turned on a tap for her
going-to-bed drink. The circus people
scoured the country within a 20-mile
radius, but it was an early-morning milk-
man who discovered the truant.
The Morell lady garbed herself in Robin
Hood green and pinned a languorous
orchid near her throat to receive guests
at the Quamby Club. Daughter Sheila
stood alongside, her scarlet frock pro-
tected by a white tricot coat and a dash
of red upon her wide-brimmed millinery.
Early in the afternoon the lift plied up
and down with bridge players, the tea-
and-chatter people coming along later.
Roses and delphiniums made pink and
blue festivity on some of the tea-tables;
water-liles unfolded their creamy petals
upon others. Mrs. James Paxton, Mrs.
Pulteney Mein, some of the Syme family,
Aileen Lemon, Laura Nyulasy, Molly and
Kitty Agnew were a thimbleful of the
guests invited.
Guests arriving at No. 9 for cocktails
at the invitation of Mrs. Donald Mackin-
non and Mrs. J. S. Reid found them-
selves hurling felicitations at newly-weds
of an hour or so, Mr. and Mrs. Tristan
Buesst. This couple, having no hanker-
ing for a noisy wedding splash, put their
heads together and decided, as cocktails
were already in the wind, to mix them as
an informal wedding toast. They slipped
up to the Collins-street kirk, whispering
their destination in only a few ears. The
bride, who is Mrs. Mackinnon’s younger
daughter Marie, was given away by her
brother Euan. Her gown, a simplicity
of ivory faille, was girdled with a sash
of pale-lemon satin, and her wide-
brimmed hat carried organdie flowers.
Like a daffodil blown up the aisle was
bride’s niece Cecilia Reid in her golden
’maid’s frock. Mrs. Mackinnnon enter-
tained in caped draperies of black-
and-white, and a black sailor hat shaded
Mrs. Reid’s flowered ninon. A honey-
-1 moon to the British Isles is planned be-
■ fore the bride settles down to furrow her
brow with housekeeping.
Joyce Wilson’s party on Friday night
revolved round Alison Reid, who was
welcomed home with much gusto from
her foreign wanderings. For the frisk
Miss Wilson cut tall spikes of del-
phiniums and many roses to put a fes-
tive touch about her Berwick home. Soft
grey fur swung upon the cape of her ice-
blue gown. Miss Reid wore one of the
new knobbly black materials, its blush-
pink yoke shot with steel beads. Among
guests were the Norman Barrett couple,
Valerie Pratt, Geraldine Pennefather,
Elizabeth Mcßride and two or three
a’Beckett representatives.
The oldest auxiliary in Melbourne was
given a Christmas party by its president,
Mrs. H. S. K. Ward. No wonder its
title is such a prim Victorianism, for the
Ladies’ Aid has reached its forty-third
year of service. A dainty doll with a
cracker and lucky number hidden by her
trooped skirts stood beside each guest’s
teacup. Mrs. Ward had a Christmas sur-
prise of a crystal bowl, handed to her
on behalf of members by Mrs. David
Carnegie. The party was at the Quamby
Club.
Kay O’Loughlin celebrated her coming-
of-age by sliding into a coral-pink elonga-
tion of lace, its hemline ruched with
tulle, and giving a party at Grosvenor.
Sister Margot helped the revel in moon-
stone blue with flyaway sleeve draperies.
The girls, quite charming and very
polished, had the experience of a season
in London and much Continental travel.
Two more sisters are soon to go abroad,
and the fifth young heiress is still at
school in Melbourne.
The Wattle League said welcome to
the Con Daly couple—the lady is profes-
sionally Edith Harrhy—over teacups in
the Women Citizens’ rooms. Mrs. Daly,
who was bright as a sparrow after her
trip abroad, wore a striped tweed garment
under a chocolate-shaded coat. She
admits an operetta to the enlargement of
her repertoire, and said she was glad to
be back, for London is depressing with
so many out-of-work musicians. Mrs.
Britomarte James, in black, and Alice
Richardson, enveloped in a nutmeg
swagger suit, did the honors. Pink snap-
dragons and cornflowers made a splash
upon the tables, and Mrs. Daly went
home the richer for a sheaf of gorgeous
blooms.
Here is the Duke of Northumberland
having his first peep at Melbourne with
the sun in his eyes. To celebrate his
coming of age and in preparation for
his job in the House of Lords he is en-
joying a world globe-trot. His passion
for hunting—he missed this season in
England—was assuaged somewhat by
big-game hunting in Africa. His Grace
is a man of tact. He praised Perth for
its river and park, Adelaide for its
gardens, and said all the right things about
Melbourne, not forgetting a word of
admiration for Australian girls.
Victorians have been shocked to the
marrow by evidence given at the inquest
on an 11-year-old boy, an inmate of
the Seaside Garden Home for Boys,
Newhaven, who died of tetanus. Seven
boys swore that the lad had been ill-
treated in a barbarous manner by W. H.
Baye, the superintendent, when he first
developed symptoms of his ailment, and
there was corroborative testimony. The
superintendent’s defence was that he
thought the youngster was malingering
and that the allegations of cruelty were
grossly exaggerated. The coroner com-
mitted him for trial on a charge of man-
slaughter.
If, during next year, you see some
jolly youngsters cantering to and from
Toorak College in pull-on pants (de-
signed by themselves) over their school
uniforms you will know they are part of
the Bright family. Herewith is Mary,
one of the elder members, who is Frank-
ston’s best-known horsewoman. Since
her early childhood, when she clutched
her knees to a fat Shetland, horses have
played a prominent part in Mary’s life.
She grooms and trains all the steeds in
her riding school. Visitors to Frankston
keep her busy during the summer, and
Toorak College girls are among all-the-
year-round pupils. The Bright family
traces an ancestor who was founder and
first Master of the Badsworth Hounds
—a club notable in that it lays claim to
the oldest hunting song in England.
The playtime of Perth:
Parkerville Home’s coffers chinked merrily
as shekels poured in for the Jungle Cabaret’s
opening dance. The warm evening brought a
crowd to the open-air dance floor, where
festooned lights girt the surrounding trees and
rockeries. Mrs. Victor Harwood saw to things
in cherry lace, and from the Max Rutter
couple’s official crow’s nest winged Mrs. Max.
Mrs. J. C. Murray and Mrs. Stanley Burridge
fluttered sombre hues, Mrs. Harold Rowe’s lip-
stick laces were glimpsed near Mrs. Jackson’s
azalea-pink Chantilly, and Betty Merryweather
billowed pastel flamisol.
Trojan women paced gloomily to Beethoven’s
“Funeral March, of a Hero” in St. George’s
College quadrangle, and made atmosphere for
the unfolding of the sad tale of Troy penned
by Euripides. Florence Dain produced, and
mourned majestically as Hecuba; Martin Ketley
successfully doubled Poseidon and Menelaus;
Eve Clayton played Andromache and Winifred
Hill Cassandra. Arttst J. MacLeod designed
the effective costumes.
Pat Lang wisely enhanced brunette charms
with Benedictine sand crepe, backed by gladioli,
to pour sherry in Jean Hadley’s honor. The
bride-to-be perched a shiny lacquer bow on
nut-brown and oatmeal craquelle, and con-
cealed one eye with brown racello; Jean Lang
chinked glasses in tailored green-and-white-
checked tafietas.
Wassail, at the Pleiades Club, marked the
coming of age of Nancy Craven Griffiths, whose
marine-blue matelasse was agog with silver-
centred flowerlets. Mrs. Craven Griffiths bowed
greetings in cornflower-blue lace, and daughter
Mrs. Cecil Sweeting wore her fancy cap and
spray of living red roses with ivory chenille
georgette.
Cullings from many gardens went to brighten
the Karrakatta Club for the Oriana Choir’s
at-home. Tea and music made up the bill-of-
fare, with Marian Mendleson, Veronica Kenni-
well, Gwyn Brockway and Alan Smirke as
tunemakefs. President Miss Hamilton peeped
at her gift book in florally silk crepes, and sec-
retary Mrs. Cecil Treadgold pressed presenta-
tion roses against blue-and-white figured maro-
cain.
Oscar Wilde’s epigrams feathered “Lady Win-
dermere’s Fan,” played in the bustles of the
gay ’nineties, at the Repertory Theatre. Mrs.
Hubert Momber lent an eye for color and
design to the dressing, and an amusing touch
to the part of the voluble Duchess. Firm
ribs in the fan’s construction were Nancy Lee’s
Mrs. Erlynne, Tom McGregor’s Lord Augustus,
Thora Gray’s Lady Windermere and Gerald
Ruse’s Cecil Graham.
Missionary Lucy Prynn Jones, who has a
Boxing Day altar date with Rev. Lyn Brown,
hied her beige laces to St. Hilda’s Rectory,
there to be greeted by a Kaffir-and-biscuit-clad
Mrs. Patrick. Guests surreptitiously hid pre-
nuptial gifts of linen behind bowls of Cali-
fornian poppies and hydrangeas.
Diamond merchants are busy meeting the
demands of the end-of-the-season crop of en-
gagements. Knight Walter James and his lady
have promised daughter Judy’s hand to Barney
Walsh, of Northam and the Murchison ; Isobel
Goldstein and Gus Kreitmeyer are coyly re-
ceiving congratulations, and Peggy Stone and
Cyril Ryan, who both hail from S.A., an-
nounced their betrothal while Peggy sojourned
in hospital.
Adelaide’s pre-Christmas junketings:
Victor Harbor expects to be full to over-
flowing this Christmas, and Adelaide, like Lon-
don in August, will be very subdued.
The Victoria League gave a Christmas tea
to settlers’ wives and children in the Botanic
Gardens, when about 200 were entertained.
Mrs. George Morphett headed the committee
that had the arrangements in hand. Lady Hore-
Ruthven smiled upon the picnic.
We’ve had a week of amateur stage produc-
tions. Following on the successful run of “The
O’Brien Girl,” Nora Stewart’s pupils appeared
in “Divertissements,” Heather Gell presented
Maeterlinck’s “The Blue Bird” and the Uni.
Revue put on a very successful two-nights
show. If our theatres are to be unoccupied
by professionals nine months of the year well,
so much more fun for our youngsters.
The Uni. cabaret entertainment held on the
lawn and in the cloisters of the refectory drew-
a crowd of over 800, and the festivities lasted
until 2 a.m. The whole huge space was en-
closed with bunting and canvas and hung with
hundreds of colored lights and floating balloons.
Supper was provided by a committee of 50
women, and served at small tables round the
lawn, upon which a dance floor had been laid.
Dancing was also enjoyed in the refectory. Dr.
and Mrs. Rex Matters, retiring presidents oi
the Uni. Dance Club, brought a large party
of friends with them. Fancy dress was worn
by girl students, who acted as waitresses. The
men, mostly in flannels, wore gruesome masks.
Pupils of Loreto Convent performed a Nati-
vity play at Australia Hall. Lady Hore-Ruth-
ven and the Coadjutor-Archbishop were there.
Carols were sung by an invisible choir under
lhe direction of John Dempster.
Social affairs of the Speck:
Mrs. Spencer Parsons, of Wincanton, Huon,
gave an afternoon party at which Lady Clark
and Miss Macdonald, who motored from Gov-
ernment House, were the guests of honor. The
hostess was assisted by Mrs. Pixley. The Misses
Russeli and McGarry made music, and the
wide, enclosed verandahs and the drawing- and
dining-room were decorated with roses.
The Governor and Lady Clark went north,
attended by Captain Matheson, A.D.C. Lady
Clark, who had no official engagements, stayed
at the Brisbane Hotel, and his Ex. was the
guest of the Launceston Club, where he was
entertained at dinner by members.
Mrs. C. W. Grant, of High Peak, Mt. Well-
ington, was hostess of a combined bridge and
jigsaw-puzzle party at her pretty mountain
home. The rooms were decorated with yellow
broom, lupins, pansies and the red bronze of
the copper beech. Proceeds went to the Hobart
Free Kindergarten.
When Anne, younger daughter of Dr. George
Clemons, Launceston, exchanged vows with
Lawrence, son of Mr. and Mrs. B. P. Johnson,
Yarram, Gippsland, she wore patou-pink crys-
tal crSpe, cut on plain lines, with long sleeves
and hat to match. After the ceremony Dr. and
Mrs. Clemons entertained a small party at
their home.


Grievance Day.
[The person responsible for the sub-
joined report and sketches, perpetrated
after his one and only visit to the Vic.
Leg. Assembly, admits that he relied on
his memory for both, and that he was
never exactly a Datas; but he gave the
engaging assurance that they “sounded
like that.”]
Proceedings opened with a complaint
by a Cockychaff member (Mr. Broad-
“He had no grievances to-day except on
general principles.”
acres) in reference to the use of the gag
when the Gas Regulation Bill was being
discussed.
Mr. Broadacres said he wished to pro-
test against the high-handed action of
the crew of bullies who monopolised the
Treasury benches. {Laughter and cries of
“Order.”). Although he had voted for
the Government when it was in the right,
which was when it obeyed the dictates of
his party, he felt the time was now ripe,
in fact, rotten, for a reshuffling of port-
folios. He was open to offers —to appeals
—to serve the State in any well-paid
capacity. He had intended to say some-
thing about gas as his constituents ex-
pected it of him, and he knew a lot about
the stuff, having blown up the heater
only two weeks ago, but the dastardly
application of the gag prevented him
giving the House his views on a subject
about which he knew as much as any
member, which was exactly nothing.
Mr. Howling (Cockychaff party) sup-
ported the observations of Mr. Broad-
acre. The Gas Regulation Bill touched
his constituency nearly, because if it were
passed more money would go into the
pockets of the city monopolists who
sucked the lifeblood out of the backs of
“Made him despair of democratic
government.”
the farmers. {“Hear, hear,” from the
Opposition benches.) And they shared
their ill-gotten gains with the bloated city
workers. {Dissent from the Opposition
benches.) Opposition members could
“yah” as much as they liked, but all the
available cash was needed for the pro-
posed canal from Melbourne to Darwin.
His constituency was behind the canal
and also expected to be on both sides
of it, as it passed through his electorate.
It was a national work in the truest sense
of that much-abused word, because it
would divert all the vast trade of Asia
from Sydney and hence aid in restoring
the finances of the country. He had reli-
able information that a loan on attrac-
tive terms could be floated in Nicaragua.
Mr. Grogan (Grogan party) offered a
few remarks on the subject of war. War,
he said, was a reflection on our boasted
civilisation and ought to be stamped out.
Not that he was a pacifist. Far from it.
He thought those chaps with long hair
that went round preaching Love thy
Neighbor and Give the N.T. Away to the
Asiatics and all that sort of thing were
no good to any country. Bolshies every
one of them. But every man had a right
to his opinion. He thought the House
ought to pass a resolution about it.
The Minister of Disemployment said
he was in favor of the proposed Mel-
bourne-Darwin canal. The Government
had just turned off 2000 railwaymen and
the skeleton staff remaining was culti-
vating cut flowers between the sleepers
for the Lord Mayor’s Ball next year. Ali
the weeds had been dug up in the
suburbs, and although he was having
more planted they would take a long
time to come to maturity and some non-
productive labor would have to be found
in the meantime. He suggested that the
canal should be lined with marble.
Mr. Knix (Lab.) said that he had no
grievances to-day except on general prin-
ciples, so he would content himself by
saying that the Government was a lot of
swine, goats, cows, sheep, wolves and
running dogs of the capitalistic octopus.
The Speaker called Mr. Knix to order.
Mr. Grogan (Grogan party) caught the
Speaker’s eye again. He said war wasn’t
a solution of our problems. Look at the
last war now. Who had won that, he
wished to know? Did we win it? Not
much we didn’t. The Yanks did ; and
now we had to pay them for winning it
for them. Not that he had any objection
to the Yanks. They had their troubles,
but why did they want to come butting
in with their blanket codes and N.R.A.
and dumping their rotten wheat on our
markets, messing us all up just as every-
thing was going splendid? They were
a bumptious lot, in his opinion, and we
would have to take the starch out ot
them sooner or later and the sooner the
better. Not that he believed in trade
wars. It wasn’t the people who started
wars. It was the rich chaps on top want-
“Jack, you’re a genius !”
ing to grab other people’s property when
they had more than they knew how to
use already. They ought to be kicked,
the lot of them, like they did in Russia.
He thought the House ought to pass a
resolution about it.
Mr. Change (Ind.) suggested that the
Melbourne-Darwin canal be filled from
the Yan Yean reservoir, as that would
make the people drink beer owing to de-
pletion of the water supply and beer was
food as well as drink. He had this on
the authority of the proprietors of the
Footswick Brewery, which was in his con-
stituency.
The Minister of Education said that
listening to the previous speakers made
him despair of democratic government.
What was needed was more education,
and he had obtained the valuable co-
operation of the newspapers in starting
crossword-puzzle classes in all the schools
under his jurisdiction. He believed that
this would so addle the brains of the
rising generation that it would be safe
to extend the franchise to males of both
sexes over the age of ten and even
younger. {A voice: “Jack, you’re a
genius !”)
Mr. Grogan (Grogan party) said it was
a pity people couldn’t live peaceably to-
gether. Things would get a lot worse
before they got any better, what with
Lyons letting the Japs dump their cheap
labor goods in this country, matches that
“Get work!”
wouldn’t light and all that sort of thing.
Look at his (Mr. Grogan’s) underpants.
Last year he bought Australian ones
made by good union labor and they cost
6s. 1 Id., and this year he bought a Jap
pair for 2s. 3d. and just as good if not
better. How could our manufacturers
stand up against that sort of thing? No
wonder the workers were kicking. Good
old Billy Hughes was asking for a bigger
army and navy, and every man, woman
and child in the country was behind him.
Not that he thought a country ought to
take the law into its hands now that we
had the League of Nations, but there
were things no country ought to stand
and this was one of them. The House
ought to pass a resolution about it.
Mr. Badooze (Y.A.P.) asked the Pre-
mier whether the Government would con-
sider sinking a shaft under the Pacific
to facilitate the receipt of films from
Hollywood.
The Premier replied in the negative. It
was a Federal matter and Federal mem-
bers could be trusted to look after their
own affairs. {Cries of “Hear, hear.’’
“When are you going to let us raise
ours ?”)
Mr. Grogan (Grogan party) said the
House ought to pass a resolution about it.
“ You’re a bit stiff, aren’t you, Charlie ?”
Mr. Glanders (Y.A.P.) wished to refer
to the outbreak of disease amongst cattle.
His constituency was seriously affected.
{Loud laughter.) Members might laugh
if they wished, but if they meant to imply
that the electors of his district were
cattle, then he would say, advisedly, that
theirs were vermin. ( Cries of ‘‘Shame!”
“Withdraw !” “Yah!” “Get work !’’
“Gam !” Hisses, groans, catcalls, whistling
and confusion.)
The Speaker said he had never seen
such a disgraceful exhibition on the part
of honorable members. What would the
country think of them? If they didn’t
behave better he would order the worst
offenders to read all the bound volumes of
“Hansard” in the Parliamentary library.
(Cries of horror. A voice: “You’re a bit
stiff, aren’t you, Charlie ?”)
Quiet was eventually restored, and as
everybody wanted to speak on the Dog
Act Amendment Bill that important
measure was taken next. The discussion
was still raging when our reporter de-
cided that he had heard as much as he
could stand.
The Intruder.
BY NORA Me A ULIFFE.
AROUND the corner of Macleay-
street the boisterous September gusts
blew Monsieur Dulac nearly into
Darlinghurst-road. Monsieur Dulac was
small and of a somewhat flabby plump-
ness.
He wore a flapping black alpaca
coat above faded grey trousers, and on
his head was the smallest straw hat
Jenny Lester had ever seen. Around
the edge of its brim it had fragments
chipped out as though other winds on
other September days had chased it gaily
bowling down to Elizabeth Bay or Potts
Point.
But Monsieur Dulac had grown wise.
Hence the black elastic that tethered the
tiny straw lid to his great bald head.
The faded blue eyes behind their
strong lenses blinked at Jenny’s greeting.
Then the plump face became a voluble
smile. The parcel of French-books and
the exercise cover bulging with the so-
important fiches (innumerable scraps of
the backs of envelopes covered with
minute writing in French) were hastily
transferred to beneath the left arm, while
the right hand swept the straw hat in a
circle of greeting.
“But, Mamselle! This is an added
delight on a delightful day. To meet you
in your frock of rose! ”
In answer to Jenny’s question as to
how he did after his attack of ’flu, Mon-
sieur Dulac looked at her out of puzzled
eyes in which something like fear lurked.
“The ’flu? She is gone, Mamselle, but
the terrible dream she remain. This
dream, Mamselle, it is curious.”
“Curious, M’sieur Dulac?”
“Very curious, Mamselle. I wake up
in my little room, always with the
fright. There is somebody ; a stranger
has come in. Me, I am terrified of that
stranger, and I cry to my wife, though
she is since this long time dead: ‘Marie,
why is it you let this stranger into our
home? He wants to steal something. He
is a robber.’ Then I call to him in a
loud voice: ‘Go! ’ And I am up
in bed, and I am alone in the room.”
“It is the fever, M’sieu Dulac. You
are running a little temperature, per-
haps,” Jenny replied.
“Yes ; and my pupil will run a tem-
perature if I stay gossiping longer. Au
’voir, Mamselle.” And the little man, his
rusty alpaca tails blowing in the wind,
bustled off to give his next French les-
son, while Jenny went on her way to give
a massage, manicure and marcelle to the
daughter of a man who had once been
clerk in her father’s warehouse.
She thought of the old French teacher
from whom she had just parted—so gay,
so poor, so learned. Born to affluence,
his own too-easy credulity and a dis-
honest speculator had beggared him on the
great voyage which he and his bride had
been making before settling down to easy
comfort in their beloved France. Beg-
gary had stared in the eyes of these two
bewildered innocents after that terrible
discovery.
“And of that mine into which I throw
my money, Mamselle, there is not so
much as a ’ole in the ground,” he had
said.
Well, thought Jenny, life was like that.
And, then, turning around the corner
of Elizabeth Bay-road, she met Raymond
Jamieson.
Raymond was slim and upright, his
skin smooth, his eyes bright. His dark-
blue lounge suit was irreproachably
tailored. (Janet thought: “I wonder if
you do, as they say, get your clothes
from Savile-row.”) He carried a cane,
and looked debonair and a handsome
fifty. Even his intimates didn’t know
quite how old Raymond was, and his
white hair was the only mark Time had
laid upon him.
“Hello, Jenny!” he greeted her, and,
to her amazement, stopped to talk. As
a rule Raymond was much too magnifi-
cent to throw more than a greeting at
a manicurist, even if she had seen better
days.
They stood, a little ill at ease.
“I’m all right, now, you know,” Ray-
mond said suddenly ; “but I’ve had the
’flu'badly. It’s left me with a beastly
nightmare, though. Towards two o’clock
every morning I wake up, sweating, fear-
ful that there’s somebody, a man, in the
room. I know he’s a thief, and I find
myself out of bed and switching on the
light,« shouting, “Get out of here j I
give you four minutes to get out!”
“How curious, r Jenny exclaimed; “I
have just met Monsieur Dulac, the old
French teacher, and he was telling me
that he has been terrorised by a similar
dream ever since he had the ’flu.”
“Dulac,” muttered Raymond, with a
curious glance beyond her. “Dulac!
That’s a strange thing! ”
As Jenny gazed at him, she saw his face
take on the yellow tinge of age. The
eyes lost their sparkle. The shoulders
seemed to sag.
“Dulac,” Raymond Jamieson was say-
ing ; “I haven’t thought of him for years.
Dulac blames me, you know, for robbing
him of his fortune in the gold-mining
madness of”. '. . He stopped abruptly
and pulled himself togetter. Next in-
stant he hailed a cruising taxi, uttered
something gay about seeing her at the
races and was whirled away.
The girl stood still, .pondering. Dulac
and Raymond? Both old men. How
curious to think of Raymond as an old
man like Dulac! The one bone-poor, the
other sensuous with luxury, his nest
downy with the feathers he had plucked
from poor human geese. Yet, in the end,
to both the same dream, the same futile
effort to keep out the intruder.
Jenny knew in a flash what the two
old men feared the intruder would steal;
knew that they knew but were afraid
to utter the intruder’s name.
It was a hard winter, that. Many age-
ing men went under. ’Flu had left its
mark on them; ’flu in the worst form
known since the epidemic of 1919. Over-
strain, over-exertion of weakened hearts ;
and then death.
Two days later Jenny read in the paper
that both Raymond and Dulac, the one
in his luxurious flat warm with flowers
and rugs and silks, the other in the bare,
cold room above King’s Cross, had died
suddenly during the night.
O Passionate Lips.
O Passionate Lips, be still!
Plead ye no more for favors, weave no words
To tempt me far and farther on, until
With hot rebellion from restraint I cry:
“Take from my lips thy long-beseeched reply;
Drain them of kisses! Wring their fountain
dry!
Let honor go, but take of them thy fill!”
—Lest I cry this, O Passionate Lips, be still!

Amberg'ris.
BY W. CHARNLEY.
PADDY MURPHY halted and
stubbed the greyish lump with the
toe of his rough convict shoe. But
he formed no opinion as to what it might
consist of until the Professor, who had
been stalking a seagull with the late
Warder Hogan’s carbine, caught up with
him.
“ ’Tis petrified soap,” Murphy then
hazarded.
The Professor broke off a small piece
and examined it carefully.
“It’s ambergris,” he said.
“Ambergrace! ”
“Yes. Do you know what that is?”
Murphy grinned. “That I do. Wasn’t
Mick Fahey full av the talk av it whin
he came back from Bateman’s whaling
parthy? Didn’t he reckin that if he
cud’ve found a dacent-sized lump it wud
av bought him a pasage to Ameriky in a
Yankee whaler?”
But the Professor was busy estimating
the value of the find.
“It would go over fifty pounds, I
should think; possibly sixty. And
matured stuff like this was selling at two
pounds the ounce when last. I was in
London. Say one thousand ounces —
two thousand pounds. What do you
think of that, Paddy? Here’s us on this
God-forsaken coast with treasure worth
two thousand pounds and nothing to eat
except mutton-fish and blackboy tops.”
“Whist, now, cudn’t a man take ut
back to ould Hampton and maybe buy
himself a free pardon?”
The Professor smiled cynically. “Do
you think we could get back? Anyway,
I’m thinking the only pardon we’d get
would be the parson’s, and we’d be wear-
ing a hemp necktie whilst receiving it!
A hundred lashes might clear us for
bolting, but it would be the gallows for
dumping Hogan into the river.”
Murphy’s eyes took on a shifty expres-
sion. “But ’twas yersilf that did the
job.”
The Professor waved the matter aside.
“We’ll both swing for it if ever Hamp-
ton’s lambs lay hands on us.”
“Why did ye do ut?”
“Because Hogan was going to send me
up for insolence and swore he’d get me
twenty-five.”
Edward Davenal, 8.A., one-time tutor
at Eton, now No. 5273, illegally at large,
cast his mind back twenty days to the
evening of May 20, 1863, when, seized
by a sudden murderous impulse, he had
jerked his heavy oar from its rowlock
and crashed it down on Hogan’s head.
In almost the same second he had
snatched the dazed warder’s carbine and
ammunition pouch, finishing the move-
ment with a sharp push which had
thrown Hogan over the stern of the
dinghy into the depths of the Swan.
Hogan had disappeared from sight
instantly.
“Phwat did ye do that for?” the
astonished Murphy, who rowed bow, had
gasped. But Murphy had not been long
in making up his mind: the carbine
helped him. “I’m wid ye,” he said.
After that they had hidden close under
a tree-shadowed bank until night had
fallen. Then, silent as ghosts, their row-
locks muffled with Commissariat socks,
they had crept down to the mouth of
the river, keeping well to the north shore,
away from the pensioners’ village on
the south side. The village was humming
like a hive of bees, stirred by the pros-
pect of reward for the capture of the
absconders, whose venture for freedom
was being announced by the dolorous
alarm bell tolling in the big prison on the
hill.
But they had got past before a cordon
of boats could be thrown across the
stream. Then, breasting the open sea,
they had rowed half the night to Carnac.
Midway across they had come on a
small schooner anchored in the Roads.
The sight of her riding lights had been
an inspiration. Pulling alongside, and
finding only a watchman on board, they
had demanded food and water, emphasis-
ing their request with the late Hogan’s
carbine.
A keg of water and a couple of bags
of biscuit, later to prove unimaginably
weevilly, had been the schooner’s dona-
tion. “And if they question you to-mor-
row,” - the Professor had advised, “tell
them we are going south to the Vasse to
pick up a Yankee whaler.”
“That I will,” the watchman had
agreed heartily.
Perched on the highest point of Carnac
the absconders had watched through half
of the next morning for the Zillah to
put out; hoping to see her make north-
wards since they had given out that they
were going south —for an absconder was
always credited with giving the direction
opposite to the one he really intended
to follow.
But the Zillah, even though she lay-to
and questioned the schooner, had sailed
away to the south, the sergeant in charge
of the pursuit evidently considering that
no absconder, least of all the Professor,
who knew his geography, would be so
foolish as to attempt the desolate coast to
the north.
Murphy had cursed the sloop roundly
as she sailed past in the near distance.
“Full to the gunnels wid dirthy pen-
sioners, and thim full to their necks wid
breakfasts av beefsteak and rum; for
it’s divil a man av thim wud sthart unliss
the rum-barrel was aboard.”
So, with the pursuit gone south, the
fugitives had to turn to the north. “How-
ever, we’re just as likely to pick up a
Yankee in that direction,” the Professor
had remarked optimistically.
But his optimism had waned as day
after day they had coasted along, seeing
no signs of human life.
Then had come the loss of their boat,
pierced through her thin planking by the
spur of a submerged reef. The injury had
not been excessive, but, without tools for
repairs, they had«been obliged to abandon
her. And in the excitement of the disaster
they had lost what remained of the bis-
cuits and the water.
Since then they had trudged along,
living on blackboy tops and mutton-fish,
the latter tough as raw hide when un-
cooked. Water they had found only
occasionally where some rocky valley ran
right down to the beach.
Now here was fortune ; mocking them.
Two thousand pounds.
Murphy shouldered the ambergris.
He was strong yet, and would retain his
strength. That morning they had devised
a way to cook their mutton-fish, pounding
it between stones until tender, then boil-
ing it in the dinghy’s bailer. Treated thus
it made a stew as nourishing as beef-
steak. To light a fire they flashed a spark
from the gun-barrel with a scrap of
quartz, using a pinch of powder and
some dry grass as tinder.
“That’s right, Paddy, don’t leave it
behind,” jested the Professor. “You
will be able to buy a fine farm in Tip-
perary with your share of it.”
Murphy grinned. But his rather obtuse
brain could see uses for the treasure
other than the buying of a farm. He
had been at the Establishment long
enough to see absconders brought in by
the score. And hadn’t the Comptroller
always impressed on the assembled con-
victs, waiting to see the business start
at the triangles, that it was impossible
to escape from Western Australia? Im-
possible, it was —unless one got the right
side of a Yankee whaler. He and the
Professor would be caught.
Twenty times a day he looked back,
expecting to see the Zillah rising above
the southern horizon. For when she
finished her search of the south as far
as the Vasse she would certainly go
north. And how useful then would be
the big lump of ambergris! With £2OOO
contributed to the treasury surely Gov-
ernor Hampton, hard as he was, would
spare poor Patrick Murphy, especially
when he had really been forced into the
adventure by the Professor, who for all
his polite ways of talking was one of the
biggest villains in the Establishment.
Though, of course, if they fell in with a
Yankee before the Zillah arrived it would
be all the better, for wouldn’t the big
lump of stuff buy himself and the Pro-
fessor a passage to America, and still
leave a few pounds to land with?
Buoyed up by such thoughts Murphy
withstood the heat and the heavy sand,
trudging steadily on, while at the rear
the Professor, with the carbine, kept a
keen eye open for feathered eatables.
For a week Murphy labored beneath
his burden, pillowing his head upon it
at night. Then, one afternoon, out of
the north appeared a sail.
Climbing the dunes, they watched until
the sail developed into a ship, three-
masted. Their Yankee whaler.
Gathering dry grass and thorn bushes
they made a smoke, sacrificing two of
their precious cartridges in their haste to
get it alight.
Their signal was seen. The ship hove
to ; men were lowering a boat. Rescue!
America!
But Murphy was fated not to see
America.
Reloading the carbine, the Professor
methodically shot him through the head.
“A terrible man to talk,” the Professor
reflected. “Besides, there was hardly
enough in the ambergris for three.”
Shouldering the treasure, he went down
to the water’s edge.
The whaleboat swung down the ship’s
side, touched water, and its crew gave
way. Intently the Professor watched,
his whole being thrilled with expecta-
tion. Here was freedom, life, coming
to him again ; and with enough money
left after he had satisfied the demands
of the Yankee captain to give him a fresh
start in a new world.
Steadily the boat drew nearer, the oars
dipping with the precision of practised
rowers. Two hundred yards divided the
Professor from certain freedom. One
hundred yards. Suddenly the boat
backed water and began to draw off
again. What had happened?
The Professor’s eyes swept the horizon.
Nothing!
Then a sharp challenge from behind
him caused him to stiffen. Uniformed
men were closing in on him: Sergeant
Tompkins of the Establishment and six
pensioners.
With handcuffs on his wrists and the
block of ambergris for a seat, the Pro-
fessor listened to the sergeant’s pleased
account of how the trail was run to its
end. “Seven days we’ve followed you,
off and on, ever since we found where
you left the boat. Then we saw your
smoke and took a short-cut across the
sandhills to nab you before the Yankees
got in. The Zillah will be along to-
morrow to take us off.”
The pensioners buried Murphy in the
sand, each officially noting that he had
been feloniously shot through the head.
“They’ll hang you for that, Davenal,”
remarked the sergeant cheerfully.
The Professor shrugged his shoulders.
“Well, I’ve saved Paddy a scragging,”
he said.
Night came. The little company
camped on the beach.
Seated on the ambergris, the Profes-
sor thought hard. There might still be
a chance.
“Let me speak to you privately, Ser-
geant. I can make your fortune.”
■ Ordering his subordinates to recon-
noitre along the beach, the sergeant gave
ear.
“What is it now? Have you found
gold?”
The Professor nodded. “Something
just as good. Two thousand pounds it’s
worth at the lowest, and it’s yours if you
only leave the handcuffs loose on me
to-night.”
Tompkins reflected. “Two thousand
pounds, you say. Have you it here?”
“It’s right here.”
“I haven’t seen it.”
“Make it a bargain and I’ll lay your
hands on it.”
“ ’Twould need to appear an acciden-
tal escape, and we’d have to go after you
again,” the sergeant argued.
“I’ll see to that,” the prisoner urged.
“Done then! Now where’s your two
thousand?”
“Your hand on it,” demanded the
prisoner.
The sergeant made solemn affirmation.
The Professor was satisfied. “Well,
here it is under me. Ambergris! Do
you know it?”
Tompkins inspected the treasure. “I
know it!” he chuckled. “And it’s mine
now. We’ll have double irons on you
to-night, Professor.”
For once the Professor abandoned his
Cambridge polish for the vernacular of
the chain gang.
“Keep quiet, man,” snarled Tompkins,
“or I’ll have you gagged.”
Next morning the Zillah arrived, and
triumphantly the prisoner was shep-
herded on board, Sergeant Tompkins
following with the ambergris wrapped
in a blanket.
Once in the forecastle cells, with four-
teen-pound legirons to discourage all fur-
ther attempts to escape, the Professor
became resigned and cheerful. “You
don’t happen to have a dram of rum on
board, Sergeant?” he begged.
Not unwilling to oblige a man who had
supplied him with a fortune, the sergeant
complied.
“I suppose you’ve got a puncheon of
this in the storeroom?” queried the Pro-
fessor as he sipped the genial spirit.
Tompkins grinned. “Two! I ex-
pected a long chase, so I booked a couple
of big ones from the Commissariat.”
The Professor became confidential.
“You know, Sergeant, what they did
with Nelson’s body after Trafalgar?”
The sergeant knew. “Why, yes; they
put it in a barrel of rum.”
“Well, you do the same with that
ambergris. ’Twill preserve it, freshen it
up, and make it more saleable.”
“It will?”
“Yes ; and it’s a good way of hiding
the stuff, too, the rum being under your
care. And now I want you to put in a
word for me wherever you can.”
“That I will,” agreed the sergeant
heartily. “I’m sorry this has happened,
Professor. I see you’re not the sort to
bear a man a grudge because I didn’t let
you go as I agreed.”
“I understand your position, Sergeant,”
said the Professor gravely. “You had to
put your duty first. As for me, I might
as well do a fellow-creature a good turn
before I swing.”
“Duty first it is,” said the pleased ser-
geant ; “and thanks for your ambergris
and your hint.”
A month later convict No. 5273 lay in
one of the condemned cells at Fremantle.
He was philosophical about the affair to
take place the next morning. As he con-
fided to Warder Ryan, the Establishment,
since the advent of Governor Hampton
from Port Arthur, was by no means an
undesirable place to quit. Also the bugs
in the condemned cells, not being fed
quite so regularly as those in the other
parts of the prison, were extra voracious.
“A visitor to see you, Professor.
Sergeant Tompkins.”
Sergeant Tompkins stepped in. The
Professor smiled to see him, though he
noted an angry light in his visitor’s eye.
“What devil’s trick did you play me
with that stuff, Davenal? I opened the
cask to-day, and there was nothing in
it: nothing but all the rum spoiled and
turned to a kind of varnish.”
“The rum spoiled?” echoed Davenal
in pretended surprise. “Then you’ll have
to pay for it, for you drew it from stores,
and now I daresay your men won’t drink
it.”
“Five pounds it will cost me ; but I
wouldn’t mind that if only I still had
that ambergris. Where in the Devil’s
name has that gone?”
The Professor’s manner slipped back
to the days when he had worn a mortar-
board. “You have never attended any
science lectures, Sergeant; consequently
you never learned that all fats are soluble
in alcohol. Ambergris is a kind of fat;
rum is strong alcohol, as you are aware.”
“Then it’s all dissolved away!” gasped
Tompkins. “And you knew that would
happen, you beast, when you advised
me to put it in the cask?”
The Professor smiled pleasantly. “Cer-
tainly!” Then he lapsed a little towards
the manner of the chain gang. “Of
course I did. Did you think that after
I’d shot Murphy I’d let a dirty screw
like you get away with it, and after giv-
ing me the double-cross, too? Now,
bottle the rum off, and use it on your
hair, and see if it will stimulate the
brains in your thick skull. Two thou-
sand pounds’ worth of bay rum!”
The Professor chuckled so much over
the joke that Dutch Peter, in the next
cell, thought that he had gone slightly
mad from thinking over the coming
event.
The Voices.
Out of tune with life I seem,
Out of step with all the world,
Speeding far and fast,
As upon my balcony
I gaze down upon the sea
Questioning the Past.
Of all wondrous days I spent,
And all splendid ways I knew,
In the long ago —
Dawn and noon and eventide,
Spaces green and wild and wide,
What have ye to show?
“Have you quite forgotten me?”
Answer makes a long-dead Dawn —
“When ’neath skies a-blush
And through saplings, green and red.
Thrilled with love of life you sped
Through the Badger Brush.
“Hear you not those birds again
That I called to morning song
From their leafy bowers?
See you not the gems I threw
From my casket, gems of dew,
On the ferns and flowers?”
Break the waves on beach and bar,
As upon my balcony
From the world withdrawn,
Musing lone, I hear them sing—
While, no further answering,
Silent grows the Dawn.
“Have you quite forgotten me?”
Says a pale and perished Noon
Once that golden glowed—
“l it was who set a-blush
All the ways of Badger Brush
Where, a boy, you rode.
“See you not the trees again
And the hosted flowers that drooped
In a stirless swoon?”
And I see them, flower and tree,
See and smile, till suddenly
Voiceless grows the Noon.
“Have you quite forgotten me?”
Sighs a long-lost Eventide,
Once serene and fair.
“It was I who whispered ‘Hush’
To the birds of Badger Brush
When you journeyed there.
“Dream you not the dreams you dreamt,
As you watched the night draw down
And the daylight wane?”
Fades that Twilight, grave and fair,
Fades its voice on mystic air
But its dreams remain.

THE MEANING OF TUNG OIL
The following is reprinted from the leading Financial
Monthly in New Zealand—the “N.Z. Financial Times”
—and is published by Empire Tung Oil Products,
Ltd., for the information of the investing public.
‘The ‘oil’ itself is the product of crushing
the fruit of nuts of the tung-oil tree (Aleurites
fordii). The pure oil is clear and clean smell-
ing, something akin to salad oil, but it has
wonderful properties which make it essentia?
and indeed indispensable to modern industry.
“This ‘oil’ when heated, unlike most oils —
which get thinner as the heat increases—
thickens with the increase of heat until at 250
degrees C. it turns into an insoluble sub-
stance which is not only water- or weather-
proof, but is also an insulator and is acid-
proof. It is these features which make it so
extremely valuable.
“This is the electrical age, and electricity has
an implacable enemy—acid—in varying forms
and intensity. The use of tung oil in various
forms and compounds has been found the most
effective safeguard that modern science can
devise to counteract the deleterious effects of
acid as opposed to electricity or electrical
operations and appliances.
“Commercial aviation owes its possibility to
tung oil! This is not a wild statement, but a
fact. Duraluminium (the alloy from which the
structural components of airplanes and air-
ships are made) is so vulnerable to attack from
weather and the changing temperatures at
which the machines fly and land that it will
not last three months without adequate pro-
tection. Science has been unable to find a
more suitable protection than certain tung-oil
compounds.
“Commercial aviation without tung oil would
not only be prohibitively expensive, but dan-
gerous to life. There is a larger and more
vital issue behind this. Because the air will in
future be our ‘First Line of Defence’ tung
oil is now a munition of war—and yet the
British Empire does not yet produce an ounce
of the oil commercially. In fact, it is depend-
ent for its supply on the mercy of China!
“Is it any wonder that ‘The Empire Market-
ing Board’ is concerning itself, that the
'lmperial Institute’ brings out special reports?
rhat the British Government is concerning
itself? The Empire’s leaders are behind tung-
oil production. There is not an aeroplane
or airship frame and engine flying to-day under
the U.S.A. Government specifications which
is not covered with, and parts actually bathed
in, tung-oil compounds. Tung oil makes the
air commercially possible. Aviation alone,
which is just at its birth, is. perhaps as fine
an illustration as is possible to show how the
demand for tung oil will grow, and how tre-
mendous this market alone is and will be.
Although a volume could be written enumer-
ating the uses to which this wonderful product
can be put, space will allow of only one more
industrial example. So essential has this oil
become to the paint and varnish industry in
America, and so obvious was it to the leading
manufacturers that they could not depend upon
Chinese supplies for their requirements, that
they (the manufacturers) formed an association,
known as ‘The American Tung Oil Corpora-
tion, for the purpose of growing it.
“Now, after twenty-five years of growing
and cultural experiment, they have found, to
quote Dr. H. A. Gardner, their chief: ‘We
cannot hope to grow one-tenth of our present
requirements; we must look to the British
Dominions for our future supply.’ Here is the
leading authority in the world on tung-oil tree-
growing stating that America even must look
io the British Empire for nine-tenths of her
requirements. To quote ‘The Journal of
Chemical Education,’ printed and published
by the Johns Hopkins University, Vol. 7, No. 1,
Jan., 1930: ‘America for her present require-
ments needs 458,00* acres of full-bearing tung-
oil trees’ (producing 10001 b. of oil to the acre).
Dr. Gardner says that only thirty-five thousand
(35,000) acres arp available in Florida.
“But this is only U.S.A. What of Britain,
Germany, France, Russia and Italy, with their
teeming industries and millions of population?
“Then there are other industries, such as
motor-tyres, linoleums, artificial silk, artificial
leathers, waterproof coats, waterproof paper
containers and cement bags, motor brake
linings, etc. The market is huge—tung oil
is an absolute essential to many modern and
expanding industries of the world.”

Two Exiles.
BY BRIAN FITZPATRICK.
I MET a king once. It was within a
few hundred yards of the Soho lodg-
ing where, three days earlier, I had
had an experience of a humble Croat
who was in his way at least as interesting
as that saddened king.
I was raw from the Antipodes, and
the occurrence of the second adventure
on the heels of the first implanted in my
mind an idea, not yet eradicated, that
London must be the most romantic place
in the world. In the dead of night when
the West End had gone to bed, my poor
man could have shouted through a mega-
phone from his attic, shouted across Pic-
cadilly Circus, and my prince, listening at
the open window of his hotel suite, could
have heard him.
I suppose it was the incongruity of
their contiguity that stamped my image
of those two men of the Balkan Penin-
sula side by side on my recollection,
like two faces in the leaves of an old-
fashioned locket. For in Melbourne I
knew no propinquity of slum tenements
and exclusive hotels.
There were four floors, besides the
scooped-out gable where the Croat slept,
in the house in Great Windmill-street, and
a miscellany of odd-looking characters
paid or evaded paying rent for their
quota of its accommodation —about 800
cubic feet per person. For me the chief
attraction of Mrs. Levic’s establishment
lay in its handiness to the good cheap
restaurants in the little streets off Cam-
bridge Circus. Then, you could save
’bus-fares on the easy walk to Fleet-street,
where I sold stories with as little facility
as Mrs. Levic’s gentlemen paid rent.
I had seen about the premises, from
time to time, an unobtrusive grey man
who cleaned the boots, polished the
brasses, brought up laundry from the
“area” ; and did these and a hundred
other petty tasks with a demeanor so
docile, so apologetic, so sensitive to re-
buff, that you felt a harsh word would
bring the tears. When he spoke—that
was when speech was evoked by a pincer-
like tenacity in an importunate lodger—
he sprinkled his difficult phrases with an
even more generous salt of sirs than ;s
customary in the ill-regarded slaveys,
male and female, of that neighborhood.
At a cry of “Steve” from the bowels of
the house, he would drop rags and
brushes, and scurry downstairs like a
well-trained cattle-dog.
An underdog: I generalised quickly
from my rare observation of this indus-
trious humble being, and classified him
as that. But it was not long before I
witnessed the working in his interest of
the law of compensation formulated by
the old cynic of Ecclesiastes and
applied by Newton as the first law of
physics. (I think it’s the first law: “To
every action there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction.”)
I was submitting to an eightpenny
haircut in a dingy little barbery of the
neighborhood, when I caught sight of
the household slave in the next chair,
luxuriating under a penny hot towel after
a fourpenny shave and contemplating,
from his ministrant’s gestures, the extra-
vagance of a shampoo.
The barber was whisking my coat as
the grey man passed out of the shop.
He turned up the street that led home-
ward, and I followed, projecting an even-
ing with the typewriter after the Friday
fish. He should have taken the next
right-hand turning for home, but he
stopped short to enter the public bar of
the Red Lion—one of London’s great
herd of Red Lions. Lazily curious to
know how such a nonentity spent his
leisure, I opened the swing-door of the
private bar and ordered a glass of Bass.
“Awfa bitter!” I heard the barmaid
echo his order.
I thought I could detect in her voice,
as it came to me over the half-partition
between the bars, a semitone of reluct-
ance —foreboding,, was it? They had
met before, for I had noticed, looking
through the glass, an exchange of nods
on his entrance. However, he took his
bitter in well-spaced gulps, and, without
pausing for a second drink, made for the
street. It wds nine o’clock precisely.
I left, too, and finding the man immo-
bile outside bade him good evening. He
looked at me at first stonily, without
recognition, and then with a fierceness so
intense that I involuntarily side-stepped.
While I hesitated, feeling excessively
foolish, he set off without a backward
glance, walking steadily and rapidly
homeward.
I suppose I was ten yards behind him,
on the opposite side of Great Windmill-
street, when he mounted the steps. He
lifted a hand, and a bell rang in the
lighted basement, where, from the clatter,
Mrs. Levic was washing up. It would
be a few moments before she could
answer the front door, through the glass
side-panels of which the hall light shone
sickly.
The man raised his foot and with a
vigorous kick shattered the left panel.
His back obstructed my wide-eyed stare.
—I was all attention now —but he must
have inserted his arm through the break
and released the doorcatch, for the door
swung open. There was a babble of
voices in the hall, soon the sound of one
pair of feet marching steadily upward
and a lighter tread down, then a light
showed in the attic.
Poor devil! I thought. Must have
been drinking before he went into the
Red Lion, though indeed he had not
shown a sign of potations. There he is
in his attic. In the morning he won’t
remember a thing, and Mrs. Levic will
sack him.
I walked to New Oxford-street and
back again, and, resolved to the excuse
that I had mislaid my latchkey, rang the
l ront-door bell, with some nebulous pro-
ject of intercession in my mind. Mrs.
Levic opened to me, and I bobbed in-
quiringly at the ruined panel.
“Accident?”
“Not ezzac’ly, sir,” she said hesitantly.
She pushed the door to. “I ’ope as yer
won’t be vexed. It’s that irritatin’! Still,
yer better knaow, sir. That was Levic.”
“Levic! Your”
“Yus, my ’usban’. Yer must of seen
’im—’e’s the boots.”
“Oh. Well, what did he break the
glass for?”
“It’s Frid’y,” she said simply. I stared.
“Yer see,” she explained, “it’s drink
makes him like that. Not that there’s a
scrap of ’arm in ’im, like. ’E works ’ard
durin' the week, and I gives ’im a shil-
lin’ or two fer ’imself, Frid’ys. ’E goes
to the ’airdresser, reg’lar as clockwork,
an’ ’as a shave an’ shampoo. Then e
’as a ’alfer bitter at the Lion rahnd the
corner. On’y one, sir. It seems t’ upset
’im, like. Then ’e comes ’ome an’ rings
the bell, though ’e ’as a key. If I ain’t
right on the spot to answer, which I
cawn’t be constant on accahnt o’ me
duties, ’e ups and smashes the glawss.
“I cawn’t break ’im of it,” she assured
me earnestly.
“Why does he drink, if it affects him
that way?” (I asked the natural ques-
tion, though I never knew it to be
profitable.)
“Oh, ’e don’t, sir!” Mrs. Levic said.
“Don’t knaow, I mean. I does the boots
’stead of ’im, Saturd’ys, an’ ’e ’as ’is
sleep-in. W’en I fahnd aht he was took
so, I ’ad the glazier come fust thing
ev’ry Saturd’y. W’en Levic comes dahn-
stairs it’s mended, an’ ’e never says nuf-
fink. If I awsks ’im does ’e remember
what ’e done, ’e looks at me that ’ang-
dog I 'aven’t the ’eart to chide.
“It comes o’ marryin’ a foreigner,
like,” the poor soul concluded. “We
don’t understan’ them, an’ their ways
aren’t ahrs, an’ that’s all abaht it.
“1 gets a reduction of a tanner from
the glazier, fer a standin’ horder! ”
Thus the simple saga of the Croatian
slave, the mild rebel of one night and
one half-pint. Thus Stepan Levic
and the good Cockney wife who hadn’t
the heart to chide.
When I got up to my second-floor
front, I found on the table a thick cream
envelope with a tiny crest on its flap.
It had not been there when I left the
house for food and a trim, hardly more
than an hour before.
A 9 p.m. letter delivery. Home was
never like that (I still appreciated by
comparison, you see: the odious habit of
travellers who will not leave home). The
crest, I learned from the accompanying
letterhead, which I took from the
envelope, was that of Green’s Hotel,
W. 1 ; my correspondent was Howard
Hartmann, an American.* He was in
London again, from the Riviera, and he
would be honored by my company at
a meal, one day soon. Would 1 call in
any afternoon around four for a chat,
when we could make a date?
It was a smallish, brown-stone build-
ing in the Regency style that corresponded
with the address on Hartmann’s note.
When I called there on Monday after-
noon I was confronted by a manssr-
vant as I entered the thick-carpeted hall.
“Is Mr. Hartmann in?”
I fished out one of my new cards and
handed it over. He studied it as if it
bore a ducal name.

ƒ
Feilding (N. Z.) in the Seventies
Nearly 60 years ago, when the Bank of
New South Wales established its branch
at Feilding, the surrounding district was
quite undeveloped and consisted mainly
of bush and swamp lands.
Now, the town of Feilding, with its popu-
lation of 4,800, is the centre of one of New
Zealand's most productive districts,
almost every acre of which is farmed.
In this district, as elsewhere throughout
Australia and New Zealand, the Bank
contributed largely to development by
making available the finance necessary
for the transformation of virgin country
into fertile farm lands.
Bank of New South Wales
(ESTABLISHED 1817)
with which the Western Australian Bank and The Australian
Bank of Commerce Ltd. are amalgamated.

If any illustration in “THE BULLETIN” takes your fancy, write

“I’ll inquire, sir. Will you take a
seat?”
I did that, and, puffing at a Gold
Flake, took in the surroundings. The
quiet hotel was evidently a place of
some consequence. The dark furniture,
old oak, was spare and in a dignified
style. There was no obtrusiveness, none
of the Cecil-Savoy glitter. I had an im-
pression that here the working of the
machinery of bed and board was de-
cently bulkheaded.
The black-coated servant of my first
encounter returned with another a shade
whiter of face, a tone quieter of address.
“You wished to see Mr. Hartmann,
sir?”
“Yes.”
“Mr. Hartmann will not keep you long,
sir. He is with his Majesty at present,
sir.”
My Gold Flake suddently lost its savor.
I had an awareness of my grey slacks
and Norfolk jacket. I peered at the man,
I imagine, as if in question of his
sobriety or sanity.
“D’you mean that Mr. Hartmann is
with the King?”
“Yes, sir, and no, sir. Mr. Hartmann
is being given audience of the King of
Carinthia, sir.”
“Oh!” I was in a measure relieved
and deflated. I drew more confidently
on the gasper.
“The ex-King, eh?”
“Beg your pardon, sir, but at Green’s
Hotel we have no tidings of his Majesty’s
abdication, sir.” All most seriously.
“And you don’t notice vulgar gaffes
like revolutions.”
I should have continued in this vein,
but Hartmann came hurrying across the
hall.
“Well, now, this is just fine!” His
hand was outstretched in the familiar
to-do of how-d’ye-do that the friendly
American insists upon. “I’ve been look-
ing forward to this, I certainly have.
Come on up.”
He steered my shoulder towards the
stairs.
“But aren’t you engaged?”
“Not a bit! I had one or two little things
to canvass with his Majesty, but we’re
through. I’ve told his Majesty all about
you, and he’s awfully interested, awfully.
Now I want you just to meet his Majesty,
and then we’ll talk about old friends.
This certainly is great. His Majesty is
King Haakon of Carinthia —aitch-ay-ay-
kay-oh-en, pronounced ‘Hokum.’ His
Majesty is a fine man and enormously
interesting. Now come right in!”
This spate of words had carried us to
a closed door on the second landing:
evidently the king, like me, lived in a
second-floor front.
I mastered an impulse to giggle— that’s
what the sound would have been —as
Hartmann, with the lightest of prelimin-
ary rat-a-tats, opened it and preceded me
into a modest enough sitting-room. A
youngish, square-shouldered man in a
blue suit turned from the window and
walked quickly across the room.
“Your Majesty,” Hartmann pro-
nounced, “I wan’ to make my friend
known to you.”
“Charmed,” said the king, and, such
is the arduous breeding of royalty, he
looked it. I wondered whether I should
curtsey, and, if so, how. It would look
quaint, in flannels. After all, I had never
before been Made Known to a king,
even an ex-king in a blue suit. He
offered a hand. Should I kiss the ring
on it? Or had that to do with bishops?
I shook the hand.
“Mr. Hartmann tells me you’ve not
been long in London.”
“Not long, sir. About four months.’’
“Ah,” said the king sadly. “I have
been here four years.”
I decided it would not be proper to
commiserate, nor tactful to discuss the
prospects of the success of a Carinthian
counter-revolution.
“My friend is a noospaper man, your
Majesty,” Hartmann volunteered.
“Oh,” the king voiced disappointedly.
“What a lovely day it is for the time of
year!”
I believe we backed out.
After tea with Hartmann I made the
short stroll back to Soho.
Yes, my poor man and Hartmann’s
prince could have shouted messages
across the void of Piccadilly, but I doubt
whether they would have understood
each other.
The Oyster Bank.
BY J.H. M. ABBOTT.
IF you take a walk in a north-easterly
direction from Fort Scratchley at
Newcastle, you will presently find
yourself traversing the massive break-
water, built by convicts long ago,
that joins the mainland with the isolated
lump of sandstone and shale which has
been known as Nobby’s for more than
a century.
Between the lonely rock and Colliers’
Point, which the fort crowns now, there
was a dangerous sort of passage through
reefs which, to their very great peril,
small craft with hardy-minded skippers
used sometimes to navigate in entering
the harbor. The breakwater reaches out
nowadays far beyond the islet, and across
the channel the more recent northern
wall stretches to a point level with its
termination.
Three-quarters of the way, on the
northern side, the remains of the French
four-masted barque Adolphe, wrecked
there in 1904, have been built into the
breakwater, and it is just possible to
make out her bows sticking up above
the wall of piled rock as you look from
the south. Her bones mark the position of
the long-dreaded Oyster Bank, the grave
of many stout ships. Underneath her
forecastle lie forgotten skeletons of big
and little craft that came to grief there
in the ninety-odd years lying between
the foundation of the Newcastle settle-
ment and the building of the northern
sea-wall. The breakwater is their tomb-
stone.
It is a tragic spot, but once upon a
time a little comedy was enacted there-
about. The date of this performance is
somewhat vague now, but it was in the
early thirties of the last century, when
those smart packets the Sophia Jane and
the William the Fourth were trading in
rivalry between Sydney and the Green
Hills, as pretty little Morpeth, at the head
of the navigable waters of the Hunter
River, used to be called.
Although it was held that the coming
of the steamships was the beginning of
the end for sailing craft on the long coast-
line of New South Wales, many years
were to pass by before the little schooners
and ketches and cutters and luggers which
used to be built on the Hawkesbury and
the Williams rivers, and down at Jervis
Bay and on the Shoalhaven, were utterly
superseded by coal-driven craft.
Some there were who maintained that
the change from sail to steam was to be
immediate and complete, and that only a
year or two would suffice to drive the
windjammers from the sea-roads. Others,
who were right, held the opinion that the
sailing-vessel had still a good many years
of useful employment to look forward
to. Mr. Benjamin Walterus, the well-
known Sussex-street merchant, was a
leading light in the first-named school of
thought; Mr. Peter Doughty, the New-
castle ship-chandler, adhered to what
proved to be the more correct forecast.
Both were somewhat passionate and
peremptory in the advocacy of their ideas.
Mr. Walterus was interested in the newly
formed Australian Steam Conveyance
Company (1833), which had been estab-
lished by a number of Sydney merchants
for providing additional steam communi-
cation with the Hunter River, in opposi-
tion to the Sophia Jane and the William
the Fourth. Mr. Doughty was the owner
of the schooner Janet Doughty and the
cutter Allandale, trading regularly
between Newcastle and Sydney in the car-
riage of coal, red cedar and farm pro-
duce. It was his boast that his returns
from these two useful craft had not
been abated one farthing since the com-
ing of the steamers into the trade —a
boast which was contemptuously de-
scribed by Mr. Walterus as being nothing
but “a d d lie.”
There were many along the three rivers
—the Hunter, Williams and Paterson —
who were entirely convinced of the just-
ness of Mr. Doughty’s claim. But it was
a serious loss to that gentleman when the
Allandale ran herself on to the Oyster
Bank while attempting to enter Port
Hunter during a south-easterly gale at the
beginning of 1834. The sudden southerly
had caught her as she lay becalmed off
Nobby’s at slack water on a hot summer’s
day in the late afternoon, and had piled
her up in front of her owner’s eyes,
almost before her skipper and crew had
begun to realise what was happening to
her.
Into the new Steam Packet Inn, kept
by Michael Donovan, which stood not
far from the King’s Wharf at Newcastle,
came Mr. Peter Doughty and the master
of the wrecked cutter on the evening after
the disaster. Mick Donovan showed

Mrs W Mclnemey, 3 Broadstairs Street, Balmain, writes: “For a

Pills
them into a parlor, where, a little to
Peter Doughty’s annoyance, was sitting
Mr. Walterus, of Sussex-street, with a
couple of other gentlemen who had just
arrived from Sydney by the William the
Fourth.
“Be y’r lave, gints,” said the hospitable
landlord heartily, addressing those
already seated, with mugs of ale in front
of them, “Misther Pater Doughty, an’
Cap’n Tarban, who’s met wid such ter’ble
bad luck. Sure, ye’ll be knowin’ Misther
Walth’rus, sorr. Sit ye down, thin, an’
be aisy. An’ phwat’ll ye be takin’, gintle-
min?”
With no very good grace, Mr. Doughty
removed his top-hat and bowed to the
company. He recognised that the lurk-
ing smiles on the faces of these “steam-
kettle men” —his name for steamship
owners in general—were not unconnected
with his recent misfortune. Mr. Wal-
terus he knew, and Mr. Joseph Hickey
Grose, the owner of the William the
Fourth, but the other was a stranger —•
though he rightly assumed him to be con-
nected in some fashion with the new and
preposterous development in shipbuild-
ing.
“At your service, gentlemen,” he said
as he sat down. “Captain, what will you
take, sir?” he asked his companion.
“Nelson’s blood, sir—Nelson’s blood! ”
boomed the mariner gloomily. “ ’Tis ih’
on’y thing cheers me at all in me distress
—a drop o’ good Jamaicy. Try it your-
self, sir. ’Twill cheer ye up.”
“Indeed, Doughty,” observed Mr. Wal-
terus, “I think the captain’s right. No
doubt ye’ll need some strong stimulant,
after such a misfortune. Were I in your
shoes, I’m almost sure I’d be more
than half-seas over by this time. You
know Mr. Grose, I think. This is Mr.
Lowe, of Marshall and Lowe, the ship-
builders of Clarence Town, who are at
work on anew steam-packet in which
I have some interest. I think you’ll be
willing to admit now, Peter, that steam-
power has its advantages. Had your
cutter, the Allandale, been so equipped,
she’d have still been afloat. Now, if
the Allandale were my property, I’d get
her off the Oyster Bank immediately, and
then I’d”
“Get her off bed and!” interrupted
Peter Doughty scornfully. “Why,
her” He suddenly checked himself,
and stared hard at Mr. Walterus, a look
of inquiry in his face. “Look here,”
he asked, “how would you get the cutter
off the Oyster Bank?”
“Why, I’d ask Mr. Grose—no doubt
he’d do it gratis for a brother shipowner.
I’d put it to our friend, here, that he
might instruct Captain Taggart, of the
William the Fourth, to pan a hawser
aboard the Allandale at high-water and
pull her off. Perfectly simple. One of
the many uses of steam-power in its
marine capacity, my dear Doughty. Is
she quite sound?”
Mr. Doughty turned to Captain Tar-
bailj and that aJert sea man did not fail
him> for he saw the left eyelid G f the
Allandale’s owner blink rapidly twice.
“You think the cutter’s all right, Bill?”
~ , „ . * t *
Sounds a bell, sir. Not a foot of
water in th well. But th Bank s got
er » sir S°f, keeps. The first bad
weather, yell find her timbers strewed
along the Bight, twixt Nobby s an
Morna Point. That s all ye can look
f°r, sir. Steam-packet pull her off,
pooh!
Captain Tarban settled the question
with a snap of the fingers,
“Nonsense, Captain ; you don’t know
what you’re talking about. See here,
Doughty—what’s it worth to salvage the
cutter for you? I’m positive it can be
done. Come, be serious, and make a
bargain.”
Mr. Doughty shook his head in melan-
cboly fashion, and made a gesture of
d i ssen t.
“j agree w i t h Bill Tarban, Walterus.
it can ’ t be done. But if you believe it
possible, why not try it yourself? I’ll
seb you t h e cutter—hull, sails, gear and
cargo —as she lies on the Oyster Bank,
for £SO. Come, now, if you think so
m i g htily of these steam-kettles, here’s a
c h an ce of backing your opinion. You
can bave her, as she lies, for a fifty
punno te. There you are!”
“Done, begad!” exclaimed Mr. Wal-
terus exc i te dly as he produced a fat
ketsook- “ And here’s the note. Peter
Doughty you ’ re a f oo l. You’ll go to
tbe my f r i en d, if you’re incapable
ass i m ji a ting the wonders of scientific
knowledge . You’ve no idea of the
r of a ste am-packet. None at all.”
„ Maybe maybe not „ replied Mr
Doughty. “But I know the Oyster Bank,
Walterus. We do know something, don’t
we, Bill, about common ordinary things?
We’re no, such dam’ tools as we,, ook/
“I believe ye, sir, I believe ye! roared
Captain Tarban enthusiastically as h
poured out his fourth libation to mis-
fortune. “Here’s to your bargain, sir!”
he cried to Mr. Walterus.
“Come to my office” invited Mr.
Doughty, “and I’ll give you your receipt.”
Standing beside the building-slip on
that quiet reach of the beautiful Wil-
liams River, below the village of Clarence
Town in the following week, Mr.
Doughty—come there to order anew
sailing vessel from Messrs. Marshall and
Lowe, the enterprising Scottish ship-
builders—had some conversation with the
junior partner.
“Oh no, Mr. Lowe,” he was saying,
“I assure you you’re quite wrong. The
only trick played on Walterus was
done by his own enthusiasm for these
rattletrap steamships. The Allandale was
quite sound, and hadn’t a foot of water
in her, as Captain Tarban said. But she
lay across an old wreck in such a manner
that both the captain and I were con-
vinced that to kedge her off would only
break her back. That’s exactly what
happened after the William the Fourth
tightened the hawser and began to pull.”
“So that was the way of it,” said the
junior partner.
“Damme!” Mr. Doughty proceeded,
“I’ll never forget the look of Walterus
as she broke in two. Never in my life.
I stood beside him on the Macquarie
Pier, and, though I said nothing, he
looked at me as though he were about to
bite me. Oh, of course I can under-
stand how he feels about steamships. He
believes in ’em —I don’t. Sail will last
my time, Mr. Lowe. We’re not quite
done with it yet. But Walterus’s face, as
the Allandale’s starn slid into deep
water! A caution, it was! ”
“Ah, weel,” laughed Mr. Lowe, “I feel
for Mr. Walterus. I’m a guid Scot, ye
ken, Mr. Doughty. Feefty pounds ree-
presents a deal o’ siller.”
Overture.
A thousand birds are calling where
The shrill, sweet violins make sound.
The brass horns blare
Across the air,
And deep and round
With muted pain,
The ’cellos call again, again.
The trumpets cry with lifted voice.
“Rejoice,” they peal; “rejoice, rejoice!”
And, weaving in and out my mind,
The oboe’s husky voice behind
Is like a little wandering wind!

MYRA MORRIS.
A Summer’s Day.
A heatwave lay across the land
At early morn, by shoreward sand,
The lazy combers, listless, curled,
And Gippsland dreamed, a halcyon, world.
A teamster trudged with stoic stride
The lathered team he loved beside,
A pipe in waistcoat pocket thrust,
A whiplash trailing in the dust.
From forest growths a drowsy snare
Went out upon the heavy air;
Each little heated ether wave
Its wireless message surely gave:
One told of resin, scarlet-red,
By oozing bloodwoods thickly shed;
Some hinted of rock orchids; some
Proclaimed the wattle or the gum.
Aye, all those woodland odors blent
In one sweet reminiscence, sent
From hillsides and from creeksides lush
The perfumed message of the Bush!
From noontide till the mystic fall
Of day one rarely heard a call
From feathered throats, but when the lean
Tree shadows lengthened o'er those green
Flats glowing by Ginoa side,
A gang-gang from the grey box cried,
And on a dead limb once again
The kookaburra laughed disdain.
To shadowed pools, where silver musk
Spilled subtle incense in the dusk
With thudding footfall, fearful, drew
The timid, thirsting kangaroo.
And in the dark’ning twilight’s close,
A crimson disc, the moon, uprose
Above a still sea’s eastward rim,
With lunar mountains showing dim.
Their collar galls or caking sweat
The wearied team can now forget,
As in their nosebags through the night
They munch their fodder out. of sight.
His long head resting on his paws,
The teamster’s dog, with ready jaws,
But no assurance of reward,
Keeps, ever-faithful, watch and ward.
Where smoky lamps from rafters throw
O’er food and drink a welcome glow,
The wearied teamster, tall and thin,
His ease now taketh at his inn.
With pipe and gossip after tea
This bushman’s day may haply be,
Despite the goad of road and sun,
As fitly ended as begun.
VICTORIA.

Mirpil
Skin Balm
An Antiseptic, Cooling,
Soothing and Healing
Lotion
MIRPIL is- scientifically prepared to correct red
hands, chapped aAd chafed skin, sunburn,
burn, sore and tired feet. Will keep the skin so ft,
smooth, and does not stimulate the growth of ham.
Dries in a few minutes without leaving any gieas.i
after-effect.
HANDS ALWAYS WET,—There is probably nothing
more irritating to the woman who does her own
housework than the soreness and redness caused
by constantly having her hands in wat er. Some
times it may only be an embarrassment, but more
often it is a painful experience, especially in corn
weather- This can all be avoided by keeping a
bottle of MIRPIL bandy in the kitchen, and a. feu
times daily, especially after washing up and always
after washing, pouring a small quantity into the
palm and rubbing well into the bands.
ROUGH HANDS. —Besides frequently having them in
water, there are certain other classes of work m
the home, factory, garden and elsewhere which
roughen the hands of both women and men. the
amount of discomfort thus caused it is unnecessary
to describe. Those who are affected know it only
too well. When such a condition arises a few
applications of MIRPIL will be found to restore
the natural softness.
f
WINDBUBN AND SIMH : R>L—When the skin is
burned by either wind or sun. or both, one or more
liberal applications of MIRPIL will bring relief.
If the skin is too tender to bear being touched by
hand, lay a clean linen or cotton cloth, saturated
with the Balm, over the affected part. The ravages
of the sun will be modified if MIRPIL is applied
generously before exposing oneself to its rays.
TO MOTHERS. —Baby has to be bathed once or
more each day. and between times there is constant
washing of clothes, which tends to chapped hands.
There is no reason why a mother should not take
care of herself as well as the baby. Remember
that broken skin provides easy access for germs,
and it is of the greatest importance that the hands
be kept healthy and free from any eruptions that
might infect the baby, either through contact pi-
per medium of its food. Rub MIRPIL on the
hands frequently, and results will be found to
more than compensate for this precaution.
CHAFED SKIN.—In cases of chafed skin, MIKPIL
will prove an efficacious emollient.
SORE AND TIRED FEET.—Apply MIRPIL to the
soles of your feet when sore and tired. The relief
is wonderful.
MOSQUITOES AND SANDFLIES-MIRPIL smeared
on face and hands at night will keep mosquitoes
away. It also soothes mosquito and sandfly bites.
AFTER SHAVING.—A small quantity of MIRPIL
rubbed on the face after shaving will be found
soothing.
BEFORE applying powder, always rub
MIRPIL into the skin until dry. The cleansing
and cooling actions of this preparation will enhance
the comfort which powder provides.
Price, 2/C per bottle, post paid.

“THE DOUGHMAN”
By Robert Desmond Tate.
The Literary Sensation of the Year.
This is the Author’s brilliant first novel; it is the first of its kind among our
novelists. It translates, in terms of the sharpest realism, an aspect of life in the raw
—-in the sweat and steam, the stealth and sinister dealings that may form the
atmosphere of industrial workers, ft shows the reaction of a girl of clean character
and a man who, in other circumstances, might have been an inspiration to men.
The Press Gave Unstinted Praise to “The Doughm&n.”
“SYDNEY MORNING HERALD": “the most strikingly original Australian
novel to appear for a long time. Mr: Tate writes with vitality and conviction....
his relentless realism shocks the more fastidious readers. The descriptive work
is uncommonly good.”
“THE BULLETIN”: “the novel is a bold, dramatic conception, working up to
a spectacular climax....a novel witli the stuff of life in it.”
“THE TELEGRAPH" (Sydney): “the most distinctive piece of writing
evolved in Australia for many a long day it contains one of the most magnificent
portraits of a nagging wife;..-I don’t remember anything so good in any book
such a book as this would be a sure Book-of-the-Month in England.”
