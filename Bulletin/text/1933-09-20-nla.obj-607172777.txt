CHEMIST TELLS RECIPE FOR FAMILY
COUGH REMEDY.
HELP PEOPLE SAVE MONEY.
Here’s a recipe, given by a leading
chemist, that will enable people to make the
best family cough remedy, and at the same
time save much money. Everybody knows
that a good cough and influenza remedy
consists of two main sections:—
The first section is the undiluted med-
icinal ingredients; and the second is, of
course, the necessary water and sweetening.
The preparation of the medicinal ingredi-
ents requires trained knowledge, but the
water and sweetening can be added in the
home just as easily as in the pharmacy.
And you save a lot of money by doing so.
NW, prove these facts by trying this
HEENZO recipe: Into a jug put four
fablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either
treacle or honey, two of vinegar, and a large
breakfast cupful of warm water. Stir till
dissolved, and when the syrup is quite
cold pour into a large bottle, and then add
a tw r o-shilling bottle of concentrated
HEENZO, obtained from your chemist or
store. By doing this you will have a family
supply equal in quantity and superior in
quality to eight ordinary-sized bottles of
the best ready-mixed cough remedy, but,
if purchased in the usual way, would cost
up to £l. An outstanding feature about
HEENZO is the fact that it is a safe
remedy for babies as well as adults, and
over 12,000 people have written letters
proclaiming it the best remedy they have
ever used for quickly banishing coughs,
colds, croup, bronchitis, and influenza.—

HIS
BOOKS
Entertainment
Some books have the tonic effect of
medicine. The reader may be experienc-
ing the aftermath of an illness. Gloom,
fatigue, a tendency to recognise that there
is a lot to be said for annihilation. Then
he chances upon a volume which offers
a temporary escape from such miseries,
provides not only forgetfulness, but de-
light and laughter. Here are three that
can be recommended for the purpose.
The S.O. Mind
Compton Mackenzie’s Water on the
Brain (Cassell ; Dymock’s ; 3s. 6d.) is a
satire on the British Secret Service. He
revealed some worthless information in
a recent novel and was prosecuted under
the Official Secrets Act. This is his devas-
tating come-back. As the name implies,
it is an extravaganza, but anyone who
has read a serious novel about the Secret
Service —one of Buchan’s, for example
and who met a few dunderheaded staff
officers during the war will recognise
how near this is to life in the essentials.
Mr. Mackenzie’s method is one which
Anatole France employed effectively in
such works as “The Bishop’s Ring”; he
takes real people and makes them behave
a shade more idiotically in all circum-
stances than real people do as a rule.
It gives satire a surface appearance of
good-nature, but actually it is more
wounding than the vicious work of, say,
Belloc, whose High Church parsons, Jews
and profiteers are caricatures.
Major Blenkinsop is a retired cavalry-
man, ’loyal to King and country, con-
temptuous of officers in line regiments,
deeply suspicious of Bolshevik plots. He
is taken on the strength of M.Q. 99 (E)
under N. (cover for his old friend Nutting
of the 13th Lancers). N. is under a Lieut,-
General who is D.E.L (Director Extra-
ordinary Intelligence), S.R.D.M. (Safety
of the Realm Division, Military). They
are under P.—cover for one whose name
is of such importance that Mr. Macken-
zie withholds it in the public interest.
They are all like Blenkinsop: keen, con-
scientious cavalrymen; busy as wolf
cubs ; and on about the wolf-cub level as
regards mental development.
Blenkinsop, true to his word, refrains
from telling his wife the reason for his
mysterious visits to the Continent, and
she puts a detective on to him. The
detective is mistaken for the foreign
agent Katzenschlosser: a menace to Eng-
land, whose disguises are so numerous
and perfect that not even P. knows what
he really looks like. Blenkinsop’s investi-
gations in Paris and elsewhere cause the
S.R.D. people in London to suspect the
existence of a Scottish Home Rule plot,
and there are some amusing scenes in a
fashionable hydro, in the Highlands. The
finish sees the Empire saved and the
Secret Service happy in the knowledge
that its members have done , their duty
like pukka sahibs.
There are two or three dozen full-
length portraits. Renata, another
Madame Lupescu a gold-digging
cocotte while she has something to get
out of poor old Blenkinsop, a hard little
shrew when he has served his purpose—
is perhaps the best of them ; but they
are all masterly.
The U.S.A. Upper Classes
Murder Comes Home, by Nellise Child
(The Crime Club ; 7s. 6d.), is also funny,
but on different lines. No one outside
America has known policemen like the
hero, Jerry Irish, and his side-kick,
George Willard ; or a French maid like
Angele ; or a household like the Man-
sion, whose art-loving owner bites the
dust almost at once. But they are all
familiar to millions on the screen.
Lieutenant Irish was an all-American
quarter-back. His father, Dandy Jim
Irish, had been a cop before him, so his
rise in the Force was rapid. At the time
of the Mansion tragedy we find him with
his Sam Brown up. In mufti he is just
a quietly dressed young American aristo.
whose simple taste runs to “a tobacco-
brown cheviot
with a pink shirt
and strawberry-
colored cravat, a
golden-brown felt
adjusted over one
eye, and a thin
wrist-watch, sat in a Navajo bracelet of
hammered silver.” A Robert Mont-
gomery part. Fat, truculent George Wil-
lard is even easier to cast. A surgeon has
declined to say whether or not an acci-
dent-case will survive.
George caught his coat-tail and jerked him
erect. “Listen, you two-bed hospital smart
aleck,’’ he growled, “remember some healthy
guys wouldn’t have a bit of trouble laying
you out on your own operating-table”....
He tangled an enormous red hand in the
doctor’s coat and pushed his flat triple-chinned
lace within a few inches of the other's nose.
“If this guy dies before he gets to tell us what
made him do that bannister-loop, I'm gonna
give you the worst licking a cock-eyed guts-
scraper ever got.”
There are many other stock movie
characters and movie situations in Mur-
der Comes Home, but it is a first-class
thriller all the same. The author’s narra-
tive gifts are chiefly responsible. He has
a first-rate plot, and he manages to make
each chapter exciting, while the climax,
in which undesirables are exterminated
more or less indiscriminately, can only
be described as a blilherer.
Great Short Stories
J. C. Squire’s Outside Eden AHeine-
mann ; 7s. 6d.) is a collection of short
stories. They show one of the world’s
most versatile writers in every mood ;
satirical, comic, dramatic, even poetical.
“The Unwritten Story” contains all
lour elements. A novelist arrives as a
guest at a country house. He knows
nothing about the lives of his host,
hostess or fellow-guests, They ask him
to tell a story, and he begins one about
a novelist who, like himself, was asked
to tell a story. “What I’m going to do,”
he tells them, “is to make him tell a
story which will apply to some of the
people in the room. Everybody then
will become gradually embarrassed as
they realise this, only he will never realise
it himself, having no clue whatever to
the secret.” And he goes on to describe
the love affair of his hostess and a man in
llie room.
If it had been an ordinary intrigue
there would have been nothing moving
about his blunder; but, as he remarks,
there are some people “whose natures
are so fine that they are able to split the
difference, as it were, between renuncia-
tion and surrender.” Lady Hunter and
Geoffrey Poole are such people, and their
friends know it. One of them comes up
to the story-teller- afterwards.
“Did you say your novelist man will never
discover the howler he has made after he has
inflicted this dreadful evening on all these
people, and even risked giving the show away?”
“Good Lord no, sir!” replied Evans, sur-
prised to find that this .supercilious-looking man
had been listening at all. “It would spoil the
whole yarn if he discovered his bloomer.”
“I see. And is the old husband to have the
scales removed from his eyes?”
“Certainly not, and 1 don't see why he
should. After all he’s a simple old thing who
has never had the least suspicion of his wife,
whom he adores and who is sweetness itself to
him. Why, it would be quite tragic if I made
my story end by breaking his heart!”
“Quite right,” said Colonel Fox, “it would
be. Good night to you.”
“The Alibi” is a murder story about
people of the same well-bred, composed
kind, and most of the others are jokes at
the expense of literary and other
humbugs,.
An advantage of reading Outside Eden
i_n conjunction with the other two books
is that it differs from them in many
directions, while being as absorbing in
its way as they are in theirs.
RED PAGE.
Education at the Crossroads
Three years ago the writer initiated on
the Red Page a discussion concerning
the faults of present-day education. It
arose out of a review of an excellent
book by Dr. McQueen, “The Golden
Key.” McQueen, having been head-
master of a big school for girls, was in
a proper position to view the stupidity
of many of the educational requirements
demanded of the feminine sex ; but he
had committed the unpardonable fault
of being in advance of his time.
Officialdom moves but slowly, but at
last N. S. Wales has appointed a com-
mittee to inquire into the educational

syllabus. The committee is large, and
it is possible that some of its members
will know considerably more about edu-
cation after they have finished their dis-
cussions than they do at the present
moment. Things which might be worth
investigating are:
(1) The charge that secondary schools exist
only for the purpose of preparing pupils for a
university course, thus enabling the University
to dictate largely the curriculum of the schools.
(2) The insistence of the University on lan-
guages, especially dead languages, as a necessity
for matriculation, and its ignoring of scientific
subjects like biology as a similar necessity.
(3) Dr. McQueen’s statement that many
pupils learn far too much mathematics, and
waste time trying to acquire a nodding acquaint-
ance with algebra. “The solving of a quadratic
equation has very little bearing on life for
the great majority.”
(4) The absence of music as an essential
subject.
(5) The domination of classics in modern
school life.
(6) The educational requirements of each
sex. It ought to be obvious that the things
which a girl needs to know in after life
vary very greatly from those necessary for a
boy. In spite of this fact, the subjects demanded
of both sexes are practically identical.
(7) The place of biology in modern educa-
tion. We see the finished products of our
schools rush to the nearest dressed-up char-
latan to have their teacups read, their for-
tunes told, their ailments healed, or some such
foolishness, which should have died in the
eighteenth century.
The whole trouble about altering the
educational curriculum is that it inter-
feres with certain vested interests, which
naturally enough will fight to the bitter
end to retain their present place of
honor. It is sincerely to be hoped that
other interests will display an equal
amount of enthusiasm in forcing their
way into the educational limelight.
One last word concerning the medical
aspect of education. For the last few
years a great amount of attention has
been given to research upon the school
child. The tiredness or otherwise of a
school child is a matter neither for the
teacher nor the parent. It is a medical
question, which should be handled only
by competent, specially-trained people.
Recently, for instance, as a result of a
widespread British inquiry, it was found
that the vast majority of school children
do not get enough sleep, a fact which
may not be brought to light for long
years after school days have been left
behind. Any committee inquiring into
the question of education should include
a special committee of psychologists and
medical men, whose word on certain
subjects should be final.
K. B.
Amorality in Art
Archbishop Duhig is credited with
having said recently at St. Stephen’s
Cathedral, Brisbane, that “90 per cent,
of the novels and books written to-day
could be burned, and the world left none
the poorer.” His statement suggests that
the Archbishop has fallen into the error
(so common among ecclesiastical gentle-
men) of assuming that books should be
written primarily as vehicles for spread-
ing the doctrines of Christianity and
assisting in the moral reformation and
uplift of the people. Apparently he can-
not realise, or will not acknowledge,
that books (which include novels, de-
spite his implied differentiation) may
conceivably be written with the object of
entertaining and amusing.
Even so, the vast majority of contem-
porary writers to-day simply cannot fore-
go the opportunity of moralising, if in
ever so slight a degree. Even the de-
spised detective thriller is wont to preach
the old sermon that he who flouts the
law eventually must receive his just de-
serts. Every writer of sentimental
romances plays incessantly on the
theme of the triumph of virtuous-
ness and the utter subjugation of wicked-
ness. Far too consistently to be enjoy-
able does one encounter between the
covers of novels thinly disguised vari-
ations of timeworn axioms, such as “Be
sure your sins will find you out,”
“Honesty is the best policy,” “Virtue is
its own reward” ; and so on. Far too
sanctimoniously do some authors insist
that in the natural order of things eternal
damnation must follow the flagrant
breaking of one or another of the Com-
mandments. And how boring and
utterly meaningless has become all this
endless repetition.
This business of Bible-thumping under
the guise of entertainment has been going
on since mankind first discovered the art
of writing. It reached its most obnoxious
level towards the end of the nineteenth
century, when novelists had the impu-
dence to set themselves up in judgment
of the public morals.
In the last decade or so, however,
there has arisen a band of modern
writers who recognise the pulpit as the
pioper place for that sort of thing. In
their efforts to eschew moralising, and
in their scorn of the platitudinous cant
that has been drummed into the ears of
the people for countless generations, they
have unwittingly gone from one extreme
to the other, and evolved a code of
morality that is rather at variance with
the inflexible dogmas of the Church.
Whether they are right or wrong does not
matter. The great fact is that they do
not attempt to foist their theories on their
readers as indisputable truths, but are
content merely to present them as view-
points, worthy of consideration.
Their primary object in writing is not
to preach morality but to entertain. And,
even though a novel may not contain
any semblance of a spiritual message (if
such an ambiguous phrase is permissible),
should it succeed in taking away the
minds of a few thousand readers for a
couple of hours from the trials and wor-
ries of this complex affair known as Life,
then the world would have been definitely
the poorer for its non-existence.

Australian Celebrities
The new Who’s Who in Australia
(Melbourne Herald Press; Bs. 6d.) is
edited by Errol G. Knox, and is a con-
tinuation of Fred Johns’s well-known
work. The biographies in previous edi-
tions have been rewritten and brought
up to date, and many new ones added.
There-are about 3000 of them in all.
Almost 25 per cent, of the fentries con-
cern politicians, and there is a strange
lack of balance about the selection of
the rest of the material. Henry Handel
Richardson is catalogued ; Gilbert Mur-
ray is not. Surgeons like McCormick
and McKelvey are present; Howard Bul-
lock is absent. A lady who has written a
cookery book or two and founded a tea-
shop has a quarter of a column. Helen
Simpson, a great literary figure, and,
incidentally, a great culinary authority,
doesn’t appear at all. Most of our
famous cattle and sheep breeders and
judges have been missed, but heads of
country schools seem to have been con-
sidered eligible on the strength of a B.A.
and a past junior lecturership in a
teachers’ college. On the other hand, the
heads of public schools whose pupils’
names appear on every second page are
not mentioned.
There is not a Durack in the book, de-
spite all that North Westralian exploration
and settlement owe to living members
of the family. Mackay, who has added
more to the knowledge of Central Aus-
tralia, through his aerial work, than any-
body since Davidson and Canning, is
not there; neither is Austin, who led
the first expedition to the Star Moun-
tains (N.G.), nor Karius, who first crossed
Papua, nor W. P. Chinnery, who is
known as an ethnologist in every country
but his own. As against which, three-
quarters of a column is given to an
author of recent prominence, whose
peregrinations over tracks which other
people explored and made safe before
he was born are chronicled in detail.
And Don Bradman, judging by the space
which his cricket scores occupy, is the
leading resident of the Commonwealth.
But these absurdities are inseparable
from a work in which the subjects write
their own biographies.
A weakness of the book is its frequent
tendency to misspell well-known place-
names. One scarcely expects to see Cape
York spelt “Cape Yorke” in an autho-
ritative work, or the name of Mungadal,
one of the most famous stations in Aus-
tralia, rendered “Mungandal.” But per-
fection will never be reached till a dif-
ferent method of securing the material
is adopted.

A Satchel of Books
The Way of the Scarlet Pimpernel, by
Baroness Orczy (Hodder and Stoughton ;
Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.), reintroduces the
elusive one’s old enemy, Citizen Chau-
velin. But while Chauvelin respects
the gallant Pimpernel he despises and
hates Francois Chabot, his employer, and
the chief villain of the story. Chauvelin
is sent to intercept Josette, the heroine,
and seize the inevitable letters. In vain.
Chabot meets with utter and humiliating
defeat at the hands of a suave, self-pos-
sessed and efficient Englishman; the
young people are made happy; and the
mysterious Englishman turns out to be—
yes; you have guessed it. The romance
ends happily with the guillotining of
Chabot.
A Souvenir of Broken Hill confains
12 reproductions of etchings by J. C.
Goodhart, all but one of which (“Ruins
of Mt. Gipps Station”) depict various
aspects of the mines. Mr. Goodhart
was well known in S. Aus. as a painter
both in oils and water-colors when he
turned to etching, eight years ago. He
has been particularly successful in this
medium, and he is one of the few Aus-
tralians whose etchings have been hung
on the line at the Paris Salon. The edi-
tion, which has as a frontispiece a self-
portrait of the author in dry point, is
limited to 500 numbered and signed
copies.
Retribution, the Adventures of a Dope
Dealer, as related to Edgar A. Gornall
(Macquarie Head Press ; 3s. 6d.), is im-
pressive up to the stage where the dope-
dealer gets maudlin and reforms. A lot
of it reads like the truth. It is common
knowledge that a lot of cocaine is sold
in Australia at a huge profit, and the
methods of handling it which are de-
scribed here seem feasible. But would the
former dealer have dared to give away
the tricks of the trade? His first warn-
ing was: “If you are joining this organi-
sation to sticicy-beak, you will soon be
put out of the business —or worse.”
Anyhow, Retribution should interest
many—particularly the police.
A Despised Race, by E. R. Gribble
(Australian Board of Missions ; 4s. 6d.),
is a sympathetic study of the aborigines
by one who has lived among them for
nearly half a century. The grave of his
father, the Rev. J. B. Gribble, who was a
missionary before him, can be seen at
Waverley Cemetery (he died in Sydney)
with its tribute: “The Blackfellow’s
Friend.” At the time of the Rev. J. B.
Gribble’s celebrated libel case (which he
lost) against a leading Perth newspaper,
the family were in desperate straits.
The case for many months was adjourned
from time to time, and as he could not obtain
employment by the church, he and my brother
cut firewood for a brick-kiln at three and six-
pence a cord. I opened a school in a bark hut
which I built and had twenty scholars. How-
ever, as I could not get my money in, I had
to close the school. One poor woman made
me a couple of shirts as part payment of school
fees.
A very human and earnest book, and
a mine of information about a race that
we have managed to reduce by about
75 per cent, in a century.
There is nothing to upset the staunch-
est pietist in J. C. H. Sleeman’s Letters
to a Married Woman (Gordon and
Gotch; Alert Publishing Co.; 7s.
6d.), though the lady is not his
wife, and though he addresses her as
“Sweetheart” and again as “Cherub.”
Letter XX, for example, is 25 pages
long —say 10,000 words —and it is de-
voted to explaining why Mr. Sleeman re-
jects socialisation. A sentence in Letter
XXI begins: “However, my dear, let
me take you through the A.L.P. Confer-
ence from inception to close,” and he
proceeds to do it. No disturber of the
matrimonial peace, this, but a serious
menace to those who dislike having tor-
rents of language about every imaginable
subject hurled at them. The letter which
is likely to make the widest appeal, de-
spite its length (over 100 pages), is
XXIV. It is mostly composed of extracts
from the author’s favorite verse-writers.
Tsantsa, by Isadore Lhevinne (Cassell;
Angus and Robertson; 7s. 6d.), is de-
scribed on the flyleaf as “a novel of
adventure and passion in the. jungle.”
A girl came over with a bowl of nijaman-
chi Nauki raised his face from the big
block of camaca wood, out at which he was
hewing a cutanga.... Pale as guayusa tea,
Chingamai sat on the edge of the peaca.
When a novelist inflicts this kind of thing
on the writer in a language he can under-
stand, it irritates him, but when it is
done in the tongue of the Jibaro Indians,
whoever they may be, the thing becomes
maddening. And then there is the dia-
logue.
“This is Chingamai, my wife.”
“Eheheh.”
“She’ll stay with us.”
“Hmmmm.”
“She is the daughter of Caupi.”
“Ahem.”
“He is an amazingly brave and strong man,
and he has seven dogs.”
“Hah! Nunu! ”
A pretentious work, full of self-con-
sciously purple passages, and very dull
on the whole.
Tropic Equations, by Don Gordon
(Macquarie Head Press; 6s.). Ethel
Fraser, aged 40, leaves her husband
Donald, an island planter, for a holiday
in Sydney. At the Australia an elderly
gentleman, but winsome withal, works
an old one on her: —
She touched one corner of the handkerchief
as he held it out. Certainly it did not appear
to be very suitable from a practical point of
view.
The cavalier hesitated.
“Um-m, well it does appear rather a flimsy
thing. It would certainly not be of much use
in winter time when colds are prevalent. Buc
I am detaining you”
The cavalier is Sir William Lyster, Bart.,
an Island Judge. Ethel sins with the
baronet, and Don at about the same
time has an affair with Lady Lyster.
The plot is credible enough, and the de-
scriptions of Island life are interesting;
but, as in so many Australian novels,
the characters use ridiculously highfalutin’
language. Lady Lyster tells Donald that
they must part.
“They [the waves] are telling the story of our
love, dear; of the sea-drenched woman that
came to you for shelter and you gave her a
glorious Love and her heart’s desire It has
been wonderful, Man. Wonderful. But it may
not last. Your Eve must depart through the
gate, and leave all this behind her, taking
with her”
People haven’t indulged in these stilted
sentimentalities for quarter of a century,
and even then they only did it in melo-
drama.

IF BRUCE GOES.
Confronted with the growing demand
for a U.A.P.-C.P. Government with
Bruce as Prime Minister, Lyons and his
ambitious handy man, Archdale Parkhill,
have developed a keen regard for the
Constitution and its needs. They have
decided, on unknown premises, that for
the man they fear to remain in London
any longer would “infringe the principle
of the collective responsibility of Minis-
ters.”
Why a stay of 18 months or so when
there is London work for a Minister to
do should “infringe the principle” more
than a stay of a twelvemonth is hard to
guess. 'Australia had a Prime Minister
who, from early in 1916 till late in 1919,
spent most of his time abroad. It is not
on record that he was ever accused by
Parkhill of departing from “the prin-
ciple of the collective responsibility of
Ministers.” ,
It was understood quite clearly in Aus-
tralia that Bruce was coming back when
he had dealt with the conversion loans —
another has been successfully launched
—and thus rounded off the important job
which he went to London to do. Instead
of asking him to come back, Lyons talked
to him on the telephone, and, in effect,
invited him to resign from the Ministry
and accept what is the equivalent of the
Chiltern Hundreds for an Australian
Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was
in such a hurry that, as the friendly
“Argus” says, he “had not taken more
than two or three of his intimate asso-
ciates in the Ministry into his confidence
regarding the proposal.”
The propaganda which surrounds the
deal, the assurance from Canberra that
the High Commissionership is the highest
honor the Commonwealth has to offer,
is arrant nonsense. It has always been
the perquisite of the Reids, Fishers,
Cooks and Ryries—men who have be-
come too old for the whirl of active poli-
tics, or who, as a matter of political
expediency, are better out of the way.
Its unimportance is emphasised by the
very fact that, so soon as there was real
work to be done which called for a man
to take responsibility on the spot, it was
entrusted to no superannuated politician
in Australia House. A senior Minister,
the outstanding Minister, was sent.
The biggest task to be performed for
Australia at the present time is in Aus-
tralia. It is a task for a real leader and
financier —the best that can be got. Bruce
made his way in politics as a Treasurer,
and, taught by adversity and by experi-
ence in a trying situation, he could be
an immensely more useful Treasurer than
he was in 1921-22. If Lyons is honest
in what he is doing, and if his judgment
is sound, he must have a better financier
in view, a better understudy for his own
job.
Who is it? Parkhill? Parkhill was
the paid secretary of Bruce’s organisa-
tion when Bruce was Prime Minister.
He tried to get family endowment
adopted as a Federal policy, and threw
up his hat when it was inflicted on N. S.
Wales and financed by the craziest tax
in the world —an impost which penalises
employers for putting men on and paying
them good wages. There is not a trace
of statesmanship in Parkhill; he is a
vote-hunter and nothing more.
White? Casey? New hands with
some promise but no performance.
Pearce, Perkins, Marr? Mere stopgaps,
who are in their jobs because the claims
of their States must be satisfied irre-
spective of ability. Lyons himself? The
party of which he was a member for 22
years placed him in one of the minor
Commonwealth offices, made him Post-
master-General. Only his conversion
turned him into a financial expert, and
now even the worshipping flapper press
has discerned the wood through the thin
gilt on their idol of last year. “A wooden
man with a wooden expression,” one of
these journals calls him.
Let Australia look at these persons and
measure them against the greater lights
of Australian business: Lyons against
Davidson, of the Bank of N. S. Wales ;
any one of the rest against Essington
Lewis of the Broken Hill Prop., Gold-
finch of the C.S.R., the Baillieus. Only
one man in the Ministry measures up to
standard in this company, and the feeble
concern at Canberra wants to get rid
of him!
It is the irony of things that Bruce
has always been moved in politics only
by the initiative of others. He came
into unsought office on a request from
Hughes. He came into the Prime Minis-
tership on an urgent party call. He
accepted junior office after defeat. He
went to London willingly, and if he can
be persuaded that acceptance of the High
Commissionership is the best service he
can render the country he will probably
take it. If he does it will be a sad end-
ing to a promising career —the man is
only 50. Sadder still is the thought that
if Bruce goes Lyons and Parkhill will
blunder on until they hand Australia
over to Lang.
IS LANG AGAINST DIVORCE?
Divorce is a subject which Australian
Governments, ever mindful of votes, will
not touch. They consider it loaded with
dynamite. It devolves on private mem-
bers to strive for divorce-law amend-
ments when stirred by an irresistible con-
viction that such are required ; and on
these occasions, naturally rare, they are
regarded as taking their political lives
in their hands.
Moved by the unhappy condition of
N. S. Wales persons tied to partners who
are insane (there are 10,000 inmates,
mostly married, in the Government
asylums), or from whom they have been
separated for years, A. S. Henry, the
member for Clarence, introduced a
measure designed to give them relief. Him-
self a lawyer, he was a Digger, and there
is no staider figure in the House. Pre-
sumably he was prepared for the epis-
copal thunder which his bill brought on
his head, but the attitude of the Lang
party must have astounded him. The
“Labor Daily,” which describes itself as
“the official organ of the Labor move-
ment,” stigmatised his legislative first-
born as “the Free Love Bill.” Caucus
made a party matter of it. After a char-
acteristically disingenuous speech, the cap-
tain of the band, who is also the “Labor
Daily’s” principal mortgagee, and all his
docile followers voted against the second
reading, which was, nevertheless, carried.
Henry proposes that divorce may be
granted:
(1) Where the parties to the marriage have
been living apart continuously for seven years
or more, and
(2) Where the respondent is insane and has,
for not less than five years in the aggregate
or continuously for three years, been in an
asylum or reception house.
No new ground is broken here. The
divorce laws of other States contain simi-
lar provisions ; the lunacy of one party
to a marriage entitles the other to a
divorce even in Labor Queensland. The
author of the measure has followed the
Maoriland Act, but in one respect he
has not gone so far. Under Maoriland
law any unhappily married person may
get a divorce on the score of separation
by virtue of “an agreement, written or
verbal, which has been in force for three
years.” Where there has been separation
for that period by magisterial order or
judicial decree, divorce may be granted
if the decree or order was made in any
country. The provisions relating to
insanity are:
Insanity and confinement as a lunatic for
seven out of ten years preceding the petition.
Insanity for seven years, with confinement for
three years preceding the petition.
There are 11 grounds altogether, and no
distinction is made between the sexes.
Australia, of course, has six sets of
divorce laws. Where parties to a peti-
tion have lived in more than one State
domicile is a hurdle which has to be
cleared, though it may be thrown up in
other instances. A divorce was refused
to a naval rating, with his home in Syd-
ney, because it was held that, being at
sea a good part of his time, he had no
N. S. Wales domicile. This preposterous
decision, which would have affected all
R.A.N. men in the same situation,
was upset on appeal; but in hun-
dreds of cases failure to establish domi-
cile has shattered the hopes of wives
seeking to be freed from ruffians who
have deserted them, and of husbands
shackled to wives who have formed other
connections or otherwise abandoned
their responsibilities. Hence, of course,
a great deal of unhappiness and many
irregular alliances. A Commonwealth
measure of two or three clauses would
sweep away this barrier once and for
all. .Since the Constitution Act became
law the Commonwealth Parliament has
had power to make laws regarding
“marriage,” “divorce and matrimonial
causes, and in relation thereto parental
rights for the custody and guardian-
ship of infants”; but, for reasons
which the attitude of the Lang
party has now made plain, these
powers have never been exercised.
Maoriland lawmakers have been infi-
nitely more considerate to persons whose
married lives have been wrecked through
no fault of their own. As the Official
Year Book puts it, “A deserted wife
whose husband was domiciled in Maori-
land at the time of desertion is con-
sidered as retaining her Maoriland domi-
cile.” Where a wife petitions on one or
other of the separation grounds her
Maoriland domicile is retained if her
husband was domiciled in the Dominion
at the date of the agreement, decree or
order. In fact,
The amending Act of 1930 establishes the
M.L. domicile of a wife petitioning for
divorce where she has been living apart from
her husband, has been living in M.L. for three
years preceding the petition, and has the
intention of residing in M.L. permanently.
Maoriland has been denied the bless-
ings incident to betting on tin hares,
which the opponents of Henry’s bill in-
troduced into N. S. Wales to promote
morality and hasten the emancipation of
the workers. Yet even a tin-hare purist
would hesitate to assert that the Maori-
landers are an immoral people.
The Bulletin supports Henry’s bill,
believing it to be just and necessary. It
would be glad to see our chaos of divorce
laws, under which there is a denial of
justice to many ill-mated persons because
of their poverty, reduced to a system as
liberal, expeditious and inexpensive as
they have on the other side of the Tas-
man. Many good people are against
divorce. They have the same right as
those who are for it to organise politi-
cally and place their beliefs on the
Statute Book, if they can get a majority.
Such of them as belong to secular parties
have no right to intimidate members who
do not share their convictions on this
subject into voting the same way by
bringing party discipline to bear.
Divorce has never been mentioned on
any A.L.P. platform. Hitherto when it
came up in Parliament Labor members
have been free to vote as their con-
sciences dictated. Left to themselves,
some of the Langsters would undoubt-
edly have supported the Henry bill ;
but the party whip cracked, and they all
followed their leader, who is bidding
hard for the Church vote. The men who
were overawed surrendered their right of
private judgment for the sake of their
jobs ; and it is a very rotten and danger-
ous development of professional politics.
In economic matters N.S.W. Labor is
a socialist party. In matters pertaining
to marriage and divorce and denomina-
tional schools —to subsidies for which it
is now committed —it has suddenly be-
come clericalist. Socialism and cleri-
calism mix nowhere else in the world,
and they won’t mix in Australia.
WHEN THE TRUTH IS
UNFASHIONABLE.
A. M. Pooley, a Sydney journalist, said
over the air the other night that “ideals,
while admirable in their nature, are im-
possible in practical politics” ; and that
the advocates of disarmament “are put-
ting the cart before the horse.”
Causes of war are population, food supply,
raw materials and markets. Unless these pro-
blems can be solved by peaceable means, there
is not the slightest doubt that the threat of
war, which is inherent in human nature, will
find an outlet in active conflict.
Mr. Pooley went on to mention that
“the Council Chamber of the League of
Nations is a nest of political intrigue,”
and that the theoretically-idealistic
ancients are realists when it comes to
business.
A storm of scandalised protests fol-
lowed. A barrister referred to the broad-
caster’s “rank and crude materialism,”
said that his “premises were faulty
and false,” and cited Plato and Socrates
as moralists. Even the amiable C. E.
W. Bean wrote with displeasure in the
“S. M. Herald” of “this outburst over
the wireless.”
There is more in the objections than
meets the eye. Mr. Pooley has done
worse than make a misstatement; he
has told the truth at the wrong time.
G. B. Shaw, the originator of the prac-
tice, did it in his fable of the Old Lion
at the beginning of the war ; Lord North-
cliffe did it on the subject of the shell
shortage a few months later. Just as
everybody knew 18 years ago, when it was
the fashion to say that England had un-
limited ammunition, that English soldiers
were being mowed down in thousands
for lack of ammunition, so everybody
knows now that the League of Nations
has failed in its main purpose—namely,
as a check on serious wars. It may have
a success here and there with a possible
belligerent of the status of Andorra;
but when a great country like Japan is
involved it is ignored. And, so far as
can be judged, it always will be ignored
in similar circumstances.
Politicians of every country and age
have been in the habit of boasting about
their high ideals, but it has rarely affected
their conduct. Cato the Censor was an
example. During his candidature for
the highest dignity in Rome, he promised
to “destroy by knife and cautery the
hydra of luxury and effeminacy.” Yet
this former man of the people soon be-
came a profiteer in marsh draining, hot
springs, marine assurance, washing and
wood-dealing, and he exchanged a life
of asceticism for one of splendor. Long
after the world knew the truth about him
he continued to pose as incorruptible;
and something of the sort is happening
to-day as regards the League of Nations.
Its friends refuse to admit its weak-
nesses.
This trait, which is often miscalled
loyalty, nearly lost England the war. A
stage arrived when it was disloyal to
tell the truth about anything of real
importance. It was revealed in the Meso-
potamia Report that, when an officer
protested about the treatment of the
wounded, General Cowper “threatened
to put him under arrest for a meddle-
some fanatic.” The official theory all
through the war was that the wounded
privates were treated like kings, though
every private knew the facts.
Another theory was that Britons, un-
like their enemies, were free. Yet, from
the day the Defence of the Realm Act
was passed, fresh, and mostly senseless,
inroads on freedom were made every
day. “The liberty for which we are
fighting is already gone,” wrote a free-
dom-loving journalist in 1916. “The
nation is stricken dumb, bound hand and
foot” —and he was arrested for his out-
spokenness an hour after the appearance
of the article.
A stage arrived when there was reason
to think that the Germans had had
enough, and would consider peace terms.
A peer grown grey in politics, the
Marquis of Lansdowne, admitted that he
was in favor of hearing what they had
to say. He became an outcast. The
official attitude at the time was that any-
one who so much as thought about peace
was a defeatist. The Pope, for talking
peace when the Germans looked like
winning, became pro-English in Ger-
many ; and for doing it again when the
Germans were in a bad way he became
pro-German in England.
The same foolery is going on in con-
nection with pacifist ideals, disarmament
and the League of Nations. Broadly, the
official or right-thinking attitude is that
nothing must be said in derogation of the
League’s capacity to stop wars; those
who do so are the modern equivalents
of war-time defeatists. Those who call
defence measures armaments, and oppose
them, must not be harshly criticised, be-
cause they are idealists. If anyone is to
be attacked let it be the armament-
mongers : the crude and materialistic
persons who want to send mothers’ sons
to wars to be killed.
The stifling of discussion about widely-
known facts during the war —profiteering,
departmental tyrannies and ineptitudes,
the food-shortage in the summer of ’l7
and so on —did the cause of obscur-
antism no good in the long run ; and,
similarly, pacifism and the League arc
not likely to be benefited by outcries
every time their pretensions are ques-
tioned. The truth, from the standpoint
of political and international realists, is
that neither of them is an ideal at all.
They only aim at an ideal, namely, world
peace, which, if it is ever achieved, will
not be achieved on the lines they are
pursuing.
Universal peace can only come when
the causes of war have been removed;
and until they have been removed it
must continue to be madness for any part
of the world with possessions worth steal-
ing to leave them at the mercy of possible
invaders.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Overboard with Scullin!
The A.W.U. and the Shop Assistants’
Union have rejoined the Sydney Labor
Council. It is a sign that peace is break-
ing out again among the Labor factions ;
it is the biggest political event of its
kind since 1927. After the Red Rules
were adopted in that year, the A.W.U.
cut loose from Lang and Garden, and
its “Worker” declared :
Lang has crossed the Rubicon beyond all
doubt. He is now one of the militants —the
Reds. He has been welcomed into the fold in
which Messrs. Garden, Beasley, Howie and
Kilburn hold sway; the section which is the
head of the Australian Communist party, con-
spiring to Sovietise the Labor party.
Senator Barnes said something similar,
and general-secretary Grayndler accused
the Garden gang of receiving funds from
Communist sources in Shanghai.
At a 1930 A.L.P. conference a com-
mittee, headed by Garden, was appointed
to consider the question of getting the
A.W.U. in again, but nothing came of
it. The A.W.U. became the prop of
the Federal Labor party, which weak-
ened as it weakened. Garden and his
friends white-anted it for all they were
worth, filching its members into redder
unions. The A.W.U. of 1930 had only
15,000 members as against 34,639 in
1926 ; this decline the “ ‘Labor Daily’
Year-Book” attributes to “desertions
from the ranks of the organisation be-
cause of the political actions of certain
of its officials.”
The joining of the Labor Council by
the A.W.U. amounts to total surrender
to Langism. It is idle for some A.W.U.
official to say weakly that it has “no
political significance.” The structure of
the State party is such that the Inner
Group is the core of its organisation, and
the heads of the Labor Council are the
Inner Group. At the very moment when
the union’s officials were giving the assur-
ance on the point to the credulous flapper
press, they were putting this statement
into print in their own official organ:
It is hoped, too, that this step may prove to
be the prelude to unity in the political sphere.
Determined efforts are now being made in
this direction
How far these efforts have gone may
be judged from the friendly article in
the “Worker” (13/9/’33) on the new
Lang socialisation-tariff proposals, adop-
tion of which involves the jettisoning of
everything which Scullin has stood for
in tariff matters. Good-bye to his faith
in prohibitive duties; good-bye to his
friendship with manufacturers which
helped him so much in the 1931 Federal
election campaign ; good-bye to his own
position as leader. He is about to walk
the plank.

Billy Saves Australia Again.
Certainly there are some humorous
spectacles in politics. Not the least funny
at the moment is that of W. M. Hughes,
surrounded by St. George Society
officials, Fellows of the Royal Empire
Society, aspirants to the 0.8. E., budding
politicians and charity promoters of the
richer sort, demanding earnestly that
Australia should defend itself against the
foreign foe.
Effective defence, is of course, an
urgent necessity; but it is strange
that a. move in its favor should
be led by W. M. Hughes. W. M.
Hughes, who, as Prime Minister in
1921-22, put his faith in Washington
and the League ; who reduced the train-
ing strength of the citizen forces from
127,960 in 1921 to 37,156 in 1922 ; who
cut the naval personnel 16.6 per cent, in
a single year, and the ships in commis-
sion from 25 to 13 ; who put H.M.A.S.
Australia off the sea, and in his last
year of office whittled down annual
Defence expenditure from £6,000,000 to
£4,500,000.
It takes a strong man to repent his
weaknesses, though it is easier to do so
when there is a Lyons in office and one
might ride into office again on a good,
sound, popular catch-cry.

Scotching Secession.
A miracle has happened in Westralia.
While a popular House in which
Labor has three-fifths of the representa-
tion has surrendered without a protest
to a ruinous sectionalism, the integrity
of the nation has been vigorously (and,
as the event will prove, victoriously)
championed in a Second Chamber
elected on a property franchise.
On the question of appointing a joint
select committee to prepare an address
to the Crown and to the Imperial Parlia-
ment appealing for the dissolution of the
Commonwealth, as far as Westralia is
concerned, all the goldfields M’s'.L.C.,
irrespective of party, denounced seces-
sion. And secession without the gold-
fields —now, after 20 years of stagnation,
as politically important as they were at
the beginning of the century —would be
a joke.
Goldfielders swept Westralia into the
Commonwealth, and they will take good
care that the coastal secessionists don’t
sweep it out.
♦ ——
An Abject Confession.
It was made in the N. S. Wales Leg.
Assembly last week by M. A. Davidson,
who was one of Lang’s Ministers, and
was to the effect that “the New Guard
practically took control out of the hands
of the Government” of which Davidson
was a member.
Yet that Government, in the jargon of
the Trades Hall, was composed of “fear-
less fighters,” and was headed by “the
greatest leader Labor ever had.” It con-
trolled the State Parliament and the
police. Under Section 119 of the Con-
stitution Act, it could have called upon
the Commonwealth to protect it. Where
in this alleged emergency was “the
greatest leader’s” heart, if not in his
boots?
“The greatest leader Labor ever had” has
been likened to De Valera. That gentle-
man has done things which have sad-
dened Australians not of Irish descent
who love the Irish ; but, to give him his
due, he has never been wanting in cour-
age. He does govern. He did suppress
the Blue Shirts.

Groote Eylandt Again.
“News that the Caledon Bay aborigines
propose to attack the Groote Eylandt
mission station in revenge for their sup-
posed betrayal to the police has been
conveyed to the Minister for the In-
terior,” and an armed party is being
sent to repel them. The mission does
not seem to fear reprisals, but for some
reason Canberra is anxious that it should.
The whole thing is mysterious. Mem-
bers of the expedition are forbidden to
engage in hostilities with the natives un-
less in self-defence. Presumably, there-
fore, no attempt is to be made to secure
the murders of Trooper McColl unless
they attack. Presumably, also, since no-
body seems to have seen anything of
them, save for spears thrown out of the
jungle, the Darwin Administration has
obtained its knowledge about danger to
the mission by second-sight.
But the intentions of Buck-Eye and his
friends sound strangest of all. Every-
one who knows the Territory must know
three things. One is that ever since
events began to happen in Darwin smoke
fires have been puffing the news across
Arnhem Land, and anything Buck-Eye
doesn’t know about the intentions of the
Government won’t be worth knowing.
The second is that he will have a fort-
night to scupper the mission if he feels
like it. The third is that, if he really
intends to tackle the mission, he is de-
parting from all precedent and is a bigger
fool than one would imagine.
The procedure of these blacks has
always been to go bush as soon as they
have committed an atrocity and lie doggo
as long as possible. Now they propose
to get into flimsy canoes and paddle over
40 miles of sea, at the risk of sticking
themselves into all sorts of ambushes
and, in the event of bad weather, being
nicely cooped up on Groote Eylandt till
caught. In other words, they have gone
stark, staring mad.
There is more behind the business
than meets the eye. In political circles
it is being said that the action
is prompted by a complaint from a
foreign Power, and that the suggested
defence of the mission is a blind. It
may be untrue; but, untrue or not,
it needs a franker assurance from the
Commonwealth Government than so far
has been given.
Whatever happens, the aboriginals
should be dealt with under Australian
law and custom. No other country has a
right to interfere in the administration of
Australian justice, especially where its
nationals have brought trouble on them-
selves by entering a reserve district
where they have no right to be and where
experience has made it plain that inva-
sion will be resented with spear-thrusts.

South Australia’s Railways.
The S.A. Railway Department is prompt
in getting out its annual figures. Its
printed reports are more informative,
too, than those of other Railway Depart-
ments, which sometimes seem to go to
trouble to conceal details of their
working.
There is now £27,772,779 invested in
the S.A. system —three-fifths of it in sft.
3in. gauge lines. Gross earnings for
1932-33 were a trifle more than 10 per
cent, on capital (£2,744,741). A net sur-
plus of £758,574 was all eaten up, plus
£688,000 in exchange and interest. It
is some consolation that the deficit was
reduced 24 per cent, against that of 1931-
32, though a gap which could only be
filled by a gift of £1 10s. per head of
population is nothing much to rejoice
about.
The interest rate has been reduced to
4} per cent. It should be possible to do
better than that; a shade over 5 per cent,
ruled before the depression. Seeing that
in 1929-30, the first year of depression,
the deficit was £1,796,000, and that it is
now only a little over one-third of that
amount, the effort has been none so
bad, especially as earnings are down
£553,000, or 16.8 per cent. The better
position has been achieved by a cutting
down of working expenses by 44.2 per
cent. The merit of this feat largely de-
pends on how far it has impaired effi-
ciency and safety, both present and
future, and how much of the reduction
of earnings is due to it.
The working surplus represents 2.7 per
cent, on invested capital, as against 2.1
per cent, earned in Britain and 1.25 per
cent, earned in the U.S.A.
When capital is written down, as the
Commissioner demands that it should be,
the position of the S.A. system seems
likely to be as satisfactory as can be
expected in these strenuous times. Which
is more than can be said for the railways
of some other States.

Is This Writer Inhuman?
Dear Bulletin, —The German burgo-
master who announced to a press con-
ference that he could no longer take the
responsibility for spending millions to
prolong the lives and sufferings of the
incurably sick and insane was, of course,
dubbed callous by humanitarians who
regard any wreck as worth salvaging so
long as it is human. But isn’t it time
stock was taken of the ideal of preserv-
ing the botched and the degenerate at
the expense of the hale and the sane?
The salvaging process goes on at the
beginning of life as vigorously as to-
wards the end of it. As to that, a
most elaborate technique is applied to
the victims of g.p.i. The pauents are
given controlled doses of malaria, in
accordance with a theory that the anti-
bodies produced by the blood to master
the malaria bacillus also destroy the
spirochiete.
But, at the best, these unfortunates
are only restored to a state of feeble-
mindedness. Maupassant, who suffered
from the disease, so fully understood the
horrors in wait for him that he tried
to commit suicide. Medical men inter-
vened, and his long-drawn-out end was
so unspeakable that a record of his dis-
integration, kept by one of the doctors,
has never been published. Nietzsche,
too, would have welcomed a humane
method of sparing him the ten years of
terror that were his lot when he suc-
cumbed to the same sickness.
Every care is also taken to preserve
children who are mentally defective,
even to the provision of special homes
and classes in the schools, while the
healthy and the strong-minded often lack
the facilities for becoming fruitful mem-
bers of society. So much sentiment is
introduced into the question, and the
line is so loosely drawn between the
moron and the intelligent, that a mental
deficient may lead a sheltered life, exer-
cise the franchise, marry and beget
children, likely also to be deficient. A
paternal Government will assist him in
every way possible in what actually
amounts to a work of social destruction.
One of the stock arguments against
sterilisation or lethalisation of the unfit
is that genius is akin to madness, and
that some of the greatest men of the
past were psychq-pathological cases.
This is a complete delusion. The genius
is in advance of his time, and therefore
may appear mad to “normal” people
because they are incapable of under-
standing him. A psychiatrist would have
to be of a pretty low order of intelli-
gence to stigmatise a Shelley or a New-
ton as a mental deficient. —Yours etc.,
Pa WANG.

Chance with a Vengeance.
A Sydney charity which keeps a large
staff off the dole has paid the last-limit
tribute to human credulity in its adver-
tisements for “the greatest lottery ever
made.”
First, you have to be a genius. You
are supplied with a picture of mistress
and maid. Maid says: “May I have the
afternoon off?” Mistress says: “Why?”
You pay is. for the privilege of invent-
ing the maid’s answer; and this does
three useful things. It eludes the gamb-
ling laws, it gives a shilling (gross, of
course) to a hospital, and if you provide
the best answer you will get a prize—to
wit, two tickets in each of the next 50
Government lotteries and 500 Christ-
mas cards.
Now chance begins to operate. It is
quite obvious that as it takes genius to
answer such a poser as forms the basis
of the competition, and there is only one
genius in a million, and as there will
be at least a million entrants, it is first
of all 1,000,000 td 1 that you won’t
win the tickets.
But assume you do.
Then, says the advertisement in big
black letters, “the first prize gives the
winner the possibility of collecting
£2so,ooo”—which can be done quite
simply by winning first prize in every
one of the fifty lotteries for which your
tickets are good. As the mathematical
chance of your winning first prize in
each lottery is 50,000 to 1 against, your
chance of scooping the lot is 2,500,000
to I against and, taking the odds against
your winning the tickets at all in the
first place into consideration, you may
be sure that, when you send in your shil-
ling with an eye on the quarter of a
million which the promoters think you
may win, the betting is a mere
2,500,000,000,000 to I, or thereabouts,
against your chance of getting it.
The hospital concerned, by the way,
is a maternity hospital—an institution
designed to make it easy for two mugs
to be born every minute where one was
born before. And mugs buy lottery
tickets.

Canberra Has a Case.
Canberra takes itself very seriously.
The other day a cop and a newsagent
had a barney there about a pup. News-
agent said the policeman had threatened
to assassinate the youthful hound with a
revolver ; J. Hop said he had done no
such thing.
The momentous matter went to the
Attorney-General, who reported it to
Cabinet. Cabinet appointed a Court of
Inquiry presided over by Garran, former
Solicitor-General —he came to the trial
just after his return from arbitrating mat-
ters at issue between the Governments of
Britain and India. High Federal officials
attended the proceedings. “Hansard” re-
porters and Government typists recorded
the evidence. Counsel for the parties
examined and cross-examined 16 wit-
nesses. And the Court reserved its de-
cision !
J. Taxpayer will get the bill in due
course.

Buddhas and Things.
“Feng-Shui” is not alarmed:
According to the Dutch, my old friend the
Panchen Lama, of Tibet, “the most mysterious
figure in Asia,” has left his lamasery and is
descending on Peiping, there to take over the
leadership of a gigantic world revival of
Buddhism which will “rise to dangerous
heights.”
The Panchen Lama is as mysterious a figure
as Mr. Lyons or Mr. Lang. He visits Peiping
periodically for precisely the same reason that
Mr. Lyons might visit U.A.P. headquarters,
because the Peiping Government appoints, or
used to appoint, him to his job. There cer-
tainly is an air of bogus mystery about the
way he is appointed. When his predecessor
dies his spirit is reincarnated in a new-born
child and its presence is revealed by the
infant exhibiting certain signs of Buddhahood.
The Tibetan priesthood are experts at reading
these signs. Sometimes an important lama
has a vision in which he sees the infant’s
visage in a lake, and, hastening to the spot,
duly finds him there; but more often there
are so many aspiring mothers who are quite
certain their offspring are the repository of
the Panchen’s soul that the quest takes on the
aspect of a Most Beautiful Baby competition.
To settle the question, the lamas write the
names of the parents of the applicants on bars
of iron and throw the bars into a bowl of
water. If one of the children is indeed the
reincarnated ruler, his bar will float. For
some reason or other, however, the bar doesn t
float, except with the approval of the Chinese
Government. This is known as the Tibetan
faked-ballot system, and it works very well,
because the new Panchen Lama avatar is un-
able to rule during his minority and the
Chinese viceroy does it for him. If he makes
himself unpleasant when he reaches his majority,
something violent is liable to happen to him.
It may become necessary, as the Chinese put
it, to “change his bed.”
The possibility of this dignitary starting a
jehad or crusade or lotusiad is remote indeed,
There are sundry nomad Mongol tribes who
take the Buddhist communion. The Cingalese,
Siamese and Burmese are Buddhists, too. Also
there are about 12 million white Buddhists in
Europe, England and America, and in India,
the original home of the sect, the followers
of Sakyamuni number two million or so; but
they are no more united than the Christian or
Moslem sects.
There was a time when Buddhism becanie
an imperialistic faith. That was when King
Asoka, the Buddhist Constantine, a contem-
porary of Alexander the Great, made it the
State religion, sent missionaries to all parts of
India and Ceyon, tried to convert Ptolemy
Philadelphus, King of Egypt, and others, and
started a movement which ended in Buddhist
kingdoms being set up in Java, Siam and Cam-
bodia. There is even some evidence that Asoka’s
missionaries may have come to Australia. < But
those days are done.

“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Mordred”: The private-inquiry agent
is not noted for humor. Sydney
recently saw an exception. Set to watch
an erring spouse and a suspect co-re., he
became the friend of both in the pub
where they all abode. The purchase of
a lottery ticket was suggested, and, when
the lady cast about for a collective name,
the sleuth brightly suggested “The Try to
Catch ’Em Syndicate." It was only when
the guilty pair were confronted with their
accuser in court that the point of the
jape dawned upon them.

“1894”: Broken Hill, even in these
times of depression, is making a pretty
fair fist of maintaining 26,000 people
in its own city, four or five hundred rail-
way workers between it and Port Pirie,
9000 or so people in Port Pirie, and a
few hundred in Risdon, Cockle Creek
and other places. On its 50th birthday
its fancy turned in the direction of bright
lights and bright colors, to relieve the
aridness of the drought-stricken sur-
roundings ; and, knowing that Sydney had
miles of pretty lights in electrical fes-
tooning, we thought the State capital
would be only too glad to help its distant

outpost. But we were wrong—Sydney
City Council said it didn’t lend its decora-
tions. Adelaide, however, said: “Right-
oh! Adelaide can lend you 3000 ft. or
4000 ft. of lights and so many yards of
pennants and flags.” We got them, and
a good show they made. But we were
left to celebrate our birthday alone. Not
a Premier or Cabinet Minister or minor
departmental head, Federal or State, put
in an appearance. Not one sent an
apology. The only blackness in the
main street was the Government build-
ings, situated in the busiest section of it.

“C.Q.”: The Victorian duration
record for a lecture was put up by P.
Dwyer at Sunbury recently. After
speaking for a couple of hours he broke
for the train back to Melbourne. His
auditors were so enchanted that they
pursued him on to the station and in-
duced him to return, when he went on
for another two and a half hours. His
subject was not art, economics or rela-
tivity, but football. He is an umpire-
coach of the Association.

“X.S.”: Melbourne possesses a girl
burglar. Nothing is known as yet about
her personal appearance, but she has a
charming voice, a cul-
tured manner and a
knowledge of social
usages. Her method is
to ’phone a residence in
one of the best suburbs
and ask innocently as
to the intended move-
ments of the inmates.
If they are all going
out except the maid,
she says it doesn’t mat-
ter and hangs up.
Later in the day the
maid is disposed of by
a fresh ’phone call- —
told there is a box of
eggs or fresh flowers to
be called for at the rail-
way station. When she returns from this
abortive errand she finds the house has
been ransacked.

“General Prac.”: The census shows
that boys outnumber girls in Australia,
the reverse being the case in most of
the older lands. Why is this? A child’s
sex is fixed irrevocably from the moment
of conception. The odds for petticoats
or pants are fifty-fifty at the outset.
But male offspring are less robust and
more sensitive to maternal ill-health. In
all mean surroundings death is busier
with the boys. Conversely, boys score
better when the mothers, as in Australia,
get their birthright of sunshine and good
food. The male population is believed
to take an upward jump in war-time—
and it does, but only to the tune of one
per cent, or thereabouts. This seeming
marvel is due, not to Nature redressing
the balance by repairing war losses, as
some imagine, but to the rude health of
expectant mothers during the absence of
their spouses at the front. As to the
age-old problem of sex-determination I
suspect the doctor who could predict or
govern the sex of a child might make a
fortune overnight, provided he guarded
the secret from competitors; and the
thing may yet be accomplished. Spal-
lanzani achieved it with dogs and cats
in the eighteenth century, and Russian
horse-breeders have made a success of
their work along these lines.
“Sembilan”: Some bright member of
the Sydney Chamber of Commerce has
suggested that instead of teaching young-
sters French and German, which they
are never likely to use, they should
study Dutch and Malay in view of the
enormous trade which one of these days
we are to have with the East Indies,
I don’t know much about Dutch, but
Malay as a commercial language is not
to be despised. You shove your com-
modify under the customer’s nose and
he says “Huh?” You look at him and
he says “One guilder.” You shrug
and say “Tid apa,” meaning “Nothing
doing.” He says “Two guilders.” You
say “ Tid apa!” meaning “Come off!”
This goes on till he says “Tid apa,”
meaning “That’s my limit.” You say
“Tid apa” —“Oh, all right, have it your
own way.” When you have indicated
the dotted line, you point your thumb
“I made a terrible mistake in marrying you —a man who didn’t believe there
was a hell.”
"You’ve long since convinced me I was wrong.”
over your shoulder and say ‘‘Tid apa ?” —
“What about it?” and he echoes you in
a different tone, signifying “I don’t
mind if I do.” Two hours later, when
the waiter, who prides himself on his
English, says “ ’Nother gin swizzle, sar?”
you answer “Tid apa!” to denote your
entire acquiescence. Still later, the bar-
man, who has been trying to persuade
you to leave, shrugs his shoulders and
says it again in a different tone, and you
find yourself out in the gutter between a
holy cow and a local tramcar. “Well,
tid apa,” you say, dusting yourself—
“lt’s all in the day’s work.” Yes, it’s
an easy and expressive tongue, if you
know the usage of the village.

“X.”: Seventy-five years ago, on Sep-
tember 12, Australia’s first train ran —be-
tween Melbourne and Sandridge, no\V
Port Melbourne. The engine was 30 h.p.
and locally built, and could do 25 miles
an hour when pushed. Melbourne was
Melbourne even then, as may be judged
from the fact that trains stopped “during
hours of divine service” on Sundays.
Sydney had no train till a year later,
when, on September 26, 1855, the Parra-
matta line was opened.

“Selma”: “Cafe Royal” reproaches
Bohemian artists (B. 13/8/’33) with lack
of acquaintance with crayfish. The
true Bohemian knows nothing about a
cray because it isn’t until he’s famous
and can give an imitation Bohemian
party that he can afford that expensive
crustacean. I have an artist friend who
occasionally invites me to pick a bone
with him, and I know the invitation must
be taken literally until he reaches the suc-
cessful or crayfish stage. He invited me
to dinner the other night—not with him,
but with a brother Bohemian. After
climbing six flights of dank and rickety
stairs we discovered our host-to-be (who
was unaware of the distinction about to
be conferred on him) cooking a sausage
on a tin plate over a candle. With the
simple dignity of the true Bohemian he
divided the sausage into three more or
less equal parts, and in cold tea we
drank to his future success and the days
when he will be able to afford a cray-
fish. Unless an artist is. mistaken for a
waiter and given an unexpected tip crays
are almost unknown in Bohemia.

“Nakhoda”: The diagnosis of a Mel-
bourne hospital case as one of leprosy re-
minds me that the first isolation hospital
for lepers which I ever saw was up in a
tree in a Borneo sultanate. The wretched
inmates sat in the doorway of a miserable
hut contemplating the world from which
they had been excluded by popular vote.
The tree was a rambutan, which pro-
duces a small, hairy fruit of acid taste
but fairly nutritious qualities. Later the
Government built a tin hut on the ground
and fed its patients on regular rations,
thus supplanting a method of segregation
which had been practised by the natives
probably from time immemorial. The
Melbourne case is a Southern European
who has the nodular type of the disease,
which is also the most contagious. It
takes months or years for even this
variety to be transmitted by contact, but
that fact isn’t likely to allay the public
horror with which leprosy is regarded,

“El Verdugo”: : “M. de Paris” (B.
13/9/’33) is so courteous that, if he did
not show himself a mere tyro in the lore
of our noble profession, I could not
bear to say even “tut, tut!” to him when
he absurdly declares that Ann Boleyn
lost her head on a block. Obviously, he
cannot have read the eye-witness
accounts of his learned countryman
Chapuys, and of the Dutch ambassador
of the period, who also had a free pass
to the show. There was no block. The
lady knelt, and (as women will even
in such moments) began to feel whether
her hair was tidy. M. de St. Omer
(not M. de Calais, as my blood brother
suggests) quietly kicked off his shoes and
literally flicked her head into the air
with his sword. As to French practi-
tioners of that day “not dreaming of
omitting such an essential as a block,”
there is evidence that they didn’t always
regard it as an essential. Did not our
distinguished colleague M. Sanson,
grand-pere, once oblige a gent, by de-
collating him as he stood at attention?
And was not the job so perfect that it was
several seconds before a sliding cocoa-
nut told the subject that his cake was
dough? Sanson tells of it himself in
his “Memoirs,” so it must be true.

“San.”: There are excellent reasons
for the practice (B. 6/9/’33) of putting
milk into the teacup before pouring in
the tea. For one thing, you get better
emulsification ; then the bottom layer of
milk prevents the hostess’s china from
becoming badly stained. This brings to
memory a row of blackened cups on the
sink of The Bulletin’s publishing-room
after lunch, and the then burly foreman
holding up to ridicule his men’s habit
of tea-drinking. Taking up a cup stained
nearly black, he said to me: “There you
are —that's what tea does to the blighters’
insides.” I asked him “What about that
clean one over there?” “Oh,” he said
scornfully, “that toff must have milk in
his, and he puts it in first.” In Tom’s
opinion none of it could touch good
beer.

“F.S.”: The latest beautification
scheme in Melbourne is due to Cr. A. E.
Kane, chairman of the Buildings Regu-
lations Committee of the City Council.
He suggests that buildings should be
erected so high and no higher—also no
lower —and instances the cities of the
ancient world, such as Babylon and
Nineveh, which allegedly had a uniform
skyline. He doesn’t explain why a
straight line is more beautiful than a
crooked one, or what we are to do with
the minarets on the State Theatre and
St. Paul’s spires. As for Nineveh
and Babylon, the building limit there
may have been set by Bridget, the under
housemaid, refusing to carry the slop
bucket up more than two flights of stairs. '
There are lifts in Melbourne. Anyhow,
Oriental towns never have a straight
skyline. The numerous mosques and
temples make them as charmingly varied
as is the skyline of Melbourne.

Its mellow madrigal.
Watching its buzzing fall,
To swat it I forbear,
For does it not recall
Spring in the air?
Each fruit-tree which in vain
Stared at the pawnshop wall
Of winter can regain
At last its family shawl
Of blossom ; sparrows fall;
Thrushes their notes compare;
In fact, all birds forestall
Spring—in the air!
A gleaming wattle-chain
Earth wears abdominal ;
Thank goodness, here’s a plain
Gold standard, after all!
I’m sick of Capital
And Labor, which prepare
To make some sort of brawl
Spring in the air.
Envoy.
O poets everywhere,
Our vernal verses pall:
Let’s just join hands, and all
Spring in the air.

“Corella”: “General Prac.” says germs
of any kind are rare on Mt. Kosciusko
(B. 6/9/’33). Outside four walls per-
haps they are, but last month I was at
the Chalet at Charlotte’s Pass (6000 ft.),
where guests are accommodated in dor-
mitories containing up to 30 beds,
double-deckers, with barely standing
room between each pair. ’Flu broke
out, and in no time 50 per cent, of the
ski-ers were cot cases. A blizzard which
kept even the hardiest enthusiasts cooped
up in the chalet for the best part of two
days made matters worse. The altitude
didn’t seem to worry the germs.

“W.W.”: According to Richmond
(Tas.) Council Clerk Gatty (dad of the
youthful birdman who, with Wiley Post,
last year soared round the top of the
BRIDEGROOM (showing mother-in-law round garden ): “This palm takes many
years to bear. I’ll let you have a bit of fruit off it next time you visit us.”
globe), the Ma State’s archeologists who
claim the Lapstone Hill Bridge as the
oldest in Australia are talking through
their hats. The honor belongs to the
Richmond (Tas.) structure, which dates
from 1823. The N.S.W. bridge is of
the 1834 plinthage.
“FY7 ’: The splitting of a wax match
into many for economy’s sake is no
monopoly of the gaolbird (B. 13/9/’33) ;
it has been practised by soldiers on active
service and by bush wanderers since
wax matches were invented. The feat
is quite an easy one, given a match of
decent quality and with a liberally dipped
head. I have performed it many a time.

“Pawang”: A hoary old English tra-
dition spoke when Lord Trenchard,
London’s police boss, told his bobbies
that recruits needn’t expect to marry until
after four years’ service, as married
policemen tended to neglect their duties.
The ideal of celibacy in the service of
the Empire—army, navy and mercantile
houses are alike agreed on it —goes back
to the East India Company,
when a young man went out
to “the East” to make a for-
tune and never contemplated
having a white helpmate until
his return 20 years later. Trad-
ing firms maintained the tradi-
tion into the present century ;
marriage without permission
resulted in instant dismissal in
the one I served with. Per-
mission was granted only when
one’s salary plus private in-
come, equalled that of a cer-
tain rank, to which there was
no hope of attaining before
40. Liaisons with native
women were tolerated so long
as there was no open scandal.
Then one day somebody sit-
ting in an office chair in the
London “Spectator” office sud-
denly became overwhelmed
with horror at the thought
that British colonial officials
might be living in immoral
relations with brown subjects
of his Majesty, and a vigorous
campaign was started. The
result was an order prohibit-
ing the practice. The retort of
the employees was a general
agitation against interference with matri-
monial restrictions. Life in the outskirts
was now more possible for women, so
in the end the old gentlemen in London
capitulated, though they put up a hard
struggle, and some of them still cling to
vestiges of the old paternalism.

“Cato”: After mothers-in-law, there
seems to be more joke-material in whis-
kers —the term being used in the sweep-
ingly inaccurate sense of almost any
facial upholstery—than in any feature
of this quaint age of ours. A luxuriantly
bearded wrestler broke into Sydney the
other day and provided a peg for
columns of humorous copy in the dailies.
A beard may be the reverse of an asset
for any man engaged in manual com-
bat —it was Alexander the Great who
ordered the Macedonians to be shaved
lest the beard should give a handle to
their enemies—but why it should have
become so rich a jest in itself is some-
what puzzling. The Jews have stuck
to it for thousands of years. To some
extent, indeed, it is a part of their re-
ligion—vide Leviticus xix, 27: “Ye
shall not round the corners of your
heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners
of thy beard.” History shows that in
other nations it is a fashion that comes
and goes along the centuries and is just
as certain to recur as to disappear. Who
“But I couldn’t give you enough work to keep you occupied.”
“Missus, you’d be surprised wot a little it takes to keep me occupied.”
knows but that in 50 years’ time jesters
will find something exquisitely humorous
in a clean-shaven man?
“S.T.S.”: Flinders, who sailed all
around and about S. Aus. long before
Adelaide was dreamed of, will have his
statue up (on North-terrace, midway be-
tween the two war memorials) before
Christmas. It is by Brook Hitch, the
English sculptor, who did Ross Smith for
Adelaide, is Bft. 6in. in height, and will
stand on a tall base of Murray Bridge
granite.

“Exul”: Of course narrow hipbones
(B. 23/8/’33) mean difficult childbear-
ing, but “Koplik” is perfectly right when
he says that it is very hard to tell from
appearances when hipbones are narrow.
Some of the most difficult confinements
I’ve attended have been of women who
looked broad enough in the beam to
win the admiration of a Matabele chief-
tain. Per contra, I’ve seen apparently
slim-hipped girls have babies very easily.
But the really important thing is the
relative sizes of the mother’s hips and
the baby’s head. Big-headed babies are
particularly liable to result from the
union of members of two different races,
such as the Nordic and the Mediter-
ranean. The type of pelvis that causes
difficult labor is certainly becoming more
common, but, despite “Sandig,” indul-
gence in athletics has nothing to do with
its production. It partly results from
rickets, due to improper food, and is
partly an evolutionary product which is
transmitted through our interference with
natural selection. The easiest confine-
ment I ever saw was of a woman who
had been one of the best hockey players
in N.S.W.

“Dodo”: The discovery of a 250-year-
old book, “The Parson’s Monitor,”
among the lumber of a pub at Collector
(B. 30/8/’33) recalls a find of my own.
One night in 1902, when I was staying
at the old Globe Hotel, West Wyalong,
ah old miner blew into the bar, and after
some talk invited me out to his tent to
inspect his collection of books, which
he wished to sell to help pay his fare to
Mount Morgan. He had about 25
volumes, and I bought the lot, more
with the idea of giving the old fellow a
helping hand than for any other reason.
But one of them was certainly unique.
It is “The History of the Sabbath,” by
Pet. Heylyn, dated 1636. The imprint
reads, “Printed for Henry Seile, and are
to bee sold at the signe of the Tygers-
head in Saint Paul’s Church-vard, Lon-
don.” Written in faded ink are the
words “Hie liber pertinet ad G. Manson,
octavo mens Augustus, Anno Domini
17 —,” last two figures obliterated. I
still have the book, and often wonder
how it came into the old battler’s posses-
sion.
“Asphodel”: Sydney’s Judge Curlewis,
that stickler for pure English, pilloried
a witness who had referred to “ash-
phalt.” What made the lapse worse and
roused his Honor to withering animad-
version was lhat the offender was a Uni.
undergrad. “Don’t they ever teach you
that there is no such substance as ‘ash-
phalt’?.... The word is derived from
the Greek.... One expects University
students to use better language than a
foreman builder”—these were some of
the rumblings from the Bench before the
storm died away. It was pointed out that
the witness was doing a medical course
and therefore couldn’t be expected to be
familiar with Greek roots, but his Honor
didn’t seem to consider that much of an
excuse —as indeed it wasn’t. But, con-
sidering that thousands of people do
mispronounce “asphalt” and will doubt-
less continue to do so without anyone
being in the slightest danger of being
misled thereby, it is pedantic to make a
judicial fuss about it.

“Bullswool”: R. C. Hagon is the first
Lud Mayor who has shown the slightest
disposition to present to his overgrown
borough an unconventional idea,
though an attempt to make the Town
Hail the plaything of the notion that a
lad should be Lud Mayor collapsed in
the first hour. Better luck attended the
installation of a 17-year-old boy scout
as manager of David Jones, Ltd. The
show was the best free ad. any store
has had for years, and the original of
“S. M. Herald’s” photograph of Lloyd
Jones explaining things to the scout is
doubtless by now a familiar exhibit in
the managerial sanctum. It exhibits the
youth standing up and taking stenog.
notes from dictation —a practice not
hitherto recognised as an ingrained habit
of general managers, but refreshingly
original in conception.

“Farleigh”: More than 30 persons
having hurled themselves to destruction
over Sydney’s Harbor Bridge in about
18 months, authority has at last arrived
at the conclusion that something must be
done about it. The grim toll might very
well have been foreseen, if only in the
light of what happened when the London
Monument and the Clifton Suspension
Bridge were new ; but human memory
is very short in these matters. How
stupid it is to suggest, as many people
have done, that those who have leaped
to death from the bridge would have
found other routes out of the world if
it hadn’t been there! A few of them
might, of course, but
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Makes ill deeds done
is just as applicable to suicide as to
murder or theft or any other crime.
The Bridge, at present, provides the most
accessible, arresting (and, not improb-
ably, painless) means of self-destruction
that Australia has yet seen, and the fact
is bound to have the deadliest effect on
unbalanced and wavering minds. Mil-
lions have been spent on it; to spend
a few thousands more on making it, as
far as practicable, suicide-proof is surely
something no Government should grudge.
THE DOOM OF THE FAIRIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In an address to the British Association, an
eminent professor described fairies as hallucina-
tions.’ ”
Fairies and elves, elusive sprites and tricksy
Whom bards have sung about in every age.
Goblin and Scottish kelpie, alias nixie,
Ariels and sportive Pucks and brownies sage,
Dryad and leprechaun and gnome and pixie,
And all the rest of you, buzz off the stage.
In this hard world for you no more is room;
Inexorable Science knells your doom.
What though you made drab life a bit more
peptic
And filled with rapture many a youthful brain,
Your origin was largely epileptic.
You had your shadowy birth in mere
migraine;
Profound belief in you first veered to sceptic
Indifference —and now it’s sheer disdain.
Back with you, fairies, to your ghostly shore,
Stuff such as dreams are made on, nothing
more.
No more shall moon-loved mazes see your
dances.
Or rushy glens, you tiny elfin folk.
They never did, save in the muddled fancies
And wandering wits of chaps whose health
was broke.
In short, you’re stark delusions, mad romances,
A ruddy figment, an egregious joke,
Subject for academic jeer and scoff.
Mizzle, you red-capped rogues, vamoose, be of!
You’ve reached the end of your fantastic tether;
The world grows out of you—with other
myths;
No more we’ll feature you upon the heather
Of airy mountains or the banks of friths.
’Tis found incongruous, your white owl’s
feather,
In this dull aggregate of Browns and Smiths.
Farewell, a long farewell, you fairy crew
(And you may take our bunyip with you, too)!
You’re out of date, the same as witch and
wizard,
With them you melt away into the mist;
You’re one with phantom snake and tartaned
lizard
That give the Bacchanalian ritualist
At times a choky feeling in the gizzard,
In that you positively don’t exist.
Be off! ’Tis pity no professor knows
As quick a way of exorcising those.

POLITICAL POINTS
Bruce’s arrangement for the conversion
of another £20,000,000 worth of Austra-
lian loans sets the seal on a good job.
The terms will be 3| p.c. at £9B for 20
years, giving investors a return of £3
17s. lid. p.c. A bit better for Australia
than the last conversion, which provided
a yield of £4 Is. lOd. p.c. Altogether,
conversions so far completed or arranged
for have saved us £1,500,000 per annum
in interest. Nobody can say that Bruce’s
trip has not paid for itself.
Already buoyancy and the prospect of
minor tax reductions have produced a
Federal surplus of £2,540,000 for July
and August. The figure is no just cri-
terion for the year ; still it is encourage-
ment to Lyons to reduce taxation sub-
stantially and get a few more men back
into their own jobs. The N. S. Wales
deficit for the period was £1,914,913 —
none so cheerful. Nobody expects it to
be in a State in which the Premier thinks
of recovery in terms of sewerage work.
It is nearly two years since the pitiful
Scullin Government was hoofed out of
office, and the world is still depression-
ridden. Yet Scullin got this off his chest
at his Sydney meeting:
If we had had the power handed to Roose-
velt there would be a different story to-day.
We would have lifted the country out of the
depression.
If there is anyone who believes it he
ought to be certified.
Lyons and Parkhill have become like
brothers since they decided to shelve
Bruce. The P.M.’s first official journey
from Canberra since the announcement
has been to Parkhill’s electorate. A good
many Warringah people don’t like Park-
hill, and a repetition of his 1929 election
experience would annoy him intensely.
Having dealt with moneylending and
hire-purchase, the Queensland Govern-
ment is turning its attention to industrial
insurance. The law is to be amended to
provide a fixed surrender value for in-
dustrial life policies. Premiums on these
are paid weekly, forfeiture after a
month’s arrears being the rule with some
cos., though one or two fix a voluntary
surrender value. Under the amended
law a fixed value will be compulsory.
Allan McKenzie McDonald will evi-
dently succeed his late uncle as M.L.A.
for Polwarth. At the end of the first
count he led the Labor man, J. J. Ded-
man, by 895 votes, 4193 against 3298,
with 2623 polled for the C.P. nominee,
G. C. Howey, to be distributed. All
three candidates are farmers. Bitter
things were said during the campaign,
and an eleventh-hour threat was issued
that the C.P. Ministers might be with-
drawn from the Government. Really
the result is a warning to the disunited
parties, in the Commonwealth as well
as the State, that if they go on wrang-
ling until it is war to the knife Labor
will beat both.
In the nineteenth century Binghi had
few friends. Recent years have wit-
nessed a rapid spread of the conviction
that he is no mean member of the human
family, and the clumsy announcement
from Canberra that a punitive expedi-
tion was to be sent to Arnhem Land
evoked remarkable nation-wide protests.
A Victorian body of sympathisers pro-
poses that “wherever possible” women
should be appointed protectors of abos. ;
and why not? No one knows more
about the natives, has done more for
them and is more trusted by them than
Mrs. Daisy Bates, who has been a pro-
tector in Westralia and South Aus.
Garden and his friends are making all
the capital they can out of Stevens’s sorry
unemployment schemes. At lunch-hour
mass meetings the plight of the work-
less after four depression years is
stressed in bitter language. Adherents
of “the movement” are “required” to
divert l|d. from the purchase of an anti-
Labor newspaper on Thursdays to a
fund to relieve distress. It is a shrewd
political organising campaign, but the
other side evidently thinks it can be
ignored. At the moment Bligh-street
and Macquarie-street seem more inter-
ested in the Federal Ministerial
manoeuvres than in the unemployed ques-
tion.
Butler is having bills prepared to give
effect to changes in the S.A. gambling
laws recommended by the Betting Com-
mission. To the numerous facilities
already available in the City of Churches
are to be added a State-wide, off-the-
course tote pool, to operate on races
both inside and outside S.A. (minimum
“investment,” Is.), and small sweeps,
“not for private gain.” S.-p. bookies,
THE DEMOCRATS DILEMMA .
“There has been wholesale violence on the Pennsylvania coalfields. Senator Harrison has

Congress.”

I don’t I’m gonna lose the kid.”
however, are to be treated with
severity; in fact, persons suspected of
any one of ninety-and-nine offences
against morality and the tax-collectors
will, if the law is altered as proposed,
be liable to be searched without arrest.
Nothing has gone right with the
Timberworkers’ Union since the .1930
Sydney strike. The Westralian branch,
numbering over 4000 members a few
years ago, and with a credit balance of
£15,000, rushed like an avalanche down
to some hundreds of members and a
lot of debts, with the landlord telling
it to seek new premises. Malcontents
formed a new union, but the old con-
cern wouldn’t die. The law was in-
voked, and the Court mediated between
the old and the new —sent them into
conference. Sawmillers, who would like
a lot of new business, will probably get
a new log instead.
A fuss is brewing over the deposition
of a Bechuanaland chief because he
ordered the flogging of a white guilty of
immorality with native women. Bechuana-
land is a semi-independent protectorate ;
the chiefs have a wide jurisdiction over
natives, but a limited one where whites
are concerned. South Africa, Dutch and
British, has always insisted on the right
to wallop its own nigger, but the reverse
of the medal is another matter. Exeter
Hall, on the other hand, will always back
the black skin against the white, and
Exeter Hall is very fond of Bechuana-
land.
Tunnecliffe let himself go to some pur-
pose in the debate on the Vic. Gas Regu-
lation Bill. Now the metropolitan co.
has assured Chief Sec. Macfarlan that
the whole of the benefit from the reduc-
tion of the calorific standard from its
present average, about 550 British ther-
mal units, to 500 units will be passed
on to consumers. Previously the pro-
mise was a decrease of 3d. per 1000 cubic
feet. The concern is not popular, and
there was a pronounced disposition to
side with Tunnecliffe until it stopped
barking back in generalities and gave a
definite undertaking.
Tunnecliffe is keeping the Vic. Ministry
busy. His allegations against a detective
engaged in tracking down car thieves
moved it to grant an investigation by a
County Court Judge. Now it has pro-
mised an inquiry into charges that there
has been dirty work in connection with
the provision of pants for the unem-
ployed.
What with public opinion pressing for
the return of Bruce, Parkhili working
hard for promotion, the usual dogfight
about State representation in the chang-
ing Cabinet, Trethowan of the Country
party warning the U.A.P. that the Fed-
eral election pact must not be ignored,
the Parliamentary C.P. demanding speci-
fic enlightenment as to whether there
will be an early election, Hughes shout-
ing for more defence, everybody shout-
ing for less taxation and the Labor fac-
tions fusing on a policy based on tariff
“reforms” involving total surrender of
the manufacturing interest to the Trades
Hall, the life of the Prime Minister is
not a happy one. Indeed, the only
excuse which one of Lyons’s strong press
supporters can find for his hanging on
to office is that he has a large family.
Brisbane, which already has two large
bridges across the river in the heart of
the city, is to acquire another. Forgan
Smith announces that finance for build-
ing a high-level bridge from the city to
Kangaroo Point has been promised in
several quarters, provided a toll franchise
is granted ; and the Government, he
hints,, is willing. At this rate Brisbane
will rival the Seine or the lower Thames
in the matter of bridges before it is many
years older.
The Argyles’ Transport Bill, of which
Menzies is in charge, will have a rocky
passage through committee in Vic.
Assembly. It survived the second read-
ing by 35 votes to eight—five Cockies
and three U.A.Ps. Motor interests are
prodding members to smash the bill or
so encumber it with qualifications that
it will be useless. Labor is supporting
Menzies at the moment, but will want a
say in committee to an extent that may
embarrass the young man.
Scullin’s attack on the banking system
boils down to the promise that “a Labor
Government would restore the Common-
wealth Bank to its original position, so
that it would be able, with vigorous com-
petition, to secure for the people the pro-
fits of banking which now go into the
pockets of private shareholders.” Scullin
can’t think banking'very important, after
all, despite his denunciations. If a Gov-
ernment said that its improved Defence
policy would be to start a public army
in competition with privately-owned ones
he would be regarded as a frivolous
person.
Extradition treaties between Britain
and about 20 other countries, ranging
from Albania to Liberia, have been ex-
tended to New Guinea. Time was when
what is now N.G. and Papua was a
sort of sanctuary for the world’s wanted.
The first shock came some 30 years ago,
when a Sydney police official raided
Papua on behalf of the French Govern-
ment and shipped away a boatload of
gentlemen who at one time or another
had got out of penal New Caledonia.
Nowadays there seems no refuge in the
wide earth from dock and Dartmoor, or
their equivalents in other lands.
As a result of the census, South Aus.
will probably lose a seat in the House
of Reps. The change, if made, will bring
the State’s representation down to six
members —one more than Tasmania,
which has considerably less than half
S.A.’s population.
A plank in Scullin’s latest “fighting”
platform forbids Australians to take
part in a war outside Australian shores.
So if somebody starts to overwhelm
Maoriland as a preliminary to taking
Australia we must keep out of it till the
first shell falls in Richmond.
There were the usual denunciations of
Fascism at the British trade-union con-
gress ; yet it is from trade-union leaders
that Fascism draws its dictators. Mus-
solini and Hitler come under this cate-
gory, and Lang is a potential Musso-
hitler.
Drayloads of superfluous public docu-
ments issue from the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Printing Office. A case in point
is a sheet which, after reciting that it
is published in 1933 under the authority
of the Legislative Council, and during the
third session of the thirtieth Parliament,
commencing June 20, 1933, and ending
July 20, 1933, breaks loose as follows:

Let’s hope the Emir Ghazi, who suc-

The A.M.P. Adelaide office loses its
accountant, W. H. Gillman, who goes to
the London branch, and W. A. Saddler,
its manager, who retires after 48 years’
service. Saddler joined the society in
Melbourne, and served it in Broken Hill
and Tasmania before settling in Adelaide
in 1917.
Charles Buckland Shugg, director of
Patterson, Shugg, who died at the week-
end, was imported from U.S.A. in the
mid-’eighties to make the first gelatine
process blocks in Australia for The Bul-
letin, but he soon abandoned the pro-
cess for zinc, which he used for the first
time in Australia. After three years
with The Bulletin, during which he
etched a good deal of the early work
of “Hop” and Phil May, he went to Mel-
bourne and pioneered the modern block-
making system there.
P. R. Stephensen, who has been
manager of the Endeavour Press (asso-
ciated with The Bulletin) for the first
year of its existence, announces his forth-
coming retirement from that position to

publishing company in his own name.
Details of the books to be published by
Mr. Stephensen will be announced
shortly. The Endeavour Press, under
Bulletin management, will continue to
publish works by Australian authors.
Sydney’s Lord Mayor is a bluff, un-

personal supervision. His Mayoralty has
been a busy one, but he is still active
enough to set the pace for his younger
confreres, and he seems to have a store
of tact and firmness which were lacking
in other civic heads. During his regime
the Sydney Town Hall has been a
strangely peaceful place.
Jack Fanning, now 77, is writing a his-
tory of the theatre in Australia. It
seems only yesterday that he was
advance-agent for the Taits and Carrolls.
His first venture as an “advance” was

•several imitators of Blondin to Bendigo.
It was at his suggestion that Rickards
assumed control of the Opera House in
Sydney and converted it into the Tivoli.
Fanning now lives quietly at Middle Park

George Waite is a political exile, but

brated her 102nd birthday the other day.
Her eldest daughter, aged 82, and her
baby son, aged 55, were present to con-

the King of Denmark is a bowler, it
probably contributed towards his deci-
sion to bestow an honor on T.W., for
the latter is a great friend of Kitty—
champion of Queensland and president
of the association of her admirers.
Geoffrey Builder, who is a Doctor of
Philosophy of London University, has
come to Australia to study our radio
difficulties under the C.S.I.R. He has had
extensive, experience with blind spots and
Heaviside layers —his last big job was
with the British Polar Wireless Expedi-
tion, with which he spent a year inside
the Arctic Circle, particularly giving
attention to the effect of the Aurora
Borealis on radio propagation. Possibly
he may find a way to deal with the
phenomenon called License Parkhillalis,
which causes so much excitement among
Australian radio users.
Judge May D. Lahey, of the Munici-
pal Court of Los Angeles, who made a
marked impression at the recent inter-
national legal conference in Chicago, is
an Australian. She was born in Gympie
(Q.) and educated at the Brisbane Girls’
Grammar School and Sydney University.
She left Australia for the U.S.A. in 1910,
and entered the Law School ot the Uni-
versity of Southern California. Later she
took up legal practice. She was soon
appointed Referee of the local Probate
Court and held the position for more
than 10 years. The Governor of Cali-
fornia selected her in 1923 for the Muni-
cipal Bench, and she was assigned to the
Civil Division.
Alfred S. Kenyon, appointed by the
Vic. National Gallery Trustees to act as
their rep. on the historical committee of
the Centenary Council, which is to pre-
pare an account of the settlement ot Port
Phillip, is president of the Vic. Historical
Society, chairman of the ethnological
section of the Vic. Field Naturalists’
Club, a Public Library authority and lec-
turer on medals, an author of historical
works, and an engineer with the State
Rivers and Water Supply Commission.
His keen interest in Binghi is shown by
the name —Warringal—which he gave
to his Heidelberg home. Warringal was
the abo. name for Heidelberg until a
chap likened the district to the old Ger-
man township. Kenyon is one of the
finest speakers in Melbourne. His
daughter Justine is the author of an ex-
cellent book dealing with abo. nomen-
clature.
Rev. Ernest Davies, who has been
forced by a series of severe illnesses to
turn down the chairmanship of the
N.S.W. Congregational Union, is a Vic-
torian of Welsh extraction and went
to the West in goldrush days as a
Y.M.C'A. secretary. W. T. Kench, of
Roseville, N.S.W., then minister of
the Congregational Trinity Church,
Perth, had Davies trained by post from
Melbourne for the ministry, His ex-
aminers said it was impossible to give
him less than 100 per cent, in almost
every subject. He became chairman of
the Congregational Unions in W.A. and
Vic., and president of the Australasian
Union. During the latter term he im-
pressed world-famous preachers at the
Pan-Congregational meeting at Boston,
U.S.A.
A. S. Henry, whose Divorce Bill has
caused a stir in the N. S. Wales Assem-
bly, is an old King’s School boy and a
native of Warialda. He served with the
A.1.F., so he can bear Lang’s barrage

just as deep and turbulent as the
political ones which wash round him.
Was he not champion swimmer of the
North Coast of N. S. Wales? He is a
sincere and steadfast member, and his
seat at Grafton is as safe as any in
Australia.
Prior to taking command of the
Strathaird, Captain W. P. Townshend
(who has been with the P. and O.
for 35 years) was responsible for the
rescue of the crew of the Greek steamer
Theodore Bulgaris during a gale in the
Bay of Biscay two years ago. He corn-

manded H.M.S. Victoria at the Dardan-
elles, and was employed to lay heavy
nets in the anti-submarine area. Later
he became British assistant-captain at
Constantinople. He was mentioned in
dispatches, and was awarded the Order
of St. Anne of Russia.
Athol Thompson, the 21-year-old Mel-
bourne artist who won first prize
in the poster contest conducted for
the third annual Buffalo Chalet Ball,
lost both arms at the age of nine,
decided to become a commercial artist
at 13, and won his first open poster
competition at 20 with a “Wool Week”
illustration. Thompson was playing on a
woodstack in a Launceston timber yard
when his head touched electric wires. He
threw up his arms. They were badly
burned, and had to be amputated. At
Melbourne Working Men’s College he
trained his mouth to do the work of two
hands, and after his first year was
awarded a council scholarship. This has
been renewed for each year.' So expert
has he become that he now has the ambi-
tion to develop into a still-life and figure
painter. Already he has made serious
efforts at landscape painting under John
Rowell, and has won two open competi-
tions.
Elizabeth Reid McCombs has become
M.L.’s first woman M.P. ; she takes the
seat her husband occupied for 20 years as
representative of Lyttelton—his death
occasioned the by-election. As is the
general rule for Fernland politicians, Mrs.
McCombs has had an apprenticeship of
municipal service—l 2 years on Christ-
church’s City Council and hospital board
and seven years on the tramway board.
She is of Scottish descent, and, like the
Ma State’s ex-Premier Bavin, was born
at Kaiapoi (M.L.). She contested the
Kaiapoi sear in 1928,. and stood for
North Christchurch at last election.
Lyttelton gave her a thumping absolute
majority over the two other candidates.
Her only son is a Doctor of Science ;
her brother, A. G. Henderson, is editor
of the “Christchurch Times.” A very
handsome lady, a clear, concise speaker
and a keen debater, she is more apt to
make Parliament quail than to be afraid
of it.

N. S. Wales developed its biggest thirst
and Tooheys their best profit in 1928-29,
when the consumption of beer was put
at 29,475,000 gallons; the figure was
18,122,000 for 1931-32. Excise, 3d. per
gallon in 1914, was lifted from Is. 3d.
to 2s. in 1929. There have been a
heavy fall in the value of hotel proper-
ties, leases and rentals, and stinging in-
creases in income and other taxes.
After providing for contingencies, the
contraction in Tooheys’ gross earnings
over the last four years has been
£297,876, of which £200,241 was offset
by savings in exes., despite excise and
other levies: —•

Although conditions generally were a bit
better, declared earnings slipped £19,865

During the last term debtors’ balances
were reduced by £19,705, and £26,048
was tacked on to the amount coming
to sundry creditors. The lot and a bit
more was invested in hotels and other
fixed assets, up £49,883. Thus, excluding
loans from the subsidiary, the more or
less liquid surplus (£373,991) was £49,173
lighter than at the previous balance.
To keep finance as far as possible a
domestic matter, Tooheys Standard Secu-
rities was formed at the end of 1929.

put up most of the pref. money. Credi-

balance was £8719. Tooheys appear as
a debtor for £328,713. Allowing for the

The board called £116,243 of the year’s
takings net profit —£11,816 more than for
the previous term. That was after
£lO,OOO had dropped from somewhere
into the insurance account (£260,000);
the repairs, renewals and replacement
reserve (£200,000) was unchanged. The
“Wild Cat” believes both these accumu-
lations are genuine profit, and treats
them accordingly. Thus there was
enough to show 5.4 p.c. on capital, as
against 5.1, 4.8, 7, 6.4, 7.8 and 9.9. p.c.
back to 1927. So half a point was added
to the div., making it 5 p.c. for the
year. Still, the three-for-one bonus
issue in 1919 makes 5 p.c. worth 15
p.c. on capital as it stood immediately
before the gift.
The growth of the figures over the
last couple of years suggests a steady
improvement in inter-State trade. The
co., however, has ships enough to take
care of a much bigger business. To
lighten overhead, and, incidentally, in-
crease the return from investments, two
more freighters were sold during the
last term, making the total half a dozen
since the close of accounts in 1931, and
another old coal hulk was scuttled.
What the deals turned in has not been
announced, and any profit or loss thereon
has apparently been adjusted through
inner reserves. Though the published
figures are well compounded, the co.
is known to be very strongly ribbed.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures show it:

*Not including provident fund, £220,898, 1932 ;
£229,317, 14)33.
The year’s surplus earnings, includ-
ing the addition to the insurance reserve,
together with £8419 added to the provi-
dent fund (£229,317—n0t included in
the table) and reductions of £11,668 in
debtors’ balances, etc., and £5651 in
stocks, etc., enabled £18,599 to be
knocked off the amount coming to credi-
tors and the big blanket item (it includes
a wad of Government securities) to be
strengthened by £28,749.
It is difficult to say when the co.’s coal
interests, which used to contribute sub-
stantially to the pool, will-again send
along much in the way of dividends.

It used to be a steady 10 per center
with wide margins; but the indus-
try had become overcapitalised. See-
ing trouble ahead, this co. and Aus-
tralian Cement (the only producer
in Vic.) decided that the best way
to ensure a place in the race was
to go on the market together. That
was at the end of 1929. Each took
a million paids in Australian Portland,
which became the operating co., con-
trolling plant in N. S. Wales and Vic.
with a combined annual plant capacity
of some 450,000 tons, about a third
of the total plant capacity of the Com-
monwealth.
No hint is given as to what the opera-
ting co. has sent along. The £14,820
of profit shown in 1932 seems to
have come from interest on Con-
sols, fixed deposits, etc., and the co.’s
commission earnings (it acts as manag-
ing agent for the operating co. in
N.S.W.). During the last term, expendi-
ture on public works increased, and
there was more activity in other con-
struction work, especially in Victoria.
Net earnings sprang- £26,217, reach-
ing 4.8 p.c. on capital as against 1.7 p.c.
and 5.1 p.c. for the two preceding terms.
The div. was lifted 2\ points, making it
5 p.c., though reserves had to be tapped
for £1079 to do it.
Prospects of the 5 p.c. being repeated
during the current term seem bright
enough. The N. S. Wales Government
has arranged for £2,500,000 at 4 p.c.
to be spent by the Sydney Water Board
over the next two and a half years. For
the 12 months to June 30 next esti-
mated loan expenditure on works by
all the State Governments is over
£17.000.000 ; and cement sales by private
contract are expected to increase, too,
thanks to the good work being done by
the Cement Manufacturers’ Association.
The market, however, with one eye
upon the overcrowded state of the indus-
try, prices the fully-paid pound shares
at 19s. 6d. as against 13s. 9d. and 11s.
12 months and two years ago respec-
tively. The book value of the cover is
28s. in net tangibles, mainly plant, worth
what it can earn.
Finances are comfortable enough:

The table summarises. the p. and 1.
figures of Lincoln Mills (Aus.). The co.
owns the scrip, or most of it, in two
manufacturing subsidiaries, Lincoln Spin-
ning Mills, and Lincoln Knitting Mills ;
and up till the close of accounts in 1931
it owned very little else. After that the
holding co. undertook distribution of
the subsidiaries’ outputs. There were
savings, prices steadied, stocks became
less troublesome and earnings improved,
thanks largely to the tariff and exchange.
Here are the trading figures of the
three cos. in the group combined:

during the last term. Exes, took only
£4570 of the increase, leaving enough
to pay a year’s pref. div. (£36,000) and
then show 26 p.c. on ord. capital. But
the pref. div. was 4 p.c. in arrears, so
13 p.c. was distributed ; the balance was

Last year £24,392 was spent on additions
to premises and plant, and £25,198 was
written off. The rise in wool prices
should eliminate some of the risks of
larger stocks. The year’s improvement
in " the more or less liquid surplus
(£296,602, including stocks) was £23,088.
Over the last 12 months the market
has advanced its bids for the prefs. from
20s. Bd. to 28s. 3d. The return at the
higher figure is 6.3 p.c. The ords. at
4s. Bd. would return 8.7 p.c. on a 10
p.c. distribution.
The Moulton Group Again
E. S. Moulton, managing director of
E. S. and R. C. Moulton, Ltd., comes
back:
Moulton, Ltd., has no “net of interlocking
cos.,” and the co.’s so-called “extravagant pros-
pectus estimates and promises” are substantiated
by experts.
Moulton, Ltd., does not control, and never
has controlled, Queensland Forests, Ltd.,
in any way. The achievement of the National
Tobacco Corp. is not discreditable. The co.
was incorporated in June, 1930. It has a paid
capital of £42,486. During 1930-32 it
issued debentures to the value of £15,000. Be-
cause the corporation was able to make profits
from sources outside the growing of tobacco,
it has experienced no difficulty in paying de-
benture-holders 10 p.c. interest per annum to
date, and in more than “breaking even on its
activities. E. S. and R. C. Moulton.
Ltd., had no shareholding interests in the
National Tobacco Corp. at the time of the
issue ot debentures. It has recently, however,
purchased and paid for in full 15,000 £1
snares in the corporation at par. Moreover,
betore Moulton, Ltd., invited prospective in-
vestors to take up tobacco Manufacture in-
vestment Contracts, Moulton, Ltd., purchased
the shares ieferred to.
As for the assertion that a Moulton, Ltd.,
prospectus is endeavoring to unload tobacco
shares and land on behalf of unspecitied
vendors, and that a 96 p.c. interest in a
tobacco manufacturing co., with a subscribed
capital of £25,000, is generously ottered tor
£36,000; Moulton, Ltd., is not endeavoring to
"unload” anything. It has invited the co-
operation ot persons prepared to contract with
it in the development of tobacco manufacture.
Moreover, it previously had sufficient confi-
dence in the business to purchase 24,000 £1
shares at a premium of 10s. per share.
The “Wild Cat” implies that E. S. and R. C.
Moulton, Ltd., was responsible for the “differ-
ent tale” told to National Tobacco Corp. de-
benture-holders. Moulton, Ltd., had nothing
whatever to do with the meeting of deben-
ture-holders at which this “different tale”
was told.
The implication that because E. S. Moulton is
a director of both Moulton, Ltd., and Australa-
sian Trustees and Executors, the Trustee Co. if»
“another Moulton concern” is utterly foolish.
Moulton, Ltd., does not hold shares in the
Trustee Co., and has no interest in its business,
excepting to the extent that it has entered into
a Deed of Trust with the Trustee Co. to fultil
its obligations to the tobacco manufacture in-
vestment contractees, and has transferred to the
Trustee Co. certain securities to guarantee ful-
filment of the contract.
The “Wild Cat” purposes to show that whilst
the National Tobacco Corp. of Australia was
asking its debenture-holders to agree to a diver-
sion of capital from tobacco-growing to other
more profitable industries, Moulton, Ltd., was
encouraging investors to invest in the same
industry. That is not so. E. S. and R. C.
Moulton, Ltd., invited the public to become
tobacco manufacture investment contractees.
The very name of the investment indicates
from what source the bulk of the profits are to
come; i.e., the manufacture of tobacco.
The fact that the meeting of National
Tobacco Corporation’s “A” debenture-holders
unanimously agreed to defer action pending
production of the balance-sheet is a sure indi-
cation that the debenture-holders were interested
in the conversion and desired to have up-to-date
figures to enable them to make a decision.
The concluding words of the article, “the
fact that scarcely any profit was earned to
June, 1932, indicates how they would have
fared as preference shareholders,” are typical
of The Bulletin. If the debenture-holders had
been preference shareholders at June, 1932,
practically the whole of the 10 p.c. interest
which was paid before the small profit for the
year was disclosed would have been available
for payment to them as preference dividends.
To which the “Wild Cat” replies:
The facts are that in 1927 E. S. and R. C.
Moulton, Ltd., received 20,000 fully-paid ords.
in Queensland Forests; Amalgamated Forests'
holding in the same concern, at 8/11 /’32, was
48,302 shares. Commercial Credit Corp. issued
10,000 ords. to Amalgamated Forests for good-
will, plans, etc. The holding of Moulton, Ltd.,
in Q.F. at 8/11/’32 totalled 1504 shares; at the
same date Moultons also held 26,333 shares in
Amalgamated.
Amalgamated held 4000 shares in Aust.
Trustees and Execs, (which is supposed to look
after the interests of bondholders, debenture-
holders, etc., in Amalgamated), 45,000 shares
(not a penny had been paid on 35,000 of them)
in the Commercial Credit Corp., and 3800 in
the National Tobacco Corp. Moulton, Ltd.,
held the following direct interests: 6000 shares,
on which nothing had been paid, in the Com-
mercial Credit Corp.; 1504 shares in Q.F., and
27,025 shares in Mt. Etna Fertilisers. Victorian
Securities, Pty., held 40,240 shares in Q.F.
Queensland Forests at 8/11/ ’32 held 6517
shares in Amalgamated; it also held 1150 in
Aust. Trustees and Execs., which in turn held
7500 shares in Q.F. Mt. Etna Fertilisers owned
7000 shares in National Tobacco. E. S. and
R. C. Moulton, Ltd., was thus the centre of
a most extraordinary network of interlocking
cos. Directorates interlocked, too.
Further, in the Commercial Credit Corp., out
of a subscribed capital of £86,782 there were
71,225 shares on which not a ha’penny had been
paid. Total paid capital was £10,122, of which
£5OOO represented other than cash considera-
tion. In Associated Tobacco Manufacturers,
though at 25/5/’32 the issued capital was £BOO2,
only £2 was paid up! There has been some
traffic in shares of the group. In view of this
and of the share purchases referred to by Mr.
Moulton, and of the unloading arrangements of
the “Tobacco Contract” prospectus (Mr.
Moulton denies knowledge of these, though the
prospectus, carrying his name, clearly states that
shares in certain of these cos. have been
“secured” for contractees, and does not specify
the vendors), the “Wild Cat” is not prepared
even to guess at what the position is to-day.
At 4/8/’32 E. S. Moulton held 300 shares
in Aust. Trustees and R. C. 200. But on 5/5/’32
R. C. and E. S. each unloaded parcels of 2000
shares. On 25/2/’32 Amalg. Forests sold
Moulton, Ltd., 1504 shares in Queensland
Forests. During the year to 8/11/’32, R. C.
Moulton sold 958 shares in Amalgamated to
E. S. Moulton, 109 to F. C. Lodge and 3308
to E. S. and R. C. Moulton, Ltd. E. S. Moul-
ton also unloaded 4300 Amalgamated shares
on to Moulton, Ltd. Moulton, Ltd., in turn
sold 6517 Amalgamated shares to Q.F.
At 21/5/’32 the capital of Associated Tobacco
Manufacturers was mainly held by E. S. and
other members of the Moulton family, and
directors of Moulton companies. The “Tobacco
Investment” prospectus says E. S. and R. C.
Moulton, Ltd., has since acquired control of
this concern; indeed, it is able to offer a 96
p.c. interest for £36,000. Meantime, the capital
has been increased.
Page 10 of the “Tobacco Investment Con-
tract” prospectus is headed “The Organisation,”
with E. S. and R. C. Moulton, Ltd. as the
“Controlling Co.” The other cos. include Aust.
Trustees and Execs.. Associated Tobacco, Amal-
gamated Forests, National Tobacco Corp. and
Commercial Credit Corp. No copy of the
trust deed is incorporated in the Moulton pros-
pectus. A previous edition of this document
said that “On accentance of your application
at the co.’s head office the contract will be
prepared and forwarded to you direct.” These
contracts will be deemed to be “fulfilled and
automatically cancelled” after Dec., 1952. or
“such earlier date as the contractee shall have
reecived ten times the amount invested.” Over

When a man is
TWENTY-FIVE
ALL ages are good ages at which to seize upon the benefits of Life
Assurance. Many men have had their first policy taken out for
them when they were a year old. Many do not take out their
larger policies until they reach middle age; there is opportunity for
making this soundest of all investments at all ages; but perhaps the
best age is that wonderful time in a man’s life when he is “putting
forth the tender leaves of hope” as Shakespeare has put it; when he
sees the world before him and determines that it shall be his.
When a man is 25, that is the time when he should begin seriously to
put portion of his income into A.M.P. policies that he may build up
his assets, secure his future (and that of his wife and family if he have
them in contemplation) and lay the foundations of his fortunes.
It costs so little to begin! For the investment of a few shillings a week
a man of 25 can have a £5OO policy in the A.M.P., the greatest Mutual
Life office in the Empire.
Let every young man send for a copy of a new book, Investing in
Happiness.” Gladly will it be posted to him. It tells some human
stories of how men have succeeded through the aid of the A.M.P.

“Up to £75,000” is to be deposited with the
trustee. Tuppence-ha’penny handed over would
satisfy that condition, for all the prospectus
says to the contrary. As to dividends (if any)
paid by the “organisation” in the past the
prospectus is mute. As to sources of income
under the contracts, the cover says in bold
type: “This booklet tells you how you may
become financially interested in two of Aus-
tralia’s great money-making industries tobacco
cultivation and tobacco manufacture.” On page
10, the prospectus also gives “Cultivation
pride of place: “The cash dividends will include
all profits earned... .including dividends receiv-
able from the manufacture of all-Australian
tobacco by Associated Tobacco Manufacturers
Pty., Ltd., and from large interests in the
National Tobacco Corp. of Aust., Ltd., Amal-
gamated Forests (Aust.), Ltd., and the Com-
mercial Credit Corp. of Aust., Ltd., as well as
profits to be derived from the CULTIVATION
OF TOBACCO on selected tobacco lands”
The italics and capitals are those of the pros-
pectus.
As the “Wild Cat” said, scarcely any profit
was earned by the National Tobacco Corp.
during 1932. Gross earnings were £3236; exes.,
£3038, leaving £l9B net. Concealment of the
sources of revenue makes it impossible for
outsiders to determine where the money came
from. In the sheet, nominal capital is
stated to be in 25,000 10 p.c. prefs. and 75,000
ords., all £1 shares, but paid capital is shown
in one line at £35,743. A search at the Regis-
trar-General's was necessary to find that at
8/11/ ’32 £4802 of the capital was in pret.
shares. If debenture-holders had held this class
of security at that date there would have been
£4802 more to pay divs. on, quite apart from
any prior mortgages that might have been
raised.
Queensland’s gold production for
August, 1933, was 7821 fine oz. Mt.
Coolon (28470 z.) and Mt. Morgan
(2808 oz.) were in the lead. Between
them they contributed nearly 75 p.c. of
the State’s yield, which was 67240 z.
better than for August, 1932. But the
old fields produced it all—Batavia and
Gladstone supplied an extra 7480 z.
Batavia has always been a small and
spasmodic producer; Gladstone’s 5150 z.
came mostly from Geo. Goody’s rich
claim at Calliope. The Hodgkinson field
is one that may hold a surprise in the
near future, a couple of heavy options
having been landed recently by energetic
prospectors.

Returns from Gilmore tin, Mt. Garnet
(N.Q.), have been so good that a co.
is being formed to work it. A small
party located the lode in the old work-
ings at a depth of 250 ft., and since the
beginning of this year about 50 tons of
tin concentrates, worth £7OOO, has been
recovered. Present production averages
50 tons of 4 p.c. ore weekly, and the
shoot has been proved for a length of
60ft. and an average width of Bft. to 10ft.
With concentrates marketing around
£l7O per ton, the ore is worth between
£6 and £7 a ton. This striking success
has revived inquiry into the old tinmines
of the district.
* * * *
The last crushing of Canberra Tin,
Herberton (N.Q.), was 64 tons for
£3147, the grade being 73.7 oxide. This
was obtained by four men in a couple
of months. A big low-grade deposit
would be a godsend to the field; it
would greatly increase employment.

Holmes and Doherty, while sinking a
shaft on the boundary of Mulhall and
Hinder’s new find at Boughyard Creek,
Cracow (Q.), have struck the ore channel.
Dish prospects show a satisfactory tail
of gold, but it is too soon yet to say
whether values will live down. Other
parties are prospecting further down the
creek towards Cracow station.
* * * *
Enterprise Gold, Cooktown (N.Q.), is
satisfied with its first month’s crushing of
53 tons for 62|oz. In the main shaft the
reef is 2ft. 6in. wide at the 96ft. level ;
it is hoped that the principal ore-body
will be struck at 120 ft. Two other shafts
are being put down. The lode has been
traced for half a mile.

White Hope South, Cracow (Q.), has
reached the Golden Plateau lode about
150 ft. from the boundary. Work is being
pushed on in search of payable stone.
Boring on the surface has been discon-
tinued.

Golden Plateau, Cracow (Q.), has com-
pleted its check assays, the average value
being 725. per ton (gold at 855.). The
average width of the formation is 10ft.

Bulolo Gold Dredging recovered
8045 fine ounces of gold from 488,900
c.y. during August. With gold at £7
10s. an ounce the output was worth
£60,337, of which £48,247 was working
profit. No. 3 dredge, which should begin
to dig in about the middle of October,
is expected to reach payable material a
month later.

The joint agreement between Boulder
Perseverance and North Kalgurli pro-
vides for enlargement of Perseverance’s
plant from 7000 tons to 14,000 tons a
month. Perseverance’s quota is 9000 tons
and N. Kalgurli’s 5000 tons; if either
co. falls short of it the other has
the right to fill the gap. A working co.
with a share capital of £lOOO (Persever-
ance £635, N. Kalgurli £365) and a deben-
ture capital of £124,000 (Perseverance
£79,360, N. Kalgurli £44,640) will weld
the interests of the pair. The debentures
are redeemable at the rate of £12,500
p.a. The directors of the two old cos.
will be directors of the working co.,
without fees.

Shareholders in North Kalgurli (W.A.),
which recently issued 250,000 new shares,
used to be told that the co. hadn’t any
riches worth mentioning. But tributors
got possession, finds were made, and a
strong cash position was built up out of
royalties. Later the co. resumed, and, by
treating ore from development, put the
venture on its feet. There is promise of
another 6d. div. in December. Ore in
sight is conservatively estimated at
350,000 tons, averaging about lOdwt.

Herbert Gepp, technical consultant to
the Commonwealth, advocates wider
geological surveys on the Golden Mile.
He says that the operations of Dr. F. L.
Stillwell, who a few years ago co-ordin-
ated the mine plans and surveys at
depths of 400 ft. to the lowest levels,
have been invaluable in proving the
existence of large ore-bodies ; and the
work should now be done over distances
of 200 ft. by Dr. Stillwell again.

Ora Banda has exercised its option on
Nicholson and Griffith's lease at Grant’s
Patch (W.A.). During the last six months
enough gold was taken out of the show
to pay the purchase price. On the
strength of this the shares appreciated
a few shillings, and are tipped to go
higher. Some mining men who have
seen the show reckon that it is impressive
in a small way ; others don’t.

A Sydney crowd with plenty of cash

While the Lake View and Star can-
not do everything at once, the time is
coming when its almost virgin areas to

South Kalgurli has recently acquired
ground even further south indicates
someone has faith in the possibilities of
this section.

Banda North.

South Kalgurli Consolidated (W.A.)

At King of the Hills, Comet Vale,
(W.A.), a new reef, 100 ft. long, has been

others are cats of the wildest breed.

qualified mining engineer should be
frowned upon by the Stock Exchanges

Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) is still

opment averaged 12dwt.

A hullabaloo is being made by the
Westralian Prospecting Association
against the granting of reservations of
auriferous country by the State Govern-
ment. There exist at present 49 tempor-
ary mining reservations, covering an area
of 1,153,584 acres, together with “all river”
rights on certain nor’-west streams. One
co., the Western Mining Corporation, in
which the Robinsons and other Anglo-
Australian speculators are interested,
holds 1430 square miles. It has geologists
and mining engineers at work, and
intends to employ geophysical and aerial
prospectors.

SHADOW SHOWS.
The chief attractions of “The Good
Companions,” at the Prince Edward, are
its English voices and scenes. To gaze
upon the simplicities of the domestic
shots, railway stations and so on, after a
course of American country houses
which resemble Versailles except for their
cubist interiors, is a blessed relief.
The plot is essentially English, too,
being based upon the fortunes of a
pierrot troupe called the “Dinky Doos.”
No race but the infinitely tolerant Eng-
lish could take to their hearts an organi-
sation with such a name, and none but
the English could put up for long with
the particular brand of pawky sentimen-
talism in which Mr. Priestley specialises.
That fine actor Edmund Gwenn is the
Yorkshire carpenter with a heart of gold
and a head of wood who takes to the
road to escape from his nagging wife,
and encounters a Devonshire spinster
with a two-seater and fond memories of
a doctor whom she met in the long ago
aboard a P. and O. ship. John Gielgud is
the “D.D.’s” pianist (his dismissal from
his job as usher in a modern Dotheboy’s
Hall, which caused him to join up with
the troupe, provides some excellent
comedy), and Jessie Matthews is the
song-and-dance star who learns to love
him. Percy Parsons and A. W. Bask-
comb, sound character-actors both, par-
ticipate in the trials and triumphs of a
busking life till the exciting climax, when
hooligans are hired by the villain to give
the performers the bird and destroy the
show, but are themselves destroyed.
As in so many other British pictures,
the juvenile leads are weak, not to say
dreadful. There is something to be said
for John Gielgud’s ladylike ways and
looks ; he is the kind of lad who might
be expected to become a pierrot. But
the doctor is so consistently actorish that
the B.M.A. might put up a fairly strong
case against him for unprofessional con-
duct. Everybody overplays ; particularly
Jessie Matthews, a confirmed eye-roller
and gum-displayer. This is in accord-
ance with British stage tradition, but it
is a serious defect in a film which claims
to depict the reticent English middle
classes. It seems more marked by com-
parison with the convention of under-
statement which Hollywood took over
from the classic French stage and has
accustomed Australian audiences to in
recent years.
The Prince Edward has an interesting
first part, which includes a travelogue of
Windsor Castle, and some symbolic
dances by Inge Stange, a picturesque
German girl.
* * v
“International House,” at the Regent,
is worth the admission money, and more,
for W. C. Fields, alone. He portrays a
drink-raVenous American professor who
is touring the world in an autogiro, heav-
ing dead marines overboard as he goes.
He lands in the grounds of a luxury
hotel in China, and, with his battered tall
hat, walking-stick and genial yet trucu-
lent countenance, proceeds to give a
brilliant portrait of a type of alcoholist
who, though common in every com-
munity, has never before been seen on
the screen so far as this critic is aware.
He is one of those drunks who never
get drunk. The kind of human tank
who inspires ordinary pub-loafers with
awe. The more he pours into himself,
the more large, rank cigars he smokes,
the better he feels, the more briskly
self-confident he becomes, and the more
abominably he behaves.
Fields’s chief foil is a twittering hotel
manager who looks on in futile despair
as he storms destructively about the
premises. Peggy Joyce Hopkins, as a
gold-digger, and Stuart Erwin and Sari
Maritza (lovers) are also in it, and the
hotel patrons are shown Rudy Vallee
and one or two more by television ; but
they are all insignificant compared with
Fields.
“I Cover the Waterfront” is the love-
idyll of an ambitious young reporter
(Ben Lyon) and a sweet girl (Claudette
Colbert) set against a background of
murdered Chinese. Claudette’s . dipso-
maniacal and half-loony father, Ernest
Torrence, earns his living by smuggling
Chinese into the U.S.A. in a fishing
boat, the Chinese being thrown over-
board in chains if a revenue-boat
appears. As a sideline he smuggles
bottles of beer hidden in fish. Lyon gets
hold of one of Torrence’s corpses and
dumps the horror on his editor’s table,
but the editor doesn’t regard it as “news,”
and Lyon flounces out of the sanctum
in disgust. However, he proves his jour-
nalistic ability later on, and wins
Claudette; and the morbid and dis-
jointed production comes to a welcome
end.
“The Eagle and the Hawk,” at the
Capitol, which is embellished with a con-
vincing series of air-fight pictures,
features Fredric March. He is an
R.A.F. ace. He goes, time after time,
into engagements which result in the
death of his machine-gunner. He has an
enemy (Cary Grant) and a sweetheart
(Carole Lombard), but neither of these
interests is sufficient to prevent him put-
ting a hole in his forehead when he gets
yet another medal for an achievement
that involves the decease of his associate.
The medal was bestowed by a French
general, who spoke rapidly in the lan-
guage of his country —a touch that lends
an air of verisimilitude. Other aids are
’planes, machine-guns and cameras that
stand any test of authenticity. Almost
every scene is a stage-picture composed
with resources unavailable to the stage,
with its dimensional restrictions.
“Whistling in the Dark” is another
one with a “perfect murder” theme.
Cyanide of potassium is popped into the
victim’s toothpaste by someone who
ransacks his bag in a train. Ernest Truex
is principal comedian, and Una Merkel,
who has two chins and promises of a
third and fourth, supports him. Their
bedroom scenes, which are quite irrele-
vant to the story, suggest that Creswell
O’Reilly is no better than Homer after
FLASHES FROM SYDNEY FLICKIRS.

all; but they are preferable to the last
half-hour of the opus, which depends
for its humor on communications over
a telephone line which is supposed to
be dead, but isn’t.

The first instalment of “Secrets” at
Sydney Lyceum depicts Mary Pickford’s
elopement with Leslie Howard and their
pioneering work in California. Its climax
is their triumph over cattle-duffers.
Then we find Leslie in the middle
of a Parliamentary campaign. He has
been untrue to Mary, and the gentle
and noble creature offers to release him
or stand by him.
Finally we get the second elope-
ment of the now white-haired couple
—this time from their children. Mary
has managed her spouse so capably that
he has become a Senator, and the child-
ren, basking in his light, clamor against
his intended resignation.
Mary Pickford looks eighteenish and
eightyish with equal skill, and the set-
tings are charming. Interesting glimpses
are given of old-timers Bessie Barriscale,
Ethel Clayton, of the flowing draperies
and poker-stiff back, and Allan Sears,
Mary’s leading man in the days that the
locust hath chewed.
In “The Shadow,” Scotland Yardsmen
have the unusual experience of being
fired at from the top of their chief’s
staircase. They are after a blackmailer
who drives people to suicide. They get
the ruffian in the end, but only with
the aid of Elizabeth Allen. You’ll be
surprised to discover who the malefactor
is.

“ln Heads We Go,” at the Plaza, Con-
stance Cummings is a mannequin who
thinks Frank Lawton is rich. She and
her friend Binnie Barnes spend all they
have on a holiday trip with the object of
enabling Constance to meet him. On
the boat he turns up as a steward. Con-
tance prolongs the holiday by posing as
a film star. Then Frank turns up again,
first as the ladies’ host at a yachting
party, then as a ticket-collector, and
finally as himself —a millionaire’s heir.
They are all amusing, especially Binnie
Barnes as a hard-boiled working girl.
Gus McNaughton and Claude Hulbert
are in the cast.
“Facing the Music” stars Stanley
Lupino. He sings a little, dances a
little and fools quite a lot.
In order to meet a girl he appoints
himself publicity manager to a prima
donna, the girl’s aunt. As an advertis-
ing stunt, he arranges to steal the prima
donna’s jewels, but things go wrong and
they really are stolen. The rest of it
consists of a farcical back-stage hunt
for the thief. The whole show hangs on
Lupino, and it rarely drags.
* *
“Lucky Dog,” at the Haymarket, is
about Buster, a brindle whose master is
gaoled for embezzlement. For six sad
months Buster searches for him, and is
kicked from garbage-bin to gutter. And
then his master is released for good be-
havior and nearly bashes poor Buster’s
brains out by mistake.
Comedian-author Chic Sale is the
master. He plays the part on tragic
lines. Altogether a depressing effort.
“The Crooked Circle,” a thriller, con-
tains Zasu Pitts, of the weaving hands
and tear-heavy voice. Also the usual
old mansion where something horrible
is always happening to somebody, the
amateur detectives, and the suspected
assassin who unmasks the real assassin
in the last sequence. Ben Lyon and Irene
Purcell and Zasu Pitts and James Glea-
son pair off at the finish. Gleason, as in
previous films, is an incompetent police-
man.
Sundry Shows
“The Quaker Girl,” revived by the
Firm at Sydney Royal on Saturday, is
melodically one of the feeblest of the
Monckton operettas. Its plot is neither
better nor worse than those of others of
the series of Gilsullivan imitations that
kept theatres busy from 1890 till the out-
break of the Great War. Saturday night’s
performance was one of those chummy
affairs, like a family reunion, for which
Sydney is becoming famous. Cyril Ritch-
ard, Madge Elliott, Gus Bluett, Leo
Franklyn and other members of the co.
were given ovations of the sort that used
to be reserved for a Bernhardt or a
Melba, and while they were acknow-
ledging these compliments, and for some
time afterwards, the popular mummers
paid very little attention to the play.
However, it went very well. The chorus
sang with spirit; the orchestra was up
to the best MacCunn standard ; scenery
and lighting were ingenious and artistic.
The dancing of the principals had much
more of the virtuoso flavor than their
singing, but the lyrics were quite plea-
santly recited.
¥
“Music in the Air” started spraying
the theatrical ether in Melbourne at the
Royal on Saturday. It is on a popular
wave-length and appears to be unaffected
by static. In fact, better songs of the
musicomedy variety, finer singing and
lovelier choruses haven’t been heard in
the vicinity for a long time. When bird-
breeder Sydney Burchall has possession
of the microphone listeners have antici-
patory experience of the ineluctible de-
lights of Sworga, the Hindu Heaven,
where even the crows have voices like
Jan Kiepura. Notes of a peculiar rich-
ness roll out of Burchall with the ease
of TOU’s from a State Treasurer’s office.
Sylvia Welling impresses present com-
mentator as one of the most accom-
plished musicomedy stars he has seen in
his present incarnation ; in fact, she
wipes out the recollection of all but a
couple of the others. An artful combina-
tion of the shrinking soubrette and the
woman of experience makes her an en-
gaging subject for contemplation from
the d.c. jurybox. Cecil Kelleway, as a
sentimental old gent., stands out from
amongst the males, though his touching
performance is momentarily put in the
shade when Lou Vernon, as conductor
of a theatre orchestra, makes an impas-
sioned appeal for amateur actors and
actresses to keep on the audience side of
the footlights—a piece of professional
propaganda which roused hearty
applause on Saturday from one corner
of the house suspected of being in-
habited mainly by dramatic critics.
Frank Sale is also notable for some good
acting as a playwright, but John Moore,
who has borrowed some of Theo Shall’s
manner along with his peculiar braces, is
inclined to be stagey.
The unravelling of “Rope” engaged the
undivided attention of Thring’s company
and a packed house at Melb. Garrick on
Saturday. Patrick Hamilton’s play opens
with a murder in the dark. The corpse,
that of the young and beloved son of
Sir Johnstone Kentley, is being stuffed
into a chest in the drawing-room of a
Mayfair flat by Wyndham Brandon
(Campbell Copelin) and Charles Granillo
(Paul O’Loughlin), two Oxford graduates
to whom tne perpetration of a motive-
less, passionless, clueless homicide ap-
peals as a welcome diversion in the
monotony of post-war life. To add
piquancy to the jest, they invite the father,
aunt and three friends of the deceased to
supper, which is served on the lid of the
chest.
After this the fun waxes fast and
furious. Frank Harvey, as a poet self-
enveloped in a fog of cynicism, proceeds
with masterly aplomb to scent the real
purpose of the party. The assassins’
Achilles’ heel is their vanity—no con-
scienceless murderer can refrain from
bragging of his crime, and hence the
murder is not motiveless at all. One of the
slayers assists in their betrayal by get-
ting drunk, and the exposure comes with
melodramatic force that trembles on the
verge of bathos but never quite takes the
plunge. The final curtain descends with
the leading murderer’s self-composure in
ruins and the poet virtuously whistling
for the police.
There was little to choose in point of
polish between the acting of Campbell
Copelin, Paul O’Loughlin and Frank
Harvey, though the English actor had the
largest role and filled it with his usual
skill. Roger Barry, Noel Boyd, Harold
Meade and Nellie Mortyne gave flawless
interpretations of minor parts.
* # *
On Saturday night Theo Shall made
an eminently successful appearance as
lead in “Baby Mine” at Melb. King’s.
This piece is a farce-comedy of pre-war
vintage which Frank Neil could only
have overlooked by some unfortunate
accident. It gives the Viennese star the
opportunity to steal three babies, to run
on and off stage and up and down lad-
ders with the purloined property con-
cealed under his coat, to hide in a double
bed, fall out of it, crawl under it and
otherwise give the upper circle a pain
in its ribs and the intellectual theatre-
goer a pain in the neck. To add to the
fun, Josie Melville rushed over from Syd-
ney to add grace to a part. Bebe Scott
played the trying-to-be-a-mother role
(which required her to cry over three
babies in turn) with unflagging energy,
and there was a plot which present com-
mentator couldn’t even give the outline
of if he were threatened with the sack.
Melbourne King’s on Saturday night, in
short, was the scene of the most remark-
able back-somersault in local theatrical
history since Maurice Moscovitch, billed
as a world-renowned Shakspearean inter-
preter, took to Edgar Wallace at the
Royal. Mr. Shall was heard to say
recently that he had no fewer than sixty
plays of the intellectual Viennese school
under his hat. He must have mislaid
his hat.

STARS and
METEORS
IV/TETEORS flash across the skies, dazzling
in their momentary brilliance, before
dissolving in the gaseous heat of their own
velocity.
However brilliant Meteors may be they are
useless for guidance .... the ship that comes
home, lays its course by the known Stars, the
permanent beacons to security and success.
Looking back over the past twenty years
and more, many meteoric business concerns
of various kinds come to mind, which in
their brief career have but served to add to
the lustre of those that have
prevailed.
For over twenty years the unfailing
guidance of the O’Brien Publicity
Company has helped to bring home
many business ships to their har-
bours of good Fortune and
Prosperity.
The steady growth of this firm,
from small beginnings, is in itself
its best recommendation to those
who wish to place their advertising
welfare in the hands of competent,
experienced people.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Bill L.”: The class had been given a
lecture on snakebite, its risks and rem-
edies, and the time had arrived to test
the amount of knowledge absorbed. The
teacher turned to a solemn-faced lad in
the front row. “Albert,” she rapped out
sharply, “what would you do if a snake
bit you?” Albert had been more im-
pressed by the risks than the remedies,
and his face became more funereal than
ever. “Die!” was his firm response.
* * * *
“P.K.”: With all this hubbub about the
abos. in Arnhem Land, the time is ripe
for another yarn about the heroic pursuit
of an abo. by a trooper. The hunt lasts
for days, weeks sometimes, over rough,
unexplored country, mostly waterless,
until at last the fugitive is killed or cap-
tured. The story goes down well in the
cities, but the trooper looks sour, and
the white folk of the North give way to
hilarity. Consider the facts. Always in
these hunts the black travels alone.
Always he is afoot, unshod and un-
“I’ve a few left-off things you can have”
“But d’yer think they’d fit me, laiy." Our figgers are so diff’rent”
equipped. He has no waterbag, no
weapons (save of wood), no food, no
means of making fire. He has to travel
fast, and as he goes he must hunt, cook
his food and find water. The trooper is
well-mounted and well-armed, and has
packhorses to carry his food, water,
camp-gear and ammunition. He is
attended by a tracker, also armed.
The only advantage the fugitive has is
that he can choose his own route. But he
must get water, and on his track is a
native as skilled in bush lore as
he is. Should the chase be pro-
longed, the hunted one will probably be
forced into the territory of hostile tribes,
where his presence will be actively re-
sented. Then there’s the matter of feet.
An abo.’s tootsies are hard and tough, but
a few days’ fast going sees his feet so
bruised and swollen that they resemble
outsizes in boxing gloves. Rarely, if ever,
is a fight put up by the fugitive when
cornered. Usually he is sneaked on by
the tracker and trooper, and grabbed
while asleep. No wonder folk who know
something about it are tired of those
“Epics of the North.”
* * * *
“Gid”: Regarding shearing records
(B. 16/8/’33). In 1889, 561,000 sheep
were put through Milo station and 7000
bales of greasy wool and a consignment
of scoured were dispatched by rail from
Charleville.
* * * *
“Tiki”: How many Maoris lived in
M.L. at the time of the first pakeha con-
tact is not known. It is known that that
contact led to heavy mortality among the
native race. The introduction of epi-
demic diseases and firearms, some autho-
rities declare, reduced the Maori popula-
tion by at least one half before 1850.
Up till comparatively recent times each
successive census showed a dwindling
of the native race. About a decade ago
the decrease was checked, and the latest
estimate shows that during the 12 months
ended March 31 last the Maoris were in-
creasing three times as rapidly as the
pakehas. For the period between the
last two censuses (1926 and 1933) the
Maori increase was 11.7 p.c., and the
pakeha increase 9.02 p.c.—and the
pakehas get the benefit of migratory in-
flux. It is clear that the Maori has defi-
nitely survived the white invasion.
# * * *
“C.H.F.”: It must be close on half a
century since ’possums from Australia
were introduced into M.L.—the Canter-
bury Acclimatisation Society was respon-
sible. Now, like the rabbit, they are
indicted as a public nuisance, and trapped
remorselessly. At a recent Dunedin skin
sale nearly 40,000 skins were offered,
good sorts realising as high as 13s. 10d.,
with the average round about 7s. The
M.L. Government claims 6d. royalty on
every skin.
* * * *
“Liss”: “Sam’s” theory (B. 23 /8 / ’33)
that he must have been sober when he
saw a pink snake because there isn’t a
pub within 70 miles of the old Malakoff
paddock of Katandra station won’t hold
water. Even in 1906 there was a hostelry
actually on the area, at the so-called town
of Stamford. Forty miles along the
Winton-road lies Corfield, and a further
20 or so miles on is Olio, at both of
which places there was, and is, enter-
tainment for man and beast. Tangorin
Hotel is 65 miles south by road. Rich-
mond town is about the same distance
N.W., and Hughenden, in which there
were, in the early days of the century,
about eight inns, is only a short canter of
40 miles N.E. But the most famous of
the wayside shanties of those parts—it has
been gone a good many years—was the
old pub at the Whitewood tank, about
20 miles along the stock route to Win-
ton. I suspect that it was from here
“Sam” was returning when his scarlet
snake appeared.
* * * *
“M.G.”: I note that The Bulletin
spells “tea-tree,” not “ti-tree,” to indicate
the vegetation on our beaches. The tea-
tree spelling was introduced by Donald
Macdonald, of Melb. “Argus,” about
“Your husband’s sick, you say, and
you want something to tempt
nis appetite. How about a
pig’s face?’’
“But ’ee’s got one.”
twenty years ago. Previously, the shrub
had always been written “ti-tree.” I’m
not arguing whether Macdonald was right
or wrong, but he was shockingly incon-
sistent. About that time he was writing
articles on Aussie nomenclature, and he
started off by holding that the word
“iguana”—then always used —was incor-
rect zoologically and that the bushman’s
term, “goanna,” should be adopted. The
reptile was not an iguana, though it had
been mistaken for one by early settlers.
The result was that to-day “goanna” has
been admitted to the language. Later,
Macdonald argued that “tea-tree” should
be so spelled, because it resembled the
edible tree-plant—an absolute reversal of
his earlier argument, as he himself ad-
mitted when it was pointed out to him.
* * * *
“Terry”: I’m inclined to agree with
“Erua” (B. 16/8/’33) that domestic fowls
are impervious to strychnine and arsenic.
I have seen these poisons administered in
divers ways without any apparent ill
effects. Possibly there is something in
their blood that accounts for it. Human
beings can get the same immunity by
accustoming themselves to poison. I
know an old Hunter River identity who
takes strychnine as a medicine in allo-
pathic doses. Dipping his pocket-knife
into the bottle, he collects on the point
of the blade a dose that ought to kill
him, and tips the crystals into his mouth.
“It’s me heart,” he’ll explain ; “it ain’t
been too good lately.”
* * * *
“Wen”: After about two years on the
road 1380 mixed bullocks have gone to
rest on the pastures of three Mores
(N.S.W.) stations before being tran-
shipped to the abattoirs to provide break-
fasts for Sydney. This mob is the first
section of a lot of 4000 being sent from
Vestey’s stations for agistment. It is
an experiment; if it proves success-
ful the Moree district will probably get
a lot more N.T. cattle. This first mob
walked upwards of 2000 miles, as
well as being railed 720 miles from Quil-
pie to Goondiwindi. From long practice
they step along with the steadiness and
regularity of a battalion of soldiers, and
where grass is scarce the drovers have
no trouble in moving them 12 or 14
miles a day.
* * * *
“General Prac.”: One may doubt
whether crude opium (B. 30/8/’33) is as
lethal as the novels and scenarios claim.
I was surgeon for a time in a small ship
trading to Asian ports, and my berth
was right aft, over the quarters of the
Chinese crew. It was soon apparent that
on one night in seven, at any rate, I
would not sleep, for on Saturday nights
the watch below staged its weekly bender,
As the guttural talk beneath my feet
died away to nothing, an acrid smell,
faint at first, but gaining stature with
every minute, welled up the companion-
way and filled my room. Sometimes I
had to seek air on the well-deck out-
side. Yet that opium left no hang-over
behind it that I could see; the men
turned out next morning as fresh as the
dew. Old Lin, the dynamo-tender,
always spry and efficient, mended my
camera and did electrical repairs. He
was 60 if he was a day and the hardest
smoker in the ship, according to the
mate. It is morphine, the alkaloid de-
rived from opium, that causes physical
and moral damage, especially when in-
jected under the skin. Some experts
deny that it shortens life ; but the mor-
phinist’s path leads downwards, as a rule.
Only 10 per cent, of addicts give up the
habit.
* * * *
“Yarri”: Cecil Freer, who was re-
cently reported to have hired an aero-
plane to spy out fresh herds on his wide
hunting ground, is one of the last of the
old school of buffalo-shooters. For de-
cades he has been bowling over thou-
sands a year. Unlike other hunters, he
has always had an eye to the future ; he
carefully preserved the herd on Wild-
man River, shooting only the old cows
and surplus bulls, and thus year after
year kept up a regular supply of hides
from the one extensive buffalo run. From
the air he discovered haunts of the
“nanaparro” that had not been sus-
pected. Being light-built and a fine
horseman, Freer has often ridden in
northern races, and one year won the
Darwin Cup. Some years ago he was
offered a good retaining fee to ride in
Sydney, but the life of the buffalo camp
is more to his liking.
* * * *
“Nakh”: Melbourne Aquarium re-
cently acquired one of the gayest assort-
ments of fish imaginable. They did not
come from the reputed home of flamboy-
ant color and fantastic form, the tropics,
but from Bass Strait. Some fishermen
of Hastings claimed that the cold waters
of the Strait contained as brilliant fishy
fashions as the Barrier Reef or else-
where, and to justify their boast put down
a deep net and drew up an amazing
catch. The horseshoe trigger fish was
one of them, and it might have emanated
from the imagination of a modernist
painter.
* * * *
“Billy See”: Westralia’s standard
drought gauge is the Mundaring Weir,
wall of the big reservoir which supplies
the goldfields and much of the wheat-
belt with water. When the winter is
dry, as it has been, all eyes watch
it anxiously, since a failure to over-
flow is proof of drought. But only once
during its 30-odd years has the minia-
ture Niagara failed to put in an appear-
ance —in 1914, when the wheat yield for
the State reached a mere 1.9 bushels to
the acre. In normal years the cataract
begins to descend either late in June or
early in July. In 1925 it didn’t com-
mence till October, and this year the
water didn’t start moving over the spill-
ways till August.
“WHAT’S YOURS?”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With empty tuckerbags and footsteps slow
You may trudge across the sodden blacksoil
plain;
You may fail to make the smoky camp-fire glow
To dry your blankets soaking with the rain.
Unsheltered, you may hear the thunders peal
And fear the western rivers at their worst;
The gnawing pangs of hunger you may feel
And fight the fiercer agonies of thirst.
As through the long, long shearing day you
bend,
You may feel your heart sink almost to your
boots,
While you hold the roughest cobbler ever
penned
And your penmates’ sheep are sliding down
the shoots.
But when at last your roving days are done,
The many hardships outback man endures
Will pass and be forgotten, every one,
At the old familiar greeting, “Hey! What’s
yours?"

“Barangkali”: I don’t wonder at the
Javanese boy’s lack of interest in the de-
scription of “Ida D.’s” red-beilied snake
(B. 6/9/’33)_ Known as “Ular Merah,”
the snake is common throughout the East
Indies and is harmless. It is popular
amongst the natives, having the reputation
of living on rats. It is very timid and
seeks coyer at the slightest disturbance,
but, if cornered, endeavors to bluff its way
out with a great show of fight, hissing,
striking and going through all manner of
intimidating manoeuvres. Then it such
denly rolls over on its back, opens its
jaws and throws its head around until a
white foamy substance wells from the
mouth. After that there’s a last convul-
sive shudder, and red-belly suddenly be-
comes limp and motionless, remaining
in that condition until it considers the
danger has passed.
$ jfc sj:
“Huon”: Tas. people don’t share the
poor opinion expressed by “Furneaux”
(B. 6/9/ ’33) regarding the unpalatability
of mutton-birds. The demand is such that
a couple of years ago 120,000 were taken
off one small island (Trefoil), and the
Flinders Group supplied over half a mil-
lion. I was on Three Hummocks Island
during the birding season that year when
a fisherman friend called in to lunch.
He ate seven mutton-birds. When asked
to have another, he excused himself
by saying he really wasn’t very fond of
them unless they were cooked exactly to
his taste. During a trip to Irish Town
(n.-w. Tas.) I was chatting to an old
farmer, and commented on the enor-
mous amount of work done by the
pioneers of the district. “Yes,” he said,
“we worked hard, and it was all done
on mutton-birds and spuds.”
“I believe you were attackit by two footpads.”
"Aye, and I’d hae been battered sorely if I hadna’ thocht o’ the twa shillin'
in ma breeches pocket.”
“M.L.C.”: A curious example of
vocal variation among birds of the same
species is found in the “olive whistler”
(Pachycephala olivacea). This bird, so
called on account of the olive-brown hue
of its back, has a streaked, whitish throat
and reddish-brown underparts. On the
mainland it is a shy bird, found sparsely
amongst dense timber, and it has been
located as far north as the jungles of
southern Queensland, where it is more
romantically named the “mystery bird.”
In Vic. and Queensland, though
rarely heard, it is renowned for its re-
markably clear and musical whistle,
which has been rendered as “Peeeep-
poooooo” ; in Tasmania, where it is
common, it repeats a monotonous chant:
“Wet you, we'll wet you.” No miner
or timber man on the western ranges
fails to recognise its threat, and in that
district it is commonly dubbed the rain-
bird. I know of no other instance where
birds identical in every other respect have
varied their song with their locality.
* * * *
“Taipo”: When Henare draws the
long bow he makes an artistic job of it.
Witness the legend of the taniwha. Tan.
was a huge saurian who used to gobble
up travellers between Taupo and Roto-
rua. A small army set out from Rotorua
to cope with him. Nearing the Waikato
River they saw a huge lizard-like mon-
ster issue from a cave near the river
bank and advance at tremendous speed.
The party fled, but two of their number
were caught and eaten. A week later
a larger army set out. Two miles from
the entrance to the cave they set to work
to lay snares made from long fibre ropes,
and constructed a huge net that was
placed beyond the snares. Six fleet run-
ners volunteered to entice the taniwha
into the trap. With roars of fury the
monster issued from his retreat and
rushed out on the decoys, who fled
towards the snares. Tan. dashed into
them, became hopelessly entangled, and
was slain after six hours of furious fight-
ing. The animal was the size of three
whales, with a rigid spiny crest and sharp
retractable claws. The Rotorua tribes fed
on him for six months, and found him
so succulent that they consumed even
the bones.

“Truthful James”: At Bargoo Downs
(N.Q.) 20 years ago the wife of a new
manager brought with her from the city
a small lapdog, a Peke named Diddums.
His fur was long and silky, and he sported
a pink ribbon. But Diddums was no
ordinary Peke. When he had been on the
station a week he began gingerly to mix
with the other dogs, who treated him as
a joke. One day he joined them in a
kangaroo hunt. After the pack had
travelled a mile Diddums was three-
quarters of a mile in the rear. The little
dog seemed to realise his physical limi-
tations, particularly the handicap of hav-
ing to run in an overcoat. When the shear-
ing season came he haunted the sheds.
At last a joker grabbed him and gave him
the once-over with the shears. Diddums
stepped out of that shearing-shed look-
ing like a skinned rabbit, but yelping
joyfully. Then the little dog went into
training. Every night you could see
him sprinting up and down the home
paddock until he could do ten miles
across country with the rest of the pack.
The day he pulled down his first hare
was a proud and happy one for Did-
dums. In the fulness of time he was
admitted as a full and financial member
of the pack, and even battle-scarred
cattle-dog veterans forbore to sneer.
Diddums would have no truck with his
mistress; bit her when she attempted to
fondle him, and refused to answer to
his name. The hands rechristened him
Tiger. One day Tiger, late Diddums,
disappeared. He was given up for
lost. Three months later word came
through from the mission station at
Cape York that Tiger had arrived
—sore, stiff, wounded, but safe. It
seems he was scouting round the outer
paddocks doing a bit of snake-killing
when he ran into a big dog-fox. Tiger
waded into the big fellow like a de-
stroyer attacking a battleship, and, after
being sent to the mat several times, got
a grip on the fox’s throat. The fox lit

out across country, with Tiger hanging
on. Clean across Cape York Peninsula
Tiger rode his prey. The mission
people found an unconscious and
emaciated Pekinese lying with his teeth
fixed firmly in the throat of a huge but
very dead dog-fox. Tiger was nursed
slowly back to health, and what a home-
coming he had! He died peace-
fully of old age, surrounded by a
large and mourning family of tough-
fighting hounds. A huge monument
marks his resting-place. It is surmounted
by an enormous fox-brush, as anyone
can see who visits Bargoo Downs.

“H.C.8.”: I wonder how many
Manlyites remember Percy the pelican.
Nearly 50 years ago, when the Sly
brothers, whose descendants still pluck
a living from the briny, used to cast
their nets regularly in the bay near the
men’s baths, Percy lived at the Pier
Hotel, and was always present when the
day’s haul was being beached. He would
stand patiently by the fishermen, gazing
dreamily at the far horizon, until they
turned their backs on him for a moment;
then he would swiftly gobble a few
choice fish, resuming his air of philo-
sophic abstraction before he could be
caught. Soon he would stroll nonchal-
antly along the beach, dig a hole
in the sand and disgorge the swag, then
wander back to repeat the performance.
When the haul had been sorted out
and the marketable stuff separated from
the duds Percy would be presented with
a good bucketful of fish that hadn’t
passed the. censor; and while he was
gloating over his collection of dogfish,
leatherjackets, and yellowtails the fisher-
men would walk quietly over to his
cache, dig it up, wash it, put it in their
basket and go off. If Percy knew this,
he never let on, but he became more and
more thoughtful as time went on.

“Nitre-Trader”: The time and place
to study sea-birds is on a windjammer
when one of those steady five-or-six-
week gales that rage off Cape Horn
keeps your ship hove-to on one tack.
The sky, day and night, is quite
clear, and your ship labors along
under a goose-winged tops’l until bar-
nacles grow on the lee rail. Most of the
big birds heave-to as well. The alba-
trosses not only swim but sleep afloat,
head under wing and (generally) head
to wind ; though I have seen them cap-
sized on the crest of a sea when the
gale has caught them the wrong way,
against the lie of their feathers. They
recover after a somersault or two.
Under the most favorable conditions
albatrosses seldom rise more than 15
feet above the water. Their normal
method of progress is to glide and
swing from one side to the other
by touching the water lightly with the
tips of their wings, on which they seem
to pivot. Mother Carey’s chickens,
though such frail-looking little creatures,
will face any sort of a storm. When
every other kind of bird has given it up
the Carey sticks it out. He has a flutter-
ing flight, not unlike a hovering butter-
fly ; but never settles or floats on the
water. His dance over the waves is cease-
less. He never rests, and, as far as 1 have
been able to discover, never feeds. When
other birds are down having a feast the
Careys seem uninterested. For that
reason they can never be caught. I
have caught albatrosses, Cape hens and
Cape pigeons on a sail-hook and line.
Occasionally such a gale as I have de-
scribed takes the ship far south, to
the realm of the King albatross, a mag-
nificent creature, much larger than the
Cape albatross, and entirely different in
color. Of all the sea birds I have seen
he is the handsomest and most truly
regal. Always he flies alone. I tried
hard to catch one, but without success.

“Plankton”: Certain small species of
moths descend below water to deposit
their eggs. Hydreuretis tullialis has this
peculiar habit. The life of the young
caterpillar is purely aquatic, and its body
is provided with a number of thread-
like gills placed on the abdomen. A
large cylindrical case made of pieces of
reed-stem, held together by silken threads,
serves as a protection until the en-
suing chrysalis stage of the larva is com-
pleted, when it emerges as a winged
insect.

“Homfrey Beale”: Australia’s arbor-
eous snakes haven’t received much atten-
tion from naturalists. The habitat of the
majority is among the dense northern
scrubs; and, if the tales of abos.
are to be believed, there are some un-
usual tree-dwelling ophidians in the ex-
treme top clumps. One I have heard of
is credited with three poisonous horns
on its cranium, with which, having over-
taken its prey, it butts it billygoat
fashion. Another is said to eject
saliva which, if it touches the eyes,
causes blindness. Still another is alleged
to have strong canine teeth. It coils
round its victim, bites him to death and
then howls over the corpse. Also Cape
York abos. tell of a blue-eyed, cerise-
bodied reptile no thicker than a little
finger but many yards long that festoons
itself across lower branches. When a
small wallaby or pig passes, this snake
flops upon it, and with lightning celerity
(operating from both ends simultane-
ously) strangles the quarry : then it un-
winds and leisurely sucks deceased’s
blood. Blackfellows call it “eltinaha,”
which means a particularly bad sort of
devil.

“Cebib”: No other N. S. Wales event
attracts as many abos. as the football
knockout competition held annually at

tourney was the cause of the town’s abo.
population of 50 swelling to 450. A fort-
night before the event they started to put
in an appearance, some having come 200
miles. Shanks’s pony seemed to be the
popular means of transport, but I saw
a rattletrap motor-cycle, two sulkies and
three dilapidated cars carrying Jacky
and as many of his brethren as could
find a perch. The local abos. do not
regard the reunion with favor, for the
visitors clean up all the oysters and
cockles in the river.
“IT’S RAINING IN THE WEST.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s rippling down the rainpipes.
It’s trickling through the eaves,
It’s measuring out a rigadoon
Pit-pattering on the leaves;
It's twinkling on the fence wires
In suits of silver dressed,
When, from a wrack of riven cloud.
“It’s raining in the west!’’
It’s roaring down the channels,
It’s drumming on the roofs;
It’s pounding on the claypans
Like a march of hastening hoofs,
Till the roads are strips of silver,
And the footpads threads of steel.
While etched against a leaden sky
The homing horsemen wheel.
But the grass will soon be springing now,
The herbage come, like moss,
To cover all the little heaps
Of bones that spell our loss.
The ewes will soon be lambing,
With their winter banquet spread,
And prices rising, so we’ll hope,
On every woolly head.
The earth was parched and thirsty,
Its breast was cracked and dry
From weary months of blistering heat
Beneath a cloudless sky.
But we wouldn’t change our pastures
For the Islands of the Blest
When, from a wrack of riven cloud,
“It’s raining in the west!”

Among the Scientists.
BY M. G. SKIPPER.
“Civilisation is in a transition stage from a lower to a higher sphere, and the
scientific spirit has an increasingly great pari to play in human progress. —Pro-
fessor Kerr Grant, at the congress of physicists and astronomers at Melbourne
University.
ENTLEMEN,” said the chairman,
( j “I have an important, nay, a
world-shaking announcement to
make. Dr. Passey, the eminent young
physicist, who has lately returned to us
from Europe, has made a discovery in
connection with the atom which he
desires, in bare outline, to communicate
to this congress to-night.”
An interested murmur arose from the
assemblage, composed of the foremost
scientific minds of the land.
"I have an important announcement
to make.”
Dr. Passey, a pale, thin young man
in evening dress, with a black mous-
tache and an expressionless face, rose to
his feet. He had a nervous and self-
effacing manner, but was obviously
laboring under the stress of intense ex-
citement, which revealed itself in the
trembling of the paper he held in his
hand. He reached for the water-bottle
and took a long draught.
“Mr. Chairman and fellow-scientists,”
he said at length in a clear, rasping
voice, “I will not waste your time. In
a word, I have succeeded in isolating
8WH46.”
There was one person in his audience
for whom Dr. Passey’s words had no
significance. He was a young poet and
he looked around him in astonishment.
The scientists had all sprung to their
feet. Some were shaking their neighbors
by the hand. An old man with a bald
head and a long white beard.was blowing
his nose into his handkerchief, while the
tears went streaming down his face.
Others had pressed to the platform and
were shaking the physicist by the hand
or thumping him on the back. The cold
bare lecture, hall, like a schoolroom, with
a long blackboard running the length of
one wall and its semicircle of seats, was
full of a babble of excited voices 'and
the stamping of feet.
When order had been restored the thin
young physicist went on.
“There is no need,” he said, “to stress
to most of you the importance of this
discovery, the credit for which, I insist,
lies, not with me, but with the hun-
“I have succeeded in' isolating BWH
46.”
dreds of self-sacrificing workers whose
researches have made this, simple final
step possible. But for those few amongst
you who may not have had the oppor-
tunity of keeping in touch with the latest
developments in my special branch of
research, I will be more explicit.”
He turned to the blackboard and
started to cover it with circles, placing
dots inside the circles, while he spoke of
ions, protons, neutrons and electrons,
alpha particles, radio-active elements and
potentials of 40,000,000 volts.
“The result of my discovery, there is
scarcely any need for me to tell you,” he
proceeded when his exposition was
finished, “is that science can now place
at the service of Man powers so immense
that they stagger the imagination. Agri-
culture will be benefited by the speeding-
up of plant growth; factories, with a
minimum of labor, will be able to in-
crease their production to an enormous
degree; aeroplanes will travel so fast and
far that their present miserable perform-
ances will be likened to those of the old
stage coach ; the world, in terms of rela-
tivity, will dwindle to a hundredth of its
present size ; nations now remote from
each other will become suburban neigh-
bors ; distance will no longer be a
barrier to the exchange of culture and
ideas ; an age of unbelievable ease and
luxury will dawn. In short, we have
placed the millennium at Hast in civili-
sation’s grasp.”
Pleased with his own eloquence, which
surprised even himself, he paused for
applause.
Suddenly the poet sprang to his feet.
“Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, may I say
a few words?” he cried in a voice charged
with emotion. “Gentlemen, for Heaveffs
sake, consider what you are doing! I
beg you, I implore you, keep this dread-
ful secret to yourselves! ”
A roar of laughter went up from the
outraged scientists. “Throw him out,”
shouted a young graduate in chemistry.
“He must be mad,” shouted a first-yea;
student of astronomy. “Poets, lunatics
and infants are psychologically akin,”
laughed the eminent Professor Gagah ;
“let us humor the child.” “Tell that to
Rutherford,” cried a fourth.
“Order, order, gentlemen!” snapped
the chairman. “Let us preserve our re-
putation for scientific tolerance ; let us
“Fellow-scientists."
be hospitable. I suggest that the young
man be heard.”
“Gentlemen,” proceeded the poet,
while he repeatedly thrust his hands
through his long hair, “I am a poet—in
other words, a being to whom God has
given some slight capacity to stand out-
side prejudice and see Man as he is.
Man, gentlemen, is not what you pre-
tend he is. He is a creature of the pas-
sions and emotions, as well as the pos-
sessor of a highly inadequate intellect.
He reasons, it is true, but how pitifully!
“Look at the world to-day. Man
thinks, but with what result? His think-
ing drives him mad. He has the instincts
and intuitions of an animal, but how per-
verted they can become we see when we
contemplate his laws, his politics and his
behavior when under the influence of
rage, hate and fear. Man, gentlemen,
is an ape with acquired characteristics,
that is all. Is this the creature to whom
you are going to hand your 40 million
volts?”
There was a profound silence in the
room.
“Or are you going to place your secret
in the hands of this ape’s Governments?
Or of his kings or of his dictators —his
Hitlers? Or will you, perhaps, keep your
secret in your own hands and be world
dictators in your turn?
“A dictatorship of, scientists!”,- The
poet’s lips curled in sorrowful scorn. “I
do not wish to be .rude, but do you in
your heart of hearts feel fit for such a
frightful responsibility? Do you really
consider that the knowledge you have
acquired so painstakingly, and with a
courage that has . often unflinchingly
faced martyrdom, has, given you the wis-
dom for such a charge? What do you
know of reality outside your own par-
ticular field? Do you know a beautiful
building or a great picture when you
see it? Do you know a bad poem from
a good? Has your hitherto unofficial
dictatorship promoted the well-being of
men?
“I look around me and I see an
age in which it is almost impossible for
beauty any longer to exist; and it is
called the scientific age! Why are men’s
hands and eyes incapable of beauty now-
adays? Because the great gifts of science
to men are speed and power over
material things. A workman in a factory
can make a piece of furniture in a day
which would have taken his grandfather
a year. A builder can erect a cathedral
in concrete in a few weeks. Some day
you will try to discover the laws govern-
ing the making of a poem and speed up
the production of poetry.
“Since any reference to the present
times may stir latent prejudices in your
breasts,” he went on, “1 will tell you. in
the form of a historical anecdote, what
science has done for men.
“There was once a young Maori named
Te Rauparaha. He was the son of a
chief of a tribe near Auckland. His
father was an expert in all the science,
mainly of warfare, of his time. His war-
riors could wield their greenstone meres
with telling effect. But in the neighbor-
“A roar of laughter went up.”
hpod dwelt another tribe, whose name
has slipped my mind. It was in touch
with the whalers and traders who came
from overseas, and from them-’ it was
able to purchase guns in exchange for
flax and slaves. Te Rauparaha’s tribe
was threatened with extinction.
“This statesman and warrior, conceived
a brilliant plan. He induced his people
to abandon their ancestral home and led
them on a marvellous march from one
end of the North Island to the other. He
established himself on the island of
Kapiti, where whalers called and where
he also was able to purchase guns. When
his people had acquired sufficient scienti-
fic aptitude he led them on a career of
conquest.
“He ate his way down to Welling-
ton and across to the South Island, which
he succeeded in nearly depopulating. He
carried his commissariat on the hoof, so
to speak, for he fed his men on the cap-
tured enemy. And he was a psychologist,
for he always killed them out of sight
of other prisoners, so that the spectacle
would not make the survivors thin.
“Meanwhile the other tribes had be-
come scientific, too. There is very
“Throw him out!”
little doubt that- the' Maori race would
have exterminated itself if the white man
had not arrived .in sufficient numbers to
establish a new moral law.
“Are the tribes, called nations, which
maintain an uneasy division of the world
in any different situation from the Maoris
of Te Rauparaha’s day? The survival
of the fittest—is that not a scientific
dogma? And are not the fittest those
with the most destructive weapons in
their hands?
“Gentlemen,” the poet concluded in a
now-exhausted voice, “whom the gods
seek to destroy they first make mad.
That man is mad who, having great riches
“I am a poet."
which he does not know how to employ,
seeks to acquire more. Is this not the
position of this science of yours?”
“Mr. Chairman,” said a tall scientist,
standing up in the body of the hall, and
speaking in acid tones, “we have lis-
tened to this poet, as he calls himself,
this reactionary, as I see him, long
enough. Pure science has no concern
with practical applications of its dis-
coveries. Pure science is concerned
with objective truth. This long-haired
fanatic has no more right to say that the
scientist should go thus far and no farther
in his pursuit of knowledge than the
scientist has to dictate to a poet how far
he shall be allowed to penetrate his par-
ticular mystery. I move that the gentle-
man be. no longer heard.”
“Stay,” said an old man with a long
beard, a bald head and a . benevolent
twinkle in his eyes, rising to his feet.
“There is still something more that can
be said, perhaps. This poet is right and
we scientists are right, each in our par-
ticular sphere. Each is impelled to obey
“A first-year student of astronomy.”
the biological urge. He seeks to create
new beauty in the world and leave it a
better garden than he found it; so do we.
It is not mere hyperbole to say that the
discovery of a physicist such as you have
heard to-night, if placed in the hands of a
South Sea island savage, might destroy
the civilisation some of whose manifesta-
tions fill us with justifiable pride. By means
of it he might devastate the world. The
poet’s labors make him a more developed
human being, but the truths he discovers
may be the destruction of lesser men.
“We scientists have a duty towards our
fellow-men as well as to ourselves. We
cannot, nor should we, obstruct the
march of truth, but we should realise
that the world is full of human beings,
as well as discoverable facts. Some of
us would like to think that science exists
in a vacuum and the titanic social forces
at work around us are not our concern.
It is pleasant, perhaps, to be a professor
in a well-salaried post in a respectable seat
of learning such as this. But Nature ab-
hors a vacuum and is indifferent to the
special interests of universities. If, with
our claims to objectivity, we ignore these
things we will deserve to be destroyed by
our own inventions, along with the society
to whose imperfections we are so con-
veniently blind. But if we accept our re-
sponsibilities, both as scientists and men.
we at least will have nothing to reproach
ourselves with, whatever may occur. For
then we will be artists, too.”
“Let’s go out and have some supper,
said the first-year student of astronomy
to the graduate in chemistry. “This is
getting too deep for me.”

“It seemed to his Honor that where a civilian

Joyously, Rover
followed. The man, he noticed, had
dashed through, a gate with a “Beware
of the Dog” sign on it. Although this,
by itself, might not stand in law as law-
ful excuse (Hardbitten v. Dogstooth),
the lethal weapon and the circumstances
of entry gave ground for reasonable
pleas in any subsequent action.
Later, as Rover disengaged his teeth
from the remnants of the seat of the
stranger’s pants, he reflected smugly on
what an asset he was to his owner.

Another example. I married a girl

She was wearing a pink dress at the
time.
Now she has me served with blue
papers. She is'still in the pink, but I’m
not. In fact, my prospects are dark,
and I ought to have my head read for
having married her.

At last we have a trump card for those
who cast aspersions on our Darlinghurst
residential. The prudish Miss Wullum,
who recently took a room, and whose
say-so on matters of morality is final,
has admitted that she has not seen the
slightest sign of impropriety.
She has never heard anyone tap on the
side window, nor seen anything to make
her suspect that the couple upstairs are
not married, that the grass widower
downstairs is having an affair with the
landlady, or that the blonde in the back
flat is visited by sailors.
Miss Wullum is a trained nurse. She
is away on cases all night.
T,
AGE OF SUPPRESSION.
“My son,” said the right-thinking
father gravely, “you have now reached
the age of suppression. You must join
a society for sup-
pressing s o m e-
thing.”
“Dad,” answered
the son, “I’ve been
a member of your
political party for
two years. We’re
out to suppress
any member who
disagrees with the
heads”
“Yes, yes, son,
but these are mere
general suppres-
sions performed in
the sacred cause of
Democracy. It is
the further duty of
each and every one
of us to go in for
some special sup-
pression. There
are at least a thou-
sand suppression
societies to choose
from. You can
make it your life’s
work to suppress
beer, Sunday sport,
flirting, inadequate bathing costumes,
races, smoking, Alsatian dogs, tin hares,
street bands”
“Hold on! I’ve got an idea. Sup-
pose I organise a Society for the Sup-
pression of Suppression.”
The poor old father suppressed a
groan as his iconoclastic otfspring, after
suppressing a couple of whiskies, strolled
nonchalantly off to suppress his few re-
maining repressions at a night club
which is in a chronic state of suppressed
excitement over the idea that it will soon
be suppressed by the police.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Blixten’s performance in the Rosehill
Guineas was a vast improvement on his
dismal failure in the Chelmsford Stakes.
No doubt McCarten made a difference.
When stable-mate Shakuni (11 to 2) took
charge with a furlong to go, it looked
all over. However, Blixten (5 to 2) re-
sponded gamely under the whip, and,
flying in the final 50 yards, he got up to
win by half a neck, with Limarch (6 tol),
who was squeezed back when Blixten ran
in under punishment, 2+ lengths away.
With a more alert jockey Shakuni might
have reversed positions; it certainly
seemed as if he could have come away
sooner, and then Blixten—last early—
might not have caught him.
Blixten’s win makes the Derby more
interesting than ever. The Victorian
colts Hall Mark and Break Up have
done well since arriving from the south,
and, while not quite as stylish-looking
as Blixten, they will be able to take up
a handy position from barrier-rise. Blix-
ten has won his races from behind. No
doubt he will have to give the Victorians
a good start over the last half-mile. And
Hall Mark is not only brilliant; he
gives the impression of stamina.
It looks as if Chatham will start one
of the hottest fancies on record for the
Epsom. In the Hill Stakes he donkey-
licked his six opponents, though

burdened with 9st. 101 b., and ran the
mile in lmin. 38fsec., only half a second
outside the track record held by Vali-
care. Had he been set a severe task he
would have beaten Valicare’s time. Jim
Pike allowed him to lob along at his
leisure from the Leger, to win by nearly
three lengths from Kuvera, who beat
Lough Neagh by half a length, with
Rogilla a close fourth. Chatham went
out at 5 to 4 (he paid evens on the one-
two tote); Silver Scorn (7 to 4) shaped
badly.
Chatham won the Epsom last year
with Bst. 131 b., defeating Rogilla and
Winooka in lmin. 37sec. Owner A. E.
Blair and trainer Fred Williams are hop-
ing for a fine Epsom day, and are confi-
dent that the son of Windbag will not
be troubled with his 9st. 101 b. The
Epsom has been a good race for horses
carrying 9st. and over; since 1918 they
have scored on six occasions.
Raced by H. E. Edmunds, who is a
pastoralist at Palmerston North (M.L.),
the Paper Money horse Inflation drew
attention to his prospects in the Epsom,
in which he has Bst. Carrying four
pounds more he beat a good field in the
Camellia Stakes, after having been
backed from eights to fours —then sixes
were called. Inflation did his job in
good style. He won comfortably by
two lengths from Turbine (5 to 1), with
Whittingham (8 to 1), who can be im-
proved, half a length away. Touchit
did best of the others, but Jacko (5 to
2) and Bronze Hawk (7 to 1) were dis-
appointments. Inflation is trained in
M.L. by Mrs. A. W. McDonald, whose
husband brought over the horse —he rode
Hunt the Slipper into second place in
the Brush Hurdle. Inflation is under
the care of A. D. Webster at Moorefield.
In winning the Rosehill Spring Handi-
cap, Oro (7 to 1) beat the previous track
record for 11 furlongs, 2min. 18sec., by
half a second. His performance gives
him a really good chance in the Metrop.
with Bst., but he likes to have things all
his own way. He won his race in slash-
ing style, and was not in danger of de-
feat when he ran past the pacemaker,
Balgay, at the half-mile. Oro is by
Rogilla’s sire, Roger de Busli, and was
bred by his owner, Hunter White. He
ran second to Peter Pan (who has gone
wrong, and has been scratched for all
spring engagements) in the A.J.C. Derby
and Leger.
Magnitas and Maltdale followed Oro,
but the last-named beat them so easily
that they do not look like turning the
tables on the chestnut in the Metrop.
Regal Son and Balgay both disappointed,
the latter showing no fight when tackled
by Oro.
Both divisions of the Highweight were
good betting mediums. The first heat
went to the Queenslander Polly Speck,
who started at 16 to 1 after 20 to 1 had
been laid. He was piloted by Tanwan
and ran the seven furlongs in the smart
time of lmin. 25sec. —fsec. faster than
Inflation’s time. Since coming from the
north, Polly Speck has been in and out,
but now that he has struck form he
should be heard of again. He won very
easily from Prowler and Tingalba.
Pantilla, trained at Canterbury, regis-
tered a good performance to win the
second division. The Pantheon mare,
who started at fives, gave McCarten his
second win. She was knocked back in
the straight, but finished fast on the
outside, to beat the favorite, Astute, who
is raced by Minister J. M. Dunningham.

Moonee Valley, which has changed

last fence,

Main feature of the Valley sport was
die success of Middle Watch in the Cor-
r?boree Handicap of seven furlongs and
? lxt Y yards After his disappointing run
in the Melbourne Cup, Middle Watch
developed tendon trouble, and J. S.
Feehan sold him to Tindall for 200gns.
Tindall has the black stallion apparently
quite sound again. His victory on Satur-
day was impressive. Middle Watch may
have to be reckoned with in the Cups ;
he has 9st. in each.

Odds of 50 to 1 went begging about
H. R. Telford’s filly La Vante, who
squeezed home by half a head from Gay
Star (33 to 1) in the three-year-old event,
with Beautiful Girl a head farther off.
La Vante is a sister to Rondalina, pace-
maker to Phar Lap in weight-for-age
races. The jubilation of apprentice Pres-
ton over riding his second winner for
the year was extinguished when the
stewards suspended him for a month
for having crossed the field too sharply.
The “S. A. Rawdon” stable, presided
over by Adam Skirving, registered a
surprise success in the Jubilee Handicap.
Starting at 25 to 1, Ruach squeezed home
by a head from the South Aus. mare
Gay Girl. The favorite, Segati, was If
lengths behind Gay Girl, after having
had every chance. Ruach is by im-
ported Drake.
Bob Lewis, who will be 55 on Novem-
ber 30, gave younger jockeys a demon-
stration of vigor in a finish by annexing
the first division of the Nulla Nulla
Welter on his brother’s horse Nappatara,
a four-year-old stallion by Trivalve, on
whom Lewis won the Melbourne Cup of
1927. The second division of the Welter
fell to Hollander (14 to 1), owned and
trained by Frank Godby. It was a
harvest afternoon for McShortodds, most
of the winners being at forlorn odds.

Winooka easily won his six-furlong
against the American horse On-
rush at Seattle. The dirt track was
boggy with rain, but the visitor, starting
a red-hot favorite, got home by five
lengths in lmin. Msec. He did the dis-
tance in lmin. lOfsec. at Flemington last
March. The American press speaks of
Onrush as a “selling plater.”

“Thormanby”: The Doncaster St.
Leger went to Lord Derby’s Hyperion,
who won the Epsom blue riband in June.
In spite of rumors of soreness, Hyperion
started at 6 to 4. Felicitation and
Scarlet Tiger were in second and third
places. This is Lord Derby’s fifth Leger.
“Hotham”: The annual report of the
V.A.T.C. shows a profit of £6453, a
jump of nearly £l5OO on that of 1931-
32. During the year £48,576 was paid
in prize-money, and attendances have
warranted some increases. Caulfield Cup
added money is to be raised to £6500
for the centenary meeting next year.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Melbourne boxing followers were
flabbergasted on Saturday when ex-cham-
pion pug Bill Lang crowned Llew
Edwards, of Australia, winner over Eng-
lishman Tarleton at the end of 15 rounds.
The visitor gave Edwards a rare pasting,
and finished unmarked, while Edwards
was bleeding. There was a demonstra-
tion, but Tarleton, after protesting,
accepted the situation. Edwards weighed
9st. 41b. and Tarleton 9st. 61b.

“Solidarity”: Though sport has been
recognised as a profession for years, a
step forward was made in Sydney the
other day when a body styling itself the
Professional Boxers, Wrestlers and
Trainers’ Association applied in cold
blood to the Industrial Registrar for
registration "as an industrial union. The
applicants will have to prove that box-
ing and wrestling are industries, but
there should be no trouble about that.
An industrial award will be the next
step, followed by a representative of the
union in Parliament, and we may yet
see a Minister for Mitt Shoving and Mat
Mauling.

Penchiff, the Bulgarian, and Lundyn,
the Finn, acted more like acrobats than
wrestlers at Leichhardt on Saturday.
Ten-minute rounds were discarded for
once, and after 27 minutes Penchiff was
pinned by a headlock. Another 15
minutes and Lundyn was downed by a
short-arm scissors hold. Falls were still
one each when the remaining 18 minutes
expired. Lundyn finished the stronger,
but Penchiff was declared the winner.

In spite of the rain on Saturday
morning, 49,303 enthusiasts got them-
selves into queues to watch the second
semi-final between South Melbourne and
Richmond, the gate-money amounting
to £2433 17s. 7d. Finding its feet early,
Richmond, equal in speed and superior
in marking, got a fair grip of the game
by half-time, with a six-goal lead. But
on resuming the Southerners soon
showed it was to be no walk-over.
Scouting better, and putting on extra
pace, they slowly crept within striking
distance. The Tigers’ defenders were
great, especially O’Neill, Murdoch and
Bolger, but their forwards missed some
easy chances. Still four goals to the
bad, South Melbourne began the last
quarter full of vim, swept the Tigers
aside, overmarked them and outpointed
them, and, adding another eight goals to
one, ran out winners with 95 points to
Richmond’s 77. Besides those named,
Zschech, Baggott and Hunter did most
for the Tigers, while Pratt, Reville, Dig-
gins and Clarke shone for South. The
Southerners will now rest for a week
while Richmond and Geelong decide
who is to meet them for the pennant.

“Hotham”: This year’s Brownlow
medal, which is presented annually for
the best and fairest player in the Vic-
torian Football League, has been won by
the Fitzroy winger W. Smallhorn, who
got 18 votes, with W. Lowenthal, of
Essendon, on 17. Bunton, of Fitzroy,
who won the trophy in 1931-32, was
seventh this time.

The Rugby Union premiership of N.
S, Wales went to Northern Suburbs. Its
men defeated Manly, the titleholder, at
Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday by
8-6, or a converted try and a penalty goal
to two tries. It was an extremely hard
but clean battle between two heavy for-
ward teams, with Manly a bit the better
in the backs. Half-time scores were 3-3,
and then a good bit of work by scrum-
half Gibbons gave Northern a try, which
Leach converted finely. From then to
time Manly lived in Northern’s 25,
launching attack after attack which just
fell short of success. The crowd of 15,000
was a club record since the war. This
is Northern Suburbs’ first premiership
since the district system began in 1900.
In Brisbane Y.M.C.A. retained the
premiership by drawing with University.
The Victorian title passed for the first
time to Navy, which defeated Footscray.

In the North of England the Rugby
League Kangaroos had two good wins
last week, beating a combined team from
the Yorkshire clubs 13-0 and then down-

a try. Their first Test match is on
October 7.

The 22nd Goulburn-Sydney road race
for the pushbikers was run on Saturday
by amateur and professional divisions,
a head wind most of the way hampering
the riders. The winner in the profes-
sional section was G. Humphreys, of
Lisarow (N.S.W.), with a start of 57min.
His riding time was 6hr. 6min. 35sec.
Fastest time was done by the Victorian
crack Frank Thomas, who clocked shr.
41min. 55sec. off scratch for the 130-mile
run. W. A. Mackenzie, of Rockdale
(N.S.W.), who had 49min. start, won the
amateur event in 6hr. 28min. lsec. Mil-
liken, of Victoria, took fastest time with
shr. 53min. 42sec. from scratch.

“Crank”: With no Australian riders
competing, little was heard in this coun-
try of the 1933 Tour de France race. It
attracted 80 of Europe’s best riders and
was won by Georges Speicher, an Alsa-

a Frenchman. He won the 2700-mile
run, which was taken in 23 stages, by
only 4min. Bsec.

“Fitzcray”: The Victorian cricket
authorities are trying their hand at
fiddling with the laws of cricket. They
have recommended to the Board of Con-
trol that the l.b.w. law be amended to
allow a batsman to be given out for a
ball pitched outside the off-stump and
breaking into the wicket, if the ump. con-
siders the batsman prevented it hitting
the sticks with his pad. No mention is
made of a ball breaking from the leg,
which is, perhaps explained by the fact
that the proposer, A. E. Liddicut, was a
right-hand break-bowler himself. The
new law would only add to the burdens
of umpires, and, like the foolish body-
line rule of the Board of Control, will
certainly die a natural death from inani-
tion.

“Henson”: The penalties of greatness
were vividly illustrated in Sydney last
week when Don Bradman and Stan
McCabe took part in a cricket match in
Marrickville. The residents of the
Sydney suburb and its environs are not
advocates of birth control, and the pro-
moters of the game had overlooked the
fact that the school holidays were on.
Some 5000 boys and girls lined the
ground, and when the heroes appeared
went for them in one wild rush. Both
were in danger of smothering in the
demonstration, and the police who
rushed to their assistance had to be re-
inforced. There was eventually some
pretence of cricket, but no one paid much
attention to that part of it.

“Tenth Slip”: Though football lingers
on, cricket has made a start. The
Queensland season has opened officially,
and N.S.W. begins on September 20.
N.S.W. has had a metropolitan side tour-
ing the country districts, and in the city
itself exhibition matches with many of
the first-rankers taking part have been
played. The season may see one inno-
vation —a match between the Sheffield
.Shield winners and the Rest as a wind-
up. As a final trial for aspirants to the
next Eleven for England, such a game
would be invaluable. Harold Heydon,
secretary of the N.S.W.C.A., is the spon-
sor. He suggests that the profits be de-
voted to an Australian cricketers’ fund,
the match to be an annual event.

“Aigburth”: The cricket season just
ending in England has been close to a
record for dry wickets and heavy scor-
ing. With one more match to go Ham-
mond had scored 3278 runs and was 245
behind Tom Hayward’s record aggre-
gate of 3518, made in 1906. Sutcliffe,
Woolley, Hendren and Bobby Abel are
the only others, who have passed the 3200
mark, Abel as long ago as 1901, when he
was in the veteran stage. The surprise of
the season has been wicketkeeper Ames,
who has also topped the 3000, the first
Aunt Sally ever to do so. Yet on top
of this batting riot comes “Tich” Free-
man, of Kent, with over 300 wickets,
the sixth time he has turned the trick.
Yet he was a third-class trundler in Aus-
tralia.

“Cash Amateur”: The Australian
Rules umpires in Sydney have again
embarrassed their employers by going
on strike for higher pay. When they
did this previously the N. S. Wales
League was unable to find substi-
tutes and had to knuckle under. First-
grade umpires get 15s. for trotting about
a ground for a little over an hour, and
that seems enough. Rugby Union um-
pires, officiating in international and
inter-State matches, to say nothing of
grade games, get nothing at all, consider-
ing it an honor to hold the whistle —
but, then, they are benighted amateurs.

“Stand Off”: The Wallabies, now on
their way back to Australia, have had
a mixed experience on tour. They struck
the worst of bad luck with the early
loss for most of the programme of Ross
and Malcolm, both key-position men.
Still, one feels that they should have
done better in the minor fixtures, such
as the Kimberley and Free State games,
though, on the other hand, the quality of
teams like the Transvaal and Western
Province is not far behind Test form.
As it was they won 12 of their 23 games,
lost 10 and drew one, scoring 311 points
against 196. Their Test showing was
a good one. Only the 1928 All Blacks
have equalled them in defeating the
’Boks twice in a series, while no Brit-
ish side for years has won a game from
South Africa. In points they scored 42
to 50 in the five Tests, while the All
Blacks’ figures were 26-39. Poor goal-
kicking and back-disorganisation seem
to have been the factors working against
them.

“Gate”: The importance which
organised professional sport has achic.-d
among a section of the English public is
seen in efforts to popularise the un-
known Rugby League game in London,
where the money is very good. The

Highfield, a Lancashire League club,
“lock, stock and barrel,” as the press
announcement puts it, for £lOOO from
its owners. The purchased mob has
been transferred to London and will

play matches there with similar clubs
by night. Even more interesting is the
sale to the London body by the York-
shire League club, Batley, of its fixture
with the Australians on November 22,
which will now be played at the White
City, the Australians being, apparently,
helpless in the matter.
The Nineteenth Hole
The 34th amateur golf championship
of Australia was won by W. L. Hope,
a Scot who has only been in Australia
about 12 months. He won 6 and 4 from
the Victorian A. W. Jackson, who cap-
tured the Australian foursomes with
C. H. Fawcett. Like most Scots Hope
was playing the game in babyhood, be-
ginning 26 years ago, when only eight.
He figured several times for Scotland
against England, and has represented
Britain against America in the Walker
Cup tourney three times. The profes-
sional title went to V. S. Richardson, of
N.S.W., who defeated Victorian A.
Spence 9 and 7.

at 41 has robbed N.S.W. of one of its

He made a name for himself as an ad-
ministrator of the game also, having
been one of the founders of the N.S.W.
Golf Council and a member of the com-
mittee in charge of the State champion-
ships, while for years he was president
of the City and Suburban Golf Associa-

“Sandringham”: A feature of the
women’s championships was the con-
duct of a small boy, who followed the
play in one match with a card and a
pencil as long as himself. He was too
short in the leg to get a front seat at every
green, but that didn’t block him. Cast-
ing himself on his breakfast in the
rain-soaked grass, he squinted at the
play through the legs of the throng and
recorded the strokes faithfully. When
the match was over he departed and was
seen no more. Popular conjecture was
that he was a devoted but hopeless ad-
mirer of the defeated player, but no
evidence to that effect has been brought
forward.
* * * *
“Arltunga”: The terrible drought con-
ditions in England have played the
dickens with golfers. During a big
tournament at Pinner Hill, which is evi-
dently situated somewhere in the Great
English Desert, the fairways were so
cracked that many balls disappeared
down the openings. Extra fore-caddies
marked such crevices, competitors, of
course, incurring a penalty for playing
a new ball under Rule 22, unless this was
overridden by a local rule.
Car and Cycle
“Differential”: Someone has been
complaining in the press that the popu-
larity of car contests in this country
has vanished, whereas in Britain and the
Continent they flourish as rallies and
in other guises. The truth is that these
shows, interesting enough in themselves,
are losing popularity abroad as they
have done here, and for the same reason
—the intrusion of trade competitors to
the effacement of the private driver. In
Australia what competitions of the kind
remain are mopped up with tiresome
regularity by persons connected with the
trade. Naturally the private amateur is
fighting shy of the whole business and
will remain so until the trade-backed
pro.-amateur is cut out.
* * * *
“Formula”: The Citroen car which
has been engaging the attention of motor-
ists the world over by its continuous run
at Montlhery track was finally pulled
up after running 133 consecutive days.
In that time the “Ten” had covered
186,420 miles, at an average speed of
58 m.p.h. Every long-distance record
was broken, as well as others 100 numer-
ous to mention. No important parts
called for replacement, and repairs and
adjustments were made only with the
tools and spares carried on the car. A
committee of experts is to dismember the
traveller and hold a post-mortem.
“Sump”: A motor-cycle road-spin
from Melbourne to Sydney which was
better worth while than the idiotic and
dangerous runs against time which have
been fashionable in the past was under-
taken by Messrs. Armfield and Wilson,
of Melbourne. This was a top-gear
economy trial, and the run of 570 miles
on the 250-c.c. B.S.A. machines cost only
ss. each, or 114 miles for each bob spent
on oil and petrol. The ride to Sydney
took three days, and petrol consumption
was 2f gallons.
Racquet and Baw!
“Gamester”: It was hard luck in more
ways than one that lack Crawford
should have physically collapsed in his
game against Perry in the final of the
American singles when he had two sets
up on his opponent. Perry, for one
reason or another, twice avoided meeting
Crawford in Europe, and a lot of people
not particularly interested in tennis were
disappointed that the inevitable meeting
at last should resolve itself into a walk-
over by a hale man against a sick. How-
ever, the pair will have several chances
of clashing in Australia this season, and
their meetings should transcend all
others in interest.
$ * *
“Let”: There has been a lot of anti-
cipation over the meeting in America of
Parker and McGrath. In an exhibition
match at Chicago Parker won in two
straight sets. If tennis were racing there
would be a case for the stipes here.
McGrath has beaten Vines, Allison,
Nunoi, Harada, Satoh and Gledhill,
while Parker cannot boast anything like
that record. This year Gledhill, whom
McGrath has mastered several times,
beat Parker easily in the American
singles.
* * * *
“Hardcourt”: Freak tennis players
seem to be increasing. The latest to im-
bibe the McGrath complex is one Stan-
ley Pont, a 14-year-old player in the
Illawarra (N.S.W.) district. He uses
both hands for back- and forehand shots
alike, while his service also has an exotic
flavor. He puts one ball in his pocket
and tosses the other for the service with
his left hand, bringing this down to the
grip in the same movement. Services
and court shots are extraordinarily accu-
rate, his overhead play being particularly
severe.

“The
Intestinal
Tract
is the
most prolific
source of disease”
. . . states Famous German Doctor
Professor L. SCHMEIDLER
Coloseptic—the way to
keep internally clean.
The modern foods we eat, the stress of present-
day life combine to produce self-poisoning
(autoxima), the result of hidden and unsus-
pected constipation from which nine out of ten
suffer. Particles of food waste not properly
evacuated become encrusted in the intestine,
much as a water pipe becomes coated with
rust. This waste decays, harboring disease-
breeding germs and poisons. These are
absorbed into the system, thus polluting the
blood stream, undermining your health and
bringing on all manner of aches, pains and
sicknesses.
Simple Way to Health
Modern medicine has at its disposal a prepara-
tion with extraordinary health properties ....
COLOSEPTIC. It ig a natural, simple way to
flush the poisons right out of the system. It is
unexcelled for combating chronic constipation.
HEADACHES, NERVES.
“Stanley St., Burwood, N.S.ff'.
“I must say that since I have been using Coloseptic l
have never had any return of Headaches or Nerves, and
l have enjoyed the best of life, and l will always be only
too pleased to recommend it to others.

It invigorates the intestinal muscles. ... It
stimulates the flow of gastric juices and heightens
the appetite. . . . COLOSEPTIC completely
loosens off the waste and passes it smoothly out
of the body. It rids the blood of all impurities
through Nature s other outlets—the kidneys—
the pores of the skin—and the respiratory
organs.
Drink Coloseptic
Are you suffering from constipation, headaches, weak-
ness, indigestion, gas in the stomach and bowels,
catarrh, backache, rheumatism, neuritis, eczema,
pimples? Drink COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Try it for at least seven days. It will “tone
up your sluggish intestines.... soften accumulated
wastes.... keep your body internally active and
CLEAN. And when the poisons no longer circulate
throughout your body, how much better you feel!

FARM ACCOUNTS
The articles published on “THE BULLETIN’S” Land page have been reprinted and added to.
In these lessons the farmer who did not previously know a thing about book-keeping is. carried
along, step by step, and shown how accounts are kept. Every entry is explained in the simplest
and clearest possible language.
The object is to enable the farmer to put his business on a proper basis and keep it there.
In no other calling is it more necessary to follow every branch of the business and see where
a profit is being made and where a loss.
Many a farmer has come to grief simply through not knowing that he was going back a little
further every year. Had he known in time he might have made changes that would have saved
the situation.
The trouble about most attempts to show the farmer how to keep accounts is that they assume
he knows something about bookkeeping.
The Bulletin, at the request of scores of farm readers, decided to produce a cheap textbook
in which the whole business of book-keeping would be dealt with from the very beginning.
The little book is at a price which brings it within the means of everybody. It will
be sent from any Bulletin Office for sixpence, to which must be added 2d. for postage.
Though designed primarily for the man on the land, it will be found just as valuable to traders and
others who have hitherto had only a foggy idea about accounts.
PRICE SIXPENCE


THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SOUND SIRES.
“The Breaker”: An Act which will
come into force on January 1, 1934, pro-
hibits any stallion in the central coastal
district of Queensland from being used
for stud purposes unless it has a certifi-
cate signifying soundness. Another clause
provides that any stallion rejected by
the board shall be unsexed before a
lease or transfer is granted to other
ownership.
The Government should apply the Act
to all Queensland, and make compulsory
the destruction of brumbies, which have
a deal to do with the increase in number
of nondescript horses ; but unsound sires,
as well as mongrel-bred mares, are in
a degree responsible. The new Act will
greatly improve the breed of horses.
No other animals have slipped back so
much in type and quality as Walers. With
some of the best horse-breeding country
in the world, and selected mares and sires
of soundness, the .industry should again
become what it was 20 years ago. The
Act is the first step in the right direction.
AGE MARKS.
“Sheepo”: Only a small percentage of
graziers have a practical system of age-
marking sheep ; there is a foolproof sys-
tem which a novice can learn in a few
minutes. It does away with the fire-
branding of numbers on cattle, thus
saving a portion of the hide for the
tanner.
Here is an instance of how the five-
year cycle operates in Queensland. For
years 1930 and 1935, the age ears will
be left full; 1931 and 1936, make one
front notch ; 1932 and 1937, make two
front notches; 1933 and 1938, make three
front notches ; for the remaining years
in the 1934 and 1939, make a mark
in the point of the ear. It can be used
just as effectively with cattle. Where
there are two lambings a year, the cycle
can still be used, with the variation that
the second lambing will have either a
distinctive point or back notch. Distinct
marks are essential in determining at a
glance the ages of the sheep or cattle.
SLIPSHOD CROSS-BREEDING.
“Jumbuck”: Fat-lamb breeders do not
aim at growing quality wool; an early-
maturing lamb is their objective. Many
graziers are attempting to mate decent
merino ewes with any type of crossbred
ram, and expect to get a decent return
per head for wool from the progeny.
The crossing of merino ewes with some
English breeds brings similar results. To
breed lambs for the trade select care-
fully, but do not expect high wool values
at present.
In suitable country, a Lincoln-merino
cross gives good fat-lamb results and a
medium wool return. Do not expect a
good wool return from merino ewes
crossed with Dorsets, Shropshires, South-
downs or nondescript types of Leices-
ters, Lincolns or mongrel crossbreds.
Throwbacks occur even where the
ewes are carefully culled. The cross-
breeder who cannot cull has in a year
or two a flock that would grace any
variety show, the wool being of every
spinning quality.
COUNTING SHEEP.
“Yakhai”: I endorse “Jumbuck’s”
idea that the easiest and most accurate
way to count sheep is in “threes” (B.
16/8/’33). The count should not be
made “at” the sheep ; number one should
be mentally recorded before any sheep
come through the gate. When they com-
mence to run the counting should be
continued and the sheep, in lots of three,
ticked past a certain spot, as near the
gate as possible. A learner can manage
best by doing this with his finger. The
process of counting 1,2, 3 and so on
must correspond with the pace the sheep
are running at and should be fairly fast.
A medium rate is about 250 per minute
for sheep that clear the gate well. There
is no necessity for a good man to con-
centrate on the count. A counter can
tell at once when the wrong hundred has
been called.
ARSENICAL POISONING.
“Hatter”; Deaths of stock due to
arsenical poisoning are increasing in Vic-
toria. Only a small proportion of the
cases is sent for analysis. The greater
use of arsenic is responsible for the high
mortality among all animals, from horses
to canaries.
Deaths have occurred in widely sepa-
rated districts and were traced to
various unsuspected causes. The spray-
ing of timber with arsenical compounds,
as a protection against insects, caused the
death of cattle which had licked the
bases of the telegraph poles. A farmer
who constructed a feeding-trough lrom
timber similarly treated lost cattle. Salts
of arsenic are saline, and therefore arc
palatable to animals. The residues of
sprays used for fruit-trees and for
cleansing the pastures from grass grubs
accounted for deaths on two other
properties.
On another farm a container holding
arsenic was placed above a fodder-
bin. Rainwater flowed into the arsenic
and it dripped on the fodder. Take care
in disposing of sheep dips which contain
arsenical compounds.
BETTER DAIRY CATTLE.
“Bahb Dwyer”: The hopes recently ex-
pressed on this page that beef breeders
would take advantage of the low prices
prevailing for high-class stud stock to
improve their herds apply with even
greater force to dairy cattle. High-class
stud dairy bulls can be bought cheap.
1 quote the experiment in Henry and
Morrison’s “Feeds and Feeding.” Four-
teen head of scrubbers were put on first-
class feed and management, and under
test showed an average annual production
of 38471 b. milk and 1821 b. butter-fat.
They were mated to a pure-bred Frisian
bull, and their heifer progeny, under test,
averaged 59451 b. milk and 2621 b. butter-
fat. These heifers were again mated to
a pure-bred Frisian bull; so their pro-
geny were three-quarters pure-bred.
Under test they yielded an average of
83111 b. milk and 3761 b. butter-fat—an
increase of 116 per cent, milk and 106
per cent, butter-fat over the production
of their granddams. And the cost of
producing 1001 b. milk from these second-
generation heifers was 13 per cent, lower
than from the original scrubbers.
As a check, some heifers were raised
at the same time, when the original
scrubbers were mated with a nondescript
bull and the progeny given similar feed
and care. These heifers produced only
10 per cent, more milk and 13 per cent,
more fat than their dams. The experi-
ment proved that 100 per cent, improve-
ment in production can be expected from
nondescript cows when mated with a first-
class bull. The better producers milk
better, and for many more years.
Breeding determines the quantity of
feed of which a cow can make economi-
cal use. Pasture improvement should be
concurrent with herd improvement. Burn
out and remove stumps and logs, break
up and distribute ashes and farmyard
manure, and multiply pasture grasses.
ALL USEFUL TREES.
“Booraby”: When the grass goes there
are many excellent fodder trees, apart
from shrubs,‘to keep stock in good con-
dition in a bad season, to provide shelter,
fuel, timber for fencing and building, and
to prevent erosion. These trees should
be planted by the small landholder in
need of timber and feeling the pinch.
They suit boundaries, hillsides and banks
of gullies and creeks. The casuarinas—
sheoak, silky oak, belar, forest oak and
creek or river oak —are all valuable for
foliage, timber and bark. The bark is
excellent fuel. Lop the river oak early to
keep the foliage within easy reach, unless
it is needed only for timber, fuel and pro-
tective purposes. It is used for making
bullock yokes and staves. The bark is
good for tanning. Silky oaks have an
ornamental effect.
Mulga and leopard trees are good for
dry places like rocky ridges and sandhills.
The leopard tree starts as a straggly, spiny
bush, from the centre of which the stem
shoots up. When it is high and strong the
spiny cluster at the base dies. The mulga
tree, when not in a cluster, starts with
a tangle of shoots around the butt. The
leaves are eaten off, and stiff, spiky
stems develop, forming an effective guard.
But for this protection the trees would
be eaten young, even when grass is plenti-
ful.
The foliage of the inland beefwood is
easily reached for fodder. The wood, a
beautifully-grained cabinet wood, and
most durable, is principally used on sheep
runs for fencing and yard-building and
for firewood. Scrub beefwood, plentiful
in eastern jungles, is tall, but can be
checked and spread. Both will grow in
almost any soil and situation.
The inland quandong, protected tor
its economic importance, has a broad top
of succulent leaves, 2in. to 3in. long,
which are relished by sheep and cattle.
It bears heavy crops of edible fruit.
Inside the fruity part is a nut with a
nutritious kernel, rich in oil. The wood
is hard and yellowish, and does not
crack or warp. The tree flourishes in the
poorest soils, and is not affected by
drought. The myall tree likes rich soil.
The foliage is excellent forage ; the wood,
used for boomerangs and nullas, is heavy
and fragrant. Motherimbung, one of the
acacias, is a great drought-resister, grow-
ing to 25ft. high. It is probably the best
of all fodder trees. Lop it severely. The
wilga trees, about 20ft., with long, narrow
leaves, eaten by all kinds of stock, has
light-colored and tough timber.
The kurrajong and the bottle-tree are
valuable. The pulpy roots of the former
have a considerable quantity of water.
The seeds, roasted and ground, are used
in the bush as a beverage; the bark
makes strong cord. The wood is soft,
light and tough ; on sheep runs it is used
for hurdles. The bottle-tree has no
timber use. All parts of it, including
trunks and roots, when cut up, are eaten
by stock. It is a waste, however, to cut
the trees down.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Valerin”: To graze lucerne sow the
seed in rows three feet wide. This allows
cultivation between the rows and lets in
air and light.
“Grunter”: The Speck pig-farmers
swear by carrots for feeding. They turn
out a firm, well-flavored flesh, fresh or
cured. Select a short carrot and give a
bucket per pig daily.
“Emel”: In winter the hatching period
may be protracted to 28 days. Do not
discard eggs not rotten if they do not
hatch in three weeks. Chickens slow
to hatch make normal progress later.
“Tenrag”: Common salt helps fowls
to digest food, Excessive quantities cause
diarrhoea. Suitable dose is 4oz. to every
100 mature birds, twice weekly. Salt
should not be given to stock under four
months old.
“Mouse”: “Lion’s” advice re willow
propagation (B. 2/8/’33) heeds a note of
warning. Keep them out of the cow
paddock. Capeweed flowers and rank
clover are non-starters compared with
willow in the matter of taint in the milk.
“Wandi”: To destroy rats, partly fill
a bin with water and cover it with
enough chaff to give the appearance of
a firm surface, then sprinkle a few grains
of wheat or corn over it. The rat is
quickly drowned.
“Bill R.”: Before mounting a young
horse be sure it has been well mouthed.
With a pair of plough reins guide it in
every direction about the paddock and
pull it up .frequently, until completely
under mouth control.
“Mercury”: To heal a horse’s collar-
or saddle-gall, first wash the sore with
salt and water. Apply methylated spirit
—carefully, as it burns for a few seconds.
The same spirit can heal a milker’s sore
teat, if applied before the salve.
“Willeroo”: Pumpkin seeds, which
are often thrown away, are a nutritious
food for pigs and milking cows. With
pigs the seeds act as a vermifuge. The
seeds and waste part from the kitchen
alone will keep a pig in good order.
“A.G.R.”: A couple of sucking pigs
will save a great deal of orchard work
by destroying windfalls, on which they
fatten; and need little extra feeding.
Apple-fed pork is good. When the season
is over the pigs may be sold or killed
and cured on the farm.
“Deekay”: To yard ewes with lambs,
make a “rattle” for mustering, so they
can’t hear each other bleating. Cut nine
or ten pieces of tin about three inches
square. Snip off the sharp corners and
thread the tins on a length of wire.
Twist the two ends of the wire together
to form a handle.
“Beady”: Send with suckers to market
about 10 per cent, of grown sheep ; they
then travel quieter and sell better. If
grown fats are not available, I send 10
per cent, of their mothers with them, and
bring them back when the lambs are
trucked. It’s a little extra trouble, but
returns justify it.
“Eureka”: To stop the rabbits eatirfg
the bark off the butts of fruit-trees heat
a kerosene-tin of linseed oil until it is
smoking hot and then stir into it one part
of flowers of sulphur to nine parts of oil.
When mixture is thoroughly dissolved
allow it to cool and paint the butts of the
trees with it to a height of three feet.
“Hornby”: To erect fence-posts across
gullies or steep watersheds, place the
posts in position, drop in any available
stones and stout wood-chips and fill earth
in. Have a good stone coping. This
will break the power of running water
and give the least possible wash-outs.
Sogging will be minimised and the fence
as a whole strengthened. 4
“Deekay”: To clean cheaply the stars
of the drill, remove them and warm
them to a moderate heat over a fire. Let
them cool, and the fertiliser will chip off
easily. A dearer way is to pour kero-
sene over the stars in the drill and turn
the axle of the fertiliser stars by means
of the handle.
“Wrash”: Some day you may wish to
lift corrugated-iron from the roof, so
don’t clinch the spring-head nails that
protrude through the rafters. Cut them
off flush with a nail-cutter. To draw
the nails when removing the iron, place
a crowbar or round iron rod in the cor-
rugations to use as a fulcrum for the
claw-hammer.
“Ripe Corn”: “Wen” and “Sheepo’
may be right up to a point in advocating
no winter shearing, it’s the big time in
all N. Q’land, however. I have lost
maiden ewes off shears in April. Many
thousands of sheep died in Nelia and
Kynuna districts in October, 1930. If sheep
straight off shears are subjected to a cold,
wet night, even with shelter and grass,
they will die. The fatter they are the
quicker they die from frozen kidney fat.
Dry cold seldom kills sheep unless they
are starving. I have seen sheep die from
standing in heat in August.
“Porker”: P. O’Brien, of Highfields
(Q.), owns a Berkshire sow which has
produced 54 pigs and reared them in four
litters, without losing one. In one litter
of 12 every pig was a female ; a few
boars were in the others.
“5.N.0.”: The Solingen system of pick-
ling lucerne hay with salt is being tried
on a farm in Tamworth (N.S.W.) district.
The idea is that the lucerne can be stacked
in the shed in a much greener state than
under ordinary conditions, when layered
alternately with dressings of coarse salt.
This preserves the green color, prevents
sweating and spontaneous combustion
and makes the feed more palatable. It
will be an advantage to the farmer if he
is able to stack his hay without waiting
for more than a couple of days, as the
risk of deterioration from rain and other
causes will be obviated.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
I have on many occasions used a mixture
of kerosene 1 pint, white lead 1 tablespoon,
iodoform 1 saltspoon, on open wounds on
horses, but recently l used it on a horse badly
staked, and it apparently poisoned the
wound. (1) Is white lead a blood poison if
applied to an open wound ? (2) If so, would
kerosene or iodoform kill the poison ? —7828.
(1) White lead, a common term for lead car-
bonate, is commonly used in the treatment of
fissured heels in horses, and is usually applied
in the form of an ointment. It is not readily
absorbed by tissues and should not lead to lead
poisoning if applied in small quantities to a
wound. It is poisonous if given internally, and
is not a good preparation to apply to raw, fresh,
lacerated wounds. In the case described the
preparation would be irritant. It is suggested,
however, that the apparent poisoning of the
wound was due to bacterial infection caused
by the dirty stake, and not to the lead. (2)
Neither kerosene nor iodoform applied super-
ficially to a stake wound would prevent bacterial
infection if the stake were dirty. Suitable treat-
ment would have been thorough cleansing of the
wound with disinfectant solutions such as lysol,
solyptol, etc.
(1) What was the annual average wheat pro-
duction of Australia for the last 10 years, in
bushels ? (2) What amount is consumed in
Australia for food, seed, feed, etc., annually?
(3) What amount was exported each season for
the last 10 years ? —7915.
(1) For the period 1923-24 to 1932-33 in-
clusive, average was 157,764,626 bushels. (2)
For the period 1922-23 to 1931-32 inclusive,
average was 49,935,296 bushels. (3) 1922-23,
50,428,920; -24, 84,445,525; -25, 125,041,518;
-26, 78,273,795 ; -27, 97,607,874; -28, 73,863,184;
-29, 108,954,924; -30, 62,743,071; -31,
144,386,960; -32, 156,722,200 bushels; -33, not
yet available. These are computations in which
flour exports are expressed in their wheat
equivalent.
(1) I have been offered eggs for hatching
from a poultry farm near Sydney. Would there
be any danger of introducing the “Newcastle
disease” or any such trouble by using these
eggs for hatching? (2) May chickwheat be
fed to young chicks in place of chicken mixture
for the evening meal, or would it be better to
keep entirely to bran and pollard, evening meal
included ? —7887. .
(1) Newcastle disease has never occurred in
N.S.W. and it is not transmitted through the
egg. For practical purposes the only disease
of poultry which is carried in this manner is
bacillary white diarrhoea, the germ of whnm
is present in the ovaries of affected hens, ana
consequently also in eggs produced by such
hens. Resulting chickens, if the germ is
present in the egg, are born with the disease,
and deaths commence on the fourth or nitn
day as a rule. Bacillary white diarrhoea is a very
fatal disease, and all precautions should be
taken to prevent its introduction. This can
be done by purchasing eggs for hatching from
reputable poultry farms, and preferably from
those farms which have had their breeding stock
blood tested for b.w.d. (2) Chickens for the
first three weeks should be fed on a ration
made up as follows: Pollard, 20; bran, 20;
maizemeal, 40; meatmeal, 5; skim-milK
powder, 15; bonemeal, 1; salt, 1; cod-liver
oil, 1; all parts by weight. Rations similar
to the above are balanced, and if grain is .ed
in addition the balance is thereby upset unles-,
compensatory additions of concentrates are
made. It would be advisable therefore not to
feed the chickwheat. Fresh green feed ana
shell grit must be given in addition to the fore-
going. . '

MARKET SECTION
Dairy-produce Restriction
While the Australian Dairy Produce
Export Board spent two days last week
wrestling with overseas freight-rates, pub-
licity in Britain and the appointment of
a manager to its London office, nothing
officially came forward regarding the
rumored restriction of dairy-produce
exports. Members individually, however,
seemed sure that the problem would
have to be faced if the declared
policy of the British Government to in-
crease home production is to be car-
ried into effect. It has been suggested
that Australia will be asked, first, to
restrict shipments of cheese and eggs.
If this should happen the outlook for
the Queensland dairying industry, which
is the largest cheese exporter in the Com-
monwealth, will be pretty bad, while
scores of feather squatters in the main-
land .States will face ruin. For the
year 1931-32 Australia shipped overseas
nearly 10,000,000 dozen eggs, and that
amount will be substantially increased
during the present export season. Should
a reduction of these exports take place
there is no other market which can
absorb the quantity withheld; as the local
consumptive demand, even with normal
exports, is fully catered for.
* * * *
Efforts to stabilise the butter market
by the establishment of export quotas
based on the principles of the dried-fruits
legislation seem for the time being to
have reached a dead end. While the
Queensland and N.S.W. Governments
have announced their intention to intro-
duce the necessary legislation, the Vic.
Government is definitely split. Country-
party men in the Cabinet are keen
supporters of the scheme, but the U.A.P.
section is passively opposed to it on the
ground that it smacks of socialisation.
To make it legislatively watertight, a
Federal Act, implementing the State Acts,
is necessary. The export season will soon
be in full swing. Reluctance to export
to a market the price ruling on which
in six weeks’ time from the date of ship-
ment is largely a matter of speculation
will result in the local market being
flooded with butter.
■c- * * *
For some weeks the butter interests
have been wrestling with the Overseas
Transport Association to get a reduction
on the rates charged for butter and
cheese. It was hoped that a substantial
reduction, about 20 per cent., would be
secured, but the best offer available, when
the show-down occurred last week, was
5 per cent. The Australian Dairy Pro-
duce Board did not half like the stand-
and-deliver attitude of the shipping
people, but had to accept the offer, which,
after all, represents a saving of £43,000.
What made acceptance so unpalat-
able was the knowledge that the M.L.
board had secured a contract at £1 9s.
4d. less per ton on butter and £1 9s. lOd.
less per ton on cheese. The board can-
not understand why it should be less
favorably treated than M.L., but perhaps
the explanation can be found in the fact
that the M.L. board sent a delegation to
London and negotiated directly. Aus-
tralia acted through intermediaries, and
for that privilege, on the basis of last
year’s shipments, will have to pay
£136,897 more than M.L. shippers load-
ing the same quantity.
“J.M.”: J. S. MacFarlane, manager of
Dairy Products and a vice-president of the
Queensland Shippers’ Association, objects
to the charge made by N.S.W. interests
that his State and Victoria have been lax
about the quality of their butter. He
should explain why last season Queens-
land managed to get only 3 per cent, of
its total export graded as choicest and
Victoria only 5 per cent. N.S.W.’s pro-
portion was 8 per cent. In N.S.W., he
says, only 20 per cent, of the butter is
submitted for examination by the grad-
ing officials. Has he never heard of Norco
Co-op., Ltd., whose outturn is nearly 30
per cent, of N.S.W.’s production, and all
of whose butter is examined by State and
Federal graders?
Wheat and the U.S.A.
When discussions for wheat restriction
were in progress in London one of the
U.S.A. delegation used the threat that
if other nations did not agree to do what
Uncle Sam told them they would find
wheat dumped against them in Asia
“at the price of dirt.” Fortunately, as it
seemed, they were able to agree. Now,
however, the U.S.A. is plunging into sub-
sidised export just as previously it
plunged into subsidised shipping. It
proposes to find a maximum loss of
7,000,000 dollars on 30,000,000 to
35,000,000 bushels to be exported—in
other words, 20 cents a bushel, which is
quite a heap when the price can scarcely
reach three-quarters of a dollar all told.
It is proposed to sell to countries —
China, Japan, Ireland, Spain, Portugal
and the Philippines are mentioned —
which will accept supplies at 15 cents to
20 cents below domestic level. The whole
U.S.A. export quota was estimated
during the conference at 47,000,000
bushels. It is easy to talk about
such things; when this scheme is being
successfully carried out it will be time
enough to criticise it. There are diffi-
culties in the way of it as high as Popo-
catepetl.
Wheat Pools
“The Chiel”: Notwithstanding agita-
tion, a large section of Australia’s wheat-
growers is definitely opposed to wheat
pools.
* * *
No wheat pool has yet secured any-
thing tangible in the way of increased
prices for its members ; this applies to
the well-organised, Government-sup-
ported pools of Canada and the U.S.A. as
well as to the partially-supported pools
in the Australian States. The farmer
delivering his wheat to a pool has to
accept a small first payment and then
wait for subsequent dividends at indefi-
nite intervals. Not until the final divi-
dend is declared does he know just what
he has earned for his year’s work. These
final dividends have a nasty habit of
dragging on until after his next crop is
planted, and sometimes until after it is
harvested.
* * * *
By selling privately he- gets his cash
on delivery, and under present conditions
this is worth more than a visionary few
pence per bushel extra which he may
or may not receive in the dim distant
future. It also enables him, if he can
afford the luxury of holding his wheat,
to back his own opinion of the market
and sell at what he thinks is the most
favorable time.
■■'f * * *
The pool advocates’ objective is an
increased price to the Australian con-
sumer. They see so many other indus-
tries bolstered up by artificial prices that
perhaps there is some justification for
that.
Wool Keeps Up
With 180,000 bales sold and Brisbane’s
week of selling averaging 14d., the wool
market has had a fair test, and seems
to be standing the strain. Most brokers
think the position statistically sound,
though caution should be the watchword.
The Brisbane sales tally in price altitude
with the results of the second week of
the Sydney sales,-at which £l9 ss. per
bale, or 14id. per pound, was realised.
Yorkshire appears to be hopeful about
the position—but not so hopeful as some
local authorities. Some brokers are
warning clients against accepting cash
offers and appealing, for support for the
auction system. It all depends on the
class of wool and the price. If, as is sug-
gested, a substantial rise is definitely and
permanently established, auction is best
for lines likely to be favored by the
Japanese and the Continent.
“Noils”: A change in the wool situa-
tion which has yet to be chronicled is
an increase in demand for low crossbred
wools. Owing to favoring exchange and
other advantages there has been very
little accumulation of fair to good
quality wools, which, for the most part,
have been absorbed as fast as they have
been marketed. On the other hand there
is a heavy accumulation of low cross-
bred types, and this has been due in a
great degree to the comparatively favor-
able prices, from the consumers’ point
of view, of the finer wools. To have cer-
tain wools in strong demand, to the de-
valuing of other qualities, is not a good
thing for the industry generally. A better
demand for the neglected low-class
wools and the clearing of the heavy
stocks held would do a lot to stabilise
the market.
Sugar Marketing
The secretary of the Vic. Grocers’
Association wrote to the Sugar Board
that a better method than that of allow-
ing the C.S.R. to market would be to
let all retailers get their sugar at whole-
sale rates. The existing practice, he
declared, gave an advantage to chain
stores. The Sugar Board has refused
to make a change.
“Elgar”: “Tassie” and “Five Crown”
(B. 23 /8/’33) are right about the hope-
lessness of the apple-grower’s position,
and the pear-grower-exporter is in
much the same case. I myself know
four growers, just outside Melbourne,
who, instead of getting a decent return
for their fruit, have had to recoup the
agents. Australia sent away over
3,000,000 cases of apples this season, and
it is doubtful if the growers will get three
million pence for the lot. But the rail-
ways, agents, shippers, shipping cos. and
others all get their cut. What can the
M. do? Vegetables are as bad. We
have no export trade in them and there is
no inducement to start one ; yet lots of
places just outside Australia can’t get
green vegetables for love or money. I
saw a shopful of cauliflowers in a Melb.
shop yesterday, prime stuff, marked “Id.
each ; take your pick.” Listen to Vic-
toria’s Minister of Lands, Dunstan,
speaking to Marong Shire Councillors:
“In the lower Mallee, within a distance
of 20 miles I have recently seen 42
abandoned farms. This cannot be
allowed to go on.”
“N.C.”: Proposals to increase pine-
apple planting south of the Tweed,
N. now being discussed, may lead
to dangerous overproduction. The
Queensland Fruit Marketing Committee
has seen fit to issue a warning. The north
coast of N.S.W. is suitable for pineapple-
growing, but it is doubtful if it can be
done on a commercial basis. The in-
dustry cannot exist without canning the
surplus over fresh-fruit-market capacity.
In 1930 canners paid ss. 3d. per case
of 601 b., but for the summer crop of
1931 the price fell to 2s. 6d. It has
since increased in stages to about 3s.
6d. Co-operation with Queensland
growers will prevent market clashes and
help to solve distribution problems.
Farmers south of the Tweed should give
the pineapple-marketing problem close
study before engaging in the industry
seriously.
“E. Ably”: The reference to Edward
Sassoon’s criticism of our produce over-
seas (B. 6/9/’33) makes one wonder
whether an occasional paragraph is to
be the end of the matter. Similar com-
plaints are all too frequent. I suggest
that every article bear a sticker indicating
where complaints will be received, with
a view to investigation, and possibly
compensation, at the packer’s expense.
Farm-made Butter
“Fodgie”: There are good reasons why
the sale of farm butter is increasing. At
Adelaide on August 30 highest grade
factory was quoted wholesale at Is. 2|d.
per lb. (less stabilisation levy of ljd.).
The producer got Is. Id. The same
butter is quoted retail at Is. 4sd. Farm
butter is quoted wholesale at l\d. to Bd.
The retail price is about 2d. above whole-
sale —a saving of 6|d. to per lb.
to consumers. Factories are allowed 22
per cent, of the cream (the overrun, they
call it). This brings the producers’ test
down, and they are actually paid only
for about two-thirds of the butter they
produce. It is better to sell 201 b. at Bd.
than 131 b. at Is. Id.
I bought a three-gallon can. It cost me,
freight included, £1 6s. 4|d. I sent it
with 211 b. cream ; test 55 per cent., grade
choicest, butter-fat 121 b. Freight, 4s. Bd.;
total value, 9s. 2d.; amount payable,
4s. 6d. I made up my next lot of cream ;
got 181 b. butter, which I sold at 9d. a
pound—a profit over cream of 9s.
In January, 1932,1 tried two more cans.
One returned me 7s. Bd., the other 4s. 6d.
Not satisfied with the butter-fat results,
I complained to the firm, and they ex-
plained about the overrun. I tried another
firm, and my total receipts—or, rather,
value —were 10s. 5d.; total expenses,
9s. 2d.; receipts (by cheque), Is. 3d. That
is all I actually received on four cans
of cream, and I still owe 10s. or some-
thing on the can. Next I tried a Port
Adelaide co-operative firm, and it agreed
to pay me the price it paid the factories
for farm butter. I was surprised when
I got Is. 2d. per lb. The price fell later,
of course, to 10d., but factory prices were
falling. I am not making sufficient to
export, and the local stores can only pay
6d.
How does farm butter affect the
quality of factory butter? And is farm
butter exported?
“X.T.”: N.S.W. Dept, of Agriculture
and its dairy branch are suffering from
the effects of a nasty uppercut, delivered
from the least expected quarter. For
some time past the Primary Producers’
Union has been recognised as the adviser
of the Minister in all matters pertain-
ing to the cow. Now, one of the
largest sections of the union has plumped
unanimously for Federal control. No-
thing will satisfy it except the scrapping
of the dairy legislation in all States. That
recommendation will be considered by
the central body at its quarterly meet-
ing which starts to-day (20/9/’33), and,
it seems, it will be carried. The rela-
tively low proportion of choicest grade
butter exported from Queensland and
Victoria is responsible for the revolt, for
it is argued that until uniformity in pro-
duction and manufacture rules in the
main producing States, it is useless for
the dairymen of N.S.W. to aim at perfec-
tion.
“Silentio”: You won’t find a glut on
any market for sweet corn or goose-
berries. Golden Bantam can be sown
in drills closer than the usual maize sow-
ing, and will crop for you in any soil or
weather. It packs well in its own wrapper
for market. The gooseberry is treated for
culture like a tomato, and has no pests
or disease to worry it. In punnets for
small lots, or in cases for jam factories,
growers cannot go wrong. These are
two crops that, with small outlay and
little attention or cultivation costs, will
pay well. Produce something the public
wants.

The Empire s Greatest
Assurance Institution
C 1 IGHTY-FIVE years of thrift-service to the British
people have won for The Prudential the premier
place among the insurance institutions of the
Empire.
The name of the Company is itself a symbol of
strength, security and service. That is why new
business written last year alone exceeded
£82,500,000 (Sterling), and why the total sums
assured (including bonuses) now exceed
£720,000,000 (Sterling) equal to the total con
solidated revenue of the Commonwealth oi
Australia for the last ten years. In Australian
currency the income of The Prudential exceeds
£1,000,000 weekly.
The annual report for the year ended Decem-
ber 31, 1932, disclosed these colossal figures:
English Sterling.
Assets £263,694,842
Claims Paid £407,000,000
Annual Income ----- £48,685,145
Profits Paid to Policyholders

Life Policies in Force - 28,000,000
Could more convincing proof of Prudential service
be required than this overwhelming demonstration
of public confidence?

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
More Queensland Celebrities
Who in Brisbane does not know J. F.
Maxwell? He was born there. His voice
was first heard publicly in the Normal
School yard. Then for seven years it
rang in shire council halls ; for ten years
more in the City Council. In 1920 he
was Mayor and received the Prince of
Wales—he might have become “Sir
Joseph” but for Labor in office. He has
been president of the Local Authorities’
Association, president of the Queensland
Employers’ Federation, and is now mem-
ber for the conservative electorate of
Toowong and Opposition Whip. Frith
caught him in a pessimistic moment just
after somebody had murmured “social-
isation” to him.
E. B. Swayne, next door, is the Country
party secretary in the House —he repre-
sents Mirani in the North. He formed
the first farmers’ organisation in Queens-
land, and with Col. Rankin brought for-
ward the first bill to regulate the price of
sugar. Twenty-six years ago, when he
first entered the House, a Scottish member,
listening to the steady patter of his care-
fully-prepared maiden speech, said:
“Mon, he canna keep that up!” But at
76 he is as wordy and as careful as he
J. F. Maxwell, M.L.A.
E. B. Swayne, M.L.A.
C. E. Travill.
W. J. Wellington, M.L.A.
M. P. Hynes, M.L.A.
NORTHERN FACES, No. 3.
Was at 50—and everybody likes him be-
cause he is disinterested and has never
sought preferment.
C. E. Travill, Town Clerk of Bris-
bane, shows how local traditions have
changed in a generation. Of yore, Bris-
bane City Council had a crop of whis-
kers and beards which could not have
been matched nearer than the Old Men’s
Camp in the Arunta country of Central
Australia. The first qualification of the
Town Clerk then used to be that he
should have a beard —but a discreet one
which would not aspire to compete with
John McMaster’s, though in the days
of Proe and Tom Rees there was a
move for hirsute reduction and uni-
formity. Then came the flippant post-war
years, and a Town Clerk who not only
has no fungus but who goes about with
a youthful smile on his countenance. He
is a very efficient Town Clerk for all
that.
Wellington, M.L.A., colleague of
Johnny Mullan, the Attorney-General,
has, by the irony of fate, a nearer like-
ness to Napoleon. He is member for
Charters Towers —in his long career he
has never done anything more distin-
guished than vote solidly with his party.
Lastly comes M. P. Hynes, M.L.A., son
of the first white child born in Mackay.
He got into Parliament after having a
finger in every industrial trouble in
the North, where he is known affection-
ately as “Mossy.” • He has been in the
House for a decade, and is Minister
for Labor and Industry, a position for
which he was trained as an Industrial
Court advocate and A.W.U. organiser.
“17 Deg. North”: Five years ago I
retired to the New England tablelands,
after having spent 30 years in the North.
The frigid winters of northern N.S.W.
always gave me a longing to hike away
beyond Cooktown ; and here I am back
again, enjoying the best climate on God’s
earth. A glance at the robust, healthy
children attending the Mt. Mulligan State
school would be a revelation to south-
erners. Mt. Mulligan has been examined
by the experts of a big American mining
corporation with a view to electric
power produced by pulverised coal. Mt.
Isa mining engineers have proved that
crude oil costs can be cut in half by
the use of pulverised coal. The huge
Hodgkinson goldfield, with its hundreds
of abandoned goldmines, may yet be
rejuvenated by economic power supplied
by the dust of the black diamond. To-
day I met Ned Spicer, aged 78. I first
met him 50 years ago at Armidale
(N.S.W.); he is opening up a gold reef
“down the Hodgkinson.” I met another
old cobber here, Charlie Ah Long, store-
keeper, who landed at Cooktown in the
’seventies and helped his compatriots
root out nearly £6,000,000 from the
Palmer River. He became storekeeper,
butcher, stockowner, and various other
useful things in the North. He is over
80. The tropics are responsible for this
senile state of affairs.
* * * *
“Vic”: Fishing in the lohnstone at
Halifax (where the local pubkeeper
used to keep a couple of ’gators chained
up in the back yard like dogs) has its
exciting moments. Two men working
Victoria Creek found themselves with a
saurian in the net; and after a lot of
trouble got him into the boat, leaving
him, gingerly, well meshed in the stern.
En route he revived and went overboard,
net and all, and the subsequent proceed-
ings were like an underwater bout be-
tween Tom Lurich and “Whiskers”
Blake. Eventually the quarry was landed.
He was 12 feet long.
* * * *
“Yeppoon”: Versatile people, we
Capricornians— not the least like the
goat we are named after. The other
night at Alton Downs the Country
Women’s Association brightened a dance
with a competition for the most useful
and best-made article constructed from
a sugar-bag. The entries comprised bed-
spreads, cushions, blazers, suits of clothes
—in fact everything but scanties and
income-tax forms. Among the winners
were a workbasket and a doormat.
And why not? Were not the mothers
of us of yore skilled in putting the
brand of Harper’s oatmeal well out
of sight in the place where we sat down?
At the small school I went to, “getting
a harper” had a highly significant (and
painful) meaning.
* * * *
“K. 0.”: Forgan Smith has plenty of
scope for his Unproductive Lands Bill.
Of 28,000,000 acres alienated in Queens-
land only 2,170,000 acres are cultivated,
and of this only 1,250,000 acres carry
actual crop, the rest being grassland or
fallow. The Government estimates that
a further 4,000,000 acres of alienated
land should be under artificial grass. The
greatest scope for the bill is in the Far
North. There scrub areas in the midst of
farms make harbors for pests, an I are a
nuisance to everybody round about. But
before the Forgan Smiths begin opera-
tions, it would be well for them to see
that they are not merely adding to un-
exportable surpluses of produce. It
would be hardly possible to add more
to sugar areas profitably, and dairying
for the time being is up against over-
production.
“Sore Tongue”: Speculators are the
only people who have got anything out
of tobacco-growing so far. The average
grower is on the bread-line. Until he
cures his product, he cannot expect
more. I have tried seven different brands
of Australian cigarette tobacco in
the last 12 months. ’ All of them
slipped badly. My last selection re-
quired so many matches per cigarette
to keep it alight as to cost more than
the save against imported-leaf tobaccos.
* * $
“Mundowie”: Why not send an
orchestra to Arnhem Land if it is a
matter of impressing Black Brother in a
gentlemanly fashion? In the early days
in N.S.W., Bungle-gumble station, in the
Dubbo district, was attacked by a mob,
and when firearm volleys failed to drive
them away, Moore Campbell, the owner,
seized his bagpipes and marched out,
playing a soulful pibroch. In a few
seconds the blacks were on the run —and
they never went back. Iri the Lismore
(Richmond River) district there was an
abo., a concertina virtuoso named
Charlie, who worked with the cedar-
getters. Bush blacks camped in the
neighborhood and stole from the timber
camps. One evening at sundown Charlie
strode towards the abo. camp with the
concertina in full blast. The mob bolted,
leaving half-cooked meats on the fires
and even their weapons behind them.
* * * *
“L.A.S.”: Rockhampton’s steam trams,
which belch tongues of blue flames from
their funnels each time they stop, are
not that city’s only locomotive curiosity.
Along Denison-street, in the heart of the
city, the northern mail trains run for
about a mile on unfenced rails, dwellings
lining both sides. The rail track crosses
nine streets and two tram lines, while
small children shout at the drivers from
only a few yards off. Trains also run
along Derby-street from the Fitzroy
River wharves to the main (Stanley-
street) rail station, and nobody gets
excited. But, of course, this city plays
cricket and football on Sundays, and its
brass bands march the streets on Sunday
* ? * * *
“Mataranka”: Another parson—this
time an Australian, a Mr. Norwood of
Geelong— suggests that we should give
the Northern Territory to Japan. I wonder
whom he thinks the place belongs to now,
anyway. There are about 4000 whites
in it—a large proportion of those have
a touch of black blood—and 50,000-
odd blacks. If whites and Chinese were
matched man for man in Darwin, the
Chinese would win with a 60 per cent,
margin to spare, and if a census were
taken of whites on the Gulf side within
the three-mile limit it would usually be
found that Jap luggermen predominated.
Outside the Territory, of course, at T.I.
and Broome, the Japs are about five to
one against the white population. What
Norwood really should suggest is that
the Asiatics should hand our northern
coastline back to us.
* * * *
“Tanton”: Ten years ago a part of
the Townsville beach near Kissing Point,
, -.l- , r ,f , ,
T . tbe Hinchinbrook
Islands, was a hopeless-looking sandhill.
To-day it has seaside huts, a bathing en-
closure (shark-proof, made of N.S.W.
wire) and a good road leading to it.
The enclosure has just been completed,
after a lot of opposition. A visitor had
been mangled by a shark, but even then
the opponents were not convinced. To
Mrs. Crowther goes the credit for making
the shark-proof fence a fact, so it has
been called the “Ethel Crowther Bathing
Enclosure.”
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Sir Leslie Wilson’s Boy Scout Fund
figured largely in our social doings last
week. Lud Mayor Greene set things
going by handing the visiting boy scouts
ham sandwiches at the City Hall one
morning. His Ex. was present. Next
day one of our Valley departmental
stores gave a liberal portion of its
cash takings to the cause. Scoutmasters
and scouts conducted the show.
Although almost the end of the danc-
ing season, it doesn’t seem to be the
end of the debutantes. At the ball on
the Cathay (for the Scout Fund, of
course) the Glasgow lady, in mauvish
pink, took charge of five young things,
and presented them to Sir Leslie and Lady
Wilson, the latter in gold satin, toning
with her daffodil bouquet. Myriads of
twinkling lights outlined the ship, and,
as the decoration committee members
had sent an SOS to every garden in
Brisbane, masses of lovely blooms were
everywhere. Marjorie Wilson came be-
fore her parents, and brought with her
Mrs. G. Wood, from England, a daughter
of Admiral Halsey.
Artistic Brisbane took the lift to the
Gainsborough Gallery, and showed keen
interest in the exhibition of pictures by
the talented Vida Lahey. Vida is better
known as a water-colorist, but after
this exhibition her fame as a painter of
oils will be broadcast. Dr. W. N. Robert-
son declared the opening. Our own sea-
shores, Burleigh Heads and Bribie
Island seem to have been sufficient in-
spiration for the artist to show her talent.
No matter what flimsy frock is
wrapped in tissue paper, yearning to be
worn by the owner, the weather is not
yet ready for such apparel. The Glas-
gow lady chose a coat and skirt. It
was black, worn with a spotted scarf.
She was with Mrs. Duckett White, whose
wine-shaded turnout was worn with black
chapeau. Mrs. J. E. Stewart brought
sister Anita Allt, from Sydney. Smart-
dresser Mrs. J. J. Power favored black,
contrasting with her bright green hat.
As usual the Cadell Garricks had a tea-
party.
Enid Dickson, art mistress of St.
Margaret’s School, feels she might be
able to produce another Daphne Mayo,
now that she has a beautiful new art
room to work in. John Darnell left
certain sums of money to be spent on art,
and the school for girls has erected a
modern studio. Daphne Mayo did the
opening.
Regal Mrs. Stanley Chapman, whose
interest in the Bush Book Club has not
waned since its formation in 1921, has
decided to retire from the presidency,
which office she has so admirably filled
for 11 years. Members are very sorry,
but are congratulating one another that
Mrs. Ormond Smith has stepped forward
to replace Mrs. Chapman,
An interested audience filled Cremorne
Theatre to see “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” produced by Barbara Sisley for
the Shakspeare Society. The part of
Bottom was in the capable hands of Leo
Guyatt. Brunette Beryl Telford wore
Titania’s flowing robes, and elfin-like
Salkeld pleased as Puck.
The Brisbane Austral Choir and the
State and Municipal Orchestra rendered
Mendelssohn’s oratorio “St. Paul” at the
City Hall. Sir Leslie and Lady Wilson
brought Marjorie, and were met in the
vestibule by president R. J. Archibald.
E. R. B. Jordan directed the perform-
ance, and Eric Haynes led the orchestra,
Kathleen Dixon has won the associate
championship of the Indooroopilly club.
The club champion title was won by
Douglas Ranger, aged 16, .the youngest
member; the runner-up was his brother
Kenneth, who is 18.

(1) Did the family of Oliver Cromwell retain
the name after Richard Cromwell returned to
his rural home 7 (2) Are any of Oliver’s
descendants living 7 (3) Were any of his
descendants connected with Ham House in
Glamorganshire 7 —7865.
(1) Richard Cromwell called himself John
Clarke for a time, but returned to England
under his own name and began to live at Ches-
hunt in 1680. (2) No direct living descendants,
but there is a large number of indirect
descendants, in the female line. The present

(one of whom died unmarried and two without
issue). (3) No.
(1) When did Britain go off the gold standard,
and why 7 (2) Why did English notes and dollars
become dear to Australians ? (3) Why is the
export of gold restricted in Britain 7 (4) Why
has the price of gold risen to such an extent
lately 7—1921.
(1) Britain went off the gold standard in
September, 1931, because of the heavy drain
upon the Bank of England’s gold reserves,
caused by distrust of sterling at that time.
(2) Because we went further off the
gold standard than either England or the
United States, and our notes would purchase
correspondingly less than English or American
notes. (3) Probably because the authorities wish
to control gold stocks in case of a return to
the gold standard. (4) Because of the deprecia-
tion of sterling in relation to gold currencies,
caused by balance of indebtedness, nervousness,
price-levels and other factors.

Did Jack Read, a native of Hobart, who
beat Herb McCoy for the Australian light-
weight championship in 1913, have many fights
when he went to America with Sam Langford 7
—7992.
Read made two trips to the U.S.A., and had
66 fights while there. Englishmen Freddy
Welsh and Ted Lewis are the only boxers not
American-born with as many contests in the
U.S.A. on their records.
In what year did the Martinique earthquake
take place, and what was the loss of life 7
7968.
In August, 1767, 1600 persons perished in
an earthquake. A ’quake on Jan. 11, 1839,
killed nearly 700 people. On May 8, 1902, a
volcanic eruption of Mont Pele caused the loss
of 40,000 lives.
(1) How are tea-tree leaves collected 7 (2)

to cut 7 (4) Does the age or sex of trees
matter 7 (5) How many varieties of tea-tree
are there 7 (6) From whom can I obtain
further information 7 —7708.
(1) Branches and leaves are cut from the trees,
cut up. and placed on hessian sheets, 6ft. by
6ft. The four corners are tied when a sheet
is full. The load is placed on slides or lorries,
according to nature of ground, and hauled to
the distillery. (2) Usual method adopted with
essential oils, i.e., with water or steam in tanks.
The stills are usually portable, and in the
N.S.W. distillery they aim at getting three dis-
tillations in eight hours. (3) All the year round.
(4) No. (5) There are between 30 and 40
different species in Australia, and at least one,
possibly many more, in M.L. The variety
worked in N.S.W. is Mellaleuca alternifolia.

Is a person other than a licensed electrician
allowed to operate the machine 7 (4) Would it
be advisable 10 show advertising slides ? (5)
Is it likely that a radio dealer would lend
amplifier and speaker (gramophone also) m
return for advertisement ? —7864.
(1) Chief Secretary’s Department, Sydney. (2)
It would be necessary to make a fireproof pro-
jection booth constructed in accordance with
the City Architect’s requirements. Specifications
can be obtained from the City Architect’s office.
(3) Not necessary, but it is advisable to employ
a man competent to handle the machine if a
satisfactory performance is to be given. (4)
Not for a one-night show. Slides cost about
6s. 6d. each. (5) Quite likely.
My daughter, who is going to Scotland, is 17.

(1) What are the qualifications of a radio
announcer? (2) Any vacancies in Sydney?
(3) Salary ? (4) To whom should application
be made ? —7868.
(1) Good enunciation; lack of any dialect,
patois or peculiarity of expression; good know-
ledge of English, ability to speak impromptu,
to handle situations where speech is essential.
Wide knowledge of music is very desirable,
and ability to announce musical items, with
composers’ names, in French, German and
Italian. A knowledge of sport and of public
affairs is an advantage. (2) None at present.
(3) £7 to £l2 per week. (4) To the managers
of the various stations.
If 1 am the owner of a licensed automatic
pistol in Queensland, and / desire to take the
weapon with me on a holiday to N.S.W., must
I apply for a N.S.W. license, or can I get a
permit ? —7783.
It would be necessary to apply to the police
for a pistol license, the fee for which, if
granted, would be 10s. There is no provision
for the issue of “permits” for pistols. It
would be incumbent upon the owner of the
firearm to satisfy the police that he has good
and sufficient reason for having the weapon in
his possession whilst in N.S.W.
Is there any possibility of an Australian join-
ing the British Army in India as a recruit ?
Is there a recruiting office in India ? If not,
how are recruits enlisted ? —7645.

choice as to where they serve. Further parti-
culars could be obtained on application to the
Under-Secretary of State, the War Office,
London.
Should primings be buried, or should they
be burned and the ashes distributed? Which
is safer, and do precautions apply to fruit-
tree primings ? —7830.
Burning is preferable for all sorts of prun-
ings, since it gets rid of aphis, pests, etc., and
the residue is rich in potash.
(1) List of the works of Theodore Dreiser?
(2) Have any been banned in the U.S.A. ? (3)
In Australia ? (4) What place does Dreiser
occupy among present-day novelists ? —7665.
(1) “Sister Carrie,” “Jennie Gerhardt,” “The
Financier,” “A Traveller at Forty,” “The
Titan,” “The Genius,” “Plays of the Natural
and the Supernatural,” “A Hoosier Holiday,”
“Free and Other Stories,” “Twelve Men,” “The
Hand of the Potter” (tragedy), “Hey Ruba-dub-
dub” (essays), “Book About Myself,” “The
Color of a Great City,” “An American
Tragedy,” “Moods” (verse), “Chains” (lesser
novels and stories), “Dreiser Looks at Russia,”
“A Gallery of Women,” “My City,” “Epitaph,”
“Fine Furniture,” “Dawn,” and “Tragic
America.” (2) “Sister Carrie” was withdrawn
by the publishers after a few copies had been
distributed, but was not banned. “The Genius”
was also withdrawn, and was banned in 1916.
“The American Tragedy” was banned in Massa-
chusetts. (3) No. (4) In spite of his style, which
is clumsy, critics agree that he occupies a
high place. “The American Tragedy” is
reckoned his best book.
What is the correct seating arrangement at a
wedding breakfast where there are three brides-
maids, a best man and a groomsman, and
parents of the bride and bridegroom ? —7825.
Receiving concluded, the newly-weds lead the
way to the dining-room and sit at the end or
in the middle of the principal table. Bride’s
father follows with bridegroom’s mother, bride-
groom’s father with bride’s mother, best man
with head bridesmaid, other groomsmen and
’maids, then the rest of the guests, who should
look for their place-cards.
How is the accurate tracking of the oscillator
tuning condenser accomplished in a superhetero-
dyne receiver ? —7874.
On the higher frequencies, the necessary fre-
quency displacement between the oscillator and
signal circuits is obtained by choosing a lower
value of inductance for the oscillator coil. On
the lower frequencies correct tracking is accom-
plished by connecting a padding condenser in
series with the oscillator condenser. Any varia-
tion in the capacity of this condenser will have
small effect on the higher frequencies, but will
result in an appreciable variation in the lower
ones. The tracking at mid-ranges will be accu-
rate if the pre-selector and oscillator stray
capacities have their correct values.

Will you please settle an argument ? A says
the Hentys .settled in Portland in 1834; B
says the Hentys were there before 1834 (some-
where about 1828). Which is right, or nearest
to right ? —7906.
The first of the Hentys, Edward, landed at
Portland Bay for the first time on November
19, 1834.
What was the fate of the trade-union banks
in the U.S.A.? Are any of them still operat-
ing ? —7773.
There were 22 such banks in existence in
1929, decreased to nine at the end of 1931.
The resources of these nine aggregated
38,700,000 dollars. For later and more de-
tailed information, communicate with the
Finance and Investment Division, Department
of Commerce, Washington.
(1) What is the theory of relativity ? (2) How
do astronomers estimate the distance of stars ?
—7449.
(1) It is a cosmic theory involving mathe-
matical reasoning of a very abstruse order.
“Popular” expositions of the arguments arc
misleading. Eddington’s “Mathematics of
Relativity” and Arthur Lynch’s “Case Against
Einstein” are works in English that sum up the
present position of the theory. (2) By trigono-
metrical, spectroscopic and various other
methods. See article on “Star” in “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica,” 11th edition.
How can I make a hessian truck-cover water-
proof ? I propose to use tar. How is it applied
to the material ? —8032.
Heat a kerosene-tin three-quarters full of tar
to near boiling point, then stir in gradually
enough powdered air-slaked lime to make a
creamy mixture. When it froths it is ready to
apply to the hessian. This dries like blacx
enamel; experiment with a small quantity first,
and, if too stiff for your purpose, better dress
with plain tar and allow to dry well.
(1) Would a coating of oil keep down dust on
a Murray-pine floor used for dancing ? (2) Best
preparation to use ? —7727.
(1) Oil is not now in favor, having been
superseded by wax dressings. Raw linseed oil,
with a little turps, applied hot and sparingly with
a brush, improves the surface. (2) Best method
is to have the floor cleaned and smoothed with
an electric sanding machine; then procure a
quantity of Carnauba wax or beeswax, scrape it
on to the floor in fine shreds with a knife, and
iron it into the wood with a very hot laundry
iron. If this is too laborious, melt the wax
over gentle heat and brush it into the wood.
(1) Is there any chemical or preparation that
can safely be added to home-made butter to
improve its keeping quality ? If so, what quan-
tity to the pound ? (2) Method of home-pre-
serving butter ?—7691.
(1) About 2 per cent, of boric acid may be
added to the butter, but the process is not very
suitable for home workers. Write to N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture, Sydney, for a leaflet
on the subject. (2) Two methods are described
in The Bulletin of 6/9/’33, page 24.
Recipe for making mango sauce as supplied
in petrol-tins to A.I.F. troops by a Queensland
organisation ? It was greenish. —7B7l.
Color depends on ripeness or greenness of
fruit. Assemble 12 green mangoes, 2|lb. sugar,
21b. tomatoes, |lb. apples, 2oz. ground ginger,
1 saltspoon cayenne pepper, lib. onions, 1 des-
sertspoon salt, 2 large bottles vinegar. Slice
mangoes, seeds and all, cut up onions and

How to remove the shine from a nearly-new
blue serge suit ? —7823.
Lay the suit out on a table, wring out a
woollen cloth in very hot water, place it over
the shiny parts for a few moments, then brush
well to restore the roughness of the serge.
Chemicals are no use.
How is chewing-gum made? —7916.
The basis of all chewing-gums is gum chicle.
There are many recipes, the following being a
good general formula: Assemble 122 parts gum
chicle, 42 parts paraffin wax, 4 parts balsam
of tolu, 384 parts sugar, 48 parts water. Dis-
solve the sugar in the water by the aid of heat,
and pour the resultant syrup out on an oiled
slab. Melt the gum, balsam and paraffin
together, and pour on top of the syrup; then
work the whole up together. Flavor as desired.
Best means of killing the moss on flowering
shrubs and trees, especially azaleas ? —7909.
Use kerosene emulsion (|lb. shredded soap,
2 gals, kerosene, 1 gal. boiling water, mixed
well together) at the rate of 1 part emulsion
to 20 of water; or, if more convenient, with
Black Leaf 40 (trade strength) or lime-sulphur
(trade strength). Apply to the trees with a
brush or cloth attached to a long handle.
Choose dry weather for the treatment and do
not water the shrubs for at least 14 days.
How is oil of lavender made ? —7958.
Almost fill a large bottle with lavender tops,
add enough spirits of wine to fill the bottle;
cork and leave in a warm place six to eight
weeks. Strain the oil, which will float on top
of the spirit, into a clean bottle. One table-
spoon of this oil in 4oz. of water makes a
g’ood perfume.
How is canvas prepared for painting in oils ?
—7718.
Damp the canvas and stretch it on a board
or frame. When dry. singe off knots and give
three coats of thin size prepared from parch-
ment scrapings or best glue. Prime with white
lead, using as little raw linseed as possible.
Rub the lead well into the grain. Two coats
are advisable, with two months’ interval between.
(1) Recipe for a preparation for transferring
newspaper illustrations to plain paper ? (2) How
to make the paper to which the transfer is
applied transparent, so that the transfer can be
seen right way up ? —7576.
(1) Dissolve one tablespoon of common yel-
low soap in a pint of boiling water. Allow to
cool, then add three tablespoons of pure tur-
pentine. and shake well together. This is the
transfer solution ready for use. With a small
brush, or wool pad, apply freely to surface of
picture to be transferred, and allow to soak
in while damping the paper which is to receive
the print. Next place the picture upon this
paper and apply moderate pressure over the
entire surface with a smooth surface as the
back of a spoon. (2) Mctke a solution With
equal parts of liquid spirit, soap, turpentine, and
amyl acetate. Apply to the paper.

« H! OH! my back—it’s nearly breaking! I can’t get straight again
■ H once I stoop down. It seems just as though an iron hand is
V B gripping me, wrenching the muscles, making me just sick with
pain. ...” That is the daily story of a host of people just crippled
with pain. Thousands of women—and men, too —suffer for years
with chronic pains in the back, and believe it is due to sudden cold, a chill or
too much work or fatigue. As a matter of fact, the stabbing, weakening,
lowering backache, that dreadful down-dragging weakness is almost certainly
due to hidden kidney trouble.
There are thousands of men and women suffering daily “untold agonies”
because of kidney trouble in one form or another. It is no use doping the system
with drugs. The only possible means of ending your trouble is to cleanse the
body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys must carry out.
It is the testimony of not one but thousands of one-time -sufferers, backed
by our own 40 years’ experience, which enables us to state that if you will
commence a course with a simple straightforward remedy, De Witt's Kidney
and Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be ended.
In 24 hours you will see results. Persevere and your pain goes for good.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why continue in constant nerve-destroying
pain? Why be weak and ailing when you can, at such little cost, start once
again building up full vigour and vitality?
No extravagant claims are made for these pills. They do not represent a
cure-all, craze-of-the-moment find. Solid testimony proves their efficacy in all
complaints which
are caused by weak
or sluggish kidneys,
especially backache,
rheumatism, bladder
trouble and general
weakness.

“Raeakiaki”: Railway freight-rates?
A friend bought a kid’s scooter for a
quid in Melbourne, and proposed to
send it by rail to Perth. Cost: just the
level quid. The scooter’s still in Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
“Cockychaff”: Our N.S.W. town had
five general stores. A chain-store co.
opened its 26th branch in the place, and
now there’s only one of the five stores
left. A “cash-and-carry” has started ; it
and the chain-store are fighting it out.
* * * *
“Bundook”: The married woman who
does a deserving single girl out of a job
(B. 30/8/’33) is no meaner than the
“society” mannequin who shoulders out
the showroom girl. I suppose it is
just another diversion to relieve ennui,
but it is rough on young women who
really have to work for their living.
* * * *
“Taster”: A tea importer told an
interviewer that Australians drink the
worst tea in the world. One reason for
this is the public demand for a fairly
cheap tea, plus the infernal taxation,
which works out at 7d. to Bd. a pound-
primage l|d., sales tax the same and
customs duty 4d. To this must be added
exchange ; in the case of Java tea, it
runs up to 45 p.c. With those hurdles
blenders are forced to reduce quality or
go out of business.
* * ;Jc
“Black Swan”: A poultry-breeder in
Westralia imported some stud fowls
from England. He was assured that they
would be free of duty, but was charged
primage duty and sales tax, though the
schedule of exemptions to the Sales Tax
Act, No. 5, includes “stud livestock which
the Commissioner is satisfied is imported
for stud purposes.” The victim protested
to the State Agricultural Department.
He was referred to the Department of
Commerce, which said the matter was
one for the Treasury. The Treasury did
not bother, but a wire came from the
Acting-Commissioner of Taxation con-
firming the local ruling.

Comparative unemployment figures
for the early months of 1932 and 1933
issued by the International Labor Office
suggest that, if there has been a world-
improvement in conditions, it must have
been very recent. Out of 33 countries
listed, only three show a decline in un-
employment—Germany, Canada and
Poland. The Irish Free State shows an
increase in out-of-works equal to 199
per cent, over last year’s figures for
February, and quite a number showed
20 per cent, to 116 per cent.
* * * *
“T.P.”: That bill introduced in the
Queensland Parliament by Attorney-
General Mullan (B. 13/9/’33) enacts that
buyers under hire-purchase agreements
have an equity in the goods equivalent
to the proportion of the purchase-price
paid. Owners of goods repossessed and
subsequently sold or rehired must render
an account to dispossessed part-pur-
chasers and pay to them amounts aris-
ing out of new transactions in excess of
the money due. The legislation applies
to purchases of goods and chattels, but
not of land or houses.
* * * $
“E.M.H.”: Much as I admire the
C.S.I.R. I am afraid it is issuing
pamphlets which are sheer waste. Pam-
phlet 42, for instance: 55 pages of
meteorological figures set out in a way
which not one elector in seven could
follow. Then the language—in pam-
phlet, No. 43, for example:
Lyperosia exigua reacts to a light stimulus
with movement to the source of light, and thus
displays a positive phototaxis can orient
itself thigmotactically... .at higher temperatures
become negatively thermotactic.
A few pages of this is enough to give
anybody buffalo-fly, but cowpunchers of
the North will be glad to learn that
Howlett induced Stomoxys to oviposit on
cotton-wool soaked in valerianic acid and that
the Sarcophaga will lay eggs in a glass con-
taining skatol.

From H. J. Ridley, grand secretary of
the G.U.0.0.F.:
That par. (B. 6/9/’33) respecting a voluntary
scheme of insurance for medical benefits in
Queensland and Victoria mentions that the
friendly societies and the Queensland Gov-
ernment are objecting. Without questioning
the right of an insurance co. to enter into this
line of business, and of doctors to co-operate,
friendly societies surely have some claim for
prior consideration. After all they are non-
profit-making institutions. The claim applies
equally to their medical service as to their sick
and funeral benefits; a member’s medical fee
is paid wholly to the profession. Insurance
cos., other than mutual concerns, are hardly
likely to give any benefits without a corres-
ponding profit.

very tame.... J.C.S.: Your sketch tastes like

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
As you con this Letter you’ll be nearly
smothered with confetti. Throughout
city and suburbs bells have pealed, tulle
veils have billowed, and, let’s hope, the
garnering of wedding fees has been in
proportion to the wedding finery.
R. C. Hagon, second of Sydney’s Lud
Mayors to give a daughter away in wed-
lock while still the gauds of office
wreathe the aldermanic vest, armed his
Margaret, tall and dazzlingly fair in her
slinky white laces, up the aisle of St.
Mark’s at Darling Point. White azaleas
and hyacinths tied with white velvet rib-
bons breathed beauty to the old, tired
pews that once themselves had felt the
sap of spring in their veins, along the
aisle pedestal baskets brimmed over with
snowy stocks and camellias to hail the
bride, while a drift of white fruit-blos-
som was banked about the chancel and
the pulpit. Mrs. Roy Furley (Mar-
garet’s sister), Beryl Collins (’groom’s
sister), Caroline Raby Moore and bride’s
cousins Betty and little Nanette Hagon,
white-clad from hat to toe, followed the
star performer like so many pearls on a
string. For flowers, Margaret carried a
thick chain of lily-of-the-valley, while
armlets of white fruit-blossom and cycla-
men swayed against the lacquered chif-
fons of her. retinue. Padre F. T. Perkins
forged the link that binds, and former
Brisbaneite Jerry Bannister stood by
John Collins, the ’groom from Queens-
land. Congratulations were allied to
champagne at Leswell, the Hagons’
Edgecliff home, and here the civic hostess
stood up well to the spotlight in wide-
brimmed millinery and a frock of grey
chiffons patterned in white and black.
Mrs. Dudley Persse (another of John's
sisters) and her husband came from
Queensland for the festivity ; her wed-
ding garment of white-and-red patterned
crepe was worn with a black hat. The
John Collins pair sailed for England by
the Orama on Saturday.
Sooner or later, the Bushland Exhibi-
tion at David Jones’s drew everybody ;
after the first visit you felt you must pay
a second one, until in the end abo.
brothers, crouched under their little gun-
yah on the floor of the hall, must have
become very hot and bothered. If they
had ever heard of Kipling’s “Boots” they
must have entered right into the spirit of
T. Atkins, for their lowly outlook was
one of boots, boots, boots! Slippers
moulded of sea-shells and sand, too,
made up a popular part of their stock-
in-trade.
The Bush had come to the City.
Her army of red-coated waratahs had
marched into its heart like conquerors.
Here blushed the little native rose, there
the tall bulrush stood graceful and lithe,
while over all blew the scent of boronia
and wild mignonette. Even the experi-
enced bush observer in charge of the girl
helpers was thrilled over this last and
rare arrival, which hailed from Croydon
Park. Shy creeping and winged things
(living or mummied) peered at the
visitor with shining eyes. Here were
native bear and lyrebird, kookaburra,
’roos, parrots and small birds all blue
and gold. The walls were hung with
pictures of tall trees and ferny tracks,
mountain paths and cool deep pools.
The trees, showing they could be turned
to practical uses, gleamed in small
polished panels of walnut, rosewood, oak,
blackwood, carabeen and a dozen other
suave beauties. The Rangers’ League
arranged the exhibition.
The Crown-street Women’s Hospital
netted 66 per cent, of the takings on the
first day of Farmer’s Mannequin Show.
The Gordon and Bavin ladies and Mrs.
Victor White acted as hostesses at the
tea session, and Chief Justice Harvey’s
lady supplied the social gilt to the lunch-
hour crust. Lady Isaacs, Perth’s Mrs.
Arnold Woolfe and the Waley lady were
a group of three handsome matrons who
arrived for a dish of tea. A bunch of
social amateurs took the stage with the
assured complacency of youth when it
' S doin ° something it likes and at the
same time laying up treasure in Heaven.
Fourteen girls ushered the hundreds of
women determined to get a ringside
view of the gambollings of spring
fashions.
Mannequins, sleek as seals in black
lacquered satin, even to gloves, floated
along; but there is danger in this shiny-
surfaced material for the home dress-
maker. , f the hand of the potter slips>

yG ur organdie must be taffeta-lined, have
a finely-pleated berthe, double-ruffled
s | ee ves and a snug-fitting waistline
finished off with a swagger bow. The
papier machd masks modelled by Don
Finley and sculptress Barbara Tribe into
t h e likenesses of Constance Bennett,
Anne Harding, Dolores Del Rio and
suc h well-known film beauties caused a
buzz of comment. Face, hair and hat
wer e modelled of one piece; the man-
nequin drew them on like a helmet and

bobbed a curtsey last week were Mrs.

Poppies gleamed golden when West-
ralians in Sydney lunched Mrs. Risch-
beith, president of the Australian Fed-
eration of Women Voters. Mrs. Risch-
beith, good-looking and smartly dressed,
struck a warning note on the secession
danger. Personally, this Letter would
hate any rift in the lute between us and
the West, which produces such an ami-
able group of women as those at Tues-
day’s lunch, every one of whom had a
mouth that curled to smiles and dimples
deep enough to drown all the troubles
of the world. Senator Kingsmill’s lady,
her trig figure folded in a royal-blue coat
collared in squirrel, presided; Mrs.
Goodison and Mrs. Foster Mattei helped
with the speeches. Other Perth guests
were Mrs. R. A. Lawrence, daughter
Hazel and Betty Rowe, of Perth’s Little
Theatre.
If the great Australian play comes
from Perth, Betty Rowe will deserve
some of the blame. She has been en-
couraging the local playwright with com-
petitions for one-act and three-act plays,
and then actually producing the winners
in her Little Theatre. Betty, who away
from the footlights is Mrs. Arthur Miles,
started the Little Theatre movement in
Perth, and in addition she has written
with Winifred Dickinson two successful
musical comedies, “The Dutch Kitchen”
and “Yours Unfaithfully.” So successful
was the first that a professional company
bought the rights for one week’s run.
Betty, who is being feted by the amateur
groups in Sydney, paid The Bulletin
camera a visit last week.
The lads and lasses from the nine big-
gest stores that link Central-square to
Broadway did their bit to help Prince
Alfred’s by turning up, 2000 strong and
gay, to their Carnival Ball. The Town
Hall was canopied in blue and gold
streamers, and here and there bunches of
red and green and blue balloons bobbed
and bubbled. People wore masks, but did
so with a note of individuality. Some
wore them in the conventional way,
others arranged them so that they hung
from the ear down to the shoulder, others
again carried them in the hand.
There was a pageant, dressed and pro-
duced in dazzling style. There was a
group of girls whose skirts resembled a
clock-face with the hands pointing to
nine. They drew a tower whereon the
slogan “Nine Till Twelve” was flashed in
electrics, and they represented nine-till-
noon bargains. Then there was the
arrival of Spring at a big store ; a girl
in peach blossom pink organdie, her hat
starry with flowers, • was the centre of
this group. Followed a Cocktail party,
preceded by a very complete bar pushed
by a crimson-clad Mephisto. On the bar,
long, slim legs dangling, sat a girl in
palest green; also in this company
walked girls costumed as cocktail glasses.
There were Broadway stars, a “Lohen-
grin” set and a bewildering procession,
to the presentment of which the girls
and boys from the stores must have given
a great deal of their spare time and
money.
Violet Roche added her music party
to the fashionable scheme and snared no
less a musician than Teddy Cahill. The
pianist, who has played for all the Royal-
ties and hopes to go back to London to
play for them again, gave a programme
that ranged through Beethoven, Chopin,
Brahms, Schumann and the Russian
moderns, and finished up with Percy
Grainger. Old friends the Roystone
Daveys (she wrapped in ermine) and
Mrs. Langridge, from Melbourne, were
among the listeners ; so were Alexander
Gordon’s lady, in grey lace, Mrs. Rhodes,
the George Nassoors, Mrs. Wunderlich,
the Lashmars, Dora Payter, Adrian Ash-
ton, Doris Fitton with husband, “Tug”
Mason and Ella Shields, in a rose-red
velvet frock.
Lovely Pauline McDonald, one of the
year’s frequent bridesmaids, took a star
part last Thursday, when she married
Dick Allen. Pauline is a daughter of
Mrs. Fraser McDonald and the late
F. McDonald, and on her mother’s
side she’s one of the Bathurst McPhil-
lamy clan. Dick is the only son of the
legal Herbert Allens, of Woollahra.
Ivory satin sprayed with crystalline em-
broideries shimmered as this brunette
bride walked the pink-flowered aisle of
St. Mark’s. Carefully pacing behind her
six yards of train came Elizabeth Friend,
Anne Gordon, Barbara Warry and
Pamela Osborne. The back of their pink
frocks was even more important than
the front, and finished off in a frisky little
train. Their baby wreaths of flat
flowers, worn slanted over the right eye-
brow and finished off in a perky high-
standing bow towards the back, had a
jaunty Watteau Shepherdess air. The
Leslie Dunlops’ Moira and the Noel
Heaths’ Peter, in white satin, were two
small Millais-like items of the procession.
Claude Reading squired Pauline to the
altar, Pat Rothe was best man, and
Bishop Crotty brought his crook down
from Bathurst to give the knot an extra
curl. The Hubert Fairfaxes lent Elaine,
their Double Bay home, for the revelry.
Mrs. McDonald’s frocking was a com-
position in brown, with high lights of
orchids.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite is dis-
appointed that the Town Hall didn’t
fly a wreath of orange-blossom from a
Venetian mast when Margaret Hagon
was married. As 'a matter of cold fact,
it was business as usual at the seat of
civic government; disgruntled citizens
rushed in to pay rates and electric-light
bills, and there weren’t even drinks on
the house. No presents of gold- or
silverplate from the Corporation will
adorn the Collins gunyah. However,
John gave his bride a travelling-case so
crusted with gold that it might be
labelled “a day in Kalgoorlie,” and Mrs.
Hagon handed her daughter a brooch
that represents a pretty week’s profits to
Hatton Garden.
There’s an air of mystery about every-
thing that happens in “Road House’’
(the Criterion thriller), and not the least
bewildering question that presents itself
is why the lady in the white bathing
costume should shade herself under a
pink sunshade when she goes out into
the garden at an hour which is empha-
sised again and again as 7.30 in the even-
ing. Even with the most slowly-setting sun,
a brolly at that hour seems superfluous.
At many an arty-crafty party these
nights slim maidens arrive with a flat,
round paper parcel under the arm. These
are dance —but not jazz—records. In
fact, strictly speaking, they’re not dance
tunes. They are the most intense bits of
Tschaikowsky, Grieg and suchlike com-
posers, and to their strains, when the
party gets really gay, the dancers, equally
intense-looking, in flowing raiment
(sometimes sable of hue), will interpret
such jolly themes as suicide, death, fear.
At other times they might be trees in
the spring, a flower in the breeze.
There’s not so much footwork in this
dancing; it is based on body rhythm,
and certainly its exponents seem to walk
in grace. They develop an elastic spine,
a tapering w'aist and a marked absence
of little Mary. It is known as the Ger-
man school.
Louis Becke’s widow and daughter
Niya, who left Sydney nearly nine years
ago and have since been hobnobbing
with literary celebrities in London, were
lunched by the Women Writers last week.
The two, glowing with health, told ot
friendship with Mrs. Alec Tweedie,
who in her youth was a mighty hunter
of out-of-the-way places, and made a
more than comfortable living by writ-
ing of them. Kipling, too, and the late
Conan Doyle were intimates of Mrs.
Becke and her youngest daughter. An-
other daughter, Mrs. Samuels, lives at
Palm Beach, and her home is the present
address of the newly-returned travellers.
It seems as though Australia is really
beginning to look upon opera as some-
thing the home-grown voice can sing.
There are now 26 operas being studied
and rehearsed keenly by boy and girl
singers in the city, and these will get
their chance over the air when the Broad-
casting Commission’s opera season com-
mences in a few weeks’ time.

Moonee Valley Racing Club celebrated
its 50th birthday with special racebooks
and a good rally of supporters. The
row of blowing daffodils in front of
the v.-r. cubby-hole made a lone streak
of color among sombre dressing. The
little stand with the steam-heaters was
so snug that some of its patrons wouldn’t
move to make a bet. The Luxton lady
chose a diminutive hat with her tailored
black coat. Mrs. Ross Grey-Smith did
her punting in flecked blue tweeds. Dr.
Lorna Bray, in her white rainproof,
dared the weather to do its worst. Mrs.
Purves-Smith wore black and violets.
Mrs. Ben Chaffey had a posy of violets
and a green hat diagonally striped with
black. Mrs. Dimelow rejoiced over the
wad that came from her little flutter on
La Vante. Among tweeds and woollens
a girl all in black, velvet suit, satin
blouse and small piece of millinery, was
noticeable. Many of the young things
wore the newest caps with flapjack tops
—knitted trifles that can be used at a
pinch for tea cosies.
The Show is almost upon us. Animals
are meekly submitting to comb, brush
and manicure, and next week will stolidly
chew their fodder under the judge’s eagle
eye. Wine experts are peering into
vintages of ruby or amber hue, keeping
between sips their palates cleansed with
olives. Women’s exhibits are rolling in
en masse. Some beautiful needlework
executed by masculine fingers was re-
fused admission—which gives birth to a
scandalous theory that the ladies are
frightened of being beaten at their own
game.
Officers of the 58th Battalion swooped
upon Shepparton for their hop. The
gallant army men flashed Robin Red-
breasts, much braid and a jingle of
medals, the Drill Hall reflecting their
glory in a veiling of the battalion’s colors.
Major and Mrs. Hill and Captain and
Mrs. Rule presented guests to the Mayor
and his daughter-in-law, deputy Mayoress
for the evening. Dainty programmes
were distributed and wrought some
havoc among cigarettes, for they were
perfumed, and shared their fragrance
with the usual contents of men’s pockets.
Mrs. Hill wore cornflower-blue; Mrs.
Rule’s white satin showed a flowered
ruffle ; Mrs. Tackaberry’s choice lit upon
olive-green, and Mrs. Barrett was in
floral blue ninon, over which was a wrap
with the modish shoulder line.
Wives of Labor members of Parlia-
ment remembered that there’s a social
side to political life and staged a hop at
the Trades Hall, which became a whirl
of balloons and streamers. Supper was
extra-special. Mrs. Tunnecliffe, in ame-
thyst lace, kept her shoulders warm with
a velvet capelet. Jean Daley carried on
her organising in black. Mrs. Disney and
Mrs. McNamara were among the
hostesses.
The weather imp was pleased at the
laying of a new foundation-stone, for
the sun shone serenely all the afternoon.
The ceremony, which is a prelude to the
building of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian
Hospital, took place in Grey-street, East
Melbourne, with Meenister Cameron
officiating. Flags and bunting blew over
the footpath, and the paddock within,
doomed to a messy period of bricks and
mortar, showed a mushroom growth of
chairs and covered-in platform. Girls
from the Hostel made tea for the guests,
and Mary McArthur produced posies for
the Argyle lady, Mrs. Neville, Mrs.
David Mackie, Mrs. Macaulay and Miss
Cameron.
Nan Ffrost and R. V. Tuckett kept an
evening appointment in Melbourne
Grammar School chapel. Dr. Ffrost
escorted his daughter, a slender vision in
camellia-tinted satin and foam of tulle.
Her gown was cut with a high neckline,
atwinkle with crystal, long sleeves, swirl-
ing above the elbow, and an all-in-one
train. A trail of blossom swung from
the leaves of the cream-morocco-bound
prayer-book which her mother had car-
ried at her wedding. Afterwards the
bride’s parents entertained relatives and
friends at dinner.
Yvonne Keon-Cohen and Alexander
Lawrence Rentoul spoke their marriage
vows in Scots Church. The bride’s vel-
vet raiment swung in a long train, over
which fell a floating wraith of tulle veil.
The pink of her perfumed sheaf of roses
was echoed by the coronet in her hair.
Small Ann Whitaker, in her first long
dress, preceded the bride up the aisle.
She wore rosebuds in her hair, and her
posy of wee blossoms was pressed tightly
against a white velvet frock.
Margot Mary, daughter of the Oscar
Lemprieres, has promised her heart
and hand to Archibald, son of Mr. and
Mrs. H. Turner, of Sandringham.
Elizabeth, younger daughter of medico
and Mrs. Hobill Cole, becomes a bride
on October 25. Bridegroom-elect is Wil-
fred Ferrier a’Beckett. Belfry of Christ
Church, South Yarra, will send out its
merriest peals.
The Arm of the Law is controlling the
rush upon the Lord Mayor’s visiting-
book. On the day Gengoult Smith re-
turned from his cruise to the tropics he
announced that the Mayoral Ball cer-
tainly would take place. There is a limit
to the floorspace of the Town Hall’s
largest chamber, and disappointment is in
store for hundreds of worthy citizens
who neglected to add to their signatures
those of grandparents or flocks of just-
grown-up children.
The handsome young man who pro-
vides the meat of this sandwich is Dr.
Allan Vickers, who does running repairs
to broken bones and other bodily ills
for the population of an area the size
of N.S.W. The maintaining of a flying
doctor at Cloncurry, thus throwing a
mantle of safety over Central Queens-
land, is part of the Australian Inland
Mission’s fine work. The A.I.M. owns
a radio transmitting station at Clon-
curry, and scattered in the wide sur-
rounding district are 30 “pedal” stations.
Upon these instruments settlers in dis-
tress can send messages by tapping a
keyboard resembling a typewriter which
automatically operates in Morse. This
invention is the product of much patient
research. Dr. Vickers, with his skill and
good cheer and a Qantas ’plane always
at his disposal, is a mighty good friend
to the hardy inlanders.
This week the A.I.M. celebrates its
21st birthday. As well as maintaining a
flying doctor since 1928, the mission,
which is controlled by the Kirk, runs a
dozen bush hospitals. “Flynn of the
Inland” has compiled a chart of Aus-
tralia wherein hospitals with and without
medicoes are marked with red stars,
“pedal” radios with other red marks, and
the great area served with a bold border.
A glance at the map gives an idea of the
loneliness which surrounds the Florence
Nightingales. Heat, dust and flies are
all in the game, but a cheery smile and
a box of books do marvels. Alice
Springs looks desolate enough, but it is
a city compared with some of the
stations. At a fete there recently in the
interest of the A.I.M. £250 was raised.
With wedding presents and trousseau
neatly packed with straw or lavender,
Molly Wall sailed off on the Strathaird.
Armed with wedding ring and license,
Dr. J. J. Phelan awaits her in the Cold
Country.
The “Twenty Artists” were at home
in the Athenaeum Gallery, which is like
Dante’s magic box. It must have false
sides, for it persisted in accepting and
disgorging crowds of people who could
never have been fitted into its small in-
terior. However, no one was killed or
even seriously squashed. With a back-
ground of grand piano, Prof. Osborne
made the opening speech.
With Mrs. T. J. Ryan and Mrs. J. J.
Daly at the dual controls, tea, chatter
and good-byes were served at the Wind-
sor for Rita Miller, who will have a
reminder “from her Melbourne friends”
every time she glances at her new wrist-
watch. She chose black with a dash of
white for her suit and sailor hat tilted
at a saucy angle ; both hostesses were
also followers of the fashionable magpie
combination. Miss Miller warbled
sweetly, David Sisserman played his
’cello, and Raymond Lambert, as accom-
panist, had the services of Tapia-Cabal-
iero as page-turner. The young senor is
also a passenger on the Moreton Bay.
Pictured here is Clyde, only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Merry, who be-
came the life partner of Major M. C.
Langslow at St. Andrew’s, Middle
Brighton. The bridal satins of delicate
shell-pink, against which nestled a spray
of white almond-blossom, were draped
upon neckline and sleeve and puffed
over with a veil of palest pink tulle.
Marjorie Stoddart and Alison Fox, the
latter in deeper pink georgettes than
the former, chose hats of oatmeal-
tinted organdie and sprays of flowering
peach. Guests were entertained by the
bride’s parents at the Windsor, where
reception- and dining-room took the
breath away with their glory of flowers.
After the dinner party a three-tiered
pink cake sped the couple under a
shower of confetti. The ’moon rises in
Maoriland.
“Music in the Air,” at the Royal,
opened to a packed house. The femi-
nine element in the audience visions itself
a-swaggering in Sylvia Welling’s wide-
shouldered cream coat or being seductive
in her confection of a negligee. All the
leading lights had flowers and chocs,
among final curtains. Speeches were
brief. Miss Welling said she didn’t
expect to make a speech ; but what about
Carrie Moore? Carrie said she was
thrilled to be back in Melbourne ; and
here was producer Frederick Blackman.
His bit was: “Please keep your seats for
the flashlight.”
Flowers are scarce just now and
florists are making liberal use of paper
to eke out their wares. Tea-tree foliage
is prinked up with tiny bits of colored
tissue in a sort of wild heath fashion.
The stuff has one advantage over native
heath ; it can be obtained in any hue.
Perth records merry occasions:
Kalgoorlie’s race week gave opportunities for
many parties. Betty Mayman, Jean Drum-
mond and Cora Kennedy-Smith donned checked
skirts and white bonnets to give a Dutch Dance
in the Boulder Parish Hall, where the menfolk
appeared in patched baggy breeches and blouses.
Mrs. R. R. Gibbs’s dance was held in her lan-
tern-lit Kalgoorlie home. The Marmions,
Patons and Dr. and Mrs. Bridgeford were
among the local guests, and the Winterbottoms,
Norries and Saloms were in the crowd that
went from the city.
The Embassy Cabaret absorbed hundreds of
C-T.A. members and friends for the travellers’
ball. President H. M. Manning brought his
wife, who wore coral-pink lace with a per-
simmon satin coatee and carried a presentation
posy of daffodils. Secretary Launder’s wife
sported a Burgundy gown with a yoke of white-
and-wine figured georgette. A sequin cape
sparkled above Mrs. J. Armstrong’s opal
satins; Peggy Walsh danced in pastel floral
taffetas, and Mercia Martin in cornflower-blue
crushed velvet.
Danny McKinnon has drafted a matrimonial
agreement with Angie, fourth daughter of the
Robert Bunnings, of Cottesloe, stipulating an
early date for ratification.
Paradoxically a rosy blush suffused the colon-
nades of Winthrop Hall for the Uni.’s Blue
Ball. St. George’s Warden, Rev. C. B. Law,
handed over blues to sporting students before
they trekked to the Iceland-poppy-decked refec-
tory for supper. Nancy Ward was there with
a black chiffon velvet cape flung over primrose
crinkle crepe; “Ike” Broadfoot matched her
eyes with Egyptian-blue chiffons; Dorothy
Howe splashed beach-sand lace on her black
satin; silver beads shimmered on Phyllis
O’Brien’s hyacinth georgettes; Rae McClintock’s
ninons displayed designs in green and brown;
Iris Smith exhibited voluminous autumn-tinted
checked organdie. Stephanie Feltman booked
dances in sunflower velvet; Dorothy McClemens
and Ainslie Rae tripped blithely in white crinkle
crepe.
Carrickmacross lace veiled Joan Newbury’s
curd-white bouffant-sleeved satins when she fol-
lowed the choir-boys down the aisle of St.
Mary’s, where Tony Taylor stood awaiting. At
the rear of the cavalcade were Mollies New-
bury and Taylor and Yvonne Renou, a sym-
metrical trio in backless delphinium blue, with
slashed sleeves and trains. Bouquets of white
camellias matched their rakish pancake hats.
C.B.C. Old Boys festooned the Embassy with
premier pennants and red, black and green
streamers, and piled the supper tables with
daffodils for their dance. Dr. Horan headed
the committee of 30 responsible for the doings.
The college matron, Mrs. Lee, was softly draped
in black chiffon velvet, a furbishing chosen also
by Miss Curlewis, Kath Connaughton and Leith
Harford. Pat Ahern paraded waterwave-striped
marocain of marble delineation; Joan Rossiter
was decorous in banksia lace; Nell Smith’s
white crSpe was set about with snowy organdie;
and Dorothy Baker’s floral ninons were a darker
green than Doreen D’Arcy’s fluted lime
organdies.
Eric Donald marshalled 350 figures on the
stage of His Majesty’s for the “Australia’s
Part” pageant. Mrs. H. Braine, in trailing
white satin with crimson drapings and a glit-
tering rising-sun headpiece, represented the
Commonwealth, and six queens, each with a
retinue of 30, bore along their spoils. Max
Rutter’s choir of a hundred did him credit and
Mr. Otto’s baton led the C.T.A. Orchestra.
Mrs. R. J. Rex was organiser.
The Speck has a word or two to say:
Everybody is pleased at the official appoint-
ment of knight Elliott Lewis as Lieut.-Gov-
ernor. He has a fine record of public service,
and is the Grand Old Man of Tassie’s political
and public life. His lady is sociable and
energetic.
The small community of Cygnet rose to a
great occasion and evolved a municipal ball.
His Ex. and Lady Clark motored down to the
function, with Capt. Matheson in attendance.
Warden Davies and daughter Mary did the
honors. The stage was fixed up as a lounge,
with Oriental decorations and drapings.
Launceston Players scored a success with
Siegfried Geyer’s “By Candlelight,” a bright
little comedy that was presented with plenty
of sparkle. Mrs. P. O. Fysh, as the mas-
querading maid, was delightful, and Dr. Hol-
man, as Bastien the valet, could hardly have
been bettered. The setting was artistic.
Dr. and Mrs. Ramsay gave three small
dances in succession at their Launceston home
—one for daughter Margaret, one for son
Hugh and a third for older folk. All three
were cheery affairs.
Vice-Admiral Alister Beal and his wife are
booked to visit the Speck in November. Mrs.
Beal* is a sister of the Elliott Lewis lady.
Adelaide’s social affairs:
Country visitors to the Show were well
catered for. The bigger drapers staged manne-
quin parades of spring fashions in the morn-
ings. One firm got the girls from “Tout Paris”
to act as mannequins.
The Freemasons’ Hall was the scene of a
dance in aid of Masonic charities. Lady Hore-
Ruthven was there in sapphire-blue satin, the
corsage of pervenche blue. Mrs. Mellis Napier
was gowned in pale lettuce-green ring velvet,
and Mrs. Andrew Young’s parchment-toned
chiffon velvet was trimmed with opalescent
sequins.
There was a big crowd at the Town Hall for
the Old World concert, organised to give Miriam
Hyde another year’s study in London. The
stage was in two tiers, the upper arranged as
an eighteenth-century drawing-room, and the
lower as a garden. Mrs. Frank Harcus was
responsible for the conversion of the latter,
and very beautiful it looked when the 16 girls
in early-Victorian frocks danced among the
daffodils. The upper tier was furnished in gold,
and Mrs. H. B. W. Wynyard, in mauve bro-
cade and hair poudre, received as guests those
who took part in the concert. The Hon. Mrs.
Dudley Ryder, a visitor from England, in gold
brocade, was the violinist of the concert party,
which included Mrs. Lavington Bonython, in
flame-and-gold-shot taffeta, and Mrs. Compton
Trew, in pale blue and silver.
The Uni. Women’s Union gave a dance and
bridge party in the refectory, when about 200
were present. The acting hostesses were
Madeline Angel (president), in green-and-white- -
striped organdie, and Gladwys Pank, in powder
crinkled crepe. Several profs, brought their
wives.
Walford House old scholars gave a cheery
cabaret dance at the schoolhouse, when the
headmistress (Miss M. Baker) and the president
(Mrs. Alex. Burnard) received the guests.
Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson and daughter
Yvonne have been living in a whirl of parties
prior to their departure from England. They
were given a farewell dinner at the London
Musical Club, when several Adelaide folk were
among the guests.

AUTUMN IN JAPAN
The Autumn season —September to
November—is a fascinating time. The
weather is ideal, crisp and clear and
the countryside is a mass of variegated
colors —Maples and Copper Beeches
in their red and golden tints, and
gorgeous Chrysanthemums everywhere.
In addition to these natural charms,
the Australian £, owing to the low
exchange, is worth 25/- in Japan.
Tourists can secure the advantage of
this in their purchases of Silks, Curios,
etc., and their travelling expenses
ashore.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Mick Man”: Tell “Indcar” (B.
6/9/’33) it takes a Welshman to do the
word “eisteddfod” justice. Roughly, the
proper pronunciation should be something
like “u-stath-vuth,” as nearly as it can
be conveyed in writing. “Eisteddfod” is
a beautiful word on the lips of a Leek-
lander ; on most others it sounds like a
slow asthmatic sneeze.
“Whateffer”: Pronunciation of “eistedd-
fod”? The nearest an Englishman can
get to it is “ ’st’thv’d,” giving the th its
soft sound as in “with,” or, if you would
be pedantic, “eye-steth-vod.” It means
merely a session (root-word, “sit”), no-
thing to do with music per se. But why
not call it a musical competition and
have done with the tongue-twister?
* * * *
“Ex-Sahib”: Malabar is far from
being “the blackest coast in Asia” (B.
6/9/’33); I should call it one of the
whitest. The Malayarli people are
noted for their fair skins, and every-
thing about the coast bears a most
cleanly appearance, in sharp contrast to
what one leaves behind on a journey
overnight from Madras. I have come
in contact with only one handsomer
people than the Malayarlis, and those
are the Polynesians.
* * * *
“Henry Only”: The only “her
Majesty” title in the British Empire offi-
cially recognised by Downing-street, ex-
cept Mary of England, is Queen Salote,
ruling Tonga and the other 200 isles of
the Friendly group. Salote is a hand-
some woman, six feet high, and is very
capable. It is largely owing to her con-
trol that the happy Friendlys have no
public debt, no unemployment and no
depression. One of her latest measures
is to deal with cheap Asiatic labor under-
cutting her own workers.
* * * *
“Magis”: English is a queer language.
A recent cable reported that 100,000
Chinese assembled at Shanghai to wit-
ness the “christening” of five out of
40 bombing ’planes purchased from the
U.S. by public subscription. It would be
difficult for even G. K. Chesterton to
invent a choicer paradox than a crowd
of heathen Chinese invoking the benedic-
tion of the Prince of Peace, who
preached non-resistance to evil, on the
most destructive machines imaginable,
built by Christian Americans so mat the
buyers might avenge Chapei on Japanese
Shintoists and Buddhists. But probably
all Ah Sin did was to let off a packet
of crackers.
* * * #
“Ananias Walton”: Britain recently
detained an unusual visitor —a sturgeon
9ft. long and weighing 3881 b. This was
gaffed by a man fishing for salmon in
a South Wales river. The cable doesn’t
say what became of the catch. The
sturgeon is a royal fish, and all caught
in the kingdom have been the perquisite
of the King since a time whereof the
memory of man runneth not to the con-
trary, though the Constable of the Tower
has a right to all salmon and sturgeon
between his charge and London Bridge
It would be interesting to know how
many centuries have passed since the
Crown enforced its claim, or since the
Constable had a claim to enforce.
* * * *
“Qua-hai”: The tray mentioned in B.
13/9/’33, which, through a pressed but-
ton, proclaims the needed cocktail recipe,,
had nothing on an old salt of my
acquaintance. He had the formulae for
his favorite beverages and cures and
stews tattooed about his person, and
when he had acquired a good selection
of them he suddenly won a seventh
share in the Eastern Extension sweep on
the Derby—sufficient to assure that he
would never eat plain lobscouse or curry
or drink a Tom Collins again. His com-
ment on this misfortune was: “Well,
thank Gawd, I ain’t a lady. Fancy goin'
t’ a ball in evenin’ dress with a chit for
a prickly-heat ointment on yer chest!”
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: There have been a
couple of “regrettable incidents” in
county cricket. At the Oval, Surrey,
desirous of putting up a record score
against Yorkshire, refused to close a huge
innings at noon on the last day. So
Verity put every fieldsman, including the
’keeper, on the leg side and bowled
underarms. At Clifton, the Gloucester
bowlers, in order to dodge batting in the
bad light, sent down wides when the
last Lancashire batsmen were at the
wickets. Duckworth settled the matter
by deliberately knocking down his wicket,
compelling Gloucestershire to bat. Many
years ago the same trick was tried in
the Oxford-Cambridge match at sacred
Lord’s, the aim of the bowlers being to
prevent the batting side following on.

Grey of Falloden, dead at 72, was
a typical product of British aristo-
cratic Liberalism, topped off with a Bal-
Hoi training under Jowett. He entered
Parliament at 24. and was in Gladstone s
last Ministry. His Cabinet career was a
paradox. He was a splendid naturalist,
a born fisherman l , a proud Englishman,
so insular in his interests that he rarely
crossed the Channel Col. House called
him “the least-travelled man ol promi-
nence”—and he spoke French of his own
invention which nobody understood. Yet
it wa s his late to be a Foreign Minister,
He served as such in every Liberal Gov-
ernment from Rosebery’s day till 1916,
when failing eyesight forced his retire-
ment. His last term in office was a
record for many moons—ll years to the
day.

“Ruckhni”: “Spring” on the bagpip-
ing McCrimmons (B. 14./9/’33) is wrong
when he says that it merely takes seven
generations to make a piper. It. takes,
in addition, a war or two, some raiding
and lots of usquebaugh. 1 hat is why the
Hieland piper ol to-day is becoming a
tame lad beside the Indian. If you want
to hear really wild piping go to some
border post—say, Dera Ghazi Khan on
the Indus -and listen to the heady
Baluch who has been trained by the .Sea-
forths or Bl&ck. Wutch cxpcincJing his
lungs in the m.oonlight. Or hear the
Gurkhas coming home to Quetta from
guard duty on the road to Loralai. They

“Differential”: Ihe American Auto-
mobile Association has been collating
some facts about motor accidents. In
40 n-»r cent of cases the drivers may
be considered experienced, having been
driving for over a year. Eighty-five per
cent of the accidents occur in clear
weither and in open, dry streets or
roads The heavy traffic hour between
5 and 6 pm is the peak hour for the
minor accidents without fatal results, the
greatest proportion of fatal accidents
occurring a little later, when the streets
are cleanng. Sunday is the worst d a y of
the week for accidents of all kinds, while
drivers under the age of 20 have a 39
per cent, worse average than drivers be-
tween 20 and 30. The unavoidable in-
ference is that the driver who is careful
for his own sake when traffic is heavv
throws discretion to the winds when an
apparently clear go is aheac o ,■ 1

“Mirza Ali” • Where is the farthest-
flung Australian? They seem to be all
over the place Pera has one who is
regarded as the best interpreter in
Asia Minor—Leeper, of Melbourne. An-
other is an unassuming representative
at Smyrna—he was the son of a Bris-
bane Nonconformist parson, and his war
adventures, well authenticated, are
almost a match for those of Lawrence,
The pioneer motor service from Beyrout
to Bagdad is Australasian-run—by
Nairn Bros. ; so is most of the Per-
sian-pilgrim trade from Quasir-i-Shirin
to the coast. The ironist can see a lot
of humor in the spectacle of a red-headed
Ryan, born in Redfern,. packing Mos-
lems into a furniture van with the help
of profane words better known in the
A.I.F. than in Mecca. Modern Persia,
of course, is almost wholly an Austra-
ban creation—it was D’Arcy, of Mt.
Morgan, who established Anglo-Persian
Oil. The farthest-west white officer in
Baluchistan a few years ago was one
of us—from Ipswich, of all places—and
a fter that, travelling eastward. Corn-
stalks are so thick that you have to carry
a lantern at night to avoid falling over

Lord Luvus : A Melbourne daily,
which recently printed a series of articles
that gave Victorians the impression
t he settled part of Papua is popu-
lated a)most entirely by ravening canni .
bals and insatiable head-hunters, has gone
publjshing a
sobstuff story from its Rabaul correspon-
dent about a young Australian who went
t 0 the Territory full of promise and
homely virtue, became infected with the
dryrot of the tropics, embezzled his em-
ployers’ money and then went off into
the bush and shot himself. The moral
drawn was that the white man is morally,
spiritually and physically a weakling who
cannot stand up against the menace ol
the climate for a moment. About the
same time as this precious nonsense
appeared a citizen did exactly the same
thing in Melbourne. No suggestion was
made that the Victorian climate was his
undoing. Melbourne newspapers have
always shown a tendency to magnify the
difficulties of colonising Australian tro-
pics,- whether in New Guinea or on the
continent. A populated North would not
bring much trade to Melbourne.


The Pirate.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
HIS Excellency Captain William
Bligh, R.N., walked up and down
the drawing-room at Government
House, occasionally swearing, and ob-
viously much put out.
“My dear father,” Mrs. Putland had
said as she rose and left the room, carry-
ing her embroidery with her, “if you will
make use of such horrid language, I must
leave my husband to hear it. Why don’t
you pardon the man, and have done with
it? There are here, Heaven knows,
plenty of other poor wretches to hang.”
She went out before her father could
reply. He turned to the pale and emaci-
ated young naval officer sitting on the
sofa by the. window.
“By the Lord, Putland, and why not?
What’s the use of having a prerogative
and not using it? We’ll spare the bos’n.
What if he did take Captain Abbott’s
horse? Who the devil’s Abbott? If they
think I’m going to consent to the death
of a good seaman because he took the
loan of a blasted soldier-officer’s nag,
they’re well mistaken. I’d not hang
him for a Vice-Admiral’s flag”
The sick man on the sofa —he died of
his consumption not long afterwards —
smiled a little wanly, and coughed a good
deal, before he spoke.
“Ah, my dear Governor,” he said, “ ’tis
not pleasant to think of a good sailor-
man a-swinging on Gallows Hill. But
if you pardon him, I fear you will
greatly antagonise the officers of the
Corps. Only this morning, when I
had landed in the Cove from the
Porpoise, I ran into John Macarthur
as I walked up here. ‘And so you’re
a-going to lose your bos’n, Captain Put-
land,’ he says to me. ‘lt looks like it,
sir,’ I said, a little put out by the sarcas-
tic levity of his tone. ‘ ’Twill be a just
retribution for a scoundrelly act,’ he says.
‘A matter of opinion, Mr. Macarthur,’
says I. ‘At the worst, ’twas but a
drunken frolic.’ ‘What?’ he says. ‘How
can there be two opinions about it, sir?
This fellow Tredennis actually takes Cap-
tain Abbott’s horse from the rail in front
of the Commissariat Stores and rides
him, hell-for-leather, to Parramatta —
where he is apprehended red-handed, and
the horse well-nigh broken down and
ruined. The Court’s verdict was a proper
one,’ he says—‘l’ll go see the execution
myself. His hanging will teach your
infernal impudent tarpaulins to know
their places.’ There’s your John Mac-
arthur for you!”
The Governor halted and glared at his
son-in-law, whilst his face grew crimson
and he stamped his buckled shoe upon
the carpet. He had worked himself into
one of his furious rages.
“Hell!” he roared. “John Macarthur
dared to talk like that, did he? I'll
teach him who’s in command in New
South Wales. I’ll not have Tredennis
hanged—not if I’ve any power in the
Territory as the King’s representative.
I’ll not only reprieve Tredennis; I’ll
grant him a free pardon. This d d
country’s not going to be ruled by the
New South Wales Corps—not if I know
anything about it!”
“Well, well, sir—l think you’re right.
’Tis a case for exerting your prero-
gative.”
“Of course, it is, Putland. Tredennis
was with me in the Bounty in ’eighty-
eight, and on that hellish voyage to
Timor. And he was with me—a gunner’s
mate —in the Glatton at Copenhagen in
eighteen-one. I’ll see ’em all d d
before I let him be hanged.”
He picked up a paper from the table
and violently tore it into scraps, across
and across, which he threw upon the
carpet and stamped on angrily.
“There, d n ’em. That’s his death-
warrant. And now I’ll write out his
reprieve and an order for his release —
and you can have him back in the Por-
poise. But give him two dozen, Putland,
at the first opportunity. Two dozen ; and
disrate him. It need only be temporary.”

Mr. William Tredennis, lately boat-
swain of H.M.S. Porpoise, but now re-
duced to the rank of ordinary seaman,
sat in the dingy parlor of Moses
Emanuel’s Alderney Arms Inn in Ser-
geant-major’s Row —which afterwards
became part of George-street —and dis-
cussed his grievances with the landlord.
They drank rum without water out of
little pewter measures and smoked negro-
head tobacco in second-hand church-
warden pipes.
Bill Tredennis was a burly mariner
who hailed from Penzance in Cornwall,
grew a thick pigtail a foot and a half
long, and spat and swore with free-
dom and frequency. His companion was
a ferret-faced, swarthy fellow with a
squirit.
“Lookye, Mo,” said Bill, smiting the
greasy table with his great clenched fist—
“l have had enough o’ th’ sarvice. If I
can git out o’ it wi’ safety, out o’ it I’ll git.
’Tis th’ life of a dog, that’s what it is.
Ever since that little affair wi’ Captain
Abbott’s horse, they’ve give me hell
aboard th’ Porpoise. I’m a-sayin’ nothin’
agin th’ skipper. He be a mighty sick
man, an’ like enough to die. ’Tis th’
d n First Luff that’s got his knife
into me. Two dozen he give me
for spittin’ on th’ fo’c’sle head, th’ day
after me warrant was took away —an’ me
but just havin’ missed a-gettin’ of me
neck stretched!”
“Save us all, Bill,” said Mr. Emanuel,
“ ’tis favors he should be a-showin’ ye,
instead o’ spite an’ tyranny. An’ wot
may ye be a-thinkin’ of doin’?”
“Desartin’.”
“Oh, yes; o’ coorse. But w’eh ye’ve
runned away from the ship—wot plan
ha’ ye got then?”
Bill was silent for a while, took a swig
from his little mug of rum, puffed
thoughtfully at his pipe, and drummed
upon the table with the fingers of his left
hand. Presently he spat clean across the
narrow room on to the opposite wall, and
confessed the problem of his future
existence to be too much for him.
“Well —I dunno, Mo. I doan’t exackly
know quite what I’d better do when I’ve
got away from th’ ship. Now what would
ye advise a man for to do?”
Mr. Emanuel leaned his elbows on the
table and thrust his ugly face forward,
staring meditatively into his friend’s eyes.
He smoked his pipe in silence for nearly
half a minute before tendering the advice
that had been requested of him. Charac-
teristically, he tendered it in the least
direct way possible.
“S’posin’, Bill, you was to find y’self
at Broken Bay, to th’ nor’ard o’ this ’ere
Port Jackson, in a ship’s longboat, wi’ ’alf
a dozen good men an’ true, hall well
armed wi’ muskets an’ pistols, an’ ready
an’ willin’ for hanythink? S’posin’ that,
now.”
“Well?”-
“An’ s’posin’ you was to be a-waitin’
in that there boat be’ind Lion Island —
a-restin’ on y’r hoars, in a manner o’
speakin’, wi’ all them there pistols an’
muskets a-loaded an’ primed, an’ all pre-
pared for a hengagement wi’ the
enemy? A cuttin’-hout job, like I make
no doubt ye’ve often took a part in.
S’posin’ that, now?”
“Coom to th’ p’int.”
Mr. Emanuel blew a cloud of dirty
smoke across the table.
“I’m a-comin’ to it, Bill. S’posin’,
now, you was to see Andrew Thomp-
son’s schooner, th’ Dumfries, a-driftin’
down to th’ mouth o’ th’ river, all quiet
an’ unpurtected, wi’ no more’n her crew
o’ four men aboard of her, an’ all unsus-
pectin’ you was a-watchin’ of ’em from
be’ind that there hisland?”
“Well, wot about it?”
“Well, then, d’ye think ye’d ha’ th’ guts
for to go an’ take th’ blarsted schooner
an’ put that there skipper an’ crew of
Andrew Thompson’s over th’ side? Wi’
their throats cut? So’s they wouldn’t
talk too much. That’s it, now. D’ye think
y’r man enough for that, me hearty?”
The seaman gaped at the innkeeper.
Presently, with a little gasp of awe and
astonishment, he spoke.
“Split me tops’ls, Moses —’tis pi-
racy ! ”
“Wot o’ that?”
“ ’Tis hangin’ at th’ yardarm—if so be
a fellie’s caught by a King’s ship. Lord,
I’ve a-hauled ’em up meself.”
“ ’Tis true, if ye was to be caught,
they’d hang ye wi’out much question. A
long rope an’ a short shrift, hey? But
ye needn’t be caught, man —ye needn’t
be caught.”
“ ’Tis a great risk o’ it, Mo. More
like than not.”
“Pooh, now —who’s to see ye? Listen.
This here’s th’ lay.”
He dipped the stem of his pipe into his
rum and proceeded to trace a rude map
upon the surface of the table. It was a
rough outline of the coast from Botany
Bay to Barrenjoey Head.
“ ’Ere we are —’ere’s Port Jackson, an’
jest aroun’ North ’Ead we’ve got Cabbage
Tree Bay, wot’s th’ hocean side o’ thish-
yere sandbank they calls Manly. You
gets away from the Porpoise an’ makes
down there hoverland from th’ Nor’
Shore. Th’ day after, you sees a boat
a-fishin’ off that there beach in Cabbage
Tree, an’ you goes around to th’ little
bay nearest to Nor’ ’Ead, w’ere th’ boat
comes in an’ picks you up. In th’ boat
ye finds y’r ole friend Mister Moses
Emanuel, lately licensee o’ th’ Alderney
Arms, who’s about for to leave th’ coun-
try-bein’ compelled for to do so secret
like, ’im bein’ on’y th’ ’older of a ticket-
o’-leave an’ not free for to come an’ go
as ’e pleases. An’ besides ’im there’s five
good fellies wot’s also anxious for to leave
th’ country. There’s Mounseer Perrin,
an’ Paddy Sheehan, an’ Teddy th’ Ram,
an’ Dutch George, an’ Spanish Jack, wot
’ave all bin sailormen —though none on
’em knows aught o’ navigatin’ a ship.
You understand that there lay, don’t ye,
Bill?”
“Yes, I do. J had hopes one time o’
goin’ for master’s mate. Yes, I can
navigate th’ ship—pervidin’ there’s th’
proper tools to do it wi’.”
“They’re all aboard th’ Dumfries.
She’s made a couple o’ runs to th’ Der-
went. All aboard ’er —we found that out
last time she was in th’ Cove. Ye
wouldn’t be wantin’ for them things.”
“Well, ye picks me up in Cabbage Tree
Bay. What then? What do we do next?”
“We pulls up to Broken Bay an’ waits
for th’ Dumfries be’ind Lion Hisland —
as I was a-tellin’ ye. When she heaves in
sight, we paddles off to her an’ takes her,
Then we ships some stores wot I’ve ’ad
sent down to Pittwater an’ puts to sea.
Then ’tis us for th’ Wes’ Coast o’ South
Ameriky, or Chiny—whichever you
thinks best —an’ all of us for freedom.
Well, now, wot d’ye think o’ it, Bill?”
Mr. Tredennis sighed and considered.
Then he reached a horny hand across the
table and clasped that of Mr. Emanuel.
“But 1 don’t like this throat-cuttin’.
I’ll join ye, Mo, if ye leave out that
part o’ it. That’s my on’y bargain. If
I’m a-goin’ for to desart, I’d better get
out o’ th’ country. But I don’t believe in
murder.”
“Oh, orright—l ain’t partic’lar. Though
I do think ’twould be safer to put the
hevidence agin us outer th’ way. How-
ever, we can set Andrew Thompson’s
crew ashore on Lion Hisland. That’ll be
all right. Ye’ll come wi’ us, Bill?”
“I’ll come wi’ ye.”
* * * #
With all sail set, and the gleaming
white canvas towering to the tops of her
tall spars against the clear blue sky,
H.M.S. Porpoise, with Commodore
Bligh’s broad pennant flying at her mast-
head, was standing up the coast, favored
by a slight southerly breeze, on the short
voyage from Sydney Cove to the Coal
River. Aboard her, as was indicated by
the pennant, was his Excellency the
Governor of the Territory, who had as-
sumed command in the absence ashore
on sick leave of her dying commander.
He was standing on the poop with the
First Lieutenant, Mr. Jonas Peabody, and
through their telescopes they were in-
tently watching a small schooner that was
standing out of Broken Bay.
“Aye, sir,” said Mr. Peabody, lowering
his glass, “ ’tis the Dumfries —Mr.
Thompson’s schooner —for certain. I
know her well. And I believe there is
something wrong aboard of her. There
are six men on deck, and not one of
them the figure of that fat skipper Mr.
Thompson employs.”
“Alter course, and stand in towards
her, Peabody. And have a boat ready to
board her —with a guard of marines.
Fire a shot across her bows to make her
heave-to. We’ll make certain there’s no-
thing wrong, at any rate. Tell the master
to bear up for her.”
In half an hour —having been com-
pelled to fire two shots into her hull to
check her progress, the warning gun hav-
ing passed unheeded —H.M.S. Porpoise lay
a couple of cables’ lengths from Andrew
Thompson’s little trading craft, and a
boat, in whose sternsheets the red jackets
of six marines gleamed in the morning
sunlight, was rowing from the warship
to the schooner. At the entrance to the
bay, to the left, was the high bluff of
Barrenjoey, and Lion Island lay to the
right, standing up against the background
of wooded hills and ranges through
which the Hawkesbury enters the Pacific.
Within less than an hour’s time the
boat had returned with six prisoners
aboard, their hands tied securely behind
their backs. As the first of them stepped
on the quarter-deck, Captain Bligh,
standing near the wheel, exploded into
profanity and blasphemy.
Tredennis stood rooted to the deck,
his eyes upon the planking. He could
not face that outburst of volcanic wrath
of which he knew himself to be the
cause.
“You dog!” BKgh roared at him. “So
this is your gratitude? I spared your
life out of consideration of what ye once
was —in the Bounty’s launch and in the
Baltic —and here you are, a-putting your
head in the noose again. I’ll hang ye
out of hand. Mr. Peabody, have a block
rove to the mainyard, and pipe all hands
to witness execution. We’ll give this
swine proper pirates’ treatment.”
“If you please, sir,” asked the First
Lieutenant apologetically —“what about
this other fellow?” He indicated Moses
Emanuel, standing terror-stricken near
the gangway. The other five prisoners
had crowded on the quarter-deck, and
the six marines, with bayonets fixed, were
drawn up in a line behind them.
The ship rolled sluggishly in the long
swell heaving gently in from the south-
“ Which fellow? Oh, I know him.
Good-morning, Mr. Emanuel. What’s
his share been in the business, Mr. Pea-
body?”
“Mr. Lacy, sir,” said the First Lieu-
tenant, waving his hand towards the
mature midshipman who had been in
charge of the boat’s crew that recaptured
the schooner—“ Mr. Lacy says that this
fellow was undoubtedly the leader of the
band, whilst Tredennis was the navigator.
One of the other prisoners hath informed
him that ’twas Emanuel who planned the
whole affair.”
“Then reeve another block to the
other end of the yard, Mr. Peabody.
We’ll run him up, too.”
Immediately upon hearing this sen-
tence of doom, the swarthy features of
Mr. Emanuel took on an ashen hue and
he fell upon his knees, his features con-
vulsed with abject terror.
“Oh, good Mr. Bligh —dear Cap'n
Bligh—don’t go for to hang me, sir. I
ain’t done nothink —indeed I ain’t, y’r
Ex’lenzy. They kidnapped me into thish-
yere job, sir—l do assure ye they did.
I’ll turn King’s hevidence, yT Honor.
Hanythink! On’y don’t ’ang me. Bill
Tredennis took th’ schooner. He’s th’
man wot done it all, y’r Ex’lenzy—wot
led us all astray. Oh, f’r th’ love o’ Gawd,
don’t ’ang me! I’ll do hanythink, so I
will, if”
“Ah, shut y’r filthy gob!” growled
Tredennis. “Take y’r gruel, can’t ye?”
His arms were pinioned, but his legs
were free. He took a step behind the
screeching Emanuel and kicked him
hard.
“Blocks an’ tackle all ready, sir!”
reported the boatswain, Bill Tredennis’s
successor, to the First Lieutenant.
“Everything ready, sir. Shall we pro-
ceed?” said Mr. Peabody to Captain
Bligh, saluting.
The Governor looked at the two con-
demned men, shifting his disgusted gaze
from the grovelling tavern-keeper to the
tall, manly figure of his old shipmate.
Bligh was not a sentimental man —he had
a scorn of sentiment —but, as he thought
of that long voyage, its perils and its
hardships, in the Bounty’s launch, nine-
teen years before, he realised that he had
it not in him to destroy this comrade in
its heroic performance. He turned to the
First Lieutenant.
“Put Tredennis in irons and shove him
in the cockpit. I’ll deal with him at the
Coal River. The others, also. As for this
rat” —he pointed with his right toe at the
abject Mr. Emanuel —“run him up at
once. Then signal the schooner to take
her old crew off the island yonder and
to proceed to Sydney.”
To the shrill piping of the boatswain’s
whistle, the men tailing on to the rope
that passed through the block at the port
end of the mainyard ran for’ard with
it. In the midst of his fervent and
hysteric screams for mercy, Mr. Moses
Emanuel rose suddenly from the deck
and, after a few convulsive struggles a
yard below the spar, departed a life which
he had never ornamented.
“My Gawd! ” gasped the look-out man
on the signal-hill at Newcastle as H.M.S.
Porpoise rounded the Coal Island at sun-
set. “Billy Bligh’s aboard. An’ look at
his sign a-hangin’ to th’ yard!”
Bird-song at Dawn.
Shrill ecstasy of sparrows,
And the whisper-music of bronze starlings;
A brown lark trilling high above the fallows;
The fluting of a magpie,
And the ripple of a thrush;
And hush! O hush!
The thin call of a tiny diamond bird:
Muted, scarce heard,
Yet beautiful as some immortal word.
Bird-song at dawn!
Would not the coming sunrise—
The slow bright beauty of the blossoming
skies —
Seem dimmed, the glowing glory incomplete,
Without the song of birds to make it sweet?
TASMANIA.

Any Sunrise.
Out of the east the bud of sunrise broke,
Swelled and uncurled and burst to radiant
flower
Of primrose tipped with carmine, streaked with
pold.
Aslant'the western sky the hills lay cold
And passionless and shadow-lined and dour.
Yet in the east the spring of morning woke
And sparkled on a spire, a roof, a tower....
My neighbor in the train followed my gaze;
I murmured that the sunrise was sublime.
“What’s that?” he said. “The sunrise, did
you say?
Lord lumme! You can see that any time! ”

Found in film
on Teeth...
the germ of tooth decay!
jLT >

i.
*s*
Buried beneath an ever-form-
ing film this invisible enemy
attacks enamel and destroys the
part beneath. To fight decay
you must remove film every day.
How to do it safely.
This is what the scientist finds when
he analyses film on teeth—
Lactobacilli —germs that produce
lactic acid which dissolves enamel
and destroys the teeth.
At last the search is ended! Science
has recently determined beyond all
reasonable doubt the cause of tooth
decay. A germ is guilty, by the
forbidding name of Lactobacillus.
This tiny rod-shaped organism lives
in film on teeth. It feeds on par-
ticles of food, and as it grows it
gives off lactic acid which attacks
tooth surfaces. First enamel is
dissolved—then the part beneath.
Finally the nerve is reached, caus-
ing abscess and pain.
What to do
To fight the germs that cause
decay, remove the film in which
they live and multiply. Film clings
stubbornly. Ordinary ways of
brushing do not remove it satis-
factorily. Film forms constantly
and absorbs the stains from food
and smoking.
To remove film is the primary
purpose of the scientific tooth
paste, Pepsodent. During the past
10 years our laboratories have
striven constantly to develop in
Pepsodent greater and greater film-
removing power. Recently a new
and revolutionary material was
discovered that offered new ad van-
tages in removing film. It differs
radically from any used in other
tooth, pastes.
SAFE —Polishes Enamel
This new material stands unique
in removing stubborn film—it
retards the formation of new film
by polishing tooth surfaces so
smoothly that it is difficult for film
to cling. As it polishes enamel to
high brilliance, it gives teeth a new
and sparkling glaze.
The materials in some tooth
pastes are so hard they scratch
enamel. But the new material m
Pepsodent is soft —twice as soft as
the material commonly used in
other dentifrices. This is the posi-
tive assurance of safety Pepsodent
offers you and your family.
Remember one fact: this new
cleansing and polishing material is
contained in Pepsodent exclusively
—and not in any other tooth paste
on the market. No other can give
you these results and this great
safety. Write for free 10-day tube

SCRYBYLLA GIVES FATE A HAND.
BY BLANCHE M. D’ALPUGET.
{{nnHE old beast! Wants something
young to give him a spasm, does
A he? Must be fifty-five if he’s a
day. Gets in on little Miss Passey’s
ticket, mops up her wine and doesn’t
even dance with her. Hasn’t the decency
to be courteous even!”
Muttering this undertone of invective,
Scrybylla Crossnyb dotted down name
after name on her pad, scowling the while
at her companion.
Scrybylla was a girl of impulses. Im-
pulses make one a victim of circum-
stances —not altogether an asset to a
social reporter.
She was taking notes of the Grand
Gala for United Charities, and Miss
Passey, the secretary, had deputed her
gentleman-friend to give her such in-
formation as she required.
Scrybylla was suffering a reaction from
her misguided impulse to be polite to
him. He had taken advantage of her
unusual amiability to paw her, and to
press so close that the feel of his whip-
cord coat on her bare arms made her
want to scream. He nauseated her. May-
be the synthetic fruit-cup, sandwiches and
cakes helped.
Scrybylla was disgusted with the
manner in which this shopworn “boy”
ogled every young thing in the place.
After dancing with a platinum blonde,
who looked bored to resentful pouting
of her purple mouth, he had confided to
Scrybylla that the platinum blonde —who
was about twenty —was just the age for
him.
Scrybylla liked Miss Passey.
Poor little blighter! What did she
get out of life? What, for that matter,
did she, Scrybylla, get with this social
leech inflicted on her?
“Here she comes again,” he blithered.
“Look, Miss Crossnyb ; isn’t she lovely?”
The platinum blonde, of course. Poor
little Passey! This elderly idiot was
about the answer to her mental query!
What pleasure, what personal benefit did
little Passey gain from her work for in-
digent humanity? Lord, the social ser-
vice she had given; the way she scat-
tered her largesse!
Ah, here she was, coming back
“Here she is!” Boostwer again.
Scrybylla followed his look. The plati-
num blonde was dancing up in the arms
of a tall youth with almost a human
expression on her face.
“Isn’t she lovely /" he repeated.
Miss Passey was trailing the blonde.
Scrybylla was about to hand Boostwer
the reply she had suppressed when she
noted Miss Passey looking at Boostwer.
Looking sadly, reproachfully, appeal-
ingly, resignedly—what? Yes, adoringly !
“Heavens, she loves the creature!”
Almost as the revelation hit her, Scry-
bylla was inspired.
“Well, if she wants it, why shouldn’t
she have it?”
Miss Crossnyb had good eyes and
a way with her when she cared. She
flashed a dazzling smile on Miss Passey’s
gentleman-friend.
“So you are the man of discrimina-
tion you look, Mr. Boostwer. Yes,
she is lovely; in some respects the love-
liest woman I know. But why tell me?
Why not tell the lady?”
“Tell the lady! It’s”
Scrybylla rushed in before he spilled
out his abject confession of failure to
impress Miss Platinum.
“Yes; tell her while you’re inspired-
while your courage is up. What have
you to fear? I know Miss Passey likes
you. She told me what great friends
you’d been twenty years ago. Why, she
must have been a schoolgirl and you just
starting off in life”
“God forgive a liar,” she added to her-
self.
“I suppose she wouldn’t leave her
parents then, and they wouldn’t let her,”
Scrybylla rattled on. “I can see your
devotion —everyone can; everyone talks
of it. A girl who was so wonderful to
her parents and who now devotes all her
time and energy to charity! What a
nature! She’ll be kind, even if she turns
you down!”
Boostwer was gulping and vainly en-
deavoring to stem Scrybylla’s eloquence.
She rushed on:
“But she won’t! I see it now; you
are the reason she has never married.
Goodness, the chances she’s had! ‘No,’
she said to me once when I teased her
about Captain Nemo — ‘no, I’ve only
loved one man, and while he’s alive I
couldn’t allow another man to squeeze
my finger even. I’ve got enough to keep
me,’ she said, ‘and some to spare to help
others. So I can keep my soul alive and
the romance of my youth green.’ ”
Scrybylla paused for breath.
“Sublime, I call it,” she resumed;
“sublime! You, too, Mr. Boostwer. You
re-establish my shattered ideals about
love and constancy.”
“And here she is! Oh, Miss Passey,
Miss Passey, dear! This man —oh, I’m all
excited —this man has been singing your
praises! But I’m sure he’s afraid of you,
afraid. The great he-man he looks, and
you such a wee thing.”
Lightning never lit Heaven quicker
than the light that flushed Miss Passey’s
faded face. Her blue eyes looked like
sapphires. She put her hands out to
the goggling man.
“Afraid? Robbie afraid of me? No,
it’s the other way about!”
Suddenly Scrybylla was afraid, too.
What had she done? Suppose Boostwer
were all cad from north to south! And
poor little Miss Passey, with her heart
in her eyes, her hands stretched out to
him and embarrassed words falling from
her tremulous lips!
“Oh, Mr. Boostwer,” she proceeded.
“Oh, Miss Passey! Romance in these
days of promiscuous petting-patties! Let
me announce it! What an item for the
‘Social Whirl’!”
Boostwer’s face flushed too. He
quickly took the fluttering little hands
stretched towards him and looked as if
he had suddenly seen Miss Passey in a
new light and himself in the true one.
“Miss Crossnyb, you’re a fairy god-
mother!” Then, to Miss Passey: “Will
you? May I?”
He took Scrybylla’s pad and wrote
firmly: “A marriage has been arranged,
and will take place forthwith, be-
tween” ....
When Scrybylla reached the office she
wiped her perspiring face, regardless of
make-up. “What a risk I took! And it
came off! Poor little Passey—l hope
she’ll never curse me for this night. As
for him, I’ve done him the best turn of
his life, but by the time he realises it
he’ll be sure he discovered her herself.
“What a husband, though! No back
to his head, and a gaping adenoidal
mouth! Who was it said the Fourth
William had a head like a pineapple?”
It was at a social affair a year or so
later. Scrybylla was on duty in a shel-
tered nook amid palms. Suddenly there
boomed a voice, the unmistakable voice
of Boostwer.
“Ah, Miss Crossnyb! I must say a
word to Miss Crossnyb.”
He approached affably.
“I haven’t seen you for ever so long.
We were away, of course. I regard you
as a harbinger of Fate, Miss Crossnyb.
But for Miss Crossnyb, maybe you,
my dear” (he bowed to his companion),
“might never have had the happi-
ness” —
Mrs. Boostwer looked Scrybylla over
deliberately, icily. Then, without a word,
she swept into the ballroom.
Plantation Song.
High time for planting up—and so I’m out all
day,
Delving in deep warm soil with spade and
bar;
And setting plants which will, as Summer comes
his way,
Their blindly trusting roots throw out afar.
Fine to be out in the jewelled mom, the magpies
carolling high!
Broad Cavendish leaves drip dewily as I
pass,
From the blue Pacific’s heave a fragrance
drifting by,
And bubbling call of pheasants from the
grass.

“YOUR VOICE INTRIGUES.”
I.
Your voice intrigues, your eyes provoke,
How shall one read the riddle?
Art yields no trick, no master stroke,
When voice intrigues and eyes provoke,
To bring these wantons ’neath the yoke
That dance to every fiddle.
When voice intrigues and eyes provoke
How shall one read the riddle?
11.
Emboldened now I kiss your hand;
’Tis but a test, believe me;
For scarce I know where yet I stand.
Emboldened now I kiss your hand.
My motive if you understand,
Your eyes shall not deceive me.
Emboldened now I kiss your hand,
A charming test, believe me!
111.
And yet my vanity is hurt,
For you, too, are a-testing,
With eye and mind and heart alert.
Ah, yes, my vanity is hurt!
No conquest yet I dare assert,
No victor’s arm arresting.
My vanity is sorely hurt,
For you, too, are a-testing!

Out of the Past.
BY HORTON BROOKS.
THIS morning it all came back to me.
“Simmo,” we used to call him.
But not at first—only after we had
come to understand him more. I remem-
ber how I used to resent his being a
member of our dugout in that gully at
Anzac.
I was younger than the others. Jim
Blunt, Harry Donaldson and “Tich”
Hemingway: they had seen a lot more
of life than I had, and were nearer
“Simmo” in point of age. But even they
seemed to be out of touch with him.
His preoccupation, his reserve, used to
get on my nerves. Those curious, shaggy
eyebrows of his, overshadowing his face,
his brooding face: a singular appearance
they gave him. Singular, and yet not
unattractive, I would reluctantly ad-
mit. ...
Yes; I lost my temper that night. We
had spent a heavy day stacking up all
those ammunition-boxes on the beach,
and I was badly in need of sleep. The
others had dozed off long ago ; but there
was “Simmo,” still tossing about.
“Look here!” I called out to him at
last. “I’m lousy, you’re lousy, we’re all
lousy; but can’t you manage to settle
down and let a fellow sleep?”
He started ; and I realised that he had
not been aware I was awake. I couldn’t
see his face in the darkness, but that
sudden antagonism of his I felt. It came
as a surprise: I had not imagined him
capable of such intensity of feeling.
“All right, then ; keep your hair on! ”
he said at last.
And then, muttering to himself, he
turned over on to his other side.
He was perfectly quiet after that.
About six months later it was.
Several of us had been detailed for some
job on the beach. It was just on dusk
when we returned to the dugouts. Dur-
ing our absence a mail had come in, and
most of the fellows were sitting outside
their dugouts reading letters and news-
papers as they sipped their tea.
At last, detaching myself from the rest
of the party, I approached our little
“home.”
“Simmo” was sitting there. “Simmo”;
but what a transformation! Seldom had
I seen such a look of happiness on a
man’s face.
Aware at last of presence, he turned.
I recall how embarrassed I felt, until I
saw Harry Donaldson grinning at me.
“What d’ you think?” he called out.
“ ‘Simmo’s’ a father. The news came
from his missus by to-day’s mail.”
Feeling like a fool, I moved towards
“Simmo,” holding out my hand. He
scrambled to his feet; and, from the
manner of his thanks, anyone would
have imagined that I was conferring a
favor upon him.
A boy it was, he said, in answer to
my question.
I passed on to the dugout. There was
no letter for me. And yet I did not
seem to be greatly disappointed.
The tea they had kept for me was
stone-cold. As I began to sip it, I stole
a glance at “Simmo,” the father of a man-
child.
Where actually did “Simmo” come
from? He was a Victorian ; that was all
we knew. It was well over six months
since we had left Australia; and how
remote Australia had come to be! It
seemed as if we had steamed into another
world. I kept looking at “Simmo” sitting
there, the letter still held in his hand.
Far more than any letters I had received
it managed to bridge the gap.
There, a few hundred yards away,
lay the sea. The handkerchief-ful of
land we were occupying, the Turks on
the one side, and on the other the sea:
how it seemed to imprison us! For
many weeks I had gazed on it, always
with the feeling of an exile. But, some-
how, I no longer felt like that.
“Simmo” sitting there, sucking away
now at his pipe. A pang of self-recrimi-
nation went through me as I continued
to watch him. That night in the dug-
out The trying times we had been
through They had been hard enough
for me, a lad, without a single worry
in the world; but “Simmo,” and his
missus, and now his child!
He fell asleep at last. But the rifle-
fire on the ridges was unusually fierce,
and it kept me awake.
It must have been near eleven o’clock
when I heard those footsteps outside.
Sergeant Walker. What did he want?
The sergeant bent down and peered
into the dugout. “Are you there, Sim-
monds?” he called out in his rasping
voice.
“Simmo” was lying the nearest of us
all to the entrance; and now Sergeant
Walker was shaking him vigorously by
the leg.
“I want you for a job,” I heard him
say. “There’s a roll of blankets to be
taken up to the Battery; they’ve been
singing out for them!”
I heard “Simmo” mutter something to
himself.
“Right-oh, Sarge!” he said.
He did not know, of course, that I was
awake. Inwardly I cursed the Battery.
Why the devil couldn’t they wait until
to-morrow for those blankets? And why
should “Simmo” be chosen for the job?
Why couldn’t he be left alone to-night?
But perhaps Sergeant Walker hadn’t
heard the news.
Couldn’t I volunteer for that job?
The thought suddenly occurred to me,
but just as suddenly I realised that
“Simmo” would never consent. So I
continued to pretend that I was asleep.
“Simmo” crawled out of the dugout.
I listened to his retreating footsteps. Up
the steep winding pathway he would
have to trudge with those blankets. It
would be over an hour before he came
back. What if he should not come back?
There was a lot of “stuff” coming over.
Queer that I should be exercising my-
self so much over “Simmo.” I knew
now that I would get no sleep until he
returned.
The time dragged—and dragged. And
still there was no sign of him.
I wiped my forehead; it had become
wet with sweat. He should have re-
turned long ago, I kept on telling my-
self.
And then suddenly all my fears van-
ished. Those footsteps—it was “Simmo,”
I felt certain of it. Coming up the path-
way leading from the bed of the gully,
he was whistling happily to himself.
Exhausted, I sank back on my bunk.
Exhausted ; quite worn out
After Gallipoli, I lost track of
“Simmo.” When the batteries were re-
organised at Tel-el-Kebir, we found our-
selves in different units.
I came across him once later —in
Flanders. On the Menin Road it was,
during a block in the traffic —after the
big stunt. He was ploughing his way
through the mud, going the opposite way
to us. Jumping down from the limber,
I made myself known to him.
How glad we were to meet one
another! And how disappointed I was
when the order came to us to move on!
And I hadn’t asked him a single word
about his kid! I remember telling my-
self that after we had moved on.
This morning I had intended
spending it working in the garden. It
was at breakfast-time that I decided that
I would go for a walk instead. Such
a glorious morning it was!
So, hatless, I set off, intent on getting
the full benefit of the sunshine.
I had never been that way before.
“Hesbecourt” —the name on the gate.
Hesbecourt? I, too, had memories of
Hesbecourt.
And then, suddenly, I pulled up short.
Clad in grey flannel trousers and that
bright-looking cardigan, he was sitting
on the verandah-step, reading the morn-
ing paper. A living likeness, eyebrows
and all. Even before I saw the sign-
plate at the other end of the verandah,
I seemed to know who he was.
The name-plate: “Mrs. Simmonds,
Costumiere,” it read.
“Mrs. Simmonds” —was his mother a
widow, then? And then I remembered.
So many other faces; those crowded,
eventful days. So many other chaps
who had entered into my life—and
departed from it. But I began to remem-
ber now.
It was at that camp on Salisbury Plain
where I was awaiting repatriation that
I learnt that “Simmo” had gone west.
So that was “Simmo’s” son? The
old dugout at Anzac, how it all came
back to me! A thing of the past Anzac
had become; but once more it was real.
Absorbed in his newspaper, he had not
noticed me. I was still at liberty to
stare at him. Anzac; nineteen-fifteen;
he would be eighteen.
Should I enter and make myself
known? I could tell him so much about
his father. And of the night when
“Simmo” got the news, the news of
him. The roll of blankets—l could tell
him all about that.
How would he receive me? What
would he say? Would he introduce me
to his mother? “Hesbecourt”? Was it
at Hesbecourt, then, that “Simmo” had
got his issue?

amalgamated. The result has proved to be ah Immensely improved newspaper—
“ The Courier-Mail.” The pooling of the circulations of the two papers, after
allowing a liberal reduction for duplication, Will give “The Courier-Mail” a
circulation of not less than
60,000 COPIES DAILY
This is by far tlie largest circulation in Queensland. The new advertising rates
give an economy to advertisers which was impossible while the two papers
functioned independently. Particulars, etc., from

Seeing the lad sitting there, how old
I seemed to have become! How con-
scious, too, standing bareheaded, of my
baldness. “A mate of your father’s,”
I could say. But what would he think
of me? A most unheroic figure I now
must look. He had never seen “Simmo” ;
but he would have some picture of his
soldier-father in his mind.
What did I know about fellows of his
age? The few I knew I had so little
in common with —or they with me. I
hardly knew how to talk to them, what
to say. I had tried to understand them ;
but they did not seem to understand me.
When he turned over that page of his
paper I thought then for the moment
that he had seen me.
I stayed there for a little while longer.
And then, slowly, miserably, 1 moved
away.
Several hundred yards further along
the street it must have been. I had
thought that somewhere I had heard
a postman’s whistle. But I did not see
him until I had almost bumped into
him.
He must have noticed my badge.
“Good-day, Dig.!” the postman said
cheerfully, taking a fresh grip on his
mailbag. . , , ,
“Good-day, Digger!” I grinned back
at him.
For the heavy mantle of loneliness
had suddenly fallen from me. I felt
fit for the battle of life again.
Lodge Night.
BY W. CHARNLEY.
DUDLOW hadn’t really meant to stay
so late at lodge. In fact, he had
promised his wife to be home by
ten ; but he had stumbled in on a smoker
night, and there had been visitors from
another branch, and a chap who’d been
in vaudeville, and, of course, beer.
The clock struck midnight before he,
like Cinderella, realised that it was late.
He felt that he really didn’t care much,
anyway.
There are times when a man scorns
the whole female sex, and just yearns for
the chance to put his contempt on visible
record. With Dudlow the moment was
when he had a cargo of the best stowed
beneath his waistcoat.
The footpath seemed to have become
uncomfortably narrow. The policeman
on the corner coughed heavily when
Dudlow, with an access of civility, wished
him “Goo’-ni’.”
The door of the big apartment house
which he and his spouse called home
stood open—obviously waiting for him
—and the electric light burned brightly
in the hall. The porter snored heavily
in his cubicle, and Dudlow feared to
wake him ; neither did he feel compe-
tent to operate the lift himself. The
stairs were there anyway—good old-
fashioned stairs.
No hurry. Let the old wife “rouse”;
he wasn’t afraid of her.
He climbed the stairs heavily, with
occasional rests against the banisters.
The first floor was gained; then the
second. He was half-way to the third
when a woman came fluttering down to
meet him.
“Oh!” she gasped. “I thought you
were never going to come. You must
go for a doctor at once. Your wife is
in such a state!”
“The wife?”
“Yes, your wife. She says she must
have a doctor and chloroform. She was
all alone when someone rang me up
from the nursing clinic, and I haven’t
been able to leave her since—-not to tele-
phone or anything. She ought to go to
a hospital, but I’m afraid to move her.
Get a doctor at once.”
Dudlow felt stunned. His wife, his
faithful partner? Something dreadful
had happened to her.
Through his alcoholic maze he per-
ceived that this woman wore a nurse’s
uniform. And she spoke of doctors,
chloroform, hospitals. His brain reeled.
What had happened?
“Tell me more!” he gasped.
“No, no!” she snapped. “Go for the
doctor quick. It’s a matter of life and
death.”
Dizzily Dudlow stumbled down the
stairs. Heavily he clashed into the hall,
waking the porter as he passed. Down
the front steps and out into the starlit
street.
The cold air sobered him. His wife!
All her faults were forgotten and for-
given as he pictured her lying, haggard
with pain, beneath the white coverlet of
the bed. Where should he turn for aid?
A telephone booth stood on the corner
but it offered little hope. He was not
sure whether he had the necessary two-
pence ; not sure that he could find the
lodge doctor’s number; not sure if, even
should he manage to find it, he could
whisper it over the wires with sufficient
coherence for the sleepy exchange to
pick up the figures. And it all would
mean wasting precious minutes.
That white-capped nurse! Alone,
fighting with death —brave little soul!
And his wife, pale-faced beneath the
coverlet!
He started to run. He must find a
doctor somewhere.
Ah, the policeman! He would know
where the nearest doctor lived.
“Second street on your right. Look
for the red light. Doctor ; just saw him
garage his car.”
The doctor. A swift run in his car.
Apartment-house steps. Porter, alert at
the lift. Anxious-faced nurse, beckon-
ing. Whispered consultation between j
her and the doctor. They step into the
lift and are whisked out of sight.
Dudlow again begins to climb the
stairs. He treads heavily, but he does
not pause to rest. Anxiety gnaws his
soul. Dear little woman! A bit wasp-
ish at times, but all must be forgiven
when she lies torn with pain beneath the
white coverlet.
First floor. Second floor. Third floor.
Fourth floor. An electric globe glowing
dimly shows him the door of 56—his
home.
He listens intently. Not a sound.
There is something death-like in the
silence. Chloroform. Operation. Not
a sound!
Stealthily he bends to the keyhole.
Then he realises that all inside is in
darkness. What does it mean?
Carefully he turns the knob. Cau-
tiously he opens the door,
A chair falls over. Her old trick to
catch him. The light clicks on.
Mrs. Dudlow sits up in bed and glares
at him.
“Beast! Two o’clock. Drunk.”
“But—but, my dear, I thought you
were ill. I brought the doctor.”
“111! I should think I would be!
Sick of waiting for you. You’d make
any woman ill. Don’t stand there gasp-
ing like a stuck fish! Come to bed be-
fore it’s morning.”
Last man in on the top floor, it was
Dudlow’s duty to switch off the stair-
head light. Now sober, he paced out in
his pyjamas. Down on the next landing
he could hear voices.
“Thanks, doctor. Awfully. A boy,
you say? Grand! I was away, you know.
Taxi-driver, all hours. A man came
for you, you say? That would be the
old sport Dudlow, on the next floor. 1
must thank him. A boy, eh? She'll be
all right now? Good-night, doctor.”
As Dudlow crept beneath the white
coverlet he whispered “The taxi-driver's
wife’s got a baby boy.”
“Poor thing!” murmured his wife
drowsily. “What suffering we women go
through for you brutes of men!”
The Midnight Hour.
At the middle of the night,
In a place of leafiness,
When the trees stand still and white
And the leaves hang motionless —
Motionless all things around,
Save the mist that slow upwreathes—
It is good to breathe the rest
That the sleeping soil outbreathes.
Tired of tired and restless folk
And of hours that know no calm,
rom the gum-tree and the oak
You will gather peace and balm —
Peace beyond all measurement,
Balm all-soothing and all-sweet —
As you tread the yielding grass,
Cushion-soft beneath your feet.
If you’ve any pain at all,
Any trouble, any grief,
From your spirit it will fall
As, unnoticed, falls a leaf
When its little day is done
And its green has turned to brown,
And, aweary of the wind
And the sun, it circles down.
There is not a place on earth
Like the bush at midnight’s hour —
Not a hall of light and mirth,
Not a lone and ancient tower;
For, for ever there dwell peace
And that kind forgetfulness
Which we crave for, one and all,
In life’s ceaseless storm and stress.
When the stars of midnight glow
O’er a place of ferns and trees,
You will find, if there you go,
All you crave of peace and ease:
There ’twill seem to you, in truth,
As with softened tread you stray
Through pale-pillared corridors,
That the world is worlds away.

THE BERNARD
CRONIN STORY-
WRITING COURSE
10 LESSONS.
Mr. Cronin’s course is a masterpiece of
expert practicality. The components of
a story—-theme, plot, openings, dialogue,
characterisation and description the
very names of which excite the imagina-
tion, and the awe, of literary aspirants,
are considered in detail with a wealth of
illustration and practical advice that at
once removes many of the more serious
obstacles from the path of the beginner.
The instruction is given in ten lessons
and three supplements. Mr. Cronin’s
own enthusiasm is so great, his sympathy
so large and his handling of the practice
work sent in so competently confident that
the interest of his pupils never flags.
Those who have a real flair for writing
very soon make a good job of every
piece of work they send in. They are
helped the more inasmuch as they are
never kept waiting for their revised work.
It is true that pupils have to work.
Mr. Cronin is not content with less than
the best they can do ; and neither are
they allowed to rest content until he has,
by instruction and illustrative revision
of parts, trained them to polish and re-
polish until the whole is a finished piece
of work truly expressive of the writer’s
intention and individuality.
Later, in the advanced lessons, the
pupil is sometimes asked to return to an
earlier story, and in the light of his —
and frequently her —added experience
and increased knowledge improve it to
publication standard. Mr. Cronin is
most insistent, however, on his pupils
submitting to editors none but good
work. Not, of course, the best they ulti-
mately will do, but work of such a stan-
dard as will preclude the possibility of
their being classed by editors as per-
manent mediocrities.
The results are becoming increasingly
apparent, Some are given in detail in
“Friendships,” copies of which can be
had on request.
In addition to teaching story-writing,
Mr. Cronin criticises the MSS. of writers
who have had only a limited success.
This critical service has proved of great
value to many whose work, through
minor faults of construction or presenta-
tion, has just failed to get publication.
Mr. Cronin’s Story-writing Course is
fully described in an illustrated pamph-
let, “Writing to Win.” Copies will be
sent post free to any reader of The
Bulletin who would like one. Those
specially interested in the criticism of
MSS. or in the writing of newspaper
articles and paragraphs are requested to
mention the fact.
Letters can be addressed to Mr. Ber-
nard Cronin, c/o E. H. Welford Pty.,

LADY KEEBLE
(Lillah McCarthy)
Lady Keeble says
that Pelmanism
helps her practi-
cally in her work.
Life’s 3 Movements
A human life has three movements,
which constantly recur and frequently
intermingle. They are towards the
making of a living, fellowship with
others, and activities peculiar to the
individual, such as sport, hobbies,
reading, etc. The following opinions'
of Pelmanists give point to the claim
that Pelmanism infuses every action,
in all departments of life, with the
spirit of success.
Livelihood.
It may interest you to know that my
figures for the first quarter this year
show an increase of 30 per cent.—Com-
mercial Traveller.
I feel physically and mentally alive and
ready for my day's work. I can find
interest in it now, when I was beginning
to t l,iirt k I had made a mistake.
—Engineer.
I am conscious of much greater freedom
in preaching -also of fertility of ideas.
Last Sunday I preached four times to
different congregations on practically the
same subject with scarcely any repetition.
—Clergyman.
Thanks to Pelmanism. I have instituted
a system into the harvesting which
worked out without a hitch, and have
taken off a record crop with less expense
per ton, and in a shorter time than ever
I have before.—Horticulturist.
Social Life.
....Considerable progress in my con-
versational efforts, which are now a plea-
sure and relaxat ion, instead of "an em-
barrassment.—Assessor.
Whilst visiting many large centres and
interviewing large numbers of business
and pfofessiotaal lfion, I have found re-
peatedly coming to my aid the benefits of
ilie Pel man Course.'-^Doctor.
Keener interest in life and improved
greatly in Self-Confidence. Personality
and Memory. Conducting my social life
confidently and more efficiently,—Clerk.
I took up the Course with the main
object of overcoming a reserved nature,
which precluded me from taking part in
discussions of policy and in debates. I
have achieved this object. Also. I find
myself rapidly acquiring a larger circle
of friends. —Farmer.
Other Activities.
Last month I won a Flying Scholarship
for which there Were MU entrants. I
thank Pelmanism for this success, chiefly
because of the wonderful manner in
which it has increased my self-confidence.
—Clerk.
I have something to show for the Pel-
man Training. I have just won the State
mile Professional Cycling Champion-
ship. The Course, by increasing my con-
fidence. certainly helped me to gain this
title.—Cycle Assembler.
1 am amazed at the manner in which
these printed Lessons time and again
hit upon, and deal with, what I have
always considered as my own personal
and particular problems.—Engineer.

Why should one man need wakening and
the other not?
“3.15 on Thursday afternoon. I’ll remind you.”
Is one man more interested than the other
that he should remember? Is it interest
only?
“Did you notice that?”
Why do some people notice the significant
things which others miss?
“Can’t you see where all this leads to?”
How is it that some people have foresight
and others have not?
“The kernel of the matter is in that sentence.”
Why should some people read only words,
whilst others follow thodghts?
“She does most of her own work, and yet goes
out a lot.”
HoW do some women manage so that they
have time and energy for an agreeable social
life?
“Let us ask ‘So-and-So’ what he would do.”
Who is ‘'So-and-So” that he should know
what others should do?
“He is never hurried, but he gets through a great
amount of work.”
Why do some people work so comfortably and
without apparent effort?
The questions asked, with many others which have doubtless
suggested themselves to the minds of readers, are fully
answered in the Pelman Course of Scientific Mind, Memory
and Personality Training. Each of them refers to one or more
of those qualities of the mind and character which, in the
aggregate—or even singly, so important are they—distinguish
a man who, in almost any department of life, stands out
among his fellows. Real success comes to the man who has
developed all-round mental efficiency by cultivating such
qualities as:
Concentration
Observation
Judgment
Initiative
Decision
Originality
Resourcefulness
Organising Power
Self-Confidence
Self-Control
Reliability
Driving Force
Business Acumen
And a Reliable Memory.
The Pelman Method of Training is explained in “The Efficient
Mind,’’ copies of which are posted free. There are 650,000
World Felmanists, of whom 31,000 have enrolled with the
Institute in Melbourne.

BECAUSE
ENO’S “Fruit Salt” has triumphed over
every test of time and usage—for over
sixty years it has been the acknowledged
alkaline corrective throughout the world.
BECAUSE
ENO, in its fine powder and highly con-
centrated form, is more economical in
use and fetter value than the so-called
substitutes.
BECAUSE
ENO is prepared only from the finest
ingredients. It contains nothing injuri-
ous no purgative mineral salts, no
sugar to cheapen production or prove
harmful in cases such as diabetes, no
artificial flavouring matter.
the reasons why:
BECAUSE
ENO, wherever bought, is always the
same perfect product, unvarying in
.quality, composition and purity, and
untouched by hand in manufacture.
BECAUSE
ENO taken regularly is the natural way
to insure internal cleanliness—to elim-
inate waste matter which causes acid
poisoning and intestinal toxicity. It is
recognised as the safest, non-habit-
forming, aid to good health.
Comparison proves there is no substi-
tute. Buy a bottle of ENO’S “Fruit
Salt” to-day and prove its superiority
for yourself.
The words Eno and "Emit Said’ are registered trade marks.
