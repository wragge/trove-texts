The Secret Source of Crime.
That brilliant Frenchman, H. A. Taine,
says somewhere in his wonderfully analy-
tical “ History of English Literature ” :
“ When we scratch the covering of an Englishman’s
morality the brute appears in its violence and its defor-
mity. , One of the English statesmen said that with the
French an unchained "mob could he led by words of
humanity and honour, but that in England it was neces-
sary, in order to appease them, to throw to them raw
flesh.”
If this is so, how great the responsibility of
those who feed the animals ! Taine says in
another place :
“ Vice and virtue are products, like vitriol and sugar;
and every complex phenomenon arises from other more
simple phenomena on which it hangs.”
The simplest action in a man’s daily life is a
factor in the gradual moulding of a citizen.
The clothes he wears, the people with whom
he associates, the food he eats, the air he
breathes, the very sunshine that pours down
on his head, his habits of bathing, smoking,
drinking, his mode of locomotion—-whether
does he walk or ride ?—the age of his father
and mother at the time of his birth, their
tendency to various diseases, their race,
religion, all conspire to produce the man
contrast to a man. Everything he says or
does and all he hears or sees assist either by
assimilation or opposition in his develop-
ment. As Buckle puts it: —
“ The actions of men, being determined solely by their
antecedents, must have a character of uniformity, that is
to say, must under precisely the same circumstances,
always issue in precisely the same results. ... All
the vicissitudes of the human race, their’ progress or their
decay, their happiness or their misery, must he the fruit
of a double action ; an action of external phenomena upon
the mind, and another action of the mind upon the
phenomena.”
In other words, all those actions of
men which we are accustomed to term
virtuous or vicious are not so much actions
resulting from the operation of men’s own
volition, as they are actions resulting from
men’s antecedents which introduce disturb-
ing elements and bring about manifestations
altogether unexpected by the superficial
observer. That is to say : If Jones were a
nervous man, subject to fits of depression
and worry, and if he had known Smith, also
a nervous man subject to fits of depression
and worry, and Smith had in one of those
fits hanged himself, the probability is that
Jones would at some time or other imitate his
example, even to the method of taking his
own life.

Every year many men kill themselves, and
no doubt this is in great measure due to the
contagion of example. Where men kill
themselves because they are dying of starva-
tion, though the number of deaths in pro-
portion to the population is not increased,
yet a mode of dying seems to gain favour.
This is an instance of antecedent influence.
When men were hanged by the dozen for
sheep-stealing, the temptation to steal a sheep
and be hanged appears to have been irresis-
tible. Everybody must have hoard the
anecdote of the Frenchman who, upo
witnessing a noble performance of a trag
masterpiece, exclaimed, ‘‘ I too, will be
poet!” The victim of excitement of the pr
sent time varies the utterance, and upon reac
ing of a specially atrocious and blood-thirs
crime, exclaims, even if unconsciously-, “ '
too, will be a murderer.” And so t'
hysterical girl finds in some newspap
paragraph the necessary incentive
concoct the tale of violation or
make her dehut on the pave. The menta
machinery is already deranged and wan
only a tilt in a particular direction
developc an entirely fresh and possib
altogether unsuspected phase.

As many boys have been incited to
roving life by reading Defoe’s immorta
romance, and as many a young thief. In
come to the gallows by way of a perusal of tl
adventures of Jack Sheppard or Claud
Duval, so the crime of a more dubious com
plexion, the experiment in lewdness ;inc
salacity, is germinated in the minds of th
mentally diseased by scanning the bruta'
paragraphs collated by sensationally-riba]
journals whose one end is gain per mediui
of an increased circulation. These degradec
sheets devoted to the records of lascivienc
adopt any and every means to secure the
object. They act as procurers to the stew
of debauched imagination and play th
pimp to intellectual pruriency, which the
lusciously pamper and pander to by a r
chauffe of lubricious details. They are th
literary recreation alike of the trull and th
prude, and are conned with feverish eager
ness by the vulgar emotional religionist
the fanatic of the slums—and the larrikin, t
whom vice in its grosser vagaries is an ope
b?ok,
♦ * *
The Sydney Evening News is an ole
offender in this matter, and, like cheese, i
grows ranker with age, and shows no signs o:
falling off in the savageness of its impurity
During the past few years it has given to
grateful gutterdom reports, minute as
dared, of nearly every sensational crim. con
and rape trial that has taken place i
England, a country sixteen thousand mile
away. With a thoroughness worthy of
sewer-fossicker it has served up the rottei
garbage of disgusting divorce cases anc
lingered lovingly with an air of intensest de
votion over the revelations of the moral dis
secting-room. Not long since we wer
afforded an opportunity of noting that it
hand had lost not its cunning, and that th
journalistic conciliatrix of rutterdom stil
ministered to the wants of the erotic, whil
the moral fulminator stood by with his las]
to drive the lesson home in the conscience
of the snuffling, albeit prurient, professor
of pietism and purity. An incestuous rape
had been committed in the Grafton district
New South Wales, by a wretch namec
Inman, upon his two little girls, aged re
spectively 11 and 15 years. The News, not
withstanding the fact that it prefaced its
report with a statement to the effect tha
“ all boys and females were ordered out o:
court,” gave a sufficiently revolting accoun
of the horrible lust and lechery of the case
to afford to potential criminals in a like
direction enough food for carnal thought for
the manufacture of a dozen or so similar
outrages. It is impossible to even faintly
adumbrate the terrible injury inflicted by
this sort of thing upon the health of public
morality. It should surely be enough for
the proper administration of justice for the
community to know, in a broad anc
general sense, that a certain offence hac
been committed, without raking over the
abominable mullock-heap with a ribalc
pen, more than hinting at atrocities tha
not even the bare, naked facts of the case
would warrant. In such recent affairs
as the Pall Mall Gazette and Lady
Colin Campbell cases—not to mention
others equally notorious—the News, with
the true delight of the chiffionier, displayec
all the filthy particulars at full length with
relish for its employment positively revolt
ing, and with an effect upon the minds of its
half-educated clientele which can never be
fathomed by reason of its insidiousness anc
viscidity.
* * *
Here is an opportunity for the law to
prune a little of that license of the - bruta]
press in a direction which would conduce to
the public welfare in a far greater measure
than in the application of effete libe]
regulations to some journal which—by speak-
ing the truth in a matter possibly affecting
the real good of the community—is so unfor-
tunate as to come within the meaning of an
obsolete Act for the oppression of news-
papers and the conservation of the assumed
rights of the individual social offender. Why
should these filthy details, in all their
naked brutality, ever see the light of
day under any circumstances whatsoever ?
Indeed, as we have already indicated, they
can do no possible good, and the harm they
inflict upon, society, as it is at present con-
stituted, is almost incalculable. The pro-
hibition of such evidence would not, as is
so often asserted, occasion any miscarriage
of justice, for the records of a trial can
always be consulted by those who question
the matter in a bona fide manner, or they
can be laid upon the table of the House and
become the subject of a Parliamentary inquiry.
We have numerous instances in which
judges presiding at crim. con. trials and
divorce cases have interdicted the publica-
tion of evidence on the ground that it was a
question affecting public morality, and
surely there is room for legal interference in
this matter of preventing the printing of
vicious reports by unscrupulous journals and
the shovelling of nauseous details in all their
disgusting baldness before the nose of the
public, simply in the interests of unalloyed
sordid commercialism ? And if the law be
silent in the matter let the cleaner section of
the community take the affair up and show
their sincerity by boycotting a paper
which first incites to crime and then
invariably stands by the gallows to grease
the rope for Jack Ketch.

The pendulum of mediocrity and purity
describes but a brief arc in the circle of
human experience. The swing which hurries
the victim from madness to crime—almost
synonymous—courses over a sextant, and
requires but a slight stimulus, too often fur-
nished by a bestial paragraph, to hurry it
beyond the limit of immunity from punish-
ment into another region, where the swing-
ing is done at the end of a halter depending
from the outstretched arm of that latter-day
sign of so-called Christianity—the gibbet.
Unite two chemicals, innocuous in them-
selves, and you have an explosion. The
Evening News, allied to feminine hysteria
or masculine mania, germinates crime. The
paper full of rape-cases or unnatural
offences, forms part of the environment of
the average man. In the case of many men,
and notably those whose circumstances pre-
clude intercourse with higher and nobler
literature, it forms a very important part.
What a horrible fact ! Nearly, if not all
the printed matter a great number of men
peruse is comprised in the reports of out-
rages and assaults upon alleged feminine
virtue, or accounts of blood-curdling incest
and savage bestiality. The News ministers
to the traffic of Moll Flanders and Rox-
ana, but calls loudly for the punishment
of those who fall victims to the “ lady
with the golden hair. ” While that journal
is busy in preparing the mind of Lais for a
fall, and supplying the demands of a com-
merce it affects to denounce, it shirks the
responsibility of castigating the ‘ ‘ respect-
able ” seducer, though at the same time it
instigates the moralists of the Sydney Ex-
change and the Union Club to avenge
wrongs inflicted upon “society” by those
who are. in reality the victims of social
neglect.
* * «
The lecherous journal plays the part of
jackal to Caloraft’s lion—it is the hang-
man’s best and most useful friend. Like
the pendulum, it oscillates continually be-
tween the poles of libidinous suggestion and
bowlings for blood. The News, in par-
ticular, was, in no small degree, responsible
for the hanging of the Mount Rennie
offenders. In the first place, by publishing
or hinting at exaggerated and horrible, if
not utterly false details, calculated to in-
flame all the dormant brutality of unedu-
cated social “ respectability, ” and all the
pruriency of those afflicted with a mental
itch; and secondly, by ferociously demanding
the lives of the miserable youngsters as a
sop to the Cerberus of outraged society.
During the popular excitement incident to
the trial the columns of the News were thrown
open to hysterical and neurotic nymphomani-
acs. They absolutely reeked with villainous
amateur-surgical suggestions of mutilation
and disfigurement, worthier the State records
of Bashibazouks than of a supposedly intelli-
gent organ conducted in an age of
alleged enlightenment. The immediate
effect of such revolting suggestions
upon similarly nervous organisations is
impossible to gauge, and the ultimate effect
upon the aggregate morality of the com-
munity has no ascertainable limit. In
short, the surest way in which to secure the
commission of crime is to take every oppor-
tunity of pointing out the way in
which it may be committed. Society
will continue to be shocked by the
recurrence of gross outrages and nameless
offences just so long as sensational prints are
allowed by the authorities to publish the
evidence connected with such cases. The
only sure way of stamping out a disease is to
attack it in its matrix ; no doctor would
attempt the treatment of small-pox by the
application of an ointment to its surface
symptoms.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Shoddy Ring.
The Parkes Government lias boycotted all
Sydney newspapers which do not support its thrice-
insolvent and “burning brand of shame” com-
bination. It now advertises only in the daily
papers. The daily papers support the Parkes
Government merely because it pays them to do
so. The Bulletin criticises Governments irre-
spective of consequences. The now repealed
5 per cent. New South Wales ad valorem paper
duties used to cost the Sydney daily newspapers
£11,600 annually. Should a Protectionist Govern-
ment come into power in New South Wales and
impose a ten per cent, ad valorem duty on print-
ing paper (that would be the very lowest figure)
with a view to re-opening the local paper-mills,
which the untaxed imported products of starving
European labour have long ago shut up, the
Sydney dailies will have to hand over to the State
at least £23,000 a year out of their colossal profits,
In other words, the Fairfaxes (who make
£BO,OOO a year out of their Sydney papers) and
the Bennetts (who probably make £40,000 a year
out of their hireling rags) and the land-jobbers
and syndicate-men of the Daily Telegraph
(whose profits are an unknown quantity) will col-
lectively be directly £23,000 a year Out of pocket
by Protection—this altogether apart from the
fact that a Protectionist Government when it
comes into power one of these days will impose
postage on newspapers, and will thereby rook the
advocates of shoddy to the extent of, say, another
£20,000 a year. The three big Sydney news-
papers are supporting Parses only because
they get out of him, that is to say, out of the tax-
payer, £43,000 a year—which is a noble sum and
well worth fighting for. Of course the pro-
prietaries of these three venal publications
will deny The Bulletin’s impeachment,
and flippantly say that if their printing
paper _be taxed and postage be imposed
they will in both cases “ pass it on” to the publi
But when an excise duty was put on colonial be
and the big Sydney brewers threatened to “ pa
it on,” the daily papers simply laughed at the
impotence. And it will be no more possible f(
the proprietor of the twopenny or penny new
paper to “ pass it on ” than it was for the brew
to have the cost of retailed beer increased or tl
size of the glass diminished. Of course the brewe
might have been able to pay the excise by adu -
terating the beer, but this plan is not open to th
papers, for the readers of the Herald would n
more stand any alloy of ungodliness in the Fad
faxes’ snuffling than would the readers of tl
Noozk endure any admixture of cleanliness in th
Bennetts’ muck. They may argue that even :
they can’t increase the price of their papers the
can increase the price of their advertisements.
But that argument is also bad, inasmuch as the
even now extort all they can from the public, anc
as they fight cut-throat battles, combination o
their part will be impossible. The workman buj
the Sydney penny papers, and, in return, th
penny papers help to rob him of employment.
They import their paper from Germany and shu
up the New South Wales paper-mills. Which s
another of the “moral aspects of Freetrade.”

Hie Chancellor’s Plot.
A London writer says of the latest aspect of th
Emperor of Germany’s malady
“ It is very sad and very terrible, and there will even
where be the deepest sympathy for the illustrious patien
and for his anxious and tortured relatives ; but no goo
purpose can be served by keeping up the issue of offleia
reports specially framed to deceive.”
We waive that part of the “sympathy ” which i
telt because the patient is “illustrious,” to ask
who are the people responsible for “keeping in
■;he issue of official reports specially framed to de
ceive ” ? A London paper has its own explana
tion, and points by inference to Sir Mokell Mac
kenzie as the “ people responsible,” &c. :
Bismarck and Prince William are known to hav
been playing a deep game for some time, which the sud-
denness of the event wholly spoiled. By the famih
statutes of the royal house, a prince afflicted with an in
curable ailment is incapable of reigning. The youw
Prince and the Chancellor have long been leagued again!;
the late Crown Princess, who is thoroughly detested b\
the Prussian Court and in military circles* and whom i
was hoped might be shut out by this cause from the Ini
penal dignity. Sir Mohell Mackenzie’s inexplicable
position at San Kemo, and his sticking to the statement
that the malady is not cancer, against the opinion of the
whole faculty, is thus explained, his persistency having
prevented the statutory declaration being obtained that
would have prevented the Englishwoman becoming
Empress of Germany, thus shelving her in the case of
widowhood as Dowager Crown Princess with a jointure of
£4200 a year. . . . Should her husband die before hei
she will now be entitled to all the privileges, emoluments
and prerogatives of the Imperial state. The new Em-
press is an woman who fully realised the
danger of the recent crisis, and, with commendable pluck,
sagacity, and determination, set herself to the dei-peratt
task of circumventing her enemies. She has won against
heavy odds, and Englishmen, who pay so smartly for the
honour of the alliances of our royal house with German
pauper prigs of the Battbnberg type, will not grudge her
the honouis of a victory over the money-grubbing Ger-
If, as Reynolds puts it, Bismarck and the young
tyke William schemed to put the family rule in
operation because the late Crown Princess was re-
garded as an alien, it serves them right to find
themselves badly “left.” It was a game of cut-
throat euchre, and they lost their king too early
in the play. Had they been enabled to conceal
the late Emperor’s death until an affidavit was pro-
cured declaring the Crown Prince to be afflicted
with a chronic and incapacitating disease; his wife
would have been the loser. The Emperor dying
and leaving a vacant throne before such a declara-
tion against the next heir had been obtained de-
feats the Chancellor’s purpose, and he, with the
aforesaid tyke, gets the worst'of the play. It may,
however, be all surmise and conjecture,
♦
Gillies’ Grovel.
One of tire chief distinctions between man and
the inferior race of animals is generally supposed
to lie in the fact that man, in a great degree,
shapes his own destiny, while the beasts of the
field silently fulfil the destiny which man and cir-
cumstances impose upon them. This theory has
passed muster so long that it seems now to be
placed almost beyond dispute, and accepting it as
the starting-point of our argument the question
arises whether the Imperial groveller who infests
Australia is a human being or not. By the mouth
of Duncan Gillies he says distinctly that he is
not. On behalf of himself, the other members of
the Victorian Ministry, and the people in general,
that gentleman lowers himself to the level of an
omnibus-horse in these words :
“ It is almost unnecessary to remind your Excellency
that, while these and other British colonies have no direct
voice in the contracting of treaties between the Empire
and foreign Powers, they are frequently affected by the
obligations imposed by them ; and it is, therefore, not
unreasonable to expect that, in such oases, efforts should
be made by those on whom the exercise of that power
devolves to watch over and conserve the rights and in-
terests of the colonies more immediately interested. Mr.
Gillies trusts that in the present matter her Majesty’s
Government will see fit to exercise its influence on behalf
of these portions of the Empire by endeavouring to in-
duce the Government of China to take similar measures
for preventing emigration to Australasia to those under-
stood to have been adopted at the instance of the United
States of America.”
These words form the lame and abject conclusion
of a blind, impotent, and imbecile memorandum
in reply to. the suave despatch of Ambassador
Lew. Mr. Gillies peacefully admits that Aus-
tralia has “no direct voice,” and, in fact, no
voice of any kind, direct or indirect, smothered
or otherwise, in framing or controlling treaties
by which Britain may any day involve her in
ruin, and he considers it no part of his duty to
protest against the continuance of this monstrous
state of things. He never dreams of asserting
that Australians, as human beings, have an in-
alienable right to protect themselves when the
countless millions of the yellow race threaten to
overwhelm them and blot them out. He does not
even venture to imply that he himself, as a man
and not a beast, has any claim to be heard in a
matter which involves the life or death of the
nation which has entrusted its destinies to his
quivering hands ; his one idea is that “ Her
Majesty’s Government may see fit ” to bow down
before an Asiatic heathen and ask him to be
pleased to refrain from shipping his myriads
of lepers to a land which lacks' the
spirit to protect itself from this imported
corruption. If Her Majesty’s Government
finds that it will not pay England to “ see fit ” to
move in the matter, or if the squat Manchoorian
potentate declines to listen to their appeal, the


affair, as far as Ah Gillies is concerned, will ev
dently be at an end. This is the culminatin
point of human abasement; there is no forth
depth of ignominy to which anything wearing
white waistcoat and the outward semblance of
Scotchman can descend. From the high place
which an infatuated people has raised him Gillie
calmly picking his teeth at the door of the Ath
nseuru Club, views the nation being slowly eate
up by imported vice and leprosy, and by all kinc
of moral and physical uncleanness from tl
Flowery Land ; and his remedy for these accum
lating horrors is to ask somebody 16,000 mil
away if he will see fit to ask somebody else wl
profits by all this misery to be pleased to do som
thing. And verily the groveller gets Ids rewarc
by submarine cable. Only a few days have passer
since the pathetic appeal of the trodden-on wor
was flashed across the sea, and already the answ
comes back in the shape of this message
“ The cable dispatches which have beep received iro
the Australian colonies on the Chinese question have i
ceived the attention of Lord Knutseord, the Secretary
State for the Colonies, but he is not disposed to underta
the task of negotiating a treaty with China to secure t
exclusion of the Chinese from Australia.
Gillies and Griffith and the other sons of th
Anak of servility to whom Australia has entrustec
her destinies have given away at once and forev
their claim to take any action on their own b
half—and this is all they receive in return for the
abject surrender. The miserable Scotchman an
the equally miserable Welshman both defined th
question of the expulsion of the Chinese from
Australia as lying entirely between the Britis
Government and the supreme leper at Pekin
they both virtually pledged themselves to subm
to the decision of these two wolves the ultimat
fate of the prey which both the wolves wei
equally bent on devouring ; they neither venturer
to convey the smallest hint that Australia r<
served the right to take action in her on
defence to save herself from the hopeles
ruin which follows in the track of th
yellow pestilence ; and having thus placer
their fate in the hands of England, they learn tha
England is “indisposed” to save them, and tha
they have surrendered—as far as two groveller
could surrender it by cablegram—the right to sar
themselves. Even the Hottentot or the Bosjesma
claims the right to protect himself from foreig
aggression; so does the servile Hindoo and th
Chinaman himself; so, in short, does all the wor'
except the Australian Imperial pariah, wh
stands forth in bold relief as the one man on eart
who claims no rights and possesses no semblance o:
manly dignity, and who does not know whether h
is a man or only one of the lower members of crea
tion. And the outer world, as it views his increa
ing abjectness, becomes more and more inclined
share his doubts upon this point. The sight of
white Australian bowing down before an Imperia
leper and asking mercy at his hands is sufficien
in itself to amaze a gaping world; but when th
same Australian has sunk too low to do his ow
abasement, and must needs appeal to an Englis
Tory to bow to the leper on his account, the spec
tacle is absolutely unique in its picturesque degn
dation. And the contemptuous message of th
English Tory that he is “indisposed” to take an
interest in this whole-souled grovel lends a finis
to the picture which cannot be surpassed.

His Grace the Duke.
As a writer of obituary-notices for the fine ole
English nobility, the London correspondent of th
Sydney Morning Herald certainly wears th
belt. Hear him on the late Duke of Rutland
and “if you have tears prepare to shed thei
now ” :
“The death of the Duke of Rutland removes one of th
grand figures of the old nobility ; but it is replaced b
another, for Lord John Manners, who succeeds to th
dukedom, will be as good a representative of our feuda
aristocracy as his brother. ... At Belvoir Castle, th
family seat in Rutlandshire, the Duke lived in a princel
state, which was, on one occasion, made the subject
allusion by Mr. Gladstone in the House of Commons
The beautiful grounds of the castle were always open t
the public, and the Duke, who was fond of walking abou
them himself, used to cause if to be understood that
desired no one to move out of the way in any manner bt
cause of his presence.”
Read it again, and ponder over it. The grea
Duke ! The proud possessor of an income o
£lOO,OOO, of lordly palaces and princely grounds
On one occasion made the subject of allusion by
Mr. Gladstone in the House of Commons'
“Was fond of walking about his own grounds
and used to cause it to be understood that he de
sired no one to move out of the way in any man
ner because of his presence /” The Eventn<
News, another Sydney paper, has its own little
yarn about the Duke of Rutland, and as a re
bukerof vice in high places the way it “lays'
for the Herald carries with it tidings of comfort
and joy:—
“ There is a passage in the London letter of our senioi
morning contemporary’s issue of yesterday, which for
mingling of respectable hypocrisy and tuft-hunting snob
hery has never yet been approached, and will probably
never be matched. The London correspondent of the
Herald tells a story of an early' passage in the life of the
late Duke of Rutland. He sa.vs that many
the Duke formed an attachment for a lady of very in-
ferior social rank, though his regard for ‘ the exigencies of
his exalted station ’ prevented him marrying her. Now,
if the correspondent had only stopped there, the story,
even briefly as he puts it, would form a very tendei
romance of love sacrificed to a sense of duty. But the
correspondent did not stop there. He went on to say,
still in evident admiration of the Duke’s self-abnegation
fn not marrying the lady of very inferior social rank, ‘ but
he had a numerous family by her.’ And he furthei
tells us that he severely crippled the ancestral es-
tates in order to provide for this numerous family.
And all this is told with no symptom of repro-
bation for the Duke, but with an evident and syco-
phantic admiration for his realisation of ‘ the exigencies
of his exalted station,’ which prevented his marrying a
lad.y socially inferior to him, hut did not prevent ins
having a numerous family by her, or robbing the legiti-
mate heirs of his estates in order to support that family'.
It is impossible to find words in which to fittingly
characterise this exquisitely callous description of con-
duct on the part of a duke, which, if it' had only been
that of some common and ordinary person, would have
furnished the Herald with material for a snuffling leader
on the immorality of the poor and ignoble, and would have
enabled its favourite preachers to improve the occasion
from their respective pulpits. It is evident, however,
that what is baseness and bad morals in the common run
of men, is, with the Herald, only ‘ regard for the exigen-
cies of exalted station ’ when a duke is concerned. The
duke makes all the difference.”
“ The duke makes all the difference.” That is so !
The axiom of either the S.M. Herald or the
Evening News is that to.be “accredited” is to be
unimpugnable. Respectability can dispense witli
morals and a black frock-coat is God made visible to
men. An apology for the practical blackguardism
of the Duke of Rutland (or that which would pass
as such were the duke a butcher-boy) sounds well on
the lips of the S.M. Herald, the same organ that
hanged the miserable victims —of social apathy
and social vice—concerned in the Mount Rennie
tragedy, and a rebuke from the Noose on the
grounds of morality, the paper that stood by and
greased the hangman’s rope, is alike edifying and
instructive, and is valuable evidence of the inti-
mate connection between a Colin Campbell divorce
case report and conjugal fidelity, or a narrative of
the social sins of a Dilke and chaste and anchori-
tish purity.

near Nyngan, N.S. Wales, described in the daily
press as “ a native of Scotland, and a sober, im-
dustrious, intelligent man, ” has been found guilty
of the manslaughter of a miner nanled Snow, and
sentenced to six months’ imprisonment with hard
labour. The case has parallel bearings with the
slaughter of the Bull! miners to the number of
eighty, although in the grander and wholesale
holocaust justice was stifled and the offenders
escaped. From the evidence adduced it appears
that the mine was reported upon by Mr. W. H. J.
Sr. EE, inspector of mines, as being in certain points
defective and unsafe, and Yeitch was informed that
these defects would have to be remedied at. once.
He was again warned about his mine ten months
after the previous intimation as to the dangerous-
ness of its condition; but he still took no notice.
In the month following, James Snow was instructed
to go down the shaft and sharpen some drills about
30ft. below some stalling, or staging, consisting
of logs 14in. in diameter and about Oft. apart from
each other, with strong saplings across (some of
the logs being hollow or piped) to protect the
tramway —as well as the men working below the
stages —from falling rock which might become
detached from the walls of the mine. After
Snow (the deceased) had passed through the stag-
ing, and the manhole of the staging had been duly
covered up, the manager, James Yeitch, pro-
ceeded with a crowbar to loosen a large mass of
rock in which several shots had previously been
fired, thereby displacing from four to five tons,
which fell from a height of 25ft. on to the staging.
The latter broke, and in falling, struck the deceased
and threw him on his back into the fire of the forge
—to which he was pinned by a sapling and held
down until he was almost roasted. Although the
forge was 20ft. below the broken staging and 12ft. in
a level or drive, deceased was severely burned and
through this and other injuries died in Wellington
Hospital. The local police at once took proceed-
ings against Yeitch, as manager of the mine,
and through the intelligent and efficient manner
in which the case was got up the latter was com-
mitted for trial. The judge who tried the case
informed the jury in his summing-up that mine-
owners and mining-managers were criminally
liable for culpability or negligence. He said that
human life must be protected. Mining-managers
when taking the management of a mine must take
also the responsibility of the safe-guarding of
human life in connection with their managerial
trust. We have nothing to say against this,
but why, we ask, were criminal proceedings
not instituted against the Bulli Coal Mining
Company, by the neglect of whose re-
responsible officers eighty men and boys
were sent to a hideous death? Why should it
always be so easy to obtain justice when the
offender is not fenced round by the privileges of
wealth and position ? This conviction against
James Yeitch is the first of the kind that has
taken place in New South Wales; but why is it
the first ? Is James Veitch’s act of criminal
neglect the first of the kind that has taken place
in New South Wales ? If the offender be rich,
well-connected, and socially placed, it simply
becomes impossible to get him arraigned, but
society never fails in securing the conviction
of men of the James Yeitch type, simply
because they have not friends powerful enough
or money sufficient to fight for them. Mr.
James Yeitch, patronismgly described in
several of the newspapers as a “sober, indus-
trious intelligent man ” —meaning thereby that
he is not what is popularly called a “ gentleman ”
—is punished, while the directors of the big syndi-
cate go free. This is the social creed throughout;
kick him hardest who has no friends ! Justice
is not blind in Australia ; but she suffers from
cataract when her eyes alieht on a frock-coat!

The Fate of Nigger Druitt.
The E. News unchained its moralist from the
backyard last Saturday, and grasping his pen h
wrote : -
“ A case of a horrible nature was tried before Chie
Justice Sir F. M. Baulky, at Wag-g-a Circuit Court yestei
day. It was a case in which an Australian black named
Druitt, belonging- to the camp of aboriginals at Naran
dera, was charged with having- committed a capita
offence on a child under years of age. .... Th
case was clearly proved. The prisoner did not exhibit the
slightest sign of emotion during the hearing- of the case
The jury returned a verdict of guilty of the capita
offence. The prisoner, to whom counsel was assigned
did not make any address to the Judge, and was sentencec
to death, the J udge commenting- on the enormity of the
crime briefly.
It is only one more wretched nigger being wipec
out and nobody cares a hang-. What The Bul-
letin wishes to ask,- however, is this —will the
Government of New South Wales dare to carry
out the sentence in view of the disgraceful way in
which a case of a somewhat similar nature was
smothered in the courts of the same colony not
many months ago ? In that instance the alleged
criminal was closely related to a distinguished
Judge, and on the second day of the trial the
prosecutrix got into the box and stated
that she had had “ a conversation ” with
the prisoner’s wife, and wished to withdraw the
charge. Ordinary citizens, who were not blessed
with judicial minds, assumed this to mean that
the prisoner’s wife had' had a conversation with
the witness, or, in other words, that the latter
had been tampered with and induced to aid in de-
feating the ends of justice, and many even went
so far as to regard this as tantamount to an ad-
mission of guilt. Had the prisoner been innocent,
they argued, he would have preferred to demon-
strate his innocence and to crush the perjured ad-
venturess who had endeavoured to bring about his
utter ruin, rather than stop the case wheji the vile
charges brought ag'ainst him had been proclaimed
to the world, and his defence, if he had any de~
fence to offer, remained unheard. The police, how-
ever, raised no objection (as they would probably
have done in any other case), and an astounding
compromise brought the case to a sudden and
impotent conclusion. Meanwhile, nigger Druitt
of Wagga, is going to be hanged. He wasn’t
related to any judge, and the witnesses in his
case didn’t have a conversation with his gin and
then suddenly and mysteriously back out. And
even if they had conversed with Drott's partner
in life the results wouldn’t have been likely to
amount to much. The plain daughter of a decay-
ing race would probably have offered to “ gib it
bac-ca,” provided her husband was let off, and
Don knows that argument doesn’t amount to
much in staying the fiery course of Justice, when
the blind goddess is out in search of vengeance,
The worthy body -of men who drive and stoke
engines on the Yictorian railways are vaguely
threatening to run them into the sheds and strike
work, all because they can't bear a Mr. Alison
Smith. Said Smith has no power over the men,
except in the matter of making it warm for them
if they leave undone the things they ought to
have done, &c. He can’t reduce their wages,
lengthen their hours of work, or make them
exceed their contract with the Government in one
small particular. But the Victorian Railways
were a hotbed of jobbery, labour-shirking, and
insubordination for so many years that the Civi
Service taint still lingers about the employes
sturdy engine-drivers not excepted. The:
repeated meetings to protest against some
thing or other done by Mr. Smith ar
getting nauseating, and awaken not the leas
public sympathy. There is no political influenc
at the back of this particular Smith. If he goe
beyond his duty, or falls short of it, he will pre
slim ably be ‘’sacked by the Commissioners
who are the parti-s chiefly interested in keeping
everybody up to his respective mark. Meanwhile
i. a lot of fairly-paid men contemplate exercisin
a temporary power of “ bringing commerce to
standstill ” all along of one Smith, they hac
better consider the matter seriously. Trades
unionism has its duties as well as its rights, anc
petty annoyances are not to be confounded witl
wrongs. Why, in New South Wales, there i
also a Smith who nominally superintends th
State locomotive. But the Walers don’t hold

Smith.
A LETTER, written by a New Zealander on hi

pears in a recent issue of a Wellington (N.Z.)'paper
It states that a movement ispn foot for the pui
pose of founding a colony of Scotch Crofters ii
South-east Russia. The Czar is said to be favour
able to the scheme, and a young Scotchman named
Murdoch M "Donald, who has made his fortune
m Russia, is anxious to secure several hundrec
Crofter families to take up land on his estate ii
that country. The Crofters do not wish to leave
their native land, but if they have to go they say
they will prefer Russia to Manitoba. Goo save
the Queen ! What a leaven for future Russia!
armies! W hen the Czar catches a clever
foreigner who promises to be useful, he makes a
Russian noble of him, and adds “off ” or “sky’
to his name. Murdoch M‘Donald we shall one
day hear of as M’Donaldoff— -or, possibly, as
M‘Donaldoffskye. Under all the circumstances,
we don’t much wonder at all the M ‘Donalds
being “off ’’—from Scotland.
London Figaro (which is by no means a beastly
Radical organ) publishes this story about Lord
Charles Beresford, the Prince of Wales
friend
“ It is said by the old comrades of Lord Charles Bkres-
iorti that he is ‘ a tough ’un.’ Here is a story about him
which if true, goes far to justify the conclusion. It is
said that when he was in command of the police at Aba-
media, Egypt, every morning a lot of poor creatures,
whom the police had arrested, used to be brought before
him. He’d come out smoking a cigarette, with a bri<dit,
cheery face and devil-may-care look. A wretched, half-
starved, half-naked native would be dragged up. ‘ What
has he been doing?’ asked Lord Charles. ‘ Looting the
shops.’ _ ‘ Shoot him.’ _ The poor fellow began whining,
and crying, and pleading. ‘Next!’ Lord Charles calls,
and away goes the man. Another native is hauled up by
the collar, struggling and howling. ‘ What ?’ ‘ Resistin'*-
the police.’ ‘ Shoot him.’ And so on until a dozen ot
twenty fates were sealed by this young judge, from whose
decision there was no appeal. His cigarette finished, he
went in to breakfast, his appetite being quite undisturbed
by me volleys which presently greeted his ears.’’
We have heard the cheery “ Shoot him 1” some-
where else, and not so long ago, from the lips of
another friend of the Prince of Wales. Only it
wasn t “ Shoot him ! It yvas “ Hang them /”

Mr. See, M.P., the other night quoted there-

rates to show that 20 per cent, extra will in future
be added on bran, flour, and grain when carried
on the down-journey from shipping ports. This
is more than the most rabid Protectionist would
af>k ; for by it the inland producer is not only
'■'protected against foreign producers, but he is also
protected against all farmers who do not live on
his line. A Grafton farmer would have to pay
the extra duty if he wished to send his maize, &c.
to Bathurst, because it yvould have to go via
Sydney, a shipping port. The inland farmers, by
this decision, are only pfima facie protected in
their own small local markets, but the Sydney
port is still open to be swamped by the pro-
duce of every foreign farmer in the world. A

was declined with thanks, and the high-toned
female must spend her £T6O on some other branch
of general philanthropy. A botany scholarship,
for girls who have never worn a last season's hat,
would fill a long felt want. Apropos the Aimes
is naturally indignant that this lady’s offer
was refused, and says “such limitations' exist in
the home country, without in the least degree
impairing the national character of the univer-
sities. ' Perhaps the Arous will instance a

HISTORT OF BOTANY BAY.
Macquarie went home, as was said, with
the benedictions of the poor in his ears.
There is a slanderous and blackguardly book,
published by Major Mudie —who was very
properly horsewhipped in Sydney for his
literary larrikinism —and known as the
“Felonry of New South Wales, ’ in which
the case as between Macquarie and Commis-
sioner Bigge is squarely put ; and it must be
owned that Mudie, whom we will tie up to
the triangles when his turn comes, was not
prejudiced in favour of Macquarie’s work.
“Mr. Commissioner Bigge,” says this red-
handed Witness, “busied himself, as is well
known, infinitely more in pointing out and
sanctioning trumped-up charges against the
Governor, than in ascertaining the actual
condition of the colony, which was his mis-
sion. He took every uncandid and unfair
advantage ; while the vipers and unprinci-
pled men . . . filled the ear of the com-
missioner with everything that slander could
invent or misrepresentation fashion into im-
putation upon the venerable representative
of their sovereign. The commission, there-
fore, instead of being an enquiry into the
state of the colony, was engaged in getting
hold of everything that could in any way
degrade or affect the good name of the
Governor.” So much for Mr. Bigge. Mac-
quarie’s death was attributed, by those who
knew him best, to the effect of the Botany
Bay calumnies with which he had been pur-
sued. Sir Charles Forbes, Bart., a man of
public virtue and private benevolence, pro-
nounced his eulogium in the House of Com-
mons, and his intimate knowledge of Indian
and colonial affairs Was understood to give
the weight of authoritative decision to his
high opinion of Governor Macquarie’s official
conduct.
*. • •
“So many disgraceful things have oc-
curred with regard to New South Wales,”
says this sensitive candidate for the public
horsewhipping he afterwards received, “that
it is absolutely painful to record them ! ”
And then he goes on to tell the old story
about the appointment of the first Arch-
deacon of New South Wales. Mr. Bigge had
taken out to Botany Bay as his clerk, a per-
son named Scott, who had failed in London
as a wine-merchant. This Scott was active
in collecting charges against Macquarie from
the Pure Merinos, and “ the clerk,” we are
told, “ could condescend to practices from
which the dignity of the commissioners must
have shrunk.” There were few rat-holes
into which this ferret could not enter, and
his employers were not ungrateful. An ap-
pointment was asked for him. There was
none vacant. But that was a small difficulty
while it was possible to make one. So Earl
Bathurst was persuaded to nominate Mr.
Scott, the bankrupt wine-merchant, as Arch-
deacon of New South Wales at an apostolic
salary of £2OOO per annum. Concerning
whom there is told a certain frivolous story.
Now, in those days, the editor and pro-
prietor of one of the Sydney newspapers was,
strangely enough, a pew-renter in tlie Arch-
deacon’s Church of St. James, in Sj dney.
He was moved of the Evil One to offer
certain cynical observations in his paper re-
specting the new Archdeacon ; and the
wisdom of the serpent in that reverend if
somewhat vinous person prompted him to
retaliate and scoop the offender’s pew. The
editor was served with a notice to take pos-
session of another pew “in a cold and com-
fortless part of the church.” He objected,
and was told that police constables would
be placed to keep the pew against all comers,
and any trespassers would be forthwith
ejected from the house of jirayer. Now,
the editor was the proud and happy pro-
genitor of no less than six large daughters ;
and every Sunday he made a descent in force
on the disputed dew, which had been locked
by the vinous Archdeacon and the name-plate
torn off, only to be repulsed by the constables
with their staves. At first the newspaper-man
contented himself with standing in the aisle,
in mute protest, while ‘ ‘ the delicate females
his daughters’ sat on the cold stone steps of
the altar-piece.” It must be confessed that
these proceedings lent an agreeable attrac-
tiveness to the church service ; and we
learn that every Sunday the building was
crowded by congregations that the Arch-
deacon’s eloquence failed to attract, who
trooped in to see the pantomime. It is to
be remembered that there were fewer
theatrical performances in those days than
now. But standing in the aisle soon proved
as tame and spiritless a course of conduct
for the father as sitting on the cold stone
steps, even of an altar-piece, was to
his daughters. So he excogitated a new
development, and every now and then,
when the proud Archdeacon wasn’t look-
ing, the newspaper man would swoop down on
one of his fair progeny, and, amid a whirl
of white drapery and a flutter as of apoca-
lyptic wings, the young lady would perform a
thrilling acrobatic feat with her parent’s as-
sistance, and land with more or less elegance
though always with considerable spirit on
the inside of the pew. The congregation
liked that. But the proud Archdeacon in
his scarlet pride thought this was running
the authorised performance rather close—
there were no choirs qf surpliced ladies
than !—so he had the pew decked over with
boards, held down with bars and screws to
defeat the newspaper man. That stopped
him. So he took the case into court, seeing
it Was likely to afford no more whole-
some fun, and wrung the Archdeacon’#
bosom by obtaining damages for illegal
ejection from his pew. Mr. Scott went
home then, and his spirited apostolate came
abruptly to a close.
♦ * ♦
The rule of Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.8.,
began on December 1, 1821. He was a
Scotchman, and acute. He saw that Mac-
quarie made unnecessary trouble for himself
by his conscientiousness, so he determined
to let Botany Bay have its own way. He
built an observatory at Parramatta, there-
fore, and occupied himself in keeping a
strict eye on the movements of Yenus and
Jupiter. While he followed the stars in
their courses through a narrow tube the
Pure Merinos took everything into their own
hands more completely than ever. The
old trading monopolies grew up again,
and the old atrocities, and the old squalor.
Convicts shrieked under the cat again, and
dangled on gibbets as of old ; the settlers
were exploited and robbed on the old sys-
tem, and all the miseries of the “ rum era ”
were renewed once more. And still Go-
vernor Brisbane, in his eyrie at Parramatta,
complacently surveyed the stars.
• *
Free immigration began to set in ih larger
numbers now than ever before, and as most
of those who came brought some little money
with them, they are usually described as
being of a better class than those who reached
Botany Bay up to this time. If a new

arrival could prove to the Governor his
ability to maintain five convicts for a fixed
number of years, and was prepared to enter
into a bond to that effect, he received a grant
of 500 acres of land, with a breeding cow
to each convict. For ten convict ser-
vants he received 1000 acres and ten
cows ; and so on. From this dates
the real beginning of the convict as-
signment system, though, of course, convict
servants had been assigned out more or less
from the first days of the settlement. The
demand for convict labour became so great
that “ though great multitudes were an-
nually transported from England, numbers
of free immigrants had to wait, with great
inconvenience, for convict servants with
whose labour to cultivate their lands.”
# # #
It is needless to explain at this late hour
of the day that convict service was in reality
a kind of white slavery, intensified by
all the most degrading and repulsive
features of negro slavery, but also with some
superadded horrors of its own. On their
arrival, the convicts were first drafted off
into the convicts’ depot at Hyde Park.
There applications were attended to, and
jyhite labour portioned off among the appli-
ants in their due proportions. Major
Goulburn was the Governor’s Grand Yizier
in those days, and the centre of the iniqui-
tous system at whose heart ho sat like some
ill-omened spider in its web, disposing of the
souls and bodies of convict men and women
just as he disposed of the Government
cattle and sheep. The “ impenetrable
Major,” they called him in those days,
and it can easily be imagined what an
object of awe this all-powerful official was
to the men and women whose lives lay at the
mercy of his slightest sign. His was an iron
rule. The colony was a prison, he said, and
the prisoners were to be treated accordingly.
So they were. The Major was head turn-
key, and all the duties of Custom-house
officer, treasurer, and collector of revenue
were discharged by him. He grew so
despotic and so irresponsible at last, that,
like all men who have been entrusted
with powers which prove too much
for them, he forgot his duty to his
head-gaoler, the Governor, and wanted to
dictate to him, too. The home Government
recalled both of them, and the house of cards
the “impenetrable major” had built fell
about his ears in a moment. It is quite in-
teresting to see these all-powerful Botany
Bay potentates knocked over like nine-pins
by the merest breath of Imperial authority.
Judges, governors, gaolers, even the (loggers
and hangmen themselves had to grovel
piteously when the Colonial Office spoke.
And so Major Goulburn went home, to spend
his old age in bitterly remorseful memories
of Botany Bay ; and this story knows him
Do more.
« * •
The Assignment system was actually com-
menced by Hunter, and lasted up to 1838.
It will be remembered that Phillip once
wrote of the Botany Bay settlement, that
‘ ‘ there can be no slavery in a free land, and
consequently no slaves.” These fine words
fell signally to the ground. From the
moment the assignment system was intro-
duced until the despatch was received for
its discontinuance, a form of slavery more
degrading than any Assyria or Louisiana ever
knew —more disgraceful than negro slavery
as the white man is above the black
—held its unbridled course in New South
Wales. It is startling to think that
it is not yet fifty years horrors
passed away, and that some of the persons
responsible for their existence still exercise
legislative power under the free institutions
of to-day. The convict was in the hands of
the official, body and soul. This state of
things generated a condition of cringing
servitude on the one side, and on the other
a class sentiment of authority and assertion
of superiority, both of which still strongly
survive, though the conditions that produced
them have long since passed away. So long
as a single official, trained and formed under
the old Imperial system, continues in the
service of the country, and so long as the
traditions of that system cling, so long will
these squalid traces continue to be apparent.

Nearly every large holder of assigned con-
vict servants was a magistrate. A flogger
was part of each magistrate’s retinue, and
Hip triangles were » common feature In
every well-regulated homestead. Neighbour-
ing employers honoured each other’s notes
of hand by administering a flogging to the
bearer ; and often a Worthy magistrate, in the
cool shadow of his spacious verandah, dined
pleasantly with his wife and daughters to the
music of a yelling wretch triced up to the
torture at an easy distance away.
In the book Lang imaginatively called his
history there is a description of the way the
system worked, illustrated by examples.
He takes the common case of an emigrant
settler—it is to be remembered that Lang
was an eye-witness of all these things —who
returns to his farm after an absence of some
weeks idling about the country, finds
that his servants have been idle in his
absence. He curses and swears at them
until a man who has seen better days for-
gets himself so far as to reply to his ruffianly
master. The convict is at once haled before
the next magistrate, who orders the delin-
quent to receive 25 lashes or more. As
soon as the man is fit for labour he is
put to the plough, which he takes the
opportunity, perhaps, to break on a
stump. He is sent to the chain-gang for a
term, and when that is over he escapes to
the bush, perhaps murdering his tyrant, or
setting fire to his homestead. It was so that
bushrangers were manufactured. Lang adds
that the escapees perhaps rob a settler’s cart
for food a few days after their escape, are
captured, and hanged as a matter of course.
And, speaking of his own solemn experience
as a clergyman in these cases, he further
adds that the ‘ ‘ wretched men assure the
minister who may visit them in gaol or
attend them on the scaffold, that it was the
arbitrary and unfeeling conduct of their
masters alone that brought them to an
untimely end.”
The Mesmerist’s “Subject.”
Young Jimmy Griff he roamed around
With scarce a coat to call his own,
His mortal sole was on the ground,
A creature he of skin and bone;
On doorsteps Jimmy used to doss
From midnight until breezy morn,
But patiently he bore his cross
And spoke of work with honest scorn.
At last the garment on his back
Together would no longer hold —
Misfortune’s clouds seemed thick and black,
For now the nights were growing cold ;
And Jimmy, as he skulked along,
The feelings of his heart avowed
In language that was terse and strong —
Emphatic, picturesque, and loud.
The merry birds gay carols sang
(Their notes were silv’ry, sweet, and clear),
But Jimmy, gnawed by hunger’s pang,
Those melodies declined to hear;
And creeping on with aching head,
And stomach tortured by a “twist ”
Outside a playhouse door he read,
“Professor Brass, the Mesmerist.”
“O ! joy,” enraptured Jimmy cried,
“ Fair prospects open to my view—
I guess I’ll get a job inside ”
(His way about young Jimmy knew);
«I’ve met a cove wot used to earn
Good money on the ‘ subject lay ’;
He said there wasn’t much to learn,
And mesmerists’is tidy pay.”
Professor Brass our hero saw,
And led him to a private room
(Just here the curtain we will draw,
And shroud that interview in gloom);
Enough, that Jimmy stood the test —
He didn’t heed a needle’s prick,
Cold tallow he consumed with zest,
And onions couldn’t turn him sick.
He went to sleep and never stirred
A muscle (wily Jimmy Griff)
Until the wizard gave the word
And then he grew uncommon stiff;
He sang a rousing comic song,
And dapeed with vjgour quite intense—
These frolics being all along
Of yielding to the “ influence,”
Young Jimmy Griff he roamed around
That afternoon in garments neat—
His hat was new, the bluchers sound,
In which he trod the muddy street;
when the shades of evening fell,
That playhouse door he chanced to pass —
.Tim paid his “order ” (like a swell),
‘ ‘ Admit one to Professor Brass. ”
The curtain rose, Professor B.
Came forward with a massive smile,
And said that he would like to see
Some strangers give his art a trial;
Lo ! strangers came by twos and threes
(The gaping crowd their courage cheered),
And then young Jimmy, if you please,
Walked on the stage and volunteered.
Beneath the grave Professor’s spell
Those subjects mostly went to sleep,
But off his chair our Jimmy fell
And lay in an hypnotic heap ;
The wizard pricked him with a knife,
Then stuck a needle through his nose,
And cried, “ I never in my life ■
Saw such a sweet mesmeric doze.
The sleeping Jim was stiffened straight,
And someone sat upon his chest
While in that cataleptic state-
lie stood the strain of every test j
Anon, he sang a comic song,
And danced about in dazed delight—
The idol of the gazing throng
Was Jimmy Griff that blessed night.
No more did pangs of hunger gnaw
The innards of the “subject Jim ”
(His mother wondered when she saw
What magic spells had done for him);
And when the good Professor B.
Bade all admiring friends “ adoo,”
And sailed away across the sea —
His faithful subject vanished too.
For wheresoever Brass appears,
’Tis written in the Book of Fate
Young Jim must join those volunteers
And fall in a mesmeric state ;
■Tim doesn’t spin and doesn’t toil,
The flesh upon his lazy fist
Is flabby, fat, and free from soil—
He’s Subject to a Mesmerist.

During a sitting of Sydney District Court
last week, one word from Judge Dowling was
sufficient to stop the working of a circular-saw,
which was running next door, and causing great
annoyance to the Court. In Melbourne it took a
special injunction issued by Chief Justice Higin-
botham to stop the noise made in an adjacent
carpenter’s shop. This doesn’t prove that the
Sydneyites have more respect for the law than the
Melbournites ; it only shows that the workshops
in the Freetrade city have so little to do that a
spell of a day or so makes no difference to them.

Despite the presence of eight gods and
-devil, “Venus and Adonis,” at Sydney Roya
Standard, didn’t rise on Saturday night to th
level of an artistic success. All through ou
-career we have made it a rule never to be hard o
gods when we could help it, and we have alway
■endeavoured to let devils down easily, as it is im
:possible for a man to tell what may one day
become of him, but, in spite of this, we are com
tpelled to state that some of the former would b
■dear at 3d. a quart, and if we were in the grocery
business we would give away a more formidabi
■devil with a pound of tea. “ Venus and Adonis
■was once, we imagine, rather a good burlesque
but somebody has been doing something to it
■and now not a single gleam of genius or fun islef
to gild the hollow sides of the adapter’s funeral
Some one has also been doing something to th
scenery and stage-fixings, and all through th
■evening wheelbarrows and other things, whicl
■ should have been floating in the air, kept dropping
on the tails of the gods and threatening to involve
them in destruction. A good number of these
walking Josses had evidently not had time ti
learn their parts thoroughly, and, consequently
slender goddesses with blue legs got stud
at impassioned moments and had to pause
and think, and thick gods with yellow
'legs had to gag when their dialogue failec
•them, and short gods with striped legs didn’t
-know what to say next, and long gods withou
■ any visible means of support looked as if they
wished they were safe home in bed, and amic
1 these and other vexations the slab-sided burlesque
with its horn grown into its eye, moved painfully
■on with feet of lead shod with chloroform, anc
reached the winning-post in a fainting condition
At some time or other in the dim past “Venn
and Adonis ” had possibly some visible coherence
but every semblance of this has been knocked ou
to make room for local songs, most of which th
shirtless heathen would refuse to utilise for the
purpose of half-soleing his boots, and the only
fitting end for the remains of the piece is that i
should be sent to the parish morgue to awai
identification. This action would be very rougl
on the parish morgue, but it is the best schern
that we can suggest under existing circumstances
Failing this, however, a judicious weeding proces
might be attempted with regard to the puns,
number of which appear to have been fixed up by
the original seed fool of the globe. In making
these few remarks we have endeavoured to ab
stain from derision and to exercise, as much a
possible, that spirit of charity which has sustainec
many a humble but sincere deacon when he
fell over a cow in the dark. In addition to thi
we are prepared to admit that certain good point
took place here and there. Miss Amy Horton
who represents Adonis, proved herself as usua
one of the prettiest and merriest of mortals, anc
played with a joyous vim which was calculated to
make a martyr guffaw at the stake. Miss Eva
Clements was a lovely Venus, and got through
her part very gracefully. Mr. J. J. Walsh made
;a roaring success of Ate, an ancient goddess witl
wegetable-mould on every available spot in the
boulevard of her countenance, and Mr
Will Stephens was a gentlemanly devil, anc
i didn’t look formidable only because the authoi
■ didn’t give him a chance. Miss Annetta Wilhelm
Mr. Fred Dark, and a bathing machine, were
. also conspicuous, and funny man Cremar excited
i lot of applause. The rest of the company—bar-
> ring Miss Raynham—serve as a fiendish example
■ of what may happen in this country, and if they
1 belonged to us we would exchange them cheerfully
for a singed cat, and then throw the cat into the
j placid sea.

nightly by the Fakir if Oolu and hung up on

else she is bowled through the atmosphere in in-
visible wheelbarrows propelled by viewless spirits

in the surrounding ozone till she is tired and
wants to get down, the Fakir gets in front of her
so as to conceal her from the audience, and makes
convulsive movements as though he were drag-
ging her off a nail or extricating her from a hook,
but, as it is_ impossible to suppose that a nail
could be driven into the air, this may be set
down as part of the incantation. The show
generally concludes with something with a long
name which nobody in his senses can pronoun^.

'“Princess Ida” is drawing sufficiently
well at Sydney Royal to induce the management
to extend the season by one week, and “ Dorothy”
is accordingly postponed till May 5. Although
the “ Princess ” did not absolutely carry the pub-
lic by storm at the outset after the fashion of
“ lolanthe ” and other operas, it seems to have
gradually got there to a considegable extent, and
the scenery alone is sufficient to hffid up a very
much weaker story than that of the virgin in
white who ran a ladies’ seminary at Castle Adam-
ant. It is pervaded all through by sunshine and
bright music and nice clothes and good principles,
and if, in view of the cold weather which has now
set in, they would keep hot drinks always on hand
at the adjacent hotel, there would be little in the
opera which could excite a carping spirit in the
most fastidious mind.

At Sydney Gaiety Mr. Dampier’s season
is still in process of conclusion, and will finally
conclude about the 4th of May. On Tuesday
night a large audience nearly broke their necks
trying to look at the “ Green Lanes of England,”
and this old barn-storming drama has since been
succeeded by “The Lyons Courier,” a sensation
which everybody ought to see on account of the
striking phenomena developed towards the close.
In the last act, Mr. Dampier, as the noble-minded
hero, goes to the guillotine for another man’s
crime, and at the same time he, in his other
capacity as the depraved villain, with his hair
flying loose, leans out of a window opposite and
hoots at himself and asks himself how he likes it.
He makes a pathetic speech on the scaffold, but
the effect is somewhat spoiled by the fact that he
is rolling on the floor in the garret at the same
time, drinking brandy and seeing parti-coloured
dogs, and yelling to think what a fool the
other half of him is. Then, standing on the scaf-
fold, he catches sight of himself at the window,
and points himself out as the real assassin, and
rushes in and helps to seize himself, and is
separated by the police, who tie him up and re-
lease him at the same time, and he forgives him-
self and is executed and escorted home by an
enthusiastic multitude, and goes to perdition and
lives happily ever afterwards. His dishonoured
remains are buried in an obscure grave, and he
often looks back on the circumstance and ponders
upon the mysterious ways of Providence. Few
actors have ever been privileged to be so many
things at once, and fewer still have got outside
and looked at themselves in the lofty manner
which characterises Mr. Dampier under these
aggravating conditions. On Friday Miss Lily
Dampier takes a benefit in “ The World Against
Her,” a drama which is always a success at the
Gaiety, and a, few other gaudy spectacles will fill
up the remaining week.

“ Bachelors,” by Robert Buchanan, the

nounced at Sydney Criterion for Saturday next,
and, in due course, it will appear in the bills as
“ the most successful piece ever produced in Aus-
tralia. ” At the present moment the most suc-
cessful piece is running in about 20 different parts
of this continent, and it is a different piece every
time. We draw the attention of the scientific
world to this phenomenon, and ask if they agree
with our opinion that it arises mainly through the

Melbourne reports of the recent Lieder-
tafel corroboree at Sydney were disposed to mock
at the exaggerated homage paid, by chorus and
instrumentalists, to Signora Giovanni Ameris.
In good truth there is a good deal of humbug
about this professional back-scratching, even when
it doesn’t take the form of downright imperti-
nence towards the paying public. Christine Nill-
son is particularly fond of discriminating between
“ artists ” and common folk. When she walks on
to the concert platform she just bows to the
audience, but curtseys to the chorus until one
would think she intended to sit right down.
Being interpreted, that curtsey means—lf I
reverence you because you’ve been drilled into
part-singing, what ought the world to think of
me ? The world —or as much of it as has planked
its money down for the occasion—thinks that it is
giving quite as much as it gets in return. By the
way, how would the worshippers of Signora
Ameris receive Adelina Patti ? On their heads,
probably.

Melbourne Juvenile Exhibition dispenses
comfort and joy to hundreds who couldn’t be
enticed into a theatre by pulleys. An air of pros-
perous respectability sits upon the brow of this
establishment (which has been artfully set up
opposite Prince’s Bridge railway terminus), and
the electric fountain plays every night to increas-
ing business. The splash made by this lovely-
tinted waterspout begins to be noised afar off. It
doesn t fall with a Niagara roar, but the general
effect is something richer than a jeweller’s stock
trickling down a cataract of silver with the lime-
light turned full on. Electric fountains are only
now in their infancy, and this particular one, pio-
neer in these parts, is recognised as anew factor
in the sum of Australian bliss. The Exhibition is
also providing much entertainment of an econo-
mical kind, by inducing ambitious amateurs to
sing, recite, and punish a piano in the shadowy
hope of securing a prize. Last week children
under 21 were put through their paces, and shaped
fairly well, considering. Some of the children
had talent without cheek, and others had cheek
without talent. The rest had neither. As each
competitor made her effort (boys being as rare as
bivalves in oyster soup), a clever-looking old
gentleman with a bald head wrote down some-
thing in a book. Later on some of those maidens
will get prizes, and then all the other competitors
and their friends and relatives will wonder what
the bald-headed gentleman can be thinking about,
I should like to know.

At Melbourne Princess’s the Charles Warner
boom shows no signs of bursting up, and that
vigorous artist is knocking them alike in tragedy
and comedy, one down t’other come up. This
week’s attraction is “Old Heads and Young
Hearts,” a light story of juvenile love-making
muddled and mixed by elderly meddling. Mr.
Warner, as usual, takes all the fat with airy con-
fidence and success, in the part of Lyttelton Coke,
amorous barrister. Many moons have waxed and
waned since Boucicault wrote this comedy, and
the dialogue seems not quite so smart as it used to
be; nevertheless, there is enough vitality in the
show to last over six nights. Miss Isabel Morris,
Messrs. Cates, Flemmmv and Alfred Phillips
shine brightest after the boss planet, but the cast
is woefully weak in more than one place. Next
Saturday Mr. Warner will describe his bogus palace
on the Lake of Como to the “Lady of Lyons,”
a female whom age cannot wither while Venus is
the patron saint of humanity at large. When a
girl worth a cent is taken to see the “ Lady of Lyons ”
she is generally seized with an intense desire
to share her young man’s seat, and the Triumvirate
would fill a long-felt want if they provided special
fauteuils for engaged couples. ,We know. Dear
Lady Loch and the venerable Normanby took the
young ladies and a brace of attendant sprites with
blue-faced coats to see Essie Jenyns on Saturday
night. Accordingly “fashion” filled the Bijou,
and divided its attention between Essie and Lady
L. Those distinguished ladies were enough for
one evening’s entertainment, but the “Merchant
of Venice ” was played all the same., Until to-
night (Thursday) Shylock will sharpen his little
cutlass on his expansive boot, and on Friday
the alluring Essie takes her benefit in
another play. By the way, an angry lady
writes _ to a Melbourne paper stating that
the critics have tried to crush Miss Jennings
by calling her a copyist. The Bulletin was the
first paper to draw attention to her reminiscent
style, as it was also the first to predict her popu-
larity. And the angry lady is hereby advised that
no young nobleman connected with The Bulletin
would attempt to crush Miss Jennings until she
gave him proper encouragement. “ A Ring of
Iron ” continues to do its respectable best at the
Alexandra, where the management presents a
bold front to bare benches. Considering that
orders could Vie easily printed, there is a certain
pathetic honesty about the bleak and barren
aspect of the Alexandra auditorium and maybe
virtue will get its reward when Miss Ada
Ward strengthens the company as promised.
“ Green Busnes ” developed the sere, the yellow
leaf, after one week at the Opera Rouse. In place
of that antique attraction they have revived
“Missing at "Lloyd’s,” a nautical thriller which
the Vivians have previously tried on the same
stage. The acting was only moderate before, and
now it is rather more so, but a well-conceived
shipping disaster breaks the monotony. At the
Royal, ‘‘New Babylon ” isn’t a-falling until next
Saturday, when that lively panorama of impossi-
bilities terminates in the interests of “ Mankind.”
The Coghills have got hold of some new talent,
and Clark’s Combination will shortly include two
gutta-percha strangers from America-—the Donald-

the hero in his desperation takes poison because of
his poverty. Money comes, but too late. The
man is almost up the Golden Stair, and the fel-
low who had brought the money stands and madly
writes his autograph in the sky with his walking-
stick. The house was half-stifled with emotion

“ Now the fool has got the money why the devil

“ Dorothy, ” at Adelaide Royal, is pound-
ing out her sweet songs on the kerosene-tin of
fame with such success that she will be continued
for another week. When she leaves she will be
followed by the tears of a whole city, and Dr.
Watts’ melodies about the bottomless pit will have
lost their charm by comparison. Hymns which
deal with the cheerful topic of Sheol can’t stand
against opera, which is a grievous pity when we
consider that opera is sinful and hymns about
Sheol are not. Miss May Habgood is a tower of
strength to Tommy Hudson’s combination, and
otherwise Adelaide is enjoying a little quiet

A distinguished member of the Simonseu
Italian Opera Company was married, a few days
ago, to a pretty girl whom he met casually at a
Melbourne photo, gallery, where he had gone to
get his elegant person handed down to future
generations. At the Brisbane (Q.) Opera House,
the other Saturday, a Chinkie who jogged into
the stalls, was assailed by a. perfect typhoon of
hoots and hisses from an incensed pit. Sun Kum,
however, smiled a “ no savee ” grin, and retained
his seat. The behaviour of that Chow is the real

hard-working, meritorious little band, the “ Dan

cobs up Bourke way, and the management have to

meditate an abduction. Mrs. Langtry has an
immense white lace-over-silk umbrella with a huge

a tragic Australian, was playing Othello some
time ago in Ballarat, and, on making his entrance
in the second act, he had just commenced his speech
to Desdemona, “Oh, my fair warrior,” &c., when
he saw one of the pages with her tights rather
loose, whereupon he turned round and in a voice
of thunder said, “Mary, pull up your slacks.” A
lady in the profession once thought to take a rise
out of a certain venerable actor (recently deceased)
who had married a young wife. When his son
was born, the lady jokingly asked him whom he
suspected, to which he replied, with awful
sternness, “ Voun husband, madam!” One

engaged a destitute widow with two children to
act as matron, and agreed to board and lodge the
trio in exchange for their services, and to leave
them to skirmish for clothes, pocket-money and
boots as best they could. The lady, according to
nstructions, went to take possession of her new
billet the same evening, and found herself camped
in an empty house, with nothing to eat and no
firing. Having an impression, however, that the
committee would be along shortly with some fur-
niture and some traces of board, the party roosted
for the night in the empty dwelling. But next
day also passed without anything turning up, and
another night found the matron and her on spring
desperately hungry and cold and miserable, and
pretty nearly ready to eat the committee bodily.
They spent their second night, like the first one,
on the floor, and about noon the third day one of
the lavish alleged Christians who had founded the
establishment came along. Being appeared to for
assistance, she replied that she conldn t see her
way to pay anything out of her own purse, but
that (she would lay the matter before the
committee. She did so, the matron and her
family holding out on a bone meanwhile and im-
bibing a cooling beverag'e at the pump, and the
committee resolved that until they could arrange
to lay in a table and chair their officer should be
allowed 7s. a week in lieu of board, this amount
to cover refreshments for the two children. By
the time this decision was arrived at, however,
the lady superintendent had been sleeping on the
floor for about a week, so she collected her 7s. and
disappeared. The body of well-dressed saints ex-
pressed themselves much surprised at this act of in-
gratitude, but set it down to the grasping and un-
reasonable character of the lower classes, and pro-
ceeded to advertise for a new matron.

When the late Chief J ustice Martin was
leaving Sydney for the Northern (N.S.W.) cir-
cuit, on one occasion, he got a telegram from a
young solicitor, informing him that all the leading
hotels were occupied by litigants and the relatives
of the prisoners whom he was to try, and as he
(the solicitor) was in no way concerned in any of
the cases he wished the judge to partake of his
hospitality. Sir James telegraphed graciously
accepting the invitation. Theretofore the young
attorney had not been able to get a case, and was
ignored by “ the swells, who are the chief sup-
port of the solicitor. He now announced to local
society that the Chief Justice would be his guest
during the circuit, and invited the foremost of
them to meet Sir James at dinner. The judge
ever afterwards took up his quarters at the same
place. The attorney acquired a splendid practice,
afterwards sold out, and is now senior member of
one of the wealthiest firms in Sydney.

When Victoria by the Grace writes a letter
all out of her own head she isn’t a striking success.
Here’s a faithful extract from a private note to
General Gordon’s sister Some day I hope to
wee yon again, to tell you all I cannot express.
My daughter Beatrice, who has felt quite as I do,
wishes me to express her deepest sympathy with
you T hear so many expressions of sorrow and
sympathy from abroad from my eldest daughter,
the Crown Princess, and from my Cousin, the
King of the Belgians, the very warmest. Would
vou express to your other sisters and your elder
brother my true sympathy.” There is a dull
monotony of “sympathy” about the Queens
literary effort, and enough “ express ” to satisfy a
railway time-table. Then, again, the dear old lady
undertakes to tell what she can’t express, and in-
nocently exposes the evanescent nature of Trixey’s
anguish by saying “ she has felt as Ido.” We’ll
pass the capital C for Cousin on account of the
relative’s royal rank, but giving Her Gracious the
lienefit of a doubt in that case, her loyal
subjects must admit that she is much richer
in fact than in fancy. The Queen has received
a life-long education in the English lan-
guage. Its resources have been shown to her in
reams of correspondence from accomplished pens.
She h aB conversed with the best speakers, speak-
ing on their mettle. For 50 years she has been
making voluminous entries in a diary. And with
it all Her Majesty can’t put a dozen sentences to-
gether in the style of a clever Woman. The royal
failing has been transmitted too When a pri-
vate letter of “ Tummy’s ” was published to an
admiring world it appeared that he advised Lady
Mordaunt to “ lay up ” if she had a bad cold on
her little chest. But to give him and his mamma
their just dues, they are prodigies of brain-power
compared with the Princess of Wales. That
smiling, charming little automaton is incapable
of fixing up any sort of letter without assistance.

Queensland seems to be getting pretty
weary of that eminent fall-back officer, Colonel
French, who was imported from the dear old
mother land to superintend the busted bomb-shell
department in the sultry North. A few weeks
ago this tear-and-blazes officer was bossing with
reckless valour an encampment at Lytton, when
an unwarlike circus pitched itself on a hill at some
distance. The Colonel instantly ordered the
source of public amusement to move, but the
owner of the show explained that he had rented
the ground from a gentleman with a freehold title,
and he didn’t know why he ought to go. Then
the wrath of the War Department rose to fever
heat, and a body of troops were sent to tear the
circus to shivers, and throw the wild beasts and

sawdust into the Brisbane River. The northern
papers are now remarking what a tail their mili-
tary cat has got to be sure, and the public in
general are asking what a Naval Defence scheme
and a whole squad of Imperial officers would be
like when one poor miserable colonel goes about
destroying circuses and wild-beast shows in this
fashion. The average British officer has got too
much sass for any white man to tolerate him, and
the one article of his military faith is that the
“blasted kawlonial” was made to be trodden
upon. The fact that the “blasted kawlonial”
doesn't share this opinion is the rock ahead for
Australian Imperialism.

A rev. gentleman (Anglican), who for
many years has not had a very happy married
life, was, a week or so ago in Sydney, ordered to
pay 15s. a week towards his wife’s support. He
couldn’t have been punished enough, though, for
now-Jehovah has taken the matter in hand, and
sent along a wind which has blown down his
church-steeple and whipped off a slice of the par-
sonage.
The town of Coleraine (Vic.) is haunted
by a strange uncanny mystery which has shaken
society to its very base. One bright pleasant
morning last week, just as the radiant sun arose,
the family of one of the leading citizens was
aroused to sudden excitement by a sound of wail-
iri)g arid,, hooting, from the. recesses of the water-
tank, ih'e leading; citizen hastened to the spot
Carrying the poker with him on general principles
lest a burglar should have broken into the water-
supply, and cautiously looking into the fountain
he discovered a beautiful young lady of about 18
who was trying to climb up the interior of the
tank with her nails. Not to put too fine a point
upon it, it was his eldest daughter. She had her
best frock on and looked as if she had been stand-
ing in four feet of water for several hours. Being
hauled out, she assumed an attitude of re-
serve and declined to make any affidavit
as to the reasons which led to her being
in a tank when she might reasonably have
been expected to be in bed, and a coolness
now exists between her and her pa in consequence.
The circumstance has naturally created a_ senti-
ment of profound distrust throughout the district,
and many once happy homes are now over-
shadowed by a fear on the part of the male
adult taxpayer that he may come home to find
his wife mysteriously on the roof and his off-
spring unaccountably stuck in the stove-pipe.
A general feeling pervades the town that a
tank is not the right place in which to find a
pretty girl in her best frock at an early hour in
the morning, and if this sort of thing is not
stopped it may end in the Governor’s wife being
found roosting among the hens at 2 a.m.. and the
Premier being discovered sitting on the coals.
Society, therefore, demands an explanation. The
customs of civilised nations are not to be trodden
underfoot with impunity, and Coleraine has re
solved to resist to the bitter end anything that
looks like a return to the barbarism of our remote
ancestors. Not that our remote ancestors were
actually given to standing in tanks at
daybreak, or that they had any tanks
to stand in either then or at any other
time—in fact, history furnishes only the most
meagre records about our ancestors having been
found standing anywhere, and when they were
found under any circumstances at all they gene-
rally seem to have run away ; but Coleraine is
resolved to resist on general principles, and unless
that young lady is prepared to explain herself
her status in society will be seriously endangered.

A certain Rev. Gray Dixon says that ‘‘ so

At the church service at one of the
N.S.W. hospitals for the insane, a female patient
who was present began to get noisy. The attend-
ants, to quieten her. told her that the new doctor
would be angry with her if she made a noise. She
immediately jumped up on the seat in the middle
of a prayer, and pointing at the new doctor afore-
said, who was of a fair, not to say carrotty
aspect, yelled out at the top of her voice : “ The
new doctor ! That’ ginger-whiskered apothecary !
Who cares what he thinks ? ” Exit, having nine

Poor old Kaiser William has sunk very
low. When he was alive he was a grand old man
on a portable iron bedstead, and if he hadn’t been
so fond of eating hot buttered crab he might have
been with us yet. Now he is dead, and every
artist in texts and devastation all over the known
world feels called upon to preach about him at
intervals. One Melbourne parson in particular
was moved to make the following deep obser-
vation :
“ The Emperor’s life is an illustration of the three
following facts: —1. That there are some lives which an!
short lived, and are liable to be destroyed by frost in their
very infancy. 2. Others, again are liable to dissolution at
a ripe old age. 3. All persons, whatever their age or
social standing, are equally amenable to death.
We have often noticed the same thing ourselves.
A great many people die a lot younger than
others, and we have frequently remarked with
emphasis that they don’t all die at the same time,
Some remarkable people, too, we believe, aren’t
born, and many wonderful events don’t happen.
Some of them, however, are more liable to happen
than others, and others again are less so, and by
striking an average between these two classes of
circumstances that aren’t there' it becomes possible
to ascertain why some circumstances are equally
probable with others. Some people, too, are more
liable to be born than others, which remark also
applies to hogs. As a rule, only dead people go
to heaven.
* * *
The dunderheaded preacher continues to
wander round on his two feet looking for the
"hand of God,” by which he means the brick
which hits anybody’s head except his own. A few
weeks ago the little town of Norsewood (N. Z.) was
cleaned off the face of the earth, in common with
several other small settlements, by a stupendous
bush-fire, and a fluent slogger in the vineyard at
once wrote to the N.E. Methodist on the sub-
ject
With regard to the real cause a¥ the fire, 1 look upob it
as a judgment from (Jod for the Wickedness of the people,
who have refused to repent after having heard so much of
God’s words, although, thank <Jod, there are a few god'-
fearing people there. About four years ago the Norse-
wood people by their votes closed the hotel in the township
and three others in the district. Only a week before the
fire the people voted to open the hotel again, and did so
with much joy. If others cannot see or will not see Clod’s
hand in this calamity, 1 can see it, and I know the people
well, having been acquainted with them for nearly Id
years. May this visitation be a warning he* only to
Norsewood but to the whole colony.
The present writer is not profanely inclined,
but there are two or three points in these remarks
which seem to call for comment. According to
the N.Z, Methodist's theory, Providence was
aiming at one common little public-house, an'd had
to tear up an entire district to get at it. Now
one ordinary white man, even when he is drunk,
can generally hit a public house at the first shot,
and does it stand to reason that a sober
Providence is a worse shot than a tight
sinner? The “hand of God,” according
te the parsonical sniveller, is a lumbering
machine which has to squash a whole city in order
to get at one small boy who stole a marble oU
the third Tuesday in last month. And when this
stupendous squash has been accomplished Ah'd a
thousand people have been wiped oUt, the local
preacher, as the man who giVßs Providence the
straight tip every Sunday, can tell at the very
first try that the V.'liole catastrophe was got up to
shatter the particular sinner on whom his epis-
copal eye is fixed, and that the other 999 land-
grabbers, usurers, swell thieves, hypocrites, pawn-
brokers, and the like were the innocent victims of
this wretch’s depravity. In private life the cleric
in question may not know a horse from a cow, but
as long as the ink holds out he can divulge thv
ways of Providence till further orders. Ac oltfeii
as not he is not sufficiently intelligent to Wash A
dog, but, all the same, he is ready to expound the
hidden causes of earthquakes and to show hoW the
Supreme Power founded a new volcano and
wrecked a whole province in its wrath at the eVil
conduct of some mute, inglorious yokel of whom
nobody had ever heard so much as the name.
These sorts of things are making the world tired,
and the parson is falling into oblivion. A man
who knows so much and does so little with it is a
nuisance of the first magnitude.

Kentucky (U.S.) has views about A neW
divorce law. The attention of Imperial Federa,
tionists, people who have married a decfeAs'ea
wife’s sister and other moralists is invited to the
following measure now before the State Legisla-
ture :
“ Marriage is prohibited and declared void with an
idiot, lurtatic, paralytic, pauper, vagrant, tramp,
drunkard, gainbler, rake, felon, feeble-minded person, or
any person rendered physically helpless and unfit for the
inarriage relation by malformation, misfortune, accident,
or any vicious cause or habit of life, or any
person who is at the time of applying for license to
marry, or has been within one year next preceding such
application, either the keeper of, or an inmate, or visitor
to, any house of ill-fame, or any person who, having been
once married, has been divorced for any of the causes
aforesaid.”
Victoria, by the grace of God, who so recently
vetoed the N.S.W. Divorce Bill, might study this
little programme with advantage, and Alexander
of Battenberg, has already one wife and yet
proposes with the approbation of the above-men-
tioned monarch to take another, might also
peruse it with prayerful attention. The worst of
the proposed law is that it is rather too compre-
hensive. No member of the British royal family
could get legally married in Kentucky, for if he
wasn’t brought up with a shock for being a rake
lie would be superannuated as a feeble-minded
person, idiot, lunatic, or victim of age,
disease, cold feet, or general stupidity, and even
if he ran the gauntlet of all these conditions he
would probably be blocked on a charge of liquor
or over-corpulence. Two-thirds of the present
N.S.W. Ministry would be incapacitated for
domestic joys under this Act, and about four-
fifths of the remaining third would be held over
for consideration while the fate of the other fifth
would be doubtful. Half the Imperial Federa-
tion League, too, would be prohibited from seek-
ing the love of woman, and but if we go on
we may be betrayed into personal remarks.

rise early enough to attend the divine plate on
Sunday morning, and accordingly the “cawse”
wilts. So he howls for reform, and suggests that
employers “ keep open late on Wednesday night ”
instead ! For a piece of touting this is sublime.

The omission on the part of the German
authorities to call to the aid of the present Em-

of national littleness. In this connection it is in-
teresting to note the case of Louis Bert heme, a
Parisian wine-seller, who has not only no larynx
and enjoys the most perfect health, but is able
also to attend to his business as well as he ever
did, can speak, can eat and drink, without discom-
fort. He is 37 years of age, and in 1885 suffered
from throat-ulceration. Tracheotomy was per-
formed in February, 1886, by Dr. Bean, and 14
days afterwards, to Bertheme’s intense relief, his
larynx was removed. He has now been two years
without any larynx with the excellent results
abovementioned.
The Very Rev. William Corbet Le Breton,
Dean of Jersey, died in London a few weeks ago.
He will be remembered solely as the father of Mrs.
Langtry. He had a curious life, - and the pages
would glow or blush which told a tithe of his ad-
ventures. He had the same strange beauty of
faceand figure that belongs to his famous daughter.
He was tall, stately, muscular ; a most imposing
figure. Mrs. Langtry, with that keen eye for an
advertisement which has made her a successful
actress, exploited him in recent years in a most
amusing way. When she was on a provincial tour
in England, she used to go about during the day
with her father, the dean, dressed in gaiters and
spotless clothes paid for out of her own purse.
This produced an excellent effect—especially in the
cathedral towns.

eternal salvation is to be convicted of the most
fearful of all crimes and to be sentenced to death.
Dr. Cross, the Cork prisoner, than who no more
cold-blooded monster ever went to the scaffold,
has furnished the latest example of this truth. He
did not, indeed, make a last dying speech and con-
fession, proclaiming his own spiritual contentment
and exhorting mankind to follow his blessed ex-
ample, but he left a will which bestows not
only his goods but a great deal of valuable moral
on his family and friends, hopes that his
children will be trained in the Protestant faith,
and winds up with the expression of his profound
conviction that the “Bible, pure and simple, is
the true religion.”
When the present Emperor of Germany
was married to the Princess Royal of England,
the boys of Eton demonstrated the great overflow of
their enthusiasm and their utter want of employment

The sweet girl of the occasion is now an Empress,

Thither he led their Ohownesses, and, saying
“the staff, gentlemen!” waved his- hand to
Donald Dinnie, Professor Miller, Slavia, Cos-
tello, Victor, &c., &c. The yellow visitors were
much impressed and surprised to find so many

The life of a woman of ton is a pitiful affair.
By her literature shall you know her, and this,
from a Sydney paper, is her literature ;
“ I think, perhaps, the ‘5 o’clock system’ may be per-

tea of different strengths and qualities, which, taken at a

tissues."
Fancy the mothers of the Spartan warriors sip-

pewter and watching the barmaid between whiles.
The results of this blessed meditation appear in
a recent leading article in Sydney D.T.
“ The lives of some barmaids are examples of unrecorded
heroism. A girl who .. . . stands behind a bar from
morning till midnight, putting- up with the drivelling im-
pertinences of soft youths and others ivho ought to know
better,' represents a sample of human nature that Dr.
Jefferis ought to be proud of.”
We- agree with the D. T. for once. Pastor Jefferis
ought to take the barmaid to his ample bosom,
and press one of his cooling sermons to her fevered
brow. Further on we read that barmaids are
often “ some of the very finest specimens of human
creation.” We agree with that too. Alas, that
it is impossible to say the same of deacons !
Mr. Smith, Liberal member for Dundee,
when addressing the electors of that city, said :
“ The Tory Government in Ireland were trying to
punish boycotting as a crime. There had always been
boycotting. The Jews boycotted the Samaritans, and
were themselves boycotted ever since. There was plenty
of boycotting in England at the present time ; there were
districts in which a man could not carry on business un-
less he joined the Primrose League and wore its badge.
Stv Paul told them not to keep company with covetous
men, revilers, extortioners—not even to eat with them.
If St. Paul said that in Ireland the Tory Government
would give him a month on a plank-bed for it. They
would steal his cloak and tell his gaolers to strip his
clothes from him. And what would St. Paul say to that
He would turn round and say to Balfour what he said to
the High Priest Ananias : ‘ God shall smite thee thou
whited wall’ ”
A possible extract from the future Scrip-
tures of Australia
“ Fan Tan, the Chinese Governor, roasted a fat pig, and
set it up in the Sydney Domain, in the colony of New
South Wales.
“Then Fan Tan the Governor sent to gather together
the market-gardeners, the tea-hearers, and the cabinet-
makers, the torturers, the washermen, the kidnappers,
and all the rulers of the opium-dens, to come to the dedi-
cation of the pig - which Fan Tan the Governor had set up.
“Then a leper cried aloud, To you it is'commanded,
O free-born Chinamen, and Australians which are their
bond-slaves,
“ That at what time ye hear the sound of the tom-tom,
tin-kettle, and all kinds of music, ye shall fall down and
worship the fat pig which Fan Tan the Governor hath set
up.
“Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the
sound of the tom-tom, tin-kettle and all kinds of music,
they fell down and worshipped the fat pig which Fan Tan
the'Governor had set up.
“And when they had worshipped, it came to pass that
the Imperial Federation League, which were bond-slaves,
did anoint the fat pig with oil, and Fan Tan the Governor
set them free.”
A drover “shouting” for his camp was
asked if he preferred Irish or Scotch whisky, and
replied that it was immaterial. The blackf ellow of
the camp, when asked, “ What’s yours ?” said,
“ Oh ! gib it the bloomin' immaterial, too.”
A good yarn is being told about the Rev.
Alexander Marshall, rssently imported to. supply
a long-felt want at the notorious Scots’ Church,
Melbourne. In his bachelor days, Mr. Marshall
was hunted up by a leathery spinster with a
“front” —natural and artificial. This antique
Venus worked her chair close to the good-looking
parson’s, and said she had received a divine reve-
lation by night; advising her that she was to be-
come Mrs. Marshall. The elected one ran his
critical eye over his “ mash,” and told her straight
that he didn’t intend to move in the matter until
the Almighty mentioned it to him. The neces-
sary revelation never came off, so Mr. M. planked
his affections on something more pleasing. At
this point the yarn terminates, and the fate of the
leathery spinster is shrouded in gloom.

There are about 1000 electors on the East,

promised to immediately amend !
While ex-Judge Sir William Manning was

In the Hobart Mercury, a paleolithic

alluded to the little man from Cork as “Mr. John
Haynes, member for Orange. ” How many a shaft

The Queensland monopolist has a near way
of disfranchising obnoxious employees. On one of
the sugar plantations there were about one hundred
men who declared against Griffith, and intended
voting for the Opposition candidate. These hun -
dred men were removed the other day to a remote
plantation belonging to the same person, and will
thus be unable to vote at all.
Psalmyell Griffith and his lieutenant,
Bulcock, says the Cairns Chronicle, are the only
property-owners about Queen-street, Brisbane,
whose tenements are let to Chinese. Naturally
enough, therefore, Griffith isn’t quite so sure about,
the expulsion of the Chows as MTlwraith is. If
the latter carries the day Griffith will lose a high
weekly rental and a reliable tenant.
Lord and Lady Carington have gone to Nor-
folk Island. Were the rusting gyves in that one-time
hell-on-earth endued with life, there is not among
them any which could tell of a more shocking Gi-
nn justifiable deed committed in the name of
British law and justice than the deed by which
Governor Carington has irrevocably damned his
name for all time in his capacity as an adminis-
trator of the Crown’s last remaining prerogative.
Apropos of the N.S.W. member for Mait-
land, Thompson, insisting the other night upon
Mr. M‘Elhone’s words being taken down and then
not knowing what to do with them, Mr. Speaker
Onslow, of the British Commons, frequently
threatened to “name” a member if any disturb-
ance arose. “Sir, sir!” he would exclaim, “sir,
I must name you.” On one occasion he was asked
what would be the consequences of putting such
a terrible threat into execution. “The Lord in
Heaven knows,” he replied, “ I don’t.”
Alfred Miller alludes to the Australian
natives who recently welcomed Purves to Sydney
as “exiled protectionists.” Apropos, the reason why
Alfred Miller is a Freetrader of the intense
Haynes’ brand of Freetrade is because he himself
is ail “exiled protectionist.” He was “exiled”
at last election from South Sydney, where he first
posed as a “ protectionist ” and then went dog on
his party through paltry personal spite. There's
no zealot for a new cause like your renegade from
an old one. A traitor is compelled to show his
ardour for the cause of his new masters.
Dr. Langridge, of Georgetown (Q.), has
discovered a black leper who has had one of his
hands and both of his feet rotted clean off by the
awful disease, communicated to his camp by
Chinese—the loathsome wretches whom Parkes
“ prefers to Protectionists.” And here we would
remark that in that Parkesian preference is a
statement of the whole issue between Parkes (the
importer of nigger compositors) and the Aus-
tralian party. His crowd say in their hearts :
Let us have slave-labour, or, in default thereof,
the products of slave-labour ; the National party
say : “ Australia and all the work required in it
for the Australians.”

The Archbishop of Canterbury—a meek and
lowly Apostle, with a penchant for giving garden-
parties to dukes and duchesses —has made a
pilgrimage to the East End of London, in order
to gain some practical notions of real poverty, and
how to suppress it in a Christian way. After
talking the matter over with several members of
the aristocracy, the Archbishop comes to the con-
clusion that early matrimony is at the bottom of
the trouble. Young men in the courts and alleys
get married before they have means to support a
proper establishment. The Archbishop was given
to Understand that hundreds of fathers of families
in the slums possessed no freehold or leasehold
property, and didn’t comprehend the meaning of
tile term “ balance at the bank.” And the painful
results of these hasty and improvident unions,
said the Archbishop, “made his blood run cold.’’

A certain N.S.W. gold-mining company
always gets a big yield for the month immediately
preceding the annual meeting. During the other
months the results recorded are most unsatis-
factory, but the manager, somehow or other, in-
variably contrives to scratch up some encourage-
ment just as the directors think of winding up the
concern. A well-known speculator gave notice at
last annual meeting that ha would move that in
future “the annual meetings, being so satisfac-
tory, be held every month.”

For a long period a neglected inland
N.S. Wales parson had to subsist on a collection-
plate of wretched threepenny-pieces. A few
months ago the local bank-manager was elected a
churchwarden, and now, when the plate circulates,
the elect, whose intense respectability prevents
them from dumping down coppers with a blood-
curdling thud, always give, when they give anything
at all, not less than sixpence per head. The cause
was, of course, assigned by the parson to “the
goodness of Divine Providence.” To the money-
changing churchwarden, however, this happy
alteration is really due : he sent all the three-
penny pieces, when banked, on to the head-office
in exchange for larger coinage. Now, if you
shook the town upside down you would not find
in it one threepenny piece.

In Scotland, we read, 157 post-offices are
in houses licensed for the sale of liquor—viz., 28
inns and 129 grocers’ shops. Now, suppose Post-
master-General Roberts, 0.M.G., who made his
fortune in a public-house, carried to its logical
issue the present N.S.W. system of conveying
newspapers free by post, so as to make it include
free postage of bottles of gin, rum, or whisky ;
and simultaneously the Scotch system of post-
office-cw-m-grog-shanty were encouraged, what a
gorgeous future would this not open up for the
speculative publican ! “Go to the mail-bag and
get a bottle of schnapps,” will be the bonifacial
command of the future, and the demijohn of
Bourbon will be divested of its postage-stamp and
robbed of its address, and diverted into the in-
terior of the profane and ungodly.

H. R. Harwood is now in Sydney in dis-
guise—behind a full beard. Which reminds one of
that old time when Harwood and Marcus Clarke
drew the polished rapier on one another. Marcus
wrote an article in the Melbourne Herald, in
1874, saying that the local Theatre Royal people
were about to “select the Princess of Trebizonde
for mutilation, ” i. e. , to produce it at Melbourne
Opera House; whereupon Harwood and Co.
brought an action against Winter and Co., and
got id. damages. At the trial, Marcus avowed
the authorship, and admitted that Harwood had
asked him in the street if he had written the
article complained of, and he said “No.” Justice
Barry, before whom the case was tried, was very
severe on Clarke for this denial. He said that
Marcus’s duty on the occasion was to say to Har-
wood, “You are an impertinent fellow to ask me
such a question. I leave you without giving you
an answer.” Higinbotham, who defended, said
that Clarke might just as well have admitted the
authorship as talk in that way. While this
“ barney ” was going on, Clarke slipped round to
the Public Library and got Boswell’s “Life of
Johnson,” and pointed out to Higinbotham the
passage where Samuel told Boswell that the author

of the letters of Junius would be perfectly justified
in denying the authorship. Hig. read this to
Barry, but Sir Redmond said he didn’t look on
Johnson as an authority on morals, the doctor
having declared that Prior’s poems ought to be in
every lady’s boudoir.

An article in Fairplay of 17th February
has caused much joy in Australian shipping
circles. It relates to “ Daniel Quilp,” the well-
known captain of a popular Australian liner, and
goes for Daniel thusly :
“ It happened that Daniel commanded a transport
during the war in Egypt, for which, like other com-
manders, he received two medals. Each coat he pos-
sesses has tlie ribbon carefully attached. ‘ What decora-
tions do you wear may I ask ? ’ enquires a lady. ‘ For
service in (!) Egypt,’ calmly replies Daniel. Everything
that is done on board the steamer commanded by Quilp
is, according to him, done by himself. Here is a speci-
men of the conversation at breakfast. After the usual
morning salutations, I ask, ‘ Shall we make a good run
to-day, do you think ? ’ ‘ Well, about three ninety. I
should have done more but I don’t want to “ drive ” just
now,’ answers the infallible. ‘ Particularly good, this,’
observes my left-hand neighbour, who is assiduously get-
ting the last scraps of a grilled bone. ‘ Yes,’ remarks
Quilp, ‘ I insist on it that no man afloat has better cook-
ing than I have.’ After a variety of _ topics my wife, who
sits opposite, says. ‘ W T e are all longing for a dance, Cap-
tain Quilp ; when do you think we shall be able to have
one ? ’ ‘ To-morrow night probably, and I can assure you
that before we get home I’ll give you half-a-dozen of the
best balls you ever attended.’ ”

On a North Queensland goldfield situated
in that auriferous Faraway which lies beyond the
alligator-line, the Government is represented by
one belated official and two policemen. The
official acts as magistrate, registrar of cradle,
altar, and tomb items, gold-warden, clerk of petty
sessions, to say nothing of being the petty ses-
sions himself, inspector of stock, collector of dog-
assessments, municipal council, divisional board,
marsupial board, educational board, several other
boards, and chief of police ; and at times he is
liable to lose himself amid these multifarious jobs
and doesn’t know exactly what function he is on
at the moment. More than once he has _ given a
certificate of death to a drank and then fined the
weeping survivor, at other times he has sued a
dog for non-attendance at school, and has issued
a stern order that a child should be destroyed for
not wearing a collar with the name of the owner
legibly inscribed thereon. But the worst scrape
of his life was achieved last month. He was en-
gaged in hitching a couple together in the
bonds of joy, and had got half through
the ceremony, when the senior - constable
urged him to come along and fine a
drunk. The junior private ofj the force
was holding the prisoner outside, and as the
sinner was in a violent state and there was no
place to put him in, it was necessary that he
should be summarily dealt with. So the Registrar
told the semi-attached couple to hold on a minute
while he annihilated the criminal, but when he
came back he discovered, to his horror, that they
had departed on their honeymoon. This, as the
functionary sadly remarked when he began to re-
cover from the shock, was a stupendous go, and,
feeling that his billet w r as at stake, he despatched
the senior policeman in one direction and the
junior in another, with orders to capture the pair
at all hazards, and bring them back that they
might be legally and morally hitched. But they
were not to be found. The large, moist constable
tore through highways and byways, and up hills
and down dales, and the smaller and drier officer
dashed through hotels, and gullies, and swamps,
but the half-married couple had vanished as com-
pletely as if they had been properly married or
earth had swallowed them. It was late at night
when the wearied and clammy chief officer gave
up the search, and plodded back to report him-
self, and as he turned into the solitary street of
the town he Came on a drunk woman and a still
drunker man, who were heaving bricks and
screaming at the general public. It was the
bride and bridegroom enjoying their honeymoon.

At the Mayor of Sydney’s recent welcome

It is the custom in all English houses for
a servant of the house to come in and take away a
guest’s clothes on his retiring to bed, bringing
them back neatly brushed and folded before he
gets up in the morning. This custom also pre-
vails in the leading Sydney clubs, and thereout
arose the following trouble. A gaunt Barcoo
squatter, newly made a member of the Pure
Merino Club, went to the races and won a heap of
money. He got paid on the course and slept that
night at the Club. Early next morning he woke
and happened to cast his eyes to the cnair where
he had left his clothes, but they were gone, not a
rag of them left, and all his money in the pockets !
“ Holy smoke !” he moaned—“ cleaned out! not a
stitch left! this is pretty sultry in a place like
this—l thought it was a swell club, and here lam
gone through, like it was a bush shanty. ” Then
he rang the bell wildly and told the waiter of his
loss. That individual never smiled—club-waiters
get used to strange things—and he explained the
circumstances. Then the back-blocker promised
the waiter a sovereign not to say anything about
it, and retired to bed again to wait for his clothes,
which came to hand without a threepenny-bit
missing.

A Catholic priest in Southern N.S.W. has
just been very hard hit. At Easter it is usual for
the congregation to subscribe liberally towards
the maintenance of Father M‘Gillicuddy. On the
present occasion the official collector was unable
to attend, and a simple-minded Irishman was good
enough to undertake the duties. When Mass was
over, and the congregation had gone olf to dinner,
the pastor enquired concerning the liberality of
his flock. He was paralysed to find that the
wooden-healed tyke who collected had deposited
every sixpence in the hospital-box in mistake.
His reverence, however, said nothing, but the
hospital trustees are still wondering why the
R.C.’s were so very charitable this Easter.

“ Richard Harris, died Feb. 13,1877, of
delirium tremens, aged 41 years.” This is the
inscription which an Atchison (Kas.) woman had
carved upon her late husband’s tombstone—a
shaft of granite whereon sits a big black dog and
about which is wound from base to apex the
image of a snake as large as a man’s arm.

The synod of the Church of England is
now sitting in Sydney, and, to most people, it is
a marvel how they ever make the clergy stop
talking when once they get fairly going. How-
ever, it is done, and in this way. As soon as a
cleric has occupied the floor for a fair time and
shows no signs of stopping, the Bishop begins to
scrape his feet about on the floor and to clear his
throat very loudly. The Bishop’s feet make a
row like a garden-roller going over a gravel path,
and the hopeless parson always makes a hurried
and lame conclusion. But for this method a
synod would last a million years.

Some few years ago two prominent Jewish
citizens of a Western (N.S.W.) township resolved
on a trip to Sydney, and took their way to the
railway station with their wives and their children,
also their ox and their ass and their portmanteaus
and the rest of their belongings. One of them
was probably named Cohen and the other might
reasonably be called Moses. A crowd of citizens,
most of whom had a hereditary grudge at pork,
were present to see them off, and Moses laid down
a bulky carpet-bag in order to shake hands all
round. As he did so a long, low wail came from
the entrails of the bag, and a sudden scare spread
over the platform. Moses was obviously remov-
ing a surreptitious infant from the township and
Cohen was helping him in his inquity. There was
a louder wail and a longer one. Moses turned
ashen pale and fled 100 yards from the trunk, and
Cohen assumed the hue of an unhealthy vegetable
in the spring. Their friends fell away from them.
Mrs. Moses and .the little Moseses gave way to
tears, and the Cohens—ll of them—collapsed
against the wall in a fainting condition. _ J ust at
this crisis Sergeant M'Faggart made his appear-
ance and collared Moses, w r ho was in a pitiable
state, and then, holding his prisoner with one hand
lie opened the bag with the other. One wild
scream issued from the lower part of it as he did
so; then there was a moan, a profane' swear, a
sound as if someone was taken bad on the cold deck
of an ocean steamer, and a silence which might
be inspected with the naked eye supervened. A
tooth-brush and a night-shirt were strewn on the
platform by the relentless policeman, but there
was nothing else to be found and he reluctantly
let go his hold of the back of Moses’ neck.. Then
the train came along, and Fred. Millis,_ ventrilo-
quist, got on board to accompany the wilted Heb-
rews to town and amuse them on the way,

We rise to draw attention to an odious
insinuation in bricks and mortar. Near the

Then into bed he rolled
But, if he dreamt of what he’d seen,
Yon bet his blood ran cold.

My Dear MdO rap.ix da , —Lord and Lady Caririgtdri have
betaken theiriscives to Norfolk Islarid, a place \Vhere
(this, I airi told, is really true) thefe is ridt one solitary
person named Smith; Last Friday flight his Lordship
Presided at the animal toeetirig Of the Sydney Yourig
M'outert’s (jhristiriri Association, an organisation which; I
rim told, he took a chief and enthusiastic part iri Iduridirig
in England—it is said, indeed, that his rimUdris labours iri
this fnily riohle \Vovk had. ho stoall share in making - it
ibkdiutel,V r
iflildei ahd less tryirig attoospheve of Australia. It is
lrideed nice to find hiui still pursuing the satoe path df
public usefulness which when in the dear old toother
country he so assiduously trod,
It is ruriiorired that Lady Caririgtom, while at Norfolk
Island, ihterfAs negotiating an extensive etoigration of
scio'ris of the British aristocracy to the old cdrivict
‘fristrieks.. Norfolk island—about Which I have full iri-
fdrtoaiion front an official who was lately there—is h
Sleepy old place where the inhabitants Are Sd good that
they respect everything, evrin those d£ the nobility who,
because they battle Iri with the 'Conqueror, Always get
theif hdal-d tree at Government Bouse. There L a strong
and avdur of old-time England attached to it yet. The nrime
of the chief toagistrate; foi - instance, is Seytoour Buffett,
the first half df which is most comforting ; and, as another
niaterial advantage, the stranger who marries an island
girl, and settles down in her country, gets 12 acres of
land given in. This, I aril afraid, is a good deal
more than is possessed by toost of tlie peers who visit us
ill these dL s, Arid the descendants of the Crusaders
Wight do Worse than settle down orijhis little spot of land
to grow onions arid kill pigs. But however tlie emi-
gration scheme niay turn out, there can be little doubt
that Lady Carington will enjoy her visit. The simple-
minded islanders wear boots that are obviously home-
made, and other things to mated, arid they are
prepared at all times to fall dovrii and worship a
lovely presence with nice clothes and pretty hair;
and amid these stlrrdundings Lady Carington’s joy-
ous smile will he seen like a ray df sunshine. Her gentle
Influence, tdo, Will elevate the'native clod and make him
Aspire after higher thirigs, and she will leave her foot-
print upon the institutions of the island even as Bis
Excellency leaves his yawn behind him in the theatre.
There has been much heartburning among people who
were omitted front the irivitations to the recent entertain-
ihents At Sydney Goverritoent House, hut 1 am sure.it is
childish to hlatoe Lord Carington; for he leaves such
iriatters to Mr. Wallington, and Mr. Wallington leaves
them to his assistant, and the assistant probably leaves
them to the butler or the assistant-fqotmari ; anyhow, I
am quite certain that the Prince of Wales’ crony doesn’t
lie awake worrying himself lest by an oversight Mrs. Job-
kiris, df the pulilic-house', should lie affronted. But no
‘dverisight c4n ppssibly take place with regard to.soule
people. For iflstafloe, I aid told that Lady Carington was
greatly airiused the other day by the “push” of a fat and
ferirful person in a purple dress and a green bonnet, who
wears kiss-curls and constantly gives great vulgar enter-
tainments attended only by people who, after eating - and
drinking and dancing, go off and talk about their hostess.
This good lady waddled up to the Governor's wife with :
“Oh, dear Lady Carington, how well you are looking!
By the way, I am sure Mr. Wallington must have made a
mistake. He hasn’t sent me a ticket for the ball, and yet
I have called regularly.” Lady Carington js too good-
natured to snub such people—possibly she looks upon
them as part of the cross which she has to bear during her
sojourn in the City of the Beautiful Harbour—and so A
ticket was sent. •
You will be sorry to hear of the death, in Russia, of Mr.
Miklouho Maclay, whose charming - wife (daughter of old
Sir John Robertson) for the second time in her shdl't life
becomes a widow. 'fhC AsCetir little “Baron” was not
much liked in Sydney, chiefly because people didn’t know
him well; and he being entirely devoted to his scientific
pursuits as his wife was devoted to him, lived a solitary
sort of life at Watson's Bay, where he kept in pickle a
arge collection of human skulls \Hth the brains inside.
One day he took several of us to his “biological station ”
and exhibited his horrible spoils, which he took out of the
glass jars and lovingly caressed. At the sight of them
I felt ready to faint. The Baron used to complain
bitterly of the ignorance and stupid prejudice displayed
with regard to him by a large section of Australian society.
“People hate me,” he used to say, “because I am a
Russian” —which I am afraid was more than partially
true. Mr. Maclay was a genuinely able man, and not the
humbug a lot of people in Australia were fond of painting
him. He risked his life in scientific research, and when
found by the Russian expedition despatched in search of
him, he was almost dying from hardship. His standing in
Russia was such that the Czar granted £4OOO to pay for
the publication of his travels.
That pretty little bride now doing a honeymoon tour in
N.S.W. and Victoria, is married to a divorced individual
whose first matrimonial venture lives in the same city
where the newly-married pair will settle down ! It must
be decidedly awkward—such a thing as that! The first
wife is a pronounced cocotte. She ran away from her
husband twice, each time with somebody else, and refused
to he taken back—hence the divorce. The husband be-
haved splendidly all through the miserable business. Talk
about men not being good enough for women ! The way
in which some women behave behind their husbands’
hacks is enough to make good angels weep and had angels
chuckle.
I have heard so many masculine taunts about the size of
women’s feet that I am delighted' to be able to point out
that the biggest pair of feet I ever saw are in the posses-
sion of a certain gallant young officer of the N.S.W-
military forces. I?his geritleiriari’s feet will be a toattdr df

1 can faintly imagine the grief which Mr, Edward
Lee’s death niust have catiSe'd to his family and intimate
Mends. I wal privileged to make his acquaintance years
Ago as a fellow-passeiiger iri the San Frriiicisdo nkilbdat;
And niust sri.V that he ( wds one .of. the kindliest-natured
riien I ever knew. How well do I remember the merry
- ‘evening when iri the “City of New York’s” social-hall
tiled a certain middle-aged New Englander, who had made
money in the mines, before judge and jury for the crime
of snoring. The miner was a rough diatoond whom no-
body seemed to know, and he; poor felloA, was at first
toade the butt of tlie ship. Mr. Lee, as the only barrister
on board, prosecuted him, with a ferocity which I am
sure he could never have shown had the trial been in
earnest. The prisoner was, of course, found guilty by
the jury of 12 .ladies (amongst wlioip, by tlie way, was
Miss Ada Ward who has, just returned to Australia) aiid,
as it had .somehow leaked out that he was rich, he was
sentenced to find “ champagne for the ship ’’—the conse-
quence being that everydne had a bottle of wine at dinner
that evening. “ Is that all ?” asked the poor minerwhen
Sbhteilce was pronounced by Judge Pickersgill. I am
sure the miner's ultl uxte popularity on board was in no
small degree owing to the good nature of Mr. Lee, who
often said to us, “You, perhaps, don’t know people of his
sort as well as I do. I am sure he is a good fellow.” And
rid he proved to be', and when his voyage came to ari end
we were heartily ashamed of having left him out of all
dur parties and amusements to, mope on board by himself.
And I shall never forget the day when, while going up
the street in Sail Francisco, we met the Australian lucky
miner with His “store-clothes” on, and big fold-seams
down the legs of his light-grey trousers, and coat-sleeves
which came down over his knuckles ; and didn’t he just
look nervous as he bowed to us ! The last time I ever
spoke to Mr. Lee was at the top of the elevator leading to
Faber’s photographic gallery over the Hibernian Hotel!
He seemed a little near-sighted, and when he saw in the
mirror right in front of him the reflection of the parlour
opposite he naturally enough walked into the plate-glass,
broke the rim of his hat, and so bumped his nose that he
got no picture taken that day. These are paltry recollec-
tions, but they are all I have to offer as a souvenir of one
of that rare species of gentlemen who are considerate to
all women, rich or poor, young or old, good or bad.
Sir Daniel Cooper has recently been taking great in-
terest in the subject of cookery and assisting in the for-
mation of an English training school for the purpose of
teaching young ladies how to prepare food tor consump-
tion by gluttonous Man. I can quite understand Sir
Daniel’s interest in the matter if his experiences have
been anything like those of a certain other high-and-
mighty personage who used to relate, with much gusto,
that just after he got married, 40 years ago, in Australia,
his lovely bride instead of putting the cabbage into boil-
ing-water put it over the fire in cold-water. Of course
the longer she kept it there the tougher it got. The pair
are now disgustingly rich, and just to look at her in the
eaSTiagfi J’oil’d ttidik she’d always been a most proficient
eddk iri frill practice.
Did you ever in all your life before see such an adver-
tisement as this, which appeared last week in the Herald :
“ Jones.— ln memory of my dear husband, Richard Jones,
who died at —, George-street. Dead but not forgotten.
Inserted by his loving wife, E. H, Davis.” How nice it
must be for Mr. Davis 1
A rather humorous contretemps befell a certain friend
of mine the other day. An acquaintance took him with a
party of others into the country for a week’s kangaroo-
shooting on the station belonging to the father-in-law of
the organiser of the excursion. When they arrived at
9 p.m. all the family were in bed, and “Tom” represented
to his friends that it would be a splendid surprise for the
“old man” to wake up in the morning and find them
there. So they crept upstairs to various rooms that Mr.
“Tom” allotted to them, while he improved the occasion
by impressing them with stories about of the “old man’s”
wealth, and assuring them he stood, a good chance of
getting a big slice of it when the “old boy pegged out.’
So they went to sleep to dream of the fun they
would all have when “ Tom” came into his money. They
awoke early next morning feeling very hungry after their
supperless sleep, and not having much time to spare
they hurried downstairs for breakfast. They found
the place deserted. Not a soul appeared anywhere ;
no servants; no family ; no anything or anybody ;
not even a tame cat. They gathered on the broad veran-
dah and began to think they would have to kill their kan-
garoo before they could expect a mouthful to eat wffien
they espied a little distance off a ramshackle lean-to, from
which they smelt with the keenness of hunger something
that suggested the cooking of a meal. They crossed over.
An old man, bent with age, begrimed with dirt, and
miserably clad in remnants of ragged garments was raking
out the ashes from a Are, utterly oblivious of them and
unheedful of their wants. They looked at him for a
moment and one of them addressed him. “ Well, Cookie,
what time does old Mac turn out ? We’re in a hurry
and Want some breakfast.” Hhe ancient oiie tuPiled
slowly round and as slowly answered, “I'm him!” they
went away without another word and posted back to toWh

So black as they are painted. Sydney artists endeavour
to depict the local cits as a pack of Goths who love raw
meat and Transpontine drama, —almost having to be
chained up to listen to a soft classical adagio or a page of
Wagner. After such praise from Sir Hubert one is alnlolt
inclined to think the fleijltent inattention of Sydney con-
cert-goers is due to the musicians themselves—some of
Wtoom occasionally make one wish that when “music,
heavenly maid ”, was in the nursery, a kind friend had
mixed a little rough-on-rats in her milk and water.
If women like to have their gowns described, why ever
don’t they wear decent clothes ? At “ Faust,” the other
night, the circle was crammed with women, and not one
of them but was a dowdy I A mauve satin covered with
black Spanish lace looked pretty well, only its sense-
less wearer had dabbed common white chrysanthemums at
either sleeve and on the corsage. A well-known lady
wore black satin cut blushingly, low and trimmed with
lace—with indescribably sad effect. All the drapery
made me think my eyesight was failing me. It was also
hopelessly dingy !
I hear that certain Australian titled and other ladies
who have taken shops in the W’est End, London, have a
grievance. Customers do not care a straw that the ladies
should own the shop, select the materials, and set the
fashions. Oh f no ! they want to be, as one of the distin-
guished shopkeepers recently remarked, “ actually
waited upon by a countess.” And her presence in the
“ shop ” quintuples the takings.
I went to “ Sophia” the other night and sat opposite a
well-known Sydney “ woman of fashion,” who had gotten
herself up a I’lmperatrice. On her head she wore a
coronet of black velvet edged with diamonds and a mauve
plume at its left side. We aren’t used to head-dresses
just yet, so the effect was somewhat bizarre. The play
went well and is fittingly mounted, and I only noticed
one incongruity. The bell in the boudoir scene is a small
and painfully modern press-gong !
I heard a queer little story about a suburban doctor the
other day. Mrs. H. was indisposed. Doctor B. was
called in. He enters her chamber, where Mrs. H. is an lit
—throws himself down beside her on the pillows, twirls a
piece of heliotrope close to her eyes, and asks her softly if
she knows what the flower signifies ? Heliotrope means
devotion ! Tableau : He is ejected on his little pink ear.
In a romantic farm by the “sad sea waves,” where I
lately rusticated in search of colour to start the winter
on, there “dwelt a little maiden,” pretty as paint, whose
golden hair Godiva would have envied. She had blue
eyes, rose cheeks, cream skin, dewdrop, kissable mouth,
and looked gentle as a moonbeam In the dusk one even-
ing she and I fraternised, and this is what ensued. “I
suppose you know everyone in Sydney?” “No—only
very few.” “Oh! Did you ever see a hanging?” “No!”
“ Did you ever know anybody who was hanged ?’ (appeal-
ingly) “No!” “Oh! well, anyway, its offal nice to live in
Sydney ! Wouldn’t I love to see a tram accident!” I
hurriedly retired here, and left this disappointing dream
of loveliness to wink sweetly at the evening star, ponder-
ing, I suppose, over the pure pleasures of an inquest.
Our own Mrs. has at last been eclipsed by another
lady who has also risen from the ranks. She was at a
dinner party lately and was extolling the charms of a cer-
tain gentleman of her acquaintance. Said she: “Yes,
my dear, he is perfectly delightful. Indeed, he is just the
kind of man with whom one could enjoy a siesta.” (Con-
vulsions at the dinner table.) Of course the poor woman
meant to say a tHo-a-tMe.
I hear that much annoyance is expressed in Sydney
at the haughtiness of a somewhat newly-fledged
Crown Land official who shakes hands with Queen’s
Counsel, but only gives two fingers to common solicitors.
The regime terrible of the dCcollCtte toilette is likely to
continue, the next fashion for full evening dress being the
old-fashioned Bertha, and that reveals more bony back—
scraggy “ salt-cellars”—and pipe-stem arms than tlie
present style. A woman in a Bertha looks like cold fowl
—it gives quite a “garnished” effect to feminine loveli-
ness. Still they wear it, for the rule amongst women is
“ If it’s the fashion it must become me.”
Mr. George Stuart, late Vice-Consul for America in
Sydney, has lately returned from New Britain, where he
has been acting as consul, fighting natives, and doing al
kinds of disagreeable things for the past year. He brings
back with him his faithful little black boy, who helped
him and shot one of the chiefs who attacked their wigwam
one night. Mr. StUart, Who has had a surfeit of saVage life,
came back with the intention of resuming his old position
of ViOe-Gotlsul here. But, aids! one should not put any
trust either in princes or consuls. His position was
usurped by a stranger to the American flag, and Mr.
Stuart has returned to his native land (N.Z.) with hi*
heart full of indignation, and a Arm conviction that, after
dll, Vice-Consulships, Government House, and alt the
attendant vanities are hardly worth tile years of labour
He has spent to Obtain thenl. The American flag has lost

M. tiicifen Henry; of Sydney; lias befell
especially successful, in applying Australian sub
jects to the decorative arts. Amongst other de-
signs is a particularly fine panel modelled by Mi
Henry for Mr. Norman Selfc. It has been repro
duced in terra-cotta, and represents an Australian
lyre-bird, so, adapted to tne design of aii antefix
as to cpntaiii the main lines, of that of the pedi-
ment of the Teniple of Egina. The conception
embraces the idea of “Advance Australia ”
represented by the forward march of the lyre-bird
in the act of stepping over a scroll upon which, is
written the word “Australia.” Behind the lyfe :
form, outlined Ipy the. bird’s, tail,, rise's the Austra-
lian sun, _while in front of the whole design are
waving-lines indicating water —the ocean which
cuts, off Australia from the rest of the. world and
Which has enabled her to grow into a nation. The
whole idea is intensely Australian, national arid
patriotic, and is a good sample qf the work
capable of being inspired by the He publican ideal.
Mr. Sutherland, the most incapable mem-
ber of the most illiterate and dunderheaded
Ministry ever known in N.S.W., was mildly
criticised in the Assembly the other night by Pre-
mier Parkes, who declared that the Minister of
Works had “ made a mistake.” Excepting in the
Evening News office Mr. Sutherland was never
known to make anything else, unless he drib-
bled wisdom unconsciously, so the statement
did not seem wide of the mark. Parkes’ gentle
remark, however, that his colleague was going on
as usual attracted a certain amount of attention,
and one gentleman who was present endeavoured
to bet with Messrs. Wall, Copeland, and several
others that the Evening News would develope
nto a fiery leader on the subject in its very next
issue. And so the event proved. The politics of
the News consist solely in keeping this one dismal
muddler in office on the strength of some ancient
personal friendship with the family of Bennett.
When a new Ministry is being formed its head
receives direct and positive intimation that
old Sutherland must have a portfolio or
the News will descend upon the Cabinet
in a heap. When tlxe hoary blunderer
developes his customary inability to write three
consecutive sentences of decent English, and
proves utterly incapable of understanding any-
thing when it is explained to him 18 times over
and can’t even sit up and smile his fatuous smile
at a crisis without going to sleep, the News falls
like an avalanche on any one who ventures to
allude to his uselessness. All through his polifical
life “ Honest ” John Sutherland has suffered from
a chronic incompetence to pull his foot out of the
mud, and hasn’t known what to do with it when it
was out, but still he continues to be the sum total of
the News’s political creed, and now that Parkes
has ventured to remark that the sleepy old dullard
has “ made a mistake ” —and lie might with jus-
tice have added that it was the only thing he ever
had made—the Evening Bennett ' instantly pro-
ceeds to prophesy the speedy downfall of that
frequent and energetic insolvent. The Opposi-
tion, it states, “ has hopes that it may lead to a
state of things intolerable to Mr. Sutherland as
an honest and capable administrator, and there-
fore, entailing his resignation. They know that
this would mean the speedy downfall of the
Ministry, which would, of course, give them an
opportunity.” It is the old talc of Waterloo under
slightly altered circumstances. When the day of
battle comes, the Brummagem Wellington will
raise his voice and ask if Private Murphy is in
the ranks, and the Murphy of the Works Depart-
ment not being there the result will be chaos.

THE HAPSBURG DOUBLE IRON-FRAMED
PIANOS
Possess the following advantages :
Ist. The WIRES are of a very high quality, and
intensely sensitive ; their vibrations, reverbe-
rated by a sounding board of special construc-
tion, are clear and bell-like, instead of the
muffled, or tinkettly, or metallic sounds so
common im cheap English or French pianos.
2nd. The action is perfect check repeater.
3rd. All the Hapsburg Pianos are Trichord.
4th. They are all Seven Octaves.
sth. They have consolidated Iron Frames of great
strength, thus resisting the rapid mutations of
a humid tropical climate, and requiring tuning
only at long intervals.
6th. The Felts are Clinched on the Hammers, in-
stead of being fastened by glue, as is the case
with nearly every piano except the Hapsburg,
7th. They have Brass or Nickel-faced Rest Planks,
instead of the old-fashioned perishable style.
Bth. Rust is guarded against, wherever possible,
by the substitution of bronze for other metals.
9th. The outer cases are handsome in design, and
of durable and beautiful woods ; they can be
had in Walnut, or in Walnut and Gold, or in
Ebony and Gold.

■
Beale Patent Washer, Wringer and Mangle.
The Beale Patent Washer may be simply de-
scribed as follows, and we ask you kindly to refer
to the illustration. The vertical tub is very care-
fully made, with fluted sides. It is stationary, only
the water and clothes being agitated by an accu-
rately shaped dolly, which is worked by a fly-wheel.
The clothes are simply dropped in, no arrangement
or packing being wanted. The special reversing
gear moves this dolly swiftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very small expenditure of strength
suffices to lash the water into a mass of foaming
suds. In the process the clothes are floated to and
fro, up and down; currents and cross-currents of
water are formed which meet and are forced through
and through the fabric, carrying away every particle
of dirt and stain. The linen being merely. SUS-
PENDED in the water, is not rubbed and scrubbed
as in hand-washing. Neither has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process which in-
sensibly rips, tears and wears the clothes. Thus,
the most delicate fabrics cannot be torn by our
system of washing. Everyone has noticed that
their clothes seem to be as much worn by washing
as by use. This is caused by the fierce rubbing
«they get upon washing-boards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this
friction is done away with. Therefore, the clothes
will last far longer than by hand-washing, however
careful. When the washing is done, the tub should
be wiped out, so that it be always sweet and clean.
There is no false bottom, and nothing to accumu-
late greasy sediments.

A Great Reform.
(BY GARNET WALCH.)
If the man who causes two blades of grass to spring where
but one grew before is worthy of being styled a public
benefactor, some such title is surely the due of those who,
in this practical age, enable the purchaser of any article
to obtain it at first cost, without the intervention of that
bug-bear, the “ middle-man.” Hence, in giving a descrip-
tion of the flourishing undertaking now under notice, we
feel more than justified in combining with our remarks a
brief history of its founder. To begin at the beginning,
then, Mr. A. W. Feme was born in America, and went - to
London about the time the great “ Iron Duke ” was lying
in state ; served his apprenticeship in “ woollens ” in the
“ little village by the Thames,” from whence, about 19
years ago, he proceeded to New York, thence to San
Francisco, and so further round the globe to New Zea-
land, where he obtained an appointment immediately on
landing. He was soon after taken in as partner in a
lucrative concern where he was able to follow lago’s ad"
vice to Cassio, and put money in his purse. New Zealand,
however, did not long satisfy his ambitious nature, and he
moved a few hundred miles further on, to Marvellous
Melbourne. Here, at the outset, he troubled his mind
little about business, but, like most young men of his age,
fond of “ seeing life,” spent his ready cash pretty freely,
and eventually ran short of the “ sinews of war.” Look-
ing about him, he abtained an appointment, at a small
salary, in Messrs. Death, Schiess, and Co.’s warehouse,
with, as the firm plainly told him, no great hope of any-
thing much better in the immediate future. But so
thoroughly did he prove his value that in two weeks he
was made manager of the whole tailoring department.
Remaining in this position fora while, and accumulating a
little capital, he decided to start on his own account. He
had recognised the great want in Victoria of some one who
would supply the public with tailor-made clothes cut to
order, but at a price as low as that charged by the slop
manufacturer. He forthwith opened a shop in Fitzroy,
on the new principle, and this proving highly successful,
one establishment each in Carlton, West Melbourne,
Hotham, Richmond, Prahran, and Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne, and two in Emerald Hill, speedily followed.
About this time telephones were coming into vogue, and
Mr. Ferne ; seeing how Useful the new invention would be
to him, started the first private telephone exchange in
Victoria,- connecting his various branches with his dwell-
ing house - , so that from his breakfast-room of a morning
he' could c'oftntiunieate with his subordinates. But the
overwork consequent upon this high-pressure rate of
business began to tell upon his constitution, and his
medical adviser counselled his trip to Europe. He de-
cided to sell out the entire concern, and readily found a
purchaser, hefng hound over not to open again for five
years within a hundred miles of the Melbourne Post Office,
under a penalty of £5OOO. Prior to leaving for the Old
Country, he fancied a visit to Ballarat blight benefit his
health, and he therefore rail up to that city, which, as
bur readers know, is a little—a very little—more than 100
miles from the General Post Office, Melbourne. This, and
the fact that the bracing air of Ballarat certainly
suited him, had the effect of postponing his sea-voyage,
and we next find him surprising the good folk of the
Second City in Victoria by the same style of things that
had taken Melbourne by storm. A comparatively short
sojourn here sufficed to work up a prosperous business,
which, when leaving, he sold out at an excellent price.
On the eve of his departure, the high personal esteem
with which he was regarded was pleasantly testified by a
farewell banquet at Craig’s Hotel, attended by a number
of representative gentlemen. Arrived in London, Mr. Feme
started excellent establishments there, but, as soon as his
health was thoroughly renovated, was back in Victoria.
Prohibited by his agreement from touching Melbourne, he
again went a fraction over the hundred miles “nomin-
ated in the bond,” this time to Sandhurst, where—now
some six years ago-—he started the London and American
Tailoring Company, with which his name is at the pre-
sent date so honourably associated. In Sandhurst he
opened two establishments. Then, to acquire the latest
information in his line, and to extend his operations as
rapidly as possible, he travelled to America, opening in
New York, and from thence to London. During the next
two and a half years he visited the chief cities of Eng-
land, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, picking up experience
as he went—and to these places succeeded France, Italy
and Germany —passing through Egypt, both before and
after the war. Arriving once more in Victoria, and the
term of his contract not having expired he opened two
more establishments in Sandhurst. Here, as had been the
case during his earlier sojourn in Fitzroy, his popularity
caused him to be invited to stand for the local Council,
but his answer on each occasion was in the negative, since
he wished to devote his whole time and energies to the
study of his business. A single day after his five-year-old
agreement expired he re-opened in Melbourne, with in-
creased capital, provided by the Directors of his Com-
pany, bought out Mr. Charles Middleton’s two establish-
ments in Bourke-street and Gertrude-street respectively,
and is already, undoubtedly, doing the largest retail trade
in his line in the metropolis. The operations of the Lon-
don and American Tailoring Company are expanding
daily in Melbourne, and branches are contemplated, not
only in Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, but in San Fran-
cisco and the chief cities of the Old World. The Lon-
don Head Office is in Basinghall-street, and the Central
Depot in Melbourne—in addition to two other places
in Bourke-street —is at the corner of the Eastern
Market—whereof more anon. Responding, the other
day, to a cordial invitation, we had ocular proof
of how the London and American Tailoring Company con-
duct operations, and gained an insight, we must confess,
into the reasons for the increasing popularity they enjoy.
We first inspected the factory in Lonsdale-street, to which
the orders from the various branches are forwarded, and
where they are carefully made up from the cloth selected
by the customer. Every order, even of the smallest
nature, passes, we are told, through about twenty hands,
and necessitates some sixteen entries in the various books
kept for the purpose. At Lonsdale-street we found a
busy scene, but regulted with the utmost system. Here,
in ' one department, were “ Cutters ” ; in another
“ Dressers ” ; in a third, “Trimmers”; while on the top
story were the .“Machinists.” Every garment we here
saw had been; cut to order, and a deposit paid on it. Even
the “ JT-dollar pants,” or in other words, the 12s. 6d.
trousers, of which the Company make a specialty, were
all 1‘ to measure,” so that, by doing away with ail inter-
mediate profits, and notwithstanding the heavy duty on
imported cloth, the Company can actually beat the “slop-
made ” articles in point of cheapness, while accurate fit is
guaranteed in every garment. With such inducements,
who would’ patronise the “reach-me-downs” of old?
From Lonsdale-street we proceeded to the four Bourke-
street branches, noticing in each the elegant and costly
fittings, the electric-light chandeliers, the mirrors, the
telephones for speedy communication, and, above all, the
splendid stocks of cloth in every variety of most fashion-
able pattern. This refinement of modern style in decora
tion and equipment was most observable in the Chief
Depot, at the Eastern Market Corner (formerly the branch
Post Office) where, of an evening, the Wenham Light,
the Albo-Carbon Light, and the Electric Light vie with
each other to forestall the glories of jubilee illuminations,
as they glow and glitter in reflected brilliancy from the
mirrors, plate-glass and gilding, lavishly yet artistically
bestowed at every point. And here a word of praise is
due to Mr. Leaves, of Hotham, for his four large-sized
figures, so admirably executed in silver on the outer
windows. “ Hi&r spricht Man Deutsch” and “ Igi on
Parle Frangqis ” were legends, showing how thoroughly
a cosmopolitan community is catered for,-while “ By ap-
pointment H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh,” and a similar
announcement with regard to Sir Henry Loch, proved that
the tastes of all are both consulted and gratified. Indeed,
framed in the windows is there not on the one hand a
letter from the Government House, Melbourne, stating
that “His. Excellency is much pleased with the clothes
made for himself and Master Loch ; and, on the other,
another autog’raph communication from Messrs, “ John
George Deeble and William Beach,” expressing their ‘ 1 aston-
ishment at the marvellous celerity ” displayed by the Com-
pany in turning out, in six hours, a couple of suits that
gave the Renowned Champion Oarsman and his friend
“ every satisfaction.” Such testimonials speak for them-
selves. A rapid visit to the Gertrude-street Establish-
ment and our tour was at an end, leaving in our mind a
conviction that the London and American Tailoring Com-
pany, with Mr. Feme for their commander-in-chief, are
working a perfect’revolution in tjie retail tailoring trade
and are deservedly destined to achieve a world-wide
success.

The Mine is situated U mile from the town of Oberon, and consists of 'twenty-four (M) acres held under Mining-
Leases from the Crown. See Mr. A. P. Burtt’s report herewith for further particulars. °
To show their confidence in the mine the Proprietors agree to accept Shares as Payment, with the addition of
£llOO in cash on formation of Company, to pay for machinery already erected.
The amount of application and allotment money, viz., £4OOO, will, after deducting- the £llOO to proprietors and
paying- usual floating expenses, leave Sufficient hash in hand to purchase the required pumping- and wihdino- »-ear and
keep the mine in full working- order until after the next crushing.
Their only reason, for placing the mine before the public is that they are unable to cope With the water on the
lower workings with their present appliances.
The eleven Proprietors (all practical miners) with their families, seventy in all, living on the property, have for
the last three years supported themselves in comfort, and have also purchased and erected a powerful 10-stamper
battery with a 12-h.p. engine and other plant out of the proceeds of their crushings. .

Homeward Bound Gold Beef.
Locality.—This property is situated one-and-half mile south of the township of Oberon, eighteen miles from the
Railway Station of Tarana, on the Western Line, 121 miles from Sydney.
Description.—The Company’s ground consists of a quarter of a mile along the course of the reef, with the usual
width. The country rook is soft granite, traversed by two main gold-bearing reefs, having a sirike approximately East
and West, with a southerly underlie of about 35deg. from the horizon.
Mine Excavations.—The more southerly of these, called Turner’s Reef, was worked some time since for a lineal
distance of 200 yards down to the water level (40 feet), with payable results. This reef is parallel to, and distant from
the Homeward Bound reef, 150 yards, which latter reef has been worked for a lineal distance of over 250 yards and to
a vertical depth of 70 feet, giving a height sloped away following the underlie of reef of about 200 feet. The reef
above this level has averaged a width of 10 inches, and given a return of 15dwt. per ton. At the lowest level the reef
standing in the bottom is over a foot wide, and the last crushing gave loz. per ton. The parcel of stone now o-oino-
through the battery (50 tons) is expected to yield results fully equal, and from the appearance of the plates there ap-
pears little doubt that such will he the case. The water is now being raised by means of a “ horse-whip ” but is
rather too quick for that means of haulage, and before the mine can be deepened it is essential that pumping o-ear be
put in. The stone in these reefs consists of quartz with stains of Manganese and a little Auriferous Iron Pyrites
which appear to he increasing in the bottom level. Two other reefs also outcrop on this ground to the north-west of
these main reefs, No. 1 having a strike N. 25deg. E. underlying East, with a width of 2 feet, showing- Iron Pyrites in
the quartz ; No. 2 reef, 250 yards south-east of No. 1, showing_a vertical quartz reef 2 feet thick.
Machinery.—There is a very good crushing plant on the ground, consisting of a 12 h.p. portable engine driving 10
heads of stampers, with the usual mercury tables, &o.
Remarks.—The larger portion of the ground above bottom level having been sloped away, it will be necessary to
put down a new shaft to cut the reef at a deeper level, say 200 ft. vertical. This will require a winding and pumping
engine with a column of Sin. pipes, which should be ample for that depth. This will give backs, presuming the reef to
continue its present underlie, of over 300 ft. on the course of the reef. If this is done lam convinced an extensive and
profitable mine will be opened up. Another mode would he to bring in a deep adit crosscut from the Fish River
Which, in a length of 2000 ft., would out the reef at a depth of 150 ft., and there is every probability of such crosscut ini
tersecting other auriferous reefs now hidden from view by surface deposit, which, in places, as shown in the shafts
already sunk, has been as deep as 50 feet before the rook was reached, but even were this done, the new shaft is a
necessity. I estimate the cost of winning and crushing the reef stone below the bottom level at 15s’. per ton, and esti-
mating the auriferous contents at 15dwt. only per ton, and the gold at 70s. per oz., the net profit per ton of stone would
be £ll7s. 6d., allowing for expenses of management, &c., a return of 150 per cent, on the outlay.
In conclusion, I would observe that I have seen few properties that, considering the easy and favourable nature of
the ground, the increased size and value of the reef at the deepest level, as compared with the upper workings, its con-
venient position and good supply of suitable timber in the immediate vicinity, offer such a legitimate opportunity for
the profitable investment of capital.

A Special Invitation.
We especially invite a trial by all tho-e sufferers
from kidney and liver complaints who have failed
to obtain relief from other remedies and from
doctors. Nature’s great remedy, dk. bell’s
bitters, has effected cures in many obstinate
cases. It acts at once on the kidneys, liver and
bowels, cleansing the system of all poisonous
humours and restoring a healthy condition to those
important organs. Do not be discouraged, but
try it.
IF TUB SUFFERERS FROM CONSUMPTION, SCROFULA, AND
General Debility, will try Scott’s Emulsion of Pure Cod
Liver Oil with Hypopiiosphites, they will find immediate
relief and a permanent benefit. The Medical Profession
in the various countries of the world, universally declare
it a remedy of the greatest value ; and as it is very
palatable, it can he readily taken by the most sensitive
stomach, and will never fail to give relief and comfort to
the sufferer. Any Chemist can supply it at 4s. 6d.*
Old Port, Claret, Hock, Sherry, Rousillon, Madeira,
Muscat, Tokay, &o. Unequalled High-class Wines are
only to be had from Hookings of 410 George-street, under
Marshall, chemist, near King.street."
A Lovely and Delicate Complexion.— This is ob-
tained by using Rowlands’ Kalydor, an emollient and
harmless milk for the face, hands, and arms ; it removes
sunburn, tan, freckles, redness and roughness of the skin,
cutaneous eruptions, &c., and produces soft, fair, and
delicate skin. Avoid metallic and greasy cosmetics, which
ruin the skin. Rowland’s Odonto, a non-gritty tooth-
powder, whitens the teeth. Ask chemists for Rowlands’
articles.
MO MORE HARD TIMES.
If you will stop spending so much on fine clothes, rich
food and style, buy good, healthy food, cheaper and better
clothing, get more real and substantial things of life
every way, and especially stop the foolish habit of em-
ploying expensive quack doctors or using so much of the
vile humbug medicine that does you only harm, but put
your trust in that simple, pure remedy, Dr. Soule’s Ameri-
can Hop Bitters, that cures always at a trifling cost, and
you will see good times and have good health.—
“ Chronicle.”
GUILTY OF WRONG.
Some people have a fashion of confusing- excellent
remedies with the large mass of “patent medicines,” and
in this they are guilty of a wrong. There are some
advertised remedies fully worth all that is asked for them,
and one at least we know of : Dr. Soule’s American Hop
Bitters. The writer has had occasion to use the Bitters in
just such a climate as we have most of the year in Bay
City, and has always found them to he first-class and
reliable, doing all that is claimed for them. —“Tribune.”
Colonial Maladies.— The Colonists of N.S.W. are to bo
congratulated on two grounds. First, that they inhabit a
land where disease, as a rule, prevails in a mild and cur-
able form, and secondly, because the majority have ready
to hand a remedy that does away with the doctor and
medicine chest. This important Medicine was discovered
by Mr. Richard Freeman in 1844, and named by him Chloro-
dyne, which medicine continues to maintain its supremacy
ail over the World as a special and specific remedy for the
treatment and cure of Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Cholerine,
Malaise, Hysteria, pain of every kind, Nervous affections,
Gout, Asthma, Consumption, Coughs, Colds and fever.—
Sold everywhere throughout the Colonies. Insist upon
tpvving “Freeman’s” only. Reject substitutes as they are
worthless. Trade Mark, an Elephant.
William’s Australian Insecticide is death to all insects.
Simple in application—sure in effect. This is the only
genuine Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to
all kinds of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal
life, and therefore may be used without the slightest
apprehension. For the extermination of Mosquitos
especially, the Insecticide has no equal—as the fumes of
the burnt powder, while throwing off a pleasant odour,
are at the same time most destructive to them. Sold in
Is. boxes by all chemists and storekeepers. Manufactured
only by W. Williams, Pharmaceutical Chemist, 257 King-
street, Newtown. Wholesale from Messrs Elliott Bros.,
"and E. Prosser & Co.*

Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure in recom-

and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of

all who suffer from liver complaint to try them.—

for so many years.

It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from gene ml debility. It’s only a

A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT.
“O, DEAR ME, WHAT SHALL I DO? MY SHOE-STRING HAS COME UNTIED,
AND THERE’S THAT DREADFUL SOCIAL PURITY SOCIETY JUST BEHIND
ME!”—Puck.
The latest “good thing” in N.Z. mining
shows that it is still dangerous to salt a claim with
gold-filings. The most pressing want of the day
is a machine to irregularise minute particles of
abraded metal.
A telegram in the Sydney E. News sa,ys
that the escort has left the Hodgkinson River with
21 tons of gold. As this represents somewhere
about £2,500,000, it is plain that N.Q. is now
getting along very nicely.
At the Silver Wedding family dinner the
Princess of Wales was attired in a most becoming
and appropriate gown of grey and silver. Besides
the magnificent tiara of diamonds —described
as being stiff and barbaric in design—presented to
her by the 365 personal friends, she wore a small
spray of orange-blossoms with one diminutive
orange peeping out from under the leaves. This
last she accounted for very prettily by explaining
that she was no longer a blossom, but had budded
into fruit.

The liver is the
largest gland in the
body. It is the
great filterer of the
body. All the blood
E asses through it to
e refined or pointed
according to the
condition of that
organ. If, by reason
of disease, whether
it be what is
termed Hot, Cold,
Inflamed, Ulcerous,
Obstructed, Jaun-
diced, or whatever
not —it fails to per-
form its true func-
tions, disease and
debility promptly
follow. With a
‘sound, healthy stomach and pure blood, the liver
will never became diseased. The evidences of its
existence are numerous. Exhaustion, even upon
slight effort—going up hill or up stairs; costfve-
ness of the bowels ; a sense of weight or pain
across the lower part of the chest; a greenish hue
of the skin ; sometimes liver spots on the surface;
burning palms and heat in the soles of the feet;
frequently a dry cough; furred tongue; saltish
taste in the mouth; dull headaches and very
heavy eyelids. Those who suffer from Liver
Complaint are familiar with one or more of the
symptoms above described. A weak, defective
stomach and a bilious state of the same, are the
prime causes of this disease. Any remedy that
will tone up the stomach, cleanse the blood of its
impurities, give strength, vigor and action to the
constitution, will remove the exciting causes and
effect a cure of this common disease. No medi-
cine is so well adapted to remove it, produce pure
blood, and thereby relieve all the organs from the
terrible effects of Liver Complaint, as bell’s
bitters. It has no equal in all cases of Liver
Complaint.

Mount Gilead, the picturesque and —as
colonial history goes—ancient estate of Mr. E. B.
Woodhouse,_ was, the other day, submitted for
sale by auction and withdrawn. There are in the
estate 2060 acres, but so much has land improved
in value during the past few years, that a bid of £l6
17s. 6d. was considered too small, the owner hav-
ing reason to believe that he can obtain a much
higher figure. Mount Gilead is one of the oldest
settled areas in the colony, and on it are an old
mill and other picturesque buildings built by con-
vict labour in the days when according to Parke*
N.S.W. stretched from one sea-coast to another.
The poor old Melbourne Argus has been
left behind so often that it resolved for once to be
up to time, even if it should stay out of bed for a
week to do it. Accordingly when the Bulgarian
war scare started, a good many months ago, it
sent a reporter to the scene, and everywhere
on the map of Europe where horses’
hoofs were mingled with human brains, and
bombs were being laid on with a lavish hand,
that reporter had got to go. He was to earn his
oats by taking notes, and when the cataclysm
came and the whole world was reeling to its fall
he was to write down the fact. But the war
never arrived, and the special cruises aimlessly
about the Mediterranean feeling very lonesome
and yawning hideously as he jots down corres-
pondence regarding ruins and thistles and other
things which he has met with in furrin parts.
And yet when the Argus gets dog-tired of this
work and recalls him the war will break out right
off with unexampled frenzy. Providence seems
to run this world solely in order that the Argus
may get “ left.”

Can it be Fido ? Fido 1 Fido ! ” (She holds
out her hand under the bed, and the wise burglar
licks it). _ “Oh! all right! It is Fido.” She
then retires, reassured, and sleeps through the
burglary.
The prisoners tried before Judge Mein at
last Brisbane Assizes had a rough time of it. His
Honor’s liver was out of order, and he snarled and
snapped at everyone in the court, from the Crown
Prosecutor to the usher. One prisoner, found
guilty of stealing a coat, was sentenced to three
years’ imprisonment by his Honor, with the com-
forting remark that the prisoner seemed fond of
gaol. Another offender named Tate, charged
with uttering a cheque for £7 odd, and who con-
ducted his own defence in a manner that would
do credit to any barrister, was sent to gaol for
seven years, Judge Mein admiringly remarking
that the accused was a clever scoundrel. He
meant a clever lawyer, of course.
This is the sort of Christianity which is
preached by a N.Z. Bulletin correspondent:—
“Even Providence is giving the anti-Chinese
agitation a lift—Chinkies, variously estimated at
from 50,000 right up to 7,000,000, have been drowned
by the inundation of the Ho-ang-ho. ” Hooray for
the Ho-ang-ho !
Sing ho ! yeo ho ! The Ho-ang-ho,
Mightier river than Elbe or Po !
Flow, flow,
Chinkie-exterminator, flow,
And with drowned corses flavour the Pekoe.
What ho !
Subscription gathering go
For the millions starving on the Ho-ang-ho?
No!
Not so !
Pity stow—
Let ’em starve by the Ho-ang-ho.

in other words, a conglomeration of symptoms producing
a certain result, there is no reason why it cannot be
moved with the proper remedies, therefore he guarantees.

The prophecies of The Bulletin— and 99
per cent, of Sydney boating-men—were verified
on Saturday last, when the N.S.W. so-called re-
presentatives received, on the' Saltwater River, an
ignominious dressing-down at the hands of the
Victorian eight-oar crew. When names were first
picked for a crew, four Sydney Rowing Club oars-
men—the brothers Kennedy, Johnson, and Dob-
son—drunk with theis victory last season in several
races over very indifferent crews, refused to row,
and it was only after a deal of persuasion that
they consented to take seats. Had the four been
tip-top men in an eight, it would have been bad
enough for the Association so to degrade itself,
but neither Gerald Kennedy’s nor Dobson’s per-
formances and style in an eight entitle him, as a
matter of course, to seats in a truly representative
crew. Kennedy, last year, caught a crab which
threw the whole crew out of gear, and on Saturday
Dobson, who was, absurdly enough, made stroke.
repeated the performance, and caused the crew to
stop rowing at what would have been a vital part
of the race—had they had the ghost of a show.
Nice intercolonial crews, truly, which cannot row
over a course without floundering and catching
crabs like a parcel of school-girls !
It would seem
that the aquatic
critics of Australia
are not so keen as
the touts who set
the market at home.
Good odds were laid
on the N.S.W. crew
before Saturday’s
race proved they
were not in it with
the Victorians,
whereas, judging
from English pre-
cedents, victory
should have been a
foregone conclusion
for the visitors,
barring accidents.
Hobson certainly
caught a crab soon
after the start, but
that accident didn’t
account for an all-
round failure. A
bad boat, bad steer-
ing and bad form
at racing speed were
defects which shoidd
not have escaped
close observers of
trial spins.

Bolger, a bookmaker on the flat, brought
an action against the stewards of the V.A.T.C.
for turning him off the course after he had drily
paid his admission money. Bolger, it seems, has
for years been licensed by the V.A.T.C. and
allowed to bet at Caulfield, but recently the Club
passfd a resolution barring all bookmakers who
are not licensed by the mighty V. R. 0., whose fee
Bolger objects to pay. Hence Mr. I’, was mauled
about by a policeman when he put in his last ap-
pearance at Caulfield. Judge Williams decided
that the V.A T.C. bnd no right to sling out
Bolger, and even doubted if they had power to
enforce a license-fee on any bookmaker, so the
Club is let in for £25 damages and costs. The
V.A.T.C. run their show on unalienated Crown
lands.

s|The Hon. James White has pursued an

The Dubbo Liberal will, we presume, be
prosecuted for contempt in re the scathing com-
ments passed by it in its leading article of 18th
instant, respecting the judicial bearing of Mr.
Windeyer, of the N.S.W. Supreme Court.
“ Woppity” Smith, one of the two chief
witnesses for the Crown in the police-conducted
Mount Bennie trial, a disqualified jockey, a mags-
man, a pimp, a sly-grog informer, and an ordinary
vagabond and snide-adventurer, has been convicted
at Bathurst of arson before Justice Windeyer.
But why was he sebt to Bathurst gaol instead of
Berrima, to bbtaih Which locale of punishment ire
was sentenced to two years and eleven InonthS
imprisonment instead of thre'e years? Judge
Windeyer has sentenced many and many a man,
who, compared with Mr. “Woppity ” Smith, was
a paragon of virtue, to bear himself company for
nine months in the chill solitudes of Berrima “ soli-
tary.” Mr. “ Woppity ” Smith is a lucky man.
The last time he appeared before Mr. justice
Windeyer he was one of the two “heroes worthy
of the Victoria Cross,” who bore “witness” at
that monstrous travesty of justice, the Mount
Rennie trial. Since then this scoundrel, whose
evidence-together with that of the blood-soaked
forger, Stanley—was the verbal gallows on which
nine miserable boys were sentenced to death and
four of them actually banged, has appeared before
the courts in the loathsome capacity of a sly-grog
informer. The Bulletin notices, with astonish-
ment, that Sir Alfred Stephenis to act as Lieuten-
ant-Governor of N.S.W. during Governor Car-
ington’s- absence at Norfolk Island. Has the ideal
of Justice sunk bo low, then, that this worn-out
relic of the anctient regime is to sit at the head of
the Executive table and wield the shears of Fate
ere he has explained or denied the tremendous
allegations made against him by the Australian
Star in respect to his connection with the Stanley
Testimonial Fund ?

“Ah Englishman”; Englaiid hals cpiite as
huich to fear from the Chinaman as has Australia, for the
Chinaman may yet invade India from one side while the
Russian enters it from the other. Chiha can send mil-
lions to India, but only thousands, at the worst, to Auh
tralia. There is no reason why the English Tories should
be allowed to exploit Australia simply because of oui’
prospective Chinese difficulties. Better for us to have to
fight China than to live in so-called peace as the puppets
of Jingoism. Better fight Chinamen on our coasts or even
